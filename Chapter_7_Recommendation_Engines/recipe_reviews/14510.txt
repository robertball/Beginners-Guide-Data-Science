Nothing signals the start of summer like grilled corn on the cob! I soaked my corn first in cold water with a bit of sugar and salt for about an hour inside the husks (peeling back the husk a bit and removing a bit of the silk then putting the husk back). I put the corn in husks on the grill for 30 minutes rotating it around the coals vs. using foil. The corn cooks by steaming inside the husks. I softened the butter and added the rest of the ingredients using dijon for the prepared mustard. These definitely are tangy and spicy!

This wasn't as "zesty" as it was cooked on the corn, BUT if you put it on the corn after grilling, it has the zing.  I dipped my ham in the left over butter sauce and it was delicious!  I will make this mixture with ham from now on!!  Thanks Teresa!

Very good. My daugher made it and everyone liked it. I can't wait to try it on corn that is sweeter than what we had tonight!

I didn't use this with corn on the cob, instead making it a sauce to stir into frozen corn. Maybe grilling it would have imparted better flavor...it just tasted like corn and mustard. Don't think I'll retry.

I have been wanting to make this for some time and was not disappointed. I do think the name should be changed because instead of zestiness, you just get a nice blend of flavors. It is not overwhelming and that is a good thing. Decreased the  mustard just a tad because I do not like a lot of yellow mustard in a recipe but everything else was the same. Cooked beautifully on the grill; make sure that you don't have any tears or holes in the foil -- all the sauce will run out and you will end up with dry, tough corn. After cooking, I cut the kernels off the cob. They got into the Mexican rice side dish and it was delicious that way as well. This was a great recipe and will make it many, many more times. Paired this with the adobo sirloin recipe from this site, the rice and warm flour tortillas.

We grilled this recipe almost a year ago, and my boyfriend and I still talk about it!  Very good, I was very very skeptical of the horse radish, as I HATE anything that is too powerful and over the top, but it was delicious- it was the hit of the BBQ.  I would double what the recipe makes for the amount of corn it suggests, because we almost wished for more flavor.  Will do again for special BBQs.

This was good but I guess I had higher expectations.  I think the mustard overpowered the side dish...and I would have rather tasted the corn.  Might try again to tinker with....but still good.  Thanks for the post.

Really good. Remember to tent, I felt it needed "something else" and added a couple splashes of liquid smoke.

This was unbelievably tasty! I never would have thought of these seasonings for corn, but it was awesome. Not spicy to me at all. The mustard is really the 'must have' ingredient. I didn't even taste the horseradish. May use a bit more next time. It is imperative that you wrap loosly to allow for steam. That is what keeps it moist and tender. I thought 20 minutes on the grill, indirect heat, was ideal. Thanks for a fabulous idea!

This was a very tasty method for preparing fresh corn.  My family enjoyed the flavour very much.  I added onion rings and thin slices of potato to the bottom of the parcels.

This was so tasty!  I did alter it a bit. Used dijon mustard (As we are big fans here!) and added some granulated garlic. I put the corn on a cookie sheet and poured the butter mixture over it and cooked it in the oven.  It was excellent and there were no leftovers. Will be making this again very soon!

Really good; followed recipe to a T but then I made 3 with all ingredients but omitted lemon pepper and put in 2 tsp lemon juice and freshly grated black pepper.  I also added 1/2 dijon and 1/2 yellow mustard. Loved both of them I just found the lemon juice less pronounced and the dijon added a little kick.  I will say that I thought how much would a "dash" of pepper sauce show up and i will tell you it works and you only need a dash! Will definetly make again

I found this to be a wonderful recipe to perk up grilled corn, although while making it some family members thought it tasted a too much like mustard so I doubled everything except the mustard it was "DELICIOUS" and everyone was happy!

This is "the" way to make grilled corn. The only change I make is to leave out the worcestershire sauce and I use Ms Dash lemon pepper. I make these whenever I grill and have always had many compliments.

Zesty grilled corn...very descriptive (and TASTY!)!  This was good, good, good.  Though with the amount of ingredients, I brushed it on double the recommended amount of ears before wrapping in foil and we thought the taste was just right.  Subtle, juicy...zesty.  :o)  Why have plain corn?  Maybe next time I'll try it with fewer ears to see if the flavor is stronger.

Good, but not fantastic.  The term prepared mustard leans toward yellow mustard.  Dijon is much better.  "Prepared" as an ingredient name is too generic.

Needed fresh ground pepper, and a little fresh chopped parsley to improve the flavor.

I thought this recipe was just O.K.  I was really expecting more flavor with the interesting mix of ingredients, but overall was a little bland.  You could taste the mustard, which I thought was pretty weird with the corn.  Being wrapped in the foil, it didn't have a grilled flavor.  Might be better brushed with the mixture and placed directly on the grill.

This was good but I definetly think it will be better if you reserve some of the mixture to put on corn after it is done.  I intend to try it that way next time.  Hubby liked it and he is a very finicky eater.  It's a keeper.

This is a great recipe, particularly as a quickly-assembled side dish when you're already cooking out. And although the ingredients sound really spicy, it cooks up only mildly so, so even my young children loved it!

Very good! Tip: make more of the sauce if you are using larger ears of corn. My family loved this. It's tangy, sweet and refreshingly different from plain butter on corn.

My family liked this corn on the cobb. A change of pace from the normal grilled corn. Loved the zip from the horseradish.
Thanks for sharing.

Honestly, I trust most things on this site that have anything higher than a 4 star but with this recipe i followed it exactly and it was just " alright" nothin to spectaculart a nice subtle flavor. It wasnt BOOMING with flavor or anything like that.

My husband and I love this!

He's not a fan of corn, but always gets happy when this appears!  Make sure that you make enough of the butter/mustard mixture.  I'm not sure that the amounts stretch far enough for the ears of corn this recipe requires.  I use the allotted amounts for 3-4 ears.

I changed this slightly by mashing the ingrediants into the butter then adding a few dollops of the butter mixture in each foil parcel. The flavours were only subtle but it's a great way of cooking corn on the BBQ. Thanks for the recipe.

The corn burned on one side and I didn't think the flavors melded together all that well.  Not gross, but probably won't make again.

I did not like this recipe  I could not really taste the zestiness of the corn and ended up just putting butter on it and eating it that way.

While this is quick and easy, I hoped for a more zippy flavor. I thought the horseradish would really add some kick, but it seemed a little flat to me.  Add something more for zip if you're into spicier foods.

The bitter sauce tasted wonderful but it fell off the corn. Not sure how to correct the problem because it must at least touch the foil where it sits.

This recipe was delicious.  I used my own homemade stone ground mustard which had enough horse-radishy kick to it (from the mustard seeds) to satisfy the need for pseudo heat I was looking for.  I did try a few corn ears with different spices:  Cayenne, dried Cilantro, and Smoked Sea Salt.   Each was great in its own right.   Looking forward to trying more spice combinations.

My favorite topping for grilled corn is butter with garlic and basil.  After trying this recipe, that still remains the case for me, but Miss Bettie's recipe won the "favorite topping" for my husband.   I made the recipe as written, except that we grilled the corn in the husks, then shucked it, and brushed on the butter.  Next time I will reduce the amount of mustard, and try Dijon style mustard rather than yellow mustard.  I really like the idea of horseradish, but couldn't tell it was there - only mustard.

I didn't do this on the grill and that was probably what was missing.  My fault.  Either way though, I will decrease mustard a little and add more horseradish because I like more bite than tang.  I liked this recipe and I think it will be great if I DO IT RIGHT!

This recipe helped keep the corn moist but I didn't really taste much of it on my ear. I will probably make it again to see if I just need to put more on each ear.

I love this corn! The only thing I did different was I put everything but the butter on the corn and then grilled it. It kinda gets soggy if you put the butter on first. After it comes off the grill is when I put the butter on if it seems to need it. Love it!!!!!
