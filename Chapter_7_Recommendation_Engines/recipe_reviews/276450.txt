I used fresh garlic and added chopped onion., and because my husband and I are avoiding sodium, omitted that. Absolutely delicious! 
I made 3 recipes to freeze so we have something to grab for lunches at work. This is definitely a keeper!

Easy to make and pretty tasty. The feta adds much needed flavor to turkey, which tends to be bland.  Instead of the mini-muffins, I did them in a 12-muffin tin with silicon liners. No need to shape them into meatballs -- just plop a scoop's worth in. Note that the servings given is 24, so the servings and nutritional information are based on a single mini-meatball, which is hardly realistic for a meal. We found 3 of these were just about right -- and 2 of the 3 of us had seconds. Next time I'll play with a sauce to add interest and additional flavor.
