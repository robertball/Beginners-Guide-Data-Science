I have to say that my family was very impressed with this recipe.  I substituted lobster for crab.
The directions were clear, and well written.  The sauce was rich and thick, and very flavorful. Being an experienced cook, it was obvious to me that you would not pour all the seafood cooking liquid into the vegetable mixture, but add only a little at a time, as stated, until desired thickness was reached. I will be filing this with my "keeper" recipes and certainly will share this one with my friends.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very tasty, even better the second day.  Make sure you add the seafood broth very sparingly and a little at a time. You'll probably only use 1/2 to 3/4 cup of the broth.

This recipe was not as I expected.  The recipe is unclear on how much seafood broth to add, so I'm pretty sure I added too much.  It was more like a thin soup and took alot of flour to thicken it.  I also found this recipe to be very bland.  I had to add alot of salt, pepper, and garlic to help it out.  I also added a little cayene pepper to it.  That seemed to help.  I don't believe I'll be making this recipe again, however I do encourage others to try it out.

I must agree that the directions are not very well written.  How can one add a liquid "to desired thickness" when another 2 cups of liquid (milk) have yet to be added?  I simply waited until after I'd added everything else before deciding about the broth, and in the end added none as it seemed unnecessary altogether.  But what *should* be a fairly easy recipe should not be restricted to "experienced cooks" in order to follow it.  And despite all that, I just didn't think it was all that good.

I made some minor changes: used Trader Joe's frozen seafood blend (scallops, shrimp, squid) in place of all seafood.  Used fresh herbs (basil, tarragon, and parsley), no green pepper, and used hazelnut rather than dairy milk because it's what I had on hand.  Suddenly had to leave right as it was done, and came back to cold pasta... and it was so delicious!  I will totally make this again, and maybe even follow the recipe closer next time. ;)

Four of us enjoyed this meal, but as others mentioned, directions not perfect. (Never mentioned to add shrimp etc.) Used barely 1/2 cup broth and not all the milk.  Was tasty with the suggested additions of Old Bay seasoning and a bit of Cayenne. Topped it with freshly grated cheese. Delicious!

I’ve made this several times with just shrimp and scallops.  I have made it exactly as written and then made my own changes to my likes.  I do not boil the shrimp and scallops any longer.  I just sauté them in some butter.  I also play around with the seasonings.  Add a tsp of old bay seasoning!  Delicious.  I also add some drained fire roasted tomatoes to it as well.  This was a beautiful base recipe that leaves many options open for your desired tastes.  Fantastic recipe!

Fairly light for what it is - add some parmesan cheese at the end, and its perfect.

I decided to brown my scallops  and shrimp in butter over boiling them but that was the only change I made. The broth is not necessary in this recipe so leave it out altogether. I typically struggle with cream sauces but this recipe worked perfectly for me. The measurements were spot on and thickened up nicely without getting too thick. I did think the end dish lacked a little in flavor so I recommend making your pinches fairly big pinches.
