Fantastic appetizer to a 4th of July grilled steak dinner.  The only thing that I changed was adding a bit of salt, nothing else.  After tasting the tomato mixture, I almost added more red wine vinegar.  Glad I didn't, because the balsamic drizzle brought just the perfect balance of acidity to this bruschetta.  Thoroughly enjoyed, thanks for sharing!  And it really is "light and fresh."

Such a delicious, and refreshing recipe! I found the combination of flavors spot on for me. The only change I made was served this on my own homemade basil pesto crostinis. Thank you, it's a keeper!

I have made this and yes I would add a little salt. I found this to be the best recipe. I did sprinkle a little parm cheese after I put it on the bread.

I added fresh grated parmesan and topped it with mozzarella, then I broiled it for a few minutes. It became an instant hit with everyone. Without a doubt one of the best bruschettas I've had.

Instead of grilling the bread under the broiler, I grilled it lightly on the barbecue.  I also drizzled balsamic reduction over the top right before serving.  Delicious!!!

Very tasty. I was out of balsamic vinegar, so I had to skip that.  
I added a dash of garlic powder for a little extra garlic flavor.
