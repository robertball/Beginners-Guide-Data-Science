This was exceptionally good!  I used cubed steak and followed the recipe almost as is, which is unusual for me!  The crust was soooo good!  I used Krusteaz Bake and Fry Coating Mix with the flour, mixing the two together, since I didn't read the instructions!  It worked just fine. The meat was very tender.  It got raves from my husband. 
It is a keeper.

This is a good base recipe but it needs some refinement. I used cube steak and kept everything else the same. The lack of more stars comes from the fact that the crust falls off of it. Being from Texas that is a cardinal sin of chicken fried steak. Next time I will see what changes can be made to make this recipe better.

We thought this was awesome! We don't eat a lot of red meat and very little in the way of fried foods, but oh my gosh---yum! I used a pre-tenderized cube steak, and probably less oil then called for in the recipe. Time was short, so I also cheated and used Williams Country Gravy packet mix. (If you've never used it---it's better than most homemade country gravies!) I just made it in the pan I cooked the steaks, so got all the browned bits and little bit of grease left in the pan into the gravy. Served it w/mashed potatoes and ceasar salad. Triple yum. My 10 yr. old asked why we've never had this before! I'm going to have to double my work out tomorrow.....

Today was the first time I have ever made homemade Chicken fried Steak and this was a good base recipe. I'm giving it 2 stars because I had to alter the breading and I didn't use the gravy. My husband and I love food that has a lot of flavor so I used Italian style bread crumbs and added Cayenne pepper, Garlic Salt, Oinion powder and a pinch or 2 of Kosher Salt. I used a gravey that I found on this site - "Bill's Sausage Gravy" (I only used a little of the sausage in the actually gravy because I didn't want the sausage to overpower the Chicken fried Steak.  This was Delicious!!!  My husband didn't even sit down - he stood right by the stove and ate it up!!!  If your a flavor person - You'll like these suggestions.

I've used this recipe numerous times. I don't personally like the gravy but I use McCormick's white gravy packet. The chicken fried steak is excellent!! My husband LOVES it! I'm going to make it for my mom tonight so lets see how she likes it.

Really good...I pounded the steaks and sprinkled with tenderizer before following the recipe and it was perfect!  Great with garlic mashed potatoes and the creamy gravy.  YUM!

This was injoyable. I have never eaten or made chicken fried steak before, and this was a very good first timer. Very easy to follow. My husband who loves CFS said that this was a very good recipe, he loved the gravy. Thank you so much.

My boyfriend liked it. I wasn't too fond of it, but it was my first time ever making chicken fried steak. Next time I'm going to try olive oil, and I'm going to add seasonings to the flour. I used Italian bread crumbs but it was still lacking flavor an you could taste the oil in the meat thus going to try the olive oil. Wasn't much drippings left for the gravy so I threw in about 1/4 cup beef broth and also added garlic and onion powder, pepper, parsley and seasoned salt. Gravy was good.

Oh my goodness. This is the best chicken fried steak. EVER. I make this every month and still love it. But I love my country gravy nice and hot/spicy/pepper-y, so add in like, a WHOPPING  1 & 1/2 teaspoons or more of the white pepper. It's AMAZING.

Kind of bland. Used thin steak milanesa style and coated it with egg first than dip in flour than dip in egg than dip in breadcrumbs. This helped the coating stick together, but it felt lengthy! Still enjoyable :)

This was such an easy recipe! I was surprised at how quickly I was able to make it.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I used cornmeal along with flour for the breading which gave it a yummy crunch.  My husband and 3 year old loved it!  Salt and pepper are definitely your friend on this one though...don't skimp on these ingredients at all! I will definitely make it again.

This was pretty good - I just made a few minor changes.  We only had bone in steak, so I just used what we had.  Fried it in a mix of EVOO & vegetable oil.  For the gravy, I needed a lot more flour, I'm not sure how much I used but I kept adding til it was thick.  I also just used regular ground pepper.

My husband really loves this recipe. I season a little differently by crushing up French's deep fried onions and adding to the flour/bread crumb mixture and I lightly season the steak with a specialty seasoning salt prior to dipping in egg and crumbs. I liked that the coating adheres very well to the meat. With some other recipes I've tried, the coating would fall off while turning the steak but I've not had that problem with this recipe and I've made it now at least 5 times.

Very yummy, my husband and I loved it. The sauce needs a little extra love to it, so I add a little more pepper and paprika and it's awesome.

great! I use Krusteaz Bake & Fry Coating Mix instead of bread crumbs. I also use McCormick's Sausage Country Gravy...because I know I like it and it's quicker/easier. one additional step I do is to LIGHTLY salt the meat before I tenderize it. just seems to bring out the flavor a little more.

Excellent Recipe.  Meat came out crispy and tender.  Gravy was creamy and flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a bit more oil because my pan is exceptionally large.  This one's a keeper!

The steak was nice and crispy but had very little flavor.  I will make again but with more seasonings.

This was my first time making chicken fried steak.  The country gravy was really not what I expected.  My husband who is the least picky eater ever couldn't handle the 'milky-flour' sauce.  I am not sure if that is what normal country gravy is but I would recommend trying this with a different sauce.

What a great recipe!  I've never made chicken fried steak before, so it was a learning experience.  I kept the meat in the fridge after dredging, so it would form a good crisp crust and I tried to keep the oil hot.  These were really good, even though the crust didn't get real crispy (which I'm sure was my fault).  I definately will be trying this again!

This was delicious! Doubled the recipe and family gobbled it all up.  Used cubed steak but still pounded it otherwise didn't change a thing. Made with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Will make again. Thanks for sharing.

I think this recipe is great! I loved the way the crust crumbled. I did prefer to use the sirloin instead of the cube steak though. It's much more tender.

Very yummy!! My husband liked it, and he never likes  chicken fried steak. I used sirloin steak, but, like other reviews, I added some extra seasonings into the flour and used panko breadcrumbs. Will definately make this again!

Fabulous base recipe! This was a little bland for us, but the recipe is great and easy to modify to suit our personal tastes. I mixed the flour and the bread crumbs together. The next time I will add some garlic and lots of fresh ground black pepper. My family loves CFS and this meal made everyone happy. Thanks!

I loved every bite of this recipe!! I made a few changes: using Cube Steak which I did pound down, and it was just a little chewy...but still good!! I also used 1/2 skim milk and 1/2 heavy cream to equal 1 1/4 called for, to give that gravy more flavor...and it did, very delicious.

This was great!  We used venison chops and they turned out very tender.  Since the chops are small, it  made quite a few.  I kept the ones I had already cooked warm in a 200 degree oven until I was done.  This one is a keeper for us, and is going into the recipe box.

Classic and delicious. Watch your frying temp or the breading will burn. Change the oil frequently for best results, and always let the oil get up to temp before adding the breaded meat.

This recipe was easy and tasty.  I had to add a lot more milk as I was making the gravy, it tasted too floury.  My dad said it turns out better if you use an iron skillet instead of a non-stick pan.  I will try it again and see how it goes.

Overall this was a yummy dinner, but I have yet to master the art of pan frying bredded things and have them come out nice and crunchy; the breading always goes soggy.  I added some sausage to the gravy and added extra milk and a few shakes of freshly ground black pepper and the gravy was delicious.

I tried this recipe and it did not come out the way it was supposed to. I followed the directions on the recipe. But it did taste good.

I was disappointed in the breading.  It wasn't nearly as thick or crunchy as I thought it would be.  I won't cook this again.

I didn't eat this, but I'll review it based on my boyfriends raves about it. I made the recipe as written, the only thing that I changed was using black pepper instead of white (all I had) and adding garlic powder to the gravy while cooking. The steak was so easy to fry. I coated it and let it sit in the fridge for about an hour before cooking. The coating stayed on perfectly, it really looked amazing. I'm usually a disaster when it comes to frying anything, so this was a huge deal. The gravy was easy to make as well. "This is REALLY good chicken fried steak. I had no idea you could cook like this!" End quote. I will make this again and again. Thanks Judy!!

Meat turned out very tasty,  not too sure about the gravy. I followed the recipe for the gravy but we didn't like it.  I will make the meat again but will use a different gravy mix.

I've never made this before, and it was good, like others said the gravy is very bland, after adding a touch of butter and lots of salt, pepper, and garlic powder, it was yummy!  I made biscuits, and they were so good dipped in the gravy!

For my first time cooking country fried steak, it was great.  Easy to follow directions and the ingredients are fantastic. I did add just a bit of spice to it by using paprika in the flower mix.

It was pretty good.  The recipe makes a lot of gravy.  The gravy was kind of bland so I added some chicken bouillon.

This is the first time I've used bread crumbs for chicken fried steak and it was pretty good.  The recipe doesn't turn out a final result much different than other fried chicken recipes I've tried from allrecipes.  The gravy seemed to have a little too much white pepper.  It had too much of a bite.

It was wonderful! My mother and a friend of ours have made it a few times now and it's always a big hit!
