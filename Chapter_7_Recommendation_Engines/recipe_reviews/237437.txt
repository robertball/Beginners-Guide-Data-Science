Well, we didn't take them to the riverbank, but we did take them to the screened porch, and they disappeared quickly!  Pretty mellow, and I did miss a little bit of triple sec, so I may add that in the future.  It well could be the flavor is somewhat dependent on the type of Mexican beer that you use (I used Tecate).  This is just so easy to remember that even my pea brain can handle it:  equal parts of tequila, lemon-lime soda, Mexican beer, and lime concentrate.  Thanks, Rob G, this was a nice cocktail before a hot Saturday evening dinner!
