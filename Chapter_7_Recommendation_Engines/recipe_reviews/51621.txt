I absolutely love tuna melts and this one was terrific! The peppers and capers gave this old favorite a new twist. I served it for lunch to my family this weekend, open-faced and used packaged shredded cheddar on top.

My boyfriend and I were really disappointed in this recipe. I would have been better off experimenting with my own recipe.  There was too much mayo and the only thing you could taste were the jalapenos.
