This cake was pretty good! I couldn't find potato flour at my grocery store and I wasn't making it for Passover so I used white flour.  The recipe says to bake for an hour, but I think that is too long (at least it is too long if using white flour).  The cake was a bit overdone at 50 minutes when I took it out.

Went over great.  I made a mistake with the sugar and used a 1/2 measure when I thought it was a 1/3 measure.  I ended up using 2 cups of sugar instead of 1 1/3 cup.  Cake came out great.  Also served pureed raspberries, fresh raspberries and whipped cream

Use granulated sugar. I believe confectioners sugar has cornstarch in it which is not suitable for Passover. Karen from LI
