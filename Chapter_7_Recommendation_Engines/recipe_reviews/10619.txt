I made a variation of this over the holidays- basically I omitted the raisins because I forgot them on my shopping list. They came out wonderfully anyway. To add a touch more sweetness, without overdoing it, I put a simple sugar glaze on the top of each cookie. They came out quite nicely.

If you like hermits, you will like this recipe.  It has wonderful flavor and is not too sweet.  I found this did not slice like regular refrigerated cookie dough.  To make a neater cookie, I cut it 3/8 inch but then rolled it in a ball and flattened it with my fingers on the cookie sheet.  They made a better appearance that way.
