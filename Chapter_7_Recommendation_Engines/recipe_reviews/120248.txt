Great Flavor!! I only altered this recipe a bit.  I had no cream of celery soup so i ended up putting celery in with the onions and green peppers and used cream of mushroom soup instead where i was out of fresh or jarred mushrooms.  I also added a little bit of extra shredded cheddar into the casserole and baked.  Just before taking it out i added a bit more shredded cheese to the top and a little bit of crushed up potato chips.  Turned out wonderful.  The family loved it and will be making this again during the cold months.  Quick, simple and easy to do and i can spend more time with the family. BTW, friends stopped in the night i made this and were pleasantly surprised  that it tasted so good.  Neither of them liked reg. tuna casserole and it shocked them after taking a taste they sat down and had a nice plate of it along with a green salad and a fruit cobbler for dessert.

Fantastic recipe!  Made as written except left out the mushrooms.  Even the kiddos ate this one.

Good stuff. Perfect for a really quick, cheap, yet filling meal. I omitted the onions, added a clove of garlic instead. I was out of green pepper, so I threw in some frozen peas for color. I also crushed up some Club crackers and topped the dish with them before baking. Thank you for the quick meal :)

I just loved this casserole!! I'm not fond of green peppers, and I didn't have any mushrooms on hand so I reduced the water a bit and added a 1/4 cup of mild giardinera.

It was out of this world and extremely easy to make!!

I've never made or tasted tuna casserole before, but I decided to make this and share it with my coworkers. Everyone complimented me on how great it tasted. I thought it tasted good, but not great. I followed the recipe exactly, with one MINOR exception, I forgot to buy the green bell peppers! It still turned out good.

This is really really good. I've been looking for a recipe that was different from Chicken Noodle version and this is the one I am hanging on to. I think this could easily be made with a canned ham as well!

I have been making this for a few years now and I think it's very kid friendly. My husband and I like it too. Although I prefer my original recipe that doesn't call for mac and cheese. It's very easy and I usually have the ingredients on hand to make it at anytime. If you have young children It may be a good one to try. Doesn't every kid like mac and cheese?! Thanks for sharing.

Added french fried onions to the top and it tasted great. Next time I am going add them to noodles too.
