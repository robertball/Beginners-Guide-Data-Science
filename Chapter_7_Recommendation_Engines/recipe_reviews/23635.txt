I like to make this using Texas toast, a thicker piece of white bread. Up the vanilla just a tad and sprinkled some sugar in the mix before dipping the bread.

I haven't had French toast since I was a kid and I'd never thought of having it sweet. This was really nice - not too sweet or rich. I made it with bacon and maple syrup on top for a Valentine's breakfast and my boyfriend loved it!

Simple easy recipe.  The flavor is nothing out of the ordinary, but it gets an extra star because the small size is great for little ones as well as fun and easy.  I didn't really make any changes to the recipe other than to use wheat bread rather than white.

Great recipe that's fun to do with kids!  I used a pizza cutter to cut the bread and added some sugar to the egg/milk mixture along with a little nutmeg for good measure.  Once they were done I topped them off with some confectioners' sugar and real maple syrup.  There's nothing like really good french toast and orange juice to start your morning.....

YUM. I love french toast. This recipe was very good, I love the concept of french toast "corners". I won't ever make it differently. No children in our household but the adults liked it too! I found that the batter wasn't enough for 6 pieces of the bread I used. I added another egg and some milk towards the end because I ran out. However it could have been the excessively large pieces of bread I was using. Also I didn't use white bread. I used a 7 grain bread. We don't eat white bread in our family, but it was fabulous. Served it up with a side of bacon. w00

Made this for my husband and it was a hit! I cut the french toast after cooking it in diagonals using a pizza a cutter.  Very quick & easy recipe that I'll use again.

Ever since my trip to Jamaica, I've wanted French Toast.  This recipe is the closest to what I had there with one exception - I use the thick cut bread like they do in Jamaica.  The bread gets less soggy and is easier to handle. This recipe is perfect in that there is no sugar added and only uses a few ingredients.  I through everything in the blender and use a shallow dish for the bread.  I've even mastered flipping the toast so I don't need any utensils.

Loved the taste, was a bit "fiddly" Next time would probably just cut in half instead of quarters.

I have made this a bunch of times; it's definitely become my standard French toast recipe.  However, I did discover the first time I made it that mixing the cinnamon in with the wet ingredients does not allow it to really be distributed very well, so I just sprinkle it on after dipping.  Also, I've lately been making this with croissants instead of bread, and that's excellent too.

I just made this for my husband and followed the directions.  You really can use any bread you like, just remember to use a hot non-stick skillet with a tablespoon of butter.  Mine did not come out soggy at all.  I did heat 100% maple syrup in the microwave and did sprinkle the french toast with powdered sugar.  My husband loved this.

We really like this recipe; however, I sprinkle cinamon directly on the bread after it has been dipped.  When you mix it in with everything else, it doesn't mix well and all of it goes on the first piece of bread.

My kids seem to be on a French Toast kick lately. I took JDVMB's suggestion and used texas toast, as I've been told by my kids that's really the only way french toast should be made. The egg wash was spot on. This was just enough for my boys--they ate every bite of this. I served this with extra butter and homemade maple-vanilla syrup for "dipping".

Pretty generic french toast but hit the spot!  I'd use a little less vanilla extract.  I actually made it the super healthy way with egg beaters, skim milk, multigrain bread and splenda and it tasted great!

Nice breakfast! This is a little more work than cutting them up after cooking, which I was tempted to do, but they turned out so pretty and all the ends were battered and I liked the end result so it was worth the extra little effort. I used quite a bit more butter than called for.

Great flavor but the middles were complete mush. Maybe too much milk? I don't know. Texas toast would probably be a better choice, I just used reg white bread.

Can you say DELICIOUS? Wow, this dish was so good & delicious. My 5-year old daughter helped me make breakfast this morning--I think it's great for the kids to help out in the kitchen because it's such a simple recipe. I will definitely make this again & again!

I liked the recipe very much. Just done eating my French Toast after a sudden craving and wanted it fast and easy. I cut the slices thicker than storecut bread so it didn't get to soggy and it tasted sooo good. Mine came out perfect.   Didn't use cinnamon of personal preferences other than that I did not change a thing and am very satisfied. Defently a keeper !!!

Very good-the whole family liked it-I made some with Texas toast and some with cinnamon raisin bread-both were delish. I only did about 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.

I used frozen Texas Toast for the bread in this recipe.   I just stacked the bread to cut the triangles.  I also cooked from the frozen state on the griddle.  After eating all that we could I laid the leftovers on a waxed paper covered cookie sheet and froze.  Once froze I just put them back in the bread sack.  
For a quick breakfast, pop in the toasted or reheat in the microwave.  Delicious breakfast.

I use raisin-cinnamon bread, and sometimes put cream cheese between two slices.  I mix pancake syrup with pecans and pour on top (after fried) and add a fancy swirl of whipped topping.   Mmmmm!!! A little goes a long way because it's very rich.

This is the simple recipe I was looking for to make quick french toast. Even better i never thought of cutting it up before hand as I don't like to get sticky. I did add a bit of triple sec orange liqueur but the end result was the same.

This was perfect for the occasion. Two seven year old girls wanting breakfast. They had these dry sharing a side of syrup to dip these in. It was quick and painless.

recipe was good but do you people actually cut the bread in 4 pieces and then dip it and cook it or are some of you smart enough to cook it like normal and then serve it cut fancy, you can even make tiny squares like I do after its cooked already.

Great!  For one person, I halved it and still had leftovers.  Make sure to press down a little during cooking, otherwise it burns before it ever cooks thoroughly.  Good and tasty!  Triangles are perfect for kids or small hands (like mine).

very easy and quick to make! Perfect for a weekend breakfast without the hassle. I used normal white bread (like wonder bread) and had no problems. I don't think it's worth using a thicker bread unless you happen to have it on hand (meaning, I wouldn't run to the store to get it).

This is one of the best French Toast recipes I have found.  Instead of making "corners", just use regular bread, and I doubled the recipe.  If anyone bakes homemade bread that makes the BEST French Toast ever.  Sourdough bread also has great flavor.

I knew how I was making French toast before was pretty bland, and this was the first recipe that seemed perfect! My vanilla must have disappeared though, so I made do with almond extract. It still gave the batter a great, sweet flavor! This will be the recipe I follow from now on!

Use thick bread, it will keep it from getting to soggy and tasting like mush.  I added an extra 1/4 tsp of cinnamon for our taste, 1/2 teaspon of nutmeg (great addition) and 1 1/2 tablespoons of brown sugar. Make sure u only cut bread in half, when cut in quarters was way to soggy. I melted some peach and strawberry perserves in a pan with butter and poured over the top, tasted wonderful...

it really depends on the size of the bread and absorbency in which you are using. 2 eggs is definitely not enough, didn't taste so great either.

Great flavor!  Cutting into corners gives lots of room for creativity when decorating the plate.  I used a melon scoop for butter, smothered them in syrup and sprinkled powdered sugar and cinnamon on top.  Perfect for breakfast in bed....with tray of course :)

This was great!  My two boys (6 and 3) couldn't get enough.  They loved the small size - perfect for dipping.  I did add a little more cinnamon than the 1/2 teaspoon.  Will definitely make this again!

Very quick and simple to make. I actually just cut it in half since regular white bread is so thin. And I increased the amount of cinnamon. Great with powdered sugar.

I used a whole grain cinnamon raisin bread and egg beaters to make it more healthy and we LOVED it. Topped with sugar free syrup and turkey sausage on the side it is one of my favorite low cal breakfasts! Or use the fully loaded ingredients for a real treat!

I needed 3 eggs for 6 pieces of toast and that was a stretch.  Making toast points was a nice twist on French toast though.

Well...I've made French Toast before and this IS a pretty basic recipe BUT I've never thought to cut the bread into triangles before frying.  It makes coating the individual pieces easier and is just kind of a fun idea!

I made these this morning and the hubby loved it.

Cutting them into little triangles was a great idea because I put all the ingredients in one of those glass Pyrex measuring cups and the pieces fit right in for dipping and right onto the griddle.  There was no awkwardness I used to have with the one piece of sliced bread and all the dripping.  Why didn't I think of that?

I served them with a little powdered sugar sprinkled on top.

Next time I will try to remember to get fatter bread for even better French toast!

Thanks for the idea!

This was delicious! I used honey wheat bread and half-and-half instead of milk. Also, I used kitchen shears to cut the bread into triangles (easier than a knife). My mom said that 'this should be how we make French toast for the rest of our lives!' I think since you soak the corners in the egg mixture, it coats better - making each bite super tasty.

AWESOME!! Quick and easy and extremely delicious! I made a few adjustments to the standard recipe and I highly recommend them to anyone who may want that extra little "bam". To the standard recipe, I added a little squeeze of honey to the egg mixture, and a bit of nutmeg (eyeball measure). I also highly recommend using "texas toast" (each slice cut in halves only- not quarters as suggested in the original recipe). Thick slices of bread holds together better and doesn't fall apart like regular bread will. Right before serving, drizzle a bit more honey (pancake syrup is an excellent choice also) across the bread, along with some powdered sugar and (optional) your favorite topping (chopped pecans, dates, preserves, sliced bananas, or anything else your imagination can think of. Guaranteed to have everyone screaming for more!! Bon Appetit!

It was great! Only thing was it didn't cook  all the way through, but I think that was because I sliced the bread too thick.

This was an easy FT recipe. Mine would have been better had I not tried to put so many in the pan at once! :) Still yummy though. Instead of maple syrup, I recreated a lemon curd recipe that I had at a B&B and used that as the topping. I will be fixing this again.

Today is my son's third birthday, so we made breakfast together.  We decided to make this, and it was very good.  I love how you cut the bread first.  I am only giving it 4 stars because I cut the recipe in half, and didn't have enough egg batter to dip 3 pieces of bread.  I was better off keeping the batter as is, and just cutting down on the bread.  Thank you for sharing, the flavor was great and Mikey loved helping his Mommy make his birthday breakfast.

Absolutely the best French toast I have ever had.  I use the authentic vanilla from Mexico, it is better then what you buy at the store.  So if you can get your hands on that use that in place of the regular vanilla.  Other then that it is perfect.

It wasn’t sweet at all! I do not like super sweet things but I added a little sugar in the mix, and syrup, and put powdered sugar on top...it still didn’t do the trick. It was missing something and I don’t know what it is.

I add one tablespoon of real maple syrup. I also let the bread sit out overnight to get a little stale. It absorbs the batter way better! Challah bread is great to use too.

The egg mixture was the perfect ratio for me, and I liked that it didn't have added sugar. The little corners are a nice way to serve this, but I thought it was a bit difficult to cook them this way. I think making it normal size and just cutting after cooking would be sufficient, as I didn't see any real advantage to cutting them first.

I had some "stale, generic, toward the end of the loaf" white  bread and decided to make this as a Valentine treat, using heart  shaped cookie cutters. Turned out good. I can only imagine how good it would be with thicker bread.

This was a very easy recipe, my kids loved it for breakfast. I would suggest adding powdered sugar, and to use texas bread if you are going to cut them into far, normal bread will be very small servings.

Made this on a snowy day when I had my kids as well as some of their friends here for breakfast.  I doubled the recipe to make sure I had enough for six teenagers.  I had a couple of yolks in the refrigerator so I tossed them in as well.  They ate every bite and asked for more.  Two days later, my son asked me to make it again for dinner.  I think this recipe is a hit.

I tried this recipe as is for my family on two occasions, and they loved it both times. I think it would be a little better with thicker bread, but it is not a neccessity.

Just made these quickly for my 12 yr old with some bread I was about to pitch (a little dried out). I cut into strips instead of triangles. He ate some plain with sprinkled sugar & dipped some in syrup. He gives it A+! Great for an ez quick make-a-kid-happy snack! Thnx!

I had never made french toast before and this was really easy to make. I think next time I will add some more spices. It was delicious!

I tested this version on one slice first and found it to be a tad bland.  So, I added a bit more vanilla extract as well as a little salt and white sugar.  The family loved it!  Otherwise, a good recipe :)

These were the best French toast I've yet to make. I love the idea of triangles & so did my family. I had some leftover applesause & added it to the egg mixture, about 2 tablespoons & also had some cinnamon sugar left from another recipe and used it to sprinkle on top. I will make these again, thanks

NO FLAVOR!  I was excited to try this recipe because it seemed simple and easy enough to have my 6 year old daughter help.  However the ending result was not good at all. Will not try this version again unless I can spice it up a bit.

I don't much care for cinnamon, so I added about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar instead.  These got high praise, and my mother even said it was the best french toast she's ever had!

Very good recipe.  I like the little triangles.  It visually looks like a lot!  Very tasty too.  I added powdered sugar and strawberries.  The vanilla extract was a must too.

Good recipe.  The little triangles are a great concept, although make it way too easy to eat more than your share!  I added a dash of powdered sugar to them as they cooled on the plate and it gave it just the extra needed taste.  Also, the amounts provided worked for only four pieces of bread.  Definitely worth trying again.

We weren't really crazy about this. First, the butter ended up burning my pan by the end of the batch, we probably should have used pam from the start. And the taste was just average, nothing special. I added some sugar to the mix, but still was kind of bland in my opinion. I don't like a lot of syrup, but to give these taste I had to load it on. I'll try something else next time, sorry!

Pretty good French toast. Simple to make, and thought it came out pretty good. I did use wheat bread instead of white. Taste great with maple breakfast sausage. I will be making this again, but next time I will be sure to put powdered sugar and maybe some fresh cut strawberries.

This was very tasty, simple to make and includes ingredients that you're sure to have on hand. Although, I was missing extract and cinnamon--I substituted apple pie spice and just left out the extract. All I had on hand was whole wheat, but it worked. Next time I'll try some real THICK sourdough!

I didn't cut them into corners just in half and used whole wheat bread and no butter.  The taste was great in my opinion but I had a problem with the middles of the bread still being soggy, even tried cooking on medium instead of medium-high.  Maybe to cook properly they needed to be those small corners, I don't know but it was still goo!

I used a wheat nut bread and it was awesome! However, the liquid only made enough for 4 pieces of bread. Goes well with turkey sausage.

The first time I made french toast I followed another recipe and they were soggy and I didn't like them. With this recipe however they turned out perfect, will definitely keep this!

These are wonderful.  Just what french toast should be.  I didn't use any butter though - I used a non stick pan.  Served with maple syrup, fresh bluberries and sliced bananas.  A delicious Sunday morning breakfast.  
My tip for French Toast - make sure you use bread that is atleast one day old.  If you use fresh bread it tends to make for a pretty soggy french toast.

Pretty good, but I think next time I would add more cinnamon.  I made this with Rum Raisin Bread from this site.  There was only enough egg mixture for 4 slices, but bread machine slices are larger.
