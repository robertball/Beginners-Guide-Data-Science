This is a good dish, although this recipe asks for way too much hot sauce. Your mouth will be on fire to the point where you can not enjoy it because you're busy blowing your nose . I also feel it asks for too much ketchup. If the directions are followed exactly, you will have an abundance of sauce. Next time I make this I will cut the ketchup and hot sauce by half.

I wanted heat, but I also wanted flavor so I used sweet chili sauce in place of ketchup and Sriarcha in place of hot sauce.  I started with half a cup of chili sauce and added the Sriracha to taste.  This will be made again often.  Thank you, Johanes.

There is really no need to add any additional salt as there is plenty of salt in the hot pepper sauce. Drinking milk will help with the heat. I thought it was very good

Delish and SUPER easy.  I saut√© onions and mushrooms in the butter, add the ketchup and Tapitio.  Let it simmer all afternoon and then add shrimp.  Totally agree on the hot sauce - 1 cp. ketchup and 1/2 cp Tapitio (we like hot).

READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE making it! I like HOT, but I should have headed the warnings from the posted reviews. It's way toooooo hot. I suggest starting with a 1/4 cup of hot sauce...definitely NOT a whole cup unless you have an extremely high tolerance for spicy. Nevertheless, the dish was very easy to make and in between drinking water, I really loves the dish. It's worth the trial ans error to get it taste spice wise.

It was really spicy and I only used about 1/4 cup of hot Tapatio sauce.
