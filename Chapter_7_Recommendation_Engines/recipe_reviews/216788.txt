I tweaked the recipe a little by adding one diced green pepper, two cloves of diced garlic, and using vegetable broth instead of chicken. I fry mushrooms in butter, place on the pasta and smother it in the sauce.

My husband usually dreads it when I make pasta because the sauce is always so lacking.  THIS he absolutely loved.  He said "You can make this almost every day of the week!"  And I only used beef, no sausage - so next time I'll try using the sausage as well.  Thanks, Lora, it was a big hit!

I followed this  to a "T" and my husband says it is the best sauce he's ever had. Second time I made it I cut way back on the meat and just used Italian Sausage.  It turned out just as good! This freezes great, and now we have it on hand all the time.

This sauce was really delicious! My dad and my husband both said that it was the best sauce that they had ever had. I did make a few adjustments. I didn't use the ground beef (there was plenty of meat between the two types of sausage) I also only used 3 cans of diced tomatoes and I used tomato puree b/c I didn't have any tomato sauce. Oh and I also upped the wine to 1 full cup (it really boosted the flavor). Anyway its a great recipe and it makes a ton , so you're able to freeze it and use later for a quick dinner.

Wow! So delicious! I omitted the ground beef because I didn't need that much sauce. I also added a heaping 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper because my family loves spicy food. So good!

I would make this again; it was easy and very tasty.  I like all the tomato paste used--makes for a nice, thick sauce.  The only note I have is to be aware that it feeds AN ARMY.  I even cut out a pound of meat and used half of the diced tomatoes that the recipe called for!  We will have leftovers AND enough to freeze for another meal.  This was great for company and will feed a crowd, so thanks!

Thought I should show my respects with a review since I have made this meat sauce a coupla-three times now. I follow the recipe as listed. Meaty, homestyle, and as filling as any meatloaf. The wine gives it depth. If you find your sauce tastes a little flat after slow cooking for so long, try a pinch of sugar to smooth the acidity, garlic powder to bring out the savory, or another small can of tomato sauce and a little basil to brighten up the finish. Like all good meat gravies, this sauce is better after it rests overnight in the fridge. The recipe makes tons, and the leftover sauce is ridiculously decadent in lasagna. Much appreciation to the chef who shared this recipe.

The first time I made this I left out the wine (I didn't have any) and didn't use the hot sausage (we don't like spicy food)...well the sauce was really bland and I ended up having to doctor the sauce each time I used what was left over. The second time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome! The wine and hot sausage gave the sauce a ton of flavor without making it spicy. I can't wait to make this using my own tomatoes from the garden!

I've been making the sauce fairly regularly since I first tried it about 6 months ago.  This is my ideal meat sauce.  My 7 year old will ask for it and my somewhat picky 3 year old will eat it too.  I will vary the ratio of sausage to beef, depending on what I have on hand.  I don't use the spicey sausage (due to my kids) but will sometimes use mild.  But its always good no matter what.  Oh, and I do add a tablespoon or two of brown sugar because I can't help myself.  (I like a sweet sauce!)

Wow!  This is an excellent recipe.  My instinct told me to take off the lid of my cooker during the last 1.5 hr to thicken the sauce and that worked out well.  Suggest adding fresh basil after cooking has shut off.I love this red sauce w/meat

Yum - also used it to make lasagne and it got raves from every kid in my neighborhood.  Unlike a lot of other reviewers I added more ground beef as my kids like their sauce meaty, as well as sweet and spicy Italian sausages.  Couldn't find fresh basil but dried was fine.

This is a solid recipe for meat sauce that can be used for baked pasta dishes or just over pasta. I made no changes except to 1/2 the recipe, and used san marzano tomatoes. Three of us ate this, still have @ least 1/2 left to freeze for another meal.

I've never made a truly Italian sauce, usually put my Jewish tilt to a sauce.  But I followed this recipe as written and it was Great.  My son raved and I enjoyed the entire process.

This recipe was definitely 5 star!  It is also a very flexible recipe - I used ground turkey and ground pork, although I did put in the hot Italian sausage.  Also, the tomato products are pretty flexible, too (crushed tomatoes were in my cupboard so used those rather than diced and used Primo Thick and Zesty pasta sauce with onion and herb - also in my cupboard).  I found it needed a wee bit more punch so added 3/4 tsp. chili flakes and a tablespoon of sugar. I made a half recipe and have enough left over for another 4 or 5 servings.  All the women in the group asked for the recipe so you can bet it was better than our "run of the mill" old hat spaghetti sauce recipes.

Excellent taste!  I would suggest using lean ground sirloin and be sure to drain the meat mixture extremely well, as I found that as the sauce cooked, the oils from the meat came out and I ended up skimming fat from the top before serving.  The flavor was delicious.  I served it over rotini pasta.

This recipe is my new favorite spaghetti sauce!  No changes to the recipe ingredients.  However, you'll want a 7-8 quart slow cooker.  It was too much for my 6 quart.

I made this a couple of months ago, following the directions almost exactly. I used only sweet Italian sausage but the tomato sauce I added was a "spicy" kind plus I used fire roasted tomatoes which added enough of a kick for me. I also put in a tiny bit of sugar because I like a little sweetness. It was so delicious and a big hit with my boyfriend. I spent a good 2 hours today trying to find this recipe so I could make it again - so glad I finally came across it!

Wow, simply the best sauce I've ever made. My family loved it. I will be making lasagne tomorrow with the leftover sauce.

Great recipe!!  This makes a TON of sauce and it was delicious. Simple to make and the slow cooker method is error-proof!  We used this for a dinner party and froze the rest to use as lasagna filling later.

Very Good. I think I will use this the next time I'm going to make lasagna. With all the meat in it I will be able to skip a step in the lasagna building process!

very easy to prepare. I added more spices than the recipe called for as I like a deep flavor. The sauce was thick and very tasty. If you like sweeter sauce, add a half grated carrot when cooking.

This fell just short of being 5 stars because I found it needed about twice as much seasoning as the recipe called for - but NOT salt. I strongly recommend tasting towards the end of cooking time and adjusting your seasonings then. I also waited until the end to add the fresh basil.

I've made this sauce many times and it always turns out perfect. I omit the beef because there is more than enough meat with the Italian sausage. I cook mine for up to 12 hours on low.

Excellent recipe!  I only deviated by added two small cans of sliced mushrooms.  Very tasty, and plenty of sauce.  It completely filled our Crockpot to the top.  I split it between two Crockpots, and added five whole, uncooked Italian sausages to each Crockpot to cook throughout the day.  The sausages were very tender, and the meal--served with pasta, salad and garlic bread--was delicious.  Thank you for sharing!

Good flavor, although a little too chunky with tomatoes. I think I'd like it better with crushed rather than diced tomatoes.

Delicious. A few changes:  I skipped the sweet Italian sausage and only used spicy Italian sausage and ground beef. I cut back on the tomato sauce because the slow cooker adds water/moisture. Also added cayenne pepper because my family likes spicy food. Will definitely make this again.

I like to keep the sausage in the casings therefore if you like hot Italian sausage then you can get a link. I typically use crushed and whole tomatoes (if not fresh) and do like to add diced green pepper and sliced mushrooms. I sometimes add sugar if they might be a taste that is more acidic than sweet from the sauce. My family loves a meat spaghetti sauce.

Made this a bunch of times. We don't tend to have red wine so I never add it. I do add a frozen Parmesan cheese rind to simmer in the sauce which adds flavor. I've done this sauce with a variety of meats, but the spicy sausage is a must.  I also don't do it in the slow cooker-I use a dutch oven and slooooooowly simmer all day (which means it has to be cooked on a day I don't leave the house for a while). I did it in the slow cooker twice and each time it never really thickened up.  This is our fave sauce I've tried. Everyone loves it and it tastes even better the next day.

Fantastic, thanks for sharing it. This is such a great place to find recipes. Finding slow cooker recipes for pasta sauce has heretofore proven challenging for me.

I've made this three times now and it is hands down everyone's favorite. Because I'm not a big fan of chunky hot tomatoes, the only thing I do differently is separate the diced tomatoes and blend them using an immersion blender until they are less chunky but still have texture before adding them to the sauce. Other than that, this recipe is perfection. Thank you so much, at last my search for the right meat sauce is over.

Very good! Added three teaspoons of red pepper flakes. Substituted Vodka for the red wine (becuase thats what i had open). Refrigerate it for 8-10 hours, prior to eating, rewarm on the stove.  FYI it makes a lot of sauce. 3-4 dinners worth for a family of 4. Just jar it up and freeze it
