This was a rather tasty cake however you need to turn the cake out on a sugar spinkled towel and roll it up while still hot and let it cool that way. Otherwise you will not be able to roll it and it will break into pieces. The above recipe omits that step completely and it if made as it is written it will end up with a broken cake.

This recipe could be so simple that it's great however the one thing missing from it is a proper baking time. I baked this in my oven which I admit runs hot for 13 minutes. I removed what I thought was a properly baked cake. I let it cool and coated with powdered sugar etc. but when it was time to roll it up I found that the cake split into pieces rather than roll.

I also feel the need to tell anyone attempting this dish to make a bit more cake bather than you feel is needed. the reason is that When I poured the batter into my standard size jelly roll pan, I had just enough to coat the bottom. If I made a bit more perhaps that would have compensated for the bake time. Good luck.

Cake was nice and fluffy, and it rolled well. I ended up mixing my bananas first and then folding with the whipped cream. The cream fell too flat, may have been better to add some cream cheese as well.
