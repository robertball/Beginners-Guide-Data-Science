This was so good!  I just used the crumb topping on top, without the pie crust top - perfect!  It was tart and not too sweet!

I haven't made the full pie, just used the crumb topping recipe and it worked beautifully.  I wanted something crunchy for fresh blackberry concoction that I was making up.  I'll try the pie next!
