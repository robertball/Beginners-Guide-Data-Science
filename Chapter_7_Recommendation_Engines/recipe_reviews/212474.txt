Great recipe, so easy! Coming from a family that knows kugel, I was skeptical, but it turned out awesome. Everyone thought it was just delicious. Prepared the night before - then finished it off w the cheese and baked at 375 for 10 min next day. 

Added 1/2c raisins and 1Tbs cinnamon to liquid mixture, then sprinkled additional cinnamon over the top. Friends/Family are still raving over it - thanks for sharing!

This kugel is so awesome that I'm making it for the third time. It is extremely easy and super delicious. I cut the butter in half and omit the cheddar cheese (I just don't see how it would go well with cheddar cheese). I've added orange marmalade when I didn't have enough apricot preserves and I'm sure that you can substitute apriot preserves for any other preserves.

My in-laws do not like this recipe so I made it just for me and my family.  It is delicious!
