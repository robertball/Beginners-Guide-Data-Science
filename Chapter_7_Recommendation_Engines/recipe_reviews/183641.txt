I'd never heard of Kaiserschmarrn, so I don't think I have a good basis to judge it.  But for those of you who think you might like to try to make it, have plenty of bowls on hand.  My kitchen wasn't quite ready for these!  They're a bit tricky to slide off the pan to flip - my second pancake flipped over gooey side down so it was a little challenging.

I looked online and saw that it's normally served cut up into diamond shapes along side a sauce of some kind.  I think it would taste great with cinnamon and apples or caramelized pecans.  It's very fluffy, light, not as eggy as I expected it to be.  I think it should have cooked a little bit longer but I'm not sure - no frame of reference.  Definitely worth a try if you're looking for a bit of a challenge!

Not too bad.  it would be better to divide the recipe into fourths instead of half to make the cakes.  also could use some fruit sauce.

not too bad but it may be better to make smaller cakes (divide into fourths instead of half).  It would probably be better with some sort of fruit sauce.

Kaiserschmarrn, ...:) its an old Austrian recipe. We love it and I make it for my grandchildren and serve it with cold apple sauce or
stewed plums,which I prefer.
The differnce in the recipe is,that I use soy milk adding some raisins soaked in rum.It should be one big omlet, then shered with 2 forks into pieces ,dust with powder sugar ,then serve it warm.

I made these, in fourths, then sprinkled them with regular sugar and cinnamon.    A fruit compote also goes well.

Yummm can't believe I found this recipe! I love these. This recipe is fantastic! Tricky but definitely doable and delicious. The only place I've had them is at Spago's in Beverly Hills. They are served with strawberries, powder sugar, a bit of whipped cream on the side and a drizzle of chocolate. They are a dessert so you can use any toppings you like...fruit, sweet sauces, even ice cream. They are my absolute favorite.
