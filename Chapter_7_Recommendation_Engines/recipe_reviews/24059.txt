The secret to any rice pudding is the timing of the sugar.  It must not be added until the rice is thoroughly cooked otherwise it will forever remain hard.  Those who did not like this recipe should test the rice for tenderness before adding the sugar in the final stage of the recipe.

My daughter found this recipe on the site and decided to make it last night. Erica, I wish I could give this more than five stars because it was incredible! My dad worked for Tuscan Dairy for fifty years in Union, N.J. and they made an amazing rice pudding, which I've never been able to even nearly duplicate. Thanks to you, this is pretty close! I omitted the raisins and used skim milk because it was the only thing I had in the house. The next time Ty gets a desire to make this great dessert, I'll have her use evaporated skim milk as it really replicates a light cream or a whole milk. Thanks so much!

Very easy. The first time I made this recipe I made it with long grain rice (not knowing the difference between long, med, and short) and half and half. Second time I made it with medium grain rice, skim milk and less sugar. The medium grain rice made a huge difference in the end product, do not make the mistake of using long grain rice the pudding will just not be the same! Also, no need to use half and half it was just as good with the skim milk---save yourself the calories! I liked it better with a little less sugar.

Erica is my new hero! This is, without a doubt, the BEST and EASIEST rice pudding recipe I have ever made. I followed the suggestions of others and used medium grain rice and half the sugar called for. I didn't put the sugar into the pudding until it was the consistency I wanted. Remember to put some of the warm mixture into the egg and milk before SLOWLY adding it to your pot so you don't end up with "egg-drop" in your rice pudding!

If you've never made rice pudding before or are looking for an excellent, easy recipe, this one is for you! Thanks, again, Erica. :)

I had a taste for a really good rice pudding, and this one is a keeper!!! I to added cinnamon,vanilla, and nutmeg, i also added a little more sugar! I added the salt to my boiling water that I cooked my rice in. Rice cooked without salt is hard to season. I will make this again.       Thanks!!!!!!!

Quick, easy and scrumptious! I’m not quite sure why the instructions call for the use of two saucepans, though. I just continued to use the same one the rice was cooked in. Couldn’t have been easier.

This was absolutely delicious! I never made homemade rice pudding before, but I had all the ingredients and some left over rice. 

First of all, I buttered my rice when it was cooking in step 1. This eliminates the need for it in the later part of step 2 and lends to a richer pudding. 

I generally watch the fat in my recipes, so I made mine with skim milk, which added another 6 or 7 minutes on to the total cooking time. I also increased the sugar a little, as I preferred it a bit sweeter (it's a matter of preference). But the main key is to add some of cooking pudding (from the pot) to a seperate bowl with the egg and milk mixture. This brings the egg and milk mixture to a warmer, more consistant temperature to what's in the pot and prevents the egg from scrambling. After about 3 minutes mixing them together in the bowl, slowly add the egg and milk mixture to the pot and continue cooking for about 2 minutes, until thickened.

Sprinkle it with a bit of cinnamon before serving. This pudding is delicious hot or cold. I will be making this recipe often. Thanks!

Wonderful recipe.  My 3-year-old just loves it, and it turned out nice and creamy.  I was skeptical, as I've always made rice pudding by cooking the rice in the milk, but it came out great-tasting, and the big bonus is that it's a great use for leftover rice!  And it doesn't make too much.  One warning--3/4 cup uncooked rice yields more than 1-1/2 cups cooked.  I used only 1-1/2 cups cooked, and think that any more would've taken away the creaminess.

rice pudding is a tradition in my family...the men especially love it.  i'm in the 4th generation of the family and this was my first attempt at making it on my own.  it turned out marvelous!!!  beats KozyShack brand all to bits...I doubled the recipe, used one pot, and added the vanilla and some cinnamon during the second milk addition.  turned out super creamy and just sweet enough!  I left out the raisins simply cuz I don't have any right now, but I will make it again and put them in!  definitely will add this recipe to my collection of favorites.  thanks!!

Simplicity in itself!  I've never made rice pudding (or any other pudding before), but found myself craving it one day, so I got the easiest looking recipe and here we are!  Now - I really abhor raisins so I left them out, and added half a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit since it needed to be a bit thicker.  But, I believe taste is subjective so, take my word for it, an excellent recipe.

(Oh, another thing, short-grained rice really makes a difference, at first I used long-grained and it just didn't taste right..the texture, etc.)

I found this great recipe because I was looking for something to make using leftover Chinese take-out rice. I used 1-1/2 cups of the cooked, leftover rice and added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. Absolutely delicious comfort food--and so quick and easy with the leftover rice that I think I'll always make it this way!

Perfection. Simple as that! Just like the genuine Mexican style rice pudding I'm used to. I did add a pinch of nutmeg and about a heaping 1/8 tsp of cinnamon though and used 1 cup half & half, 1 cup milk.  I read some other reviews concerning the the egg but you probably don't want to add raw egg after the mixture has cooled since, of course, the egg will still be raw! Just mix the egg with the 1/2 cup of milk and let it sit at room temp while the rices cooks. Then add it slowly to the rice while stirring, this way you'll avoid getting any egg chunks but still cook the egg in the hot mixture.
UPDATE:: I Made this again and decided to add about 1/4 cup sour cream! It is unfathomable that this recipe could be any better but the sour cream just sky rockets it's flavor!

Simple to make and awesome to eat! Why would anyone buy that junk from the supermarket that is just thickened goo with a few grains of rice floating around in it when, in under 45 minutes, you could be eating this?? Perfect in both flavor and texture, it's the ultimate comfort food. I used 1/2 cup Splenda (only because I'm diabetic)in place of the sugar, because 1/3 cup didn't give the requisite sweetness, and used dark raisins. Also added a dash of lemon extract, because that's how my mom made it, and the lemon points up the other ingredients. This is the first time I ever made rice pudding on the stove top (always baked it in the oven) and the texture is every bit as creamy. Much better when using a medium or short grain rice. However, if you only have long grain, increase the water in the initial cooking, i.e. with the 3/4 cup of dry rice, cook in 1-3/4 cup of water, and the rice will be less al dente, contributing to the soft creamy texture later on. You'll need to add a few minutes onto the initial cooking time in order for the additional water to be absorbed. Thank you for the easy, perfect recipe!

Amazingly Good! Erica, You so Rock!!!
I made this recipe just as written with no changes to the ingredients. It is so yummy and best of all, easy enough for even inexperienced cooks. Since I am an experienced cook I know all of the tricks of cooking the rice with the salt AND sugar in the water for the initial boiling period so it will all be absorbed into the rice. I used aproximately 1/3 of a cup of the warm liquid of the second boiling to temper the beaten eggs so as to not scramble them. And lastly, I just used one pan for the entire process to save on the clean-up. This is probably the best Rice Pudding recipe that I have ever tried, and believe me I have tried a bunch!

I made this with short brown whole grain rice and it left the pudding very chewy. Also, when I added the egg, it cooked very quickly and left chunks of white egg that had to be removed.

This is a great recipe!  I have made it several times and have come up with these changes to suit our taste.  We find it too sweet so I just use 1/4 cup of sugar.  The last time I made it I accidently used only 1 cup of milk in the first stage instead of 1 1/2 cups....so had 1 cup to mix in with the egg.  It turned out much better!  Less gluggy and more creamy.  I will do it that way from now on.

This was absolutely delicious!  For those who said they didn't get a creamy result, just try cooking the rice, milk, and sugar for a bit longer.  I had to cook it for 30 minutes (rather than 15-20) before it became very creamy.  Excellent recipe -- my entire family loved it.

My fiance gave me my engagement ring yesterday.  Later in the evening he asked if I knew how to make rice pudding, so I tried this recipe since it was simple and pretty quick.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg and tempered the egg like others have suggested.  When we sat down and ate our pudding, he got a euphoric look on his face and said, "Oh, if I had any doubts about marrying you, they are all gone now!"  It's good enough to get someone to marry you...or at least convince him he's making a good decision.  :)

Wonderful recipe Erica!  I made a double portion because I love rice pudding.  Used low fat milk, I added the rasins about 5 minutes before I added the eggs and rest of milk because I prefer softer rasins. Also HAD to add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon because without cinnamon it simply is not rice pudding!  Of course it loses the pure white look of the original recipe but it is excellent!  I thought I would have to watch the milk the whole 20 minutes... only in the beginning then it was great!

5/11/06---I used leftover white rice from chinese takeout. I will never throw any out, ever again....what a great way to use it up. I did add a bit of cinnamon & I didn't have any golden raisins so I used regular. Super easy to make but I made it in the afternoon & refrigerated until dessert...it gummed up a bit in the fridge. My husband, who was at work & hence didn't get to taste it warm, still loved it but I knew how much better it tastes when it is fresh. Don't get me wrong, it was still very good but it wasn't nearly as good as warm from the pan. UPDATE- 6/07/06---Made this again but I subbed chopped-up dried mangoes for raisins & added some ginger. I garnished w/ a small bed of brown sugar & then topped that w/ some chopped crystallized ginger. Wsa a wonderful dessert for Orange & Bourbon Salmon!

This was a very good rice pudding recipe.  I doubled the batch and added about 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, which added to the flavor but made the pudding a light brown color, so I'll probably just sprinkle the spices on the individual servings next time.  The only change I would make in the recipe would be to use slightly less sugar, as the pudding did turn out pretty sweet.  But it's still good as is, and was enjoyed by my family.

I have a serious weakness for Kozy Shack rice pudding.  I have been searching for a rice pudding recipe that even comes close to Kozy Shack...  and this one is pretty darned close!  I found that all of the water had been absorbed after about 15 minutes, and then after adding the milk/sugar it only took about 12 min for the consistancy to get pretty creamy.  It was still a bit runny at that point, and I poured some of the hot rice/milk mixture into the milk/egg mixture, to bring it up to a warm temp so the eggs wouldn't get scrambled.  Then I added it back into the pot, and stirred constantly for 2 minutes as indicated, albeit on a very low temp, not med.  I poured this into custard cups, and while the mixture was a little runny at first, it firmed up very nicely after about 15 minutes.  I used whole milk, but imagine nonfat or lowfat would work too.  I also used basmati rice, but since I know nothing of rice varieties, I don't know if there's a better alternative.  I believe almond extract in place of vanilla would be wonderful.  I didn't add raisins either, but not because I'm opposed to them, I just wanted plain unadulterated rice pudding.  It was fantastic.

***Update to my review***  This pudding was nice and creamy while still warm, however as it cooled it became dry.  After a night in the fridge, it was really dry.  This might be because I used long grain rice, I'm not sure.  So I dumped it back in a pan and added about 1/2 c. milk.  Heated it up to a boil, added a couple tablespoons of sugar, then added another egg mixed with about 1/4 c. milk, tempered the egg mixture and then added to pan; cooked for 2 mins. stirring constantly.  The pudding-to-rice ratio seems better now.  So, if yours dries out, remember it can be "fixed"!  Next time I make this recipe with long grain rice, I'll add 2 eggs, more sugar and up the milk at the end to 1-1/4 c.

I've never made rice pudding before, and for some reason I got a craving for it today so I made it on a whim. I just fiished and OMG YUM. Thank you so much for this recipe. it came out better than I'd hoped for my 1st attempt. I dont like raisins, so I followed another users example and omitted them, adding cinnamon and nutmeg. 
Delish. I will be making this again.

Fabulous!!! I used Arborio Rice and it turned out really good.......I also used Vanilla Bean Paste instead of Vanilla Extract just to have the pretty little vanilla bean flecks. Will be making this again for sure!

Absolutely delicious and very easy to make.  Two suggestions... add a little more water and cook the rice longer (about 30 minutes instead of 20) unless you like very firm rice in your pudding.... be sure to temper the egg before you add it unless you like scrambled egg in your rice pudding.

This has to be the ultimate! My hubby loves rice pudding, but I've always made it as a baked custard, as did his family. Never again! I did, of course, make a couple of changes. I noticed right away it's basically vanilla pudding with rice and raisins, so...
First, for those of you who are new to making pudding, start with room temp eggs. If you don't have time to set them out, place them in a bowl of really hot tap water for about 15 minutes. Room temp will help keep them from cooking improperly later.
I did begin with all the milk- and I used half whole milk, half heavy cream. Yeah- but it's worth it- it's dessert, people! :)
I also added 2/3 of the rice and raisins, just personal preference.  I also doubled the eggs- like my vanilla pudding recipe. Just so you know it works fine.
Remember, your cooking time begins with hot ingredients. And you MUST temper the eggs. This means to a bowl containing the beaten eggs, add s-l-o-w-l-y about 1/4 cup of your hot mixture, beating constantly. Then add the egg mix to your pan slowly beating constantly. This will prevent the "scrambled egg"problem.
I also threw in some good cinnamon with the vanilla and butter. (sorry- didn't measure.) 
Next time I'll add the sugar half at a time and taste. Just a bit sweet for my taste, but still soooo good! Thanks so much, Erica and Erica's Mom!!

My first time making rice pudding. Could not have been better. I made two batches. One with skim milk, one with whole milk. They were both wonderful. The skim milk, I cooked longer, and added and extra 1/2 cup milk. 
My friends who ate this loved it!!

This rice pudding is addicting!  I turned it into coconut rice pudding by cooking the rice in coconut milk rather than water, and I left out the raisins.  This recipe is also great with soy or rice milk, but I think it's best with whole milk.

So good, I've made it twice this week once with raisins the other without, I use one can of evaporated milk and regular milk to equal out to the 2 cups plus extra so it's not so dry. but other than that, delicious. Evaporated milk makes it creamier.

WOW...is this good!! I only eaten rice pudding a few times and don't remember liking them, but this recipe has changed my mind!  I made minute rice and let it cool slighty.  I followed a reviewer's suggestion when adding the beaten egg to the last 1/2 cup of milk and the slightly cooled rice.Added a few dashes of nutmeg and cinnamon at the end. Good warm or cold! Will make again. *UPDATE* I made this a 2nd time and doubled it, however it did not set up, had to drain off the liquid.  Hoping it was a "one time" thing, cause it was so good the first time.

What a great rice pudding!  I tried to make it healthier using brown rice (increasing the cooking time of the rice) and it lost nothing in taste!  My new favorite rice pudding recipe.  Have tried with dried tart cherries instead of raisins and it gave a nice contrast.

With just a few changes, this recipe has become my ABSOLUTE favorite.  (Without the changes, it is still fabulous!!)  It is creamy in texture and not overly sweet.  My family loves it. 

I substituted 1/2 cup heavy cream for 1/4 cup milk.  Yes, there's a little more liquid going into the mixture, but the cream not only makes the pudding richer and more flavorful, but it helps the mixture set.  I also omitted the butter and raisins.  Using leftover rice from the previous night's dinner makes it a quicker process.

A previous reviewer mentioned that her egg turned to scramble eggs.  The fix for this is:  after beating your egg,   add a small amount of the hot rice mixture to it and mix immediately.  This tempers the egg and will keep it from "curdling" once it hits the pot.

This was so creamy and  filling!  The only reason this would be soupy would be if you did not let it simmer long enough.  If you stir it too often it won't boil and there fore won't reduce into a delightful creamy dish!

My husband was craving rice pudding and this recipe hit the spot. He loved it! I used regular raisins and cooked them with the rice so they'd be plump and juicy. This was also very easy to make.

This is hands-down the BEST rice pudding I've ever HAD. Beats Kozy Shack for sure. I added cinnamon and ginger to taste at the beginning, and whipped the egg almost to foaming... I also stirred the ENTIRE time to ensure a better, more creamy texture. Adding extra sugar and a bit more vanilla give it a better kick, especially since I went sans raisins. This gives it the flavor it needs to stand on it's own without the raisins. Everyone I served this to raved about it, and said it was even better than their mother's!

I always add more raisins cause I love lots of them.... and the first time I made this recipe I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon as well, it was good. But WHOA....The second time I made this I used 1/2 cup coconut milk instead of the whole milk in the second stage and added 1/4 cup flaked coconut and 1 cup raisins - let soak in the egg mixture while cooking the milk and rice. OMG!! It came out sooooo darn yummy delish!!!! I had to make a second batch because I ate the whole first batch and didn't save any for anyone else. It did not last 2 minutes after serving, will have to double the recipe next time around!

Great recipe! Thank you for sharing.  I too added cinnamon and I left out the raisins. Like others, I planned ahead and cooked my rice in a larger pot to accommodate the milk after the rice cooked.  Why wash two pots?  Better for you than ice cream and just as creamy!

I am sorry but I must be the only person who does not like this rice pudding.  I have been brought up on traditional English creamy rice pudding, cooked the old fashioned way in the oven.  I have used the same recipe for years, and everyone I have cooked it for has always adored it, but thought I would try something different.  The recipe is very quick and easy to follow, but the taste for me was not good.  I have given this 2 stars as maybe I have been far too spoilt in the past to enjoy this!!

This is very good, but not great. Let me tell you how to make it outstanding.
   First off, double the recipe. Now instead of doing the two eggs, use three yolks instead. Use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk. After you add the rice to the milk mixture, throw in 3 cinnamon sticks.
   After pudding is done, let sit for a few hours. It will have set pretty thick. Add about another 1/2 cup of heavy cream warmed w/ about 2 Tbs of sugar. Mix well. Add about 15 marishino cherries halved. Finally, cover with some merangue and bake until light brown. UNBELIEVABLE!

This really is good, old-fashioned tasting rice pudding.  It reminded me of the rice pudding I had as a kid at the 'Horn&Hardart" restaurant chain here in New York before they went out of business.  I tried for years to find a rice pudding that tasted like that one and this was the closest yet! Do use the short, arborio rice for this particular recipe and follow all the steps and the timing carefully.  I made many batches and tried all different milks: Whole milk, 2%, and 1%, but when I used skim (nonfat) milk, it came out watery, so don't bother trying that.  For a lower fat version, just use 1% milk and lite margarine and it will still come out creamy and nice.  I also experimented and tried one batch with almond extract instead of the vanilla and it was creamy AND dreamy! LOL   Play around with this recipe - it's a keeper!

I've eaten rice pudding for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  That's how good this recipe is!  Definitely test the rice for tenderness before adding the sugar.  You can add a little xtra milk if it thickens too much upon cooling.  This recipe mulitplies well.  Makes a great breakfast warm.  The kids LOVE it, too.  Erica, I could kiss you!

I have been looking for a rice pudding recipe of this caliber for years, and I have finally found it! This recipe finally duplicates (or betters) a recipe that competes with a (now closed) restaurant that served up the best rice putting I have ever tasted.  I have come close to matching the restaurant’s recipe in the past, but “no cigar”.  I now have the cigar!  I made very few tweaks to this relatively simple recipe.  I (as another reviewer mentioned) think it is very important to dissolve the sugar and salt in the boiling water BEFORE adding the raw rice to the boiling water.  I also added 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg (along with one scant teaspoon of vanilla extract) at the very end.  My other seven rice putting recipes are now going in the trash. Thanks for sharing  a great recipe!

My dad is a retired sous chef and has a very similar recipe to this that he has made for years.    One suggestion is to rinse your rice several times though, you will find that your pudding will be much more whiter.

My mother used to make rice puddings and tapioca when I was growing up, so I found eating this to be very nostalgic. I am very pleased with this recipe.

It is fantastic with the ratios as written, but the technique needed some tweaking. If you can, use short-grain rice; the texture will be even creamier, and you could probably omit the egg entirely if you wanted to. First, add the salt to the rice as it's cooking the first time. Second, add the vanilla (or scrape out a vanilla bean) and spice if you're using it, such as a cinnamon stick or even just plain ground cinnamon, to the rice with the milk; the rice will soak up the flavor. Third, temper the beaten egg and milk with little bits of hot rice mixture until it's about half and half, THEN add it to the pudding. Fourth, add the sugar with the egg, not before. Also, if you're adding raisins, try soaking them in hot water before adding them; otherwise they will soak up any remaining liquid. The butter really isn't necessary, but if you're going for rich it doesn't hurt it a bit! Thanks for offering this recipe up, Erica.

Good recipe, although it could be creamier. I made the recipe as written and although good, it was a little thin creaminess. Make sure to use a medium or short grain rice to achieve the right texture. Long grain is too firm for pudding. I tend to use Calrose Rice - readily available in all grocery stores. As for the recipe, I use all half n' half and 1 egg yolk. Omitting the egg white creates a more tender pudding. The amount of sugar is fine if eaten warm, but if you plan if eaten cold, sugar needs to be increased to 1/2 cup. Overall, a great base recipe with a few tweaks needed. I will make again with adjustments - half n half and egg yolk only.

This recipe was awesome. It tastes great and is very easy to work with. At first I was reluctant to try this recipe because it recommends med-short grain rice for maximum creaminess and I didn't want to buy new rice when I have a lot of long grain at  home. So what I did was dump left over long grain rice into a food processor and processed it for a few seconds. Voila!!! short-med grain rice. To avoid cooked egg in pudding, I poured 1/2 cup milk into the beaten egg, so to  dilute the egg. I also took other raters advice and added few scoops of the hot pudding from pot into the egg mixture and then poured the whole mixture back into the pudding mixture in the pot. Next time, will try adding coconut milk and dried mangos for a different flavor.

Yummy!!!  I had some leftover rice and this is the perfect way to use it up.  Basically you can ignore it on the stove tope for 15 minutes because you really only need to pay attention the last 2 minutes when you add the egg and milk. This would be perfect to make while finishing up your dinner.  When dinner is over your dessert would be ready.  Thanks, Erica for such a simple, fast and tastey recipe!

I've been using this recipe for years.I leave out the raisins and sprinkle cinnamon and nutmeg over the top before serving. To prevent egg from cooking I beat the egg into the remaining 1/2 cup of milk before adding it and whisk quickly into boiling rice mixture. The finished pudding has a very smooth and creamy consistency.You can use almost any rice, I use jasmine rice, but any leftover rice works well. I revised the recipe to change the pudding/rice ratio to make it creamier. I used 2c cooked rice, and doubled everything for the custard recipe.  I am really happy with the result.

I'm not a big fan of rice pudding, but this was definately a very good one. So good, in fact, that I made two batches: One with dried cranberries and 1/2t cinnamon for me, and one this way with raisins and no cinnamon for the family. In our taste test, we decided both versions were very yummy. By the way, this raisin version I cut the sugar down by 1T, but the cranberry one needed the full 1/3 cup.Thanks Erica. Great Job!

I made this Rice Pudding and served it to my Husband Cold. He is Mexican and said it is better than his Mama's Arroz Con Leche. My Little Girl Thought I bought it at the Mexican Store in the Cup, I used Canella(spanish bark Cinnamon whole)and followed the Directions closely. IT IS GREAT, Per previous comments about sugar timming if you read carefully it says combine Sugar with COOKED Rice.

When I made up this recipe I used Uncle Bens Instant Long Grain Rice, I believe that made an affect why it did not thicken, since it did not thicked I took about 1/4 cup flour and some water and made a past from it to pour in to thicken it, overall when it was finished it was a very tasty recipe and I would deffinently make it, so if you have trouble thickening yours try the flour and water, worked really great for me, but don't pour it in all at once as it may thicken to much and you don't want that.

So sorry for the 1 star (I've never given a recipe 1 star here on AR!)...this pudding just never thickened up! I read all of the 'most helpful' reviews & applied their advice. Even after 3 days in the fridge, it never got any thicker (and I did increase the cooking time)...but it did smell great while cooking.

I have never had rice pudding nor do I ever recall seeing what rice pudding is supposed to look like, but I tried this recipe because my boyfriend loves it and everyone raved about this particular dessert.  Well, he didn't like it at all!  I added another 1/4 cup of sugar because I like desserts to be sweet.  He thought it still wasn't sweet enough.  Because I have never had rice pudding before, I didn't know what the consistency should look like or taste like.  I tried it when it was still warm and I thought it tasted pretty good, withthe cinnamon and nutmeg sprinkled on it, although it could have been sweeter.  As it cooled it became too "gummy" according to my boyfriend upon which I promptly threw it in the trash.  I will have to try something different next time.  Sorry!

Very creamy and sweet.  Excellent! The only changes that I made are that I used two cups of cooked long grain white rice (I like my pudding a bit on the thick side), and increased the vanilla extract to one teaspoon. In addition, I cooked the rice/milk/sugar mixture closer to one half hour on a medium-low heat rather then 15 - 20 minutes on medium heat. This is a keeper for me!

I have made this recipe several times with different variations, including berries, spices, Splenda instead of sugar, etc.  It always turns out great.  I have found that mixing the egg and tempering the egg mixture will help prevent scrambling of the egg.  However, my best advice for preventing scrambled egg in your pudding is to use egg substitute instead of a real egg, mix it with the milk, then prior to adding to the pudding, stir the egg/milk mixture with the hot spoon that you have been using to stir the pudding while it is cooking.  While adding the egg mixture, pour very slowly and stir the pudding constantly while pouring.  This combination of easy steps has always resulted in a very creamy, very thick pudding without any bits of scrambled egg.

this is the best rice pudding i've ever had.  i'm enjoying it as a write this review.  it's amazing that something so tasty can result from few ingredients and little time.  i incorporated the suggestions of others: substituted half and half for part of the milk (used about half cup), doubled the vanilla (i actually used leftover vanilla bean from another recipe), decreased the sugar by half, and tempered the egg before adding it to the recipe (stirred a bit of the hot mixture into the egg, then poured the entire mixture into the pan)to avoid scrambling the eggs.  thank you for sharing this recipe!

Yummy!  I made this *almost* exactly as written, using arborio rice to make the pudding as creamy as possible.  I did let the egg rise to room temp, and mixed it into the remaining milk to prevent the eggs from scrambling.  Couldn't find the nutmeg, so I sprinkled a little pumpkin pie spice over the top after I removed the pudding from the stove.  This was so much better than baked rice pudding, and I even made it with skim milk!  Excellent!

I've been looking for a great rice pudding recipe forever.  I found it!  Most are either too sweet, too dry, etc.  This recipe is perfect in taste and texture.  Thank you Erica for sharing.  Sandie

My first time making rice pudding and it was a huge success! I made it with almond milk instead of regular milk and I found the pudding to be very sweet. Next time I will try omitting  some of the sugar.

Delicious and very easy recipe. I have always made baked rice pudding, but it takes a long time in the oven. I made this and just placed it under the broiler for a few minutes until it developed the nice golden brown skin that my family loves. I will be making this often!

While the pudding tastes good, once you get it done the right way, I don't think that these directions are correct as written. First, it never says whether you're supposed to cover the pot or not in step two. When uncovered and cooked on medium heat, it never got thick enough. When I tried it covered, the bottom of my pot burned even with very frequent stirring. In the end, I found that I had to simmer it with the cover on in order to get it not burn and to be thick enough.

I love rice pudding!  This recipe is wonderful as it stands..although I do prefer to add a little more vanilla than what is called for and omit the raisins.  This time around I used quinoa and almond milk, instead of rice and regular milk.  I omitted the raisins, added extra vanilla and used a heart healthy butter spread.  Sweet, nutty and a bit healthier...

First attempt at rice pudding - delicious and easy recipe.  Used long grain rice, left out the raisins, doubled the recipe, used 1 can evaporated milk (1.5 cups) + 1.5 c water + another cup of lowfat milk to make 4 cups.  Tasted for sweetness after cooking the rice, milk, and sugar for a few minutes, and added an extra 1/3 to make 1 cup of sugar for a double recipe.  This was perfect for our tastes.  Used a large saucepan to cook the rice, and made the pudding in the same pan.  Loved that the recipe does not include cinnamon -  my family can add spices to taste.  This will be made again.  Big hit over here :)  Thanks for sharing.

Taste just like it did when I was a little kid. Great recipe! A little advice if you are multiplying the recipe; cook on medium heat for about 5 minutes longer, just to make it a little thicker (if you like it that way) I also added some nutmeg and cinnamon to my pudding on the stove and it tasted exquisite. Great Job whoever put this up and have fun : )

Oh my, a little too good! I left out the raisins and butter (why add the fat?). I used 2% milk and used 1 1/2 times the sugar (glad I did). I was worried it was going to be too runny, so I just kept stirring and stirring and it finally got thicker. No need to find another recipe in my opinion!

Wonderful Rice Pudding! Just like we used to have at summer camp! Athough the first time I made it, the egg made little yellow clumps in the puddind... The trick is to put it in real fast and keep stirring, or the egg will cook. Delicious! I make it every month!

We loved this recipe!  Just as a matter of personal preference, we added more sugar, about 1/2 cup more, 1/2 tsp more cinnamon, increased the vanilla to 1/2 tsp.  I didn't have golden raisins on hand but had regular ones and again, it's a matter of personal preference.  Thanks for the great recipe Erica!!

Yummy!  It took about 25 minutes for the rice, sugar, and milk mixture to get thick and creamy.  I used brown rice instead of white and it was really good.

Add cinnamon and this is perfect. I add milk slowly and use more as necessary to keep from drying out and for a good consistency. It's a helpful sleep aid as well!

This was really tasty and easy. I used left over brown rice and it worked fine. I also used currents and a dried berry medley instead of raisins, since it's what I had on hand.

I did have trouble with it thickening at first but once I cranked up the heat a bit, it was fine. If you're having the same problem getting it thick and creamy, make sure the mixture is boiling, and then let it cook for 15-20 minutes.

This a delicious recipe - and a good use for leftover rice (just move past item #1 in the directions). I have made it with and without the raisins (keeps better for a few days if you don't add them), and I use skim milk. I am generally a big fan of baked rice pudding, but this one is just as good.

Had rated this earlier and did not include that we used soy Silk w/ Vanilla the with great success.  Made it for company with 2% milk and it was a disaster!  So, for those who don't do dairy, soy milk works great too.  When chilled it does thicken quite a bit, but can be restored to orignial consistency with some added milk.

This is a great recipe. I have made it at least 30 times! My only suggestion to people making it for the first time is to measure exactly (although some times I do add more sugar when my sweet tooth demands it) and I have noticed different brands rice can change the cook time, quantity, and overall consistency. Make sure the rice is cooked completely, and add more water if necessary before preceding and the end product is incredible!

This recipe is fantastic.  I used brown rice instead of white, and brown sugar Splenda instead of the white sugar, and also added cinnamon.  This is the best rice pudding I've ever had.

Perfect.  I used leftover Forbidden Rice (black).  I did not think I needed to termper the egg/ milk mixture but I should have (add some of the hot rice mixture to the egg/milk mixture before adding the last milk/egg to the pot. (I had to pick out a few bits of scrambled eggs).  I plan to post a picture of this beautiful purple pudding.

Since I like mexican food so much I thought I would give this recipe a try bein it's "rice" and all. I didn't like it. Not for desert at least. It's not a bad breakfast food. I ate the leftovers the next morning. It takes too long though to be cooking for a weekday breakfast. And if I'm going to take this kind of time for a weekend breakfast it sure won't be rice pudding. I will not make this one again.

I made this in the microwave, it was very good. If you don't have time to do it on the stove, try it in the microwave oven using some leftover rice. Yum.

Great recipe.  An easy go-to for leftover rice.  Very comforting on a cold winter night.  My only complaint was that I found it a little too sweet which kind of overpowered the sweet of the golden rasins (admittedly this could be from using reduced fat milk, which has extra sugar additives than whole).  On my second batch I doubled everything but the sugar, added a pinch of fresh nutmeg (I love cinnamon and nutmeg) and it was absolutely PERFECT!

So very good!!  I thought that I had raisins and didn't, so I used dried cranberries instead.  I also tempured the egg.  I beat the eg with the 1/2 c. of milk, and added some of the rice mixture to the egg a little at a time to warm it up because I was afraid of the egg cooking.  Turned out great, a favorite of mine!!  Thanks!

Thanks Erica!  My husband is a lover of rice pudding so I decided to give this quick recipe a try.  He loved it!  I ommitted the raisins (not a raisin lover) and had to add a bit more milk than stated.  He ate it warm then devoured the leftovers cold.  A great quick and easy recipe!

Very easy and creamy.  Stirring in the egg works best in a single batch, but my double batch came out nicely as well.  Great way to use up leftover chinese white rice.  Added more sugar to suit my pop's tastes....the bowl was gone by morning!

This recipe was very good.  I really don't undersand why it was not made to utalize all the rice you make.  Did I read it wrong?  I adjusted the milk, egg, sugar, and salt so that I wouldn't have any rice left over and it turned out yummy.  I also added cinnamon sticks, real vanilla beans, and a few cardamom pods in with the milk.  I love jasmine rice so that's what I used and it seemed to work well with the recipe.

I really like this recipe and make it often. I add about 50% more sugar though, and I also add a little extra water to the rice. I have found that by doubling the recipe, the end product tends to be creamier than the 4-serving version (easier to cook in a large pot too). It tastes great re-warmed, especially with a little milk poured over it, so for me having leftovers is a good thing. Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this recipe and it is awesome.I thought I had been using the "best" recipe but this one is the "best of the best". I doubled the recipe and it worked beautiful. I beat my eggs and then added them to the cup of milk. Make sure that you add the egg mixture very slowly into the hot rice mixture. I did add a bit more sugar--we like it just a bit sweeter. So glad I found this recipe.

This is definitely a 'keeper'.  I have had no luck with rice puddings done in the oven.  What a simple version here!
Using Arborio Rice I made this with the 3 packets of sugar substitute (that another reviewer suggested) instead of sugar and added about 1/2 of a large peeled apple (thinly sliced then chopped)instead of the raisins......last but not least a dash each of nutmeg and cinnamon.
Every spoonful is a creamy delight.  
Thanks SO much, Erica!

Great way to use up left over white rice. I didn't use raisins because I'm not a fan of them and I took someone else's suggestion and added 1/2 tsp almond extract with the vanilla. It was easy, delicious, and the only problem I had was that it dissapeared too quickly.

Ohh yum.  This is good.  My hubby is out of town & here in Chicago it is about 3 degrees, and as I'm stirring this pudding, I hear what appeared to be gun shots coming from my garage (mind you, I live in a VERY quiet neighbor hood)....well ha, it was my diet cherry coke, (my all time favorite) in the garage fridge... EXPLODING!  UGH, what a mess!  Well the pudding was very good, my mom used to make it similar to this.  Yum, comfort food.  Thanks Erica.  And D...good luck with that blender ;)

This pudding was delicious!!!  I thought it took rather long for the milk to thicken, but it was more than worth waiting for.  It was the first time I ever tried to make it, and it was wonderful.  I don't like raisins, so I left them completely out, and I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon - perfect!!!  My 2 yr. old and 4 yr. old loved it, which surprised me as the younger is normally very picky.

Amazing!!!! I also used skim milk because that is all we had, and it still turned out wonderful.  The next time I made it, I added less butter, and I was not able to tell the difference.  This is now our regular dessert since is so low in fat when made this way.  Thanks Erica!  This is the best!

I did not like this recipe at all.  It definitely needed more milk and I did not like the taste of the egg in it.  I would definitely use at least 3 more cups of milk and omit the egg.

I went searching for a great rice pudding recipe after having some very creamy pudding at an Indian Restaurant.  The pudding I've been used to is very clumpy and usually too sweet -- this recipe is perfect and works INCREDIBLY with soy milk for a vegetarian alternative.  I'd recommend it to anyone, fast, easy, and delicious!  PS -- it mixes very well with ambrosia fruit salads!

Amazing!  I subbed homemade almond milk for dairy milk since I'm lactose intolerant and it still tasted  wonderful!  Also used arborio rice.  Skipped the raisins and cinnamon because I prefer the simple sweet flavor of just the rice.

A delicious, easy way to use up leftover rice. This was a great wintertime, gluten-free dessert. Just make sure you temper the eggs-- gradually stir in spoonfuls of the hot rice mixture into the eggs until it's heated through. Then add that to the pot. This will keep the eggs from scrambling.

This is fantastic! It was my first attempt at rice pudding, and it has to be the most delicious thing ive made in awhile! I used a can of evaporated milk for the first 1 1/2 cups of milk, I also made the addition of cinnamon and regular raisins, instead of golden. I also made sure to temper the egg. So good, thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!

this turned out great. turned out more smooth than an oven baked rice pudding I've made.  I accidentally included all the milk with the rice, so I skimmed some milk back off -- which then that hot milk worked well to temper my beaten eggs.  I was impressed that it turned out so smoothly. I think it was better with cinnamon added at the end.  Another ingredient I tried was a bit of orange zest which added a nice touch for something different.

Holy Moly! I used to make rice pudding all the time when I was a teenager about 25 years ago.  I made extra white Jasmine rice for dinner so I could make this for dessert. I used 1% milk, omitted the raisins (yuck!) and doubled the amount of sugar (2/3 cup) as recommended by other reviewers. A little sprinkle of cinnamon on top, and YUM! I will be making this again for sure!

I loved this! I added about 2 extra Tablespoons of sugar and after combining the rice milk and salt added 2 "old school" REAL cinnamon sticks during the entire cooking process. Tasted just like how my mom used to make it. Discard cinnamon sticks when done. =)

Hmmm, based on the other great reviews, maybe I did something wrong. This was not creamy at all, I may have cooked it too long or used too much rice. I'll have to try it again.

Delicious recipe! When cooking the rice, I only let it go for 15 minutes instead of 20. I also added 2/3 cup of sugar because I have a real sweet tooth! Be sure to add the sugar towards the end also. I took the raisins out of the recipe also.

Delicious...I didn't alternate between using two pots because the starch from the rice pot helped to thicken and it didn't make any sense to do so. After the rice had cooked I just added the remaining ingredients in order. I found however, that I had to add a touch more sugar for my taste and that of my kids. I used mixed raisins, and a half cup of half-n-half in addition to milk. Then added a few dashes of cinnamon to top it off, the end result was an empty pot in 20 minutes.

Not enough "pudding" and way too ricey.  It definitely needed more creamy custard to it. If you plan to serve it cold, you definitely need more liquid to make it a pudding. This turned out to be  sweet creamed rice. I would recommend eliminiating the egg, adding more milk, and using sweet condensed milk.

Erica, you are my hero!  I have searched for years for a rice pudding recipe like my mother's.  This is the best, the creamiest, the most delicious rice pudding I have ever tasted.  I used arborio rice, 1 cup fat free half and half, 1 cup skim milk, scant 1/3 cup of Stevia, and added fresh grated cinnamon and nutmeg to the rice mixture.  No better comfort food in the world and it couldn't have been easier!  Thank you for sharing!

Wow.  This was incredible!  Took everyone's suggestion on adding the sugar only after the rice has the correct consistency.  Also, added 1 tsp vanilla extract instead of a 1/2 tsp.  Wonderful when topped with nutmeg and cinnamon!!!

It's the second time I make this successfully. A bit sweeter than I'm used to for rice pudding but all the same, very tasty. I like how the egg adds a bit more "pudding" texture. I didn't use the raisins and opted for cinnamon.

I was looking to use up some leftover Success rice and remembered this recipe. This is great! Creamy, flavorful and easy. I skipped the rice cooking step obviously and added in some nutmeg an cinnamon. No raisins, hubby doesn't like them. Added some craisins to mine. Good stuff, there will be more made from this recipe! Thanks!

Delicious, creamy,creamy rice pudding,,,The kind I have always dreamed of making.   I had to use up some leftover heavy cream, so I used a cup and a half of the cream and 1/2 cup 1% milk for the rest.  I do not like raisins. I added 1 T. honey and 1 T. brown sugar to the sugar. Who cares about the fat and calories. This is a treat. It is supposed to be WONDERFUL, DELICIOUS,  you must try this.    :))

WOW, Very rich!  Excellent.  Next time I will only use skim or 1% instead of whole milk and I will only use 1/2 the sugar.   depends on what taste you are going for either way its a 5+ star recipe!  Thanks.

I have been looking for a recipe for rice pudding like my Aunt Brandy used to make.  This is very close.  There is something missing from the flavor she had in hers, but it is really close!!  The only thing that I did differently was to use the salt in the water when cooking the rice.  It makes it softer and will get sweeter later in the cooking.  Otherwise, it's a keeper!!!

How can something this simple be so to-die-for???  It is easier to do it all in one pan and to add all the milk instead of dividing.  I added a little more vanilla and also cloves and cinnamon.  Will be making this often!!!

I guess I have never had true rice pudding, because ours never had eggs in it when I was a kid.  I didn't much care for the egg in this recipe.  Next time, I'll just leave it out and it's perfect.  I like mine a little on the sweet side, so i think the amount of sugar was perfect.  I added half to begin with, per other reviews suggestion, and ended up using the full amount.  I also used pre-cooked cold rice--the key being to cook the rice with the milk for about 15 min before adding the sugar.  (It's supposed to be hot before you add the sugar.)  This worked perfectly and it was a beautiful texture I've never had with my previous attempts.

This is my GO TO recipe for rice pudding and its my base for horchata too (mexican rice drink) Its my husbands favorite and is WAY better than Kozy shacks! I like it best with small jasmine rice but most of the time i use cheap bulk rice. I use about a half a can of sweetened and condensed soup in mine as well as i prefer using a can of evaporated milk for the milk it calls for and just adding the difference in reg skim milk. I decrease the sugar, sometimes increase it depending on my mood but even when i accidentally doubled the sugar once it was not too sweet at all! I have loved it with more cinnamon and only a fourth cup of sugar before too because thats all i had on hand! I always add nutmeg, allspice and ginger with my cinnamon, it makes the flavor so much deeper and makes me feel more decadent. I have made baked cinnamon apples to top it too with a dollop of whipped cream, same with peaches and strawberries...all if it to die for! wish i had more stars for this!! i have added ground flaz seeds too to get more good out of it and you couldn't even tell at a half cup!!

Delicious! I used long-grain rice and followed the recipe exactly. Even though I used fat-free, the rice pudding came out super creamy! As another user suggested, I think I'll try Calrose rice next. Thanks for this simple and delicious recipe! Will make again and again.

I've made this recipe multiple times--even tripled it once (which is no problem). The only thing I change is to omit the raisins, although I compensate by adding cinnamon, raspberries, bananas, or blackberries when I serve it. Like other reviewers say, let the pudding cool a bit before adding the egg, or it will cook. This is a great way to please your sweet tooth without all the fat!

In a nutshell, what other rates have advised: cook the rice well before adding the sugar. Mix the half cup of milk with the egg before adding and do it slowly and stirring constantly. Sprinkle some cinnamon and or nutmeg after cooking. I would also add: if you're not going to serve immediately, add more water and more milk in the first two stages or you'll end up with a very dry rice mixture just one hour after taking it from the heat.

This was absolutely delicious.  I will never buy commercial rice pudding again!  This recipe was very easy, and produced a wonderfully creamy, custard-style rice pudding.  It would be very easy to change the flavors by using coconut milk for the milk, or adding a bit of cinnamon/nutmeg/etc.  My husband, who claims to dislike rice pudding, said this rice pudding was "outrageous." Definitely a keeper!

It's good for a quick rice pudding, but the creamy rice puding I usually make by boiling rice in the milk has a less watery taste. Not bad though. Will make again if I need to use leftover rice.

Good rice pudding, even though I made a so called lighter version. I used instant brown rice, skim milk, equal and 3 tbls. of egg beater whites in place of egg and omitted the raisins. I also added just a pinch of cinnamon. Very delicious. Thanks!

This is the best rice pudding that I have ever made, and I have tried quite a few recipes! I triple it (otherwise my father eats most all of it within the first day!), use slightly less sugar, and add about 3/4 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg when you add the sugar. Just make sure that if you make a larger yield you take into account that the instructions that appear on the site are still for 4 servings and you need to increase those as well. YUMMY!   ALSO, I don't add raisins and you can use any kind of milk, even skim, and it tastes just as great! And, I don't mind using long grain rice as it gives a texture to the pudding, but med. and short make it creamier!

This was a delicious, easy rice pudding.  I think it's a shame when people don't give as many stars as the recipe deserves because they don't know technique.  The recipe doesn't mention it, but you MUST temper your egg before adding it at the end or you will have scrambled egg rice pudding!  This is basically a creme anglaise with rice added - delicious and simple.  I served it warm with some mango chopped up in it.  Very Thai!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

This was so easy to put together, and so good. Growing up "rice pudding" was left over rice baked with an egg custard. This was so much better, and creamy. I used left over rice. I only had low fat milk, and blended the egg with 1/4c. light cream, omitting the butter. I cooked this while I was making dinner, let it cool and served it with a sprinkle of cinnamon. Next time I will mix in chopped dried apricots instead of raisins, and top it with toasted almonds. Very good recipe for the imagination! The dogs wont be getting left over rice anymore! Thank you for a quick and fabulous recipe.

This recipe was really good. I cooked the rice in a rice cooker, the only draw back was the rice cooker on the 2nd step. It kept sucking up the milk and sugar really fast. But I kept adding and adjusting milk, sugar, butter(a 2nd tbsp) and vanilla (1 1/2 tsp more). It cooked so fast. But next time 2nd step on the stove. But turned out soo well anyway that hubby was in pain for eating to much. I will be making this again in the future with my family.

This is wonderful great!  My daughter made it first, following all the instructions just as they are given, using hot rice.  The rice pudding turned out superb.  I made it later, twice, using cold cooked rice.  It did not thicken the way it did before, in fact, I had to lessen or omit the cold milk that is added after the cooking.  It is not as creamy made this way, but still delicious.

okay.  this is one of the best things i have ever eaten.  i had rice pudding for the first time from a wonderful dairy and just had to find a recipe to match it.  well this exceeded it.  by far.  i used medium grain rice so that it would be even creamier, used rapadura sugar instead of white sugar because it's better for you and added some cinnamon.  this is amazing.  i absolutely love it.  my mother in law said it's better than what her mom used to make and begged me for the recipe.  just try it... you'll love it!

Mmmm! so good. For some reason I didn't like rice pudding as a kid, but now i do. This recipe is great and easy to make. 
I used jasmine rice and 2% milk. I did use a sugar substitute (5 packets of splenda did the the job). And i used smart balance spread instead of butter and a dash of cinnamon.
Oh and you have to be careful with adding the egg or it will curdle. Tempering is the safest way. Forgot to add the raisins so i just shaved some chocolate over the top.
Anyways, i need to go before someone else eats the rest of the rice pudding.

This was fantastic!  I was looking for a recipe that I didn't have to bake, and this was it!  The only thing I would change is to add 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and use only 1/3 cup raisins instead of 2/3 cup - was just way too many raisins for my taste (I omitted the butter as well).  One note of advice - be sure and stir constantly once you add the egg or you'll have scrambled eggs in your pudding!  Also note that you can use egg substitute and it works out just fine.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I thought this was wonderful! I used left over white rice from our Chinese Takeout dinner. I also used non-fat milk, it was too thin at first but after sitting in the fridge for a couple of hours it thickened up just fine. I also used a few dashes of Cinnamon! This is a keeper.

This was the first rice pudding I have ever made, and it turned out great! I did not have uncooked rice so I simply used Minute rice. I cooked 2 and 1/2 servings of minute rice, then made recipe as directed. I too only used 1 pan. I topped it with nutmeg and cinnamon.

I made this tonight and was somewhat disappointed.  The rice stays too distinct from the pudding with this technique; when cooked in milk, it blends better, which makes the pudding creamier.

I used a mix of 2% milk and heavy cream, brown sugar instead of white (1/3 cup was perfect for me, but I tend to like my rice pudding only mildly sweet).  I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 1 or 2 teaspoons of orange zest instead of the raisins and butter.  I then tried the pudding and found it too thin for my taste, so I added a second egg and made sure the mixture made it to 160 degrees again. 

Bottom line: if you have the patience to stir for a while, look for a recipe that cooks the rice in milk.  Maybe crock pot versions will turn out creamier rice without being so hands-on. If you just need some easy pudding that tastes reasonably good, go for this one.  Try it with orange zest sometime, it's good.

This recipe was soooo easy!  I used fat free milk and 1/4 cup of egg beaters.  It still thickened perfectly.  A few changes.....I used half the amt of cooked rice to have a more pudding texture.I also used asian rice (that is what I had on hand) Just before the rice was done cooking I began to heat the milk mixture so that it was warmed before adding the rice.  I did temper the egg and milk mixture before adding it to the rice mixture.  I also omitted the butter and added the raisins last with the vanilla.

This was very good. I used vanilla soy milk and did not add the raisins. Next time I think I will cook the rice just a little bit longer. Thanks for the great recipe!!! :)

We love this recipe. It is the only one I use anymore. I've added buttermilk once. I was able to use lowfat milk and still have a creamy rich flavor. You must add it slowly and use a whisk as it can curdle. I've also tried it with unsweetened Silk soymilk. Not a big hit.As it is, the recipe is perfect. No need to spoil perfection!

This was really good and very easy.  I dont like raisins so I left them out.  The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because it tasted kind of eggy.  I did not temper the egg, and I had no problem with it scrambling, however I could just taste it in the pudding. If I make it again I will omit the egg or just add half of it.  

Also, I used 1 percent milk and it was still really creamy.  Maybe it is better with half and half, but this was good enough that I dont think half in half or whole milk is really worth the extra calories.  I also added a lot of cinnamon to this at the end.

I used 1/2 of a vanilla bean, split with seeds scraped out and added to hot milk mixture (instead of vanilla extract).  Also sprinkled with freshly grated nutmeg and cinnamon.  Yum~
Update: Used Arborio rice, added sugar at the very end after rice was soft, doubled vanilla, put salt into water when boiling the rice in the first step.

Awesome! I made this rice pudding lastnight and it turned out fabulous! I replaced the milk with soymilk, and I omitted the butter. I am sure the butter would have made it more rich, but I try to avoid dairy products. Excellent recipe, quick and easy.

This is sooo good!  I had a ton of leftover rice to use up, and this was perfect. (Tripled the recipe) I used skim milk (all I had) and cooked it a little longer (by about 10 min) and it came out great! I divided it up and added raisins to one half while still warm (I don't like them), and my husband said they plumped up nicely.  Also added lots of cinnamon after it was cooked.  YUM!

I have been on a quest for the creamiest, best tasting rice pudding for years and this is it!
I substituted 1/2 and 1/2 for the milk and it was very creamy.

If I could give it 10 stars I would.  I'm very picky about rice pudding but this is really, really good.  I use arborio rice instead of long grain white rice because it comes out creamier.  It's a real hit with my family!

Wonderful! This was my first experience with making rice pudding.  I loved it!!  I must pass on, however, to not be stingy with the milk.  I was leery of adding so much milk, because I was afraid it would be watery.  Mine came out a bit too thick.  Be generous with the milk!  It really makes the difference.  Thank you!

This was quite good. It wasn't as creamy as I was hoping though, so maybe next time I will try a different kind of rice. I also forgot to sprinkle cinnamon on it after it was done so I'll be sure to do that next time as well. I will definitely make this again!

I almost always make this recipe out of the small container of white rice that we never eat from the takeout chinese places. I just pick it up at step 2. It's excellent! I do need to add more milk when i reheat it the next day though. No biggie.

For Easter my boyfriend wanted rice pudding. I myself had never even tried it. It turned out so well that he was able to eat 3 bowls after dinner! For a richer flavor I used brown sugar instead of white and (for extra sweetness) added a spoonful of maple syrup. When simmering the mixture I added a cinnamon stick and of course doubled the vanilla. Yellow raisins were perfect for this recipe (added earlier for extra plumpness). It was nice served with a bit of milk and a sprinkling of cinnamon.THANK YOU!

Incredible!!  Just the right consistency plus it's quick and easy to make!  I used skim milk and cut down the butter and it turned out creamy.  Following others advice I added nutmeg, cinnamon, and a dash of almond extract (I ran out of vanilla).  Thanks for this recipe, it's perfect!

I never was a rice pudding fan until I tried this recipe.I made it for my daughter , who loves rice pudding. Of corse I had to taste it and make sure it was edible.....WOW!!! I used half and half instead of milk. It came out very creamy and light! Can't wait to make this for the holidays!
Thanx for the great recipe!

I have been loking for a CREAMY rice pudding recipe and this one is wonderful!  I think what makes the difference is the rice.  I used white basmati rice and added extra water and "overcooked" it a little leaving it very sticky and starchy.  It made a very creamy rice pudding.  I like it cold so I added the raisins and nutmeg after it cooled with whipped cream on top.  Thanks!

It did not turn out as creamy as I expected or would have liked.  I think this may be because of the type of rice I used - I had long grain handy so that is what I used, and maybe a shorter grain would have produced creamier results.  I used regular raisins, again, because that is what I had on hand, and they added a nice contrast in texture.  I will try this recipe again with a shorter grained rice.

Last time I had rice pudding this good is when I worked in a small Deli in Concord Ca. about 20 years ago and the lady who owned the shop made everything from scratch. This is very good and easy to make!

Divine! I have always LOVED rice pudding, but my attempts to make rice pudding in the oven have consistantly been flops!  This stove top recipe is to die for. So creamy, and not grainy at all.  The only thing I'd change is to add less raisins (personal preference) I found that because they are added to the hot liquid they plump up quite a bit, giving the pudding that extra sweetnes that it doesn't really need.  Hats off to Erica for a sensational recipe...now I must go and enjoy another bowl!!

This was yummy!  What a great way to use left-over cooked white rice!  I used Jasmine rice, which smelled and tasted wonderful, regular raisins and almond extract, since that's all I had on hand.  I strongly recommend this variation!  Was really good warm OR cold.  Thanks!

Wow!  Very good and very simple to make.  I don't like raisins much so I didn't add them.  I also included a pinch or two of cinnamon and nutmeg.  It was splendid.

I made the original recipe with the long grain rice because it was all i had. It was so good I went out and bought the medium grain rice and rescaled the recipe for 20. EXCELLENT.....thanks for sharing.

This was perfect.  Very creamy.  We added cinnamon, and I didn't have golden raisins on hand, and so I boiled regular raisins so they were plump, and added them.  I also used brown rice, because it was what I wanted to use up.  Another time, I would add less sugar.  I thought it was a little sweeter than it needed to be, perhaps because of the addition of the cinnamon.  Hope to also experiment with cardamom.  For those having problems with scrambling the eggs in the pudding, I did what I do with other custards and spooned some of the hot pudding into the egg/milk mixture that gets added at the end to slowly raise the temp before adding it all back into the hot pudding, and didn't have problems with scrambling the eggs.

SO easy! I made it almost exactly as written, except I left out the raisins because I prefer my rice pudding without them, and I decreased the sugar slightly because I prefer it a little less sweet. But the basic science is there--perfect! I sprinkled just a tad of cardamom, cinnamon, and nutmeg on top.

I love this recipe. It is very simple and easy to make and my family loves it. If you do not like rice pudding at all then this would not be for the dessert for you. One of the things that annoys are reviewers who give this recipe a low rating while not following simple instructions that anyone who can read should be able to follow. One person actually admitted to using "brown rice". Why would anyone use brown rice when the recipe clearly calls for white rice?  Come on now.

I followed this recipe exactly and found it to be way too sweet. If I make it again I will cut the sugar in half and only use 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla. I prefer thick rice pudding and this recipe didn't produce the thickness I thought it would. If you like thinner and really sweet rice pudding, this recipe may work for you.

Perfect recipe...IF YOU FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS....I find is so insane that people change the recipe and then complain and give a low rating.  Sometimes I wonder if these people have some comprehension problems.  Follow the recipe then leave a review, if you don't follow the instructions your on your own so don't clog up the reviews with the review of YOUR VERSION!

I had a little over a cup of leftover cooked rice and decided to try this recipe. I used 1% milk and dried cranberries because I didn't have any raisins. I added the sugar, salt and milk to the pot the rice was in and cooked everything in one saucepan. When I added the egg, I mixed it first with the rest of the milk and poured it into the mixture slowly. It turned out perfect. SO easy!

excellent. I did do as some of the reviews suggested and made sure to put some of the hot rice mixture in with the egg before pouring egg into the pot. very tasty. i then made a second batch and used craisens instead of raisens, and I think i like the craisens better.

This was a really good recipe. I've read that you should use a medium grain rice for rice pudding. I only had long grain so I used that. I can see how a medium would work better but the long grain worked okay. Like some other reviewers I added some cinnamon (around 1/2 tsp). I love raisins in rice pudding so I added more than the 2/3c listed - that was probably a mistake (it was very raisiny). I'd leave it as the 2/3 listed or maybe even down to 1/2c. I used almond milk and it worked well. To make sure I didn't get cooked egg chunks in the pudding I heated the last 1/2 cup of milk in the microwave until warm and then mixed the egg in that before adding the rest of the pudding.

Tastes great, just like any good rice pudding I've ever had. I did some changes that didn't mess with the original recipe, just personal preference. I omitted the raisins, cause I've never had rice pudding with them. I used long grain brown rice cause that's all I had on hand & it took a lot longer to cook than 20 mins, more like 50 mins like it said on the rice package. Also I used my Silk soy milk, cause I dont drink regular milk & right there I made this rice pudding into a complete protein :)! That's exciting! I had to simmer it about 10 mins longer because I used soy milk & I also added 1/3 more sugar. Make sure the egg is beaten well & you add it slowly while continuously stirring it - very important! I topped each serving with cinnamon. Perfect & I like I made it even healthier. Why fix something that isn't broken, this is my go to recipe.

I had a huge craving for warm rice pudding on this cold day. I've never made it from scratch before and let me tell you, this blows store bought out of the water. I too made it all in one pot and added the sugar with the beaten egg and last bit of water. I like mine nice and sweet so I added a bit more sugar at the end and topped it with cinnamon. I also left out the raises because I hate them!! Do yourself a favor and make this tonight!!!!

Used Truvia instead of sugar to save a few calories.  Very nice rice pudding with perfect texture.  Sprinkled just a little cinnamon-sugar mixture over the top.

Great recipe, thanks!  Perfect the way it is but once had some heavy cream to use up so substituted it measure for measure for about a quarter of the milk.  Yum!  I'm uncertain why the "most helpful critical review" is helpful at all.  She didn't follow the directions and then dinged the recipe for two things that are clearly her own fault:  using brown rice and not tempering the egg before adding it.  Thanks again!

I was able to make dairy-free with almond milk. I used stevia and smart balance. It was still creamy and delicious! So easy too with leftover rice!

Just a sentimental note, I saved this recipe many years ago, and it was the very first thing I ever cooked with my then 3 year old granddaughter. She is now 10, and still asks me to make it once in a while. Just to brighten it I sometimes add the grated peel of a lemon or lime.

good recipe but since i am lactose intolerant i made it with almond milk (plain) and left out the butter. Depending on how watery your almond milk is you may need an extra egg. I am used to diluting my almond milk to a drinkable consistency (i find it way too thick). With these modifications it can be eaten by those who are lactose intolerant and gluten intolerant. Cheers!

This is a really good homemade rice pudding! Everyone I have made it for, just loves it!! People ask me to make it for them. 

I followed the advice of the other reviews and it was perfect. I used evaporated milk and skim milk, rather than cream. I cooked the vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg in the milk mixture. I also beat the eggs into the last addition of milk with a already hot mixture so that the eggs will not go lumpy and you pieces of eggs in the pudding.

important thing that is left out of this recipe is to temper the beaten egg(s) before adding them to the hot milk. If not, you will have bits of scrambled eggs! I thought it could be somewhat sweeter. I will had about 1/4 cup more sugar next time.

This is such a simple and sweet little dish that makes everyone feel warm, especially on those cool autumn or cold winter nights. It's good all year round.

If you follow the directions precisely, you'll get excellent results. The type of rice truly does make a difference. Long grain rice is a completely different texture than, say, short grain rice. I noticed a creamier and thicker texture with short-grained right as opposed to long-grained. It has to do with the starch content in the rice itself.

A small addition that I make to my rice pudding (and it is well loved) - Take 1/4 cup of dried, pitted cherries (you can chop them up if you want) and add to a small sautee pan. Take about 1/8th (2 tablespoons) cup of drinking sherry (I use amontillado, only because it's always in my house - slightly sweet, slightly dry) and pour over the cherries. Saute until the sherry is cooked off into a thicker liquid (or until the cherries absorb the sherry). Add your sherried-cherries when you add the butter and vanilla to the recipe.

Depending on the type of cherries you use, they add a different sweetness as well as a tartness. The sherry adds sweetness and a richness that cannot be matched!

Followed the recipe almost exactly, extended my cooking time by maybe 5-10 minutes. Came out great. I am a novice cooker and this is only my second time making rice pudding. The first time being last night using a different recipe and I didn't cook the rice enough. Definitely will be using again. I know not to blame a recipe for my lack of cooking skills unlike some others.

This is a great recipe for rice pudding if you are a lover of rice pudding like me!  I personally like mine a little sweeter so next time I will increase the amount of sugar.  Also, I did like others, I added the salt when I cooked the rice initially, I cooked everything in one pot and I also tempered the eggs prior to adding them so that you don't get scrambled eggs.  I left out the raisins b/c I prefer my rice pudding without and also more cold then warm.  No more kozy shack for me!

Wonderful!  I made more of the recipe because I had more rice.  Don't be afraid to add milk the second time, it will thicken up!  Just follow the recipe :)  The golden raisins were awesome in this, and I definitely think they added a better flavor than normal raisins.

Nice and creamy...I am savoring the flavors as I type.  I made this with organic, grass-fed milk, Jasmine rice, omitted the raisins and added rose water (2-3 tsp) and ground cardamom (1/4 tsp) at the end. I also used Sugar in the Raw (1/4 cup) in place of the white sugar. It turned out great.  My only word of caution is to tilt the lid when covering the rice otherwise it will boil over.

I think if you are looking for something quick and simple, you will be impressed by this; but this is nothing more than creamed rice. It is NOT rice pudding. 

I was rather disappointed by the results, while it tasted good... it just was not rice pudding.

I love rice pudding and I've been trying to make a respectable one for years.  I just made this and it far surpasses respectable.  The only thing I changed was that I used almost a cup of long grain rice instead of 3/4 because it was all that was left in my package.  It turned out wonderfully creamy.  I added the tsp of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg in the last step.  Fantastic!!!  Thanks Erica!!

Would actually give 3-1/2 stars but since I can't I will gladly round it up to 4 *(see update below). Couldn't have been easier to make but needs a bit more flavor for my taste (next time I'll add a couple of cinnamon sticks starting in step 2) & I liked the texture much better before I added the egg (which I tempered with a bit of the hot rice mixture first) so I'll leave that out next time, & I'm still undecided on the butter...! I'm not reducing any stars for the raisins (which I do not like in my rice pudding) because I know these are a matter of personal preference. I am thankful to have found a recipe easy enough for me to mess around with though!***Unfortunately I had to change my rating to a 2 star (down from 4) because after being in the refrigerator for a day it's just a thick glob without a whole lot of flavor (except for vanilla). I hafta throw this batch out & try again now!

This tastes exactly like my Grandmothers double broiler method.  I used skim milk (Grammy swears to use nothing less than 2%) and it turned out just fine.
I do like my rice pudding cold, and after cooling it is no longer creamy.  So I made a second time and reduced to 1 cup cooked rice and the rice still sucked up all the liquid.  I will just keep reducing the rice until I get the consistancy that I like.
Thank you very much for this recipe.  It is excellent.

First time I tried to make rice pudding and it came out delicious and creamy.  I used medium grain rice.  Followed the recipe and added one tiny spoon (comes in jar) of stevia at the end.

I used to HATE rice pudding, but this recipe have made me change my mind about rice pudding.  It's so good! I made it in class with my kids and they loved it!  It's cheap to make too! So it's a fun and cheap thing to make with your students.  I used cooked rice instead. Day old rice is okay too. =)

Well I totally messed this up and it was still awesome. No milk so I used fat free half & half - fine! No vanilla so I used 1/4 tsp almond extract - fine! No raisins so I used almond slivers - fine! I used jasmine rice and it's great. nomnomnom.

I'm 7 weeks pregnant and CRAVE rice pudding. I've used this recipe before and doubled it this morning. It will probably be gone by this evening. :)
I ended up using 3 cups cooked rice, 1/2 t salt, 3 cups milk, heaping 2/3 cup sugar, 1 egg, 1/2 t vanilla, and 1 T butter. I also cooked everything longer than recommended but that's because I'm paranoid about under-cooked egg.

Wow!!  This is great!!  Just like my Grandma used to make.  I've been trying to find something to come close to hers and I've finally found it.  As mentioned by others here, don't add the sugar too early.  Make sure the rice is cooked thoroughly, first.  Also, adding the butter during step 1 does make a richer pudding.  And it's always ggod practice to temper the egg mixture before adding it to the hot pudding. 
This is fantastic right off the stove (let it cool for a few minutes), cold from the fridge, or warmed up the next day.  Thanks for a keeper!!

Wonderful!  I used brown jasmine rice and skim milk and I thought it still turned out delicious.  White rice would be much less chewy but my kids don't know that and they loved it as it.

Very good basic recipe. Perfect for the beginning cook, such as myself. Ill definitely be making this again. Next time I'll use a tad less vanilla extract, as I thought the vanilla flavor was a little overpowering (my only complaint).

Takes a little time, but very easy, & fantastic flavor/creaminess.  As another reviewer suggested, I mixed some of the hot mixture into eggs, then incorporated them back into the hot mixture with no egg problems.

A great way to use up your leftover rice and can be made for breakfast or dessert.I followed the ingredients but my cooking procedure was different.What I did was I poured all of the milk,sugar,and salt into a saucepan and let it heat up for at least 5 minutes.Reserve 1/2 cup of the milk mixture for the eggs.Then I added the rice.I then added the raisins so they'll plump up with the rice.While that's thickening,I whisk together the eggs and the reserved milk until it's well-blended.Once the rice is nice and creamy,turn the stove off.Slowly add the egg mixture,then stir everything so it's all incorporated.This keeps the eggs from becoming scrambled.Cook for another 2 minutes,then add a dash of cinnamon before serving.I might leave out the raisins next time because my daughters didn't like them.This is a simple and delicious recipe.

My father in-law has had countless people attempt to make rice pudding that he likes (aunts, sister in-laws, co-workers, friends) and nothing even came close to his 'grans'... most of them he called 'garbage'.
I thought I'd give it a shot (and my only shot) with this recipe.
After tasting it, he said I was officially the family rice pudding maker.  He loved it... said it was the best he's ever had (second to his Grans').   I made it several times now and still loves it!
Thank you for sharing your recipe and making me his 'favorite daughter in-law'!

I've made this as directed, but this morning I found 1/2 cup of leftover cooked rice in the fridge and experimented with making rice pudding for one in the microwave. I simply cut the proportions in my head (though using a whole egg worked fine). I used my 4 cup pyrex measuring cup, and cooked the rice, milk, sugar & salt for on high for one minute at a time, stirring after each minute (3-4 minutes total). Then, I stirred some of the hot mixture into the beaten eggs first, to make sure I didn't cook the egg. After adding the egg & raisins back in, I cooked it just another 45 seconds or so, then added vanilla & butter.

A nice breakfast & diet friendly : )

I used basmati rice. I used two cups of rice in four cups of water. After it was done, I used three cups of milk and one cup of sugar until it was thick and creamy, then finished with the rest of the ingredients. I am NOT a rice pudding fan, but for some reason, this appealed to me and so I tried it. I AM IN LOVE. Thanks so much for sharing, you have an AWESOME recipe!

Delicious seasoning and flavor, but missing one star because it was a thinner and soupier than I'd like the first time I made it. A dash of corn starch thickens it right up though. Just try about half a tsp to start with and add more to get the consistancy you want while the rice is soaking into the milk and sugar.

This recipe was ok. The rice ( my fault) needed to be cooked longer. The rice turned out tasting somewhat bitter-- and the rasins. Probably won't make again.

I used jasmine rice as I was all out of the regular white rice and added some cinnamon and eliminated the raisins....very good!!!
We are a family of 5 with 3 boys and I needed to double the recipe to make more than one serving per person.

If I could give this more stars I would.  I've made this 4 times in the past 3 days!  The first time I used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1 1/2 cups skim milk.  The subsequent times I just used skim milk and it worked just fine.  I made some for my father and he cut some fresh strawberries on top and couldn't get enough of it.  I even made a batch using skim milk and Splenda and it still came out great.  I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe.  Thanks!!

My husband said it tastes just like his Nana's rice pudding.  When he was little he asked her how come her rice pudding tastes so good and she told him "Because I make it with love!".  That is what this rice pudding is!!!

I just happened to come along this recipe today and it  was AWESOME!!!!...I have only ever made rice pudding from a mix once before and it was nasty grainy and gross!  But this recipe was easyand it soooo creamy, reminds me of what my Grandma (nanny : )  )   would make.  I loved it!!!  This is definitely a keeper.  I read the reviews before making this and I did temper my eggs...This is a very important step that I hope everybody thinks to do..Also I made sure my rice was good and tender before adding the sugar.  Thank you previous reviewers for the great advice!  Awesome recipe!!!

Better than my childhood rice pudding, which seemed grainy/gritty. This is so creamy and smooth and the flavour is amazing...Thank you

I am on a sugar, dairy, and wheat free diet. So I made this recipe using brown rice and coconut milk. Instead of butter I used coconut oil. I also added unsweetened coconut shavings to compliment the coconut milk and used xylitol instead of regular sugar. This came out so delicious!!! This is definitly a good option for those who can't have white rice or sugar!

I didn't use raisins and it was still great. Very creamy and satisfying. And a great way to use up leftover rice. I used Arborio rice which might have helped with the creaminess.

Erica, this is so good. I made this as stated yesterday with the exception of raisins. I didn't have any. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to my bowl. Wow! It was so good that I made a triple batch. lol. I had planned on making fried rice but was so distracted by this awesome dish that I had make more for later. Thank you for posting a really easy recipe that is great warm or cold.

This was a good recipe, but be prepared. It is also super rich! The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was so rich, that I couldn't even eat more than 1 or 2 bites, and it was the same with most of my family.  So if you like rich desserts, this is for you!

Very good!  I added a little extra butter and it came out very good.  On top of it I also added brown sugar.  Delicious!  Only rated four cuz I needed the brown sugar to add an extra sweetness.  Will make again.

This is easy to make and delicous.    I have been making it with basmati brown rice but I keep all the proportions the same & make as directed.  Wonderful comfort food.   Thanks for posting.

This is an excellent recipe! The only change I make is to add cinnamon, because to me Rice Pudding just HAS to have cinnamon in it. :) (but that's just a personal preference...so it still gets 5 stars from me).

OH MY WORD! If you want know the KEY to getting that Kozy Shack, prepared pudding texture, here it is: THE RICE. You need to have short grained rice. And don't go to your store looking for " short grained rice" cause you won't find it. It's called Risotto or Arborio. It is a bit more expensive( I paid about $6 for 36oz tub)but so worth it. It's made to cook much creamier. Make this recipe with long grain it and it will be good, short grain it will be great, Risotto it will be AMAZING! I used 1/2 cup of Splenda and tasted it and felt it was sweet enough. Delicious even w/o sugar

Very nice recipe. I followed the basic idea, but kidna did my own thing. My husband wanted a really rich rice pudding, so I used heavy cream instead of milk. I also added real vanilla extract and some apple pie spice. It ended up being delicious and I will for sure be making it again! Perfect to warm you up after a cold winter day. :)

This is a great homeade Rice Pudding that is creamy. It turns thick if you refrigerate it so i recommend that if you are refrigerating it only use 1 cup of cooked rice in it.

This was the perfect way to use up my leftover Steamed White Rice from the other night! I doubled the recipe. So doubled the cooked rice amount to 3 cups, doubled the milk and used whole to make it creamier. I used 2 small eggs. Cooked it for the full 20 minutes before adding the milk/egg mixture. Added the butter and vanilla at the end but omitted the raisins and sprinkled with Pumpkin Spice, as suggested by some reviewers. Everyone LOVED it! We all wanted seconds. Except my 5 year old son, who wanted THIRDS!  ;) I will definitely keep this recipe in my arsenal! Thank you!!!  :)

Simple, excellent recipe. I use leftover rice (short or medium grain white is by far the best) and just from personal preference omit the butter and raisins, and sometimes reduce the sugar - but the recipe is delicious as is. Creamy and rich, and so much better than store bought.

I made this in the evening-- I felt like it was taking too long to get thick and added extra rice.  It turned out really well.  It has a great taste.  Next time I will follow the instructions better (no extra rice) to see if I can get it a little creamier.  Thanks!

Wonderfully easy rice pudding that tastes absolutely luscious. I find that using arborio rice is the best for recipes like these, it's very creamy itself. Watch cooking times when using this rice! Cooking time was cut nearly in half, so just keep a close eye on it. I too sprinkle a little cinnamon on top before serving. Thanks Erica, this has become a staple in my house, I'll cook it up just to eat for dinner sometimes :)

Great flavor. Easy to make. I am lazy and hate to do more dishes so I just cooked the rice in 3c milk from the begining. I  also ommited the butter by accident and didnt realize it until now but like I said it tasted great anyway! Definitely temper the eggs first. Great consistency.

This came out perfect on the first try. I followed the recipe but used some common sense: my rice was short grain brown, and wasn't going to cook in the time given, so I just cooked the portion until the water was absorbed. Then I stirred the milk, sugar and salt in together and cooked *until it was creamy*! I blended my beaten egg into the remaining milk, and drizzled into rice while stirring (no problems). Added the rest of the ingredients and presto! Perfection. So, I think that my rule is make sure you have reached the desired results before going on to the next step. That avoids problems in the end and having to find shortcuts to accommodate the error.

I am scared I am going to eat all four servings of this recipe by myself-delicious! The best rice pudding I have ever made and/or eaten. I left out the raisins because I am not a fan and used 1% milk because that's what I had and the recipe didn't specify that it needed to be any particular milk. I used jasmine rice because I love it. Fantastic!

Oh my God! Best rice pudding recipe ever!!!!! I just made it not thinking anything of it, I was a bit worried about my rice actually because I'm using a gas range and I'm not used to making rice like that. Anyway, it came out awesome!!!! I didn't use vanilla or cinnamon  or nutmeg this time because I didn't have any and I used light brown sugar instead of white and only used a tiny bit. Anyway, it came out perfect, thank you so much for this recipe!

This is the best Rce Pudding I have ever had.  For those who wonder why 2 pans, because of the rice that sticks to the bottem of the first pan.  This will get rid of the any stuck or burnt flavoring. I did not use sugar but condensed milk, that is the only change I made. I give it 5 stars for taste, ease of making, and appearance.  Thank you.

Thank you so much for sharing this! I made it for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it and told me to add it to my permanent recipe collection. I used Jasmine rice, skim milk and added a bit more vanilla. Also, I omitted the use of the second saucepan, and just used the one. My boyfriend asked me to not use raisins, so I didn't and it was still sweet, creamy, fast and easy! I served it warm sprinkled with cinnamon, slivered almonds and shaved coconut. Delicious!

I loved this recipe. It was easy and tasted amazing.  Followed the steps and amounts to the letter; however,  I did soak the raisins in 2 Tbs rum while the rice was cooking and thought it was a wonderfully successful addition.  (I'm probably not the first......I only read a few of the reviews.) Also, used the same pot as one reviewer suggested. Definitely sprinkle with cinnamon!

This is my absolute favorite rice pudding, ever.  I use variations at times, with or without raisins, adding cinnamon, sometimes even dried cranberries.  No matter what I do, it's absolutely FANTASTIC!

This is a great recipe.  If you are dairy sensitive like most members of my family do not worry.  I made this with vanilla soy milk and it came out creamy and delicious.  I added a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon.  It had the perfect sweetness and creaminess.

This tasted more like a rice custard dessert than the typical rice pudding to which I am used to eating. Also, it wasn't very sweet. I would easily double the sugar needed, especially if not adding raisins (for added sweetness). Overall, this is a good basic recipe that definitely tastes better than anything you could find store bought. I will probably look for another recipe but, in the meantime, would be willing to try this again.

OMG! What more can I say! I adore the rice pudding they serve at work in the cafeteria. This is better than that! It tastes great,even without the raisins. I also like to add a bit of cinnamon &/or cinnamon sugar on top. Talk about comfort food!

I made a double batch following the exact recipe, and it turned out really well. It took almost 30 minutes to thicken because I started with cold, leftover rice. Keep stirring, and it WILL thicken up. Great recipe. Not too sweet. The raisons add a sweet bite every now and again. Yummy!!

I made them today and they were very delicious!  I've been wanting to make rice pudding for a long time and am so glad I've found this recipe.  They are so simple to make.  I used my rice cooker to make the rice and it was fine.  (29 June)  I tried using skimmed milk to make it - was not as tasty - as expected.  It's still okay to eat so this may be an option if you're trying to cut down on some calories.

First time making rice pudding, and it turned out excellent.  I did not have any issues with it being too thin or too sweet.  I used 1% milk and splenda mix, and replaced the raisins with craisins.  Even my boyfriend raved about it, AND ate all the left overs.  One thing I did learn?   Make a double batch!!!

The pudding is quick and simple, but I must stress that the instructions must be complete. My daughter found this recipe, and even on medium-low to low, the rice-milk-sugar-salt mixture continued to scorch. Following my instincts, I stirred constantly until thick and smooth. If you let the milk stand in the pan for even a few minutes, it will burn. Stir constantly!

I've been trying different rice pudding recipies for nearly a year now , trying to get the perfect pud. I double the ingredients, substituting a can of evaporated milk for the same volume of milk and adding a large pinch of nutmeg. I use large dried thompson raisins chop them up and soak them in homemade vanilla essence (vodka and ground vanilla) plus the sugar and some of the milk whilst the rice is cooking. Perfect pudding!!!!!!! :D

This is really tasty. I used left over rice, and it was sweet and creamy. I left out the raisins, and took the advice to add the sugar after the rice cooked in the milk, and it was very warm and comforting.

I tried this recipe after have a sweet mango rice at a local Thai restaurant.  I tripled the recipe and added a half cup of coconut milk at the end.  I sliced up a ripe mango and voila!  It was excellent!  Thanks for the perfect recipe!  BTW, it is a little rough on the arms with all the stirring, but well worth the workout!

OMG. This is insane good. Like best rice pudding I've had EVER. I used half 2% milk, half heavy cream and I cooked the raisins with the second cooking, to plump up the raisins. I also added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg. This is heaven. Very simple to make. Even I, who can mess up rice like mad, this was foolproof. Heaven. Just heaven.

Good, solid, rice pudding recipe. A few tips: 1)quick rice is ok if you don't have time for the slow cook variety. 2)salt your rice in the water 3)temper your eggs before adding to the hot milk/rice mixture. Do this by adding a little of the hot milk to your eggs to bring up the temperature. If you don't, you may wind up with scrambled eggs in your pudding. 4)Use evaporated milk for cooking and baking; it's creamier and makes for smoother baked goods and cream sauces. 5)season with sugar after you get the pudding to the right consistency.   For a grown up "kick", soak your raisins in brandy, drain and then add to your pudding.  Good winter dish!

This was really good! I used skim milk, which meant it had to cook a little longer. I also only used 1 1/2 cups, I didn't need to add the extra 1/2 cup at the end, it would have made it too watery. I mixed in some cinnamon instead of raisins and it was delicious!

Absolutely delicious!  I made a homemade rice pudding years ago and it was not so good but this one is perfect.  I only used 1 1/2 cps. milk and added some cinnamon.  My only complaint is that I didn't make a double batch!!!

This was my first experience making rice pudding and I definitely had fun with it.  Per other reviews, I went with the medium grain rice which worked very well.  The first time I made this recipe it turned out a little too liquid, so the second time I made it, I eyeballed the milk a little more instead of following an exact measurement.  My hub loved it, especially with honey and cinnamon.  It was sweet enough for me without the honey, but I also enjoyed it with the cinnamon.

I made this pudding during Ramadan for Suhoor (predawn meal) I have been looking for a nice creamy rice pudding recipe. this is and was a winner. My husband requested again. The only thing was i made it with basmati rice i think it would probably be better with Uncle Ben's or a more fatter grain of rice. I just had to cook it a little longer. but it turn out really well.

This works very well with soy milk too! It's still very creamy that way, and there's no strange taste to it; you wouldn't know that it wasn't real milk. (I used Silk Brand, which isn't overly sweet but has a little of its own vanilla flavor too.) I used to think I didn't like rice pudding (the idea scared me when I was a kid for no good reason) but after trying a bit in a restaurant, I wanted to make my own, and this was wonderful.

Well, holy cow!  Could a recipe have more ratings?  Will one more even matter?  Definitely try this one.  I doubled the recipe and accordingly it took longer, but it was well worth it.  And I didn't even have raisins!  But I did have nutmeg, which I highly recommend using.  Will use this recipe any time I've got additional rice.

This rice pudding was extremely yummy and super creamy.  Couple things: Do NOT add the sugar until you have added the 1 1/2 cups of milk with the cooked rice and warmed them together in a sauce pan for a couple of minutes.  Also I would add another one or two tablespoons of sugar.  Other than that it turned out wonderful.  My husband doesn’t care for rice pudding but after trying this recipe he loves it! :o)

Absolutely wonderful, and so easy. I probably make it once a week now, using 1/2 cup of Splenda instead of sugar, and an extra 1/2 cup of milk.  Delicious warm or cold!

This was my first attempt at making rice pudding.  I was looking for a cheap dessert and I have to say that it was AMAZING.  I made it with long grain brown rice, half reconstituted nonfat powdered milk and half skim milk, and I used regular raisins.  After reading the reviews, I was afraid with all of the changes, especially the long grain brown rice, that it wasn't going to turn out right but boy was I wrong!  It took longer than the 15-20 minutes to thicken up, but I wasn't surprised with the brown rice.  I mixed in a little cinnamon with the vanilla and butter and WOW.  So good I was licking the spoon!

Just like I remember as a child!  I skipped the raisins on personal preference.  I have made this with skim milk, 1% milk, and combinations including half and half - it always works!  Also, be sure to incorporate your eggs by slowly adding a little of the hot rice/milk to the beaten eggs while stirring before adding the whole mixture into the hot pot. This will keep your eggs from cooking into little bits!

I've feel it's important to rate a recipe after several attempts, and I'm not disappointed.  I've made my best batch when sugar was decreased to a little less than 1/4 cup.  As suggested, I added salt to the water for cooking the rice and made everything in the same pot.  Once done, I seasoned with cinnamon, nutmeg, and about 1/8t of fresh ground/crushed cardamom.  Great flavor and creamy texture yet not too sweet!

Great recipe. Followed advice about lowering temp before adding egg in order for it not to cook and form eggs bits. Also ommitted raisins for personal preference. Doubled vanilla for strong flavor. Cooked the salt in with the rice.

This was great.  I was apprehensive to try it.  I have had a couple botched rice pudding attempts in my past.  This is simple and delicious.  I omitted the butter and raisins, but added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. I also followed some suggestions about when to add sugar and cooking times. Next time I will increase the sugar from 1/3 c. to 1/2 c.( I like sweet)  This was yummy and definatly a keeper!

This is the first rice pudding recipe I used from this site, several years ago and it is still one of my favorites.  It is easy to make and just the right amount.  I love eating it warm with raisins stirred in and a sprinkle of cinnamon on top.  Delish!

I have never eaten rice pudding before this recipe, and honestly didn't think I would like it.  I just wanted to use up the extra rice from yesterdays dinner.  But, after eating this delicious treat, I am making extra rice everytime I make it just so I can have an excuse to make this!  Just make sure you make it with whole milk.  I made is twice.  Once with whole milk and once with fat free milk. The one with whole milk was rich and creamy and just perfect.  Not so much for the fat free milk one.  Follow this recipe to a tee, and sprinke some cinnamon on it, and you got heaven in a bowl.

YUMMY!!!! This was delicious and simple to make! I was short on milk so I substituted 1 cup of milk with half and half, which only added to the creamy goodness. I omitted the raisins (not a fan) and added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, heaven! If you like rice pudding make this recipe.

The only thing we didn't LOVE about this recipe was that we found it slightly too sweet. Next time I make it I will use 1/4 cup of sugar. I also added cinnamon. Great recipe! :D

Homemade rice pudding is a comfort food from heaven... and I’m thankful for this simple way to make it. This is the recipe I have been searching for and the best way to make use of that left over rice sitting in the fridge. Using Arborio rice makes for the creamiest of puddings. I use brown sugar (instead of white) as it has a richer taste. Even more decadent is using maple syrup to sweeten it. My one child loves it with raisins and cinnamon and my other likes it plain with a dollop of tart raspberry jam on top. Served warm or cold, this recipe is so versatile and always delicious. Thanks so much for sharing, Erica.

this wasn't as good as kozy shack because it was chewy chewy not gooey chewy, if you know what i made.

the changes i made:
SKIM MILK 
LONG GRAIN WHITE RICE
CINNAMON
2 EGGS, not One.

AND ON TOP:
HONEY & SLIVERED ALMONDS

this is the best rice pudding i've made at home, but will probably continue to buy, haha.

Definitely a good recipe, but I would suggest using your standard California raisins and not golden.  Additionally, I added a little nutmeg and cinnamon, which really helped the flavor.  Lastly, some people have said it needs a little more sugar--I agree but added a few tablespoons of maple syrup instead which really turned out fantastic.

The best pudding i've ever made- hands down.  I did like one of the previous commenters did and added an extra egg and exchanged a half cup of table cream for the last half cup of milk in the recipe.  This is fabulous- great way to use left over rice!!

Wow, I love rice pudding, but this was even better than I expected.  It was wonderfully creamy with just the right amount of sweetness.  I did cheat a little, though, and added an extra beaten egg because I like that "custard" taste so much.  Absolutely fabulous, I think I'll make it again tonight so we can have it for breakfast in the morning (that ought to get the kids out of bed!)

I try to make "healthier" versions of recipes I choose.  I replaced the:  white rice with brown, white sugar with "Sugar in the Raw", cow's milk with soy (milk), and omitted the raisins - and I tell you . . . it STILL tasted the way I think Rice Pudding SHOULD taste. It was GOOD!

I made this rice pudding today...I doubled the recipe and I am here to tell you it is AWESOME.  When I was cooking it for 20 minutes like the recipe calls for, I didn't think the pudding would thicken up like the recipe said it would but IT DID...it tastes absolutely out of this world.  If you like rice pudding and even if you wonder if you do, you will LOVE this recipe...it's really easy to make...don't have to change a thing either..cook it up just like the recipe tells you to...It's a definite keeper for sure.

As my husband said, the flavor is dead on, but it wasn't creamy enough -- we like it cold and it dried out. So next time I'll add some heavy cream and another egg and see what happens.

I just made this for my kids.  We loved it.  As with bread pudding I think whole milk is the key. I was looking for a sause pan style rice pudding because this is the way I have had it in the south.  I used brown rasins, and "raw" cane sugar.  I think that the raw sugar adds a deeper (not so sweet)flavor.  Again the same is true for bread pudding.  Cheers......... Joe

This is really good and creamy. I've made it a few times and like other reviewers have stated, the 20 minutes in the first cooking stage to cook the rice isn't enough. When I did that the first time it was a little crunchy. Now I cook it for 30 minutes and add just a touch more water, and now it's great. Also when you add the egg, mix it with the milk (when you add the milk at the end) and that will prevent the egg from making scrambled eggs.
Sometimes I use half milk and 1/2 half and half or cream to make it even creamier. 
It's delicious and easy and I usually always have the ingredients, so it makes for a nice treat once in a while!

This recipe is great!  I found it one night when trying to figure out what to do with all that leftover chinese takeout white rice.  Its great, because sticky rice is perfect in this recipe.  I've determined 2 things about this...one, you can easily half the whole recipe and it still comes out great.  The second thing is if you choose to serve it warm, which I do, adding an extra egg makes it really rich and creamy and slightly more custard like.  Also, I used all our leftover milk products - fat free half and half, light cream, heavy cream, 1% milk - together to make the 2 cups and it was still fantastic!

I really liked this.  It was very simple to make.  I make recipes from this website all the time, and I find that sometimes I get caught up in everyone else's suggestions and end up reviewing my "altered" recipe.  My suggestion is to try this how it is written first, and then make your changes.  It really wonderful if made exactly as written.  Thank you for a keeper!

I am a huge fan of rice pudding and this recipe is great! I used leftover Chinese white rice, because I am not the world’s best rice-maker! It saved a lot of time and turned leftovers into an amazing dessert! The first time I made it I didn’t feel it was thick enough so I cooked it on medium a little longer than it called for. Once I took it off the stove and let it sit the rice absorbed more than I would have liked. So the second time I made it and took it off the stove after 20 minutes, still a little soupy. After it sat it was much more creamy, and kept better over night. I sprinkled cinnamon on top. Serve warm or cold. It was a hit both ways! Thanks.

This is delicious.  I know even really like rice pudding but I make it for my husband.  I did what other reviews said and replace the first 1 1/2 cups of milk with evaporated milk, I also used instant rice. I can't stop eating it. Also the cinnamon is a must. I will be making this again.

This recipe is simple and delicious.  I omitted the egg and added a little extra vanilla and cinnamon.  It tastes great warm or cold.  I just made this again and added Craisins instead of raisins - delicious!

Delicious!
I used jasmine rice, 3 parts whole milk and 1 part heavy cream, and generously dashed cinnamon to give it a little pizazz.

I had some leftover rice from chinese takeout so i skipped the first part of the recipe--my pudding didn't firm up either, probably because i didn't want to wait, so i added some small grain tapioca (about 2 tablespoons) and it turned out perfect.  Will definitely have a new recipe for my leftover rice!!!

This recipe is awesome!  To make it even richer and creamier I substituted carnation milk instead of regular milk.

This is a great recipe for rice pudding, but I made it with a creamier taste, hence the 5 stars, because where I was supposed to add the milk, I added in the first batch of milk 1 1/2 c. of evaporated milk, then the remaining 1/2 c. of milk I used regular whole milk.  Came out beautifully. But try the evaporated milk, you'll love it!

Very good recipe!!  I too used brown sugar instead of white (just preference) and I increased the vanilla to 1 tsp.  Most of the reviews mentioned warnings about the egg scrambling, I added the egg to the 1/2 c of milk and then using the hot mixing spoon, I added it to the pudding with success.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I often use soy milk and it tastes wonderful.  My family likes it without raisins and it's also great tasting.  Excellent.  Makes the whole house smell like you've slaved over the hot oven all day when it really only took about 30 minutes.  Great way to use leftover rice.

This was pretty good.  I will leave out the egg next time.  It tasted great and just like I expected and then I added the egg.  Definitely nothing wrong with the taste, just not my preference.  Also, I did add a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon and also some lemon rind.  My Spanish homestay mom always added fresh lemon and orange rind (about 2 1/2 inch strips of each).  It really makes it special.

fantastic recipe. i left out the vanilla by accident and it's still beautiful. especially good with nutmeg. i tried using soy milk instead of regular milk, unfortunately it does not really work out very well since the pudding does not get thicker or cream (i think). after ten minutes of medium heat, there wasn't any thickening, so i added a half cup of whole milk and then the pudding really started to take off.

I think it's one of those no fail recipes because it's so easy and so fast to make. I'm sure it's best with short grain (pudding) rice but I made it with long grain and it was fine.

After a few months of cooking what everybody else wants, I will treat myself to warm rice pudding.  (No one else here likes rice!)  This recipe, by far, is the best that I have tried yet.  It makes a very comforting and rich rice pudding.  I would suggest, however that you use only half the sugar--you could add more individually if you like.  Also, do temper your egg before adding so you won't get scrambly bits.  Excellent recipe.

I had the strangest craving for rice pudding when I was pregnant (strange because I truly do not like rice pudding) and so I found this recipe and whipped it up.  It is delicious!  I have long since had my baby, but this recipe continues to be just as yummy as it was the first time.

I made this with brown rice; it was good, though I found the consistency to be a little gluey when it was cooled. But that may have been because of the brown rice, which has a different consistency than that of white rice and is chewier. 
Anyways, I added more milk and that helped a little.
I would have given it maybe three stars, but my two younger siblings both loved it. So four it is.

Oh my gosh this is so good!  If I could have given it more than 5 stars I would have.  This is so easy to make.  The only thing that I did different in this recipe is I did not add the raisons because I don't like them.  This is a great recipe!:)

This is the best, quickest rice pudding I've ever tasted.  The texture was wonderfully creamy - not hard to make at all!  I like nutmeg in mine, but didn't have any on hand.  I took another cooks suggestion and added some cardamom and a little cinnamon.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was wonderful rice pudding.  It definitely helps to mix the eggs with some milk before adding... I had no problems with clumping.  So tasty and creamy!  We used arborio rice.

It's awesome.  So creamy and rich.  I used skim milk and omitted the butter, and it turned out fine.  I also used dates instead of raisins, because that is what I had on hand.  They were a little strong, but overall it was amazing.

I LOVE this pudding!  I have never made (or had) rice pudding before, but I really wanted to try it.  I chose this recipe because of the high reviews and was not disappointed!  (It made more than 1 1/2 cups of rice though.)  It turned out so creamy and rich.  LOVE it!  I will make this over and over again. **** Made this again using cooked brown rice and it was just as good, if not better!

Oh, this is wonderful, had it for dinner - creamy, filling and comforting. Like the Kesari Pudding which I adore (using semolina) and similar to farina pudding, I did this the same way. I doubled the batch; melted the butter in the pot and adding about 1/3 cup chopped pecans (no raisins at hand) until fragrant and then covering the rice with it b4 doing the rest as per recipe. I used evaporated milk (not condensed), jasmine rice, dashes of nutmeg and cinnamon and also brown sugar; such a comfort food. Thanks very much Erica. Luscious. Oh, and the reviews helped much too, thanks all.

Pretty good. A word of warning if you make this with leftover rice that was cooked with salt, leave out the salt when you make the pudding. I didn't think about that when I  made the puuding tonight. Other than being a bit too salty, the pudding was very good. Soft and creamy, not hard and dry like many baked rice puddings.

I am a rice pudding fanatic and this pudding is sooo good!  I used one can of evaporated milk to mix in the cooked rice and finished it with a little more than a half cup of whole milk.  I noticed after I had put it in the fridge to chill that I forgot to add the melted butter, but that didn't take away from the taste.  The only thing I would change when I make it again is to use a little less rice....but that's not a flaw in the recipie, just my personal preference.  I am so glad I found this recipie!  Next time I make it I may add some cardamom pods and slivered almonds to give it a more Middle Eastern feel.  Thanks Erica!

This was a big hit in my house.  I made it for my mom when she was going through radiation and could only eat bland things.  She loved it so much she told everyone at the cancer center about it and I ended up making some for the patients there also.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This receipe is great!  I have spent the last 10 years looking for a creamy rice pudding that would rival the ones you find in diners and here it is!  I used leftover Chinese white rice for this and it was perfect!  Cudos to Erika!

This was a wonderful recipe to make.  The only thing is that I improvised by doubling it, and baking it for 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven, to cook off some of the milk.  Unfortunately, I couldn't serve it warm, but it was still a big hit at Thanksgiving!  Thank you!

I used arborio rice and omitted the raisins, otherwise I followed this recipe exactly.  I usually prefer tapioca pudding, but now am a rice pudding fan!  It was creamy and delicious...just wonderful on a cold night.  My toddler had it for her bedtime snack and loved it, too!

Just add my 5 star review to the 300+ already here.  When you've got leftover rice you make rice pudding.  When you make rice pudding this should be the recipe you choose.  The only addition I made was a tablespoon of real maple syrup. A terrific recipe, so easy that a child could make it.  Wonderful old-fashioned flavor.  This one is a keeper.

This is a DELICIOUS recipe for rice pudding.  Make sure you use unsalted butter - the first time I made it I used salted butter, and it turned out too salty.

Yum!  Pudding was awesome!  I had to made another pan today, since what I made yesterday was devoured!  I added a little more milk so it would be more creamy once it cooled. I would suggest you MAKE A DOUBLE BATCH, this stuff went pretty fast around here!  Great recipe, thank you!

We loved this. I added 1/4 teaspoon each of cinnamon & nutmeg and it came out just right.
I have made it several times using diffent kinds of milk (nonfat, lowfat & whole milk). they were all good but whole milk was best, with 1/2 cup of half & half or cream mixed in at the end instead of milk.

This was really yummy! I never had rice pudding before and this was delicious and very easy to make. I used regular raisins because that's all I had, and added a bit of cinnamon. My 2 year old nephew loved it, too. Defiately a keeper. Thanks.

This was really creamy and delicious!  I have had a taste for rice pudding and this hit the spot.  I made it lower in fat by using egg substitute, skim milk and NO butter.  It still turned out perfect.  I think I will add a little bit more sugar and maybe a little more vanilla next time.  I also did not add any raisins(prefer it without them).  I might also add a dash of cinnamon too.  Overall, wonderful recipe that is easy to make and delicious!!!  Thanks Erica!

May I say how much I and my family loved this recipe!?! Wonderful! Truly!  Using Jasmine rice in our rice steamer/cooker - it was a piece of cake from there.  It was simple easy and produced such a fantastic comfort food "like mom used to make" response from the entire family! Especially from my love as his mom made him rice pudding frequently - I got a thumbs up and requests for more! Can't beat that!

I thought this recipe was ok, it had a nice, simple taste. I prefer my rice pudding sweeter, so I added some sweetened condensed milk, and a bash of cinnamon, it gave the rice pudding the extra spark it needed. But overall I enjoyed eating and making it because it was simple to make.

this was yummy,but it was more like "creamy rice" than "creamy rice pudding".It needs less rice/more milk, and maybe not the egg.It got very firm as it cooled down,almost solid.I'll add more  cinnamon & nutmeg too.I was looking for more of a custard/pudding texture.

I made this using powder milk. That may be why it took so long to thicken for me. In any case, I just left it to simmer in a really thick sauce pan, stirring every minute or so, and it finally did thicken, but only after about 1 hour. It was worth the wait - I loved it! I had just made a chocolate cake the day before, and so I used about 1/2 cup of the crumbs to spread over the top. YUM!

Excellent rice pudding!  I omitted the raisins and made it as low fat as possible with skim milk and half the butter and it was still outstanding!  I can just imagine how good it would be made with whole milk and all the butter.  I will definitely make this again.

Delicious!! As other reviewers suggested I let the egg and milk come to room temperature. Mixed them together and added some of the warm pudding. Mixed it well and slowly added it to the pot. Otherwise followed the instructions. This is now my go to rice pudding 
Thank you Erica

This recipe is wonderful, thanks so much for sharing this, Erica!  I just made it tonight and my two teens ate it all up immediately; it was that good!  I used long grain rice (making sure it is cooked fully in the first step) and had no trouble at all.  I kept having to turn down the heat while cooking down the milk & sugar so it wouldn't cook too quickly.  Mixing the beaten egg into the milk just prior to adding it is a step in similar recipes, so I did that here too.  The results were better than expected and smelled heavenly too.  A real keeper!

Seriously delicious!  I've made this twice now and it's my new favorite dessert!  Yum!  The first time I made it, I cooked the rice and made it exactly as directed. It was perfect.  The second time, we had a whole box of left over rice from Chinese take out.  I said "what the heck" and used it.  It was great!  Delicious! Thank you for this recipe!

Thank you Erica for sharing this recipe!  This was so delicious and fool-proof.  It was similar to the one my Grandfather used to make, that no one has been able to duplicate.  Thank you.  We added 1 Tbsp of ground cinnamon, instead of 1 tsp, because that's how my family always made it- other than that, we followed your recipe exactly.  Thank you.  Thank you.  
"It was really, really good.  We need to send our friends a bowl-ful." my little five-year old daughter said, she helped to make your recipe.

I love rice pudding but I prefer a "more pudding -less rice"  pudding .This recipe has that great old fashioned  rice pudding taste but for me was a bit heavy on the rice .The only changes I made was using  1 cup cooked long grain rice rather than the 1 1/2  called for in the recipe and I don't care for raisins so this were left out . Turned out fantastic !

We tried to recreate my grandmother's recipe. She was in hospice and couldn't recall her recipe, nor had it ever been written down. After having all the family, including her, taste it. We all agreed this was almost identical. So yummy! This will be our entire family's go to at holidays, in her loving memory.

This is the most delicious rice pudding I've ever had. It's easy to make, even for me!(I'm 12). I used short grain white rice,and it tastes amazing. Even though I cooked the rice a bit long, and ran out of milk (I had to use a 1/2 cup of half and half), it tastes amazing. The reason the person who made the recipe with brown rice didn't have it turn out was because you can't use brown rice! It won't have the same flavor! I highly recommend this recipe for a quick and easy treat.

This is my first time leaving a review.  Let me start of by saying I am NOT a cook by any means and this was easy and turned out awesome! I ordered a bunch of Chinese food I had delivered during this cold winter and received way to much white rice so I found this easy recipe and got cooking.  I used the already cooked white rice from the night before and followed the recipe exactly because like I said I'm not a cook.  I did however leave out the raisins and that is only because I did not have them already.  OMG this turned out amazing and was so simple!! I have 2 more cartons of rice left which I will be using to make at least 1 more batch of rice pudding with the raisins this time. Thanks!!

I made an Indian  version of it!! Sooo delicious. Used Jasmin Rice, added 1 tablespoons of organic coconut oil instead of butter, in the final mix I stirred a 1/4 teaspoon of garam masala (spice mixture ), and still sprinkled cinnamon on top!! This is fantastic!

This is delicious rice pudding. I used cooked jasmine rice and dark raisins since they were what I had in the fridge. I beat the egg with the 1/2 cup of milk and when the hot mixture was cooked I tempered the egg mixture with a little of the it, beating it so as to not curdle it. Then I added the egg mixture back into the hot mixture mixing rapidly.

For anyone that has an issue with the chunky egg, the key is to add small amounts of the hot rice to the egg and stirring to slowly warm it before adding it to the rest of the rice. Love this recipe. Very simple and very tasty.

What a fabulous recipe!  I made this to serve 40+.  Followed the recipe exactly, except that I did as others and used only the one pot, both for the trial at home for my husband and myself and for the 40+ at our Senior Center - although next time I'd split it off in to two pots rather than the one - because it got too thick at the bottom of the pot. When reheating, it definitely requires more milk to return it to a desirable consistency but the quality remains the same.  I've detested Rice Pudding but once I tasted this pudding, I kept taking another spoonful, and another spoonful and ....

Really, really good. Delicious. I only did two things my own way, I was in a rush, so I used instant rice and it worked perfectly like regular rice. And 2nd, I add the milk and egg together and when the rice was getting thick, I took some of the liquid from it and tempered the eggs. Ended up with no eggy parts! It's really good for beginners or experienced cooks!

Awesome recipe - I used lowfat milk instead of whole milk and the only difference was more time stirring when all of the ingredients were mixed.  I also added about a 1/2 tablespoon of ground cinnamon. GREAT dessert.  I haven't had home made in over 20 years! Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe so much! My grandma used to make rice pudding when I was little and I could never find a recipe even close to it until I found this recipe. I do add cinnamon and a bit of brown sugar and it becomes my grandmas recipe. Thanks so much for sharing Erica.

Awesome! I'm not terribly handy in the kitchen so I wish it had said that the milk should actually be bubbling (So often you're supposed to go just below boiling but was a natural consequence of medium heat so I went with it) and given that there were bad reviews where the eggs had bits cook I tempered the eggs. For all I know I shouldn't have and it would have magically been even better. Wouldn't have been able to if my girlfriend hadn't been able to tell me what it was called so I could look up how to do it. :/ I was too lazy to use two pans, which didn't seem to matter. So yeah, great recipe, especially if you don't need as much explained to you as I did. :)

My husband has been asking me to make rice pudding for years.  It was something his mother made when he was a kid that he really wanted again.  I did changed it up a little and used craisins and added about a tablespoon of cinnamon.  He was very happy and ate so much of it that I doubt he'll be asking for it again any time soon.

The first time I made this recipe I used long grain rice because it was the only kind I had in the house and it was very good. Recently I bought some Arborio rice (short grain) and it was even better! It turned out alot creamier! And I also used one of the previous suggestions of adding the sugar at the same time as the egg and there wasn't a tough grain of rice at all. I also added some cinnamon (to me rice pudding isnt the same without it lol) Definitely will be making this again and again!

I really like this recipe because you can change it up to make it how you like it.  I used one cup of almond vanilla (unsweetened)milk with one cup of 2% milk.  omitted raisins and added cinnamon.  Everyone loved this.  We made it about 3 times in two days.

I have made this several times for my husband who was never rice pudding fan. He loves this specific rice pudding recipe. Instead of raisins I chop dried apricots. It is so good!

This recipe is amazing!  After reading the reviews I took Shaz's advice and sat the glass bowl with the beaten egg in warm water. I also used leftover cooked rice from dinner, and used heavy whipping cream as the 1/2 cup of added milk..came out wonderful!  My 14 year old is very particular about rice pudding as it is his favorite and he loved it:). First time ever attempting Rice Pudding, I have a feeling this will be a recurring request!  Thank you!!!!

I followed directions on how to make this and it ended up soaking up all the liquid which made it not like rice pudding at all.

Please mention in the directions what kind of white rice to use- there are many kinds (short, medium, and long grain).

So good! I left out the raisins or my guy wouldn't touch it, but other than that kept to the recipe. Really yummy warm with cinnamon/sugar sprinkled on top. Can't wait to see how good it is cold.

My "go to" recipe! Won't ever need to find a different one.  I use half milk and half heavy cream for a richer end result. Add a nice dollop of home made whipped cream on the top about ten minutes after it's ready and you're family sings your praises the rest of the day!

pretty good recipe, although I did not think there was a need for two pans.  I just added the milk once the water was mostly absorbed.  I also put a cinnimon stick in with the water and took it out once the water & milk had been absorbed.

This was an incredibly easy recipe, and it was absolutely delicious.  I will never buy store-made rice pudding again.  I used medium grain rice and cooked it in the rice cooker.  I also mixed the beaten egg in with the final addition of milk before pouring it into the hot mixture.  Viola no scrambled egg problem.  My entire family loved it!

I've been making this recipe for my kids for years--they LOVE it.  I make it with brown rice, whole milk, a tad less sugar and a little extra butter. It's a breakfast dish I make for my kids...  healthy and keeps them full.

My first time making rice pudding and it came out great.  I omitted the raising as we're not big fans.  I was a little nervous as I only had coconut milk on hand but it turned out fine!

My husband is being treated for cancer, during the treatments he developed a bad case of Thrush.  He could hardly eat anything. Nothing taste good to him.  I was pulling my hair out trying to find something that appealed to him when I ran across this recipe.  I did modify it a bit. For obvious reasons I left out the raisins(choking hazard) and for the 1/2 cup of milk I subbed half and half.  I beat the eggs into the half and half and then tempered it with the hot mixture before pouring it into the hot rice and milk.(This is for Jackie, I did this to keep the egg from curdling like yours) The results was a beautiful, creamy rice pudding that my husband was able to enjoy. Thank you Erica G. This is going into my recipe file to be made again and again.

Whipped this up during my lunch break in preparation for a "Comfort Food" dinner party. Doubled the recipe and achieved a perfectly creamy and balanced rice pudding. Added ample raisins (red) and a DASH OF RUM at the sugar/salt stage to allow PLUMPING time (oh, so luscious). Upon reheating, I will add the butter -- or allow the guests to add a slim pat at their discretion and cross my fingers they will! 

Save this to your box, ladies and gents, and teach it to your children. A worthy staple recipe for "wow" on a shoestring. 

TIP: Combine the beaten egg to the milk before adding to the recipe at the end to avoid any unpleasant scrambling of the egg!

This recipe is simple and delicious. Definitely tempered the egg to avoid scrambled eggs. Also heated the last .5 cup of milk before adding because I think sometimes adding a cold liquid to a thickened hot pot can turn the product a little pasty/ gummy. Wow!! Thanks for the awesome recipe.

Made it just as written with some leftover long grain rice and 2% milk.  It was great!  It took the entire 20 minutes to get the rice and milk mixture creamy, and then I just stirred vigorously when I added the egg, milk and raisin mixture and continued to stir till it was almost the right creamy consistency.  Turned off the heat and left it on the stove to cool while we ate dinner, then ate it warm afterwards with a little sprinkle of fresh nutmeg.  My picky husband and chef son both loved it, and it was so easy to make.

This recipe was FAN-TAS-TIC! Absolutely delicious. Actually, it is a habit in my family to add cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, and star anise. I highly suggest doing this if you enjoy a warm cinnamon-y taste.

Delicious! I used 1% milk (all I had in the fridge) and the recipe was still very creamy.  I also added some brown sugar, maple sugar, and powdered ginger, because I like rice pudding a bit sweeter.  Really easy recipe to follow, definitely will make again.

This is a great and easy recipe.  Like others i only used one sauce pan. I used cream instead of milk for a more decadent version. Added some cinnamon along with the vanilla. Yum.

Awesome recipe! I read reviews about not using the long grain rice but I couldn't help myself. I wanted rice pudding so badly and it was all I had. It was very creamy. Also I used truvia instead of sugar. I will definitely be making again. Sorry for the modifications :)

I made this last night. IT's was just wonderful. My finicky mom even loved it. Just to add some comments, add 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/3 cup, if you don't like too much sweets and little less salt in the boiling water. Thank you for the recipe.  Great pudding~

SUPER GOOD.  This is a sure-fire recipe, it worked great and tasted creamy.  Add the egg SLOWLY and stir constantly.  I followed the directions exactly but used dark raisins.

Oh, my! This is SO good! Love the light creamy flavor. I followed a few other reviewers suggestions: I made sure my rice was cooked to tender before I added it to the milk/sugar mixture. For some reason, my rice took about 25 minutes to cook. I must have had the temp down too low. And, thank you to Shaz for the advice of adding a little rice mixture at a time to the egg and milk before adding it to the pot so it wouldn't come out as “egg-drop” rice. I did make 3 slight changes. First, I used Lactose-free 1% milk because of my dairy issues. It came out nice and creamy still. I used just a little less than the 1/3 cup of sugar just to cut back a little. I think it would be fine with the full 1/3 cup of sugar, but I personally don't like things very sweet. And, I didn't put the raisins in it because I am not overly fond of raisins. I will definitely make this recipe again. Thanks!

3,000 people can't be wrong! I have only made baked rice pudding so this was def. diff. for me. I'm keeping this recipe! I added the raisins at least 5 mins before the rice/milk mixture was finished cooking [I like mushy raisins]. I also put some of the hot mixture in a dish and then quickly mixed in the mixed beaten egg and 1/2 c milk. [didn't want the egg to scramble]when it was time to add that. It's creamy, not solid and it's really good. I ground some nutmeg on top of each serving..and poured a generous amount of half and half on it....yummmm....

Quick and easy recipe....and so delicious!!!!  I blended the egg with the additional 1/2 cup of cold milk before adding it to the hot mixture, this step should help to prevent the problem of the egg cooking and becoming lumpy, as some reviewers have experienced. As I always do with rice pudding, I topped it with cinnamon. Yummy!!

I really love rice pudding so I was looking forward to trying this. Consistency was great but was a little disappointed - was very bland/unsweetened.  I wanted to try this as a "healthier" version so I followed the cook's notes and used Splenda (1/3 the amount, as stated).  Moral of this story: healthy isn't always better. Lol Needless to say, I won't be doing that again.  I don't usually put raisins in my rice pudding but added them after to get some sweetness. I think this addition saved the day! Although the end result wasn't as sweet as it was super simple and had a great consistency making this worth trying again. Next time I will use sugar or more Splenda though.  UPDATE: after refrigerating I had to reduce my 3 stars to 1. Although it did sweeten up a tad, it completely dried out!!!! There goes any points for consistency.  I will try adding some milk to "water it down" & hopefully this helps - I'm determined. Plus it would be a shame to see good ingredients go to waste (I even made a double batch).

Very nice. Made it with leftover jasmine rice and added a cinnamon stick and a few cardamom pods. If you're nervous about the egg cooking too fast, take the saucepan off the stove for a minute or two to let it cool just slightly, beat the egg REALLY well, and mix it in fast.

Perfect ratios! Also, a great way to rescue leftover rice if you make too much for a meal. I made mine with low fat coconut milk instead of dairy, for a more Thai flavor, and it turned out delicious. I also used dehydrated mango instead of raisins, and put them in during the first step so they re-hydrated a bit. Folding in fresh mango before serving would have been good too! Omit Cinnamon, and garnish with toasted sliced almonds for extra love!

Great recipe! I added about a cup of pumpkin pie mix to the milk in the beginning, cut the final milk down to 1/4 cup and skipped the butter and vanilla for some kick-butt pumpkin rice pudding!!  I also topped it off with some cinnamon and whipped cream, yum!  This recipe really was easy, delicious and very easy to experiment with!

I did not start off with premium ingredients, and it is still pretty darn yummy. I had a tupperware full of left over rice that had been in the fridge for about three days, so it was dry and not very appetizing. After simmering in the milk (1%, all I had in the house), it plumped back up. I added the raisins a little earlier than the recipe called for since I like to give them a few minutes to plump up in the liquid too. I added a cinnamon stick and a few shakes of nutmeg - delicious!

Very good and simple way to use leftover rice!  To keep egg from curdling, add some of the rice pudding slowly to the egg while quickly stirring the mixture.  Then add the egg back to the rice pudding and stir for the two minutes instructed.  Great recipe!

This is the best rice pudding I've ever had. I used extra sugar and extra vanilla. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg. I couldn't imagine this recipe without the cinnamon and nutmeg. My husband said he didn't like rice pudding but I made him try it anyway and he loved it. I gave some to my next door neighbor and she loved it as well. I'm going to make another batch tomorrow for my brother and parents. It was so easy to make. I'm going make this a lot this fall. Try it, you won't be sorry.

I thought it was delicious! It works well! You can substitute a tablespoon or two of honey for the golden raisin and it turns out delicious. Just make sure you stir continuously for two minutes when you add the eggs or they'll cook, and cinnamon and mint as garnishes really add to it!

Excellent!! I didn't have any raisins so that will come the next time I make it. The only thing I changed was in the instructions. I mixed the first part exactly as written, the second part after the simmering for 15 or so minutes, I mixed the remaining ingredients all in a measuring cup making sure to beat the egg very well. I then tempered it with the hot by very large spoonful's in measuring cup, then added to pot and cooked for another 5 minutes. NO SCRAMBLED EGGS, simply the best creamiest rice pudding!! Thank you for the recipe.

We love rice in our house and this is a fantastic way to use it up!  I also added freshly grated nutmeg and cinnamon to mine (1/4 tsp each) and used skim milk.  While the rice and milk were cooking I warmed the reserved milk slightly and added the raisins to soak and plump up.  Very good treat!

This recipe turned out amazing!! It was my first time making rice pudding, I've made it a couple times since. It is great as long as you follow the recipe and use short or medium grain rice, as Erica states. I substituted coconut milk for regular milk and it turned out really well. If you like coconut you will like this. Also for anyone having trouble with the egg. You have to add egg to rice pudding to thicken it. If you don't want your egg to cook into chunks break the egg into the cup of left over milk. Mix the egg and the milk mixture until the egg is essentially dissolved into the milk and the mixture is an off yellow colour. If you warm the mixture up for 30 seconds - 1 min in the microwave and then stir the mixture one more time before slowly adding it you are guaranteed to have no egg chunks and amazing rice pudding.

I made this and it was exactly the way I want rice pudding to taste. It was also very simple to make and I sprinkled it with cinnamon just to give it that extra kick...plus cinnamon is good to lower cholesterol and regulate blood sugar. I actually had this for breakfast and it gave me great energy for the day :)

This is almost similar to the recipe my grandmother used to make, great texture and taste!! I like soaking my raisins in Amaretto and also add a little Almond flavoring, it just kicks it up a notch and just personal preference. I love this recipe due to its versatility..it can be made to fit everyone's taste. Growing up, my granny always whirled an egg yolk in to the milk and preheated it prior to adding in the last 2 minutes and you have to stir it quickly the entire time! This is a wonderful recipe, thank you!

My husband's favorite is creamy rice pudding and he just adored this recipe. I made it for a Valentine's Day dessert. I followed the recipe exactly and everything came out wonderfully! I am a decent baker but I had never made rice pudding before...but it was terrific! I am actually making it again tonight since there was nothing left!!!! My only note is that I preferred cinnamon rather than nutmeg (but it is a personal preference) it was delicious both ways : )

With cinnamon this is a great recipe! I do not use 2 pots to cook this, instead I temper both the milk and eggs when adding them to the pot of rice, just add a few spoonfulls of hot rice to the milk and egg before adding them and it will not curdle or leave chunks of cooked eggs like some reviewers stated. I also like to add a pinch of nutmeg (more than a pinch will ruin this recipe, I learned that the hard way). The second time I made this I significantly reduced the sugar and replaced it with baking Splenda, I couldn't tell the difference.. In the end this recipe is pretty good the way it is, but adding cinnamon makes it a 5 star for me.

very good with minor changes. I added a pinch of cinnamon and made sure the egg was beatin in with the last 1/2 c of milk at the end so it didn't cook into eggy lumps when it hit the heat. I left out the rasins for personal reasons....my daughter and I like them but my husband just dislikes rasins. I used Jasmine rice for a delicate flavor

Overcooked some white rice. Didn't want to waste it. Made this on the off chance that it would rectify the situation, took it to a BBQ. Everyone loved it!  Gotta love when you can save a mess up!

This was my first time I made a rice pudding.  I used rice that I had made the night before (leftovers).  I used the splenda instead of sugar as my husband is diabetic.  I used cranberries instead of raisins as I don't like rasins.  It turned out very creamy and rich, even though I added the butter and vanilla in with the eggs and milk by accident.  I also added a little cinnamon on top after it cooled for an extra flavor that I enjoy.  This is a great recipe because you can make variations of your own to custom build to your own tastes without taking away from the original recipe...wonderful wonderful! So glad my first go at rice pudding was using this recipe!

Creamy, rich and inexpensive - save this recipe!
I used short grain rice and whole milk. Go ahead use the same saucepan- if any rice is stuck to the bottom it will slowly be re-absorbed into the pudding while youre stirring away.  A little too sweet, next time I'll try 1/4 c sugar and always temper the egg with pudding mixture or you'll end up with Eggy Pudding :(

My family loves this recipe.  It's quick and easy to make, especially if you have leftover rice.  I do cut the amount of sugar down to 1/4 cup and it still tastes great.  I also add a full teaspoon of vanilla because we love the extra vanilla flavor.  I have made this recipe with both white and brown rice...depending on what I have on hand.  Tastes great with both kinds.

Excellent, like others this is my first time making rice pudding and everyone raved im currently cooking more right now.. Changes: i only had minute rice but cooked it like the recipe says, worked out perfect. I used all skim milk and i used 3 egg whites instead of two whole eggs. I am also using splenda, if you go onto splenda's website they have a converter chart so you will know how much to use. The original is amazing but i'm trying to satisfy my sweets cravings without all the extra calories. Great recipe though!!

FABULOUS!!!  I agree you don't need to use 2 pans - actually the already-heated rice pan is probably better to use than a cold pan, but either way, this recipe was super easy and super yummy!!!!

This is truly excellent rice pudding! It's so easy to make and it comes out tasting perfect. I used 5 teaspoons of Splenda instead of sugar and I used 1% milk. I am lactose intolerant, so I used Lactaid milk, which is a little sweeter than regular milk because of they way they remove the lactose. So if you're using regular milk, you might want to add a teaspoon or so more Splenda than I used. Also, the recipe doesn't remind you to temper the egg before you add it to the hot rice. Don't forget to do so, or you'll likely end up with scrambled egg in your custard.

Just for background, I'm a guy with too many years experience to remember in professional cooking environments- saute, broiler, hot/cold apps, pantry, desserts…I've done it all and forgotten most of it! Bored tonight, I just slapped this recipe together with what I had laying around the kitchen- long grain rice instead of med/short, imitation vanilla, barely paying attention really- guess I still have "the touch"- it  came out *much* better than expected…better than Cozy Shack brand prepackaged by far.  Great easy recipe and prep.  Next time I'd use a tad less sugar- my kid gets too much already.  Kudos!

I'll add one more 5 star review...this is just like my grandmother used to make when I was growing up!  Didn't have raisins so omitted those.  I also mixed my egg and final 1/2 cup milk together very well and then poured it through a mesh strainer to avoid any eggy strands.  Will definitely make this again and can't wait to try it with raisins!  Served with whipped cream and a dash of cinnamon on top.

I was skeptical since I usually cook rice pudding in milk from the beginning.  But this turned out to be a very good recipe.  Next time I will make it with Arborio rice for an even creamier consistency.

This tasted excellent! I didn't have any white sugar so I substituted with brown, I omitted the butter, and added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon at the end when I stirred in the vanilla. A wonderfully versatile recipe.

Ummmm, AMAZING!! SO SO SO GOOD! im serious. My Husband was helping me make it (being the so wonderfully amazing man he is) and was very skeptical about the whole idea of even making it, but after tasting the dear pudding he didn't utter a single more negative word. LOVE IT, and YES, we will be making it again.

BTW, do melt the butter with the rice before, helps!

Delicious, creamy rice pudding. Exactly what I was looking for. I added the sugar near the end of the cooking time and adjusted to taste - I ended up adding about an extra tablespoon. The rice and raisins remain nicely suspended. I stirred a chopped banana into a couple of the portions. THANK YOU for the wonderful recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly with no substitutions.  This is a really wonderful rice pudding.  Even my Mom loved it.  My adult kids raved about it and the best thing is it is EASY to make.  I used Jasmine rice for mine.  Used salt in the making of the rice so I omitted it in the pudding recipe.  Will definitely make over and over and over again!

I had and used: Jasmine rice, Rice Milk, regular raisins, picked free of stems, soaked a minute and rinsed, and Earth Balance buttery sticks.
I am gluten and dairy free, and I can eat eggs. My substitutions still came out DELICIOUS! I added the sugar just before adding the raisins, egg, and a bit more rice milk.

This recipe should be kept in a safety deposit box.  i've made it using the exact recipe, and also using brown rice with evaporated milk.  The best tips are to add the sugar when the rice is fully cooked, and to temper the egg before adding to the mixture.  The only warning i have is to not prepare this recipe at night, because you will have a restless sleep knowing what a treasure there is in the fridge...it is that excellent.

After I added the milk and sugar, I only cooked it for 12 minutes, so be sure to carefully watch near the tail end. Pretty good recipe.

I didn't use to be a fan of rice pudding, but this stuff is amazing! Just don't use short grain rice.

Love this! I followed other reviews that said to wait a little before putting the sugar in, so the rice would get softer. I also put some of the hot rice mixture into the egg and milk before pouring it into the rice, so the egg wouldn't cook in chunks in the rice pudding. I leave out the raisins because sometimes I just want the creamy rice pudding taste with whatever spices I feel like at the moment (cinnamon and nutmeg right now). Very good recipe!

The first rice pudding I ever made and it was creamy and delicious. I followed user suggestions and just added the butter and salt in the beginning. I also added a little of the hot cooked mixture to the egg first before dumping in the egg. Came out perfect.

Oh yummy. This recipe was quick, easy, and the results were fabulous. I have to wonder if a little orange zest and some dried cranberries wouldn't be another yummy option also.....So, so good. Make this.

Thank you Erica G. for this awesomey awesome rice pudding recipe!  Family voted it better than Kozy Shack.  I used white arborio rice which is an Italian medium grain rice.   I now have another way to put a smile on my husband's face! ;)

I have been looking for a recipe that I could substituted vanilla Rice Dream for the milk.  I thought I would just try it and see what happens.  My husband said this was fantastic with the Rice Dream.  I would imagine you could substitute any dairy or non-dairy product.  Thank you.

I'm a huge fan of rice pudding and this is one of the best recipes I've ever had. It's so creamy and soft! I've never made homemade rice pudding before, just semi-homemade using Jello's cook & serve pudding. It was very easy to make and in total took me about 30 minutes. I had a huge bag of rice we bought at an Asian market, kinda like sticky rice, and used this short grain rice. It came out so soft and tender. The only modifications I made were omitting the raisins and adding 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. It tasted great warm but I prefer my rice pudding cold, so I put it in the fridge and I think it tasted better once it had time to sit. My husband loved it and he's not the biggest fan of rice pudding. Will definitely be making again!!

Terrific!  I love this stuff!!!  Turned out great, was surprised how good the golden raisins were in the dish, wasn't expecting that.  Make sure you cook it for as long as it says, that rice really needs to soften up!  Will absolutely make this again.

So simple and so delicious! I made it with nunaturals stevia instead of the sugar. Also before making it tempered the egg by putting it in a glass of hot water (in the shell)while I made the rest, then at the end turned stove off then add the warm egg, but leave on the burner (turned off)while you stir it 2 mins. This prevented it from leaving egg floaties.

Excellent pudding!  I used short-grain brown rice instead of white rice (that's what we had), and added raisins (rice pudding without raisins is like pancakes without syrup!), but other than that I followed the recipe to the letter.

This recipe is *definitely* a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy.  A bit too sweet with the raisins though.  Next time will try it without them.  Also used arborio rice and evaporated milk.

This simple to make and really good. I only recently tasted rice pudding for the first time recently and I thought it might be harder to make.
I followed the recipe exactly except for just 1/2 cup of the milk I used coconut milk, this kind of coconut milk though was an odd kind (it looked like crisco?)next time I'll get the coconut milk liquid.thnx 4 sharing

Oh Sweet Heaven on a spoon!  I have such wonderful childhood memories of my Grandmother's rice pudding and this recipe brought all of that back for me.  I used Vanilla Almond Milk and reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup, cut out the additional vanilla and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  This rice pudding sent me on a taste memory journey.  So sweet and yummy.  My son even likes it, and he does not like rice! : )  Thank you Erica for such a fantastic recipe!

Ok so I used some leftover rice, skipped the raisins and egg, and replaced the sugar for honey and it came out AMAZING!! But you must remember to put less honey than the amount needed for sugar. I made the mistake of putting an equal amount and it was super sweet so I had to add more milk and rice, after that it was perfect. :) thanks for the recipe

This is not the 1st time for me and homemade rice pudding BUT, this is the 1st time I loved it!!!! Wow, I won't buy Kozy Shack anymore...this is sooooo good. I did whisk all the ingredients when added and only could find long grain rice at the store. So after cooking the rice I placed it on a cutting board, took a long knife and pressed down along the rice and it made it smaller. This is creamy and delish...I can't wait to share this with friends and family!!!

Pretty good.  Definitely a great cold weather dessert if you have the time.  Since it was my first time attempting this dessert I decided to go the full 20 minutes in the milk and that seemed a bit too much. Next time I will go 15 minutes and still have a think but not too think consistency but I think that's a matter of taste.  I tempered the eggs like some others had suggested and that worked out beautifully.

I've never been a fan of rice pudding but my fiancee loves it.  I made this for him this weekend & even I enjoyed it!  I omitted the raisins & added cinnamon & nutmeg to it, also because I didn't have milk in the house, I used 1 c. whipping cream and 1 c. half & half.  Using Italian Style Rice (High starch) it had a wonderful creamy texture & a great vanilla flavor.  I used Splenda as he's diabetic & for once he couldn't tell!  We've found that the Splenda usually goes salty in baking, but this time it didn't.  This has been added to our recipe collection! Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

Definitely one of the best rice puddings. I like that it was simple and fairly quick to make. I agree that it needs to be sweeter, so instead of adding more sugar, I added condense milk at the end after adding the beaten egg and vanilla. Not only it made it sweeter, it also made it creamier.

This turned out pretty good, however, I did not add the last 1/2 cup of milk because if I had the pudding would have been soupy.  This may be because I am in Africa and the altitude is different however.  I did not add raisins and instead of vanilla (it is very expensive here) I added some cinnamon.  It made a delicious dessert on a cold desert night.  Thanks for sharing.

My daughter and husband love this rice pudding, so much that I double the recipe, but not the egg. It is even cold the next day in my daughters lunch!

I had some left over rice in the fridge, so I decided to make this recipe as an alternative to breakfast cereal on a Tuesday morning. As long as you're planning for it, there was plenty of time to cook and eat it before work, especially since my rice was already cooked. I loved this recipe! It cooked up nice and smooth, very creamy and delicious. It took a while to start thickening, but it was done within the 20 minutes stated. I would probably reduce the sugar in the future just to match my own tastes, but otherwise this recipe is a keeper! Add some nuts and berries and you've got a great new breakfast option.

This was awesome AND simple!  5 stars all the way.  I followed some previous suggestions and just added the milk to the same pot.  Also, for a more authentic Mediterranean flavor, I added a few whole cloves along with the milk and a few drops of pure almond extract.  It was FAB!

Absolutely delightful! Was in the mood for something sweet and this just did the trick. Not sure if it's just my old stovetop, but I had to add extra milk so that it wouldn't burn and I cooked it at the end for only 10 mins instead of 15-20 mins, but still came out very creamy. Also, added sliced almonds on top when serving, gives it a nice crunch. Thanks for the recipe!

I had been looking for a baked rice pudding recipe, but the ones I have tried to date have all been a bit disappointing.  So I decided to try this stovetop recipe.  I used short-grain rice and followed the recipe almost exactly.  I doubled the ingredients as we are a large family, but omitted the raisins as we have never been fans of raisins in rice pudding.  I added the sugar nearer the end of the cooking time and I decided to start with just half the quantity and add the rest as required. I found that half the amount was sweet enough for our tastes.  I will also reduce the amount of vanilla next time.    For the second addition of milk, I replaced regular milk with evaporated milk to try and make the pudding more creamy.  Overall, this is a great recipe.  It's very easy and makes a good pudding.  But I would have liked it to have tasted creamier, so I will probably try cooking the rice in milk next time.  I will say tho, that the leftovers heated up the next day tasted much better.  The pudding thickened, so I added more evaporated milk while heating and it was much closer to the creamy texture I was hoping for.  If you are looking for a good rice pudding recipe, I would definitely recommend you try this.

Ohhhhh, Erica, I love your mom and I love you for posting this. Today is my day to iron (yep, some of us still do) and feeling blah. Wanted a mouthful of something sweet, creamy and comforting. Dug through my recipes and found your recipe.  I have to tell you, it lives up to its name and is beyond delicious.  I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and followed the recipe as written.  I have 4 generous servings and wondering if any of  the remaining 3 ;o)   will make it for dessert tonight? Maybe one, for the hubs. Excellent, easy, satisfying and a dish I look forward to preparing again!! Thank you.

Loved this easy recipe. Used leftover rice from dinner and followed it exactly. Sprinkled it with cinnamon to finish it off. Next time I will omit the raisins, just made it to sweet.

OMG!  This is soooo good.  I don't like warm rice pudding at all, I like mine really cold. But this was so good, I at a full bowl while still having to blow on it.  It was just what I was (or the baby in belly) was craving...Thank you for this recipe!

LOVE this recipe. My family is constantly asking me to make this ever since I tried it out.  Definitely take one of the other user's advice and make sure not to add the sugar until the rice is thoroughly cooked/ to the softness that you would like it at!  One of my other tricks is to plump the raisins.  To do this:
Place the raisins in a small saucepan, and add just enough water to cover them.  Put the heat on low until it comes to a light boil, then turn off heat and cover for 20 minutes or so.  Drain and add raisins when the pudding is ready.

I also add a small dollup of whipped cream and sprinkle some cinnamon over top when complete... DELICIOUS! - Thank you for this recipe!

it was good. PUT ALL THE SUGAR. do NOT put the egg. fallow the instructions of the other reviews about adding the sugar and butter when the rice is fully cooked. please don't put the egg (i took milk and beat the egg in there before adding it) still the texture was weird. it was perfectly great without it and think about the calories you cut!! 40 calories of fat amen.

I love this recipe!  I usually use leftover cooked rice for this instead of cooking rice especially for it.  I almost always use brown rice and while it doesn't get that super creamy consistency that white rice does it still works out pretty well.  Cooktime is a bit longer too.

This was really tasty. I used half almond milk and half whole milk and added a fair amount of cinnamon. I also used a mixture of dried fruit bits instead of just raisins (the dried cherries were particularly delicious) and sprinkled the pudding with sliced almonds when serving. It was good both warm and cold!

Oh my goodness, I have made this recipe twice and let me tell you, this second time making it I could not WAIT to review. I was going to wait until my batch had cooled in the refrigerator but this is just TOO magnificent.
The first time I made it as the recipe called. Maybe I added a little more sugar. It was not very fantastic. It was "okay" warm and bad after it had cooled at room temp (and been in the refrigerator)
This time, however, I made a few changes. 
First, I boiled 1 cup of water with 1/2 cup of milk. I put the rice into that and I added 2 tablespoons of butter and let it cook as is called. Then I added 2/3 cup of sugar (I like my rice pudding sweet). I added another tablespoon of butter and two teaspoons of vanilla extract and I swear to God this is the best rice pudding I've ever had. It's pretty yellow (from all the butter haha) but man, is it good!

I think that it is delicious. However, i think that the rice needs a little more water to cook in (so that it is less hard). It is also not that sweet, so i would have added a little more sugar. I also tend to like pudding cold but that is a personal preference.

This was just plain ol' awesome. Simple yet super tasty. Next time I will try 3/4 cup milk during the final process so that when the remainder is refrigerated it stays creamy. Thanks for this awesome homemade recipe!

For those of us living in hot climates, this stovetop version is fantastic, because it doesn't heat up the kitchen with a hot oven.  I did not make this recipe as written.  After reading other reviews, I added more milk (a cup more) and a whole tsp. of vanilla.  The texture was rich and creamy - totally delicious!  I also want to note that I had no problem using long grain rice, but I do know that shorter grain rices will make starchier rice.  I'm saving this is as my go-to rice pudding recipe.

This was delicious! The moment I tasted it, it reminded me of home, it's just how rice pudding should be. It was thick, rich, creamy and had JUST the right amount of sweetness, perfect texture, it was heavenly! I only made slight changes to the method. I added the salt when boiling the rice in water, and I took the advice of one reviewer and did not add the sugar until the end with the egg. I mixed the egg with the remaining 1/2 cup milk and the sugar, then mixed in a few spoonfulls of the pudding to temper the egg before adding it to the pudding. I used arborio rice, the kind you would use for rissoto. The cinnamon and nutmeg sprinkled over the top really makes it! Thank you for this recipe, it will be the only one I use for rice pudding!

Although I made a few of my own adaptations, this recipe I'm sure would taste excellent exactly as it is presented to us. My modifications were as follows: I used Basmati rice instead of regular white. I used skim milk. Instead of white sugar, I substituted 3 tbsp of organic wildflower honey (add a little bit of honey at a time until its sweetened to your liking, I often find desserts are too sweet, so I cut back on that, plus honey is sweeter than sugar). I soaked the raisins for 10 minutes in about two cups of warm water and strained them before adding them to the pudding. I added a handful of toasted cashews at the end with the raisins. 'Twas delicious!

Very tasty and easy to make.  I added chopped apples and shredded coconut to the raisins but i added them all at about half the cooking time.  next time i will add them earlier so the apples can get softer. I also added cardamom and cinnamon and more milk.

I highly recommend this rice pudding recipe because it's very tasty. It turned out extremely well compared to other recipes I've tried. I added more raisins (almost 1 cup) and I added 1 tsp of vanilla instead of 1/2 tsp. The only issue I had was the cooking of the rice. I boiled the water, put the rice in and then simmered it for 20 mins. but some of it browned and stuck to the bottom of the pot. I think I might have simmered it at too high of a heat, didn't use enough water, or just cooked it a bit too long. Next time I might put in 2 cups of water to boil the rice and cook it for only 15 minutes. I also used short grain white rice which made it very creamy and thick. I would have tried medium grain rice, but I couldn't find this type. I will definitely make this again because it's great!

Great recipe.  Used dark raisins the first time, and it was too sweet so omitted them the next time, and it was just right.  If you plan on making this often and don't already have a rice cooker, consider buying one.  The rice comes out perfectly, and you don't have to stand around stirring it.

Mmmmmh, the ultimate comfort food.
I love how creamy this is.  Please remember to temper the egg before you add it to the rice. It was sweet when I ate it right away still warm, but I let some cool and ate it later and it was perfectly sweetened.

Delish, with the eggy flavor I remember from my favorite Swedish cafe. Very easy to prepare even with a toddler running around the kitchen. I used leftover jasmine rice. The 2nd time I made it, I whisked the egg into the remaining milk, and then whisked in 1/3 cup of the hot rice mixture into it to temper the eggs, so there were no streaky bits. Perfect!

Used 1% milk and let it boil for the 15 minutes.  Great with raisins, would be great without as well. Used 1/6 cup sugar and 1 tbsp Splenda.

I made this according to the recipe, my only change being that I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and I tempered the eggs before I added them. We loved the taste but when it cooled it was much too thick and pasty, which made it difficult to eat. The next time that I make it I will try adding either less rice or more milk.

Loved this recipe!!! Instead of cooking my rice on the stovetop, I got the Trader Joe's Jasmine 3 minute rice and added it to the milk, sugar and salt. Also, I don't like the taste of egg very much so I left it out and it tastes amazing, best i have ever had!!! Definitely recommend it!

This rice pudding is delicious. Even my avowed rice pudding hating husband liked it. I made it with arborio rice, half and half instead of milk and used only 1/4 cup sugar. I also made it in one pot - just poured the milk, etc. over the rice once it had cooked. My one comment is that it thickened significantly when it cooled. I will have to stir more milk to get it back to a creamy consistency before serving.

This is the recipe that I wanted! This was really good and creamy just how I wanted it. It was fairly easy to make and didn't take as long as I thought it was going to. The next time I make it, I will probably add less sugar because it was a bit on the sweet side.

This recipe is FABULOUS! I had been craving rice pudding for a while but couldn't find a recipe that I connected with until this one.  I used long grain rice and half and half because that was all I had at home but it was delicious.  Next time I'll try a med grain rice and skim milk.  It's creamy, sweet, warm and comforting and pretty easy to make! Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

This recipe gets five stars.  Okay I did everything in one pot.  Make sure you boil the water before adding the rice to cook, then cover with lid and make sure you lower the heat way down and leave it alone.  The next step, I added the milk, sugar, butter and cinnamon to get creamy for the time it said to cook on med heat.  Last step, I lowered the heat way down again when adding the egg with milk.  Make sure you are stiring and don't stop.  I ate it warm topped with cinnamon.  It was great.  We will be making this over and over.

This was fabulous. I quadrupled the batch to fit in a 9x13 for a Christmas party and it took 4 times longer to cook, so if you're wanting a big batch, be prepared to cook it for a longgg time.

Very very good recipe. I did use part milk and part heavy cream (I love the rich flavor of heavy cream), and I also used part raisins and part dried cranberries (the cranberries are a little bit sweeter).

this is awesome, I used brown rice and found that I needed about a 1/4 cup more rice to make it the consistency that I like. I also added cinnamon during cooking but as is it is incredible as well.

Delicious!!! Like other reviewers suggested, used medium grain rice, skim milk, and for my own twist cooked the golden raisins in vanilla/water mixture for several minutes before adding them to the pudding at the end. Makes them plump and sweeter! My 4 year olds loved this recipe as well. Will definately be making this again.

VEGAN/VEGETARIAN version.  I cooked this using canned coconut milk (it's what I had on hand).  I also used jasmine rice (again it's what I had on hand)  I added the sugar to the coconut milk while the rice was cooking so it would dissolve.  Add the egg (skip for vegan) to the remaining milk and beat.  I also tossed in some cinnamon and clove.  Tossed in the raisins (regular, not golden, on hand).  When the 20 minute cook time was done (the one with the coconut milk added) I took a spoon full of the rice mixture and added right to the remaining milk, egg, raisin, spice mixture to temper a bit and popped it all back in the big pan and cooked for an additional two minutes.  EXCELLENT and creamy!  I'm going to try this recipe again using vanilla almond milk next time. (oh and I skipped the butter)
******Made it a second time using vanilla flavored almond milk and I also forgot the egg but it turned out just as good!!

Doesn't any one in the U.S. have 'Pudding Rice' We get it here in the U.K. It is rolled into 'flake's' and is sooo nice. It is especially made rice for rice puddings.We have had it here for yonks,and I cant understand why you have to use long /med grain rice????

Had a craving for rice pudding! This was so easy and delicious. I don't think I will pay for pudding again! First time I have ever made any kind of pudding that wasn't instant!

I love this recipe.  I used soy milk and splenda and regular raisins instead and it was great.  I love recipes that don't need adjusting because of necessary substitutions. It's a keeper.

How am I going to lose 20 lbs if I keep making and eating tasty recipes like this one?  Just warms my tummy on a cold morning!  I used long grain rice.  I'm going to try short next time.  Definitely a keeper!

Yummy!!  I've never made rice pudding before, but have an aunt, who just had surgery and is laid up for a while, requested rice pudding.  I plan on making another batch for her (had to test the first one myself :p).  She will be thrilled.  Overall it was easy to make and tastes wonderful!

This was fabulous. I used Arboro rice and 2% evaporated milk, came out supper creamy. I also added 1 1/2 tespoons of cinnamon and 1 cup currents which I added to the liquid mixture to allow them to hydrate before I added then to the dry, was wonderful. My husband and I had never had rice pudding before but you can count on well have it again thats for sure after this. Wonderful :)

First time making rice pudding; it was good right after it was cooked but the texture didn't keep very well in the fridge. If you are going to save some for another night then I wouldn't get it as thick since the fridge made it thicker.

I've made this twice in about a week and a half. It was my first time making anything like this. My first attempt i used long grain rice (all i have) i cooked it separately (1/2 cup dried rice to 1 cup water cooked up 1 1/2 cups of rice) Used the same pan and added milk (fatfree). I took the tip of waiting to put the sugar in till after your rice is tender. It took a bit of time and stirring alot. The fat free milk thickened quite well. I used splenda (it was ok in the recipe) but when it came down to adding the egg. I did temper it but i guess i didn't do well enough. I had bits of egg in the pudding. The second attempt. I made sure i beat the egg and milk together well and kept it in a pot on low heat to help make sure i had no eggs in the pudding. I used regular sugar its awhole lot better (imo) but it is sweet so it might not be good for some people. It did cook awhile but ended up with perfect pudding. I also used margerine instead of butter. and no raisins to to preference.

Very good rice pudding.  Very creamy and less lumpy than other recipes I have tried.  I like that you do not have to bake it in the oven either.  I have tried it with and without raisons and prefer this recipe without.  Very good!

I did not like this recipe at all! It tasted like rice, milk and EGGS! My whole kitchen smells like eggs. I will continue using my own yummy recipe: In stead of sugar, just add a can of condensed milk and viola, you have creamy and delicious rice pudding. NO EGGS! I just felt like some rice pudding but didn't have the condensed milk; so I tried this recipe. :( I read all the reviews and I was convinced it will turn out a great recipe. Sorry! I am disappointed! I rated one star because you have to rate in order to submit.

I am eating a bowl of this right now - WOW, so good!  I am having a rough time sleeping tonight and needed some comfort food.  I had one cup of leftover jasmine rice in my fridge and used it in this recipe with excellent results.  It's unbelievably delicious.  I have bookmarked the recipe and will undoubtedly use it again.

Excellent, but unless I overcooked it the firt time, I would suggest adding more milk.... like 1.5 extra cups. I like my rice puding a bit wet and creamy... made as instructed this was a bit too firm.

i make this with left over white rice from our chinese take out... i added pumpkin pie spice before serving.. i do recommend using less sugar as well, and you might as well double the recipe because it goes fast.

Very good, I used 1 cup heavy cream instead of milk, and used 2/3 cup of sugar.  Cooked rice about 10 minutes, till water gone, then added the other ingrediants and simmered until right consistency.  It is delicious!

The only thing i did different is seperate the egg yolk and white.. I mixed the yolk in first  and then I beat the egg white until stiff peaks formed then I folded the stiff egg whites at the end.(last 3 mins on cooking stage). it make the rice pudding much more creamy. and light.

Great recipe, followed a few suggestions of others as far as timing.  First, I used short grain brown rice as that's all we had and it turned out great.  Used one large stock pot, not two as instructed.  Cooked rice a little longer until most of the water was gone (brown rice takes a little longer), added butter at this time.  Once butter was melted, added the 1.5 C. milk and salt, and cooked over medium heat for 15 minutes, then added sugar, cooking for 5 more minutes.  Mixed egg & .5 C milk and stirred in about a cup of the hot rice mixture to warm up the egg.  Slowly poured the egg mixture into the large stock pot as to avoid having cooked pieces of egg in final product.  Fished out recipe as directed, cooking for 2 minutes and added vanilla when done.  Turned out perfect!

Great recipe! I didn't change a thing other than added a little bit of cinnamon because I like the taste and omitted the raisins simply cause I don't like them. BUT the recipe itself was easy and delicious! I don't like rice pudding warm and I was scarfing it down!

This is definitely one of the better rice puddings I've had.  However I prefer mine less sweet and more eggy.  Next time I will decrease the sugar, increase the eggs, and maybe add some cinnamon.

I bought some rice pudding at a farmer's market recently and enjoyed it so much that I immediately came home and looked up this recipe. When I made it, it turned out almost exactly like the pudding at the farmer's market. I made some changes based on others' review: I reduced sugar to 1/4 cup and added it after the rice mixture was at a desired thickness, I also stirred some rice mixture to the egg mixture before I poured the egg mixture into the pot. I also eliminated the butter because the farmer's market pudding didn't include butter. Recipe was creamy and delicious. I made it a second time and forgot the vanilla and it was still just as delicious.

Very easy, came out fantastic, tasted wonderful! I hate raisins so I left them out but I love cinnamon in my rice pudding so I added a few dashes and a dash or two of nutmeg and it just came out killer!! You can serve this warm or cold, either way its delicious. Great recipe!

First of all - you MUST use short grain rice. It's the standard risotto rice and it makes this super creeeeamy. I've made with whole milk and skim.  honestly, fantastic either way. So if you want to spare the fat and calories, it really doesn't matter. The short grain rice - I used Arborio - this is the CREAMY factor. You MUST cook the rice until tender, and feel free to add a dash of vanilla flavoring and plenty of spice when throwing in the milk and sugar - I added extra sweetmess with a touch of dark brown sugar WITH the white sugar and plenty of "apple pie spice." OH. So good! I've read about making chocolate rice pudding, I'm on a mission to incorporate this recipe with CHOCOLATE. I've read you can also use BROWN rice for rice pudding. Might be a tasty alternative. TRY IT! YUM!

My husband likes the Kozy Shack brand of rice pudding, so last holiday season I made a recipe I saw on a celebrity chef cooking show.  I thought it was okay, but the hubby howled in disapproval making it clear that it was not okay to serve this to him again.  The message - do not mess with a classic and make it something high falutin'!  Budget's a little too tight this month for a Kozy Shack indulgence, so I persuaded the man that I should try again and do it *right*  ;-) I chose this recipe, and because I was using up pantry extras I added a couple of tablespoons of cream, and a package of vanilla sugar.  I had some giant raisins and I soaked them in water first.  To top it off, I sprinkled on a light dusting of nutmeg.  I have redeemed my rice pudding reputation from the dust bin of Christmas past!  Thanks for the great recipe - easy and just right for the picky guy.

Awesome recipe. Here are my modifications. 1: Let the raisins sit in a bowl of boiled water. This will help rehydrate them, and plump them up. 2: The egg and 1/2 cup of milk should sit out to warm up a bit. You never want to dump cold milk and egg into a warm bath. 3: When it comes time to combine the egg/milk with the rice, add some of the warm rice mixture to the egg/milk first to ease the temperature up, then add back into the rice mixture. 4: Use whole milk. Skim milk or 1% just doesn't cut it.

I have made this recipe dozens of times,  and it turns out perfect every time.  Sometimes I make it as written,  sometimes I change it up a bit by adding nutmeg,  or pumpkin pie spice,  or extra cinnamon.  Sometimes I add raisins,  or Craisins ,  or other dried fruit.  Sometimes I don't. I always use leftover medium grain rice and  1% milk. Sometimes I cover it when I put it in the fridge d it stays creamy on top.  Sometimes I sprinkle liberal amounts of cinnamon and don't cover it and it develops a bit of a film on top.This recipe has never let me down.

I couldn't believe how good this was, and how easy it was to make.  I have made a sugar free version with splenda and replaced the milk with evaporated milk for an extra creamy texture.  Any way you do it, it's sooo good!  This needs more stars!

Creamy and Delicious!  I tossed in some extra cinnamon and nutmeg and it came out great.  A great way to use up leftover rice, although if you salted the rice as part of the cooking process, be sure to cut way back on the salt added to the pudding.  It takes a lot of stirring and attention, but at least it doesn't take hours like oven-baked varieties do.

Yummy! The only thing I did different was to soak my raisins in some Rum and I added just a sprinkle of nutmeg to the recipe.

This was a really good recipe, but quite bland without any seasonings. I added a pinch of allspice (maybe 1/8 t) and about 1/2 t cinnamon, along with a dusting of cinnamon over the top when served. I substituted fructose crystals for the sugar, and followed the suggestions of others not to add the sweetener until the pudding was the consistency I wanted with just the rice, salt and milk. One thing to keep in mind is that it will REALLY firm up as it cools, so you may want to stop simmering while it is still on the soupier side. By the time I got to the event where I was serving it, the pudding had thickened a bit too firmly. Still a wonderful recipe that I will be making again! Thanks, Erica!

This was very easy and qick. I used leftover rice and that was just fine. I already had the ingredients. Not too sweet! Just right. Served warm and delicious! Will definitely make again. So much for Kozy Shack!This one was just right!

I never really liked rice pudding but my teenager wanted some. I ended up finding this recipe and wow, I really enjoyed it. (I prefer it hot) Next time I will omit the raisins just out of our personal taste.

I changed this up only slightly. I used soymilk instead of regular (soNice, organic, original) and left my rice (jasmine) slightly moist.  I omitted raisins (can substitute with dried cranberries), as well.  Oh, and with fake extract, I used 1tsp, but with organic extract I would stick with 1/2 tsp as real vs fake flavour is very different.  (real, organic is a stronger extract as opposed to the fake flavoured stuff).   Another tip: warm the milk, sugar, salt in pan while the rice is cooking.    This is just delectible!  Absolutely keeping this one on file!

Wow! This was wonderful. I followed the recipe, with the exception of using 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 tablespoon of butter and no raisins. I added the sugar after the milk and rice was already warm. Great recipe. Thanks!

YUM - this is the best recipe I've tried (out of 4 others).  I did have the turn the heat down a bit below medium (could be my electric stove top) and add a bit more milk so as not to burn.  My children (6,8 & 9 - and hubby) also enjoyed it.  I needed more.....

Very nice, particularly for Americanized pallet.  'Not the baked, more austere Celtic sort at all.  Hence only 4 stars, although my family enjoyed it, as will my friends from the southeastern states.  It's a totally dependable recipe if what you want is a rather sweet, wet, creamy pudding.  I substituted 1t stevia for sugar, added 1/2 t nutmeg to the flavorings and omitted the raisins as a nod to my guys' preferences.

This one is a keeper.  I've been looking for a rice pudding that tasted as good as this one.  I did leave out the raisins.  I was a little worried about having scrambled eggs in my rice pudding so I mixed the egg in the 1/2 cup of milk and that worked out great!

GREAT! easy and soooo good! I used long grain minute rice and added about a half cup more rice than it calls for. Just be sure to temper the eggs with the hot milok and rice before adding them in or you will get some scrambled egg chunks in your pudding. LOVE IT!

A very good recipe.  I made it with long grain rice and it was fine. I use a steamer to make the rice so I don't have to worry about scorching it.  I put rum in it when I add the last bit of milk.  Dusting with nutmeg or mace adds nicely to it as well.

Very good.  I agree to use the shorter grain rice.  You can do the splenda thing, but it isn't as sweet as traditional then.  Still very yummy.

I used leftover rice (so I skipped step one), and I left out the butter. SO YUMMY!   My Grandma used to make rice pudding every Christmas so I wanted to carry on the tradition in her memory, but I didn't have the chance to get her recipe. This one is the closest I have found to the one she used to make.  I will make this pudding every holiday season from now on!!!

Easy and AMAZING! My grandmother makes rice pudding like this, and my mother always just made it with milk, rice, and sugar, so that's the way I learned how to make it, but it just never tasted as good.  I can now make rice pudding just as good as grandma's!  Thank you, Erica!

This is very tasty...just like I thought it should be. My Mom tried to tell me to mix my cooked rice with vanilla pudding, and I just couldn't believe that that was the best recipe out there. This is great, much better than the alternative!

This was great! My family enjoyed it so much. One thing I did do was...while the rice was cooking I did throw in a cinnamon stick to give the rice flavor....It was great. Along with it I made my own whip cream...Mmmmmm....

Before I give my review, I should admit that I've never had rice pudding before and was totally clueless on what the end product is supposed to be like. So I read the reviews before making this and did two things: used 3/4 c Half and Half with 1 1/4 c. Skim Milk, and tempered the egg first with some of the hot mixture. I am now wondering why I've never had this delicious dessert before! It was perfect! It was very rich and creamy, with the perfect amount of sweetness. Even rice pudding virgins like me will find this very easy.

This is good.  I made it exactly as written.  I only had to cook it 5 minutes instead of 15-20.  Next time I will add a little more sugar, and some cinnamon.

definitely a yummy pudding. my 9 year old has been bugging me for a while to make him rice pudding. i've never made it before. he wanted me to tell all of you that it's his favorite ever!  Unfortunately I had some issues with too much liquid - I used Uncle Ben's rice. not sure what the problem was. I didn't have cornstarch to thicken it up so ended up adding some flour.  it took about an hour of boiling high to get it to thicken up. i'm sure it was just me, i'll try it again. maybe with different rice next time.

Yielded to 8 servings. Used skim milk because that's what I had in hand. Didn't stir in sugar until it was at the right consistency. Used 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of the 1/3 it called for. Then added an additional 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Tempered the egg mixture with the warm mixture so it would blend easier. Used half amount of raisins. Added 1 teaspoon cinnamon powder. Let it simmer for a little bit longer to have a thicker consistency. This tasted better than the store-bought rice pudding I always get! Thanks!

I'm a real lover of creamy rice pudding and have been since childhood.  This was absolutely delicious and very similar to the kind I grew up loving in various NYC diners.  The only thing I added was 1 extra yolk and I snuck in 1/2 cup of half & half in place of same amount of milk, just to make it extra decadent.  I will definitely make this recipe again for guests.  Thanks, Erica G.!!

Wonderful Recipe!  I ended up adding an extra egg yolk, mainly because I was using egg whites for a different recipe and didnt want to waste it.  The result was a little more custard like taste while still maintaining the rice pudding consistancy.  This was my first time making rice pudding and I was very happy with the way it turned out.

LOVED it!!!  A little sweet for my taste but otherwise awesome.  I followed other people's advice and added the sugar after it cooked with the milk.  I also used evaporated skim milk.  Great recipe and I will make it again.

Very good. I halved the amount of butter, but it was still too buttery for me. Next time I won't use any.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I only had minute rice on hand so I just cooked the rice according to the package directions and it turned out great! I had all the ingredients on hand. Next time I might try with brown sugar as well.

the most amazing rice pudding ever. I used the golden raisins at first, but didn't like the taste of them in there, so next time i made it with the dark raisins instead. what a difference. used about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. the cinnamon is a musssst. i also used parboiled rice instead. u will not fail with this recipe.

Fantastic - even with my numerous changes. I used skim milk, and half white rice/ half brown (both long grain and it was still super tasty). I also used 2 packets of stevia (the actual pure stevia, not one of the new hybrid brands) instead of the sugar. Added the vanilla to the egg mixture, and took another reviewer's advice about warming it with a spoonful of the rice mixture before stirring it into the pot. Topped it with raisins (instead of cooking them) and cinnamon. My husband was very happy :-)  Important note: during the 2nd step, when cooking the rice in the milk, I recommend leaving the pot uncovered, and stirring occasionally.

I have made this several times.  Always turns out great.  Perfect for rice leftovers.  And I disagree about short grained rice.  I use long grain and it is fine.  Short would be best, but really long grain works too.

Very good!  I used Uncle Ben's converted rice (cooked as per directions), skim milk, omitted the raisins and thought the sweetness was perfect.  Thought it was a little on the dense side, so next time I will put less 1/2 cup of cooked rice if using Uncle Ben's again, in case this was the cause of it.  Apart from my preference of a more liquidy rice pudding, it was perfect in taste and very easy to make.

This was so yummy, but for some reason I was thinking it wouldn't take as long as it did.  I wonder if you could adapt this and make it with instant rice? Anyway, I used regular raisins and a good dose of cinnamon. SO good. Heated up the leftovers with some more milk and it was like it was fresh! This would be good to make a big batch for breakfasts and snacks all week, because the leftovers heat well.

I cheated with delicious consequences. Didn't have vanilla, but did have a box of vanilla pudding mix!  Made exactly as directly, but sprinkled the small box of pudding into the creamy mixture.  I will never ever make it another way. Simply divine! Doubled the recipe, thank goodness! Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely adore this recipe. It's my go-to recipe for plain rice pudding. I do change the ingredients a bit, though - I double the amount of egg and vanilla, because I like my rice pudding really custardy. I've also come up with a chocolate variation - increase the amount of sugar to around 1/2 cup (more or less, depending on how sweet you want it), then add 1/4 cup baking cocoa to the pudding after adding the egg. This makes a deliciously chocolatey version of rice pudding.

Better than I expected! I used Evaporated Milk since others said it wasnt creamy enough. I didn't add raisins and added a touch of cinnamon to please my tastebuds. Boy oh boy were they pleased! Excellent recipe thats quick and easy!

This is a GREAT recipe.  By no means a substitute when you're in the mood for solid/baked rice pudding (which is a different game entirely), this recipe is one of best/easiest creamy rice pudding recipes that I've found. I've made variations with cardamom and pistachios, some with nutmeg and cinnamon -- and I've been very pleased with the results all-around.

I loved my Mom's rice pudding as a kid but I have to say this is even better than her recipe.  I've made this several times.  Fantastic rice pudding!

I was never a huge rice pudding fan until I tried this recipe. I have tried several recipes because my husband loves rice pudding and this is the best one yet. I have used it with raisons (not golden) and without and it was great both times. My two year old son also loves this rice pudding and he's not a huge fan of rice. I did add some of the hot mixture to the eggs before adding it to the pot. I also used calrose rice and it worked just fine. I hope you enjoy this as much as we did!

"THE Best" I found this recipe 4 days ago and have made it 3 times since then. It's so easy and you can change it with no ill effects to suit your mood/pantry. If your pudding wasn't creamy enough,chances are that you're using the wrong type of rice. What's even more easy and foolproof then tempering the egg is just beating the egg yolk with the 1/2c milk then adding slowly to the rice mixture.

Don't know what I did wrong, but  my pudding came out with too thin a consistency and was not to my liking.  Wanted a thicker pudding.

It's amazing! Just like mom used to make. Only thing I changed was that I added half a stick of cinnamon to pot during the first step, and then took it out before adding the egg. Amazing! *thumbs up!*

This is GREAT!!!  I made a few changes based on what I had in the kitchen to work with, and it still came out perfect!  I used long grain rice dispite lots of other reviews saying that medium was the key...it didn't make much difference to me.  I also added a little bit more sugar, and used a mixture of skim milk and heavy cream because I didn't have enough milk and I'm actually glad I did...it gave it a rich creamy taste!  I don't care for raisins so I left them out.  I also added a little bit of vanilla (on accident) into the mixture with the eggs and then I added it again with the butter at the end and I think that also gave it a nice flavor. I will be making this again ...and again and again, but will most likely double the recipe in the future!  Thanks!

My husband & I loved it!  Will make again & again..... excellent served with cinnamon &  whipped cream.  As suggested by others, I made a few mods.:   1. For extra flavor, I added a touch of vanilla extract to the water when I cooked the rice in microwave rice cooker.   2. Added the sugar (1/2 cup) after the rice, milk & salt had cooked for 10 minutes (about a 1/4 cup extra milk too) then cooked 10 mins more.  3. Made sure to beat the egg & then wisk in the milk before adding to rice/milk mixture(you won't end up with egg pieces in pudding).   4. I doubled the vanilla & left out the butter & raisins. Love it!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Try it BEFORE knocking it. This is an EXCELLENT recipe! Produces a nice, creamy white rice pudding -- very similiar to a name brand product in the grocery store. It is not "eggy" at all. I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of adding the eggs. Be sure to temper your eggs before adding them to the hot rice mixture -- or you will end up with scrambled eggs in your pudding. Thanks for sharing Erica. If you are using leftover rice, be sure to watch your measurements! You'll need to double the amount of rice.

This is a family favorite and also a great way to use my left over rice at dinner time.  Jasmine rice is the best I have used so far.

This was insane-in a good way.  Followed exactly. I mixed egg with remaining milk and added some of the cooking rice mixture to it to temper it. No scrambling!

With such high ratings from so many people I thought I would love this recipe. I think I prefer baked rice pudding for a few reasons - its not as rich as this was and the eggs started to cook even though I stirred it as soon as I put it in. I found it really gross to get a few pieces of cooked egg while eating it. It was a very good recipe, but I won't make it again.

Oh, ho ho!  I didn't think my hubby could be any more pleased with my cooking...until tonight!  I HATE rice pudding...I mean REALLY hate the stuff.  I have always had it cold, gloppy, and bland.  However, he LOVES rice...and adores rice pudding.  So, I gave it a shot.  I didn't change much...I used Jasmine rice because that's what I had, half & half (to make it a little richer for him), a good dose of cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg.  He was RAVING!  Both of my girls (7 & 2) LOVED it!  I had to try a little bite just because...and I LOVED IT!!!!!!!  Definitely will be making this again...THANKS!

This recipe was really simple and just what I was looking for.  I used some brown rice left over from dinner a few nights before just for something different. It took a little longer to cook but it still came out delicious and had the nice extra chew factor of the brown rice.

Sooo good!  The ultimate comfort food!  I used leftover basmati rice and omitted the raisins, and added a tiny pinch of cardamom and a dash of cinammon while cooking.  I beat the egg into the last 1/2 c milk and just slowly whisked it in.  Stir stir stir!

This recipe always turns out perfect! If you have never made rice pudding, or have made it many times, it's one to try. At Christmas it's fun to use dried cranberries instead of raisins, and I've done it with no fruit at all. Over all a great recipe, easy to make while dinner is cooking for a fast, delicious dessert!

This is a wonderful recipe...quick, easy and yummy.  I doubled this recipe.  Added a teaspoon of allspice and a tablespoon of cinnamon. I followed the other reviewers suggestions with the tempering of egg. After adding the egg, I simmered for additonal 5 mins.  Will make again.

YUM! Had some leftover Basmati Rice..worked great and smelled wonderful, of course. Definitely temper the egg mixture before adding to the pot but didn't find any need to wait on the sugar just started everything cold and brought it up to temp slowly over med. heat. Also used canned condensed milk to give it an extra creamy feel. MMMMMMMMMMMMMM! Way better than my mom's recipe...but don't tell her I said that!

This is pretty good, although a bit sweet for my taste. You can easily get away with using half the sugar and no vanilla. If you use long grain rice, an immersion blender will help with the consistency.

For rice pudding, I've never tasted any better.  Stick to the recipe please, and use the medium grain rice. Don't use your day-old rice unless you absolutely have to - it blends so much better that way. This is some yummy comfort food.

I'm not too familiar with rice pudding but I think this turned out great. I omitted the raisins and added cinnamon. This is one of my husband’s favorite childhood treats and this is how he remembers it.  I was very careful to temper the egg before mixing it in and the consistency was nice and creamy with no hint of stringy egg. To temper, I whisked the last 1/2 cup milk with the egg and gradually added about a cup of the hot portion a spoonful at a time while continuously stirring. I then  dumped that back in, kept stirring and it did the trick.

I learned that you can NOT use skim milk and expect it to be creamy, however.... it had a nice flavor to it that made up for it. Not a total loss for my first rice pudding :)

Soooo wonderful! I left out the cinnamon, and I found it was perfect. 
I used short grain rice and it is extremely creamy. I followed another suggestion about the timing of the sugar & about adding the egg. 
This is recipe is going to be a regular in our fall/winter menu.

Thanks to the previous reviewers who mentioned to temper the egg first--I probably wouldn't have thought to do it until it was too late otherwise!

Other reviews mentioned that to get the recipe creamy, you should use short or medium grain rice. Well, since I have bags and bags of long grain, I wasn't about to go buy more for just one recipe. I don't know how much creamier it could be with the shorter grains, but mine turned out great. I did cook only 2/3 of a cup, and *still* had 2/3 of cooked rice left over that I had to pull out; 3/4 C. of long grain would make too much for the recipe!  
For those who like cinnamon in their pudding, I added mine right in the water with a pinch of salt to infuse it right into the rice.
I also soaked my raisins while the rice was cooking (something I do whenever I bake with raisins so that they don't end up dried up, crunchy, or worse, burnt mounds.)  
Very tasty!

What can I say? Simply perfect! I made a double batch using arborio rice. I skipped the raisins because I don't fancy raisins in my rice pudding.... mmmm so yummy. This is the first time my two year old and four year old have ever had rice pudding (my favorite!) and they LOVE it! I have tried about five other recipes and they all failed, this one worked like a charm! I will make this all the time now, thank you so much!!

I didn't think there was too much sugar at all, seemed just slightly sweet to me, just right! I don't know what other reviewers are doing wrong, my pudding is VERY creamy!! I did not change the recipe or instructions at ALL. I just cooked arborio rice in my rice cooker and used that as soon as it was done cooking... perfect!!!!

I've made this recipe four times so far and it never diappoints.  I usually don't add the golden raisins but did this time and I think it's a bit too much so I'll just at half the amount next time.  And I forgot to put in the sugar so I added it at the very end with no bad results at all - DELICIOUS! Added note*  I made again and beat the eggs in the last milk addition -- didn't have to worry about tempering the eggs - great!

Super Duper! Followed the recipe exactly with a medium grain rice. I would suggest however, only about 1/3 as many raisens.

Fantastic! My husband and kids loved it. My only suggestions are to add a little of the hot milk mixture to the eggs to temper them (so they don't scramble).  I also added a little fresh nutmeg.  This is a definite keeper!

I am not a big rice pudding fan, but I made this for a friend's birthday who LOVES it. Everyone seemed to love it, and the birthday girl said this recipe was better than the one she has used for years. Many asked for a copy the recipe, one of them asked several weeks after we made it :) Good recipe.

This is an awesome recipe as-is! Last time I made it, I used basmati rice and lite coconut milk for a dairy-free dessert and it was so delicious and creamy. I made the whole thing start to finish in my rice cooker and doubled the recipe. Next time I will quadruple it so there are leftovers! :)

This is great pudding! I modify it just a bit- I use almond extract instead of vanilla (a gourmet deli in my town does this and it tastes great. I also put a meringue on top and bake it a 400 degrees for 10 mins.

This is so good!  Very creamy and delicious. Like everyone else, I added a couple of pinches each of cinnamon and nutmeg, and tempered the egg to prevent scrambling.  I think I'm going to have to double the recipe next time :)

This pudding turned out creamy (as everyone else is saying).  It is a recipe for creamed rice rather than rice pudding.  I left out the butter and added 1/4 tsp cinnamon instead.  

The sugar is added too soon.  Once you add sudar to a creamed rice recipe, the rice will not break down further.  Test the consistency of the rice about 10 minutes after adding the milk to make sure that it suits, othersie the texture will not be great and the rice won't really be assimilated.

Another suggestion is to whisk the egg and final cup of milk before adding, and to whisk once added.

You can make this recipe in the rice cooker - a big bonus for busy mums. 

This is a good recipe to try, I would suggest you modify it to suit your tastes.

I've made this with both leftover cooked rice and rice that I cooked just for this pudding...and it's absolutely the BEST either way!  The only thing I do differently from the recipe is to temper the egg/milk with a little of the hot rice mixture just to make sure it stays super creamy.

This was a really nice, creamy rice pudding.

I used Soy Milk instead of dairy and added cranberries instead of raisins.

It cooked up nicely and we really enjoyed it!

I will definately make it again!

I've got basmati rice in my cooker for dinner...with lots extra so I can make this for breakfast for the third time in 2 weeks!  We love it.  I whisk the egg into the milk to avoid the potential problem of the egg "scrambling" in the mix.  I always make rice pudding with brown rice (SOOOOO much better nutritionally than white AND tastes better!), but from now on will always be making this easy recipe instead of my old baked one.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmm.....

OMG this is the best rice pudding ever. I followed everything to the letter but I used minute rice. I omitted the butter and added 1t vanilla and 1/2t nutmeg and 1/2t cinnamon.Plus I cooked the raisens in with the rice in phase 2. I also added some of the cooked rice mixture into the egg before adding the egg back to the rice. Soooo very good. 5 star plus

This recipe is excellent, but I wish I would have followed it exactly. On another persons suggestions, I added extra sugar and extra butter. It ended up tasting like candy this way. I did add a bit of cinnamon and a little extra vanilla. My hubby loved it.

This is a simple delicious dessert. I used
jasmine rice and it came out perfect. The only bad thing I can say about this is that my kids will no longer eat Kozy Shack, so I will be making this quite often!

This recipe is alright, however, I did not enjoy the taste of egg! This recipe is way better off without egg and with 1 cup of cream and 1 cup of milk! And less vanilla and less sugar!

My first and last recipe for rice pudding!  My sweetie is a fan of Kozy Shack, and he even liked it!  I left out the raisins and sprinkled a dash of cinnamon before serving.  I liked it better warm, while he liked it more the next day, cold.  What a great way to use up that leftover rice.  Thanks!

This is a great way to use leftover rice.  I am a huge rice pudding fan and this is one of the easiest to make and one of the best I have tasted.  I will definitely be making this often.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Great recipe! Will definitely make this again and again. Only made 2 minor changes to the recipe. Left out the raisins because I didn't have enough on hand. Also, added a pinch of cinnamon as some others suggested. Many thanks for the delicious recipe!

Heavenly! Don't leave out the raisins! It gives it the extra depth of flavor. I used half and half in place of the milk to make it more special.

What a great way to use up leftover rice.  This was wonderfully creamy, but a little too sweet for my tastes.  I'll use a little less sugar next time (and there will definitely be a next time for this recipe).  I added a sprinkle of cinnamon along with the raisins, which added a nice flavour.

Simply yummy.  Read reviews because other cooks do offer good suggestions.  I did add salt to my rice while it cooked.  I also started heating up the milk and sugar before the rice was done cooking. I microwaved my rice because frankly it always turns out the best for me that way.  Make sure your rice is the consistency you want before you add it to the milk.  It does not change too much, so don't count on too much additional cooking.  I added cinnamon to the egg mixture.  I liked it, but it still needs some tweaks for me.  Of course I tried it really hot.  I was so disappointed in the firs rice pudding I tried, I had to redeem myself.  It is creamy.

I have made this many times over and i follow it to the"T"  My husbands family loves it and my mother in law asks me to make it for her with her left over rice.  It is so easy and i seem to get better at it everytime i make it.  It tastes just like the Kozy shack kind.

Fabulous!  I made this with leftover brown rice and splenda.  I did use 1/3 cup of splenda though - it needed it.  I don't think there'll be any left for dessert tonight!

This was so rich and creamy, and tasted delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, only omitting raisins and vanilla, and I couldn't have been more pleased with the taste and texture of this one. Whenever I feel like having rice pudding, this is the recipe I will reach for every time!

Loved it!  I had leftover rice from dinner (enough to triple this recipe) and it came out perfectly.  I didn't have raisins, nor would my toddlers have eaten them, and this was still the right sweetness.  It was super easy to make and was done as I was finishing up the dishes!  I tend to look for 5 star recipes to try and I will add my 5 stars to the other 700+ reviews!

This is such a great recipe! It's absolutely FANTASTIC when made with sushi rice --> so creamy and ultra smooth. If sushi rice is hard to get, arborio works really well too.

YUM YUM YUM!!!  I LOVE rice pudding but finding a sugar free variety in the store is a challenge and expensive.  This was SO easy.  I used Splenda instead or sugar. 
In an effort to keep it super figure friendly I also substituted eggbeater for the eggs and used 2% low carb milk.  I left out the raisins and let hubby and kids add them if they wanted.  It was just such a yummy basic plain rice pudding.  I liked it warm with a generous sprinkle of cinnamon.  Hubby had a cold serving with raisins.  Both of us couldn't get enough.
And for a HUGE 1 cup serving mine only cost about 170 calories.  What a deal!!
I'll be making this a LOT!!!

This was an excellent rice pudding.  I made a batch a few days ago and am making a double batch this evening.  I added a little cinnamon and a dash of allspice.  Delicious.

Very good and easy, reminds me of my mothers. I think the raisins overpowered it; I might omit or decrease for next time. Other than that… It's a keeper!

Brand name rice pudding is so expensive, so I've stopped buying it, although I crave it all the time. I tried this recipe yesterday- and wow, it's good. I used 1% milk, and it thickened up just fine (in fact, it's so thick, that I had to add a little more milk to thin it out). I did it without raisins this time, but will add them the next time I make it. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

I made it a little different. I did not have any white rice, so I used instand brown rice, just put it in with the milk. I also only had skim milk so I needed to add just a little bit of corn starch mixed with water (slurry). I also did not use raisins, do not like them. I added cinnamon and nugmeg. Was a very good recipie, deifinatly will use again.

I have been looking for this recipe for a long time. It is the one I used to make when first married 40 years ago.

I agree it is the best and now I make it with Splenda. 
Thank you for bringing back memories.

I have looked all over for a recipe like this one!  The creamy texture is so creamy and the taste is perfect.   Just like my favorite restaurant.   Grandmas was not even this good!  Cooking time took much longer than it says but it was worth every minute.

I was searching for a rice pudding that tasted exactly how I remembered it...and this recipe does!  I did not have short-grained rice.  I only had Jasmine (Thai) rice, but it worked very well.  This rice is traditional in desserts.  I like the flavour.  Oh and for those of you who don't have any raisins, try using craisins (dried cranberries).  Very good!  Excellent recipe.  Thank you!

Really yummy! To make this an extra healthy snack or desert, I added 1/8 cup of infant cereal (to get extra iron) and I added an apple, chopped in small pieces.

This was delicious and perfect when still warm from cooking. My husband doesn't like it warm though, so I chilled before serving and it was way to thick and heavy. I used Arborio rice, maybe that's why...?

This is a great recipe. I used basmati rice because I find it to be the easiest white rice to cook. (1part rice:2 parts water, put over heat until it boils and little holes start to form in rice/water, cover and turn off heat leaving on burner, done it twenty minutes.)I also omitted the raisins and added coconut instead.

Yummy and really easy to make.  I used Korean sticky rice and cooked it in my rice cooker and then just scouped out 
1-1/2cups. Much easier then cooking on the stove.  I also added a little cinnamon to taste.

We give it a 5!  It's delicious, quick and flexible... can't ask for much more!  I made quite a few changes but I think this deserves a 5 for flexiblity too ... doubled recipe, doubled vanilla, used minute rice (3 c. water, 3 c. rice), used what we had for milk (3 c skim, 1 c 1%), added lots of cinnamon and skipped the raisins. It definitely needed cooking longer... maybe 25 mins, but came out creamy and delicious!

I had some rice that was overcooked and mushy, so I gave this a try.  It was easy and good, especially with cinnamon on top.  Good way to use overcooked rice.  Rice hardens when it gets cold, though.

"Five Star Recipe - Perfection!!!"{ says my husband, Peter. "The Master of all rice puddings!!!"  This is a beautiful, creamy pudding with just the right amount of sweetness when I cut down on the sugar a lilttle.  I double this recipe all the time, using soy or rice milk for our lactose-intolerant daughter, and leave out the raisins. We all love it!!!

It probably would have been better with traditional rice, but the basic recipe is very good.  Definitely add the raisins for more sweetness.  And I can't believe nobody suggested NUTMEG!

This was sooo awesome. I used minute rice, and didn't add the extra milk with the eggs. I also substituted the raisins with blueberries. I can't wait to have the leftovers for breakfast.

This was my first time making and tasting a rice pudding. I didn't have any trouble with the rice pudding thickening; it came out really thick and creamy. However, I was expecting the rice to break down more into an oatmeal or rice porridge-like consistency. I even added a bit more liquid and increased the cooking time by an extra 30-40 minutes to try to break down the rice grains even more but, in the end, the rice still retained its shape and texture. The taste was all right but it was like someone had dropped some cooked rice into my vanilla pudding. I was expecting it to be lumpy since I've seen rice puddings before, but I guess I was looking for something a little more uniform in texture. (I used fully cooked short-grain rice straight from my electric rice cooker which always cooks my rice to perfection) I also thought that 1/4 tsp salt was too much (I used table salt); if I were to make it again, I would reduce or leave the salt out altogether. Maybe this would've been better baked in the oven the traditional way.

Excellent! I simply used left over rice from dinner the other night. I also used regular raisins instead of golden. No one else in the family likes rice pudding and wouldn't try it..so sad.. more for me!!

This is the best rice pudding ever! I  have made it twice and it has been perfect both times. I added a bit more vanilla and sprinkled cinnamon over it also. It is very creamy and stayed that way after being refrigerated. A definite keeper!

I love this pudding. I used short grain rice which I bought by mistake. It doesn't work well for my fried rice recipes, so put it to good use making this pudding. The only change I made was using all of the cooked rice instead of the 1-1/2 the recipe called for and used 1/4 cup of evaporated milk for part of 1-3/4 cup of skim.

This was excellent. I started with  half evaporated and   half regular milk, and ended up adding quite a bit more milk, as I saw many other reviewers did, as well as a half teaspoon more vanilla extract. Yummy!

This is good if you don't have a lot of time, but I found out why most recipes call for baking it.  The milk bakes into the rice for hours, making the rice softer.  It is very hard to get the rice soft enough when you cook it on the stove.  The flavor was good, though.

Made this recipe for my husband and he rated it for me.  The recipe needed to be a bit sweeter and seemed to be missing something.  He suggested maybe a bit of cinnamon.  It was very creamy and thick which is just how he likes it.  Overall very good, just needs a bit of tweeking.  Thanks for sharing.

Unexpected surprise!  My son needed to bring a dish to school that they would have made in Medevial times. We made this recipe and his class mates loved it and the teacher wanted the recipe. I did add some extra seasonings but other than that followed the recipe closly.

My sister-in-law and I got a craving for rice pudding one night last week while I was at her house for dinner. So we logged on and found this quick and easy recipe! This is an excellent rice pudding. We doubled the vanilla, what it calls for just simply isn't enough, and we also sprinkled it with cinnamon and then topped our servings with a scoop of vanilla frozen yogurt. The cold frozen yogurt (or ice cream) on the warm pudding is awesome! The only complaint came from her husband who said he liked it, but he likes baked rice pudding better.

I had always been looking for a recipe for leftover rice.  Here it is- I'll make it again for sure.  
I followed some of the tips and added less sugar.  I also split the recipe in two when it came time to add the raisins as my husband loves them but my kids don't.  Also added the cinnamon.  Soo tasty.  My son even wants it  cold for lunch at school tomorrow.

This was the first rice pudding I ever made and it was brilliant, i added raisins but they made it too sweet and overpowered the actually rice pudding. Also i think there is too much sugar in the recipe but still it tasted great.

This recipe turned out great!  I was actually hoping for a rice pudding similar to one my mother-in-law made last night.  This one turned out much creamier and sweeter.  I did, however, bake it for about 30 minutes like another reviewer did and prefer the texture.

It was very good; it wasn't too sweet or too heavy.  I had some left over coconut rice I'd made earlier in the week, so I used that.  I didn't want this to be super super rich, but I didn't want to use skim milk (which is what we drink in the house), so I used a can evaporated milk.  Rather than adding the raisins straight from the box, I heated them on the stove with some rum in a separate pot to add flavor.

Someone complained about bits of egg in their pudding.  One thing you should know is you can't add eggs to a hot dish; they'll cook.  So before adding the egg, I tempered them by adding some of the rice mixture.

This was a good recipe! I forgot to add the last 1/2 cup of milk with the eggs so it was a little thick, but still really good. I omit the raisins- don't like them. Also really good served cold with cool whip mixed in.

Amazing rice pudding!  One reviewer compared it to Kozy Shack, which is just about right!  The taste was great, however, next time I will add more milk.  I enjoy my pudding slighty creamier.  This is one of my new favorites!!!

I added a little cinammon and nutmeg to it for more flavor, also used 1/2 a cup of heavy cream for extra creaminess. I added the egg to the cold milk/sugar/salt because I was worried it would 'scramble.' Finally, I didn't bother with the butter. This is absolutely DELICIOUS! Thanks so much, Erica!

Very simple recipe. The only changes I made were that I used 2 cups of a reconsituted can of evaporated milk (fat-free, no less) because I tend to burn regular milk on the stove and regular raisins rather than golden. It turned out fabulously, although next time I will leave out the raisins simply because my kid doesn't like them. But he just picked them out and ate the rice pudding anyway, which says a lot for how good it was.

I have been looking for a baked, yet creamy rice pudding like my gram used to make.  Tonight, I had a taste for rice pudding, but really didn't feel like waiting for the whole baking process, so I gave this one a try.  It is delicious! Reminds me of the brand you can get and the grocery store in those little containers, but much richer.  I used canned evaporated milk, which made a very rich dessert.  I don't like raisins, so I didn't add any of those.  I followed the exact directions and added a little cinnamon and nutmeg at the end.  I had to try some warm.  I thought it could have used a touch more sugar, but even without it it was great and may not be meant to be all that sweet.  Another addition to my recipe box.

This rice pudding was great!  I added a cinnamon stick while the rice was simmering, and the raisins.  I also added cinnamon at the end.  It was excellent warm, as I had never had it warm before.  I made it to give it to a friend, but I might have to make some more for myself.

I tried the recipe twice.  First time with long grain rice and 1% milk.  The result was okay, but more chewy than I wanted.  Second time I used a medium grain rice (Calrose rice) and 2% milk.  The result was fantastic- both taste and texture!

Wow this was very good!!!  Ever since I made a really bad batch of rice pudding I never wanted to make it again.  But after reading all the great reviews, I thought I'd give it one more try.  I'm very impressed with how it turned out.  I'll be making more of these often.  Thanks.

Delicious! I used leftover white rice from the Chinese restaurant and this turned out to be absolutely delicious. I omitted the raisins but stirred in just a little bit of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg at the end and it was sooo good.

Yum! I've never had rice pudding before, but my son wanted me to make it because we've been reading "the Pokey Little Puppy" and they have rice pudding in  the story. This was really good. I used skim milk and left out the rasins.

This is the best receipe!!  I made it richer and creamier by using short gain rice, which always works better for rice pudding, and half and half for the last portion added at the end.

I have been making this recipe for the past 5 years and it comes out perfect every time. I even tried using broken jasmine rice that I had handy and it came out even better than using the medium grain rice. Yummy! I also add a little extra sugar/vanilla to suit my taste.

This recipe is so wonderful - first of all, it's unbelievable easy!  Secondly, it really is delicious.  I used an extra egg yolk, because I wanted a bit more of a "custardy" flavor, and it was very good that way.  If you are looking for a quick, good way to make a dessert (especially if you have some leftover rice to get rid of), then here it is!  Enjoy!

This was the first time I've made rice pudding. The only type of rice I had in the house was long grain. While the flavor of the pudding was excellent, next time I will use short or medium grain rice as the submitter mentioned in her introductory remarks. While I love the golden raisins and cinnamon, the kids (conditioned by Kozy Shack) asked me to leave it out next time.

Not my mothers unfortunately - hers is baked and egg-custardy.  But for stovetop I can't complain at all.  I used leftover bazmati rice which required more cooking time in the milk.

Excellent!  What a great way to use leftover rice!  I was a little nervous that it was not thick enough, but as it cools, it firms.  My husband and I love to top it with a little whip cream and cinnamon.  YUM!

THE rice pudding. As mentioned by others, don't be stingy with the milk... the starch in the rice will firm the pudding as it cools. I like to use day-old rice and triple the raisins!

Quite good, I only used one pot.  Just as nice as those much-trickier to make ones that you need to bake, and less mess afterwards - even though my pot boiled over when unattended with milk in it.  (And, it didn't burn even at that, though it did need less cooking time.)

I've always hated rice pudding, but my 2 1/2 year old loves it and always asks us to buy it at the grocery store.  I got tired of paying 3.50 for a container of rice pudding that turned watery the next day, so I tried this recipe.  Oh my!  Even I could eat this.  We skipped the raisins and he eats it cold, so we refrigerated overnight, then added a little extra milk to keep it creamy.  I used whole milk to make this and it was really wonderful.  My son said it was better than the store bought.

I just made this recipe tonight! Mmmm it was good. Flavourful! Yummy. Creamy as promised. My rock hard raisins willfully softened with 2 minutes of boiling. After about 12 minutes in step 1, the rice started burning so I stopped there. This is an easy quick recipe that I think you will enjoy. No waiting overnight, and yummy results.

My family loves rice pudding- and this was no exception. I would suggest adding flavor to it though, using fruit, cinnamon, etc..because it does lack in that department.

I love rice pudding but hadn't made it in years because my family didn't care for it.  When one of my daughters recently discovered that she loves rice pudding too, I couldn't wait to make it.  This recipe is wonderful.  She and I ate the entire batch ourselves in one day!  It's also great because I always have the ingredients on hand.

This is the end of my "quest" for the perfect rice pudding. I adored it warm, my husband preferred it cold, my mom almost ate all of it!! A great recipe for leftover rice from last night's Chinese food. Regular raisins worked fine.
Erica, thank you for submitting this awesome recipe...keep them coming, please.

OH... MY... GOSH!!! This is the recipe I've searching for! This tastes exactly like the "rice" that was served at my elementary school too many years ago to mention, and it is still served there today because it's such a hit with the kids and staff.

Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Easy, rich and comforting. I added cinnamon and crushed drained pineapple and omitted the raisins.
Excellent!

I was looking for something quick and healthy and this was just it! I had no problem making it low fat by putting less sugar, skim milk and fat reduced butter. It tastes just like the rice puddings you get in restaurants. Spices definetely added a nice flavour to it. Thanks for sharing!

I have been looking for a recipe for Rice pudding for a long time.  My Mom makes it like this and have always found recipes that require baking.  This is great!  I make our main course and make extra rice.  When we are through I whip this up and have dessert.  Perfect!

WOW.  This is so good it's insane.  I doubled the recipie and ended up with more than I could handle, and found out it doesn't preserve and re-heat very well (refrigerated leftovers turned out best when I added milk, stirred it, then microwaved it), but under normal (re: sane) circumstances you won't have any leftovers!

Yum! I omitted the raisins and used short-grain rice. I also added a little nutmeg. I served it with a sauce made from peaches and nectarines, and half their weight in caster sugar (about 250g of fruit). The fruit were skinned, diced and cooked over a low heat until all the sugar had dissolved, with a little lemon rind added. Perfect combination!

This was the first time I had ever prepared or eaten rice pudding.  It was so good, I can't wait to have it again.  I used a rice cooker to cook the rice because I can't ever seem to boil it on the stove.

Ah the perfect rice pudding recipe!  But temper the eggs before putting them into the hot rice and milk  or you will end up with cooked eggs and chunks.  Tat goes without saying, but some people dont know to do it who arent used to quick custards. .  

Just take some of the hot mixture out in a bowl, add some of the milk to it to cool it a bit, add lightly beaten egg to THAT quickly and SLOWLY add it to the pot of rice and milk while constantly stirring it .

Awesome recipe, very easy to follow and have fantastic results. I tweaked mine slightly by using vanilla flavored almond milk and adding in pieces of cinnamon bark. It came out amazing and I will definitely be making this again.

This is a delicious recipe. Creamy, warm and comforting. Especially, with a sprinkling of cinnamon.
To Jackie. The recipe said to use white rice. You decided to use brown rice. Naturally brown rice is chewy. I don't see how it's the OP's fault when you changed the recipe. 
Whenever adding raw egg into hot mixtures, you must temper them 1st to keep them from scrambling.
I'm guessing you don't cook much not to know about tempering eggs and the fact that using brown rice instead of white rice will change the texture of a dish. Sometimes trying to make desserts healthier just turns out to be disastrous. It's dessert. To make it a healthy dish defeats the purpose, doesn't it? It's no longer a dessert.
So, I don't think the OP deserves 2 stars since the substitution was your mistake.

This. Is. Delicious! I followed the directions as written. I read a few reviews that mentioned the egg cooking before it had a chance to be stirred in, so I just combined the beaten egg with the remaining 1/2 cup of milk and it turned out great!

Really wish the timing about the sugar was mentioned in the directions.  The mixture needs to be your preferred consistency before adding the sugar.  Also If you mix the egg and milk before adding, there’s less of a chance you get egg drops.

10 thousand stars....SUPER yummy. Excellent recipe. I doubled the recipe easily.
 I used Calrose short grain rice. Also, i used. Half Swerve and half sugar but it wasn't sweet enough. I just ended up making simple syrup and adding a little at a time til perfection.
I can't stop eating so, I'm starting another double batch.
Giving some to my sister and neighbors to enjoy.

This is delicious rice pudding. My husband loves rice pudding so I thought I would try this recipe. He loved it!  I did add my butter and salt to the rice when it is cooking.  I also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, and I added the raisins right after I added the milk and sugar to make them a little softer. Other than this I followed the recipe and it turned out great!

This is my new favorite rice pudding recipe. I doubled it and it was perfect. I used slightly less sugar and no raisins nor cinnamon. Before putting the eggs in I tempered them with 1/4 cup of the rice pudding mixture then poured the egg mixture into the pan.

I should have rated this long before now, as I've been making it for several years. Since I always baked my rice puddings, I was skeptical about a stove top version. I shouldn't have been. This is THE best rice pudding I've ever made or tasted. No, no substitutions. It's perfect as is.

I made this with jasmime rice and 2% milk and no raisins(I don't like them cooked).
I made it exactly like the recipe called for but double.
This recipe really should tell people to temper the eggs though. I  beat the eggs in the reserved milk then slowly added spoonfuls of hot pudding until the egg/milk mixture was almost hot then I slowly stirred it into the hot pudding.
Very yummy and so much better than store bought.
And it is pretty good with a touch of cinnamon like others have suggested.

To make this recipe 10x better, is to add cinnamon stick into the pudding while cooking then once finished top off with ground cinnamon!

WOW!! I made enough for 12 people and All Recipes adjusted the measurements. The ONLY changes that I made was I added cinnamon on top and omitted the raisins.  I used Goya medium grain rice (ratio 2 c. water to 1 c. rice) I did some research and long grain would have not worked as well.  This is amazing. Definitely a keeper.

Making any custard or pudding is as much art as skill and chemistry! Like Peggy says in her review, you add sugar later if you want the rice to be a good consistency. I disagree with MANY methods that Erica G. tells you to do in this recipe: I've never heard of anyone using the egg whites (I only use the yolks,), and she doesn't tell you to TEMPER the EGGS yolks before adding to hot milk! THIS IS KEY!!!  I'm HIGHLY disappointed in the person who shared this recipe for not explaining that you need to TEMPER EGG YOLKS by mixing 1-4 or more (slowly)Tablespoons of the hot milk to the eggs 1st to warm them while stirring eggs  constantly, THEN add to the milk, while stirring constantly -VERY IMPORTANT! Also, the recipe should mention several things: 1) the type of white rice that works best (some people need specifics like this & mention if 1 type works better than another) Note-I use JASMINE rice because it's fragrant and a nice grain size, but you should try Basmati or another, but NOT Minute Rice!  2) This pudding is not going to thicken after 20 min. on the stove! WHAT??!! If you mix 1 Tablespoon of corn starch  (1T per 2 cups milk about) with a few tablespoons COLD milk and add to the pudding exactly like you did with eggs (temper 1st), then stir constantly as it thickens in about 5-8 minutes. 3) Cooking milk with rice and sugar will NOT thicken and it needs to be stirred! 4) Erica G., I don't know why you tell people to add 1 cup COLD milk and whole eggs (including the white

Great simple recipe. I just wish the servings on this app/site would tell you how much a serving is. It says 4 servings but idk how much one of the servings is unless I measure it out, which I can do with this recipe but not with a lot of them. For this recipe it made 3.5 cups for 4 servings so it's about 3/4 per serving for anyone wondering!!! Still love the recipe and site, just wish we'd get to know this about what we're making

I had some left over Bismanti rice from cooking some Indian food. So I decided to try making Rice Pudding. Didn't have any raisins so I left that out. This came out wonderful and thick I did add two minutes longer after the last milk and egg was added ( afraid of uncooked eggs ).

I love rice pudding, but hate store bought and never made it. I decided to make this one. I absolutely loved it, I like my rice pudding thick and firm, I used extra long grain rice, I also omitted the raisins and cinnamon and once it was chilled it was perfect. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing

I would make again. I used about 1/4 cup sugar and it was great. Also made it with short grain and medium grain rice. Definitely use the medium grain as the short grain rice was chewy and did not prefer.

This was great!!! My mom used to make a baked rice pudding that i could never seem to copy and this tastes just like it!! 
I doubled the recipe and added 1 1/2 tbsp nutmeg and left out raisins. Mine didn't thicken up like it should've but i think i should've cooked it a little longer since I made 2x the recipe. (lol hine sight right, duh)So will do that Next time. Thank you so much

My first time ever making rice pudding!! It turned out delicious! I did,however, change some things. I used no sugar, I instead used about half a can of fat free sweetened condensed milk added when the directions say to add last 1/2 cup milk! Also, the raisins I prepared the same way you would for raisin puff cookies; add 1 cup to 1 cup water in saucepan with 1 tsp vanilla, slow boil til all water is absorbed.. makes delicious plump raisins! Added some cinnamon and voila! Creamy, delicious rice pudding =)) definitely recommend these tweeks !

This is wonderful and incredibly easy. I am not an intuitive cook and easily mess up recipes, but this is fool-proof and resulted in the creamiest, loveliest rice pudding --- like the kind my grandmother made in Sweden. I followed the directions exactly and wouldn't change a thing. One note: use Arborio rice (short grain rice). It is the standard for rice puddings and risottos.

Very sweet, thick, and creamy. I followed the recipe, but I had about  1 1/3 cup rice cooked medium grain white rice. It turned very thick before I added the egg and the rest of the milk (I added 1/2 cup of cream instead). Added a drop extra vanilla.  Full sugar, which was fine when the pudding was warm but 1/4 cup would have been better for when cold. I followed the rec of adding some warm milk/rice to the beaten egg before adding it to the whole mix. The egg blended in very well and cooked very quickly. I skipped the raisins and added shredded coconut at the very end. Should have given the coconut shreds at least 5 min to cook and soften... Would have liked it even thinner (maybe an extra 1/2-1 cup of milk at the end. Maybe skip the cream or the butter? Don't eat too much!

very good not too sweet. some advice to keep egg from curdling when you add it. take some hot milk from the pot and gradually add that to the egg while continuing to whisk. When the egg is warmer it wont curdle from adding it to the mix too quickly. I did not have raisins (husband doesn't like them) but that didn't hurt this recipe at all

When the pudding did not set up well enough, I put it in the microwave on 50% power for 3 minutes.  It set up quite well and saved me hours of heating up their kitchen.

This is a nice every day sort of dessert and a great way to get lots of low fat milk into the family.  I have made this many times and it is always a hit.  Whenever I make white rice for dinner, I cook extra and make pudding the next day.  Works well with the pre-cooked rice right out of the refrigerator.  Stir a little butter into the rice while it is still hot to keep it from forming chunks while cooling. 

Some notes on the versatility of this recipe: doubling or tripling the recipe works fine & so does using low fat milk.  I like to grate a little fresh nutmeg on the top or stir in some cinnamon with the vanilla and butter.  I have also soaked the raisins in rum or orange juice, then drained.  I've added cumin pods to the first batch of milk, then removed them before adding the raisins.  Great with either long or short grain white rice, but don't use brown rice in this recipe.

I've made this several times over the years, but today is the day I've decided to leave a review. It's really good.

I was worried about which grain rice to use, but to be honest, I think any of them do just fine.  I also streamline many of the steps. I use the same pan I cooked the rice in, as I'd rather not have as many dishes. I combine the sugar, salt, milk and egg altogether, then pour it straight in and stir. It's never taken me the full 15-20 minutes to get a nice thick pudding. Maybe six at the most.  After I've finished adding the butter and vanilla, I cover the pan and let it sit until just warm. Then I sprinkle some cinnamon over the top. Yummmm.

Edit 11/6/2016 - It's wonderful as is, but I made a few tweaks today that have made it even better. 

I let the rice sit for about a half hour before adding a room temperature mixture of milk/sugar/salt.  I also tossed the egg in and beat it in the mixture. Then I brought it to the thickned state. I increased the milk by another 1/4 c, bringing the total to 3/4 c . Then I increased the vanilla to a teaspoon. Much creamier and vanilla-y.

This was wonderful! I don't like raisins, so I didn't add them, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. For those that added the egg and it got chunky I suggest beating that with the 1/2 C milk and then slowly adding it while constantly stirring off the burner. There was enough heat to cook the eggs through while avoiding curdling.

Ok, so seriously.... I never sign up for anything, I swear. I actually used my mom's email address for five years cause I was too lazy to create one but this was just so freaking good, I had to make an account and give it a review.  Best pudding/ dessert/ creamy goodness ever. I doubled the recipe and added 5 minutes to the cooking time. Perfecto!!

Easy recipe.  I read through a few comments and made it right away.  Followed the recipe as is, and pretty much stirred constantly.  I did add a pinch each of cinnamon and nutmeg at the end, for added flavor.  Delicious!  Made it for my father-in-law who is British, for Father's Day 2015!

This is amazingly good! First time ever making rice pudding. EVER. It came out perfect. Just sweet enough. Didn't change anything on the recipe and it was perfect! I was worried because I used skim milk but again, it's to die for yummy!!

This was my first time making rice pudding.  I found the recipe simple and easy to follow.  My results were lovely.  Very creamy and sweet (I love sweet!).  I used basmati rice, whole milk (3.25%), and placed a cinnamon stick in the pot while the rice cooked.  And like other reviews, I tempered my egg to ensure it didn't scramble.  My only complaint is the raisins did not become full & plump.  Next time I'll try either adding the raisins earlier or cooking it longer after they're added.  I really feel fully plump raisins are much better than semi-shriveled. 
I look forward to experimenting with other flavors using this recipe.  Like perhaps orange zest or using other dried fruits and/or nuts.  I know the Spanish use cinnamon and lemon zest, Hungarian: raisins, cinnamon and cocoa.  In Turkey, they broil the top similar to a creme brulee.  They're are so many variations to try.
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Perfect. I did add cinnamon for preference and since I used long grain rice I added more milk and cooked it longer.

I've never written a review before on a recipe, but I cannot miss the opportunity to do so on this one.  I've made it several times and it always turns out delicious.  I love rice pudding and this is the first recipe that I've made that really turns out creamy the way I like it. Good stuff!!!!

This was so darn good.  The only changes I made was use 1/2 nonfat milk and 1/2 heavy cream.  It was rich and creamy. I just loved it...thank you for the recipe.

This is one of the only recipes that came out exactly how I wanted it to. I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the raisins because...come on, raisins? I also used appriva sugar substitue because my dad is a diabetic. One piece of advice; make sure the rice is very soft before you add any other ingredients. I added more water to get it to the right consistency before adding the milk. I made perfect rice pudding first try :)

Holy cow this recipe is amazing! I took some to a friend just out of the hospital (as well as the unbelievable Pot Pie IV from this site) so she and her family could have some good old-fashioned comfort food.  This definitely filled the bill.  It was soooooo creamy and good.  I used arborio rice as suggested by a reviewer and it definitely gave it the creaminess it deserved.  I'm going to make some for us tonight - can't wait!

I would definitely advice against adding the egg  solo, and follow some if the reviewers input and mix in with a bit of milk and let stand at room temperature or mix in a little rice pudding at a time into the egg itself before (slowly) pouring the mixture into the pot. Sadly, I ended up with some "egg white" rice pudding. :(

I added a little more milk and omitted the raisins.  At the end, I topped with a little cinnamon.  Just s pinch. After 21 years, My wife has finally said it was better than her Grandmother's.  Mission accomplished.

Made this pudding yesterday and it was delicious. I used Nounou concentrated milk for the last 1/2 cup I added and I think it made the pudding even creamier. Definitely worth trying!

Absolutely amazing. I've been married 47 years, on and off I've tried so many different recipes for rice pudding but never got a nice creamy one like this. I used alborio rice for mine and sprinkled grated nutmeg on each dish. Thank you very, very much.....with your help I finally cracked it!  I must add .....don't make it too much in advance because it congeals and becomes dry.  If that happens add lots more milk to make it creamy again.
Serve with ice cream or cream.

Just delicious!  We bought an expensive basmati rice that was supposed to be perfect every time, but is always starchy and anything but.  It does make a perfect rice pudding though! I found the recipe when my kids wouldn't eat their rice and it's now my go-to! So easy and yummy!

Very easy recipe.  My grandma used to make rice pudding and while this isn't quite it, it still reminds me of it.  Sooooo good and sooo creamy.  Last weekend I made 1 serving and my husband and I ate it up within a  day o.O  I put a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg when i add the vanilla extract.

I really liked this!   I did not add raisins but did add a little cinnamon.  It tasted great while still warm.  I used instant rice instead of regular rice so it was very quick to make.  Would definitely make this again.  Maybe I would use just a little less rice next time.

This is my go-to rice pudding recipe! I’ve made it many times now and the only change I make is using dried cherries instead of the raisins (I let them simmer with the rice). I use 2% milk and substitute cream for the last 1/2c... sweet, creamy perfection!

This is a great rice pudding recipe. I used minute rice (long grain) and the texture is perfect! I added a little cinnamon and used 2% milk. I added the sugar after the rice had thickened up with the milk as many reviewers suggested.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I loved it! Very creamy with great taste, this pudding is spectacular! I cut out on the rasins and it turned out fine... I personally thought the egg went well with the pudding and it was just overall very good! That's just my taste though.

Such an easy recipe that is absolutely delicious!! I would highly recommend. I used coconut sugar instead of white sugar as it was what I had on hand. Substituted for the exact same amount and gave it a warm, beautiful brown color to the pudding. I completely forgot the butter, but it was still so creamy and delicious without it. Also added some cinnamon and nutmeg which added some nice spice. Definitely don't need two pots! I made it all in one.

This is a pretty much foolproof recipe!  If (like me) you sometimes have any chunks of impossibly hard brown sugar-- I use them in this recipe.  While the rice is cooking, I soak the chunks in the milk in the saucepan--they soften and melt, so all is ready for the rice when it's finished.  It does make the rice pudding a caramel color, so I don't do that for company.  I don't like raisins, but have used dried cranberries, dates etc.

Absolutely Awesome !!!. I have recently tried baking a Southern Style Rice Pudding in the oven and it was good, but this recipe calls for making it on the top of the stove, which in my opinion is no comparison. 
If you make it exactly as is, and use the right ingredients you'll be in HEAVEN.

The only deviation i did was add very little cinnamon and nutmeg as i was cooking, just enough to keep the color  of the finish product white and creamy. My family devoured it before eating dinner. REMEMBER to use the short gain rice and the best ingredients. Again, this was great, the best i ever had.

I have tried other recipes before but this one is by far my favorite. I didn't add Salt, Raisins, or butter.  No salt, because I chose not to. No raisins because they were expired. No butter because there was no butter. 
Used Skim milk. (Only type of milk that was on hand).

This recipe is a religious experience! I'm glad I saw that this recipe makes more rice than 1 1/2 cups though, so measure the cooked rice. I followed a reviewer's suggestion to use flavored creamer. I used 1c milk, 1/2c flavored creamer. (Creme Brule). I also used less sugar because of this. I also put the cinnamon & nutmeg in while I was cooking the rice with milk. It becomes infused with the flavor! I tasted it when done, & my eyes rolled into the back of my head!! I didn't expect it to taste so heavenly, as this is only the second time I have made homemade pudding. You will LOVE it!

I never knew it was so easy to make incredible tasting rice pudding!  I made some yesterday and am making a  double batch today.  If you love rice pudding, give this a try.  I left out the raisins.  I used long grain white rice and it is much better than my favorite store bought.   Just need to watch closely while the rice and milk is thickening ... i added the second half of the milk first then slowly with the beaten egg... I think this would prevent the problem one reviewer had of the egg cooking quickly and creating chucks...that didn't happen to me... give it a try, you and your tasters will thank you.

This is a near perfect recipe! I come back to it every time. The only change I have started making after the first time, is that I add a teaspoon of cinnamon. You just can't have a perfect rice pudding without it! ?

Woke this morning craving rice pudding for breakfast. Last night we had an unseasoned rice mix for dinner (dried carrot, and other veggies with rice but no herbs or spices) I thought "Well, we make quick breads with veggies" and went for it! What a wonderful pudding! Creamy and flavorful. I got 5 large servings and that is without raisins. Really, 1/3 cup of sugar for 5 servings isn't bad-but next time I'll try 1/4 cup sugar. Remember to temper the egg and milk mixture before adding it to the cooked rice and milk. I added a little cinnamon and a vanilla pod to the milk.

This was perfect for making Rice Cake. So easy and quick. I doubled the recipe and added 1 extra egg. After cooling down, I've poured it into a white-bread dough covered baking tin and cooked in the oven for another 30 min. Delicious.

this is my go-to midnight, afternoon, and every single time I'm hungry snack. I'm addicted. I can almost eat this whole thing by myself. It is my true weakness. Also, I don't use the raisins and I use arborio short grain rice.

Not too bad at all. It was my first time making it at home. I soaked my raisins in vanilla water over night. Only had regular raisins too. Added some of the cooking fluids to egg/milk mixture before adding to pot. Came out super creamy next time will make it some.

The recipe is delicious and I altered it a bit to suit my taste. And yes, I too used the same pan for completing the recipe once the rice was cooked. Don't be afraid to cook the rice longer for best texture. 

 I cut the sugar in 1/2 and used skim and regular milk combination. By doing so it is  important to add 15-20 minutes more cooking time after adding the milk. This allows the pudding to thicken. I also used fewer raisins. Thanks for this great recipe as I am trying to cut back on gluten. I eat it  morning, noon and night. LJ

Delicious and easy to make! I did add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg, as others had, but I also used a combination of 1 C half and half, 1/2 C milk and 1/2 C chai tea (boxed concentrate). No problems thickening >phew

I make rice pudding if there is left over rice from dinner, usually the next day. Followed the recipe almost exactly, I just added the milk into the pot that i had my left over rice already in, and I added cinnamon and nutmeg. Used Thompson raisins because that's what I had. Delish!

I love this recipe as a whole but I have such!!! a hard time getting it to the "thick and creamy stage" of this recipe  before adding my egg and milk... When I finally get it there it is a great recipe and much faster than double boiling In the oven, but overall  a wonderful recipe.

I enjoyed it.  I cooked it a little longer on low heat for a creamier texture. My son also liked it, but he is not a fan of raisins.

Absolutely love this recipe. I used Jasmine rice which has become one of my favorites for just about any recipe and added cinnamon and nutmeg for added flavor. This will definitely be one I make again and again.

this rice pudding was very creamy and comforting I did leave out the raisins because we did not have any and I added one tsp of cinnamon to the pudding with the vanilla and butter the egg did scramble a little but I hardly noticed it when eating.

Amazing !!!!  Creamy!  I used arborio rice and evaporated milk. Tends to be on the sweet side so next time I will reduce sugar to one cup. I will definitely make again!

Easy, creamy rice pudding. Used leftover rice from Chinese takeout. Only added 1/4 cup of sugar and it was sweet enough for my family.

It was great. I used the same saucepan for mixing everything in for easier clean up and added the raisins later, due to cooking for a picky eater. But everyone loved it, I'm definitely making it again.

Great recipe for rice pudding. I omitted the raisins as no one here eats them. I also used Mexican Vanilla extract and cinnamon to try to achieve the flavor of rice pudding I had before. This was my first attempt and we really enjoyed it, as did my boys. The only reason I omitted a star is it doesn't specify which type of rice. I only had long grain and while it was OK, I really think medium grain rice would be a much better choice. I slowly stirred in the egg and had no issues with it cooking too quickly.

I love rice pudding, to the point I make it almost daily! Ive tried a few different recipes, and this one is by father the best! Not to mention it's the easiest to make! I have three children and They all love it too, even my picky 8 year old came back for seconds!  Thank-you for sharing! My family is asking me to make another batch, and I literally just finished the first! Lol

One day Jim & I were speaking foods that our parents made many yrs ago & just how delicous  they really were.  Jim's favourite was rice pudding. I have tried two different recipes in the last month & he absolutely loves the creamy texture of this one.  We used dark brown raisins even though it called for golden.  Our vanilla was from Moroco & that too added to the taste; cinnamon & nutmeg sprinkled on top. Note must remember to double it next time.  Recommended.

Great recipe. Reminds me of the rice pudding I had as a child! Easy to make. Only one pot is needed for this recipe. I added a vanilla bean, milk and cinnamon, but delayed adding the sugar until the milk began to thicken a bit. Every other step I followed to the T. FINALLY!

This was the best rice pudding recipe I have ever had HANDS DOWN!   I used arborio rice which I think made a huge difference in making it so creamy.    One person told me she doesn't like raisins but in this recipe loved them!    My son loves when I make this!  That's all the review I need.

Best and easiest rice pudding ever! I used leftover jasmine rice, whole milk, and golden raisins. We ate it all before it was chilled. I am making a second batch to try it cold, but I can't imagine it tasting any better.

Just made it, and it's the best rice pudding I've ever had. Very creamy, and so easy to add/leave out whatever ingredients you like/don't. I made it exactly as written with some leftover coconut jasmine rice - added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and perfection!

I am giving this rice pudding a thumbs up! It is creamy sweet.  Easy to follow very simple quick and very good. You can add more things  to it but it is perfect,, with a dash of cinnamon before serving... you will be the hit!!

I thought this was a great recipe. I added some cinnamon and I used white rice leftover from a Chinese take out. It was too tasty for words!

I have never tasted  rice pudding so creamy.  For years i have been baking it in the oven never happy with the results.  My lord this recipe brought brilliant childhood memories. It is fantastic warm or cold.  My cross country daughter said mom?  How could you make such a small bowl?  Thank your mother in person or in your prayers!  Best rice pudding I have ever had.  Thank you!

This was perfect!!! It had the right amount of ingredients, sugar content, perfect, vanilla perfect and milk, I used all the ingredients and their measurements as listed (besides using skin milk and no raisins) and it is sooo delicious! I'm so glad I tried this recipe. Really hit the spot. I also took the advice of a reviewer and mixed some of the pudding that was in the pot to the beaten egg and mixed a little and slowly poured in to the final cooking phase. Worked great. I love this recipe so comforting!!! Will make again!!

I used arborio rice, and added the milk directly to the pot with all the rice (I didn't use a separate pot and I didn't measure out the rice). I also added cinnamon and nutmeg. It was perfect comfort food.

This was easy and good.  I used Arborio rice and whole milk.  Whole milk is always better for rice pudding!  You can add a cinnamon stick or a vanilla bean to spice it up.
Delicious.

Great recipe. The only thing I changed was adding 1/8 tsp ground cinnamon. It gave it that extra little flavor kick. Yummy!

This is so YUMMY!  I've never made rice pudding before and decided to try it out tonight with some left over rice.  I did use 1cup milk and 1/2 cup half n half to start with.  After reading some reviews I used a little less sugar and  poured some of the rice mixture into my egg and milk mixture so the eggs wouldn't cook too fast in my pan.  I didn't realize I was supposed to add vanilla when I was done cooking.  I put the vanilla and a little cinnamon in with my egg/milk mixture. It turned out just fine. I had made blue ribbon extra long grain rice for dinner so that it was I used.  My rice pudding turned out nice and creamy and not to thick and delicious.  Perfect.  I will definitely make again!! Thanks for a great recipe.  *I did omit the raisins b/c I didn't have any.

First time I've ever made this recipe. It is super creamy. Not as thick as a custard. The amount of sugar and vanilla is right on. My 3 and 5 year olds loved it warm as their bedtime snack. I do think next time I'll add an extra egg to see if I can get more of a custard pudding.

this was really good and easy to make for a 15 year old. I love rice pudding and decided to make it one day. So, i googled rice pudding recipes and this was the first one. I read the reviews and of course there were many great reviews. also, there were very many bad reviews. I have to say it was a success, at least for me. I have made it  twice and was great in flavor, and consistency as long as you make sure the rice is cooked properly. I added 3/4 of a cup of milk towards the end because i found that it got really thick and stifflike, i like it creamy so thats why i added the extra milk. Overall this was great recipe, very simple. I really liked it and so did my little sister(:

You may be thrown off by this recipe's simplicity, but I assure you it's as good or better than any I've tried.  Due to being out of regular milk, I used Meyenberg's Goat Milk (powdered) and it was AMAZING!! Much creamier and a richer flavor than cow's milk and as I understand easier for some to digest.  Also, I rinse the rice 3-4 times with water and prepared in the usual manner as white boiled rice then proceed to step 2.  I think you will love the GOAT MILK!!

I made a batch of this Rice Pudding, and although hubby and I were the only ones who ate it and enjoyed it, we loved it just the same.  Didn't add raisins, I think I used a bit more spice tho, great recipe, Erica G, thank you for sharing!

This is spot on. As a former pastry chef the one suggestion I can add is I added some of the sugar over the raisins then a bit of water and ran in microwave two 40 second cycles which allows the fruit to plump up a bit more. If you have a place to find a good vanilla bean that also adds a ton of flavor but overall this is a really good recipe.

this is a great recipe..I've followed the recipe step by step and I've used leftover rice and the results have been appreciated by everyone I've served it to. I like the traditional raisin and cinnamon  on a cold winter day.But my favourite version is dried cranberries ,instead of raisins and a little orange zest for brighter taste.

This is an amazing recipe and is the same as my Mom's recipe for rice pudding. But you put the rice in with the water, you should not let the water boil first because when it will finally boil half or more of the water will evaporate, then you won't have enough water for the rice to soak it up and become the right size and will be hard ans stale.

Other then that, I love this recipe

I had never made rice pudding before but I have always loved it. After reading a comment about someone saying to use evaporated milk for a creamier pudding I decided I would try that. I used a 12oz can for the initial 1 1/2 cups you boil and used 2% milk for the other 1/2 cup. That is the only change I made to this recipe and it is amazing! Since first trying it 3 weeks ago, I have now made it 3 times and it comes out perfect every time.I actually joined this site just to make sure i could leave a good rating for this and make sure i could save the recipe to share with others.

i had some left over brown rice, so decided to use it in this recipe. Yummy doesnt describe how delicious this recipe is! I also used organic unbleached sugar and felt that not only was is sooo tasty but also a lot healthier than cake or other desserts (which i LOVE). I will definetely be making this again.

I liked the simplicity of this recipe.

I substituted coconut milk both times and added some cinnamon.  The 2nd time I doubled the recipe and had to spice it up with ground ginger, allspice, and more cinnamon and my son said he preferred the 2nd version.  The basic recipe is still good.

Being on a low-cholesterol diet, I substituted almond milk, Egg Beaters, and Benecol, and it turned out fine.  I also added the golden raisins earlier, when I combined the cooked rice with the almond milk, sugar, and salt.

Loved it, only thing I would add is to temper the egg by mixing with remainder of milk and then slowly adding little spoonfuls of the warm mixture before adding to the pot.

Made as written with a medium grain rice and I left out the raisins. I really liked it. My BF loves rice pudding but I don't recall ever having it before. I guess I am one of the few that wants to add sugar to this one. We topped ours off with cinnamon and whipped cream.

I followed the instructions in this recipe exactly as written. It was super easy and I didn't have any problem with my egg scrambling, as some others mentioned. I left out the raisins, and added extra cinnamon at the end, since that is my personal preference. Overall, this was a very simple and very delicious recipe, which is right up my alley! Thanks for posting it.

Great recipe. Have actually made this many times. Not really much to change. I tend to add a little nutmeg which gives it more of a warm taste. The best I ever made this though was due to the quality of the butter. Choose real good butter with loads of taste and it will make all the difference. I also add a little cream with the milk at the end. Forget the diet! If you want the taste. Gerry In Italy

cooking of milk & sugar, did not get creamy.  cooked 20 min.  Added the beaten egg & milk and it didn't thicken. added the raisins  and vanilla & butter.  It looks like the egg cooked like in egg drop soup.  Is not creamy.  I will probably add a package of french vanilla instant pudding to it and hope it is salvageable.

Thank you for the recipe...Is just fantastic.
I would rate it 10 if I could.
I doubled the recipe and used a blend of milks (available at home): condensed milk, non fat milk and a bit of Buttermilk...I cooked for a few minutes less as it started to get thick faster...Sooooo Delicious!

Oh boy is this ever delicious!! I ended up making it with brown rice since that was all I had. Took quite a bit longer, but still yummy. I made it exactly as called for, and although it is great, I did find it a little on the sweet side. Will definitely cut sugar to 1/4 cp next time.

While this isn't the best rice pudding you will ever eat, it is yummy and well worth it for such little effort.  I made it without the egg as we have an allergy in my house and it worked out just fine.  It's a wonderful way to use up leftover rice, which we seem to have a lot of.

I have tried many rice pudding recipes with never the desired results. Something was always wrong. After making this I think I was never cooking the rice/milk mixture long enough. After 15 min I could see it start to thicken. It is very tricky with the egg, although I tempered it I still had a big hunk of white not incorporating with the milk. I just removed it. Next time I will make sure the egg mixture is well incorporated in the milk. I might use a mixer but still temper. I am an experienced cook and could never understand why I couldn't make rice pudding.

Rice pudding is one of my husbands favorites and I have not been able to find it in our local stores. This was soooo good! Made a couple of changes as suggested by other reviewers. Added butter, salt, and sugar with rice to boiling water. I only had long grain rice (Minute Rice) and was afraid it would not turn out, but I just cooked it and extra 5 minutes after adding the 1 1/2 cups skim milk. Will be making this often!

Very easy and regular pantry ingredients that taste so good together! I increased vanilla extract to 1 tsp the second time I made it and it was a good move, it just enriched the already great flavor. I used a mixture of monk fruit and regular sugar

I made this for my husband (who loves rice pudding) and another guy. I used jasmine rice and made it exactly as the recipe is written except that they both said they thought they'd prefer it without the raisins, so I didn't put them in. They raved about it. I sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg on mine and thought it was a big improvement.

I had never made rice pudding before but had a lot of leftover rice I needed to use up so thought I'd give this a try due to the good reviews. It was absolutely delicious!!! I doubled the recipe and used 2 cups of half and half, 2 cups of 1% milk and 1 cup of sugar. It was very rich and addictive. Had it for breakfast, lunch and dinner until it was all gone!

Better & easier than my Mom's.  I used leftover steamed rice from a Chinese take-out order, also used 1/2 cup of cream instead of milk. Cinnamon & nutmeg to taste. My husband likes his topped with sliced strawberries or raspberries!  Yum.  -Dessa

I've always liked rice pudding, but this gives me the recipe I need to make it at home.  I use the rice cooker to make the rice (since apparently making stovetop rice is beyond me), but then follow directions as written.  I tend to add extra raisins, along with cinnamon, nutmeg, and sometimes a pinch of saffron to deepen the flavor.  Perfect comfort food for gray days.

It was incredible! I used sticky rice made from our rice cooker and purposefully made extra rice just for this. I didn't have raisins but used chopped dried cherries and it was the best rice pudding I've ever had! Not too sweet, perfectly thick. Also sprinkled with cinnamon and nutmeg like others have mentioned as well. Definitely worth the little bit of stirring while it thickens and will make this every time I make rice.

I have made this rice pudding three times now.  Twice with Arborio rice, which is very soft when cooked and used for risotto; and once, this morning, with short grain brown rice, which gives it wonderful chewy texture.  I love both.  I use maple syrup instead of sugar, and it makes the rice pudding even creamier.  I don't use raisins, but I do sprinkle some ground cinnamon on top.  Fantastic.  The only rice pudding recipe I'll ever need.  Reminds me of childhood, but this is even better.  I didn't think that was possible, but it is. Make sure you make a double batch.  I can assure you that you will want to eat a double portion!

Pretty tasty recipe.  Easy to make. Yeah, some stirring is involved, but it's worth it. I skipped the raisins...not much into raisins.  I recommend it.

I have tried so many rice pudding recipes & this by far, turned out the best.  I didn't have whole milk so I reduced my 1% milk slightly & added half & half to make the milk approximate whole milk.  Very creamy consistency.

I just made this recipe, and it is WONDERFUL! I had some left over rice from last nights dinner that I decided to use for the pudding, When I started getting everything together, I realized that I was out of milk, ( My grandkids had been over last night) So I used Evaporated milk instead, and added a Cinnamon stick while cooking, I changed nothing else about the recipe. My husband and I both love it!!

I'd never made rice pudding before but I had a craving so I found a recipe. It was delicious! I used basmati rice, because it was what I had, and tempered the egg as advised by other reviewers. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg and reduced the sugar a little. Yum!

I made this for my family with some leftover rice and they loved it. I made it again and added another egg to make it more custardy. My wife said "Bookmark that one!"

I made this recipe with some left over brown rice and skim milk and it still turned out delicious!! Super easy and relatively fast (compared to using the oven as I have in the past.) If you beat the egg separately in a small bowl and then add it while stirring, you don't get chunks of cooked egg in the pudding.

This is a lovely rice pudding! I added. 1/4 t of cinnamon and left out the raisins due to family preference. Biggest tip is to ensure you temper your eggs before adding them to your hot pudding! Oh and let it cool a bit before you start shoveling it in your mouth:)

So easy to make. I made a few modifications by adding chai tea to the hot milk before I added the rice. Also added nutmeg allspice and cinnamon.  Never make enough of this. Really is my favorite dessert.

Outstanding and the best recipe for rice pudding without having to bake it. We like this with extra raisins and I use a little bit of sugar to cook the rice so the rice comes out a little sweet. I also add cinnamon sticks during the cooking process.  The creamiest ever great job Erica G!

Have tried many recipes- this is the only one I have liked to date- one of my hubby's favs though & this is the first time he's said a RP recipe is a keeper.  Mods made based on other user suggestions: used 1/2 heavy whipping cream & 1/2 2% milk- added an additional 1/8 cup of sugar, used only 1/2 of the raisins (still thought there were too many though...) but overall very good & will be making again.  (Sprinkled w/ cinnamon & nutmeg before serving.)

This is the easiest rice pudding recipe I've tried, and it turns out great every time!  We always have rice going in our rice cooker, and this is a great with a fresh batch or as a way to use up the last of a batch that is about to turn hard.

This is fabulous! Love It. There is a couple things that I did differently. I cooked the rice with a special rice cooker I have, to make sure it was cooked FULLY. I only used 1 1/2 cup of cooked rice, which it a little confusing in the directions. Wasn't sure if she was referring to the uncooked rice amount. Next time, so there isn't so much left overs, I'd would just cook a 1/2 cup of rice. I cooked this very slowly, since this is my first time ever making it. I would suggest reducing the amount of sugar. It is very sweet. I also halved the amount of vanilla, since I am not a big fan, and it was a perfect amount.  Thank you! You have fixed my sweet tooth!

Just made this and it was wonderful. I used a can of evaporated milk to cook with the rice, salt and sugar though. Added some cinnamon and gotta say, it is perfect for a cold day comfort food.

I really liked this! I was trying to think of something to do with extra milk we had on hand. This was a winner!  I followed the recipe as written but we had no raisins.  Didn't miss them.  Adding egg surprised me but it worked out. I was nervous with the cooking time so I let it simmer a little longer after the egg went in.  So amazing warm right off the stove.  Can't wait for more tonight when it chills.

A wonderful recipe! This is my go-to recipe when I am making a special treat for my father. I generally use 1% milk and pearl rice, but it's hard to mess up this recipe.  A few of the other comments posted mention bits of cooked egg in the finished dish, so I just want to mention that tempering the eggs will prevent this from happening.  Tempering refers to the process by which the temperature of the mixture with the egg is increased gradually by pouring some of the hot (rice, sugar, milk) mixture into it and stirring it vigorously before pouring it all back in the hot mixture.

Oh man, this is good. But I used coconut milk and brown sugar, and no butter. I have never eat rice pudding before and never cooked it before either. I have a few kids that I cook for and have milk and soy allergies so coconut milk is a happy medium.

I like this recipe because it is excellent and so much faster to make than the traditional recipe my grandmother used to make; cooking the rice in the milk. I added powdered skim milk to the milk and egg mixture in the end to make it taste more similar to the Latinamerican style of arroz con leche, which calls for condensed milk. It turned out great! Thx

So yummy! I used vanilla almond milk and stevia. I didn't stir the egg quick enough and it chunked a little but not enough to stop me from eating it all. I'll stir quicker next time.

If you like rice pudding you will love this recipe. I made it a few day's ago and did not change a thing.  I made it again tonight and only used half the raisins called for and added about 1 tsp. in the rice pudding while it was cooking then sprinkled some on the top after I poured it into a dish. Great recipe for left over rice. All the ingredients I had on hand.....how easy is that!!!!

This is a very tasty rice pudding. And for all the reviewers saying it was very thin and never thickened it might have been the type of rice you were using because it thickened perfect for me. I used minute rice because I've always made rice pudding with minute rice and it always makes it perfect. Make your minute rice and then use a 1 1/2 cups of that to make the pudding. Also I made it just like the directions stated and it was delicious, however it did kinda leave that egg taste in the back of the mouth, so next time I will omit the egg.

I grew up with my grandmother's rice pudding and that has been the "gold standard" for me as rice pudding is one of my favorite things on the planet.  I loved this recipe because of it's simplicity and quick prep time.  While nothing will replace the old fashioned oven baked rice pudding this is a "gold standard" for quick prep rice pudding.  I will be adding this to my recipe box and calling on it often I'm sure.  One can't ask for a better recipe.

I have NEVER been able to make good rice pudding until I tried this one.  HAHA, when I started the recipe, my oldest son said "Not again Mom" and now, he has eaten 1/2 of it.  Thank you for a GREAT recipe!!

Excellent!  I made this with instant rice which chopped off 20 minutes from the prep time.  It was still creamy with that nice "pudding" consistency.  I added cinnamon to the butter at the last step - mmmmm!  So easy this just became a new family favorite!

This is a great recipe, however I always make the recipe my own, so I changed it a bit. My husband hates rice pudding & he enjoyed this recipe. Here are my alterations. Please give this a try, it is delicious. I used 2C. Cooked Rice - 1C. Pumpkin Creamer - 1C. Half  & Half - 2T. Sugar - 1/4t. Salt ( I cooked as directed for this recipe ) I mixed 1 Beaten Egg to 1/2 C. Half & Half, I added this as well as 1/2C. Raisins to the rice mixture ( I continued following the cooking directions ) I removed the rice mixture from the heat & stirred in 2t. Vanilla, 2T. Butter, 1t. Cinnamon & 1/4t. Nutmeg. I refrigerated the rice pudding until cold & served it with
 a dolop of whipped cream ( not whipped topping, the kind in the plastic tub, it is too sweet for this)

I followed directions as directed, mine did not come out creamy at all and it made 6 one half cups servings With using 2 cups of milk, how could it be 4 servings? I would not give this even one star rating if I could.

I feel the most important parts are the stirring consistently at the end for 2 minutes, and tempering your eggs! I did not have any egg parts in my pudding and it tasted perfect and was so thick and creamy. Love this recipe! Very easy to make and delicious!

Just made this rice pudding and it's the creamiest best rice pudding I ever made. I followed Peggy's review and since I had cooked the rice earlier, I put it in the milk before I put the sugar in and made sure it was warm and soft.

I worked for an elderly gentleman for 5 years and once a month he would ask for rice pudding because he ate it everyday. I would always buy him a container of Koji pudding since he said it tasted the most like how he use to make it before he couldn't cook anymore. Poor Bruce! If I'd known how easy rice pudding was to make I could've saved all that $$ and made it for him! I added a touch of nutmeg and it brought back his memory since I can't see or taste rice pudding with our thinking of that sweet old man. May he rest in peace. Thank you.

Yummy rice pudding!  I've use my mother's recipe for years, but this one was easier and really delicious!
I made a batch with Quinoa that turned out amazing too (straight substitution for the rice). It needed an extra few minutes to cook, but was sweet with the nutty flavour of the quinoa.  Fantastic!

I make horchatas, and needed something to do with the left over rice.  I used this rice, and made 4x the original serving sizes for my rice pudding.  It ended up awesome!  It took much longer to make once the rice was in the milk, though.  If you end up making huge amounts of pudding and the milk isn't getting all thick, just chill and keep cooking it, cuz it worked and it was super delicious.

This is my "go-to" recipe for rice pudding. I've been making it for years. Whole family loves it. I don't like a dry pudding and this one is NOT that. It really is creamy and delicious. My 80 year old mother just requested that I make some again soon. I'm doing that today! :)

Easy to follow recipe, a must for us rice pudding amateurs. It had good flavor and you can change the consistency to what you like. I did follow the tip of adding some hot mixture to the egg and milk to bring it to temperature before mixing it in.

I had left-over take out Chinese rice .. So skipped 1st step & decreased salt to 1/8 teas. I also tempered the milk/whisked egg with some of the cooked rice mixture a tabl.. At a time. Turned out perfectly! Chilled, topped with nutmeg. & dollop of whipped heavy cream (sugared) ... No leftovers! (no raisins in this attempt, but will def. add next time)

Tips for people trying to use brown rice, you can't make rice pudding with brown rice. It will NEVER turn out the same as white rice. Brown rice will always be more chewy, it wont dissolve and mush up like white rice will. You wont get the same starch to thicken it either. As for the egg, you can't really just dump it in.... Egg+heat=scrambled eggs, you need to quickly mix it in a bit at a time or temper it in a separate bowl by mixing a little of the hot mixture in at a time until it matches the pots heat. Also, nice recipe, very tasty if you follow the directions:)

I made this in my rice cooker, thereby only using one pot and that made clean-up easier.  Just watch the heat settings - I switched down to warm once the milk got hot.  Also, I used stevia instead of sugar - made no difference.  Super-easy and tasty!

Lovely as is. Also enjoy this substituting a tin of coconut milk for the homogenized milk or flavouring milk with almond extract. Thank you.

I used leftover rice from a Chinese restaurant. Since they use short grain rice, the pudding turned out very creamy. I used fat free half and half and 1% milk. I also added 1/2 tsp of freshly ground cardamom (in a double recipe). If you like cardamom, it makes it wonderful!

Be careful adding the egg. I mixed it with the second batch of milk and poured it in VERY SLOWLY so it wouldn't turn to scrambled eggs.

Really good, easy and a great use for leftover rice.  I added cinnamon sugar on top.

This is a great creamy recipe.  I used long grain rice and 1% milk.  It just takes a little more cooking to get it a softer consistency.  I also left out the raisins as my wife doesn't like them.  I don't ever cut the sugar...it's a dessert for goodness sake.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg to mine because it's not a rice pudding without them.  

My family loved it and as a bit of a dessert snob, I must say I haven't had one as creamy as this ever.

I am what most people would easily label "a horrible cook", but managed to make the best rice pudding I've ever tasted by following this easy recipe. I can't wait to make it again (the 4 servings go fast around here.) I omitted raisins just out of personal preference and used half and half. Definitely recommend this recipe!

Exactly what I was looking for.  I'd been cooking all weekend and had rice left over from Friday night's dinner, so as the weekend wound down I found I had nothing for dessert and since Sunday dinner is the only one served with dessert at my house I had to do something fast. I was able to put this together in no time and had a great end to dinner.  The only thing I did differently was temper the egg mixture first with some of the warm pudding before adding to the pan.  Hubby loved it. Thanks so much.  I'll be using this again.

Just tried this as written. It is the BEST rice pudding I have ever tasted. It was easy to make. I have tried many recipes taking much more time and ingredients that can not come close. A must try. Just a note. Make sure to use a medium or short grain rice for rice pudding. The end result is much better. And for the novice cook, remember to temper your egg before adding to your pot or you may find scrambled egg in your rice.

Excellent! I mixed the egg well with the last 1/2 c. milk, poured it in a thin stream and eliminated the raisins because my husband is not a fan. It turned out so so so good!!!

I prepped about 6 cups of long grain white rice and had about 2 cups that wouldn't fit in the container. So I found this recipe. I used a rough measurement of 1.5-2 cups of rice, simmered with the milk stirring often. When it was the consistency of a risotto and the bottom of the pan shown through during stirring I added the rest of the milk, egg and raisins. Then stirred constantly for more than the 2 minutes. I added a dash more sugar after the vanilla and added cinnamon to the whole batch, tasting along the way for sweetness and flavor. SOOO good! I will use med grain if I have it next time but with enough stirring the long grain is creamy too. Perfect use of leftovers, will be making often!

Absolutely amazing!!!  I used brown rice and it turned out great!!!  I did make the rice according to the package which made 3 cups of rice!  So I can either double it or save the other half for later :) My family gobbled this up!!  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

This is a really good, easy base recipe.  It's great as is or it can be changed slightly to match what you have in the house.  I didn't have raisins so I put a little orange zest in with the milk and added cran-raisins.  A bit of cinnamon is wonderful addition.

Great recipe!! Slightly altered mine. The store didn't have any golden raisins in stock so I used the regular ones. Also I wanted to use a better sugar substitute (I don't like Splenda). So used coconut sugar instead! The recipe turned out SO delicious! Sprinkled some cinnamon on top and my children ages 18 months, 3 years, & 5 years, gobbled the whole thing up! I did manage to get a taste and it was amazing! I'll be using this recipe along with the coconut sugar from now on! But it looks like I'll also need to increase the serving size!! :D

This recipe was really easy and MUCH tastier than I even expected.  I used fat and lactose free milk which I think actually made a difference. Lactose free milk is a little bit thicker so it seemed to help with the creaminess (I'd be careful with Lactaid the brand as it seems sweeter than other lactose free milk).  I also used Jasmine rice which made the pudding a little lighter.  DE-lish!  My boyfriend loved it too!  I will definitely be making it again.

I made this with almond milk instead of dairy and it came out very well.  I used equal parts milk to rice and it was still plenty creamy.  Also, cut back on the sugar and egg.  And blueberries instead of raisins.

Way too much rice... this is more like a sweet rice pilaf. Change it to 3/4 cup cooked and skip to step 2 and then it is delicious!

My husband's grandmother used to make him rice pudding.  Since she passed, he's only had my two or three prior attempts.  While good, they were not "it".  Well, this IS IT!!  He was so pleased- transported back to when he was a child!  Follow the directions!  It always frustrates me to see poor reviews, then you read them, and the reviewer has changed EVERYTHING!  GRRR!  My only suggestions are: add some cinnamon- YUMM!  DO NOT rehydrate your raisins (I know, it doesn't call for that, but if you do, this will be a lovely soup- not a pudding!)  Finally, when adding the second part of the milk, mix your egg into the milk, then add enough of the hot mixture to bring the milk/egg to just over body temp- you eggs won't "scramble"!  This grateful wife says a BIG THANK YOU to Erica for posting this recipe!

Easy, creamy comfort food.  I omitted the vanilla and substituted coconut flavoring.  Added shredded coconut to the final step and topped with chopped walnuts and fresh pineapple in individual cups right before serving.  A cold weather pina colada served warm on a winter day!

I made a lower calorie version of this recipe. I substituted 1/3 cup granulated splenda for the sugar, substituted 1/2 tsp butter extract for the butter, used skim milk, and left out the raisins. I also used short grain rice. This version has about 1/2 the calories of the original version. I followed the directions exactly and it turned out excellent!

This is a wonderfully creamy rice pudding. I didn't have a problem putting in the sugar when the recipe called for it. If it's on low heat, there should be no problem. Of course, tweaking the recipe to suit you is much better. I doubled the recipe and used powdered milk mixed with water for half the milk in the recipe; the other half I used evaported milk. I think this doubled the creaminess. I don't like raisins much so I only put in a sprinkle. I also used one pan and it worked just fine. It was fabulous and easy to make, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a yummy rice pudding recipe.

This is so easy! I used 1/3 cup orange blossom honey (instead of the sugar) and a 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. I beat the egg into the remaining milk, and then poured it slowly into the mixture while stirring vigorously, to avoid the scrambled egg problem. Worked like a charm. Also, I was using left over sushi rice (no vinegar added). So now, we have a fun and yummy rice pudding to eat after sushi nights!

It was amazing!  All I had was long grain rice, I added more water when boiling and some butter.  That made it more creamy and less "al dente"...  My whole family loved it.  I'll be making this many many times in the future.

It was good when it was hot and creamy, but when it chilled it was like glue. I wouldn't make this particular recipe again, and I wouldn't put raisins in my rice pudding either, I liked it probably because I made it, but nobody else in my house could eat it.

Great recipe! I used Jasmine rice and added cinnamon sticks cause we love cinnamon. Also, i doubled the rice, butter, and vanilla. But i omitted the raisins. I think it's best served right after cooking it while it's warm !!!!!

I followed the advice of one who said to cook rice and sugar and salt together.  The flavor was good but it was alittle starchy.  Maybe i needed a bit more milk.  Will try again as i know it was me that did something wrong.  (and i did use med. rice).

I left out a little sugar - but added a generous tablespoon of honey. It did wonders for the flavor and consistency (it made it less starchy and more silky.  Delicious.

This is the BEST rice pudding recipe I've eaten. I thought my moms was the best until I made this! Even she said it was much better then hers. Its really easy to make and has a nice custard. A little cinnamon on top and its AMAZING. I might make another one tomorrow!

Perfect recipe.  I use basmati rice, which works well in puddings.  I also use whole milk to add to the creminess.  Instead of using vanilla extract, I suggest using split vanilla beans.  This gives enhances the vanilla taste and the specs of seeds throughout is beautiful.  I always quadruple the recipe since it goes so fast.

Super easy.  Fantastic taste.  I omitted raisins because we don't like them in our pudding.   I doubled the recipe and had plenty of rice left over that I put in the fridge.  

TIPS: KNOW YOUR RICE!  Rice comes in many different forms, short-medium-long-extra long grain.  The type of rice you use will GREATLY AFFECT your outcome.  USE MEDIUM GRAIN RICE when making rice pudding.  Short grain is very high in starch and will likely produce a very heavy, sticky and overly thick pudding that is mushy after cooking.  Long/extra long grain rice while much easier to make and with less starch content, will not give you the same mouth feel your use to in typical rice puddings.  Medium grain is the way to go.  

Temper your milk and eggs before adding them to your cooking pudding.  In a bowl on the counter add your smaller divided portion of milk and your beaten eggs.  After cooking your mixture on the stove for the 15-20 mins, add some of that hot liquid to the milk/egg bowl STIRRING CONSTANTLY for a few minutes and finger test for warmth.  When you think its hot enough add to your cooking mixture and stir to finish pudding.  Tempering like this ensure your eggs don't cook and become scrambled.

I had a whole box of rice left over from Chinese take-out that I did not want to toss - found this recipe, talk about yummy!  Easy to make, thick and creamy- great way to use up left over rice- eating it warm on a cold night Yum!  I can't wait to try it chilled for breakfast tomorrow morning.

Really good, very sweet.  Maybe cut down on the sugar a bit and cook it until it is thicker.

I have been on a quest to find the best rice pudding recipe out there, one that didn't require stirring on the stove for an hour.  I made this recipe with some leftover rice and almond milk, and it was so quick and delicious!  i will be making this for my kids for a long time to come.  Thanks!!

we cannot eat dairy, grains, or sugar so I followed another's advise and replaced the rice with quinoa and milk with unsweetened almond milk. I also replaced the sugar with 1/4 cup xylitol and 9 drops of stevia clear liquid. It was wonderful and very healthy for us! love it when we can adapt a great recipe to be healthier. yum....

I made this recipe last night, but since there was no vanilla on hand I used vanilla soy milk and a 1/8th cup of brown sugar. It was wonderful!!! I'm adding this to my holiday recipes this year. Great recipe Erica!

Absolutely divine!  I have baked rice pudding before, but never made it on the stovetop.  This was so easy.  I followed the directions, but I did leave out the raisins.  I want to eat the whole pot myself...but I shall refrain!  You MUST try this recipe!

This pudding was so good! I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup because I planned on topping with sweetened whipped cream. Sprinkled with cinnamon & nutmeg made it truly perfect and comforting on a cold Friday night!

I have never made rice pudding but I had some leftover rice that I did not want to just throw out so I came across this recipe which sounded easy and good. AND IT WAS! I followed the recipe exactly except that my rice was long grain but I simmered it for 30 minutes. I mixed the egg, milk, and raisins together and let them sit while cooking the rice mixture. I also let the butter and vanilla sit on the counter as well. I used only one saucepan and I tempered the egg mixture before adding it to the rice mixture, just in case. I will definitely make this again as I still have more leftover rice to use up and this is DELICIOUS!

Have made this several times with great results...so delicious! 

Had some leftover Quinoa to use up and thought I'd give it a go. I substituted the rice with the quinoa exactly and used almond milk instead of the 1% milk...it was sooo good!! A nice nutty taste and 'slightly' healthier :0

WOW!!! this is GREAT rice pudding.
I used half and half rather than milk and I used long grain rice because it's what I had on hand. Was very creamy. other than that I stuck to recipe.
Thanks this is a keeper

Not even scoopable ....a solid mass...waste of ingredients and major time......I just can not for the life of me make proper rice pudding.....will buy Cozy Shack next time....sorry.....I tried.....

This is a great recipe and I have made it a number of times.  After making it the first time, I learned to reduce the amount of raisins to 1/3 cup and omit about a tablespoon of sugar (it's very sweet).  The first time I made it I was concerned I wasn't adding enough rice, but 1 1/2 cups works just fine (you will have quite a bit of rice left in pan #1).

This recipe was incredible, even with skim milk. Just like mom used to make.

This recipe was super yummy.  I accidentally sloshed a little too much vanilla into the pan, but it still was good.  I'll definitely make it again!

Amazing! I've never been able to get the texture on rice pudding right, and this was perfect. The second time making it I experimented by decreasing the milk to 1 1/2 cups and added 1/2 cup of coconut milk at the end with about an 1/8 c of coconut shavings. Incredible! By far, the best rice pudding I've ever had :)

Perfect! I over cooked my rice and instead of tossing it in the trash I made this and it came out wonderful! I added cinnamon which gave it a nice finishing touch.

Nice and easy! This makes a creamy vanilla pudding with rice in it, which is not like an old-fashioned baked rice pudding which is thicker.  This fit the bill for what I needed to make. I substituted half of the milk with "light coconut milk" and used 2% milk. I also just used a wee little bit of unsalted butter to keep the fat down (and I added fat w/ the coconut milk)

Wow, this recipe is wonderful, and it couldn't be easier. I basically signed up on Allrecipes to review it! By the way, for anyone considering using a rice cooker to do the rice, go for it! I did, and everything came out perfectly.

Awesome recipe! I have made another recipe from a famous chef and this one was way better than that one! Just enough sugar and very creamy. I have been looking at this recipe for months. Glad I finally made it! Would recommend anyone to give it a try!

This was amazing! I usually cook the rice in the milk, but this way comes out great. I added 2 tablespoons of milk powder to the milk and blended all together. I didn't use a separate saucepan and after adding the milk/eggs/rice at the end I cooked 10 more minutes until it got the consistency I wanted. Overall, great, the flavor is delicious and very creamy.

Love this! I make it non-dairy by using a can of coconut milk (plus some other non-dairy milk to round it out to the 2 cups) and Earth Balance buttery sticks in place of the butter.  Great results!  It was met with rave reviews at the family picnic I brought it to.

OMG, this is soooooooo good.  Thanks for sharing.  I made this today and left out the raisins since noone really likes them in my house except me.  I can't believe how good this is.  I will never buy it from the store for the crazy prices again.
Thanks again...

I found this recipe to use up some leftover rice from my husband making twice as much as he should have for dinner last night. I made a double batch (yes, he made WAY to much rice last night),and put in a few dashes of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg at the same time as the raisins. It made a wonderful thick and creamy pudding that even my picky son enjoyed!

I do not eat rice pudding, but my father devoured the whole thing in less than a day!  He does add a dash of cinnamon and whipped cream.  

Super easy to make and a great way to use leftover rice or those Chinese take-out side dishes.

This was very good. My husband just loved it. I used almond milk instead of regualr milk, it gave it a good flavour. Next time I will use regular milk to see the differnce.
Nice and creamy, great taste.

mine turned out a bit soupy, as opposed to thick and creamy... otherwise it tasted great! I used extra vanilla in mine (is there such a thing as too much vanilla?) and sprinkled cinnamon sugar in just before adding the "extra" milk... yum! I'll try it with short-grain rice next time and see if it helps with the creamy factor!

This was great! Perfect consistency (not too runny). I made the following changes - I substituted the dairy milk with almond milk (Silk brand), and since the almond milk is already sweet, I reduced the sugar to 1/8 cup.  It was slightly sweet, but not sickeningly sweet - just the way I like it!

Maria and I liked.  Tastes similar to egg custard.  I think I like egg custard better, but I think this recipe could be altered more easily to make lower fat. Worth making again. Try some changes in smaller batches or with leftover rice. In the end I threw a large amount out; not sure if I would make again.

Great recipe and very simple, great for someone who has never made it before (like me!). I put some cinnamon in for a little bit of a different taste, but it tasted great without it!

I made this using leftover jasmine rice but omitted the raisins because my grandson doesn't like them. The rest of the recipe was made following the given directions and using 2% milk. This is a very easy but very flavorful recipe. Definitely a keeper! Thanks Erica!

Good bye Kozy Shack!  I love rice pudding and buy Kozy Shack sugar free all the time.  I was surfing recipes today and came across this one.  I am so happy that I decided to double it!  I did make a few changes using 2% milk and Stevia in place of the sugar.  I didn't have any raisins so just omitted them.  I sprinkled some cinnamon on top.  Even my sister loved it.  Thank you Erica for a great recipe.

This great when you cook the rice in Whipping Cream,instead of water .And use dissolving sugar,better known as Berry Sugar,then baked in the oven until golden on top.

I plump the raisins prior to adding them to the pudding by soaking them in hot water. My family used to put this into a buttered dish, sprinkle with nutmeg, dot with butter and place in the oven to brown. We also used to do this with elbow macaroni

wow! amazing and exactly what I wanted in a rice pudding!  I followed the steps of the recipe exactly, but thought the times were a bit off.  Cooking the rice and milk took about 35 minutes (not 20) and after tempering the milk/egg and adding back to the rice, it took closer to 10 minutes to get the right creamy consistency.  The results were well worth the time and stirring!

This is a wildly delicious recipe! Definitely a wonderful comfort food. The first time I made it was for company so I doubled the recipe. The only change I made was that I used 1% low fat milk. It got raves, and I had plenty left over for my friends to take home and leftovers for myself. It thickens so much after sitting in the fridge that I like to reheat it with a little low fat milk. And we all liked it with a little Reddi-whip on top.

Super easy and quick -- great way to use left-over rice! I followed the recipe, minus the raisins, and took into account the comment that suggested not adding the sugar until after the rice reaches the softness and consistency desired. It turned out perfect!

It is because I finely learned to use short grain or sticky rice, it made all the difference. It is creamy & yummy ! Love it !

This is a fabulous recipe!  I made horchata earlier today and had 3 cups of uncooked rice left over (from soaking in the water to make the "rice milk"). I did not want to throw away the rice so I decided to search for a rice pudding recipe. This one piqued my interest and I'm sure glad it did. It is absolutely worth trying.

This recipe is delicious! So much better than Cozy Shack & other store bought brands. It came out so creamy and tasty. I added 1/3 of sour cream to the egg & milk mixture like another reviewer had suggested, and it did bring out more of the creamy flavors to the pudding. The 2nd time I made it, I tried it without, and it tasted less dairy flavored, which my family liked as well. In my opinion, with or without the sour cream, it was spectacular!

No doubt, this is an amazing recipe and an incredibly easy one too. I’ve been on a quest for the PERFECT rice pudding for 10 years now: I tried everything… But this version got me the closest to the phenomenal rice pudding I’ve always (only) dreamt of. So, thank you so much for sharing. In my version, I do use more milk and sugar than suggested, and the last 1/5 cup of milk becomes 1/5 cup of heavy cream. It comes out really creamy as promised… but only as far as it’s still hot/warm/room-temperature. Strangely, this recipe advises to serve warm—I think of rice-pudding as a cold, out-of-the-fridge dessert. Warm is certainly delicious! However, and this is my question to the larger community of cooks and eaters out there, WHY DOES IT SOLIDIFY INTO A BLOB OF CONCRETE ONCE I PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE? How can I keep the moist and looseness also after a night of refrigeration? Any suggestions or ideas would be immensely appreciated. Thanks again. And bon appetit!

An easy and creamy rice pudding. I didn't bother using two different pots and it worked out fine. I may make this as a breakfast dish by taking out most of the sugar and adding fresh fruit.

Delicious! I had left over rice so made this...only change was that I made i used almond milk. Maybe it's because the almond milk is thicker but I only needed 1 1/2 cups ...I did not add the last 1/2 cup...just the egg etc. It was the perfect thickness and consistency. Could have  cut back on sugar too. Next time I will. Yum. It was a hit!

This is the ONLY rice pudding recipe that always comes out perfect!!!  I have used all kinds of rice...from leftover Jasmine, to Basmati, to Carolina long grain white rice and even leftover brown rice.  I adjust the cooking time according to the density of the rice.  I have also experimented with using skim milk and less sugar...and it still comes out really well, although a slightly different texture.  I love this recipe!!!

I like to use recipes that have a high number of reviews and this one is proof positive that our comments help others. The tip to not add the sugar till close to the end worked great for me. This is a great and easy recipe. I used leftover cooked basmati rice and my whole family loved it. I used sultana raisins as that is what I had on hand. I also add pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon. Thank you for a reminder of my childhood!

Simple, creamy, rich, lovely.  I used arborio rice so it has a pleasant chew as well.  I would like to try it with whole milk but used 2% and its great.  It was a tiny bit sweet for me, so I would subtract a couple of tablespoons next time (but that's just me I like custards to taste of pure milk).  Super easy to whip up and even cooled quickly.  I highly recommend.

I have never had rice pudding before but have a sense of how pudding should be like. This is a very simple recipe. I used broken jasmine rice (can be purchased in Asian markets) and put all the rice in pudding. I used 1 can (13 oz) of coconut milk in the pot and used 1 cup of 2% milk to mix with the egg and raisins. The cooking time was cut down to 5-7 mins instead of 15-20 mins since broken rice makes it thick quickly. It turned out really good. My husband couldn't believe this was my first rice pudding. Thank you for the easy recipe.

The best rice pudding I have ever made!! I will be printing this recipe and saving it, I don't see the need to ever use another recipe again. Thanks! I followed directions exactly (no raisins) and added cinnamon after. I had a pack of cinnamon sticks and thought about simmering one in the milk while it cooks but didn't...perhaps next time!

This recipe is out of this world, good! I doubled the measurements it calls for to make more and it still came out wonderful! I added 2 tsp cinnimon also. When you get a craving for rice pudding, THIS is the recipe you should use!

Excellent recipe. Takes some time, but was worth the effort. My first effort ended up a little over-reduced and wasn't quite creamy enough, but next time I was plan on taking it off the heat before it looks like it's the right consistency, because it continues to thicken as it cools.

I had some leftover white sticky rice that I used to make this pudding.  I left out the raisins, since I didn't have any on hand.  It's a delicious and very creamy pudding.  Definitely going in my recipe box for future use.

YUM!  I've never had rice pudding before, but it's definitely the first thing I'll make with leftover rice from now on.  I used extra long grain rice, as that's what we happened to have on hand, and it turned out to be delicious.  Next time I'll use short or medium grain rice, as many reviewers have said what a difference it makes.  I doubled the eggs and didn't add butter, and it was still great.

This was an adventure. I made the pudding as directed. Used skim milk and honey (a little less than a quarter cup). Cooked it as directed, tempered the egg mixture. However is was still kind of watery. I chalked this up as a failure. I put it in a 300 oven to keep warm 'til dessert time. And lo and behold when I took it out (about 20 min. later) it had set up! 
It tasted fantastic. Oh, did I mention that I soaked the raisins in spiced rum? That might have helped some :-) I will admit I was flying blind. I've never seen or eaten rice pudding. Only made it 'cuz my SIL was coming over and she loves it. She gave her kudos to this effort.

Awesome!!!! Be sure to use short grain rice so it is extra creamy. I also kept mine on low heat and cooked it until it was extra thick and creamy, maybe 20-25 minutes.....so creamy noone willmiss the cream.

I followed the directions, except did not add raisins. It should definately be served warm. After sitting for about 4 hours it dried out and I had to add more milk to make it creamy. It could have used more sugar as well.

I made this recipe with six of my home economics classes, and it was a real hit.  We used powdered milk, long grain rice, and dark raisins, and they still loved it! Thank you so much, I am making it for my husband and son with dinner tonight.

I live in the West Indies and a lot of baking supplies are too expensive here. A dessert based on rice is perfect, though. I added cloves, nutmeg, cocoa and cinnamon bark, just because their so available here. Next time I might substitute shredded coconut for the raisins.

I only had Minute Rice in the house, so I used that.  Also, I can't have dairy products, so I used canned coconut milk, and it turned out great!

This was a big hit at a family party.  My sisters always order Rice Pudding at restaurants and they said this was the best.  Thanks for sharing Erica.

AWESOME!  Followed the direction, but skipped the raisins and added a scant 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  YUM! Just like mom use to make. :)

This was very very good! I lost my grandma's recipe and this is the closest I have found. I doubled mine and also tempered my eggs and milk, also before cooking put raisins in a small bowl of hot water to plumb up. I added a little nutmeg towards the end. I have made this lots of times its my 84 yr old fathers favorite thing!

Excellent and very easy recipe for rice pudding. All I happened to have was either long grained or sushi rice which is a short grain so I opted for the sushi rice. I doubled the recipe and cut the sugar slightly and it turned out amazing! I debated between this and another far more labor intensive recipe. So glad I chose this one.

This was great. It was fast enough that I could do it on a whim after the kids went to bed.  Creamy and delicious, the only changes I made was to use cream for the last 1/2 cup and cranberries instead of raisins. My babies gobbled up the leftovers for breakfast the next morning. Highly recommended!

great tasting but took a while because I tripled the recipe...not recommended! Double would have been more than enough for my group of five...at least there will be leftovers! I added less milk and eggs at the end, and less vanilla, but did add cinnamon and nutmeg for taste.... so mmmmmmm!

An excellent, easy recipe!  I used one pot, skim milk, no raisins, and added cinnamon on top of each serving bowl - it was thick, creamy, and perfect.  I might try a bit less sugar next time (or maybe not as it was a huge hit).  Thanks!

This was my first attempt at a pudding.  The night before I had prepared rice with our meal and had about 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cups of rice left over. I made this recipe as stated and added 1/4 cup of coconut...delicious!  Thanks for an easy, great recipe!  My wife said for me to put a star by it with means do it again!!!

Thank you Erica for sharing this wonderful recipe. I followed the advise from Judy671, and mixed the egg, 1/2 cup of milk and the vanilla extract in a bowl and slowly poured it in the pot. I was really afraid that it would scramble, but it didn't. I also added 1 tblsp of brown sugar and sprinkled cinnamon in the mixture. It tasted soooo delicious. I will be making this again tonight.

This recipe is amazing!  Erica, thank you so much for putting your mom's recipe on here for all of of us to enjoy!  I ended up turning it into "Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding" by using 1/2 of a Madagascar Vanilla Bean as opposed to vanilla extract and left the raisins out as well as the butter.  I too salted the water that my rice was going to get cooked in as opposed to adding salt later.  One thing you should do: temper your egg before you put it into your milk and rice mixture.  Enjoy this recipe, it's an absolute keeper! Thanks again

Awesome recipe to work with. I used basmati rice and cooked the rice according to the package. Then I added 1 cup of milk and substituted the other half with heavy cream. (Thanksgiving leftover.) I left out the raisins. Also added a teaspoon of speculaas spices. (A dutch spice mixture consisting cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, white pepper, ginger, cardamom and mace.) This added an very nice flavor to the pudding.

I've never actually made rice pudding before, nor have I even tried it, but as far as pudding is concerned, it's delicious! With the rice, it's quite filling. I used leftover short-grain brown rice, but next time I have some leftover short-grain white rice, I'll try this again and see how the texture changes. Brown rice was a bit too chewy.

While simmering, I added about 1/4 cup extra milk to compensate for the drier brown rice. To make chocolate pudding, I substituted 2/3 cups  chocolate chips for the raisins and cut the sugar by about 1/3, adding the chips just before turning off the heat to add the butter and vanilla.

For good measure, I tempered my beaten egg with some of the warm mixture before adding it to the pot. I didn't want to risk having scrambled egg in my pudding!

Made with long-grain rice.  Tasted great!  We like it better after it's cooled off.  Will try again with medium grain rice to see if there's a difference.

Can't bake in Az in the summer, so I tried this on-stove rice pudding 5 minutes ago--tastes great--thanks!  I did not add raisins, because I had to do the more thrifty version first.

It was my first time making rice pudding and this was simple and delicious! I made it to use up some rice from the previous day that we didn't eat up, so I didn't have to worry about cooking the rice first. 
Then I used skim milk and brown rice and it still turned out great! I am sure I could have even cut down on the sugar if I wanted to make it even healthier! I think this is a great rice pudding and I will definitely make it again!

The recipe was easy and fast to make. I followed the recipe except I made sure the rice was cooked all the way first before using and I used medium grain rice which makes it creamier. The 3/4 C does yield more than 1 1/2 cups cooked rice but I found that it made the pudding creamier. It was really tasty and wonderful and easy! Thank you!!!!!

This rice pudding recipe is awesome! I used white Arborio rice.  I put the salt in the boiling water as some have suggested.  I constantly stirred the rice/milk mixture for 15 minutes on medium heat.  I took the advice of some and added the sugar AFTER cooking the rice/milk mixture.  I used the full 1/3 C. of sugar.  The rice pudding came out creamy and delicious!!

This has become a family favorite! It's even a nice dish for a brunch, potluck, etc. For that, I usually chill, then top with [real!] whipped cream.
I've been adding a sprinkle of mace, and using brown rice for extra nutrition. It's still delicious and the brown rice I buy is a medium grain rice. I agree that a short or med. grain rice definitely gets creamier, better results.
Great recipe; thanks for sharing!

I've made plenty of bad rice before, but I've never thought to put it in rice pudding.  This time, I googled "what to do with mushy rice," and it gave me this recipe.  It was wonderful!  And was a much better late dinner than my mushy rice would have been.

I made a lactose-free version using skim lactose-free milk and lactose free margerine. I used long grain rice (leftover in fridge). My 1/3 cup sugar was a rounded scoop to make it a little sweeter. I would stir the pot and walk away but towards the end of the 20 minutes I had to stay right there stirring it to prevent it from sticking. To prevent egg scrambling, I did as others suggested, and added 2 spoonfuls of the hot mix from the pot to the egg/milk.  Once I stirred that well, I added it into the pot. Since I had used margerine when I originally cooked the rice, I left it out. As for the vanilla, I added it to the egg/milk part of the recipe. The end result is tasty but I can really taste the vanilla. I think I will use a tiny bit less next time.

Great basic creamy recipe overall.  I suggest cooking the rice with a dash of salt and replacing a cup of milk with heavy cream.   I happened to have raisins mascerating in agave nectar and rum so I put a scoop of them in the finished pudding.  The rum added a certain something nice.  I made a batch tonight, it's setting in the fridge now.  When I serve it tomorrow, I'll whip some heavy cream and give it a dollop with a pinch of cinnamon.

Incredibly easy way to use my leftover rice. I didn't have raisins in the house, so I left those out, and used evaporated milk for the initial 1 1/2 cups. Also added a generous dash of cinnamon and nutmeg at the beginning of cooking.

I'm sure the raisins (if I had them) would have given a little variety in texture, or almonds or coconut might work as well.

I'll definitely be making this again.

I am blessed to have a raw milk dairy just a few miles away from home.  I made this pudding using 1-1/2 cups raw whole milk, and 1/2 cup raw heavy cream.  It was so good, I made it my lunch, dinner, and breakfast the next morning.  I also added lots of freshly ground cinnamon to the serving bowl.  YUM!

I LOVE this recipe. I made Minute Rice in the microwave to save some time, and mashed in some banana and nutmeg. I added almonds on top for some added protein, and threw on a handful of berries and made it my gluten free breakfast of choice! I will make this over and over again! Thank you for sharing your super easy recipe!

I've never had rice pudding before, so I had no idea to expect... but I had leftover rice (used to make Horchata), and a user recommended making the rice pudding out of it. YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!

Fantastic! For the first part of the recipe I used basmati rice which I cooked in a rice cooker. Then I moved it over to a saucepan,  and finished it up there. I disagree that it needs to be a short or medium grain rice. Basmati is the lowest on on the glycemic index and is delicious. And this rice pudding recipe had my family raving for more. It is definitely a keeper. As good as my grandmother used to make.  Would not change a thing about this recipe.

I agree it turned out really ricy. I would of liked it to be more creamy. I tried to add a little more milk in the end and cook it a little longer but it didnt help. I think next time i will try to cook all of the rice-milk mix for the 15-20 min and temper in the egg  with a few spoonfulld of the mix and add it back tot he pot. Or even concidering taking out the egg all together. we shall see. None the less took notes and will try again.

Admittedly I don't think I am a big fan of rice pudding, but I wanted to come up with a way to use my leftover rice from the chinese food. 

The flavor is very good. Just not sure about the texture. But I am sure that is why I am not a big fan of rice pudding. 

It would be great for breakfast or as a dessert.

Honestly, I'm not sure why this has gotten such great reviews.  Yes, it's easy to make ~ I made it exactly as written and the cooking times and measurements seem fine.  It comes out thick and creamy as other reviewers have stated... but I found it seriously lacking in flavor.  It absolutely needs some nutmeg, cinnamon, cardomom, or all 3 to have any flavor at all.  Otherwise, it's just rice cooked in milk with egg, sugar, salt, vanilla and butter....nothing special there.

Very good, but if there is some left and refrigerate it then it can get a little bland so nutmeg can make it taste a bit better.

First time I have ever made home made rice pudding.  I used leftover jasmine rice from dinner and had enough to make 8 servings. I followed the recipe with the exception of the rasins, and it turned out perfect.  I highly reccomend this recipe.

Very Easy and Very Simple.... it tasted amazing... I enjoyed it...  I used long grain rice and didn't seem to have any major problems probably a little coarser than it should be... I also used normal raisins because I didn't have any golden... mine turned out wonderful... I added a little extra milk because my rice made more than 1 1/2 cup.... but this turned out great will make again if i need a quick dessert...

I love this recipe. This is the second time making it and it was so yummy. This time, however, I ran out of eggs so I substitute 1TB of corn starch and dissolved it into the 1/2 cup of milk. I didn't have short grain rice this time around so I used long grain. I think the starch kept its thickness. The biggest mistake I made was not cooking the rice long enough. So, make sure you fully cook the rice before adding the milk!

This recipe was great!  I stumbled up on, it was the first I saw and didn't bother to check the others.  I was delicious and SO easy!  I took some to my grandparents and they loved it too :)  I did not have vanilla so I substituted a little bit of "Coffee Mate- Italian Sweet Cream" coffee creamer.  Very very yummy.  Best fresh, doesn't reheat well.

Wow! This is a wonderful recipe! One helpful hint is to make sure to temper the egg/milk mixture by adding some of the hot rice into it. Otherwise, the egg will curdle in the pudding. I followed this recipe to a T and the taste was perfect!

Just made this for my 11 yr old, and it is delicious! Used the medium grain rice as others have mentioned, and added a tiny bit more sugar but it is fantastic! Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe brings rice pudding to a whole new level. Definately no where near the the gloppy stuff from the grocery store. I used 1/2 and 1/2, since I had some left over from another recipe and it was so good and rich! However, I have also made it with 2% milk and it was still a winner.

This was the best rice pudding I think I've ever had. It was SO creamy and tasty. I too only used one pot and followed the directions exactly. I also used long grain rice as it was all I had it it still turned out incredible. I have found my perfect rice pudding! It's definitely a keeper.

I used brown rice, it was all I had. I blended it in the food processor after cooking it (before adding milk). Its whole grain, and tastes like ambrosia! Thank-you for sharing with us!

Super tasty, i made it and then refrigerated it which was a bad idea. It became a solid mass. I tasted it before i put it in though and it was delicious. I nuked it a couple minutes and gradually added some milk to it to save it. It worked, but probably not as good as if would have been if i ate it right away.

I am a professional cook so I used this recipe in my kitchen at work.  It was very good, but does not double well.  I had to use some corn starch to thicken it up a bit.  Also I wanted to use leftover rice and it was long grain which doesn't do well in rice pudding so I put the rice in a food processor and processed it a bit which broke it up some and it was fine.  All in all a pretty good pudding.

This is the first time I have ever made Rice Pudding and my husband loves it. This is an A+ in my book. This is my go to recipe for now on. It is simple and takes really no time at all. One tip just watch your rice so it doesn't burn. Thanks for a great recipe..

I have NEVER been out of vanilla.. that is until it was time for me to add it.  I panicked!  Long story short, I sprinkled on cinnamon and nutmeg and it was delicious.  I LOVE this recipe.  Thanks.

O.K...I completely botched the directions & it still turned out excellent!!  I should not be cooking late at night!!  I cooked my rice, as directed, but added my egg to the sugar & first 1 1/2 cups of milk!  I figured, oh well....dumped the milk/egg mixture into the cooked pot of rice....GENTLY simmered & stirred for about 10-15 minutes...added last 1/2 cup milk & vanilla & VOILA!  Turned out just fine.  Great flavors, good consistency, not too sweet, egg didn't "scramble".  Will definitely make again, but next time I will follow the directions a bit more carefully.

Rating 5 for taste.  I used rice that was left over from dinner and was in the refrigerator.  Don't know why but it didn't get thick when I added the liquid.  Added some flour to thicken and it was just fine.  Yummy with raisins too.

Delicious! I added cinnamon of course!  I used short grain sticky rice (the same one I use for sushi) and doubled the recipe (which I think led me to be able to omit adding the milk the second time). It was delicious warm last night, and amazing cold this morning for breakfast! Nom Nom Nom!

I have never made rice pudding, and the only time I can remember having it was in a restaurant.  This was so easy, and it is delicious.  Instead of raisins, I used a dried berry mixture, and I love it.  The chewy tartness of the fruit with the creamy sweet pudding is lovely.  Sprinkled with cinnamon, and it is wonderful!

I had extra rice left over from the gumbo i was making...and needed to know what to do with it!  I used about a cup and a half of cooked rice, cut down a little milk....and then pretty much followed the recipe down, it worked splendidly!

I have been a long time lurker and had to register, just so I could post/review this recipe.  This rice pudding is outstanding!  Absolutely the best I've ever tasted and so creamy!  I followed the original recipe as is, and am now enjoying one of my favorite comfort foods.  This is definitely a keeper and going into my recipe book of favorites.  The only hint I might add was that I cooked on a gas stove and it seemed like the cooking times were shorter on my end. A fabulous recipe!  Thanks for sharing it with us.

I gave this recipe four stars ONLY because I have never made/eaten rice pudding before so I don't know what I am comparing it to.  I will say that the flavor is rich beyond what I thought it would be and I am afraid that even though I doubled the batch I am concerned that there won't be enough.  It is so good I will probably be getting up in the middle of the night to eat it in secret.  I used one whole vanilla bean and the taste is WOW!

This is an excellent recipe.  I served it today and was very pleased.  I'm grateful to the bloggers who mentioned the timing of the sugar and the tempering of the egg.  I only had long-grain rice and will purchase short-grain rice for the next time I make Creamy Rice Pudding.  This recipe is a Keeper.

I made this with Brown rice and it turned out a bit starchy. I suppose that's because I didn't rinse off the rice?

Just finished making this perfect rice pudding - I made just as indicated-using skim milk and Splenda-PERFECT even with long grain white rice.  I have been trying to make this dish for years-finally got it with your recipe and other contributors hints.  I thank you very much-

Turned out fantastic! Due to an egg allergy, I omitted the egg and added 2 t. cornstarch, it turned out creamy and delicious.  I used tasty jasmine rice and topped my serving with a shake of cinnamon and allspice, but it's good plain too. My left-over rice won't go to waste anymore!

This was the first time I'd ever eaten/made rice pudding but it will NOT be the last! My family was almost disgusted by how much of this I ate- I could NOT STOP!!!   I used short grain rice which made it extra thick= yummier! The butter was left out, a touch of whipping cream was added to finish off the pint before it went bad  and I added extra vanilla and a bit less sugar per the other ratings. I'm extremely opposed to soggy raisins, so I added them afterwards. The cinnamon, however, is absolutely necessary! Soooo gooooooood!! AND!!! I thought the cold leftovers were (prepare yourself) EVEN BETTER!!!  Thank you Erica!!!

Fantastic results, tastes incredible. As a dairy-free alternative (my wife is allergic to dairy), I used vanilla-flavoured almond milk. This required more cooking time with the milk to get a creamy consistency. More like 25-30 minutes rather than 15-20. I also used Earth Balance dairy-free margarine instead of butter. And since my wife isn't a big fan of raisins, I used chopped dates (same amount). This is now one of my favourite desserts.

This pudding is amazing! I am only sad that I didn't come across it sooner. Be sure to cook it as long as it says or else it will not be as creamy. I always add a little extra vanilla because I like the extra flavour :) Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was great, but with a little bit of cinnamon, it was even greater.  I also put the raisin in the first part of step 2 to make them softer.  I could eat this stuff all day and all night.  It reminds me of my mum's rice pudding.

this is a great recipe, but if i were you id use 2 egg yolks instead of a whole egg,  using the egg white gives too much of an egg flavor, but using the yolk will give you a much more creamy finish, also as milk can burn very easily you could use a simple bain marie (pot of boiling water) when cooking with the milk,  tasts great tho :)

This was fantastic! I can't believe I actually made a great rice pudding.  The rice cooked perfectly with the instructions given, it lived up to its claim of a delicious, creamy rice pudding.  I did without the egg and butter to cut on cholesterol and the raisins I didn't have and I added 1 tsp. cornstarch to make it a bit thick like I like it.  But I did decorate with cinnamon.  I dipped a wet rim of a glass onto some cinnamon then placed it on the pudding.  Would have given it a "6" if I could!  Oops, in all the excitement the pic is shown with nutmeg...i picked up the wrong bottle.

Delish! Started craving rice pudding a few days ago, found this recipe tonight, never made rice pudding before, looked easy enough and I had all the ingredients!  Used rice cooker to cook the rice, mixed cinnamon in when adding sugar and added butter immediately after egg mixture while burner was still on.  My husband who scoffed at me making rice pudding even said it was very good.

A great recipe! I have eaten rice pudding all of my life! However, I've always purchased it made. My first attempt using this recipe was a success. I do suggest leaving out the egg and lowering the salt content! I made this using non-fat milk, margarine (instead of regular butter) , and a sugar substitute -this makes a great guilt-free, fat free, sugar free dessert! For some additional NATURAL flavoring, I added a few lemon peels and sprinkled some cinnamon on top before serving. DELICIOUS!

Great recipe.  I made it twice in two days.  The first time I quadrupled the recipe for a teacher's dinner.  I had half/half on hand and used that for 1/4 of the required amt. of milk and liked it slightly better than when I made the second time with just the skim milk.  Guess a little fat adds to the creaminess, would make that way again.

Excellent and easy to make! First time making rice pudding and will be making a lot more of it! Made mine with Jasmine rice and vanilla Silk soy milk.  Followed all other ingredients and measurements exactly.  Great recipe!

Okay...I have had a life long hatred of rice pudding, but my husband loves it.  I made this for him and tasted it to check the consistency...now, I'M A BELIEVER!  This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I have also never been compelled to leave a review until now.  This is awesome.

mmmmmmmmmmmmm.  I just made this.  I am eating it as I write this review.  It is, in a word, great.  A really easy recipe.  I was terrified that my milk would burn, but it turned out in the end!  I added 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/3, and I found this to be plenty sweet enough.  To simplify, I mixed the egg, milk, and raisins in a bowl and added it as a mixture.  I melted the margarine in the microwave.  I used "sticky rice" which was a medium grain.  It didn't quite make 1 and 1/2 cups of cooked rice, but it came out great nonetheless!  Thanks for a wicked recipe!

I never knew rice pudding could be sooo delicious! I used Splenda rather than sugar, added a little ground nutmeg and cinnamon and it is to die for :]

This is the first time I've ever made rice pudding and even using the long grain it was delicious.  I did add a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg though becuase I thought it needed a more desserty flavor lol. Even my daughter loved this! A great inexpensive dessert. Will make again!

True to its name, this pudding was very creamy and tasty! Easy to prepare and just to add a dash more cream, I added a scoop of vanilla ice cream to it after  cooking it.  (something I learned from a restaurant)  It was delicious!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

My 7-year-old loved this and would eat it for breakfast, lunch, dinner AND dessert! And I would be happy to serve it to her nearly as often as we have a real problem getting enough dairy/calcium in to her!  We served with a sprinkle of cinnamon and it was delicious hot and cold!  Josie says "Yum! 5 stars!"

Very good flavor and texture.  Tastes very much like a recipe that I have used from my grandmothers recipe book.  Usually I don't add egg or butter but this time I added it like the recipe suggested and it's absolutely decadent.  I did omit the raisins but that's only because I don't like them.  Overall wonderful rice pudding.  Will definitely make again.

This comes out perfect every time.  I always wait to add the sugar until just before I also add the eggs/milk.  A good variation is coconut milk and almond extract.  My favorite way to use up leftover rice.

Best rice pudding I've ever had. Use good quality ingredients... organic white rice, imported French butter and British caster sugar for fabulous results.

Yum! I am pregnant and was craving this..so I followed your recipe (minus the raisins). So good! Saved my husband a trip to the store. After trying this rice pudding, I have decided NEVER to buy store bought again!! This will be my go-to recipe from now on! Thanks so much for sharing!!

I first have to say that I have never tasted or made rice pudding.  So this was my first!  This recipe sure lived up to its great reviews!  I only had the 10 minute rice on hand, and it didnt say if it was short, med, etc.  I could tell after cooking that more than likely it was the long.  Even with the long it was still great tho.  But for sure next time I will make sure to pick up some short rice at the store because I could tell it would be so much creamier with the short.  I read thru others reviews and came upon that I would change it around a bit.  I added the salt in with the water.  Then when it came to the milk mixture, I added the sugar, along with cinnamon and nutmeg to cook into the rice instead of adding at the end.  I didnt do the raisins and I added a touch more sugar near the end of cooking.  Probably an overall total of a 1/2 cup went in since we like things sweet.  I also tempered the beaten egg before adding so I didnt end up with scrambled eggs.  I served warm with sliced peaches over top and more cinnamon and sugar sprinkled.  We ate this as dessert and soon found out how rich and filling it was!  I thought this would be perfect as a breakfast meal with sliced fresh fruit over top.  So I cant wait to make again and again!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

great recipe as is, earns five stars but we have a few things we do that we would like to pass on. Leave out the raisens, it is great plain. If you want it sweet just up the sugar to 1/2 cup. If you like, it is great with diced peached or diced banana.

I absolutely love rice pudding, but have never found a recipe that suited my taste. That is, until today. This recipe is absolutely perfect in every way...it is deliciously creamy and thick, with just the right sweetness. It is definitely not easy or quick to make, but the results are so worth it. The only changes I made were to omit the raisins (personal preference) and to add some ground cinnamon to the finished pudding. It's absolutely wonderful served warm or cold. One error I found in the recipe is in the cooking time...I found that the rice/milk/sugar/salt mixture had to cook for at least five minutes longer in order for it to become remotely "thick and creamy". Other than that, it's wonderful! My family all loved it. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe...I'll be making this one again.

Rich and creamy! Thank you for this recipe.     Here's how I modified the recipe for my family: (1) I doubled the recipe; (2) I used 1/2 a vanilla bean, slit it open to let the seeds out and boiled it with the rice - I took the bean out right before I put into serving bowls; (3) I skipped the raisins; (4) I used unrefined sugar and 1% milk; (5) I used short grain, sticky rice; (6) I added a dash of cinnamon while cooking the rice with milk;(7)I put in the zest of 1 lemon at the very end, right after I added the egg & last bit of milk - I let that cook while stirring for roughly 2 minutes; (8) I skipped the butter; and (9) added a dash of cinnamon to flavour and decorate each serving bowl (did not stir in).     Thanks again!

I'm only 14, so I'm a pretty inexperienced cook, and today I was craving a pudding of some sort and wanted to cook something, so I found this recipe and tried it!  It's the first time I've successfully cooked something delicious and without burning down the house on the first try. :)  Thank you Erica, this is a great recipe!  Very simple and yummy. :)

This was great!! I doubled the vanilla as I really like vanilla. Every other recipe called for nutmeg and cinnamon. Great if you like those, but I prefer a creamy vanilla flavor. I threw my rice in the rice cooker as I can never seem to get it right the other way. Worked just wonderfully. I am thinking of adding some coconut and seeing how that works next time. Thanks for the great recipe.

Not so great...I just knew that this was going to be awesome after reading some of the reviews so I doubled the recipe. Mistake! It did not thicken up and even though I tempered my eggs they still cooked in the hot milk mixture. Mabe it did not get thick because I used low-fat milk. Even if it did thicken up, I don't think I would have liked it because of the super-mild taste and just weirdness all around. I'll just keep buying my rice pudding.

Used leftover jasmine rice from dinner to pull this together sans raisins (ick).  Delicious and simple ingredients. Will be making this again if I am ever in the mood for rice pudding.

The taste was great!  Unfortunately, mine never thickened up as much as I would have liked.  Also, I think if I had tempered the egg mixture (mix a small amount of the hot liquid into the egg mxture before mixing all the egg back into the hot mixture) then I would have avoided the little white flecks in it (I think they were essentially  little bits of "scrambled" egg).

This was pretty yummy.  I altered it slightly. First off, I fully cooked the rice, skipping step one. Second off, I made sure to temper the eggs into the hot mixture. Third off, to help with the tempering, I added 1/4 shot of rum.

Oh boy, this is good!  I had 1 1/2 cups cooked long grain minute rice I had left over from a recipe, so I thought I'd play with this recipe.  I skipped the first step, as my rice was done and went to the second step.  I added the hot rice/milk sugar mixture to the beaten egg to prevent scrambling anything and it turned out wonderful.  Can't wait to do this the right way with med. grain rice, because I bet it will be even better.  Thanks!

This is a pretty good recipe. Super easy and fast. I used currents instead of golden raisins, because I don't like the texture of the larger raisins. I found the currents to be a nice alternative. I would definitely recommend going with a short grain rice though. I used basmati rice, because it was what was in the house. It's good, but could use improvement. I think the shorter grain would go a long way to making it delicious.

I made this for a party, so I made this x6.  It was a HUGE hit.  People that "hated" rice pudding loved this.  Everyone ate it.  There was nothing left.  Thank you for a great recipe.  I will never buy boxed rice pudding again.

This was really good. I used brown rice and it tastes great! Would def make again. I didn't change the recipe at all except for using brown instead of white rice.

Perfect every time and I use Aborio rice, same as for Risotto. Always creamy and gone in no time even when I double it. It's been a staple recipe since I found it here a couple of years ago, thank you Erica and Ericas Mum.

Thank You, Erica! I made this recipe and timed everything to the minute. I also added the nutmeg and cinnamon. My husband loved it VERY MUCH! He called me at worked just to tell me to make more when I got the chance. I had to use the dark raisins in place of golden (only ones we had, but it turned out to be excellent). MY husband is a picky eater. 5 stars in our book!

This was super good! Works fine with leftover rice (I used Basmati). Just do everything else the same. I only had 1 1/4 cup cooked rice so just decreased everything a tad. Omitting the raisins is fine, too (I just don't like em). I recommend having cinnamon on the table so folks can spice it or not as they choose. Yummy!!! And so nice not to throw out the rice. This was easy to cook (for the 15-20) while eating dinner, was expecting it might burn but it didn't, then right after dinner I did the 2 minutes then butter and vanilla and Presto! Dessert! Love this recipe.

Tastes like cake mix in the absence of other  seasonings! I'll add some cinnamon or something next time. Also, after adding the remaining milk and the egg it got kind of grainy, like a very fine curdle. The egg perhaps? A momentary lapse in "stirring constantly?" Doesn't affect the flavor but I don't like the look of it.  Also, be sure to use high quality vanilla!!

Incredibly easy, especially using a rice cooker to prepare the rice!  I added nutella instead of the raisins/vanilla/cinnamon and it was scrumptious!

I have just finished making my first ever batch of rice pudding.  Other than using skim milk, I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great!  No more store bought rice pudding from now on.    Thanks for giving us such a great recipe.

I followed the directions exactly-- at fisrt I was owrried about the milk content-- but it turned out famously. It has such a home-y taste, and lends itself to any complimenting flavor. And, true to the name, creamy as heaven.

I usually make baked rice pudding, but this was faster, easier, and yummier!  I used 1 1/4 cups of milk and 1/2 cup cream in all, and it only needed about 10 minutes to cook before I put in the egg etc.  I also used coconut oil instead of butter.  My kids gobbled it up... our new family favorite.  :)

Followed the recipe using medium grain rice that I had cooked in the rice cooker; then added the liquids to the rice cooked and finished making it there...  At one point it bubbled over.  Will make again but will pay closer attention.  Creaminess achieved!  (The arb. rice in canister with twist on lid was horribly expensive, then I saw a bag of 'cheap' medium grain rice for 1/4th the cost...worked great!)

This was my first time making rice pudding and this recipe is definitely very easy. The only alteration I made was to use dried cranberries instead of the raisins, which gave it an interesting twist but I'll probably stick with raisins next time. After trying this recipe I've realized that I like rice pudding that's "doctored up" with cinnamon and maybe a little nutmeg, so it seemed to be a bit lacking in my opinion. Otherwise it was really quite good.

I use this everytime we have Left over Rice! As the recipe says - Cook rice first, so leftover is best! I have used White and Whole Wheat Rice. Both are winners in our house. We never use Raisins. Enjoy!

Outstanding! I made this using leftover long grain white rice and skim milk, followed the directions exactly, only skipping the butter at the end as my rice was already cooked with butter. A little sprinkle of cinnamon at serving time and it was the best pudding I've ever tasted! Thank you for an outstanding recipe! UPDATE: I have now made this with brown rice, jasmine rice, all sorts of leftover rice and it is perfect every time. It does, indeed, thicken some as it cools after the eggs are added. I always double this. Thank you!

Very quick and easy stovetop recipe.  Great for leftover rice.  I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup, use skim milk and have added cinnamon and nutmeg on some occasions, but it is only about preference.  This recipe is superb on its own.  One last thing, like other reviewers, I beat the egg with the last 1/2 cup milk and add a spoon of rice mixture to milk before SLOWLY adding it to the pudding.

I save some recipes that sound good and I save recipes that are proven to me to be 5 star.  I had left over brown rice from making stuffed bell peppers.I used that rice and tried your recipe. It was without any doubt a 5 star in both simplicity and flavor.

This is the best. Instead of milk or cream I used evaporated skim milk. It turned out really creamy. I also tempered the milk, egg and vanilla mixture with a bit of the hot milk from the rice mixture, it mixed and thickened perfectly. I didn't add any butter and didn't seem to miss it.

Wonderful recipe. I used 1 cup of rice and added about 2 tablespoons of butter when boiling the water. I used about 1/2 cup more milk. The only tricky part was adding the egg. I tried to get some of the warm mixture and mix that with the egg first, then combined. I ended up with a couple little pieces of egg, that i just picked out. I added about a teaspoon or 2 of vanilla and cinnamon and also used some brown sugar.  I also used long grain rice because I couldn't find medium. It is fantastic and will defiantly make it again

Excellent!  We didn't add raisins and had it with blackberries on top, and my kids gobbled it down.  Next time I will add a little more milk (up to a cup more), because when this cools down, it is VERY thick.

Delicious and simple to make. This is a great use for leftover rice. I'll definitely be making this again!

Simple to make.  Did not even need to drain the rice. But, it was to "SWEET" in my opinnion.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing I did not add was the raisins as I did not have any.  I liked the flavor better of another rice pudding recipe on this site, but it turns out too runny.  Thought I would try this one.  It is kind of thick but just mainly way to sweet for my taste.

I made this last night and it was delicious. Definately better than Kozy Shack!! Even if you arent a raisin fan like me, you should add them... it gives it the perfect sweetness. I also added a little bit of cinnamon to it!

Great, a nice rich, creamy rice pudding! I don't like golden raisins, so I used regular raisins. I also used short grain brown rice & added cinnanmon, nutmeg & ginger. Next, I am going to try it with stevia!

this is, by far, the best rice pudding i've ever made. as a matter of fact, one of the very best i have EVER had!!! i usually multiply the given recipe by 6-8 and it is almost always gone the next day...  :) (the only  thing that i did change about the recipe is the raisins; i use a bit less and i mix golden with regular)

My boyfriend's favorite. Don't forget to temper the egg with some of the hot rice mixture. I usually add about a half tsp. of cinnamon and a generous tablespoon of orange flower water. I like to top it when cooled with grated dark chocolate.

I have to be honest and say this was my first time ever cooking rice pudding. I was terrified because I had to make it in a very large amount (50 servings to be exact!). I had my first taste of it and it was SO GOOD!! Every one loved it! I made sure to let them know where to get it too! May God bless your hands! It was very delicious! Thank you!!

After reading the reviews, I decided to try this recipe as I was looking for a creamy rice pudding, rather than an egg custard with rice added.   I did substitute part of the milk for half and half and added extra egg yolks.  It was really delicious but set up a little too hard due to the extra yolks.   Next time I would cut back, but keep the half and half for the richness.  I will definitely make it again, but not to often, 'cause it's dangerous!  I want to eat the whole bowlful.

Great classic recipe.  I subbed evaporated milk, measured nothing, and screwed up on the order of things to cook and it still came out really good.  Everyone in the family loved it and it was a good way to use up leftover rice.

Thanks for posting this recipe! I'd never eaten rice pudding before, but during a recent snowstorm I was looking for some warm & creamy comfort food. This is wonderful--so yummy & so easy!! I made it again tonight!

My son has dairy issues so we used substituted hemp milk and coconut oil (for butter) and maple syrup. The coconut oil added a nice twist. We ate it for breakfast covered with apple sauce and sliced bananas. If the apple sauce weren't going to be a topping, I would add some cinnamon. The Boy has requested dried cranberries instead of raisins next time. Trés yum.

Delicious!  I used an entire can of evaporated milk for the first part of the milk.  It makes it taste rich without tasting like evaporated milk.  I vigorously whisked 1 cup of milk plus the egg for the second part of the milk.  By doing that, I had no "scrambled egg" issues.  I will will be making this again!

My kids are rice pudding connoisseurs and this was a hit!  Super easy!  After making the rice, I added the other ingredients and it turned out perfect.  I used half 2% and half 10% cream.   Definite keeper!  Thanks.

As is this recipe is very good.  But to make it great, I used Fat Free Half and Half instead of milk and added some cinnamon and nutmeg with the milk and sugar.  Also, I added my beaten egg at the same time as my milk and sugar for a more custardy flavor.  Superb, can't stay out of it at all!

I've never reviewed a recipe on here, but I had to leave some feedback on this one. At 6 months pregnant, I had my first official pregancy craving for rice pudding last night. I found this recipe and was ecstatic to see that I had all the ingredients already. Made this exactly as written (with Arborio rice and skim milk), and it is delicious! My husband thanks you (as do I), Erica, for satisfying this pregnant woman (and saving him a late-night trip to the store)!!!

I hadn't ever tried making rice pudding before today, and this recipe was super easy to follow. I used leftover rice from a stir fry disaster last night, so it took less than 20 minutes to pull this together. Great way to use extra rice, and it was delicious! I did leave out the raisins.

Easy and Wonderful!  I used leftover chinese take-out rice.  I didn't have any raisins, so I didn't use them and it still turned out great.  It was enjoyed by all.  Thanks!

This is a really good recipe for rice pudding. I used medium grain rice because it gives a creamier end result. I also used the same pot that I cooked the rice in instead of dirtying another pot. I will definitely make again.

Love this rescipe my teenagers and hubby all think it's the best?  Never use brown rice.  This is a comfort food 
If you are going to experiment with the rescipe or change it it will not co e out as good.  The only thing I adjusted is I added maple concentrate with vanilla extract.

Just be sure that it is extremely thick before adding the last of the milk and egg, otherwise it will stay runny.  Delicious with or without the raisins.  I thought dark raisins worked better because it was alittle too sweet w/ the golden raisins.

What a great recipe!  I used 2 c leftover Cinnamon Rice with Apples (also on this site), 2 c evaporated skim milk, 3 T sugar, 1 egg, and 0.5 t vanilla.  Went easy on the sugar since the starting rice was already somewhat sweet.  Could not have been easier, and the result is delicious.

This recipe is super easy and tastes just like the rice pudding at our favourite restaurant! I had leftover long grain and wild rice from dinner that I used and although the black grains were funny they tasted just as good. I'm going to make a double batch tonight because my husband loved it!

Warning: VERY VERY SWEET!  Nice consistency and easy to make but so sweet I couldn't eat it.  Because of the ease of the recipe I might try again with much less sugar...maybe 1/2 of what the recipe calls for.

YUMMY!  I love rice pudding but have never made it before from scratch.  I made it with 6 cups rice and adjusted other ingredients to match.  I used 2% milk and omitted raisins because I do not like them.  I used Splenda instead of sugar since I am diabetic and left out butter to save on fat and calories.  I will NEVER buy rice pudding again!  I had long grain instant rice on hand and it is still creamy and delicious!

With a couple of modifications, this tasted great.  I only used 1/8 cup sugar and next time I'll make it even less - the raisins really sweeten it!  I'll also add more milk and let it become much creamier since it was a pretty thick pudding, but very yummy anyway.  Thanks - this was a quick, easy and healthy dessert to fix up while preparing lunch!

Very good and easy to make, creamy and just the right sweetness. I did use long grain rice and had no problem with taste or texture. I also ran out of white sugar so I used half brown sugar. I added cinnamon and nutmeg also. Very close to my grandmothers recipe.

Very good flavor.  Extremely easy to make.  Just make sure to stir the mixture a lot when it's cooking. It will quickly stick to the bottom of the pan!  I added cinnamon to it, as a personal preference.  My husband and picky, 1 year old loved it!

Coming from a girl that has ruined rice on numerous occasions.... this recipe is virtually impossible to screw up. Follow the directions to a tee and you'll be fine. To repeat another users words of wisdom...once the sugar is added the rice stops cooking. So check that the rice is the right texture first.  Many thanks to Erica G for a great recipe. :o)

I used cooked rice I'd frozen from an overly ambitious stuffed pepper project this summer and this proved to be easy and delicious.  I substituted pineapple tidbits for raisins but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for sharing.  We loved it.

Delightful! As always, I read the reviews before making this. I already had everything but I did have to make some substitutions. I used jasmine rice since I didn't have short or medium grain. I used truvia (all natural no calorie sweetener) instead of sugar, so 1/6 of a cup of truvia and skim milk. It was SO creamy and tasted great, even with the lower calorie substitutions! Even my chef husband loved it! As someone suggested, we did temper the eggs and milk before adding it to the hot milky rice to prevent scrambled eggs in our pudding. We then calculated the calories and portioned it out into 8 small bowls for 100 calorie snacks! Satisfies that sweet craving without wrecking a day of hard work! LOVE this!

Made this with regular brown raisins, Uncle Bens rice, added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, doubled the cinnamon, and sub'd the sugar with splenda. GREAT creamy recipe, that my 5 yr old son BEGGED me to make again the next day! I also doubled up on the vanilla just because I enjoy the vanilla flavor that much.

This recipe reminded me of my grandmother's rice pudding I used to eat as a child.  I left out the raisins, because 1) I didn't have any, and 2) I prefer no raisins.  I also let the rice/milk/sugar mixture simmer, which thickened it right up.  For those who said their pudding did not thicken, try simmering it, but watch closely or your milk will burn.  Also, be sure to use whole or 2% milk.  This recipe will be added to my collection and I'll continue to make it for years to come!

This recipe tastes like what my mother made! I've tried several recipes looking for that taste. This is awesome as written. I've also made it with an additional 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tbsp cocoa powder at the very end. Yummy.

Excellent recipe! Only changes I made were: Instead of just milk, I mixed 1 cup skim milk with 1 cup heavy cream and divided as necessary. Omitted the raisins (don't like them). Also, instead of using a separate saucepan after cooking the rice, I just did it all in the same one as this keeps all the starch in the mix! (makes it a tad creamier) :) Thanks for sharing!

I used Arborio rice and skim milk this time. The last time I used long grain rice and it didn't come out creamy enough. But this time around, it is super creamy. Smells and tastes delicious.

I love this recipe.  It is very easy to make and turns out perfect every time.  The only change I made was to add a tablespoon of honey.  I think it needed a little more sweetness.  Next time I am going to try it with short grain rice.

Really wanted to give this 3 1/2 stars.  Didn't care for cooking the rice first then adding to the milk mixture and thought the pudding was heavy.  The taste was okay but not the taste or texture I'm looking for in a rice pudding.  Recipe was very easy though...wish it worked better for me and my RP (rice pudding) team!

Delicious! My husband told me it was better than the one his mom use to make, which is saying a lot! I cooked the rice a little longer than 20 min to make sure it was really fluffy. I used non-fat milk and it was creamy.

Yummy! Just like my mom use to make it. I had leftover rice from dinner so I just started from there. I also added more sugar and used regular rasins. Lastly I topped my serving off with a little  cinnamon. After I ate it all up I realized that I forgot the butter, but I couldn't tell and my hips probably won't miss it either. :-)

We had too much brown rice leftover after dinner.  I have never had rice pudding before and am not a huge fan of like desserts, but this was fabulous.  Incredibly delicious.  Definitely something I will crave the next time I am pregnant.

The taste of the rice pudding was very good, however it was much a much thicker rice pudding than I'm used too, very heavy.  It's going be delicious to enjoy on a cold winter afternoon.

I was hesitant to try this recipe after reading the reviews because I only had extra long grain rice.  I'm glad I made it anyway, because it came out great!  I did add the sugar after cooking the rice and milk, and tempered the egg with some of the rice mixture before adding to the pudding.  Once it was fully cooked, I stirred in some vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Delicious!  I'm sure I'll be making this whenever we have some leftover rice.

WOW, this was so good and easy. I left out the raisins because I actually don't like raisins in my rice pudding. I also used a short grain arborio rice. Even my husband ate it and he "isn't a fan of rice pudding".

We loved this rice pudding!!!  Next time I will make a few changes though.  I will use about 1/2 as many raisins as it calls for and I will also temper the eggs before adding them as I had a few small chunks of cooked eggs in the pudding.  Definately a keeper!!!!

I wanted to try a rice pudding recipe for my hubby since he loves it. Once a year I make 'arroz con dulce' and it's delicious, but it takes long and requires a lot more ingredients. This recipe was very easy and tasty. My husband liked it very much! I used all the ingredients stated. Only thing I did different was I sprinkled some ground cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and a little vanilla extract when I put in the rest of the milk. Once done I also added brown sugar for a little more sweetness and for the color. Next time I'll try making it with evaporated milk...Definitely a keeper. Thanks Erica G! :)

Great recipe!  Very adaptable too... Somebody suggested using the leftovers ('sludge') from Lola's Horchata (on this site) so here is what I did: left sludge with 1/2 c. milk in fridge until I was ready to use.  Added another cup of milk and cooked it in a saucepan until rice is tender.  (Make sure it is actually tender! Water could also probably be used for this step.) Added another cup of milk and stirred until warm.  whipped together another 1/2 c. milk (yes, 3 total cups) and 1/2 c. sugar, and the egg, and added it to milk.  Cook until thick.  Add vanilla.  (I left out raisins and butter.)  It was good, just be sure to cook the rice enough!

This is the best Rice Pudding recipe I have ever had or made!  I omitted the raisins, substituted maple flavoring for the vanilla and added 1/4 tsp.   cinnamon! I served it cold with 6-8oz of whipped topping stired in!  It was so good!  My husband and very picky 5 year old loved it too!  I will definitly make this recipe again!  Thanks for sharing!

Can be made with cooked brown rice for a healthier treat. Start with pre-cooked rice and go to step 2. I also omitted the butter. Really excellent - I can't wait to see my daughter try the brown rice version for breakfast tomorrow.

Great simple recipe. I've tried many, some using condensed milk, uncooked rice, many more eggs which all unnecessarily complicated things. Try using Indian basmati rice sometime for a floral tatse.

Just wonderful! Be sure to stir constantly as it cooks, so as not to scorch. I will take some to my mother tonight, and I KNOW it will remind her of her childhood. Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this recipe several times..it's great as is.  I follow the recipe almost to the tee.. with the exception of: I add evaporated milk the last 2 minutes.  When its all done, I mix in 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tbsp of butter... I finish it off with sprinkled cinnamon on the top!!  Magnifique! (Not sure if that's how you spell it)  :) Great recipe!

I used long grain rice because its all I had and I also didnt cook it long enough before I added the sugar. So the rice is kind of hard but this rice pudding is still extremely edible! I am going to try the recipe again but wait till the rice is very soft before adding the sugar. SO GOOOD!

I used left-over, long-grain, white rice instead what it says in the recipe and my hubbie still said that no tv chef could have made a better. This recipe is awesome, not in the common, everyday usage, but really awesome. But do leave out the raisins.

Erica, this was a great recipe. Perfect texture, perfect sweetness. I have always thought that making a rice pudding would be difficult or time consuming but this was neither... Just delicious! Thanks for sharing this!

Great recipe!  I used rice milk in place of regular milk and had no problems with consistency or creaminess (but thats personal tastes).  Only had left over basmati rice which worked alright too.  I will make this again using short grain rice and a little less sugar as it was very sweet when warm. (the portion that was left in the fridge over night and that was not too sweet) so it depends on how you plan on serving it and what sweetness you prefer.  also cinnamon is a highly recommended addition.

My husband says it reminds him of visiting his grandmother's in columbia as a child. I suppose they eat this sort of thing over there.  It was very thick and creamy. I used long grain rice and 1 can of evaporated milk + 1/2 cup of skim milk and the texture turned out great.

I've always had the baked rice pudding so I was a little worried about trying a stove-top recipe, but it's really good! I'll be making this again!  I also added a little cinnamon for the last 2 minutes of cooking time.

Soooo good!!!  I used 1C Minute Rice (Cooked in 1C boiling water) & 1/3C + 1 Tbsp Sugar.  I also used the full 2C milk, as directed.  This was very tasty!!  After the pudding was cooked, I put it into 4 sundae cups, sprinkled with some cinnamon sugar.  They were awesome!! (For extra cinnamon/sweetness, fill each cup 1/2 way with pudding, sprinkle some cinnamon sugar, then fill the other 1/2 with pudding, and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar).  My entire family loved it!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Good. I've never made rice pudding before, and this was so easy. I didn't have medium grain rice, so I used long grain. It was good and creamy.

Yummy!  My rice, milk and sugar mixture thickened up in about 12 minutes, not the 15-20 prescribed.  I also added a generous dash of cinnamon and used craisins instead of raisins (I didn't have any raisins) and Splenda instead of sugar.  Absolutely superb.  Will make this over and over.

I always have left over rice when I make dinner and tried this recipe so I wouldn't waste the rice. I had all the ingredients so tried at Rice Pudding for the 3rd time. 1st time with this recipe. PHENOMINAL. My girlfriend loves her mothers Rice Pudding and I beat it! I BEAT MOM! I used Calrose rice from the rice cooker. Thank you for making me potentially legendary.

I am going to give this 5 based on all the reviews.  I need some help though.  I am eating rice pudding.  I am so excited to make it myself.  When shopping for rice.  I couldnt find anything but Long grain or Jasmin.  Can I use Jasmine rice?  Or where do I purchase the med or short?

This is the best rice pudding.  It's gone in a flash.  The only thing I do is add a small box of instant vanilla pudding when I add the eggs and 1/2 cup of milk.  This gives it a fantastic vanilla flavor.

This is fantastic!  I had to make the last cup of milk heavy cream (only had 1/2 c milk)and I added 3 dashes (maybe ~ 1/8 to 1/4 tsp) nutmeg.  This is the very best rice pudding I've ever had.  If I change anything else, I might cut down down on the sugar by a tablespoon or two- the golden raisins make would make up the sweet 'difference'.

I used whole grain brown rice for a more wholesome version of this pudding. I cooked the brown rice in the rice cooker with a little more water than I normally would (1 cup rice and 2 1/2 cups water) in order for the rice to be softer. I also used soymilk which added creaminess. I only used half the amount of sugar suggested and it was plenty sweet (soymilk adds sweetness as well). Added cinnamon, nutmeg and walnut pieces on top, just prior to serving. YUM!

Awesome Recipe!!!!  My husband who is a rice pudding fanatic couldn't stop raving.  Just the right ammount of sweetness.  I did double the ammoounts (we wanted alot of pudding and did get alot!!)  The only thing I will do differntly next time is add a bit more milk.  After if became cool, it was not very creamy, but it was great all the same.  I will definatly be making this from now on!! Thank You so much

Excellent! I omitted the butter, but followed the rest of the recipe as written. Long grain rice worked fine. I topped it off with a sprinkling of cinnamon.

This was wonderful.  My husband, who doesn't really like rice, scarfed this up!  I did make sure the rice was COMPLETELY cooked before drained and added to the milk mixture as stated by one of the reviewers.  I also doubled the vanilla because I apparently can't read!  :-)  I will double the vanilla again - YUMMY!

Pretty good.  I think too much liquid in recipe, but I also used jasmine rice which may have skewed the measurements.  Otherwise, good flavor

This is awesome!  I just realized I forgot to put the butter in, but it didn't matter... still so good. I used 1-1/2 cup cooked day old rice. The only changes I made were to put the raisins in the 1st cooking to make them soft and plump (used regular, brown raisins). Also added about 1" vanilla bean, split & scraped in, and put the pod in the mix for the entire cooking time and then fished out the pod at the end (and skipped the vanilla extract).  Also added a dash of cinnamon.  This was so good warm and I think it'll be even better tomorrow cold with sliced banana for breakfast! On that note, in the past when I've made rice pudding with other recipes and then tried to reheat it in the microwave later it became a nasty consistency, I think the egg cooks in there and makes it weird, so just eat leftovers cold!

This was a GREAT recipe!  I have found it hard to find a really good rice pudding recipe.  But let me tell you this is it!  Even better then moms! (please don't tell her I said that) :) really creamy! don't leave out the egg... and remember to let it cook for around 10 mins, by then it will be nice and thick and you won't have to add  corn starch.  Deffinately a 5 star recipe. Very simple and Tastey! This is a keeper!

This is only the second time I've ever had rice pudding, and the first time I've made it.  Delicious!  It tasted very rich to me.  I seasoned it with cinnamon and nutmeg.  I will make this again!

This recipe is really great and produces a really creamy and yummy rice pudding! The only thing is that the rice quantity was a little off and I ended up spending 2 1/2 hours making double the recipe (my hand shook from stirring so much!)! I did cut the sugar by half (unless you like it really sweet) and omitted the golden raisins (don't like them). And remember to temper your egg(s) before adding them. Other than that, yummy recipe! :)

i cooked 3/4 cup of rice and that yielded about 3 cups of rice! so i ended up doubling the rest of it. mine didn't thicken well(i left it longer than 20 minutes after putting the milk because i had twice as much) and my eggs cooked.  i suggest removing from heat after adding in the egg.   i did not think it was as wonderful as the reviews say.

Love it!!  So easy and delicious.  I made this with some leftover rice that I had.  I used skim milk and fat free half & half (1 cup milk 1/2 cup fat free half & half) to simmer rice in and in the last step just used 1/2 cup more skim milk.  I also used a sugar substitute (called Somersweet, it's in Suzanne Somers product line).  This is so wonderful and will make this again and again.  Thanks for a great and super simple recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I been wanting to make rice pudding for a long time and finally decided to bite the bullet and make one from scratch (that is; with uncooked rice and not leftover cooked rice) I have to admit, I was so tempted to leave out the egg as some other reviewers did (because I have had curdling issues with another recipe) but I didn't. The only change I made was use half the amount of raisins called for in the recipe (which turned out to be just right for my tastes) I actually took the half cup of milk which was to be added closer to the end, heated it up a bit and slowly whisked it into the egg to make a custard and then slowly poured the custard into the rice pudding bit by bit. This technique worked like a charm! This is really good sprinkled with cinnamon or nutmeg, but I think it would also be great all alone, yum! The sweetness perfect for my taste and I also got no eggy aftertaste. Thanks for sharing!

I just finished making this recipe.  I will be serving it as dessert with dinner.  I had to taste it to make sure it was good.  It is DELICIOUS!  This is the first time I have made rice pudding and I am so glad that I chose this recipe.  I added both nutmeg and cinnamon as others suggested.  It will be hard for me to stay out of it while I make dinner.  THANK YOU!

This is delicious!  I made a few changes :  I used Japanese rice grains....which is shorter and thicker when cooked.  This basically cut the cooking time by a lot, because Japanese rice tends to come out very thick, creamy, soft and moist when cooked.   I also added condensed milk with the milk, so I didn`t need to put sugar and it just made it creamier, with that perfect hint of sweetness.  I added nutmeg and cinnamon in the mix and it was perfect.  I like mine chilled, rather than hot or warm....!  It only took me 10 minutes to make.  ( mind you, I already had Japanese rice prepared, cooked in a rice cooker, bc I eat rice everyday ).

Wow...so easy. Amazing. I was totally skeptical, but it's great. Had leftover rice that worked fine. Heated it up first. Also, looked like 1.5 cups cooked of rice wasn't enough but after it got cooking it was fine. good thing i didn't add more like i wanted to. Fiance loved it too. That's his favorite dessert. Now I can make it any time rather than buy it. Long grain was all we had and it worked fine. So did skim milk. Thanks so much Erica!

easy and tasty. i did add extra splenda, it wasn't quite sweet enough. i also added cinnamon and nutmeg. i don't think you should eat rice pudding without them. the consistency was perfect.

I've made this twice.  I made it the first time exactly as written (well I did add some cinnamon and almond extract).  The second time I made rice for dinner using 2 cups of rice instead of one.  Whatever was leftover I used for the rice pudding.  There was more rice than the recipe calls for, but all it needed was a bit more sugar.  I used medium grain (Calrose) rice and that makes it so creamy and yummy!  If you add some of the hot rice mixture to the egg and milk before mixing it into the pot you won't get scrambled eggs in your rice pudding.

This pudding is very good. Similar in taste to my mother's that was baked. If served warm, as per the recipe, it is smooth and creamy. We prefer the pudding cold, however. It was a solid mass, so I added some milk to loosen it up. This worked well. My husband, for whom I made the pudding, said it was "not bad". For him that is high praise. Next time I will not cook it so long and I am sure it will be perfect.

This is absolutely delicious! I used skim milk and added just a little cinnamon and vanilla. Yum, I just finished making this pudding and I'm sitting here eating it right now, it's just so good. My son loves it too, he's three and a half. Thanks for a great recipe! Oh, I also added a tsp of Fibersure to my serving, for some extra nutrition. Couldn't taste the difference at all.

Its probably a great recipe as it is but like everyone else, I had to put my own twist on it and I love, love, loved it.  I doubled and used 2, 12 oz cans of skimmed evaporated milk and 1/2 cup of 2% milk.  In cooking this on my glass electric stove top, I remembered why I baked rice pudding because I was starting to scorch it which is really easy for me to do and especially with electricity.  So I put the doubled batch in the large glass mixing bowl that pampered chef makes and microwaved it for seven minutes(but that was after it was already warm-make take twice as long), put the eggs and 1/2 cup milk in and microed for 2 min more then finished it up. The mixture came up over the top of the bowl when microwaving but it didn't boil over.  If it looks like its going to go over, then take it out and stir it down.  I used sticky rice-a short grain with a really good flavor.  I don't think you can get it in regular stores but got mine in an Asian market by just asking for "sticky" rice.  It works really great with this recipe.  Used cinnamon and nutmeg to taste.  Used reg dark raisins but just one cup.  If you don't use raisins, you might want to put a little more sugar in because a lot of the sweetness comes from the raisins.  The vanilla is a must.  I'm going to try brown rice next time.

I made the mistake by using soy milk and brown rice... yeah stick to white rice and real milk. I didn't think it was bad, but my husband was disappointed. This isn't a recipe you can try and trim calories...I will try it again using exact ingredients next time.

This was amazing. I made it with long grain rice, fat free milk, and low fat margarine, and it was still very creamy and flavorful. My husband liked it cold, with out raisins, and i enjoyed it warm and even reheated the next day.

This was great! I used extra instant rice and was a little concerned it would be too mushy, but it was SO good. I didn't have raisins so I left those out. I made it for my baby girl when she was sick and she loved it.  I may cut the sugar back by just a bit next time, but otherwise delicious!!!

Yummy! I think the only thing I would change is take out the egg. I think it's fine without it. I also added the cinnamon early on, but I think next time I would add the cinnamon in at the last minute so it doesn't darken the rice, but I do like the cinnamon in it :) Good recipe!

outstanding recipe. i used medium-grain brown rice, which adds a whole new level of taste, and a boatload of cinnamon, because cinnamon makes everything better. :)

Excellent - creamy and delicious. Used a short grain rice (Arborrio, which is used for risotto and such) which makes all the difference. Do not use a long grain rice for this recipe because you want the texture to be creamy and a long grain rice will not give you this texture.  I also used lowfat milk and the pudding was still uber creamy.

We had some leftover rice from our chinese dinner.  Instead of throwing out, I used it to make this rice pudding.  It turned out great.  I opted not to add the last milk, and it was extremely creamy.  Yummy.

I had been looking for an easy rice pudding recipe for a long time.  This one caught my eye and it's not only easy, it's super delicious, too!  It doesn't stick around long in my house!

So delicious. Great recipe. I made this last night for my grandma and she raved about it. I used medium grain rice which worked perfect. So creamy and yummy. I love this website.

Excellent recipe. I used half & half instead of milk and cooked white rice from our Chinese take-out. It was a big hit with my family and very easy to make.

Good as is. I especially liked a second vamped up version with 1/4 tsp cardamom and 1 can light coconut milk + 1/2 cup cow milk. Topped with pistachios and toasted coconut. I used leftover brown rice. I'll make extra rice forever! :)
By the way, my egg curdles every time. It isn't a big deal since this isn't a smooth custard dessert, but still a bit unsightly. I tried stirring in a bit of the hot rice mixture into the egg/milk mix and always add slowly, stirring CONSTANTLY, but no good. Just a fair warning. Maybe allow the pudding to cool a bit before adding, then slowly heat back up after having incorporated the egg? It's worth a shot!

I used long grain, white, minute rice and doubled the recipe. Also added a little cinnamon and extra (regular, not golden)raisins. My mixture took a little more than the 20 minutes to really thicken up and it ended up being very creamy. Very good. My husband really liked this.

Well, I am sure the recipe is fine, but I am a yutz. I cannot make rice pudding, stove top, oven, maybe I can buy the right one in the store, but that is about it.  I tried twice and both times it was still not creamy enough. 
I measured ingredients exactly, changed nothing and it still looked like left over Chinese take out rice!! What am I doing wrong?

I was reading "The Pokey Little Puppy" to my little girls the other day and had a craving for rice pudding.  I had no idea it required so few ingredients or was so simple to make!  I always thought you had to add about a gallon of half and half and all I had in the house was 1 percent but it turned out super creamy.  Just the right amount of sweet.  The ultimate comfort food.  My girls wouldn't even try it...I don't know why since they eat rice often with their dinner.  Oh well, at least I got to eat the leftovers for breakfast the next morning.  They got pretty gluey in the fridge but a splash of milk and a minute in the microwave brought it back to the perfect consistency.

I wasn't blown away.  I'll keep searching for a better recipe.  It was certainly easy to prepare and hardly required any ingredients.  In all fairness my boyfriend used the word "perfect" while eating it, but I still think that it could be better.

Yummy. Added random stuff on hand like dates and shredded coconut to make it yummy. Specifically only added half the sugar and then drizzled molasses on top. Fabulous!

Yum!  I just made this, first sauteing the rice in the butter before adding the water as was recommended previously.  I also didn't add the sugar until the rice was tender and added some minced candied ginger and orange zest to the pudding with the sugar.  Make sure you temper the beaten egg and milk mixture!  Will definitely make this again!

This was really good! My husband loved it. Very creamy. I was a little hesitant to add the extra milk at the end- it seemed like it had enough milk already- but I put my faith in the reviews and stuck to the instructions. It firms up and thickens as it cools.

So creamy!  I've only had rice pudding made with instant rice and this blows it away.  Nutmeg is a must.  I can't wait to see if I adapt this for brown rice.  I used medium grain white rice and it ended up so creamy.  Oh also, after I added the milk it started to brown on the bottom of the pan and I was getting brown stuff in the rice, I was a little worried, but I just turned it down and it still tastes great.

This was good, the best rice pudding I've made so far. I just think rice pudding is a bit boring, no one in my family was dying for seconds. But I think it was a really good recipe, rice came out nice and soft and creamy.

I tried coconut milk instead of milk because I was out of regular milk (MAGICAL! It added such a creaminess!), and used sliced dried apricots instead of raisins because I needed to get rid of them. I also added a couple shakes of cinnamon and one shake of nutmeg. Delicious! Soo creamy and luxurious and it made my tummy feel all warm! I had trouble saving some for my boyfriend...

I write reviews so they'll be at my fingertips when I look at my "Recipe Box"; that way I won't let a great recipe slip away.  This one is a definitely a keeper good way to use leftover rice.  The only thing I did different was add a little cinnamon.

Generally, I am not someone to rate a recipe even if it is great. However, when I tasted this pudding it reminded me of home and I loved it! I added a splash more milk and omitted the raisens because I like to mix fresh fruit into it after it's refrigerated for a somewhat healthy comfy snack. I will definitely make this again and for me, that's saying a lot. Signed: A misplaced Mississippi gal in Hilton Head Island, SC.

My family loved it! For the last addition of milk, I added half and half cream instead. I also doubled the vanilla and used less raisins, since I'm not a big fan of cooked raisins. I don't have a real sweet tooth, so this was perfect for me.

Very Good Recipe, although made a few changes. Instead of cooking rice in a saucepan, I used my rice cooker to cook it and Voila, perfectly cooked rice. When adding the milk, sugar and rice I used 1 3/4 cup of milk instead. I took the advice of others and whisked the egg and milk together and adding a bit of the hot rice, then slowly added into the rest of the rice. I tasted a little bit, it was a little bland so I added about 1/3 cup more sugar and about 1/4tsp of cinnamon and cooked a bit longer. Tastes delicious now!

This rice pudding tasted great and was really easy to make!  My 3 year old even helped put the ingredients together.  We both loved it, especially sprinkled with cinnamon.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

I can't say I'm an expert, having never made rice pudding before...but sometimes my mom would (she liked it for breakfast?!)
Anyhow...made this in non-diary form using rice milk and butter substitute...turned out perfectly delicious!

This rice pudding is sooo yummy!  Hubby hates rice pudding.  Tried this and loved it!  I added a cinnamon stick while the milk, sugar and rice was cooking.  Then sprinkled cinnamon on top of each serving.

Absolutely love this recipe.  Although slightly time consumer ie. can't leave it while it cooks, it sure beats the old fashion bake in the pan kind with its creamy taste.  A favorite in my house.  Great for bribing my boys to do something extra.

This rice pudding is awesome!  I will not use any other recipe again!  I always add extra milk or cream at the end so the pudding will keep a creamy consistency and will not stiffen up too much after refrigerating.  You will definitely want to double this recipe because it will go quick! A++

Excellent, easy recipe. Turned out exactly how I imagined it would. I used 2% milk and don't miss any of the richness of the higher fat content milks/creams. Will make double batch next time.

This recipe is delicious and SO easy to make. I made a batch of rice yesterday and needed some way to use it up so I used cold, one day old rice in this recipe and it turned out awesome. I've tried many rice puddings before that never turn out. This recipe took about 15 minutes and tasted wonderful. I added both the cinnamon and nutmeg at the end and the flavor was really yummy.

This was excellent!! I had leftover sticky rice from take-out tonight and was really craving good rice pudding. I used skim milk and splenda, a little less butter and added a bit of cinammon, cloves, and cardamom. Sooo Good!

Delish- and affordable to make at home, especially when comparing to Kozy Shack prices! I use long- grain Basmati rice; I could see that a short-grain would be creamier though. I used just a little more than half the sugar this recipe called for, but I don't have much of a sweet tooth. Wonderful! Thanks for sharing!

I give this three stars because my husband liked it, but I did not.  It was too sweet and goopy-creamy and rich for me.  I believe I would like it to be more milky?

Tasty and simple recipe. First time I ever made rice pudding that actually turned out. I am not a good cook (I'm working on it) and get overwhelmed easily by recipes but this was perfect. Yummy and creamy. I mainly use brown rice. This pudding is super custardy (we like it that way) if you add another egg. Also like to occasionally add some rose water. The comment by Peggy about withholding sugar until rice is fully cooked was very helpful!

Peggy must be crazy because I just made this recipe and it was AWESOME! YUM! I added the sugar when I added everything else like the recipe called for and did not have any problems. Its great warm but I refrigerated the leftovers and it makes an awesome bedtime snack cold! I will defenitly be making this again since my husband already ate all of it!

All in all, not a bad recipe but we've had better. We like it so much more without the egg and with a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.

5 stars and more!!
This is the BEST "riisipuuro" recipe I've ever tasted...that's what Finnish people call Rice pudding. It's just like my Grandma's.
I used Calrose rice and left out the butter and raisins, and added nutmeg and cinnamon...heavenly! I ate it with milk and it was an instant hit with my picky 2-year-old. It's also great with "kiisseli" which is for example strawberry juice (with fruit added) boiled and thickened with corn starch...yummy! Thanks a million for posting this recipe.

I have been trying for years to replicate the recipe for rice pudding that my elementary school served.  This comes very close!  I'll try it next time with a short grain rice as suggested.

This recipe is so easy! It doesn't take 45 minutes either. I always make this when I have leftover rice, even if it's been in the fridge a few days. Mine always gets thicker before 20 minutes is up, and I add either nutmeg and cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice. So good, and so much less maintenance than other puddings I've made!

Wow! Erica THIS is a keeper!  My family LOVES rice pudding, but in the past they never quite turned out that great at home.  However, I made a few changes and it came out delicious.  After reading many posts I decided not to use an egg raisons or butter at all.  I also decided to use brown rice as it is healthier and Vanilla Soy milk.  It did take a little longer to get creamier, but I kept stirring it and it set up perfectly!  Oh, I also used the suggestion to wait to check texture of rice BEFORE adding the sugar in.  I finished with cinnamon!  The texture will be a little chewey with the brown rice, but very yummy!  I also thought it was the perfect sweetness.  My toddler will love it IF there is any left for him tomorrow as he has already gone to bed!

really great recipe!! Best one I've found so far.

I used cooked rice from the night before. Omitted the butter as well as the raisins. 

Added some cinnamon to it & it was perfect!! So good. I loved it.

This is delicious.   I used organic vanilla soymilk, turbinado sugar and  minute brown rice.  I added a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon.  My husband absolutely loved it.  I will definitely make it again.

This was just what I needed! I was craving rice pudding and was glad to be able to use what I had on hand. I cooked it exactly like the recipe, except I added two tiny sprinkles of cinnamon. I also had to substitute veg. oil spread instead of butter, but it still tasted delicious. I will never buy rice pudding again! Thanks for the great recipe.

WOW!!! I don't even know what to say! This is an awesome recipe! I grew up on cozy shack rice pudding, and didn't think this was going to be close. It was soooooo good! Turned out exactly like the picture. I was afraid of scorching the milk, so, I tried to cook it at a lower temp on my stove. (cooked it on 4 on my electric range.) It did take longer than the recipe says, but, I just kept stirring it until it looked right. It was great warm, but, even better cold the next day for breakfast. I made it exactly as the recipe says. No add ins. Great recipe, blast from the past.

Absolutely delicious! The only change I had to make was to cook it longer than the recommended times at each step to get it truly creamy.

My husband just cooked this for my son and I. It was lovely. Worked a treat! My husband never follows a recipe, actually he rarely cooks... it worked. He added the sugar after the rice was cooked, so as not to risk getting hard rice.

Excellent. Exactly what I was looking for in a rice pudding. Creamy & sweet. I sprinkled a cinnamon/sugar combo to add a little something and also omitted the raisins. Highly recommend.

My fiance loves rice pudding and he gives this recipe a thumbs-up. I liked it although it is so rich that it's difficult to eat very much, but it's best right away. It does get sticky and dry if left for too long.

This is fabulous!  I used 2% milk and the instant 5 minute rice, as per the box (without the butter).  I also omitted the raisins and added nutmeg and cinnamon and WOW!  I do want to caution you . . .don't add the beaten egg to the hot mixture because it will scramble.  Try adding the milk first, letting it cool a bit then add the beaten egg.

I made this for my husband. He is a rice pudding fanatic and he said this was very good. So that is 5 stars! I didn't change anything other than I used one can of evaporated skim milk with regular skim milk.

This recipe is the best.  My friend had made this rice pudding a few years ago and I liked it soo much that a few days after eating it I was craving it.  I called my friend and she gave me the recipe.  We both coincedentally lost this recipe, untill I fell upon it on this website (my friend had not informed me that she had gotten this recipe from this website).  As soon as I found it I made it again, and I have some rice cooking as we speak for another batch.

sooo creamy

Delicious!  My whole family loved it.  We had rice leftover from dinner, the yucky instant/minute rice kind and I wondered if this recipe would still turn out but it did.  Everyone enjoyed it and I'm sure I'll be making it again.

This was good. I would have liked it to be creamier, but maybe the short-grain rice is the key.

Wow. This was so very nice!  I had never made, or even tasted rice pudding before (frankly, I thought it sounded disgusting...), but I just randomly made some tonight out of some rice I had left over from dinner.
I am such a novice in the kitchen and this was so easy and it turned out ridiculously well.  I was so worried it wouldn't.  My Dad really thought it was good too =)

My husband is English so rice pudding was a staple for dessert in his household.  Since I don't care for rice pudding, I rarely make it.  But he had a tough week at work so I wanted to do something little for him, just to make him smile.  His first bite of this dessert was filled with 'mmmms' and 'ahhhhhs'!  He said this was the best rice pudding he's ever had... but he added he'd never tell his mother that!  He ate the dessert in 2 sittings so I'm making some more for him this afternoon.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Soooo good! Made a double batch and I am glad I did it's just about gone. Great comfort food on a snowy day. I used long grain rice and 1% milk since that is what I had on hand.

This was a great recipe!  My family loves rice pudding and this was so simple and quick to make.  I doubled this recipe, added 1 full cup of rice per batch, added my vanilla to the milk and let it cook with the rice, sprinkled in just a few black raisins and omitted the butter.  At the end we topped it off with a touch of cinnamon.  What a treat!

Had leftover Basmati rice, already salted with some flakes of pepper.. and I thought.. oh well.. well.. yum yum yum!  Used 1.5 cups of skim milk and near the end added .5 cup of heavy cream.  At first didn't think it was going to thicken, and worried the egg would cook and scramble in the mix, BUT oooo it was perfect!  Used real vanilla bean seeds and cooked the empty bean with the rice and milk for a while.  Then removed it.  It's cooling on the counter as we speak and I have a SMALL bowl in front of me still hot while I scoop it in my mouth.   YUM.  Oh, no raisins.. ick.
PERFECT!

I have never made any custard like items before and I was going to just pick up pre-made rice pudding at the grocery store when I decided to try this recipe!  Wow!  Easy to make and quite delicious!  Thanks, Erica!

I made this for dessert last nite and it was soooooo yummy!  I did change a few things, I didn't put raisins in because my bf doesn't like them, and I used the canned evaporated milk instead of reg. milk. And I too added cinnamon. I will keep making this one!

YUM-O! This recipe cooked up just perfect. I used jasmine rice, a farm fresh egg, and fresh raw milk from our community farm. It was simply wonderful!

I absolutely love this recipe! Could eat the whole pot of it all at once, but I didn't. I used Splenda, added more raisins and had to use lactose-free skim milk because I am lactose intolerant, but I know if this was made exactly as it was sent in, it would be just as delicious. Thanks for a keeper.

I had great results with this recipe.  I doubled it, used arborio rice, substituted brown sugar for most of the sugar then added splenda to taste.  I also omitted the butter and substituted half and half for about half of the milk.  At the very end when I turned off the heat I added 6 or 7 capfuls of Appleton Estate dark rum.  What a treat!

This was a wonderful recipe!!  My husband and I are rice pudding fanatics and this was by far the easiest yet most delicious recipe.  I added lemon zest, cinnamon and nutmeg to the milk and egg mixture, and I substituted craisins for the raisins.

I used 1/3 cup raisins and left out the butter.  I used whole milk.  Myself and my 14 year old daughter think it is very good.  For us, it makes about 9 servings.

Pretty good! My 4 year seemed to like it. I used leftover rice and skipped the first step. Didn't add the milk 1/2 cup of milk at the end, and my 4yo asked me to not put the raisins in it so I left those out. Loved the vanilla flavor!

My husband grew up eating "rice 'n' raisins" but I wasn't a big fan...until this recipe!  I've made one batch with regular raisins and one with craisins, and added about 1/8 t each cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves at the end.  Next time I'm going to try it with brown sugar, as other reviewers suggested.  A easy and tasty way to use up leftover rice.

This is the best rice pudding I've ever had.  Next time I will make a double batch.  My husband and I ate all of this in a matter of minutes. Absolutely delicious.  
My only changes were that I substituted soy milk made from a powdered drink mix for the milk (I can't buy 'normal' milk here in China) and I also left out the raisins and added cinnamon.

Keeper, needs spices, but that can be added on top or whatever.  GREAT and beautiful layered (cold)in parfait glasses with pureed frozen (sugar added) straweberries and a little whipped cream, cinnamon and a fresh strawberry fan on top - Think about it for valentines day cause it's easy, beautiful and good.

I was craving rice pudding, and instead of finding some Kozy Shack, I decided to make my own for the first time.  This was REALLY good.  I omitted the raisins (none on hand) and added cinnamon on top of each serving (and I got 6 servings out of it).  Only thing I didn't like was that I had to babysit it while cooking to prevent it from burning (but that's why I prefer baking over cooking!)

Super good!  I made this just as described, but also added about 1/8 teaspoon of ground cardamom and a dash each of cinnamon and nutmeg along with the 1 1/2 cups milk, sugar, and salt.  Several folks at the potluck where I took this rice pudding commented on how good it was and asked for the recipe.

Delicious!
Usually, I read all the reviews for "tips" before making a recipe, but I was spacey today and just made the recipe as listed (with one exception: I used brown rice that was left over from last night's dinner instead of cooking white rice at the time of making the pudding).
It's super delicious! I will read the reviews now to see what other people did, but am pretty sure I will follow the same procedure I used today when making the recipe in the future. 
This is a great recipe. Thanks! Although, I must say that my waistline is in trouble now that I know how easy it is to make homemade rice pudding.... ;-)

Oh, my God! I haven't had rice pudding like this
since I was a kid staying with my grandma, way
back in the 50's. Made a few changes; left out the
raisins (don't like raisins), prepared the rice in my
rice cooker, added a 1/4 teaspoon each of cinnamon
and nutmeg, 1 teaspoon of orange zest and used
heavy cream in place of the last 1/2 cup of milk.
Thank you Erica for a dish that is to die for! This
is truly a 5 star recipe. Highly recommended!!!

Easy, delicious recipe...  I follow it exactly, and it comes out perfect every time.  3/26/14 update:  I've been making this with Jasmine rice for the past couple of years, and we like that better than making it with long-grained white rice because it stays creamy after refrigerating it.  It's great made with long grain white rice if you are eating it fresh and hot off the stove, but the rice hardens if it's refrigerated so the left-overs are not as good.  Also, this recipe says it makes 4 servings, but it makes plenty for 8 reasonably-sized servings.

Recipe very good, but must temper the eggs, like a few others, I ended up with scrambled eggs in my rice pudding but it was still great!! I made a double batch, the second with Splenda for my diabetic boyfriend and it was just as good!

Delicious, creamy, and easy!  I didn't bother with 2 different saucepans; just added the milk to the hot rice pan and proceeded from there.  Stir frequently to prevent scorching, though!

Very good.  Husband loved it.  Added a little extra milk when reheating individual servings the following day. The only thing lacking was cinnamon, so I added a few sprinkles at the end.

Yummy heavenliness!  This was fantastic!  My husband, who is a very particular rice pudding kind of guy, gobbled this up in no time flat.  Will definitely repeat!  It is extra delicious when you eat it warm.  Truth be told, there was none left to chill in the fridge, so I am sure it is great cold as well! Thanks for this one!!

My husband had a craving for rice pudding, and after trying several different ones baked with water baths we finally found this one.  It is PERFECT!!
Creamy and delicious.  I always use my rice steamer to make the rice first, and I have found that I have to double or triple the recipe if I want any leftovers. :) Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made this several times and I just love it.  I use dark brown sugar with a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg for extra flavor.  Yummy every time!

Yum! I added cinnamon and omitted the raisins. I cooked the rice in the rice cooker for dinner and used the leftover rice in this recipe. It was delicious!

Absolutely creamy and perfect. I eliminated the egg, as I wasn't sure how safe it was to cook for just 2 minutes. The egg wasn't missed at all. This is just great!

My family and I loved this recipe.  I was looking for a rice pudding recipe on a whim when I decided to whip one up with some already cooked rice.  Boy, was I glad I found this one.  It took a very reasonable amount of time to cook, wasn't too sugary, and was extremely simple to make.  I will DEFINITELY be making this one again (and again, and again).  The only thing I added to it was a bit of cinammon with the egg mixture, as was recommended by another reviewer, and I used plain soy milk because we never have cow's milk around.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I'm not a big fan of rice pudding but my husband and girlfriend love it. I used short grain rice and followed the recipe but thay eat it cold and after it cooled it was like paste. I had to mix in some milk and it was ok but it was still a bit starchy. Next time more milk for sure and vanilla. This would do well with a converted rice or par boiled such as Uncle Bens.

With cinnamon and a smidgen of nutmeg, this recipe would be 5 stars!  It was great... I used black raisins and two percent milk.  Loved it!

I'd never had rice pudding, but my husband loves it, so I thought I'd try it and this is my new favorite treat!

I just doubled the recipe and used 3 cups of leftover instant white rice from from dinner.  I also added a little bit of Pumpkin Pie Spice (nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger) just before serving and it was ymmu, yummy!  I'll definitely be making this again.

I've tried a lot of recipes for rice pudding, but this is the one I will use from now on. It is simple to make, and is very creamy and flavorful. I added a bit of cinnamon to my taste. I also left out the raisens and just added to the top of individual servings.

I have never eaten Rice Pudding but my husband remembered it from his grandmothers house when he was young. I had rice left over from dinner the other night and he said he would love to have some rice pudding like grandma made...no pressure!!!! I found your recipe and he LOVED it....I must say, it did not get thickf or me..I think it is an problem I have though because when I am cooking the milk mixture for any recipe, I must do something wrong because it NEVER gets thick. I did have to cheat and added a little corn starch to the recipe to get it thick but HE doesn't know...maybe this will save someone else in the futher...Thanks for the great recipe.

Great flavor!  I use brown rice, and I'm not sure if it contributes to the lack of creaminess I get each time.  Since mine doesn't get as creamy as some reviewers describe, it doesn't chill too well.  This is a great way to use leftover rice.

The first time I made this I forgot to take the pot off the heat before adding the butter & vanilla, and although it still tasted good, it was a lot better when I removed it from the heat first when I tried it a second time. I made this four nights in one week! I recommend this recipe to anyone who loves rice pudding.

I read most of the wonderful reviews so I tried this recipe. My husbands mother made some kind of creamy rice for him when he was a kid. I've tried to duplicate without an actual recipe but to no avail. I finally gave up but after seeing this recipe I gave it one more try. He said its pretty close to what he can remember. So I'm giving this one a 4 star +. I added cinnamon, no raisins. I'm not a rice pudding fan but DH is. I cut the recipe for 2 servings just in case he didn't care for it.

This is so incredibly good! We had only ever had traditional baked rice puddings before, and had terrible rice pudding memories, but this was fantastic and a new favourite breakfast food! I used evaporated milk only, but will mix with skim next time, as it was very rich. Thanks

Delicious! Mine came out a little salty so I added a little more sugar. Maybe next time I'll use unsalted butter like others suggested.

Yuck!  It might be my fault though - I used coconut milk instead of cow's milk.  This tasted terrible.  Also, when I mix in my egg it cooked up a bit into egg bits.  Yuck yuck yuck.

Amazing! Followed the recipes exactly, it turned out wonderful. My only tiny critique would be that it was very thick and solid when cold... I like mine to be a bit creamier. However, I just added a little bit of milk before eating, and that solved that! Also I added the raisins later, since my Significant other doesn't like them...they were still great.

This is a super simple and wonderfully delicious rice pudding recipe.  I serve it warm with the cinnamon and a little cool whip.

This was fabulous.  I used leftover rice from the night before and it turned out just as well as if it had been fresh.  Sliced almonds work really well added with the raisins to give it some crunch.  Terrific!!!

A+++  I was looking for a stove top recipe because I wanted to end up with something as close to what my grandma makes as possible.  I followed this recipe exactly with the exception of the fact that I didn't measure out 1 1/2 cups of cooked rice, I just used the whole amount and I omitted the raisins since my husband and I both don't like them.  It couldn't have been any easier to make and the taste was fantastic.

Next time I make it I think I'll add a little extra vanilla just because I really like it.

As a tip for those of you wanting to eat leftovers but finding them a bit dry:  spoon as much as you want in to a bowl, poor a little bit of milk over top, mix and throw it in the microwave until it has reached the desired temperature.  You should find that it tastes just like it did the first night.

I used basmati rice and substituted an equal portion of maple syrup for white sugar.  Instead of milk, I used 1 can of Skim Evaporated Milk + 1/2 cup skim milk.  Very creamy and quite tasty!

Pretty good! Each time I make this, I add a bit of large lemon peels at the end and let it soak in the pot, for a bit of a lemony flavor, then remove it after 10 minutes

This is the best rice pudding I've ever made!  And so easy!  Great flavor and texture - so creamy!  I adapted to what I had on hand - jasmine rice, non-fat milk and no raisins.  It was wonderful!  As it states, it should be served warm.  After it cools, it starts to thicken and lose its creaminess, but it still tastes great.  I will make this many times more!  Thank you, Erica!!

I made this a couple of years ago and didn't really care for it.  I made it again using arborio rice - the rice totally makes a difference.  This recipe was really good.  Using the right rice is the secret!

The flavor was fine, but the texture was not as creamy-smooth as I like.  I left out the raisins, I don't like them in my rice pudding.  It was easy & quick.  The rice did not pick up the taste of the pudding.

Oh, wow.  This is awesome.  It's my first attempt at making rice pudding and I'm amazed.  I had leftover rice in the fridge that I used, and I used regular (not golden) raisins.  I also added cinnamon.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummm....this is delicious. I'm even eating as I type. I used half the scrambled egg (tempered), as others had suggested omitting completely. I also used the full amount of sugar. I'll definitely make it again....next time I have a craving.

I did as some suggested and decreased the amount of sugar by half. However, i think it would've tasted fine with the whole amount. I would suggest mixing the milk with the egg so that the egg won't get "scrambly" as some said. It worked out for me!Although this recipe didn't turn out to be that fantastic than some said, but there was something about it that made me finish a whole serving.

I loved this recipe.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and skim milk to reduce the calories.  I also used 1 tsp. of vanilla and lots of cinnamon.  It turned out great.  It was even better the next morning for breakfast.  My son who doesn't like anything ate it, so it must be pretty good!

Never thought you could make rice pudding like this.  I used to cook the rice in the milk but this is so much easier...and every bit as tasty.  Wonderful recipe..this is my new way of making this for sure.  Tastes just like Kozy Shack!  Thanks for the recipe

Great recipe!  I've always liked rice pudding, but never imagined I could make it at home (I'm a new cook).  But this was very easy and very good -- even my family members who don't normally like rice pudding ate it up.  As suggested here, I did stir in some cinammon, nutmeg and honey.  Then today I decided to be brave and try my own version, and give the recipe a "Caribbean" twist: instead of two cups of milk, I used one cup of regular milk and one cup of coconut milk.  Then I replaced the 1/2 tsp of vanilla with 1/4 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp orange.  Still stirred in the honey, but left out the cinnamon and nutmeg.  Success!  A nice twist on a standard.

The texture on this is amazing.  But lacking in flavor.  Add cinnamon, bit of nutmeg, cranberries/rasins/other fruit, and also, cutting back on sugar and adding honey instead gives it a wonderful taste.

Love it.  Great way to use up leftover rice.

Turned out very well.  I did end up with scrambly bits in it from the egg, I should have read the reviews first.

Very easy and good tho!

I put a little cinnamon and nutmeg in it and it tastes good.  I have had better oven rice puddings though.  Fairly simple to make and still really good.

This was absolutely delicious.  I couldn't believe that I had made it!  I added double the vanilla and some cinnamon to taste (just for personal preference).

I am always looking for good rice pudding recipes but have been leary with trying stovetop ones. I have to say this is the BEST recipe I have tried and very easy. I did add nutmeg and cinnamon to taste and you do have to stir fast for the full two minutes after adding the egg so it doesn't scramble.

This was easy and tasty.  I did find though that the recipe made too much precooked rice.  I just didn't put it all in (measured the 1 1/2 cups and saved the rest).  Will definitely make again.

I made this omitting the raisins because my family doesn't like them.  This was wonderful.  Very similar to the rice pudding that you buy in a can at the grocery store.

I've made this LOTS of times with instant rice and I never put raisins in it because my kids won't touch it. They love this...got to have a healthy dose of cinnamon sprinkled on top.

Great rice pudding recipe.  I used leftover rice, skipped the raisons and added cin.  I also used a little cream in place of some of the milk.  Great recipe!   Extremely yummy way to make use of left over rice.  Thanks!

First time making rice pudding and it was pretty good!  Easy to double the recipe.  I added a cinnamon stick while simmering and DEFINITELY add the cinnamon.  The raisins totally compliment the flavour.

This pudding had the perfect texture, my husband couldn't stop eating it. I left out the raisins and added a couple of cinnamon sticks for the simmering and cooking stages (I took them out before serving).

i thought this was pretty good. my two year old absolutely loved it.  i improvised with what i had on hand which was jasmine rice.  i omitted the raisins because i had none.  i used half milk, half coconut milk and it turned out very tasty. i did sprinkle a little cinnimon on top for effect.  i think this would taste heavenly with toasted coconut on top or even with some chocolate shavings on top.  it would look pretty too.  unlike some of the others i thought it turned out really great after a night in the fridge.

Wow this was good.  I realized after I started making it that I ran out of milk..so I used cream instead and it was delicious!  Very rich and creamy.  Also, definitely add cinnamon and nutmeg.  Tops it off!

Good, easy recipe.  I used Arborio rice and a bit more sugar and did everything in the pot I cooked the rice in.  Very thick and creamy, but I think I would add some cinnamon next time.

This is great *IF* you plan to eat it directly after making it.  I put it in the frig and it was unpleasant afterward.  The taste was fine but the texture after refrigeration wasn't. The taste is really good when first made and it's very creamy! I will make it again.

this was delicious. it reminded me of my mother's rice pudding that i always attempted to make but never came out like hers, this one was very close. the only thing different i did was added a little more sugar, butter and nutmeg and then baked it for about 15 minutes in the oven. it turned out so good that i barely have any leftovers for myself today. thanks for the recipe, it's definitely a keeper.

Very easy recipe to manipulate.  Lacking eggs and vanilla flavouring (we had just moved), I added about a tablespoon of instant vanilla pudding mix and used 1% milk.  It turned out just fine.  Also, try adding the raisins a little early, so they soak up some milk and get nice and plump.

This was really good, although it wasn't as good as the recipe on here "Creamiest Rice Pudding". However, there was much less time involved with this recipe than the other. If you do have the time though, definitely try out the other recipe as it is really yummy.

Very nice rice pudding!  I used leftover Chinese takeout rice, and half-and-half in place of some of the milk, just because I ran out of milk.  I was concerned about the egg, but wanted to try it.  Following the advice of others, it worked well to beat the egg with the last 1/2 cup milk and then add gradually.  No pieces of cooked egg, very creamy.  Next time I'll try it without the egg, though.  I think it would be just as good.

I made this recipe using skim milk, Splenda, and egg substitute.  I also made it using soy milk, Splenda, and egg subsititute.  I served both versions cold.  Both were terrific.  Thanks for a good recipe!

This is a great recipe for a quick rice pudding. It wasn't as creamy as I like, maybe because I used long grain rice. I'll try doubling the "pudding" part of the recipe next time and use the same amount of rice.

This recipe was great.  I didn't add the raisins because I don't like raisins in my rice pudding, but my husband does so he add them later.  Also I prefer my pudding cold, so we chilled it first and it turn out delicious.  I used short grain rice and it made it very thick, next time I might try it with long grain rice, to see which I prefer.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Sooo creamy and delicious.  I recently tried a rice pudding made with coconut milk that was fantastic, so when I made this recipe, I used 1 1/2 C. coconut milk, and 1/2 C. regular milk.  It was dreamy!

Wow - this has become a family favorite.  We use jasmine rice.  Any time we make a dinner dish we rice, we just double the rice amount so that we can make dessert, too.  Great recipe!

Very easy to make!  It would have been better if I didn't add the butter at the end.  I soaked the raisins in the milk while the rice cooked.  I will give this 4 stars w/o the butter.

I love rice pudding but have not been succesful making it until I tried this recipe.  I suggest using 2% milk - I've tried skim and 1% and it's not as good.  I also use jasmine rice which adds a nice extra flavor.

I have only had oven baked rice pudding, but decided to try a "stove-top" one. OH MY GOODNESS!! I am going to have to double this recipe next time a make it so as to keep up with my husband and son eating it! I did personalize the recipe a bit. I added 1/4 cup vanilla/cinnamon creamer and 1/4 milk instead of 1/2 cup milk. I also added cinnamon and the littlest bit of nutmeg to the mixture while it cooked. Wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing!!! Wonder if you could make this with soymilk and splenda?

This was so delicious.  I have never had rice pudding and this was awesome. My b/f is a chef and even he was loving it.  Used evaporated milk instead and dark raisins and it came out great.  Also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the egg and beat it together.  Loved it.  will make again.

I was one of those people who thought rice pudding was a dessert Grandma would fix.  I tried this recipe because my husband (despite his age) likes rice pudding.  Boy, was I wrong!  This is excellent.  Sometimes I'll cook extra rice at dinner, just so there's leftover rice for this dessert.  It's very good, very comforting.  And I'm not even close to being a Grandma!

I replaced the uncooked rice with 3 cups cooked instant rice and equal amounts of whole milk.  Also, substituted the sugar with Splenda and used almond extract instead of vanilla - changed both because I was out of sugar and vanilla.  I give it a five star because it was sweet, smooth and creamy.

I made this with soy milk and it's amazing!  I used "better than milk" powdered milk, made it slightly thicker than normal, organic sushi rice (all I had!) and dark raisins (again what I had).  I also omitted the butter, doesn't need it!  This is amazing!!!  :)  Thanks!

This is SOOO good! My mom and I have been craving a creamy rich dessert for a while now, but since we're following a low-carb plan, we can't enjoy most desserts. I found this recipe, switched the sugar for no-calorie sweetener (Splenda) and enjoyed a very rich, creamy, rice pudding. The creaminess overpowers and masks the sweetener's yucky aftertaste, so this recipe was quite luxuriant for us carb watcher's. Thanks, sooo good, can't say it enough.

This is exactly what rice pudding should taste like.  I used about 3/4 c of half and half and 1% milk for the rest, and it was almost too creamy!  Next time I'll stick to the recipe or maybe try evaporated milk.  Also, I used liquid egg substitute instead of the egg and it worked out great.  A terrific way to use up that rice from leftover Chinese food!

This is great!  I didn't like rice pudding before trying this one.  It can be made using leftover rice easily because the rice is cooked in water instead of milk.  If you use regular raisins, the color will bleed into the pudding if left overnight.  Really easy to reheat: just add a little milk!

This was okay but pales in comparison to a true rice pudding that is oven-baked.  It was good for a stove-top variety but I won't be rushing to make it again.

Great way to use up leftover rice from takeout!  I used brown rice, ultraskim milk, 2 T sugar & 2 T Splenda, egg substitue, 1/4 c raisins, and light margerine.  It reduced the calories significantly, but it still satisfied my craving for sweet, creamy, comforting food!

This is my first review but I just had to let people know that this is the best rice pudding recipe out there.  Look no further.  This is the best.  My Dad and I have been trying many different recipes for years and nothing compares.  I did add a little more milk at the end because we like the pudding creamier and not so dense.  The taste is wonderful.

I made a couple changes to the recipe: I added the regular raisins a couple minutes before indicated to make sure they're hydrated and plump.  On the last addition of skim milk, I added about 1 tsp of cornstarch for thickness, but unless you want it near sticky rice thickness, I suggest you adhere to the recipe.  As a personal preference, I would have liked to keep the white color of the rice (I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg) and just dust the spices to taste before serving.  Lastly, if you are having problems with the egg scrambling, temper it.  That is, gradually add a little bit of the hot mixture into the egg until about 1/2 of the hot mixture is mixed in, then add it back into the heat with the rest of the pudding.  Aromatic, easy, and customizable with a nice texture! Not too sweet!

Yummy and perfect! Everyone loves this! It's also good with Splenda instead of sugar to lower the calorie count and make it more acceptable for dieters and diabetics.

I love this recipe. I am a big rice pudding fan and couldn't seem to find a recipe I was happy with. I was looking for something similar to the Kozy Shack.  This one is it for me.....I have also used Carnation Fat Free Canned milk in it and it turned out great.  Thank you Erica.

This is The Best Rice Pudding!  Thank you so much!  I have loved Kozy Shack's rice pudding for the longest time, but I always wanted to find a good recipe that I could make at home to have anytime I wanted it and thanks to you I've found it!  Those oven puddings are so gross!  Never again will I make one.  Thanks, now the search for the perfect pudding has come to a wonderous end.

For years now I have been trying to find a good rice pudding recipe.  This one is wonderful!!!! I work with a group of ladies for whom we prepare lunch once a week.  One week we had basmati rice left over.  We froze it, and then used this recipe the following week.  They loved it, and it has become a favourite of many (myself especially)

I made this recipe again with some changes, and it turned out so delicious! I used a rice cooker for the first step to speed things up.  Instead of the 2 cups milk, I used 1 cup light vanilla soymilk, ~1/2 cups evaporated milk, and 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk.  I put a cinnamon stick and a few star anise seeds in for flavor and omitted the butter, raisins, and vanilla.  Sprinkled a little cinnamon on top and it was perfect!

This is creamy served both cold and hot.  It is a recipe used frequently for breakfasts in our house.  We add a bit of cinnamon at the end and skip the raisens.  We have also enjoyed it with bits of cut up apples sprinkled in.

Loved this recipe.  Made it twice because the first time I almost ate the whole thing myself.  I left the raisins, because I'm not fond to them.  I'm not sure if I should thank you, because it went straight to my hips.  ;)

I left the raisins out and substituted soy milk (only kind of milk we keep in the house) and it was great!  Might add a bit of maple syrup or honey next time, I needed a teensy bit more sweetness.  I will definitely make this again.

Wow, this is awesome!  I've never made rice pudding before, desserts are not my strength.  It was very easy and delicious!  I used basmati rice...it's so delicate and tender, and not as starchy and clumpy as regular white rice.  I also used regular dark raisins and sprinkled with a little nutmeg!  Yummm!

Excellent and easy! The only changes I made were to use half cream and half milk, and added about a 1/4 cup of sweetened condensed milk at the end when I stirred in the vanilla and butter... gave it a nice custardy sweet flavor! It was great hot amd cold!

This rice pudding had the best flavor, even better than my mom's!  I doubled the recipe and everything was okay with two exceptions: 1 1/3 cup raisins was too much for my taste and the long grain rice I used took too long to cook and still wasn't quite soft enough by the time the pudding had thickened up.  I would maybe try short or medium grain rice next time to get creamier pudding.  Also, I mixed half whole milk with half skim milk.  Still, I can't say enough about the wonderful flavor!

At first I wasn't sure whether or not I liked this.  I think it's because the only kind of "rice pudding" I've ever had is a kind my mom makes which does not have egg in the recipe and is not very creamy. After a few bites, though, I determined that I did like this recipe and I found myself going back for seconds (and thirds).  Also, the raisons compliment the pudding VERY well, and if they had been omitted from the recipe, I probably would not have enjoyed it.

Very good.  This is the first rice pudding that I have ever liked.  I served this and there was none left for the next day.  I did leave out the raisins because nobody likes them in my family, but other than that, I followed the directions exactly.  Thanks

Just jumping back in on top of my old review to state how much this is still my absolute go-to recipe for rice pudding. Making up another batch this afternoon, probably several years after my first review (and definitely almost a decade since I first tried it!). 

--------------------------------------------------------------------


I didn't even like rice pudding until recently, when I tried some kheer rice pudding at the Indian Restaurant. Ever since then, I can't get it out of my mind, so I thought I'd try this. It's different from kheer because I'm using regular white rice, but I'm going to try it with some Basmati and see if it's closer.

It was just really, really good, with everyday ingredients I had around the house and extremely simple preparation. After I made the first batch Saturday night, I made the second one Sunday night. I ate the last of THAT batch for Monday morning's brakfast. And, the baby loves it, too!

Thanks a lot Erica! The Atkin's diet is down the drain! I burned my tongue trying to eat it off the stove and now my jeans are way tight from comfort food overload! Yummy, couldn't wait for this one so I cut back the milk and shortened the cooking time, also used short grain rice. I'll be finishing it off for breakfast!

I loved this recipe.  It was quick and easier than other recipes I've tried.  To add more cinnamon flavor, I added a stick of cinnamon while cooking the rice.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I thought this recipe was great.  I used evaporated milk mixed with regular to make it a little more rich.  I did double the amount of vanilla, though, because I like the flavor!  To "spice" it up, I sprinkled pumpkin pie spice on top when serving (though, it was just me eating it, no one else in the house likes rice pudding, too bad for them!).  It was relatively easy to prepare over all.  Many thanks for sharing

This tastes just like the rice pudding my grandmother used to make when I was little.  It's god if you toss in cranberries (dried) along with or instead of the raisins.  I like to leave out the eggs and use less sugar too!  Overall amazing recipe!!!!

Did not care for this.  It took too long to cook, and was not creamy.  The husband did eat it all, eventually, but he admitted it wasn't the best.  Sorry.

This is what rice pudding is supposed to taste like!  I agree about using unsalted butter - salted would throw this one into a whole different taste area.  This one will not last a day in my house!
Thanks for the recipe!

My first time making rice pudding and it turned out great! My son and husband loved it. And it was so easy! Thanks. I did cut down slightly on the amount of sugar to add, but that was just my personal preference.

This was a good rice pudding, looking for one like my sister in law's mom makes.  This was quite different from that.  Very creamy.  I used Instant White and Brown rice, as that is what I had on hand.  I also added nutmeg and cinnamon, would probably skip the nutmeg next time, too powerful for this dish.  Also, I will temper the egg first next time.  I will try it again with a few more modifications.  Very good.

Really good but not the absolute best i've had.  I used short grain rice and added some cinnamon and nutmeg.  It also needed a little extra sugar for my taste.  Also great cold.  Very good!

The recipe was easy to follow and very simple. This was my second attempt at making Rice pudding from scratch (I had previously tried another recipe). This one was much tastier and not as dry. I would definitely try again and maybe use a little more milk - still not creamy enough for my taste.

For now on, I know what to use that extra box of rice from Chinese takeout for!  This rice pudding had a nice creamy texture to it.  Not too sweet either.  I added 1 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon as suggested by a previous reviewer.  I was hesitant about all of that nutmeg and should have followed my gut feeling.  It came out a bit too spicy.  Next time around I will add 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, and the same amount of cinnamon (1/2 tsp).

Delicious!!  This rivals KozyShack for creaminess, taste, and consistency.  It was very creamy and lovely.  I didn't add the raisins as the family doesn't like them, but I followed the rest of the recipe and it came out perfectly.  I used "medium grain sticky rice" and I think this was the key to the consistency.  Thank you Erica!

This was the easiest rice pudding recipe I have ever made and also the best tasting!  It is so creamy!  I used medium grain rice as I like the creamier texture.  It rivals Kozy Shack in creaminess!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Well, we just got too poor to buy the lovely little pots of Mullerice at there, so I thought I would try my hand at making my own tonight!  This is not quite the same stuff, but it is just lovely in its own special way.  I found that adding a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg makes a good thing even better.

No more store bought rice pudding for this family. Excellent recipe! The only change I made was leaving out the raisins, as no-one in my family likes them. Thank you for sharing :)

Easy, smooth and can be made low fat.  No more oven rice pudding for me.  I've made it for my husband's grandparents and they thought it was great.  I did add nutmeg and cinnamon as others suggested. I've made it a few times and both times have been consistant with flavour and texture.

I made this recipe using rice milk and it was super. I love the creaminess and the vanilla taste. It is the perfect comfort food. Even the kids loved it, what little I left for them! Will make it often!

I hate to be the lone voice of dissent since so many people have given this recipe great reviews, but it just didn't live up to the hype, in my opinion.  It tastes just like Cook and Serve vanill pudding, which isn't a bad taste at all, but still, it's not what I expect from a rice pudding.  I might make this again (hubby liked it), but I was a little disappointed.

This recipe was good but not great. Maybe my cooked rice was too hard to begin with but it didn't soften much after cooking it in the milk per the specified duration. I should try short grain rice next time. The egg gave it an unusual flavor but the raisins were a nice touch. It took a lot of stirring and monitoring over the stove so it was a bit time consuming.

This pudding is so good! It has a terrific rich flavor and is really creamy. At first I didn't think it was going to thicken but it did, and was well worth the time it took standing over the stove. This is the kind of recipe that you can make at anytime cause the ingredients are always on hand and its very inexpensive. Thanks for such a great recipe!

This was the first rice pudding recipe that I ever made that came out "just right"!  It was not too thick or too thin (my usual problem!)  Everyone agreed it was delicious.  I doubled the recipe and it still came out wonderful.  I used boil in bag rice, so that cut some time off, but I still stood for quite awhile in front of the stove :)

This recipe is outstanding! I substituted skim milk for whole milk and increased the amount of rice. I did not use the butter. The pudding tasted perfect and it was easy to make.

Yum! Yum!  And so easy.  I added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg then sprinkled the final product with cinnamon.  Can you tell I love cinnamon?  Anyway, it was delicious!

Not bad.  Needs a lot more milk (add at least 1/2 cup more milk, to desired consistency), otherwise you'll need a fork & knife to eat the stuff (not literally, okay).  I like the stuff cold or hot, but left out the raisins (hate raisins).

I didn't add the raisins but the pudding was great.  I did sprinkle more cinnamon as I ate the pudding.  Next time I will add some cinnamon sticks to the pudding as it is cooking for more cinnamon flavor.

This rice pudding is the best rice pudding I ever had. My boyfriend, my mom, and her co-workers loved it. In fact, one of them already requested this for her birthday next year. The fact that it dries up so quickly did not scare me. I was able to keep it moist and creamy. After it cooled down, I added 1/2 cup or so of milk and 1 tbsp. sugar. It stayed moist and creamy for days (I hid some for myself)! Thanks Erica.

This is the tastiest and creamiest Rice Pudding I've ever made.  It's great warm or cold, whatever your preference.  Thanks Erica!

Rice pudding isn't something I'm very familiar with, but my husband likes it so I gave it a try. This was easy and soooo rich and creamy. My kids asked for seconds! What a wonderful new treat to add to my dessert box!

This is the first rice pudding recipe that has ever turned out for me!  And on top of that, it is delicious!  Rice pudding is one of my husband's favorites, and now I can make it for him without having to throw my efforts in the garbage can!  Thanks, Erica.

I was very successful in using brown rice with this recipe...although not as good as if I had used white rice, it was still very, very yummy!

I live alone and often cook for just myself.  I try to find recipes that withstand the tortures of the microwave.  This was not one of them.  Tasted good the first time when it was warm and creamy, yucky cold and gross reheated.  I won't make this again unless I've got a crowd to feed.

Very creamy, very delicious!  Once this cools, it becomes quite firm -- I 
added more milk when I re-warmed it, and it was just wonderful.  If you
like rice pudding, you must try this.

i've tried several rice pudding recipes, and none seemed quite right.  this recipe was excellent, economical, quick, low maintenance, and great tasting.  i made it twice in two days, and each time, between giving it to people and having some for myself, i seem to run out of it before i've even started.

This really is such a tasty treat!  However, cooking 3/4 C of rice yields much more (probably double) what is needed in step #2.  This is not really a problem, though, because I am already planning to make another batch.

My first time making rice pudding, it was amazing. However, even without raisins I found it very sweet, which is an easy adjustment for the next time.

The first time I made this it came out weird. It didn't thicken up and it was grainy. I looked around for why and I must have had the temp too high. I made it again with a lower temp and it came out perfect. Creamy and perfect. I used parboiled white rice.

I followed the recipe and it turned out great. We ate some immediately, but when the rest cooled I added a little milk to make it more creamy. I used basmati rice.

I've been making for year.  I usually triple the recipe.  And I don't use a separate clean pot, just add everything to the cooked rice. 
For the ultimate in creaminess, I only use Arborio (Italian) rice.

Did not have any medium-grain rice.  Only long-grain and short-grain.  We opted for the short-grain.  We also did not have 1/3 cup sugar...maybe 1/4 cup.  Used what we had and sprinkled a little Truvia in there.  Instead of transferring the cooked rice into another pot, just use a bigger pot and use that to cook until the end.  It turned out fabulous.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Great rice pudding recipe! After making this a few times, here's what I've learned: Firstly, the reason for using a new saucepan  to heat up your milk, sugar & cooked rice , is because your pot you will first cook your rice in will create a film on the bottom. This is not ideal for heating up your milk & sugar to make your pudding. You need a clean surface.  The hardest part of this recipe timing of adding the egg. I read somewhere to add some of your cooked rice mixture to the egg & milk mixture first, then adding the rice/egg mixture back into your pudding while AWAY from the heat. For me, this ensures my egg won't scramble. . I've made this recently with COCONUT milk- Can you say decadent?

Made with long grain rice, and it turned out great. Med grain would definitely be creamier....but still liked it with long.

Although this was easy. It lacked flavor,  the rice was overcooked and I believe the bath to be unnecessary. I've made baked rice pudding before that had a much better consistency and flavor and didn't require a bath. It seemed to separate, if you will. Thin custard like layer on top and bland overcooked rice on the bottom. I used long grain rice and followed the recipe top the letter.

I was craving rice pudding and this came out right. I subbed dried cranberries because I didn't have raisins.  Then I paired it with Cupcake Moscato D'Asti. Yum!

Very delicious.  I used jasmine rice, it was all I had, golden raisins.  Messed up and put lemon extract in, tried to dig it out, but it has a vanilla lemon flavor to it.  Not bad at all.  Used two medium sized eggs.  Whole milk.  Tastes pretty good to me!

Omitted the raisins for personal preference, and this recipe is perfect. My husband used to believe that he didn't like rice pudding. I forced him to try this, and now he is wanting me to make this a couple times a week! Not too sweet, the rice texture always turns out amazing, just delicious!

This is so yummy and I love it. I cooked the rice in my instant pot so I had rice all ready to go. I think a couple of people were complaining about the egg cooking when added. I did it as the recipe said first and the next day when I made it, I added the milk with the beaten egg before adding to the rice mixture. The egg was fine both times, but maybe if you add the milk to the egg, it will be less likely to become scrambled! This will definitely be my go to rice pudding! Easy to make and very tasty!

Delicious! Easy and straight forward. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg at end. We did however find it was a bit to sweet so next time I'll just add 1/4C sugar instead of a 1/3C.

First time maker.  This is really good! I put Crasins instead. Might use a bit less sugar. Great texture!

** It might help some: I mixed the milk and eggs together thoroughly before adding the mixture. Someone mentioned having chunks of white egg? That definitely won’t happen if you blend beforehand.

Quick and easy way to use left over rice from Chinese takeout. I whisked the egg into the reserved milk which, helps prevent the egg from cooking when added to the hot rice/ milk mixture. I also used splenda (my husband is diabetic) use 8 teaspoons to replace white sugar. Turned out great!

Just made this for a delicious Cheistmas Eve treat.  I substituted light brown sugar for the white.  Added a few extra raisins and par boiled them first.  The pudding turned out velvety rich and so delicious.  Thank you for the wonderful (and easy) recipe.

I used medium grain white rice and it was perfect! I prefer to soak my sultanas in water overnight first (you could add rum or sugar if you wanted). I also used only the egg yolk.

The good thing about cooking rice for rice pudding is that you WANT it gluggy. So there’s no harm in taking the lid off & giving it a stir to see how it’s going. I ended up having to add an extra cup of water so I could cook my rice for longer as it wasn’t quite soft enough (you want to make sure the rice is 100% cooked and soft before adding your milk & sugar). Better to be over cooked than undercooked.

I lightly rinsed my rice before cooking but not afterwards. Next time I won’t rinse it at all as the starches help to gluggy up the pudding.

Amazing recipe. Will never use any other for rice pudding!

I made this with left over Jasmine rice. It came out delicious! I used dark raisins because that's what I had and substituted about ¼ cup milk with heavy cream (just for fun). The result is delicious.

I've never made rice pudding before, and this still came out wonderful. Super simple to throw together from some leftover rice; just make sure to whisk the heck out of your egg and be careful when adding it in to avoid any weird cooked chunks. Absolutely made my day, thank you!

I blended my egg into the last half cup of milk. Made this over and over, no lumpy sugar issues, no lumpy egg issue and yes made it in the same pot. After rice is cooked add milk into same pot. Reserving that half cup of milk to beat in.
Quick note I always make extra rice in rice cooker and use leftover for my rice pudding

I have made this recipe three times now.  The first two times I microwaved a cup of rice with two cups of water in a four-cup measuring cup and used the required amount of rice for the recipe and I needed the plain cooked rice leftover for other meals.  The third time I used bulgar wheat instead of rice. I measured a cup of bulgar to two cups of water and let it.cook.  I then followed the recipe exactly and now I have a perfect bulgar wheat pudding which I will eat for breakfast.  I added some pecans as well.

We loved it! And super easy. I already had cooked white jasmine rice in my refrigerator so that saved a bunch of time.  I also used half & half because I didn't have milk. I'd make it with half the sugar next time.

This is the 3rd time I made this.  Only made 2  tweaks  to this recipe.  Since at my family's house,  they use skim milk, I compensated for the creaminess of using 1 cup of half & half & a half cup skim milk for the 2 cup milk aspect of this recipe.  Also, I plumped up the raisins in water (and then drained) b4 adding to the recipe pudding.

Very good recipe for rice pudding.  I mixed a small can of evaporated milk with the regular milk. Also added some cinnamon sticks while cooking in milk.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

I added a heaping tablespoon of Cream of Rice cereal while cooking, cut back the sugar a bit (I use Turbinado), used my Madagascar bourbon bean vanilla, and skipped the raisins.
It came out creamy and rich. A dash of cinnamon, and my wife proclaimed it better than her Grandmother's (which is apparently the Family Standard).
World's Greatest Husband title secure!

Love it, will make this again.  I used Basmatti rice since I was trying to use it up.  I had salted and added some butter to it in my rice cooker, but no matter.  It was delicious.  I also added a few shakes of ground cardamom while cooking, then followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Lovely recipe, this is a keeper, thank you.

I don't even like rice pudding, however, my wife is pregnant and was craving something sweet at 12:00 am. So, in a pinch, I followed this recipe almost word for word. I added 1-cup of sugar after slowly simmering the rice and milk to a desired consistency. Afterwards, I followed the tips left in other reviews and put the hot mixture into the beaten egg before adding it to the rest of the rice. I did use long grain rice and reduced it's starch content by rinsing in cold water then putting it into boiling water with salt for 2-min and rinsing a second time before finally cooking it again in salt water.

It turned out divine almost like a warm ice cream. Just take your time.

I loved this recipe as did family members.  I tempered the egg before I added to the hot milk/rice. Other than that I didn't change a thing.  This is the second time I've made this recipe and won't be the last.

I use almond milk instead of regular milk, and it still has a pretty thick consistency (perfect for me). I usually double the recipe because my boyfriend loves to eat, and I usually leave out the raisins because I'm not a fan. However, when I put in the last of the milk, I always add some cinnamon to my rice. Sometimes we put a little bit on top after we dish it out as well. Pretty tasty stuff!

I absolutely loved this recipe! I didn't add the raisins though. It was fantastic. I've tried a few different recipes for RP and this is by far the best I've had. Thank you for sharing this with us!

Rich, thick, creamy, delicious! Just what I was looking for on this cool first-day-of autumn morning. Thank you, Erica! Marvelous recipe! Just a reminder to those having trouble.. tempering your eggs with a bit of the warm rice is a must if you don’t want scrambled egg in your pudding.. take it slow & easy. You don’t want to rush this - trust me, it will be worth it!! I added a couple of sticks of cinnamon to the second step (just as my mom used to do) and, to cut a bit of the sweetness & add more depth of flavor, topped the finished pudding with ground cinnamon and ground cardamom. Yum!!

It's amazing! I make it for my dad with monk fruit sugar. He's diabetic and he loves it. I use 3/4 cup as it is not as sweet as other sugar substitutes.

Perfect way to use up leftover rice! I stirred in a little cinnamon & a dash of nutmeg. I only used 1/4 C sugar & left out the raisins. It was plenty sweet. Might even try to reduce the sugar a bit more next time.

I liked this recipe, tasted good and was easy to follow. Only thing I would have done differently was temper the eggs prior to adding them. I ended up with bits of scrambled egg in my pudding which was not very nice. Otherwise a solid recipe!

I followed the recipe as written. However, after reading a review from someone who had problems with the recipe after adding the egg. I decided to mix the last 1/2 cup of milk and the egg beforehand. The recipe turned out perfect. This was my first attempt at cooking rice pudding. 
Thank you for such a well written, easy to follow recipe. I give it a thumbs up and 5 stars

Texture is great!! Easy to make. For me, if there is any modification I would make, I will be trying less sugar the next time I make it. I know it's supposed to be sweet, but it was TOO sweet for me...my head hurts... Hopefully the texture will work out even with less sugar. Otherwise great recipe!!

I make just as written, with one exception. I add the raisins at the same time as the milk and sugar, to let them boil as well. Makes a big difference:)

Absolutely delicious. However, I wish the texture wasn't so "ricey". 
So I simmered it on very low for another 12 minutes and it was much more preferable to me.

I've never had rice pudding before. I live with three roommates (all guys) and I wanted to try an alternative to ice cream and saw this recipe. I accidentally added a little too much vanilla, but it didn't seem to affect it much. All my roommates and I loved this recipe and (most likely) will continue using it. Thank you, Erica!

Excellent recipe. I just cut back on the sugar and it was delish! The raisins add in that extra little sweetness!

Read review regarding the egg..I just mixed the egg in a cup. Stirred my rice mixture as I dribbled the egg SLOWLY into my rice mixture. Vola! No lumps. THANKS FOR SHARING!

I used milk and cream and I added a bit of lemmon peel. Pudding was sooo creamy and delicious. Definitely 5 stars.

Came out superb!! Only tweak I did was I added just a little bit more sugar and instead of raisins because my child does not like raisins, I used dried cranberries. Works just as great. But over all..Delicious!!

I followed the recipe exactly as directed but I could still taste the egg and salt.  It was tolerable, but I wouldn't make it again.

Just finished.

Used long grain rice, turned out fine. Didn't have vanilla, so I subbed it for rum 1:1. Didn't have golden raisins, so normal raisins it is.

Doubled the recipe. All in one pot. Crock pot nonetheless 

Finished off with about half a tsp each of nutmeg and cinnamon (that's 1/4tsp for original recipe).

Added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. Have made it twice now and will every time I get that craving for rice pudding. I love this so much more than the oven version I used to make.

When my favorite little Greek restaurant closed down, I literally cried. The food was good, but honestly I cried because they made the BEST rice pudding I ever tasted. Rich and creamy, with cinnamon and nutmeg, filled with soft raisins, served warm the way I like it, and topped with a crunchy caramelized sugar top like creme brulee. Oh my goodness, it was heaven in a bowl, a warm hug from the angels. I have been trying to recreate that pudding for 15 years with no luck. Fast forward to now...my teenager will be having her wisdom teeth removed next week and she requested creamy rice pudding for her recovery time. No raisins for her and she wants it cold, but this recipe totally nails what I have been searching for since my favorite restaurant closed. I used evaporated milk as some other tips suggested as well as medium grain Calrose rice, plus I added cinnamon and nutmeg,  but otherwise all was the same. I'll miss the raisins, but I'm sneaking off to "test" it a little more precisely while it's still warm. Shh..don't tell on me!

I made this recipe for my husband before and it was delicious. The second time I made it, I didn't have all the milk required so used 1/2 and 1/2 for some of the 2 cups called for and it turned out well. The success of my second batch encouraged me to experiment with other kinds of milk and I'm happy to tell you all that using flavored coffee creamer really kicks the pudding out of the ballpark.  Use whatever flavor you like in the same quantity listed and you won't be disappointed!

This is an amazing recipe! I eyed the amount of rice I had left over from dinner. Probably about 2 cups of rice. I followed everything but adding the raisins. I dished it out and served with cinnamon sprinkled on top. It's absolutely the best rice pudding! Also I used Arborio Rice.

I triple the recipe, go a hair under on sugar and then add a couple extra free range eggs from my sister for extra nutrients. We have 5 kids and they all love it.

Turned out great! I used Oat Milk instead of regular milk since my boys are allergic. Turned out very creamy. I did have to keep an eye on it though, since it cooked a little faster than the directions.

It was perfect...I don’t like raisins so I didn’t use them. It was the closest to my grandmothers recipe as I can remember. I will make it again and again. It will be a recipe I use often. Thank you

Made exactly as written. I did , however, mix the milk into the beaten egg  and add a couple small ladles of the hot pudding to it to temper it before adding to the pot. I liked the addition of the egg to thicken the pudding. It beats standing in front of the stove stirring forever.

Easy and delicious. I used 2.5 cups of leftover cooked rice and the amount (more than the recipe calls for) was fine. Also used a combination of 2% milk and half & half. I mixed some of the hot milk mixture into the beaten egg & milk before adding it to the pot. Came out perfect.

This recipe works great. Adding a little extra salt, cinnamon and some nutmeg helps make the flavor a lot richer. I added a tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg.

Try it with a tiny pinch of ground Cardamom on top. OH My. Cardamon is  more of a floral flavor, it goes well with the raisins and it is not as strong as nutmeg and cinnamon. This  was the best rice pudding I ever made. - and I have made a lot of rice pudding!

I made this recipe on Saturday and again today which was Tuesday . I cook for 2 grown men , who love good food.  It turned into an argument over who ate the last of the pudding .  That is why I made it again today. I like to Keep everyone happy . And I loved it as well i went by the directions,  but added some cinnamon , it was creamy and perfect both times. Oh this time I doubled the recipe,  So my house is very happy with the love of this delicious rice pudding recipe. So thank you, God Bless & Much love.. I think I will rename this recipe to "The peace Pudding "

I just made this and it was excellent!  I had rice leftover from dinner and didn't want to waste it, found this recipe and decided to try it.  I omitted the raisins (I didn't have them), used about 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla and sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar and nutmeg. It was the best rice pudding I've had in a long time.  And this was my first time making it too.  Definitely a recipe to bookmark!

When I was in school, our cafeteria made something they called “creamed rice”.  It was served with a large ice cream scooper and almost always served as a side dish with chili for some reason. I would add sugar to it to make it a dessert and a little milk to make it more pudding-like. This is the first recipe I’ve ever found that tastes exactly like that creamed rice.  It’s so delicious and it’s the ultimate comfort food. I try not to make it more than twice a year because once I make it, I can’t stop eating it!

I had some extra white rice in the fridge so I set that boiling with some milk and water while I looked for a recipe. Eyeballed the quantities. Didn't have Raisins. Very important to mix the beaten egg with some cold milk. I also added some warm milk from the saucepan to the egg mixture (egg and cold milk) to temper it. Keep stirring over a low heat while pouring the in the egg mixture a little at a time. DH was very happy.

I made a mistake in cooking this and added the egg in with the first milk.  Thrifty me kept cooking for 15 mins and it turned out wonderful.  Can anyone see a problem with that.  I will try it the other way next time.

Absolutely delicious, very easy. Followed exact directions, left out the raisins since I’m not a fan. It is very sweet, will make with less sugar next time.

I liked it, mine did not come out as creamy as the picture, I did use whole milk, and 1/2 and 1/2, next time I will only cook for 10 min and add 3/4 to 1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 at the end.  it had great taste

Made this for the first time ever after I bravely asked my boyfriend, "What's your favorite side dish?" He told me his mom's rice pudding, and I thought for sure I was doomed to fail. However, I tried this recipe and didn't change a thing. I made sure to buy medium grain rice and add a little bit of the hot mixture to the egg and milk mixture so the egg didn't turn into "egg-drop soup." Those tips worked great. I also used heavy cream instead of butter, but only because I was short on milk. :) Overall, awesome recipe that I will make again. Oh! And the boyfriend's review? "Better than my mom's." BOOM. Thanks, Erica!!

At the end, mix together milk and egg and temper before adding to avoid "scrambled egg" in pudding. For a lactose-free option, I used soymilk instead of milk.  Worked great for taste and appeal! My pudding came out rather thick, so added another 1/2-3/4 cup milk as it cooled for a pudding that flowed a bit more than forming a massive clump. (Or perhaps I cooked it a touch too long?)

Very nice pudding, hints of when I was a child on the farm :) mine/this recipe is better, only because I used real vanilla extract. Mom only had access to artificial.  It makes a world of difference :)

This has been my go-to recipe for the last three years. I finally found a recipe that my husband admits is better than his moms??. The changes I made are just personal preferences, the recipe is good as is. I used 1-3/4 cup of milk for the second addition of milk, because I like the rice pudding a little looser. I also added cinnamon and did not add any raisins.
After it’s cooled, you may have to add a little milk and stir it in, to loosen it.
Great recipe, Erica-thanks!

Love this recipe. Turns out perfect every time.
For those saying their rice turned out chewy after using brown rice-brown rice is chewier than white rice to begin with. If you find egg whites in your pudding it's because you aren't beating the eggs long enough. I have not had a problem at all.  

One thing I DID change was I used a rice cooker-and I added vanilla and cinnamon to the water that I added into the rice cooker to cook the rice. It made the house smell fantastic for 20 mins and the rice came out already seasoned and yummy before I moved it to the stove and  added the milk and other ingredients. I also sometimes use a tiny bit more milk at the end just for a creamier texture. But I haven't Always had to add more. Sometimes the 1/2 cup at the end is just right, other times I add a little more. Either way the recipe is a hit with my family who do not normally care for rice pudding. This is a new favorite.

I love this recipe! It's even great when I'm out of raisins. 
It's perfect for using up the leftover white rice on Chinese takeout night. Having cooked rice cuts the preparation time down by 20 mins. and makes for a quick simple dessert.

This is a good one, in this recipe what i did is use half milk and half cooking cream and i double the recipe , the raisins to make them much plumper and juicy i put them in boiling water for a few minutes in a bowl and reduce the sugar a little. then did the rest of this recepi. It turned out so so good and creamy. Will definatly doing again.

I think the recipe turned out pretty good for the first time through. I used brown minute rice and instead of white sugar, I used honey. I also added vanilla extract and about a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. Next time, I'm going to increase the Milk by another 1/2 cup. Or I will decrease the rice a tad. It's a little trickier when you use minute rice, but the results are tasty.

The egg must be tempered, othwise you’ll get scrambled egg. The egg helps thicken pudding. I would not recommend leaving it out. Add corn starch for more thickening. I sprinkled cinnamon on top and omitted raisins. Yes, I’ll make it again.

It was very good , I really liked it and so did my daughter. And she's picky , . 
I only made a few things like a little more butter and a sprinkle of nutmeg and allspice. I made my daughter's with pumpkin spice and cinnamon. Will I make it again "Yes" . 
Thank you

I cut the milk in 1/2 and added back with evaporated milk.  Added Perigord shaved black truffles and also cut the sugar to 1/4C.  Served with shortbread and topped pudding with chopped pistachios and fresh raspberries....Yummy!

Perfect for a rainy day!  (Or if you have a bunch of mild about to expire!)  I like to add a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg to up the flavor.

I love this recipe! Made it exactly as stated and turned out great. The second time I tweaked it a bit. I used half brown sugar with the white and a heaping tablespoon of maple syrup instead of vanilla. Still great! Very tummy warming on a cold winter morning!

I did it without the golden raisins. I'm an Argentine, married with an English man and I was looking for a traditional English recipe so we can eat rice pudding when we are in Argentina. Our "Arroz con leche" Is different, we do it without egg and butter, for example. Thank you, I love the recipe :)

Came out great! I added cinnamon because my family loves it, and a bit of half and half cause we were low on milk.  Really pleased with this great  simple dessert!

I had made coconut rice the night before (replace half the cooking water with coconut milk; I used canned) and thought to make some kind of porridge or something from the leftovers then found this recipe. I had just enough rice to not need to modify the amounts and went with it. Using leftover coconut rice and milk for the first reduction stage, I subbed Truvia baking blend according to the package. With the egg, I used the remaining coconut milk from the can of the night before, which ended up being 1/2c and about 1 tbsp. Butter and vanilla the same. 
It tasted great warm from the pan and the coconut was very subtle, just a little bit *extra*. DH is the rice pudding fan in the house, but I’d make this again just for myself even if he doesn’t care for my changes

I had neither raisins nor vanilla extract, so I put some cinnamon (about 1/3 tsp) and nutmeg (about 1/4 tsp) in while mixing the milk, sugar, salt, and rice together, and then added a dusting of cinnamon while I was mixing the butter in. That gave it enough flavour to be quite pleasant/tasty, at least for me. :)

Fabulous! The smoothest, creamiest rice pudding I’ve ever had! For the person complaining of egg chunks: whisk final milk and egg together before adding to hot mixture, then whisk it in as you add it, stirring constantly for the final 2 minutes.

I didn't make any changes except I used regular California raisins and let them cook with the milk, rice and sugar, to soften them up. I usually get baking raisins but couldn't find any. It came out perfect. I added cinnamon at the end. I will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks!

I love this recipe!!  Absolutely the creamiest I’ve ever made on top of the stove!!   Just a small addition of adding 1/4 C. of sugar free French vanilla liquid creamer. This was my second time making and can’t understand why anyone would rate this less than 5 stars!!  My favorite by far!

Never made rice pudding before, but made it for someone who needs soft foods for a bit.  Kicked it up a bit with the zest of one orange when cooking the rice, 1/2 t. of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  I'm not a fan of rice pudding, because it is pretty bland, but these additions really make it flavorful!  Tempered the egg with the warmed milk and added just a touch more salt.  After the first bite, I got a fist bump, so it must have hit the spot.

Turned out great!
     Not being a milk fan I used Vanilla Soy Milk.
I took the advice from another rating . I took the  1/2 cup of Milk I warmed in the microwaved and beat the egg into that . I then added it to my mixture.
     Vanilla Soy Milk is a little sweet any way so I also used only a 1/3 cup of sugar .I also skipped the butter.

I made it but soaked the raisins in dark rum before adding.  Very tasty but I think I prefer the kind that is baked and becomes more firm.  Still praiseworthy.

This is great! It's creamy, delicious, and takes me right back to my childhood when my grandma would make rice pudding for me. The only change I made was to add cinnamon at the end. I'm not sure it's true rice pudding without cinnamon! I've made it twice in under a week and am having trouble sharing with others. I guess that return to childhood is stronger than I thought!

This is a very easy recipe for a great rice pudding. Those who had issues seemed to have deviated from the recipe (used brown rice, which takes much longer to cook) or maybe didn’t think when adding the ingredients (added egg directly to hot rice).
I  use “broken rice” from the Asian mkt. it’s smaller grained so makes a creamy pudding. Also I beat my egg into the milk and let it sit while the rice was cooking in the milk stage. Then add when instructed.
Also for,those who seem to not add all of the cooked rice, I think if you don’t use all of the rice, it will be thinner. I like mine thick, so I used all of the rice.
Last tip... soak your raisins in a few TBS of Rum to plump them up a bit!

Really great recipe if you have some leftover rice! One word of advice: STIR THE EGG immediately and quickly when you add it into the hot mixture or you’ll get cooked egg clumps!

This was amazing!! I mixed the egg with the milk (I used soy) in the last step and had no issues. I also used jasmine rice that I had already made in the rice cooker. My family loves it so much that I have to double the recipe when I make it. Thank you so much!!

I just made this 5 mins ago and it’s great. My grandpa loves rice pudding but I’ve always just bought it at the store, I’ve never tried making it. He asked for a bowl this afternoon but when I looked in the fridge.... we were all out.?? So I finally decided to make it. It’s super easy and it came out creamy with just the right amount of sweet. Only thing I change was omitting the raisins and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.

Loved it! Great taste! I liked it because it's just the right amount of sweetness. I used Jasmine rice instead of regular white rice. I thought that I had raisins on hand but I didn't. I DID however have dried cranberries on hand. So I thought why not? I did use the cranberries and it turned out great! :)

My memories of rice pudding from childhood involved burnt chunks of milk that darkened the pudding and added a "crisp" flavor. This was my first attempt (and I'm 45! - I guess I had been avoiding it, but then I had extra rice, so...) It was extraordinary! Someone's 1 star review suggested that it didn't set, so I realized that I needed to cook - and stir - at a relatively high (med-high) heat for a solid 15-20 minutes. I used a whisk and set up a show to watch on my ipad to help distract me because standing and stirring for 20 minutes takes a toll! I did it, though, and it set beautifully. And it tasted great hot - and no crispy burnt chunks floating about, and I am in love with this - though it is extremely rich and fatty. I did sneak a couple bites for breakfast this morning and it tastes great cold, too!  I let the pan soak a bit in hot water and it was easy to clean, so YAY! I think I'll use this for winter holidays.

No review is a great review unless you have made a recipe as written :) 

Made this a few times and it is absolutely wonderful with or without the raisins (as I personally hate raisins in cooked foods) picked them out the first time, then completely omitted afterwards! 

Wonderful use to leftover rice!

I just finished making this. Love it!! I added a bit extra sugar accidentally. I used extra white rice I cooked up a few days ago. I miscalculated the sugar, but it’s yummy!!  Thank you for the recipe! I know I’ll be making this again! This one came out thick and creamy, just the way I remember it! Will be testing it on the family tonight. Hubby liked it ??

Followed the recipe which went smoothly.  Have a favorite recipe which requires simmering and stirring for an hour.  Was hoping this would take the place but not nearly as creamy.  guess I'm back to simmering and stirring when time allows.

I always use brown rice due to the health benefits. While cooking my brown rice I add a dollop of coconut oil instead of vegetable which just adds a wonderful flavor. I also use almost half the sugar and its still plenty sweet because of the raisin. I also do 1/4 C milk and 1/4 C  orange juice instead of all milk and that gives it more sweetness and a touch of orange flavor.
It's a also super good with craysons especially with the oj.
The perfect comfort food on a cold day!

Very easy to make, it may have taken 30 minutes or less.  My rice cooker speed up the process and made it pretty easy.  The vanilla flavor is just about right, I was initially suspicious that it was too little extract but it did work just fine.

Fast snack for the cool weather.

This was really good.  The only thing I did differently was add a little hot pudding to the egg/milk mixture before adding to pudding as suggested by other reviewers.

Should have doubled the recipe, came out great.  I used long grain rice, no problems.  Tempered the egg with some milk, sugar & vanilla - no curdling.

Great recipe, a must try.

Delicious and easy. The only thing I did different was to add all spice while cooking. I used regular raisins because I had them on hand. Thank you for sharing your mother's recipe.

For anyone who complains about egg white in your rice pudding just beat the egg with the half cup of milk.

Best creamy rice pudding ever. I have been making amazing creamy rice pudding for years. It's always been a favourite but I've made it the hard way. Standing over a pot stirring while cooking the rice in milk. My flavour secret was that along with the standard cinnamon, which is common in most rice pudding recipes, I added nutmeg. The flavour was delicious. Since there was no call for cinnamon or anything other than vanilla extract, I added the cinnamon and nutmeg when I added the milk. That is the only change other than putting the salt in the water when cooking the rice. The result was fantastic enough that I will be using this recipe from now on. Thank you so much for making one of our favourite desserts so much easier to make.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, and it was creamy and delicious.  My husband loved it too.  We like cinnamon so I stirred in a little bit of it, at the end, but this pudding was terrific without it,too.  I have a son-in-law who loves rice pudding.  I’m always trying to find a recipe that will impress him and I think this is the one that will do it!  Thanks Erica, and Erica’s mum!

Can you conjure up the recipe with the use of brown rice    Otherwise this sounds like a good recipe that I'm sure to try.

Great recipe! Thank you. 
As I prefer healthier options, I modified it a little - I used coconut milk, honey and dates, instead of milk, sugar and raisins, in the exact same quantities and it turned out great! 
Perfect texture, sweetness and taste. I would think it will be just as great without the egg for vegan enthusiasts.

This is an excellent basic rice pudding recipe. You can use instant rice instead of regular...I have tried both and the finished product is the same. So a couple of tips : scramble the egg in with the remaining milk before adding them. I have read where some have had problems with an "egg drop" effect and it eliminated this issue. I added 1/2 cup more milk as well. I used pancake syrup instead of vanilla (only about 1 1/2 T). And I added more raisins. Can't have too many raisins. :)

Used leftover jasmine rice, evaporated milk and half and half. I would back off on sugar a bit the next time, but adding cinnamon really makes a difference.   I tempered the egg mixture, which does really make a difference.

Coming from New Jersey I now live in Florida.But I always miss Jersey diners and their rice pudding.I just made this recipe and was very surprised at the out come.I used Jasmine rice because it doesn't stick together.also added cinnamon while eating it.I cooked it a little longer so it was not milky.I wish i had raisins  but did not. A great warm creamy rice pudding.If 50 people like it and 2 or 3 do not guess what. lol

My husband loves rice with his dinner but ALWAYS makes too much, so we tried this tonight. Our son has egg and milk allergies so we used almond milk and just omitted the egg, and it turned out great! We were thrilled to find a recipe to use our leftover rice and that our son could eat since there are so few desserts that can be made without eggs.

I love this easy recipe for rice pudding! I have a rice cooker so making the rice was easy. This is creamy and sweet but not too sweet. I would highly recommend anyone making it. I did not add the raisins and it still came out PERFECT!

This is my 2nd time making this, and it came out even better this time around.  I substituted splenda for the sugar, but used the equivalent of 1/3 cup of sugar and it tasted delicious.

So the pro is that it's pretty easy to make. I never made rice pudding before and this came out pretty similar to the store-bought boxes I usually get. I did think it ended up too sweet and that's from someone who loves desserts, but that's easy to adjust with less sugar.
The big thing is I made this twice - once with cold leftover rice, and once exactly based on the recipe, cooked just for the pudding - and both times the mixture ended up being too thick and was burning up/sticking to the pan way before the time indicated in the recipe. I had to adjust by adding a lot of extra water or milk. I feel like I must have more than doubled the amount of liquid and yet the pudding is still very very thick (and sweet). The first time I thought it may be because the rice was dry from being leftovers, but the second time cooking the rice was basically no different.
Now that I know this, I feel like I can make this again and have all the proper portion adjustments and have it turn out great, but following the recipe as is would lead to some very sweet thick burnt rice.

Absolutely the best I've ever had with a few steps changed for simplication. (There is really no need to measure the water so I just heated a big pot of water and medium grain rice, then drained and RINSED after the given 20 mins.  I worried not having the starch from the drained rice would interfere with the texture and thickness but it turned out to be needless. Thick, creamy decadent!  

The other simplification was that I beat the eggs then added to the milk with the raisins. I then added this mixture to the pan.  I believe it contributed wonderfully to the custard like texture.  
Everyone wanted the recipe.   Thank you for sharing!

I used medium grain rice, added more raisins, and made sure to temper the egg (added a bit of the hot rice to the egg until it was warm so it doesn't cook). This recipe was awesome!

When making this recipe the first time, I followed it exactly (sans raisins, cause ick.)  The second time I made it, I substituted 1 cup of milk and the sugar for a can of sweetened evaporated milk. This cuts a lot of work with the recipe, and made it much faster to make. I also tempered the egg before adding it so it didn't scramble it. This thickened the pudding wonderfully. It was delicious and creamy.  If you'd like super creamy pudding, use jasmine scented rice and over cook it in too much water, till it's almost rice porridge consistency, then add that to your pudding. Make it the second last thing you add however, as it may just make the addition of the egg unnecessary. The flavor and texture profile of this make it a huge favorite of my Mom and Nana. They both asked for the recipe and it replaced my great grandmothers in the position of favourite rice pudding, and only they know her recipe.

Excellent! Of course nobody else likes rice pudding in my house so I was forced to eat it all myself. I did wait to add the sugar until 5 minutes left in the initial time period. I used short grain rice and 2% milk.

Absolutely delicious. I loved every bite. I stirred the egg with the half cup of milk together before pouring them in, this way the egg cooked in well, and it wasn't chunky.

It's not exactly like my mom's recipe that I was looking for, but it comes pretty darn close! I'm not sure what my mom does different though (maybe it's a touch of "mom magic"). lol But this is definitely the best rice pudding recipe I've found anywhere online! I will be glad to make it again! It's really good! Thanks for sharing this!

Adult 2 I also added a tiny bit of almond extract. I will definitely make it again!! Everyone LOVED it. The 8-year old says he’d rather have this than ice cream. 8 year old I don’t like almonds. Teen says it’s good.  Gramme says really awesome.  Adult 1 wants to make it a part of the food pyramid.

OK.. I'm very hardheaded, and although the reviews recommend short to medium-grain rice, I only had long-grain rice.  Well, after about an hour of stirring on very low heat, and following the REST of the directions, it is to die for!!! I wish I could make this DAILY..

I followed the directions (minus the raisins) and it was delicious. I will make this again with the raisin for my nephew because he enjoys them.  
A strong basic recipe that cannot go wrong. Thanks!

I've eaten so much rice pudding that is watery and soupy, but this recipe is so much better. for those struggling with it turning out too thin, just cook the rice/sugar mixture for a little longer. Mine never starts to really thicken up until almost twenty minutes in. 

The last time I made this I sprinkled chocolate chips on top of my hot bowl of pudding, to make a really rich chocolate version. Also another variation is to use Jasmine rice, which lends a very unique and exotic flavour.

OMG! this was so easy to make and even better to eat. I did make a couple of tweeks. I had left over Jasmine cooked rice which used. I also used half regular milk and half evaporated milk, added a little cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. Delicious!!!

Followed the recipe except used coconut milk as my husband is allergic to cow’s milk.  Still turned out deliciously! Great way to use leftover rice.

My new favorite treat! It was simple to make with things you have in your home from day to day. I used rice that was left over from our rice cooker and it was amazing! Have made it twice since I saved the recipe :)

I hate when people haven’t tried the recipe and doctor it when they do but..... I realized, much to my dismay, I ran out of vanilla extract over the 4th of July (dang cupcakes). So I substituted it with 1/4 tsp rum extract, added cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg. 
I also scrambled my egg in with the remaining 1/2 c. Milk (which I used almond milk) because I was afraid I’d get scrambled eggs in my pudding. 
All in all I’d say my version was like Christmas eggnog in my mouth which wasn’t bad, even though I will totally mAke this the right way. I would still blend the egg and the milk before adding it though.

This was the 2nd recipe I've tried making rice pudding, and after buying it in the stores (Senor Rico brand) I give it 5 stars! The only thing I wished I had done differently was use medium grain rice instead of long, but I used long because that's all I had . 

I rate this 5 stars!

I used leftover jasmine rice from dinner the night before to make this recipe for rice pudding.  I have just finished my second helping and boy, is it good.  Be sure to watch carefully and stir constantly as the milk/rice mix cooks.  It can burn easily.  Oh - and sprinkle cinnamon on top.  I think I need a nap now....

I've made this pudding twice. The first time it seemed to runny so I used 1/2 cup less milk. Once it had cooled down it was very thick and too dense for the person I was making it for to eat. The second batch I did exactly and as it cooled I stirred it to keep it light. It turned out perfect and light and creamy. I used Jasmine rice for both batches, next time I'll use plain white rice like Uncle Ben's.

I may have overcooked it because mine came out very thick. I think I will add more milk when I make it again. The taste is delicious. I also added cinnamon last step.

Very good! Iadded cinnamon and nutmeg only because I love spice and it was delish! I also used whipping creme for the last 1/2 cup which made it thicker, but not like glue. Will do this one again!

I didn’t have vanilla so I substituted real maple syrup.   It was really good and gave it a subtle difference in taste  from standard vanilla rice puddings I’ve had before.  I think I’ll stick with maple syrup instead of vanilla from now on.

I just made this recipe. It did NOT thicken up like recipe said  it would.  Added the egg in hopes it would. It thickened up slightly. Letting it cool now before trying it. Will update after I try it.

This is the first time I’ve made this and it was yummy. Although I think I will sweeten it more next time. Good recipe!

Many thanks to the person who shared this! Ever since I discovered this wonderful recipe about 6-8 months ago, I've made it, (almost) exactly as stated, at least once per week. (I omit the raisins, but I do that with just about every recipe that calls for raisins.) The recipe is much easier than I had anticipated, and I've (almost) always had great results. I messed it up one time so far. Still not sure what I did wrong, or even how to describe what happened to it...lol. On a side note, I can't write this review without mentioning how amazed I am that I don't have to be careful to make sure the milk doesn't separate or burn. It's weird! Pretty cool, but still super weird.

Outstanding. As mentioned in another review, make sure the rice is cooked completely and don’t change a thing. This recipe brings back memories of my childhood. Thank you

Amazing recipe! I added about half a tap of nutmeg and cinnamon. I didn’t have any milk so I used almond milk and it still turned out amazing!

I made this using coconut milk, which allowed me to cut down on the sugar almost completely! I also added a teaspoon of a spice mixture I use for making golden milk which is cinnamon, nutmeg, turmeric and ginger.  Delicious! And (ever so slightly) nutritious!

I absolutely loved this rice pudding. I made it with 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk. Came out super creamy!!  My 4 year old grand daughter absolutely loved it.  Will make this again and again and again ??

When hot, it will seem too loose but will solidify quickly as it cools. Reminds me of childhood breakfasts. My grandmother used almond and cardamom instead of vanilla.

This was amazing... just like my grandmother used to make it. Now I did make a few alterations- after the rice mixture thickened, I then took it off the stove and added the butter, raisins, vanilla and cinnamon. I mixed the milk and the eggs separately before adding to help against curdling and then slowly added that little bits at a time while vigorously mixing in between additions. I then poured the whole thing into a greased 9x13 and baked on 350 for about 15-20 minutes until the tops got golden brown and the center was custard-like... since that's how I grew up eating this recipe. IT WAS JUST LIKE I REMEMBER!!! Thank you for a great starter recipe!

Used slightly less sugar, and mixed milk with cream to give it more richness. Turned out great. Made this for my Nana and she said it tasted just like her mother used to make.

Tip: if you double or triple the recipe, cook the rice and milk and sugar mixture longer! It should be thick and creamy. I tripled the recipe and kept adding time until the texture was what I wanted.

Also, short grain rice (like Japanese rice, will give you a creamier, thicker, chewier consistency. 

Add fresh ground nutmeg if you have it! 

I made a ton of it for my son's preschool Cinco de Mayo party. A hit!

Followed the recipe but I used left over rice and it took longer than 20 minutes for it to get nice and creamy. I did not pour the beaten egg into the hot mixture directly. I poured some of the rice and milk mixture into the egg to get the temp up and then poured that into pan (seen that trick on Food Network). This avoids the eggs from scrambling in the pudding. 
I did not have raisins on hand so I used dried oranges instead.

This is a good recipie because you can make it on the stove top. I used a can of  evaporated milk instead of regular 2%. I found it improved the flavor and consistency of the pudding.

Just made for the fourth time— lactose free 10% table cream and 1% lactose free milk, basmati rice and pure vanilla extract... I make two batches at a time— one with and one without golden raisins... don’t skimp on the nutmeg and cinnamon ... so good

This is the only recipe you'll ever need.  I doubled it to take to co-workers.  did fine doubling the recipe.  It is so creamy, and just mildly sweet which is so nice.  I whisked the egg  and added it to the milk then added it as directed.  Only addition was just a bit of freshly grated nutmeg and a touch of cinnamon.  This recipe is perfect.  thanks so much.

Skipped the first step and used leftover rice.  So easy and so creamy!    I had some evaporated milk  and coconut milk to use up, so added that in along with the regular milk.  Also added a bunch of cinnamon because we like it.

Very easy, tasty recipe. I used instant rice the first time and the recommended amount of milk. I think I overcooked it a little because it was really thick. The second time I used leftover jasmine rice with 2c milk, plus another 3/4c with the egg. It turned out much creamier the second time. I also put some of the warm rice into the egg mix before slowly adding it.

My fiancé and I both give this a 10 out of 10 : -) Creamy, not too sweet, an absolutely lovely flavor! I used the medium-grain rice that others recommended and the creaminess was perfect.

This rice pudding is excellent.  I used long grain rice because that's what I had on hand. I just added extra milk, vanilla and sugar.  I also used a can of carnation for the 1 1/c cups and whole for the for half cup at the end.  This is the second time I've mad this recipe but not the last.  Great job Erica G.

This came together quickly and easily even though I did make the mistake of dumping the raisins into the pot with the milk, sugar and rice - and then had to scoop them all out before heating up the mixture. Lovely creamy texture and mildly sweet taste. Will definitely make again!

This is the best rice pudding I've ever made (I usually just get the Cozy Shack stuff). I'm a rice pudding purist, so I left out the raisins, and didn't add cinnamon/nutmeg. I used basmati rice, which was tender in only 13 minutes. I also tempered the beaten egg with the 1/2 c milk by drizzling in some of the hot rice mixture, while whisking constantly, before adding it. I usually make it by cooking the rice in the milk/sugar mixture and it never comes out right. This was perfect, and easy!

No more left over rice in our house. This is FABULOUS! I've made it with skim milk and almond milk and it's great both ways.

Delicious and creamy. My kids all loved it. I omitted the raisins since I’m not a fan and used cold leftover rice and sprinkled cinnamon on top. Yummy!

It does not get any better than this, or any easier.   This was an unplanned desert.  I made a pot of rice which turned out sticky and I didn't want to use it in my entree. So I immediately went to all recipes  and looked up rice pudding because my mom loves it.  The rice was regular long grain variety.  I left it right in the pot I had cooked it in and followed the recipe.  
I gave up cows milk years ago and drink/use almond milk.  I am hesitant to use it as a milk replacement in recipes sometimes it is fine and sometimes not. (did not work in instant pudding)  It was raining and I was not going to the store so I used half/half and craisins instead of raisins. 

I followed the directions with those 3 exceptions: Regular rice, 1/2&1/2, and craisins and the pudding turned out amazing.  The texture and taste were perfect!  I will be doing it again.

This was wonderful.  The only changes were I used whole milk and regular raisins because that is all I had on hand.  This was my first try at rice pudding and I was very pleased.  At first it did look a little soupy but, I let it sit in the pot for 10 minutes after adding the butter and vanilla and it thickened up just perfect.  Thank you for the recipe.

Came out great! I used aborio rice & added cinnamon at the end. I also doubled the recipe to make 8 servings. Came out rich & creamy. I didnt use 2 different pots like it calls for,not sure why it says to no need for it.

I dont use white rice, so I used brown.  The key to no lumpy egg whites is the temperature.  You cant make this on a high burner setting or you'll get cooked eggs instead of a creamy pudding.  Also, add the remaining milk (to cool temp a bit) then immediately add egg.  This also helps prevent cooked whites.  Mine took longer because I had my burner too low and had to turn it up.  The end result was amazing.  Cant wait to go to work and brag to my co-worker about making this from scratch since he loves bragging about his wife making rice pudding from scratch and never brings me any.  DEFINITELY a keeper!!!

There's a reason this recipe has over 4042 reviews and 4.5 stars- it's simple and amazingly delicious.  Probably my favorite winter comfort food desert ever.

I did do one thing differently; instead of using two cups of milk, divided, I used 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of full-fat coconut milk.  Delicious!

I’ve been iffy on making my own rice pudding. This recipe was super simple and is made from things that I had in my kitchen anyway so I decided to try it. I did what other reviewers said and combined the second part of milk and the egg in a bowl before adding to the pot. I also used only one pot. I hate to dirty dishes for no reason and it didn’t seem to matter in the end. Added cinnamon and a little nutmeg. I made it 30 mins ago and half is it’s already gone. Will definitely double the recipe next time.

BUT! ADULT VERSION! 
I used 5 cups basmati hot rice cooked just with a TBLS of butter. Mixed a ~14oz can of sweetened cond. milk, 1/4 cup of spiced RUM, ~ 1/2 -3/4 cup of milk , ~ 1/2 to 3/4 cup BROWN sugar, and a cup of SPICED RUM SOAKED CRANBERRIES! (I put the dried cranberries in a dish, filled it with rum to about 3/4 of the way up and nuked it for ONE minute) A dash of salt, (~1/4tsp)and mixed all these OTHER ingredients together and added to the pot of rice. NO EGG. Cooked for about 5 more minutes, remember the rice was HOT from a fresh batch.  Sooo creamy, so so creamy, sweet and rum zippy! 

 So you say; "this isn't anything like the recipe!"
Yes, BUT, this is the recipe I used to get the idea!

This was great if any of you don’t know cause I didn’t rice isn’t supposed to be drained so use the exact amount of water when cooking your rice cause I didn’t measure it and mine came out a little thick, but great recipe nonetheless!

I made a few changes, I added about 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg.  A few reviews have stated that the out come was soupy. If that is the case, make sure you use Whole Milk or it will not set up.  As others have stated make sure you incorporate the egg mixture by adding a little of the rice mixture to the 1/2 cup milk, sugar and egg.  I added about 1 Tablespoon  at a time to the egg mixture, stirred it, added another, stirred it in.  In all total I probably did this  about 5 or 6 times.  The key is to use Whole Milk and incorporate the egg mixture.

Pretty easy to follow although make sure to follow directions very carefully. I made with arborio rice instead of plain white rice because it's extra fluffy, and it worked out deliciously! Once finished, I trickled a little extra milk over the top, splashed with cinnamon and almond shavings,  and topped with blueberries and pomegranate seeds! It was perfect! It served my boyfriend, our housemate, and I with larger serving sizes.

I only had brown basmati rice, so I let that soak for a day and cooked it about 35 minutes during the next phase of cooking I let it cook an extra ten minutes or so. It still wasn’t as creamy as I would like, so I added a half tsp of corn starch and it turned out just as I had hoped.

I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, and added nutmeg, cinnamon and mace. This has to be the best recipe I’ve ever used. I also used soy milk instead of cows milk.

It was just like my mom used to make. The best comfort food ever. I just regular raisins because that is what I had in mind. I doubled the recipe and it was still gone way too soon.

Wonderfully creamy. Reading what others did, I added only 1/4 cup sugar and waited until after it was creamy and thick. I added some of the mixture to the egg and milk added later in cooking and then that mixture back into the pot for the two minutes. I only had whole milk and not even enough and had to finish off with a little heavy  cream! So decadent! I don't care for raisins and omitted them, but sprinkled my bowl with a little cinnamon.

Easy & creamy rice pudding.  Better than Kozy Shack!  I have made this recipe three or four times now.  The first time I made it without raisins because I didn't have any, and it was just as good.  When I made it with raisins, I only added about 1/3 C because 2/3 C seemed like it would be way too many raisins.  Otherwise, I made the recipe exactly as directed.  I serve it warm with cinnamon & sugar on top.  YUM!!!  My family loves this recipe.  I have doubled the recipe, and it's just as delicious the next day served cold.

First time making rice pudding and everyone loved it.  Since I was working with leftovers, I used saffron rice instead of plain rice and eggnog instead of milk but those were the only changes I made.  Oh, and I tempered the egg before adding it to avoid hard-boiled bits.

I simplified by doing:
1/2 cup of Kokuho Extra Franck Medium Grain Rice, cooked with 1/2 tsp of salt in 1 cup of water for 20 minutes in pot over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally.
Added 1 cup of 2% milk to pot, and continued cooking for another 20 minutes on medium-high heat, stirring occasionally.
Added 3 tsp of brown suger and a splash more milk to keep it loose. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
At this stage, just add a milk of milk if it’s too thick, add salt or sugar or other flavour as you wish.
I then poured it into a blender, added a bit more milk to loosen it up and pulsed it 4 or 5 times for about 3 seconds each time, to break down the rice more.

At this stage it was the PERFECT consistency to be able to draw up into my favourite 20mL (3/4 oz) or 60mL (2 oz) syringe, for being able to squeeze into my mouth (I just had double jaw surgery so can not chew well or use my lips yet to use a spoon at all).

Awesome! This is a GREAT foundational recipe. I plan on testing with various types of rice, and also using broths instea of milk, and also trying other subtle flavors and spices. For basic sustainable that I can take eating each day with subtle variations, this is a KEEPER!!!

Followed the recipe exactly.  I made it with left over white rice from our Chinese take out the other night.  We usually rarely eat the white rice but this time I thought I would try to use it for rice pudding.  It turned out great.  Sprinkled the top with cinnamon and it was delicious.

I cooked 3/4 cup ofJasmine rice with1 1/2 cups of water and1tsp of unsalted butter for 20 minutes. I checked the rice to be sure it was tender (based on reviews I read before starting!). I had a cup of coconut milk leftover, so I used that plus a cup of 1% milk, 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/4 tsp. salt, and added them all to the rice in the pan in which it was cooked. It cooked for 18-19 minutes, and I added 1tbsp. unsalted butter so it could melt. Then, added 2/3 cup of golden raisins. I mixed the egg with 1/2 cup of heavy cream, then added a small spoonful of the cooked rice pudding and mixed it together. I continued to add the hot rice pudding, a little at a time, until the egg and heavy cream were warm. I poured the egg and heavy cream into the pan and continued cooking for 2 minutes. I removed it from the heat and stirred in about 1 tsp. of vanilla. I tried a taste, and all I can say is MMMMMMMMMM! I put the pudding into the refrigerator, and I’ll report back on how it cools.

I followed the recipe - but not totally. I used almond milk and non-dairy butter. I also didn’t include raisins. Still turned out delicious! I will definitely be remaking this for holiday parties.

Thank you for a tasty, easy & versatile recipe! One could use any form of milk, go with or without raisins, spice as desired. I used all the proportions except the sugar--I prepped the 1/3 cup called for, but tested as I added & ended up using a little less and it was plenty sweet. I also didn't have raisins, but am sure they'd be a nice addition.  I'm thinking you could use other dried fruits, too. We love cinnamon so instead of garnishing with it, I put it in the rice when it was cooking in milk to infuse it into the entire pudding. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because you can't give 4.5 and I think 1/3 cup sugar would be too much, especially if you added raisins which are sweet as well.

I absolutely love this recipe. It even works as I use a mix of brown and white rice. Also not a raisin fan so we leave those out. It is so creamy and delicious!

Only change I made is that I peeled the outer layer of an orange, put half in the boiling water mix and then the other half in the rice pudding mix. Remove at the end, totally kicks up the flavor to another level. I would also warm the remaining milk, temper the egg to bring it to temperature to lower the risk of it scrambling.

I modified a bit... loving Indian spices I flavoured it with cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and a few strands of saffron instead of vanilla. Though I used the recipe for amounts and timing, instead of 2 cups regular milk, I used 1 cup 2%, 1/2 cup coconut milk, 1/2 cup of evaporated milk to make it taste creamier. It turned out so creamy and amazing!

This is a great recipe. All I had was long grain rice, so I used my electric mixer to mix/chop it up as it was cooking after I added the 1.5 cups of milk, and it turned out perfect. I also added 2 extra tablespoons of sugar and one teaspoon of sweetened condensed milk. Creamy. Delicious. Perfect.

Quite easy (especially when using leftover rice from Chinese takeout). I omitted the raisins as I do not like them cooked in things. I may try it again using other modifications.

Great recipe!  I subbed unsweetened almond milk instead of regular milk and the consistency was still rich and creamy.  Just had to add cooking time to boil down.  Also added some cinnamon.

Swap Splenda for sugar at 1:1 ratio, and swap Craisins for raisins.  I'm not sure on the calorie count with this change, but I know it's less, and tastes great.  I plan on making it like this again.

This recipe for rice pudding is absolutely marvelous.  The only difference I made was I used half and half (didn't have any milk in the house) and I am pretty sure that doing this tipped the scale on fat content.  I also used Jasmine rice because I have found it does much better in my recipes (better flavor and texture.)

This was my first attempt at making my own rice pudding. I don't think I let the rice cook entirely because it's not as creamy as I would like. I may have to try short or medium grain rice next time. 
Overall the taste was great. I added a dash of nutmeg and a dash of cardamom over it, which was delicious.

Very good. I mixed the egg with the last 1/2 c of milk prior to mixing it in. I still had a few pieces of cooked egg that I had to fish out, even though I stirred constantly and vigorously. Very tasty!

I've never even eaten rice pudding.  But I was looking for something for dessert and had leftover rice and thought, "Hey! Why not?"  I found this recipe and it was THE BEST.  Even my child who was highly skeptical that anything with rice in it could be good enjoyed it!  Followed the recipe just as stated except omitted raisins because I have a family of raisin haters.  I could eat a whole panful of it!

Wasn't really that creamy.  Could have used a little bit more sugar.  I'm not saying that it was because of the recipe.  It's just the way it turned out for me.

We liked this. I used left over rice. It was long grain, but it still thickened well.

This turned out perfect and it is so delicious! I read the reviews and I cannot understand how people did not like this. I mixed the egg with the half cup of milk before mixing it in with the rice mixture and because I did that it blended beautifully. I also added some ground ginger and ground cinnamon to add more flavor. This recipe reminds me of what my dad use to make when I was little. Yummy!

The recipe was fantastic! Unfortunately though, I over-did it when sprinkling nutmeg on top - a little goes a long way! But the actual recipe itself was perfect!

I've been on a rice pudding hunt lately. Today we had Chinese delivered and had tons of rice left over. I've never made rice pudding before so googled for recipes. This recipe looked the easiest and sounded the best. I just started at step 2 with my already cooked rice. It came out perfect! I was so excited to have my very own delicious rice pudding like my mom used to make.

An easy, creamy rice pudding! I beat the egg in the 1/2 cup of milk and tempered with a few large spoonfuls of the hot rice mixture.

It's the perfect easy homey dessert.  For those that found pieces of egg in the pudding, you always have to temper an egg before adding it to a hot liquid.  I mixed the egg, milk, and a sprinkling of cinnamon together, then tempered the egg by mixing hot pudding into it before adding the egg to the pudding.

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe: I must admit I'm rather lacking in terms of cooking ability, but it turned out delicious. I'm rather skeptical about the egg, since I added a large white egg and it seemed to overpower the rice a little, but in the end the pudding is still good. And yes, I agree with others: a little less sugar would be nice.

Awesome recipe! I've never made rice pudding before and this turned out fantastic. I had some left over rice in the fridge and this recipe was a great use for it. So tasty. For those of you who had trouble with the eggs- I took a little of the hot milk out of the rice while it was cooking. You very slowly pour it into the eggs while whisking the eggs. Then, I took that egg and milk mixture and slowly added it to the cooking rice AFTER adding the additional cold milk. Make sure you keep the mixture moving and you won't get cooked eggs in your pudding :)

I read the reviews and decided on this recipe because it cooks on top of the stove, and you can use cooked rice.  While cooking the rice and milk I stirred it constantly, this breaks up the rice and makes it creamier than the recipes that say to bake it in the oven.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg because that's how we like it. Came out creamy and good.

I followed recipe exactly... Sprinkled cinnamon and whipped cream on it before eating of corse! Ha! Delicious! Yep.... I will def make again! Btw.... I mixed the 1 1/2 cup milk, sugar , and salt together while waiting for the rice to cook.... Reading that the sugar can be tricky and staying " hard" I feel this def fixed that issue....

Delicious!  The ratio of milk to rice is perfect.   I used day old Jasmine rice (soft and sticky) and whole milk. Note about the egg: Just don't forget to temper it in...a must for any pudding. ;) You could cut out up to half of the sugar, depending on your taste for sweetness, and it would still be delicious! Just use your judgement. I didn't add raisins this time. It's so versatile you can add whatever you like at the end like spices or additions mixed in (chopped dried apricots, chopped dried mango, golden raisins or whatever dried fruit sounds good to you) or on top (tart cherries mixed with a bit of sugar, crushed nuts, coconut flakes). Or just have it plain as a yummy comfort food.

This was amazing I've made it a couple times now. I made it just the way it says for my first time. After the family ate their bowl I got the feedback. And the second time I made Add a little bit more vanilla and take out the raisins and top each bowl with the fruit of choice. My daughter loved blueberries and wife bananas I enjoyed it it just plain.

This recipe was very good, as it provided that creamy, custard like texture. I also made it with evaporated milk instead of whole milk, I really liked that one the best as far as favor goes.
I also tired it with condensed milk but I found it to be to a little to sweet for my taste, but it also was good flavor wise. Next I will try using a custard to mix in.

REALLY GREAT! This is such an easy to follow recipe! I ended up using jasmine rice because its what I have, but I prefer having some bite left to my rice pudding so that's fine, it still came out plenty creamy. I didn't switch the rice into a new pan because I didn't want to do more dishes, and I waited about 5 minutes after adding the milk to add the sugar/salt mixture. (I also ommitted the raisins, because I dont like them. I'm sure they're delicious in rice pudding but I'll never find out)
I did add cinnamon though. Rice pudding and cinnamon are just so tasty together.

I don't really see how anyone could have difficulties because this recipe is super easy to follow and you have a lot of time while waiting on the rice to cook to get things ready. (I beat the love of Jesus into that egg.) 

For anyone still having trouble with the recipe? Use white rather than brown rice (brown rice is chewy and takes longer to cook) and beat the egg if you dont want eggy bits! It doesn't matter if you just whisk it really well with a fork! Adding the second part of milk just before the egg may help as well? I dont know... I didn't get pieces of egg I don't know how it could happen.

I used Basmati rice and 3/4 of it yield  2 1/2 cup of cooked rice. So I had 1 cup of cooked rice leftover ..
Also, I felt there was too much raisins for my taste. I will use less uncooked rice and raisins if make this recipe again.

Loved it! I made it with Basmati rice (It's what I had) and cooked my rice with a rice cooker and then added the rice to the rest as oer recipe and it was delicious. Exactly what I was hoping for. Well done Erika!

I've never made rice pudding before. This was great! I used less milk in the final round (about 1/4 cup) because it didn't seem quite thick enough (after 20 minutes). Generally loved it! I found the recipe to be a bit sweet. Next time, I will mix brown & white sugar and use a fair amount less. Also, sprinkled with cinnamon afterward. Yum!

I made this for my 87 year old Mother who loves creamy rice pudding with raisins.  Because I was not that concerned about the fat content,  I used heavy whipping cream.  It turned out to be the best rice pudding I've ever tasted

I used long grain rice and doubled the recipe. I cooked one cup of rice with 2 cups water giving me 3 cups of cooked rice. Added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg and used sultana raisins rather than golden, which is what I had on hand. Used vanilla paste for full flavor. Delicious!!

This is exactly how my Mom made it.  Only she used leftover cooked rice from the day or two before.  (Never one to waste anything, we know when there was rice for dinner we know a couple days later we were in for a treat)!!

I LOVE rice pudding, but never tried to fix it myself. But, today I tried this recipe and it was a hit. I do not like raisins,  so I omitted that. But, it was still delicious! But, bc I am not a raisin fan, it did need a fruit of some kind. I added whipped cream and was in heaven. Next time,  I will add strawberries or apples for some added texture,  since raisins aren't my thing.

first time I ever made rice pudding.this recipe was so easy and it turned out AMAZING. the kids said "rice pudding? eewwww!" and then when they tried actually tried it, they were begging for more. i used a rice cooker to make sure i didn't mess the rice up. also, i left out the raisins as i didn't have any on hand, and i topped with brown sugar instead of cinnamon... best rice pudding ive ever eaten.

Very rich, very creamy... could have been a touch sweeter, and next time I will only use half the rice called for. Other than that, it was great!

I have to say, this recipe is really really good!      I made this Rice Pudding for a side dish at Easter .. and Yum!! It was creamy, not too sweet... I didn't change a thing as others may have in some comments. I wanted to do it as the recipe called for.. at least the first time.   Glad I did. This is my "go to" rice pudding recipe from now on. Thank you for sharing it!!

I cooked my rice in the microwave. ( That name brand orange box has a recipe on the side.)  This is the way I always cook rice.
Reduced the amount of cooking milk and saved for later to be mixed with the STRAINED beaten egg and hot pudding.  I quadrupled the recipe and used my deep, square, ceramic lined ban. 

 Made no changes other than to adjust the method.  It came out awesome, no sticky pan, and no scrambled egg in the pudding.   My go-to favorite recipe from now on.

I don't understand the negative reviews... I have never made, nor have I ever been a fan of rice pudding. On a whim this evening I whipped this up for my boyfriend with a few minor changes. 1-I didn't have a full 2 cups of milk, so I topped off with evaporated milk to get the proper measure. 2-I didn't have any golden raisins so I used craisins dried cranberries instead (he loves them!) And finally I didn't have vanilla so I complemented the craisins with just a touch of lemon zest. I used boil in bag plain old white rice and let me tell you, it came out really amazing! It was delish, he loved it, and so did I (and as I'd said, never really been a fan...) I will DEFINITELY use this recipe again!

Excellent. Very creamy. I did substitute the sugar for 1/6 cup of stevia. However, I'd did use whole milk. Delicous. Will become part of my repertoire.

I made this recipe with instant rice. Needed to cook for only 7 min, then drained water and added milk. I used homo milk and followed the rest of the recipe completely. Just like momma used to make. This is a keeper.

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. Very yummy and creamy :) 

Since I mixed my egg/sugar/milk in a metal bowl, I just put it over top the pot that my rice/milk mixture was thickening in, double-broiler style, to heat it up.  Whisked it a little so the egg wouldn't cook, then added it to the pot. 

Seemed a little runny so I added a bit of flour to thicken it up and it ended up being too thick, so probably won't do that next time. 

Overall, really yummy and will make again!

Did not make any major changes, just no raisins because I don't like them. I would not reduce the sugar on this until you've tried it as written, it is  not too sweet for me at all.

Made recipe as written, except used regular raisins instead of golden.  It was good, not great.  Very creamy as promised (I used leftover basmati rice).  My only drawn back is I  thought it a bit too sweet and will make this again but just add less sugar.  I did temper the egg/milk mixture before adding it as others suggested and think that is important to success.

I love this recipe. I did use carnation evaporated milk for the last 1/2 cup to add creaminess. I also mixed that with the beaten egg before adding it. This eleminated the fear of "scrambled eggs" when adding to the hot rice mixture. When added slowly and stirring while adding made sure it blended well. I will make this again for sure.

I didn't measure 'exactly' - I used some left over rice and adjusted the rest of the ingredients accordingly (in an approximately kind of way).  It was absolutely delicious!  Will definitely make this again as I often have left-over rice and love rice pudding :)

Perfect!  Used medium grained rice, because I couldn't find short grained at the market.  Only had skim milk, but it turned out perfectly.  Make sure you temper the egg mixture so that it doesn't scramble when you mix it into the milk mixture.  Also, the rice must be thoroughly cooked before you add it; otherwise, you will end up with chewy pudding.  Will definitely make this again.

We just came back from Mexico, where we enjoyed a wonderful rice pudding that neither of us have had in many years. So of course, we just had to make our own batch. This recipe is, beyond a doubt, the best ever concocted. Only change I made was to use dark raisins, since its what I had on hand. Thank  you!

Very good and simple recipe. I used 2% milk and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon at the end. Took about 30 mins for it to thicken with 2% milk before adding the additional milk and egg. I beat the egg into the remaining 1/2 c milk and added it slowly while stirring entire time to avoid egg clumps.

First time ever making rice pudding and it came out fantastic!! Only things I did differently was use lactose free milk (my daughter is lactose intolerant) and I did not have vanilla extract so I used imitation vanilla instead. Very easy recipe to follow! Can't wait for my husband to get home from work and try it!! Tastes amazing!

This rice pudding was so simple to make. Creamy and tasty!  Try this before you try an oven bake rice pudding recipe. The oven can dry out the texture. I soaked the raisins in a little warm water first to soften. I used long grain rice and it needed a about a half cup more water to simmer in the beginning. Keep your eye on the pot and stir often but once it is done on stove top you won't go back.  Delish !

Fabulous rice pudding recipe! I had leftover cooked Madagascar pink rice and used it. This rice has a soft fluffy texture and a very mild flavor and was perfect for pudding. I left out the raisins since my family does not care for them. I will definitely make this again!

I used coffee cream and margarine instead of milk and butter. Makes  it thicker, creamier...and all around more delicious. EVERYTHING is better with cream!! I also used regular raisins instead of golden. I.LOVED.IT. would DEFINATELY make this again. YUM YUM!!!!

This was really easy and really yummy.
I brought the egg to room temperature by letting it sit in hot tap water for a few minutes before cracking it and adding it to the milk.  I beat the egg in the milk and SLOWLY added that mixture into the creamy rice, while constantly stirring, so that the egg wouldn't cook.
I omitted the raisins as a personal preference,
and sprinkled on some cinnamon sugar instead when serving.  I will definitely make this again!

Quick & easy.  Based on other reviews, I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon when mixing the milk & rice together; and divided the milk into two equal portions instead of the 3:1 ratio given in the recipe.  Even using the full amount of sugar, I didn't find it to be too sweet.  Very creamy without the rice being mushy.  Will definitely make this one again.

Had to use regular raisins, and long grain rice, but followed a suggestion i read here to use only 1 1/2 cups cooked rice as it does end up being more than that from step 1. Also cooked in same pot, unwashed.  Amazing, never need another recipe!

For those of you that are having chewy rice issues, I felt I might add a tip, that I haven't seen in any of the reviews. When you cook your rice, treat it as you would a slow cooker!!! You cannot open the lid to stir it! Rice needs the steam that has built up inside the pot to cook. If you open the lid, you've increased the cooking time, which will result in the "chewy rice" when cooked to the time stated in the recipe. It's a common mistake.

I just finished making it and will make it again. I made it just the way it was described.  I have tasted it warm and think it's a bit sweet so would reduce the sugar quantity.  If you don't use the raisins, it might be okay as that would reduce some of the sweetness.  I cooked it as described but let it sit a few minutes to cool off before I mixed in the milk and eggs which I had combined to prevent possible scrambling.  It is a great basis recipe which can easily be modified as many have written to suit personal taste and memories.

A good comfort food that can easily be made both gluten and dairy free by using coconut milk in place of regular milk and coconut oil in place of butter.  I like to skip the raisins, add 1 tsp of almond extract, and serve with an apricot topping (canned apricots, cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg with corn starch to thicken).

This is amazing! My family goes nuts for it.  One thing the recipe doesn't mention, that I've seen people in the negative reviews having problems with, is you need to temper the eggs or else you get scrambled eggs in your rice.  We make it without raisins and add cinnamon.

Literally just made it. My mom used to make it when I was young and I always loved it but couldn't quite remember how it's been so long. The only thing I added was some cinnamon because I think that was a big part of it from back when I was young. I also didn't end up having enough milk to make the 2 cups but it still turned out amazing. I forgot to mention I didn't put raisens in because I've liked them.

Love this recipe!  Found it by chance while looking for ways to use left over rice. Followed recipe exactly the first time except for ingredients I didn't have, but was still amazing! Used jasmin rice (since it's what we had) and half and half at the end  (since i ran out of milk) and no raisins but lots of extra cinnamon and some nutmeg.
The 2nd time we made it, my daughter requested blueberries and lime...i substituted dried blueberries for the raisins and added the zest of one lime...still used jasmin rice and half and half at the end since it was SO good last time...this 2nd version is a keeper also!

Delicious! Two modifications: read the directions on the back of  rice package, mine said 1 cup of rice to 2 1/2 cups of water, so I followed those directions. Also, I added thd butter to the boiling water. Rice was creamy and sweet. I  made this again for a second time using 5 small pkgs of Splenda, still wonderful.

Phenomenal!!  I made a meringue and folded into the rice pudding when it had cooled.  It was the lightest, fluffiest, creamiest rice pudding!!

Ok, you should try this made with Jasmine rice, coconut milk! Substitute the plane white rice with Jasmine rice and cook with water as per the recipe.  In the second cooking I substituted coconut milk with for1 cup of the milk that the recipe calls for... I used a little less than the recommended sugar, due to the coconut milk, and we were very pleased with the results. Just needed a sprinkle of cinnamon to makeweight

My daughter bought my granddaughter some store bought rice pudding, and it was disgusting.  So, I knew I could probably find a great homemade recipe from Allrecipes, and sure enough I found this one.  Never have I made rice pudding, but I have never eaten rice pudding.  So, I took the advice and used condensed cream, and milk, and I used a little more butter and raisins, I LOVE RAISINS!  OMG, this is the best thing I have eaten!  I will definitely be making this recipe a lot.  If you've never cooked or eaten rice pudding, use this recipe, you will not be disappointed.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I thought the flavors were really good, and the texture would have been amazing had I not under cooked the rice ^.^ I omitted raisins because I dislike their flavor personally. But this was a great rice pudding recipe to try out for a first time.

This recipe is the best for rice pudding.  My family loves it. I did use coconut milk in place of the water like another reviewer and I love the golden raisins. When I plated it , i put a little bit of toasted shredded coconut on top.

I've made this a couple times with great success. I've just tried it with coconut milk and will likely keep that substitution in the future. I can't wait to try different rices other than basmati.

We forgot the butter, which is unbelievable, because we are butter nuts. This was an extra credit project for my son. We added some lemon zest, and my secret ingredient (nutmeg).  I had never had rice pudding with lemon zest. It was fabulous! We are expecting some major extra credit points for this!!

Made this a few times and I gave it a 5 as the recipe is written. 

However I have tried several things from the recipe that I personally like or can suggest.  Made this with Arborio, Jasmine and a generic bag of medium grain rice = The medium grain rice worked best in my opinion. 

I made it with egg and without the egg. I love custard so I thought I would like the egg version better =  I like the no egg better. It had a lighter taste and I liked the brighter white look of it too. 

Technique = If I was wanting to serve rice and it not be sticky and see and move individual grains,  I would wash and drain, plus I would not stir it. But for this I want the opposite. I want the more starch so I stirred, I didn't leave it alone. I would have to adjust my technique for the Arborio because it got to thick on me, but it tasted good. 

I also tried it plain (without raisins), with raisins and with dried cranberries. I also made a cranberry sauce that I put a dab on.

Nothing is better then warm rice pudding on a cold winter night.  I had a lot of half and half that I wanted to use, so substituted that for the milk.  Only added 1/4 C sugar and fewer raisins since I don't care for overly sweet deserts. It turned out perfectly!

This was so easy and so yummy.  I had about 5 cups of left over rice so it was more than double the amounts.  I added 3 eggs and basically trippled everything.  It came out perfect, I'm just hoping that it will keep for Christmas, that's as long as I can keep my husband out of it. This is definately a keeper ...

Made with brown rice.  It took longer to thicken then written, but still very good.  Even my picky daughter liked it.
Added a shake of nutmeg and cinnamon on top and used a little half and half because I had it on hand.

Really good stuff. Modification #1: 3/4 cup of  uncooked white rice ended up yielding 3 cups of cooked--not 1-1/2. So I ran with it and doubled the rest of the recipe. Modification #2: Didn't seem to thicken enough and I didn't have any pure cornstarch on hand, so I added a tablespoon of confectioner's sugar down the stretch. Totally did the trick. Yum.

Wonderful recipe! It was a hit at Sunday dinner. The only things I did differently were that:
a.) I salted and buttered my rice in step 1
b.) Used whole milk instead of water to cook rice with
c.) I beat my egg, 1/2 c. milk, and 1/3 c. sugar together and added it at the end (instead of adding sugar earlier on)
Results were wonderful! Thanks for sharing!

Mix the egg in i/2 cup milk and let it get to room temp while doing pudding and even cooking rice [ always use room temperature milk or eggs etc. for baking I prefer less sweet, a 1/4 cup sugar. I used a few raisins and did not like them.  I think they need to be soaked in hot water and drained to remove some the off flavor.and make them softer.                       I cooked brown rice in a pressure cooker  and used the leftover rice, it was not chewy.  I think next time I will use only 2% milk and not any canned milk. I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/8 tsp. nutmeg, sprinkle of ginger, allspice and cloves plus more vanilla. pretty good.  I will try again with white rice, no raisins or canned / evaporated milk.

I only had short grain brown rice (NOT instant), so I used that and therefore changed the sugar to brown sugar.  Followed the recipe and it came out really good.

I LOVE rice pudding- I used Minute Rice and the consistency was fine, and we tasted it and it was unbelievable!!  But when it sat it kept getting sweeter- and it was entirely too sweet for me to eat. I used organic jumbo raisins and am wondering if that wasn't helping with the sweetness.

The recipe is very simple. I would definitely make sure the rice is fully cooked before adding sugar, and waiting a bit longer doesn't affect flavor at all since sugar absorbs quickly. I used dark raisins because that's what we buy normally, and they were still delicious. I think the butter and beaten egg really make this recipe work.

I made a few adjustments to the recipe to accommodate the ingredients and leftovers I had on hand.  I had about 8 cups of leftover long grain rice with sliced almonds and craisins in it, so I used that and kept most of the proportions from the original recipie, modifying it slightly.  Used 2 cups of sugar and substituted half the milk with heavy whipping cream.  It came out AMAZING! I also added additional vanilla (proportional to recipe), but omitted the salt because I used salted butter.

TIP: For the addition of the egg, beat the egg with the remaining 1/2 Cup milk in a small bowl. Add a spoonful of the hot milk and rice mixture to the cold milk and egg and beat. Repeat this a few times until the milk and egg mixture is warm, then add to the milk and rice. This is called "tempering" and will prevent the egg from cooking immediately and giving you lumps of hard-boiled egg in your pudding. I also added the raisins first to decrease the temperature of the milk and rice mixture before adding the egg and milk. I'm not fond of vanilla so left it out and was still pleased with the result.

Wow! Thanks to this great recipe and the wonderful person that shared it, I just made rice pudding at home for the first time. It turned out absolutely delicious and I will definitely be making it again. I followed the advice of a few others and put the butter in while the rice was cooking in the first step. I only used half the sugar. That is a personal thing though. I filled my 1/3 cup measuring spoon and first added only roughly half the sugar. Glad I stopped there because that was perfect for my taste. I also added the hot rice and milk into the eggs first and it worked perfectly, nothing swirled. Finally, I cooked the last 2 minutes with the vanilla instead of adding it at the end. This was such a great treat! Thank you for sharing :)

I have made this recipe twice now using brown rice and almond milk  and it turned out great. The second time I cut the sugar in half as I used vanilla flavoured almond milk. I heat the milk and sugar while the rice is cooking and temper the eggs and vanilla with the warm milk. Cook slowly and stir frequently and you will get a very creamy pudding. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this tonight for Thanksgiving dessert.  To make it festive I used eggnog in place of milk for most of it.  The last half cup I used milk.  Added about a quarter cup of cinnamon sugar and a couple of sprinkles of nutmeg.  Used dried cranberries instead of raisins.   It came out very good.

I have made this recipe twice.  The first time I made it exactly as the diections said and my husband loved it.  He needs more protein and calories so the second time I substituted 1 cup unsweetened milk.  When you do this you don't need to add any sugar.

Great recipe to use up leftover rice.   I had 2 cups of cooked long grain Jasmine rice which worked great. I also had half and half which needed to be used soon.  I think the added cream made up for the long grain.  I couldn't find my vanilla so I used almond extract and no raisins but I had dried cherries.  The almond/cherry combo was great!  I'm sure the vanilla/raisin version will be wonderful!  Also, my grandsons can't have dairy so Almond milk should be lucious also. Even with out the butter...

Have now made this twice and it is a huge family hit.  It is wonderful comfort food, and we've enjoyed it both warm and cold. 
Didn't have any raisins on hand, so we used shredded coconut instead — only 1/3 of a cup instead of 2/3 though because it was pre-sweetened coconut. We used leftover rice from our rice cooker so timing the addition of the sugar was not an issue.

Love this recipe!I have made it a few times using the short grain rice.It is a simple recipe with fantastic results.I adore rice pudding and have never been able to get the creaminess that this recipe achieves.The only thing I did differently was add a little cinnamon about 1/2 of a teaspoon and an extra tablespoon of butter.No need to search for another rice pudding recipe..This ones a keeper!!

I made this pudding with left over Jasmine short grain rice. It has a lovely fragrance. I used 2% milk and added the 1/3 cup sugar at the start. Added the cinnamon and nutmeg to the milk  plus 3 whole cardamon seeds (removed before serving).   I stirred the mixture frequently over a low - medium heat until thickened and creamy. Softened 1/2 cup of craisins in warm water, before adding to the mixture.  Also added 1/2 cup of the slightly cooled mixture to 1/2 cup of Fat Free half & half, for a richer taste and the beaten egg. ( to keep from curdling).   Returned this to the main pot and continued to cook for about 5 minutes. the texture was perfect and the Cherry flavored craisins were a nice change to raisins. Served in individual custard cups with a pinch of nutmeg and garnished with sliced almonds.

So very delicious! I've made this recipe several times, and each time it has been so yummy. I have never put raisins in, as I am not a big raisin fan. On one occasion, I substituted whipping cream for the milk (I needed to use it up, as it was about to expire), and it still turned out great - just creamier and more heavenly (and of course, probably a lot more fattening)! ;-)

This is a little too milky for my taste. I like more rice in my rice pudding. I think next time I will do 1-1/2 cups of milk instead of 2 cups total. I did what the other reviews said and added about 3 spoonfuls of the hot  rice and milk mixture to my beaten egg and half cup of milk before adding it to the pot. I made sure it was lukewarm before adding and stirred the rice pudding for 2 minutes like the directions said  but I till have some cooked egg white in my pudding which isn't a huge deal. However, next time I think I'll use use the egg yoke to eliminate that problem. I cooked the rice with the tbsp of butter so I didn't add it again at the end. I topped if off with cinnamon. It has a nice, light flavor. Might try a little more butter and/or sugar next time.

Great recipe.  Make sure to use arborio or short/medium grain white rice.  I also would suggest whole milk.  I've made it with sugar and splenda and both turned out great.  Would suggest upping the sugar content to 1/2 cup though.

Great recipe. I decided to use half-and-half in place of the milk, and the creaminess was off the charts. I also like it sweeter, so I used more sugar (and I used brown sugar). But, as-is, it's still a great recipe.

Best rice pudding I've ever made! My former boss absolutely loves rice pudding so I'm always on the lookout for a good recipe. I was taking him and his wife rice pudding today so decided to make this recipe. It truly is the best I've made - and I've made a lot using lots of different recipes! It was so creamy but so very easy to make. I used whole milk to make it richer than skim. Also, I put the salt in the boiling water as I made the rice. After the rice was made, I just continued in the same pot and added the butter so it melted into the rice, then sprinkled on the sugar so it would be sure and melt. The only other thing I did different than the recipe was I tempered the egg by whisking it into the 1/2 c milk and then adding some of the warm rice/milk mixture into the egg/milk mixture before stirring the egg/milk into the rest of the rice and milk. That ensured that I wouldn't get lumpy cooked egg. Finally, after it was done and I poured the finished rice pudding into a dish, I sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg on top. Incredibly delicious! In fact, after taking it to my friends, I had to also make a new batch today for my husband and me! Thanks Erica for sharing this! (P.S. after making this for us I realized it wasn't sweet enough so I added another 1/3 c of sugar. That made it much better!)

I have been making rice pudding for years and this is absolutely the creamiest ever !  I will end my search.  Be sure to add some of the hot mixture into the beaten egg before you pour it in and when you do pour it stir a lot so it doesn't cook.  My family doesn't like raisins so I made it plain.  It is like a soft custard. It was important that I cook the rice correctly that first 20 minutes or it would not be the softness it should be.  Enjoy !!!

It was very good and easy to make. I only had long grain rice in and I cooked it kinda long so it came out very thick. I am trying again with long grain because that's all I have in right now, I am going to cook it for less time so hopefully it will be creamier this time.

Very tasty, and good consistency.

I made my rice in a rice cooker with Japanese short-grain rice. I didn't use raisins because I don't care of them, and didn't miss them in this dish!

Next time I might leave out the butter to reduce calories a bit because I tasted the dish before putting it in and it was still delicious.

Really great pudding! I would recommend using short grain rice; I used long grain but it was still so super tasty. I also reduced the sugar by quite a bit, and I liked it a lot - but then again I usually prefer less sugar in general! Great recipe.

I just made this rice  pudding and it came out very well. I used 3 tablespoons of honey instead of sugar and added generous amounts of vanilla and cinnamon because I love them both. Very rich and creamy; I will definitely make this again.

I made it with leftover rice and craisins (dried cranberries) that I added to the rice, milk and sugar at the start.  Added some cinnamon at the end.  Very tasty. The craisins held together throughout the cooking. The rice was long grain white rice. Still turned out great - likely not as creamy as short or medium grain rice would have been.

I really loved this rice pudding!!  I've never made rice pudding before, so I can only compare it to the glop I buy at the grocery store, which I thought was good until today!!  I made the recipe the way it was written, and it was just fantastic, warm, sweet comfort food.  My husband is going to love this as well, thank you!
(For some other reviewers -- If you make this recipe with the wrong type of rice, and dump cold egg into hot pudding, well...  not quite sure how you can give the recipe a low score, really??!! -- Do ya think it was something maybe other than the recipe???!!  Makes me crazy...)

Just made this rice pudding for my husband who had oral surgery. Boy was it a hit! Followed the recipe. The only alteration was I used half fat free milk and half and half cream. Didn't use raisins. Instead topped with amaretto........ Creamy and delicious!

My whole family loved this.  I had a bunch of those containers of rice from Chinese take out.  So I figured I would give this recipe a shot.  Made as the recipe as suggested.  Except I used a little less sugar and a dash of vanilla caramel coffee creamer.  I now will never throw away that left over rice again

Pretty good.

Quick tip. For a portuguese version,Add a lemon peel and cinnamon stick to the milk and rice to perfume it. When done,remove the peel and stick

Wonderful! Super creamy and delicious. Cut back on sugar slightly and it was still superb. Comforting bowl of goodness.

This was a great base recipe. Of course I added my own personal touches. I mixed coconut cream with my milk, then blended the eggs before mixing with the warm rice (to be sure i didnt cook the eggs). I also mixed in cinnamon, then topped with some toasted coconut flakes.  DELISH!!! Will surely make this my "go to" rice pudding recipe!! Thanks for sharing!

Good & creamy. I mixed the beaten egg in with the last cup of milk before adding to pudding.  Tried with cinnamon sprinkled on top, for my taste rather have it mixed in. Will try it next time.

I used Arborio rice b/c I had some I wanted to use up.  Fantastic!  Creamy and delicious, perfect rice pudding.  I did not add the raisins, we don't care for them in pudding; and I used only 1/4 cup of sugar and it was perfectly sweet for us.  I also used vanilla bean paste instead of vanilla extract.  This is now my only rice pudding recipe.

I did make the recipe without raisins, it still turned out great. The one thing is you should put in the recipe that before you put the egg in you should let the mixture cool down so it doesn't cook the egg. Other then that it turned out great!!

I invited a bunch of friends over so we could make rice putting together. Well guess what! None of them ate it because they thought it was disgusting. It was too sweet and eggy, and just overall really gross and unappealing so I would recommend NOT making this recipe. Don't invite your friends over if you choose to  make this rice pudding, or they will not like you anymore. Just saying.

I made this with long grain rice.  I liked the fact that it was quick and easy, since it's too hot to turn the oven on, but it was lacking a few key items.  I love rice pudding, but two of the best parts are the custard part and the spice.  It definitely didn't have much custard to it and no cinnamon whatsoever.  When it was done cooking, I just added some cinnamon and nutmeg to give it that "old fashioned" rice pudding flavor.  I'd make it again if I was craving a quick rice pudding, but my husband wouldn't touch it.

I would make this again. I think it's a bit thin for my liking, but perhaps it will firm up more as it cools.  I added a little cinnamon on top of each individual serving.

This was really good and easy to make. I had left over rice and followed the last step and it was delicious. Of course I'm the only one who eats rice pudding so let's just say...it was all mine! I've made it 3 times so far. added cinnamon also 
First rating I've given.

This recipe isn't good for long grain rice and it is pretty bland. It took 30 minutes to get it thick enough and dried cherries is the only thing that saved it. I used corn starch instead of eggs and coconut milk to veganized it. It has potential but it definitely needs some work.

Very good pudding!  I steamed my rice ahead of time in the steamer because it always comes out perfect in the steamer - for me at least.  Added to the milk, followed suggestions on adding the egg and it came out thick and creamy and delicious.  Thanks for this recipe.  It's a keeper!

Very easy to do. Actually used dark brown sugar and added apple pie spice (to taste). Also replaced the milk with a combination of half and half and the resulting "buttermilk" from the homemade butter (which I used for the butter) I made a couple of weeks ago.

Mine came out ok and I very carefully followed the instructions (used medium grain white rice) but it was not at all creamy like you get in a restaurant.  Very thick.  Have no idea why.  I did use skim milk so don't know if that caused it.

I love this recipe! I cannot go to a family event without bringing a vat of this with me, or I will be sent away! I sometimes add a little cinnamon to make things interesting.
I also like to soak my raisins in rum overnight, it adds richness to the flavor

This was good! I ended up using uncooked kasmati rice so that prep was slightly different (soaking rice for 20m) but proportions were the same. I also used dried baobab fruit bites rather than raisins, and Earth Balance vegan soy-free butter. Turned out yummy! :-)

The egg! Omg. I tasted it before the egg, it was good... I added the egg and it was amazing. This was my first attempt at rice pudding and I pleased my husband. The key I'd say is making sure the egg is very well beaten before it goes in and stirring the pudding very quick and constant after it goes in ensuring to break up any places you see cooked egg clumps, before they cook all the way through.

I made this tonight...so easy! Everyone's different right to give it their own touch. Here's what I did:
I used the same saucepan instead of 2.
When I added the milk, I kept the heat on simmer and let it heat slowly and added 3 pieces of lemon peel.
I didn't put egg or raisins either.
I used jasmine rice,
turned out yum.
The tip I reckon is not to boil the milk and not to stir too much. This way it won't stick or turn out a gluggy mess. I didn't use a non-stick pan and the rice didn't stick.
I have never roasted peaches before but had a couple so halved them, sprinkle with sugar or honey (whatever you like) and roasted them to have with the rice pudding.

This was excellent! I added extra golden raisins, and I tempered the eggs before adding them in to make sure I didn't wind up with scrambled eggs in the rice. The best part is that I just happened to have all the ingredients already, so I didn't have to plan ahead or go on a shopping trip to make it.

Great recipe. I upped the quantity to feed 40, and I omitted the egg because of their dietary restrictions, and it still turned out delicious - creamy and comforting. Will definitely make this again.

A really great recipe. I had no problems except for the pudding browning a bit, but make sure to keep a close eye on the pudding and stir the mixture once in a while to prevent burning. First batch I made was a success. Some tips if you are making it the first time. First I would wash the rice with cold water in a strainer before adding in the pot of boiling water.  Sometimes the rice isn't as clean as you might think. Second, make sure to constantly stir as you add in the egg gradually. This will prevent the egg from cooking completely which could leave white strings. And finally, make sure to taste test the pudding first with the 1/3 cup of sugar and if you don't  find it sweet enough for your liking, add some more gradually.

Although this came together nicely & the consistency was good, I found this recipe to be way too sweet. I will make again but with less than half of the sugar.

My mom used to make rice pudding any time we had leftover rice. I was looking at the bowl of leftover cooked rice in my fridge (calrose in this case), and decided that I was going to keep the tradition alive. Sadly, my kids didn't really even know what rice pudding was, but they do now! And they loved it, as did hubby and I.
I followed the recipe exacly, except I only had a small handful of raisins, and they were not the golden variety. I had no problems with the recipe, and it turned out perfectly. I already added this recipe to my favorites, and will definitely make it again. Thank you!

I am a self proclaimed disaster in the kitchen. I overcooked a ton of rice the other day and had to find something to do with it. Frying it went badly. So I made this rice pudding and it went fabulously. The rice was long grain but it still ended up deliciously creamy and I used half skim milk and half "half and half" for the 2 cups of milk. I am so pleased.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My wife loves rice pudding so I made this for her for a treat. She absolutely loved it! Since I am diabetic I substituted Splenda for to make it slightly better for me and it worked great.

Yes, I used 3 tablespoons of Truvia Baking Blend instead of sugar and eliminated the raisins. First rice pudding recipe I have tried that was delicious. I used success rice packet and cooked in four cups of water in my rice cooker . It was delicious and not too sweet like other recipes I have tried.

Very good recipe. I didn't have any vanilla, and it was still delicious.

The most helpful critical review says they had lumps of egg form when they made it, but I've made it three times and that hasn't happened once. Obviously they either added the egg too quickly or didn't stir continuously for the last two minutes.

I do love this recipe. 

My suggestions: if using long grain rice more milk will be needed to achieve a creamier texture for the first addition of milk and for the second addition. I keep an extra cup/cup and half of milk handy. 

Second, the problem with finding egg bits can be corrected by lowering the temperature before adding the egg and milk. The rice before the egg addition should be at a medium/medium setting and simmering with a lot of small bubbles bursting relatively fast in it.  

Now, before adding the egg, the rice pudding should be at the highest of low settings and have only a few bubbles bursting. That means it has sit a little while until it cools to that temperature. Once it gets to that point, add the egg and milk stirring constantly and rapidly to avoid egg bits (maybe 5 minutes).   Pudding will have a uniform yellowy color.  

After about 5 minutes or so, bring the pudding back to a medium/medium heat.  Once at temperature, cook for two minutes then remove from heat promptly after. 

Add the butter and the vanilla.  

Cool for at least 3 hours if you like it uniforml

Excellent, my grandmother  made a rice pudding in a double boiler, I lost the recipe a while back, it was the best ever! But this is really good and easy to prepare! Hope this  help some folks with this recipe, never stir rice when simmering it causes more starch and makes rice sticky.

I used short grain sweet rice,  1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1 1/2 cups of milk, and a generous dash of  cinnamon. I didn't add raisins. By far, the best rice pudding I've ever made, and the easiest, too.

I've made this recipe countless number of times.  My kids beg for it.  To be clear, cook the rice first, then do the rest of the recipe.  I cook the rice, then make it in the same pan I just cooked the rice in.  I've found the key for me is to cook the rice, milk, sugar, salt mixture long enough to get it creamy.  I cook it until I think it's creamy, then I cook it 5 or so minutes more.  If I don't, it doesn't turn out as good.  Once the rice, milk, sugar, salt are cooking, I beat the egg and add it to the remaining milk.  When the rice is creamy, I temper the milk egg mixture and add it to the pot.  Delicious!

Delicious. Oh man, so delicious. I made this because my husband put too much water in the rice cooker and the rice was near mush, but I didn't want to waste it all. Other than my using mushy rice, I didn't change a thing. This was absolutely perfect! It's chilling in the fridge right now just waiting to be topped with whipped cream and devoured as a midnight snack ;)

Used half&half instead of milk, plus a packet of Carnation Breakfast Essentials (Vanilla), no butter, and used half regular sugar / half brown sugar.  And a "little bit" extra vanilla extract.  
and cooked it longer than indicated on low.

So yummy and beats kozy shack for sure. I used left over take out rice.    I did not add raisins (hate them) added a bit of cinnamon.  I also used techniques that others had recommended. Added sugar after milk and rice cooked down and added a bit of the rice/milk mixture to the egg before adding the egg to the pudding.

The rice pudding taste good but it did not thicken up in the saucepan like the recipe said it would. It ended up thickening up after about 2 days and my refrigerator. And then it tastes really good.
You want to make sure you put the EXACT amount of vanilla extract in there! I put just a tad too much and I had no way of getting it out! You sure could taste it but believe me. It was good enough to eat though!
Before I make rice pudding again I'll compare the cooking time in the saucepans of other recipes!

Such a quick and tasty dessert. I'd never made rice pudding and my son asked for some. We looked online, found this recipe and within an hour we were eating our first bowl of rice pudding. We used brown raisins which was fine. Only had long grain rice, I tried to smash down while cooking with milk. Topped with sprinkle of cinnamon. Delicious! Thank you.

Pretty good. I realized halfway through that most of these ingredients used are what goes into oatmeal. I'm not sure if anyone else feels the same way, but for me it tastes very similar to that. Everyone has different tastes, though. Also, make sure that there's enough liquid left in it when you place the egg in that it doesn't scramble, haha.

Excellent! My whole family loved it! Probably the best one we've made and we have been making rice pudding for years! We live in Africa, where milk is a bit gamier than the States', but it added a cool dimension! Our local shop owner didn't have raisins, so we didn't put them in. No doubt it would be even better with them!

I've made this recipe 3 times before. In the second part of the recipe it doesn't specify, but I simmered the rice and milk uncovered. I felt like 1/3 of a cup sugar would be way too sweet, so I eyeballed it by pouring some into my hand and it was great.

I tried this recipe to use up left over rice, and it was delicious! The only thing I'd change about the directions is, you have to temper your egg before adding it to the hot liquid. For those who may not know, tempering is when you ladle some of the hot liquid into the beaten egg to warm the egg up. Whisk constantly and add the liquid slowly. This will prevent you from ending up with scrambled egg bits in your pudding.

Now I purposely make extra rice, just so I can make this desert. Its rich, creamy, and delicious. Its best eaten warm, but you can eat it cold too.

came out perfect first try. And to anyone that had problems…read the darn instructions. COOK the rice first. and BEAT the egg first. then add it. Also, I would use 1/4cup of sugar, I think it was a little too sweet. 1/3cup is a lot of sugar for how many servings it makes. I also sprinkled some cinnamon over the top before serving.

I didn't quite follow the recipe, I had about 3 cups of cooked rice in the fridge that I thought I'd get to for dinners this week and just wasn't feeling it. I used medium grain white sticky rice, about 2 cups of milk in the sauce pan and then beat the egg with the butter and vanilla adding in cinnamon and nutmeg instead of raisins. I let the rice sit in the milk for a bit before putting it on the heat and adding the sugar and once it was creamy turned the heat down and then added my egg mix.

I prefer rice pudding to be warm and can say I enjoyed it, but it's not living up to Swedish tradition with almonds that my aunt makes. So, next time I'll be adding some shredded ones in.

Very simple and delicious use for leftover rice. Mom kept saying it takes her back to her childhood. As another reviewer mentioned...temper the egg with the hot milk/rice mix before adding so you don't end up with egg drop pudding.

I had some leftover rice from dinner and decided to make this. I skipped adding the milk at the end because I was afraid it would be to liquidy. It was great! I saved this one to use whenever I have extra rice.

Delicious.  I used long grain white rice and cooked it a bit longer to get to the creamy stage.  We have ris ala mande every Christmas Eve in the Danish tradition.  Whip cream and fold it into this cooled rice dessert for ssentially the same dessert.

I gave this recipe 5 stars due to the ease of making it and the creamy texture of the pudding.  It is great to whip up for someone recovering from an illness or needing to eat soft and somewhat bland foods.  I have made it twice, think I cut the sugar a bit the first time around and would recommend doing that, as the full amount yields a pretty sweet rice pudding!  Don't leave out the raisins, they add a nice chewy texture to this smooth & creamy dessert!

I also struggled to have the milk turn thick and creamy. Maybe this is a good recipe and I'm just too much of a novice, but it certainly isn't great for beginners! Such a shame really, great idea - it'd just be great if it was more descriptive/accessible to humble first-timers like me!

The texture of the rice pudding was really nice. I think recipe calls for a little too much sugar. The combination of the pudding with the raisins was a little bit too much. My family enjoyed. I'll make it again, but will just reduce the sugar .

Easy to make and delicious. You don't need a second pot, just use the same one you cooked the rice in. One less thing to clean.

Easy and creamy, even if using long grain rice which is my preference.  Also easily doubled.
Reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup for a less sugary pudding or use brown sugar instead.  I add cinnamon and nutmeg with the milk to give it that old fashioned flavour.

I left out the raisins, personal preference.  While the rice was cooking mixed the milk and sugar, microwaved 1 minute to aid dissolving the sugar and added 1/2 teaspoon each of nutmeg and cinnamon.   The egg and milk were mixed in a blender.
I saw no reason for transferring the rice to a different sauce pan so I simply added the milk/sugar to the rice and proceeded following the recipe.  
Simple, easy, tasty, I'll never buy rice pudding again.

This rice pudding was very good! However, it definitely needs more sugar, vanilla and a longer cooking time for it to thicken up. Add another 1/4 c sugar and 1/4 tsp vanilla, and I will certainly make this recipe again!

I used long-grain white rice, which I might've overcooked. In any case, it resulted in a nutty texture I liked more than not. Very flavorful.

Super creamy. Doubled the recipe and  the whole family loved it. We used regular raisins instead of golden as they were already on hand. Next time we'll get the golden.

Just made this with long grain rice.  I added sugar in 2 minutes before 2nd quantity of milk and egg. It worked out better than what I usually do which is add the sugar earlier. I'm eating a bowl as I type! Great recipe! Can't wait to serve it to my 3 yo and 1 yo!

So delish!  i made it using basmati rice and pure cane raw sugar and it turned out great. I beat the raw egg and the 1/2 cup milk together, then added a small amount of the hot liquid to the milk/egg mixture. Very gradually, I then poured the milk/egg mixture into the hot milk/rice mixture stirring constantly. I will be making this often!

I only had one cup of cooked rice left over from dinner; and I only had cream I did not have milk.  So I added some cream to a measuring cup approx 1/4 cup and then added 3/4 cup of water.  This recipe is very good and I would definitely make it again!

Excellent!
I've never made a rice pudding like this before, I've always made a baked pudding.
And using brown rice instead of white will be healthier but brown rice doesn't have the starch required to soften  during cooking and thicken liquid, so if you use it, it will be chewy.

Love this recipe.  It's a simple old-fashioned rice pudding.  If I'm making it for company, I use cream instead of the final milk portion and grate fresh nutmeg on top.  For a family dessert, I make it with low fat milk.  Always yummy.

This recipe is sooo easy! I actually had used rice that was leftover from my dinner last night which made it that much easier. Also it taste amazing for how simple it was. I will definitely be saving this recipe to make very often because I'm addicted to rice pudding and normally but it from the store pre-made. This is by far one of my favorites!!

Followed the directions almost exact, I added a bit extra vanilla. YUM! Next time I will cook the rice with a bit more water to avoid it sticking to the pan.

It really is creamy. Can't wait to try it cooled off. So far it's excellent right out of the pot. Only thing I added was a good amount of cinnamon & I was all out of raisins =[

This came out super thick for me. I followed the directions almost exactly. On the amount of time to boil over medium heat, I just cooked it until the consistency i wanted and then added the rest of the milk and egg mixture. This stuff is the ultimate comfort food.

I can't believe I haven't rated this recipe yet! I've been making it for years. It is excellent. I've only found one recipe that is better, but it uses heavy cream and you cook the rice in it. I usually make rice pudding when we have leftover rice from a Thai restaurant that I just do not want to waste. I love that I can pick this recipe up at step two with the already cooked rice. The short, sticky rice from the restaurant is so perfect in this because of all the starch in it which really makes a creamy pudding. I noticed some reviewers had a hard time getting theirs to thicken up- it may be that the type of rice they use does not have enough starch. I make it as directed, often using part half and half (my doctor told me to put on some weight). It is a wonderful comfort food when you are not feeling well and it goes down so easily, providing protein, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and iron. I have shared this with people who do not think they care for rice pudding and they always love it. I think it is perfect as is. I usually put cinnamon on my rice pudding, but this one's simple taste is delicious and let's the rice shine through, so I often eat it plain. Great fro breakfast, and can easily be made ahead, providing several breakfasts. I love this cold. Thank you!

This recipe was wonderful! I added a little cinnamon mixed in at the end and some more on top. It was so easy to make and very creamy!  You will make more rice than you use in the recipe. If you throw it all in like I did the first time, the result will be too thick.

I made this recipe as written with medium grain rice and 1% milk but only 1/4 cup of sugar (because that's all I had on hand). I topped it with cinnamon when I served myself but my husband preferred it without trying the cinnamon. This was FANTASTIC! I haven't had rice pudding since my mother passed away almost 15 years ago. I didn't think I'd ever be able to make her recipe. This isn't her recipe - it's better (RIP, Mom). Next time I will try with Craisins at hubby's request. This is a keeper. BTW, I think there was enough sugar for our liking. 1/3 cup would have been too much.

This was a WONDERFUL recipe and it works perfectly, of course I added another tablespoon of butter!  Now, I do have to agree with someone who wrote to make sure your rice is tender - it makes a world of difference before you add your SUGAR! This is heavenly and was such a piece of cake to make.   I wish I could take a picture of it and show you - but unfortunately, it is all gone.  Oh well, time to make another batch!

Thank You!

It was really good, but the raisins need added sooner so they can have a chance to plump up. I also added cinnamon with the butter and vanilla.

I pretty much followed the recipe as written I did use short grain rice, used 1% milk and I soaked the raisins in a bit of dark rum before adding.  Very good results and I will make again.  Thanks.
UPDATE:  After the pudding sat for a while, it thickened up considerably.  Next time I will use less rice or more milk.  Otherwise it tasted great. SECOND UPDATE :  I cooked the rice in my rice cooker then made this again with more milk (I also added the leftover rum from the raisins) and, once again success!  Love this recipe - not bland at all.

This is a easy and delicious recipe. I did alter mine a bit the second time I made it. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar (I like it a little sweeter than original recipe) a teaspoon of cinnamon on the second cook time, and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. I also used one cup or half and half and one cup of whole milk. It's rice pudding.. It's not supposed to be healthy ??

Was soooo delicious! I loved it! 
The only thing I changed was I didn't use a different pan and I didn't add raisins, though even with these changes everything turned  out perfectly

I used Market Pantry Cinnamon-Vanilla Holiday Milk in place of the regular milk, cinnamon and vanilla.  It was perfectly delicious.  I served it with fresh raspberries coated with 10x (confectioners) sugar.  The combination of tart and sweet was excellent!  Also, don't hesitate to use Minute Rice if your short on time.  Just follow the directions on the package for the rice and then proceed with this recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe, and I've made it several times. Recently I've been using cooked brown rive, cutting back on the sugar and salt added and using two eggs instead of one; it makes for a hearty and mostly healthy breakfast!

I made a couple of changes. I added nutmeg to the mixture and had run out of raisins, so I used cranberries, ( dried).
Came out awesome. I also used a cup and a half of rice that I had cooked the night before. Will make this again.

We used part milk and part half n half for this recipe. I would make it again. Jackie commented that the egg cooked but if you waited to add part of the milk at  the same time you  slowly stir in egg, it should not scramble.  Also, you could temper the egg by adding just a bit of the warm liquid to the egg before adding to pudding.

Very delicious and creamy.  Added the cold milk at end as instructed and this helped temper the egg.  Let egg sit in cold milk for about 30 seconds before stirring into hot pudding and egg will not cook.  Omitted raisins, don't care for them.  Only recipe better than this is my mom's.  Will make again.  Liked the small batch as well.  Only me and I don't need a big portion.

I made this with several day old leftover brown rice and it was still very good and creamy! A testament to the recipe. I would however scale back the sugar to at least 1/4 cup, but of course there's no accounting for everyone's taste.

My first attempt at rice pudding and it was a success.  I will be making this a lot!  My 18 year old daughter raved about it.  

I boiled short grain rice in the water with the salt, butter, and sugar so I didn't need to add these later.

I made everything in one pot.  I tempered the egg and remaining milk before adding it.  Because I love vanilla and cinnamon, I added 1 tsp of vanilla and generous sprinkles of nutmeg and cinnamon.

Delicious!

Lovely, creamy and sweet enough - but not too sweet.  I did not add the raisins.  To solve the egg curdling, I tempered the egg-milk mix at the end with some of the hot creamy rice mixture before mixing it all in.   It was delicious.

The rice and milk mixture was still liquid-y after 20 minutes (step 2). I added 1/2 t cinnamon, but did not add the egg mixture for fear it would become too soupy. It thickened up nicely on its own. Would definitely make again.

I make this recipe frequently , as it is a family favorite, especially of my elderly father, whom I love to spoil. He pronounced it even better than his mother's, which is unheard of.
So easy to make and always turns out perfectly. I add my craisins at the beginning of cooking the pudding, along with vanilla beans, freshly grated nutmeg , and cinnamon. I've also made it with sushi rice or leftover rice from ordering Chinese food.
One comment I would like to make is that I feel the top negative review should be removed as it is not a valid comment, but an error on the part of the cook.. Bon Appetite lists substituting brown rice for white as #2 in it's article " The 6 Most Common Mistakes in Making Rice" You have to add more water( 1/4 - 1/2 cup per cup of rice) , so of course the recipe will not turn out! Thoroughly beating the egg into the remaining milk while you cook the rice will bring the eggs to room temperature and avoid any clumps of cooked egg in the final product.  Recipe doubles well. Great  recipe! Thank you!

I made this rice pudding yesterday (with Jasmine rice) and one thing that I noticed was different than what the recipe states is that after adding the milk to the rice, it only took 8 minutes for my rice pudding to gain the thickness/consistency I wanted. I thought it was strange that the directions say 15-20 minutes so I let it cook for 2 more minutes but at that point it started losing it's creaminess so I decided to go to the next part of the directions.
Also, I substituted brown sugar for white sugar, added cinnamon at the end and also added dried cranberries to it at the same time as the raisins. It turned out amazing!
Overall a great recipe!

This is the first Rice Pudding recipe I have ever tried. For some reason as much as I cook and bake I have never made Rice Pudding and I love it. It came out really good using Arborio Rice. I made the recipe as written but after I made it and re-read the reviews I realized I did not temper the egg but I also didn't see any problem with the pudding so I guess I lucked out this time. Will have to make a notation on the recipe for the future to temper it. I am definitely going to be using this recipe in the future again and again.

I used minute rice and a quarter cup of sugar.  I also sprinkled in some cinnamon and fresh grated nutmeg.  So creamy and yummy!  I think even less sugar could be added.  I will definitely be making this again.  Reminds me of my grandma's rice pudding!!

This is great when you use the left over white rice from Chinese take out that gets dried out in the fridge the next day. I also add a table spoon of my favorite flavored liquid coffee creamer add a pinch of cinnamon, leave out the raisins. Never lasts more than two days. Everyone adds their favorites ... chocolate chips, pecans, etc.

I used 1% milk and substituted Truvia Baking Blend for the sugar (at recommended conversion).  Used Mexican vanilla, more than recommended. Sprinkled with nutmeg. Over a few days I ate the whole thing, guilt-free!

I followed this recipe except I reduced the sugar a bit due to so many reviews of this recipe being too sweet.  My husband loved it, he said it was just like his mom used to make.  I have never had or made it before.  I liked everything but the raisins.

I didn't like the taste of butter.  It wasn't the flavor I was looking for.  Also, I didn't get that strong cream/milk flavor I'm used to.   It certainly tastes good, but not my ideal rice pudding.

I used 1% milk and omitted the raisin and added 1/4 tsp cinnamon. It was creamy and delicious! I will definitely make this one again.

I loved this recipe because, although sweet and creamy, you can taste the rice.  I made it with brown rice and it was crunchy AND creamy.  Unlike most sticky, sweet and bland puddings.

I doubled the recipe, used eggnog in place of the milk (because I had to use it up), halved the sugar and put about a Tablespoon of cinnamon in it while it was cooking.  Delicious!

Excellent recipe!  I make it with skim milk and it is still rich and creamy.   One person here didn't like the result, but she used brown rice, which has an entirely different texture profile, and I suggest turning down the heat before adding the milk/egg mixture, and you must stir constantly those last couple of minuted to avoid any stray egg bits!  I beat the egg with the remaining milk to help guard against "scrambling" the egg.

I cooked my rice in my multi-cooker, so I used a separate pan on the stove, but you can make this a one-pot task.

Terrific comfort food, so easy, and much more economical than the store bought versions.

I made this exactly as written and I was not impressed. It was too sweet - lots of raisins and too much sugar. The consistency was not of a pudding, rather a rice casserole. If I try to make it again, I would use less raisins and less sugar, and perhaps increase the amount of milk to moisten the consistency.

I make this all the time and one night inspiration struck! I had some coconut milk in the fridge and substituted one cupfor one cup of milk. Also added some shredded sugarless coconut. Divine! Probably a good idea to add a little extra milk to compensate for the additional dry ingredient especially as this sometimes comes out to dry.

My husband wanted to make rice pudding so I gave him this recipe as a base. Can't say we followed it exactly because my husband was just trying to use up some cream or something that was in the fridge but we followed as close as we could, all things considered. Extra raisins and cinnamon on top, so good!

I had leftover rice so I decided to try this.  It is the first time I made rice pudding and it came out perfectly.  I actually used 1 cup whole milk and 1 cup half and half because it was all that I had.  I also increased the vanilla a bit  and mixed in a little nutmeg at the end.  As suggested in other posts, I added some of the thickened rice/milk mixture to the eggs first to temper them before adding the eggs to the pan.  This was definitely not low-cal, but I wanted good rice pudding so I didn't care.  It was so easy!  I will never buy rice pudding at the store again; this was so much better!

This recipe was amazing! I substituted the regular milk for soy milk, and it was really spectacular. I also added a little bit of cinnamon into the pudding, I didn't use the raisins, I'm just not a huge fan of them. The trick to not making scrambled eggs when you add the eggs to the mixture is to 1) Make sure the heat is at medium, possibly a bit less. 2) KEEP STIRRING!!!
Whatever you do, don't stop stirring in the eggs until they are 100 percent mixed in. I used medium grain rice and it turned out great. This one is certainly a keeper!

The best rice pudding recipe I've found so far! I used Minute Rice, because it was all I had. I also beat the egg into the last 1/2 cup of milk to decrease the risk of egg chunks. I opted for 1/4 tsp vanilla just to be on the safe side.
It was creamy, thick and rich; exactly how rice pudding should be!

I have been searching for the right recipe for years, and finally found the one that is the closest to my childhood memories of the rice pudding my great aunt used to make.
I added the sugar to the egg in a separate bowl, then slowly added some of the hot mixture to it, stirring continuously.  I kept adding the hot mixture until the egg mix was warm.  Then I slowly added it to my rice mix, stirring gently.  No egg lumps.. just a lovely creamy consistence.

I made it for breakfast and what a hit--just delicious! Loved all the raisins. Simple and easy to make. It took quite a bit longer to thicken. I added nutmeg and a little cinnamon.  This recipe is a keeper.

Instead of using regular white rice, I used sweet/sticky rice.  I rinsed the sticky rice once and let it boil with the water rather than having the water boil alone.  I didn't use another pan.  I just scraped off all the cooked rice using a spatula and combined the ingredients called for.  The secret to not having eggs bunch up is to continuously  stir the rice while pouring the beaten egg.  I skipped the butter and poured a little heavy cream instead (depends on how creamy you want it), then stirred it for about 5 minutes.  No raisins.  That's it.  The taste was very close to Trader Joe's rice pudding.

no changes needed, this recipe is awesome! I made this because my 17 year old daughter loved it at christmas, It is sooo easy. I made this for the first time holding my newborn. She loved watching, and I can't wait to make it for her someday. I listened to all the suggestions ( tempering the eggs, and making sure I liked the consistency of the rice at first cooking,and last... making sure I liked the thickness when cooking the last time) sooo simple.. anyone thinking about it should try it.

I used left over cooked rice to make this recipe. So I had to double the recipe, the consistence of the pudding was perfect! However it was a tad salty. Since I had already salted the rice when cooking it. So next time I'll cut the  salt  back. Other than that it was perfect!

This is delicious! I didn't cook the rice the full 15-20 minutes so the rice came out a little firmer, but my husband and I absolutely loved this recipe. Oh and we didn't do raisins because my husband doesn't like them, and it still turned out amazing.

Before I made this recipe, I had cooked another one that turned out god-awful! After such a catastrophe, I came across this recipe and it turned out to be my saving grace....a little slice of Heaven! I cooked rice as suggested and added my salt there. When it came to the 1 1/2 cps of milk, I used half 1% and half evaporated milk. The evap milk gave the rice/milk mixture a custard-like taste. Per advice from others, I didn't add the sugar until there were 2 of the 15 mins left on the clock and I was pleased with the creamy consistency of the rice and milk. When it became time to add the sugar, I also added a little extra sugar. We like it sweet. I used evap milk in final 1/2 c, that I mixed with an egg, and some of the hot rice I was mixing on the stove. I sure didn't want to end up with a scrambled egg in my rice pudding. Finally I added 2 tbsps of  butter, 2/3 c of raisins, 3-4 tsps of vanilla, a dash of nutmeg, and a dash or two of cinnamon!! This was unbelievably delicious and friggin' easy to make!! Before the batch was even finished, my teens had me immediately make another one!! Simply put: It was the BOMB!

Fabulous recipe! Rice pudding is my husband's favourite but I never make it for him because it's such a pain. Until now! So I cheated a little and used Uncle Ben's 8 min rice. It worked fine. Also I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg when I added the rice to the milk and sugar. Delicious!

This is one of my favorite treats. I have made it several times. The last time I made it I had some heavy whipping cream I wanted to use up, so I replaced 1/4 cup of the milk for 1/4 cup cream. Then I left out the butter at the end. It's was better than ever! Sometimes I use brown rice and sometimes I substitute 1/4 cup honey for the sugar and that is very good too.

The timing on the rice i belive is wrong. At the end the rice needed to be cooked longer, and their was bits n' pieces of egg whites. Also, I would add a little of cinnamon.

Tasted good, but I would try tweaking it some more next time. I did take the recommendations of other reviewers with adding some hot pudding to the egg mixture and that did work for me and I had no problems. What I didn't like was the rice to pudding ratio. It was just too much rice for me. I did measure out 1.5 cups, but it was still just too much. I think next time I'll see how cutting down slightly on the rice works out.

Added nutmeg and cinnamon, really great consistency and flavor! You could add any flavoring you like and it would turn out great (pumpkin or apple pie spice!) It definitely did not need any more sugar, I thought it was plenty sweet.

Followed the recipe word by word and it was good, but had some strange patches to the cooking process. Had to add a sprinkle of cloves, nutmeg, and a teaspoon of cinnamon to give that warm flavor. Oh, some other things I did different was use regular ol' purple raisins, hold the egg since my pudding was already so thick and sticky, and brown sugar instead of white, just to get that umph flavor since my mom has dubbed herself a rice pudding connoisseur and this pudding was for her itchy sweet tooth. She gobbled it up, my dad said it seems to be missing something (then again it's hard to please him... He has high expectations, growing up with delicious homemade market Amish rice pudding) but overall was tasty. I myself did enjoy it, and recommend adding in those spices or at least some cinnamon. Three stars, would make again.

Loved this! Made a couple tweaks. I didn't have raisins so I omitted them. I had made Thai green curry for dinner so I used the extra jasmine rice I made and I had about a half a can of light coconut milk left over  so I add that as part of the regular milk. It was outstanding!!

Wonderful comfort food. I did not have raisins. I made it using left over rice (4 cups) so got a large batch. It takes a long time for it to get thick but it is worth it.

Very easy to make!!! I had left over rice from dinner  tonight and it was just enough for this recipe...I should have kept reading comments as the egg scrambled when I added to rice mixture, NEXT time I will take a little of the pudding and rice mixture and mix with the egg before I add the egg to the hot pan, otherwise I give 2 thumbs up for this recipe!

When I was growing up, rice was an uncommon side dish and any leftovers were turned into cold rice pudding (not dissimilar to tapioca pudding) served for either breakfast on a hot day or dessert anytime. I totally missed out on fried rice back then! After college, I discovered kheer, an Indian rice pudding, typically served hot, warm or cold. Neither version I've ever had included raisins and I don't have any on hand so I skipped them, though I'm sure it's a delish add.  I also skipped the butter, though it probably added richness (+calories).  Anywho, I just made this recipe using leftover (frozen!) cooked rice and skipped the first step in the recipe, as a result. I used equal parts cooked rice & milk plus the sugar and brought it to a simmer. I added the rest of the milk and egg substitute (room temp), along with double (yeah, 1t!) the amount of vanilla, plus 1t of ground cardamom, ate it at room temp and it was delicious. It’s a perfect blend of my childhood memories and my love of exotic cuisines!

I omitted the raisins and followed the recipe. The pudding looks good, nice and creamy, the taste of the sauce is good, but when you bite into rice, it's bland. Next time I will put half of the sugar and salt in water with rice. I also decreased the rice to 1/2 cup and water to 1 cup, so I could use the same pot and not remeasure rice. My final taste test committee ( hubby and kids) are waiting till the pudding cools down. I might update the review after that )

This was the second recipe I tried and since I think it's the best I didn't search any further! Love it and I think it's perfect. I do use blend aka 50/50 Cream - 10%MF only because I lost so much weight recently I can splurge :)

Very thick and creamy, not watery in texture like other rice puddings. Something I did differently was omit the raisins (just didn't have them on hand), and I heated the egg with the last 1/2 cup milk in a small sauce pan. I didn't like the idea of adding a raw egg to a hot pot of rice and milk. While the rice/milk mix was thickening, I heated the egg with milk with some sugar for some extra sweetness. Turned out great!

Excellent recipe!  I tripled the recipe and instead of using 6 cups of milk, I used 3 cups of milk and 3 cups of heavy cream. I have no idea how many calories that added but I don't care!  This is the creamiest rice pudding I've ever had!

I always find that leftover rice from Chinese food gets hard and dry in the fridge, so I use it to make this pudding instead! It's absolutely delicious. I omit the raisins and add nutmeg but otherwise follow the recipe closely. 
One small note, if you're looking to cut back on the fat: I have on occasion forgotten to add the butter at the end, and it really doesn't make a huge difference in the flavor!

I made this and when it was finished it was perfect, the texture, flavor and eye appeal were all amazing. However I like mine ice cold. I put this in the fridge and the rice soaked up all the cream. Would this be rectified if I used cooked and cooled rice

I LOVE this recipe. Its my go-to for rice pudding. The only thing I have changed was using canned condensed milk, instead of regular because I just happened to be out of milk the day I made it. And I always use instant rice, prepare as directed and skip to #2 on the list. I also always finish mine off in the oven after its cooked to get the crunchy top. Usually on 350 for about 10-20 minutes. Delicious though!! I am so thankful I found this recipe. I have made it about a dozen times. It has never failed me.

I love this! It's easy and a great way to use leftover rice. I just leave out the raisins cause not all of my family like it. I make it at least once a week.

Good recipe; nice and creamy.  Personally, my only problem with the recipe is that I found it VERY sweet using the full 1/3 cup of sugar.  Next time, I will probably only use 1/4 cup or maybe less.  Otherwise, it's very good, quick and easy!

Very good!  This turned out delicious.  I made it as written except only used one pan not two.  Some of the negative comments are from people who obviously either didn't follow the directions or are not familiar with standard cooking principles.

I followed the recipe excluding the raisins (since I'm not a huge fan), omitting the salt, and substituting Splenda for sugar (at the recommended amount). For my rice, I chose Jasmine (which already has a delicately sweet nutty smell and flavor). During the addition of the last 1/2 cup of milk, I whisked the egg and milk together, along with the splenda and stirred it into the pudding, continuing to stir for the next 2 minutes as suggested in the recipe. After my pudding cooled, and for my first serving, I folded in a little bit of homemade prepared whipped cream (I use Splenda and vanilla in mine) and swirled in some sugar free raspberry preserves. Frankly, any rice will work. You just have to make sure you cook it to the desired consistency first. The Jasmine Rice works very good with this recipe. The raspberry preserves adds a little bit of sweet/tart that contrasts nicely with the creaminess of the pudding. Love it, and will make it over an over again.

This is a wonderful recipe! I had a friend growing up who's grandmother was from Columbia and made THE BEST rice pudding....she was an incredible woman who didn't speak a word of English but, always made sure there was rice pudding with out raisins just for me when I would visit...this recipe comes very close to what I remember from all those years ago...the only changes I made was to add a little roasted cinnamon and nutmeg and heavy cream for the last 1/2 cup of liquid. Delicious! I'm a happy girl!

My husband loved this recipe!  He was humming while he ate it.  I doctored up the recipe by adding 1/2 c creamer since it already had  vanilla in it, oh and extra cinnamon. It smells so good in my kitchen!

I made this with leftover rice that I had cooked with Chicken Bone broth instead of water.  I prorated some of the ingredients to the leftover rice and just made it.  My problem is I don't know what its supposed to taste like! He was asleep.  I left hubby a note and told him I tried the Rice pudding and he ate it all.  It did take him a week.  But he did tell me to save the recipe.  I didn't put the raisins in there, didn't have them, He was happy....makes me happy.  Personally I think I never liked it because of the texture.

I've made this twice in two days. The first time I followed the recipe but used regular raisins and added cinnamon and nutmeg. I also used skim milk. The second time I omitted the sugar entirely and added cream, and honestly I didn't miss the sugar at all, and this way it made a great breakfast. I also just used leftover rice from Chinese takeout, which made it ridiculously simple and a good way to use up that extra plain white rice!

Omg! Yummy! Just like my mom made. I omitted the raisins (cause they're gross), and used skim milk and jasmine rice. 

Helpful tips:
The trick is to cook the rice, empty the pot and clean it, then measure 1 1/2 cups of cooked rice (smash it down into the cup measure) and add it to the cleaned pot. (You will probably have some extra rice let over.)

To avoid cooked egg bits, pour the remaining milk into a bowl with the egg. Let it come to room temp or close to it. When it comes time to add the egg/milk, scoop some of the already cooked rice pudding into the milk/egg bowl and stir. This will help warm up the egg so it doesn't cook the second it hits the rice pudding. Then add the mixture to the pot. Cook a few more minutes and remove from heat. Let it sit for a while to thicken.

This was a great recipe! I did reduce the amount of milk to 1 1/3 cups as others suggested. I also added some cinnamon and instead of the butter added half of a banana at the end! It was amazing! Thanks for a great recipe! Will definitely make this again!

I have made this rice pudding a couple dozen times now. The first time I made it with risotto which was lovely and creamy. Most times, however, I use leftover rice from Chinese takeout with excellent results. First, I put the rice in a large pan and flatten out the rice, getting out all the lumps. Then I add the milk (non-fat, low fat, whole, 1/2 & 1/2, lactaid,whatever is in the fridge). After the milk has warmed, I add the sugar and some cinnamon & nutmeg. Cook over med. low heat. Then after the mixture has thickened, I add a tempered egg (very important so that you don't get scrambled eggs in your pudding; simply pour about 1/2 cup hot mixture very slowly into the beaten eggs whisking constantly). Then pour the egg mixture back into the pudding and add  milk & raisins. Let cook for a couple minutes over low heat to finish cooking the eggs. Remove from heat and add vanilla and  butter. Don't be afraid of the egg tempering. This is a great recipe and can be modified easily to your tastes.

I had a lot of leftover white rice from Chinese dinners we had ordered in the past. So I decided last night to make this recipe to surprise my family with a dessert tonight. Since my rice was already cooked, I used 1 1/2 cups. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. 

One reviewer commented that the egg added at the end started to cook before it mixed into the mixture. It's likely that she added the egg before the last 1/2 cup of milk, and the mixture was too hot. If the milk is added before the egg, the mixture is cooled enough that the egg mixes in fine. 

At any rate, this rice pudding recipe was wonderful, and my family loved it. After I poured it into the container to refrigerate it, I sprinkled it with cinnamon.  This has become my go-to recipe for rice pudding. I wouldn't change one single thing in the recipe.

I was looking for a home made and delicious rice pudding recipe. I made this just as the recipe says, no changes. I tasted the rice when I first added the milk and it was thoroughly cooked and had good texture. I added the sugar a few minutes later when it was thickened up and the taste at that point was really good, what I would expect rice pudding to taste like.  I wanted to just stop at that point but there are so many rave reviews and I decided to just finish the dish like it says, with the beaten egg and remainder of the milk. I thought it sounded strange to put egg in but did it anyway and it made the rice pudding less flavorful, a strange texture, and I honestly thought it was ruined at that point. I wish I left the egg out and eaten it without it. It would have been a 5 star dish for me then. But the way it is, with the egg, it's two stars. Also my rice burned a bitter layer on the bottom of the pot and it gave that flavor to some of the rice. All in all, I will definitely leave the egg out next time.

I used parboiled long grain rice and cooked it per instruction about 20 minutes on low. (it's usually 1:2 with water). 
I didn't have sugar so I used honey.
dash of nutmeg, def used the vanilla. Salt of course.
*someone mentioned be careful not to add sugar(honey) until after you cook rice, so I listened.
when I added the milk mixture, I checked it frequently and i needed a little more milk to keep it nice and creamy.
cooked, simmered and stirred freq for about 18 minutes.
*When I added the rest of the milk, I microwaved it first for 45 seconds to make it hot, then added the butter and used a whipper to beat the egg into the mixture. (this way it won't turn out like a scrambled egg.)AFTER this was blended, I poured into the pot. (I only used one pot.)
cooked about 3-4 minutes more. stirred it up, let it set. 
added cinnamon to taste.
INCREDIBLE (and I didn't even have any raisins to use.)

Made this recipe with my 4 y/o daughter. It came out delicious! We added some extra raisins, as per her request. I also added some cinnamon. Would definitely make again. Reviews complaining of egg  chunks in their mixture is a result of not adding the egg properly.  You are basically scrambling your eggs  You have to temper your eggs first. Add all milk required at once. When you are ready to add eggs, Beat the eggs in a small bowl and then take a 1/2 cup of hot liquid out of the pot. Mix them together in the separate bowl then slowly add that mixture back into your pot.  It will turn out great!

Delicious, not too sweet and creamy. Reminds me of Mom's.  I should have  doubled the recipe!  I used leftover rice and took a reviewer's advice and pulled a cup out of the pot to temper the egg mixture.  Worked perfectly.

It was great tasting!! I'm used to it being a bit creamier so I'll have to attempt it again. I must say the egg white did cook quickly (I'll blame my stove!! It's devilish hot!!) other than that this is a great recipe!! I'm planning on eating it all on my own lol!! Happy cooking!!

Amazing! I made Jasmine Rice for dinner earlier and had a ton leftover- what a great idea for leftover rice! I cooked the rice and milk for about 17 mins on med-low. I omitted the raisins because I don't like them and this pudding turned out excellently!

I doubled the recipe. Used 1/4 cup white sugar, added 1/2 cup of sweetened condensed milk and 3/4 cup of coconut milk. Used 3 tablespoons of butter and a 1/2  tspn of cinnamon. After removing from the heat,  I also added 3 tblspn of coconut milk. It was delicious!!  Thank you for sharing your recipe Erica G.

Yum!!! This recipe is so creamy and easy to make! I think it's also forgiving - I was in a rush and never used a timer, and I used mostly 1% milk with maybe 1/4 cup half and half, just a dash of cinnamon and a couple of cardamom pods I added with the second step.

I made it just like the recipe said. However, I did beat the eggs with 1 cup of the milk. It looked wonderful. As I cooked it on medium heat, the eggs seemed to separate from the rest of the pudding.  Why? What did I do wrong?

I have been making this rice pudding for over a year now because it is, by far, my favorite recipe.  The proportions of rice to milk seem just right, and the addition of the butter gives it a more complex, luxurious flavor. It does seem to me to speed up the thickening process by waiting to add the sugar in at the very end, when you add the butter.  For those of you who think making homemade rice pudding isn't worth the time, store bought rice pudding has nothing on this one.  In fact, they shouldn't even be uttered in the same sentence.

Very creamy and delicious.  I added a little nutmeg and I think the next time I make it I will increase the sugar to 1/2 cup.

Quick, easy and delicious!  I used left-over rice, so that really cut down on the preparation time.  To prevent the chunks of egg one person mentioned, stir a little of the hot rice mixture into the egg; then add the egg to the hot mixture.   I also added cinnamon and a little nutmeg.   My family loved it.

Didn't use raisins because my family doesn't love them, but the recipe turned out better than I expected! Only makes enough for 3 to 4 people so keep in mind to double or tripple the recipe when making for a family. I used a bit more vanilla extract than the recipe and it taste perfect. Will definitely become a staple with my family

I had never even eaten rice pudding before, let alone made it.  I followed the recipe, except I used black rice, and evaporated milk, and added about a half teaspoon of corn starch to the egg/milk mixture! Just to help it set up.   love it. It was easy to make, and it is really creamy and yummy!!!  I'm definitely a fan!

This is the ultimate rice pudding recipe. It comes out creamy and perfect every time I make it. It almost tastes store bought. I would recommend a short grain rice.

I changed up this recipe ... used lite coconut milk, simmered the middle step with a cinnamon stick and 6 green cardamom pods and doubled the vanilla. Also, to give it  a bit more nutritional content, I added 1/2 cup of almond meal -- it came out totally delicious and the almond bits incorporated completely into the final smooth-textured pudding. Perfect!

Delicious! I had 2 cups of cooked rice so I increased the milk to two cups and kept the remaining ingredients the same. I followed the suggestions and stirred small quantities of the hot mixture into the milk and egg slowly  before adding to the hot pot.  The next time I make it, I will take it off the heat when it is still very creamy as I found it set quite a bit when cooling.  Easy, inexpensive and the ingredients are always on hand - a winner.

First of all, it's always best to use short grain on any rice pudding recipe in so that it is creamier. When I made this I used a combination of 1/2 cup regular short grain and 1/4 arborio rice that I had left. Other than that, this was a great recipe, and is actually light and fluffy! Very delicious and simple.

This is SO easy to make!  It's a perfect recipe for this wonderful dessert.  I made only one change:  I used regular dark raisins, since I do not like the golden ones, and I used about a half a cup of them.  I think it's too much to put the full amount in.  Don't forget to add nutmeg (my choice) or cinnamon near the end.  It does need this little kicker, and the recipe calls for it!  Oh, and you're hard put to get 4 servings--maybe 2--it's just too good!

I made this for my wife and she loved it.  I made it a little too thick so be careful when thickening.

My parents love rice pudding and this was so easy to make. The only thing I changed was I didn't put in the raisins. Dad doesn't care for them. But other than that it was perfect.

The 1st time I made this it was wonderful. The 2nd time I changed the serving # from 4 to 8. But the directions did not change just the amounts in ingredients   I found myself guessing on directions.  Hope it comes out.

Great recipe. I heeded Peggy's suggestion, and waited a bit before throwing in the sugar. It turned out perfectly. I added a hint of nutmeg and of cinnamon.

I used long grain brown rice and it turned out just fine. have to cook rice fully according to package. Used a bit more sugar, salt and cooked a bit longer with milk mixture. Added cinnamon to milk mixture and also on top, while cooling off. easy and oh so good.

Love this recipe and have used it several times.  Today, however, i made a few changes involving a number of items I got from Trader Joe's.  First, used organic basmati rice, which works really well! I cooked the rice in coconut milk which helps to remove carbs from the rice and gives it a great texture, and I continue to just keep the rice in the coconut milk, adding some 1% milk for the rest of the preparation.  I use mostly Splenda, but use about 2 tbsp of the TJ organic maple sugar to complete the 1/3 c. Instead of raisins (no fans in the house), I used the honey roasted sliced almonds for a little crunch. And instead of vanilla extract, I use the Trader Joe's pure bourbon vanilla extract.  But the finishing touch (besides a touch of clove) is that instead of cinnamon, I used the Trader Joe's Matcha Green Tea Latte mix.  I love anything with green tea.  Using about 1-2 tbsp of the mix right before adding the egg works perfectly, and boy did it taste good!

Easy to make, turned out great! I doubled the recipe, since I'm addicted to rice pudding! Be careful to measure out your cooked rice- yields of different types of rice vary once cooked! I used 3 cups Calrose medium-grain rice. I simmered the cooked rice in the same pan with 2 cups whole milk, plus 1/2 cup evaporated milk and 1/2 cup condensed milk. I tempered 2 eggs in a bowl with the hot rice milk from the pan, along with another 1/2 cup of evaporated milk & 1/2 cup condensed milk, whisked it all together then added it to the rice mixture. Since the condensed milk is sweet, I cut the sugar in 1/2. I used the salt, butter, and vanilla as instructed, and added cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice to taste. It turned out very creamy, full of flavor, and is good hot or cold. No problems with it drying out or gumming up in the fridge. I really feel that using 3 types of milk made a big difference in the taste & texture. The only thing I'll do differently next time is when I cook the rice, I'll add a little more water & let it cook 30 min instead of 20- my rice is slightly more firm than I'd like- but that's probably because I doubled the recipe & didn't adjust the rice cooking accordingly. This recipe was super easy & even with my changes to it, I finished making it in 45 min with very little mess to clean up!

This was my first recipe that I tried from Allrecipes about 9 years ago.  It has been my go to rice pudding ever since!  I follow the recipe as written and then add some cinnamon and nutmeg at the very end.  My family can't get enough!  Thanks for making me look like a fantastic cook!

Absolutely delicious! Next time,  think  I will use a touch less vanilla, and I added a couple drops of aromatic bitters and used craisins instead. But the recipe is fantastic! And very easy to do!
Also! I used almond milk as a substitute because I am lactose intolerant. Worked just as well!

I love this recipe.I have been using it for years and it's always a crowd pleaser, even my picky father in law loves it. I do add an extra cup of milk and a stick of butter though. And no raisins and rarely wait for it to cool enough not to burn my tongue before devouring.

This is just delicious! I used our leftover rice from dinner, which just happened to be about a cup and a half. I used Mahatma Valencia short grained white rice. I used whole milk, and a whole teaspoon of vanilla. Right before pouring into serving dishes I stirred in 1/4 t. of ground cinnamon and nutmeg. Then when serving, I sprinkled a little more nutmeg on top, and a squirt of whipped cream from the can. Um Um Um. Thanks for a great use for leftover rice which I usually end up saving, only to throw away later!

Not sure what I did wrong, but I was truly disappointed.  I only had brown rice, but usually if you add a little extra water that can still work out.  No.  It did not.  But it wasn't just the consistency of the rice--the pudding never truly thickened, and even though I did temper the raw egg I still got chunks of egg white.  And the taste was...not good.  Not sweet at all.  I even tried adding some honey afterward to sweeten it, but even that didn't help.

Most folks here seemed to do just fine with it, so it must have been something I did.  Thought I followed the recipe (except for the brown rice), but....Yeah.  Doubt I'll try again.

I cannot believe I made rice pudding!  Thank you to the reviewer who talked about tempering the eggs...doubled the recipe, used sushi rice (the only non long grain I could find) and went a little lighter on the sugar, but for my first time ever making any kind of pudding, came out wonderfully! might play with using coconut milk or almond extract...maybe adding some lemon or orange zest...

Pretty much always just use this recipe for rice that we've already cooked in our zojirushi rice cooker, so I never have to worry about the rice not being done. I have done this with brown rice as well, though it is just not quite as decadent and delicious as a white rice version. And I always add a healthy dose of cinnamon on top to mix in!

Great recipe. I used leftover Chinese rice in the frig. Very sweet so you could cut back the sugar some but husband likes sweets :).  I sprinkled cinnamon on it like others.

Our whole family loved this recipe, including our picky 3 year old and 6 year old who claims he hates rice. A keeper for sure! I used Almond milk instead of regular milk and it was still very good.

I have made rice Pudding my whole life and have to say even with modifications this is best rice pudding I have ever Made. I used a combination of wild and brown rice rather than white rice and added an egg cause mine were small. It is creamy and delicious. Also so much faster than the long oven bake process ( which did not work well with the wild and brown rice ). Thank  you for sharing this old family reciipe.

First time ever making rice pudding. Doubled the recipe, exchanged 1/2 the milk for half & half I  needed to use and omitted the raisins (not our thing) and it is so YUMMY!  Definitely my permanent recipe! Thank you!

Perfection!  I added organic vanilla powder along with extract.  I tripled the recipe so I would not have leftover rice. It was creamy and so good.  I soaked my raisins for about an hour in boiling water. I also only had long grain rice so I used it. Not sure why other reviewers said not to use it and what the complications would be. I cooked the rice in the rice cooker as indicated in the instructions for my particular rice cooker. This pudding is just perfect in my opinion. 5 stars all the way.

I'm not a lover of rice pudding but this version has totally swayed me. My mom requested this when she was ill and I wanted to make a better version then the one she always tried to feed me (Betty Crocker I think). So recipe hunting I went and I actually really like this one. I used sushi rice to increase starchy creaminess, but rinsed it after it was cooked so it wasn't a pile of mush. Used whole milk, bourbon vanilla, and Demerara sugar- tastes amazing!!

I was craving rice pudding and decided to give this one a try since it had such rave reviews. All of the reviews are well deserved!! I made it with medium grain rice, and followed the recipe exactly except for one little change. I used 1 3/4 cup low fat milk and 1/4 heavy cream. I added the cream because I had it on hand and I thought it would make it a little richer since I was using low fat milk. I topped with cinnamon and nutmeg. Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe!!

For years I made rice pudding baked in the oven & thought that was the best way. It was good, but couldn't hold a candle to this one! Moist & delicious, it should be everyone's go-to rice pudding!

I made rice pudding for the first time, tonight, and I'm thrilled to have found and followed this recipe. It was easy to make and the results were outstanding! So creamy, so tasty. I sprinkled it with cinnamon and sugar and served it warm. My family couldn't get enough! :-)

Very good, but for all the ones that had trouble with the egg..you have to temper the egg first, you can't just throw it in there,beat the egg in a small bowl,add some of the rice mixture into the egg..SLOWLY stirring constantly until the egg is warmed thru, this way you won't wind up with egg chunks in your pudding...

I love this recipe.  I am gluten sensitive and cannot eat anything with gluten.  This was not only easy to prepare, it kept well in the refrigerator.  It was so handy when I wanted something to snack on.  I will make it often.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic! The pudding turned out creamy and delicious and it was a huge hit with the whole family. The recipe was simple and easy to follow, and I wouldn't change a thing! I will definitely make this again.

Perfection! I had some leftover basmati rice to use up and thought I'd treat my mom to some rice pudding. I followed the recipe to the letter, also grating a generous sprinkling of nutmeg into the mixture while it cooked. I wouldn't change a thing! Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

This was so good, probably the best rice pudding I have ever had.  I used 1 tsp instead of 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla because I wanted a vanilla pudding, it was perfect.

This rice pudding was excellent!  I have a serious sweet tooth and this really hit the spot.  The only thing is, I added more sugar because I didn't find it sweet enough. I also used evaporated milk instead of regular milk.  FANTASTIC!!!  Will definitely make it again and again.

Well let me say I never made rice pudding this fast nd easy. I'm Puerto Rican nd on the holidays we make rice pudding almost similar but we use coconut milk nd cream of coconut for a more exotic tropical taste.. This is the first time I've made rice pudding without the coconut cream nd milk nd I must say it taste awesome! I like it cold so it's chilling in the fridge as of rt now, can't wait to dig in lol! Thanx for the recipe nd tips.

AMAZING!  I wouldn't have changed a thing but I only had Jasmine rice and dark raisins on hand.  It still turned out amazing.  Other than that, i followed directions as written and it turned out wonderfully!  Thank you!

Easy and fast! Thx to other reviewers who said use medium grain rice and add sugar only after rice is cooked! While you can follow recipe as is for success, this recipe does allow for experimenting with your favorite touches and flavors ie., add cinnamon stick, orange zest or dried orange granules and 1/4 tsp Anise to water. Yum!

I thought it was very quick and easy with no baking needed. It also came out nice and creamy the way I like it. I didn't give it more stars because we thought it was way too sweet. I only added 1/4 cup of sugar and it was still too sweet. It was so sweet that I had to add more rice to make it edible for my husband. I wasn't able to add the raisins or nutmeg because that would have made it sweeter still. I also cooked the rice with butter and salt the way I always do instead of adding it at the end. Next time I will omit the sugar completely and then I think it well be a winner!

Comfort food to the max! I used long grain brown rice, one large whole farm fresh egg, skim milk and unsalted butter. Lots of interesting texture with the chewy raisins and nutty flavored, long grain brown rice. If one desired another layer of texture, a few toasted walnuts would be great, but I love this just the way it is!  Thanks for the comfort of a rich and satisfying rice pudding! P.S. I find that 1/4c. is really quite enough of a serving for something this rich and sweet.

I used non-GMO Arborio rice by Lundberg. It was outstanding! Cooked in my Dutch oven, kept an even temp.  I doubled the recipe, a risk on a first time recipe, glad I did, my husband and daughter ate it all week for desert!! I saved the extras such as; Cinnamon, Nutmeg and Golden Raisins so they could put their own in later.  I let the Dutch oven cool for 15 minutes before adding the extra milk, eggs and Vanilla, so the eggs wouldn't curdle.  With winter coming soon to these parts I will definitely be making this again.  As a kid growing up in England we poured Black Treacle over rice pudding, in this beautiful country I think Maple syrup might be nice.  Enjoy.

I made some (long grain) rice for some recipes for the week and while I was eating some with a little butter and salt, I got a craving for rice pudding. I have tried it so many times but it never lives up to the rice pudding I want. This recipe DOES!  It is excellent and reminds me of my grandmother's!  Thank you for sharing this recipe. I never attempted to make it before because I thought it was difficult, but it's not. Very simple and delicious!

Just finished preparing this recipe(it's in the fridge cooling off now). At first taste this is the recipe I've been looking for. Easy made with ingredients I had on hand. Yes I just happened to have short grain rice left over from my sushi experiment last week. The only changes I had to make...after adding milk sugar and salt medium heat was way too high. I let it boil then turned it down to low to simmer for just under 15 minutes. Also kept at medium low after addition of milk and egg. I believe consistency was perfect and I'm hoping it will be so after it's chilled. Keeping my fingers crossed.

I added cinnamon and nutmeg to it and it was a great touch. I did need to cook it longer. I used a rice cooker to make the rice to ensure that it was soft.

Delicious, and a great foundation recipe! I used left-over brown rice, demerara sugar, and coconut oil as substitutes, and it still tasted amazing. Also added 1/4tsp cinnamon and dash of nutmeg. Yum!

I liked this recipe. ..however the suggestion of using a chemical artificial sweetener is just so wrong.  Try using a few spoons of honey and adding fresh strawberries or other fresh fruit, stay away from chemicals!  There's lots of natural sweeteners !

Creamy comfort food. Especially satisfying served with milk.   Sugar: 1/4 c vs 1/3. Nutmeg or allspice: 1/2 tsp during 2nd phase of cooking. Omit the butter. Using 1/4 cup sour cream or yoghurt  skyrockets the flavour.  Also:  To forget the cinnamon is very wrong.

I made this recipe due to me making way to much rice for dinner. It was fantastic. I did not change anything but added cinnamon. My son claims to dislike rice pudding and was not happy I asked him to try it. When he did he was amazed at the taste. He ended up eating a bowl of it. I will use less sugar next time, but it was great. Thank you for this quick and delicious recipe.

We usually order fried rice in our Chinese carry out, but the restaurant always includes white rice with the other dishes.  I used this recipe so that the white rice would not go to waste.  Since it was in the fridge overnight, it took a little longer to cook and thicken, but it is delicious!!  I will never toss out the white rice again.

I just made this recipe and it's really good! It's good warm and I'm excited for it to cool down. I used long grain rice because that's all I had, but it still turned out creamy. Definitely cook the rice with more water and longer if that's what you use, though. Also, make sure to add the egg gradually! I'm looking forward to making this again with short grain rice.

OMG I ate half of this recipe myself if i would have made it earlier in the day i probably would have eaten it all myself
I did use 2 cups of cooked rice and i cooked it untill it was really creamy and thick it is amazing warm or cold i do like my rice pudding on the cold side but hey i ate it both ways no complaints, i did add a little bit on almond milk when i put it in my bowl to add more creaminess didnt add raisins as i didnt have any on hand but didnt make a difference to me I LOVED IT !!!!

This is awesome! So easy to make! I've made it twice, the first time on a gas stove, the second on an electric one. Be warned, on an electric stove, you might want to add as much time as possible for everything. Either way, FIVE STARS! IT ROCKED!

This recipe is very easy to follow, and the results were wonderful.   I omitted the butter by mistake, and it was just fine anyway.   To keep the egg from curdling, I stirred it into the last 1/2 cup of milk and added it gradually.  The pudding thickened up perfectly.    Thanks much for posting!

I've tried many rice pudding recipes and this is by far the easiest and the best! Very creamy! Followed it to the letter except that I used the serving adjuster to increase it to 8 servings! So Lish!!

I browsed several recipes before stopping on this one. Thanks to all the reviews below, I trusted it enough to make a triple amount.
I agree with one of them, to add sugar when rice is nicely cooked and to add the rice mixture (I used 4 ladles) to milk/egg mixture, stir it and then bring it all back to the pot and cook it for another 1-2min.  Then I added the freshly greater nutmeg, placed raisins on the bottom of cups, added the rice mixture, topped it with cinnamon and few more raisins... now they're cooling before going to the fridge! Thank you!!!

Yum! The only thing I did differently was use 1/2 cup whipping cream and the rest skim milk because I needed enough milk for my coffee tomorrow.   Amazing recipe. It is a keeper

This was a really great basic recipe!!! It is a definite winner. You can always tweak it to your tastes.....in my case, no raisins,a touch sweeter and a little nutmeg.  I was a little concerned about scrambling the egg when I added it,but i just made sure to have it at room temperature and I beat it into the last 1/2 cup of milk which was also at room temperature. I added it gradually while stirring and had no problems at all.  I always wanted to make a really nice and creamy rice pudding and this was the recipe that did it! Awesome!!!

Honestly, I had no idea what I was doing. I had extra cooked rice from supper and started looking for recipes to use it up. I dumped the sugar and milk in the pan the rice was still sitting in & mixed it up and set it on a medium burner. Then I got busy doing other things in the kitchen, so stirred it occasionally. About the time it started to look "creamy" to me, I started reading the other reviews. I started getting nervous that mine wasn't going to work out. I beat the egg and mixed with the remaining milk and dumped it in my creamy mixture on the stove and hoped for the best. This time I stood by and stirred constantly until it looked pudding consistency. I then removed from heat and put in butter. I don't normally make rice pudding, nor have much experience with it (obviously!) but I think it turned out delicious! I also sprinkled cinnamon over individual helpings.  Long story short: good recipe for beginners/never-made-befores!

I'm in Cusco doing some research for a few months and was having a hard time satisfying my gluten-free, low-histamine sweet tooth. Just made this (sans vanilla and butter, which I couldn't find when I was rushing around the market), and it's fan-tas-tic!! Thanks for helping a gal out!

I thought this was a good recipe if you change a few things: don't add the full amount of sugar, add cinnamon, and other spices to your taste.

When I started making this recipe I was very skeptical, but it is absolutely out of this world. I did not change a thing and I followed the recipe to a tee. I used whole milk in the recipe. This thing that scared me at first is when I added the milk, rice, and sugar at the beginning of the recipe it just seemed like way too much liquid and I was tempted to add more rice but I did not. The measurements and the cooking time indicated in this recipe are right on. It turned out so good and thickened up so beautifully and the taste is amazing.

I just  took this off the stove and couldn't resist a taste. This is the bomb!  Letting it cool a little before refrigeration when I add a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg. This has just become my favorite rice pudding!!! Thank you for this recipe. When adding the eggs and milk I did beat the eggs in the milk and added some of the hot rice to prevent scrambled eggs.

Delicious and so easy! I used arborio rice which worked perfectly. Husband doesn't like cinnamon or nutmeg, but I added them separately to my servings and it was wonderful. Such a comforting, old-fashioned dish.

Thank you so much for sharing this! This is the best rice pudding recipe! I've made it several times and my husband and I love it! I add some nutmeg to the pudding when it's done.

This recipe was delicious. I'm lactose intolerant so I substituted almond milk for milk and coconut oil for butter. It turned out great!

First time ever making Rice Pudding and it was a hit!  brought back childhood memories from a kind old women that lived near us she would make it for us kids...  The only thing is I added cinnamon to the recipe.

Great recipe.

Two complaints (and they aren't huge complaints--I still follow this recipe, with few modifications, every time I make rice pudding):

1) Shocked there isn't an instruction to wash the rice before use. 

2) If you cook it for as long as this recipe says, it tends to get very thick--so thick it turns into more of a Thai coconut sticky rice! 

Tip: shave two minutes off the cooking time for a better consistency. Also, wash your rice!

even with long grain rice this is so good it's just like my grandmother makes! I put in cinnamon sticksafter I added the milk, sugar, and salt so that it could suck up the flavor. Sprinkle with ground cinnamon and voila! Perfect!

Easy and good. Have only used long grain so far but looking forward to trying with medium or short grain. Based on my preference, I did not use less sugar like a lot of reviewers, I might even put a bit more next time :)

So easy and extra good!  Best stove-top version of rice pudding I ever had and I prefer it baked.  I toasted chopped almonds and topped the creamy rice pudding with their crunchiness.  Also I used a mixture of raisins, dates and cranberries for the fruit.  I will make this again!

Scrumptious! The only thing I do different is to temper the egg before adding to the pot. This step can make or break your pudding so I definitely recommend that you do the same for perfect results.

Just now making this excellent tasting recipe for the umpteenth time.  The best tip I can offer is, follow the recipe exactly but make it short grain rice.  Perfect every time.

Thank you for the recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great! I used long grain rice (it was the cheapest at the grocery store) but it came out creamy and soft, it cooked well. Next time I'll just use 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/3 it was too sweet for me! And 1/3 a cup of raisins is plenty in here instead of the 2/3 called for. I like a little cinnamon too in mine!

Made this recipe spontaneously last night. I used Basmati rice (long grain) because that's what we had on hand. I also used coconut sugar instead of white sugar. My egg turned the whole thing really yellow and then the coconut sugar turned the whole thing a brown yellow so it didn't look appetizing at all, but it was still really tasty. I beat the egg into the remaining 1/2 cup milk and then ended up tempering the egg with some of the hot rice before adding the mixture to the rice and there were no egg chunks. Perfect recipe. Save yourself the blood sugar spike, though, and ignore anyone trying to tell you to use skim milk. The whole milk will provide some cushioning for the sugars in the dish so that you don't have a blood sugar spike.

Family loved it.  It was my first time making rice pudding.  I actually followed the recipe, with about a tablespoon more sugar.  It was really easy to make.  Even the picky teenager liked it.

Great rice pudding!  I added the salt to the water when I was cooking the rice, as was recommended by a previous reviewer.  I used whole milk and skipped the butter at the end which it really didn't need.  I also used a cinnamon stick when cooking the rice.  Delicious.

Creamy rice pudding? I don't think so!

Cooked my rice in a rice cooker first with a little salt. Doubled recipe and had to add a good half cup or more of additional sugar and extra pat of butter for our taste. Turned out nice and creamy  with wonderful flavor. Will def make this again as my daughter loved it. Thanks for this easy simple great tasting recipe

Excellent. I used homogenized (whole) milk and cooked it for a little longer than mentioned. However, I also quadrupled it and used one less egg. Creamy and wonderful! Would probably use a little less sugar next time.

So easy and so tasty!  Will definately make again.  I did add a little "cake spice" to this, which is a mix of allspice, ginger, cinnamon, coriander, and nutmeg.  Delicious!

Update:  I made this again using instant brown rice.  I had to use 1 tsp cornstarch to help it thicken up, I am assuming because I used instant rice.  I added extra cinnamon as well as raisins.  It is my new favorite

It was easy and delicious! Although it seemed like it was too thick once it cooled, so I did end up having to add more milk to it.

The only reason I made this was because I had leftover rice from Chinese food a few days before.  The rice was almost rock hard in its original container, so I heated up some water to soften the rice and drained the excess water out. Measured out 1 1/2 cups of rice and started from there.  I am gluten-intolerant, so rice is a big part of my diet, but I had never before thought of making rice pudding. I had all the ingredients, so I thought, "why not?"  My mom made it when I was a kid, but I couldn't remember if I liked it or not. In fact, as this was cooking, I wondered if it was going to be a waste of time and ingredients, because it wasn't looking all that great. I followed the recipe to a "t", except for the rice cooking directions. I was hesitant to take my first bite, but YUM! I'm eating it hot out of the pan right now! I don't think it has as creamy of a texture as it could be, maybe due to the rice I used and how stale it was when I used it, but it is still delicious, and healthy! The only thing I added was a dash of cinnamon. Besides that, followed it exactly.  Will make again. The only reason I gave it just 4 stars is because of the texture, but if I make it again with fresh rice, it will probably 5-star worthy. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe rocks. This was the first time making rice pudding. My family loved it, and they asked me to make it again today. I think next time I will add another 1/2 tsp of vanilla. It was easy to make. It tasted good warm, and I had the little bit left over for breakfast cold. This is a keeper.

I found this recipe while searching for a good one for my sick mother in law. I've never had rice pudding so it was hard for me to find a good one. Linda McLean- my father also worked for Tuscan in union for 30 years and said they had a great rice pudding. Since you suggested it, I made it today. So far she's loving it and it's so easy to make!

I made this recipe minis the raisins, because I'm not a raisin fan.  Turned out great.  I used a tad less milk because I was leaving the raisins out.  Great consistency. Garnish with cinnamon.

Really yummy and so easy!  I've never made rice pudding before and was skeptical, but it came out great.  I tempered the egg as other reviewers had suggested and also I cooked my raisins with the rice/milk from the start to make them nice and soft.  Additionally, instead of sugar I used 1 tablespoon of agave sweetener instead of sugar.  I used mostly non-fat milk with a splash of heavy cream.  Delicious :)

Loved it!  Perfect! Creamy with tender rice and soft raisins.  I used 1/2 2% milk and 1/2 heavy cream and purple raisins as that is what I had on hand.  Great warm out of the pan or cold from the fridge.

My first time making rice pudding.   Such an easy recipe to follow!  I used a medium grain rice and cooked it with the milk a bit longer then instructed - closer to 30 minutes then 20.  Came out super thick and creamy!  I'll never buy rice pudding in the store again!

I am a beginner cook so I followed this recipe exactly with the only change being made that I left out the raisins. I read some of the reviews and made sure to mix the egg with the milk and poured it slowly. Did not have any egg chunks to my surprise. I let it sit in the refrigerator and it came out PERFECT! Will make again!

I made this with soy milk, reducing the amount of milk to 1 1/2 cups total to retain creaminess (1 cup for the first portion, then 1/2 cup at the end). I also cut the raisins in half. HEAVENLY!

Absolutely amazing!  Make sure to use medium grain rice. I added an extra tablespoon of butter, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon. My husband loves this and takes it to work for breakfast.

Just what I expected from rice pudding. Don't bother looking into other recipes, this is the one.

I have tried so many rice pudding recipes that are difficult and turned out watery. This is the creamiest bestest rice pudding your ever going to get. it is custard like, delicious, and tastes great with peaches. i stirred mine a few minutes longer and didnt add raisins. it worked well. Anyone 13 and older wouldnt hav a problem with this recipe. its awesome. kudos to the one who invented the recipe ;D

If i could give this ten stars i definately would. I will never buy rice pudding again when i get a craving for it. I did a few things different with the recipe. I used medium grain rice. First I washed the rice and drained all of the water off prior to adding it to the boiling water(I dont like my rice too starchy). I followed some instructions from other reviews. I added some of the liquid from the second boil to my milk and egg and let it set for a minute or so before slowly adding it into the pot, added the raisins(used dark raisins because it was all i had) five minutes before it being done and added a couple of dashes of nutmeg and cinnamon to the pudding. I am simply amazed at how easy this was to make and how delicious it turned out!! My 2.5 year old daughter really loved it too. I  will be making  this again in the future!

My first attempt at a stovetop version (usually I bake it), and it's delicious ! The only short grain rice at the market was risotto, and I'm so glad I used it! I gave the risotto a full 22 minutes to cook.  I tripled the recipe and ran short on raisins so I made a mix of raisins and dried cherries. I also tossed in the additional cup of rice as there was more cooked than i expected. taste-wise its perfect. My guests will have dessert, and I'll have leftovers for breakfast or a snack.

Easy, great results. Only changes: used leftover basmati rice (it was fabulous). 2% milk. Eggbeaters. And I added about 1/2 tsp. Ground cinnamon during the milk-cooking phase.

Awesome! I had to omit salt and use skim milk and egg beaters (postpartum hypertension has forced me, at least temporarily, to be on a cardiac diet...boo!) It's still FANTASTIC...creamy and wonderful! THANK YOU!

This was so good I actually ate the entire thing myself. In one sitting. Yes, you read that right. I used super cheap long grain rice (that was what I had), 2% milk, cane sugar (not sure if it's the same as white sugar, it wasn't white), fresh ground sea salt and omitted the raisins. I only had it over med-high heat for a max of 10 minutes and it got super thick, I think my stove might run a little hot though. I think next time I'm going to try cutting the sugar down some and adding brandy. For some reason it just seems that brandy would go really well with this recipe so why not just add it in? Besides, it adds to the holiday flair, right?

I tried this recipe with almond milk. Thus, I am struggling giving this recipe 4 stars only because I altered it. But it feels like it is missing SOMETHING. I substituted the milk for almond milk in equal proportions. However, due to my feeling almond milk is so sweet, I only added 1.5 TBSP sugar. I bombed it with cinnamon and added a generous extra helping of vanilla. Tasty, comforting but not quite perfect.

This recipe is absolutely amazing!!  At last, a great, easy rice pudding recipe with awesome results!!  For some reason, I've never been able to make rice pudding with the proper consistency or flavor before...all other recipes I've tried have bombed.  But this one is great...the only thing I did differently is used leftover basmati rice and then made half of the milk canned coconut milk instead.  This meant you had to simmer the rice and milk mixture for slightly longer, but it turned out delicious!  The secret is just to make sure that you really do cook the mixture until it starts to thicken...adding the butter at the end makes it especially flavorful and rich!  Definitely a keeper!  Glad I doubled this recipe because it's gonna be gone soon!

This turned out just like my grandpa used to make me when I was a little girl. Only way he could get me to eat raisins. The only thing I added was cinnamon to it because grandpa was in my ear saying " where is the cinnamon?" It's perfect and yummy!! Thank you for bringing my grandpa back into my kitchen!

Very delicious warm, and chilled!  Followed  exactly, minus raisins (my kids don't like them).  Being  Filipino, we always have rice left over, so this is a great way to use it.  Thank you for sharing  your recipe. God bless:)

I've never had rice pudding before and I wanted to try it. This recipe was simple and easy to follow. I personally don't enjoy raisins, so I left them out. All in all, my first time cooking and eating rice pudding went very well. I didn't find it to be too soupy or too chewy. It was sweet and enjoyable.

Delicious! I've made it with rice and quinoa, and both are delicious! I typically use brown sugar instead of white sugar just out of personal preference.

Lived it!  Made exactly as written without raisins (its 9 pm and I'm already in my jammies). Used while milk and leftover long grain.  Perfect! Topped with a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Thank you!

Awesome!  Made a quick stir fry tonight and had lots of extra cooked minute rice leftover. 
Just doubled the recipe to make lots. Used reg milk and omitted the vanilla because I ran out. I eyeballed the raisins and added a touch of cinnamon.  Oh- and I took a tip of a fellow reviewer and tempered the egg with the pudding liquid before adding. 
Yumm!!

This is the perfect rice pudding recipe! I have tried many and did not like the outcome. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because it needed cinnamon, (which I added) and I HIGHLY suggest that you add at least a teaspoon to yours. And since I rate the correct way by rating a recipe how it was written not on what I did to make it 5 stars like some people. But yes this will now be my go to rice pudding recipe!!

This is a great rice pudding recipe.  I always cook extra rice for dinner to make this the next day.  I put a little less sugar, no raisins and cinnamon over the top - yummmmm!

This was my first time ever making rice pudding at home.  This recipe is great, but I think I'd use a bit less sugar next time.  I like it a little less sweet.  Definitely will make again though!

Five stars.  I find this recipe is best with calrose rice personally; it adds to the creaminess.  But I've made it a lot now for all kinds of people and they all love it, hot or chilled.  I sometimes stir in a hint of cinnamon and it really adds a lot.  This really comes in handy when my family makes way too much rice for dinner; then I already have dessert half way made!

This was okay, not outstanding. I have to agree with some of the reviews that it tasted more like creamed rice than actual rice pudding. My mom and granny made an excellent rice pudding but you baked it. It took a long time to prepare, and I was in the mood for rice pudding, so reason why I gave this recipe a try. I added cinnamon and nutmeg and 1 tsp of vanilla instead of a 1/2. I would make it again with less rice I think.

Although I generally prefer brown over white rice, I do know that some dishes simply should not be made with brown rice, and rice pudding is one of them. I plan to try this recipe using agave nectar in place of the white sugar, and hope it works.

I thought this was terrific. I will use med grain rice next time but it was still tasty with the long grain and I had some left over. I added about a tablespoon more sugar because I wanted it a bit sweeter after tasting it. I also added a 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon to my sugar and blended it before adding to the pot. I used regular raisins rather than golden because it was what I had on hand. YumYum! Thanks Erica.

This rice pudding was amazing. Very creamy and delicious. When I made it, i didn't have raisins, so at the end i added blueberries and pudding came out amazing. 
Maybe next time i will add less sugar or serve it together with some sour souce.
thanks for recipe!

This was my first time making rice pudding, and this recipe was easy to follow and came out delicious! It was a convenient way to use the leftover rice from Lola's Horchata, a recipe from this site. I made it without raisins, but I'm sure it would be delicious either way, and it was wonderful hot or cold. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This was delicious, all my family loved it.  The only changes I made was to use minute rice.  I cooked the rice as directed on the box, adding the salt in the boiling water, and 4 minutes before the water was fully absorbed by the rice, I added the sugar and stirred.  I then continued cooking (in the same pot) and added the milk as directed in the recipe. Since I doubled the recipe it took a little longer; about 25 to 30 minutes to thicken appropriately. When the rice was thickened, I took a few tablespoons and added it to the remaining milk and eggs as mentioned in previous reviews. I definitely would make this recipe again, it's very close to my mother's which is the best.

Best rice pudding I've ever had! I doubled the recipe. Rice was the usual long grain white (used store brand). Had zero problems. Used whole milk and half-and-half mixture. Next time I'll try skim with half-and-half. Came out super thick even after the last cup was added at the end. But thick is good! Increased the vanilla (which was whisked into the milk/egg mixture) by 1/2 tsp. Skipped the butter altogether (I was so into stirring and watching the rice pudding cooking I really forgot about it). Didn't add the raisins or cinnamon. I just mix those into individual servings if wanted. Mom had hers with milk mixed in like she grew up on. Said it was the best she's ever tasted! She's 88 and that's good enough for me. My husband had some as soon as it cooled off a little and loved it too!

This is indeed, the best rice pudding recipe on this site.  I kept the recipe the same but changed the order of cooking.  

Of course, I used short-grained rice.  To me, that's the best rice for rice pudding.  I added the salt and sugar in the water while cooking the rice and let it all absorb into it.  Once all the water was absorbed, I stirred in the butter into the hot rice.  When it came to the part to stir in the milk and egg, first I added a little bit of cooked rice into the blend and let it take to the temperature change, then slowly poured it into the pot.

The only real change I made was the milk.  I'm lactose intolerant, so I used lactose free milk.

I also saw a pretty interesting pumpkin rice pudding recipe on this site.  Since I'm very happy with this recipe, I intend to use this recipe as a rice pudding base.  I'm going to see how I can combine the 2 and give birth to a new pumpkin rice pudding recipe.

Thank you for this treasure of a recipe!!

This is an easy-to-make, tasty rice pudding. I removed a star because I thought it was cloyingly sweet starting at 1/3 cup of sugar (I should have known better, as I usually reduce sugar).  In the future, I will start at 1/4 cup and add to taste.  I can't say that I noticed the butter added a lot, so I may reduce calories by removing that, too.  Nice creamy texture.

I have made this recipe a number of times (both following it exactly and with tweaks).  It's always delicious.  Usually, I omit the raisins and butter.  Today, I left them out again and added diced apricots and a spoonful of apricot preserves.   Definitely a tweak to repeat!  The recipe deserves 5 stars as it is, too.

This is excellent.  I cut down the sugar to half and next time I think I would add a little more.  The only difficulty I had is when I added the milk it started to burn and I had to change pans.  Next time I would heat up the milk before adding it to the cooked rice.  Oh and I used arborio.  This was perfect.

In the ingredients, I think they meant that you really need 3.5 cups of milk rather than just 2 cups.  1.5 cups for the rice in the first step to cook the rice.  Then another 1.5 cups mixed with the sugar to cook again.  Then the last 1/2 cup of milk and the beaten egg.  But despite that little mixup it is delicious!

Left out the raisins. Otherwise, I made this exactly as directed with long grain rice (that's what i had on hand). It was good. I'll probably make it again but with a shorter grain rice to see if it comes out better.

I was trying to find a recipe close to my mom's own pudding recipe. We made a few changes and turned it into a rice and chocolate pudding, it turned out to be pretty good. I highly recommend this recipe!

NOTE: There are 2 types of Rice Pudding: A southern one, which is usually baked and comes out dryer. The Northern one, which is what this recipe is. So if you are looking for a dryer one need to find different recipe. Made this last night. Everyone loved it, did not change anything except I started out using 1 cup of the milk instead of the 1 1/2 cups like recipe stated. Add the final cup at the end. Turned out great!! Will be making this again. Will have to double recipe next time because everyone was asking for seconds and with a family of 5 recipe was just right for everyone to have 1 serving.

I tried it and it was great. I left out the salt. Next time I want to try leaving out the raisins and for the last half cup milk I'm going to try whipping cream instead to see how that works. I will post the result when I try it.

This was delicious! I made it dairy free by using cashew milk and omitting the butter. I also used brown rice, which worked great.

I used a family recipe for years and was never totally satisfied, so I thought I would try this one and it's the best, cremiest rice pudding I have ever made!  I used half raisins, half cranberries and it was delicious!

This was amazing! I doubled the vanilla and then used the zest of 1 orange because I don't like raisins. 
This might be the best thing I've ever put in my mouth!!

Used Splenda, cinnamon & nutmeg.  Combined rice mixture in separate pan of egg & milk to avoid curdling.  Excellent!

I used some slightly overcooked basmati rice that I had on hand and doubled the recipe. I could have cut down on the milk some as it was taking forever to thicken to a good consistency. I let it cool and thicken for an hour and it turned out pretty well. The recipe itself was great, will use medium grain next time. Great pudding!

My wife eats a package or two of store bought rice pudding every week and was reluctant to let me make something from scratch that is so easy to buy from the store.  But when I made this she became a homemade rice pudding convert.  She says it is the closest she has ever had to what her grandma used to make when she was little.

I chose this recipe because of the word "creamy", but found
it lacking in the "creamy". It was o.k. but a little gummy.
The next day I added some cool whip and a little milk before
serving and found it a little better...Postie

I've made this twice and it came out fantastic both times!  I omitted the raisins and added a little cinnamon to the end product and it was as delicious as ever!   Next time I think I will try incorporating maple syrup into the mix instead of sugar...

I changed the recipe a little so I can't comment on it, but as a base recipe, It's great. I'm sure if I followed it as written it would be just as good as the one I made. Thank you Erica for posting this recipe.

This was extremely easy to make, I substituted half the sugar for Stevia and it was scrumptious!  You can even add a bit of milk after it's done to creamy it up a bit if you let it overcook a bit, so it's very forgiving!!

Best rice pudding I have had since my grandmother's. Perfect: creamy, sweet and rich.  I only used 1 pot, let the rice sit undisturbed for 10 minutes after the initial cooking time, and used room temp butter and egg.

Quick, easy, and full of flavor! The texture was creamy and smooth and the flavor was so rich. Will definitely make again.

I don't see the need for two pans I only use one and it comes out fine. The only things I do different is I wait till the very end to add the sugar and egg and vanilla and don't use butter. I have been making it this way for over fifty years.

Wish there was a 6th star! Just wonderful, next time I'll double the recipe. Hubby complained, "That's all you made???" I used medium grain rice as another reviewer suggested. Made all in one pan, no need to dirty a second one. Stirred in a little cinnamon too. Couldn't stop eating it while still hot!

I had never made rice pudding before and found this pretty easy.  I did temper the egg mixture with some of the hot pudding to make sure the eggs didn't scramble.  I also used long grain rice but would maybe switch to a shorter grain next time because I prefer it cold, it seemed more dense with the long grain.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the pudding instead of just sprinkling it on top.  I omitted the raisins just because I didn't have any.  My husband and I ate it all within 24 hours!

Mmmm... this was yummy.  And to my surprise, the little picky-ish toddler loved it too!  I didn't have raisins on hand this time.  But next time I'll be adding raisins, and some walnuts!

Sooo good!  Used arborio rice, added raisins while it was still cooking in the milk and sugar to soften them up more.  Added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg.  I want to eat it all!

Wow ! So delicious. For the maple syrup lovers, I used same quantity of maple syrup instead of white sugar and 1 1/4 cup of milk instead of 1 1/2 the first time, no raisins. :)

FANTASTIC!  This was so easy to make and was very delicious!  Make sure you temper the egg by adding a little of the hot liquid to the beaten egg before you add it to the pudding.  I added cinnamon at the end because it isn't rice pudding to me without cinnamon!  Will definitely make again and again!

Of course, it doesn't compare to true rice pudding with 1,000 eggs, but for something quick, it's great!  Definitely add more cooking time when using skim milk.

so easy, yet so delicious. I chose to make this recipe over others because I had all the ingredients on hand. I substituted the milk for 2% and added a splash of light creme. I also used bismati rice that I had leftover from the previous night. I find this rice was more tender then regular white rice. what a easy and yummy way to use leftover rice, rather then throw it away after sitting in the fridge for a day or two. I will be making this recipe every time I have leftover rice.

I used this recipe as a guide line! I only ended up using 1/2 of milk (mostly because my rice *accidentally* cooked to a creamy soft texture). I didn't add the butter or raisins either and added a tad more sugar. Tasted awesome with whip cream and cinnamon on top!

I beat the egg together with some of the reserved milk before adding it to the cooked rice mixture - if you're worried about your egg cooking in lumps, this kind of step might help. I omitted the raisins simply because I didn't have any on hand, but next time I'll use them. I seasoned with a tiny bit of nutmeg and cinnamon - delicious. I was really impressed with the creaminess of this recipe and was happy that it didn't taste too "eggy." 5 stars!

Using brown rice (when this recipe clearly calls for white) is a little ridiculous. They are very different grains. Besides, if you're substituting for health ... ain't going to do much good given all the milk/butter/sugar in here anyway. Might as well try a different dessert.

Thank you for sharing.  I used leftover rice from Chinese take out, 2% milk and Stevia instead of sugar.  It was quick and tasty.  I don't have raising, thinking of throwing dried cranberries in instead...

wow, and oh my heck. so good. if you like rice pudding this is exactly what you are looking for. I followed the instructions to the T and it turned out just right. Like others I am not quite sure why there is need for two saucepans, but other than that I would make no changes.

I saw the note about this recipe being too sweet. I agree.  However, instead of cutting back on the sugar, I cut out the raisins (actually didn't have any the first time I made this). Once it was totally cooled, I sliced strawberries on top.  The tartness of the strawberries cut the sweetness of the pudding.  Tasted great!  Saw the note about the clumping eggs.  Temper the eggs with the warm rice mixture before adding the eggs entirely into the pudding.  Thanks!

This recipe was very tasty & easy to make. I also used the same pan I cooked the rice in to cook the pudding. My mom ate a double recipe in 2 days. She would add a little milk to a serving & warm it in the microwave.  She really loved this recipe.

Yum!  We made this with coconut/almond milk and 1/4 c brown sugar - liked everything about it, except, for us, it was overly sweet.  Will need to cut down the sugar a little more next time.

This is a great base but if you are looking for a more sweeter taste with more flavor add 1 tbsp dark brown sugar and condensed milk to the 2nd step along with 1/2 cup extra milk. Beat the remaing 1/2 cup milk and egg together in small bowl before adding it slowly in the next step. Add a little more raisins 2 tbsp of butter and double the vanilla. And dont be shy with the cinnamon! You will love it :)

This is by far, the best recipe that I have tried for rice pudding. I precooked the rice in my rice cooker, then finished cooking everything with the microwave. I added 1 tsp of allspice to the pudding. (We like allspice better than cinnamon for flavor).

My husband is a big fan of rice pudding, and after some research I decided to give this recipe a try.  The directions were easy to follow and the end results were delicious.  My husband went back for seconds, so I will be making this again!   I did let the milk and egg reach room temperature before using them.

Delicious. I did make a few substitutions. I substituted 1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 for one cup of the milk. I also left out the raisins, used brown rice and increased the sugar to 1/2 cup

My daughter and I loved it!  To us, it tasted just like the store bought rice pudding in the ridiculously small teaser containers. The only thing I did differently was I've never been able to cook successful rice on the stove; so I microwaved 1 cup rice to 2 cups water 20 minutes, perfect rice. And I stirred in the egg/milk mixture to the rice in a cold pot bringing it to a simmer so there would be no chance of the egg cooking and ruining the pudding.  This really made our mouth happy!

Used Arborio rice.  Thickened up considerably when refrigerated but still a creamy texture.  Just what my husband remembers - wonderful.

Fantastic just as it is! I used skim milk and was worried I wouldn't get that creaminess I wanted but I did after 15 minutes of cooking and stirring. I will make it again... and again!

Made this last night.  Had long grain rice so I used more water and cooked about 5 minutes longer and it was fine.  It came out excellent, nice and creamy.

My sweetie requested that I make this for him, as I have never made it before...loved it!  This quick and easy version of rice pudding surprised me how great it tasted as I always thought it was going to be a long process to get that traditional flavor!  I followed it exactly and it turned out perfect!  My only addition was that I stirred in cinnamon with the butter and vanilla at the end.  Mmm Yummy!

I'm so glad the instructions indicated that a "clean saucepan" should be used. I nearly started cooking this recipe in the pot I had make pasta sauce in earlier this evening. You really saved the day!

This is review #2783.  It is a popular recipe for good reason.  I have been craving rice pudding for a while and this hit the spot.  I added extra cinnamon and used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  This is yet ANOTHER recipe that needs raisons, but then my family wouldn't eat it.  What's a girl to do?

We had a pot full of Basmati rice left over from our dinner so my husband doubled this recipe.  It was delicious!  He used brown sugar instead of white.

I loved this recipe and so did my kids.  I didn't have any raisins on hand and I found that I added 1 1/2 TBLP of additional sugar because we like it a bit sweeter.  I must confess that I was worried about adding the egg, afraid it might scramble, but it didn't. Adding the egg is a must if you want that good pudding taste.  I love the flavor and simplicity of this recipe.  Thank you for sharing Erica G.

Perfect creamy rice pudding recipe!  If you are worried about the eggs "cooking" when added to the hot rice mixture, just scald the remaining milk and temper them before adding. I like a dash of nutmeg and left out the raisins. DELISH!!!

I used long grain rice even though the reviews said not to.  I had extra rice so I thought, why not.  Made the recipe as written and found that it lacked the cinnamon and nutmeg I am used to having in rice pudding.  However, I added it in the end to taste and glad I did.  Great pudding!

This was easy and is delicious! I used Calrose rice (short grain variety) and it made for a creamy pudding.  I also used whole milk to ensure it was satisfying and rich.  A tip, after adding the last 1/2 c of milk, add some of the hot rice and milk mixture to your beaten egg in a bowl (temper the egg) to avoid getting scrambled eggs.  Then stir it all in to the saucepan w your pudding.  I added a couple shakes of cinnamon and a pinch or orange zest as well.  I added a few crushed saffron threads to the milk as the rice and milk were cooking, gave it a nice color and subtle delicate flavor and I sautéed my golden raisins in the butter on a skillet before adding them to my pudding.  It made them tasty!  Just be sure to scrape the melted butter w your spatula into the pudding.  OMG! Flavorgasm, enjoying eating it right now.  If you want to use a long grain rice like basmati, make an Indian rice pudding instead.

So this is second time trying this recipe. The first time I had some problems when I tried to double the recipe and didn't do it correctly. This time I followed the recipe as written. I used whole milk, medium grained rice, cinnamon stick and vanilla bean. What I learned from the first time is I cooked it too long. I prefer my pudding to be custardy. The first time, I cooked it till it was nice and thick, however, when it cooled down, it was a little harder than I liked. This  time, I cooked it till it started to thicken, which was shorter an 15 min. Maybe because I used whole milk. Either way, the consistency was better the second time. Also, I used the egg yolk instead of the whole egg because I learned that from somewhere. Don't remember where. The taste is great.  Some reviews stated it was too sweet, however, I noticed that after it cooled down, the sweetness was not as strong. Oh, i used condensed milk to help sweetened it the first time, 
which made it really creamy. So now the second time around,  the consistency is better and the taste is dee-lish.  I would definitely use this recipe again.

The directions for this recipe are poor.  For those people who don't know, you need to explain that when they add the egg and milk at the end, they need to beat the hot mixture very fast and add the milk and egg slowly, otherwise the egg will curdle - as happened in the case of one reviewer.  I also add some of the hot mixture to the egg and milk to heat them up slightly and further reduce the chance of curdling.  Inexperienced cooks don't know to do this.  I made this recipe with coconut milk because my daughter cannot have milk products and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to spice it up a bit.  The coconut milk worked well.

Very nice!  My grandmother used to make the baked version, but my husband always talked about his mothers that she made on the stove top.  I think this is finally the one that he will say is like his mom's was!

It was gone by bedtime!  Only I doubled it and used a can of Carnation's Evaporated Milk and Soymilk using the same measurements as it calls for, it was the best!

I've made this several times with skim milk. . . . .and it works fine . . . The only changes I made were to increase the sugar to 1/2 c. and increase the eggs to 2. . . .I also like to double the recipe because it makes too small a batch for us.

Family loved it. Had leftovers in fridge, and grown kids visiting for Thanksgiving were getting in there, eating it before meal. Made exactly as directed. No problems.

great recipe, it turned out yummy and everybody loved it!
but I precooked my rice in a rice cooker instead of stove top, so maybe that added something or maybe it didn't.

Wow this really hit the spot! My first time making rice pudding and it turned out great. I used the frozen jasmine rice from Trader Joes. Comes in a pouch you microwave for 3 minutes and the rice is ready to go. I also used a vanilla bean, scraped out the inside and threw the bean in while cooking. I like some of the suggestions to use coconut milk and I think I will try that next time.

I have traditionally not cared much for rice pudding, but this recipe is yummy! Great for using up the extra medium grain rice after an Asian meal.

this is great!  for those who complain about the chunks of egg, just keep stirring the mixture vigorously the whole two minutes.  if you stir too gently then you will get chunks.  i was coming across the same problem.  also, i used forbidden black rice so there's at least a small amount of nutrition in it. it turned out amazing.  i never need to buy from the store again, yay!

It was ok but not creamy enough. 1 hour after making I tried it and all the liquid was gone leaving it very dry. I used 1 % milk do not sure if that makes a difference. I'll try again but with more milk, sugar, eggs, and vanilla so there will be some pudding with my rice.

I used Brown rice with this recipe (as that is what we had in the house). As the rice has to be cooked seperately, this worked fine.  I did add a little more butter.  Overall I liked it, and it was nice and sweet (yellow raisins) without a lot of sugar or other spices.

Go to recipe for rice pudding for us! We've played around with the raisins, and we end up putting very little in. I prefer 1/4 cup raisins, and we add in cinnamon. Very filling dessert!

I've made this recipe at least 4 or 5 times now. I love it. I add a little bit of nutmeg, at least twice the amount of vanilla, and some ground cinnamon. I've also made this with different flavored raisins such as cherry, strawberry etc. It gives it a bit of a unique taste I think. I like the cherry raisins the best. Great recipe and very easy!

This is a good basic recipe. I substituted  1/2 c. evaporated milk for the regular milk and didn't use an egg. It was very good.

Yes! I made it with Cal-rose short grain sushi type rice. It is a VERY good recipe. I say look no further!  :)  I added a tiny amount of nutmeg at the end. Wonderful!

Yum! I used arborio rice normally for risotto (all I had at the time) and it worked perfectly. I also used a combination of white and brown sugar because I personally prefer that, but there's no reason only one kind of sugar wouldn't be fine. Oh, and soaking the raisins in some rum or amaretto beforehand never hurts. ;-)

This had a good flavor. Despite the fact that I have not made rice pudding in many years I don't think I did anything wrong. This became very thick when refrigerated. Followed the recipe to a t. I had no trouble with adding the egg or cooking to the right consistency. I think I am going to try the recipe on this site that uses a rice cooker. I did use Goya short grain rice.

This rice pudding is amazing!  I had leftover rice from dinner and decided to make rice pudding.  This was the first time I tried this recipe and just loved it. I didn't have any raisens so I had to leave them out, but it still was delicious.  I made it from long grain rice this time, maybe next time I will use a medium grain rice to see what the difference is, but I am very happy with the way it came out anyway.

I have used another recipe for years, but this one is much better! Best rice pudding I've ever had. Easy. I needed to use a quart of cream so I did and added water. Used black raisins cause they were about to expire. Wow is is GOOD. Thankyou Erica! Barbie 
PS I tripled the recipe and it was perfect.

I was very happy with this rice pudding.  Long grain rice was all I had on hand.  And I mixed in cinnamon to flavour most of it, but did put a little aside with no cinnamon so that a friend could have his with homemade jam instead.  I like my rice pudding warm and then I add a little cold milk over the top.

I have never made rice pudding before, but what I have had, had hard bits from badly cooked rice. I used some rice I had already cooked, and didn't add the salt. It was fantastic! The ingredient amounts are very forgiving. I put kinda 1.5 cups of rice and 2 cups of milk. I tasted the rice/milk and added a little extra sugar, and I don't know if it is needed for sure, but I tempered the eggs with a little of the rice mixture before I added it to the pan. Highly recommended.

Easy and delicious ... I am lactose intolerant so I was forced to substitute almond milk for the regular milk.  Just wanted all to know that it came out with a nice taste and consistency even with the almond milk.

Yum! Doubled the recipe and used 1 quart of half and half in place of the milk. For a quick stovetop rice pudding, this is pretty darn good. I use cold leftover rice and just start at step 2. I temper the eggs by mixing in a bit of the hot mixture to warm them before I add them to the pan. (So I don't scramble them.) Sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmeg (or pumpkin pie spice) at the end. This is so quick that I am sure I'll do it again.

Reminds me of my childhood! My mom made "breakfast rice" that was sweet and had sausage chopped up in it. This is the exact replica of the rice but with raisins instead of sausage. So good!

This is really good!!! I just made it for the first time and it is pretty easy to make and ends up tasting great.  I used Della Arborio white rice and would use it again for this recipe.  You do have to watch it and stir constantly for the last two minutes so you don't burn the rice on the bottom of the pan.  I didn't use raisins.  Thanks for sharing Erica!

Excellent & quick recipe; I use Fat Free milk in place of whole milk, 1/4 cup of sugar verses 1/3 cup and I do not add raisins.  After it is chilled in the refrigerator, I top it with cinnamon.  When I serve it, I top each individual portion with whipped cream, cinnamon/sugar, and/or nutmeg to individual taste.

This is very bland, I ended up adding about an extra third of a cup of sugar and a LOT of cinnamon, it still does not taste like a true rice pudding should. Will not be making this again.

I did a few things differently only because I was really craving rice pudding and what I had is what I used praying it would turn out just as good and I am glad to Say it did. Instead of using white sugar I used brown, also the milk I used was 18% table cream and I had no raisins so I used dried cranberries it was amazing!! I will defiantly be keeping this recipe.

As a Cuban, I have eaten many excellent rice puddings. This one is pretty good. We typically use cinnamon sticks, milk, condensed milk and evaporated milk. There's no sugar, butter or eggs and it's all done in the same pot. Thanks for this version!

I used this recipe with a bunch of leftover rice from Chinese take out. It worked wonderfully! It's currently chilling in fridge. My husband is going to be one happy man.

I really like this, I don't have the time to bake it in the oven so this is perfect.

I made a few minor adjustments since I am not used to that much sugar I cut it, I left out the  raisins only because I did not have any, I like to sprinkle the top with cinnamon.
The method is perfect and it came out smooth  and creamy.

Sooo delicious!  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and doubled the vanilla.  I also used one saucepan and added everything all at once after the rice cooked.  Turned out perfect.

Outstanding recipe! No need to temper the eggs if you mix them with the 1/2 cup milk before adding to the hot mixture. I also added a 1/4 tsp cinnamon with the butter and vanilla. Yummy!!

I have tried MANY rice pudding recipes, and this is byfar THE best, easiest AND fastest! All around winner! My only tweek was adding a dash of lemon zest and voila! I find myself making it at least twice a week because it's sooo easy and my teenage boys love it for breakfast. Nice way to sneak them a little extra calcium! 5 stars easy!

Its been so long since I had rice pudding that I forgot how good it is. This recipe was a great and easy way to use up my leftover rice. I used an estra half teaspoon of vanilla and sprinkled the pudding with cinnamon before serving. Very yummy!

I've made this rice pudding several times and it's wonderful. I use 2% milk and use the same pot  to cook the pudding in as I cooked the rice in.  The one thing I've noticed is that any time I've ever cooked rice, it seems to only take about 10 minutes to absorb the water, even though I cook it on low heat.

long-grain rice can be used if you simmer it in extra water. also, a dash of cinnamon and/or nutmeg is nice. Great recipe!

This rice pudding is better than my grandma used to make!  Super easy and tastes delicious!  After making it as directed I have made a few changes based on other reviews as well as personal preference.  When boiling the water I add the butter and salt, once the rice is cooked, I continue to use the same pot.  In a seperate bowl I beat the egg and sugar together (and I use brown sugar instead of white) then add the add'l 1/2 c. of milk.  I have tried adding warm mixture to bowl as well as just adding the egg mixture to the pot, I haven't had any problems with the egg cooking by just adding it into the pot (I just slowly pour it in and stir at the same time).  I also use 1 cup of dark raisins (personal preference).  My husband likes this so much I now make it twice a week to send him in his lunch everyday, he enjoys it both hot or cold.

I used 1/3 cup light brown sugar, and used an 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon and a tablespoon of honey in addition to the 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  First ever attempt, will definitely make again.

WOW Thank-you for sharing this recipe!!! I have NEVER liked rice pudding as a kid but I was browsing rice recipe's and came across this. It had VERY HIGH reviews So I decided to try it and it was NOTHING I had ever tasted before. It was HEAVENLY. The only thing I did different was I used dried Cranberries instead of raisins because our family isn't a fan of them. I also added a little cinnamon. It was a HUGE hit. Thanks again!!!

Where did I go wrong?? I had left over rice so started this recipe on step 2. I didn't even add the remaining 1/2 cup of milk, and had to add instant tapioca because it was SOOOOO runny?? It just never thickened. Flavor was good, but soupy....so soupy. After the tapioca it was edible. I don't usually struggle in the cooking department. Hmmm, live and learn.

Great recipe! I made it exactly as the recipe says except I used xylitol instead of sugar (same amount). Topped it with cinnamon and tried not to eat ALL of it at once. So good and easy! I don't think I will need to try another rice pudding recipe; this one is the bee's knees.

EXCELLENT!!!! I have been looking for a quick and scrumptious tasting rice pudding recipe, and this one has exceeded that. I did however, add 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. It came out perfect and I will definitely be making this again!! EXCELLENT!!

This is a very nice recipe.  I was online looking for creamy comfort food because my mother is having trouble swallowing due to radiation treatments.  This is nice and creamy and will be easy for her to swallow.  I will definately make it again.  Delicious !

Yum! However, if you use salted butter then do not add extra salt. Other than that, this is very, very good. I used basmati since I already had some made.

This recipe is by far the best I've tried. Hint: use short grain rice. Though medium grain works pretty well, the short grain will yield smoother and creamier results.  I followed this recipe to the letter (with the exception of the raisins since I don't care for them) and the results were great. The hardest thing for me will be to not eat every last bit!

I tried this recipe with half a cup of rice and 2 eggs and got a good result for cold rice pudding. I don't like it warm either. Don't forget to stir regularly so the mild does not boil over and to mix the eggs with the rest of the milk before adding them, so they would not cook. Thanks for the recipe :)

Since I am now dairy free, I substituted the milk for vanilla soy milk and omitted adding the vanilla at the end. Very good!

Yumm! I used leftover coconut rice (3 cups cooked short grain with 6 oz of coconut milk stirred in after cooking) so I used 1.5 cups of 1% milk and then 3/4cup of coconut milk with the egg. Yum yum yum.

Just made this and my son's friend said tastes like the rice porridge his Jamaican grandmother makes and she would definitely eat it. Very high complements!!! Super easy to make. Used leftover short grain rice and omitted the raisins.

Really easy and super YUM! Had TONS of rice on hand and this was a perfect way to get rid of some. I doubled  the recipe and used long grain rice.. Still ended out perfect.. Not too sweet either. Great with cinnamon :D Defiantly a keeper

My  20 month old son has a GI virus.  The Pediatrician recommended rice in his diet.  I made this recipe using Lactaid instead of regular milk.  It turned out perfect.  It was tasty, but not overly sweet.

I found this recipe amazing. But I did cut down the amount of sugar to about 1/4 cup (not even) instead. This made it even better for the original recipe was a little too sweet and made me sick of it very easily.

I love this -- it's super easy and delicious.  I got a late start so I didn't read through the reviews before making it (practically unheard of for me!). I just made it as written, sans raisins, and am eating it warm with a sprinkle of cinnamon as I type.  Mmmmm...

Added the salt and a cinnamon stick to the rice while it cooked. Only used one pan, used skim milk. Cooked as it said (making sure to temper the egg), but found it needed something more. So I ended up adding more sugar and vanilla. Delicious and creamy. Prefer it cold so I had to wait for it....so hard!

This is the best rice pudding.  I have to say I did use the risotto rice to make it creamier, and used dried cranberries in lieu of raisins, but OH SO GOOD!

I made the rice as directed, added the milk suggested and 3/4 cup of sugar.  this is for a batch that is almost twice the amt. produced if you take out 1-1/2 cups of rice and make it in another pan.  I put 2 eggs in and NO more milk.  Nice and quick and very thick. Aless pans to wash and no extra rice to use up later.

This rice pudding was so easy to make and tasted delicious! The only change I made was that I added cinnamon to the end result. I will be trying it with half and half the next time because I will be making this recipe again.

Excellent recipe. I made it for my first time & it turned out great & I'm no cook.  I was happy with the texture of the rice just by following the recipe.  I will be making this again and doubling the recipe only next time I plan to add cinnamon (now sure just how much, maybe only a pinch).  With the cinnamon I know this recipe will be 6 stars :)  Thanks for sharing this one.

OMG! This is a fabulous and super easy recipe to make.  My husband & I don't care for raisins so I omitted them.  I took everyone's advise and cut the sugar in half.  Didn't think it was sweet enough so I'll add the full amount the next time.  Definitely one to repeat!

This is an excelent recipe. I have been enjoying my moms Rice Pudding my whole life, and besides moms, this is by far the best i've had. I often find myself with left over rice from dinner, so its easy to throw together some Creamy Rice Pudding for dessert.

Perfect! I made according to the directions but without the raisins (personal preference), and I did as others suggested and put some of the warm mixture in with the egg to bring the temperature up.

the pudding turned out bad because when i added the egg in the lat 2 mins, it cooked right away and i had chunks of it floating around!!  maybe it has potential, i mean like...look at the reviews and subscribers!....we'll see, next time maybe i'll throw the egg in at the begining

This was so good and easy too.  I usually bake mine but wanted to try something different.  So much better than the other recipe I "used to" use.  This will be my go to recipe from now on.  Hubby loved it too and if it passes his judgement with flying colors, you know it is good.

Good creamy rice pudding. Husband loved it. His taste required more sugar so added double. Also used a vanillia bean. Very easy too.

How do you know this is an AMAZING recipe?!?!?... Because even with my (accidentally) burnt rice... it still tasted like pure heaven. I loved it absolutely. I skipped the raisins only because i never was a fan of them and i also added a tad of cinnamon. Delicious and incredibly simple! Thanks :)

This is delicious! I used heavy cream instead of milk and added some cinnamon, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It's awesome! I will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe. I've never been good at rice pudding and had to use corn starch to get it to set. This recipe is idiot proof and turns out soooo yummy.

I just love it!!! Great recipe!
My only variations: added salt to the boiling water, mixed the egg with the 1/2 cup of milk and the vanilla and then added it a bit at the time to the pan while stirring until all of it was incorporated.  Also skipped the butter and added a bit of coconut.
This is probably the easiest and the tastiest rice pudding recipe I ever made.
Thank You Erica G.!!! :)

This recipe is so much like my grandmother's, I couldn't help but to love it when I made it.  It hs that old time flavor that brought back memories of when I was a little girl helping mom make this pudding.

Only thing I did different was I added the vanilla in while the custard was cooking to get more flavor from into the dish itself and used slightly less butter.

This has become a great dessert and a great breakfast when there's not much else to make.  I always have rice, eggs, and milk so this has become a staple.

This is a good easy recipe.  I found it just as easy to use all the rice and adjust the water - approx. 2 cups.  At the end, after the egg mixture is added, I also adjusted the milk for the creamy texture.  I added approx. 3 T. of milk at the end.  It turned out very creamy.  I will still try to improve this one, maybe an additional egg would make it richer.

So good. I had to make this with almond milk instead of cow's milk since we are allergic but it was so creamy and delicious! I'm not really sure why the recipe called to use two sauce pans but I used the same sauce pan and it came out wonderful.

BEST RICE PUDDING RECIPE!  Every other rice pudding recipe I have tried is good at first but when you refrigerate the left overs, it loses its creaminess and gets dried out.  This one stays creamy!  My family loved it.  This one is a keeper!

AMAZING! I love rice pudding, and this is the best I have ever had! I did change it a little, by increasing the sugar to 1/2 cup and skipping the raisins.  I also cooked the rice in my rice cooker instead of on the stove, then just started out with the warm rice from there.  I used Jasmine rice, and it came out wonderfully.  I would recommend stirring constantly during the entire cooking time, as it seems it could burn or scald easily.  After the egg and milk are added, it is worth a few extra minutes on the heat stirring constantly for thicker, creamier results. Pour into serving dishes immediately and let cool for a few minutes before serving warm, with whipped topping, if desired. Enjoy!

We love this recipe. I have always thought grinding my rice in a coffee grinder before making rice pudding makes it creamier and better.  This recipe is especially good if you add ripe mango chunks over top before eating!

I LOVED this recipe! One thing I would recommend, though, is trying rice milk instead of regular milk for a really great added flavor.  I would suggest Rice Dream, which is made from organic brown rice and has an ultra smooth texture.  (and a bonus of being rich in calcium and enriched with vitamins)! So if you want to sneak something wholesome and tasty into this delicious dessert, go with the rice milk

I've been making this recipe since I found it in 2008 and for some reason never reviewed it before. Awesome recipe, so easy & delicious. I make my rice in a rice cooker, everything else the same. Oh, except I find that I don't need the butter. Sometimes I use regular (not golden) raisins, or omit them. This is my go-to stovetop rice pudding recipe! Thanks so much for sharing this, Erica!!!!

SOOO WONDERFUL... My two children, ages 1 and 3 LOVED it as well... I added normal raisins, and also added some Cinnamon and Nutmeg, it was so excellent, I just can't get over how wonderfully yummy it was... I'll try it again when my husband is home, he says he doesn't care for Rice Pudding, but I think he would love this!!! Thanks for the recipe... Definately a keeper!!!

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have golden raisins so I used standard brown raisins and used Arborio rice and 2% milk. It reminds me of my Grandma's rice pudding. Yum!

Great recipe, just one suggestion, use whole milk.  I used 1% the first time and it didn't come out as creamy.  I've had that problem with other custard like recipes-should have known better.  I also grated a bit of nutmeg on the top...yum!

This is my first attempt at this kind of rice pudding.  I have made the baked kind but I had leftover rice and wanted rice pudding.  This was very good.  I didn't add the salt since my leftover rice already had salt in it.  I left out the raisins this time since my bunch usually likes things plain.

Delicious! If you want to use cooked brown rice - cook rice in milk for 15 minutes, puree mixture using stick blender, con't cooking for 2 more minutes and then con't with recipe adding egg, etc. I also used maple syrup.

Delicious, quick, and easy! A great way to use left-over rice -- I just used the cooked rice left over from our dinner and followed step 2. Excellent!

Despite all the warnings I used long grain rice (it's all i had). I added an extra 1/2 cup of water to the raw rice and cooked it for an extra 8 or so minutes, till it was mush. I haven't tried making this with a shorter grain, but thought the end result was OUTSTANDING with the long grain! This was delicious and very reminiscent of Christmas for us. The recipe made just enough for my DH and our 2 kids (4&2yrs). It does not make very much and I find myself wanting more....*sigh* although it's probably a good thing it made no more.

I made this for my son who just returned from Afghanistan as he was craving it. It was amazing. Thank you for sharing. I followed the posts that suggested medium grain rice and to usevthe same saucepan. It turned out perfectly. A definite keeper!!!

Perfect!  Thick, creamy and wholesome!  It took longer than the 15-20 min. to get it thick and creamy but it could be because I used brown rice.  My husband usually doesn't like rice pudding and he liked it too!

Wonderful! I tripled the recipe to feed a crowd with no problem.  I used half skim and half whole milk.  I've never made rice pudding before - and didn't really care for it myself until I had this - Yummy!

This is wonderful.  I did add salt when cooking the rice.  I used Basmati rice based on another recipe I read.  I did not add raisins (I don't like them).  I will make this again.
Thanks for a great recipe.

I made it as written but took the suggestions of using medium grain rice, tempering the egg, and adding a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg at the end. It's excellent!

This was really, really good and the only pudding I've made so far that came out how it should have. I added cherry flavored craisins instead of plain raisins. ( My mom's idea.) Best served warm!

I am an experienced cook, but today I was tired and neglected to read the recipe thoroughly.   I also ended up not having enough cooked rice so I filled in with instant rice.    Worked like a charm.    I didn't beat the egg separately, I beat it in the pan and dumped everything else in with it.    I thought Oh! Oh!   Now I'm in trouble.  

 I just cooked everything all at once and it turned out super, super good.     I added about 3/4 tsp. cinnamon.    You can bet I will make this again.

This was awesome! I made sure to temper the egg with a bit of the hot milk mixture, which helped the egg not clump up. I used 1% milk for the first 1 1/2C of milk, then substituted light coconut milk for the last 1/2C of milk. I also added about 1/4C of shredded coconut when the raisins were added. Soooo good!!

Great recipe!  I hate dry rice pudding and this is just a great, creamy pudding.  The only thing I changed was that I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and a few shavings of nutmeg.  Thanks!

This isn't bad, I couldn't do it in the microwave though, for whatever reason it just wasn't happening for me. Being short of ingredients and 9 months pregnant and desperate for Rice Pudding I tried again. Second time I did it stove top and wouldn't you know it turned out great! I ran out of sugar the second time around and used brown sugar instead, YUMMY! I love this! Life saver!!

Excellent recipe! Will certainly be making this more often. I used some leftover Jasmine rice. I also omitted the butter (didn't need it) & added some cinnamon. Was quite sweet so I think next time I'll cut back a little on the sugar. I will also try using soy or almond milk next time for my milk-allergic daughter. I may even try omitting the egg as well. I think it will still taste just as good & be just as creamy.

Hi, I followed everything to the T, but this recipe didnt work for me. I dont know where went wrong, I used only 1/4 cup sugar - still too sweet, I used 1 medium size egg - still taste eggy. I followed other reviewers suggestion, waited till I get the consistency that I want than add sugar. But still. Maybe it's me. Will try again, one day, when the frustration is over.

This delivered way more than I expected.  Seemed too simple to be of mention but have to say the result blew me away.  I made a few changes just to make my life more difficult:  Used 1/4 cup white sugar and 2 Tbsp dark brown sugar.  Heated the milk, sugars and salt until fully dissolved and then added hot cooked rice.  I also tempered the egg before incorporating (out of habit) and I think that really helped the consistency.  Finished with vanilla and cinnamon.  Omitted the raisins and subbed some hot apple slivers cooked in brown sugar and butter.  Absolutely loved the base recipe.  Thanks for this!

This was really yummy. I don't like really sweet things & this was the perfect amount of sweetness. I've had good rice pudding before, but i have to say this has to be one of my favorites. I added a little sprinkle of nutmeg on top, and it just made it 10x better! Definitely will try again.

I was a little impatient, so during step #2, I only "cooked over medium heat" for 10 minutes, then omitted the last 1/2 cup of milk.  It still came out looking and tasting like the best rice pudding I've ever had.

Tried this with an '8 kinds of rice' as an experiment and even though the colour is purplish, tastes great!  Have made this a few times and always satisfied. Did use less sugar than the recipe calls for

This was the first time I've ever made rice pudding and I loved it! I didn't have raisins so I used Craisins and an apple instead. Also, I'm not big on vanilla and only added the tiniest little drop, but that's just my taste. I'll definitely make it again.

I love this site since you get to read the reviews of the people who actually tried the recipe. Reading their thoughts helped me make this pudding a five-star winner in my house. I used Arborio Rice and cooked it with the salt, as it is hard to season grains after they are cooked. I used slightly more sugar as well; that is our family's preference. Top this off with a sprinkling of cinnamon sugar and nutmeg and it doesn't last more than one night in our house! Thanks SO much Erica G. for sharing this keeper!

Excellent recipe save for one thing I found that it was much too thin and runny, next time I won't add the extra half cup of milk. Other than that, great!

So creamy.  I've made this before, following the recipe exactly, and it came out the way I hoped it would.  This time, I had left over heavy cream which I used instead of the 1/2 cup of whole milk and butter that is added towards the end.  It was even better; more creamy and silky.

Amazing. I skip the raisens because they are gross. I love this recipe and it has worked 6 times perfectly. I also add a lot of cinnamon.  I also use long grain rice, and I love the texture even though most people say to use a shorter grain. It's even better the next day.

This was my first time making rice pudding and this recipe did NOT dissappoint!  I had about 3/4 cup of leftover coconut milk from dinner the other night and I mixed that in with the regular milk.  I also didn't add the raisins and used only 1/4 cup of sugar.  I am already on my second helping!

Excellent! I liked it with the amount of sugar called for. I also followed instructions to use short or medium grain rice and test the rice for doneness before adding sugar. And I added vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

I just made this and it came out perfect! Worked well with short grain brown rice, which I steamed. Also used low-fat milk, splenda and 1/2 the butter...Very thick and satisfying...yummm!

I'm Lactose intolerant.  So I used Vanilla Soymilk instead of regular milk.  It came out great!  Although, I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup because the soymilk is already very sweet.  I also reduced the vanilla to 1/4 teaspoon because the soymilk already tastes like vanilla.  I also put a stick of cinnamon while it cooked with the milk and the sugar and the salt.  I actually tried the recipe twice and succeeded on the 2nd try.  The first time I made two fatal mistakes.  The first one being that the rice was not cooked throughly and it was too hard for a pudding consistency.  So make sure you cook the rice enough so that its tender.  The other was that I let the rice cook with the milk too long and it was WAY too thick.  I believe the reason you have to use two pots is because you don't want the rice that gets a little crunchy on the bottom of the pot to be a part of the pudding.  It's an easy recipe with a delicious outcome!  Enjoy!

I've made this rice pudding twice so far and it's great.  I used glutinous sweet rice (available in Asian stores and it's great because it is meant to be slightly sticky and gluey) both times and left out the egg.  The first time I soaked the raisins in rum and it was great! This is a great versatile recipe.

I used left over rice from a Chinese restaurant, added a little lemon zest and it was superb!  I didn't even have to call Mom for her advise.  Quick, easy and so tasty!

Just OK.  Mine was creamy when hot but became very pasty when cooled, which is how I prefer to eat it.  I also needed to add a lot more vanilla and some cinnamon to give it more flavor.

Gonna try again. My rice wasn't very soft and it could use a little more cinnamon. It's a good base to start with.

Yum!  Followed everyone else's suggestions and it turned out great.  I measured my cooked rice and had rice left over.  I also doubled the recipe and I am glad I did.

I made this pudding and it came out great. The only thing I did different was add a little extra sugar. I have a sweet tooth. It will be a regular for me. Thanks Fairyqueen

This was my first time cooking rice pudding. I liked this recipe because it didn't require baking it in the oven. Warning to some, I became sidetracked after putting the egg into the mix. you MUST stir immediately after you put it in to avoid scrambled eggs!  The only thing I did differently was that I added cinnamon and nutmeg to taste, added about 1/8 teaspoon more of vanilla, and topped it with whip cream and sprinkled cinnamon. Delicious! will DEFINITELY be using this recipe again, all my family members keep asking for it!

Pretty good.  I think it could have been creamier though.  After chilling in the refrigerator overnight, it was a bit too thick for my liking.  I loved the flavour though, it was spot on!

This was incredible! I was craving rice pudding, and I happened to have all the ingredients! I used basmati rice, and even though I agree that other, shorter grain rice might be better, it was still amazing with basmati! Also, I used part soy milk, part normal milk.  Great recipe!

Yum, Yum! This was very good. I did have to cook the milk, rice, sugar, and salt for about 25 minutes to get it to thicken. I used skim milk, so maybe that is why.

I have never made rice pudding or any pudding of that sort in my life. My husband loves rice pudding. I thought I would try it and it was very easy to make...and delicious. I would recommend this recipe to anyone. Thanks for posting. I now have this written in my cook book.

This is an excellent recipe! Super easy and delicious. My husband was extremely happy with this and I was happy that it was cheap and easy to make :)  I did not add raisins but otherwise followed the recipe and it was fantastic.

This was very good and easy recipe, thanks for sharing it.  I used 1 1/2 cups of leftover white rice instead of instead of uncooked rice since I wanted to get rid of leftovers.  I also took another reviewers advice and added the vanilla in beginning with the milk. I substituted chopped pistachios for raisins because I don't like raisins.

This is the one.  Excellent rice pudding recipe.  Easy to make, right consistency, not too sweet, and as one reviewer noted ensuring the rice is cooked before adding the sugar ensure top quality results.

This recipe is always good. I've made it several times now with different milks, rices, spices, whatever I have on hand (but ALWAYS with delicious golden raisins!). Every time I make it, it comes out wonderfully.

Very Good.  Definitely need the medium grain rice.  Definitely need to add sugar AFTER rice is completely done.  Add some of the warm milk to egg before adding the egg.  I like to add cinnamon.

My first time making rice pudding though I have made the Indian version quite ofen, which is made without eggs. I used jasmine rice. Cooked the rice in skim milk instead of water and added more skim milk later as the recipe says. And I only used the egg white of one egg. Great recipe!

I doubled the recipe, used half and half, used leftover coconut milk rice, added cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg....totally forgot the vanilla...omg...this rice is the bomb!!! My mom always baked hers in the water bath so you got more of a custard and the rice settles to the bottom. This recipe far surpasses the old fashioned kind...nothin but creamy, flavorful yumminess!!!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I substituted half the milk with half and half and added about 1 1/2 tbsp of butter pecan coffee creamer...just for fun. But did everything else the same. I don't think there is another rice pudding recipe out there that could top this!

Fantastic and easy!  It was creamy and tasted just like my mom makes :)  The only thing I did different is used my rice cooker to cook the rice but it still tasted great.  If you use your rice cooker though make sure and omit the salt from either the cooker or the saucepan as I forgot the first time and it was quite salty.

I had some left over cooked Jasmine rice and was craving a quick and easy rice pudding. This recipe is very quick and delicious. I waited to add the sugar until I added the second part of the milk and beaten egg then I stirred on low for about 10 minutes more instead of only 2 min like the original recipe calls for. It turned out so creamy and rich. I substituted cinnamon since I didnt have any nutmeg on hand. 5 stars for sure. I will be making this again when the weather cools down.

This was an incredible recipe to start off with.  I did make a few slight changes.  I added 2 teaspoons of cornstarch and about 2/3 cup sugar.  When adding the egg I didn't add it directly to the mixture, I added the hot liquid and whisked it then poured the egg mixture into the rest of the pudding.  It was to die for!

Delicious!  I used dinner's left-over brown rice to make dessert.  I also followed the recommendations to wait to add the sugar, and to warm up the egg mixture before adding it to the pudding.  My husband devoured it, and now we always make extra rice!

This is amazing rice pudding.  We used Half and Half and milk to make it even richer.

Fabulous. Used short grain rice, real vanilla and grated nutmeg. Likely the quality of the vanilla and nutmeg added to the end product. Thumbs up from everyone except son - raisins are not on the list of likes right now I guess. Otherwise he enjoyed. I am on my second bowl. Definately will remake. Thanks for sharing!

First time trying to make rice pudding and it worked out great! I did substitute evaporated milk like someone suggested and it turned out very tasty. I did use a rice cooker versus boiling and found the consistency just right. Great recipe, thanks so much. WAM

I loved this rice pudding.  I couldn't find medium grain rice so I used Sushi rice and cooked the rice in my rice cooker.  I used skim milk and added cinnamon at the end with the vanilla and butter.  It came out very creamy.  I will make this again

I made a small change--substituted about 3/4 of a cup of coconut milk leftover from a pie for an equal amount of the regular milk.  It cooked up just fine but with an interesting hint of coconut :)  I used short grain rice and the cook times shown were too long, so make sure to watch well if you use it too!  I gave it 4 stars because next time I would put a little more salt to play up the flavors more or follow the other reviewers advice to cook the rice in salted water.  I wouldn't call it the best rice pudding but it is a quick and easy dessert that comes together from items I have in my cupboard, so it's a keeper for me!

This is so good.. I had rice left over from dinner and didn't want to be wasteful so I threw together this recipe omitting the raisans due to the lack of them in my house.. This was so yummy and a great dessert after stir fry... Thank you for sharing..

Very tasty and simple rice pudding. I used basamati rice and it was wonderful following the recipe. I tasted it after I made it and loved it. Then I thought I would add a sprinkle of chinese five spice and that was good as well. Either way, very very good. This is a keeper. I passed this along to my daughter who loves rice pudding.

This was awesome.  I was a little nervous it might be past my skill level, because I always seem to mess up milk on the stove really bad.  But, it came out without a hitch.

I really love this recipe because you don't have to bake it. Most recipes you have to bake the rice pudding for in some case 2hrs. I don't have that kind of time and this tastes exactly the same.

This is my go-to recipe for rice pudding. It has never NOT turned out. I have made it exactly as written and it turns out delicious. I have also tweaked it a little. We use fat-free milk at our house, so that is what I have on hand. It can make the pudding a bit anemic and not set up as much as I like(but still great). I started using half fat-free milk and half evaporated milk. It definitely gives it a smoother, richer texture and taste. Before I tried this recipe, I tried about 10 different rice pudding recipes. This is fool-proof and I will never have to try another rice pudding recipe again.

Excellent tasting recipe.  I also added cinnamon to the recipe and omited the raisins.  I would also recommend tempering the egg mixture to prevent the mixture from scrambling.  My daughter thought this was great.  I liked it because it was quick and easy enough especially if you already have leftover rice.  I will always make extra rice so I will have an excuse to make this.  YUMMY!!!

Yummy!  I haven't had an American version of rice pudding in a LONG time, so this was a nice way to get reacquainted.   I used the rice that was left over from making Lola's Horchata (on this site), which already had a cinnamon-y flavor, so that added a little kick to the pudding.  I also had to use egg substitute to keep the cholesterol as low as possible.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as given.  I'm sure I'll be making this every time I make the horchata (can't stand to waste perfectly good rice!)

wowzers. this recipe is far greater than my mom's! i just finished eating a bowl and love it! i accidentally only used 1/2 c of rice in the beginning so i didn't use the remaining 1/2 c of milk and it still turned out fantastic. very rich and creamy and totally worth it.

This is a very nice recipe and it is very forgiving. I had to use sushi rice, it is what we eat at home. I had no fresh milk so had to use non-fat dry milk. I added cottage cheese to get some fat into the milk. Had to use two cups of rice, didn't want to waste any leftovers so used two cups of milk as well. With all the adjustments it was still delicious. Next time I might just skip the egg and butter. It was pretty delish even before they were added.

very good but I used less sugar (2 oz) then required and it was still too sweet. I would probably put 1/2 of that in the future...

This was super simple to make. I used 1% milk, and it still came out very rich. I subbed regular raisins for the golden and brown rice for white , added some cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg but otherwise made it as written (remembering to temper the eggs before adding them to the full pot). We had it for breakfast....mmmmm....warm and creamy and, oh, so tasty. My girls complained it was too rich!!! What a problem to have! :) Thanks for a great recipe. We will be having this again.

This is absolutely delicious Erica. I made this and I decided to add just a hint more sugar and poured just a dash of vanilla in half way through the second cook time just so that the rice could soak up some of that vanilla taste. It turned out amazing and have gotten a great reaction from my family. Thank you so much for this recipe. This is surely a keeper!

There used to be a little rice pudding shop near us that was delicious but SO expensive. I have been trying to replicate the creamy pudding for 4-5 years now and this is so close!  I LOVE this recipe and will make it for years to come.  THANK YOU for ending my search for the perfect rice pudding recipe!

Pretty good.  I ended up adding more milk, sugar & vanilla in the end & omitted the raisins because we were out.  I didn't add the egg because I've made it before with egg and didn't care for it.  Overall this was fairly quick & easy.  I served it with a sprinkling of cinnamon.

I used 2% milk and got an excellent result. I do like my rice pudding cold though, so when I made it for 8 servings, I used one large egg, and increased the milk I used at the end by 1/2 a cup. Kept it creamier.

This was excellent.  I did add a bit more sugar and added some extra vanilla and some cinnamon/sugar mix to it and omitted the raisins.  The picky kids really liked it.  Great recipe.

I made this recipe for my husband and I have to say that I've never tasted Rice Pudding quite like this before, and I mean this in a very, very good way.  Kudos!!

GOOD RECIPE! I made a few changes. I used condensed milk instead of regular milk and sweetened condensed milk in addition to sugar. I also infused the milk with a cinnamon stick, nutmeg, and anise. It gave it a nice flavor.

This recipe is FANTASTIC.  I would give this recipe 100 stars if I could!  The only change I made is I used 2% milk and a bit less sugar.  Kinda like one of those moments where I turned into a kid again saying mmmmmmmmm after every spoonful.  Yum.

This recipe was super easy. I used brown rice for a nutty flavor. I also used French Vanilla Coffee Mate creamer in place of 1/2 the milk. YUM. I am making it again today.

This recipe is excellent, it is definitely my favorite desert.  This may be a matter of personal taste, but I strongly recomment trying dried cherries instead of raisins, and some black walnuts!  Trust me, this alteration is the ultimate!

Such a great recipe to augment and make healthy without loosing and taste!  Substitute brown rice for the white rice.  Substitute 8 tsp xylitol and 1/8-1/4 tsp pure stevia extract (Kal brand is by far the best, and the only brand I will use) for the sugar.  Use 1% milk  Substitute 1/4 cup egg white (cage free! - Trader Joe's) for regular egg.  Substitute Smart Balance Light or Brummell & Brown for the butter.  The cooking time for brown rice will take twice as long.  Make sure the rice is cooked really well.  Xylitol and stevia are non-chemical natural sweeteners.  Far better for you than Splenda and the others.

This is the best rice pudding I have ever had. I am converting from oven baked to stovetop rice pudding from now on, because the texture of this was so perfect. The flavor is just right without anything extra added- though I omitted the raisins out of personal preference. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I just made this with brown basmati rice!  Amazing. Has the texture of barley or oatmeal.  It takes longer, 50 min for the rice.  20 mins with the milk and half the sugar (i found 1/3 c sickeningly sweet), then I let it sit on simmer 5 min.  I just add the egg, no more milk, and raisins.  After stirring I added the vanilla, bit of cinnamon, bit of cloves.
A quarter tsp of brown sugar would be yummy one served.

I'm not a big rice pudding fan, but this is a good one!  I used brown jasmine rice and cooked it about 5 minutes longer - just until the water was absorbed.  I also added the salt and butter at the beginning instead of later.  No need for a second pan, just add the milk (skim) and sugar to the cooked rice.  I also used Craisins instead of raisins.  Finally I sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar.  The brown rice makes for a slightly chewier texture, but a MUCH healthier rice pudding.

I use this recipe as a guideline and skip the eggs/raisins. Sometimes I substitute dried cranberries (soaked in warm milk). I love a sprinkle of cinnamon or apple pie spice.

Awesome recipe ! I have made this rice pudding 3 times now. The first time I made this recipe was the first time I'd ever made any rice pudding. After adding the egg and milk mixture at the end, I cooked it until it was a thick, creamy consistency (the consistency I thought it would stay at). What I didn't know was that it continues to thicken after you stop cooking ! It turned out like oatmeal once cooled. The next two times I made it I added the egg and milk mixture to the rice mixture and only cooked it for 2 minutes and shut it off immediately! It thickened to the perfect consistency during the cooling stage. I made this recipe for the third time today, however again it was a little too thick after cooling for about 15 minutes. I added a bit of milk and sugar to thin it out and it turned out great !

This recipe was very easy, tasty, and flexible.  I used leftover plain couscous instead of cooking rice which cut the time to make this in half.  Also I used Vanilla Almond Milk and Vanilla Soy Milk for a non-dairy version. I wasn't sure if that would be too much vanilla combined with the extract, but it was totally fine.  I used a little less sugar than called for,  it didn't seem necessary.   Overall a very nice and easy recipe.

This recipe is wonderful! Add a little nutmeg to the finished product and it = amazing :) This is now my base recipe for rice pudding. I however usually make it with brown rice. Great way to use leftovers!   3/4 cup uncooked rice = about 1 1/2 cups cooked :)

I love rice pudding but have never made it before so I thought I would give it a try.  This is such an easy recipe and oh my is it yummy!!  I actually substituted heavy cream for the last 1/2 cup of milk and if you like super thick and creamy you will love it!  Next time I will just use milk for the whole recipe but I had cream so I had to try it :)

Delicious! I made this exactly as the recipe called for, and used skim milk. It turned out fantastic. My 1 year old daughter thought it was fantastic, and my hubby liked it too. I put cinnamon and nutmeg on top and it worked in nicely so it had that nice homey flavor.

best rice pudding I ever made! make sure to use short grain rice for the creamiest texture. I use 1 cup raw rice and 1 can of evaporated milk for the 1 1/2 cups of milk, I added cinnamon and nutmeg as well. I temper the egg as well by adding some of the hot rice mixture into it, whisking it until warm then adding to the pot, with the pot off the heat.

Great simple recipe, props to the poster. Brings back memories. Having never made it before I was glad to see that it was so easy. I made one change, use Jasmine Rice. Much creamier and silky.

This is my most-used recipe from allrecipes.  Every week I save any leftover rice from meals and make a batch of this rice pudding.  I usually skip the butter step at the end.  And often I add nutmeg - a memory of childhood rice pudding.  Once I added dried mango.  But it is hard to beat the original with raisins.  Excellent!

Nice and creamy! I had to make a few substitutions though.  I used brown rice because I didn't have any white rice and I added the salt to the rice as it was simmering.  I also used almond milk because I'm sensitive to dairy, but it was not thickening as it should so i had to add a tablespoon of flour (would have used cornstarch if I had it). I also decided to use evaporated skim milk for the last half cup because it wasn't creamy enough. I also traded out the sugar for splenda.  I didn't have any raisins to add but it was still good. I also added cinnamon, nutmeg, and extra vanilla to try and mask the flavor of the brown rice. Very good recipe.  Next time I will use white rice and raisins though!

Erica, thank you for the lead on this recipe. Being that I’m Cuban and that I’ve had the opportunity to have Arros con Leche from a child to adulthood, believe it or not, I wasn’t sure how to achieve the right consistency since I wanted to make it different. My mom and sister’s version is good, but a bit runny and too sweet. With your recipe, I was able to achieve a real rich consistency that really brought out the flavors.  Rice in a Cuban household is a staple, like is potato to Americans. Normally, we use leftover rice to start rice pudding, as rice pudding is considered move of an afterthought or a very inexpensive comforting desert…I on the other hand started with cooking my medium grain rice in my rice cooker. I made about two cups of rice and I did salt it (two table-spoons) and as well added about (two table-spoons) of canola oil. After my rice was ready, (wet and fluffy) I transferred the rice to a pot, added about two cups of 2 percent organic milk and 2 cups of unprocessed sugar. String constantly, 5 minutes later I added the raisins and then added another half a cup of milk and the vanilla and one teaspood of cinnamon. Now having the right rich consistency, separately I whipped up one egg and added another third cup of milk to the egg…whipping to a milky substance, and then folding it into the rice pudding while still cooking. I did not use the butter, but frankly I just didn’t feel it needed it. Wow, what a finish! I loved it!  Thank you again! Tony

Wow. Just wow. I haven't made rice pudding since middle school, but there's an empanada shop near my work that makes the most delish version, so I had to see if I could do it at home. I used this recipe with sushi rice, a couple cinnamon sticks, and about a teaspoon of ground cardamom. It was dreamy, and just like the restaurant version! The other comments about tempering the cooked rice mixture with the egg-milk mixture are crucial. I can't thank you enough Erica!

I have taken the receipe and actually dropped the sugar (used Splenda) and used skim milk instead of regular milk, left out the raisins and the butter but added 1 tsp artifical vanilla.  I have fine tuned this and it is delicious.  I make it for 100 people or 2 people just knowing when to do what is the real secret, but I have it cut down to 120 calories per serving.  Much easier to eat and cheat then

Delicious....I now have a recipe for our leftover rice from Chinese Take-Out !!!  It worked perfectly.  I didn't have raisins so I used craisins - and it was very tasty!  Thank You for sharing this recipe.

Super easy, even for someone who has never made rice pudding and doesn't know how it's supposed to look, taste or smell. I made vegetarian nori rolls for dinner and had a lot of left over rice (which had some rice vinegar in it) and so I tried this recipe, knowing that the vinegar might ruin it. But it turned out great!! Couldn't even tell that there had been vinegar in the rice beforehand. I did skip the salt and increase the sugar just a tad since I was worried it wouldn't turn out. Great recipe!

this was good. I added caramel sauce and whipped cream to the top. I also used Splenda rather than sugar and only had skim milk. It would have been better with whole milk but thats all i would change next time i make it

This was DELICIOUS! I used short grain rice, skim milk, and Splenda although next time I will put a little extra Splenda in then the footnote says 1/3 of 1/3cup just wasn't enough. This produced thick and creamy goodness which my hubby and 20 month old daughter LOVED.  One note, add a little of the hot rice mixture to the beaten egg before adding the egg to prevent cooking it. Hit the road Kozy Shack! Thanx Erica G:)

The first time I made this rice pudding I didn't have any raisins, but I did have some dried cherries.  I cut them in half and used 2/3 cup.  I also used almond extract instead of vanilla.  SO DELICIOUS!  My husband and I ate the entire thing.  This is the only way I make it now and my husband requests it all the time!

We good recipe. I used long grain rice and the pudding came out delicious. The key is to make sure your rice is cooked the desired texture before you start adding the milk and sugar. I do disagree on the amount of sugar used. This recipe needed more than 1/3 cup of sugar. I added about 3 more TBsp of sugar.

This is the best one yet and I've tried several recipes. I noticed that after I seperated the cooked rice and added the milk and other ingredients, I only had to let it simmer for about 12 minutes and it was done. Other than that, everything seemed perfect. Highly reccommend!

Really good recipe, here's my tweaks: 1. Use Calrose (med-grain) rice, 2. Use 1 12-oz can no-fat condensed milk and 4oz no-fat regular milk, Smart Balance instead of butter. Egg optional -tastes better with egg but if you have issues with eggs then omitting it still produces a great result. Very easy, tasty, and healthy snack. Mix in some fresh organic blueberries just after you take off heat.

Really nice technique, and very creamy, as advertised!  Just one small suggestion: be SURE to use shorter grain rice, if you want it to be truly creamy.  The long grain will still be good, but less scrumptious.  :)

I made this for a dinner party, and everyone loved it! I had absolutely no left-overs. I only used one pot, it seemed silly to transfer the rice, and it turned out just fine.

Yummy! Serious comfort food. I mixed the egg & 1/2 c fat free half & half, so I wouldn't have scrambled eggs. Also mixed in 1/2 t cinnamon and 1/4 t fresh grated nutmeg

super good - perfect dessert for a cold winter's night. I added some cinnamon on top and even my husband who's "not a rice pudding guy" loved it.

Great way to use up left-over rice! I actually try to make extra rice just so I can cook this pudding. I don't add the raisins because my husband doesn't like them and it is sweet enough without.

Just tried a variation of this recipe tonight using skim evaporated milk and doubling all quantities to serve my huge tribe. Used arborio rice and stayed stirring the recipe almost constantly to prevent potential for sticking. Result was a thick custardy vanilla rice delight that was devoured in a flash - heated last addition of milk and the eggs to near simmer point before adding to main rice content to prevent egg scrambling and after draining rice reused the same larger pot. Suspect would be almost as good with regular skim milk cooked slightly longer - will cut down on sugar when making it next as the plump sultanas I used in place of raisins added a beautiful sweetness of their own (added sultanas at point of adding milk as I like them to be really plump). A very good recipe as is or for someone who has made this before a great one to tweak to your personal preference.

this is really good!  i made it a little more tricky by using 1% milk - oops, wasn't thinking - but it still turned out well.  i think i had to cook it a little longer though.

This is the recipe I use most out of all the recipes on the site! We use the leftover white rice from whenever we order Chinese takeout. The kids get excited about takeout night because of the rice pudding we make the day after. I only add cinnamon and nutmeg, this recipe is fantastic just the way it is.

I only had long grain rice, but I made this anyway. It is so good! Tastes just like the rice pudding I usually buy. I can't wait to make it with medium or short grain rice!

Made this today for the first time, but with a few changes.   I used med. gr sushi rice for the higher starch content, omitted the egg, salt, butter and a 1/2 cup of milk.  I also added a dash of pumpkin pie seasoning and cinnamon during the cooking.   Pudding came out FANTASTIC! Very smooth and creamy. Very quick and easy.   ....as a word of caution, it's best to stir constantly as the mixture will reach a boil and scald very quickly even on low heat.

Excellent recipe. I ended up running out of milk and used 1/2 a cup of half and half beaten in with the egg at the very end (still had the initial 1 1/2 cups of milk) and prefer it cold. Turned out with a custard consistency, but SO sweet and creamy. Will be using the half and half next time... who cares about calories when its this good lol. FANTASTIC RECIPE!

This was so good and creamy.  I have always made a baked rice pudding,  but this far exceeds that and is soo much more creamy and easier.  I used leftover cooked rice I had on hand.  Yummy way to use leftover rice that usually gets thrown away.  I made just as directed - but opted to leave out the raisins.  Thanks for the great recipe.

FOR MY REVIEW - Loved it, didn't have a lot of milk on hand so I used half cream/half milk - yes fattening but oh so delicious! Added the sugar when advised by author - perfect :) Thank you Erica for sharing!

Great! My whole family loves this recipe. I leave the raisins out because we are not raisin people. Sometimes I put 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Sometimes I make it with lowfat milk. My father was ill and had lost too much weight; So I made a batch with 1 & 1/2 c whole milk and 1/2 c whipping cream; even more creamy.

I cooked my rice in a rice cooker. I'm not good at cooking it on the stove. I like my rice pudding sweet and rich, so I added more suger and used whole milk. (on one batch I used half and half - it was great!) My husband LOVES Rice Pudding, and I had never made it before. My husband said it was the BEST rice pudding he had ever had! He asked me to make a double batch later that same day, and the day after I had to make ANOTHER double batch for him! I finally ran out of rice and my mother in law sent me a 15 lb bag so I could make it again! A definite hit!

This is a wonderful recipe! I did make a change, I added 1 can of evaporated milk (1.5 c.) and then 1/2 c. regular milk. That makes is a little sweeter and richer.  I don't like rasins so I left them out. I sprinkle a little cinnamon on top at the end and it's good to go!!

I think this turned out great!  I added sugar when rice was tender, and it worked well.  Also, I would use less than 1/3 cup last time.  At the end, with the egg, I added some vanilla, almond, and a bit of cinnamon extracts.  I would not use purple raisins again- too sweet- but may try golden.  Thanks!  This was delicious.  (2 servings for me.)

I nixed the raisins, and added cinnamon and nutmeg, and it was wonderful. It had a great creamy texture and full consistency. I served it hot, and than ate the leftovers for snack cold the next day. YUM!

First time making it and it was delicious. I don't like raisins though so I left those out. (Edit: Second time around I've reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4cup and found it perfect). Other than that, the steps were easy to follow and I was very happy with the results. Everyone who has tried it has loved it!

Pretty good recipe, although next time I will definately use less vanilla. I also added some of the warm milk to the beaten egg before I added it together to save the egg from scrmbling.

delicious rice pudding. I cooked it for a long time, and used whole milk, but it never got to the creamy consistency that I like it at. I may try adding heavy cream next time and see if that makes a difference. Otherwise, the flavors were terrific together and everyone loved it!

I have tried many times to make rice pudding and it never comes out.  This was excellent.  I did add a bit more vanilla.  It reminds me of tapioca pudding but with rice instead.

Perfectly creamy.  I made the rice in my rice maker and did not rinse the rice as I usually do since I knew I'd need the starchiness of the rice to thicken the pudding.  I used skim milk and added a bit of cinnamon when I added the milk & egg.  The result was great -- creamy and tasty!

Tasty basic recipe that is easy to make. This is a good base recipe for experimenting. If you are using skim milk like me, reduce the cooking time or the rice will stick to the bottom of the pan.  I added chopped dried cherries and crushed almonds.  The egg and butter is optional, but probably makes it more tasty.

This is the best rice pudding I've ever made. I only had long grain brown rice in the house and didn't want to wait until I could get white rice. I doubled the batch and used skim milk. I too added some cornstarch to the milk mixture. First I cooked the rice, then mixed up the eggs/milk/sugar/spices.(I used cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla) I decided to cook the milk until thick and then add to the rice, which worked quite well. Mmmm. It's yummy, creamy and I will make this recipe again!

Awesome! I must admit I hate raisins so I omitted them....Also used 1 1/2 cup homo milk & 1/2 cup 10% cream. A dash of cinnamon was my finishing touch.

This was very good. I like mine a little sweeter, but hubby does not, so the recipe was perfect for him as is.  The kids were reluctant to try this, but they really enjoyed it. I allowed them to eat it for breakfast the next day, and they got a kick out of that. "Dessert for breakfast!" ;)

this was great, i wanted to eat the whole thing in one sitting :) The amount of rice suggested produced a little over three cups of rice, so i just doubled the recipe.

I don't like rice pudding but I really liked this pudding. My husband adores rice pudding and I been trying for 10 years to find a recipe he will like but he hates everything. He only wants to eat Kozy Shack. I followed the directions perfectly, I changed nothing except I left out the raisins and I doubled the recipe. I made this with medium grain rice because I believe using long grain rice was one of my down falls to all the failed recipes of the past.  My husband tasted it on Christmas Day during dessert time when we were all stuffed and cookied out. He said he wasn't crazy about it - the next night however he had some and liked it the consitensy but he did say he wished it were sweeter. He ate it again the following night so I am going to say he liked it or he would never eat it again. So I gave it 4 stars because for a non-rice pudding lover I liked this recipe and he liked it not loved it. and that was better than anything I tried in all our ten years together! Thank you I do think this is a good recipe.

Wonderful!!! I did substitute sugar with sucanat and used an egg replacement product due to allergies in our household.  It was wonderful....did I already say that??!!  I also used a combo of whole/skim milk and thought the creaminess was perfect.  We had short grain rice on hand (leftovers, actually).  An easy way to make dessert...just make a bit of extra rice with dinner and use it up in this recipe!!  We also salted our rice when we cooked it.

Great recipe. We all loved it. Doubled the recipe and no leftovers in this house of 5. I used half canned milk and 1/2 regular and left over brown rice. Very good. Great way to use up leftover rice.

I liked it. I found it a bit soupy, but that's probably an error on my part. And I added in 1/2 cup of raisins that I had soaking in rum and a sprinkle of cinnamon and cloves. It tastes wonderful. Next time I'll be sure to not under cook the rice lol.

Fabulous recipe!  I made this with left-over rice, and used half-and-half, and left out the raisins because I didn't have any, but really it didn't need it.  Sprinkled  a little nutmeg on top.  I'm sure the next time I make rice I will be making a little extra to make this recipe again.

Very Good!  Having some left-over rice from dinner, I doubled this recipe and started at step 2 using 4 cups of cooked rice.  I used extra rice because I was using 2% milk and thought it would help to thicken it.  Also, I thought it would cut some of the sweetness.   After beating the eggs, I added them to the milk; then I slowly added the mixture to the pudding.  I topped each serving with cinnamon and served warm but it was just as good served cold.  Thank you Erica for sharing such a yummy recipe.

Sorry, but this was not the recipe I thought it would be. There was not much flavor so I added cinnamon (1 tsp) and nutmeg (1/4 tsp). My family likes their rice pudding cold and when I let it sit in the fridge first before serving, it lost all of it's creamy texture as the rice soaked up any remaining liquid and it became less of a pudding an more like rice.....I must have done something wrong in the cooking. Will try and again with some modifications and re-review it! Thanks!

Very good! I added about 1/4 tsp each of allspice and cinnamon. I also used a mix of white rice and wild rice. Cooked up nice and was REALLY yummy. Only thing I would change would be the amount of salt. 1/8 tsp would be enough for my taste.

This was so awesome. I loved it. I used some of the other reviewers tips. I tested the rice for tenderness before adding sugar. I used medium grain rice. I salted the water to cook the rice, and added butter in this step as well, instead of later. I also took some of the warm mixture and added it to the bowl with the milk and egg in it before adding it to the pot, to avoid the egg dropped effect as other reviewers have said.  I would like to know how to serve second day after it being in the fridge? It was not as creamy when I reheated, and was more lumpy. Any tricks would be appreciated.

I wish I could give this more than 5 starts. I have tried tons of rice pudding recipes over the years and couldn't find one I really liked. This is the only recipe i will ever use for rice pudding from now on. The only change I made was adding cinnamon to it when it was finished cooking and since it was for church the next morning it was served cold. I prefer it cold and thicker. Better than store bought! Thanks

I've never made rice pudding before and the directions were easy to follow.  It was just okay for me.  I guess that I'm just not a fan of rice pudding!  Also, I really didn't care for the raisins in it.

This is the first time I've made rice pudding and this was delicious!  I used left-over brown rice from dinner and it turned out great!  I took some of the previous suggestions and didn't add the egg directly into the pan, and I also added a little bit of cinnamon.  I will make this again and again!  Great recipe!

Really really good. I used a 12 oz can of evaporated milk for the cooking and also decided to mix the vanilla in with the egg and milk mixture.  One less step that way.  It rivals the diner's rice pudding that I get cravings for.

Consistency is great if you like thick pudding.  I like to add a little milk to my dish to thin it out.  I reduced the sugar to 25% of what recipe calls for.  Great base recipe.  Easy and simple.

Couldn't ask for a much easier recipe for rice pudding than this!  I was trying to make a healthier version so I used brown rice, skim milk, and used part white and part brown sugar.  It turned out great and better than you'd think with a brown rice.  I just made sure to cook the brown rice with a little extra water and cooked it until it was as tender as I wanted the final product, but it still soaks up some milk as well.  Per some other reviews, I also added the sugar later, and tempered the egg mixture with the cooking pudding.  I added a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon, and regular and golden raisins.  Wonderful!

Absolutely delicious! I used some leftover rice that I had from lunch. I added cinnamon. I did not add salt because my rice was salted when it was cooked earlier. I will be making this again.

This recipe was easy, easy, easy and it turned out delicious!  I replaced 1/2 cup of heavy cream for the last 1/2 cup of milk, added some orange peel for some extra flavor and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Thank you Erica G. for an easy rice pudding!

I had never made rice pudding before because my boys didn't like rice but I tried this recipe today and it is simply delicious.  It didn't thicken as quickly as I thought it should until I added the rest of the milk, the egg and the raisins.  As it cooled, it thickened nicely.  I served it with some fresh nutmeg on top and whipped cream.  It was a great way to use my leftover rice.  Thank you, All Recipes!

Absolutely the best, and easiest rice pudding I have ever made.  I agree to using the medium grain rice.  I eliminated the raisins because of personal preference.

OMG! We love this recipe. It's easy and delicious. I made it with long grain rice because that's what I had. I also used evaporated milk (the 1&1/2 cups) & half & half for the other 1/2 cup. I added cinnamon and nutmeg when I added the vanilla. It made 6 dishes, not 4 like the recipe says.

I tried this recipe and it just didn't work out for me, it didn't thicken and the eggs scrambled despite the fact that I tempered them. I redid this recipe with advice from a friend and used Arborio rice (because it has a high content of starch that will help thicken the rice pudding). I also added corn starch to the recipe like this: I mixed 2 tbsp of corn starch with 1/2 c of milk and then added the egg in and beat the mix lightly with a fork and it formed this light frothy and foamy texture. Then I added that into the mix and that helped to thicken it up.  It worked out so much better this way!

Personally I dont like my rice pudding too sweet.  Cut back on the sugar let the raisins naturally sweeten it and add a dash of cinnamon at the end.  One of the better ones though - really good.

This is definitely one of the best rice pudding recipes I've yet found.  My family loves rice pudding but are particularly fussy about it so finding this exquisite gem is a real treat!  We like it a bit thicker so I double the recipe and use 3 egg yolks instead.

This was very tasty.  I used leftover takeout rice.  It came out great.  I used some half and half and add a cinnamon stick during the cooking time.   Good recipe!

I've searched and searched for a recipe that was like the rice pudding my grandma used to make, and this is it!  She never used a recipe and I never wrote down directions before she died.  I am thrilled that I found this recipe.

Wonderful, whether served warm or cold.  I almost left out the butter--but it's a great addition.  I had to add some cinnamon and nutmeg because that's what I like in my rice pudding, but I would have eaten it without it.

All those years my mother made this wrong.  I used to hate rice pudding.  But this is a little piece of heaven right here.  My British husband said it's ALMOST as good as the stuff he grew up with (and he never says that about anything from this continent).  I will make this again and again and again.  Because we always have leftover rice.

The only reason that I'm giving this four stars instead of five is that there is far too many raisins!  Next time I'll cut back to 1/3 cup and try that, otherwise I won't change a thing.  Also, the consistency of this pudding was perfect (and I did use skim milk, I just let it simmer for 20 minutes like the recipe instructed).    Thanks for the great recipe!

I accidentally made mushy rice, but this recipe saved me from having a total food disaster! I used coconut milk and a bit of rice milk instead of regular milk and it came out great. I also used the Golden berry blend from TJ's instead of raisins. I'll be having this for breakfast for a week. Thanks Erica!

Outstanding, very creamy and not dry as some of these dishes can be.  I like raisins but there were so many it made the dish overpoweringly sweet. I confess I only had dark raisins to use and I'm not familiar with the golden ones so I'm not sure if this was why. I couldn't downgrade the recipe because 'moi' subbed an ingredient - I will make this again but with only half the raisins called for, it was a pain to have to pick most out before serving. I used long grain rice and that was definately fine in my book!- some reviewers mentioned otherwise. Thanks

I've never made rice pudding before but its an english staple that my husband has insited on learning as its a real comfort food for him. This is the second time we have made this. The first time we made it same as recipe but omitting the raisins-very yummy and a hit. Tonight I've made another batch with the raisins and used white and brown sugar aswell as cinnamon and cooked it all in the same pot...even better than the first time, just a bit more depth of flavour with the cinnamon and brown sugar I found. Very easy recipe and extremely adaptable for everyone in the familys tastes.

I didn't use as much milk as was called for, I ran out!, but it turned out GREAT!  I also didn't use all the sugar called for.  I did add in some freshly grated nutmeg at the end, which gave it a nice flavor.  I used leftover white rice from Chinese the night before :-)

Excellent - creamy, sweet comfort food. I mixed the egg and milk in a separate bowl, then added a few spoons of the rice mixture and mixed it in, before adding it all to the pot. This prevents your egg from scrambling. I also added a dash each of cinnamon and nutmeg to give it additional flavor.

Easy way to use leftover rice and please the kiddos. They ate this and I didn't hear another word about wanting ice cream or brownies. I added cinnamon and only had purple raisins - they worked fine! My kids are looking forward to eating it for breakfast before school tomorrow as well.

I used leftover short grain rice from dinner.  Easy to make and tasted really yummy.  My husband didn't care for it but he said that rice pudding isn't his thing.. he's a little pickier than most but is a good sport about trying anything I make.  I liked it and I think anyone who likes rice pudding would as well.

Chill it in the fridge overnight for a thicker consistency - I do this all the time now. I've noticed almost everyone omitting raisins - don't do it! I omitted it for the first 3 times I made it, thinking it wouldn't make much of a difference. Boy was I wrong! The recipe calls for a lot, so many cut down on the amount, but it does make it much more delicious!

I was bored tonight & wanted to make some sort of dessert & decided on this. It's very easy, and like the title says, very creamy. Some alterations I made: I left out the raisins. I agree that it needed more sweetness so I added about a tbsp more sugar. I also added a few pinches of sweetened coconut, as well as about a tbsp & a half of cocoa powder to make it chocolaty. Yum!

I love this recipe! Sweet, creamy rice that does not take much effort.  My 4 kids could not get enough! I ran out of sugar when making my second time, so I used sweetened condensed milk in substitution of sugar and reduced amount of milk called for.  Turned out great! Thanks! UPDATE: You can replace the milk with coconut milk with wonderful results.

This was delicious!  Highly recommended!  The only change I would make is to use less raisins but I'm not crazy about them to begin with!  :)   Enjoy!

This was my first attempt at making rice pudding.  My twin one year old boys love rice so I always have some made, so I deceided to make them a sweet treat tonight.  This was wonderful and they gobbled it up.  I did, however, have to add a little cornstarch to tighten up a little to give it a more "pudding" consistency.  Other than that...perfect!

To die for.  I cooked the rice the night before in my rice cooker, and added a tsp of cinnamon.  This cooked up more quickly than I expected, and I had to stir constantly.  This is the only rice pudding recipe I will ever need or want.

This is so yummy and easy to make. I soaked my raisins in warm/hot water for about 5 minutes or so. Wish I had some rum tho. I also added cinnamon as my family likes their rice pudding this way. Staill was WONDERFUL!!!! Thanks

So good and so easy to make.  I had a bunch of leftover rice and wanted to make something different.  YUMMY!  My 4 year old son LOVED this so much it turned him into a robot, which is real compliment.  :)

This was delicious and really easy to make. I used 1/2 cup of heavy cream and it made it really rich, but I bet it would be just as good using only milk. It was very creamy and sweet and I can't wait to make it again!

WOW! This is absolutely the best rice pudding that I have ever made. I left out the raisins as family likes it without. I grate a little nutmeg over the pudding after it is finished and just love, love it.

The best rice pudding EVER!!!!!!! Thank you so much for the recipe. When i was younger I always tried to make it and my rice would always come out so hard, I had no clue that it was because I was putting the sugar in too early, so thank you thank you. Also, this tastes really good if you substitute the milk with coconut milk.

Tasty recipe!  I have dairy/wheat issues (+others), so wanted something that was yummy.  Used rice milk instead of regular milk (total 1.5 cups) and it turned out great!

Absolutely fantastic. I skip on the raisins, and I use skim milk and Asian short-grain glutinous rice. Also, no matter how much I multiply the recipe, I've never needed to add more than one egg. This is by far my favorite dessert to make!

This is a wonderful rice pudding recipe as is, but I make one little change that brings it from delicious to decadent, in my opinion. I substitute the first 1 1/2 cups of milk for coconut milk. I then add 1/3 cup of shredded coconut. For the remaining 1/2 cup of milk I use one part coconut milk and one part half n' half. You can keep the raisins but I omit them (personal preferance), and sprinkle cinnamon ontop. Mmm!

This recipe was very simple I made it while my toddler son napping and had it chilled in time when he woke up. It was a big hit. I added a touch more sugar and vanilla for an extra sweet taste.

Excellent and easy recipe.  I made it all in one saucepan, and it turned out great.  I omitted the raisins and used 2% milk.  Next time I will add a bit more sugar, just because I like mine a little sweeter, but it couldn't be easier!

DELICIOUS, best rice pudding I've ever made!  This by far beat my grandmother's oven recipe.  I made this for my diabetic dad using 1/3 amount in Splenda, and doubled the recipe...he LOVED it and ate it all in 2 days (not sure that's good for a diabetic but he couldn't help himself!)  Definite keeper!

My four and seven year old daughters loved this!! I used my rice cooker and stemmed the rice, then combined on the stovetop as directed. We added 1/2 t. of cinnamon and left the raisins out. Simple ingredient list makes this a fast and easy recipe with no shopping required!

I am always looking for & trying creamy rice pudding recipes. This one is one of the best I have tried. Very easy to make. Adding cinnamon after it is done cooking makes for a very eye appealing  dessert in addition to a little zip. This is a very easy recipe to make your own changes. Maybe a little orange zest & cocoa.....

This is really good rice pudding, just like my grandmother made when I was a little girl.  Mine came out a little thick, so I added some more milk at the end when I was getting ready to serve it.  Also good cold - for breakfast !!

I made it - salt & raisins/ and substituted 1/2 & 1/2 for part of the milk. Very creamy and thick. Watch the timing for the milk/1/2 & 1/2 or its too soupy, at least for my taste. Great flavour.

Very creamy!  I used highend Nishkin medium grain rice and that kind of rice was perfect for this recipe. I added a little bit of extra milk (1/2 cup) after cooking because I mine a little less thick.

Awesome, look no further...this is a great recipe for rice pudding. We eat mostly organic, so we used organic white rice, low fat goat's milk, organic turbinado sugar and organic cinnamon vanilla and butter. Making something delicious that's healthy too...the kids love it!

I loved making this over the stove ,as it was 92 degrees today. I added the milk to the same pot as the rice, and this made the sugar dissolve faster, and added 1/2 craisins and 1/2 raisins, and a little cinnamon. Simply the best

Excellent rice pudding.  I used leftover rice from a previous days meal, super fine sugar and skim milk.  Added cinnamon, grated nutmeg and lemon zest.  Do make sure to temper your eggs as previously stated.

I have been looking for years for a creamy rice pudding recipe that will keep for a couple days without getting all runny/milky after the first day or two. I have finally found it! Thank you very much for sharing this recipe, it was delicious, economical, and my entire family loved it.  My changes to the recipe were that I needed to alter the ingredient quantity because I was preparing 20 servings. I omitted raisins (only because I don't like them) and when I served to my family and "pop over unexpected guests", I topped with cinnamon sugar at the time of consumption and everyone loved it.  As for the outcome of making such a large quantity, it came out perfect and this recipe, alterations and all delivered on the final product. One of the best recipes I have come across in a long while. Thanks Again!

This recipe is perfect the way it is. A great gluten-free comfort food! I have Celiac Sprue and make it at least once per week. I use 1 part Basmati rice (long grain) to 1 part milk (2%) and don't save any milk to add later. I add the sugar at the beginning as recommended-I feel it helps to thicken the end result perhaps because sugar increases the cooking temperature. I also find that adding a large scoop of the heated mixture into the beaten egg before adding it to the pot is important to prevent hard boiled egg chunks. Mmmmmm

I don't want to give this recipe a bad review because everyone clearly loves it but I didn't like it. Did I cook it too long waiting for it to get thick and creamy? It seems like too much rice and not enough pudding. It didn't taste right at all.

What an easy way to make dessert after a dinner that included rice! Next time I'll remember to make more rice than I need so I can make this yummy treat after dinner. I used crasins because I didn't have rasins, and it was good, but not as good as it would have been with the rasins.

All I have to say is YUMMM! I always alter the recipes that i get on here though.  I used one can of sweetened condensed milk and about a 1/4 cup of regular milk.  I had extra rice...hence all of the milk.  i soaked my raisins in a little bit of dark rum mixed with brown sugar.  when i added the raisins i strained out the rum/sugar mixture but you can taste a hint of the rum flavoring.  it smells and taste wonderful...now lets see if my 8 year will like it!  LOL!

This recipe is soooo easy and can be made with either Sugar, brown sugar or Splenda, or Equal (if you add after it has cooled a bit).  Followed the recommendations of others re the egg, and added a little cinnamon and nutmeg as well.  A keeper, and a family pleaser. Made mine with 1% low fat milk, and it turned out nice and creamy.  Oh, I also doubled the raisins, as I love em.

Highly Successful!!!  I made this for 20 people...and substituted soymilk for regular milk... the recipe didn't say add cinnamon, but I added on the top.  At first I didn't think it would thicken... but it did!  And my friends and family all raved about it!  (especially since I'm not known to be the cooking type... :) )

I modified this recipe to make it a tad healthier.  I used brown rice and raw sugar instead of refined white sugar, which enters the bloodstream at a much faster pace than raw sugar.  I kept everything else the same, except for drizzling a little maple syrup on top before serving (to satisfy my extremely sweet tooth).

I had never had rice pudding before.  I made rice for lunch today and had a lot leftover and thought I'd look up a recipe and give it a whirl.  I sure am happy I did.  It was awesome!!!  My husband and kids loved it too!  They all gave it 5 stars.  I will for sure make this again.  Thanks!!!

I did not care for this recipe.  Rice pudding requires brown sugar and cinnamin.  I have been making rice pudding for 52 years for my husband and i tried this one and he did not care for it either.  It is tasteless and dry.

So simple yet very tasty. I followed the directions exactly, but only used one pot for both steps, rather than two. I also followed the wonderful advice to add the sugar only after the rice was fully cooked.

This was my first time making rice pudding from scratch---this recipe is a great base. We like strong flavors, so I jazzed it up with shredded coconut, ground cardamom, ground ginger, and a generous amount of cinnamon. Also, I blanched some roasted cashews (soak them for a few minutes in boiling water to soften them) and tossed them in with the raisins. We loved it.

This was great! It even converted a few non-believers :) It was just sweet enough, and was great both hot and cold. Had it for supper last night piping hot and breakfast this morning nice and chilled. I used medium-grain rice and it was perfect.

My husband made this and he absolutely LOVED it! I had never had rice pudding before and it was the best. We did add a little cinnamon to add a twist since it has raisins in it, but I believe it would have been good without it.

As good as my baked recipe but much easier and less clean up.  I used leftover Chinese rice but cooked it with about 1/4 cup of water first to make it more tender and then proceeded with the recipe. I also used rice milk. Still very creamy. It is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

Never made it before, but made the Horchata and used the rice from it for the pudding.  Turned out excellent! Make sure to eat it while it's warm, cuz that's when it's best.  Kinda reminds me of the Spotted Dick we were served while in England.

This recipe is seriously the best!  I loved it with the golden raisins and cinnamon.  The only thing that it doesn't specify that is a must, is using sticky rice or short grain. It really adds to the texture.

I did omit the raisins and the last half cup of milk since I prefer really thick rice pudding.  Add a dash of cinnamon when serving and it's a perfect blend of flavours.

Pretty darn good! I finished mine up in the rice cooker after cooking the rice and it turned out perfect.  I did add cinnamon in with the last egg/milk addition. The kids loved it...probably because I don't cook white rice!  I will however try it with my short grain brown next time.

I made this last night for the very first time- i followed the recipe except that I doubled it up to make more. It came out really good- creamy and delicious! I used a vial of butter-vanilla flavoring (it's from Europe)- it gave the rice pudding a delicate vanilla flavor- excellent!!

Rice pudding is one of my comfort foods and I really enjoyed this recipe, even though I usually prefer baked puddings. The only thing I did differently was use cooked rice from the night before to speed things a bit. It was wonderful, creamy and fast!

this is delicious and easy to make...i boost the 'healthiness' factor by using brown rice (usually leftover from dinner), soymilk and/or buttermilk, and then i add toasted walnuts, dried fruit (cranberries, raisins, blueberries, goji berries, etc.) and a teaspoon or two of pumpkin pie spice (or similar individual spices).  i've found i can skip the egg and the butter without sacrificing flavor or texture.  it's a more guiltless version we can eat for breakfast or dessert!

Love this recipe. What would I ever do without All recipes? Thanks to many reviews I had no problems. I cooked 1 cup of jasmine rice (my personal favorite) which gave me exactly 3 cups of cooked rice so I had the double recipe I needed for company. I added the salt and butter when cooking the rice. Added 3 cups of milk to the cooled rice in the same pan and cooked until rice was very tender about 15 minutes and then added the sugar and cooked another 5 minutes.  In a separate saucepan I warmed 1 cup of milk and whisked in the two room temperature eggs and then streamed it into the pudding while stirring and cooked another 5 minutes. Removed the pan from the heat and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg and a generous 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Yummy!  Left out the raisins, a matter of personal taste. This is the method I use to cook Jasmine rice. In large saucepan bring 1 3/4 cups water, 1/2 teaspoon salt & 1 tablespoons margarine or butter to a boil, slowly stir in 1 cup rice, bring back to a boil, reduce heat, stir gently, cover and simmer for 9 minutes or just until rice begins to stick to bottom of pan. Gently fluff with fork and remove from heat and let stand uncovered for 10 minutes.Perfect Jasmine rice every time.

This is a very good recipe. I only gave it 4 stars because it's not the best I have ever made. I lost the recipe that I use to use and while this came very close to being as good it wasn't quite there.   I agree with some that it is a tad to sweet, next time I will cut the sugar back some.   I used jasmine rice which had a creamy flavor to begin with. I personally think it is a perfect rice for rice pudding.

This is REALLY good!!!  I just got making this and it turned out fabulous.  I used only brown sugar (preference) and added the cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg in at the same time I added the sugar to the milk.  I also tempered my second batch of milk.  Easy and comforting.

This pudding was awesome, and perfect for that evening sweet attack! It's best to eat any leftovers pretty quickly, though, as it doesn't keep for long. If you *have* any, that is!

This turned out really good. It is creamy and has just the right amount of sweetness! I used two percent milk and only a little bit of spray butter, and it was still really good.

This rice pudding is delicous!! The only thing I did was not use the raisins in the pudding and put just a little bit more sugar (I had a sweet tooth.) It had perfect texture and was VERY easy to make. I made this for my family and they were wondering where I had gotten the recipe. DELICOUS!!!

This is an excellent recipe.  I cooked med grain rice in my rice cooker and then followed the directions except I used brown sugar and I added coconut as well as raisins and I added cinnamon in addition to vanilla at the end.  The pudding in thick and rich...my new favorite rice pudding recipe!

Delicious and much easier than I thought rice pudding could be. The only things I would suggest are:  1. Add the cooked rice after the sauce has been cooked. This way you can add less rice if you want a thinner consistency. 2. Add a cinnamon stick to the milk mixture while it's cooking. 3. Add the beaten egg very very SLOWLY while constantly whisking to avoid getting scrambled eggs in your pudding.

Excellent!  Following previous recommendations, I added the butter and the salt when I was cooking the rice.  I also added some of the warm rice mixture to the milk/egg mixture to make sure the egg didn't cook/scramble.  I used skim milk, and added 1.5 tsp cornstarch to make it thicker.  I also mixed in cinnamon and nutmeg.  The nutmeg made all the difference for me!  Delicious!

Super easy and delicious. I topped with crushed walnuts and added cinnamon to the first rice/milk mixture. Love the consistency.

this rice pudding was incredible.  It was very easy to make, I just used some leftover rice from the day before.  I would omit the raisins next time, I just don't like raisins that much.  And I added cinnamon to mine. So yummy, my boyfriend raved about.

I didn't have raisins so I left that out. I also didn't have vanilla extract but I used cinnamon to add flavor and it turned out pretty good.

OH YUMMM!!  I made a few modifications (I hate it when people do this) but I actually thought it might not be as good with my changes, but it was AWESOME!  I used instant brown rice, light soy milk, splenda brown sugar blend (just 1/8 c.) and smart balance butter blend.  It was my attempt to make it healthier- and it still was creamy and delish!  Of course the brown rice was a slightly different texture than what you'd expect, but still good!  Now to see if my hubby suspects the soy milk!

In a word - fabulous!!  I replaced the milk with lite vanilla soy milk, and risked using Minute Rice (1 cup rice to 1 cup water)to cut down on the cooking time.  Also, while the rice was cooking in the milk and sugar, I soaked the raisins in the egg and vanilla to further plump the raisins before adding them to the rice.  Thank you so much for the delish and satisfying recipe!

Easy, simple, and oh so delicious!  I have made this several times.   It even works with brown rice!   I just tried a variation with almond extract and a kick of red chili powder--yummy and a little spicy!

I made this with some modifications.  I used brown basmati rice and substituted 3/4 of the milk for skim.  I also added cinnamon at the end and dried coconut.  I used olivio instead of butter and only used about half of what was called for in the recipe.  Delicious.    Be careful when adding the egg-next time I'd mix it with the milk to avoid getting any pieces of cooked egg in it or let it cool and add it.

So good, best recipe for rice pudding I have ever tried. I used leftover rice that I had in the fridge and it worked great , just cook for about 5-10 minutes longer before adding the remaining milk, egg and raisins. Delicious!

I ended up using long grain jasmine rice (its what I had) and the light texture didn't inhibit its rave reviews. I also use lactose free milk, and it turned out just fine.  I've been asked to make this again!

Great basic recipe!  I'd never made rice pudding before and mine turned out great, especially sprinkled with cinnamon.  Much creamier than I'd expected, and a great level of sweetness.  Using short-grain rice will make a difference, as well as using freshly cooked rice instead of leftovers, though it's yummy either way.  Thanks!

Yum-my.   I give it 4 stars because it calls for a lot of sugar and does not need the butter (or raisins, not my thing). But that is a matter of taste, instruction-wise it's a 5 star recipe-- if you really want a buttery or sweet rice pudding, go for the straight up recipe. If you're like me and like it with fruit, try it with less sugar (I used 40 grams-- about 2/3 of what it called for) and no butter. It will be great.   Also delicious: 1/2 brown rice and 1/2 white rice.

This was really good!  I also liked that it was easy to make and not too time consuming compared to some other rice pudding recipes.   A word of caution: I strayed away from the directions a bit and made the pudding in the same pot I had cooked the rice in, unlike the directions instructed.  Bad idea!  Some rice had stuck to the bottom, and as I continued cooking the pudding, I smelled something burning.  It was the stuck-on rice cooking even further and sticking to the pan.  I ended up having to transfer the mixture to another pan anyway, which I should have just done from the start.  I was trying to avoid using two pans, but I still ended up having to use two in the end, and the difference is now one's sitting in my sink waiting to have the burnt rice scraped off of it.  You can try making it all in one pan, but next time I will definitely follow the directions and use two from the start.

Yummy. I added in cinnamon and nutmeg. My mom used to make one like this when I was a kid, but she had to bake it in the oven. I have never heard of stove top rice pudding, but it was quick and easy. My daughter ate the leftovers for breakfast the next day.

This recipe is awesome.  It was my first time making rice pudding.  I had been craving it and decided to try it.  It is exactly the taste I was looking for. My four year old even said this stuff is delicious. Thanks!!

Love this recipe! Even when the family is gone, I make it just for myself.  I use short-grain rice and dark raisins.

I had some leftover rice and decided to try the recipe.  Although everyone says that it has to be short or medium grain.  All I had was jasmine.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the raisins.  I used lowfat milk.  It came out great and very creamy.

I'd never had rice pudding before I made this, but I liked it a lot! the consistency took a little while to get used to, but it was overall delicious. The perfect amount of sweetness.

This was absolutely delicious.  I didn't even realize how tasty rice pudding could be!  I did, however, have to cook it longer than suggested to get it to thicken appropriately.  Also, I omitted the butter (tasted great without it) and the raisins.  Instead, I added a bit of shredded coconut when I added the milk/beaten egg--a great addition!

I used Arborio rice per some of the reviews, but I think this made it too thick and not creamy enough.  I like my rice pudding a little "loose".  I will try this again with regular long grain rice or with more milk.  There were a few too many raisins for my taste.  I think the flavor and sweetness were good (I have a cold).

The best in a recipe: easy and delicious. I used a can of evaporated skim milk for the first 1 1/2 cups milk called for, then used about 1/4 cup granulated Splenda (measures cup for cup like sugar) in place of the sugar, which I added after the rice and evaporated milk had cooked for about 15 minutes. I didn't add any additional milk with the egg so it was super thick immediately served hot, then when I reheat leftovers I add a little milk and heat on the stove. I also added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg with the egg (no idea how much). Honestly I was a little surprised at the great flavor and texture. My toddler loves this rice pudding, and made with evaporated skim milk and Splenda, I guess you could do worse for a snack.

We loved this recipe! Thanks so much! We played with it as well but it is perfect as is. We have made this 3 times this past week, as we haven't had rice pudding in such a long time. I like it with Cinnamon and without as well as with or without raisins. It is good hot or cold. Can't go wrong with this one!

Very very good. I use brown rice and sugar instead of white, and dried cranberries instead of raisins. 

Just a different option.

This is so good.  I did substitute egg nog for the last 1/2 cup milk.  It made it a little more richer.  I also added a couple cinnamon sticks while the pudding was cooking and then took them out later.  So good!!

I've made this recipe many times and it is great. I serve it the way a well-known restaurant in town does - in a sundae glass with strawberries at the bottom. Use the strawberries that were frozen with glaze/juice, mostly thawed out. Then add the hot pudding on top. Looks impressive and the strawberries are a nice complement.

This is the best rice pudding recipe that I have tried and I have tried a lot. My mom loves rice pudding and she told me this was the best she has ever tasted. I omitted the butter and vanilla by accident one time and it was still good. You can also add 1 tsp cinnamon to the actual pudding in addition to sprinkling it on top for added flavor. It is awesome!!

This was outstanding...make sure you temper the eggs before adding them so you don't end up with egg drop soup.  Loved this one and will make it again and again.

This was great.  I used brown rice that I had left from supper and it turned out fine.  I didn't have a bag of raisins, but I picked some raisins and other dried fruit  out of a tub of trail mix and used that.  I liked the taste surprise of the various dried fruit.

This was very very good and very easy to make. I used leftover jasmine rice from a few days ago, so it was already cooked, and the pudding ended up being very creamy and smooth. At the very end I added a tablespoon of brown sugar. I omitted the raisins and didn't need any cinnamon/nutmeg.

I used leftover sticky rice (short grain rice) after 20min on hot stove, still wasn't thickening up so i had to add teaspoon cornstarch which helped. then it completely thickened when I added the egg. we like our rice pudding thick with whole milk poured over top. this has a custardy taste. very delicious

This was pretty darn good. I made it with splenda, cocunut and cardamon powder.  It was really great I added those three ingredients at the beginning so the flavor was great!

Totally amazing - I doubled the recipe and served it at dinner for six.  One thing I would have done differently:  added a bit less milk at the end, resulting in a thicker pudding.  Mine turned out a bit runnier than I would have liked.

This is DELICIOUS while still fresh.  However, once it cooled and it had stood in my fridge for a day, it was dry and unpalatable.  So eat it as soon as possible!!

This is wonderful and simple. I must have made a mistake every time I made this and it still turned out amazing. I like to use an aromatic rice and sometimes zest some lime/lemon or cinnamon stick on top.

Great recipes. Very simple and very good. I used 1% organic milk and crushed walnuts instead of raisins, and spinkled nutmeg on top. Very good, I will make again for the holidays.

This was easy to prepare and tastes really good. I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Only thing I didn't like was that the egg cooked when added. It made the pudding have strings in it like egg drop soup. I didn't like the way that looked or the way they felt in my mouth when I eat it.

We enjoyed this recipe; this was very close to Kozy Shack.  Great thick and creamy texture.  Made with 1 ½ of skimmed milk and ½ cup of half and half (that is what I had in the house).  I did temper the egg with the mixture but the egg still got a little stringy.  I did omit the raisins; my husband does not care for them.  Would make this again, but will temper the egg better next time.  Thank you for sharing.

This made for a great way to get my infant to eat his rice! I sub'd the milk for formula... half'd the sugar. put in ice cube trays, cooled in the fridge then froze for later. I make all my son's baby food and this, even w/ formula was very creamy and flavorful. My baby needs all the calories he can get - a great calorie booster!

I used a cup of whipping cream and reduced the milk by one cup.  I also added 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon, nutmeg and a pinch of cloves.  This turned out so well that my wife and mother-in-law ate it all!  Note: I also soaked the raisins in brandy for a few hours.  This was the best rice pudding that I ever had!

Wow! I hadn't made rice pudding in ages. This was easy, and my three kids loved it! So did my hubby! I used 2% milk, real Mexican vanilla and the added cinnamon and some fresh nutmeg at the end as others suggested. I do agree that it is so rich that a small serving is all you need. I would suggest a fruit cup, or about 1/4 cup. We even dizzled a bit of Hershey's syrup on it. Still yummy. The kids want me to make it again!

This is a great recipe. I took the advice of a few others and decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup, decreased the raisins to 1/3 cup (I didn't have golden raisins so I substituted "regular" raisins), and stirred in a sprinkling of both nutmeg and cinnamon. Like others, I tempered the egg by stirring a little of the hot rice liquid into the beaten egg and then stirred the egg into the hot rice mixture. My family liked it, and the kids said it "tasted like Christmas" ....on a very hot August day! LOL! Thanks for a nice recipe.

Although this tasted allright, I tried to double the recipe because it said four servings, NOW I have enough rice pudding to feed the whole block in my neighborhood and part of Africa! I was disappointed that it did not specify HOW much the poster considered a serving, apparently a serving to them is like a pan in a buffet line...I thought the taste could be more appealing and it was either runny or thick, creamy was the last adjective I would have used to describe it...

Wow, what an incredible recipe! We enjoyed the taste of substituting 1/2 and 1/2 for about 1/2 of the milk as we prefer a creamier texture. I also baked it the last 5 minutes in a casserole dish instead of the stove-top and it turned out awesome. Thanks!

I haven't had a rice pudding this good since I visited my grandmother in NY 4 years ago.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!  Now on to my notions:  I used Splenda to substitue for the sugar as was suggested and found that only 1 tbsp is needed.  You can always add more, but you can't take it back out. I also used 2% milk and added a pinch of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg as others have.  This is a real keeper, even my mom was impressed with how well it turned out.

Made this last night.  I should have made a double batch, because we all loved it! I left out the raisins and topped with cinnamon.  Also, I think it's better when it's served chilled.

If you want to use half the sugar, use jasmine rice.  This rice has a sweet taste to it. But be forewarned, if you let this rice sit long before mixing the other ingredient it will get sticky. But the taste is great.  People should use this rice more.

I liked this except for the egg aftertaste. I also don't know how I feel about adding the egg at the end. Not a fan of raw-ish eggs. Cooked rice for 17 minutes instead if 20.  Also used skim milk , 1/4 cup sugar and added cinnamon and nutmeg. Really easy.

OMG!  This is great! I have never been a rice pudding fan, but I am now!  This was my first time making it and thanks to the great instructions and simplicity of the recipe, I had success - thanks! The only thing I changed was that I used 1/2 cup of light cream (I love creaminess) and added nutmeg and cinnamon.  Wonderful!  Will make again and again!!

This recipe is amazing. I've made it a few times and have recently tried it using cream instead of milk, it was even better!! I also tried using left over rice from the "Asian Coconut Rice" recipe (also found in allrecipes) adding a few drops of coconut extract and a handful of sweetened flaked coconut. Incredible!!!!

Wow Erica G! I love it! I was looking in a magazine and came across this advertisement for rice pudding, taste buds took over. Being that it was too late to go to the store for "premade" rice pudding. I gave your recipe a try. This was the best I have ever tried & made, and I have tried and made several only to disapoint my taste buds. I got online & your recipe was the first to come up in my search. Read the reviews, and there was a lot too. I had some left over cooked white rice, so I started with warming up the cooked rice in 1 1/2 cups of milk & proceeded from there. Add the vanilla after you have taken it off the burner, that way the vanilla doesn't pick up a bitter flavor from over cooking. Also used fresh nutmeg at the end too. This is a keeper for us. It brought back sweet childhood memories for me! Just like my Noni made.

I’m a diabetic so I made some changes to this recipe to make it more suitable for me to eat.  First, I substituted same amount of Splenda for the sugar.  Second, I substituted equal amounts of Hood Calorie Countdown 2% milk for the regular milk to cut back on the carbs and third, I didn’t add the raising to cut back on more natural sweetness.  Other then the ingredient substitutes, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out FANTASTIC!  My family members could not taste any difference in this recipe with the changes I made and it was great warm and cold.  Loved it!

This was good, but not great.  I don't understand the need for two sauce pans, I made mine in one, but like others has said the pudding didn't set...however, suddenly it did, and it came all at once and was then not creamy enough.  I'm going to have to try this again.  The flavor is good and worth a second try.  I didn't have golden raisins so I used regular, but I added them before the egg and second measure of milk allowing them to plump a little.  Thanks.

I love this recipe. I made it for dessert, and while I was cooking dinner I left it on the counter, and couldn't help having a small taste of the pudding every once and a while. 
When I made it, it came out really thick after sitting a few minutes. I guess i let the milk evaporate a little to much. But after adding more milk it made it more pudding like and thinner. It also made it a little less sweet, which I liked.

This is a great recipe!
Thank you!

Very good!  I used organic brown rice (long grain) with soy milk, organic egg, sugar, etc...  VERY delicious and easy.  I just used the leftover rice from dinner and added the other ingredients as instructed - came out perfectly and loved by everyone, especially the kids!

GreAt recipe  Erica  !!!  I have always had trouble with rice pudding -   this came out great.  Nice and thick and creamy.  Made the basic batch to test it. Will have to double and quad it for friends and family.  The Best One Yet.  Thanks for the Recipe.

This was the first time I have ever eaten or made rice pudding.  We had leftover brown rice from supper and rice pudding sounded like a good idea.  This came out creamy and so yummy!  The brown rice kept it's texture and took on the flavor of the dish.  I left out the raisins, but that's all.  Thank You!

This stuff is soooo good! Very comforting. I used skim evaporated milk in place of regular milk and used leftover rice from dinner. I cooked it on a little bit lower heat for longer, simply to avoid burning the milk. Great with cinnamon and nutmeg, as others have suggested. Used regular raisins. Has a permanent place in our recipe box. Thank you so much!

This is a very nice rice pudding.  The only suggestion I have is to cut down on the sugar.  I did have to use instant rice which I precooked following the recipe as stated.  I plan on using it cold and will at that time add cinnamon.

This was good.  Not my fav (I like my rice pudding baked) but it was quick and easy.  Will leave out the egg and the extra butter next time.  To me the pudding doesn't need these.  Added raisins and nutmeg.

this was awesome!  for rice, i made 1 1/2 cups of instant rice in the microwave.  in the milk (we use skim), i put  2 cinnamon sticks while it all cooked. i also tempered the egg so as not to have eggy bits(i think others have suggested that). it was the best rice pudding i have ever made!

I had never made rice pudding before but it was easy and delicious.  I'll definitely be making extra rice from now on, so I'll have an excuse to make this.  I also tempered the egg to ensure it wouldn't scramble.

This was the best rice pudding I have had in a really long time. It didn't take long at all. I didn't add the raisins because I don't care for them but added a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon. I also ended up tempering the egg, I thought that was the safest way to do it so I wouldn't scramble it. Let me tell you the end result was amazing, thick and creamy and perfect. Thank you Erica G. for a great recipe.

this was my first time making rice pudding and it was yummy! i actually used brown rice...made me feel better about wanting to eat all of it! i had to add a bit of cornstrach (that mixed with a bit of water) at the end because it wasn't really getting thick and creamy and i think it was because i used the brown rice instead of white. anyway...it was yummy. i sprinkled some nutmeg on top and will be making again!

This is the best texture rice pudding that is the simplest to make.  Great for when there is left over rice in the cooker.  I always add cinnamon or nutmeg, and any kind of raisin seems to work just fine.

I found this recipe to be ok. My husband said it was good but not great. I hope to tweek it some more. It was not very creamy. I think I will add more milk next time and more cooking liquid when making the rice.

My mom used to make baked rice pudding, and I couldn't stand it. I love this recipe however. 

For an Indian inspired twist, substitute Basmati Rice and coconut milk, and add cardamom and cinnamon. This recipe is a great base for experimenting!

My daughter requested homemade rice pudding for her 12th birthday family dinner.  This recipe was PERFECT.  Not too sweet and very creamy.  I used short grain "sushi" rice.  It was delicious.

It was really good. I used vanilla soy milk instead of regular milk, so I omitted the vanilla. I also added fresh ground cinnamon & nutmeg. I also left out the raisins, because of picky eaters.  :)

I've made this 3 times now. Delicious!!The past 2 times, I've cheated and made it in the microwave because I didn't want to stand in front of the stove for that long. I cooked it about 10-12 min until thick, stopping to stir every 3 minutes. Then I added the final egg/milk mixture and cooked another 1-2 minutes. The pudding's consistency seemed the same to me, and it was a lot easier.

I personally don't like rice pudding, but I had some leftover rice and knew that my husband loves rice pudding.  After doing some searching for the perfect pudding recipe, I came across this one.  And, I striked gold with recipe! My husband loved rice pudding. He said it was the best he ever had!!

5 STARS FOR THIS EASY TO MAKE AND DELICIOUS RICE PUDDING.  I USED THE SAME AMOUNT OF SPLENDA INSTEAD OF SUGAR.
 I'M NOT FOND OF RAISINS SO I USED DRIED CRANBERRIES, THE FAMILY LOVES IT.

While suffering with the worst throat/ear infection of my adult life and looking for easy to swallow foods, I stumbled upon this! It is fabulous! I was out of vanilla so I used a bit of almond extract and cinnamon. It turned out beautifully so soothing to my throat and so filling to my tummy! I loved the fact that it's not overly sweet. This will become a favorite breakfast food, it's too good to keep only for dessert.

This rice pudding was really yummy.  I added a bit of cinnoman and nutmeg to it and it was even yummier.

Unlike many reviewers, I had a bad experience with this recipe.  I used leftover rice... maybe that's why. I ended up with rice floating around in sugary milk soup. The only thing that redeemed it (kind of) was that I had about 3 extra cups of rice that I added to the soup to thicken it up. Most of this ended up in the garbage.

I was craving rice pudding in the middle of the night and searched the internet for a quick recipe.  This recipe was great.  I used a little extra rice and upped the amount of vanilla to 1 full tsp.  I used a very small amount of cinnamon right at the end.  Gotta say I love it....

I made this recipe as stated and it was too "custardy" for my taste. I made it a second time and only used the egg white plus more vanilla and it turned out yummy! Great way to use up leftover rice.

I gave 3 stars because the cooking instructions were easy but I had to change a few things to make it more tasty.  I added used 2/3c sugar instead of 1/3c.  Also, I added approx 1/4t cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg.  Since I only had skim milk available I added 2T of butter instead of 1T.  After those changes, the recipe was awesome.......If it still counts as the same recipe.

This is an excellent basic recipe. I made it the first time with regular long grain rice. The second time I used arborio. The arborio cooked up faster, but I had to add more milk to get the texture I like. Added more raisins too, but that is because I like raisins. I highly recommend this one.

It was doing quite nicely, until I added the egg. It got a really strange taste to it, not as good as it was before I added. Next time, I think I'll leave the egg out, regardless of whether it sets up as nicely or not.

Really good.  I had to add more cinnamon than it asked for, and had to keep it on the stove for twenty minutes instead of two in the last step because mine was very soupy.  In the end though it turned out very fluffy and made way more than 4 servings.  Was delicious.  I will definitely make this one again.  

My only reason for the four stars was the time it took to make.  I spent about an hour.

Very creamy and good!  My only additions/changes were to make it with brown rice instead of white, and to add a couple tablespoons of Splenda's brown sugar blend when I added in the vanilla.  That added just the perfect amount of sweetness to an otherwise fantastic recipe.  Even tastier after letting all the flavors blend in the fridge overnight.

By far the best rice pudding recipe I have tried.  I like to add a splash of rum along with the raisins and a little cinnamon.  This recipe is SUPER easy and very tasty!!  My kids absolutely LOVE it, and even my hubby, who isn't a rice pudding fan, will snag bites when I make this!  I love it warm!

Excellent - reminded me of old fashioned rice pudding my mother used to make.  I didn't put as many raisins in as called for as it seemed like a lot - just kind of threw some in until it looked right.  Served it topped with whipped cream and drizzled with maple syrup.  It was great!!

Very tasty - good consistentcy!  I used cooked Minute Rice, 2% milk, egg substitute, and added: 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and an additional egg.  A great way to reuse leftover rice.

I used long grain rice and didn't like the texture so I used a hand stick blender to smooth it out.  The sweetness was just right.  Next time I will make it with short grain rice.

I just finished making this and I have to say it is divine. I am in big trouble because I am trying to stop myself from eating it all. I used Slpenda for the sugar and added more vanilla. I also used craisins for the raisins. So, quick and easy for such great flavour. I will definitely be making this again!

Good stuff.  I used less sugar, skim milk and added cinnamon and nutmeg.  I accidentally left out the vanilla and butter and it was excellent.  I will leave out the raisins next time because I didn't care for them.

Delicious.  Rave reviews all around the table from the toddlers and their dad.  Followed the recipe as written with a few substitutions/additions. I used 1 1/2 cups leftover brown Jasmine rice and added plain soymilk and sugar.  Had cooked the rice with salt, so omitted the extra.  Probably because the rice was brown, it took more like 25 minutes to get it creamy.  Added more soymilk and tempered the egg before adding as many others recommended.  Used regular raisins  and added a sprinkle of cinnamon at the end.

The best rice pudding I've ever had! I used regular raisins since I had no golden raisins, and I added some cinnamon. It was wonderfully creamy and oh so good.

This was excellent - my husband, who doesn't care for rice pudding even liked it. I followed one posters advice not to add the sugar until I was sure the rice was cooked to my liking, so I added it towards the end of the initial cooking with the milk. I also tempered the eggs so I wouldn't have any scrambled egg pieces. PERFECTION!Yum. I will be trying this next time with some brown sugar just to see.

This was a good, but a little too sweet for us. Next time I'll use just 1/4 cup of sugar. Was nice and creamy even using all skim milk (that's all we have in the house).

I was looking for a rice pudding recipe that didn't have to be baked in the oven so I tried this one.  BOY, am I ever glad I did!  It's even better than my baked version and so much easier! I did add 1/4 teaspoon each cinnamon and nutmeg. Even my picky eater daughter devoured this!

I made this tonight and I am SO glad I did...it is wonderful!  It's so creamy and just the right amount of sweetness. The golden raisins are the perfect addition, they add a delicate sweetness and chewiness to the pudding.  

I like this pudding just the way it is, but I can see where it would lend itself to many different flavor additions to suit any taste. And it's so easy to prepare too.  Doesn't get better than that!  Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe.

I made it but doubled the recipe. I added the salt in the water and rice as it came to a boil instead of later as someone suggested. I also added the vanilla, a hint of nutmeg, lots of cinnamon, as I was boiling the rice and milk mixture before adding the beat eggs. My husband test tasted it and said it still wasn't sweet enough so I added about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of sugar. (to taste. It is really nice and creamy but has to sit after you take it off the burner and let it sit and cool in order to let the raisins soak and absorb the liquids more. It it excellant, yummy and reminds me of the real old fashion made by grandma rice pudding!! Delicious!!

It even works vegan!

I substituted 1 cup soy and 1 cup oat milk (just what I had) for the milk, Ener-G egg replacer for the egg, and Earth Balance for the butter.

Still extremely delicious.

Fast, easy, and delicious. I put in the sugar near the end and before I put in the egg...I scrambled and mixed it with the last 1/2 cup of milk.  A little less sugar next time will suit my taste more. Although I like raisins, I like it better without, that's just my personal preference though...a little cinnamon sprinkled on top before serving is also nice. Thanks for the recipe!! This is the second time I've made it.

If I could rate this 10 Stars, I Would!! I was looking for a creamy rice pudding, and every recipe I found turned out to be really dry. This one is SO Moist. It is the most Delicious Rice Pudding I have ever had in my life. Ever. There is this Indian Restaurand that makes a rice pudding, and it Was my favorite, until I made this one!

I doubled this recipe because the three of us really love rice pudding.  We were not disappointed!  We added nutmeg and/or cinnamon before serving.  Yummy!  When cold, it was a little thicker than we like, but we added milk and that solved the "problem".  I used long grain rice and skim milk to prepare this recipe.  It probably wasn't as creamy as it would have been with a richer milk.

I never made rice pudding before and only had it once at a restuarant in Cuba.  This recipe was so easy and good that I will definately use it again!  Oh, and skipped the raisins.

Delicious & easy = awesome !! I doubled the recipe for extra hungry mouths, added 2 snack boxes (all I had) of raisins 10 mins. into the simmer, also a shake of cinnamon. Added another shake of cinnamon to the top before serving. Fantastic warm or cold. This is a keeper and repeat maker!!!

I left out the raisins and added some cinnamon, and it was awesome.  I have made this countless times for myself, and also for my father, who loves it with the raisins.  A definite keeper than is in my permanent recipe box.

Yum!  This is so creamy, and I even used 2% milk.  VERY good!  It's even better the next morning served cold.  I doubled the recipe and added 1/8 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the milk and rice mixture.  Perfect...I can't wait to make it again for company!

I don't know what happened, but it didn't turn out like it was supposed to. It was all goopy & the rices didn't cook all the way. I'll just keep buying it in the store.

This was VERY GOOD according to my husband, I've never had rice pudding or made it before tonight but tasted it and its like custard to me flavorwise, and was good! I did a little different to see what would happen, used about 1/8c of brown sugar with the sugar together making a 1/2c and put in 1/2tsp of cinnamon and 1/4tsp nutmeg then sprinkled more on top at the end hubby said it was VERY GOOD!

This recipe is awesome!!  Much better than the store bought rice pudding we were eating.  I did have to add a little more milk (1/2 cup) and sugar (1-2 tsp) while cooking part way through because it became a little too thick.  I also used 3/4 tsp vanilla  rather than 1/2 tsp.  It turned out great and was almost completely gone within a couple of hours after making it.  Yummy!

This tastes wonderful!  I was a little worried about it thickening, but I followed the instructions (except I didn't add any raisins) and it came out perfect.  It's especially good with cinnamon.

Tonight was the second time I made this
delicious rice pudding.  I made it both times with evaporated milk, and cut the sugar down.  Tonight I made enough for 10, and used 1/2 cup sugar.  It was just the right sweetness.  In the past I always baked rice pudding.  This recipe is far better than any I have made in the past.  My company also raved about it.

I made this recipe out of the blue tonight because I needed something sweet.  I topped it off with chopped pecans and dates and it hit the spot completely.  I am going to eat the other half of it for breakfast.  Will make again! Probably tommorrow... haha.  Thanks alot for submitting this recipe and for all the great reviewers!

Wow! I've been looking for a recipe like this for over a year. I wanted one that didn't require baking in a water bath. I added cinnamon and nutmeg at the end as others  had suggested and it was perfect. My husband turned up his nose when I told him I was making this, but then he really liked it when he tasted it. It is really creamy and rich. I will be passing this recipe on to all my cook friends.

This pudding had a very good flavor.  It turned out thick and creamy.  I would suggest tempering the eggs when making this.  Also, I felt the cooking time was too long.  I will definitely be making it again keeping those things in mind.  It is a quick and easy recipe using ingredients I always have on hand.  Thanks Erica!

YUM!! Very good and easy to make.  I like my raisins as soft as possible so I soaked them in the egg & 1/2 cup milk mixture for about an hour with cinnamon.  And I like my rice pudding cold (just seems the way I've always eaten it!) so if you like it cold, I suggest cooking it for a little less time so it's a little more liquidy (is that a word?) because mine from the fridge is more solid than anything.  I highly recommend!!

This was very good while it was hot. When I put the rest in the fridge and ate it the next day, it was not "creamy" at all, just a very sticky texture. Also, it was not sweet enough, in my opinion. I am going to try again with a mix between evaporated milk and regular milk as well as adding some more sugar.

This recipe was great!! I have never had and/or made rice pudding before and this was easy and delicious!!! I am so very impressed with this amazing recipe. I gave it a 5 star but since my husband only gave it a 4 star, so I figured 5 is only for the out of this world items.

I don't know what happened but I ended up with hot rice and sweet milk. I followed the directions exactly and it never thickened up or became creamy.It was like sweet rice soup. I will look for another recipe.

Easy, creamy, and yummy...  simply perfect.  The only change I made was use 1.5 cup of skim milk and 0.5 cup of half and half

We doubled the recipe with great success. I followed others' advice and whisked the egg in the milk before adding to the rice, and this turned out perfectly.

A keeper!

It wasn't as great as I expected it would be and for some odd reason I liked it better when I left it in the fridge overnight. May try this recipes again, not sure.

I read some of the comments before I made it, and decided to add a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg, and it made it absolutely delicious.  This recipe has a gorgeous texture.

Rice pudding is one of my all-time favorite desserts. I often make a traditional Mexican arroz con leche. But I am also addicted to Kozy Shack, so when I read the reviews for this recipe I was pretty excited. I thought I had finally found a recipe to satisfy my craving for a custard-type store bought rice pudding. The recipe is super easy to prepare (I almost always have leftover rice on hand) and it smelled delicious while cooking. However, the final product just didn't live up to my expectations. I found it to be quite rich and not milk-y tasting like Kozy Shack. I might make it again though, if I was craving rice pudding and wanted it FAST!

Excellent recipe! My husband loves rice pudding and this recipe was a winner with him.  As a bonus, my 13 yr. old daughter, who will rarely try anything new also loves this dish and begged me to make it the next morning for breakfast!

YUMMO!  It is such an easy treat to fix, and it is fool proof.  I love it hot and cold.  I think it is more like 6 servings than 4.  I made it for my boyfriend and he loved it.  The next night (when we didn't have any left) he asked me to make it again.  I am tempted to make it three nights in a row.  : )  Very Good!

I don't feel fair giving this a rating, because I made huge substitutions. I only had jasmine rice and vanilla soy milk on hand. I also chilled the finished product, cause my husband likes rice pudding cold. With these subs, this was not very good. The texture was sticky and very solid (not at all creamy). The flavor was decent at best. I just wanted to warn others not to try what I did with what seems like it should be a great recipe!

This recipe was so easy and so awesome!  My family loved it.  Although after adding milk and sugar, I didn't have to cook it for 15 more minutes.  I cooked it barely more than 10 minutes.  And it was thick and creamy.  I also added a whole teaspoon of vanilla, because we love the vanilla taste.

Amazing rice pudding.  I omitted the raisins and doubled the vanilla and cinnamon, and it came out perfect.  Thank you!

This is the best rice pudding I have ever made. I also used a cinnamon stick while cooking and started with leftover rice. I skipped step one and went right to two. Very easy and delicious.Excellent warm.

Quite yummy.  I used left over rice that was in the fridge for a few days, so I had to cook and stir on med heat longer (25 or 30 min or so) before it got thick and creamy because my rice was very cold to begin with.  It was a little too sweet for my taste, but all in all it's pretty good.

I made this recipe last week & I'm making it again today-I'd give it more
than 5 stars if I could-rice pudding is
one of my husband's favourites so I made this one for his birthday-the best
we have ever tasted & was so easy to make!-Thank you

EXCELLENT !!
i have to say this was my first attempt ever to make rice pudding.although this is one of my favourite comfort foods, i always shyed away from it, thinking it will never turn out... to my surprise, it was easy - followed recipe to a T , except i added more sugar.thank you erica for a great recipe.

I used this recipe and it was wonderful!!! Tasted just like grandmas! I did however add some cinnamon and baked it for 20 minutes on 350. I just like mine baked. This was wonderful either way.

This was absolutely fabulous warm, but I found it really gluey and unappetizing cold. I love cold leftover rice pudding for breakfast, but I couldn't stomach this one cold. Definitely a recipe I'll use when I know that it will all be eaten right away, but not one that I'll use if I expect leftovers.

I have made and enjoyed this several times now. It is equally delicious with or without the raisins, warm or cold. This recipe has replaced my Grandmothers version in the family favorites recipe box.

Loved it - I used low fat milk and Splenda and it still turned out great. I had to use a little more Splenda but that's about all the changes I made. Very quick, easy and the product is great!

I love rice pudding, but usually buy it in the store.  Not anymore! I love this recipe and it is so quick.  I skipped step 1 because I already had cooked rice left over from dinner - and I didn't have raisins.  It's still wondeful.  I'll bet it's just as good cold.

Didn't work up to my expectations. The rice cooks better in a rice maker, it's less moist that way. If the rice is too moist, the entire pudding turns liquidy. to balance that out, i added less milk in the end.

I thought this could have been a little creamier.  I added cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves for better flavor.  I also like subsituting 1/2 of the white sugar for brown.

I hate rice pudding......until I made this for my husband and son. They loved it and it was so easy. I decided to try a little after they raved on and on. To my suprise I love it to, and I can't stand the store bought stuff that I've been exposed to. This however rocks and I will continue to make it with cinnamon and a little nutmeg on top. :)

Wow, this came perfectly creamy. It was so tasty I didn't even bother with the cinnamon. A warning though, 3/4 cups of rice yields more than the 1 1/2 cups needed. So measure it out because otherwise this recipe will lose its amazing texture.

Many thanks to the originator of this recipe.we had a small dinner party last night and your recipe was a big hit! we were a bit concerned with the outcome since several of our guests had never tried rice pudding. but lo and behold! As the dish was served all that was heard around the table were moans and groans of delight! Thanks again Timmy and julie, The Dinner Party Gurus.

I loved this recipe.  My boyfriend who has never had rice pudding loved it also.  I think next time I will leave out the raisins, as I am not a big raisin fan.  Thanks for sharing with everyone.

excellent!  I added a little bit more sugar because I have a sweet tooth.  Everyone in my family loved it.

I was not a rice pudding lover until the wife made this one. Wouldn't change a thing as it is as good as it gets this way.

I found this recipe to be easy to make and delicious.  However, I was the only person in my family to think so.   I will probably make it again for myself anyhow.  Great with nutmeg!  :o)

I always thought my mom made the best rice pudding, but it turns out, I DO!  Just kidding!  This recipe was wonderful; we really enjoyed it.  I suggest Trader Joe's vanilla paste if you can get it.  Yum!

This was a really good recipe for rice pudding, the flavour was excellent.  The only reason we didn't give it 5 stars is because we found there were way to many raisins, and there was no cinnamon.  We will make this again, but reduce the amount of raisins by half (only 1/3 cup) and add some cinnamon to taste.

This was indeed five stars.  My husband loves rice pudding and normally I wouldn't care but this was delicious and easy.  My Hubby added cinnamon as that is how he likes it but did say without it was great - it reminded him of his Grandmas! :)

This was fairly good, but I increased the sugar and added cinnamon.  Still a little bland, next tme I'll add nutmeg and more milk.  Mine was a bit gummy, but still good.

Loved it!  I've tried several different recipes for baked and stovetop rice pudding.  This is the winner by far!  It was the perfect consistency, with just the right amount of sweetness.  I don't usually put raisins in my rice pudding, but I liked the golden raisins in this one.  I'll probably make it without the raisins for my kids.

Truly satisfying. I added a bit more sugar because I like my pudding pretty sweet but otherwise made no changes. I would highly recommend this.

I'm not sure what all the fuss was about.  My family did not care for it.  We picked out the raisins.  The pudding was not creamy enough, according to 2 family members.  I used the best ingredients, but something was lacking.  Won't make this one again.  Sorry.

There is only one word for this pudding...AWESOME...This is the best Rice Pudding I have ever made...and I'm not a big rice pudding fan..but my DH loves it! The only thing I did different was by adding an additional 1/2 c. of milk and I only used 1/3 c. of (dark) raisins...Thanks Erica & of course as always Allrecipe..

Very tasty! It came out perfectly both times that I made it. It tasted great hot, and the next day cold from the fridge it was just as good. I will definately keep this recipe and make it again.

Delicious!  This was a hit, even with my picky son, who kept asking for more.  The only thing is, my husband said he would like it better with more pudding and less rice, as it is VERY thick.  I think I will try adding more milk next time.  Definately a keeper and so easy to make!

I thought that this recipe could use a tad bit more liquid--it came out with a little too much rice and not enough pudding.  I didn't have golden raisins, so I used dark raisins and added a little cinnamon and nutmeg.  Aside from the thickness, the flavor is AWESOME!!!  I have tried several different rice pudding recipes, none of which I have particularly liked.  This is by far the best--next time I'll just add a little more milk (or half and half).

This is the very best rice pudding I have ever had!  It is so cream with just the perfect amount of everything!  I always have to atleast double it, it goes to fast.  My 18 years old daughter can never get enough.  I do leave out the raisins, just because I am not a fan. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE!

Very easy to make, creamy, and delicious. I add some cinnamon which isn't in the recipe for some contrast against the sweetness of the raisins but the pudding is good even without this added step. I have used this recipe several times and will do so in the future.

I am living in South Korea.  I am always looking for things to do with my excess rice (not to mention it is one of the few things I can cook thus far with the ingredients available).  This is wonderful!  Just a few things I'll do different next time: use 1/2 the raisins (we used regular instead of golden, and I think the flavor is a bit more potent), try to get my hands on some nutmeg (we used cinnamon which is definately a must!).  I did notice the first bite was a bit bland, but once my overly spiced (Korean food!) taste buds adjusted, it was just right!!  Nice treat, though much too sweet for a breakfast food (as one reviewer suggested), though I guess Americans eat doughnuts for breakfast sometimes, don't we?

Instead of incorporating the raisins into the pudding, I served the pudding chilled and poured warm raisins that had soaked in Sambuca and lemon juice overnight. Great flavors.

The flavor of this was very good.  However it is too thick when chilled in the refrigerator.  It was still good when it was thick and chilled, though.

This was nice & creamy and easy to make but tasted a bit bland. Added some cinnamon but still tasted like something was missing. Just not quite what we are looking for. Will keep searching for a keeper.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe.  Quick and easy to make, however, I did think it was a tad bit bland.  After stiring in the butter and vanilla I also added a bit of allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon and just a dash of clove and ginger(a pampered chef spice called cinnamon plus has all these spiced in one shaker.  I thought it still needed a little bit more flavor so I added just a touch of Bailey's Irish Cream. Mmmm  PREFECT!!!!  I think this is now a 5 star recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!!

I have never had rice pudding before but a friend told me to try it. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. I added an extra 1/3 cup raisins, a little extra vanilla, then added some cinnamon and sugar before serving. It tastes really good!!! It reminds me of oatmeal and I love oatmeal. My boyfriend thought it was pretty good. He is used to it cold and I served it warm. He says he'll eat it again if I make it--so I will!!

My husband always talks about his grandmas' rice pudding from when he was a little boy and he says this is just as good!!!  Quite a compliment.  I also made the plum pudding sauce for it and that was the perfect touch.

Yummy!  I never had warm rice pudding before, but tried this anyway.  It was great!  Once I put it in the fridge it kinda became hard, not very creamy.  I guess next time I will add a little more liquid if I want to eat it cold, but warm was definately a nice surprise.

Delicious and easy! Made this today. Just right for two. My husband loved it.   However, I used 2 eggs & dark raisins. I also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon & 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg when adding the vanilla. Thanks!

I doubled the recipe, held the raisins. My intention was to make a recipe comparable to the Kheer Rice Pudding I always get at my favorite Indian Resturant. All in all came pretty close. I suggest for those who have it, adding a 1/4 tsp of cardamom to the final product or 2 seeds if whole. You'll love the surprise it gives to the taste.

I took a chance and doubled this recipe.  It was awesome!  This is what I did different:

I did not add the salt.  I kept the rice in the same pot.  I added cinnamon in with the beaten eggs & milk.

I ran out of milk so instead of adding the extra 1/2 cup of milk (1 cup for me as I doubled the recipe) I used 1 cup of heavy (whipping) cream.

I also threw in a few drops of butter flavoring even though I added the butter.  I didn't have the golden raisins so I used the regular dark ones.

This was so creamy any yummy!  My DH loved it, he had been pining for rice pudding.  We had 2 small bowls ... wait make that 2 small bowls each (LOL) before dinner and the rest of it is in the fridge cooling now.  I don't know how thick it will be when it cools ... if it is too thick, I'll just add a touch of 1/2 and 1/2 to it.

Thank you Erica for this great recipe.  I'd definately make this one again.

Very good immediately- but after chilling the rice was too hard and I needed to add more milk.  Definately one of the better rice pudding recipes, but not nearly the best!

Pretty good.  I had to add quite a bit more milk (maybe 1/2 cup, I just added a bit at a time).  I also added some cinnamon at the end, and omitted the raisins.

Mmmm,

I've never had rice pudding warm before. Yummy!

It is also good cold.

Loved it!

I added a touch of nutmeg to the custard also.

This was the best-ever stove top recipe for rice pudding that I have ever made.  Super creamy!! I used dark raisins instead of golden (personal preference) and added a touch of nutmeg.  Next time I will try without the raisins for a change.  Can be beaten, in my book!

Tastes pretty good but it curdled and seperated like crazy!  I am very disapointed considering everyone that made this rated it so high!  I'm pretty sure I did everything right.  I think I'll stick to my Mom's old recipe from now on.

I had the sudden urge one day to make something, and rice was all I had at home to work with... so I tried out this rice pudding recipie! This recipie is extremely simple and tastes like the real thing. Just don't try it if you're not a huge rice pudding fan like me. :) Oh yeah, tastes great with custard (according to my friends).

Good base recipe, however I found I needed much more milk than the recipe called for to get the rice to release enough gluten to be more puddinglike and less like a creamy rice dish.  I wanted my rice more broken down, I guess.  Unfortunately I didn't figure this out until after I'd added the sugar and egg, and it's difficult to go back to 'cook' the rice some more.  Overall this recipe was tasty and since I'll be using more milk (at least a cup more, maybe more) I also will increase vanilla and sugar.

i didn't have any eggs in the house so i left that out.  i also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg, which gave the rice pudding a nice speckled color.  i also used dark raisins instead of golden, since that's what i had on hand.  the rice pudding came out really well, and i plan on using this recipe again.

This was great! I have just made it and i can't wait for everyone else to taste it. I am going to bring some to work tomorrow for friends to taste. I didn't use golden raisins i used regular and not nearly as much as the recipe called for because my kids aren't big on them. But other than that i followed the recipe to the tee! GREAT!

I haven't had rice pudding since I was a child.  My mother always made the best.  This recipe is very close to hers.  Thanks for sharing, I'll definitely make it again.

Excellent recipe... I offered to make dessert at Easter and told my grandma about "discovering" rice pudding.  She was so excited because her mom used to make it but she didn't get the recipe before she passed on.  I was quite nervous because I wanted her to really enjoy it.  It turned out to be a hit!

DELICIOUS !! All 4 of my children ate this (even the picky toddler). It was easy and the first rice pudding that was not over or under done. We liked Cozy Shack but now I can make my own! Thank you.

Wow!!  This was easy to make and the outcome was wonderful.  I grew up eating rice pudding with my Amma, it was one of her favorites, and became one of mine as well.  She is gone now but this was a wonderful little reminder of her and the special times we spent together.  A very good recipe, I will make this again and again, since its the closest thing to her recipe.  Thank you for sharing.  Sherri

It's a "Keeper". This is my first time making rice pudding, I was not really a fan of the stuff before, I made it for my wife and daughter. Now I love it, it's got to be "THIS" recipe!!! Can make it anytime, it's got stuff that you always have on hand. 
Thanks for a new family favorite.

Hi,
I perform in the band called Johnny Green & The Greenmen.  
We, my employer, Johnny Green, and I  have a friend, Johnny Zestos, in Saginaw, MI, who's Greek and owns several restaurants.  He always gives his rice pudding to his friends.  This recipe is comparable to his.  Kudos!

The BEST I've ever tasted and/or made!!  I just made some this morning, tasted it when it was done, and immediately started making another batch for my mom.  Thanks, Erica!!  Fool-proof and perfect for that white rice you never eat from Chinese take-out!!

I have been searching for months for a great rice pudding recipe -- something that would remind me of home and "snow days."  This did the trick.  It was an easy recipe to follow and is just soooo delicious. I added some spice and it tastes just like my mom's.  Thanks Erica.
