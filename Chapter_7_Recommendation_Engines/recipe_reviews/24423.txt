SO EASY!  I used Pilsbury Classic Yellow cake mix (w/ pudding in the mix) and they were delicious!  The cookies were even better the next day.  Be careful not to over cook them.  I took mine out the second I saw a very light golden color around the sides.  I let them continue cooking on the baking sheet until they were cool enough to sample- then off the the cooling rack.  Betty Crocker Extra Moist cake mix has worked well for me too. :)

It might not be the BEST cookie you've ever had but it probably will be the easiest you've ever made.

It also works well with a chocolate cake mix, which my family prefers.

----

I no longer own an electric beater and found that this recipe can be done with a big spoon. Just cut the butter in with a knife and fork first.

This is an easy recipe for the whole family.  I can have my 3yr old add ingredients because there is not much measuring or I can have my 13yr old just make the whole thing.  These are so good they usually don’t last through the night.  I too love chocolate and also found it best to only use 1.5 cups of chips.  Also,  on one occasion I didn’t have any yellow mix  so we used white and it was still SO good!  I am actually wondering what it would be like to use carrot cake with walnuts and perhaps a dollop of cream cheese frosting?

I was skeptical about making these - I just didn't think cake mix would make a good cookie but I was wrong!  We've already made 2 batches and they both turned out wonderfully.  Easier than my other chocolate chip recipes too.  1 1/2 cups of chips was plenty for us though.  A definite keeper for me!

Wow!  Great cookies.  Don't use Duncan Hynes, though.  I had best luck with Pillsbury.

This is very easy, I'll give it that.  Not my favorite, though.  Mine didn't come out chewy in the middle, more cake-like.  They are yellow and the house smelled of yellow cake mix.  The kids liked it.  I don't think I'll make this one again, though.  There are other better ones on this site.

We LOVE these cookies!!  My husband, son and I ate the first batch before the second batch was done cooking!  They were so easy and fool proof.  My son and I have a new song and dance called "yummy & delicious," inspired by these cookies!!  I noticed some of the reviews said cut back on chocolate chips, I did a bit but...Can you have too many chocolate chips...ever????

This was a very good and easy recipe.Infact my 12 year old basically made it for us.I did take other reviewers advice and cut down the chocolate chips to 1 cup. It was a perfect amount.Thank you for the recipe, will definitely make it again!

This recipe is so easy and versitile. I changes the mix to red velvet and used white chips. Also, try spice cake with butterscotch chips, or devils food cake with peanutbutter chips. You can use just about any cake mix and add your own special touch with what ever kind of chips you like. Be creative and make up your own!! This is also a great project to make with little kids.

These cookies are incredibly easy to put together, but taste sooo yummy! I didn't have a full two cups of chocolate chips...more like 1 1/4. This was plenty for me, and I really love chocolate, so that's saying a lot! The key to making these is to take them out of the oven before you think they're done, because the bake more while just sitting on the baking sheets. That way, the cookies are nice, soft, and chewy with no burnt edges. My family loves these cookies; I've made them with chocolate cake mix and white chocolate chips as well, and they're wonderful that way too! Thanks for sharing the recipe...I'll be making these again!

This is a standard "cake mix cookie" recipe, but respectable and acceptable nonetheless.  If you're pressed for time (or just lazy) this will serve you well.  I added 2 T. vegetable oil and 1/2 tsp. almond extract (I'll try anything to hide that cake mix taste). Hubs walked in the door from work, ate a couple, said, "Mmmm," without ever mentioning that they tasted of cake mix.  A winner.

I made these with only one egg and they came out more like cookies and less like cake. You have to watch them carefully or they will burn before they're done in the middle. Using a 325 degree oven and a longer baking time may help. Also, using a full bag of choco chips is possible, but you have to work a little harder to get get your dough to stay together, so be warned! Altogether a pretty good cookie, soft and chewy, but a little different than traditional recipes. I used Pillsbury yellow cake mix with pudding and they came out great!

I needed a quick desert/treat for a last minute sleepover and these were easy and I had everything already in the house!  Kids loved them and requested chocolate with peanut butter chips next time.  Cheap, easy and no mess!  Woo Hoo!

These cookies had a great flavor and texture.  However, they came out of the oven very flat.  Since my teen daughter made these I gave her an important tip- Chill the cookie dough before baking and ALWAYS place the chilled cookie dough on cold baking sheets.  The cookie won't spread out and have the consistency of a flat pancake but a fluffy cookie that it should be.  Enjoy!

SO quick and easy and GOOD!  My oldest grandson ALWAYS wants my choc chip cookies when they stay overnight, or he feels deprived!  The other night it was late, and I was tired and turned to this recipe hoping for a quick fix.  He was so upset as they were baking, and he could smell the cake-y scent, cause he KNEW they just weren't going to be as good... but one bite and we ALL smiled REAL BIG!  Man, if these aren't as good as my regular recipe they might even be better!

It's such a mind trick to eat these and remember that they're yellow cake mix cookies. We gave these to our neighbors who loved them and didn't believe they were made with yellow cake mix.

This recipe was ridiculously easy and my cookies turned out great. I used the chocolate chips (regular size) that I had on hand which was about 1 cup. I 'cut in' the softened butter as another reviewer had suggested and did use 2 eggs (size Large) and the 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I opted to have the oven at 325 degrees because of what other reviewers had said. My oven is gas so what I did was watch the cookies carefully after about 10 minutes. When I saw the edges were golden brown, I took out from the oven. Your oven will be different so just watch them carefully the first time you make them and you'll then know how many minutes they need to be in the oven. The cookies were perfect...soft and chewy top through middle and the bottom was golden brown and more crunch as you bit through the cookie.  You can taste the 'mix' in the cookie but in a good way. Next time I make another batch I will also add some pecans or other nuts and I think it will give it another dimension. Oh, another thing, I used a dark color cookie sheet...ungreased, and no parchment paper and there was nothing stuck to it, the cookies never spread out except to form perfectly shaped cookies. I used Betty Crocker Yellow cake mix with no pudding in the mix. GREAT RECIPE for an easy cookie. We loved it.

Simple and delicious!  I recommend baking it at 325 degrees for a more even browning.  my first batch at 350 degrees was white in the middle and brown on the edges.  happy baking!

These are not so great.  The kids enjoyed making them, but they were just too sweet (?) or something... I'm not sure how to describe it.  I used Pillsbury, real butter, 1.5 c. of chocolate chips, watched them like a hawk so they would cook the proper time... and I would say I was definitely disappointed and hoping for better cookies.  Stick to the traditional chocolate chip cookie mix if you have the time.  It really doesn't take much longer for a much better cookie.  Thanks for the fun recipe anyway.   UPDATE: whoever said these are better the next day was DEFINITELY correct.  Much better, but still not spectacular.

These were better than I expected. I was expecting the cake mix flavor to come through.  I used Betty Crocker. I only used 1 1/2 cups of chips and it was plenty. Super easy.

These are oh so good and talk about easy!  Wow, I normally don't like baking cookies but these are so easy to make that you have to try them.  Anyway I would suggest that you only cook them for 11 minutes so they stay nice and soft.

As I write this with a mouth full of cookie I mumble to my husband "these cookies are good!" These are amazing! they taste like REAL chocolate chip cookies! The yellow dough is a little odd (especially b/c I'm bringing them to a potluck)I used Duncan Heins mix, and they are great! AWESOME recipe!

What an easy alternative to regular chocolate chip cookies! I had a little trouble with them burning around the edges and then being raw in the middle, but I switched to a different baking pan and then they were fine. Very soft texture. Thanks!

I've been making these for awhile now, glad to see someone else loves them as much as I do and has posted the recipe for everyone! I add brown sugar and an extra splash of vanilla to mine though, to make them taste like the more traditional chocolate chip cookie. For an extra twist I add in walnuts sometimes. I never have any leftovers when I take them to gatherings! SO easy and quick, a MUST go-to recipe.

Great!  I didn't have any cake mix so I used the "David's Yellow Cake" recipe I found on this site as well and they turned out just dandy!   I will agree about watching them closely.  No brown sugar means they will not get as dark as you would normally expect.

This is the easiest cookie recipe I've ever tried. There are so many variations to it. You can use any mix and substitute any add ins. I even used it to make white chocolate chip/ macadamia nut cookies that seriously rivaled Otis Spunkmeyer's version. :)    The key is to use softened butter...but not directly from your microwave. It has to be room temperature.

2 cups of c/chips is way too much, and I have a sweet tooth. I added 1/2 cup per others reviews and it was still a bit much because this cookie is very sweet. I think I will try this recipe next time with chopped nuts in order to cut down on sweetness. Overall this is a good recipe if you need to whip up something quick. The cookie has a chewy texture which is nice.

EXCELLENT! I can't believe how these few ingredients could produce such a wonderful cookie. NOTE: These make soft, cake-like cookies (which I LOVE), so if you're not a fan of those, then do not attempt this one. However, if you are, definately give these a try. My only change was to use mini chocolate chips in place of the regular. These cookies are a definate keeper, and one I will be making often! Thanks for sharing. :)

Wow -- I am surprised at all the great reviews.  I found that the cookies tasted way too much like cake mix.  Perhaps it was so noticeable to me and my husband because I never use cake mix.  My (seemingly endless) quest for the perfect chocolate chip cookie continues.

Easy and good! Fast and easy is a selling point with me and this was for sure easy and fast. The only suggestion I have is that these cookies don't brown like other recipes. They are done when the edges start to brown up. Take them out of the oven when this starts, otherwise they will over cook.

These cookies were fantastically simple to prepare, look great, and taste great. They smell like the Piece of Cake ice cream. However, I thought that 2 cups of chocolate chips seemed excessive so I used 1 1/2.

Yeah, if you're looking at this recipe and thinking "cake mix..? Is that really going to taste okay?," then just make them. They're so simple and tasty! I'm making them for all my friends at school and my family keeps walking by and taking a few. Personally, I think they're really good if you just leave them kind of bite-sized. I put three trays in the oven at 325 on convection for 12 minutes and they were perfect. I used betty croker super moist yellow cake mix. They taste very much like homemade cookies. I usually prefer to make homemade, but because I was going for the "240 servings" way, I decided that this was the easy way out. The perfect recipe for little school goodie bags! :)

These cookies are amazing! My daughter and I are not fans of crunchy cookies, so these turned out perfect! Her entire face lit up with the first bite and then she said they were the best cookies ever! I only had a white cake mix on hand, so I used that. Also, I didn't have any vanilla but the mix didn't need it anyway. Will be adding this to my favorites!

Yummy and oh so quick and easy.  I used chocolate cake mix and butterscotch chips because that is what I have on hand.  The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star review was because the texture wasn't a chewy cookie.  It did have a bit of brownie/cake type texture.  But the taste was great and they were so easy that I was able to whip up a batch on a busy night to bring to my son's school tomorrow.

A very good recipe! It was quick and easy! Instead of using yellow cake mix I used Devil's Food cake mix and I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips which was already plenty. I definitely recommend this recipe!

Easy Yes.  Good No!  They do not taste at all like traditional chocolate chips cookies.  My husband had no idea how they were made and said"They taste like cake not cookies"  Disappointing and a waste of cake mix and chocolate chips.  I only had 1 stick of butter in the refrigerator so I could not make the usual toll house recipe so tried this one after reading the rave reviews.  Mistake

I don't know what went wrong with this recipe, but I got terrible results! I wanted to whip up a quick batch of cookies before work one afternoon, and I had read this one before and selected it to try, since it seemed so easy. I set the temp as directed, but the cookies burned after just 5 minutes. I didn't have time to try to save the batter right then, so I put the rest of the mix in the fridge. A couple of days later, I tried it again, this time reducing the temp. They turned out a little better, but still not good results. I was looking forward to a fast, easy cookie recipe, and I'm very disappointed :-(

Absolutely delicious!  Although I did double the recipe and only used 3 cups of chips which was way more than enough!  They were such a big hit!

My Mom used to male cake mix cookies back in the seventies, to send to me at college, so I'm familiar with the concept. Haven't seen them around for many years, but definitely a time saver! I added a little cinnamon and an additional teaspoon of vanilla to cut the "box" taste. Great for a picnic or to have an extra dessert at a party, or just when you're short on ingredients and need a cookie. Little kids will like them, adults will notice the difference from the made from scratch type. But try it!

Very easy recipe to follow - comes together in minutes.  The taste of the cookie is good.  My only suggestion would be to use mini muffin pan rather cookie sheet.  My first batch fell apart on the cookie sheet.  2nd batch in the mini muffin pan was perfect.  Don't forget to oil the pan b/c the dough is just like cake and will stick otherwise.

These were good. I give 5 stars for easiness and tastiness. Mine were not cakey. Mine took a good 14-15 minutes to bake. Baked on parchment, simple clean up.

These are the EASIEST cookies to make and they're delicious! I've made two batches. For the first, I used yellow cake mix as called for in the recipe and the cookies turned out baking, looking and tasting wonderfully. But for the second batch, I used orange supreme cake mix and I have to say the second batch edged out the first batch. It's hard to beat the orange and chocolate flavor combination. Still, this recipe definitely earns a 5- star rating for it's simplicity and versatility. I'm sure any number of flavored cake mixes would result in awesome cookies. This is one's a keeper. Excellent job Sherri!

This is better than the "regular" way of making chocolate chip cookies. I made minor changes only due to what I had available in the kitchen. I used Duncan Hines marble cake mix, mixed the white and the chocolate cake mix together. I didn't have any vanilla to use. I used up the bag of chocolate chips I had left, maybe 1 1/2 cups. These were so easy and not a lot of mess. I will absolutely make these again. My husband had eaten 5 before they even cooled! Thanks Sherri!

This was the easiest cookie recipe I ever made.  I only did half the receipe and used Pillsbury devil food cake mix.  The cookie came out perfectly round, high and soft. I only baked them for 12 minutes. My next try will be with pumpkin spice or pumpkin cake mix.  You can't go wrong with this recipe!

A very good cookie, Indeed! I added a bit of Almond extract to these cookies for a bit more flavor, and they turned out perfect. Simple to make for a quick sugar fix. They're very rich, though, so make sure to have some milk at hand!

Hands down, the best "easy" chocolate chip cookies I have ever had. They are wonderful. Just the right amount of sweetness. I did not cook them more than 11 minutes and they were just right. :)

the cookies were easy to make and look nice. In my opinion, there were too many chocolate chips and the batter/dough is way too sweet compared to a true homemade cookie. It worked to satisfy my daughter's craving to bake, but we'll stick with the old fashioned cookies from scratch next time

These cookies were great. My little brother really wanted me to make cookies and I ran out of flour, but had cake mix in hand. These came out perfectly! They are delicious. I only used 5 tablespoon butter and that was enough. I also learned the hard way to not melt the butter. The dough got too sticky to work with when I melted the butter. Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies were EASY and taste GREAT.  If you are short on time or ingredients, or if you just want a tasty, chewy cookie, try this out.   I used regular chocolate chips, semi-sweet chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, and white chips - and the cookies were great, crunchy on the bottom, chewy in the middle.

These were actually pretty decent considering that they are so simple to make. They aren't like toll-house or anything, but hey, for the ingredients involved, they're darned good. I used store brand cake mix but was a cup shy since I had used it for a recipe, so I made up the difference with baking mix and some white sugar. I used milk chocolate chips and didn't quite have the full amount, but it didn't matter to my family. They liked these fine.

The plus for this recipe was the ease to make.  The taste was pleasant enough, but certainly not like cookies, rather like firm, really sweet, chocolate chip cake.

I've never been able to bake anything without messing it up before, so when I started this recipe, I was doubtful. I was so impressed with the results that I could almost cry. The temperature was perfect, the time was perfect. The texture was perfect. Moist and delicious. I'm really surprised. A tip I learned from a friend though, is as soon as you take them out of the oven, tap the pan a few times on the counter to spread out the cookies and release any air pockets. You won't be disappointed.

These are absolutely wonderful! You can have warm gooey chocolate chip cookies in a flash... and only dirty up one pan! I even did bar cookies and mixed it all in the cake pan.  Had to cut the chips back a bit though and I love chocolate.  Its best with only a couple handfuls of chips I think. YUM!

Great!  I've never made cookies from a cake mix before, and was a little skeptical, but go ahead and try them - you'll be pleasantly surprised!  Thanks for the recipe!

These taste a lot like chocolate chip pancakes. I made it vegan using duncan hines yellow cake mix and applesauce/baking powder instead of eggs. They aren't the best cookies ever, but they are easy and fill the dessert craving you may have...

Amazing, truly.  The best I've had.  Tastes best a little underdone in my opinion.  That way after 30 minutes out of the oven, they don't feel too hard.

This recipe is the easiest, most awesome cookie recipe I have ever tried! (Seriously, I followed these instructions and assembled them in like 5 mins flat - excluding cooking time of course :) ) Only I cooked them for 18 mins since they looked really pale at 15 mins - could just be the yellow cake mix ya kno :) - but they looked totally awesome when I pulled them out of the oven; and tasted even better!

This is just what I was looking for! I buy cake mixes by the case when my grocery store has its case lot sales, so I am always looking for ways to use them. I used 1 1/2 c. milk chocolate chips because that's all I had. I definitely think 2 c. semisweet would be better! I can't wait to try this recipe with different variations, like chocolate cake mix and vanilla chips.

Tastes too much like cake mix, not chocolate chip cookies. Easy, but not much easier then measuing out separate ingredients. I feel like I wasted good ingredients. My cookies came out flat and dry. Meh

I didn't read all the reviews so I don't know if anyone else did this but all I had was chocolate cake mix and so I used that and added only one and a quarter cups of chips as well as macadamia nuts,.,,,,REALLY GOOD!  It was also really easy for my three year old to help make these (even though I wasn;t thrilled about giving her all that chocolate!!) P.S. perhaps to the person who burned these after only 5 min - did you have your oven rack in the top middle position?? If you had your rack too low this may have caused them to burn....

For cookies made from a cake mix they're exactly what you would expect(good or bad-you decide). Cakey, super sweet. My son & daughter love them. Thank you for a super easy recipe on an I-don't-have-anything-sweet-in-the-house-but-don't-feel-like-baking day:)

this tastes nothing like a traditional choc chip cookie.  Its not bad, if you are looking for a cookie that tastes just like cake and choc chips put together.  The recipe should be renamed to "Chocolate Chip Cake Cookie"

We really, really liked it, so super-easy to make it. I made it for my son's therapist, interpreter, and distance-relatives and they loved it! They were shocked after I told them that I used cake mix to make the cookies! Will definitely make it again when the holidays comes around! Thanks!

These were amazing!  All you really need is the mix, eggs (I used egg whites), a bit of butter and water.  Also my family absolutely loved them... these are so easy to make.  They are one of those recipes that you don't really need to follow the exact recipe.  Even if you stray a little, they will still be amazing!  You can also just make enough for 1 cookie, or 4.  You don't need to make 12, or 48, as the original recipe is for.  AMAZING!!!!!!!

Certainly easy to make, but I thought they were just okay.  The texture was fine--chewy and soft--but the flavor was not a satisfactory stand in for a more classic chocolate chip cookie.  The cookies seemed to have a sugary, preservative flavor that I didn't care for.  If you're looking for a traditional chocolate chip cookie, this is probably not the recipe for you.

These were good cookies.  They are EASY to make; however, my husband is a chocolate chip cookie-a-holic, and he rated them as "ok".   I'm going back to the old recipe.

I can't stress enough how wonderful this recipe is! I was a little leery using the yellow cake mix as I'm not a fond of cake, but seeing as there isn't as much egg and no water or oil added the consistency is different. I did not have any problems with these. They stuck together nicely and were moist! 5 stars!!!

I was pretty disappointed with these cookies... there was no "ooey gooey goodness"!  They were extremely dry and cake-like (I guess I shoul have expected that!), and the chocolate chips didn't even melt inside.  I used 1 cup chocolate chips instead of two as other suggested, and even added a 1/4 cup milk to the second half of the batch when the first came out so dry.  I also melted some butter and brushed on the top for the last 3 minutes to help get some browning/crispness - did not help.  I won't be making these again :(

These were better than expected. I used a Devil's Food cake mix. Actually two mixes as I realized a bit late in the game that my box was not 18.25 ounces so I stole three ounces (or so) from one box to make up the difference. Definitely something to be aware of for next time. Thanks for a good recipe.

This recipe was EXACTLY what I looking for.  I was short on time and did not want to deal with a recipe that had 20+ ingredients.  A+ all the way.

Very good and especially simple to make cookie. It was soft the first day and then turned crunchier...still just as tasty though. Will keep this one.

These are awesome! I've made these several times and a few weeks ago, my husband was looking to make some cookies, quick. I brought up this recipe and he couldn't get over how easy these cookies are to make.  I forwarded the recipe to my son, who is in college. He loved the recipe too, and loved how simple the recipe is.  Kudos'! Homemade chocolate chip cookies...FAST!

Made this with Duncan Hines choc. cake mix. Really enjoyed the texture - puffy, but still chewy - not too cakey. My husband thought the double choc. flavor was good. The cookie was not too sweet.....for him. :)Thanks for the instant 'homemade' cookie recipe.

I saw this and HAD to try it.  I couldn't believe that cake mix could taste like cookies.  I'm picky, and these are delicious!!  Not as good as grandma's recipe, but nobody would know they took 5 minutes to prepare!  Better than Nestle, I'd say.

This is a phenomenally easy recipe when you do not have many ingredients.  I was truly grateful for this and my kids loved it!  Another wonderful thing about these cookies is, they stay soft for days.

SO easy- & GOOD!
they dont taste like "old-fashioned" cookies, but, they are an awesome alternative & if you take them out of the oven just as the edges are turning golden & let them cool on the pan, they will be perfect. I timed how long it actually took me to mix the ingredients & it was 2 min. Thats it!!!
My daughter & her friends love them- they never last long!

Delicious! I felt like baking one night and happened to have a box of yellow cake mix in the house. This recipe is a breeze. I used Pillsbury Reduced Sugar Yellow Cake Mix (it's made with part Splenda) and the cookies still came out fine. It is vitally important to remove the cookies and let them cool the MOMENT you see the edges start turning golden. Very good recipe.

I used Duncan Hines Yellow Cake Mix (Butter Recipe).  I followed the directions exactly - but they came out with a really funny taste.  My kids liked them though of course!  I will try this recipe again (b/c it was SO easy) with a regular yellow cake mix and maybe they will turn out better.

this is best with cake mix that does NOT have pudding in the mix.  Everyone in my family loves these cookies.  They are so easy and they are so soft and delicious.  Also, don't let them bake until brown, just until they are set, and I think they taste best when they have fully cooled.

easy quick and yummy! Made it with my preschoolers We added rolled oats and coconut as our regular choc chip recipe has it and it needed something to stretch it abit after we added all the choc chips. Next time I would add less chips even though I usually add more to recipes!

These are soooo yummy! My husband was trying to steal cookies off the pan within a minute of their coming out of the oven. I did a half-batch of cookies, and put in two handfuls of chocolate chips and two handfuls of peanut butter chips. I used a single layer yellow cake mix (Jiffy), and I left out the vanilla (I ran out yesterday). From getting the ingredients together to taking the cookies off the sheet to the wire rack, I think 20 minutes passed. Super-fast! One more thing: I melted the butter in the microwave (meant to soften it, but got distracted by my kid). The cookies turned out a little flat, but still good! Thanks for the recipe!!

These were the most delicious chocolate chip cookies I've ever made. My husband was skeptical at first about using cake mix and then I couldn't keep him from eating it! My girls loved it too. It's a little tricky getting it off the beaters after mixing because it is so thick. Other than that, this is so easy to make and the cookies just melt in your mouth. If you don't want them quite so rich, reduce the amount of chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups.

You can avoid the "cakey" taste by adding 1/3 cup brown sugar to the batter. I used 1 cup of choc chips and Duncan Hines Butter Golden cake mix (the brand not recommended). I also lightly greased the cookie sheet with vegetable shortening for easy removal of thin cookies. My family loves thin crunchy cookies, and that's how these came out!

No doubt, this is a fast and easy recipe. Great for those times when you need cookies fast!  But it absolutely tastes like cake mix, not the flavor of a true homemade chocolate chip cookie.  And for the one reviewer who said it's better than the Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookie, it is nothing like that cookie, and nowhere as good.  This cookie has the taste of the top of a cupcake, not the taste of chocolate chip cookie dough.

I was looking to bake a quick batch of chocolate chip cookies and came across this recipe.  Let me tell you, I am glad that I did.  These were the easiest and tastiest cookies I have ever made.  Thank you.

Seriously - the best cookies I have ever eaten in my life. This is exactly how I want a cookie to taste. The Boyfriend is not a sweets guy and he ate 3 and would have eaten more if I hadn't moved the plate. I read the reviews posted and here is how I adapted it: Used Devil's food Chocolate cake (Pillsbury, moist)and white chocolate chips. used barely 1 cup of chips, doubled the vanilla and added a teaspoon of oil. refrigerated the dough for about 30 minutes, Baked for 10 and let them sit on the cookie sheet to finish baking. I only got 24 cookies out of the batch. Guess my version of a rounded teaspoon is a little large! Tomorrow I will do a  yellow cake with milk chocolate chips! Thanks for the amazing recipe!!

Fantastic! I've alwaysed used the Award Winning Soft Chocolate chip cookie recipe, but people love this one so much more! It's a MUCH sweeter cookie than most chocolate chip cookies. Over beating causes a more liquidy batter and flat cookies. I tried it with red velvet cake mix and with a few tweaks it was great too.

I can't say that they were the best ever, but they are definitely worth making. The recipe is very simple and easy to do, which makes this my favorite cookie recipe, not for taste but because of the simplicity. Thanks for sharing.

As far as ease of preparation, this is great, but it doesn't take much more time to make a batch of chocolate chip cookies from scratch.  These have a really weird aftertaste.  A waste of time and ingredients.

These are great with minimal work. People who aren't getting good results probably aren't using real butter. You have to use BUTTER, not margarine or oil spread.

This was super easy! I would have never guessed that these cookies would turn out so well. I was unsure of the consistency, so I added 2 T. of vegetable oil and it was fine.

This recipe is super easy to veganize, and I recommend using the Olivio Coconut-based butter substitute, as it is super rich and will add an extra dimension to these cookies. I have made these cookies three times in the past two months because everyone requests I make them again (and again). The bonus is that they're easy to make!

These are great.  I even tried making them with a strawberry cake mix.  Not bad, but a cherry cake mix might be better.  I'll have to see what I can find, maybe even just chunks of maracino cherries might do the trick with chocolate cake.  I'm a die-hard chocolate covered cherries person.

Very easy to do but it wasn't the best. Because I felt that it tasted like cake mix AND I did follow others' suggestions.  Good recipe to do in a time crunch or if you are lacking ingredients!

Good recipe!  I was a little hesitant at first because the recipe calls for cake mix.  However, they turned out great!  It will smell like a cake is baking and there is a slight cake taste to them, but they are still scrumptious!  I brought these into work and they were gone instantly.

Definitely easy to make! Virtually no measuring needed, but the flavor is too rich for my taste. I used M&M candies, but I think this dough is too sweet for those.

I made these tonight and everyone thought they were amazing! I followed the recipe on everything except I added a little extra vanilla, and I used white cake mix (because thats what I had on hand).   The dough was a little more gooey than I had expected, but it baked perfectly :) will definately be making again, and when I said this out loud, I heard 3 "yes you will" replies :)

Very, Very easy. I found that they were better after a couple days, they became way chewier. And also my brother seemed to like them a lot with cake icing on top. Not the best cookie, but very easy and decent if you're ever in a bind to show up somewhere un-emptihanded.

These are a different sort of cookie, very sticky and messy to make. I didn't have any vanilla but I don't think it really needed it. I love that they are so easy to make and everyone loved them.

So good! They are really moist and yummy. Added a little less chocolate chips though because there seemed to be a lot. The only bad thin was the dough was so sticky it took me a little while to get all the dough off the beaters.. kind of a hassle :( BUT so worth it for the taste!

So simple and so good! I barely had 1 cup of mini chocolate chip cookies, but it was a great amount! And I also added maybe 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts. Soo easy!! I'll try it w/ chocolate cake mix next time! This will definitely be a go-to recipe!!

Mehh... It taste much like yellow cake mix, and also the flavor can be a little too sweet for some people. I used the Betty Crocker Brand, and somehow these cookies of mine came out flat. Like one reviewer, I like my cookies dense. At least the recipe was quite easy to make, but the results aren't that outstanding. Slightly below average Chocolate Chip Cookie...

Wow, I havn't made chocolate chip cookies for over a year because I wasn't happy with recipes that I had. I had always liked cake-like cookies better then crunchy cookies. I used both yellow and chocolate cake mixes...Chocolate with mint chips was my fav!!!!!!! SO happy I found this recipe and I will stock up on cake mixes when they are a buck!!!!!

For such a simple recipe, these are great cookies. While these are not the very best cookies I've ever had, they are excellent tasting when you consider how easy and kid friendly this recipe is. I forgot the vanilla and didn't notice. I used another reviewer's recommendation and used Pillsbury yellow cake mix. I also followed advice to cut the chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups and it was a good ratio, but like one reviewer said, "Is there such a thing as too much chocolate?" Would like to try adding chopped walnuts next time.   I baked on 2 different sheets - a non stick and an aluminum insulated sheet. They came out much better on the non stick sheet and seemed to fall apart a bit on the other one. Perhaps this is why some reviewers have had trouble w/ this recipe?

good cake-like cookies. super soft! I made them for my MBA classes and they were a hit! I made them with German Chocolate Cake too. And for any darker cookie, just watch to be careful they do not get burnt.     Amazingly simple, easy and fast! Thanks so much for posting this!

These are the easiest, softest, best chocolate chip cookies EVER!  I used the cheap ALDI yellow cake mix and they came out perfect!!!  Will definitely be making these again.  Oh, and I only used 1 Cup of mini chips.  That was plenty!

The first batch came out dark on bottom and goopy on top. I made adjustments and the second batch came out done but completely flat. Readjusted and then they lost their bottoms...I ended up making sandwiches with them ((putting icing between two cookies)) That was the only thing that saved them. I will stick with the original cookie recipe. Thanks though...

I didn't expect to be impressed considering the ingredient list, but I liked them!  Not the best cookie ever, but certainly the easiest.  I will keep ahold of the recipe for times when my daughter (5) wants to help me out.  She could do almost everything with this one!  I could taste a little of the cake mix but overall a good cookie.  I took advice of others and only put in 1.5 cups of chocolate chips.  Seemed like the perfect amount.

This was a great chocolate chip cookie for someone who cant make a chewy chocolate chip cookie to save her life!  I didnt have butter on hand so I used shortening, and I used a hand full of mini chocolate chips.  So they would be flat, I rolled them and smushed them flat, and I also only cooked them for 10 minutes, I like them under done in the middle.  The kids loved them, and my husband said they were a great beer cookie (ew).  It was a nice easy recipie, I am going to try strawberry with chocolate chips in it.  Maybe it will be a little like a chocolate covered strawberry?  Thanks again for the recipe!

These cookies we're so Easy! My five year old had a blast helping. The cookies came out great. I used Betty Crocker Super Moist cake mix. I also used a little shortning to grease my cookie sheets and the worked perfectly. these Cookies We're gone in a flash. I also think they would be good with a banana or strawberry cake mix as well. "as a little twist"

Not the best cookies I've ever had, but definitely one of the easiest. My husband and boys ate them faster than I could make them, and that's always a good thing! Thanks for an easy, family-pleasing recipe.

These cookies are very good! I have a lot of trouble (no idea why) making cookies. My last ones were described by my son as "disgusting" but he ate these up!  I agree with other reviewers that they aren't exactly the typical chocolate chip cookie, but I will definitely make again. Nothing is this easy!

I think these cookies were very good, and my husband liked them too.  However,  if you want a classic chocolate chip cookie, this recipe is not for you.  These have a more unique, cake-like texture and flavor. But, if you're looking for something a little out of the ordinary, these cookies are perfect.

I wasn't sure how these would taste using the cake mix but they turned out awesome! I will definitely be making this recipe again!

These cookies were good, I liked the chewy texture.  Still prefer the tradional home-made cookies though!

I made this according to the recipe and they were perfect.  You must refrigerate your cookie dough for at least 30 minutes before baking.  Do not immediately use the same baking sheet for your 2nd batch.  I use two different baking sheets.  I put the first baking sheet in the refrigerator to cool down before my 3rd batch.  I have a friend that loves cookies and cakes.  He thought these were awesome.  Don't over bake or the cake will be dry.  I added minature M&Ms.

I love love love this recipe!  
Ever since I moved several years ago, my basic cookie recipes will not turn out right.  I only moved one mile from my old house, not at high altitude, no explanation other than something goofy with my oven/kitchen.  I tried absolutely everything but my chocolate chip cookies turned out WRONG every single time.  Yet premade, store-bought cookie dough baked up perfectly.

Anyway, I happened across a peanut butter cookie recipe which used yellow cake mix.  The results were beautiful so I searched for a chocolate chip recipe with cake mix as the base.

Voila'!   Beautiful , mostly-home-made cookies emerged from my oven for the first time since the move.

THANK YOU for this recipe!!!

I was skeptical but these turned out great! Used Betty Crocker Super Moist mix.  They were light and fluffy. Used two cups chips but could have definitely used less. My son said they taste just like the ones we make from the pre-made mix. I will definitely try with chocolate cake mix as others suggested.

Having read the ingredients in the past, I was skeptical. I've wanted to try these for a long time. Today I did it and I am SO glad I did. I'm not sure how some of the reviewers could have trouble with this recipe as easy and straightforward as it is. They are light, slightly crisp on the edges, and totally delicious! Clean up is a breeze, too. I'm a believer now!

So easy and turned out great! Gave them to friends who ate four at a time. Be careful not to make them too big. If they're not cooked long enough one bite and they fall a part.

Good. Nice texture; slightly crisp outside, chewy inside. Be careful to weigh your mix as now most box mixes are 15.25 not 18.25 oz. I used chocolate cake mix. Yum!  Super fast.

My 8 y/o grandson lives with us and loves to make cookies with me.  Didn't feel like making "scratch" cookies so found this recipe.  He actually made these and added a WHOLE bag of chocolate chips.  Couldn't tell if they were cake like or not,  mostly chocolate chips. They were really good.

This recipe was super easy! The cookies tasted delicious! However, I thought that 2 cups of chocolate chips was way  too much! It also was kind of cake-like (still super good though)!

I recommend using a wax sheet on whatever you decide to make the cookies on, if you do, get them off of the wax sheet while they're hot with a spatula, they will not fall apart. These are really good!

very easy, used these on Christmas; because I was being lazy and I was kind of tired so instead of making the typical Christmas cookies (AND I HAVE A LIST! GENERATION TO GENERATION) and all the trouble that goes with it! I just whipped up a couple of different type of cake mix cookies and ~bada boom bada bing~ now they're the favorite of the whole family!!! (Confusion and disbelief setting in...) unbelievable all these years of wasted time. Well was Merry Christmas TO ME ??

I was amazed at how good these are especially when it is only 5 ingredients.  Sometimes you are just so rushed but need to make cookies at times and this fits the bill! The only thing I added differently was an extra tsp of almond extract.

Holy cow! I just got done making these for the first time. I must say, I was very leery of the idea of making cookies with cake mix as the base. The outcome was absolutely delicious! I split the batch and did half with white chocolate and half with the semisweet chocolate chips. Both were absolutely incredible!

These were perfect!!! Iv tried cake mix cookies before but this recipe is my favorite!!! I used a chocolate cake mix. And put a york peppermint patty in the center! Heaven in your mouth!! Fudgy and so soft! You could never tell these cookies were made from a mix!!

These cookies were super easy to make and very good! The only problem was that they were a little dry for me, but I will certainly make them again..

Very good.  These are easy and quick to make.  The batter was a little dry so I added about 1 tbsp of milk.  These do not spread very much, the cookies came out less than 2 inches in diameter. These cookies get hard within a few hours.  They do not have that "cake mix" taste which is great.
