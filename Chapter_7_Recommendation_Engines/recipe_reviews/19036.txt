fairly simple to make, but looks fancy and elegant.  i thought the proportions for whipped cream made more than the cake couls hold, so it could be cut back some--or just top with cool whip if in a hurry.  i substitued rum for vanilla in the whipped cream for a touch more of that flavor.  i'll definately be using this one again and soon!

Rich and Yummy... And if you use the Spring Form Pan as directed it unmolds easily.

Holly, I finally found your recipe again!!  I made this a few weeks ago and it was fantastic!!  The only thing, I could not get the cake to come out even after I cut around the edges so I left it as it was since it was already in a glass dish!!  LOVED THIS!!!!!!!  Thanks.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was terrible. Was excited for this one but it was a major flop at a party. It took a while to make too but was such a waste of time. Disappointing. Pass on this one to a simpler recipe that will taste much better.

It sure would be nice to have the picture match the recipe. I'd like to know what it looks like before I make it!!
