I am of the opinion that to do anything with a lobster tail but broil it and serve it with nothing more than hot drawn butter is to insult it - until I tried this recipe. (Hubs requested something other than the usual broiled tail)  As this recipe's first reviewer, to be most helpful to others I followed the recipe as closely as possible. But there was just too much "heat" for Hubs' sensitive innards so I used only 1/3 of the hot pepper sauce (I used Tabasco) called for. It was the perfect amount for both of us. I varied the cooking instructions just a tad - first, it was difficult to mix the lime juice with the butter and hot pepper sauce but melting it slightly took care of that issue. Also, since shrimp and lobster cooks (and can overcook!) so quickly, I cooked it first, then removed it from the pan before cooking the mushrooms - it didn't need that extra 5 minutes in the pan while the mushrooms cooked with the garlic and white wine. I returned the shrimp and lobster back to the pan once the mushrooms were cooked, then stirred in the butter/lime juice mixture. Upon serving I gave it a sprinkle of color with some chopped green onion. I couldn't get enough of this!  The wine, garlic, lime juice and hot sauce contributed just "a little something" to take this dish beyond ordinary without camouflaging the sweet, tender, buttery, meaty taste of the Florida lobster tails and shrimp. An excellent dish, simply prepared with just a few quality ingredients, as most good dishes are.

We liked this recipe and I will make it again. We are trying to avoid pasta and rice currently so I served the dish as a quasi-soup. I did not include the mushrooms as I am not a mushroom fan. I did add green onion like the other reviewer to add both flavor and color. And we like heat so I added extra hot sauce which also thinned out the butter and made the sauce more broth-like. Next time I plan to use more lobster tail than shrimp as I agree with the other reviewer the shrimp overwhelmed the dish and we love lobster!!

I thought this was nice, but the shrimp kind of overwhelms the lobster.

Shrimp and lobster end up slightly over cooked when following the steps.  Next time we make it the mushrooms will be cooked before adding the shrimp and lobster.

Loved this dish! Made 12 servings for Father's Day. I added 1lb of scallops (because my husband loves them.  To  save time on the party day, I made the sauce the day before. I also  thawed the fish the day before in the fridge.  the morning of the party I shelled the lobster. The only changes was to add a fisherman's herb mixture and I  cooked  it in 2 crock pots on low for 3 hours and left it on on warm until we ate.  We served it with fruit salad,rice  pilaf and Texas toast.  This was a huge success  with Children and adults.

I excluded the lobster tails from this recipe because I do not like the taste of lobster but this dish was delicious, and fast to cook, definitely recommend!
