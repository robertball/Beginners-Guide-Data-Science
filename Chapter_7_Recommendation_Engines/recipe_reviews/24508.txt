This was really good! I used butter instead of margarine, added half a can of tomato paste, one can of cream of mushroom, one can of cream of celery, and about two cups of chicken broth mixed with both to make it thinner. about a pound and a half of fresh crawfish left over from a Sunday boil with a little extra Tonys sprinkled on top and it was fabulous!

This dish was very savory and tasteful, also very easy to make.  I loved it.  However, it is not for tender tongues.  The green chilies with the tomatoes that it calls for really add a punch and in leftovers the heat factor is somehow intensified, maybe even overpowering.  I would definitely make it again, more than likely however without the green chilies and perhaps substituting with shrimp.  Though this recipe tastes great with the crawfish processing them was a little time consuming.  Shrimp would work better if you were in a rush.

This was easy and delicious.  I did make a few changes.  I only used 1 tbls. olive oil, and 3 tbls. butter and that was plenty.  I threw in about a tsp. chopped serrano pepper with the bell pepper and onions.  I added a little chicken broth when I added the crawfish and shrimp.  Yes, I didn't have enough crawfish so I added shrimp, probably 1 1/2 or close to 2 lbs. total and I believe for all it makes you need that much.  I used 1 can cream of shrimp and 1 can cream of mushroom (2 cans is plenty).  I used 2 tbsp. fresh parsley.  Didn't need any salt or pepper added.  Served over brown rice.  My husband couldn't stop eating it.  He had at least 3 servings at one sitting!

A very tasty recipe and easy to make. I changed the recipe by adding shrimp to it also. The only downfall was it wasn't as spicy as I like but still tasted wonderful.

Excellent recipe!  I made this dish for supper tonight and was exceptionally pleased.  I was skeptical at first about the cream of mushroom soup, but it really gave the dish a good, rich flavor.  I added a diced fresh jalapeno and some cajun spice to juice it up a little, but thought the recipe itself was great if you don't like it too hot.

I have no idea how authentic this is, but I *do* know that we really really enjoyed it! The only thing I will do differently next time is to make more sauce - we had it over rice, which really soaked it up. Awesome recipe, Jason. Thanks so much!

Great recipe and very easy to make.  The second time I made this I added a bottle of clam juice and 1/2 can tomato paste, just to play around with it. Works well in this dish. Oh, and I used 1/2 cup butter, no oil.

WOW!! This was great, even with my changes. I used only 2 cans of cream soups (1 each of mushroom and celery) and since we only had a 12 oz. package of precooked crawfish tails, I added some chopped celery while sauteing the pepper, onion and garlic. (The tails were added at about halfway through the simmer since they were already cooked.) The dish seemed a little soupy to me so the next time I might drain the tomatoes, but we WILL have it again. A couple shots of Tabasco finished it off perfectly and since there are only two of us, we'll have leftovers later. Thanks so much for the recipe - Laissez les bons temps rouler!!!!

This has really good flavor, but the thickness of the mushroom soup was a little odd. I don't think etouffee is usually so gloppy. But my BF and i both enjoyed it very much. I think next time I will only use 2 cans of soup, and add some water to thin it out a little.

My hubby said this was delecious and I thought so at first too - but I wasn't so sure about it by the time I had finished. I altered the recipe slightly and adapted it for the crockpot - I used butter in with the ingredients instead of margarine and used shrimp instead of crawfish.  I also added diced chicken breasts and a can of clams.  It tasted a tad too seafoody for my tastes and next time, I will skip the clams.  I also think it needed more spices or something as it was lacking wow factor - perhaps some cajun spice next time will do the trick.  I had even tripled the garlic in this recipe and added frank's red to it - still a bit bland.  This has potential though, just needs more tweaking.

This recipe was so much fun! My husband is from south Louisiana. The home of Cajun cooking. He is by far the best Cajun cook (I'm lucky!) I have a hard time matching his recipes but with a few tweaks he said my etouffee beat his and his mom's. Here are my changes. I used 1/3 cup butter and 1/3 cup vegetable oil to saute 3 stalks celery along with the bell pepper and onion. When the veggies were soft I added 3 cloves of garlic that I ran through a garlic press. I didn't add the crawfish until the gravy was mixed, seasoned and had cooked a bit.I used 2 1/2 cans of the cream of mushroom soup, a can of Rotel, some Don's Cajun seasoning (from Scott, La), a sprinkle of McCormick Cajun seasoning and a few shakes of Emeril's essence, a bit of salt and black pepper. There was still something missing so I added a couple heaping tablespoons of tomato paste that I had in the freezer.I added the craw fish and cooked a bit longer. As a final touch I threw in a good sized handful of chopped green onion tops (for color and taste). Served over fluffy white rice. Perfection!! I only wish that we hadn't cleaned our plates before I thought of taking a picture. Next time.

This was the first time I tried a cajun dish and it was Terrific! I will do it again.  Only change I made was to add some lemon juice to cut the fishy taste of the crawfish.

I adjusted the recipe like this: 1/4 cup vegetable oil. 2 TBS minced garlic. 1 (10.75 oz) can Cream of Mushroom Soup (if not creamy enough add milk in a little at a time till desired taste). Replace salt and pepper with Tony Chacheres or Season Salt if possible. Add 1 TBS paprika and a dash of cayenne pepper and your good to go!  This is served over rice. To thicken the recipe mix 2 TBS cornstarch with a little cold water and add to recipe. Also parsley is an accent to the side of the dish after served into a bowl. -Louisiana Girl

This recipe was wonderful! I didn't use all 3 cans of soup, and doubled the crawfish; family and friends loved it !

I made as written. Easy to make and tasted great.  When I make this in the future I will reduce the amount of oil and butter.

I used butter instead of margarine (just a personal preference) I didn't have enough cream of mushroom so I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery and a little water for thinner sauce. Also added some Slap Ya Mama seasoning. This was easy and delicious.

I used Gulf shrimp, as the only crawfish out here in California comes from the Far East. It was definitely too much mushroom soup. Color was white. I had to add a can of tomato paste to pinken the color. Taste was off, too. Too liquidy; one pound of shrimp is not enough for three cans. Maybe if it used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can golden mushroom and another can of tomatoes, perhaps regular diced, it would work. Maybe.
