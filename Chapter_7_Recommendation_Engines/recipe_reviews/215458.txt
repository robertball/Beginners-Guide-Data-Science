This recipe is delicious! Best pot pie I have ever tasted! To make things a little easier I used store bought refridgerated pie crust. Will be making this often for my family!

This was very easy to make. It was my first time making the dish.  My famiy and I thought it was YUM- YUMMY!. It was even better the second day.  (Not much was left from the night before.) I followed the recipe as listed.  The only thing I would do differently is use frozen veggies. I usually don't use can veggies and would like to compare the taste. Also, I let the crust chilled for about 45 minutes.

I made this dish the day after Thanksgiving.  Instead of making the pie crust, I used pre-made pie crust (two 9 inch Pillsbury ready made pie crust).  I also added a half can of corn, frozen veggies (carrots, broccoli, cauliflower) and added some poultry season to the mix to add flavor.  My family loved it!   Made some Sweet Yellow Corn Bread Muffins (Pioneer brand) and they complimented the meal nicely.

Oh Yum! used a prepackaged pie crust instead. Sauteed onion, garlic, thyme, oregano, basil, s&p in butter and EVOO, poured in the balance of her ingredients & a can of mushroom and wahlah....perfectly seasoned and delicious!

Great recipe, thanks!  My husband and 2 boys loved it (and that's saying something these days). 
I made my  own crusts with this recipe. They were VERY light and flaky, and wonderfully thick.  My only changes to the crust recipe... substituted a couple tbsp butter when I ran out of shortening AND substituted 1 tbsp white vinegar for part of the chilled water (my grandma's trick for flaky crust).  I also baked it at 450F for the first 10-15 minutes to brown the crust. Perfect!  

The filling was tasty and very easy with frozen veggies and canned soup. Thanks for a yummy farewell to the Christmas bird!

Made this for dinner tonite and it was a big hit! Instead of making my own crusts, I used frozen Marie Callendar's deep dish pie crusts. One for the bottom and the other for the top crust. The filling was enough to make 2 pies, so I froze the extra to use for another meal. I didn't have any cream of potato soup, but I had cream of celery and used that instead. My husband, who is very picky and doesn't like casserole type dishes went crazy. He said "this is even better than Marie Callendar's" (his favorite for pot pie). We will be making this again!

Made this using leftover turkey chopped up, 1 small package of frozen mixed vegetables, 1 can of cream of chicken,1 can of cream of potato soup, 1/2 onion chopped, and 1 can of water. I sauteed the onion and turkey in 1 tablespoon of olive oil for about 2 minutes just till onions were clear. Then, I added the soups, and mixed in 1/2 can of water from each can (for a total of 1 can). I simmered the turkey mixture for about 10 minutes till it started bubbling. While that simmered, I let the 2 pie crusts from the box come to room temperature, then laid one crust in a pie baking dish. Filled it with the turkey mixture until just below the edge, and covered with the 2nd crust. Crimped the edges together, slit in the middle and baked in oven at 375 degrees for 45 minutes. Better than store bought pot pie! I will definitely make this again!

I made this recipe and used refrigerated pie crust, 1 can of carrots, and 1 can of peas. Everything else was as the recipe indicated. My daughter, 5 1/2 years old, said it was the best dinner ever and that she would give it 12 stars, not 5. She, like me, scooped up bits of the crust with the veggies and turkey and the yummy sauce. Yum. My son, 3 1/2, he poked all the things separately. We had half the pie leftover. My parents warmed it up and thought it was superb. Mom thought brandy added to the sauce or sauteed mushrooms would be great additions. I might try that next time along with reducing the amount of peas.

I wish I read the reviews first. The only thing I would change would be to buy a store crust. The effort for the crust was completely not worth it and kind of ruined the experience. The filling is divine! I will definitely make this again

Excellent way to finish off holiday turkey! I hate wasting food, but everyone had their fill of leftovers the traditional way, so I did this. If you can't do pie crust from scratch, just doing pre made will make it even easier and quicker.

My family loved it. I think it does need to cook a little longer than 40mins. because my bottom crust wasn't really done. I did add Poultry Seasoning to the recipe, just added it to taste.

12/30/18 - My first attempt at pot pie was a success!  I used store-bought pie crust, 4 cups of turkey and 1.5 bags of frozen mixed veggies, cooked up and served easily and delicious!

I can't praise this recipe enough. I'm not usually a big pot pie fan but this blew me away with how good it was. Being a guy I cheated and used store bought pie crust. This time I made it exactly as the recipe called for. Next time I'm going to try some of the spices others mentioned. I used a 9 inch pan and have a lot left over. I'm going to try making pot pie muffins tomorrow.

I doubled the soups, used a pie pyrex to bake it in and made the crust with some torn up jumbo biscuits pressed into the pie dish.  Cooked the rest as written. Came out fantastic. Wait, I made it again changing out the biscuits for pie crust.  Wow, even better than the first time. Thank you.

This turkey pot pie recipe is excellent! Grandma knows her stuff! It was easy to make. Turned out wonderfully, very creamy and the crust was the perfect variation between crispy and fluffy. The only thing I did different was I used double the cream of chicken soup instead of cream of potato. I don't like potato soups so I figures I wouldn't like the cream of potato. This is perfect comfort food for those rainy nights we've been getting.

Filling very yummy, crust a little dry and tasteless.  I spend some time mixing the crust and rolling it out, and it turned out very dry.  The contents were very tasty though.  I didn't have any onions or cream of potatoe, so I used a can of cream of onion.  I did season the sauce as recommended by others including basil, thyme, oregano, garlic salt, which really enhanced the flavor of the filling.  Would definitely make it again, but use either a store bought crust or a different recipe.

This recipe was great.  However, I did use a package of steamer frozen mixed vegetables in place of the canned mixed vegetables because the canned ones had too many potatoes in it.  My husband really enjoyed the pot pie, too.  I didn't have the cast iron skillet so I just used a large glass pie dish (10 1/2"). The pie crust turned out great as well.  It was flaky and not soggy on the bottom. Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing. I made my own crust but otherwise made it exactly to the recipe and it is wonderful. My husband and 2 year old loved it too. Great way to use up leftover turkey or chicken.
