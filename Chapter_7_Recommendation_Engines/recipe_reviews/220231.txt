This is easy to make pasta salad that has too much dressing.  I would have preferred that amount cut in half!  The dill and onion flavors compliment the salmon nicely.  Because I'm a vegetable lover, I added peas and celery to the cucumbers.  Tomatoes make a great garnish!

use greek salad dressing instead of yogurt much better tasting and leave out the mayo you won't need it with the dressing....

I'll never make this again. The taste of the yogurt is overpowering.
