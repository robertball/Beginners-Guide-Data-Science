I cut this recipe in half and used a combo of red and green bell pepper. I don't think the addition of the chopped green chilies is necessary. There is plenty in the "Rotel".  The recipe calls for the black beans to be undrained but I simple can't do that. The liquid from black beans is so dark and thick that it turns things a horrible color not to mention all of the sodium. This was super simple and one I would make again with a few minor changes.
