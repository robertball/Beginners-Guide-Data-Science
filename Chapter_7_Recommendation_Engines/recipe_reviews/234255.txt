My boyfriend just told me we're never making pork chops another way again! We were a little skeptical of the ingredients, but everything worked so well together- plus it was so easy to prepare! YUM!!!

Tasty.  The only thing that we didn't like was the layer of mayo just sort of sat there with the layer of breadcrumbs on top of it, and the honey globbed into a crispy bit of honey/breadcrumb bits, and everything sort of slid off almost every time you cut into it.  We'll be doing some experimenting with this the next time we make it.

So simple, it takes longer to heat the oven than it does to make the pork chops.  I followed this recipe exactly.  Although I never measure out the ingredients.  The sweetness of the honey was very subtle, which was good, and the panko gave it a good crunch without drying out the chops.  This is a great recipe that appears to look like it took a lot longer than it actually does.  Another plus with this recipe is that you will probably have most of, if not all of the ingredients in the pantry

Pretty good! The mayo give a different flavor (in a good way). I used a thing layer of mayo and it was well received.

I am not a good cook.   I made this recipe as stated with boneless chops, which always dry out when I cook them, and my husband, who only likes shake n bake chops agreed that these were even company worthy.  Great recipe!

OMG, I made this and changed out the mayo for Southwest Ranch sauce from Buffalo Wild Wings and plain breadcrumbs. The mildly spicy sauce mixed with the honey was TO DIE FOR!  When almost fully cooked, I put a slab of butter atop the chops. Wooooooooowwww, deeLISH!

Sweet Smothered Pork Chop Haiku: "Something just felt flawed. Maybe dip and dredge pork chop, not 'spread & sprinkle'?" Taste was good, but the mayo layer was slippery, the honey drizzle competed with the rosemary, and the panko fell away Maybe if the chops were dipped in mayo and pressed in a shallow dish of panko the whole breaded effect would've held together better..

Delicious! I just salt/pepper the chops, smear a spoonful of mayo, crush some Ritz crackers on it and drizzle honey. Bake and enjoy! Love.

This recipe has changed pork chops in our house for a life time, everybody in the house Loved them. My only change was I used garlic seasoned curtons (crushed of course) instead of the bread crumbs and it was AMAZING!!!

OK, these pork chops sound awful.


But they're NOT. Give 'em a try -- you'll be surprised.

Made as directed and yes it was tasty and moist.  As far as the other comments about the topping sliding off, just let it cool a few minutes before moving or cutting into.  It works.

I made it and it was great. So I chose not to use mayonnaise instead I used French's BBQ mustard sauce: Twangy. And I used parsley flakes instead of rosemary.

Easy,  tasty , and oh, so tender.  Hubby raved about these chops.  Based on other reviews, I reduced the mayo to 1/4 cup and stirred in 2 T ranch dressing mix.  I always brine pork (even 30 minutes helps) so I did not add extra salt when putting the dish together. My chops required about 55 minutes to cook.

Very good! I used nice thick cut pork chops and 45 minutes still seemed a little long, will try a shorter cooking time next time - because yes, there WILL be a next time.....

This recipe is a winner! It is simple, with ingredients that are normally on hand. My wife and I both agree that it the best recipe for pork chops we have had.

Very moist and slightly sweet. My 1 and 3 year olds loved it and husband paid compliments as well. Followed recipe almost exactly...I had Italian bread crumbs on hand rather than panko so I just did a couple shakes of the rosemary.

So easy and came out so tasty! I used fresh rosemary (3 branches per chop) and it the flavor was just lovely. I was pretty generous with the spread of mayo as well as my drizzles of honey. I stopped the oven 15 mins early and let them sit in the oven. Cooked perfectly. Such a hassle free meal. FYI- I lightly tenderized my chops

Made these chops tonight.  After 40 minutes the chops temped at 160.  The crust was still gummy.  Put under the broiler to crisp them.  In the taste was good.  In all honesty I think it is the altitude, 6000 ft.  I think if I make it again I would raise the temp to 375 or 400. I will try again.

Chops turned out moist and tender!  I added some dijon mustard to mayo and used parsley instead of suggested herb.
Cooked full 45 minutes for crispier top.  Delicious...wil certainly make again. Great on pork steaks too

OMG!  SO GOOD!  I did not measure but used all the same ingredients and it was delicious!  Not sure why some reviews stated the Mayo slipped off. I spreaded the mayo like on bread and it stayed on just fine. Will definitely make this again!!!

Excellent. Added granulated garlic, Caribbean spice and pepper. No salt. Did not use full cup of mayo nor breadcrumbs. Just lightly for both. This is a keeper

I have cooked using Allrecipies recipes for years and never had a flop until tonight. I cut the recipe in half as there were only the two if us and used Italian bread crumbs because that's all I had. But I thought they would make it even better. They didn't. I probably should have just left off the mayo. It was just a tasteless glob. As were the pork chops. The cooking time was way too long. I guess that's my fault for not checking them sooner. I'm taking this off my favorites.

This has been a big hit with everyone who has tried it.  I just stirred up all the ingredients except the bread crumbs, and slathered it on the chops.  I've used molasses instead of honey at times, too.  I also took some reviewers' suggestions and added hot sauce or taco seasoning.  The chops are so moist they just fall off the bone.

Made it. It is okay but not crazy about it. Sort of doubt I'd make it again. It's different. I can see where other people might like it more than I did.

We really enjoyed these pork chops.  Easy to make, moist with a hint of sweetness and no overpowering seasoning.  You could really appreciate the deliciousness of the chop.

My entire family enjoyed and raved over this dinner.  They are VERY picky pork chop eaters so nice to find a recipe they all LOVED.  I read a number of reviews and ensured that I kept the mayo layer very thin, hardly noticed it was there!

I loved this dish. I really do not like pork but it is so inexpensive I usually buy some and try new recipes with it. This one Is a keeper! I didn't have rosemary but I did have some Cajun seasoning. I sprinkled that on top of the mayo before putting on the bread crumbs. Moist and juicy pork!

Made this tonight and both my husband and I loved it!!  A nice balance of sweet and savory. The only changes I made were to use light mayo and plain 'ol bread crumbs since that is what we had in the house. Delicious!

I have made this twice now and we've enjoyed it.  The first time I followed it exactly as directed but I found it bland, thinking it was the mayo.  The second time I replaced the mayo with Ranch & bacon dressing and it was delicious!  A quick & easy meal!

Ok....so I made this for the second time tonight because the first time JUST HAD to be a fluke....NOPE! It was just as amazing as the first. I seasoned the pork chop well with "chicken seasoning" and some Garlic Mrs. Dash and also seasoned the mayo with the same, plus added some shredded cheddar/gouda....Absolutely loved it!  Will be making this again for the family.

I planned on making this just like the recipe  but then I discovered that I didn't have any bread crumbs. I ended up making it without that ingredient and was so glad.  It was wonderful. Very moist.

We loved this. I did make some changes. Just spread enough mayonnaise to give a light coating to the chops. Then instead of just using panko crumbs, I did a 50/50 mix of Ritz crackers and panko. Finally I just put the smallest amount of butter around the top of the chops. Cook for 35 minutes.
