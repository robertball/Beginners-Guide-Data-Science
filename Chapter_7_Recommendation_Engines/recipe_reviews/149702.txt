This was very good.  I used 2 large sweet potatoes and boiled them with skin for 50 minutes.  I used three medium butternut squashes and boiled them for 30 minutes with skin. Once done I peeled and placed in my food processor - which I highly recommend doing.  The squash and potatoes mixed beautifully together(no strings or seeds) I added the rest of the ingredients and poured into my pie crust.  I used the marshmallows and my kids ate it up. Again.  I suggest using a food processor/blender to mix the squash and potato - makes the process so much easier and the pie ends up looking better too. If you like pecans you can add them to the batter and/or top of the pie with the marshmallows - it's yummy too!

This is a nice recipe but I made a few adjustments to fit me. I omitted the marshmallows and added 1c. White sugar, 1c of Brown sugar and 2 sticks of butter unsalted. The recipe called for 1/2 condensed milk. I use 1 can of Eagle Brand sweetened condense milk and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. My mother made this same reciepe with those adjustments

made a double batch and froze half. Made the 2nd today and threw it in the blender. Was much better. Didnt change a thing minus omitting the marshmallows and my family loved that this healthy dessert. The sweet potatoes are all the sugar you need and I dont feel guilty letting my 18 month old eat it up. Will make again. Perfect with homemade whipped cream.

I added the whole can of condensed milk but still felt it should be sweeter. I didn't have any marshmallows; I suppose this would have helped with the sweetness!

LOVE THIS PIE!!! I have made it so many times and its always a great hit. I cook it how its written, no need to add extra sugar, butter ect. The natural flavors are just perfect as they are. I don't add the Marshmallows as I don't need the extra sweetness.

I used a cup of brown sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla. It took it to a new level.
