I agree with the other ratings.  This is a nice, healthy recipe, but it definitely has flavor components missing.  First, it needed more salt.   It is important to the flavor and texture of the slaw.  Replaced the lemon juice with lime juice for a more authetic flavor.  (Or try a combo or lemon, lime and orange juices.  Add a seeded and deveined jalepeno or two for more "zip".   Tthe missing key flavor was onion.  Add some finely chopped red or green onion.  (1/3-1/2 cup depending on how big the cabbage head is.)  It also needed a tablespoon of oil (olive or vegetable oil) to balance the slaw and give balance to the acids in the mixture.   Don't add the tomatoes until just before serving or they will be mushy.    Adding more salt, jalepeno and onion, substituting lime for lemon and adding a tablespoon of olive or vegetable oil make the difference.  All in all, it is a pretty, healthy slaw.  I'd give it three and a half stars, but there is no 3.5, so four it is.

Was very good, a healthier way to eat cabbage than the mayo based coleslaw.  Something seemed like it was missing, but it was very good.  My husband took the left overs to work for lunch.
Thanks for the recipe.  I will make this again.

I don't think there's anything missing from this recipe. I love it's simplicity because everytime I make it, I'm using it as a topping for tacos that already have tons of flavor and spice.  There's no need to pump it up with extra ingredients if you're serving it with seasoned meat.  In my opinion, it's simple fresh citrus flavor is just right to compliment any taco filling. Try it with Dee's Roast Pork For Tacos recipe and you'll understand what I'm talking about.

Agree w/ previous review: was missing something. I love a good slaw, especially w/ latin flare.  This was OK.  Next time I'll add chili spice of some kind.  Thanks for the recipe though!  Great jumping off platform.

I thoroughly enjoyed this slaw, just as it was.  It would be a fabulous topping for fish tacos!

This was a good start...made a few alterations. Added some mayo to give it a little creaminess and cut down on the strong citrus tartness. Added a bit of chopped red onion, left out the bell pepper. Also added a bit of garlic salt and chili lime seasoning.

It was good, but Iâ€™ll use fewer lemons next time. That took over the flavor profile.
