Kids loved them. I found them a bit greasy but I got to go with what the kids say.

I used a mexican 3 cheese blend of cheese and also added chives & used sourdough bread which I put in the oven to dry out a bit and worked perfect.  no oil or grease needed since the bacon fat creates the needed fat for cooking on its own.  Loved this recipe.  Served as an appetizer for mothers day lunch.
