I love the idea of adding black-eyed peas to cheese dip, but without some kind of liquid this will set up very quickly into a massive piece of gluey cheese with peas imbedded in it.  I added a can of Rotel tomatoes, and I also added some sauteed greens (kale in this case since that's what I had on hand).  It was a great end result.  I was a bit too late for New Year's, but there would have been my peas and greens in one swoop!  : )

I'm REALLY sorry I was NOT a fan.  It was gummy and starchy by contrast... I wanted to like it but just couldn't!

Made this for NYE parties and it was well received. I switched it up a little and used the southern seasoned black eyed peas and since I'm not a fan of the "cheese" from this recipe, I used a good English cheddar and cut that into small cubes and melted that into the other ingredients.  I also added minced jalapeño (I had a jar of jalapeño slices that I minced up - it was probably close to a 2 tsp.).  SUPER GOOD!

It didn't have much flavor to it. Next time I'll add my own spices.
