This was wonderful!  It tasted better than the take-out we get!  I did make a few minor changes.  I cooked my chicken in olive oil with a dash of sesame oil, added 2 celery stalks to the veggies, added 1 tsp. minced garlic, and subbed 3/4 tsp. fresh grated ginger for the ground ginger.  This is the best Chinese food recipe we have tried yet from this site.  Thanks Tricia!!

This is an excellent recipe for Cashew Chicken Lovers!  I omitted the hot sauce and added 2 Tablespoons Hoisin (which is a sweeter sauce found in a jar in the International isle or near Chinese / Asian foods of your local grocier) in its place.  I did add a small bit of sauteed garilc and onion and it was delish!  Served over white rice.

Tremendous recipe!  I cannot believe how well this turned out.  This dish is a comfort food for me and I am so enthused that I can make this successfully at home instead of trekking out and about for it.

Here are a few alterations I tried:

-Added 1 TBS peanut butter (all I had on hand was crunchy), ~1/4 c. cashews  and some freshly minced garlic to the chicken.

-Substituted 4 stalks of chopped celery for the bell pepper.

-Added more freshly minced garlic to the veggies.

-Used sesame oil.

-Substituted chili flakes for the hot pepper sauce.

-Garnished with green onions.

I chose to pair the dish with wilted green cabbage and bok choy (sesame oil, garlic, salt) and coconut jasmine rice. 

Yum yum!  Happy eating!  I impatiently wait for a hungry pocket to form in my belly so I can go back for seconds.

This was amazing! I did make a few modifications, i added 2T hoisin sauce, an extra tablespoon soy and 1T sugar to the sauce. When browning the chicken i sprinkled it with ginger and garlic powder and I also loaded it with extra veggies. I added 1c chopped zucchini, 1c chopped celery, 1c chopped green beans and instead of onions i used green onions. This turned out great, even better than take out! Great over brown rice

Very good. I added a little garlic and a dash of sesame oil. Make sure you rinse the water chestnuts before adding to get rid of the 'tinny' taste they sometimes have.

I just loved this!  So simple.  I used red bell pepper instead of green as I think it is sweeter, and was more attractive looking to me than green.  For the sauce, the only change I made was to add 1 Tablespoon of Hoisin Sauce to it and omitted the hot sauce.  Did mince some garlic into the sauce.  So good! Could have eaten the whole pan myself. Served over rice with homemade chinese fried noodles and duck sauce.  Perfect meal.

I would give this recipe a 4.5. Very delicious, and I will be making it again. I served it on top of white rice, and I also added garlic to the chicken and omitted the hot pepper sauce. Besides that, I kept everything the same. Great taste!

Very easy and delicious recipe.  I had to add more chicken broth than what the recipe called for.  I first used the 2/3 cup, which was not enough to make the sauce (it was more a paste) which then I added gradually a little more at a time to make the sauce (I used the whole can of chicken broth).  Other than that followed the directions exactly.  I will make again.

Great! Extra points for being easy! I used fresh ginger, cut back on the soy sauce, and added some red pepper flakes. Otherwise made as written, and it turned out really good. Thanks for the recipe! :)

Very good! I used 1 cup of chicken broth, but did not add the cornstarch to that. After cooking the onions, green pepper and chicken (together) in sesame oil, I added in a can of cut baby corn and the water chestnuts. I then added the sauce, which I added some minced garlic to, and allowed that to simmer a few minutes. I then thickened it to where I wanted it w/ a cornstrch/water slurry and added in the cashews. This was delicious and had a nice balance of flavors. Super simple and something that I would def make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

For the veggies I used a red bell pepper, onion, and zucchini. This was good but I found the sauce to be a bit bland.

My family loves the Cashew Chicken we get from a local Chinese restaurant, so I was hoping to recreate it with this recipe. While it wasn't exactly the same, this dish was excellent! I made a double recipe to feed my large family, but only had one pepper and one can of water chestnuts...so I used about a cup of coarsely chopped celery and some sliced mushrooms to make up for the missing veggies. I also used peanut oil instead of regular vegetable oil to give it a more "Chinese-y" flavor. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. The only problem I found was that it was just a touch too salty for me...next time I make it, I'll cut back on the soy sauce by a tablespoon or so (in the doubled recipe) Thanks for sharing...this one is a keeper!

Perfect! I LOVED the extra flavor the hot sauce added even though I thought it sounded odd at first. I will admit that I used much more than the recipe called for but only out of personal preference. This is very tasty and one I will most definitely make again. Thank you Tricia!

Good.  I added a couple vegetables to increase the healthiness and to suit our tastes.  It wasn't spectacular, but it was good.  There's certainly a chance we'll use this one again.

I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and added about 2TBS Hoisin Sauce to this as well as adding green beans, chopped celery and subbing green onions for the onion.  It was perfect and is replacing a tried and true recipe because my family decided that this recipe is much better.

I don't regularly keep water chestnuts in the house so I substituted with celery.  I made it at home and everyone loved it so much that I made it a couple days later the same way for a Chinese New Year celebration.  Yummy!

I did have to add a little more broth to get a consistancy I liked but otherwise followed recipe to the T.  It was good, I think next time I'd add more cashews but that's just a personal preference, served it over jasmine rice.  Yum!

This is really good, but I did substitute the hot sauce with sesame oil and red pepper flakes, we like spice.  I also add 2 stalks of chopped celery.  The only problem is that there's never any leftovers.

I used sesame oil and used red pepper flakes in place of the hot sauce. I added broccoli and couple tbs. of peanut butter.  Good recipe though I felt like it needed some thing to make it a bit sweeter and tangier to fit my tastes. Will make it again and tweak it a little.

I added sesame oil...I doubled the chicken and sauce and added celery, broccoli, red pepper instead of green.  Better than many restaurant cashew chickens I've ordered.

It was ok...  Easy but not terribly tasty. The 2 tbsp cornstarch was too much and even though I doubled the sauce, it was still too gooey... Luckily I didn't double the amount of starch!

Delicious. I used minced ginger and garlic instead of powdered and red pepper flakes instead of pepper sauce but otherwise followed the recipe and we really enjoyed it, will be a definite repeat recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I changed a few things simply because I didn't have all ingredients on hand (subbed hoisin for soy; garlic chili sauce for hot pepper sauce; red pep for green pep) , and added others (scallions)because I needed to use... AND WOW!   Absolutely FABULOUS!   This is my very favorite Chinese take out and have been wanting to try for years!   So glad I found this recipe!!!  Will be making this over and over again!

I used MUCH less sesame oil (maybe 2 tsp. total) and omited all the veggies to make it like the cashew chicken at my fave place, so basically just chicken, cashews and water chestnuts.  It was fabulous!

Great recipe! I made this for the first time last night and it came out excellent!  Here are the changes I made were, added a full cup of chicken broth, 4 T of soy sauce, and sauteed garlic in the oil before cooking the chicken.  I also added some baby corn to the veggies and sea salt and black pepper while cooking the chicken. Lastly, I chopped green onion and added before serving.

Huge hit! Husband loved it.  Will definitely be making this again.  The only changes I made was adding about two cups of stir fry vegetables and doubling the sauce.

Very good, per other's suggestions: Can add celery, carrots, green beans, minced garlic, fresh grated ginger, broccoli, green onions. Cook chicken in olive oil with dash of seame oil. Add hoisin sauce. Extra soy sauce. Omit hot sauce or replace with a little red pepper flakes. Add a little sugar to sauce. Pair the dish with wilted green cabbage and bok choy (sesame oil, garlic, salt) and coconut jasmine rice.

Loved this simple, basic Oriental sauce recipe.  I added a few extras to make it my own, most of which were recommended by other members.  First, I doubled the recipe and instead of the veggies she suggested, I added a bag of frozen Oriental veggies.  I substituted red pepper flakes for the hot sauce, added 2 T of peanut butter, 1/2 can pineapple tidbits plus juice, a few drops of sesame oil, and I had chicken that was already cooked.  I served it with rice, but I would have been more than happy with just the veggies, sauce, and chicken!  Way to go Tricia, this is a new staple at my home!

This recipe is pretty good.  I am not a fan of Chinese food, but the family liked it.  I did not add bell pepper and I think it needs less onion.  Good recipe!!

This is a great basic recipe! I never follow a recipe to the letter or measure much. I'm a "sniff & taste" cook. I added a couple ribs of celery, a lil' garlic and extra broth.  I always "sliver" meat paper thin to stir fry...cooks much faster and stays tender. Also used "Kikkoman Soy Sauce"...trust me...it makes a difference!! I was VERY pleased with the final dish...thank you! ;)

Excellent recipe.  Added fresh ginger and oyster sauce (2 T of soy sauce and 1 T of oyster) and fresh garlic for personal tastes.  Also added 2 stalks of celery to up the veggies.  Sprinkled green onion on top when served.  Delicious!

DH loves this recipe with baby corn, a dash of sesame oil, and more siracha next time. Served with quinoa instead of rice and DH insisted this was restaurant quality. I think it was ok, but will make again for a happy husband.

Very good recipe.  I changed slightly. Instead of using hot pepper sauce.  I added a small amount of finly chopped hot red peppers.  i also added a handfull of snow peas.  Came out great.

Very good option of ingredients, if this is your first time cooking stir fry. Overall very easy to prepare and make. You must cook in a wok. Put on low to medium heat cause the sauce will cook very fast. We've tried two times already and its very good. Enjoy!

I was so impressed with this dish!  It tastes just like good take-out cashew chicken and is so simple to make.  I used sesame oil and didn't have hot sauce on-hand.  It was still delicious but I like a little spice so will be sure to use it next time.

Loved it!! I did everything the same except omitted the green peppers (I'm not a fan of them) and instead added some chopped cabbage. My husband also loved it!! I've made a lot of stir fries before but this was by far our favorite!

This was so good I couldn't stop eating it!  Thanks so much for sharing! I modified it to what I had on hand. Didn't have water chestnuts.  I substituted slivered almonds, toasted for the cashews since I didn't have any.   4 skinless boneless chicken thighs. Doubled sauce. Omitted hot sauce. Used sweet duck sauce (from dollar store).   added 2 TBSP brown sugar Variety of veggies. Baked it in oven (lined with foil).  Pan fried the veggies then added it all together when the chicken was cooked.  Served it with noodles. Was very good! I will try it with rice next time.

This was probably the best stir-fry I've ever made. I used shredded rotisserie chicken meat and added some minced garlic. I prefer veggies like zucchini, cabbage, and broccoli. Other than that, I didn't adjust the recipe at all. I served it over jasmine rice. Great recipe!

GREAT CASHEW CHICKEN!! The only thing I changed was to use 2 TBSP Hoisen instead of hot sauce, and I used celery instead of green peppers plus added a little minced garlic, all these changes as suggested by other reviewers, and OH MY... This was better than most Chinese restaurants serve!  LOVED it!  Thanks for sharing!

Tried this recipe for dinner.  Very good. Just as good as the Chinese resturants.  I used celery instead of green peppers and I used half coconut milk and half water to cook my rice. Will definately cook this again and again.

This recipe sounded so good...I doubled it for dinner tonite.  It was so salty that I could hardly eat it!  If I ever make it again, I will use reduced sodium soy sauce and not double it.  The chicken broth was 25% less sodium already.  Even if I hadn't doubled the recipe, it still would have been salty.

Pretty simple to throw together using just one pan.  If you have a rice cooker it's even quicker.  All hail the rice cooker.

It was ok, not super, just ok.  When the sauce hit the pan it thickened immediately, so there was some split second timing going on there; hard for me as I'm a beginner.  I also thought the sauce could have benefitted from some seasoning

I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE PRETTY MUCH AS WRITTEN . I DID NOT ADD THE HOT SAUCE OR GREEN PEPPERS BECAUSE OF THE KIDS. I DID ADD 2 T HOISIN SAUCE AS SUGGESTED BY ANOTHER REVEIWER. I ALSO ADDEDMSHROOMS AND BABY CORN. THE SAUCE WAS A LITTLE PASTY SO I ADDED EXTRA BROTH. I ALSO ADDED MORE GARLIC  TO ENHANCE THE FLAVORING. TURNED OUT A LITTLE BIT SWEET WHICH WAS FINE BY ME. I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN AND MAYBE ADD ALITTLE MORE GINGER I THINK.

Easy and delicious.  I always make more than the recipe calls for so just adjust the ingredients to suit. I did also add mushrooms.

Just what I was looking for. I used to buy boxes of cashew chicken mix, until it was no longer sold. So this was so helpful and very close to what the box mix tasted like. More so without the hot sauce, so I leave it out. Also I'm not big on green peppers and water chestnuts, so I use broccoli and mushrooms. So good with rice, I make it all the time now!

I liked this dish but thought that it would benefit from something acidic like pineapple. I made a few changes, yellow and red peppers instead of green and I  used fresh ginger and garlic because I prefer the flavour of fresh. I also added a can of baby corn to bump up the veggies. I cut the corn starch back to 1 1/2 tsp because we like our sauce a little looser. If I make this again I would add more hot sauce to add a little more zing. I served this with sticky rice and garnished with green onions.

Used celery instead of green pepper since that is what I had on hand, did add red pepper but thought it was still a little bland.  There was not enough liquid when sauteing the onions, celery and water chestnuts, will make again with some changes.

Sauce was a bit bland. I think garlic and sesame oil would enhance it nicely. Added about a teaspoon of sugar to cut the saltiness.

I substituted Red bell pepper for Green, added few stalks of chopped celery and used chicken thighs instead of breast meat. Also I marinated  the sliced thighs with seasoning salt and cooking wine for an hour before cooking. Used roasted cashew nuts.  It turns out very flavorful and colorful.

I love this simple recipe, but it can be a little bland on it's own. I added Sriracha sauce and garlic powder to spice it up a bit. I also don't like crunchy cashews, so I softened them by cooking them with the other veggies.

Made this for my family last night, I always do alterations to recipes to fit my family better, but I didn't do anything crazy - just added a little bit of garlic, some sesame oil and less ginger, since we aren't crazy about it. I didn't have as much chicken as the recipe called for, and just a little less peppers, so I diced the chicken instead of cutting into strips and it worked out fine. I also had to double the sauce because my mom loved it on rice and just wanted more, but this recipe came out so delicious, and easy. Such good flavor and tasted way better than greasy take out. Will be making again, soon!!

First time making this, my family thought it was too lowkey. That might have partially to do though with the fact that I didn't add much hot sauce, just a few drops of Sriracha. We brainstormed and think that next time we need to add more soy sauce (my brother enjoyed his more when he drizzled some soy sauce on top) and a bit more Sriracha. We're also going to try using sesame seed oil instead of vegetable oil next time, as well as perhaps some red peppers too.

I took the advice of others and added hoison sauce, sesame oil and zucchini. Next time I'll chop up some celery.
this tastes amazing, the sauce thickened up beautifully in the wok. It really is legit.

Awesome. Made as directed, except sautéed some mushrooms with the other veggies. And subbed hoisen sauce for the red pepper sauce. We loved it. And the leftovers Warmed in a 325 oven were even better!

This is a very good recipe as written. As written, I rate this a 4. With my tweaks I give it 5. My changes: substitute 1 tablespoon seame oil for one tbsp of vegetable oil.  Add 1 clove of minced garlic. Marinate the chicken in the sauce for 15 minutes before cooking. Lastly, at the end of the cooking time, add 1 tbsp hoisin sauce. This is a great recipe, and I will make it again both ways! My family loves it. One last thing: I used about half of the cornstarch. Way too thick with 2 tablespoons. Also, for an interesting variation, try adding a can of pineapple chunks toward the end of the cooking!

I substituted 1 cup zucchini and 1 cup celery for the chestnuts. I also subbed olive oil for vegetable oil and added one chopped clove of garlic. Maybe add more hot sauce next time.

This was OK for me. I used some water chestnuts from France and that may have wrecked the texture, not sure. If I try it again and like it more I'll update.

Weeeell...I feel that this recipe has potential, I made it as is and it was very, very bland. I am going to try it again and add some more spices to the sauce.

This was so-o-o good!  I did not have water chestnuts so I substituted celery but otherwise made it by the recipe using sriracha chili sauce for the hot sauce.  I served it over organic quinoa and brown rice with garlic and we enjoyed every bite!  Quick and easy and delicious!

This was ok. In my opinion it needed generous amounts of garlic and celery, which I added. Only four stars for blandness as written, but superb with the additions.

This was a tad bland .   I should have followed some of the suggestions of others and added a little more flavoring, but I made it as the directions stated.   I gave it four stars because, although bland, it was good  - and so EASY.  I loved that part.   I will add more flavors, like sesame oil, garlic and more veggies next time to give it more color and texture.

I found there was too much corn starch - so had to whisk more chicken broth in - would try 1/2 the amount when I make it again.  Served it to 8 women so doubled the recipe - everyone enjoyed it but  had LOTS of leftover

I made it tonight.  We loved it!  The only changes I made was to cut the oil down to 1 tablespoon and I added 2 whole cloves of garlic.  I will definitely make this again.  Next time I will add a slight bit  more of hot sauce.

Really liked this sauce recipe. I added a bit of sugar to it and red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce. I used carrots, onion and sugar snap peas for the veggies. I will definitely make this again!

My family loved it. I had to make two changes because I am too lazy to go to the store. I used red pepper and avocado oil; in place of green pepper and vegetable oil. Next time I make it, it will sautee the chicken in some garlic.

I automatically replaced the ground ginger with finely minced ginger root (approx. a Tbsp.), and stir fried that with the chicken.  I replaced the green pepper with red pepper (much tastier).  I found that there wasn't enough sauce, and it was too thick, so next time I would use more chicken broth (maybe about a cup, or slightly more).  Don't be afraid to add the hot sauce - it doesn't turn out that hot.  Next time I might stir in the cashews at the end, rather than sprinkling them on.  I'm also going to try adding a dash of sesame oil, as per other reviewers, and some minced garlic and celery to the recipe.  Tweaking a little never hurts!  Definitely a good recipe!

Before trying the recipe as written, I decided to go with the suggestions of others. I added two cloves of garlic, 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and 2 tablespoons of hoisin sauce. I also added one can of bamboo shoots because I love them. I salt and peppered the chicken before cooking. I think this is a wonderful dish. The next time I make it I will omit the hoisin sauce.  It's not my favorite, but it didn't ruin the dish.  I know my son will love it. Thank you for the recipe submission.

Made it for the first time.  It was an instant hit.  My family is very picky but raved about this.  Used olive oil to cook chicken and peppers. Made enough to have for lunch the next day and it was even better.

I made the recipe as written and added fresh green beans and carrots. It was bland and there really wasn't alot of flavor. Maybe if I marinate the chicken next time it will be better.

This is a great recipe. It is quick to make and only has a few ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious, I will add salt next time as there was not quite enough from the soy sauce for me.

This was great! I used 2 teaspoons of hoisin sauce instead of hot sauce and added broccoli,mushrooms and celery. I also doubled the sauce and toasted the cashews as I was cooking the vege's. :) I cooked the chicken in 1/4 cup of chicken broth,sesame seeds and a tish of soy sauce. I've made this 3 or 4 times, this time I marinated the chicken in the soy mixture then cooked the chicken in the oil and toasted the cashews toward the end. Removed the chicken and cashews and stir fried the veges.When slightly cooked I added corn starch to the remaining marinade, added that to the veges and steamed for a few minutes while veges finished cooking. I decided, on a whim to add  a teaspoon of honey  and OMG! so good!

Would not make again.Everybody made changes by adding ingredients which I also did. Rather bland flavor.  Not worth the effort nor cost of ingredients. Needs major changes and additions to give this any flavor at all.

This recipe is fabulous.   The only change I made was to add 2 T. of Hoisin Sauce and 1 t. of garlic.  I omitted the hot sauce.  Next time I would add bean sprouts, only because we like them.   It is a keeper.

This was great!! I added celery, just because that's how my favorite local Chinese restaurant makes it. Probably don't need both celery & water chestnuts but whatever--it was really good. The sauce was perfect. Loved the hint of heat from the hot pepper sauce and it thickened up beautifully. I often find stir fry sauces don't but this one was perfect. I will definitely make again.

I'm making this tonight, I added a little siracha to it and peanut sauce as I did not have cashews on hand. I have added sliced zucchini and celery to pack more veggies in. We are pretty excited about it, I am confidant it will turn out fabulous!  We do alot of stir fry in our house !

I added garlic to the chicken as well and did red peppers for color along with broccoli.  I also used scallions (green onions) instead of yellow.  The recipe is easy and the sauce very good.  The whole family at it without complaint!  I would definitely make it again.

This will be a regular on the dinner rotation for my family.  We all loved it!  I did make a couple changes....I added 2 TBSP of hoisen sauce as recommended by other reviewers, and used sesame oil in place of the vegetable oil.  Delicious!

Big hit with family.  Didn't have bell pepper or water chestnuts, so used asparagus and carrots.  Used tamarin instead of soy sauce to make it gluten free.  Used siriacha sauce for the hot sauce.  Was delicious and came together quickly.  Nice thick sauce, with crisp veggies. The sauce wasn't spicy at all.  I think the 1/2 t of hot sauce is just to give depth to the recipe.   Big winner at our house.

Cook chicken with ginger, garlic, red pepper flake.  Leave out the onions, do large sliced bell pepper and sugar snap peas. Double the hot sauce. And I think it needs a tsp of honey.

I decided to make this recipe after eating an amazing cashew chicken dish at a Halifax restaurant. This recipe was good, but not as close to what I had in mind as I'd hoped. Like the restaurant I went to, I quartered two whole oranges rather than using water chestnuts; other then this change, I prepared the recipe as directed. The mixture of foods was good, but I found the sauce more bland than I'd hoped for. I will try something similar again, but will research more into possible sauce ingredients first, and will plan to make more sauce.

This is a absolute favourite if mine! I loved it when I ate meat, and I still love it as a vegetarian. I sub chicken for tempeh, use whatever veggies need to be used up (broccoli is great in this!) and serve over quinoa. The sauce makes this! Still in the weekly rotation :)

We made this according to the recipe just substituting carrots and buk choy for the capsicum. The sauce had hardly any flavour. We will be sticking with our healthier, more flavoursome chicken and cashew stir- fry recipe in the future.

FANTASTIC!!!!! We added celery to the stir fry (preciously blanched) and used a little sesame oil in place of veg. oil, sauteed minced garlic in with the chicken, and garnished with green onions. It tasted BETTER than take out!!

Very good,  my husband and daughter loved it.  Will make again.  I did add shredded carrots and baby corn to the veggies as well as fresh garlic (the more the better).  Also stirred in some hoison sauce at the end.  The sauce seemed a little thick so I added some water to thin it out as it boiled.  Served over jamine rice.

Very good.  Added 2 Tbsp Hoisin sauce and forgot the hot pepper sauce.  Will definitely add the hot sauce next time because it could have used a little heat.  Also used fresh ginger, scallions, julienned carrots, green beans and little corns instead of the onion, green pepper and water chestnuts.

Very good recipe, wish I had added Hoisin or something for more of a kick, but my market didn't have any. I added some Teriyaki sauce, about 2 tbls for some sweetness, and a little extra hot sauce. Also added some crispy noodles on top for extra texture.

This tasted just like all my favorite take outs. Followed the directions minus the water chestnuts (our store doesn't carry them) and instead added snap peas. My husband and I loved the sauce but thought there wasn't enough of it, so next time we make it we will make a little more of it. I will definietly be making this again.

This was pretty good. I used low sodium chicken broth and soy sauce, but still found it a little salty so I added a touch of honey to counteract it. I also added some broccoli which went with the dish really well. I served it over brown rice.

It tasted great and I had added mini carrots to it along with bamboo shoots and the mini corns.  I wanted more of a zing to it and added in 1/4 cup Hoisin Sauce when I added the bamboo shoots, mini corns, and chestnuts.  The family loved it!

Very easy, good taste.  I will make again.  I did not like the gelatinous texture...next time I will try using 1 T. cornstarch or omit altogether so that I will have a sauce to use over the rice.  Fresh ginger really helped give flavor to what otherwise would have just been salty stir fry.

eh.  it tastes alright, but the sauce is too thin and not evenly distributed.  i substituted cashews with walnuts, and used red pepper.

May family loved this recipe and it was so easy.  I did substitute the Hot sauce with Hoisen sauce.  Next time I will cut up the chicken strips into bite size pieces - easier with chop sticks.

This was pretty good in terms of the flavour of the sauce, but the water chestnuts did not seem to meld with the dish as well as I had hoped. I mightr try this recipe again but leave out the water chestnuts.

This dish was absolutely delicious! I used fresh ginger, sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, and since I had some vegetables in the fridge that had to be used I added some brocoli, thin sliced carrots and red bell pepper. I rinsed the cashews to cut on the sodium and used reduced sodium soy and chicken broth. Thanks Tricia!!!

Thank you for this recipe!!  I have been making a similar version of this dish for a long time but I don't make it often because there always seemed like so much guess work with the sauce and I could never get it to come out the same way twice.  This completely cleared up the mystery for me.  The meal came together quickly and perfectly in the time that it took the rice to cook.  I followed the recipe almost exactly with the exception of tossing in thinly sliced carrots for added color and veggie goodness.  I also added some garlic toward the end of cooking the veggies.  The hubs and I LOVED this meal and I forbade him to eat the rest of the can of cashews so that I could make it again soon.

Excellent! Easy!  My picky husband and 2 yr old ate this.  Its hard to find dinners that please them all.  Changes (due to what was on hand) I used canned Kirkland chicken from Costco and a yellow bell pepper and celery.  Served it on rice.  Was even excellent for leftovers.

I added a small carrot but followed the recipe other than that and it was great.  The ginger was just the right amount and I used Sriacha hot sauce that was the perfect amount.  The cornstarch helps the sauce get thick and coats the veggies and chicken.  The prep takes longer than the cooking.  Oh, don't forget to cook the rice beforehand.

Great! just as others said, its as good and better than most Chinese restaurants.  I used tempeh instead of chicken, too much soy sauce though, and could go more spicy.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!  I made a couple changes though to satisfy the husband.....I added broccoli and bamboo shoots and omitted the onion and green pepper.  I also cooked the chicken with garlic.  YUMMOH!!  I highly recommend this recipe!  Thank you Tricia for sharing!
