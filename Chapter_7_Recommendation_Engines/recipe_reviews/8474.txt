My mom made this cake for over 50 years.... The only thing she did different is... When putting on the orange syrup at the end.. she would take a long wooden skewer and as she poured  the syrup on she would poke holes for the syrup to drain down into.... Everyone loved this cake and in her heyday she was making 20 of these cakes for friends. She had 5 kids and we all had duties to help.. But we LOVED helping.. It was a Christmas Tradition..On we all LOVED.... My job was to zest the oranges then  squeeze them into juice.... I notice this recipe doesn't use orange zest hmmmm

I have been cooking for at least 45 years so I a'm definitely not a novice at this.  This sounded like a wonderful recipe, but it fell apart.  I think there may be to much liquid in it and way too much orange topping.  It was a great disapointment, as It was fairly expensice to make and I had planned to use it a Christmas gift.

this is a really good recipe with the exeption of the orange syrup.  leave off the orange stuff and eat it the same night that you cook it.

This is a great recipe.  I use only about half of the orange/sugar mixture.  It's a favorite of my husband and son-in-laws.

My mom made this for my dad for years. But the OJ was actually a large can of frozen concentrate thawed and used over the hot cake not orange juice, it does have a more concentrated consistancy. It soaks in to the cake and one never fell apart. But you have to put it on when the cake is hot and let it soak in. This was a holiday tradition for as long as i could remember.

Oh, Mom made it with lemon juice in the milk (or buttermilk) no extract. Instead of pecans she used black walnuts. Everyone always asked her for the recipe!
