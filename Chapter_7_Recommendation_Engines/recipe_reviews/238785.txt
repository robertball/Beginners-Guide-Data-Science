Very hearty - good for those "no meat Mondays." I was a little concerned about not boiling the gnocchi first but just browning it in the sauté pan - this does not cook it completely, but it cooks through and becomes tender when you add it back to the pan at the end of the process. Used broth instead of water, added a splash of red wine vinegar at the end for a little acidity (always use vinegar when I'm making chard, spinach or kale) and added capers and olives just to have a bit more interest to the dish. I used the Italian cheeses but I think goat or feta would have been good too - making it more greek than italian. Very tasty, very flexible.

With modifications, this is definitely a 5 star recipe!  It didn't make sense to me to only saute the onions for 2 minutes and then add water; I salted them & cooked them way longer to give a little more depth of flavor, and sauteed the garlic for about 30 seconds before adding the liquid (I used broth instead of water).  I also added red pepper flake for a little extra kick.

I LOVE this approach to cooking gnocchi; the browning really takes the flavor and texture up several notches.  Great, healthy, flavorful dish - I'll be making again and again!

As another reviewer mentioned, I sauteed the onions until translucent - rather then steaming them until tender.  Then added the garlic, and then added the water.  I followed the recipe on cooking the gnocchi (saute then simmer) and it turned out well.  I loved that there was lots of greens - the gnocchi is not a star in this dish, but a player in a well-balanced quartet.  
Very easy and tasty and flexible; I will make this one again.

Will make again! Added Italian sausage this time, plan to try sliced sausage link next time... can't do the vegetarian thing. Used green Swiss chard as I find it has a less earthy taste than kale or spinach. I also used a bit of chicken bullion granules with the water but it added too much salt so I will try a low sodium broth and a little red pepper flakes next time for a little extra something. Great weeknight recipe since it was really quick even with the extra cooking time for the ground sausage but using a precooked link would cut down the time and extra dishes. Thanks for a great intro gnocchi recipe!

This recipe is easy and exceptionally delicious. Even with my lack of experience cooking gnocchi I was able to cook this and presented like I have been doing it for years. I would highly recommend cooking and serving immediately because I believe the spinach freshly wilted would be best. However, when I heated this up the next day, I realized it was just as delicious. I added a low-fat hot turkey sausage that I crumbled and it was so complementary to the flavors of the dish. Highly recommended. Thank you so much for the recipe!

I am a carnivore and I LOVE this recipe. So filling and flavorful - and healthy!  I use bagged spinach.  Also - this is the first recipe my son (16) ever "cooked". It's that easy!   :)

I followed the recipe with the exception of omitting the tomatoes, because my husband is not a fan.  This pasta was so good!  We all loved it and will definitely make again.

Very good and very easy.  I used red chard and other than omitting the beans (since I didn't have any on hand) made exactly to recipe.  The salt in the cheese was enough- nothing else needed.  Will definitely make this again!

Excellent!  Pretty much followed the recipe except that I added a splash of white wine vinegar and fresh basil from the garden. Will definitely be making this again soon!

Very good.  Although I made a few changes.  I added some italian sausage so it was no longer a veggie dish.I just removed the casings and cut the sausage into small pieces and put them in the pan with the onions.  But I'm sure it would still be great without it.  i just had to use up what I had in the fridge.  I also only had a can of crushed tomatoes not diced.  So since I had lots of tomatoes from my garden I chopped some of them up and threw them in.  As well as halved cherry tomatoes.  Everything else remained the same. I would make this again.

Made as written but used Vegan Mozzarella and Nutritional Yeast (Parmigiana substitute) since my husband is Vegan.
Very yummy! Will definitely make this again and may try adding some Sun Dried Tomato’s next time.

Quick to put together. Added some Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper for flavor.  Still a bit bland. But colorful and loaded with nutrition and potential.

I used this as a guideline and added my own ingredients since I cannot eat tomatoes, onions or garlic right now. I boiled my gnocchi, baked and chopped some chicken breast, then stir fried chard and mushrooms with canellini beans, then combined them with the gnocchi. I used Prego alfredo sauce over the top. Everyone loved it and would like me to make it again. It was pretty simple to do too.

This was yummy! Loved the browned gnocchi! I did cook the onions longer and then added the garlic for the last couple of minutes before adding the veg broth ( instead of water). I added the tomato and beans then a mixture of gouda and parm. I did take a suggestion and added olives and capers just because we love them....but I think it would be just as good either way.  Tossed in a bag of baby spinach ( I just can't bring myself to like kale) turned off the heat and mixed it till nicely wilted. Thank you!!

WOW. Delish!
I used  the  ingredients listed only increased the cooking time of the onion and garlic and used s spinach instead of chard. I used what I had on hand. 

The textures work well together and it looks appetizing with the different colors from all the ingredients

Very very good!  You can use this recipe as a base and tweak it by using diced potatoes instead of gnochi or add rice or quinoa. My  kids enjoyed sprinkling their own cheese on top at the end.

Very easy recipe that was a hit with the whole family. Hearty enough that you don’t even notice it’s vegetarian. I substituted chopped spinach for the chard and added extra cheese on top.

I made this with pancetta from Aldi and it was awesome! I sautéed the onions and garlic longer than recipe called for and I used baby spinach. Very easy recipe and will definitely make again.

I made this dish last night.  I thought that it was fabulous.  The only thing that I did differently, was bake it in the oven for 20 min. at 400 degrees.  The reason being, that I already had roasted cauliflower in the oven at 400 degrees.  Otherwise, I would have baked it for maybe 30 to 40 minutes at 350.  I plan on making this again.

This was easy and so delicious. I tweaked it my third time making it, added some fresh basil. A wonderful one pan dish for camping trips.

Super simple and easy.  Made exactly as written except omitted onions and was flavorful and quite good. Can def be a great base too for adding mushrooms and sausage and other ingredients as you please. One pan meals are the best and this one is a keeper.

Nice taste and filling. I added some turkey meatballs for some added protein but think it would be good with sausage or chicken too. Used broth instead of water.

This was an instant family favorite because it's quick, healthy, and delicious. The browned gnocchi is so good I have a hard time not eating it all before the rest is finished.

Made this tonight. We both really liked it-particularly with the addition of SJRJA'S suggestions. Also added a little basil, oregano and anchovy paste. Used the goat cheese crumbles and it was nice and creamy. Will make again.

This was hearty and surprisingly filling for a meatless dish. 4 stars as is. Next time I will follow others' suggestions and use broth and some vinegar for a little extra flavor. I did  include the chard stems -- chopped them up and sautéed them with the onions so as not to waste them. Very tasty!

Made this once a few months ago and has since become mine and my boyfriend's favorite gnocchi recipe. it's extremely flavorful and has room for some tweaks. sometimes we used crushed tomato and it comes out amazing.

I followed others suggestions. I used broth instead of water, added some black olives and capers, gave it a splash of white wine and substituted a mixture of kale, collard, mustard & turnip greens. It was fantastic!

Loved it!  I doubled the batch and thought if any family member were to walk by and see how much chard and spinach  is going into the pot they would never eat it!!  Well it all cooks down and they will never know :)  We are all meat lovers, so I added ground sausage to the meal, a little Italian seasoning, and some extra cheese on top.  It was a hit, and the fam voted it was a keeper!

I cooked the gnocchi for longer than specified.  After 7 mins, I tried one, and it didn't seem cooked enough, so I sauteed them in the pan while I cooked the other ingredients in a pot until they were nice and golden. This seemed to cook them through. I also cooked my onions longer because I always cook them until they start to turn translucent. I couldn't find chard at my local grocery, but a pack of chard, spinach, kale, and shredded carrots. I think that turned out well. I think there's room here to play with the seasonings. I will probably make this again.

I enjoyed this meal and so till my 14 month old. I used feta for the cheese and frozen spinach instead of chard. I let it simmer for a little while long. It turned out a bit soggy but very filling.

Loved this recipe, but tweaked it just a bit.  I  added celery with the onions, used chicken stock in place of water, and also added cooked shredded chicken, paprika, and chili powder. I topped it with mozzarella  and crumbled goat cheese and it melted in to give it a great flavor. Yum!!
