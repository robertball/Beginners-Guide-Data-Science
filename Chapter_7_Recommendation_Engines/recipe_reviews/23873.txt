The main problem with this recipe is it doesn't tell you what to do with the broccoli!  You cook it at the beginning, then it's never mentioned again in the directions.  So I had to improvise.  I used about 4 cups frozen broccoli florets and cooked them in the microwave.  I then put about half in the food processor and minced them.  I then dumped all the broccoli (florets and minced) in the pot at the end right before adding the cheese.  Who knows if this is what the recipe writer intended, but my husband and I enjoyed it!  It would probably also be good if you just pureed all the stuff together, though I liked the full florets.  The only change I would make is to omit the celery.  It doesn't add anything, and its flavor sticks out too much among all the other mellow blended flavors of the soup.

This is very rich but tasty all the same. I didn't have bouillon so I cooked the broccoli in about 2.5 cups chicken broth and saved the liquid like suggested. I don't think heavy cream is necessary in this recipe. I used 2 cups whole milk and it was plenty rich. I might try reduced fat milk next time and see if I like it more. I just chopped up the cooked broccoli once it was cooled and added it after the cheese and liked the consistency. Also, if you don't have shredded mozzarella already, save time by cubing it instead of shredding, it melts pretty quickly in the pot.

I was looking for a cream of broccoli recipe that doesn't use a canned soup mix. This was a great and easy to make soup. I reduced the amount of heavy cream to 1/4 cup, but it still tasted rich and creamy. I added some carrots too.

Ok, I'm a tinkerer. I tripled the recipe and to this end I used 2 large (48oz)cans of chicken broth in place of some of the water and bulion cubes and then added another 48oz of water to boil the brocolli in. I also used four stalks of celery and 2 medium onions diced. My chef friend told me to add thyme and also pepper. For thickening I used 12T flour mixed with 12T melted butter before adding to the broth. Yummm.

I was really pleased with how this turned out.  I chopped and simmered the broccoli in chicken stock, and after sauteing a red onion in butter and mixing in the flour, milk, and cream, I just dumped the whole boiling mess of broccoli and stock into the soup pot.  I used a swiss/cheddar mixture because that's what I happened to have.  Omitting the celery was a mistake - it would have subtly improved the flavor.

This soup was delicious!  I used frozen broccoli florets which made it a lot quicker to make.  I used 2 cups of heavy cream because I didn't have any milk.  Next time I will use a little bit more flour for thickening.  This came out great and everyone liked it.

This soup ROCKS!!  I am not a fan Broccoli, but do like Broccoli Cheese Soup and this recipe is the Best!  I had to use powdered milk instead of milk/cream that this recipe called for, but the taste was marvelous.  I used a pressure cooker to soften the broccoli and continued as the directions indicated.  I think I will double the recipe next time so I have some to put in the freezer.

Great soup!
Even my 3 & 4 year old children ate it & I assure you they haven't eaten broccoli since baby food days!
I added Thyme & omitted the celery.
I will use sharp white cheddar next time, I think it needed a little "bite" to it.

This is a good recipe, But with all recipes that call for cheeses always start with hard cheese and grate it yourself. Buying grated/shredded cheese make for a gritty sauce.

Excellent! My new favorite soup! The only changes I made was to use what I had on hand:  chicken stock to cook the broccoli then added to soup, 2 cups half & half instead of milk and cream, and aged cheddar cheese in place of the mozzarella. I also thickened mine a bit with cornstarch. I used another reviewers suggestion and used my potato masher to mash the broccoli instead of getting out the blender. :)

Yum!  I chopped up and added the broccoli when I added the reserved water. I used vegetable soup base instead of boullion.  Otherwise, I did not alter recipe.

Nice tasting, quick and easy soup.  The only changes were to use a bag of frozen broccoli in place of the fresh, powdered chicken bouillon instead of cubes, and  2C half/half in place of the milk/cream mixture.  I made these changes to accomodate the ingredients I had on hand.  Thank you, my 6yr old son and husband loved it.
UPDATE: I've made this soup many more times.  I still use the bag of frozen broccoli, but I've found there is no need to transfer to a blender to puree.  I take my potato masher and mash away.  The soup has the perfect smooth/chunky consistency.

Generally tasty and pretty simple. Next time I will use a different cheese from mozzarella or a combination of mozzarella and another - probably cheddar.

Excellent. I will add more flour next time. It didn't take as long to cook. I only cooked the onions and celery for about 3.5 minutes. I was out of chicken bouillon and pleased I had beef bouillon - still tasted wonderful, I added the cooked broccoli after I added the seasoning and cooked for about 15 more minutes. I will make this again in the near future but will add another tablespoon of flour. Thanks for sharing!

This was very Yummy!! I added a little twist on my soup.I preassure cooked my fresh broccoli for about 15 mins and sauteed shallots (instead of onions) and celery in unsalted butter and added 2Tblsp of white wine I even used a 1+1/2 cup of the broccoli stock and a 1/2 cup of chicken broth with a pinch of nutmeg, I also cut back on the chicken Boullion intead of 2 cubes I only used 1 cube to make it even less salty I left out on the salt all together. This was delish.To avoid the flour from lumping, mix it with the cold milk then dump it in the soup as needed.

Excellent recipe, simple yet with great taste. I did change from 2 bouillon to only 1 since I did it twice and did not taste as salty as the first( not that it was not good also ) and also used Gouda instead of  Mozzarella since it more pungent and only used 1/2 a cup. But its a matter of taste, end result is this recipe is very good.

This was great! Instead of boiling the broccoli, I steamed it in my microwave steamer, adding the two cups of water into the base of the steamer and then using that broccoli water for the recipe. much faster.. 3 mins instead of 10! I also used cheddar instead of mozzarella and it turned out fine.

Great Soup! Very easy and quick to make. It was a big hit at my house. I did blend the broccoli in a food processr, since the recipe doesn't say what to do with the broccoli!

Great soup but after doing it for the second time i changed it as it was too watery i added twice the Broccoli no salt and half of the recommended chicken bouillon. I don't like it too salty. :-)

I loved it! I followed the recipe exact and it was a little thinner than I wanted so I melted 3 tbsp of butter and added 3 tbsp of flour to make a rue in a separate pan. Then I added it to the soup and it made it the perfect consistency. Everyone who tried it, loved it!

Wow!  What a great soup for a cool day's lunch or dinner.  So delicious.  I read the reviews and I did substitute equal parts Greek Yogurt and Sour Cream in place of the Heavy Cream.  I placed the Broccoli in the blender with about a cup of the retained broth and blended half of the Broccoli, then I added it all in before the cheese. Also, as another reader suggested, I added Thyme and Pepper as once I tasted it something was missing - and these were perfect additions, just made the soup one notch above!  I think this is wonderfully creamy and flavorful, but I do not think that I would prefer cheddar over the mozzarella for this recipe.  Add a few croutons on top and serve!  Yum!

Great flavor with the worcestershire sauce, mozzarella, and bouillon.  My husband doesn't like meals without meat, so added ground beef and used beef bouillon instead of chicken.

This was a perfectly simple recipe. I rarely just "go with it", but this time I didn't change a single thing. I can't imagine doing so would have helped. I reserve 5 stars for truly spectacular experiences, which I can't say this was, but it is a definite keeper.

Wowie!!!  Delish and easy!  I pureed everything  (minus a hand full of florets) in a blender before adding cheese. Yummy and made a whole pot for under $5!!!

I cooked adding just slightly more than the recipe called for.  I minced three broccoli heads.  I added a whole can of chicken broth, about 1 1/2 cups, instead of chicken bouillon. I still put the 2 cups of broccoli water as well.  I used a whole cube of butter, plus added some olive oil to the celery and onions.  I used three tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and 4 pinches of paprika. I added 4 tablespoons of flour.  Very tasty...

This was about what I expected from a Cream of Broccoli soup.  it was good and easy to make.  I also used a bag of frozen broccoli and my choice of cheese was Parmesan.  Other than that it was good, I'll probably make it again should I ever get a craving for Cream of Broccoli soup.  Sure beats the canned stuff.

Good but not the best..I liked it but not enough to make it again. I don't think mozzarella cheese is quite right for my idea of cream of broccoli soup but it might be for other people.

I was looking for a soup that didn't use any "cream of" soups in it and came across this.  I added a carrot in with the onion and celery just to get a little more veggie vitamins mixed in.  I added half the broccoli to the soup at the end when it was simmering all together.  I then put the soup in the food processor to smooth it out as I didn't want celery, onion or carrot chunks in it.  I then took the other half of the broccoli and coarsely chopped it and added it to the pureed soup.  It was excellent.  My 1 1/2 year old loves broccoli so I figured this would be a big hit and it was!  I like that it doesn't have an overwhelming amount of cheese and that it didn't use processed cheese either!  ETA: I never use heavy cream, I used 2 1/2 c. milk and 1 1/2 c. half and half.  I also use half butter/half olive oil.

This soup was so easy to make & very filling!  I used 1/2 cup of cottage cheese (pureed) in place of the heavy cream for a lighter base.  I used cheddar and mozza and added finely chopped zuchini and thin sliced ham.  Since my broccoli was already steamed, it took about 20 minutes to prepare the soup before I served it for lunch!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I made a few changes however to make it more enjoyable to my household.  I used 2 large carrots(grated) instead of the celery and cooked them in with the onion.  I also substituted the heavy cream for milk to  make the soup a bit lighter. You will need to add more flour to the recipe if you opt for using milk instead of cream if you still want the thickness.  Once the broccoli, onion and carrot were cooked I put it all in my blender with the milk and pureed it, before putting it all back into the pot and then adding the stock and cheese.  I also used old cheddar instead of mozza

I didn't have the exact ingredients, so improvised.  Thinking of nutritious values, instead of water to cook the broccoli, I used chicken stock and used velveeta for the cheese.  When using the vvelveeta, I'll cut down on the salt, as we have high blood pressure in our household.  So very easy to put together and so so good!  Will make again.

I love that this soup isn't your usual thick, clumpy cheddar cheese version.  I usually make a double batch and put some in the freezer, and I've used the "base" recipe to make cream of chicken soup also.

This was the first time I've made a cream based soup, although I've been making broth soups for years. I doubled the recipe in order to feed six adults, and everyone loved the soup!
I made a couple of changes; I had some fresh asparagus that needed to be cooked like now, and I chopped it up along with the broccoli and boiled it.  I also grated some fresh parmesan cheese and added it at the very end. Thank you for this recipe. I will be making this again.

I usually make a recipe as stated but I admit this time I did not. The Worcestershire sauce didn't sound like it would be good and I also omitted the paprika. That said, with those omissions, the soup was absolutely delicious. I had three small heads of broccoli so it was pretty thick but that's the way I like it. Just wish I had a loaf of crusty bread to go with it! I am going to use this same base and make cream of cauliflower and also cream of mushroom. Very, very tasty; also very easy to make. I highly recommend.

Tried this today and very good! Was concerned about the cheese, mozzarella, so I added some sharp cheddar...also used whole milk and left out heavy cream.  Did not use any worcestershire...not a fan of it. To me it makes foods especially meats taste like liver. JULY

Quite bland - Not much flavor.  Maybe because I used left over broccoli stalks instead of the florets.  The recipe is incomplete as it does not tell you what to do with the broccoli.  After mixing all the liquids I poured a little at a time into a blender adding the cooked broccoli a few pieces at a time to puree the soup. BTW: I always use evaporated milk in place of the cream and used boxed chicken stock instead of bouillon cubes.

i  was happy of the way it tasted it! I used I  fat free  half and  a half  instead of heavy cream  and I cooked the broccoli on chicken broth so I did skipped the step on diluting the bouillon on the brocoli water. i used also  2 tbs of butter instead of three and it came out pretty good!

This was really good! Very chunky- I think next time I may put half of it in the blender to make a creamier soup.  I would also add some garlic cloves, but that's just a personal taste :)

I thought this soup was real easy and good. It took no time to make and the whole family loved it. The only issue I had was mixing the milk into the butter and flour mixture. It got clumpy but I was able to smooth it out.

Really yummy. I used sharp cheddar because that is what I had. I'm not sure if a more mild cheese would have tasted as good. I also used black pepper. It seemed to add a little zip. It didn't feel like it took that long to make. I also used a bag of frozen broccoli and ran it all through the blender so there were no big chunks. WAY better than store bought soup. Will make this again. Thanks!

A fast soup with a lot of flavor.  I made a slight modification by adding a bit of marjoram and oregano.  Very tasty.

This is a first for me, I have never had any problems with any recipes in this site. I doubled the recipe and it turned out horribly salty, to the point that we ended up eating something else. Maybe I missed something since everyone rates it so high.  The amount of salt is too much.

I tried this soup and tastes really nice, but i also made some changes. I added a little nutmeg (didn't have paprika or Worcestershire) and also one clove of garlic, minced. And as someone said this recipe doesn't say what to do with the broccoli, but i choped it a little and added it to the soup. Also, i think mozzarella it's not the best choice of cheese for this soup, it didn't melt completely. But my daughter loved it anyway! :)

Wonderful soup! Didn't have bouillon and used 1 cup chicken stock, 1 cup reserved liquid, and I only used milk, no cream. I would recommend just chopping up the cheese to save time. Also left out celery,and didn't miss it at all...it just complicates the flavour. All in all, creamy and delicious!

Absolutely excellent. I only season mine with salt and pepper, and use vegetable broth instead of chicken, so it's completely vegetarian :)

Awesome broccoli soup! I added corn starch to thicken it up a bit.
