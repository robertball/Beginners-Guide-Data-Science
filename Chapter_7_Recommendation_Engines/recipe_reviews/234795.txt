This meatloaf IS SUPER :) Super simple to make and already had all ingredients on hand, which is wonderful! The only thing different that I used was: instead of using the fresh onions and bell peppers I used an 8 oz package of frozen "Recipe Ready," just because I was in a hurry to get dinner going! LOVE IT :)  Thanks so much!! This is definitely one recipe that is going in my recipe box  :)  Nice change of pace from getting stuck in the rut of having the same things for dinner!

It was good. My husband made it last night for dinner. I laid out all of the ingredients and after he put it in the oven he came running in with the measuring cup of milk in his hand. He forgot to add it. We followed the recipe exactly except for adding the milk and it was very moist. I will make it again and still not add the milk. We had Mac and cheese as a side dish and green beans. Next time I have more time I will do a Spanish rice to go with it.n

Great meatloaf. I could not find Chipolata Flavored Mashed Potatoes so I used a regular cheese flavored and it worked just fine. Personally don't care for avocado but the dish was a hit even without it.

My husband and I love this recipe, the only thing different that we do (though the original recipe is great too) is I like to coat the meatloaf in a spicy sausage pasta sauce (store-bought jar) while it's baking and after the potatoes but before the salsa we add a cup or so of mexican-blend cheese (my husband loves cheese on everything).

Wasn't fond of the potatoes on top, so used all the other ingredients (except the avocado) mixed with the meat.  The salsa helped avoid any dryness mentioned in other reviews.  Served with Spanish rice.  Spiciness level is mild so add more if you want.

This was okay. The meatloaf was a little dry.

Truly amazing!  Making it for the second time as I write this.  We're not avocado fans so we topped with French's French Fried Onions.  The whole family seems to love that little bit of crunch they give.  I also double the recipe and form it into two separate 10x4 loaves on a broiler pan to be sure there is enough for left-overs the next day.

A very easy flavorful family favorite of ours.  I follow the directions, but any ole thing on hand will do.  Zucchini, asparagus, etc.  love having all the stuff you need in a meal, all combined in just a few mins of work..
