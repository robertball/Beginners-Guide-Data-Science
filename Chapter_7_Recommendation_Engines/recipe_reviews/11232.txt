These were great.  I was able to cut out immediately without refrigerating and that means a lot to me.  As usual, I rolled out dough between two sheets of wax paper and then cut out the cookies.  This saves adding lots of flour during the rolling and makes things a lot easier all around.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We always enjoy butter cookies after dinner with a good cup of coffee. These cookies were the best. I used just a bit more sugar, afterall, they are  butter cookies not sugar, and used vanilla instead of almond extract and instead of chilling the dough, I made little balls and smashed them with the bottom of a sugared cup, they  baked well, and my family loves them! Thank you for the very simple and GREAT recipe!

Very good butter cookie.  Easy to make.  I too added vanilla instead of the almond extract.  Would make again.

My sister and i made these just yesterday for valentines day and they came out great! They are very easy to make. They do not spread so u can put a lot on one pan.the dough is easy to work with! They have a simple taste, like a butter cookie. They are very good. Absolutely perfect with the cookie icing on this site. The cookie was not super sweet, but with the icing (which hardens to stackability) it gives it the perfect level of sweetness. Thanks for this recipe!! Very yummy! I like them even w/o icing. You could have them plain w/ tea or something. the cookie comes out white, pretty for decorating!

I love this recipe, it is really simple and the cookies turn out GREAT! I replaced the almond extract with vanilla essence though.

This is the same recipe as Holiday Butter Cookies  here. We have made them for the last couple generations in my family and Christmas wouldn't be the same without them. They hold a cookie cutter very well but not stamps. They must really be iced or else they are very bland. I use the powdered sugar/milk/vanilla mixture for my icing...although they don't look nearly as pretty as the picture above.

I didn't think these tasted very good at all.  My husband said he liked them though.  I thought they tasted like flour.  I used real butter too.  I don't know maybe they need more sugar or something.  When the dough is chilled it's pretty hard but it gets sticky real fast when you are working with it.  It also doesn't make a whole lot of cookies.  I'm not going to use this recipe again, and in the morning I'm going to go to the store to get more butter to make different cookies since I don't want to serve these to my family for Christmas Eve.

These cookies were deliciously crumbly and buttery.  They were a snap to make, with so few ingredients.  My family snatched them up as soon as I took them out of the oven.  Thanks for a great recipe, Heidi.

I just made them for a party, They were great.  I used vanilla instead of almond.  Also, I used my cookie press, and it worked great.

We made a triple batch for a holiday Share Our Strength bake sale. They were easy to work with and turned out beautiful. We needed something simple and quick because we only had 6 hours to get the items ready for sale. Each batch was a different color since we didn't have the time to frost that number of cookies. Simply add a few drops of food coloring to the batch while mixing until you reach desired shade. We used yellow, red and green. Yellow for stars, red for ornaments and green for trees. Sprinkled them with matching colored sugar for each one as soon as they came out of the oven. These were the ONLY item to completely sell out. Thanks Heidi for helping feed hungry kids!

Exactly as the title says - classic butter cookies.  If that is what you are looking for, this is a great recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe!  Very easy to make and delicious!  I iced mine with a simple water, food coloring and icing sugar mixture, and everyone at my son's preschool gobbled them up.

These are very good. I have been searching for a butter cookie texture that has a little more density to it. I was able to work with this one to achieve what I needed. Just a note regarding the cooling of the dough and becoming difficult to work with once it warms up. I keep a giant bag of peas in my freezer to use for bumps & bruises etc. When I work with a batter like this that needs to be cooled, just before I take it out of the fridge to roll out & shape I take the big bag of peas and rub the counter with it and then just let it rest for a couple minutes and just put them back in the freezer. It will really help to keep the dough workable. If rolling out on parchment paper you can use the peas again to keep the work surface cold.

These cookies are delicious.  I have made them several times.  I also substituted vanilla for almond.  If the dough seems sticky and sticks to your roller, add more flour and it should do the trick.

not great. just baked some, intended to surprise my husband on special day but now i had to just crush the cookies for cheesecake base (along with butter, sugar, oats and cinnamon to make up for the lack of flavor). very disappointed. maybe it's meant to go with icing or jams. w/o additional flavor or sweetness these are just flour.

Simple recipe; great for baking with toddlers! I put in 3/4C of sugar instead of 1/2C; just perfect for our sweet tooth! 8 minutes in the oven was good enough- The cookies came out nice and soft and just a touch brown on the bottom.  We used this recipe for Valentine's Day's Cut-outs, but we'll probably be using this for every holiday!

These were good. I did find that I had to chill the dough for about an hour and a half and it was still a bit difficult to roll out but a bit of extra kneading sorted that out. My daughter's boyfriend is chief taster in our house and he loved them. I made these yesterday and there's only about half a dozen left. Will definitely make again

These seem like they are missing something. All you can taste is margarine and that combined with the almond extract does not taste good to me. Maybe you need to use real butter.

An easy and delicious butter cookie!  I used vanilla instead of almond (usually goes over better with my family) and rolled the balls in sugar before flattening them.

Absolutely delicious!  I used vanilla extract instead of almond and they were still quite yummy.  My family absolutely loved them. So much so that we're making them for New Year's Eve.

These cookies were great!  I made a triple batch and cut them out into halloween shapes.  We frosted and decorated them and had enough for all my kids' classes and extras for at home.  I rolled them out fairly thin (less than 1/4") but they were not too crunchy - just right.  They held their shape great and didn't expand the way some cut-outs can.  I will make these again for Christmas!

Made excellent cookies..very tasty!  I did have to use a good bit of flour to keep the dough from sticking causing them to taste alittle floury.  Next time I will dust with alittle powdered sugar in the flour!!

I don't know what went wrong here. I followed the recipe, but added a little more sugar after reading some of the reviews. I refrigerated it overnight, and when it came time to roll out the dough and use the cookie cutters, I had a big mess on my hands. The dough was gooey and sticky and trying to make shapes with the cookie cutters was impossible. I finally managed to make six round cookies, which I baked as a test run to see if I wanted to bother working with the rest of the dough. I tasted one when it was finished, and it wasn't good. It tasted overwhelmingly of flour, and that's it. Despite the extra sugar I added, it still wasn't very sweet, it was just very bland. I decided I couldn't serve these (I was making them for my niece's grad party) and put the rest of the dough down the garbage disposal. I just can't understand why my dough ended up so sticky and unworkable when others seemed to have no trouble with it.

I think it's great!  Being as new as I am in the baking arena... I had no problem at all.  These cookies were just great.  I may add a little sugar next time; otherwise, they are delicious!

My brother wanted me to make raspberry tarts for him (lindzer tarts), and he specifically told me not to make anything too sweet.  This recipe was perfect for the cookies.  They came out great, and he wants me to make more for the upcoming Easter Holiday.  Thank you for a great recipe Heidi!

If you like a very mild cookie, then this is the one for you.  They weren't sweet enough for me.  I used vanilla extract instead of almond (and used 3/4 tsp) and even added 1/2 cup of graham cracker crumbs on a whim.  If I made these again I think I was add at least 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the mix.

To me these cookies tasted pretty plain. An overall easy recipe to make, but I thought that they were missing something. Next time I might substitute lemon extract for the vanilla to give them more flavor. I also double the recipe to expedite my baking time. I wouldn't recommend it.

This turnd out to be a really good cookie.  I used this recipe for a bridal shower and wedding favors.   I made them into large cookie lollipops cut into different shapes (wedding theme).  Everyone loved them and could not stop talking about how good the cookies were.  This recipe is a winner....very buttery.  Thanks again.

This cookie was perfect. My nearly four year old was able to roll it out (after a little bit of kneading on my part), push in the cutter and lift the cookie to the tray with minimal distortion and no difficulties on her part. She is incredibly proud of her accomplishment and the cookies taste FANTASTIC! Thank you Heidi for such a simple but delicious cookie.

These cookies are great.  They're not too sweet, and cut out fairly well.  I had to chill my dough several times while cutting out shapes though.  Guess I'll just have to be a little quicker in the future. :)
