This is a mellow comforting kind of soup.  True to the simple to make claim, it took 15 minutes to prep and 15 to cook as I cut up the potatoes in very small pieces.  I used 2 cups half and half and 1 cup skim as I have half and half to use up.  Regarding the milk, I can see it would be just as good as written.  I served it with Jim's Cheese Soda Bread from this site.  I will make this again!

I really enjoyed this soup with some substations! I added 6 medium sized potatoes diced, I caramelized the onions and added 3 portobello mushrooms with agave syrup. I added basil, onion powder, oregano, bay seasoning, and garlic salt to the soup. Roughly a teaspoon of each. I did not use skim milk but just regular whole milk and instead of half and half I used heavy whipping cream. Next time, Iâ€™ll add a can of corn. It sorta tasted like a clam chowder base soup and I really enjoyed it!

Good soup.  I added a pinch of cayenne and it gave it a nice kick.

Made as written and it turned out a little thin. I really liked the smokiness the bacon added but it was still a little bland for my taste so I added some Old Bay seasoning and that hit the spot. If you like crab and you like clam chowder then you should really give this one a try.

I added some Old Bay rub and some Sherry to add flavor and a little heat.  This soup was better the next day!

Very bland. Added some Old Bay after serving and it made it edible, but not what I was going for.

This soup is amazing, and so quick and easy. I added bacon bits instead of actual bacon and still just as yummy. Even made it a second time and doubled up on the ingredients which I was a little skeptical on but it still turned out great!!
