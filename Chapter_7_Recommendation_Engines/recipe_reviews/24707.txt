This was a very quick and very easy recipe. I made it for a potluck and EVERYONE raved about it. I used fat-free mayo and sour cream and no one could tell the difference!! Will definitely make again.

Used only 12 ozs. sour cream, used substituted 1/2 of the mayo for Miracle Whip (which adds more flave IMHO), added 1/8 tsp of crushed red pepper.  YUMMY!  Served in a bread bowl, it makes a wonderful presentation!

I've always liked this basic (back of every dry vegetable soup mix package) recipe.  I just couldn't bring myself to add the mustard.  I encourage people to try it without the mustard first.  I serve mine in a hollowed-out bread bowl and use the bread for dipping.

This is for sure a "rave-about" recipe for both the maker and the taker. I happened to a thin small slices of carrots that compliment the entire recipe. But it's delicious all the same. It's so good you won't know when to stop and don't expect leftovers!!!

This is very delicious, however I only add a small container of sour cream instead or a large one.  Very tasty!

A great recipe for spinach dip.  I used low fat mayo and sour cream and it tasted great.  I also used a spicy vegitable dip for a spicy/unique taste.

I have made this twice for dinner parties and have received rave reviews. Each time I left with an empty bowl at the end of the night. I used Maille Dijon Mustard and it adds just the right kick! I loved this!

Great dip.  I microwaved 2-9 oz. bags of fresh spinach instead of frozen.  The crunch from the water chestnuts were great.

I have been making this dip for several years and it really goes fast! I usually put the dip into a round of Hawaian Sweet Bread. I cut the top of the round semi vertically (looks like a bowl) and I tear the portion cut out into little pieces and place around the bread bowl. It's a delicious combination of flavors.

This is the kind of dry soup mix you need to use. It is spinach and not onion dip after all. But I have not used the mustard before, will try it though.

Knorrs spinach dip is wonderful, if you use fresh spinach chopped up, not frozen. Much more tasty. Try it and you will never use frozen spinach again. KD

This is missing something.  It could use more spice or less sour cream.  Don't care for the mayo in this.
