Good flavor, but the sauce never thickened. I decided to add two teaspoons cornstarch to the sauce and the microwaved it for a minute to thicken it up.

I made a variation of this on the stove. Saut√©d one whole cut up chicken in a little bit of Canola and sesame oil with a thickly sliced onion to brown it slightly.  Skipped the Sake, added a bit of ginger and garlic paste to the ingredients and added to the chicken. Covered it up, and let it simmer for 20-30 minutes. The sauce thickened a little but I added a bit of cornstarch and water mixture at the end to thicken it even more. Served it with steamed Japanese rice.
