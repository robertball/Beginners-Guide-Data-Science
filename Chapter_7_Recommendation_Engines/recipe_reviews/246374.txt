I needed to use regular Breadcrumbs that I added pares an cheese to, black pepper, cumin and a pinch of smoked paprika. Egg wash as directed, dredge in the crumb mix, 400 for about 25-30 mins for the size of the flowered test I had. Phenomenal! We all loved it! Will be a regular for us. Thank you so much!

This recipe was great!  I didnâ€™t have any panko bread crumbs so I used regular bread crumbs and it turned out great. I already have more cauliflower in the fridge to try again.

This is a very tasty / mouth watering way to spruce up your cauliflower... I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 c. parmesan cheese to the egg mix.

This is an awesome recipe! I made it with 2 parts seasoned breadcrumbs and 1 part parmesan cheese. coat well with olive oil and baked at 380 degrees until golden brown. Totally Delicious! A slight crunch on the outside and moist yet firm inside.

Had trouble getting the larger Panko crumbs to stick.  The ones that did gave the cauliflower a nice crunch.  Used a little flour on some before dipping into the egg and that helped a little.  Also let then sit for a little while before cooking.  Next time I'll try crushing up the panko a little bit, for a smaller texture.  Made these in an Air Fryer.  Great way to enjoy cauliflower.  Thanks for the idea.

I wanted to try something different with the leftover Cauliflower that I had and this sounded very good.  I've had it breaded before, but it was battered and fried.  I didn't have any bread crumbs on hand so I used a mixture of saltines and white cheddar cheese crackers.  I pulsed them in my mini food processor until they were very fine crumbs.  I also added a few more spices and less salt because of the crackers.  Came out very nice.  Crunchy on the outside and tender on the in.  I will definitely be making these again.

Such a simple concept but so delicious!  I added Parmesan cheese and some spices and they turned out so well.  I will make these often!

I have made this multiple times! My husband and I absolutely love this healthier version of fried chicken! I wouldn't change a thing!
