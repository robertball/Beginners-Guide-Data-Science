I am rating this recipe to include the changes I made to it. After looking at the recipe I thought this was a good base, but sounded as thought it might be a bit on the bland side. Sooo..I made a few changes. First I added some garlic. I use the pre minced garlic in the jar so I added about 1 to 1-1/2 teaspoons. I also chopped up a green bell pepper and added it to the mix along with a can of chopped tomatoes with green chilis (rotell tomatoes)to give it a little extra bite. Also in addition to cooking the soup with a ham bone, verses a ham hock, I also cubed up a good amount of left over ham and added it into the soup at the end. The result was yummy and would make again!!

This was the best black eyed pea recipe that I have tried...I substituted a pound of bacon for the ham hocks...it was GREAT...could be served as an entire meal...I impressed everyone with this one, even "seasoned" black-eyed pea eaters!!  I made this the first time for new years and have been making it ever since!!

I used long-grain brown rice (added about 30 minutes after the peas) and a slow cooker so it took me about 4 hours.  I also used precooked diced ham.  The result was VERY flavorful and thick.  Everyone gave it a thumbs up.  Served with cornbread.  This one is definitely going in the recipe box.

Overall this was a good recipe. The only thing I would do different next time is to use less red pepper (it packs quite a punch) and use less rice, so the dish has more of a wet consistency. I had to double the recipe for more guests and should have used 2 cups of rice rather than 3.

Very good!  My husband and son have agreed this will be an annual New Years' Day recipe.  The recipe did not call for it, but I pre-soaked the peas and tossed out the soaking water, adding fresh water for the recipe.  I also increased the water to 5 cups. I also added a can of 'diced tomatoes with chiles' for color and extra flavor.  Couldn't find any smoked cheddar cheese, but regular sharp cheddar worked just fine.  I served it with hot corn bread muffins and a tossed salad.  Great meal!!!

My number one piece of advice is start on this early.  The prep can take awhile, but then it takes care of itself. This is hearty and I'd say the recipe makes enough for at least 6 people to have as a main dish.  I might use ham shanks instead of ham hocks b/c they have more meat.  As left overs I added some fried bratwurst and a dijon style mustard and it was great.

I use Hog Jowls instead of Ham Hocks.  You can get them almost anywhere in the South around New Years and in some stores all the time.  

I also find that cooking the  Black Eyed Peas in a crockpot is better.

Good, inexpensive hearty meal although I would spice it up a little more probably with garlic and more onion.

Really delicious. I had never made hoppin' john before but this will be my new tradition for every new years day! Here are my modifications: I soaked my black eyed peas the overnight and used 3 cups since they had increased in size. I think the reason why people are having trouble with their peas is because they don't pre-soak. I used smoked ham shanks as I couldn't find any hocks - worked great and added a lot of nice meat. I also added 1 clove of garlic and a dash or so of old bay seasoning. I added 2 tsp of "better than bullion" chicken flavor to the simmering process. When I made the rice I actually cooked it separately in some of the broth and a little extra water.
EDIT: Improved this year by keeping the rice and beans to cook SEPARATE the whole time. Just serve the beans on top of the rice. We also found the smoked cheddar to try along with it and it was a very delicious complimentary flavor to the dish. Highly recommend keeping this one simple - it's delicious and filling!

I decided to rate this recipe a 5 even though I haven't made it before. I thought it might offset the poor rating that someone ELSE who never made the dish decided to bestow. I hope this helps, as I always attempt to help out my fellow man.

The end result of this was brown water that tasted mildly of boiled pork.  I added extra onions, garlic and even doubled the red pepper.

Flavorful, easy..might become an annual event. Confused as to why people would rate a dish they never tried...try it, revise it, make it your own,but don't waste review space for something you didn't put any effort into.

I must give this recipe five stars, I am soooooo partial to black-eyed peas...I love them!  I used chicken stock in place of the water, other then that the recipe was perfect!

LOVE IT!  I cook the beans and ham hock with some Tony Chachere's seasoning.  I saute onion, carrots and celery in a little olive oil for a few minutes.  Add some minced garlic for the last 30 seconds.  I put this in the crockpot with 1 cup of rice and I add extra water.  Otherwise, I follow the basic recipe.  It takes a good hour for the rice to cook and my kids are always standing in the kitchen asking, "Is it ready?" YUM!

It doesn't matter what you flavor the black-eyed peas with, it is consuming the black-eyed peas themselves that 'bring your good luck'. These are like pinto beans in that everyone has their favorite ingredients. I've made black-eyed peas for New Years, for over 60 years and I do not always make it with the rice in it for in the leftovers the rice absorbs all the juice. If I make a huge pot then I allow them to mix their peas with the rice themselves. They should be cooked with either a smoked ham hock or a ham bone, I put sofrito in mine plus either 1 serrano pepper or 1 jalapeno, minced (with seeds) as I prefer the heat. Remember that serranos are hotter than jalapenos. And you must have cornbread (sans sugar-with sugar is corncake folks)...Enjoy whether you like it spicy or bland! May you all have a prosperous 2010!!!

This is a poor people's dish.  It was supposedly brought to America by slaves and adopted by white owners of plantations.  It is simple and meant to be that way.  I followed this recipe with the exception of adding some some simple sliced breakfast sausage along with the ham because while looking up the history of the recipe, I found references of adding that and I received RAVES from friends and family.  When I served the leftovers, I poured a jar of home canned tomatoes over the top of the heated up John.  Again, it was a great hit.  This is a good and simple recipe.  I  wouldn't change it.  Thank you!

Hoppin John does not have cheese. The additon of the trinity (celery, bell pepper and onion) at the start and chopped green onions and parsely at the end adds appeal as well as fresh taste.  In the coastal south of Louisiana a little roux is added. Otherwise, this receipe is right on like we make it.

I used leftover ham instead of hocks, black beans cuz I didn't have black-eyed peas, and brown rice.  Very tasty served over cornbread, even if my ham chunks were purple, lol.  People who review recipes they haven't even made need to get over themselves.

To make a stunning presentation of your Hoppin' John, start with a large letuce leaf on each plate (romaine works well), then add a layer of rice (we use jasmine), then the beans, a layer of cheddar cheese, a spoonful of sour cream, then chopped tomatoes, and finally chopped green onions.  Make each layer smaller than the last so you have a colorful pyramid of delicious food.  Beautiful to look at and delcious to eat!  Enjoy!

I'm a senior citizen and grew up in SC. I have eaten Hoppin' John every New Year's day of my life. This is very similar to the way we make it except we've always used Field (Cow) Peas, NOT black eyed peas. We do add little  garlic. I cook my peas the day before to cut down on time on New Year's day.

I just made this for New Years day; friend dropped by.  I decided to add the pre cooked beans to a casserole dish, add the ingredients and cover with foil.  I slow baked the Hoppin John at 275 for two hours lowered the oven temp to 250 when the guest arrived.  After 45 minutes, I pulled the dish out and served buffet style.  This was awesome and popular with my friends.  I will make this a New Years tradition for now on.

Fast to put together and surprisingly tasty.  I used brown rice instead of white and had to add about a cup of extra water to compensate.

Forgive me but I'm giving this dish that Ive not tried to prepare this way myself 5 stars. Im so shocked because I worked in a 4 star restaurant that put this on the menu and although it was very different, it was terrific. What their preparation was is this; all separate components of cooked white rice, cooked chopped bacon and bacon grease, diced scallions, blackeyed peas, chicken stock, and butter. it was all tossed in a pan and cooked through together, and put on a plate with barbecued shrimp. it was to die for, always returned a clean plate. I cant wait to try this version!

I make this every New Year's Day.  I do not mix the rice.  I just serve the peas and let my guests decide whether or not to add rice.  I use hot pepper sauce rather than pepper flakes.

This was ok. I think it needs more than just salt and pepper to taste. It was quite bland. I ended up putting about a TBS of chicken bouillon granules towards the end to give it more flavor. I also thought there was way to much rice. I recommend cutting it down to just 1cup. I had to keep adding water by the cup full several times after i put the rice in. This serves waaaaay more than four people. More like 8 hungry people!

I have a similar receipe that I use, but the only difference is that I use SMOKED HAM HOCKS, which add's a major difference to the flavor AND I do cook my rice separately and just add whatever amount of rice I want with this dish (or just service the beans over the rice).

A friend gave me canned blackeye peas and told me they're supposed to bring good luck for the new year, so I told him to come by and I'd cook them up.  I had to modify since the peas were canned, but I think I kept the recipe pretty close.  Instead of water, I used two cans of low sodium chicken broth and instead of the dry black-eyed peas, I used three cans with the liquid.  I also omitted the red pepper flakes since a couple family members can't take spiciness and instead served Crystal hot sauce on the side.  We all loved it... especially with the kick the hot sauce gives it!  Definitely tasted southern, now we'll see if it brings us luck!

My grandmother and mother have made Hoppin John for as long as I can remember, and this is just as good (if not better).  I must admit upfront that I have never been a fan and only eat it out of tradition's sake.  However,as another user noted it is wonderfully rich and thick.  I did try something different this year and did not stir the beans into the rice and think that it turned out better (just looked better).  Also, I'm not certain why you need the cheese.  Thank you for the recipe!

I followed one reviewer's suggestion and added a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes and some diced leftover ham. At first I thought I had put in too much liquid, but as it turns out I didn't have enough and had to add a bit. The taste was good but it did not turn out as creamy as I expected. I may have misread the recipe; I covered the peas with water (4cups) .I'll make it again but will use the seasonings that my family prefers. My kids love rice and beans so this will be a good recipe to have on hand.

hoppin' john is traditionally made with smoked sausage, rather than ham, as well as braised collard greens.  I recommend sticking to the traditional recipe, as I found that it is much better that way.

This recipe is easily converted for prep in a slow cooker.  We save our holiday ham bones for making recipes like this and the best split pea soup ever, all in the slow cooker.

Sooooooooo good!  Made this today for our New Year's meal and served with cornbread.  Only modification is that I used a little more water, used diced ham instead of the hock and added 1/2 head of cabbage.  I almost forgot to add the smoked cheddar and then as I was serving remembered and shredded some over the top really quickly - wow, what a difference!  We'll definitely have this again for next New Year!

I fixed this recipe on New Year's Day, using the suggestions of other AR members.  I used a tiny bit of olive oil and cooked minced garlic (from a jar) for a few minutes in the bottom of the pot.  I added a can of rotel tomatoes, leftover cubed ham, and canned black eyed peas.  I used chicken stock rather than water. and used a mixture of wild and long grain rice.  I only had 1/4 of a large onion, and I forgot the cheese.  My husband liked it so much he wants me to fix it again soon and make more next time!  Thanks for a great recipe.  We loved it.

I've made this dish for the past three years. I take the quick route and use a can of Goya or Bush's black-eyed peas. This year, I used left-over ham that I cut  into bite-sized chunks. I used a 1/2 cup of chopped mixed peppers (red, yellow, and green), 1/4 cup red onion and 1/4 cup yellow onion, 1 celery stalk chopped, 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, 2 tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp garlic powder, sea salt and fresh ground pepper, and a few dashes of hot sauce. I cooked the veggies in 1 tbsp of olive oil. Then added the spices, ham, and peas and let it simmer while I boiled a bag of Uncle Ben's brown rice (10-12 minutes). Even my 7 yr old loves this dish. Tastes great with cornbread! And don't forget the collard greens!

This was a great base recipe!  What I did differently with fabulous results was: 1) use my slow cooker overnight for 10 hours on low, kept warm (if using unsoaked peas, add time) 2) added celery, onion, 4 cloves of garlic and one potato diced, 3) added 3 bay leaves and three chicken bullion cubes and 4) with the water, added some left over white wine with the ham hock. The only problem was that I woke up every few hours because the house smelled so yummy!  Happy New Year and thanks for a great recipe!

I used chicken broth for the water.  After cooking for about 3 hrs in the slow cooker, I placed Country pork ribs on top that I fried in a pan with salt and pepper and EVOO until browned.  Then cooked for another 4-5 hrs or so.

Who makes this w/black-eye peas? The authentic southern (East Indian/Mediterranean) recipe for Hoppin' John originating in the South (specifically Charleston, South Carolina) calls for "cow peas" (another name is "field peas") is used... not black-eye peas. Of course, cow peas or field peas can only be found in Charleston, South Carolina. A native of Charleston (but now living in the Rocky Mountain West), I have to import the peas. Cow peas/Field peas are dark red and very small (not to be confused w/red beans).
Yes, this is the annual New Year's Day rice dish served w/roast pork and the other usual "southern" dishes (see Charleston.com).

Our family LOVES this recipe.  As others have stated, our family also eats it for New Year's Day every year.  I do get in the mood for it at other times especially during the winter, b/c it is a great comfort food!  I've never tried it with the shredded smoked cheddar though.  Otherwise, I make it exactly as written!  Perfect every time!!

This is a  great recipe.  I did add some garlic powder and some onion powder.  I found some really fat smoked turkey necks and also had a 1/2 pound cured pork.  I soaked my beans over night which greatly reduces the gas problem beans tend to create for a lot of people (don't forget to drain soaked water and refresh before cooking). Cooked Jasmine rice in my rice cooker and served the beans over rice with some fresh chopped white onion. YUMMY!! Never tried it with a can of diced tomatoes, maybe next time.

I left out the rice in cooking but before serving I added in  two cups of leftover cooked brown rice.  I also added a diced yellow pepper and a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles and some extra leftover ham.  Mine was much more soupy than the picture shows, but my family and guests loved it.

I used 1LB cooked thick sliced hickory bacon, cut into 1" strips.  2 cans of stewed tomatoes (w/celery), 1 bell pepper finely diced cooked w/the onion in the left over bacon grease , 1 tsp minced garlic, 3/4 cup whole grain long rice instead of 1 1/2 cups and 1/2 tsp cajun seasoning instead of the red pepper, simmered for closer to 2 hours and it came out great  this is the first time I've ever cooked beans not in a can! This along w/the Buttery corn bread recipe from this site is wonderful! Also make sure to NOT bring the beans to boiling while they are simmering or they'll burst open, I used a quick soak method and boiled them hard for 3 minutes.  The recipe didn't call for it but I covered the pot while boiling (my trusty Betty Crocker cook book said to cover beans while simmering).

This recipe as exactly the right combination of seansonings (ham, onion, and especially the red pepper flakes).  The problem that I had when preparing this recipe was that there was not enough liquid remaining after the first 1.5 hours to accomodate the 1.5 cups of rice.  The combined black-eyed pea & rice mixture ended up with the consistency of concrete until I added an additional 2 cups of water that the rice needed.  Next time I will fix the rice in a separate container and then serve them with the black-eyed peas placed on top of the rice (along with corn bread).

Very good! I added some jalapeno and green bell pepper and served on New Years Day. Everyone at the table loved them, even those that don't like black eyed peas. I highly recommend!

I am from the south and have always wanted to make this dish.  My aunts make the best pots of beans.  I love when I go home to visit they always have a pot of somethin stewing in the kitchen.  Ok..This dish was excellent but took alot longer then expected.  I used water and chicken stock.  The ham hocks were soooo good.  I added a can or rotell diced tomatoes with green chilis to kick it up and lots of garlic.. I gotta have my garlic.  Next time I will soak the beans and cook the rice seperately and then combine all.  Very excellent dish with cornbread and a salad. YUM!

2 questions:  1) can this be made in a slow-cooker?
2) what would you use for the rest of the menu?

This was a great cold weather dish.  I omitted the ham and added fake bacon bits at the end instead, which was great.  It would be kind of bland without it.  I also used a little bit of lemon grass and that gave it a nice flavor.  Will make again.

This was good! I made it with 4 chicken legs instead of ham hocks, as my daughter doesn't eat pork. Also added a chopped red bell pepper. It definitely needs some salt and pepper at the end, and Frank's hot sauce was a popular addition around the table. I made wilted kale with garlic and balsamic vinegar on the side, and that mixed well with the Hoppin' John, too.

i give this 4 stars only because some in my family did not like it. i took all the ingredients and threw them into the crock pot. I really liked it. Seasoned perfectly as recipe is listed no need for more, but you could add if you wanted.

I followed the recipe and used ham hocks I got at local store.  I also bought a package of ham chunks and added it to the beans in the last stages of cooking. Very good!

Today is the first time that I've made, and eaten this dish.  I was NOT disappointed!  I followed the recipe only making a couple of changes.  I added a couple of whole allspice and cloves and used chicken broth instead of water.  My kids and I aren't big fans of spicy food so I left the red pepper flakes out.  My husband added a dash of tabasco to his as he does like spicy.  This will be our new New Years lunch from now on.

Substituted Brown rice for white and had to cook longer and added a little extra crushed red pepper which made it perfect for my husband but too spicy for myself.  Next time I will totally leave out the red pepper and let him add it to his plate.

I want to try this recipe (I will give it 5 stars since I haven't tried it yet and it requires stars).  I use 2 cans of Black-eye peas, 1 pound browned sausage and no cheese.  I use celery as well as onion (doesn't affect the taste much, but adds tons of nutrients).  Quick and easy supper with plenty of leftovers.  I make it several times a months and everytime I have taken it to a "covered dish supper", I have gotten rave reviews and a clean pan.

I loved this dish.  Very minor modifications-- I used brown rice, so I had to cook it for about 20 extra minutes. I also had to add an extra 1 1/2 c. water. I added 2 tsp of minced garlic and decreased the red pepper flakes to accommodate kids.  Family members thought it was "too subtle", though.

With my changes, this is now a 5 star dish.  First, I used 1 lb. of dried black-eyed peas and 4 bay leafs and put them in my crock pot on warm.  I really didn't think I would be doing any cooking until the morning, but 4 hours later, the peas were tender, so I drained the peas and removed the bay leafs.  I put the peas back in the crock pot with 1 large white onion that I had diced and sauteed along with 4 cloves of chopped garlic and 4 diced jalapenos - 2 of which I seeded before sauteeing.  I then added a 20 ounce can of petite tomatoes with the liquid and stirred, and one diced red smoked and seeded red pepper.  I then sauteed approx. 2 lbs. of chicken sausage without the casings, but with the 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  Once drained, I added that to the pot and stirred.  I added 2 tablespoons of kosher salt, a 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, and 2 tablespoons of cumin for that smoky flavor.  I added 4 cups of water and 4 bouillon cubes, and stirred it altogether.  After about an hour when everything was hot and the flavors melded together, I tasted it and realized it would be too spicy for my friends (they don't eat pork), so I added a 1/2 cup of honey, and a lot of the heat dissipated.   I then cooled that overnight and reheated it in the morning.  The flavors were perfect, but the stew was a bit too soupy for my tastes.  So, I added 1 cup of medium grain white rice and 2 lbs. of fresh chopped spinach.  I also omitted the shredded cheese.  Served with hearty bread.

As many other have, I made my own variation of this recipe and the flavor was just amazing!  First, I sliced in half a stick of butter, the onion, chopped up about 7 cloves of fresh garlic and used one of the packets of crushed red pepper that you get from the pizza parlor.  I used 2 cups of black-eyed peas because that was the size of the package.  I boiled the beans then simmered for about 25 minutes, then drained and rinsed under cold water.  I then placed the sauteed onions, garlic and crushed red pepper into my crock pot, along with the leftover Honey Baked Ham we had for Christmas, keeping the bones in the pot for the whole cooking time.  Then added the beans, about 3 1/2 cups of water, salt and pepper.  No cheese.  I steamed some Jasmine rice and served it separately.  The flavor was rich and packs a lingering punch from the little bit of red pepper.  Delicious!

This recipe was great. I had to make some revisions because of not having the exact ingrediants.  I took the advice from another reviewer and used chicken broth instead of water.  Cut up smoke sausage instead of ham hocks.  Used 1 can of French Onion soup.  I only left the rice out because my husband doesn't care for rice.  Served this with hot out-of-the-oven cornbread.  Will definetly be making this again.
** I would advise to soak the peas overnight.  I cooked this with the crock pot for 10 hours and they were still a little crunchy.  Had to finish in the pressure cooker.

This is a good recipe, but I grew up in the South.  Real Hoppin John's are a little different down there.  You cook the black-eyed peas and the rice but then you put them in a dish and add fresh tomatoes, onion and corn bread to the dish.  The southern version is a very good summer time, fresh from the garden version.  Try it both ways!!!

Great recipe, but being from Texas we add jalapenos to everything. I changed ham to bacon and added okra with stewed tomatoes and garlic. I also used frozen black eyes.     Julie

I made this for a New Year's Day party that we hosted.  Everyone loved it and I had several requests for the recipe!  Several people said they took the peas because they meant good luck but didn't like them.  They changed their mind after they ate them!

Excellent base, listened to others, prepped the black eye peas, added plenty of spicy sliced peppers, a shallot, plenty of garlic, sliced bacon, bay leafs, and a can of diced spicy tomatoes with a little brown sugar to cut the tomatos acidity  and yes we like spicy,  but still was not too spicy for us...ooo and substitued chicken stock for the water...cooked the rice at the end and just put the Hoppin John on top of the rice to serve..

Made this today with a buffalo chicken rice, chicken stock, bacon (didn't have ham hocks), green, red, white onions and scallions & added corn. Honey and I both loved it (which is always the test of a 5 star rating )!

This was good.  I made it mostly like the recipe except I soaked my BEP first, and then rinsed and drained them, as I was not going to cook them for a few more hours and I didn't want them to sit in the soaking water for that long.  That might have removed extra flavor...not sure.  But, as many have said, this is a simple meal, and meant to be that way, so that being said, it was good!  I also added celery and red pepper (I have no green ones), and used up some ham from my freezer instead of the hock, and was about 1/4 cup short on BEP.  We love BEP's, so next time, I would definitely use about 2 cups instead.  My 12 year old daughter ate 3 servings, so this is a keeper at my house.  It is similar to another recipe we make, except that one has bacon, carrots, and actually calls for celery and green pepper.  We serve it with rice (cooked separately) or corn bread.  Over all, a good, comforting meal, and hoping the BEP's bring another good year for us!  Thanks for sharing.

OMG, these were so good, of course I made slight modifications. I cut up onions to cook into the recipe and I used ham pieces, chicken bioullion and cooked in slow cooker for 4 hours, I then added about a cup of long grain cooked rice.  this was such a good recipe.  Thanks to the originator. I often find very good recipes on this website and just make slight adjustments for my taste

Used my cast iron dutch oven to make this dish, or should I say try and make this dish.  I followed the directions up to the point of adding the white rice... Did not cook in the 20-25 mins suggested. I even went longer and had to add water.  I think cooking it longer caused the peas to get mushy and my husband did not care for the dish, for the mushy peas and said it was somewhat bland.  May try again, cooking the rice separtely and spice it up a bit.  Should I have not used my Dutch oven?

This is definitely better with chick stock, and garlic. I don't care for collards, so at the end of cooking, I toss in a bunch of fresh spinach to wilt it, and then serve. Turns out great!

CHICKEN BROTH!!! For those who felt it was bland, replace the water with chicken broth. It makes a world of a difference. I also add bell peppers (green, yellow and red) and okra.

I happened to find this when I was looking for a way to do lamb shanks in the slow cooker. It was delicious and has turned out to be a favourite. A local farmer sells fresh lamb and organic beans at farmers' market. Now I make this about once a month and it provides three meals for me and my partner. I use the lamb shanks in place of ham and substitute red cargo rice for white rice. The seasoning to my Canadian tastebuds is just right, not at all bland. Everything except the cheese goes into the slow cooker on low for 8 hours. Many thanks for a new favourite.

Great starter up recipe!!! Want to add my 2 cents. Instead of all water, I use Chicken broth when I cook the peas and ham/bone, add a can of green chili peppers, cut up onion, then I add rice. Sometimes I throw in some cut-tomatoes, too, but it's whatever stirs your pot!! :o)

So good.  Doubled the recipe but would caution others about doubling the rice.  I used 8 cups of water and 2.5 cups of rice and it was STILL too much rice.  Should have used 2 cups tops.  Despite coming out dry and sticky versus wet and soupy as I would have preferred, it was still DELICIOUS.  Will absolutely make this again.

Delicious. I did add several cloves of minced garlic which was suggested and decided to leave the rice out. Also used the leftover ham bone from Christmas. Full of flavor, didn't need anything else added. Will make again. Although technically this makes it a Black eyed pea soup. Still rates 5 stars. Yummy.

First of all...I don't understand why people would rate/review a recipe they've not tried.   We just finished this for our New Years dinner and thought it pretty good.  Good enough to make again.  I just salt and peppered, but the family used hot sauce.  If I would have had some celery I would have put that in for a bit of crunch at the end of cooking. We also only had extra sharp cheddar on hand so used that.  I didn't put rice in it, but instead made corn muffins.

Great crockpot recipe for our New Year's Eve gathering. I did not use Ham Hocks, instead I used some of my bone-in Ham cut up. I made the rice separate and let my guests add the cheese if they wanted it. I did add a clove of crushed garlic and used 4 chopped green onions vs 1 chopped onion. This was a hearty dish with or with out the rice. I ate it both ways and actually preferred it without the rice and cheese. Thank you! Happy New Year!

Smoked Ham Hocks or Jowl make a big difference. I always add a little ham and finish it off with hot sauce and chopped onion once it's in the bowl. Just keep adding water or stock if it gets too thick for your liking. Even better the next day!

Excellent recipe- as the Kitchen Witch I had to tinker a bit. My changes included: adding a finely chopped green pepper, 3 handfuls of fresh, stemmed spinach, 1 lb. of bacon instead of ham hocks, 6 cloves of garlic- finely diced, I omitted the rice and finished it over night in the crock on low. MmHmm, an excellent New Years Day (or anytime) recipe-cheers!

This was my first time making Hoppin' John.  I am so glad that I used this recipe.  I did make a couple of changes.  I added two cans of Rotel tomatoes.  It gave it a nice kick!  I left out the smoked cheese because I didn't have any, but it was still delicious.  Mine dried out after it sat a while.  I'm sure that I can reconstitute it for leftovers with a little chicken or vegetable stock.  This is a true Southern dish and we loved it.

Hoping to make this recipe a New Years Day tradition!  Cooked this in the crock pot, cause I needed things to be a little easy if ya know what I'm sayin'.  Just threw everything in and cooked it on low for 6 hours.  I did not presoak the beans and they turned out perfect - not too mushy.  I cooked the rice separate and served the beans over it with hot sauce as an optional condiment.  Couldn't find a smoked cheddar so subbed smoked gouda.  Awesome!!

Excellent way to make the black-eye peas we all need on Jan 1 for luck. We have an onion allergy in our family, so I made a few modifications - I sauteed 4 cloves of minced garlic in some olive oil, added the crushed red pepper to the oil and then the black-eye peas - then sauteed the peas a bit in the oil/garlic/red pepper and then finally, added them to the already boiling water. No cheese at the end though - doesn't seem right.

If you make this with bacon and use the grease to flavor the dish, it is really much better. Top with cold, cut canned tomatoes and a little hot sauce, YUM!!! Everybody loves it!

The recipe didn't sound very good to me, but my husband wanted me to make it.  I will make it again.  I enjoyed it, but had to add a lot more water, the beans and rice soaked up a lot of it.  Next time I will try soaking the beans the night before, and then follow the recipe.  It was very easy to make and everyone enjoyed it.

We've eaten this for years, but usually use a can of field peas instead of black eyed peas. Since they don't need to cook long I just cut up some ham and cook it in a skillet until it starts to brown and sprinkle over the top of the meal.  It makes it a VERY fast prep and a very healthy meal.

First off- if I wouldn't have found this recipe on here, I probably wouldn't have made this dish. But it just happened to be Dec. 31st and I had a bunch of dried black eyed peas still around from the garden.  I love this meal.  I did use 2 cups of peas.  And two ham hocks.  Probably five cups of liquid, part beer, part water.  Plus a green bell and a couple big garden habaneros.  Thanks-  I'll be making this a few times a and every New Years Day!

This is the best black eyed pea recipe!  I read the other reviews and decided to make some changes, too.  I didn't soak the peas, added chunks of pre-cooked ham and Rotel w/ hot peppers (maybe a bit too hot) and cooked 5 hours in the crockpot.

I made this according to the recipe given and the mixture was very dry and pasty, plus the rice was crunchy.  It definitely needed more liquid(2-4 more cups) and way less rice (3/4 cup).  I also think it needs a bit more heat.  I'll try it again but with my modifications.  It was nothing like my Mom's New Year's black eye peas and ham hocks recipe.

This is close to a 5 but of course I always add garlic. I love garlic. For a fast and easy kick to this awesome dish try a spicy picante sauce and course pepper.

Too much and the rice comes out tough. I added a can of diced tomatoes and made in slow cooker. The rice didn't get as fluffy as it would have had it been cooked alone and added at the end. I ended up throwing away nearly half of it because it made so much and was so filling. Also, remember to serve with hot sauce.

Takes too long to make. It was long grain rice that ruined the whole meal. I added more water and the rice still didn't set up right.

I cooked the rice totally separately.   For the peas, I did a "quick soak" on the dried black eyed peas  (bring to a boil, then soak for am hour.) .  I sautéed onions with a couple of stalks of celery and some garlic.  Then put the recipe ingredients (minus the rice and cheese) into the crock pot.  Cooked on low for about 6 hours.    In the meantime, I cooked 1 pound of smoked sausage slices, and drained on a paper towel.  After slow cooking the peas, I added 1 can of rotel, and the smoked sausage.  Cooked for another hour.  Served over rice.

It aint new years without Hoppin John!!!!
I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of substituting smoked pork for seasoning to replace the ham hocks.  Since I cut the recipe in 1/2 it was much easier to use the pre-cut pieces so they fit down into the water and peas.  I did cook it a bit longer than the recommended  1 1/2 to 2 hours so that the peas formed a slightly thicker gravy when I added the rice.  Excellent flavor and the seasoning worked out just about perfectly as called for in the text.  Since my wife doesn't do hot, I also cut way back on the pepper flakes to accommodate her tender palate.  Definitely a make again recipe for my son and I!!!!

Tried this recipe out. It was very very good. I did add 2 garlic cloves to it and half a diced green pepper. I cooked my white rice separate and served the beans on top. Yea will do this one again. This recipe is not bland at all. If you are a foodie you will enjoy this. This is simple soul food. If you want an explosion of spices try a chili recipe instead.

Very disappointed.  Followed the recipe to a T but I won't do that again...way, way too dry.  I highly recommend making the rice separately and ladling the Hoppin John on top of it.

As written I thought this recipe was not very nice at all.  I tried to save it by adding garlic, a splash of vinegar, mustard, and ham bullion.  That made it edible but I don't think I'll bother with it again.

Just for clarification, "rotel" tomatoes consists of jalepeno peppers rather than chilis.

As other suggested, I added a can of tomatoes (with jalepeno peppers instead of pepper flakes). FYI - I learned from the guy in the meat dept that ham hocks are usually called shanks. I cooked it all in vegetable broth, but that made it a little too salty, so I wouldn't do that again. I also added diced ham. The smoked cheddar cheese on top was key! Great with corn bread muffins.

I gave 5 only because with some additions and deletions this is an awesome dish...added garlic...stewed tomatoes, cubed ham and tasso...next time i will try rotel tomatoes but then again my family likes spicy foods...recipe calls for way too much rice..I read the other reviews so I cut back on the rice...I  more than tripled the recipe but kept the original amount of rice..still way too much..can not imagine that much rice in the original recipe!!!...next time I may cook rice separately and add at the end

A classic, traditional recipe and as such you shouldn't tinker too much with it. I use brown rice but no cheese which I think is more faithful to the original. Sure, splash on the Tabasco! That's traditional too. Happy New Year!

Pretty good - the beans did not need 90 minutes to soften, in fact, most of the black-eyed peas were mush by the time the dish was finished.  I would also recommend reducing the quantity of rice to ~1 cup.

I've made Hopping John for many years. This recipe is basically what I follow with a few exceptions. I used Tabasco (to taste) instead of red pepper flakes. I also used salt pork (about 1/8 pound cut up) and 1/8 tsp. of baking soda. My family loves this so much that I must make it more often than New Years day!

I just made this for family today, and it was delicious!  Everyone loved it. I heard this dish was a traditional New Year's Day dish to bring luck for the new year...hope that works too!  It may have needed a bit more water, but all in all it turned out great.  A simple and delicious dish; I'll make it again.  Oh, and I'd recommend NOT omitting the smoked cheese, it made it even better.

I make Hoppin John with Black Eyed Peas every New Year's Day. I used to make it with Smoked Ham Hocks, but as one of my sons became a vegetarian 5 years ago...      I now make a Vegetarian Version which follows this recipe closely, but instead of Meat I use a couple teaspoons of Liquid Smoke, Olive Oil, and smoked veggie bacon.  Only add 1 cup of rice during the last 1/2 hour and pre-soak the black eyed peas.  We use much more liquid (vegetable broth is good) and add Tabasco Sauce to taste after taking it off the flame. Serve with my cornbread and collard greens.

I had never thought of using cheddar cheese with Hoppin' John but think it's a good addition.  Rotels and a couple of tablespoons of catsup added something a little extra as well.  Let's face it:  Southerners know how to make good simple grub!

There was nothing bland about this delicious dish!  I followed the recipe but in addition, added three chopped jalapenos, four chopped roma tomatoes, three garlic cloves and two pork chops that were sitting in the refrigerator.  I used two cups of rice instead of three.  I was cooking this New Year's Eve and it smelled so good, my husband and I had a bowl for dinner!

This was good, better than I thought.  I added rotel, as per a review, and some smoked sausage, in addition to the hocks.  I only kept some of the hock meat.  I also added some garlic and some texas pete's.  Will make again!!

I use country style ribs, seasoned and browned with the onion.  I don't know how to cook without garlic.  I add spinach to make a one-dish meal, and because I look for ways to use spinach.  Of course, I serve with corn bread.  This my recently-adopted New Year's tradition.  Many thanks.

Great recipe but cheese isn't in MY hoppin' john.  I like to serve the rice on the side.  Just a green salad as accompaniment rounds out a hearty New Year's Day meal.  Thank you for the recipe!

A little bland, but workable.  I followed the recipe for the most part except I was using fully cooked cubed ham which I added at the very end.  Before I served this I tasted it, it was just a lot of spice, but not much flavor.  I had read the reviews in which someone added tomatoes.  I used half a jar of spaghetti sauce instead.  It flavored it enough with tomato and more spices but didn't overpower it with a real strong tomato sauce base.

I made this for my bf, who always has black-eyed peas and hog jowl on New Years.  We think it might have been better if we pan fried the hog jowl before adding it to the dish; it's such a fatty meat.  Otherwise this was good, tasting very much like any beans and ham do.

I also added chicken broth for extra flavor as well as water otherwise it gets too thick for me. Cheddar cheese and the red pepper flakes make this perfect!

Taste was good, but the recipe could have used more water.  The black-eyed peas absorbed too much of the water and I didn’t have enough for the rice. Also I added 2 smoked pork chops chopped up and I’m glad I did because there wasn’t hardly any meat from the ham hocks.

 Subbed ham for the smoked turkey. Subbed spinach for the collards and used a couple of pieces of bacon instead of oil. I loved it.

This was good! I left out the rice (and water!) for lower carb count.  I was leery of the cheddar cheese but I’ve got to say it melted into a nice sauce and was tasty with the ham and peas! Hope the New Years good luck tradition holds true!

I’m pretty sure I’ve made this before and it turned out good last time but this time not so much. I had my heat turned as low as it would go and I still had to keep adding water yet it still turned out like retried beans. It tastes good but the texture is all wrong and looks awful. Won’t try this recipe again. Moving on.

CHEESE?! That definitely doesn't belong here. Makes me question the recipe. Missing some green pepper, celery or chopped tomatoes, depending on what yo believe is most authentic.

I would make it again.  For a yankee it turned out well.  My 17 year old grandson, who has southern roots loved it.  
I did made it with the chicken broth instead of water.  I added a few tablespoons of dehydated vegetables & some chipolte seasoning.  The grated smoked gouda really was a marvelous addition.   Thank you.

I have made this recipe a few years in a row now on New Years Day and although I love the flavor, I always have to add about 2 cups of water and 30+ minutes to the cook time just to get the rice to cook all the way and it is quite frustrating. From now on, I will cook the rice separately and add it in at the end, otherwise I will find a totally different recipe for it.

This was a disappointment.  I had to add a lot more water about 2-3 cups with the rice since the beans soaked up all the liquid.  It was very bland so I had to add a lot of salt and pepper and garlic.   It was a lot of work to get it to taste edible and the rice still ended up a little hard.  Will not be making this again.

Good comfort food, will make it again. After reading reviews I used chicken stock instead of water, added celery and a little garlic. Fresh ground black pepper in generous amounts. Next time I might use some leftover ham instead of hock.

Very good. This is my go-to recipie but I do make a few changes: substitute chicken stock for half or all of the liquid, add garlic or garlic powder and add 1/4 cup rice if the broth is too thin. I make this about once a month and it's always been a big hit!

I was very disappointed with this recipe since even though I liked the concept it took much longer for everything to get done. Now I did double the recipe since I was making it for a group of people, so I did add extra cooking time as well. However, the rice never seemed to get tender and the ingredients did not meld together as much I would have liked it, so if I make hoppin' John in the future I will probably use a different recipe.

This is awesome.  The flavor of the black eyed peas really comes through.  I made a double batch and used the ham bone from the Christmas ham.  They turned out great.  Everyone has their own way of spicing them up, but if you just love black eyed peas like I do then this is for you.  I only added 1/2 the amount of crushed pepper. I served mine over rice but my husband ate them just the way they were.  YUM!!!

Great New Years recipe, but I made some changes too. I use Goya ham seasoning instead of the hamhocks (1 packet per pound of beans), and I also used a little cayenne instead of red pepper flakes. I garnished with some fresh green peppers, onions & diced tomatoes rather than cooking them in the recipe as another cook suggested. I got rave reviews and it is fairly low in fat!

A very , very good recipe, but I added about 1/4C chopped jalapinos instead of the red pepper.
