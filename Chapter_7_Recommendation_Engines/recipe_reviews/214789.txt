Mmmmm! Yummy! I always make my steaks (but I don't score the steaks since I find that it dries out the meat) and roasts this way, except instead of the grainy mustard, I use Dijon,(Maille Brand to be exact) and always add a little bit of crushed garic and dried thyme, too.  Thanks for sharing.

Everyone liked this steak. Used garlic, black pepper, thyme and oregano to season the steak. I did not use the onions because my son-in-law does not like onions. The mustard stuck to the bottom of the pan. I deglazed with red wine and poured this over the steaks. Very good and yummy with bread dipped in it.

My husband loved it. I followed all the instructions with only the addition of crushed garlic. I will make again.

I was perusing the site for a mustard crusted steak recipe and This one caught My eye. Though it was not quite  what I had in mind, it really turned out superb!  I used Paula Deen's  basic House seasoning. Perfect. I used  a grainy Dijon mustard and used probably twice as much as recommended. Sweet onions chopped fine and pressed into every inch. We had a couple 2"  Bacon wrapped tenderloins to try this recipe on. Honestly can't begin to tell you how good it is! We are jones'n for it again already! Simple to make and Oh! the flavor!!!

Prep was simple and the cooking easy. The result was good enough for me, although I would advise more mustard than called for. I used a very strong mustard and I had a hard time picking out its flavor.

Wowza!  Usually I am a minimalist when it comes to steak.  Garlic Salt, Lemon Pepper and grill it.  This recipe was awesome!

I made this steak for my husband in my cast iron skillet. I won't repeat what he said but let's say he enjoyed it. Quick and easy as well as super tasty!

Average, I followed the directions exactly but I didn't like it very much and my husband refused to eat it.
