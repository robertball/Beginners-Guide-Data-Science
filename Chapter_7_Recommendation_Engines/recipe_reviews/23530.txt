This is good but it lacks the egg white that is used in the original Orange Julius recipe.  It was made with 1 l/4 cup of orange juice instead of frozen), 1 cup of water, all the rest of the ingredients were the same except that you added one egg white when you are ready to blend it.  That is what gives it the froth!  I'm sure there really isn't much difference if you use orange juice or frozen but adding the egg white really adds to the appearance.

Great smoothie!  I added heavy cream, which gave it an awesome creamy texture.  After tasting how it turned out (so I knew if I'd make it plain) I added peach schnapps. The schnapps overpowered the vanilla taste (I LOVED the vanilla taste) but tasted very good.  I'll be making this again!  I also tried freezing my OJ in an ice cube tray - makes for an excellent smoothie texture!

These are really delicious and truly an eye opener in the morning.  They're almost like the orange julius drinks you used to get in the mall.  (Do those things even still exist?) Next time I may add some vanilla ice cream to thicken it up.  I too added vanilla extract to mine.

VERY similar to "orange glorious" also found on this site but it is tasty just as it is. I ended up make two batches this morning...both excellent! In the second "batch," I added a few frozen strawberries and another tsp of vanilla. Also makes for a great after-school snack for kids!

This is a fantastic reciepe.  My husband loves orange juice, but typically can not drink it because of the amount of acid it has in it.  But this reciepe somehow dilutes the acidity, and he can drink it just fine without it giving him any stomach problems.  I love it too, tastes great!!!

The vanilla and orange is an unexpected surprise. This is so delicious. I reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup for the grandkids. For me, I add 1T wheat germ and 1T brewers yeast to jump start me in the mornings.Thanks for starting our days off right, Trudy!

Yum! This was great. I love how it was a bit fluffy, and very light. I used skim milk so this thing was totally guilt-free. Delicious. Will make again.

I thought this was fairly average. I liked the frothy texture, but taste was average.  It's not a recipie I would use regularly.

Very good.  Didn't even have frozen oj on hand so I squeezed the juice from 1 orange (only made 1 serving) and omitted the water. I also used soy milk.  I'll try it again w/ the frozen oj and see what the difference is...probably just thicker.

This is delicious!  No fancy ingredients and so it's a no brainer.  It tastes like an orange Julius but a little runnier.  I'll definately make it again!

Great base for an orange smoothie! I made a few minor changes to suit our tastes. I prefer a smooth smoothie so we left out the ice. Also left out the sugar since my healthy husband was sharing this with me. I will make this again! **Update ** I also started to make this using organic vanilla almond milk and it is super tasty. Kinda taste like an orange Starburst.

These are so good!  My children have a milk allergy and don't care to drink soymilk but when put in this tasty recipe they drank it right down and ask for more. I made it with calcium enriched orange juice for an extra calcium boost .  We will be drinking lots of these this summer for a cool energy kick and will work perfect to send out the door with my teen when he's in a rush to get to school next fall. Wonderful recipe.

This is a great recipe! You can skip the sugar by adding a fresh banana - still tastes sweet enough for our taste. I also added two rings of fresh pineapple. Turned out perfectly!

Awesome Recipe I added one thing and that was a scoop of vanilla ice cream and then I blended it real good. I had to make a double batch my kids just couldn't get enough. This Recipe is a keeper.

Cool and refreshing. I used caster sugar (superfine sugar) so it would melt easier in the blender. I doubled the ingredients, but didn't have room in the blender for 20 ice cubes, so just used 14. Everyone really enjoyed it. I might add a bit less sugar next time, but everyone else said the sugar content was fine.

This is the same ingredients I use to make an: "orange julius" drink like they have at the malls. The only difference is I use 1/4 cup a sugar, so a tad less and 5-6 ice cubes. I did today though follow this recipe and couldn't really see the difference, with the small changes on this recipe. I topped it with a little whipped cream today for a change. It is a very simple and tasty refreshing drink!

This is an excellent base recipe!! I believe the recipe is very simple and easy to alter depending on individual tastes. As I read in an earlier review, the brand of O.J. concentrate is an important part to the success of this smoothie. I used a Meijer brand and it was more bitter than I cared for and when I used the second half of the can for the second batch, I upped the sugar to half a cup and upped the vanilla extract to 1 1/2 tsp. I also used a canned whipped cream on top, which added a more creamy/frothy texture (was very good and did not make overly sweet!). Thanks Trudy for this awesome recipe!! Can't please everyone, but you have pleased me and my family (and apparently many others!)

YUM! To give it that Orange Julius frothiness, I added 1 egg white, 1 Tbsp cornstarch, and 1 Tbsp powdered coffee creamer. Sounds gross but it tasted perfect!

DO NOT DOUBLE THIS RECIPE 
Like seriously don't 
This drink will multiply
And before you know it 
Your entire kitchen will be submerged in frothy goodness
Keep away from children, as from personal experience I have found that it is quite easy to lose them in the mess. 
But all in all, I enjoyed it.

My family loves this easy recipe! We have tried many frozen concentrates and found some could use a little more suger & some less. Our favorite is pineapple-orange made the same way as directed.

This was really yummy - it tasted like a creamsicle.  The whole family loved it.  I used 1 cup of orange juice concentrate because I couldn't find any 6oz packages.  I served it with our Sunday morning breakfast of apple pancakes and sausages

Delicious! I'm in my first trimester of my pregnancy and need orange juice but the acid in it makes me sick. So I tried this out and it goes down smoothly. I added vanilla ice cream but I forgot to put the sugar in and it came out great!

I really liked this but I did change the recipe a bit and scaled it to 1 serving. I used 3/4 cup orange juice, 1/2 cup milk, omitted the water, 1/8 tsp vanilla, 3 packets Splenda and 6 ice cubes. I have a Vitamix so there was no need to add an egg white (like suggested in a few reviews) since mine came out very frothy.  Will make again.

Awesome tasting smoothie! I added vanilla ice cream (about 5 big scoops of it) and a lot more ice to get it to the consistency I like (thick). This was a huge hit! I topped it off with whipped cream and it looked and tasted great!

I loved this. Didn't have the frozen stuff, so I squeezed 2 oranges. I'd suggest blending everything first, before adding ice, so that sugar dissolves more. Can't wait to try with the frozen stuff as well.

I took the advice of using 1 /14 cup of orange juice and an egg white.  I love the froth.  It does taste like a good 'ol Orange Julius or an orange cream bar.  My kids had them before their soccer games.  One of our favorites!

Sweet and refreshing. I did use real oranges and not orange juice concentrate. Opted to add the chia seeds and a about a T of strevia/sugar blend. Tried with and without vanilla extract and I prefer the smoothie without it.

As written, it has too much vanilla extract (and I love that stuff!), but cut that back to 1/2 tsp. and you will have it just about right. Also, if you have it, use Mexican Vanilla in place of the stuff you buy in the grocery store. You will not believe the difference that will make in ALL your recipes. I also used an overripe banana in place of the sugar and I used almond milk. Kept the whole thing light and guilt-free while be very refreshing and delicious!

Loved this recipe! I just made a lighter version of it just because I'm on a strict diet. I used skim milk, low fat yogurt and kept away from the sugar! :)

These were great - my family loved them.  I wish they were a little thicker - may cut down on the water next time.  I threw a banana and some protein powder in them to thicken it up and add some extra vitamins.  Made a great healthy breakfast drink!

Did not like this at all. This tasted strange...I served to guests without testing it out and that was a big mistake. They did not drink theirs either but politely said it was 'good'.  Something is just off in this...I will try other combinations because I love orange smoothies.

Tastes just like an Orange Julius.  There is an Orange Julius store at one of the malls near me.  I used a previous reviewers advice and used 1 1/4 cup orange juice.  Everything else was the same.  I made it in a smoothie blender and it came out frothy.  My children loved it!

I've used this classic recipe many times and have varied the kind of juice with great success. This morning I tried it with frozen pineapple concentrate and I think I like it better than the orange! Easy and refeshing everytime!

I made this to go with breakfast this morning. I added a frozen banana and omitted the sugar and ice. I thought it
was good without the sugar, but my husband thought it was bitter. 

Next time I make this, I'll add sugar for
him. For those who would rather not, 
you can trust me that it's not really needed.

This was great.  Like another reviewer said, it tasted like an Orange Julius drink, but minus all the calories.  I used an extra cup of fat free milk instead of water and splenda instead of sugar.

I think I need to find a better-tasting concentrate; it was a little chalky & artificial tasting.  Don't skimp on the orange juice.

I'm surprised this has so many good reviews. For me it separated with the slushy milk part on top and the OJ on the bottom, I drank it right away so it didn't sit around or anything.  I tried stirring it but it didn't work out well, ended up not finishing it.

My kids, husband and I loved this recipe!  I like to add fresh strawberries.  To give an extra boost I add some unflavored protein powder that I got at a health food store.  Can't taste it and makes the smoothie perfect for those mornings when my teenage son is running late.

Really tasty, if really sweet! I left out the additional sugar because I figured it didn't need it, and I was right; the concentrated juice is already so sweet! I liked the milky vanilla flavor and the texture.

I made this and my husband loved it! The only change I made was the sugar. In place of the 1/3 c. of sugar, I used my equal packets (love my equal) only i 4got to do the equivalent to the sugar and put in 19 packets instead of 8! It was a little sweet for me, but otherwise it tasted really good. We will be making this smoothie again.

5 stars with the egg whites!!  A must addition to this tasty smoothie.  Also, instead of white sugar, I added a few drops of Stevia.  Kids love it and it is even extra healthy without any sugar.

I really like this as a quick breakfast drink,  instead of using bottled orange juice, i made it with fresh orange juice. I also added a little bit of heavy cream and It was great

It was very good, the only problem is I needed way more ice than the recipe said. Would make again :)

This was just okay on its own.  A little extra ice and some vanilla bean ice cream made it super yummy! Thanks.

This was really good.  I thought it was too sweet for a breakfast drink, but I'll definitely make it again this summer.  I'm going to try adding a small scoop of ice cream next time. :)

Great tasting smoothie.  I used only 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla because the first time I made it with the full amount it seemed like a little much.

This recipe/smoothie brightened up my school day!  The orange was a bit too stronge for me so I added a single banana to tone it down.  It's quick and easy just what I need on a busy day. =)

We could not finish these. The vanilla flavor was WAY too strong and we LIKE vanilla. I might try it again without any vanilla at all.

This is good. Next time I'll make it with skim milk (I bought 2% by mistake) & less sugar. It'll be a great low-cal substitute on those days when I have a taste for ice cream.

This is good...... but not great.  Maybe if it had more sugar in it.  Definitly not as good as Orange Julious

I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup  This is frothy, cool and refreshing.  A hit with my family!
