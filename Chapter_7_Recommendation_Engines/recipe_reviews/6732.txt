This recipes was delicious and I don't like pumpkin!  I made mini-loaves and baked it for 35mins. It made 8 loaves. It was so moist, it was almost cake-like. I highly recommend it.

I used the mini muffin tins and baked them for 16 minutes.  It's a great size for kids.  I tried using 1 1/2 cups of chips the second time I made them and I like it better.  Next time I plan to sift the dry ingredients together before adding them to the wet ingredients. Very yummy muffins!

Great recipe.  We made a few healthy changes.  We reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  We use 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup vegetable oil.  We use 2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup white four.  I use 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips.  Still taste great after these modifications.

This bread is awesome!  My husband doesn't even like pumpkin flavored stuff and he devoured it.  I substituted baby food prunes for all the oil (equal amounts) to cut the fat dramatically and it was still moist and delicious.  I'll definitely make it again.

I was worried about using such a large quantity of ingredients my first time trying a recipe...but as it turns out, it was worth it!  I substituted a grated zucchini for one egg, just because it was asking to be used, and it turned out very well.  I highly reccomend it!

This was surprisingly good!  Mine turned out moist and not too pumpkin-y, which is great.  I didn't have mini chocolate chips so I used the regular ones and they were just as fine.  I froze one loaf and will pull it out at holiday time!

I doubled this recipie because I wanted to have many mini-loafs to give away.  Did I ever!!  But everyone who tasted it loved it, and I ended up not giving 3 loaves away because we all ate them ourselves.  Delicious!

This was so good that a young guy at a Thanksgiving dinner to which I bought it said, "I would marry you just to have this every day!"  This was funny on two levels -- one because he assumed that, as his wife, I would be making this every day, and two because he is not a boy who is into girls!  So I figured, hey, I must've done SOMETHING right!

What I did was decrease the sugar to two cups (I think), add a teaspoon or so of vanilla extract, toss in an extra half cup of chocolate (I used small chunks, Whole Foods brand, rather than chips), a handful more walnuts, substituted 1/2 a cup of unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 a cup of oil, and used egg replacer instead of eggs.  I made three 8x5 loaves, which yielded perfect-sized treats for three separate outings.

I took this to another friend's house, and he gave me a big chunk to take home.  (I hadn't had any yet.)  I should have known myself better than to think it would ever SEE the inside of my apartment.  I ate the entire large chunk in the cab on the way home.  I couldn't contain myself.

Good stuff!  I was impressed that it actually came out well, given that I hadn't made a quickbread in about 20 years.  :-)

I have been making this recipe for years, as I first saw it in a Chicago newspaper food section back in the '70's. The only difference in the instructions is that I use 4 tsps pumpkin pie spice instead of the nutmeg and cinnamon; one half tsp baking powder; an entire large bag of regular size chocolate chips; and bake them in six mini aluminum loaf pans for one hour and 15 minutes exactly. They are superb and make great little gifts. Everyone who tries this flips and begs for the recipe. Even pumpkin haters love this bread.

A good way to not make the chocolate chips all go to the bottom is to mix them with a little flour

I revised the original recipe a bit because I have celiacs disese and it still turned out fantastic! I replaced the flour with gluten free all-purpose flour and used egg whites instead of the whole egg and nobody noticed a difference!   I definately recommend this recipe! Perfect for the holidays!

Usally I love everything chocolate, but to be honest I really was not fond of this chocolate/pumpkin combination.  The flavors just did not blend well together.  I followed the recipe exactly but at most could only make two good size loaves, to have split this 3 ways would have resulted in 3 very small loaves.  Glad I baked this, but I know its not something I will make again.  Certainly not a keeper for me!

I think this recipe has far too much cinnamon and nutmeg.  It overpowered the bread, and you couldn't even taste the pumpkin.  Out of three loaves, only half of one got eaten.  I think it's supposed to be a teaspoon of each, instead of a tablespoon.

This bread is SO GOOD! I work with a ton of 25-35 year old men and they devoured a loaf in no time! In an attempt to make it a little less of a guilty pleasure and more of a healthy one I subbed in apple sauce for the vegetable oil, egg beaters, swapped half of the white flour for wheat, and even used splenda. It turned out fantastic!

I made 1/2 of this recipe and cooked it in one 9"x5" loaf pan, and it turned out great!  I love the consistency & taste of this recipe.  I'll definitely make it again.

Decent chocolate chip pumkin bread.  I used egg beaters instead of eggs, half oil/half applesauce, used 1 cup wheat flour (instead of all white), cut the sugar by 1/2 c since I was using more chocolate chips and upped the mini chocolate chips to 1.5 cups (with no nuts).  I made 4 small loaves and 12 large muffins.  Baking time for the muffins was 28 minutes and 40 minutes for the small loaves. Texture is spot on for this type of bread.  One thing I'll do differently is to cut the nutmeg down by a half or a third because the taste is not balanced with the cinnamon unless you're a big nutmeg fan. The nutmeg overpowers the pumpkin with the full tablespoon.   Good recipe for new bakers - directions are clear and easy to follow for good results.  Thanks for sharing.

Yum! I used yogart in place of the oil and decreased the sugar to 2.5 cups, next time I make this I'm going to try using 2 cups. I made 2 loafs and 24 mini muffins (baked for 20 minutes).

This is amazing.  I have already made it three times.  I made loaves to give away, but my family gobbled them up before they were even cool.  DELICIOUS!  I don't use mini-choc chips.  I just used two small bags and about a cup of walnuts.  Wonderful and this will be a holiday staple for our family.

Way to much cinnamon & nutmeg. I should have realized this but I figured that the Allrecipe staff changed the amount of baking soda that they would have fixed this error also. would be delicious with a teaspoon of each not a tablespoon.

Excellent pumpkin bread. I made mini loaves as gifts for Christmas and everyone loved them. This was a great recipe. I omitted the walnuts because I don't like them and it was still fantastic.

Not a pumpkin fan but I really liked this.  Did 1/2c oil and 1/2c sweetened applesauce.  Sprayed everything with Baker's Joy and bread slipped out of the pans perfectly.  I was EXTREMELY stingy on the nutmeg and didn't miss it one bit.  Got 2 loaves and 6 muffins out of the recipe.  Will definitely make again.  Next time I'll add a splash of vanilla.

Excellent!  Wonderful flavor, very easy, and extra moist!  I made them into mini muffins (made approx. 60) and they were a huge hit at my office party.

I was skeptical about pumpkin and this really made me a believer! I made loaves to hand out as well as loaves for my family to eat over Thanksgiving, and I will most likely be making it again at Christmas. This was an excellent seasonal dessert with walnuts and lots of chocolate chips!

This bread was sooo good!  I sub in our girls' middle school and the elementary school.  I notice that many parents and kids bring treats to the elementary school teachers but not so much to the middle school teachers.  A few weeks ago, we had open house at the middle school and I decided to make a mini-loaf of this for all my girls' teachers - about 10 of them altogether.  The next week when I subbed again, ALL of them thanked me profusely and asked me for the recipe.  I just carried around copies of the recipe with me for 2 days!  My kids devoured the 2 loaves we kept for ourselves.  We will definitely make it again!

I LOVED this recipe!!! I did make a couple changes. Instead of 3 cups white sugar, I used half brown sugar and half white sugar. Also instead of water I used Vanilla soymilk. I also used Unbleached all purpose flour instead of the regular which isnt a huge difference.   I used part of the mixture to make a regular pumpkin loaf (sans chocolate for my husband) which came out WONDERFUL. I then used the rest (with chocolate) to make regular sized muffins for my daughter and myself. the muffins took about 22 minutes to bake and the loaf baked the regular hour.   I will DEFINITELY make this recipe again. :D Super scrummy!!!

We loved this.  I actually made mine in a bundt pan and still had enough for a loaf of this bread, too.  The bundt "cake" looked great to take to work and share.  I am not a huge nutmeg fan, so only added 1 teaspoon.  The flavor was there, but no overpowering.  My husband doesn't like pumpkin bread, but didn't have any trouble polishing off several slices.  Try taking a small bit of flour and dusting in with your chocolate chips before adding to your batter.  They will disperse throughout the bread and not fall to the bottom this way.

I have made this recipe as is, and it comes out great every time.  Family and friends request this for Christmas every year, it's so good.  In the interest of making it a little bit healthier, I have made it with half the sugar, and replace the oil with apple sauce.  It still comes out great that way too.

I used  white choc chips, and crushed almonds instead of walnuts, and I added 1/2 a tablespoon of cloves to the batter, and it is YUMMMMM!!  I think the white choc blends better than semi sweet ones would have.   We put the dough in 8.5 inch loaf pans, about 3/4 full. After cooking two like that, we only  had enough dough left to fill a pan halfway. The 1st two (since I only had 2 pans)  needed an extra 5 minutes in the oven.

Although an excellent recipe, I personally recommend adding:
1 tsp Ground Ginger
1/4tsp Ground Cloves
I also tried baking the batter as muffins, which turned out amazing. The muffin cups were half full and took about 27 minutes.  Enjoy!

I made this recipe for a class project and everyone loved it. The little blonde girl that sat next to me almost ate half the loaf! My little sister also loves it. Pumpkin bread is one of her all time favorites and the chocolate chips make this her absolute favorite snack!

I found this recipe several years ago and make it all throughout the fall and holiday season. Everyone LOVES it! As soon as the first cold snap comes through people start asking me when Im going to make it for them, and I end up making it several times before Christmas gets here.

This is good with coffee or tea.  Not a very sweet dessert, so its good in the morning too.  However, this bread can't compete with pies and cookies that are usually served at holiday dinners.

Wish I read the bad reviews on this before I bothered making this.  I figured since it had so many great reviews I didn't need to bother with the not so good ones.  I have learned a lesson.  This pumpkin bread recipe has WAY TOO MUCH nutmeg.  My family loves nutmeg and cinnamon but this was insanely too much.  You couldn't taste the pumpkin at all and the mix of spices just gave it a weird flavor.  This would be a great recipe if you only used 1 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.
I will definitely stick to my other recipe I got on allrecipes for pumpkin bread.  It has never failed me!  If you haven't tried Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread I highly suggest you do.  It is wonderful!

1st time it was excellent. But for the 2nd time I wanted to have less calories so I used 2 c. sugar 1 c. applesauce and only 3/4 c. oil. Tastes super. Also for half I omitted the choc chips and put them into a muffin pan and the rest in the loaf pan with fewer chips. Even without the choc this is an excellent  recipe. I'll be using it always

LOVE this bread. The combo of pumpkin and choc is awsome. My husband is not a pumpkin fan, but he eats this every morning with a cup ot tea when I make it. My kids love it too.

Wow! I made this recipe into mini muffins, baking about 16 minutes like an other reviewer suggested, and they are delicious!  I halved the oil and replaced it with applesauce/ carrot puree (1/2 cup of that combined, and 1/2 cup canola oil) to decrease the fat content.  It worked great, and the result is still a deliciously moist bread muffin!

SOOOO GOOD!!!! These were amazing! I made 3 dozen muffins instead of bread. I used whole wheat flour instead of while, !/2 brown and 1/2 reg sugar, applesauce instead of oil, added pumpkin pie spice and vanilla instead of all the nutmeg! The house smells amazing and I could make these once a week. I'm thinking of cutting back on the sugar a bit next time! YUMMY!!!

This batter is fantastic!  If you're a chocoholic, go ahead and add the chips, but they just kind of ruin the "Fall" flavor for me personally (my husband LOVED the chips).  Like always, I never measure out spices, I use a heaping tablespoon of Pumpkin Pie Spice in almost everything I bake! (I know that isn't the sign of a great baker, but it works for me  :) I am not one to replace ingredients, but I did substitute 1/2 the oil with applesauce and it was perfect!!!  I took one batch of batter and it made 12 mini muffins, 12 regular muffins and one 9x5 loaf.  Watch the cook time with the muffins...regular size need barely a 1/2 hour and I would check the minis after 20 min.  The loaf can take the full hour, but next time I'll cover it for the final 20 min to minimize the edges crisping up.  The aroma that fills the house is unbeatable and the bread bakes up with a perfect crack in the middle and a gorgeous brown color too. Certainly a keeper!

I've been making this recipe for 4 yrs now and they are always a big hit!!! I make about 5 batches every Holiday season.  This is hands down, the BEST pumpkin chocolate chip recipe!

I change the nutmeg amt by adding half tablespoon nutmeg and half tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice.  I keep what the recipe calls for and add a tablespoon of cinnamon.

I changed the amount of chocolate chips and add almost a full bag of mini-semi sweet chocolate chips! I use a muffin size mini-loaf pan and it makes about 36 large mini loaves.  I reserve 1/3 of the chips to top the loaves and then add the rest to the batter.  After spooning the batter in the pan, I top a generous amount of chips to the batter and then bake for 30mins. Because the chips are on the top of the loaves, you have to be careful and let them fully cool so the chips don't melt all over your hands.  The mini chips at the top of each mini loaf add a nice detail to these treats.

Although I love to add a lot of chocolate chips to this recipe...it is good without the chocolate too.  The spice of the bread is good on its own.

This was fantastic. I made it exactly like the recipe called for.The second time I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the nutmeg and kept everything else the same. It was even better. I made two large loaves and it took a little over an hour to complete baking.

I made this as mini-muffins. I made it 3 different ways: with chocolate chips & walnuts, with only chocolate chips, and with only walnuts. They were all good but the chocolate chips & walnuts was the favorite. The only thing I changed was I replaced 3/4 c. of oil with 3/4 c. of applesauce. I also replaced a cup of the white sugar with brown. I used 1 tbs. of pumkin pie spice in place of the nutmeg. The mini mufins baked for about 20 minutes.

Check after 50 minutes. Mine was done by then. I'll put this on my "must make for the holidays" list. It's so easy and delicious. A bonus was that my dairy-allergic friend could enjoy it too.

I made this recipe and put it in the freezer for my Once-a-Month cooking group--my family loved it and so did everyone else!  I will definitely be making mini loaves to go with teacher Christmas gifts!  Also, I used pecans (I think the recipe called for a different kind of nut) and it tasted great!

Too much nutmeg.  Moist but not really moist. Makes a lot

Next time: 
Use less nutmeg for sure! About 1/2 of what was asked.

This recipe made 92 mini muffins, which baked in 12 minutes at 350.  I used applesauce in place of the oil and reduced the sugar by half a cup.  These disappeared at my house - the kids RAVED about them.  I'll have to keep them handy!!

I made this recipe, but chose to make muffins. It made about 30 of them. I bake them at 350 for 25 min. I freeze the majority of them and then thaw them one-by-one overnight in the fridge to put in my son's lunch as a snack. There is sugar in them, but at least they're packed with Vit. A! Some of his 1st grade classmates asked him for the recipe!

All I can say is "AWESOME"!! I didn't have enough eggs so had to halve the recipe and baked it in a 8x8 baking pan. I didn't want to use all that oil, so I used 1 cup pumpkin puree and 1/4 cup canola oil. I accidently added 1/2 tsp. more cinnamon than called for, but turned out GREAT! Though I might use less nutmeg next time. I will definately make these again for sure! Thanks for the awesome recipe;)

Very good, very moist.  Recipe yields a large quantity and could easily be cut in half if you only want one loaf of bread.

I halved the recipe and didn't add walnuts; filled up a loaf pan and 6 muffin cups.  The muffins baked for around 25 minutes, and the loaf took about 45.  The result was INCREDIBLE and wowed my boyfriend, who is usually ambivalent about pumpkin.  Light in texture and flavor, in a great way - I didn't want a dense, overly rich bread.  I might cut the sugar down a bit next time.

This was fabulous! It seemed to bake FOREVER, and it never really got done, so I finally just took it out. The inside was a bit too squishy for us, but the edges were delicious -- I think I may have added too much pumpkin... be careful! Also, more chocolate chips in this recipe does not make it better -- it's already quite rich.

I just made this recipe tonight.  I had several cans of leftover pumpkin after the holidays.  I was intending to make a chocolate swirl cheesecake for Christmas, but didn't get time.  But I digress!  Gave this recipe a whirl tonight.  Even with a 15 month old hanging off my leg screaming, and a 3 year old trying to destroy my kitchen with the hand mixer, this was a very EASY recipe to whip together.  I did add more chocolate chips because I felt the recipe asked for only enough to tease.  I am woman!  I need chocolate!  Thus, 2 cups were necessary.  Also, I realized AFTER starting the recipe, that I was out of nutmeg.  I substituted Watkins Pumpkin Pie Spice, 2 tsp, in lieu of the cinnamon and nutmeg.  This recipe turned out GREAT!

I wish I had read past the most helpfuls to see what other people said about this bread.  I agree with a few of the other reviewers who wrote that this is TOO MUCH NUTMEG!!!  ;O(   No wonder so many other people said you could hardly taste the pumpkin.  You couldn't taste it at all. This bread should be called nutmeg sweet bread.  I've had pumpkin chocolate chip bread in the past that was enjoyable, but this is not it.  Too bad I lost my recipe -- I'll have to keep looking or make my own adjustments to this one.  Cut nutmeg in half.  Use 1 cup LESS  sugar- no reason to use that much sugar when you have sweetness from pumpkin, chocolate and cinnamon too.  I used whole wheat flour and it was still moist.  I had to give this batch away.  I like nutmeg, but this was overkill.

It takes alot to get 5 stars from my family, but this one did it.  I tried not to make too many substitutions up front because I wanted to know what the original recipe was supposed to taste like. That way I know how far from it I get when a make substitutions next time.  This time I used 3/4 cup oil 1/4 app sauce as others suggested, I used one fresh "pie pumpkin" boiled and mashed in place of canned, and I omitted the nuts only because I was out.  It did take longer than an hour to bake since it was so moist, maybe 10-15 min more.  I will try subbing part whole wheat pastry flour for some all-purp next time, because I want my family to get more fiber from our home baked breads.  I only made it as the recipe stated in order to give an accurate review.  Since the bread is so moist I don't think whole wheat flour will make it too dry, especially if you use pastry flour, and maybe increase the water a tad.  Thanks, Star for sharing such a great recipe.

I used the recipe with real pumpkin, after it was boiled and mashed.  It was ABOUT 15 oz.  I didn't use water, since the pumpkin was pretty moist.  I also used mini muffin tins and baked for about 10 minutes, and holy cow!  The whole family, which is not keen on pumpkin, or nutmeg spices LOVED it.  And it was with or without the choc chips!  I've got company today, so we'll dig into the cake, as the muffins are almost gone!
Wonderful recipe to use up that additional pumpkin puree!  Thank you!

I made it for Halloween and my family loved it!  It was flavorful and moist without being crumbly... which was great!  After greasing the pan, I sprinkled sugar on it to give the bread a sweet glaze after it was baked, it ended up being a nice touch.  Wonderful recipe!

A wonderful moist pumpking bread.  I have made it several times and satisfied each time.  However, I added more spices than listed - heaping teaspoons - and eliminated the nuts and the chocolate.  Was a great treat and breakfast bread.  I preferred the spices to the chocolate - made a great tea bread.

I wish I could give this 10 stars! The recipe is perfect as is, but I did modify it somewhat: I substituted 1 cup brown sugar for 1 cup white, and I added a pinch of ginger, along with a little more cinnamon. Also, instead of chocolate chips I added 1 1/2 cups of butterscotch chips. Yum! If you want a healthier option, you could substitute 1 cup applesauce for the 1 cup oil and grated zucchinis for about 2 of the eggs; you can also add whole wheat flour instead of white (I didn't do this part, so I'm not 100% sure how it would taste) and probably omit the chocolate chips, if desired. It is extra moist, very cake-like with great flavor. Don't be put off by the big batch- it'll be eaten quickly!

This recipe was great!! I did follow the instructions of reducing the baking soda from 2 tablespoons to 2 teaspoons. It is very easy and very delicious. I made this for work for a pre-Thanksgiving treat; 2 loaves for my work and 1 for my husband's... I wish I would have brought all 3 loaves to my work: 2 hours into the day, and it is all gone.. GREAT recipe!!

Added lemon and orange rind, as well as clove and allspice.
Topped with Cream Cheese icing (I could have just eaten the 
icing and been very happy) which really improved the overall taste.

All who ate it seemed to love it and it diappeared quickly at work.

I have made this recipe for several years now! Delicious just the way it is. But I don't use chocolate chips....I use butterscotch or caramel morsels instead. My kids beg me to make this as soon as fall hits and I can never make enough! Made 3 loaves this past weekend and pack them in their lunch for a sweet treat! LOVE THIS RECIPE!

Tasty.  Used chocolate chunks instead of mini chips and omitted the nuts.  Added a healthy scoop of chopped candied ginger.  Topped off each loaf with raw sugar.  Good stuff!

This recipe works well as muffins.  I made a couple of changes...substituted 1.5 cups of oatmeal in place of 1.5 cups of flour.  Used the "Pumpkin Pie Spice II" (doubled) in place of spices in this recipe. Omitted chocolate chips.  Baked about 25 minutes.

So good and everyone loves it!  Not too sweet, but the chocolate and pumpkin go very well together.  I halved the recipe but still used the full can of pumpkin.  Will definitely make again this season!

Soooo good!  I live for fall baking and this is my new go-to recipe to share with everyone I know!  I have baked several loaves already this year to send overseas to my husband and he and his crewmates RAVE about it and keep requesting more.  It keeps really well and freezes perfectly.  Sometimes, I have added pumpkin pie spice in lieu of the full amount of nutmeg and it has been really good.  Also, I've tried lowering the sugar to 2 1/2 cups and substituting half the oil for applesauce... just as delicious and the texture didn't change at all!  Thanks for a FANTASTIC recipe!

I made this exactly as written and it turned out beautifully.  The kids loved as well as everyone as who tried it, yum!  I only got 2 9x5 loaves out of the recipe but they were nice tall loaves.  Great recipe!

I just eyeballed the spices and used some apple sauce for the oil.  My daughter and my friend said it was extremely moist and delicious.  My daughter has asked that I make it again VERY soon, so that speaks volumes...

So delicious and moist.  I've made big loaves, mini loaves, normal muffins and mini muffins and all were superb.  I double the chocolate chips because I've never thought "gee, there are too many chocolate chips in here" about anything.  Also, I sub 1 cup of the white sugar with brown sugar.

AMAZING! I scaled it down to make just one loaf. Btw, if you're making one loaf, it comes out to 2/3 C pumpkin puree and one large egg, i used all other measurements as noted. Added 1/4 tsp of ground clove because i love pumpkin and clove!

This was similar to the other recipe I made today for Pumpkin Gingerbread. I added ginger, allspice, cloves, a little molasses and vanilla. I did half butterscotch and half chocolate chips as that was a winning combination the last time. I didn't want these to scorch like my last batch(because I overfilled the baking pans.....oops), so I was able to make two medium sized loaves and two mini. Smells wonderful. I won't be trying these for myself as they will be gifts for friends/family.

I followed the recipe as originally written and the bread turned out perfect!! it is sooo good. actually, i did make one change to cut half the fat out. For the 1 cup vegetable oil I did 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 vegetable oil. Still turned out super good!! This will be becoming a Holiday tradition.

Great recipe!!!! How ever I didn't put the full amount of sugar in. I really don't understand why we need to put so much of it in. These still taste GREAT with only 1 cup. I did as others have and used the small muffin tins baked them for 16 mins!!!! They turned out moist and tasting great. Thanks very much for a great recipe.

I wasn't overly impressed with this - it wasn't as moist as I'd like and IMO there was too much nutmeg and it covered the pumpkin flavor.  Something was missing in this and I'm not sure what it was but I won't be making it again.  

I made the recipe as written but made 12 muffins and 3 mini-loafs -they baked just fine - just were missing something in the taste.

This was so, so yummy.  My husband and I were so thrilled with the pumpkin bread, that we each took some to our coworkers and family for them to try!  Since I didn't use walnuts, I added extra chocolate chips, and I also doubled the cinnamon.  Yum!  

I made this recipe a second time and used only 2 and a half cups of sugar.  I still doubled the cinnamon, and it came out delicious!  This time, I used mini loaf pans.  They were done in 40 minutes.

I made no changes to the recipe- though I did bake it in 2 9x5s and 2 5x3s. We took the little ones to a football game and found that they were really convenient. I'm actually eating some right now for breakfast- it's so good! I was looking for a recipe that would duplicate a pumpkin chocolate chip bread from our local bakery. This isn't it- it's so much BETTER!! This is going to become a tradition for our family.

DELICIOUS!! I used a bundt pan instead and baked for about 20 min longer and it turned our great! Sprinkled a little extra cinnamon and also left out the nuts because my kids are allergic. Everyone loved it and I will definitely be making it again!

This really didn't taste as pumpkinish as I'd like. It had a VERY strong nutmeg flavor. The texture was good though and people who like a spicier bread might like it better.

YUMMY! I didn't think I would like pumpkin and chocolate chips together.  It really taste great. I think of it more as a cake than a bread.  My daughter likes to eat with cream cheese frosting.  Will definately make again.

TERRIFIC!!!  I followed the advice of others and used only 1/4th cup oil and 3/4ths cup unsweetened applesauce.  I also played around with the spices a bit... cinnamon (same quantity as the recipe calls for), nutmeg (only 1/2 Tbsp.), and clover (about 1/2 Tbsp.).  The biggest change I made to the recipe was cutting the amount of sugar in half (using only 1 1/2 cups of sugar).  I was very pleased with the outcome!  :)

I can't tell you how many times I've made this bread!  So yummy and easy!  I used 3/4 cup applesauce + 1/4 cup oil (instead of one cup oil) and it tastes even better!  I only got two loaves from the recipe.  This also makes great muffins.  Thanks!

RED ALERT: This recipe only makes two 9"x5" loaf pans, not three. That said, it was REALLY REALLY good! I used both semi and milk chocolate chips. They were the regular size ones and did sink a bit so I'd do the mini chips next time like the recipe called for. I also used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. And, as I said, it only made enough for two 9x5 loaf pans but they were huge, so I'd do three smaller ones next time or even the mini pans for gifts. I did one batch of regular size muffins which turned out great (I think they baked for about 25 minutes). But no matter what pan you put it in, this recipe is awesome!

I liked this bread, but the semi sweet chocolates are a bit too bitter for my taste, everything else was great---- oh and make sure it's a 15 ounce can not a 29 ounce...... oops

This recipe is fantastic!  Great for dessert or breakfast.  Great for travel, too.  
Really easy to mix, make and eat.  Try adding a pinch or two of ginger for a good flavor too!

My boyfriend buys pumpkin bread every morning at the coffee shop, so we decided to try making it at home. This is the best pumpkin bread I have ever tried. It was moist and chocolately and heavy (in a good way!) We ended up leaving it in the oven for about 10 extra minutes since we are cooking at high-altitude, and of course added extra chocolate chips. I have tried other pumpkin bread recipes since but this is hands down the best one. We won't be using any other recipe. Thank you!

I've made this twice and it is so delicious!!!  I have to say, I did alter the recipe a little - I used 2 1/2 C sugar, 1/4 C brown sugar and used 10oz of semi-sweet mini chocolate chips.  Wonderful!  I was able to make 12 full size muffins and 4 mini loaves of bread.

We loved it. I normally hate chocolate chips baked in things, but this was delicious. I made a normal size loaf, 12 muffins, and an 8 by 8 casserole dish because I didn't have enough loaf pans. Next time I am going to try a little applesauce in place of part of the oil.

Delicious! I reduced the sugar to about 2 1/4c. Doubled the mini choc.chips since I like alot of chips in my muffins. This recipe made 36+ reg.muffins and cooked in 20 mins. I like the intense flavor of the spices. Will make these again!

I tweaked this recipe by using 3 eggs instead of 4, cut the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup applesauce, I used 1 1/2 cups of semi sweet chocolate chips, reduced the sugar to 2 cups white and 1/2 cup light brown, and used allspice instead of nutmeg. The recipe resulted in 1 Bundt, 1 cake pan and 6 muffins. The texture was fluffy and cake like. It turned out very tasty in my opinion. I enjoyed this with coffee.

I really enjoyed this.  Subbed half brown sugar for the 3 cups.  Rather than 3 loaf pans, I put this all in a 9x13 cake pan and baked for about an hour and a half total, checking every 10 minutes after the initial hour for doneness.  I then poked holes in it and topped with an almond flavored powdered sugar glaze.  At first I thought it was too seasoned, but the next day-- my, oh my, was it good!  Very moist thanks to the oil and pumpkin.  Might try to sub apple sauce for some oil next time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious!
Going from past reviews, I added extra cinnamon, a tsp of vanilla and pumpkin pie spice. 
I also subbed the oil for applesauce.
Will definitely make again

I substituted whole wheat flour for a portion of the white flour and used butter instead of oil.  It turned out well.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Wonderful recipe for left over Thanksgiving dessert ingredients like pumpkin puree and chocolate chips!  I didn't have nuts so replaced them with chocolate chips.  That actually helped the recipe in my case because on its own the bread is not very sweet.  Overall the final product has a wonderful, pumpkin spice taste.  I will definitely make this again!

Awesome recipe! I didnt add nutmeg because I didnt have any. However even though the recipe already has the pumpkin puree I added half a tablespoon of pumpkin spice to substitute. Also I added white chocolate chips and semi sweet chocolate chips just to mix it up a little bit and it wasnt over the top on adding in items. Not to mention with this recipe I was able to make 24 muffins AND bread. The house smells amazing and my son absolutely loves it :)

Very easy, very delicious. I used a bag of regular size chocolate chips which worked out fine....and probably made these even more chocolatey. Nothing wrong with that!

I used 2c brown sugar and 1/2c white sugar, also 2/3c oil and 1/3c applesauce, and added a shredded zucchini. I'd reduce the nutmeg (2tsp) next time. Made 80 minimuffins.

LOVE THIS BREAD! I was not sure how I would feel about it since I was never a huge pumpkin fan- but the chocolate chips make it amazing!  If only I knew how to keep the chocolate chips from all sinking to the bottom of the pan!

This bread came out very moist and delicious, however we would have liked a more pronounced pumpkin flavor (we really like pumpkin). I believe that would be easily adjusted to anyones taste using more pumpkin and maybe some pumpkin pie spice. Great recipe!

Very good! Everyone seemed to like it.  One cup of oil seemed like a lot, so i used half a cup of oil, and half a cup of applesauce.  I often do this in bread and cake type recipes as it cuts down on some of the bad stuff, and adds moisture. That was the only change i made other than adding a few more choc. chips to complete the bag.  Will make this again!

This is an amazing pumpkin bread, moist and flavorful! Just make sure they are completely cool before taking them out of the pans, as they will stick if you don't.

Great recipe!  I made a 9 x 13 cake from this batter and had enough leftover to also make a loaf of bread for my friend.  Great recipe for the holidays that's a little different from the normal pumpkin bread.  I also left out the nuts.

Fantastic! I made them into 8 mini loafs and it all turned out moist and delicious. I'm mass producing them for all of my friends!

Thanks for the great recipe!

The  best pumpkin bread recipe on this site is Down East Maine Pumpkin Bread,imo. That's the one I save for the holiday baking. This recipe I wanted to make now to satisfy a craving for pumpkin bread. I am on a diet though so I had to modify. I used only 1 and a half cups of sugar and substituted 1 cup of applesauce for the oil. I used two whole eggs and two egg whites and added 1 and a half cups of whole wheat flour to 2 cups of white flour. I also added  1/2 tsp ground ginger to up the spiciness a bit.I read the chocolate chip bit wrong and 2 cups were in before I realised!They were the normal size ones too! I figured what the heck and still tossed in the walnuts. The bread was amazing! Very moist and delicious! I imagine the full fat version must be even yummier but I loved mine. It was chocolatey due to my error but I still tasted all the pumpkiny goodness.I also used 2 9" loaf tins because I don't own three and they turned out fine. I will make this one again.

This bread makes an excellent fall treat! At first I didn’t think there was enough batter for 3 loaves but I trusted the recipe and it turned out just fine. It is quite soft in the middle so I might let it bake a few extra minutes after testing the cake next time or maybe do muffins as others have tried.  Overall – delicious!

My dad and husband love this bread. A coworker bought a pumpkin chocolate chip bread at a fancy bakery and it was good but I thought I can make this and not spend 12 dollars a loaf. I found this recipe and it is much better than the bakery bread. I get rave reviews for this bread every time I make it. If they only knew how easy it is to make. Thank you for sharing this has been a staple in my holiday baking for about 10 years.

good, not very pumpkin-y. i used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips, which gave it a great taste. for me, this made two small loaves and 12 small muffins. the breads baked 45-50 mins and the muffins about 20 minutes (they were baked in a regular-size muffin tin but only filled the cups halfway).

I made this for a few neighbors around Thanksgiving.  I followed the comments, added half the sugar and used applesauce instead of oil.   Instead of small chocolate chips, I put the big ones in. Everyone really loved it and wanted the recipe.

Delicious- i think i would like it with or without chocolate chips. Very moist. I cut the nutmeg to 2 tsp, as suggested by many others, and added 1 tsp cloves. My husband kept asking for cream cheese frosting, because it's more cake-like than bread, but still tastes great. Made 3 loaves for me.

This recipe is delicious! I have a lot of diabetics in my family so during the holidays I experiement with recipes that are easy to manipulate. In my opinion, this recipe tastes better made the diabetic way!

Instead of sugar, supplement GRANULATED Splenda for COOKING AND BAKING (the kind of splenda you buy is VERY IMPORTANT)

Instead of 1 cup of vegetable oil, use 1/4 cup vegetable oil, 1/4 cup olive oil, and 1/4 cup more pumpkin. The extra pumpkin makes up for the moist quality of the bread.

Also, since splenda is obviously not as sweet as sugar, cut back on the nutmeg (unless your family would prefer a spicy bread). I only used a few dashes (probably even less than 1/2 teaspoon).

I love making this bread at this time of year.  It just fits the mood of Fall.  I've made this recipe several times, but this time I added 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil.  I added 1 cup of Splenda with 1 cup of sugar.  Everyone loved it and couldn't tell a difference, and my family is very persnickity about their food.  If they can't tell a difference, most people won't.

This was amazing!!! I subsituted 1 1/2 cups of all purpose flour with wheat flour and used white chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. I also didn't have nutmeg so I used all-spice instead. My house smelled amazing while they were baking. I made two 8x4 1/2 loaves and 24 mini muffins. This recipe is a definate keeper!!!

Awesome recipe! I only made half and it still made a loaf plus six cupcakes. I added more spices for our tastes and a little more pumpkin. Tastes even better the second day!

This was good, but I made some changes. I used only one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown, only 3/4 C oil, only 3 eggs, and whole wheat flour instead of white. It turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!

This is great for dessert or breakfast!  I always get lots of compliments and requests for this recipe.  I make a few minor changes.  I use the whole bag of chocolate (what can I say, I like chocolate), and I only use 2 cups of sugar and roughly 1/2 the amount of oil it calls for.  Although I've made it both ways and really enjoyed it, I just prefer to use less oil and sugar.  This recipe should come w/ a warning though b/c you'll eat both loaves WAY to fast!

I love this bread!  I make it every year for Thanksgiving.  I tried the coffee can for the first time this year and it didn't work out at all.  It never cooked fully and was weird looking.  I'll stick to a loaf pan.

Yummy.  I used 1 1/2 cups regular chocolate chips, substituted canola for vegetable oil and 1 cup brown sugar for white, decreased nutmeg to 2 tsp. and added 1/4 tsp. cloves. Oh, and I got 2 9x5 loaves from this recipe. This got rave reviews, and will be made again.  Thanks!

I used Splenda, Eggbeaters and 1/4 cup applesauce for part of the oil.  It turned out great - VERY moist and flavorful.  I made three loaves in 7x3 disposable pans and didn't have any trouble with them rising.  It was a bit strong on the nutmeg, but otherwise good.

I made 1 9x5 loaf and 18 muffins with this recipe.  I altered the spices.  I used 1 tbl pumpkin pie spice plus 1 tsp cinnamon.  It was a huge hit.  It is moist and has a nice flavor combo.

I made five mini-loaves and one 9x5 loaf.  The mini ones came out great -- wonderful taste and texture.  The regular one burned on the edges and was soupy in the center.  Four stars for taste -- might be better as muffins.  I'll certainly be trying it again that way.

This bread was great. I made the following changes: added 1/2 as much again pumpkin puree, replaced 3/4 of the oil with applesauce, added ginger and cloves, also added 1 cup flax meal to replace 1 cup flour, replaced 1/2 of sugar with splenda. These changes made a much healthier loaf. This bread was awesome. DELISH!! My 4 kids eat the whole recipe in one day!! I also baked as loaf and mini muffins. Kids love mini muffins!!

My fiance loved it - I gave these breads out as gifts over Thanksgiving. They didn't last long.  It was a hit.

I made three loaves of wonderful bread for the holidays...one for my co-worker, one for my mother, and one just for the family.  It was sweet with the chocolate chips but had that wonderful spicey pumpkin flavor...really moist.  I'll make this recipe again.

I will have to agree that 2 tablespoons is WAY TOO much baking soda, it even smells like baking soda! I had read the reviews about it, but I didn't adjust it, as I usually try to follow a recipe strictly the first time and then I will make changes as needed. But I wish I had followed the advice of previous posters, and I would be enjoying some delicious bread instead of looking at in my trashcan......

This was really yummy made as bread or muffins.  When I made the muffins I sprinkled a little bit of sugar on them to sweeten them up a bit.  My daughter didn't like these as much nor my husband, but everyone else did!  They are both really picky eaters.  Great Recipe, I'd recommend.

I made this for a candle party and all three loaves disappeared!! I made more for the guys at work. Very moist and easy to make. The chocolate is just enough to give you a fix without being overwhelming.

I love this bread (and so does my 2 year old!) I made a double batch and gave some away!  Every one wants this recipe.  VERY moist and does NOT have too much baking soda.  The people who complained either put too much batter in the pan or added too much baking soda.  My husband says this recipe is even better than his mom's!  This is a must try recipe!

We LOVE this bread!  I love the coffee can shape. Mine loaves cooked over the top, so next time I may add a bit less baking soda... It is wonderful that the recipe makes three loaves, awesome time saver.  If you are considering trying this recipe, you won't be dissapointed!  Thanks so much Star, this recipe is a keeper that I hope to pass on to friends and family.

This recipe was fantastic!  I was a little leary because of the chocolate chips mixed with the pumpkin, it seemed a little strange.  I made it very easily and everyone loved it!  I had to print out about 5 copies of this recipe because everyone that tried it loved it!  Even my son who is a very picky eater!  I am going to make this again today!  :o)

With a little adjustment this bread turned out delicious.  

On my first attempt, however, I used the 2 table spoons of baking soda for which the recipe calls.  The breads baked over the top of the pans, and the aftertaste of baking soda was clearly evident in the bread.  On attempt number two, I decreased to two teaspoons of baking soda, and the bread was not only edible, but my family scarfed it down.

LOVED it! I made it for gifts -- and had to try one first before giving it away.  Really good! I adjusted the sugar down 1/2 cup and substituted 1/2 c applesauce for half of the oil.  Making more today.....

This is very good.  I like that I can distinctly taste the pumpkin.  I added a teaspoon of baking powder and a splash of vanilla as suggested by one of the other reviews.

This is a great recipe! There are only two things I would change. I would absolutely substitute the oil with applesauce, maybe three parts applesauce and one part oil. The last thing I would change is the nutmeg. I am not a big fan of nutmeg and it does have a strong taste. The nutmeg was very overpowering so next time I will cut the nutmeg by one half or three quarters. :)

This is a wonderful recipe! I've made it twice. The first time it turned out great. I reduced the recipe to make two loaves. It was moist and had a nice texture and taste. The first time it also fell right out of the pan, it didn't stick at all. The second time I made it the texture and look of the bread changed. and it stuck to the pan. I'm not sure why because I followed the recipe just like the first time. The only thing I can think of is I used a different brand of oil and I added more chocolate chips. No walnuts! The taste the second time was okay but I didn't like the texture. It was more gooey, almost to moist. I'll make it again and see how it goes the third round.

I tried a similar, well-rated pumpkin bread recipe but prefer this one.  Great texture, not too sweet, and very flavorful.  Changes I made?  Nothing major.  I subbed half the oil with applesauce and chopped up semi-sweet and dark chocolate chips because I didn't have minis.  My boys liked it and are asking for more as I type.  I'm sure it will all be gone in 24 hrs.  This one goes into my recipe box!

Easy and Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and yielded phenomenol results! It was perfectly moist, not too sweet and the spices were perfection. It was so easy, but gave the impression that I had slaved all day to prepare it. I also liked that every ingredient I needed was right in my pantry. It made alot (there's only 2 of us) and it was still perfectly moist a week later. Thanks for the great recipe.

Everyone loved this bread. The only change I made was to substitute 1/2c of apple sauce and 1 banana for the oil. Makes a very moist bread and freezes well.

This recipe is outstanding. I bake it every fall. SO MOIST. The only changes I ever make are: 1. I use 2 cups of chocolate chips, and 2. Instead of coffee cans I use a 13 x 9 glass pan or 10-11 mini loaves to give to friends.

It makes a LOT of batter! I made some into muffins and one loaf. Really great flavor and texture. I might sprinkle some sugar on top next time. I think I'll have another muffin right now!

I've been making this recipe for the last several years and just love it! I don't change a thing. My whole family loves it including my picky twin boys.  I think the chocolate chips are a hit.  Great recipe!

Excellent bread! This quick bread was easy to make, moist, flavorful and will become a fall staple in my recipe box. I only added 1/2 cup more chocolate chips. No need to mess with this recipe. It's perfection.

We thought it was good but I made a few changes, I put the whole bag of chips in, I put 4tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnimon and nutmeg, I put two 1/4tsp of vanilla and 1/2tsp of baking powder in addition to all of the other stuff and the crowd I make it for loves it. There is none left! I would start checking for doneness at 40 to 45 minutes as any longer has left it slightly burned on the bottom, still very good but not perfect! Also note for me baking soda is 2 teaspoons not tablespoons.

This is the second time I have made this recipe. I love it! I do make a few changes though. I use about 20 oz. of pumkin, which lightens the flavor of the nutmeg and cinnamon. I also use dark chocolate morsels also about 20 oz. This is a big hit with my family and friends anytime of the year. I made this recipe gluten free by substituting the four for gluten free all pourpose and adding xantham gum, about 2 teaspoons. I love this recipe!!!!

Cut the recipe in half, and it came out great. More so like a cake. Used 1/2 Apple sauce and 1/2 veg. oil. Added more chocolate chips and a little more pumpkin. It was very moist and everyone liked it. Thanks for publishing.

Yummy and moist!  I took the advice of others and subbed applesauce for half the oil.  Will make these often.

Like everyone else who makes this, we loved it too.  It was easy, and it made three perfect loaves.  I was low on white sugar, so I used two cups white, one cup of brown sugar.  I subbed half of the oil with applesauce.  Turned out great, I'll keep this recipe around for sure.

I just had to try these when they cooled enough and they are great! I did 12 large muffins, which cooked perfect in 35 minutes. I did change things a bit since I don't have any oil. Instead I used 1/2c melted butter and 1/2c crab apple sauce (homemade). I also cut the sugar to 2c because my crabs and pumpkin are very sweet this year. I also used only 1tsp of cinnamon and added 1tsp of cardamom, for a little zing. I'll have to convince my son-in-law to try one because he doesn't like pumpkin, I think he'll like these though. :)

Perfect! I loved this recipe! I made a half loaf for for two of my friends and they shared with a few other people. Now 5 people are willing to buy it from me! This bread is perfectly moist, with just the right amount of chocolate chips! It's great!

These are amazing!!!  I used Stevia instead of sugar and sugar free chocolate chips.  I would use about a 1/2 cup less sugar so I could taste the pumpkin more next time.  They were a little sweet.

When I make this bread, I use the mini chocolate chips. They seem to blend in better that the regular sized chips. Great bread! Doesn't last long at our house.

DELICIOUS!  Now if only i would have added the eggs, oops.  I was very tired while making this and skipped the eggs on accident, but it turned out just great!  Next time i will try including ALL the ingredients ;)  I also like more chocolate flavor so i added extra choco. chips and then added a pinch ground cloves for more of a pumpkin pie taste... YUMMY!

Very good - it makes a lot of batter though - next time I think i'll cut it in half (since it's just me and my boyfriend eating!)...delicious straight out of the oven! From other reviews, I did use 2 C. white sugar, and 1 C. brown sugar -otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I made 24 mini muffins and three mini loaves. I haven't tried the loaves but the muffins are delicious!! I used 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce and I also substituted one cup of white sugar for 1 cup of brown sugar b/c I love the flavor. I think it would've been just as great either way, I was just trying to be a tiny bit healthier. I had no problems with the chocolate chips sinking. I baked the mini muffins for about 12 minutes and the loaves for about 55.

Before I forget, I wanted to write down that I scaled this recipe for 6 servings and made 6 muffins at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. I used 2.5 oz of pumpkin puree, regular semi-sweet chocolate chips, and used pecans because I was wrong about having walnuts. Very good taste. Makes me long for Autumn.

I was looking for a recipe to use up my canned pumpkin from last season.  This bread was fabulous!  It was moist and flavorful.  I would have never thought to put pumpkin and chocolate chips together.

The chocolate chips sink to the bottom, I'm not sure how to fix this. Otherwise, it was a nice recipe. The bread isn't too sweet. The chocolate chips are a nice balance.

I don't even like pumpkin but this was so good! It probably helped that I added an entire bag of semi sweet chocolate chips to this... love chocolate and pumpkin. =D

Pretty good, I did change a little, using egg whites and applesauce instead of reg eggs and oil.  Much lower cals.  I think it could have used more spices.

This yielded for me 2 dozen  small (slight rounded top) muffins and 1 8x4 loaf - great for sharing with family and friends. The pumpkin flavor is not strong which is probably why those who don't like pumpkin liked it. It is a light pumpkin spice flavor. I increased the regular chocolate chips to 1 and 1/2 cups, becuase the one cup did not look like enough to me, and it was good this way (may try mini chips in future). Also can't wait to try the coffee can baking method.

I made this pumpkin bread for the first time today and it is absolutely delicious.  I did tweak a few things to make it a little healthier and more to my taste preferences.  I replaced 1/2 the oil with unsweetened applesauce, reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 cups, used only 1 tsp. of nutmeg and added 1 tsp. of cloves.  I used regular size chocolate chips and tossed them in flour to prevent them from falling to the bottom, as someone else had advised.  Everything turned out great.  This recipe is a keeper!

I've made this twice now and made no changes to the recipe. It was a huge hit with everyone who tried it (especially my 4 year old sister!). I love it and ate half a loaf in one sitting. My only complaint is that I'm sure it is super fattening, but it's meant to be a treat, not a meal, so that's okay :)

Fantastic!  I started this and realized I didn't have enough nutmeg so I subbed the spices up a bit.  I used 1 Tbsp. pumpkin pie spice, 2 tsp. cinnamon, and 1 tsp. nutmeg.  I used loaf pans and got 1 large loaf and 2 smaller loaves.  It is delicous!  We had it while still a bit warm after dinner and everyone loved it.

Delicious!  I made the recipe exactly as stated and it came out perfectly.  I had one large loaf and 24 muffins.  Next time I might try modifying the recipe to make it a little healthier, but otherwise, it's great.

Amazing!  This has become a family staple over the last few years.  I sub applesauce for half the oil to make it lower fat.  Don't be tempted to use regular-sized chocolate chips.  They sink to the bottom of the bread while baking!

Sooooo delicious!  The only change I made (accidentally) was to use regular sized chocolate chips instead of the minis.  I made muffins from this batter, and they were wonderful.  We had them Christmas morning.

This is a very good recipe!  I got 12 large muffins and one loaf.  It's very moist and not overly sweet considering all the sugar that goes into it!  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and nutmeg and I used milk (sneak it in whenever I can get the chance) instead of water.  I will make this again for sure. THX

My family really likes this. I have made this twice and they always disappear quick.  I used 2 cups fresh pumpkin instead of canned and reduced the water to 1/3 cup.  I also used egg beaters and 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup canola oil. I make muffins instead of bread because my family tends to eat muffins more than a loaf of bread.  This made 6 big muffins, 12 regular muffins, and 24 mini muffins.  Will make again and again.

I receive rave reviews and requests for this recipe every time I make it!  I have found it is better if I use about 1/4 c less flour than the recipe calls for and I do not add the nuts. I also use a 1/4 c more chocolate chips than the recipe calls for.  I use the regular size chip instead of the miniatures too. Great Recipe!!

This is DELICIOUS!  Reminds me of pumpkin muffins they used to sell at Harry's Farmers Market in Atlanta.  Be warned that it is VERY spicy!  I cut down on the nutmeg and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  For some reason, I was only able to make 2 loaves of the bread and had just a tiny bit left for one small round dish to bake.  I would definitely use the nuts and next time I will use regular sized chips.  Great recipe!

Very good, not too sweet, just right. I added more than a cup of chocolate chips and actually made it into muffins instead of a bread.

This recipe was an instant success for morning classes and disappeared instantly!  A little more chocolate chips and pumpkin and this made an excelent replacement for the usual donuts and such.

This was very yummy! Although, I think it had a bit too much nutmeg. Next time I think I will cut it down to one tablespoon.

Very tasty.  I made a burnt butter frosting and poured it over top of the loaves and it was quite yummy.  I used  walnuts and a small amount of raisins.

I baked this recipe for this past Thanksgiving and my whole family loved it!! I added about a 1/4 to 1/2 a cup more pumpkin puree for extra flavor and it turned out fantastic. When i came home from work, they only left me one piece! Definitely will make this a tradition every year, thanks!

Extremely quick and simple... not to mention delicious. Though I did give it a 4 rating simply because it was missing the 'wow' factor for us. But this will definitely made in our house again, and again, and again! Oh, forgot to mention that I made these into muffins and it took about 20 - 24 minutes.

I made this bread yesterday and added a whole bag of dark chocolate chips instead of the mini chips.  I also added about 1/2 cup of finely chopped walnuts.  It yielded 8 mini-loaves and a square pan.  I took the square loaf and drizzled chocolate (melted dark chocolate mixed with whipping cream) on top of the bread in a diagonal pattern.  I then dusted with powdered sugar.  Everyone at work loved it.  I will be making more of this!!

This recipe is a keeper!! A friend of mine said, "This is so good, it's scandalous!" Seriously that good!

The first time I made it, I substituted the pumpkin puree for pumpkin pie puree and didn't use the cinnamon or nutmeg.  It turns out just as good! 

Second time I made it like the recipe, though for the sugar I followed the advice and did 1 cup brown sugar, 2 cups white sugar.  I also added in a teaspoon of vanilla and reduced the nutmeg to 1 teaspoon.

Yields one loaf and 12 muffins! :D

Enjoy!! :)

If I could give this more stars I would!!! I only made 2 little changes...I cut back on the nutmeg, and instead of 3 cups white sugar, I used 2 cups white, 1 cup light brown sugar. This bread was so moist and yummy. I made three loaves for Thanksgiving and it was gone in the blink of an eye. I have already been asked to triple the recipe for the Christmas holidays!! Thanks for a new family favorite!!!

YUmmy! There's a lot of batter-I made one loaf and 12 muffins. I love chocolate so I added some extra chips and I just used regular semi-sweet chips not the mini. Very popular with my friends.

Sooooo good!! I didn't put walnuts in and added another handful of mini chocolate chips - came out very moist and delicious!!  Also, because I couldn't find 9x5 pans, I just used the disposable ones from the market that come in 3, they are like 8x4 but they fit, I just bake for about 6 mins longer.

This is awesome! It is light and soft. I used 1.5 cups of white sugar, 1 cup of brown sugar and 1.5 cups of chocolate chip. I only used 1 tspn of nutmeg. I baked mini muffins, muffins and a loaf.

I made this pumpkin bread for my son who said the local market had great pumpkin chocolate chip bread.  He said this was even better!  I made 2 large loaves and they didn't last long. It was very moist and delicious.  Great recipe!

This is heaven.  We did everything as noted, except we used 13 one oz squares of semi-sweet baking chocoloate that we chopped instead of the one cup of chocolate chips.  Will probably use even more (maybe 15 one oz squares) next time.

WOW, this is wonderful. I didn't have any loaf pans so I baked it as two cakes, 1 9" X 13" and 1 8" X 8". It turned out so moist & tasty. I served it with some vanilla ice cream. I think I just found my new favorite recipe.

I made this recipe for my family and they fell in love! First of all the aroma in left throughout my whole house was to die for! The recipe calls for 3 cups sugar; I used 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown and it still turned out verry good. I added chocolate chips and walnuts which resulted in a luscious loaf!!

I ran across this recipe by chance.  I needed to bake something to take to a function and I didn't make it to the store.  My choice of baking ingredients was at an all-time low.  I really didn't expect great things from this recipe -- it really didn't sound enticing to me, but I had all of the ingredients on hand.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I thought they were pretty good (not exceptional), but all of the kids who tasted these went nuts.  Go figure!  That's why I'm giving this a 5-star rating.  They wolfed them down in record time and were fighting over the last few.  I didn't have mini-chips so I used regular size and they worked fine.  I also made mini-muffins because I was in a time crunch.  I baked each batch for 15 minutes and ended up with about 8 dozen minis.  While I won't be craving these anytime soon, I'm sure the kids will be asking for these again.

I found this recipe here about 2 1/2 years ago & have been making it every Thanksgiving & Christmas since.  I love the recipe just the way it is...all the nutmeg and everything.  I've always gotten 3 loaves & I've found the baking time listed as fairly accurrate. I have made it before substituting 1/2 of the oil w/ applesauce & it is equally as moist & delicious.  I have children ranging from 8 to 2 years old, and they all love it, too.

Loved!  I will try next time without the nutmeg though, as I am not a huge fan of nutmeg.  So maybe I would love it even more  without the nutmeg.

This was pretty tasty, although I think next time I will substitute some of the oil for applesauce, and maybe 1/2 of the nutmeg with pumpkin pie spice, as others suggested.  I love pumkin and missed that flavor.  I'll also add more walnuts next time.

Amazing. With the pans I used, the recipe made 3 and a half loaves, but by the 3rd day, they were all gone! I did cut down on the nutmeg, but I'm not sure how much I used. I also let it sit a day and it became dense and moist, just like we like it. Freezes well, too!

Fabulous bread, just make sure you check the quantity it makes.  I decided to make cupcakes with the batter and boy did I get a lot!

This was a nice recipe to get the fall-pumpkin flavor without resorting to the usual recipes.  I made both a loaf of the bread and a pan of cupcakes with the batter, and then frosted them with a home made cream cheese frosting from this site.  It turned out well and everyone liked it.  I used half oil, half applesauce to try and cut down on the fat, but I think I wouldn't do that again if serving it to guests.  It wasn't dry, but it could have been moister, if you know what I mean.

wow i loved this! It's sweet with just the right ammount of spice. I disagree with some of the other reviewers about the nutmeg. I took it to work and everyone loved it. I made it in muffin form so the cooking only took about 16 minutes. it's the perfect fall treat!

Delicious!!  Great consistency!  I only made 1/3 of the recipe and it made a 8.5 x 4.5 loaf pan size bread.  I bet 1/2 of the recipe would have filled the pan a little more.  It cooked in exactly 60 minutes.

great recipe!  i altered the recipe by replacing 3/4 cup of the oil w 3/4 cup of applesauce, thus, using only a 1/4 cup of oil.  i also doubled the chocolate chips and walnuts.  thanks for the recipe...it's a keeper!

I really was dubious about trying this recipe out.  I mean, whoever thought chocolate chips and pumpkin together would be so awesome!    I did cut the nutmeg back to 2 tsps as one reviewer suggested.  Turned out perfect!!!This goes in my favorite recipes box and will be made many, many more times over the coming years.  Thanks Star!!!

I have always had bad luck with breads- this is the first one I've had success with!!  Turned out PERFECT.  I made one loaf of bread, 18 muffins, and then spread the remaining batter in an 8 by 8 pan and baked it for 20 mins, and called it pumpkin brownies.  Thank you for a wonderful and extremely versatile recipe!!

Loved the chocolate mixed with the pumpkin.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and unsweetened applesauce instead of oil.  Kept everything else the same.  I decided to make muffins so I could freeze them and have them on hand.  Thanks Star

This was pretty good.  Instead of using three loaf pans, I put all the batter into my 9x13 stoneware baker.  Of course this changed the time a bit and I needed to cook it an extra 15 minutes or so, but it sure was convenient.  I used regular chocolate chips instead of minis, but I think minis might be better, they wouldn't give you such a "hit" of chocolate, you would just have chocolate "samplings" instead.  :)

These were wonderful! I ran low on white sugar so used 2 cups white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar. Also didn't have nuts so used 1 1/2 cups of mini chocolate chips. I baked them in mini-muffin tins (sprayed with Pam). Baked at 350 for 15 minutes and they were perfect! It makes about 7 dozen mini-muffins.

We love this, including my most picky 9 year old son.  He's asking for this instead of a birthday cake.  I line the walnuts down the center of the loaves after about 20 minutes in the oven.  It looks beautiful, and for those who do not like nuts, easy to avoid them.  Great anytime of the day, a yummy comfort food.

WONDERFUL!!  Very moist and yummy...!!  I only got 2 loaves (9 x 5) out of it as well, but they're hearty ones...  Maybe a touch too much nutmeg for my taste; I think next time (and there WILL be one!!) I will cut the amount in half and add cloves, too...

I had a friend begging for this recipe the day after I took her a loaf. She and her daughter ate practically the whole thing for dinner! It's really easy- great gifts for "occassional" friends at Christmas!

With a few modifications, this bread was very good. To increase fiber, I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat pastry flour (minus two tablespoons).  For 18 servings (recipe halved), I used a cup of pumpkin, added 1/2 tsp of allspice, toasted the nuts for enhanced flavor, and while still warm, I coated top with a mixture of 1 TB melted butter and sugar with 1/4 tsp cinnamon.

This is fantastic.  Now I know why the recipe makes three loaves.  I only made one the first time and it was gone in less than 1/2 hour.  It is so moist and rich. We really enjoyed it and I will be making them as Christmas gifts this year.

When I first made this on 10/4/00, the recipe called for 2 TBS. of baking soda, and there was a terrible aftertaste. I tried again at a later date with 1 1/2 - 2 tsps., and it was much better. I omitted the nutmeg and replaced it with a mixture of ginger, cloves, and allspice. Also left out the walnuts. Co-workers' verdicts? Pretty good pumpkin bread! NOTE: When I make this at home, I use a ground flaxseed/water mixture in place of the 4 eggs. OR, 2 TBS. water (or any other liquid) in place of each egg will also work. Happy Baking!

Great recipe!  My family was looking for a recipe to  make as Thanksgiving gifts and this is the one we liked the best.  We made several batches in different loaf sizes. Everyone loved it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

My whole family including my 2 year old loved this.  So moist and flavorful.  I substituted pumpkin pie spice for the other spices called for.  I also cooked it in 2 round cake pans as I don't have 3 loaf pans, and it took about the same amount of time to cook.  I'll definitely make this again.

This is the best bread I've ever had! My boyfriend asked for pumpkin bread and as soon as I found this recipe and read the reviews I had a feeling he would love it. Needless to say this will be a staple in our household!

I made this recipe a few years back, and every year since.  In fact, I created my Allrecipes account just so that I don't have to go searching for it on the internets every year, lol.  Everyone who tastes it, LOVES it, and my son-in-law specifically asks if I'll make him his own batch every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It's delicious and perfect the way it is written (though I don't measure how many chocolate chips I put in, because I always add extra to anything requiring them.)  From my whole family, thank you so much for this recipe!!  =)

Only reason I give it 4 stars is it takes longer than an hour in the over ... at least 1 1/4 hours. Otherwise, awesome recipe and total crowd pleaser for whoever is lucky enough to get some!

Fresh pumpkin - I made this with Fresh Pumpkin and it came out absolutely amazing!  I omitted the extra water because it seemed the fresh pumpkin had enough water. I also added a little lemon juice because I didn’t see any acid in the recipe to adequately trigger the baking soda.

Absolutely delicious! I made this for my freshman students to celebrate the last day of class  and everyone seemed to enjoy it. Maybe they're just starving freshmen! 

I cooked them for only about 40 minutes (the one without nuts went 5 more than the two with), so you might want to check the bread early to avoid overcooking. 

I for one like spices combined with chocolate, so don't be afraid to use the full tablespoon of nutmeg and cinnamon unless you already know you don't like it. I didn't find the spice overpowering like some of the negative reviews. The only change I'll make next time is to use 1/2 applesauce for the oil and reduce the sugar some to make it a little more healthy.

Boyfriend said it taste good but even fallowing the directions about greasing and flouring my pans the bottoms still sticked and part of the bottom came off. I was very upset about that and can't figure out why it did that. My pans are even nonstick pans never had that problem.

None of that orange and white  on top.   

3/4 cup of flour
3/4 cup of brown sugar
1/2 stick butter (softened)
3/4 cup chopped pecans 

Mix together and nuke it for about 35 seconds.  
  Crumble together and sprinkle on top of batter in pans.  
I use I reg size loaf pan and 5 small loaf pans.  Great gifts. Taste great and your house will smell amazing

Everyone is raving about this pumpkin bread in my family.  They love it with the chocolate chips, which is so different!  I did add the optional walnuts in the recipe which made it even better.  The bread is so moist and delicious.  I have made this recipe as is three times now.  I love how it makes three breads.

This is my second time making this. I used fresh pumpkins that I roasted and pureed in my food processor. I think it gives a deeper layer of flavor.

I wanted to make it a little bit healthier and I reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cup, oil to 1/3 cup, and chocolate chip to 1/2 cup and loved it.

I made this with gluten free baking mix (King Arthur brand) instead of the flour, baking powder, and salt.  My Dad recently was diagnosed gluten intolerant,  so this is for him.  It mixed up nice and smooth.  I will update with his verdict. (I also substituted caramel chips for chocolate chips.)

This is a new family favorite!  We all agreed that I had to submit a review because we LOVE it!!  The boys both thanked me when I picked them up from school because I had put a piece in their lunch today.  

I made this recipe as-is.  I had a little trouble getting it completely cooked in the center of the top and may cut down just a bit on the oil next time.  We love the mini choc chips - it's just the right amount of chocolate with the pumpkin.

Thank you, thank you, thank you for submitting this recipe!

my hunny loves these. instead of using 1Tbsp clove I use 1tsp 5spice and 1tsp pumpkin spice. it isn't so harsh as the cove but still keeps the pumpkin flavor ontop. I also omitted the chocolate and walnuts.

this is a nice recipe because its pretty simple. I made muffins instead of a loaf,  but I thought it kind of tasted like it came from a box instead of made fresh.  But they were good enough. it made 36 muffins with an icecream scoop for the measure.

I only used 1 teaspoon of salt for my second batch. I felt it was too salty.

Love this chocolate chip pumpkin bread!!! I make a few tweaks to the recipe.  I use applesauce instead of oil, only put in 1.5 cups sugar (the apple sauce adds sweetness), a bit less nutmeg and 1.5 cups of chocolate chips.  Turns out great every time.

Simple easy to make pumpkin bread. The recipe is perfect as is. I made this recipe twice. Once as is and the second time I made it a little more healthier by using a mixture of wheat and white flour, half cup apple sauce/half cup oil, and one less cup of sugar. It came out well. I will definitely make this again.

I'm not a fan of nuts, so I left those out.  I also cooked them in a mini muffin pan, which takes a fraction of the time (15-20 minutes) and makes them bite size! They were delicious!

This recipe is not only easy, moist, but amazing!   The texture is smooth and not too heavy.   I used the average sized 
semi-chocolate chips and it really made a difference on the richness of the chocolate.   Thank you for this recipe!

I made slight adjustment.  This is a really, really liquidy batter.  SO I reduced the amount of oil.  Also since I was making this for someone with a soy allergy(vegetable oil has soy), I used olive oil.  And I only used 3/4 cup to reduce the amount of liquid.  The oil change gave it a richer flavor.  I also added a tsp. of vanilla and a 1/2 tsp. ground ginger. I made mini muffins and in a bread loaves.  I like the muffins best because the outside of the loaves got a bit darker than desired in order to get center cooked.

I followed someone elses suggestion to use apple sauce, less oil and sugar, and whole wheat flour.  Next time I will use a bit less nutmeg, but otherwise they turned out amazing. I made muffins instead and my toddlers love them!

It is truly moist! My little ones liked it. 
There is way too much nutmeg in it though! As I put in the recommended tablespoon I worried it would be too much, and I was right. Nutmeg is a very strong spice.

I made this recipe but adapted it so that I made two loaves. one was definitely bigger than the first but not to the point that it made a mess by spilling over. Also, I replaced the last of the white sugar with 1/4 cup of brown sugar  and it turned out really well!

turned out real moist . good flavor. followed recipe, read the option from staff too late about baking soda  it could use a little less I agree, but not terribly noticeable. I added "raisins" with the chocolate chips.

Got rave reviews for this amateur baker- big hit! Pumpkin doesn’t overpower the flavor. Used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil to cut fat and 1 tsp of nutmeg per other reviews. You’ll want to bake this just for the smell- it’s amazing!

Delicious!  Only change I would make (other than using regular-size chips) is I wish I had tossed  the chocolate chips in flour to keep them from sinking before folding them in.  I got 7 mini loaves from this recipe.

I bake these as mini muffins (350° for 12 minutes) then freeze them. I send them to school with my son each day, (enough to share with a friend) and also take them to friends houses for gathering. They're always well received and great to have on hand.
I've tried other recipes but I won't stray again. They are that good.

I followed directions to a T.  I love quick breads, but I was so unhappy with this one.  For me the nutmeg just dominated the whole loaf.  It seemed to smothered everything else including the chocolate. Boo hoo I love chocolate in so many things. Hate to be a downer, but moving on to something my taste buds like better.  If you love nutmeg you most likely will find this to die for.

This recipe is for 3 loaves.. We approach life with a minimulist view so I broke it down to just one loaf... I did make a few changes. I added vanilla 2 cap full- cooked it for 50 min (this might be an oven issue)-mixed the chocolate chips w/ a wee bit of flour so they would float throughout the recipe. I did put two full eggs in. Moist is a good thing. Cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and four to 1 cup- Used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice (it's what I had) .. Bread was quiet amazing... Big winner here at our place! Definitely a go to recipe..... TY

I liked this recipe as written but for my personal taste I would reduce the nutmeg (seems odd to have equal parts cinnamon and nutmeg) and add clove and ginger.  I like mine to taste more like a "Pumpkin Pie Bread" so to speak.  Great with a cup of coffee nonetheless.

Love this recipe.  We make it every Christmas for our family.  I do modify it slightly and it Rocks!  We add 3 overripe mashed bananas and 1/2 cup extra flour.  I also double the salt (I swear it's not too much).  Truly awesome!!

Pumpkin, banana, chocolate chip bread.  Nom Nom

This is exactly the same recipe as the much-reviewed Down Home Maine recipe except for the difference in spices.  It came out very good (using the Down Home spices).   I used two 8.5 x 4.5 loaf pans and made six muffins.   Muffins took about 35 minutes, and I left the 2 loaf pans in for about another 20 minutes.

Not the healthiest of recipes but so yummy! I couldn't stop eating it. I only had two smaller loaf pans (not sure which size) so I used those and made the rest of the batter into muffins, only cooking those 30 minutes. A great recipe to make a larger amount and freeze what you don't need at the time.

I tweak the recipe a bit by adding 2 cups of semi sweet chocolate chips, 1 cup of oatmeal, 2 cups of chopped walnuts and lastly 1 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. These simple additions made these bread even better. My kids loved!!!

I tweeked a few things. I used pumpkin pie spice instead 2 tablespoons of it and a dash of cinnamon and vanilla. I also sprinkled dark brown sugar on the top before putting in the oven. When the bread was done i spread a pat of non-dairy butter on the top. The bread was moist and soft. It does take 45 mins to an hour for them to finish baking completely.  All the negative reviewers i say this ...  its a recipe , make it your own.  I will be making this again.

I always double the seasonings but after multiple (and I mean multiple) iterations, I no longer double the nutmeg. I find it leaves a grit in an otherwise moist flavourful loaf that always brings compliments. Tastes like fall.

If I tell my family and friends it has pumpkin in it they won't eat it so I didn't tell them until they gobbled it all up.  The only change I made is I used white chocolate chips instead.  It is a family favorite now.

Loved it simple to make. I also cut the  sugar to 2 cups and the oil to 1/2 cup added 1/2 cup applesauce to make it healthier. Husband ate a half loaf the night I made it. Was hoping to freeze 2 loafs not sure that is going to happen.

This was pretty good - I made many of the modifications suggested by other reviewers, e.g. did half applesauce, half oil, reduced the sugar by 3/4 cup, and used a cup of whole wheat flour instead of all white.  The only additional change I'd suggest is reducing the amount of nutmeg from 1 TBS to 1/2 TBS - it was just too strong. Otherwise, our family loved this - baked for 50 min as we like a really moist cake - and will freeze in the extra loaf.

Fantasitc! I made it for a club meeting after school and everyone loved it! Most kids in the group have a huge sweet tooth so I added some extra chocolate chip and they ate every single loaf.

I have made this recipe twice now and all 3 loaves are gone before I can freeze it! I have a house full of people who claim to NOT like pumpkin and they were surprised when I told them it was pumpkin.

Great recipie! I did make a few changes though. I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. I also used 1/2 tbs nutmeg and 1/2 tbs allspice. I also skipped the nuts and used coconut instead. I also used white chips instead of chocolate chips. AWSOME! It was gone in no time!

Inspiration for the Fall season! Especially with being a mailable gift in coffee containers!
I greased with pasteurized butter and heavily floured which created an aesthetically pleasing stratification on the outside when presented bare/ from tin foil.
I also went for a heaping cup of miniature semisweet chocolate chips;)...delish and look forward to refining to the liking!

I have this same recipe, it is great. This one, though, says to use 2 tsp of soda. Mine calls for 1. Love it, I make it for gifts. It's  called Christmas loaf.

I was so happy to be able to get my oldest to love this as he is sooo picky!  He had no idea there was pumpkin in it of course,I substituted apple sauce for all the oil, xylitol for all the sugar, and he had no clue.  I made it for a snack last night and he requested it for breakfast this morning.   Thank you so much for a great recipe that kids don't know is good for them!

This was fabulous -- but I like others, changed my recipe... partially on purpose, partially on accident.  I prefer to use butter in my baking, so I went ahead and melted a cup of butter and used that instead of vegetable oil.  I then accidentally used baking power instead of baking soda.  Whoops!  By the time I realized my mistakes, I'd already poured my batter into 8 mini cake pans, so it was too late to at least up the baking powder to compensate for the mistake.  I thought they'd come out flat, but they were delightful!  Slightly dense, but still nice, soft and very tasty.  Mmm mmm...

I loved it! I have been a fan of pumpkin chocolate chip bread/muffins for a long time and have never tried making it myself before this recipe! What a great way to bring in fall! So moist with a slightly hard outside- my husband loved that it wasn't all moist... That there was some crunch to the outside of the loaves. I'm sure if you wanted it to be soft on the outside, just cover them with cloths while they cool and it will retain some of its moisture!

I made this twice. the second time I used pumpkin pie spice instead of what the recipe calls for. The flavor was so much more balanced and is the best ever! I also baked in small, disposable bread tins. I think this allows for a more evenly distributed baked loaf.

I just made this recipe for the 1st time yesterday.  It is truly delicious.  The bread is nice & moist.  My husband and I both really like it.  I'm glad it makes 3 loaves - we have 1 out and I put the other 2 in the freezer for the upcoming holiday.  Per other reviewers, next time I may add more chocolate chips and chopped walnuts.  Thanks for a great easy recipe.

Delicious, even my picky children loved it! I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts (by error), milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet,  added 3/4 teaspoons of ground cloves and about 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract. Could have used another 1/2 cup of nuts! Too many chocolate chips in my opinion but still wonderful tasting.

It was OK, but the pumpkin overwhelmed and clashed with the chocolate.  I love chocolate, but this bread would have tasted better without it.

This was awesome, has a great taste and is super moist. I did modify it to what one reviewer said to shave some extra calories around the holidays.  I used 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup vegetable oil.

I am a huge chocolate fan and thought this would be really good.  However, I think it would have been better w/o the chocolate chips.  I feel that they deminshed the pumpkin the pumpkin flavor.

This was my first attempt ever at making home made bread, and it came out AWESOME! My whole family loved it, even the ones that aren't crazy about pumpkin! I substituted white chocolate chips instead of regular and made my own glaze out of equal parts honey and low-sodium whipped butter. I will definitely make this again!

Love this!!  Instead of using a full cup of oil, I only use 1/2 cup of oil plus 1/2 cup of applesauce.  You honestly cannot tell the difference, as I have made it both ways.  I like how it makes 3 breads--I often wrap them with ribbon and give them as gifts.  (you can freeze them and have them ready as a hostess gift)  I also use regular-sized chocolate chips.  I think the small ones get lost in the bread a bit.  I like the chunkier bites of chocolate.

Followed the recipe.  Baked in cupcake/muffin tins.  Took around 25 minutes.  Baked in mini-loaf pans.  Took around 35 minutes.  I live in high altitude, so your results will vary.  Great all-around sweet treat.

Nice and easy recipe!  I got 64 mini muffins and two 3-inch square loaves out of one batch.  I subbed applesauce for 3/4 of the oil, with no loss of flavor or moisty goodness.  Increased the walnuts and chocolate chips by a bit, to suit my tastes.  This one's a keeper!

This has become very popular with my family. My husband brought it to work and everyone wanted the recipie. I have made a few changes. I do not use nutmeg instead I use pumkin spice. I also use milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet in order to get the chocolate to melt a little bit while cooking! Very tasty treat!!

Delicous!!!!! I made three loafs! One didn't have chocolate and was still so tasty! The 2 others had chocolate but I think next time I use baking chocolate as chocolate chips tend to shrivel up.

I've been using this recipes that last couple of years in the fall and around the holidays. I absolutely love this bread as do those I have shared it with! It is very moist and delicious. I use white chips instead of the semisweet and have used others' advice on the spices. So yummy!

I made this for a Holloween treat for people in my office. I didn't change a thing and everyone loved it. Some co-workers didn't even wait to get home to eat it! I'll make this time and time again! I think maybe next time I'll make it with fresh cooked pumpkin instead of the can to see how it comes out.

This turned out awesome and so moist - everyone who tried it loved and I got several requests for the recipe.  The only change I made was substituting 1/2 of the oil with unsweetened apple sauce and I used regular chips instead of mini.  Will definitely be making this again!

I made this recipe, and didn't know at the beginning how much it would make-we fed our WHOLE family! To give as gifts, I put them in clear big baggies and tied them with pretty ribbon. We love the yummy addition that the chocolate chips add to this bread. YUM-O!

Awesome!  Very moist and as other reviewers have said it isn't real pumpkiny so if people don't like pumpkin they still will like this - my husband does not like pumpkin at all but at 2 muffins in about 5 minutes

I substituted apple sauce for half of the oil and it came out great!  Next time I am going to leave out all of the oil in place of applesauce.  I also used dark chocolate chips.

Loved this! Made into muffins, couldn't find my loaf pan. My husband thought it needed cream cheese icing, so I made up some for him, but I thought fine without the icing. I had been craving pumpkin, and this hit the spot.

This bread is exceptionally good! I use 1 tbsp cinnamon, 1 tbsp cloves and 1 tbsp of Chinese five spice. I come from a very spice loving family and this is always a hit! If you are not accustomed to heavy heavy spice, then stick with the original recipe, it's just as good.

My 3-year-old daughter and I had a blast making this recipe.  I only had two bread pans, so we made four jumbo muffins with the remaining batter, baking them for 20 minutes at 350.  They turned out great!  Very tasty!!

This is fantastic!  I made a few alterations to the recipe... I don't like chocolate chips in bread, so I omitted them.  I made one loaf with just walnuts (yum) one with raisins and walnuts (double yum) and the third with raisins, walnuts, a pinch of ground ginger and a dash of vanilla extract (triple yum).

This bread is so good! Both my boys even eat it and they are picky eaters. I made the calculations to serve 8 and it didn't make that much bread, to fill one loaf pan it would have to be serve 16 to make it a fuller loaf. I will be recommending this to my friends.

This is a wonderful recipe. I love how it stayed moist for the length of its time, which was about 5 days. It has a great texture and flavor. I never thought about making pumpkin bread, but now its a new family tradition. Wonderful!!! It is something you can make that is not the ordinary type bread. Something the people I work with love to smell when I am walking in the door with a loaf or two.
Thanks for a great recipe....

After reading all of the great reviews I made this bread and thought it was o.k. Though a 15 oz. can of pumpkin didn't seem like much for as much dough as the recipe made. After making this recipe I received a pumpkin bread recipe from my sis-in-law that I liked much better.

When I made this recipe for the first time my boyfriend ate all three loaves within a week. Its now a standard for us. We take a good sized slice as a snack to work, it really helps to hold off the 'end of the day dinner is almost  here' hunger. Its a delicious bread all around.

I am eating this right now and it is sweet, moist, and delicious!  (Even though I only had a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg left.  Adding a tiny bit of extra cinnamon isn't the same, but it's not bad.)  For a two-loaf recipe I used a whole cup of chocolate chips instead of the 1/3 cup called for.  Yummy.

I LOVED this!! (And so did my boss you kept stealing bites of the slices i brought into work.)It stayed fresh and moist for days which is good since it makes 3 loaves. :) I took the advice of others and didn't add as much nutmeg... but I didn't measure the nutmeg out either so I'm not too sure how much I added. My tummy and many others are so happy you posted this recipe!

I made this over Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  The bread has nice level of spice to it and was more spicy than sweet.  The chocolate chips added little bursts of sweetness.  I somehow still felt that the recipe was missing something though.

I halved this recipe and left out the walnuts. I used it in a pan...definitely didn't take an hour, more like 45 minutes. I got distracted and it was burnt on top! (took it out at one hour exactly) Maybe it was my oven. Good taste, will try it again but not as moist as I had hoped for...likely due to over cooking. Next time I will watch it closer and maybe put foil in the top towards the end to avoid blackened top...

Very good, very moist.  My family loved it!  Onlygot one bad review as my DIL did not like the chips with the pumpkin.  I just prefer bannana bread over pumpkin.  But this a great recipe and good for the thanksgiving season.

Really really moist...although I didn't give it 5 stars, because it was waaayyyy too much nutmeg for me...but i think that was my fault, because I used pumpkin pie puree with the spices added AND added nutmeg on top of it. I think I will make it again and either use regular plain pumpkin, or not use the nutmeg. My boyfriend/2 yr old love this as it is though!

I enjoyed this recipe! It is moist, delicious, and easy to make but it needed a little boost. I, too, made some changes to this recipe. 
I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1 tsp ground ginger and changed the 1 Tbsp nutmeg to 1 tsp. I also used 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown instead of 3 white. I added 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips, per other review suggestions, but I think it is too much and takes away from the pumpkin flavor. 
I may also add a simple cream cheese frosting on top for extra flavor and texture. 
I did not add the walnuts. 
The recipe yielded four mini loaves and one 9"x5" loaf. But could possibly yield 3 9"x5" loaves as well.

Excellent!  I actually thought it was better without the chocolate chips, it lets you appreciate the texture better.  Was also great 2 days later.

This is out of this world!!! I have been craving pumpkin chocolate chip bread for some time now, after I tried some at our local old-fashioned coffee-house. But, as many people have said before about this recipe, it is so much better!!! I used only 2 1/2 cups of sugar (a mix of white and non-refined organic) and instead of nutmeg and cinnamon, I used 1 1/2 table spoons of pumpkin pie spice. The more chocolate the better, ditto  about walnuts. I threw an extra hadfuls of each in there. It turned  out just sweet enough, with balanced flavor, perfectly moist...  DELICIOUS!!!

This is an excellent recipe! I substitute whole wheat and soy flours for about 1/2 of the flour, and use applesauce, flax seed, and oil for the oil. I use about 1 tsp (I think tbsp is a typo!) of nutmeg and extra chips, like others. Mini muffins: 15 mins, muffins: 20-22 mins.

This recipe was awesome!  Very moist.  I took it too a party and it was a hit.  The only thing I changed was I doubled the amount of chocolate chips (I'm a choloholic).  This made the bread really gooy, but delicious!!! Definately going to make it again!

After reading many of the other reviews I decided to follow the recipe as it is written.  I agree that the 1 Tbsp of nutmeg is overwhelming.  I made 32 cupcakes and decided to add a cream cheese frosting to cut the pungency of the nutmeg.  I made them for my husband's nursing class and thought that it needed it to suit the tastes of a crowd.  We'll see how they go over... they do taste quite good!

My family really liked this bread.  I did only put about 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg in since I'm not a huge fan of it and it was the perfect amount.  I cooked it in a 9x13 baking dish for about an hour and a half and it turned out perfect. I'll be making this one again!

This is a surprisingly delicious bread.  I'm often asked for the recipe or to make some and bring it over by friends.

I have made better, but it still tasted great.  One thing I will do differently next time is use half the nutmeg.  It is a little too spicy tasting.  Also, bake for only about 50-55 minutes instead of an hour.  But overall, great recipe!

Great fall recipe and very tasty with coffee. Use care as this makes THREE loaves - that caught me off gaurd. However, took one loaf to work and it got rave reviews! The chocolate and pumpkin worked well together, an unexpected surprise! :)

Very good, but not as pumpkin-y as I was hoping.
I didn't have loaf pans, so I made muffins. I baked them for 23 minutes.
Also, I didn't have nutmeg, so I added some ground cloves instead.
Very delicious...

Awesome awesome recipe!  I have been making this for the past two years at the holidays and people actually ask me to make it!  It freezes beautifully, I make mini-loaves and pull them out for a great breakfast or for when company stops by.  Definite 5 star recipe!

This recipe is great!  I make it every fall and bring to family parties.  We travel with 30-45 people for vacation every April, and it is requested that I bring that for the trip.  It is a hit exactly the way it is!  Well, I am off to bake!

This is great pumpkin bread. I used regular chocolate chips and used the whole bag - my family likes the more chocolate taste.

This was great!  I must say, I was skeptical about the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg (1 Tbl. each!), but the flavor was wonderful. I would never have made this, but I had a request to add chocolate to my holiday pumpkin bread.  I found this recipe almost identical to my pumpkin bread recipe, except for the addition of chocolate chips (and more cinnamon and nutmeg), so I decided to try it.  It was a hit!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was fun to make and yielded a lot of batter. It took a little longer to cook because it was so moist, but well worth it! I will make this again. A great recipe to use for those extra cans of pumpkin in the cupboard!

good texture, but I think it needs a bit more umph.  Maybe a 1/2 cup more sugar and a tsp. cinnamon.

I made these as muffins and they were great.  I used 2 cups of regular chocolate chips instead of 1 cup of mini chips.  I also used half brown sugar and half white.
This recipe also works well with raisins instead of chocolate chips.

Okay, I made this recipe again and mistakenly bought canned squash. And guess what? It still tastes wonderful using the squash!!

Took this to a Halloween office party and it was a big hit.  I did not use chocolate chips in all of the recipe and it was just as good, if not better.  Two people asked for this recipe and I shared it with them.  Did not use the coffee can, because I did not have one and it turned out fine.  Great stuff.  Very pumpkiny!

I doubled the chocolate chips (2 cups instead of 1).  The combination of chocolate and pumpkin is unsual, but tasty.  This recipe is good for people with unconventional palates.

WOW!! This is fantastic! It reminds me of the chocolate chip pumpkin bread my aunt used to make when I was little. My botfriend loved it too!! Came out great and I will definately be making this again. I think I will add more cinnamon next time.

this is one of my favorite recipes ever! i ate the whole thing myself because it was so yummy. i substituted all of the oil for extra pumpkin and only used one tbsp of light margarine. I only used egg whites, 
and substituted the 3/4 white sugar for 
3/4 brown sugar and 3/4 splenda.
it was very healthy this way and so so yummy, tastes sort of like vegan cakes, very moist.

I thought this bread was very good.  I love the combination of pumpkin and chocolate.  In fact, I think it could have used more chocolate, and next time I make this, I will use regular chocolate chips instead of the minis.  I gave this away for Christmas presents, and I didn't change the recipe a bit.  I WILL say that I didn't get many compliments on the bread...I think it might not be a mainstream taste.  Oh well!!!

This recipe is scrumptuous! For the pumpkin and chocolate lovers. I've made it in three smaller bread pans and as mini muffins and prefer the bread. It's very moist and full of flavor. I did cook the bread about an hour and 15 minutes in order to firm it enough. Have made it several times and it's a definite crowd pleaser.

I just made this and it is awesome.  I did use only 3/4 cup of oil and added 4/1 cup of apple sauce.  It came out just perfect.  I used about same amount of Kabocha squash instead of a can of pumpkin because I love the flavor of the Kabocha squash.  Thank you for the recipe.  I am going to add to my cooking list for the holidays this year.

Overall very good recipe, but I docked this by a star because the cooking time and loaf size seemed really off.  It only filled one loaf pan rather than three, and I baked it for more than 90 minutes and some of the inside was still a little bit gooey.  However, even my fried who is a professional caterer loved the recipe.  It's great for having company for coffee in the fall.  Very moist, makes the house smell great, and delicious flavor.  

I would recommend using smaller loaf pans than called for, using convection bake if you have it, and making sure you allow a generous time cushion for the loaf to bake before your company comes over!

Loved it!  I made this recipe exactly, except that I used three 8 x 4 loaf pans.  It naturally took longer than one hour to cook - about 1 hr and 10 minutes or so.  Next time I'll try to make the low fat version as others have done.  Thanks for the recipe!

So good! The only possible downfall is that the chocolate chips overwhelm the pumpkin flavor, so if you want a pumpkiny-pumpkin bread, this may not be the recipe for you. But if you are of the camp that believes that chocolate makes anything better, then you'll love this stuff.

I was looking for moist and delicious and this definitely was it! Everybody liked it. I didn't even add the chocolate chips. I'm sure it's even more yummier with the chips added.

Delicious!  I'm going to make some more later this week to bring up to the cottage for Canadian Thanksgiving weekend with my family  :)

Give it all the time it needs to cook, otherwise it'll have gross mushy insides  (I messed up my first loaf).

Amazing! Loved it. I made it as recipe states except 3 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and nutmeg and it was awesome. Sent some to work with my husband and they raved. I also tried a second batch with egg substitute, Splenda and a wheat/white flour mix (2 cups whole wheat/1 1/2 cups white), and applesauce instead of oil for a try at healthy variety. The healthy one was very tasty but did not rise as much so will need some work. But original is Delicious! thanks Star!

Wow! Perfect as is, but will try it substituting at least half the sugar for Splenda.  I made three small loaves (in the foil pans) to freeze two.  They freeze/thaw beautifully.

My kids and husband love this recipe. I cleaned out my pantry and found all these extra cans of pumpkin. What a delicious way to use them up.

I halfed the recipe because I only wanted one loaf.  It turned out great -- very moist.  Thanks for the recipe:)

Great recipe even without the chocolate chips. In addition to the nutmeg and cinniman, I added cloves.

This was SO GOOD!  Very moist.  I used 2 pans instead of 3, so I had 2 bigger loafs, and they took a little bit longer to cook, about 10-15 mins longer.  I also added another 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, which i think made it a bit yummier, and omited the nuts. It's good fresh out of the oven--but if you wait a day it's even better!  It's great to make a couple batches to give as gifts or to bring along for a holiday potluck party.  I hope my other loaf lasts long enough to make it to the party!  The one i kept for myself is almost gone!

WONDERFUL recipe! Very easy, very moist and tastes wonderful. I'm making this bread for my colleagues as Christmas gifts this year. I also added walnuts to the batter.

This was really good, really moist.  I ended up putting vanilla frosting on the top because I had an open container of it.  It isn't necessary, but I would definitely recommend it.
