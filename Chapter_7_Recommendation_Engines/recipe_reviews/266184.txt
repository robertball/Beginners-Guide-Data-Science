A few days ago I made another recipe very similar to this one, using cream cheese instead of heavy cream. I much preferred the other recipe since I found this one to have a different texture. Not gritty but not smooth either. This one rose like a souffle and then after about 10 minutes the center caved in. Thanks for sharing the recipe but I don't believe I will make this again.

Ok I added a half bar of cream cheese to this before baking. It is amazing! Seriously sooo good. I also added some extra cinnamon to flavor it up a notch. Add some home made cinnamon whipped cream when serving
