These are incredible!  I doctored them a bit because I don't have Old Bay seasoning.  I threw in some chives, cumin, celery salt, basil, a tiny bit of thyme, cumin, and a smidge of chili pepper. Added an extra egg because they didn't have enough body.  I baked them, then broiled them for the last 5 min. so that they'd be a little crispier on the outside. Threw together a tartar sauce with diced pickles, olive oil mayo, and a little hot sauce.  So good!  Am sending this recipe to a few of my friends!

Just made these for an appetizer for tonight's dinner...YUMMY! These are so good and easy, especially since everything is already in your fridge or cabinet! I followed the recipe exactly as written - the only thing I changed was to bake these instead of frying. Bake at 425 for 12 min., turning crab cakes halfway through cooking time. My whole family agreed these were as good as and possibly even better than served at restaurants. Chock full of crabmeat and very little filler. I would recommend using the Old Bay seasoning...gives the crab cakes that extra kick!Excellent! I posted a picture for the recipe.

I halved this recipe to use some crab left over from another dish. I also broiled them. I thought the recipe was a bit “fluid” but after broiling (on high, 5 minutes each side) they did firm up. I also found it a bit spicy which masked the flavor of the crab. Made 3 generously-sized crab cakes. I’ll keep searching for the perfect crab cake recipe.

Wonderful! The only thing I added was some sauteed onions. Will definitely make these again.

very good. Some times crab cakes get dense and dry but these cakes came out perfect.

If you are going to go to the trouble of making crab cakes PLEASE DON'T use canned flaked crab meat. That has as much resemblance to real crab meat as canned tuna has to fresh sushi grade tuna. Get fresh LUMP crab meat. If you need to make more than 4-6 crab cakes you can stretch the lump meat by adding a can of "backfin" or "special" to the lump. Saltine crackers are good to add, but 16 to a pound of crab meat is waaay too much. You aren't making saltine cakes, 4 or 5 at the most. The "seafood seasoning" should be Old Bay, don't use an imitation it's not worth it.

Awesome recipe.  It got raves from the family.  My 80 year old mother who loves crab cakes said it was the best she had ever eaten.  I did add an extra egg and doubled the recipe.  Will definitely use next time.

Great easy recipe with lots of crab meat and uses on hand ingredients! We didn't have any saltines so we substituted bread crumbs and it was delicious!

Perfectly proportioned recipe! Cakes were all crab and no obvious filler. The changes that I made, I will stick with when I make these again: I used Panko instead of Saltines, Lemon Juice instead of Water, Dijon as the mustard, added one thinly sliced scallion, and most importantly I broiled them instead of frying in oil. Broiled on High 6 min, flipped and 4 min. They turned out perfectly cooked through and nicely browned. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good, very easy. I didn't have any trouble getting them to stay together when I fried them.

If you make this, use an extra egg or something to hold the crab cakes together!  These are a pain to make. Mine fell apart, so then I took what ingredients was left and did my best forming them into balls (which is tough) and baked them in the oven. They came out and everyone loved the taste, but frying these in a pan with oil does not work if you want to keep them together.

Wow! I followed the recipe exactly as written! Holy wow, are these good. To those who said they fell apart, I found the bigger ones fell apart and the smaller ones stayed formed. Will totally be making this on a regular basis.

I made this recipe with lump crab meat. They were delicious and will rival some of the best 4-5 star restaurants.

Wow!  That's salty! I used 1T of Old Bay and saltines.  Next time, I'll cut back on the Old Bay or use breadcrumbs instead of saltines.

I made this a few days after New Years Eve with leftover fresh King Crab we had steamed for NYE dinner.  This recipe was light and refreshing.  I will never make crab cakes from packaged crab again.  The four crab cakes stayed together beautifully and were delicious.

Made these twice

First time I followed the recipe, except for the seafood seasoning.  I didn't have seafood seasoning so I put in a small amount of fish seasoning instead.  The fish seasoning gave the cakes an odd flavour.  Second time around I skipped the seafood seasoning all together and the cakes were delightful

Wow! Delicious   Family wanted more and so easy to make. We used fresh cooked Dungeness crab in as big chunks as we could keep. Used only 12 butter crackers as that's what we had in the cupboard. Sorry I didn't get a picture as they looked perfect.

Very good although I'm not sure how you get 16 cakes out of this.  Great crab ratio and the seasoning was tasty as well.

These weren't bad done by the recipe but I think next time I'll use bread crumbs instead of saltines and probably add some sauteed onion for flavor and texture.
