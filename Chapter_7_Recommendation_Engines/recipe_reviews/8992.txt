~Wow~ this was so easy and delicious! I doubled the sauce and added ginger and a little extra brown sugar. I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs because that is what I had on hand.  (I reduced the cooking time to 30 minutes.) Chicken was so tender and the sauce was very flavorful.  My husband LOVED it and there were no leftovers!  A definite keeper.  Thanks for the great idea.

Loved this recipe!  I used chunked pineapple instead of crushed and served on fried, wild rice.  I used bone in chicken breast and the fried skin was yummy with the sauce. I also cut the green pepper and onions into half inch chunks instead of thin sliced.  Next I will try it with boneless pork chops.  Also very easy to prepare.

The suggestions to add ginger were right on, we also doubled the sauce and added water chestnuts.  It was fabulous!  Next time we'll use boneless chicken, either breasts or thighs would work well.  Love the sauce!

I tried this for Valentine's dinner... my girlfriend and I really enjoyed it.  I was running late and didn't add the chicken stock/cornstarch.  It still turned out great.  Very easy.  I used pineapple chunks instead of crushed... looks a little nicer.  Thank you!

We're more of a "chicken breast" family so this was really different for us.  I have never cut up a whole chicken and spent a lot of time restling with it.   I thought the sauce was definitely missing something,  maybe ginger?  I doubled everything but the chicken so we'd have penty of sauce which was exactly enough for the 4 of us.  Everyone liked it especially my 2-year-old who had 4 servings (loves pineapple!).  I served with brown rice on the side.

Not bad, but didn't wow me either.  I tripled sauce ingredients, used one can of tidbits, one can of crushed, two cups of peppers/onions, 1/4t ginger (right amount for kids btw) with four boneless, skinless breast halves.  Needed more soy.  A decent base recipe I guess.  Quite pineapply, but not too sweet.

I was dissapointed because the chicken was very salty.  I will try this recipe again without the salt and see how it works out because the sauce was great.  I will double the sauce next time too because there wasn't quite enough.

This recipe was great.  Our family prefers lower-fat dinners so I used boneless skinless chicken breast.  I also added extra soy sauce and threw in some maple syrup.  It was delicious over rice.  Thanks for the recipe  :)

This is a great recipe! I have made it several times and my family loves itl. I made it exactly the first time, it was 4 stars good. I added fresh grated ginger root and some crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce. I also added cayenne pepper to the flour mix, we like it with a kick. These changes make it a 5 star recipe for my taste buds.

Very good except it was WAY too salty.  Definately cut back on the salt.  Also, I doubled the sauce and it still didn't leave much to put over our rice.  Might triple it next time.

Excellent.  This is to tastey and good.  I made lots of extra sauce and served on brown rice and cooked carrots.  My boyfriend said his mom's recipe has nothing on this one.   p.s. I think would work great with pork to.

Love love this dish. The chicken was so moist and tender. The sauce was soooo delcious. I used 12 chicken thighs with skin and add salt and pepper directly on the meat and dipped in the flour. To increase the sauce I tripled the ingredients and added an 1 extra can of pineapple with juice. If you still need the sauce to thicken more you can always add the cornstarch with broth mixture later if you find it's not thick enough. Will definitely make this dish again.

Very tasty dish!
I recommend tripling the sauce, I doubled it and we didn't have nearly enough.  I was also scared to put the soy sauce in due to other reviewer's comments that it was too salty - not the case at all!!

This was very good. Nice change from every day "meat and potatoes".  I did add 1 TBS of Ginger and about 1/2 TBS of Red pepper Flakes to "KICK IT UP a notch" It was very tasty.  I doubled the sauce because my hsbnd wanted it for his rice.  He couldnt get enough! 
Thanks

This was wonderful! I think it made the perfect sweet and sour sauce, I couldn't have asked for better. I did somethings differently. I used a red bell (made the dish look so pretty and sweeter), just cooked the chicken in the skillet with some parsley and spices without the batter coating to cut down on calories. I also think a hint of red pepper flakes would make this dish! So great, thanks for putting it up. Oh p.s. side this with Grilled Hawaiians (like grilled cheese sandwiches with a twist) if you don't want rice and to finish off the left over pineapple.

Loved it!   My only fault was it was a bit lacking in sauce, but that can be solved by doubling the sauce part of the recipe. Also next time I will add marachino cherries. All and all, it was good.

As others have said, definitely double the sauce. I also doubled the flour mixture, and still ran out. No need to increase the vegetable oil, though. Definitely a keeper.

Didn't have enough flavor.  Cooked for longer than recommended trying to get the flavors to meld together and it still didn't work.  Better ways to make chicken in the future.

I really enjoyed this, I had no cooking oil on hand so I used stir-fry oil instead, which just has sesame, garlic and ginger. Next time I will use only half the soy sauce, though, to cut down on the saltiness. I used chunks of pineapple and crushed them myself. I also used twice the flour and pepper for more texture. Juicest chicken I've ever made!!

To sum it up: Buy bottled sweet and sour sauce and save yourself the work.  The chicken was too salty, but that could have been because I reduced the recipe and used chicken breasts instead.  Still, the sauce was not nearly enough, so I ended up tripling the ingredients.  I will not make this again.

This was okay.  Hubby wasn't a huge fan of it so it probably won't be added to the rotation.

i would give this a 5 star but i didn't follow the recipe. i'm giving the 4 stars for the sauce. i've made this several times and every time instead of cutting up a whole chicken, i slice up chicken breasts into large chicken strips, sprinkle them with salt and pepper, coat them in flour, egg wash then panko (japanese bread crumbs) and pan fry them in vegetable oil. i then remove them from the pan and stirfry the onion in the same pan (i don't normally add green pepper) and make the sauce according to the recipe. then i add the chicken strips back and cover and cook for another couple of minutes to heat through. Still a bit crispy. Absolutely delicious!

I made this recipe last night for dinner, and it was a bit hit. My husband suggested next time using boneless chicken (but dosent like having bones in anything he eats) I would say to at least double if not triple the sauce as others suggested. I used thighs instead of the whole chiken, and did not have enough of the flour mixture to coat the chicken in but I assume that is because I hade more pieces. I only added a sprinkle of salf, as I was worried about the other comments about it being too salty and didnt have any issue at all. It was a GREAT recipe and I will be making it again witout a doubt. Thanks so much!

Overall very good.  Didn't look great, but tasted good.  Will use again, but probably won't be a "family favorite".

Didn't bother frying chicken.  Just baked breasts directly in oven.  Added carrots and celery to the sauce.  Whole family ate their portion!

The sauce is really good. I did not bake the chicken after fry it and it wasn't necessary. I added the chicken to the sauce and leave it cooking till it got thick. aprox 5 min. Oh and instead of 2 tsp of soy sauce I used 2 tablespoons. It was a good mistake since it ended really good.

When I added extra flour/salt/pepper to coat the rest of the chicken, it made it to salty.

I tried this recipe and fond it very good. Honest report, I used chicken tenders and saute them till done, then set aside and proceeded from there. Did add broccoli and baby corns. Even my I hate sweet stuff adult son liked it.

Delicious!!  Simple and easy with a lovely look and taste.  Will cook this for company.  I followed suggestion to double the sauce and used chicken breast pieces and pineapple tidbits instead of crushed.  Otherwise followed recipe as written and was very impressed.  No leftovers here tonight!

I ended up doing the same tweak as many other reviewers.  I tasted the sauce and it was very pineapple-y, so I added fresh minced ginger and garlic too.  I also doubled the sauce.  Came out quite tasty!  Others mentioned too salty, so instead of measuring salt, I just sprinkled some over the chicken (used bone-in thighs).  And instead of shaking in a bag, I sprinkled the S&P right on the meat, then spooned a little flour over the thighs and rubbed it to evenly coat-just easier for me.  Served over jasmine rice with peas and pineapple.  Hubby and I really enjoyed this!

This recipe was amazing!  The way the chicken was prepared reminded me of sweet and sour chicken.  I added 1 tsp of ginger and used Canola oil instead of Vegetable oil.  I also only used half of the salt it called for since soy sauce is going into it.  I served it over rice cooked with chicken broth instead of water.  Next time, I'll take the rice one step further to fried rice.  Fantastic!

I follwed the recipe exactly except added a tiny bit of ginger, and used chicken breasts.  At first it was okay. Nice and sweet, but had a weird texture.  The more I ate of it, the worse I felt.  Then after eating almost half a plate of this, I couldn't eat it anymore.  My husband asked me to please don't make this dish again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. In fact, an hour after I put the leftovers in the fridge I pulled it out again for another helping. I used two large chicken breasts cut in half. Because they were boneless I only cooked them in the oven for about 25 minutes before I put the sauce on. In the sauce I did add a little ginger. I found the sauce was also delcious with some green grapes cut in half added in the sauce right before  putting the sauce on the chicken, just enough to warm them through. I really loved this recipe.

As it is written, I am giving this recipe 3 stars. I didn't think it had enough flavor and definitely not enough sauce. However, I have used sliced, boneless chicken breasts (not baked) and changed the sauce measurements to 2 Tablespoons and added garlic and sesame oil. I have also added other vegetables that I've had on hand. That makes it a totally different recipe, but my family loves it no matter what!

This recipe was suprisingly wonderful. Everyone liked it alot. What we liked about it the best was that it was not really sweet! The only changes that I did, was use boneless chicken and made chicken strips instead of whole chicken pieces. (And I doubled the recipe for sauce)
