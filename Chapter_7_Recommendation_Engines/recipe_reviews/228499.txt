Made this for dinner last night & the whole family loved it. My only change was at the end, mixed 1/4 c. water with 2tsp. cornstarch & added to the mixture. Gave it a nice glaze. Will make this again!!

Seldom serve shrimp so I was a bit hesitant.  This recipe was very easy and didn't require any special ingredients.  Not having all the recipe's vegetables, just tossed in anything that was handy and seemed practical.  My group loved this meal.  Needlessly, I didn't divulge any of these remarks...

I just happened to have some fresh ginger and garlic and shrimp was on sale so I thought I'd try this fresh seasoned stir-fry instead of using a pre-fab sauce. I always mix Udon noodles into my stir fry and was worried that it wouldn't be saucy enough but surprise, it blended in perfectly. I used broccoli, carrots and snow peas for my veggies. I'll make this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this recipe but ended up adding more orange juice. Used about a cup and added more ginger. My kids liked it and were surprised their dad and not their mom had made it. I would try adding a bit of brown sugar and maybe a little teriyaki as well next time. I did add a little starch to thicken the sauce and that really worked well. Will definitely make it again since Lent just started.

This was not all that bad after I tweaked it a bit. I added two tablespoons smuckers sugar free apricot preserve, 1 tablespoon honey, 1 tablespoon lite soy sauce to the marinade. I then fried the shrimp but saved the marinad and added 1 tablespoon corn starch to it and then added that to the fried shrimp and sautee. Presto!

Thanks to MATTYSMOMMY for the brown sugar suggestion.  I added 4 or 5 Tbl and still was wishing I had used less cayenne and more orange zest, but it was good anyway, the shrimp was very tasty, and my husband liked it.  Will probably try it again with a few changes.

I followed the recipe exactly. With the ginger/garlic/orange flavor combination, it seemed like this should have rocked. I was really disappointed.

Very good recipe for "jumping off". I've made this with shrimp as well as with pork tenderloin. It's a great recipe for when you want that dish that doesn't feature soy sauce on the menu. And for the record, it does not need added sugar. I do however, take other reviewers tips and make a cornstarch slurry/glaze at the end 2 Tbsp cornstarch, 1/4 c chicken broth.

Loved the garlic, orange and ginger combination.  LOVED IT.  I tripled the sauce,went very heavy on the garlic and ginger, and used a pinch of red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne, changed up some of the veggies... but the basic flavor of those three sauce ingredients together kicked .  I'm totally going to make this again.  Thanks!

I used chicken instead of shrimp (my family doesn't like seafood).  The only other changes I made were to use 1/2 zucchini rather than the yellow squash (because my store didn't have it) and to add 2 tsp of brown sugar to cut the spiciness of the cayenne (we like spicy stuff - but there was too much cayenne for us).  My kids didn't care for it (they doused it in teriyaki sauce), but my husband loved it.  I would make it again for just the adults, but would cut the cayenne in half and perhaps add a bit more orange zest.

Easy and tasty!  Very fresh tasting and love that it is not real saucy.  A little soy sauce condiment at the table and your set.

The shrimp had good flavor but the vegetables did not pick that flavor up.

Seemed mild to us. I had to use ginger spice and extra orange juice.  I wish I had the orange zest, that would have upped the taste.  I didn't have cayenne pepper so I added red pepper flakes instead.  Note to self, next time don't use substitutes.

I pretty much made the recipe as written except I used 2 oranges for the zest and juice in the marinade and then added that to the stir fry at the end along with a heaping table spoon of orange marmalade to enhance the flavor and thicken the sauce.. I also used snow peas instead of squash which turned out great. The recipe was quick and tasty and I'll make it again soon.

I added a bit of garlic and ginger to the vegetables to make sure the flavor went all the way through. The orange, ginger and garlic make a wonderful combination.
