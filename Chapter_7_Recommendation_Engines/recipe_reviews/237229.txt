I was worried about this being to healthy for my teenagers but they loved it and so did I! My 13 year old even said, "We should eat healthy like this more often."

This dish had more flavor than I expected.  I did add 1/3cup of sun-dried tomatoes.  I didn't use mushrooms and added 1/2cup of shredded carrot-YUM!

Very good flavor.  a would definitely add tomatoes for color if nothing else.  Thought sundried tomatoes would be good as well.    Will make again soon.

This was a delicious one-dish meal. We didn't have  any feta cheese so used parmesan.  My husband likes it too--always a plus!

I seasoned it with basil and the juice of half a lime and threw in some green onions too! Really yummy!

This is a keeper!!  Quick, easy and very flavorful.  I must admit that we didn't follow the recipe exactly....we substituted pork for chicken because we had already planned on pork for supper when we came across this recipe. It worked great although chicken would be good as well.  Two other things were modified. One, the red pepper flakes were added with the broth and 1 teaspoon of corn starch was mixed in right before the pasta was added to thicken the broth a little. We happened to have fresh parsley on hand so used it as a garnish along with the feta. All of the flavored popped.
