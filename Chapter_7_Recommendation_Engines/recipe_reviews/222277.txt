Original poster here. I don't know why the editors changed my simple instructions, but you are supposed to chop the hot dogs into pea size pieces. It also helps to run a knife around each one before you remove it from the pan.

These made a fast, easy lunch when I still had a house full of boys after a sleepover. The boys loved them. I followed the recipe exactly, but had to cook for 11 minutes  to get them done. Great recipe:~) Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is so easy and delicious!  It was very fast and easy.  Everyone in our family loved it.  They do get a bit crumbly so I might use cupcake papers next time.  Several fell apart as I took them out of the pan.  Also, I made some mini muffins and some regular side muffins.  Both were excellent.  If you are making these for very young children you could cut the hot dogs into smaller pieces to prevent choking.

I made this using my favorite gluten free cornbread recipe, which is VERY close to this one. I had help from my 11- and 8-yr-old grandsons so kept it simple and had the eldest cut the dogs into about 5 pieces each. I used a good amount of cooking spray in the muffin cups because I wanted to get close to the taste of fried corn dogs. After cooking for about 10 minutes at 450, they were perfect. Such an easy way to get the kids involved in cooking. Thanks!

Very good.  Didn't stick at all. Used a little spray in the pan. Used a handful of shredded cheddar cheese in the batter and a little Dijon mustard.  Yum

I made a half-batch tonight as a trial for an upcoming event. I followed other reviewers suggestions and used half brown sugar, half white sugar and added a dash of vanilla. I will definitely be making these again, but will cut the sugar in half and would like to try adding corn and cheese. Mini muffins needed 10 minutes to bake to golden brown. My three-year-old is happily gobbling them down, so no complaints there!

I personally enjoyed these, my family doesn't like corn muffins but they liked these ones! The hot dogs make all the difference. I also used a regular muffin tin because I didn't have a mini one.

I added some grated cheddar cheese, some chopped celery and onion, a pimento pepper, some crushed red pepper, a little black pepper, and some paprika and boom! It was great! My picky five year old especially loved it! He couldn't get enough of them! I'll definitely be making these again! I though they were a little sweet for me though, so I'm gonna just use about 1/4 cup sugar instead next time.

Made these as written each time and we love them as a kid friendly lunch. I've also successfully made these in my regular muffin pan and had the recipe produce 18 of that size. After reading the submitter's comments I just slice the the hotdogs into discs.

WOW. These are simply awesome! It does make 48 mini muffins, so a lot of those went in the freezer. I have a feeling they will reheat beautifully. 

These did take longer than 8 minutes to bake, and I reduced the oven temp to 400 after the first 10 minutes or so. I am at a higher altitude, 5000 feet, so that may have something to do with that. 

Following another reviewer's suggestion, I sliced the hot dogs into disks, which worked well. I don't think the larger pieces recommended in the recipe would work very well. 

We LOVED these, and I'll make them often. Thanks for posting this!

These bad boys were a HIT at our football party. Bite-sized was a great way to go, as they were easy to dip and pop in your mouth. Next time, I'm going to try adding jalapenos!

Make them VEGAN: 
Use 1/4 cup applesauce rather than an egg
Use tamarind sugar rather than white sugar
Use a veggie dog- I recommend Fieldroast Frankfurters!
Nobody was the wiser.

Really easy to make and a hit with toddlers.  I do think they were a bit on the sweet side so next time I will cut back on the sugar.  Also, they broke apart very easily so I might add a little extra milk.  Definitely a keeper though.

These came out ok. I used whole wheat flour instead of white and I chopped the hot dogs into semi-large pieces. I also added a few dashes of cinnamon and about a 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla. I will definately keep this recipe for later, though I think substituting 1/4 cup of white sugar with brown might give them just a tiny bit more added flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for my kids and used a 9x13 pan instead of the muffin cups.  Worked great and clean up was a breeze.  My kids loved it after their initial response of "Is that hotdog pie?!" We had a good laugh and they gobbled it up.

I made it with skim milk. Worked fine! I didn't have the time to use muffin pans so I used a sprayed 8 X 12 ceramic dish instead. Baked it for about 35-40 mins. I wanted a more golden crust on top. Check with toothpick to make sure it's baked through.  I used 5 of the longer hot dogs because that was all I had in the freezer.  I cut them into 1/2 inch slices but they kept falling out of the finished product. Next time, I will cut up into smaller pieces so they incorporate better. This tasted great! Will make again.

I used all of these ingredients -- I just upgraded them a bit. Unbleached flour, unprocessed cane sugar,  organic milk, cage-free eggs, etc. They're quite good -- though they weren't as good as leftovers. So if you make 'em, eat 'em all while they're hot and fresh.

I made these muffins. But I used jiffy corn bread mix. Unfortunately I didn't have enough hot dogs in there. But I like the idea and will try it again using the regular recipe and adding more hot dogs. The jiffy is too tender and they were falling apart. But still good with mustard.

They were very dry even after dipping in ketchup and mustard.  My 4 year old just picked the hot dog pieces out.  I liked the idea but wouldn't make again.

Delicious. I cut up the hot dogs like the original poster said but put it into a regular muffin pan. The ones with more hot dogs tasted better. The recipe made 14 and I had to bake a little while longer. People said they tasted better than Pogos. I will definitely make these again.

It was okay, kids loved it though.  Cutting up the hot dog was better than have a whole piece.

Kids are tired of sandwiches and wraps in their school lunches, so when I saw this recipe I couldn't wait to surprise them with it. I really thought these would be a hit. They were not. One said they were 'ok', the other said they were not and he threw them away. I tried them myself before sending in their lunches, so I know I made them correctly, baked them perfectly, and they were fine (for hot dogs). Just nothing special.

I used lil smokies because  i had a package I needed to use them. I didn't cut them. They turned out great. Didn't change anything else.

I love corn dogs and these are wonderful! I followed the recipe except I only had 1 mini muffin tin, so I halved the recipe. I did 1 egg for a half of a recipe. It was still good! I also cut the hot dogs into 1 inch pieces and poked them into the middle of the cups. I will make again!

Maybe it's not fair to rate this so low since I tweaked the recipe.  Do not use paper muffin cups.  The cornbread sticks to it and had to be scraped off.  I used only 3/4 C. milk (not 1 C.) or it would have been too runny.  I only used 5 "large" hot dogs, and cut them in thirds laying them in each muffin cup.  That used all the batter with the reduced milk.  It would not have made enough batter for 16 oz. of hot dogs.  I also added about 1/2 C. shredded cheddar cheese, but you couldn't taste it.  Maybe more on top would be a plus. Just not very successful in our opinion.  Hot dogs overwhelmed the cornbread flavor the way I made it.  Otherwise, chopped bits of meat in a muffin would not be much of a meal.  I piled guacamole on top to eat this.  We live in the south where cornbread is common, and is the home of corn dogs!

Quick and easy. Cut the hot dog into very small pieces. Will try them with jalapeños next time.

Easy and good enough for a snack. I've made them twice. The first time I totally forgot to put the corn meal in and they were still good! I thought they looked funny, and then realized what I did. :) 

I made them again and they were even better. My hubs said they could use more hot dog, but I thought there was plenty. 

Two year old also loved them. :)
