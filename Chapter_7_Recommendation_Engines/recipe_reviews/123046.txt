I love the salty and sweet combination of pretzels and chocolate! I made a variation of this last year for a family reunion and got raves, along with tons of requests for the recipe. Following the same procedure, use tiny pretzel twists or the waffle shaped ones make a nice base, too. Instead of kisses, individual Rollos (chocolate covered caramels). On top, press in a toasted pecan half. Outstanding! Basically, they are Pretzel Turtles. Makes a nice hostess gift for holiday parties in a pretty holiday-themed tin.

My girlfriend gave this recipe to me and it is one of my favorites! You can use the square pretzels too and they look just as pretty as the rings. I can only find the pretzel rings at our local grocery store, Meijer. I use white chocolate hugs and whichever holiday it is I'll use those M&M's for the top. I broil it -- keeping the oven door cracked and never taking my eyes off of them (about 20-30 seconds). Store in the fridge. Excellent! *Update* My oven takes 2 minutes for the white chocolate to melt on 275, and 4-5 minutes for the milk chocolate. I would test a couple out before making an entire batch (trust me). And don't mix white and milk chocolate together while baking-- bake each separately (I learned the hard way). In the end, my rings turned out perfect for this temp.! Thank you!

Everyone loved them.
NOTE: I tried 3 different types of kisses at the same time (peanut butter, hugs, and carmel).  All had different warming temperature so do them separately.

Frito Lay's ROLD GOLD brand makes Holiday Rings (round pretzels) for anyone having a hard time finding round pretzels.

If you are having trouble finding the round pretzels in your area, go to:   http://www.fritolay.com/our-snacks/find-a-snack.htm

Select ROLD GOLD, then Holiday Rings, then your zipcode and Frito Lay will give you stores carrying them within 50 miles!

I have only ever been able to find them during the Thanksgiving/Christmas hholiday time. I just bought my first bags yesterday in MN.  My M-I-L can't find them in the PHX area (and a search per above showed no stores carrying them in the PHX area), so I will be carefully taking a couple bags to her at Thanksgiving as they are a special hit among her friends.

So make lots during the holidays and freeze them for all year long!  They freeze great.

Hope this helps!  Enjoy!

I have made this in the past but I skip the M&M's. I just place the rings on sheet of parchment paper then when they come out  I place another sheet over the top pressing lightly to fill the ring and slide all of it off the bake sheet to cool. Once it is cool just peel the top and bottom parchment free of the candy. 
Like others noted I have used ALL kinds of Kisses and they just use just a little different amount of time to melt so keep an eye on them.

When I give them as gifts I fill up a jar with these and people LOVE them.

A great variation on this is using a rolo instead of the hershey's kiss.  The addition of caramel makes it especially decadent.

Easy peasy! I used minature pretzels (couldn't find the round ones) and a mixture of Hugs and Kisses. It was super easy and super tasty! My sister made them using the square pretzels and those worked great too. She used those white chocolate "discs" that you can buy, and they worked just as good. YUM! My only warning is that if you are using white and milk chocolate - be sure you don't put them on the same cookie sheet, because they definitely melt at different times! Learned that the hard way. :)

The hit of the party!  Kids and adults alike couldn't stop raving about these.  Everyone was disappointed when they were all gone (which didn't take long!)  I made the first batch with Hershey Kisses but felt the chocolate was overpowering -- the taste of the pretzel was lost.  I had a huge bag of the milk chocolate disks (Merkens brand bought in bulk)and used these instead.  They provided the right mix of chocolate and pretzel and looked so pretty!  I baked each batch for two minutes and found that if I left them on the baking sheet for 30 seconds before pressing the M&Ms in, they came out perfect.  I slipped each tray in the refrigerator until the next batch was ready, and they set up beautifully and could be stacked right away.  I've already been asked by everyone at the party to bring them to the next function.  I will be making these as XMas gifts for teachers and neighbors.

This was a cute, fun and easy recipe.  Like other reviewers, I used the Rolos.  I found that the caramel was just a bit too much, so I cut the rolos in half and put them on top of the pretzels (caramel side facing up, unless you want a nasty, sticky mess).  I topped mine with Reese's pieces.  I think peanut m&m's would also be really good.  Salty, sweet, chocolatey...what could be better?

I'm not sure how others got this to work for them but  the kiss did not melt to properly place the m&m. I tried different times with no success. Good luck!

It doesn't get any easier than this!  Festive, fast & yummy too!  I didn't grease the pan, just used parchment paper.  The hardest part is unwrapping the Hershey kisses!  Thank you Kim Scurio for sharing your recipe and I plan to pay it forward.

These are a riot! I used Hugs, and square snap pretzels (couldn't find the round ones). With trial and error, I found that 2 minutes was perfect at 275 degrees.  At first I was waiting for the chocolate to spread which it doesn't, and shouldn't, until you take them out and press the m&m on top. I made them in small batches and put them in the fridge on parchment paper (or they'll stick like glue to a plate!). They were really quite good.

i'm going to echo all the other reviewers and say make sure you do a test batch. i made some with regular kisses and some with hugs and they needed very different baking times. the kisses were ready at exactly 3 minutes (still looked normal but smushed down just the right amount when i pressed an m&m into the top). the hugs took several batches for me to only sort of get to work. i found that at 2 minutes 55 seconds, the first few were still a little hard, but by the end of the batch they'd melted a little more from the warmth of the range. but 3 minutes was too long! the hugs also tended to end up a little lopsided, because the concentration of the milk chocolate swirls at the tip meant that the tip was less melted than the base.

beyond the need to do test batches, these are super easy and tasty! i used various combos of kisses, hugs, regular m&ms, and peanut butter m&ms. i also used the square snap pretzels because my store didn't carry the rings. still looked great!

Like so many others, I couldn't find those darn pretzel rings (after looking at SEVEN stores) so settled on the checkers ones. The Hersheys hugs did great - there is literally a 15 second window of perfect meltiness. In my oven, it was 2 minutes, 45 seconds. 15 seconds less and it was still hard in the middle, 15 more and it was too melty.  For some reason, my milk chocolate ones would NOT melt. Ever. They went from hard to cooked. Very odd.   The peppermint ones were yummy, but did not hold their colors as well as the hugs.  I used regular Cmas themed m&ms and also mint ones. The regular m&ms got a little chalky colored and lost their gloss - maybe because I put them in the freezer to cool? The mint ones I cooled in the fridge and did NOT loose their color or gloss.  All were yummy though! Will make again.

I have another version of these (takes a little more effort but I like the presentation better) - I make them with WHITE CANDY COATING - melt the candy coating, pour it into a plastic bottle (cut tip slightly bigger for quicker pouring) and squeeze into each preztel round.  Top with M&M.  These are always a big hit and make great gifts year round!!

the first time I made the rings, the kisses crumbled, next time I moved the oven rack higher and they melted correctly.  Took them to a Christmas Eve party and brought home plenty.  Good, but  probably won't make next Christmas.

Winner!  Great for kids and adults love them too.  I used candy cane hersey kisses and only red and green M&Ms. Actually, after instructions, my kids made them.  The decorating possibilties and combinations of chocolate products are endless!

wonderful combination of salt and sweet. If you like nuts use Peanut M&M's instead, very very good! These are so easy that your kids can help with them too.

Unwrapping all those kisses is a pain, but otherwise, this is simple and cute. They're going in a care package for my college-agedson...I'm sure they'll be a hit!

WARNING: Do not use regular Hershey's Kisses. They will not melt.   You need to use Hersey's Hugs Kisses (white chocolate on the outside, regular chocolate on the inside) and they will melt perfectly.  I also used Hershey's Candy Cane Kisses and they worked really well too.

These are AMAZING. I used butter snap pretzel squares (they're my favorite because they taste butter-y and they give these treats just a little extra richness) and white chocolate kisses w/ the chocolate swirls for mine after I saw a picture of these where someone had used the white chocolate kisses as well. They come out looking like you bought them at a bakery, they're so pretty! I used almond m&ms for some of mine, they're good that way but the almonds make the chocolate spread a bit more than regular m&ms. It doesn't really matter I guess but if you use the almond m&ms give your chocolate a few minutes to cool before you put them on top, I made a mess out of some of mine because my chocolate was so soft. Thanks for sharing your recipe, I'm sure ill be making these all year long!

Very nice and pretty. I used huggs and m&m's on some and the other half used rolos and pecan halves. My only recommendation would be to place them on parchment paper when baking for easy removal because even though i greased my sheet a couple stuck and broke the pretzels when removing them.

I love to make these!  Instead of using chocolate kisses, my hubby and I like using white chocolate wafers and Reese's Pieces.  Crispy, salty, creamy, sweet - this has got it all!

Love 'em! We are sending a big tin of these across the country to family for Christmas time cuz they are simple and I think they will ship well. We used the candy cane kisses (white with red stripes) and they melted perfectly at 2 minutes. FYI for everyone making them the first time - just because they don't LOOK melted doesn't mean they aren't. Stick your finger in there at 2 minutes and check - mine were still standing tall but they were melted through already. I plan to try these with a bunch of other flavors and with Reeses Pieces instead of m&ms also. I can't speak for all the kiss flavors but the candy cane ones took a full 20 minutes to cool in the fridge. Fun little project to do with my daughter. Thanks! Oh - almost forgot - we found a big bag of round pretzels for cheap at Aldi.

Yummy!!! So easy. Made about 80 pieces. As other reviewers noted, cannot find round pretzel rings. Used square ones, with hershey kisses and M&Ms. My daughter made them as teacher gifts, she really enjoyed making them. We did have to cool them about 30 mins. in fridge;could be due to the day being very humid and hot. Might have affected kitchen temp. When my daughter brought the few remaining pieces home from her school party, the chocolate was still firm and the M&Ms stayed in place. I think this was due to the extra firming time in the fridge.
Thanks for sharing this recipe. Will look for the ring pretzels closer to holidays; they may be available then.

I remember having these YEARS ago at a Christmas Party after I made these today.  And yep, still very addictive...I would say that is about the only thing a matter with this recipe is that you can't stop eating them.  Since I know my downfall for this kinda thing I only made a little bit, but definatly will keep this recipe in mind for parties and holidays!  Thanks, awesome and easy!

Yummy!  I put the kisses on a waffle pretzel and microwaved them for 45 seconds.  I found that if I arranged the pretzel rings in a perfect circle on a paperplate to microwave them, they all came out evenly soft.  I used Blue and Orange M&M's for a Coast Guard Day themed bake sale.  Big hit - both delicious and asthetically pleasing!

Try Reese's Peanut Butter cups with a half walnut on top, and you'll never go back to the original. Just make sure you don't over-melt them. It takes about 5 mins in the oven and the cups will look just slightly soft, but they're ready to go. Immediately press walnuts on top and put in the frig for about 15 mins to set. AWESOME!

So cute! When I bake Christmas cookies, I also try to find a few simple snacks I can prepare to balance out the workload. :) Not only were these super easy to prepare, they were yummy too! These were also a perfect snack for my Christmas day roadtrip to St. Louis (NOTHING is open on Christmas day!). In fact, my hubs couldn't get enough of them lol! NOTE: It took exactly 2.5 minutes for my chocolates to soften and 5 minutes to set up in the freezer. Just be sure to grease your cookie sheet well so that you can easily remove your pretzel bites without breaking them. :) Thanks for sharing, Kim! I'm going to make another batch of these for New Year's Eve snacking, but with Rolos as my sister suggested. :-)

Easy! Must be patient and start with only a few to find your perfect time. Mine was 2 minutes. I gave up trying to heat the striped chocolates because they just melted right through so I stuck with traditional chocolate kisses. Don't bother with measurements, use up the bags!

Great/Easy recipe! I use the Snyder of Hanover 'Snaps' which are the square shaped pretzels, and alternate between milk chocolate hershey kisses and the hersey 'hugs' which are the white/milk chocolate swirl ones. (The hugs seem to melt better and are usually more popular). I usually stick them in the freezer to cool and leave them in either the fridge or freezer until serving (I personally like them better a little chilled).  They are always a hit and fun to make! Very versatile too, as you can simply change the m&m colors for each holiday/get-together!

The kids loved helping with this recipe but the kisses didn't melt well at this time or temp. The chocolate cracked and looked dreadful or didn't grab around the pretzel enough and fell off easily.

Amazing! Used the square pretzel snaps, peppermint kisses and the red and green m & m's. They couldn't have been cuter or tastier! Made regular ones too. They were incredibly easy and looked adorable on a Christmas themed platter!

First time I have made them and will definitely make more! The only thing I did differently was I did not put an M&M on top. I followed a suggestion by another and put a piece of parchment paper on top of the kisses when they came out of the oven and slightly pushed down on them. The chocolate stuck to the paper when I tried to remove it, so I left the paper on and refrigerated them till they were set ande the paper came off nicely. Excellent combination chocolate and salty pretzels.

This is so easy - and so tasty too! I made 2 batches in about 10 minutes total (counting unwrapping the hershey kisses). I used rolos for one batch, and candy cane hershey kisses for the other. I also just used regular mini pretzels (what I had on hand). Thank for sharing this recipe; they're a nice, easy treat to add to my cookie trays to change it up a bit!

Very cute, tasty and easy. Everyone loves them. I made them with hugs and caramel kisses and waffle pretzels. My mother-in-law had to have the recipe to make as gifts.

Easy recipe... only thing was that I had to put them in the fridge for over a half hour because the chocolate wasn't firm enough after just 10 minutes.  They taste great though!!

A perfect snack!  The salty and sweet combo is wonderful and really eye-catching too.  Everyone at the potluck I brought them to loved them and said they were such a great idea.  I made the mistake of putting Hugs and Milk Chocolate kisses in the oven at the same time, and the Hugs melted all over - so definitely watch your baking times!  1-2 minutes should be plenty.  I also used peanut butter M&Ms for the tops, and they were delicious!

Fast, Easy, Delicious.  If you enjoy the sweet and salty combo, this recipe is the ticket.  I was looking for something to replace the white chocolate-dipped pretzels I usually do around this time of the year because the dipping process is just so dang time consuming.  This is perfect.  The longest part of the recipe is unwrapping the Kisses and Hugs.  Some things to note is that I found it best to keep the chocolate in the oven until the Kiss/Hug begins loosing its shape and melting down so that it "hugs" the side of the pretzel.  Otherwise, you will find yourself "smooshing" the M&M around the middles of the chocolate in order to "grab" the pretzel.  Test times in your own oven on one or two pretzels by themselves before doing an entire batch; Kisses and Hugs required different times, more for the milk chocolate.  I can't wait to try the Rolos and Pecan twist!

I made these as another reviewer suggested.....I used mini twists and put a milk dud on top.  I warmed them in the oven at 275 for 3 minutes.  When I took them out I pressed a half a pecan on top.  These are so good and so quick to make!

Have made these many times using rolos instead of kisses and pecan halves instead of M&M's, so they're turtle-y. Yummy!

These were very good, I did make a few changes though. I couldn't find pretzel rings in any of my local stores so I used the square (checkerboard) pretzels (found a big bag at the Dollar Tree). I used Hershey's Hugs and regular Kisses (we liked the Hugs better). I ran out of M&M's about halfway through, so I used Reese's pieces for the rest. Yum!

This is a great holiday recipe.  I've tried with circle pretzels and the waffle square ones - both turned out great.  They look nice, are easy to eat (people can just pop 'em in their mouth), and they are easy to  transport to parties.  Kid's had fun helping too.

 and very easy!  I found Utz makes a wheel pretzel that works well-the "spokes" make a nice base.  I also make sandwiches using Rolo candies.

So simple and so good! Whenever I make something perfectly on the first try I know it's a winner! Three minutes was exactly right for regular hershey kisses. Will experiment with hugs and caramel kisses as other reviewers recommended.

So easy!! And So good!! BUT.... be careful not to have the oven too hot AND do not heat them more than the 3 minutes. You are not cooking them, only heating them to soften the chocolate. Heating too long or too hot will break down the chocolate and instead of softening, the chocolate will dry out.

For everyone having trouble with the kisses melting, I make these using milk chocolate and white chocloate wafers instead of kisses. They melt easier. Great at Christmas time using the red and green M&M's. Looks pretty , especially on the white chocolate.

My kids and I make them every year for the holidays. They make great teacher's gifts! They are also great to bake in bulk. My daughters combined give them to about 10 teachers and it is very easy to make a few trays of them, stick a bunch in paper chinese takeout containers, and bring to school. 

P.S. Remember, when you are baking, the dark chocolate pretzels tend to take longer to melt, so take that into consideration.

They do not sell the rings where I live so we used the square pretzels. They turned out great! They were pretty simple to make, just a little time consuming since we made so many. You did have to time the placing of the M&M just before the Hug started to melt so you wouldnt have a huge mess mess on your hands. I would for sure make these again maybe even for easter with pastel m&ms. We put these in tins with fudge and other candy for my kids teachers and church teachers. We also sent them to my daughters dance class party and church Christmas party. Kids and adults loved them!

I used small pretzel rings and standard-sized kisses and the ratio of chocolate to pretzel was off. I'd recommend using larger pretzels. Otherwise the pretzel taste gets lost. visually, though, the final result was quite pretty and made great additions to gift tins.

THese went over very well during all the holiday events.  I added a few variations to them-used Cherry kisses and after taking them out of the oven just pushed them down a little bit (no M&M's) i also used Reeses PB cups (did not use M&M's either) was really good.

These were easy enough for my 7 year old to do most of the work and she enjoyed it. We had a bit of trouble pushing the M&M down into the Kiss without cracking the Kiss... the pictures looked prettier than ours turned out but they tasted good. I left them in the fridge too long and the chocolate got little white spots all over it. I made some with a peanut butter chips in place of the M&M's and I liked those too.

I used the peppermint & vanilla swirl Hersey's Kisses because the store was out of the vanilla/chocolate Hugs. They ended up coming out pretty good. The 1st batch I cooked a minute too long so they were a bit too melted. After that I only kept them in the oven for about 1 minute 45 seconds & they did better. Great for the holidays. I greased the baking sheet with cooking spray & had no issues with sticking.

A friend recently made these for the clinic where I work, and I loved them! They are a tasty and fun twist on the traditional chocolate-covered pretzels, and so cute, too! I will definitely keep this in mind as a fun treat to make with kids.

So simple, so good.  My kids actually made these, and they turned out darling with the Hugs Kisses.  They put these on the treat trays for our neighbors.  These could be done for lots of holidays throughout the year with different colored candies.

This is a great activity to do with the kids--even my 2 year-old helped. They're so quick and so tasty. I used Reese's pieces, Hershey's Kisses Drops and Hugs Drops on waffle pretzels. For those who can have peanut butter, the Reese's pieces kept it from being too chocolate-y.

These are the easiest!!  And so good.  As other reviewers said, watch your chocolates once they are in the oven.  Depending which you use, the melting times vary greatly.  As far as where to find the pretzel rings, I had a heck of a time!  I lucked out after a stop at my local Aldi's, whose brand "Clancy's" has rings :)

I made these pretzels for a demonstration speeck in my communication class. They were a huge hit...SOOOOO simple and easy to make..I'm talking easy beyond words. We had only 6 minutes to give our speech...I did it!  I couldn't find the round pretzels, so I used the little square checkerboard variety...which worked out perfectly, because I use the Dove Dark Chocolate chocolates...and those are square too. When Dove chocolates melt, they are really shiny and pretty..and they remain shiny even when they harden again. I topped these with Pecan halves....Peanut Butter Chips...Heath Candy bits...Flakes of white chocolate..Slivered Almonds..and  Andy's Mint candy pieces....They looked awesome..and tasted incredible. My kids can make them too. They are virtually "Mess-less"..there's no clean up necessary..and for a busy mom like me..that's a HUGE plus!!  You've definitely gotta try these.

These little goodies are the prefect treat to make during the holiday season.  I made several batches this year and really enjoyed making them.  Very simple, quick and neat.  I made these using dark chocolate kisses topped with an M&M and Rolos topped with a toasted pecan halve which I then drizzled with white chocolate.  Paased the recipe on to my mom and she has made several batches herself.  Great recipe, thank you for sharing!

I love how versatile this little treat is.  I made 293 of them today and froze them for Christmas.  I used Cookies & Cream, Cherry Cordial, Dk. Chocolate Raspberry flavored Kisses, Hugs, Dove Peppermint Bark Promises, Chocolate Covered Caramels, and topped each with either an M&M or a candy coated Jr. Mint, depending on the flavor of the Kiss/Hug.

MMM, chocolate covered pretzels are one of my favorite treats but they are so annoying to make. These are a great alternative and were very easy. I could really only find the mini twists which was okay because in the end you're going  to eat them anyways right? The Hugs ones turned out the worst looking because the chocolate middle melted at a slower rate than the white chocolate wo they weren't as pretty as the ones I used just using regular Kisses.

This is so easy it can hardly be called a recipe.  I used butter snap square-shaped pretzels and they worked great.  I ran out of M&Ms so I made a few with mini marshmallows and put make into the oven for 1 minute and then pressed them down...they tasted GREAT!

These taste good and look cute. I used small pretzel twists and they did not work well. I placed the kiss in the middle, where the twist is and as they melted, they fell off to one side and didn't fill in the center when I placed the M&Ms on them. I think the pretzel rounds would've worked much better. Also, watch your melting time. You might want to try one at a time until you figure out what works best with your oven. If you keep them in then oven a little too long, the chocolate goes everywhere and there is nothing to puch the M&M into. I made these for a baby shower for tomorrow and I'll use them, but they aren't as pretty as I would've liked. But, with a few modifications, I think they'll work perfect next time.

I made these for a Super Bowl party...using orange m&m's for the Bears and blue for the Colts. They were cute and tasted great too. I could not find the round pretzels anywhere...and I looked everywhere, but they came out just fine on regular pretzels. I will make these again for anything that has certain decorative colors...maybe even my daughter's themed birthday party.

I have made these twice with rolos and peanut m&m's and they disappeared very fast with requests to make more. "Chocolate covered pretzels on steroids" is how my son described them!

Amazing! Much better than my original idea of dipping pretzels. I tried using the caramel filled kisses for some of them, but the caramel is too gooey. I would try them again with the rolos as others suggested. Aside from unwrapping all the kisses, these don't take very long to make up. I put them in little cellophane bags and used them in Christmas gifts.

Great party snack! Used waffle pretzels. Placed a Kiss on the pretzel, heated in oven, and then smashed it down with another waffle pretzel, like a sandwich. Will definitely make again.

I needed a quick treat to make after work for a cookie party, these were great. I used mini pretzel twists and Hug kisses. The store only had mint M&Ms, which I was hesitant to use but it turned out great. I never made it to my party but took these into work the next day and they disappeared immediately. Will defiantly make these again.

Awesome and easy! I used white striped "hugs" and it looked so festive! I also tried rolos, and that was great. Also used waffle pretzels, not round, still cool. so tasty and the hardest and worst part about the whole deal is unwrapping the idividually foiled candy pieces!

So simple! I also used rolos as an extra special treat.  Had a hard time finding round pretzels so used the waffle ones and they were perfect.  Thanks for reminding me about this great recipe.

i loved this idea so much! i enjoy baking with my kids but they tire of it so quickly, but this held their attention just long enough.  it's fun and simple and easy to do with little ones, and the real bonus is getting to munch on them afterwards - they're really good! :)

Easy, yummy, and fun!  I made mine with the waffle square shaped pretzels, rolo candies, and an m&m on top.  Everyone loved them, from the grandparents down to the kids at my daughter's first communion party.  Definitely will make again!

Is there a way to keep the chocolate from re-hardening and turning white/dry?  I have to "revive" mine before serving by microwaving them for 40 seconds.

These were a hit with the chocolate lovers that I gave them to, also tried reese pieces instead of m&m's for the peanut butter lovers out there.  For the money I prefer my own homemade candies if I have the time. These are real good for a quickie go to recipe.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I used pretzel mini twists and it came out just as well as the circles.  I used 3 types of kisses too.  All came out great EXCEPT the solid chocolate kisses.  They took longer to melt, weren't as tasty or festive.

These were great! I couldnt find pretzel rings so i used the waffle shaped ones. I made 1 batch using the milk chocolate kisses and 1 batch of candy cane kisses. I prefered the candy cane ones. everyone loved these. I will be making these again.

Loved these!!!  I went to 4 different stores looking for the round pretzels and never found them.  I decided to use the small square checkerboard looking ones and just stuck to kiss on top so the pretzel was stuck to the bottom.  It worked great and everyone loved them.  I also used the white chocolate kisses and they were good also but they melt weird and were a little difficult to make pretty but it worked out in the end!

I used an 11 oz bag of kisses and it made 67 pretzel rings. These are honestly one of my favorite holiday treats and the fact that they are quick and easy to make is even better. I love the combination of the salty and sweet flavors! My only tip is when you are pressing the M&M's into the kisses, make sure you press hard enough that the chocolate spreads far enough to touch the sides of the pretzel otherwise they won't stick together.

These are fun I make mine a little different.  I use a peice of parchment paper and place them in the microwave about 1-2 minutes until the chocolate is softened and then stick them on the table and place the m&m in it and let them sit out until they set.  Very good though!

love these! I have to add that i made these with mini peanut butter cups and oh my goodness they are the best. The peanut butter cups melt quick and i use an m&m on top to help push the p. b. cups slightly into the pretzels and it adds decoration. Then put them immediatly into the freezer. I store mine in the freezer.  The only problem is that i cant stop eating them.

This works really well with the square checkerboard pretzels sold in some of the Warehouse stores. Rollo's make a sticky mess. M&M's are best.

altho I do them a little different, I'll rate this recipe w/some suggestions (as they're all the same basic taste in the end).  I use the tiny knotted pretzels, white chocolate chips (one in each pretzel hole), and then coordinate the m&ms for the season or occasion.  people LOVE these at parties - and it's easy to make a lot of them & take a good-sized bowl/plate.  my work friends call them "pretzel dammits."  try this one - it's simple (altho time consuming), and always a hit!

Super good, super EASY! One thing I found out - if you use the white chocolate kisses or the DARK chocolate kisses, they melt much nicer than the milk chocolate kisses.  So, I usually go for the dark chocolate kisses.

These are very addictive! I made these with Hershey Hugs and they were so creamy and delicious! I've also made them with chocolate caramel cups (Walmart sells the great value brand in bags for $2) and top each with a pecan half! This is fun treat that you can make with the kids too!

Love this one! Our 6 year old calls them "Reindeer Bellybuttons", we leave these for Santa every year!! So quick and easy to make. I have also used chocolate stars for these, they don't melt quite as nice as Kisses, but will do in a pinch!

Awesome snack!!  I recommend 2 minutes in oven on 250 if you have a hot oven.  A must try for any party.

Fantastic idea!! I LOVE making and eating these! I've played around with the kisses and M&M's combination and so far love the combo of the Hershey's Hugs (milk chocolate & white chocolate Kisses) with peanut butter M&Ms. (Carmel Kisses and peanut M&Ms are really good too!) Everybody loves these when I make them and they're as good as gone as soon as they come out of the freezer! (I put them in the freezer for a couple of minutes instead of the fridge, especially when using the caramel Kisses, so the chocolate and caramel set quicker.)

I make these every year at Christmas put 8-10 in a cute baggie tie it up & give them to co-workers, friends & neighbors everyone loves them!  In fact, I was just talking about these at work today!!

Helpful hint: a convection oven truly works best to melt the hersey kiss enough to press in the M&M - use Hershey's Hugs rather than regular chocolate~

Everyone, young and old, loved this recipe.  Be careful though - Hugs and Kisses have different melting times, so do them separately.  Very versatile recipe.

These were very good.  An excellent combination of salt and sweet.  I used the waffle pretzels since they don't sell rings here.  I used caramel kisses which were good but messy!

I make these for every holiday with my two boys ages 3 & 5.  We use the square waffle pretzels since I can't find the round pretzels.  We also use the chocolate candy wafers to coordinate with the holiday.  For Halloween, we did neon green and orange chocolate wafers with orange and brown M&M's and they were a hit at school being called "Monster Eyeballs".  I am always asked how to make these and the kids are so proud of their part in making them. I can't wait to try using the rolo and cashew idea and the crushed candy cane idea for the upcoming holidays.

My husband wanted me to make these with Rolos instead of M&Ms - stick to the M&Ms!  They were great and easy but the Rolos were just too big.  Had to use waffle pretzels since the store didn't have rings.

So yummy and perfect for Christmas! Another great variation is the "Turtle" Use a Rolo (Caramel) instead of Kiss and top with a pecan rather than M&M. Both versions are wonderfully salty and sweet!

Modified as others suggested using Rolo's (husband bought mini Rolo's and they worked perfect) and pecan half.  Took them to a lake house party and the kids and adults DEVOURED them.  :) Baked at 250 degrees for 2 minutes.  Used parchment paper on cookie sheet and transferred to refrigerator to cool.  Will make 2 batches next time.

I have made these for years.  They are also really good if you put a hershey's hug in the middle and top with a mini m&m or a Rolo candy and then top with your favorite kind of nut!

I made these for the first time today and I have to say that they were very easy to do. I couldn't find ring pretzels so I used square ones. First I did them with one bag of milk chocolate Hershey kisses. They turned out so nice. I also had a couple of older kisses that I thought I'd use as well. BIG MISTAKE! They did not melt well and when I put the M&M on top it cracked. I guess they were too stale. Then I made some using rolos. With these I think I baked them a little too long. They are in the fridge now so I'm not 100% how they taste or what there final appearance will be. I'd make these again and would recommend them to everyone!

Cute idea.  Wonderful project to make with young children.  I made these with my 2 year old son.  He loved unwrapping the chocolates and placing them in the rings.   I used hersheys hugs,  and do they don't melt down the same as the regular chocolates do.  I would advise against using hugs,  as I had to pull them from the oven before they got melty,  they began to brown and get crumbly first.   I also made these with the rolos and pecan halves.  These turned out wonderfully.  I will have to hide them from my husband if I ever want them to make it on my Christmas cookie trays.     I can always find the pretzels rings at Walmart during the holiday season.       Although a rather simple recipes,  I think they will make a nice addition to my more complex cookies on my Christmas trays.

So, my local store didn't have the pretzel rings, were out of regular Hershey's kisses, and only had red and green PRETZEL M&M's, so - I made.... Waffle pretzels with Hershey's hugs and red and green pretzel M&M's on top - They turned out VERY cute!

HELP!!!! what does it mean when I try to press the M&M down and the kiss is hard and cracks? I baked at 275 for 3 min....does it mean I've melted them too long and they have "burnt" like you can chips or is it not long enough??  Frustrated!! I've made these for years and have never had this much trouble. using an electric oven but also have a gas....maybe it's not heating evenly. Any ideas on "repairing" my problem??

This recipe was great.  I can't wait to try it with some variations as others have recommended.  My 2 girls were able to help which was fun for all of us.

This recipe is great.  Pretty quick, though it takes a while to unwrap the kisses, give that job to a child while you chat with them and/or sing carols :)  My first batch I used Candy Cane Kisses and mint and almond M&M's. My second batch was dark chocolate kisses with same M&M's.  My third batch, I ran out of kisses and used white chocolate chips(5-6 in each ring) and mint M&M's.  Wish I would have read the review re: white chocolate, mine did not melt well and browned a tad on the bottom-EEK!  Tasted great still, kids thought it was a hit-my son does not like milk or dark chocolate, only white!  I also threw a couple of Dove dark chocolate/candy cane bark squares(cut in 1/4s then two in each ring and a mint M&M after baking), these turned out well but of course white choc from bark melted at a diff rate than dark choc.

Good, but not great.  I felt pretzel ring with the m&m was much to sweet.

great recipe, great taste. instead of topping with m&m, I placed another square pretzel on top for a sandwich treat. placed in frig to firm up. didn't have to worry about storing them. they don't last that long.

My 4 yo daughter loved helping me make these treats. I used almond kisses and the nuts added a tasty crunch. Also, they look like nipples! I will probably make these for the next planning meeting at the Women's Center of my university, lol.

My kids made these for teacher gifts all through elementary school - they always got rave reviews, and are so simple that even young kids can help with them.  We use milk chocolate kisses and mint M&M's.  Mmmm!!

These are GREAT! So simple, crowd pleasing and virtually foolproof. These really make a nice gift or even a snack and what's also nice is that the kids can help make them too. If you love the combo of chocolate and pretzels, definately try this recipe...you'll be glad you did! :)

Between these and the pretzel turtles  I have made about 400 to give out in little holiday "take out" boxes. I have no kitchen at the moment(renovating) but have acess to an oven. Really easy and a crowd pleaser!! Good addition to a cookie tray!

These get a 5 star rating for ease, but they only get a 4 star for flavor and looks. I make chocolate dipped pretzels every holiday season but was to lazy this year and saw this recipe and thought I would give it a try. I personally don't like how the chocolate is in on spot and sort of thick, but the ease of these is tough to beat. I used both milk and white chocolate kisses. For me I will dip my pretzels, for gifts I will make these. So easy!

I have NOT made this recipe but have made these in the past. It looks like this is similar to how I made them as well. You can spice it up and do Rolo's instead of the kisses and it tastes awesome!! Great Family and Holiday Recipe!!

Definitely experiment with each variety of kiss in your own oven for baking time before baking up a whole sheet full. Bake separate batches according to melting time. My store didn't have pbutter kisses so I used Reese's bells, a little too big so they looked messy but the taste is worth it! Also the new peppermint hugs were tasty and pretty. For pretzels the round butter "checkers" worked great and pretty presentation (couldn't find rings). Also made several batches of sugar free version for diabetic family member. Used Hershey miniature & andes candies sugar free version, break each piece in half, one half per pretzel checker, fits perfectly then. These take more like 5 minutes, don't melt as nicely but they still work & much appreciated by your diabetic family. Love this recipe b/c you can use for any holiday or occasion by tweeking the color scheme. Filled 1 pint ball jars w/ fabric over top for xmas gift giving. Low stress, pretty, and delicious! Inexpensive if you scan the sale fliers!

I like more crunch & salt so I squished the melted kisses between 2 square snaps. Just the right chocolate to salt ratio for me, and super fast and easy.

This recipe was awesome!!! I couldn't find pretzel rings so used the regular ones, Hershey's hugs and dark chocolate M&M's. They came out delicious. So easy and takes no time to make.

This recipe is very easy and versatile.  I make these to send to my husband's office and have used just about all of the Hershey kisses on the market!  The Reeses Pieces/chocolate combo is always a hit.  I also have used the cherry filled kisses with red m & m's and people raved over them!

I tried with Choco chips.  I didn't let them melt long enough but they were good.  The color of the m & m's really is a nice change from regular choco dipped pretzels.

A very cool and easy idea.  I had trouble with any that had white chocolate or the kisses with caramel filling, and hot cocoa filling.  The peanut butter filled and mint truffle ones worked GREAT and of course the regular kisses.  Was a nice snack for my new years party!

This is a simple recipe and one you can do with your kids.  I had to bake mine a little longer so that the chocolate would melt enough.  Will make again next year.

These were a fun, easy "cooking project" to do with my kindergartener.  I think the next time I make these I am going to use the waffle type of pretzel, because we had a hard time getting the kiss to spread evenly around the ring.  That doesn't affect the taste, though!

Perfect for topping off the Christmas cookie boxes! I used Peanut Butter M&M's instead of original. All of my favorite things on one little pretzel...salt, chocolate, peanut butter!
I also used Hershey HUG's on half of them for those white chocolate lovers!

This was a wonderful recipe that was fun and enjoyable to make. I made these for Halloween, and everybody enjoyed them. My six year old sister also helped make them. I changed the recipe a little bit, I used regular pretzels instead of the round ones, and instead of Hersey's kiss, I used Herseys chocolate chips. I also let them cool until the chocolate on the pretzels was dryed.

These are so good AND so easy!  I've found that the "wagon wheel" pretzels work well. The "spokes" help lock the chocolate to the pretzel.

Very good and easy recipe.  The only problem I had was to find the round pretzel.  I couldn't find them, I went to 4 different stores.  One of the cashiers said they will have them around Christmas.  I used the small twist pretzel.

Fun treats to make with your little one.  Mine helped me unwrap all the kisses (great to have a helper for that task!) and set them on the pretzels.  I took this to a sweets pitch-in and everyone loved it!  I used Halloween color M&Ms for the season.

I used the square "snaps" because I thought it gave the chocolate something to hold onto, plus I really love the crispness.  I used milk chocolate kisses with peanut butter M&Ms and they are very good.  I'm sending them to school with my daughter for her "star student" treat to share with the class.  Just enough to be a treat, but  not too much.

These were so good! I made these for our family game night, and they were enjoyed by all the kids and the adults! So simple, and a great little treat! These would make a great little snack for kids/school parties. Thanks for a such a "SWEET" treat :O)

Wonderful!!! so easy. I used chocolate kisses, m&ms and caramel filled kisses for a little variety. They were eaten up really fast.

This is the perfect mixture between sweet and salty.  Everybody always asks how you got the chocolate on the pretzel!  You can switch up the m 'n m colors for holidays.  Bet ya can't eat just one!

only a 3 star because i used the twist pretzels.  There didn't seem to be enough chocolate to cover the pretzels. Next time i will use the rings.  Chocolate kiss melting would be a lot better.

I know where to find the round pretzels!  I was always able to find them in the Midwest, but now that I live in Arizona I can't find them anywhere. I order them online at www.pretzelsinc.com.  I buy several bags and freeze them to use throughout the year.  We every time M&Ms releases a holiday color.  Great for team colors too!
