This was ok....not amazing.  Family does not like bell peppers, so we just omitted them.  I do agree that this might taste better on the grill.  Very easy to make and not a lot of prep work...I might try again and tinker a bit.  Thanks.

Wasn't one of the best dishes I've made, the kids said it was 'good, but not spectacular'.  My youngest added a dollop of sour cream on his.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

I cooked this inside because it was too cold to grill...I think it would of come out a lot better grilled...

This was a hit at our last party.  We marinated the meat overnight in the sauce instead of just brushing it on during grilling, and we "roasted" the peppers on the grill.  This can be fully prepared before guests arrive - always a bonus.
