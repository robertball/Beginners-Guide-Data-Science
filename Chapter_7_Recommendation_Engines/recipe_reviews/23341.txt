I didn't have peanut butter chips, but I did have swirled milk chocolate and peanut butter chips and what a happy surprise that turned out to be! After tasting these I know I will always make the frosting this way! I also replaced 1/4 c. of the butter with 1/4 c. peanut butter and let me tell you, the result was this beautiful, gooey "stuff" that looked like caramel ice cream topping. Thinking the brownies could use a little garnish or decoration, I sprinkled more of the swirled milk chocolate and peanut butter chips over the top. So pretty! Taste is what really matters, however, so I cut myself a tiny piece to "test" them and man oh man, what another happy surprise!  I didn't expect them to be THAT good! This milk chocolatey, peanut buttery frosting sets up nicely in the refrigerator but is still gooey, and is the perfect finish on the chewy, fudgey brownie beneath. That "taste" was so darn good it ended up being the equivalent of two brownies. My only criticism is that the title doesn't do these deliciously decadent brownies justice!

I made these for my boyfriend's birthday (he LOVES peanut butter). He rated this as a 4 star brownie. I did add a healthy dollop of peanut butter to the frosting to make sure it had a nice peanut flavor. I like these best when they're cold because the peanut butter isn't so overwhelming, but bf likes them better warm. **UPDATE** I had to change this to 5 stars because my boyfriend took these to work and his coworkers said they would pay me to make these again this week. If a bunch of grown men offer to pay $20 for a brownie, it's gotta be a 5 star. :)

I had read the reviews for this recipe and was a little worried about making it, but they sounded so good that I decided to try anyway.  I put them in the refridgerator right after I put the frosting on top of the brownies.  In a couple of hours, it was hard.  They were absolutely delicious, and not at all gooey.  I will definately make these again, and they were so easy!

After reading over the ingredient list, I realized that these brownies have to be refridgerated.  They turn out great everytime, the topping is soft and creamy, and it holds up well when cut with a knife.  They make a great presentation at a party.  The other reviewers obviously didn't realize that when chocolate chips, butter and sweetened condensed milk cool in the refridgerator that they harden a bit.  This is not a "sloppy mess".

Okay...for anyone else who makes this mistake, I wasn't paying close attention to the directions and I added the sweetened condensed milk to the peanut butter chips and butter right at the beginning of heating on the stove, but it turned out just fine! I took these to a friends house for dinner and everyone loved them! I added a 1/2 cup each of peanut butter and semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter and I also added about 1/2 cup of peanut butter to the frosting like others suggested. They turned out GREAT! Before I added the peanut butter to the frosting, it was way too sweet, but the peanut butter made it just right. The frosting turns hard once it's in the fridge but it's still SO good. We also tried heating a brownie in the microwave for about 20 seconds and the frosting melted just a little and dripped down the sides of the brownie...SO GOOD! I will definitely make these again! Hope this helps!

These were good but *very* rich.  I also recommend making a 13x9 inch pan of brownies because the topping makes so much.

I loved this frosting. I did not however put it on brownies. I made the frosting for a chocolate cake and I had no left overs. I did make a slight change though. I added 1 1/2 - 2 cups of peanut butter chips and just dumped it on top of a chocolate cake that was still in baking dish. The frosting will ooze down the sides of dish. This is a great peanut butter frosting recipe.

Love the frosting.  I used 1 cup peanut butter chips, 1/4 cup butter, and 1 can of sweetened condensed milk and it worked out perfectly.  After it chilled for a few hours it cut fine.

A good recipe.  I added 1 cup of chips to the batter.  For the frosting, I omitted the butter.  After frosting, I placed the brownies in the refridgerator.

I took this to a church dinner.  Everyone loved it. The only problem was that the fudge never set, so it was really messy.

DELICIOUS!!! I even ate them warm...yum! I used what I had on hand for the peanut butter frosting (sweetened condensed milk, peanut butter, and 1/4 cup butter). I melted butter in the microwave and then used a spoon to mix in the peanut butter; then, I added the sweetened condensed milk. Sweet, thick, and tasty! We all ate a spoonful of it.

Super good! I couldn't stop licking the spatula after I spread the frosting on the brownies. I put about 2 tablespoons of peanut butter in with the chips and butter, just to assure a good peanut butter flavor. Once spread in the pan, I drizzled Hershey's Syrup across the top and then dragged the tip of a knife through it to make a pretty design. I kept it in the refrigerator till the frosting set up but I think that it tastes better at room temperature. Either way, the frosting wasn't runny. To be honest though, I think the frosting would be better on a Texas Sheet Cake than it is on the brownie.

I poured the frosting on the brownies when they were still just a bit warm and put it in the fridge for about an hour.  It was a gooey mess, the flavor was bland, and it was overly sweet (and I am a sweets person -- I didn't think anything could be "overly sweet").  I refrigerated overnight and tried again in the morning.  The consistency was much better (less gooey) and the flavor seemed slightly better, however, now the brownie was cold.  As they returned to room temperature, the gooeyness returned.  This frosting is not for me.  If you enjoy your brownies cold and enjoy a very sweet frosting, this may be perfect for you!

Only reviewing the icing itself- made this to put on top of some peanut butter brownies, which was great. Put aside some extra to use as an ice cream topping. Really rich, but really good.

These were good. I read reviews and added a little peanut butter to the frosting I WISH I WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED THE RECIPE. It just wasn't that sweet w/ the added peanut butter.

I made it as such; 1 1/4 cup natural PB, 1/4 cup unsalted butter, 1 tsp. of salt and the can of sweetened condensed milk. I opted to swirl this into "Crazy Cake" from AR before baking. It didn't stay fudge-y but was tasty nonetheless. Will try this as a topping next time.

This is soooooo yummy! Like gooey peanut butter fudge; I recommend putting them on the brownies after they cool or it takes a while to set up. It is still yummy either way!

I followed the simple directions to a "t" (except used butterscotch instead of pb chips) and even with thorough cooling in the fridge this frosting was incredibly runny and made a sloppy mess. Flavor not bad but so incredibly sweet...also rather artificial-tasting with the sweetened condensed milk.  Won't make this again, sorry!

I made this topping today and put it over a dark choclate cake. It is wonderful! I made a bundt cake so I didn't use alot of the frosting.  I used the leftover frosting as a dip. We have dipped apples, pretzels, and such, and we are currently looking for more things to dip! This recipe is a keeper!

I used a peanut butter chip brownie mix and I liked the fact that they were gooey. If they are cold, they tend to be less gooey. My daughter added Reeses pieces on top, to make them triple peanut butter brownies.

I made half the recipe to top a 9x13 pan of the Mmmm Better Brownies on this site and it was PLENTY!! Great flavor, went over very well with coworkers. I "jazzed" them up a bit with some chopped up Butterfingers just for fun. No complaints here!

My boyfriend is a dyed in the wool peanut butter fanatic!  He put a forkfull of this brownie in his mouth and yelled "SUCCESS".  I followed the recipe exactly aside from adding a few more tablespoons of peanut butter after the condensed milk and about a half tsp of salt to bring out the peanut butter flavor a bit more.  For those of you who said "goopy"....I can only imagine your mistake was to not cool the brownies before you added the fudge frosting.  I chilled the brownies and spread the frosting on while it was still warm but not hot...then I chilled the whole lot for about 30 minutes.  Lovely moist brownies covered in thick peanut butter fudge!  Thumbs up from me and the boyfriend...I do not even like peanut butter that much and I LOVED these!

This is delicious...I used other's reviews and chilled after spreading the topping on, and it was easy to cut. Also, I added a tablespoon of Peanut butter, which made it nice and tasty... Great recipe, easy to make!

Awesome recipe, I use the frosting for everything! But I always use the chocolate peanut butter mix chips. It's perfect for all things chocolate. My kids always request this frosting and it does make a lot.

I had a box of brownie mix and wanted to do something better than just plain brownies.  I followed this recipe except used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup peanut butter.  Very thick and gooey topping on top of the plain brownies.. to die for :)  I plan on taking the majority to work on Monday since they are very rich.

This frosting came out delicious and set up beautifully. Everyone loved it on ordinary brownies. I did not bother refrigerating anything. Thanks for sharing!

Great Recipe, One clarification though... Can you use regular smooth peanut butter instead of the peanut butter chips??? I'm from India and its really hard to find chips here..... Any alternate suggestions???
 Much appreciated.

Love, love, love these brownies!  Made these again for Hubs for Father's Day, who loves all things peanut butter.  Easy to put together, the kids were able to help, and they definately rich and fudgey!  Perfect for us.

These brownies are the best EVER! I added both chocolate chips AND peanut butter chips to the batter just for extra goodness. This frosting is FABULOUS!!!! I mean it COULD NOT be better!!!! Just be sure to put this in the fridge or the consistency will be a bit of a mess.

This frosting is way too thin for a cake.  I made it with an additional 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips and beat in two cups of powdered sugar until smooth.  This stayed put perfectly on top of a chocolate bundt cake!

This makes ALOT, I made a standard brownie mix in a 13 by 9 in pan, and really only needed 1/2 of the frosting. The flavor was delicious, I did add a tblsp. of peanut butter as other reviewers recommended. I will definetly experiment with this frosting for other recipes!

Oh my gosh are these awesome! I ended up making a 2nd batch because the 1st one was gone quite quickly. I did cut the frosting by about a third on my 2nd batch because it was a bit much on the 1st batch. Very good though, just a little too much.

I'm rating this on the peanut butter frosting alone, because I used a brownie recipe rather than a mix.  The frosting was super easy to prepare and to make it easier, I put the butter and peanut butter chips in the microwave to melt, stirred every 20 seconds til completed melted and then added the sweetened condensed milk.  Still came out fantastic!  A keeper!

I made homemade brownies, and the frosting with the following variations: 5 T butter, 1/2 c peanut butter chips, 1 c peanut butter. It was super easy.  I put the brownies in the fridge for 1 hour to set up, and it stayed chewy and firm at room temp. My only complaint is, even with my changes, it isn't terribly peanut buttery.  Also, since I use unsalted butter, it could use a dash of salt or vanilla to kick it up a bit.

Amazing!  I made these and put them in the refrigerator for about 3 hours before cutting into them.  I took them to my church group and they loved them!  The PB fudge frosting was delish!  It was soft and gooey, but definitely not runny. We had no problem eating them without forks :)

I followed the directions exactly. But even after 5 hours in the refrigerator, the frosting is still pretty runny. Not sure I'll try this recipe again.

This recipe for peanut butter frosting is the best frosting recipe I have ever used!!! The only reason it got 5 stars is because I dont have the option of giving it more! It is incredibly easy and absolutely heavenly! It has a wonderfully sweet and rich peanut butter taste without being overpowering. I use it for any chocolate cake, loaf, muffin or brownie that I make. It has become a stand by in my household.

I thought this recipe was great and it is not runny if you refrigerate the brownies after you have added the frosting. I found it firms up but not as hard as fudge. Really, really good. Will be using this as a frosting on my brownies once in awhile, just for a change.

These brownies had a good taste but they were not good for presentations sake.  They were extremely hard to cut and very gooey.  These are great if you are making them for your family and keeping them at home but I acutally made them to take to a party and ended up having to take something else because they just looked too sloppy.

For the brownies I made them into a POKE CAKE by using caramel topping (1/2 jar of trader Jacques caramel sauce). Then used the other half of the jar in the frosting and it is so addictive, have to make it again.

Made the Toll House Chocolate Brownies recipe and only used skippy peanut butter instead of pb chips because I didn't have any. Just melted the peanut butter in the microwave with the butter, then stirred in the sweetened condensed milk, no need for the stove! Cooled in fridge. Turned out amazing in a 9x13.

Super amazing!!!!! I did sub out half the amount of butter and used skippy chocolate peanut butter and a bit of milk chocolate chips with the peanut butter.. not that this needed any boosting. I never rate things but holy cow, this is delicious and easy.. it makes a bunch and I'm using the remainder warmed up and served over ice cream!! It's fudgy and rich!! For anyone who finds its too thin try putting just the frosting in the fridge before hand

I loved the flavor of the frosting.  The only problem was the consistancy was more like a syrup.  I'm going to look through the suggestions and see if I can fix that next time.

i made these exactly as directed, and they were good, but it was just too much.  you could hardly taste the brownie over the flavor of the frosting.  next time i think ill cut the frosting recipe in half and try it.

These were good. But, I used the alterations that were suggested- the semi-sweet/ pb chips w/ 1/4 cup pb... I think I would have liked it the original way better. This tasted almost like very thick/ very rich caramel w/ a hint of peanut butter on a brownie. I love the taste of pb so I should have kept to the recipe. I will try them again that way. They were not bad just not what I wanted. Everyone who has tried them at my house has been able to eat half of one because they are sooooo rich.

This was very good.  I used 1/2 cup peanut butter, 1 cup pb chips, 1 can condensed milk, and about 2 tbsp of butter.  I did have to chill it but the consistency was great!  Very decadent!

This was easy and the taste was really good however the frosting was sooo runny maybe addiing powdered sugar would help a bit to dry it up...we had to use a spoon to eat these.....

I'm making these for the 2nd time today.  They are so rich and yummy.  I had ziti in my 9x13 the first time, so I made in a 9x9 pan and those were the thickest, most peanut buttery brownies ever.  My husband thought that they were too rich that way b/c the amount of peanut butter frosting on top was 1 inch thick.  I agree - today I made in the 9x13 pan and I think they will be just perfect! Thanks! Update:  They were better in the 9X13.  Also, leave a lot of time for them to set up in the fridge!!  I took them to a party after they were in the fridge for a couple hours and they were still a gooey mess when cutting them at the party!

My teenage son and his friends loved this wonderful brownie.  The peanut butter topping is amazing! I sent it on a ski trip and these are the only ones that they ate.  I will always keep this recipe in my file for a quick and easy dessert.

The taste is yummy but I think it is missing something to make this recipe come together.  I am not a nut person but maybe pecans with this would give the brownie a turtle like taste.  It is very gooey (even though I kept them in the fridge the entire time) and hard to cut but manageable.  With that said they were eaten quite fast in this house.  Thank you

DELICIOUS! Definitely keep it in the refrigerator though or else it is too gooey to cut. Since I tried this, I can't make brownies without making this too!

Well depending on who you ask, my husband thought the peanut butter fudge overpowered the browning.  I thought the brownie was only there as a way to get the fudge. It was very gooey, but after an over night stay in the fridge I didn't have any other problems with them.  They do lend themselves better to eating with a fork though rather than by hand.

I thought this recipe looked good especially since my family loves chocolate and peanut butter together.  The frosting did not set and was very gooey and I also thought the taste of peanut butter was very weak.

The topping never sets, making this too messy to serve.
