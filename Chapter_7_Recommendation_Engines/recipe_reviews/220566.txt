GREAT recipe for "Hulk Punch" for those of you who have little one's who like superheroes like mine do. The sugar can be cut back by half and be plenty sweet.

This was good. I only put in half of the sugar called for just because I prefer things more "tangy" than sweet. We served this at my daughter's 6th birthday party and people commented that it was very refreshing. The kids kept going back for more and I finally had to cut them off.
