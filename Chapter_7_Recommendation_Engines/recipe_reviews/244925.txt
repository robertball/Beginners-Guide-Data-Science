I made this while on a low fat diet before having my gallbladder removed and was floored by how good it is! Ok it's not a hot dog, but it's flavorful and salty and once it's in a bun with ketchup, it is close enough! It at least let me participate in the ritual of a summer cookout and I didn't feel left out of the fun! It's seriously good enough that I want to make it even when I'm off the eating restrictions. I'm telling everyone about this awesome recipe! Thanks!

Instead of soy sauce, I used Bragg's liquid Amino's and I added a splash or 2 of liquid smoke. It turned out really good! Such a surprise!

A few of us meet for potluck on a regular basis. We usually have a theme. We decided to have a healthier appetizer meal. We weren't looking for completely healthy, but better than our regular recipes. One thing we like and many in this group like is cocktail sausages in a sweet and sour sauce. I found this recipe for Carrot Hot Dogs and was inspired. I came up with something I thought turned out well and was very well received. Instead of large carrots, I used baby carrots and steamed them 3 minutes less. I mixed jelly (tried both grape and red current and both are good) with chili sauce (found in the condiment section next to catsup). I used 3 parts jelly to 2 parts chili sauce, heated until the jelly melted and poured over the "cocktail sausages" in the crock pot. The carrots do cook more in the sauce and have the potential to become mushy. These are so good before the sauce and they're good with the sauce. One of the women told me she tried the sausages following the recipe, then wrapped them in bacon and baked in a hot oven until the bacon was crisp. I haven't tried that yet, but plan to. This hot dog recipe is very good and versatile!

This was terrific; you can also cut the is pieces and eat them without a bun.

I wanted a Chicago hotdog but not the heartburn.  I remembered this convenient hack, marinated, baked in toaster oven, added condiments plus celery salt and had on a bun. I only made one large carrot. It's just as well as I would have eaten more. I added pomegranate juice and hot pepper seeds to the marinate, not sugar. I used garlic salt not cloves. It's hard to live without hotdogs hate, but these ease the pain.

Right off the bat I'm going to confess that I have not made this recipe but I'm giving it 5 stars for creativity alone.  I have had to make dietary changes and and am happily leaning toward much more veggie-heavy choices.  I would NEVER  have thought of making a hot dog out of a large carrot and I'm eager to try this recipe (with a few seasoning modifications for personal preference).  I can *totally* see enjoying this on a whole wheat bun with all of my favorite 'dog' toppers - and not feeling guilty afterward.  THANK YOU, lisauce, for sharing this!!

Can't wait to try this been looking for one that does not have Liquid Smoke in it. All I can taste the chemical flavor in liquid smoke, for me it takes it over. Hope I can do this soon

This is a very delicious recipe. I was absolutely convinced before we did it that it was going to be terrible and I'm so glad I was wrong. We subbed coconut aminos for the soy sauce, used cabbage juice in place of added water, and made up the amounts on the marinade. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone. I had real sausage the day before with my partner and then we had these. We were both slightly confused and amazed at first. If done right these could possibly fool your carnivor friends.

Made exactly as directed even tough I'm not a fan of ginger.  The marinade mix  smelled delicious and would like to know  What else it could be  used with.

I made these and were surprised at how good they were. Even my meat-eating husband liked them. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a splash of liquid smoke to the marinade. Will definitely be making these again.

These took a long time to make but we're so much fun to serve and eat. The meat eaters tried it and even said not bad. The only. As side is they don't seem very filling.

My daughter and I really liked these. We have been on a no meat diet for about a year, so this was a fun dinner. I didn't change anything other than tamari for soy.  We always have carrots on hand so this recipe goes into that easy dinner file. Thank you for sharing lisauce!
