I must admit, when I first read this recipe I was a little aprehensive.  I'm not a big fan of cabbage and neither are my kids.  But, my husband found it and it reminded him of an old recipe his mom used to prepare.  So we tried it...and we absolutely loved it!  Even the kids went back for more.  Next time I'll probably make a little extra so I can pack for lunch the next day.  Another great one to add to the recipe box!

Very good and unique taste! I used 1 lb of regular pork sausage and 1/2 of maple pork sausage. Once mixed together, the combo produced a very nice, subtle sweet taste! Also, I used a pkg of colesalw cabbage and less red pepper flakes. I was skeptical about the sour cream but it really brings this dish together! Served in "Peppy's Pita Bread" from this site and the way these were devoured, I'd wager that lunch was a hit! Thanks for the neat idea Holly!

Great, fast and tasty recipe. BUT, watch the red pepper. Thankfully I read the reviews before making this and only added 1 teaspoon of red pepper and it was still too hot for the kids to eat! We like spicy foods, but even cutting down the amount of pepper it was still spicy. The taste was a great combination. And it was such a quick recipe to make. I WILL make it again, but only add a pinch of red pepper.

Nice flavor and soooo easy. My hubby loves bierrocks and these are alot like them with less bread. I used Peppys Pita Bread because I had no pita pockets in the house. Some folks may find this filling a little rich with so much sausage, I cut the richness by using half ground beef with half sausage. Thanks Holly.

This was so easy to make and super tasty.  It didn't sog up the pita bread like I thought it might which is good.  Didn't use as much crushed pepper, start with a little then adjust or you'll be LIT UP!

I freakin' love these things!  I, too, utilized the pre-shredded "cole slaw" cabbage as I was in one of those "I need to make dinner but I also don't need to put in a lot of effort - or dirty a lot of dishes - to make said dinner happen."  I also used half regular sausage and half ground beef, per some other reviewers' suggestions.  I think the mixture is great by itself, but I think the bread makes it.  The not-greatly-stocked grocery store I run to by work for emergencies didn't have pita bread, so I used some flat bread instead.  My husband had his doubts, but then couldn't resist stealing a bite of mine when I wasn't looking.  He is now a convert and this will be in my "feeling kinda lazy but not lazy enough to call the pizza guys" recipe file.  Thanks!

This was good, but we ended up using honey on it at the table to make it one better. Thank you for an interesting take. We usually used chicken and stir fry veggies to fill our pitas.

Excellent Dish. As other recommended, we ate this with potatoes, but I am excited about trying it out tomorrow in a Pita. It had a little kick to it, but my kids, who don't like spicey food, ate it with no complaints.  Wouldn't change anything and will definitely do again.

My husband loved it.  Me, not so much. I've never been a big fan of ground sausage anyway. To many conflicting flavors I thought. It needs a lot more cabbage. I give it three stars because of how much my husband enjoyed it.

Absolutely delicious!  My husband said that the filling part of this recipe was one of the most delightful things he had ever put in his mouth.  We don't use white sugar around our house (mostly use brown or raw), so I used brown in place of white sugar.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.

It was pretty good, if you like cabbage and pork.  But the pita was non-sequitar. It added nothing to the meal.

I really enjoyed this dish.  I reduced the crushed red pepper to 1 tsp and it still had plenty of kick.  I also used 1 lb. of mild breakfast sausage and a bag of coleslaw mix.  I'l make ths one again for sure!

Personally, I give it 5 stars for flavor, but the rest of the family was very unimpressed. Scaled the recipe to 4 servings which allowed me to use 1 lb sausage and one bag of prepackaged cole slaw. I cut the red pepper flakes in half and very glad I did - still pretty spicy, but perfect for my taste. I thought the filling was so good that the pita was unnecessary - I enjoyed it as a one skillet meal.

Personally, I didn't think it had much flavor besides the heat in the red pepper flakes.  I did use turkey sausage and low fat sour cream, maybe it would be better with the fully loaded stuff. Thanks for sharing though!!

This was surprisingly - really, really good! Wow, it makes a lot. And, it's extremely filling - we had leftovers for days. I may freeze some of it next time, because it can get old. I'll definitely be keeping this recipe!

You can make this dish a little lower in fat, yet with just as much flavor by using turkey sausage or ground seasoned turkey.  I generally dislike cabbage, but the first time I made this recipe we loved it so much that we had the dinner leftovers for breakfast.  Unless you like your pitas huge, this recipe makes closer to 8 servings.  Red pepper flakes add some needed color.

Having this for lunch today. Really good. I used homemade turkey sausage and instead of pita bread, I used a whole wheat tortilla.. made a batch, popped them in the freezer and just nuked one at work for lunch. I like the sweet/spicy combo with the sour cream.. really different

My whole family loved this! 4 stars because I personally think it needed tweeking: I used a 1 lb. tube of regular Jimmy Dean sausage, then 1 small head of cabbage, 2 small onions, and instead of the sugar, red pepper, and salt, I used seasoned salt to taste. I ended up using 1/2 cup sour cream. We will make again.

I had a head of cabbage from the garden & pound of pork sausage I needed to use, so I thought this looked like a simple solution. It was! The only thing that was even remotely "hard" was the effort in grating the cabbage--maybe 7 minutes. The first bite was alright & then it just seemed to get better & better with each bite! We used the new Earth Grains "Thin Buns" instead of pitas, but used halves & kind of wrapped them around the "filling" like a pita--fantastic!

This was delicious, fast, and easy. We didn't have pita bread so we just used toast and it was still yummy. We also added about a 1/4 cup more sour cream.

Definitely use less red pepper, as many suggested! I used around 1 - 1.5 tsp; and it was perfect. Since I have a few in my family that are not crazy about onions, I used green onion (chives) instead. My entire family loved this recipe, even the ones who don't normally like cabbage!

Wow...I just finished cooking this up, and although I haven't put it all together yet, the cabbage and sausage individually taste great! Together, I can only imagine how wonderful they will go together! (I'm just waiting for my husband to get home with the pitas so we can eat!) The only things I tweaked was using hot italian sausage and add some maple syrup when browing the meat. Delicious recipe! Thanks for sharing! (Guess we'll see what my biggest critics think!)

These were really good, something different. I did jazz it up a little to suit our tastes - but not too much, it's a nice simple dish. Thanks for the recipe - I never really think about pita, and now I will!

My family loved the recipe and I will definitely make it again.  It was filling and had that wholesome homemade feel.  It is spicy, but most of the family liked that.  For those who didn't, they just added more sourcream to their pitas and loved it.  I probably will add less red pepper next time just to humor my sister who likes things super bland. :-)  Great recipe!

my husband loved it.  didnt think it was too spicy and used exact measurements.  husband said even though full he wanted to keep eating for flavor.  i am less into spicy and i still thought a tablespoon of red pepper was fine, though mouth was hot.  he suggested left over i add shrimp and shaved carrot and make homemade eggrolls.  we had a lot of left over with four eating.  i will half recipe next time.

We LOVED this recipe!  I cut back on the red pepper a bit and used a bagged coleslaw mix.  Only took 10 minutes to melt the cabbage down.  Sour cream was excellent, stirred in.  Had to push the husband away from the stove, he was eating out of the skillet.  Pita bread was a nice change.  Will have these again and again.

I used hot italian sausage, and after reading the other reviews, only added one teaspoon of red pepper flakes. I added brown deli mustard to the pitas, and served with kettle chips. Absolute heaven. Thanks, Holly!

This recipe is the best tasting and easiest recipe I've prepared in a long time.  It's a great meal in itself.  I've made it three times and my dinner guests are always complimenting me on it.

I liked it, my husband didn't. I didn't like it as much when I tried to eat it without the pita. Is that weird? Somehow the pita made it all work for me! :)

This is a really quick meal to whip up and delicious as well.  I gave it five stars for ease in preparation and flavor.  I have made it with mild pork sausage a couple of times.   Once, to make it a little healthier I used turkey sausage, which did not have as much flavor.  No matter which sausage I used, I found it had a lot of spice with the pepper...I just need to remember to back off the hot pepper next time.  Whew!  It was a little bit too spicy, but darn it, these were addictive!!!  The sour cream balanced the spiciness, so that was a relief!  Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

My husband and I made this tonight for dinner and thought it was quite good. I am not a huge fan of sausage so we used 1 lb spicy ground sausage mixed with 1/2 lb ground beef. Based on previous reviews we used only 1 teaspoon red pepper. We thought it came out tasty without being at all spicy (we will use more red pepper in the future). We also used bagged coleslaw mix. We did find that the sausage/cabbage mix was a bit runny and we will try draining the cabbage after wilting next time to see if it helps. We also used gyro bread (and spread dijon mustard on the bread). This is a good recipe to try if you are looking for something quick and different. Thanks for sharing it with us.

Very good but cut down the red pepper flakes by at least  half if you don't want your mouth to burn. I didn't cut it down enough & my mouth was on fire! I had to drink a lot of milk & I added extra sour cream to my pita to help with the burning in my mouth. I used mild sweet Italian sausage. Thanks,

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe, but used a little less red pepper (to play it safe).  It tasted too much like the pork breakfast sausage, but we still enjoyed it.  But, I found a simple tweak that made the flavor better balanced, more Mediterranean-like, and not so strongly tasting of breakfast sausage.  I just used 1 12 oz. tube of Jimmy Dean Low-Fat sausage and  12 oz. of ground lamb.  It's healthier, and I think it's tastier.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was so surprised at how well this went over with the cabbage-haters in my family. It's frequently requested and because it's inexpensive, filling and very good, I make it often.

OMG I am so happy I re-found this recipe! I had made it about a year ago and it was delish! Bf and I were looking to make it again but couldn't find this exact recipe, and the replacement was nowhere near as yummy :/
 But this is fun and easy to make, and reminds me of tastes from home...can't wait to make it again!

I made this for the first time and will definitely be making it again.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I loved it.  After I tasted it, I immediately made some gyro cucumber sauce to go with it.  Letting the sauce chill for 2 hours was the longest wait ever, but so worth it.  I can't wait for lunch tomorrow so I can eat it again.

These were surprisingly yummy.  But the pepper, oh the pepper!! I can't give it more stars because the recipe as written has enough pepper to burn your mouth off.  I like spicy food, but ugh, this was too much!

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe.  I make my own Italian sausage using the "Hot Italian Sausage" recipe from Jim Wyllie that is posted on this site.  That's an excellent recipe.  I just scale it down to 1 pound of sausage since the original recipe makes twenty pounds.  The only thing I would change about this recipe is use less red pepper flakes.  1 Tablespoon was too much even though we like spicy foods.  It meant the main flavor was hot.  It's actually tasty so you want to taste the other flavors.  It's very quick and easy for supper.

This is a great recipe!  Seems strange until you try it but it has become a staple meal in our house.  I use turkey sausage and it tastes great.

Okay... so I listened to past posters and used a hot sausage. Big mistake. The pepper in the recipe is enough! It was so hot we couldn't even finish the meal. But I'm giving it 4 stars because it really is a good dish! Different flavor but easy to eat. Pork Sausage isn't just for breakfest. Will make again in it's original recipe form.

Excellent recipe.  If I cut down slightly on the pepper next time, my picky-eater children would even give it 5 stars.  Will be added to the rotation - thanks!!

These are great.I've made this several times since I found this recipe.Just make sure and use a good quality sausage. I thought the spiciness was just right.This recipe is worthy of my recipe binder.

This was soooo good!!!  & so easy to make!  Since my boyfriend doesn't care for spicy foods, I cut the pepper content in half; it still was pretty hot so next time I'll omit the pepper.  He said other than that he also really liked it & he is not easy to please!  We look forward to having this regularly!  Thank you!

My husband was the only one who liked this recipie.  I did not care for the taste at all.  I might try this again using hot italian sausage, but in my opinion it just tasted too "weird" with regular pork sausage.  Thanks anyway!

I attempted to convert this to a low-fat recipe by using turkey sausage and light sour cream.  I do this with many recipes and it usually works out fine.  Maybe it was because of my modifications, but this recipe didn't do anything for me.  It was just okay. We ate it, but I don't think I'll attempt to make it again.

One teaspoon of crushed red pepper was plenty hot enough for us.  These have a unique flavor and were good.  Just not quite a five star,in our opinion.

What a wonderful recipe!  Quick and simple is exactly right.  We don't like spicy so the red pepper wasn't added, that was the only change I made.  Next time I will try adding a small diced potato.  The sauce was a wonderful surprise.  I will be making this again and again.  Thank-you for submitting this recipe Holly!

Holly, I thought your receipe was just great.  I used turkey sausage instead of pork, used Splenda instead of "real" sugar and used only 1/2 tsp. of the red pepper flakes.  The turkey sausage was also high in cholestral, but felt it would take away from your recipe if I didn't use any at all.  Going to e-mail this to my daughter who is on the Atkins diet.

This was interesting. I'd just received an e-mail saying how good cabbage is for you, so I thought I'd give it a try. I added some poultry seasoning and a dash of mustard. The combo of the sausage and sugar made it have a tasty sweetness. My 7 year old refused to even try it. My eight year old tried it but that was it. My husband ate a double serving PLUS the kids uneaten food. AND he's taking the leftovers for lunch today. To each their own, I guess!

I've made this a few times and love it. I just reduce the red pepper to 1 tsp and instead of pitas I go with tortillas in a panini press.

Everyone in my family enjoyed this  recipe.  For  convienence, I used a package of cole slaw.  Since I was servng  this on a plate rather than in a pita, i omitted the sour cream.  As others suggested, Iserved this with potatoes.  WARNING:  The cooked cabbage left a terrible smell in the house!  Nex time, I will cook this outside on the grill side burner.

I made this tonight and it was a good midweek dinner.  I didn't have pita on hand so I used whole wheat flor tortillas and made wraps. The tortillas fell apart, so pita bread or pockets are definitely the way to go since they are thicker. We thought that this would be good on rice, brown or white.  I put 1/8th teaspoon of crushed red pepper, but it wasn't spicy at all.  I will make this again.

Love the flavor of this dish!  I crave it about 5 times a year!  It’s hearty and warm…and a great way to use cabbage in a flavorful way.  I made the recipe as is – if you know you don’t care for too much crushed red pepper head….just use less…pretty simple.  Thanks for the recipe Holly!

Delicious!  I'm glad I didn't use the 1 Tbsp of crushed red pepper.  I only used ½ tsp and it had a good medium-hot heat to it.  I also used about ½ lb of lean ground beef with 1 lb pork sausage and tortillas instead of pita since that's what I had on hand.  For a skeptical husband when he saw the recipe, he said to make it again and maybe even try some apple in it!

My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this recipe! I was very quick and easy to make, and delicious. Great as leftovers, too. It is quite spicy (we love spicy), so you may want to cut back on the pepper flakes if you don't like as much kick. Will make again and again!

These were fantastic. I only used 1 tsp red pepper.

My 6 year old said "This is great!"  Quite a rave review for cabbage.

Savory, sweet, and a bit spicy. Great combination of flavors, though I would decrease the sugar next time.
