Great simple recipe!  Took Ten minutes of prep time including the 5 minutes to let the flax seed thicken.  I did not use the liquid smoke, but everything else was left the same.  My wife made sure I saved the recipe to make it again.

These were really really yummy! I wanted to double the batch for lunches, but only had 1 can of black beans, so I added a can of red kidney beans as well. And then, because I had "scraps" left over from another meal, I added finely minced onion, green and red peppers, and mushrooms. Cooked in my cast iron skillet, these were easy, held together well, and very tasty! Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious! A hit with even my non-veggie friends and relatives.  Not to mention it's vegan!

I subbed chipotle powder (1 t) for liquid smoke and added chopped onions. Great recipe. Can't believe more restaurants won't step up their game on this. We served it on toasted bread w chipotle mayo (3 T mayo, one t chipotle powder) and cheese. Glorious!

WOW are these YUMMY!!!  I never write reviews but these were TOO good and they whipped up really quick.  I will never buy those super expensive veggie burgers again.   I did omit the liquid smoke and salt.   I also used quick cook oatmeal instead of the panko bread crumbs.  I also baked them on parchment paper instead of frying them.  I found that the recipe made three nice size burgers not four.

grateful for this recipe. it was quick, easy, and inexpensive, and turned out delicious. i used vegan worcestershire sauce and made a few adjustments for taste and convenience: slightly reduced the salt, used 1 tsp garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, added 1 tsp onion powder, and replaced the bread crumbs with the same amount of rolled oats. (first i lightly processed the oats into smaller pieces in the coffee grinder.) i meant to eat one, but i ate two, because i couldn't help it. looking forward to sharing this one. thanks!

Easy and delicious! I didn't have flax so I mixed 2 tsp tapioca starch into the bread crumbs and omitted the water. I also left out the extra salt and added onion powder. I dusted the patties in additional bread crumbs and pan fried them in 1/4 in. of oil for 2 min on each side. Great texture. The formed patties can be frozen for later, so why not make a double batch!

Tasty, but I discovered I don't think I really care for liquid smoke. For me next time I make these I'll leave it out and add some other seasonings. They were very quick to put together. I made 3 patties instead of 4 because they seemed kind of small

This was wonderful! I made it just as written. I was a little worried at first because the mixture was so wet, but the 1/2 hour in the fridge really did the trick! I served the patties on a bed of fresh spinach and topped them with some spicy-sweet red pepper and onion jam. Wowsers, was it every yummy and my teens loved it, too!  Thanks so much!

Finally, a black bean veggie burger that doesn't have a Mexican spin.  I like the use of flax and water instead of egg.  My husband took a bite and said "I think you're on to something with this one."  Easy to modify if you want, but great as is.  Thank you!

Flavor great. Burgers too moist. Cooked on tinfoil on grill. Extra cooking time to dry them out. Would use tablespoon less of water with ground flax seed, and either add more Panko or switch to oatmeal. Flavor is wonderful. Added onion powder and garlic powder, as well as minced garlic. A dash of hot sauce might boost it. But very good!

Key is to make thin burgers I think. Made last night and partied these out like regular thick burgers. Absolutely delicious and loved the bit of crunch on the outside of burger. But the middle was soft and if too big fell off the bun. Tonight taking the leftovers and making them thinner. Daughter not a big fan of black beans so added a can of dark kidney beans in as well. I did add some garlic powder but followed recipe otherwise. This was so much better then what I have tasted in some restaurants. A keeper and will make again!! I purchased the flax seed just for this recipe and glad I did since will be making again! Thanks for the recipe

This was not good at all.  I love black  beans, and I've had black bean burgers before.  This was mushy, lacked flavor, and generally unappetizing.  Definitely will not be making again.

Followed recipe except I added no salt  "dash seasoning" as well. And didn't chill for 30 minutes.  And I put a small piece of cheese on it, dill pickle and lite mayo!  (No bun) It was delicious!  Best bean burger I have personally had...

I found the Worcestershire to be too strong (I cooked a tiny burger to taste the flavor).  So, I ended up adding a half carrot, an extra clove of garlic and about a 1/4 of a minced onion.  No liquid smoke - because I' m not a fan and I didn't have any in the house.  Also added an egg so it held together better (not of course not vegan that way but I'm vegetarian so I didn't care).  My panko bread crumbs were rice based (what I had on hand).  Ended up baking them (it made three burgers this way) so that it would be cooked all the way through.  It was much better with my additions, but next time I'll still cut back on the amount of Worcestershire.

These "Smoky Black Bean Burgers" were very good (with and without garlic) - one of the best legume-based burgers I have tasted to date. Next time I make them I will try to remember to make them early in the day so that they are ready to cook when I am hungry. Thank you Brie Kress for sharing your recipe.

Tasty
Didn’t have the liquid smoke, so used smoke flavored olive oil in the pan.  I would probably add some diced peppers and onions next time, but still very good.

We use this recipe regularly. The recipe is  great as is. Some variations that we have tried and like include adding an egg. I add a little extra ground flax seed and bread crumbs to give more consistency. I sometimes double the liquid smoke to give it a little extra smokey flavor. I have also replaced the black beans with a three bean mixture.  I usually cook two of the patties the day I make them and freeze the other two for another day. Also I have found that they cook great in an air fryer. Just flip them half the way through.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I made them last night and I'm going back to the store today to get another can of black beans to make more! I served mine in pita bread with tomato slices and cheese. I don't think I'll ever eat turkey burgers again! So easy and inexpensive!

I'm a new vegetarian so I have been experimenting with different recipes. After searching for a black bean burger online I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try. The only modification I made was that I added more liquid smoke to give the burgers more flavor because the recipe as is didn't provide enough flavor for me. Once I did that, I absolutely loved them so I will definitely make them again.

Per the other reviews, I went light on the liquid smoke.  I think they’re great, and I’m not even a vegan!

Made these exactly as written.  I did not alter the recipe other than baking them instead of frying.  Made into 4 equal burgers, on a rack sprayed with no stick spray, 400 degrees 20 min, flipped and baked another 10 min.  Absolutely delicious!!  I will use a little more garlic and smoke in them but I am very pleased!  Finally a good hearty no meat burger!!!  Thank you for this recipe!

I didn't make any changes, followed the recipe to a T.  Both my son and I loved it.  He had his on whole wheat buns, with cheddar cheese slices and mustard and relish.  I had mine with mustard only.  I will definitely be making it again, so good!

Good recipe.  I found I don't care for the liquid smoke so next time will leave it out.  Also, I added a pinch of cayenne.  May add grated onion next time.

Serve with salsa and sour cream or chipotle mayo.

Made exactly as written and it was wonderful.  I did bake at 400 for 15 minutes instead of using the skillet, but other than that I followed it to the T.  It was nice to have a vegan burger that doesn't contain cumin and chili powder. My meat eating sister liked them as well.

Made these exactly per recipe but with about half the liquid smoke because I was scared.  They were delicious.  My 12 year old son and I loved them and we are meat eaters.  Next time I will add finely diced onion to the beans.  We ate them on toasted hamburger buns with ketchup, sharp cheddar cheese, sliced avocado and diced green onions.  YUM!

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  No one in my family was in love with it, and preferred regular ground beef burgers. A bit of a disappointment, based on the rave reviews I read -
 probably won't make again.

These where very bland in my families opinion.  Not sure what I expected from red meat eaters.  This surely wouldn’t please a meat eater if they were being honest.  I’ll personally save the Black Beans for my salads and wraps.

Very good I followed the recipe but I added my own seasoning like a tablespoon of sofrito and adobe instead of salt I gave it a Spanish twist. No bread we topped it with tomatoes ,lettuce and avocado slices. Very delicious

I thought that this was very good, and very simple. I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding the extra 1/2 tsp of salt. 
I made 1 sample patty and 4 burgers, which I will most likely air fry tomorrow, after I make hamburger buns. Since I make my hamburger buns larger, I did the bean burgers larger and flatter  than in the photo, as I like them better that way. 

I am on a special medical diet and can not have the usual Mexican spices 8( and can't have nuts. I really appreciated that this recipe didn't have them, or  oatmeal or quinoa in it-more can't have items. I thought the flax seed egg substitute, which I have been wanting to try, and just haven't, worked really well, and it makes it very easy to adjust any spices in the mix before you cook the sample, as you can taste the raw mix. 

I plan to use this with other kinds of beans, as I don't always make bean burgers with black beans-cannellini beans work really well too. 

This will be a regular, and thank you very much for the recipe, Brie, you did an excellent job.

I did not have flax seed, so I used one egg as a binder.  I also let the entire mixture sit in the fridge before forming the patties.  It was much easier to shape them that way.  Prior to resting in the fridge, the mixture was a bit loose but it did set up nicely.  These were excellent!  Served them with avocado slices on top.  Yum!

I used garlic salt instead of the minced garlic and the salt. Everything else was the same. I really enjoyed it. My husband said it needed a little more flavor so I may add a smidge more Worcestershire and liquid smoke flavor to it next time but will definitely make again.  Not quite the flavor of a burger, but didn't taste like a plain can of black beans either.  Nice change from turkey burgers since we don't eat red meat. Recommended to my mom. She loves anything with black beans.

I thought this recipe was outstanding. Added a little more liquid smoke. Also I like to add some crushed walnuts to give a "meaty" texture.  I am planning to make several dozen and vacuum seal and freeze.

Yummy little black bean burgers that take less than 10 minutes to make. Didn’t have the liquid smoke as mentioned in the recipe but it turned out good anyways. I lacked ground flax seed so I used wheat germ in place. Doubling up on the garlic is a good idea here as well
