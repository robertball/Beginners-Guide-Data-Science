Delicious! Just enough tartness with a touch more lemon juice for my palate.

Nice drink! I played around with the proportions a little too much and made it a bit sour, but that's my own fault. Still quite good.

thats not true. you can get lonkeros in the usa. there is a brand called long drink that makes it in cans, just like finland. the company is run by an american and three finns, so it is correct.  ive had it myself its pretty tasty. also the most popular finnish brand, hartwall, is slowly becoming available in the usa. look for these. of course, its quite easy to make yourself.

Try your favorite gin with Mt Dew Ice or MT Dew White Out, I prefer 50/50 but I might pour heavy, 1:2 to 1:1 works just fine. The N.Y. version is more club soda vs the Finnish version has more grapefruit.
