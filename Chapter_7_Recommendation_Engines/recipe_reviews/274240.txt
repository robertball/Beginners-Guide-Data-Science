I really enjoyed this for breakfast, but can also see it as a great pack lunch for work! Love banana and PB together, but never had it in oatmeal. I didn't have chia or pumpkin seeds but did throw a few toasted walnuts on top, and the best yogurt choice flavor in the fridge was maple, which was a nice combination. It was creamy and flavored just perfectly!  Thank you Mrs Gator Williams
