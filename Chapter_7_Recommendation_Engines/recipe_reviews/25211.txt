Ok, seriously yummy. The kids wanted doughnuts this morning and we amazed them by whipping up a batch in less than 40 minutes. One suggestion I have for making this recipe is make sure your dropping the batter in the oil in the "level tablespoon" size and no larger...otherwise, you've got a yummy looking raw-in-the-middle dough ball.  The tablespoon amount of batter gives you a "doughnut hole" sized doughnut.  Also, drain them on a paper bag instead of papertowel...it tends to keep them crisper since the papertowel creates a "steaming" effect.  Cheers!

I did use homemade spiced apple butter instead of unsweetened applesauce. Right out of the oil, I tossed the hot donut holes in cinnamon/sugar mix. These are addictive little suckers. Between the three of us, we made quick work of these spiced donut holes. The kids keep talking about them and how unbelievably good they are--HUGE hit here. Next time I make these, I'd like to try another submitter's idea and try pumpkin puree in place of the applesauce. I bet that would be AWESOME. NOTE: Using one of those spring loaded cookie dough scoops to make uniform balls and to drop into the hot oil works really well. Try that. Much easier than trying to manuver a tablespoon and a spoon.

Very tasty, and I will make them again.  I substituted canned pumpkin measure for measure for the applesauce successfully.  I also added a bit more milk to make a runnier batter and used a doughnut batter dropper to get real doughnuts with holes.

This was not the recipe that I was looking for, but tried it anyway. WOW! My husband has made me promise not to make them again soon because he couldn't stop popping them! I followed recipe and advice from reviews, using pumpkin instead of applesauce but also added finely chopped apple to the batter. I used a candy thermometer with a pan on the stove, which seemed to work best below 375 degrees- more like 325-355. Also, small teaspoons of dough instead of larger sized doughnuts allowed the centers to cook better for me. This recipe wil be used often in the fall, particularly while DH is working and the kids can get some! Thanks for posting it for us!

These were my first attempt at making doughnuts and they turned out nicely.  My husband really liked them and has been snacking on them all day. They weren't quite as appley as I'd expected and I think that they would taste better rolled in a cinnamon sugar mixture. I had a hard time dropping them into the oil as perfect doughnut holes, so some of mine were a little mis-shapen but oh-well. I think I may make these again, probably in the fall when apple cider is in season. Thanks for a nice recipe!

Excellent! However, for those of us who have just started cooking, I would like to share the mistakes I made: 1) unsweetened apple sauce means unsweetened! I had to go look for a recipe to make the sauce, and it had sugar there, thus the extra sugar burnt in the frier, and I had to start all over. 2)Sugar is not in the dry ingredients category. I didn't read through the instructions carefully, and added the sugar with the dry stuff, and so had nothing to beat the eggs with thus the fluff never came.   Still hard to understand how friers work. Had it on the right temperature and all, but the outsides started browning while the insides were still wet. Plus the doughnuts soaked up too much oil. I read that adding half a teaspoon of vinger (carefully)  to the hot oil will help prevent that. Will try it next time.
BUT this recipe found its way to our tummies, hearts and the recipe box. Will make it again and again!

The first batch looked terrible but by the second batch I got the hang of it and they actually looked like doughnuts.  I also rolled the doughnuts in cinnamon sugar.  Next time I make I am going to use chunky applesauce for more texture.  Thanks

This was a delicious and quick desert/breakfast plus you feel a little healthy with the applesauce. I used a little whole wheat flour for another healthy addition and probably could have used more. The tip about using a paper sack instead of paper towel worked very well for added crispness. And a side note, if you use this batter on a skillet, it makes delicious mini pancakes as well! We liked ours with cinnamon sugar best!

We called these "Alien Donuts" for our boys. Big hit, easy to make. I added a little more flour trying to get them to congeal more, hence the name, but the boys ate 6 each, calling out each creature, crab alien, bear alien, etc.

These things were awesome! I followed the recipe exactly as it is. I suggest that you do not make a lot at a time because you will eat them all in one sitting. They are so good!

The BEST doughnuts ever! I rolled the fried doughnuts in a mixture of sugar and cinnamon. They disappeared really fast at my house. Kids were asking to make them again the next day! Will use this recipe again!

Excellent flavor! But there must be a trick to adding the batter to the oil; most of mine just imploded and became snakes rather than balls. I added cinnamon sugar right after pulling them out of the oil...Mmmm!

They taste exactly like a doughnut hole shaped pumpkin muffin - good, but not what I was looking for.  I am going to make them again, adding a cup of ricotta cheese for richness and NO cloves or nutmeg.  I guess I wanted apple fritters.

Not one for deep fat frying, I mixed up these doughnuts for my daycare kids, with the vanilla but completely without the spices, and fried them on a griddle sprayed with cooking spray. I had the griddle about 325 degrees, fried them well and sprinkled with powdered sugar and the kids ate them like there was no tomorrow. Great recipe!

These were great! I used cinnamon flavored applesauce just because I like the extra spices.  Moist and tender donut holes. This is a keeper.

This is the new favorite recipe in our house. I cooked mine in a deep fryer. We dipped some in powdered sugar and some in cinnamon and sugar. This is a must keep recipe.

I adapted the recipe a little to include apple butter, because I didn't have any cloves or nutmeg -- but it worked masterfully! Very excellent recipe, and I've never even made donuts before!

I used an extra 1/2 Cup of whole wheat flour and added big chunks of apple.  Used a small pampered chef ice cream scoop and got perfect sized donut holes.  Everything else was by the book.  Great recipe!

My husband and I were in the mood for doughnuts tonight so I made these.  I must say I am so impressed they were easy and quick to make.  I didn't have cloves in my pantry so used allspice instead and it did very well. Yummy:)

Very easy to make and a great recipe for the apple picking time of year when you have lots of apples and your running out if recipes!  After a few doughnuts I was able to get them to come out like a doughnut hole by using a small cookie scoop to drop batter into oil.  Before that I had a few interesting shaped doughnuts.  I also rolled them in a cinnamon sugar mixture while they were still warm.  Thanks for sharing.

The best! perfect flavour! My husband said they're "better than timbits"!
I lightly dusted them with icing sugar, but they're still scrumptious without anything.

This is awesome!  I did change it slightly... I used half whole wheat flour and chunky apple sauce.  The balance of flavors was perfect!  It reminded me of the doughnuts we used to walk to the bakery early in the morning to get!

Thank you for sharing!

I am not normally one for writting reviews but today I felt compelled. I made these donuts almost exactly to recipe, the only difference was I used cinnamon applesauce instead of unsweetened, and they came out absolutely delicious but no matter what I did I could not make them resemble munchkins as the dough was too runny.

Since I was out of applesauce I used pumpkin instead.  I thought they turned out fine giving it 3 stars - but since my kids loved them I gave the recipe 4 stars.  We liked them best with a simple maple glaze on top.

These could be called applesauce spiced doughnuts; you taste more of the spices than the applesauce.  I did have an idea that was going to happen, though, from all the reviews I read.  I don't like frying foods; it's rather time consuming and I don't digest fried foods well.  Instead of frying, I used my new Wilton doughnut pan to bake the doughnuts.  It took about 6-7 minutes at 425 but they came out rather nice.  I thought about dipping in sugar; but with baking I'd have to brush with something, perhaps butter or margarine, to accomplish that, and I wasn't in the mood last night.  Maybe next time.  This is a very forgiving recipe; I accidently switched the amounts of baking powder and baking soda and still got a decent batch of doughnuts.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are good/ok.  I would make them again if I had the applesauce.  I wouldn't go get the applesauce to make them.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't have a fruity taste. I think my expectation of what these would taste like caused me to not like them as much as I could.  A way to add fruit to your diet.  Good freshly baked, not so good after about 6 hours.

I got a new mini fryer for Christmas and thought this would be fun to try.  I followed the recipe exactly, and what came out was nothing like what I know as doughnuts, rather they were fried spice bread holes.  And I couldn't taste the apple sauce at all.  Spice bread fresh from the oven actually tastes better than this fried version.

These were great. I only added the cinnamon and I increased the vanilla to 1 tsp. Just my preference. I only had sweetened applesauce so I decreased the white sugar a little. I didn't have a candy thermomator so I adjusted the temperature a couple of times. Mine also came out shaped oddly too.  Definitley not holes but super tastey none the less.
Light and crisp. I also drained on brown bag and stored any left overs in small brown lunch bag.
It was great because it didn't involve yeast and rolling out dough.
Thanks for the super easy recipe!

Very good. Followed the recipe (besides I forgot to add the oil until I reviewed the recipe before puting the batter into the pot) and I didnt use four cups of oil and it still came out well! All i must say is that you should not expect the dough to be perfectly round like munchkins when they come out. I rolled mine in a cinammon sugar combo and enjoyed.

Terri, these donuts were wonderful, however, weirdly shaped. Don't know what they're supposed to look like as some of mine came out quite interesting! I had one that looked like a fried chicken leg, one like an octapus, a couple of jelly fish and a squid to boot!! HA! No matter, they were fantastic. I decided to use cake flour for this recipe, used a very small ladel instead of the spoon and while still warm, dipped them into a cinnamon and sugar mixture. To make life easier, I suggest purchasing a candy thermometer in order to make sure your oil is at the correct temp. It really helps. Again, these were great Terri and daughter Ty and I thank you!!

These were good served immediately but the next day had to be thrown out as they were soft and gummy. I followed the recipe exactly. They also absorbed a ton of oil!!!

These were yummy! The kids enjoyed helping to make these and were rewarded with a sweet breakfast treat. I used about 1/2- 3/4 can of pumpkin purée in lieu of the applesauce and kept everything else the same. Delicious! I used my small cookie scooper and it took about 3-4 mins to cook each batch and then I shook them in cinnamon sugar mix in a brown lunch bag to top them off. It makes a lot of munchkins- about 2 1/2-3 dozen in total. These were a bit heavier than a traditional donut but still a nice alternative to the standard breakfast. Thanks for the recipe!

OH MY!! So easy and so good. I didn't have any applesauce so I put one large apple (cored but not peeled) through my food processor then cooked it over medium-low heat while I assembled the rest of the ingredients. I only made two recipes tweeks. Adding a little extra milk does make the batter easier to control. I made a powdered sugar glaze, but it made the doughnuts too sweet. Next time I'll follow the recipe and make the cinnamon sugar topping. I'll be making these again, the recipe is spot on!!

WOW.  I've tried several different doughnuts over the decades and my preference has always been my grandmother's recipe, but I wanted to try a recipe that didn't require waiting for yeast to rise and cutting.  I have been converted!  I made a few modifications because my son has several food intolerances, so I made it conform to Feingold S1 by swapping out the applesauce for pear sauce and omitting the cloves, and I shook them in cinnamon sugar.  Yummy!  This is definitely getting added to my rotation of snacks!  For the record, I fried half in oil and baked half in the BabyCakes donut maker, and all but my 2-year old preferred the ones fried in oil.

I used fresh ground flour (wheat, oats, brown rice), and slightly reduced the sugar. At first, I made them too big and with the oil at 375, they burned on the outside and were dough in the middle. I reduced the temp and then made them with tablespoon drops, and they were ok, but they soaked up so much oil I felt a little sick. So... I broke out my corn dog maker to finish off the rest of the batter. MUCH better! I will likely make this recipe again, but I will bake it like muffins or use my corn dog maker or other electric cooker to cook it instead of frying these.

just made these this morning to try to use up the rest of last year's applesauce. They are awesome! I omitted the cloves, as a matter of personal taste, and I used my cookie scoop to get the batter in the oil. when they were done, I drained them briefly on paper towels, then rolled them in cinnamon sugar.  one cup of sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon was just about perfect to coat all of the donut holes. now that I have this recipe, we will no longer have to buy the expensive donuts at the apple orchard! Thank you!

These are the best doughnuts I've ever had! I doubled the amount of cinnamon, but kept everything else the same.  I baked them in a doughnut maker I had for about 8-10 minutes until a cake tester cake out clean.  I pulled the doughnuts out with chop-sticks and rolled them in sugar cinnamon! It was really hard to stop myself from eating more than I should... I got about 3 dozen using my maker which is a little larger than standard doughnut holes you'd get at the store. They were so fluffy & the first recipe I've tried in the maker that actually raised to fill the wells.

I followed the recipe exactly, but baked the doughnuts.  I cooked them at 375 degrees for 8 minutes.  I won't cook them as long next time, they were a little dry compared to the description, but tasted great.  My daughter also wanted to taste the apple, not all the spices, so I will cut back on those, even though I really liked them, and increase the amount of apple sauce so the apple flavor is what you taste and it's more moist since I'll definitely bake them again.  I'll also sprinkle sugar on them next time.

I feel like you need to heat the oil to 300 or it burns. Also I just used Apple Pie spice and no applesauce or pumpkin and they were pretty good

Ok, so I stupidly followed the review that said carefully add a tsp of vinegar to the oil.  DO NOT DO THIS!!  It exploded hot grease all over my kitchen.  Luckily it did not catch on fire or get my little girl who was across the room, but almost.  Other than that, and cleaning the kitchen for 3 hours, and it's still gross, this recipe was good.

great flavor, easy to make, first time I've made donuts and I had success.  Smaller is better so they fry quickly.  We didn't get 60 from this recipe, but my family of 7 had plenty of leftovers (ate 2/3 fresh).

I followed this recipe exactly as written, yet still had very doughy doughnuts.  Even the small ones were doughy inside.  Won't be using this recipe again.

Not really apple-flavored at all, was it supposed to be? I never had applesauce donuts before so I'm not sure how they should taste. Anyway, if I make them again, I will at least put more cinnamon and nutmeg to have the apple spices and pretend that it tastes like apple instead of just dough. =)

Didn't have cloves in the house, turned out great.  Next time will dust with powdered sugar.  Quick & easy when you want donuts!

These were delicious.  I rolled them in cinnamon sugar.  My kids absolutely loved them.  I liked that it made a lot as they never seem to get enough of homemade doughnuts.  Next time I will add more cinnamon and nutmeg along with some ginger.

We were mixed on these. Batter was kindof thin, made ithard to drop in oil. They were more cake like then we were expecting (We were hoping for a lighter fritter style consistency) I rolled them while hot, in cinnamon-n-sugar. Served these with homemade hot fudge sauce II from this site and I think that is what made them good. Alone, they aren't that great.........not bad, just not to our liking! Should be eaten within a few hours of making.

All I can say is "thank you". These are so good. All my kids loved them. It made a bunch so we will have some left for breakfast. I used a batter dispenser to make donut shape but I think the holes would be even better. Will try that next time. this recipe is a keeper!!

Excellent!  In making this I learned I had run out of nutmeg...but they tasted great without it!  My husband and daughter loved 'em!  They're even better when you dip 'em in sugar!
