This was delicious! I didn't have fresh onions, so I substituted French's fried onions. Not so healthy I know, but I think the coating on the onions did the trick to thicken up the sauce.  There was no need to cook with cornstarch, and I sprinkled some of the onions on top when I removed the foil.  Very crispy and delicious! Thanks for the recipe! Will make again!

Simply delicious! I took another reviewer's advice and seasoned and seared the chops before covering them with the sauce mixture and putting them in the oven. I followed the remaining directions and the chops turned out great! I paired them with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Juicy and tender pork chops along with delicious fresh veggies!  I didn't thicken the sauce with the cornstarch just because I was starving and was ready to eat. I was still able to use the sauce on rice, though. It was just a little thin.

I don't comment very often but my husband loved this recipe. I usually use the recipes I find on here as starter recipes and tweak them to our tastes. This one I followed pretty close and the taste was very good. I used golden mushroom soup (I think it has more flavor)canned mushrooms and added some minced garlic and a little Dijon mustard. Served with rice and a green salad delish. Husband wants this often, thanks for sharing.

I browned the pork chops on both sides (I'm a little skeeved out about cooking raw pork in with a sauce I'm going to eat as a gravy--it's not reflective of the recipe, just a personal preferance) and sauteed the onion and mushrooms in a little butter, then added the soup before pouring it over the pork chops in the pan. I skipped the cornstarch step only because I wanted a little thinner "gravy". Not a bad dish. It reminds me of something my Mom would have made for me as a kid. I'd make this again but I'd goose it up a bit next time.

I seared my chops with salt, pepper and garlic powder first.  With searing, the cooking time was much less- I don't know how long as I left in an cooking thermometer so I don't set a timer.  Didn't use cornstarch, I thought the gravy was a good consistency for this meal. Tasty and quick meal!  *Edit* I've now cooked this a few times, and I actually think I like it better on the stove, I sauté the onions and mushrooms put them off to the side, then brown the seasoned pork chops, once they are almost done I add cream of mushroom and the sautéed veggies, turns out great!  I've also tried it with Campbell's golden mushroom and it adds a great taste too!

I definitely ended up making this "unhealthy", but it was pretty good. I prepared the chops in a pan - searing like others advised (in butter). I also sprinkled Lawry's, Italian seasoning, Old Bay's, powdered sage, garlic powder, and pepper on the chops. I sauteed the onions in butter and then added condensed mushroom soup to them, along with chicken stock (about 1 cup or so), a dash of Lawry's, pepper, garlic powder, and sage. Poured the mixture over the chops in pan. Simmered the combo on low for 35 minutes. My four-year-old daughter tore it up!

tried this recipe for my daughter and I tonight.  I did modify it by adding 1/2 a large onion and about 2 tablespoons minced garlic (pureed) and adding it to the soup mix. WE LOVED IT....

I didnt use the cornstarch,and used canned mushrooms. Tasted excellent! Next time wont cook for so long-chops were a little tough. Think it would be excellent over rice or egg noodles.

Easy and delicious! Seared the chops with a rub, and sautéed the mushrooms and onion. I have never seen 'natural' cream of mushroom soup (I even googled it to see what it was..), so used condensed instead. Served it with brown rice and steamed French beans. Definitely a keeper.

Very good! I didn't do the last step (making the sauce). I simply used what was in the pan to spoon over rice and it was awesome. I used canned mushrooms rather than fresh. Will be adding this to my recipe box!

My picky boyfriend loved this recipe. I sauteed small portobello mushrooms and onions, browned the pork chops tossed in a can of condensed mushroom soup and cooked in the oven for 30 minutes covered and 15 min uncovered. I made some Jasmine rice for it be put over. I added french onions the last 5 minutes and it was very tasty!!

It was a hit, even with my picky eater. The only thing I changed was I added a couple drops of worchester sauce to the gravy.

This is a great recipe! Easy to follow and make. I've made it twice now and the second time I added just a little dry thyme to the pork chop seasoning.

Excellent sauce!  Since I did not have too much time I made this recipe in the pressure cooker, also because I'm  always afraid they will become dry.  Here is what I did:  season them with a little complete seasoning in powder or salt and pepper, if you want.  Brown the pork chops in the same pot of the pressure cooker, in a little olive oil and in small batches.   Then  add the soup, onions, mushrooms, a little of Herbs de Provance (this is s mixture of spices) and 1/2 cup of water along with all the browned chops.  After 15 minutes of pressure, put the  chops in a serving plate and add the mixtufe of cornstarch, as the recipe says, to the pot to thicken the sauce a little in medium heat.  When ready pour  the sauce over the chops and....voilá!,
Super tender, moist pork chops in a rich brown mushroom sauce that looks very gourmet.  Try it!

i followed this recipe and it turned out great.  the pork was tender, the sauce thickened quickly, and the fresh mushrooms worked well to add water to the soup.  i was really doubtful while assembling this but i was really happy with the end result.  the second time i made it i think it could have cooked a little longer because the pork hadn't quite tenderized enough.  oh well, i'll check it better before i deem it finished....

I browned the chops first, 5 mins per side and then put them in the prepared casserole dish.  I sautéed the mushrooms, onion and garlic then added the cream of mushroom to the mix heating it for a few minutes prior to pouring on the chopped.  The sauce was delicious and did not require thickening after baking the chops in it for 45 minutes.  It turned out tender and tasty.  I will definitely save this as a favourite.

Found this to be a good recipe especially if your trying to eat a little healthier and lose weight.  I also cooked the chops to almost done as did another due to preference with raw meat and simmered ingredients for sauce on the stove top until time to pour over chops.  Only other change was I just used salt, pepper and garlic powder to season chops and added some diced fine minced garlic to the sauce.  Thanks for sharing.

I was more liberal with the seasoning and I added a clove of fresh chopped garlic that I spread over the chops. Only cooked for 3 people so the cook time needed was much less. Very tasty! We've made the original Golden Pork Chops as well and both are big hits in our home!

I made these chops and I must say it was one of the most favorable dishes I have had in a long time. I did make one addition. I added chopped bell pepper along with the onions.

Usually, the AR ratings are pretty reliable, but this one stumped me. It's not bad, but at 4.5 stars, I expected something special. If you like cream of mushroom soup recipes, this is another one. Easy, but not particularly quick.

Made this tonight for dinner it was amazing. Although I saved some onions and mushrooms and sautéed them (even though I ate half of them before the pork chops were done)and put on before serving. I think it just made it 10x better.

I lil disappointed, the meat boils  in the soup and makes a lot of juice even when u put the cornstarch. So I don't really like it that much. I could probably make the chops separately in the pan and just add the sauce.

This is good!  I added a few enhancements -- a little sour cream and sherry to the soup mixture and as others suggested, fried onions on top during the last 15 minutes of baking.  Otherwise, followed the recipe and I was happy with results. Didn't bother with the corn starch.

I made this tonight, however, I did not add the mushrooms as I don't like the texture. I also substituted the onions with minced onion. I did not add the cornstarch and found adding the sauce over rice delicious! I added green beans to the side. It was delicious!

This recipe was ok. It was kind of too oniony for me. my husband did like it but I dont think he loved it.
