This is very good, but a little on the tart side once you get near the end of the pitcher. I think it would be just as good without the grapefruit, or with pink lemonade concentrate instead of yellow to fix this bitterness.

Pretty good, a little sour so I added about 1/4 c sugar to it.

My family and I found this too tart, it really needs sugar added.
