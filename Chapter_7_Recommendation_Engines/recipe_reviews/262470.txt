Really easy and delicious recipe.  But I think we could have just gone with the rub and it would have been just as much.   I don't think the additional bbq sauce is needed.

UNBELIEVABLE ! They turned out SO good!  I have to be honest.. I never thought an Instant Pot could rival the ribs made on the grill. 
I followed the recipe but only had one rack.  I took a chance and set the IP for the time called for in the recipe.   They were perfect!  Fall off the bone, moist, and full of flavor.
I added 1 TBSP of liquid smoke which I seen on another AR recipe and it was perfect!
Ya gotta try this One!

I left out the hot spices. Just a personal choice.
Will definitely make this again. One of my favorite Insta pot meals. 
Made corn on the cob first wrapped them in foil and set them on the side of the grill.  Then cooked the ribs the meat fell of the bone. Everyone loved it!

Made exactly as written and they were incredible. The dry rub is really good, not too spicy, and made enough for 2 racks, which I did in 2 batches in the Instant Pot.  I made them, put them on a foil-lined pan, then covered them.  Just before we ate, I covered them in BBQ sauce and put them under the broiler until the sauce was bubbling.  We didn't eat until much later, so they were just a little bit dry by then. Next time I may pressure them for a couple less minutes, but they could have been dry because they sat for so long. Recipe is excellent and well written.

My family loved these.  They were super tender and flavorful. I have the 6 qt so I could only fit 1 rack at a time. I will make these again.

Best ribs ever! Lifting out of pot they fell oof the bones! One very picky perfectionist family member said they were perfect. I was stunned!!! Plan on making next weekend again.I recommend following Receipt exactly as stated.

Another winner for the Instant Pot!  I've been grilling and smoking ribs for decades.  These are very good and fast.  The fat renders well (I was suspicious).   I'll try my rub and sauce next time, but again, these were very good.

Followed  the recipe as written with one substitution. Used Stevia instead of Brown sugar to make it lower in Carbs. Very good ribs! I will make them again.

I used one rack and cooked for 20 min.  Falling off bone tender and delicious.  Shortened prep time with store bought barbecue & mesquite dry rubs.  Added a little brown sugar for luck.   My husband & I loved them!

Turned out pretty good but needed an extra 15 minutes of cook time and I think it would be better with Sweet Baby Rays sauce.

I used more smoked paprika and less chili powder.  Finished mine on the grill as my oven was in use.  They were wonderful!

Ribs in an Instant Pot? Seriously? Everyone I knew with one raved how good they turned out. I was super skeptical because I’m still new to the IP. However, I gave this a try and OMG! AMAZING!!! I forgot the apple cider and they were still good, but I’m not forgetting when I make them again because I believe that will just add to the flavor. I’ve NEVER had success with at home ribs ever before. My husband couldn’t believe it. If he hadn’t seen me making them he would’ve said I’d gotten takeout somewhere. And he’d have wanted to know where because these just became some of the best ribs he’d ever eaten!

WOW!!!  For months my multi-cooker sat on the shelf because I was afraid to try it.  With recipes and explicit instructions like this one, who needs to be afraid.  These ribs were phenomenal.  I used one long rack of ribs and followed the instructions to the letter.  The meat was falling off the bone and the flavor.....to die for.  This will be my go-to recipe from here on out.

This recipe is awesome!!! Very easy to follow especially for someone like me who is the WORST cook in the world lol! The ribs were indeed falling off the bone. I used the "Ribs" function on my pressure cooker which cooked them for about 40 minutes. Then I added some bbq sauce and placed them in the oven uncovered for about 10 minutes and they were still very tender and delicious! Next time I will add a little more seasoning or a different recipe. But other than that they were perfect, thanks!

Fall Off The Bone Ribs indeed! My family of meat eaters and Barbeque connoisseurs gave these 2 thumbs up! I made a few changes along the way: I was in a rush so I didn't bother removing the membrane from the ribs... not a problem.  The meat was tender. I didn't add the brown sugar or cover with barbeque sauce because we don't eat sugar....again, not a problem. The ribs were savory, tender and very flavorful! As the recipe stated, I finished them up by putting them under the broiler just to evaporate the liquid and put a crust on top.  My one recommendation would be to cover the raw ribs in the rub a few hours before cooking them, letting them absorb the flavors.

This recipe was easy to make
And turned out amazingly well. 
The instant pot did the work of making the ribs super tender. I loved the dry rub
And I actually let the dry rub
Marinate on the ribs in the fridge for about 1/2 hour. 
Everyone loved them!

I used boneless ribs. The ribs were tender and juicy. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is that it was a little on the spicy side with the chili powder (I didn't when use as much as it called for) and pepper. Next time we'll probably remote the chili powder all together. Otherwise they were delicious.

Excellent recipe, the ribs came out amazingly tender. I kept the seasoning basic using salt, pepper, garlic granules and onion powder, used a honey BBQ sauce to finish under the broiler.

Well, 25 minutes in my Instant Pot wasn't quite enough.  It was cooked, but not that soft. There is no option for "high" on my Instant Pot - there's only 1 temp it gets to.  I made it without the sugar, and ate some with bbq sauce, some without.  Personally, I didn't really care for the taste of the chili powder on the ribs, but perhaps combined with more sugar, it would be more tasty!    But I don't generally eat sugar.  Next time, I'd leave out the chili powder, increase the salt, and maybe increase the smoked paprika.

So easy and fast.  But really, if you have your own rub, you can just follow the cooking instructions with the water and vinegar in the bottom and go from there.

I used apple juice instead of water and eliminated the sugar. 
I popped them on the grill for 5 minutes instead of putting them in the oven.
The texture was great. I will be adjusting the spices a little to make it more to my liking. I will add some cayenne pepper next time.
I will make them again.
