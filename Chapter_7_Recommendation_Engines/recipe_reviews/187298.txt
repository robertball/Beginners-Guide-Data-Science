Okay, this was an okay attempt at chocolate gravy, but I had to tweak it.  I live in the south and we take chocolate gravy very seriously.  I had to increase the cocoa to about 1/2 cup instead of 1/4, and I had to add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt to give it some flavor.  I was surprised to find this recipe didn't have any salt listed.  It was good after those two things.

This is exactly same recipe handed down through generations of my mother's southern family.  We've never had it written down, so there's always too much inconsistency and variation.  Thanks for putting measurements to this!    I do always add a dash of salt and a bit more butter to mine than is called for here.   When I was a little girl, all my friends wanted to spend the night so they could have Chocolate Gravy for breakfast.  My kids have introduced several of their friends to it as well....looks like the tradition is in no danger of dying out anytime soon!

My husband says this is the closest to what his grandmother in Kentucky used to make for them whrn they were kids...  I did add a bit more cocoa - about 1/3 c rather than the 1/4 c.  He wanted it with biscuits and that is what he got!  He was in heaven.

Super good! I did follow another reviewers advice and increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup and added some salt. It was perfect! And of course, the kids loved it :)

This tastes exactly like what my parents made me growing up! I am so glad I found this recipe! I even eat this on my scrambled eggs and bacon! I know that sounds gross, but "don't knock it 'til ya try it!"

Really good! I wasn't sure what to expect with this but paired it with the South Georgia Biscuits recipe from this site. After the second bite, both my kids and I were hooked. We all had a second helping. This gravy is very rich so it is quite filling. Thanks for a fun, easy breakfast!

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. I TOO HAD IT AS A CHILD. NOW I WILL HAVE IT OFTEN.
Those people that said it was "almost" like they remember, probably had fresh, whole, non pasteurized milk WHEN THEY WERE A CHILD.        . I DID.

LOVE this! My best friend's mom would make this for us when we were growing up. I had been looking for a recipe similar to hers for awhile and this is it, right on the money! Smooth and creamy without being watery or runny. Great chocolate flavor and the leftovers store well in the fridge to be warmed up the next morning. Also yummy on waffles :)

Same recipe my mom used to use - maybe with a bit less sugar.  Just a hint on "What to have it on?"    When I was a child, we used to have this on winter Sunday evenings when the family got together after a busy Sunday on the farm.  We had it ladled over fried potatoes with accompanying toast and scrambled eggs.

We enjoyed this a lot. It is really rich, so the last few times I've made it I've made both the chocolate and also some plain sausage gravy for the faint at heart. I've found that it's just a little too sweet and "dessert-y" for some.  It's a fun thing to include in my breakfast rotation.

This recipe is super easy and very yummy! Being from Alabama, this is a childhood favorite of mine. It's chocolaty but not overly sweet.

This is great!  I increased the cocoa to 1/3 cup and like others added a pinch of salt. I may add a tad more sugar next time. Super easy to make.

My Tennessee Granny didn't answer the phone so here I am! (not that she has a written recipe anyway and I'll definitely mess up a "pinch of this, dash of that")  This is pretty close to perfect.  After making and devouring it I read the other reviews. In hindsight, the other reviewers are not wrong when they say they added a little extra coco and salt.   Still, it was just what my pregnant Southern self was craving.  The way we eat it, 6 servings is for 6 biscuits, not 6 people.  Enjoy,  ya'll!

Unbelievable! I'm 47 yrs old and this recipe tastes exactly the same as the chocolate gravy my grandma used to make me over 40 yrs ago in the hills of East Tn. I haven't had it in several years and tonight I decided to make it and it turned out great. It was delicious, especially on my homemade buttermilk biscuits, and my wife and my two daughters loved it just as much as I did. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I think this is an awesome recipe.  Doesn't need any changes but I do play with stuff out of curiosity.  Have found a dash of cinnamon makes it even more amazing or a couple tablespoons of peanut butter.

IT WAS AMAZING! So smooth, I did add the 1/4 tsp of salt like other reviewers, it was just like I remember as a kid, not pudding like at all, some recipes taste like warm pudding instead of gravy, this is the recipe I've been waiting for, I too have gotten recipes handed down from generations, but no exact recipe so glad to see someone put it on this site!

this is good but I have two tips to add, boil the milk first then add the sugar flour and cocoa mixture. Also make sure you use powdered/confection sugar. Other than that this is a great breakfast just like my mother makes. :-)

I made this recipe and it is THE BEST chocolate gravy I've ever had.  I've made other recipes and eaten it before from different places and they do not come close, there is no comparison. It is the perfect thickness, the perfect sweetness. Awesome!!! I heated up the leftover the next morning and put it on a leftover biscuit-still great.

I can't tell you how long I've been searching for this recipe.  I've tried old friends from my school days in Guin, Alabama.  I loved chocolate gravy, but couldn't find anyone that knew exactly how to make it.  Thank you again!

Wonderful, reminds me of the first time I tasted it when I was a kid in the 50's.  Easy to make and taste good.  Thanks April for sharing.

just as I remembered! (I did add about 1/4 tsp of salt though) not too thick, nor too sweet. I didn't think it needed the extra cocoa powder several people mentioned. I think that would have been too much.

This was great!  It wasn't the same recipe that my Grandma used to make, but it was just as good.  It came out a little thicker and sweeter than what I remember my gma's to be...but I will definitely use this when the kids want cg&b's again.

As  I do in most of my chocolate dishes, I used half Hershey's Cocoa and half Hershey's Dark Cocoa.   I grew up eating it for breakfast but had never attempted to make it.  It was a success!  My family enjoyed it!!

My Aunt Beckymade this for me the first time I got to spend the night with her after getting out of a 6 month hospital stay for seisures. It was the first time I had EVER had chocolate gravy, needless to say I've been in a relationship with it ever since!

This dish is a favorite of my children. The only variation I have made to this recipe is using evaporated milk, preferably PET brand, instead of regular milk. The texture and taste are much creamier. If the gravy is not thickening enough, about 1 minute prior to removing the gravy from the heat stir in a tablespoon of corn starch.

I made using the extra cocoa and salt others recommended and I made my 3/4 cup of sugar a heaping  3/4 cup. It was quite good, mine came out really dark with lots of chocolate flavor. The salt is a must for flavor contrast. I was tasting as I cooked and kept thinking something was missing, then I remembered the salt. That was it. A great recipe. Make sure you constantly stir and watch your heat if your using an electric stove.

I came from the family who has our recipe for Chocolate Gravy in many southern restaurants and cafes. It has been in several cook books thanks to an uncle and my mom. I increased the cocoa to 1/2 c., reduced sugar to 1/2 c., and always use whole milk and never reduced fat. You can easily double this recipe; I've always had to because we have 7 kids in our family and even with 4 still at home one batch is not enough. This has to be served over homemade biscuits (not bisquick) and always use real butter on biscuits, never margarine. This is a favorite of our family's on a Saturday morning. Yummy!!

This is better than the recipe I have in myou cookbook on recipes from the old south. It's thicker like gravy should be. I haven't tried tweaking the recipe, as I find it just fine as-is. Maybe they left out salt since regular butter is used instead of unsalted? My 2 year old son has never eaten a biscuit put in front of him until I poured this over it!
Edited to add: I just made it with gluten free all purpose flour. It took longer to thicken, and it must be stirred constantly or you get sludge in the bottom of the pan. I did add 1 extra tbspn gf flour since it was taking so long, a sprinkle of sea salt, and 1 more tbspn cocoa powder.

The gravy was delicious and the left over tasted like the filling for a chocolate pie so I saved it so someone in the family can eat it as a pudding if wanted.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I have never had chocolate gravy before, nor have I ever heard of it. I made it for dinner tonight (yep, dinner!), and it was a huge hit. I usually don't mess with recipes when I try them for the first time, but I did what another comment said and doubled the cocoa and added 1/4 tsp salt. Perfection! Very smooth, great flavor. I have some left over from dinner tonight, and I'm going to try putting it on ice cream. I think it would taste great on ice cream too. (And I'm not sure if I can reheat the leftovers?)
I served the gravy with the cream biscuits from this site.

Very good recipe.  My husband has mentioned several times that he had chocolate gravy back in the 70's while visiting Alabama.  I had never heard of it but found the recipe here and surprised him.  He says 'thumbs up'!

Maybe I didn't do something right, I'm not sure, but my gravy was super thick and really flavorless. I really feel as though I followed the recipe pretty close though.  It was like eating thick goop with a hint of cocoa.  Nothing at all like the chocolate gravy I had as a kid.

My Grandmother used to make this for family gatherings, when she passed away 5 years ago, I ended up with her recipe but of course no measurements... I made this today for a family breakfast...it was such a happy morning filled with happy memories of Grandma Purdy..Didn't change a thing...My family and I loved it!! Thanks for helping us keep this in our family!!

I didn't have enough milk, so took a chance and made half and half water and milk. It was excellent! This one is a keeper.

So easy and so delicious. My family's favorite gravy. I use 1\2 Splenda and 1\2 sugar  to cut down on the carbs just a bit. I've tried with just Splenda and it really needs the sugar.

This worked exactly as stated.  My only complaint, and it's not a big complaint, is that the chocolate was a little over powered by the taste of the flour.  I think next time I would use the butter to cook the flour first, then whisk in the cocoa and then the sugar before adding the milk..  This is very pudding-like when it cools but with a mild chocolate flavor.  but that's probably okay for breakfast biscuits!

I am a very beginner when it comes to kitchen stuff and I found this recipe very easy to follow. The first time I make a recipe I try to follow it exactly but this time I had to use chocolate milk since that was all I had in my fridge.  It still turned out yummy!

3.26.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/187298/southern-style-chocolate-gravy/ ... Yes, similar, but not quite pudding.  A cross between chocolate sauce & thickened hot chocolate. I had this with homemade buttermilk biscuits, but fruit would be good, too; silky smooth.

This is a treat I always make when the grandchildren visit. I do, however, cut it down. One half makes plenty for four - although just to be honest, I don’t indulge. It can be addictive! Simple, tasty and makes people happy - what else can you ask for!

My old babysitter used to make this for me at least once a week. We haven't stayed in touch for personal reasons so I never got her recipe. This is the closest I've ever came to it. I added a little more sugar than what it called for, but it turned out perfectly. 10/10 would make it again!

This recipe is as close to my mothers in taste and ingredients as any I have found. Of course she didn't measure anything or write hers down so I have tried many different ones and this was the best. I will make again.
Thank you!

Instead of stirring the mixture 'frequently' while cooking on 'medium',  I instead stirred constantly on low.  Yes,  I will absolutely make this again!

Super good. Only thing I changed was the flour I used cornstarch instead. With the flour it’s just a runny mess with the cornstarch it’s thick like gravy is suppose to be. I also added some salt not much. The flavor is really good with this one. You really need to play around with this recipe to make it your own. I find that 2 tablespoons of cornstarch is the perfect match to make it thick like gravy. To me 3 made it too much like pudding. With flour it was just a  sophisticated hot chocolate (that’s how runny it is). I also added some salt too. Just really play around with recipes to make them your own. But always try the original first the original may be very good.

this is a receipe my granddad used to make. It’s my Moms go to. I don’t even think she’s has a real “receipe card” for it. Although I am a southern girl, I have never eaten it on biscuits. In my family you pour it over a two layer vanilla cake........yum !!

AprilDidn’t know that this was your post when I opened it. Way to go girl. Almost the same amount of ingredients we use. And we found that if you heat the milk first then add dry ingredients it makes faster.

I used dark chocolate (it’s all I had). Good thing I did - next time I’ll be reducing the amount of sugar and adding a pinch of salt.  Otherwise, it’s pretty darn close to what my Mamaw used to make!

The BEST chocolate gravy I've ever had! Us Tennesseans take chocolate gravy serous as well, and this recipe rocked it! It is perfect as is  because the consistency is silky smooth,  not too thick or too thin and has the perfect amount of sweetness. Do not stray at all from the recipe! My family said I outdid m myself.

I don’t change anything about this unless wanting more of a dark chocolate flavor then I add more cocoa. My kids & husband love this recipe. Kids friends would want to stay night just to have this next morning. Daughter always makes tuberware bowl to take to school & has to fight off friends once they try it! Lol

The first time I made it I thought I'd have help eating it. Nah. Mom & my brother weren't interested. Oh, well. More for me. LOL I did take up someone's suggestion to use a half cup of cocoa rather than a fourth. The 2nd time I halved it. But the 3rd time, whew, boy! I opted for the full recipe because, with the addition of a bit of milk or water or half & half (stirred in real good), I discovered it's good reheated in the microwave. Any how, I like cinnamon in chocolate so in the 3rd and most recent batch I added 2 tsp. of Cinnamon. I was out of vanilla so I used rum flavoring instead, the amount the same as the vanilla. OMG! Heavenly. Just heavenly. Give it a go folks. Just give it a go. This isn't just for biscuits either. It's great on a toasted English muffin or regular toast.

Excellent as is, we adjusted to our taste by going to 1/2 cup cocoa and subbing in 1/2 cup of half and half in place of 1/2 cup of the milk to make it creamier. A pinch of salt seems to make the flavor pop!

Amazing! I added a pinch of salt, but everything else was spot on perfect. This is even more creamy than my grandmother's recipe :)

My husband is an expert on chocolate gravy! Need to be a little sweeter  . So next time cup sugar , he likes it sweet. His mom would make it for him when we go visit them. We live out state. So on special occasion I make it for him, today's his birthday.

This is spectacular.  I used about 1/3 cup cocoa and added just a little salt.  It took 10-12 minutes to get to the desired consistency.  But it would be hard to exaggerate how good this is.

Amazing. It tastes exactly like my grannies chocolate gravy. I also used 1/2 cup of cocoa. I grew up on having chocolate gravy on cold winter mornings,  and I've carried that tradition on with my two young children.

I made this for my family and it turned out GREAT! I did add 1/4 cup extra of cocoa for my southern bell man lol and he doesn't like butter in it (because he's weird) and it still turned out great even without the butter! I love this recipe and saved it! I really think the vanilla kicks it off honestly.

I love this recipe!  It's my go-to recipe EVERY time. The only change I make is substituting 1/2 the sugar with Splenda to cut back on carbs a little. It's definitley better with  all real sugar though. I always have to make extra to keep the boys from arguing over the last spoon full.

I live up north and this is unheard of but I had to try it. I also doubled  the  cocoa powder and added a pinch of salt. Loved it  but my family  turned their noses up at it lol.

My boyfriend and I are from the south and he kept talking about chocolate gravy so I found this recipe and made it about half an hour ago and he was less than impressed with it. I have never even heard of chocolate gravy before a month ago (the whole south sighs in shock as one of their own has turned their back on them) so I don't know what it tastes or looks like to compare it to anything. He said it was too sweet and thick and looked like I just globbed chocolate cake frosting on top of some biscuits. I even took the other southerner's suggestions and added another 1/4 cup of cocoa and 1/4 tsp of salt. 2 stars since I modified it.

My husband is from the south and of course I am not, never heard of chocolate gravy until I got married. Tried this recipe tonight for dinner and the only issue we had was that there was not enough, so next time I have to double the recipe. No leftovers tonight

I have made this recipe countless times, and it is a true weekend favorite for the family. I do add a pinch of salt and reduce the sugar some.  A kid favorite for sure!

This was close.  The flavor was good but it was fairly thick.  This could have been that we cooked it too long.  We will be trying it again with a few tweeks.  Definitely needs the 1/4 teas salt and a full 1/2 cup of cocoa.  We will probably decrease the flour slightly and add something to improve the flavor from good to great.  We are thinking one of the following: cinnamon; more vanilla; chili flakes; almond extract.....
