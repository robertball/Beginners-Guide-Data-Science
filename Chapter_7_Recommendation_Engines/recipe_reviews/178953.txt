This is good, it just needs a little extra zip added. I added a red pepper and black beans to the mix. I also added some garlic powder, chili powder and cumin as the sauce was quite bland. You could easily add a packet of fajita or taco seasoning too. It was a nice creamy mixture and nice and gooey after the cheese melts on them!

This recipe was very good. I used Cream of Chicken instead of Cream of Mushroom because it was what I had on hand. I also added 2 tbsp of taco seasoning along with a couple dashes of garlic powder to the pan per other reviews. The plus to this recipe was that I had enough left ,after serving 4 adults, to have a second night. Instead of turning the mixture into fajitas though I added 1 can of corn and 2 cups of cooked rice to it and made it into a Mexican skillet. When served I covered with cheese.

This was great!  I added one packet of Chicken Taco Mix (as I added the peppers and onion) and one can of Black Beans (as I added the soup) and it turned out fantastic.  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely have this again.

I was absolutley surprised at how great this tasted! I used medium spicy pace and it gave it a little kick that others were saying it was missing. I think if you want more kick then use the hot pace. We also used yellow and red bell peppers to add color, everyone just ate it up.

This was fabulous!! I modified if a bit because I wanted to use what I had at home. I added some mushroom and red peppers, used Cream of Chicken instead of mushroom, threw in some minced garlic, I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of salsa, and added some taco seasoning, chilli powder, and a dash of cajun seasoning. It was great and everyone loved it!

this is one of our favorite recipes! i make it atleast two+ times a month.. i do tweek it a bit. i used ground chicken, add onions, green peppers, mushrooms. for flavoring i add half a packet of taco seasoning, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp chili pepper, and salt. i also add healthy request cream of mushroom and 1/2 cup of hot picante sauce with 2 tbsp water. it's a perfect amount to make it gooey yet flavorable! at the end instead of serving it in tortillas, i serve it on top of a bed of spanish rice and top it with tomatoes, fresh lettuce and onions! delicious!!!! (and spicy!)

Loved it! We used cream of chicken instead because my boyfriend hates mushrooms.  We also added black beans and corn and then used the leftovers for the topping for an amazing taco salad the next day.

These were very good!  They can be a little soupy but the taste is amazing.  I made them for a pot luck and everyone really enjoyed them. I made spicy black beans one the side and it pairs very well with them, and I add whatever veggies I have on hand as well.

This was quick, easy and awesome.  I used turkey breast strips because that's what I had and season the meat with garlic power and cayenne pepper for some kick and my family loved it.  I also used a high fiber wrap.  Simply great.  Thanks

I made this after trying a sample at the grocery store... the recipe card i got from the store called for cream of celery soup so that's what i used, i also doubled the peppers (adding an orange one) and the onions because i love a lot of veggies

I will be making this often!

My son called me from work, saying he was hungry and asking if I would cook him something tasty. I only had 35 minutes, and Monterey Chicken Fajitas were the perfect choice. I made some healthy modifications, completely leaving out the cheese, using olive oil and whole wheat tortillas, but followed the recipe the rest of the way. I thawed frozen chicken in the micro, then spiced it up with some taco seasoning, a little pepper, and a hint of garlic salt. Meanwhile, I sauteed the onion and pepper. When the chicken was finished, I cut it up and added it to the onion/pepper mixture, followed by adding the salsa and mushroom soup. We both loved this recipe. Great idea. Thank you!

This recipe was pretty good.  The cream of mushroom was a bit much. Made for very saucy fajitas. I think if I had taken that out it would've been a great recipe.

This recipe was ok. I did not really like the soup in there. It was almost overwhelming. Maybe only use half a can next time? Other than that I added some serrano peppers (I like things really spicy). Overall, I would make it again... maybe just tweak it a bit.

This is a nice quick and easy recipe. I thought the sauce was a good start, but knew it wasn't going to be spicy enough for my group. So I added about 2 tablespoons Chili Powder. The Fajitas were a big hit.

Have made this many times, finally getting around to writing my review. These are the yummiest, easiest fajitas I've ever had!! I made these to impress a date, I've made them for friends, I've even tought a college student with not much cooking expierence to make these and everyone always gives two thumbs up. All of the ingredients are things that I always have on hand anyway, so these are awesome when you need to whip something up quick. Love, Love, Love!!

I made the recipe exactly as written except I substituted cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom and used Pace picante sauce instead of thick and chunky. Quite tasty. Served with cheddar cheese, sour cream, guacamole and extra salsa.

It was good, but I think Cream of Mushroom Soup is a strange idea.  Next time, I'll use a different type of soup or no soup at all.  (Not sure yet.)

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was.  I halved it for my husband and me, if I used the whole recipe, half the chicken  and added beans it would be enough for 8 easily. I think beans would be a great addition by adding fiber and more texture. Otherwise I wouldn't change it. We had enough leftover filling for lunch the next day. We added sharp cheddar and sour cream.

This was way better then expected. We had Trader Joes jar salsa that gave it a nice kick. It had a nice creamy texture and would be great as a main dish without the tortillas.

Excellent, easy recipe.  Very tasty!  The family loves it.  It's also easy to double for larger crowds.

Delicious! I made a few changes based on the reviews that I read. I used a little more than a pound of chicken as many said it was too "saucy." I also added red pepper flakes for heat and a tablespoon of taco seasoning. I will definitely make this again!

I made this for my teenager  & she loved it. I did omit the soup, like others.  I added Roasted Garlic Salsa from Trader Joes at the end of the cooking process & it kinda carmelized which made it smokey & delish. I added the black beans after with a sprinkling of shredded cheese  mmmm  Karen
