We make this all the time.. Up until my mother sent us a box of food during a power outage, I had never used Spam.. We love these easy and economical sandwiches..  Great for kids, warm & messy!  Glad someone finally put this recipe on the site.  God Bless

We tried this tonight for the 1st time and this was the 1st time I have ever had Spam and I must say this was absolutely delicious. My 2yr old daughter loved them as well. We had it for dinner...very filling! Quick and easy and a quick and easy clean-up too. I followed the recipe to the exact and they turned out perfect. I put them in the oven on broiler/hi for about 5 to 6 minutes. Next time I will serve sweet potato fries with it on the side. Thank you for the recipe!

My mom used to make something similar for us...she toasted one side of a piece of bread under the broiler. Spread leftover baked beans on the soft side of bread top with Velveeta cheese and partially cooked bacon slices. Then she broiled until the cheese was melted and the bacon was crisp. Yummy easy way to use up leftoever beans!
