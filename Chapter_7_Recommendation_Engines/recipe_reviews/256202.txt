Dish was delicious... Even my son who doesn't eat ANYTHING gave it a try and didn't complain.  Was really good. Made a generous amount.  I will make this again.  Was great that there was only one dirty dish to clean at the end of preparation.

Adapted based on what I had on hand and instinct and did without cream.  Cooked chicken.  Removed.  Boiled water, added rice, boiled.  Simmer 10 min.  Add broccoli.  Simmer 10 min.  Add chicken. 5 more min.

In a word: BLAH. It can be helped with some spice/herb management but the textures did not work for me. Using the packaged rice dish is easy but detrimental to the recipe.

I WILL make this again!! Super easy. What a relief! I made some minor alterations where I added salt, put shredded mozzarella cheese at the end and squeezed lemon over the top over our servings when we sat down to eat. Very easy but tasty.

I really liked this recipe! I doubled the lemon juice because we love lemon in our house. I also used Uncle Bens Garlic and herb rice (1 1/4 cups) instead of the Knorrs because my store didn't carry it. It turned out great with the garlic and lemon as stand out flavors.

It tastes great.  I had to adapt as my daughter is gluten free and we cannot use the knorrs.  I substituted the knorrs rice with 2 cups of minute rice.
 
I used a tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of flour,over the stove and whisked about 4 minutes.  Turned the heat down and added the heavy cream and seasoning, which included scallions, garlic, and mrs. Dash. Always mixing!
While cooking the chicken at the same time, took out the chicken and put in the creamy mixture into the skillet that had the chicken, then added the water and rice. I followed the directions from there and it was 
great!

Yummy! Could not find the rice side so just used herb/butter rice-a-roni in the box. Was delicious! Family keeps asking me to make it again.
