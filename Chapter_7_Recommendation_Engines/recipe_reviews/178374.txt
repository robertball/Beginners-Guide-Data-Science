THis is a great recipe but do yourself a favor and just use a premixed pancake recipe, in my opinion it works just as well and it takes that much less time to prepare.  Also I ate this like I would eat a potato pancake, prepared with bacon, onions and with sour cream.  Delicious will for sure make again!

Great comfort food!  I was making this with whole wheat flour, and found that I did not have an egg, so went ahead anyway!  I added 1 T. prepared mustard and 2 tsp. caraway seeds because other people in reviews said it needed something.  This tastes like something that I would have had at my grandmother's!  I'll be making it again!

When Erin mentioned it being a little bland, I added some Caraway seed. Always works well with cabbage. Old East European touch.

A great way to use up some extra cabbage- my husband and I definitely enjoyed them.  They were a tad bland though, so I think I will add some garlic powder or something to give them a little spice next time.  I did appreciate the healthiness, and even used half the amount of vegetable oil, and served with fat free sour cream.

I made these with red cabbage, and I also added about a teaspoon of caraway seed to the cabbage in the skillet.

There were absolutely delicious. They simply need some salt.

I added caraway seeds as recomended, subbed lowfat cottage cheese for yogurt, doubled the eggs, and used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 rye bread crumbs. Really good. Kiddo is taking a few for her lunch today.

This recipe looked interesting so I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised. I skipped the cabbage & onion ingredients and substituted about one cup of leftover cabbage, carrots and onions from St. Patrick's day corned beef and cabbage. Drained the 
vegetables well, ran a knife through them for a rough chop and then folded them into the batter. Check 
seasoning based on the saltiness of the cooked 
vegetables. These cooked up very light and fluffy.
This was a great way to use up a small amount of leftover veggies. The batter was VERY easy to make and turned out lighter than boxed mixes. This is a keeper that can be adapted to please individual tastes.

I love this new way to feed cabbage to my kids! They are good all by themselves. Here is what I made different: used 1/2c of whole rye flour, 2tsp caraway seeds and some granulated onion, greek fat free yogurt, rice milk, 1/2tsp salt. My cakes turned out a bit on a dark side, maybe due to the changed ingredients. I'll be making these again. Thank you!

These were excellent!  They were a big hit with my five- and three- year- olds as well.  I added a little bit of chili spice for flavor (not a ton), and served them with a warm chunky apple sauce with little bits of bacon on top.  I would definitely make these again!

Loved these! I added alot more salt though after trying the first batch. I also traded 1 cup of rye flour for all purpose.   I also included shredded carrots. Comfort food.

I took a chance on this recipe and was surprised. My MIL loves cabbage and I love having a new way to surprise her. She was VERY impressed. She had the left over cakes for breakfast!

I liked these but my 4yo did not.  I did add a little salt and pepper to the cabbage as it was sauteing.  Served with sour cream and bacon as another reviewer suggested. These had a bit of an aftertaste maybe due to the large amount of baking powder.  Not sure if I will make these again or not.

As the previous reviews states these are bland.  I added white pepper, garlic salt and ginger.  Didn't help much.

These cakes were okay. I ate them with Frank's Red Hot sauce because by themselves they weren't that great. I didn't have carraway seeds to add like other reviewers recommended. I also tried sour cream and cilantro as a topping and wasn't crazy about it. I would make these again if I had to use up some cabbage, but I would not by cabbage just to make this. In the future I think I would carmelize the onions.

This is a great recipe just the way it is, but add a large handful of corned beef cut in strips to the batter then serve with a little spicy deli mustard on the side and you have a great dish for lunch or brunch.

I made this exactly as the recipe said and they came out great! Only thing different is that I had about 30 of them, so I must have made them smaller.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the directions of the pancake batter exactly and it turned out wonderfully.  One alteration I would make for next time is to add crumbled bacon to the batter.  I also pureed the cabbage and onion.  It makes it a lot easier to fold into the batter.  I topped the pancakes with fried onions and sour cream.  Delicious!

My toddler daughter really likes these.  I used applesauce instead of the vegetable oil, used whole wheat flour, and added kale and cumin.

Great side dish.  I used self-rising flour so I did not have to add the baking powder or baking soda.  I also didn't have plain yogurt, so I used sour cream.  Thanks for the recipe.

not a big fan, I added more seasoning and I still think these are bland. They would be a great vehicle for something else. I think they taste a lot like a standard pancake so I may be serving the left overs with syrup in the morning and telling my kids they are pancakes. Tonight I think I will serve them with apple sauce. benefit, my kids will eat them (I hope) and get some greens!

My husband and I love these. I add some ground turkey and bell pepper and corn, and cumin to this mix. We eat it as a main dish served with salsa and sour cream.

The cabbage cakes were okay. I felt there was too much baking powder. I cut the batch into two bowls, leaving one true to the original recipe and the other mixing in mustard and caraway seeds as suggested. neither really did it for me or my husband. I don't think I will be making these again.
