The cookie bowl was a great idea except it melted off of the bowl and didn't get hard enough to stay in a shape.

We tried this (2Xs) and it never turned out right. I had little "helpers" working with me the 1st time and thought that had contributed to the less than desirable end result-tried it again solo and it did not turn out any better. Really disappointed in this. I thought it sounded really cute but it turned out greasy and just not formed well. Sorry we just didn't care for this much at all.

This is a good idea but it is way to greasy and cookies slide off. The cookies do taste good.I would not attempt this again.

This seemed like a good idea. I thought even if the bowl didn't work they would still taste good. First of all they were way too dry. I had to add almost a half c of milk before they could be shaped.When they were done we took them off the mold and they fell apart. They aren't sweet enough taste more like bread with cocoa powder. I'm sorry maybe if some adjustments they will work better.

I so wanted this recipe to work. But what a mess!!The cookies don't stick around the pan. And they didn't have much taste.

I just love this for the simplicity of it and the sheer novelty value! Makes a bit of a change from ice bowls too!

Great recipe with lots of inspiration for so much more...

simple and easy to make. If you do not like messing with dough this is not for you I Read some of the reviews and was sort of worried that it wouldn't turn out right but it was fine no running not messy (at least not any more than any other rolled cookie would be) and has a great chocolate taste. Deffenatly an A on my gift giving list.
