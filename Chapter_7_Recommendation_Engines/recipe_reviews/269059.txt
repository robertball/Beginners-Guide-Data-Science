I made this as a dinner to take to my fiancée at work. I was a little worried about the crusty bread crumb top getting soggy in transport, since I had to cover it, but that didn’t turn out to be a problem at all. The bread crumbs stayed nice and crisp and had all of that awesome flavor packed in. The only problem I ran into was that the chicken turned out to be a little tough, but I think that was more of a problem with the quality of the chicken breast more so than the person preparing it. Why take responsibility when you really don’t have to? I think next time I’ll pound the chicken down a bit and hopefully that’ll tenderize the meat a little. Overall, it got rave reviews and my fiancée is still committed to me so I suppose this recipe was a win.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe as written except for doubling it to serve 4 people and adding garlic powder to the seasoning for the chicken. The breadcrumbs are really the star of this dish because they taste great (the cheese gives them a lot of flavor) and they add wonderful texture. I forgot to double the sauce recipe, so there was only a little bit for each cutlet, but it was still quite tasty and I'm sure it would be even better with the full amount. This is a great, quick dish.

This recipe was very good! I will be making it again, spouse loved it. The only thing I would do differently is maybe not so much garlic. Now garlic cloves, as we all know come in all different sizes. I probably chose too large of cloves. Next time I’ll be a little more attentive to the clove size I choose.

More effort involved than some meals, but it's an OUTSTANDING meal!  The family isn't such a fan of the pan sauce.  It's overpowering except MAYBE as a dipping sauce.

I love it when I happen to have all the ingredients on hand! I did substitute cream of chicken for the first round of stock to bake it in as I wanted a thicker final sauce (and got it). Made a great sauce to pour over asparagus. 
Such a tasty dish! Highly recommended.

Really easy to cook, love the Panko bread crumbs (always have) and makes a great left over - if you have any left!  I have tried it with chicken tenders which worked out just as well.  Again, no leftovers...

Made it and then made it again a few nights later.  I am not 
a big fan of white chicken meat but this method is really
good!!!  I even copied it to word and have it annotated with
a few notes, like "hot pans", use stiff spatula,  plain yellow
mustard (minimal amount), you'll want the use of a soup spoon while dining.

Easy and a huge hit with the wife and all four boys. We did have to triple everything. Cook times also needed more like 7 min per side in skillet and  15 min in oven.

This was really flavorful! I used chicken cutlets instead of chicken breasts, followed the cook times, and the chicken was moist and cooked thoroughly....I think chicken breast would have needed more time which would have burnt the bread crumbs. This was really so good!

Absolutely delicious. The chicken was very juicy! Hard to believe it was from boneless skinless chicken breast. I would cut the l mon joyce down and add a bit more chicken broth in its lace as it was a bit too tangy.

It was fantastic. The chicken stayed extra moist the bread crumbs provided the perfect texture while the “glue” brought life to an otherwise bland piece of skinless chicken.

My daughter, age 15, decided to make this for dinner and it was fabulous!  She followed the recipe to a t, because she hasn’t had a lot of experience yet to be able to experiment while cooking.  Well, we all thought that it shouldn’t be changed as it was that tasty!  The only thing I would have done is add a little bit of water to the glue as it was a bit too thick for me.   It all in all we have become Chef John fans and will be trying more of his creations as long as they aren’t too complicated!

I didn't have panko bread crumbs, so I used regular.  The finished product was very good and we will make it again.  Next time I'll use Panko crumbs
