I needed to use a few overripe bananas, but didn’t want to go with the standard banana bread, so I’m glad I was able to find something different. This does come out more like a sheet cake than brownies, as another reviewer stated, but it’s still really good. I made the following changes: used 3 bananas and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter, then with the frosting, added 1 tsp vanilla, a pinch of salt and about 1/3 cup peanut butter (if you’re a fan of peanut butter and chocolate, that makes a really nice addition). It’s been a hit with everyone who’s tried it and I’ll definitely make it again.

These were amazing! I made them without the nuts. If you like bananas, these are for you.

I made these as directed, and I would describe them more as a banana Texas sheet cake than a brownie. Very dense, and strong banana flavour.

I’ve made these multiple times .  I didn’t like the frosting   Brownies are really good though . I leave off the frosting and add half a cup of peanut butter chips to the batter before baking .  Also , I used a metal pan lined with aluminum foil to make them easy to lift our and cut .  With the changes, I think this goes from 4 to 5.

These are sooo addictive! Thanks for the great recipe!  I didn't change a thing to the brownie itself, but I made a butterscotch frosting instead of using the chocolate frosting. I bet they would be great with peanut butter frosting as well!

Absolutely terrific!  I doubled the recipe, used dark chocolate chips and dark cocoa powder, and used a Pyrex 9 X 13” baking dish.  It took about 35 minutes to bake.  Moist and fudgy!

Made these as stated in the recipe, but did not have time to frost them - turned out GREAT!  Everyone loved them. Next time I will try them with the chocolate peanut butter frosting suggested by another baker.  Love having something new to do with bananas.

It was good, I had 3 big bananas so increased the recipe by 1/3. Cooked it 10 minutes longer because my oven is like that. My niece don't like nuts, had to pick them out, but she's like that. My wife said the frosting was too sweet but I told her sugar is like that. It was all eaten, it was like that.

This is a nice dense bar. I could eat it with or without the frosting.

This is almost banana bread in its consistency which was a surprise because we were expecting more of a dense brownie texture, but the flavor was excellent. I may experiment with more chocolate chips to see if  that makes it more brownie-like, but we did enjoy it.

Delicious! Made per the directions and they were moist and fluffy, with just a slight banana flavor. Will make again next time I have overripe bananas.
