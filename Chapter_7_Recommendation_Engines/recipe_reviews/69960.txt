We have made a correction to this recipe. It should be 3 tablespoons cornstarch, not 3 teaspoons.

Much better than boxed pudding mix and almost as fast. The flavor is wonderful. If you don't have cornstarch on hand, I use an equal amount of flour, either all purpose or whole wheat, with great results. I've also substituted 2 teaspoons of bourbon instead of the vanilla extract for a great kick in flavor. For a lighter, more chocolate mousse type dessert, simple wait until the pudding cools for a few hours in the refrigerator and then gently fold in a carton or thawed cool whip. This was as good or better than the chocolate mousse I've had in nice restaurants!

I came across this recipe looking for a quick chocolate dessert (mostly to satisfy my chocolate craving after dinner one night!!!)  This was a pretty good recipe all in all, it was a snap to make.  The texture is so much better if you add a tablespoon or 2 of butter right when it comes out of the microwave.  I have also omitted the cocoa powder and made vanilla pudding out of it, which is pretty good also.

...Ummmm... You might want to pay attention to that part that says "Stir, then cook at 1 minute intervals, stirring between cooking times for 2 to 4 minutes, or until shiny and thick." Mine was thick and shiny, and looked great, but for some strange reason, after 2 one-minute intervals, I just HAD to chance it, and put it in another minute! Not a great idea. It bubbled over the bowl and into the microwave. Oops! Totally my fault! The recipe is AWESOME! Like others, I added a pinch of salt with the dry ingredients and a bit of butter with the vanilla. I'm sure I will be making this one many, many more times!

UPDATE: So... I've made this recipe again and again... with a larger bowl and a more watchful eye... LOL
This last time, after the pudding cooked, I spooned a little into dessert bowls, then put a marshmallow into each. Then I topped with more hot pudding. The marshmallow got all gooey & yummy. HUGE hit! Kids loved it!

I will never make chocolate pudding from a box again. This is AMAZING and SO EASY!! Followed recipe exactly. Easy to customize for single servings (to keep yourself from eating 4 in one sitting!!). And by the way, this is so yummy warm, you'll have to exercise serious self-restraint to allow it to cool. 
IDEAS: cinnamon and cayenne for Mexi-pudding; cardamom and pistachios for Indian-pudding; peppermint extract (half as much as vanilla - it's stronger) and crushed peppermint for a Christmas pudding; Kahlua instead of vanilla for a grown-up pudding; a tsp peanut butter (after cooking) and crushed peanuts; or even orange zest (after cooking). The possibilities are dazzling. 
Note: DO keep an eye on this as it cooks as it WILL BOIL OVER if you walk away. It's practically inevitable. :)

I just made this on the stove instead of the microwave.  It turned out fantastic!  Rich and creamy.  

Stove directions.  Mix all dry ingredients in the pan.  Turn to medium heat (not more than that).  Slowly pour in milk while stirring.  Stir constantly until mix begins to boil.  When the first bubbles break the surface, stir one minute more.  Turn off heat.  Cool for 5 mins, stirring twice.  I serve mine hot, but you may cover it with plastic wrap and chill for several hours and serve cold.

Thank you!

I am in my 60's.  My Mom used to make this sort of pudding for us all the time . Brings back memories of warm, happy kitchens and families all eating together around the table at every meal. No need to buy pudding mixes with all their artificial ingredients.  By using brown sugar instead of white and by deleting the cocoa, you get butterscotch pudding.  By the same token, if you scorch white sugar, you get caramel pudding.  Personnally, I used to love the skin on top of the puddings.  Mom would pour the hot puddings into desert bowls to cool, and each of us got our own serving of skin covered pudding.

I used fat free milk and Sugar Blend Splenda and it still turned out very rich and delicious -- what a wonderfully easy chocolate fix!

Typo alert! With 3 TABLESPOONS of cornstarch instead of teaspoons, this recipe is excellent.  It works with rice milk, soy milk, coconut milk, whatever.

OH MY GOD!  This is a chocoholic's dream!  I can't believe how easy this is.  I added the butter, as others had suggested + a dash of salt.  I think next time, I might also add some cinnamon (for a Mexican chocolate flavor).

oh my! who knew making pudding from scratch could be so easy? And good! As I like to make things from scratch, this will fit into my recipe collection beautifully. I made a double batch, cooked it initially for 6 minutes and than 1 1/2 minutes twice at which point I added 2 T butter and 4 t vanilla. Thank you!

I was disappointed with this recipe after all of the five-star reviews, and I'm a big chocolate lover who was having a craving. I was drawn to this recipe by the "quick and easy" comments and by the fact that I had all the ingredients in my cupboard. I followed the directions carefully, yet I was putting the pudding back in the microwave after stirring for more than thirty minutes because it just would not thicken. I expected "shiny and thick" to mean a texture like that of your typical pudding, yet it never seemed to get that thick -- it was basically like cake batter. So, finally I decided that it needed to be cooled in the fridge to thicken (but so many others said they liked it warm?!). I got tired of standing by the microwave and stirring and stirring and stirring. Finally, I just stuck it in the fridge while it was still cake batter texture. It has been cooling for about twenty minutes now, and it is a little bit thicker, but it certainly doesn't have the texture of your typical pudding, and I would definitely not call it "quick." The flavor is delicious, but what a hassle!! Maybe after an hour of refrigeration this will be like a pudding. . .

Just made this recipe for the 2nd time, and cannot wait for it to cool a bit before having a dish! I did add a tablespoon of butter both times, seems to give it a fuller taste and texture. I love this recipe chilled or warm, and even tried a dish with bananas added and it was so good! For a good quick chocolately fix, this recipe is fantastic!

Am I dreaming? Talk about a short-cut with good results. Will use this to make chocolate pie at holidays. I'm all for time-savers, but when you get a good product to boot...I'm in. Thank-you Debra.  I added a pinch of salt to dry mix and a tb. butter at the end,  Can make "milk chocolate" by adding less cocoa.  I gave 4 stars due to bitterness. The higher fat content of the milk...the creamier the results. Tip: Make up baggies of dry mix while you have everything out for convenience sake.

EXCELLENT! Oh my goodness, this recipe is AMAZING! This was sooo much better than those store bought boxes! This recipe was great as written, but I really wanted to try using Dark Chocolate cocoa, and I have to say...It was also amazing! (especially if you like dark chocolate) I do have to mention that I did take the advice of the other reviewers and stirred in a Tbsp of butter after it reached the consistancy that I wanted. Delish! A must try! Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe Debra! :)

Made exactly as instructed, this is a solid 4 stars.  It's smooth, thick, and rich, but you can indeed taste the cocoa powder.  However, stir in just 1 tbsp of butter and it becomes a full 5 star recipe.  That one extra ingredient added something - a fullness, I guess - that was missing.  

All this time I thought I didn't like pudding - turns out I just don't like fake boxed/packaged commercial stuff.  Who knew?    TIP: almond extract instead of vanilla, & sprinkle with crushed almonds and flaked coconut = ALMOND JOY PUDDING.  My favorite mod for this great recipe.  So good.

This is decadent yet actually healthy!!   I substituted 1/4 cup of Splenda for 1/4 cup of the white sugar and used skim milk.  If you are a chocoholic like me, try using the best cocoa powder you can find--I used Valrohona.  I whisked everything together in a small saucepan and put over med heat while constantly whisking until the mixture was thick and glossy.  You could also use this as pie filling if you add another Tbsp or 2 of cornstarch.  I actually added even more vanilla extract and a splash of Frangelico (hazelnut liquor) at the end--excellent!  I'm betting some Amaretto, Kahlua, or Grand Marniner would also work beautifully for an elegant touch!

Super easy!  Added a pat of butter and tiny bit of salt as suggested.  I did begin to worry when after 4 mins my pudding wasn't thick at all.  I was using a very heavy earthenware bowl and needed to go for a total of 6 minutes. Turned out great the only problem is waiting for it to cool!

This was so easy and better than boxed mixes.  I added a Tablespoon of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter along with the vanilla and it made it very rich.  Delicious both warm and cold.

WOW!This recipe is pretty good - for something that only needs a few ingredients and a microwave. I lessen the sugar, add more cocoa powder and a pinch of salt to balance out the sweetness.Turned out super-good! Thanks for the recipe!

I have used nearly the same recipe for almost 40 years.  The only difference is that I add 1teaspoon of butter and stir it in after it is all cooked while it is still hot.  It adds a silkier texture.  If you don't have a lot of milk to spare, you can use instant powdered milk in with the sugar and cocoa and just add in the required water to make the 2 cups of milk.  It doesn't change the taste or texture.  Good to know in a pinch.  This also makes a good pie filling.

This recipe is awesome!  Ten minutes ago, I had no sweets in the house.  Now, I have a giant, burning hot bowl of pudding in my lap!  This is wonderful!  4 servings?  Not if i can eat faster than three other people can discover I've got pudding!

This is so easy and delicious I have to give it 5 stars.  I have made this many times, both by microwave and by stovetop and here is what I found.  Microwave is the way to go overall.  Its great because 1. You don't have to keep an eye on it, so if you're expecting company or are just busy doing other things, its fool proof against burning.  2. No constant stirring and 3. Better overall look and texture.  The stovetop's main problem for me was that even on low heat, its on the stove so much that by the time I'm ready to serve, its hardly a serving because a lot of it evaporated. Oh, and don't try anything above low to speed up the process...it will burn!  The only thing stovetop does for you is give you more of a feeling that you actually cooked something, but since the microwave is better for every other reason, I'll stick to the microwave only from now on.  Company doesn't have to know it was so simple!

I forgot to get a dessert for Christmas Day and thought chocolate pudding would be great. I saw this recipe but did not have cornstarch in the house. Thanks to the reviews I was able to use flour. I also found the other reviews helpful. I whisked the dry ingredients and added the butter. My family raved over it. We have a nephew with a peanut allergy. Many chocolate products are off limits for us. He can have cocoa - I can't wait to make it for him.

This is such a delicious dessert, and so easy to make.  I made it exactly as written, but with the addition of some butter with the vanilla as suggested by other reviewers.  I found the vanilla flavoring to be a little strong so I will probably reduce the amount to 2 teaspoons next time.  Although my husband and I loved the rich chocolatey flavor, our children thought it was too strong, so next time I make it for them I will probably reduce the amount of cocoa powder, too.  To summarize, this is a very quick and simple recipe to make, yet produces a rich and sophisticated dessert.  Definitely a keeper!

Simple and so yummy!  Overly sweet as written, so reduced the sugar by half for a more dark chocolate taste.  Better with almond extract.

READ MY REVIEW:
I see many of you used flour in lieu of cornstarch. Per the box of cornstarch... you will need twice as much flour if replacing the cornstarch - so double it. Also make sure when a recipe calls for milk that you do use WHOLE milk... this is the way to get that creamy texture. Now for my experience making this... It was quick & easy. I did not think it was too sweet as a matter of fact I will probably add more sugar next time. You know what, I have made chocolate pudding stovetop before by getting the box next to the instant that is the kind you have to cook. Never did I realize you don't even need to purchase a prepackaged pudding mix to do it stovetop. I feel like an idiot after realizing it is just a simple combo of sugar, cocoa powder, and thickening agent. Making this in the microwave is an AWESOME modern take on an old stovetop classic. Kuddos!!!!!

The title is misleading. It isn't all that fast in comparison to other homemade puddings. Probably would have been faster to cook over the stove. Actually THINNED as it cooled. Thinnest pudding I've ever made. And I made this after they corrected the starch measurement. Also a little too sweet for my taste, but if you've got a major sweet tooth going, that could obviously work in its favor.

Amazing!!! I added a dash of salt and 2 TBS of butter and it was perfect. I couldn't wait for it to cool so I put some in a dish, added 2-Keebler Sandies(crumbled), and topped with whipped cream. Delish! I could see how this recipe could be altered a bizillion ways to make some awesome dishes. I have a feeling this will be made on a weekly basis(I am a bit of a chocolate addict.)

I was looking for a cheaper, healthier, additive and sugar free replacement for packaged pudding cups, and I also wanted to avoid any plastic packaging.  This recipe fits the bill.  I just substituted splenda and fat free milk, and mine was as thick as the photo accompanying the recipe.  I used a 50/50 mix of regular and dutch cocoa since that's my ususal staple.  I loved the smooth thick texture but will try reducing the cocoa to 1/4 C next time as it wasn't as sweet as I like it, and I think that might be related to the amount/type of cocoa.  However, it's quite good as is if you like a lightly sweetened dark chocolate pudding.  I didn't add the pinch of salt or tablespoon of butter after cooking as some reviewers have suggested because I'm after a healthier product.  I'll sacrifice some taste for that. I poured this into 4 ounce (1/2 C) heatproof jelly jars while hot and covered them with the  bpa free white caps and it didn't get a skin.  These jars and lids are just tossed into the dishwasher and reused for snacks--good for sugar free gelatin snacks too.  Now I need a similar recipe for that!

I found a way to lower the calories of this recipe and still make it yummy if you normally use sweetners. Use splenda but be carefull with how much you put in it because it can taste sweeter with less amount. I would start with 1/4 cup and add more if you need it. Use skim milk and dont add that tablespoon of butter that is suggested by reviewers (must be good though :P). THIS VERSION HAS 93 CALORIES!! (OR EVEN LESS AS I ADDED 10 CALORIES FOR THE MARGIN OF ERROR) IM MAKING SOME TOMORROW TO HAVE A LIGHT SNACK, PLUS IT WILL LAST ME 4 DAYS AND ITS MUCH CHEAPER AND SAFE THAN BUYING THOSE "FAT FREE" PRODUCTS THAT WE REALLY DONT KNOW WHAT THEY PUT IN THEM

made it last night with 1 change: used 1 cup half and half and 1 cup 1% milk. Rich, chocolatey. Made it today with 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, reduced cocoa to 1/4 cup, 1/2 cup half and half and 1 1/2 cup 1% milk. Great after school snack in 1/2 cup servings. I will never buy a box of pudding mix again. MICROWAVED - wow!

We really enjoyed this. I used skim milk and layered it in individual glasses with fat free cool whip. It was a nice treat to have and not feel terribly guilty afterward for eating it!

This is very good when you want a quick and fast chocolate fix!
I used less sugar (1/3 cup) and I think the next time I will use a 1/4 cup.  I have also tried to make it in the microwave and on the stovetop and I prefer the stovetop...I found the microwave version a bit lumpy...overall though a good and easy recipe!
UPDATE #1
I just made it again and used 1/4 cup of sugar, much better!
UPDATE #2
I made this into butterscotch pudding by omitting the cocoa powder and adding 1/3 cup brown sugar!  Amazing!

This pudding is absolutely simple and delicious. Whipped it up in a jiffy. Just threw everything into a heavy based saucepan and stirred it till it thickened. Did add a pinch of salt and a dab of butter to give it a sheen. Finger licking good. Thanks.

Very easy to make and i had it done in 15 mins. no dishes to wash too. However it was slightly bitter.. think the quantity of cocoa was a bit much. Will def be making it again.. but will reduce the quantity of cocoa by a Tbsp or so.

Amazing chocolate pudding that took less than 10 minutes to make, the only other recipe I have takes half an hour on the stovetop.  I added about 1t instant coffee granules before cooking and a little butter (about 1T) with the vanilla for a better texture and to make it glossy.

I love making things from scratch and showing my boys how easy it is.  They loved this and couldn't wait for it to cool down.  We are so used to the pudding from the box being cold- but we ate this one warm.  Between me and my two boys my husband, who was at work, didn't get any.

This recipe is a fun science experiment!. It's neat to see the concoction suddenly become thick in the microwave.  I added about a teaspoon of butter with the vanilla and liked that variation.  The only thing is, even though this truly is "hasty," it is just not faster or that different than instant pudding!  My five year old liked sugar free instant better.  So although it was good and fun to try, I will probably not make it again.

My pudding turned out stringy and jello-y. It was super clumpy and the cornstarch made it taste really wierd. It might have been my fault but I don't think that I'll make it again. I think that 3 minutes of microwaving is too much at one time. d

After having leftovers of all the usual Thanksgiving faire hubby and I were wanting something different. Voila! The recipe was unbelievably easy. I have to tell you that 3 Tablespoons of cornstarch freak me out a bit and I'm going to work on solving that... however this recipe is yummy. It's just enough for four... or for my husband and I one night and we polish it off. Yes, people, it's that good. And do yourself a favor follow the recipe and add the vanilla or some other flavoring at the end. It will just enhance the yumminess of the chocolate. FANTASTIC!! No more instant for us :)  UPDATE ONE YEAR LATER: still delicious. This is now a go to staple in our house! Try it today!

This was so easy and good! I used whole wheat flour because I didn't have any corn starch, and it turned out fine, I think white flour would be better though because it has less of a texture.

Poor Mary, I think she needs some help in the kitchen.  This has been around since the beginning of time, I think.  I grew up on it.  Of course back then it was done in a double boiler, and every kitchen had something that could be used as such.  Now I do it in the Mic too.   To kick this up a notch, add a dollop of peanut butter.  Kids love it, and old folks do too.

Wow! This was so easy to make and tasted so good. Just one thing. If you're going more for the chocolate factor, you can try it without putting the vanilla extract in. Tasted more chocolatey that way in my opinion!

I was looking for a dessert recipe for a lunch. I wanted something quick and easy, with pantry staples, also. I really didn't expect it to thicken, as I seem to have some trouble with stove top puddings. After the 3 minutes, I had to add 5 more minutes at the 1 minute intervals. It started to thicken after the 4th. I used 2% milk. I would use that or whole milk to ensure it thickens properly. Only odd thing is, it seemed thicker before I put it in the fridge. It is also a tad sweet. However, I would consider making it again, for a dessert lunch. It can also be thickened up again with some whipped cream folded in anyhow. ty

This is the best chocolate pudding I have made with a milk substitute.  I used half almond milk and half coconut milk coffee creamer.  It turned out absolutely wonderful.  I poured the pudding into ice pop molds and it all took less then 5 minutes.  I can't wait for them to freeze.

Very good.  I added 1 Tbsp. butter, but not necessary.  I used dark cocoa one time and it was good too.  Also you could cook this in a 3 qt. saucepan on top of the stove.

This was pathetically easy- one glass measuring bowl and a whisk- and so fast.  You honestly don't miss the extra fat and richness of the egg.  I have tried this without chocolate to attempt a vanilla pudding and it wasn't that great.  However, with the recipe exactly as-is, it was delicious!!  If you use a sugar substitute (splenda, etc) it can be almost healthy as a good source of calcium.  As a special treat, I plan on serving this cold with fresh fruit in a fresh waffle cone bowl.  This is well worth saving the money and chemicals of a box pudding.

Oh. My. Gosh! I used Bournville cocoa powder and 1% milk and it was awesome. Hubby said it's the best chocolate pudding he's ever had and my 5yo actually licked her bowl clean :) which is a rare thing even with deserts! There's one serving left in the fridge which is calling my name as I type. I think I'm going to try it with organic 70% cocoa powder and chilli flakes and also with Bournville and peppermint extract & crushed candy canes come christmas. Will never use the powdered gunk again! Thank you Debra for this wonderful recipe :)

A bit strong on the cocoa flavor - we added more sugar and some butter at the end and it was much better.  An excellent quick recipe when you've got that chocolate craving!

This was pretty tasty and surprisingly easy! It was a bit sweet for my taste, so next time will try reducing the sugar to 1/3c, as others suggested. I also added a pinch of salt to the dry ingredients, and a pat of butter when done microwaving.  Thanks!

First time that I made chocolate pudding, it is cooling in the fridge but it tasted amazing! I never knew that chocolate pudding was so easy to make from scratch and I don't think I will ever be buying instant pudding from the store again, I can't wait to eat it, I will  be using this recipe again since my family loves pudding

Much less work than constant stirring with a wooden spoon in a saucepan, and the kitchen stays cooler as well! After the first batch, I tried some radical changes.  I took out all the sugar and substituted 1 Tablespoon of honey.  It's not as sweet as most people like it, but the chocolate flavor really jumps out at you, and it's much better for carbohydrate specific diets.  Then I tried stirring in chopped walnuts after cooking.  I also stirred in banana slices after cooking (not too green, but not too ripe, either).

While this recipe is amazingly easy -- the end result is very thick -- it really falls flat on flavor.  I would much rather take the extra ten minutes to cook a chocolate custard pudding on the stovetop.  If I ever made this recipe again, I would add more chocolate and reduce the sugar, since it is too sweet (and I have a serious sweet tooth) but that might negatively effect the texture.

After a long, difficult week at work, I saw this recipe and decided some comfort food was in order.  That it was a quick and easy recipe was even better.  To my surprise, this is also really good.  I'm eating it warm as I write this.  I used Dutch-process cocoa (premium high-fat stuff), slightly less than 3 Tbs cornstarch, and whisked in a pat of butter once it was finished cooking.  I will definitely keep this recipe!  Don't skip the vanilla--it really rounds out the flavor of the chocolate.

Four stars for finding another easy and great-tasting recipe that can replace the store-bought alternative!  After reading the reviews, it seemed best to add a pinch of salt to the dry ingredients, and also to add a bit of butter (I used 1 Tbsp.) with the vanilla.  I used another reviewer's suggestion to sit the bowl in cold water for a while after cooking (while stirring the whole time) to cool it down a little more quickly before refrigerating.  The taste is excellent, but I don't particularly care for the super thick consistency of it.  I wasn't expecting instant pudding consistency or anything, but this is THICK!  Next time I might cut down the cornstarch just a bit.

An incredibly tasty and ridiculously fast dessert!  I was craving chocolate pudding and this simple dish fit the bill.  I will NEVER buy a box pudding again!

The vanilla was great, but I think for the holidays I may put in some rum or coffee liqueur for a little kick.

Wow!  I was looking for a way to use up our milk before it turned and I ended up making two double batches of this!  I have three pies and about four little cups of pudding.  Keep microwaving till on the last cycle it really sticks to the spoon!  I thought I had overdone it and then the last batch was better than the first.

I did not change anything.

This is absolutely fantastic!  I reduced the sugar and vanilla and also added in a chopped banana - - could barely wait for this to cool.  A much healthier chocolate snack than ice cream, cookies or brownies.  Thank you - I'll be relying on this one for good!

This was soooo good!  I grew up eating homemade warm pudding with cream.  Yummmmm.  My mom never chilled her pudding and I can't see the need to chill it!  I was very happy to find this quick version of homemade pudding.  I had no problems at all with lumps or grainy texture.  I thoroughly wisked all the dry ingredients together first and then  did the same with the milk (I used evaporated).  I used the tip of adding a pinch of salt to cut any bitterness and I also used a tip from a friend to add a TBS of butter at the end with the vanilla.  I doubled the recipe with no problems at all.  The only change needed was extra cooking time.  
I highly recommend!!!!

I've just made the pudding and put it in the fridge. It looks great and I sampled some. The taste was great!! It was a little on the bitter side, not overly sweet as some others said. I was pleased though, since I love a little bitterness in my chocolate. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!!:)

I tweaked this a little...otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars!  I'm always on the look out for quick, wholesome, single-serve snacks.  I modified this recipe to fit my needs.  I mixed 1T sugar, 1T cocoa, and 2t cornstarch in a small pot, whisked in 1/2c skim milk, brought to a boil over low heat, and added 1/2t vanilla off the heat.  Ate it warm...yum!

For taste I'd rate this 4*s but given the ease of preparation, I have to add another star. I made a double batch (following madcook's instructions in her review) & froze half the batch as fudge pops for my grandsons.

I didn't have cornstarch, so subbed with flour after reading a couple of reviews here. Also, I did it on top of the stove after reading the review by gwendolyn028, mixing all the dry ingredients and on low heat, slowly pouring the milk and stirring continuously until it bubbled, stirring for one minute more and then turning off the heat. I left it to cool for five minutes as she suggested, stirring twice and adding a bit of margarine as I didn't have any butter on hand. I tried it warm, but it seemed like the dark chocolate taste overpowered the sugar, so I used plastic wrap and stuck it in the fridge. And some hours later....awesome! The dark chocolate taste was still there, but it went down fabulously, like greased gravity. It so soothes that sweet tooth. Thanks, I'll definitely be making this again!

I thought this was okay. It is a bit too sweet and it actually takes quite a bit to get thickened- but I also used skim milk and Wondra because I didn't have cornstarch.  I'd use whole milk in this.

Really good!  I read the recipe wrong and only did 1/3 cup sugar and it turned out perfect.  Also used Splenda instead of sugar and it was soooooo good and Weight Watchers friendly!  THANK YOU!

Delicious! I cooked it in a regular sauce pan, on the stove. I like sweet, but this turned out just a little too sweet. Will reduce sugar to 1/3 cup next time. It thickened perfectly, and had a nice rich chocolate flavor. I wish I had seen this recipe a long time ago. Will never buy boxed again.

Turned out fantastic.  I did it on the stove as I dont like cooking too much in microwaves.  I just did everything in a heavy saucepan.  I did however mix everything up in the pan first and then put it all in the blender to ensure all lumps were out but i guess you wisk them all out too. I will put in a homemade pie crust and then add some whipped cream.  Yum.

I LOVE this recipe.  I have been making it for a couple of years now.  You can certainly tailor it to your own tastes as well.  Instead of cornstarch, I use 3 tablespoons of unbleached all-purpose flour, and it's excellent. Also, I highly recommend using Hershey's Special Dark cocoa...even better than the regular cocoa!  Anyway, I have made it using almond milk, which tasted just as great!  I have also made it using 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of water (instead of 2 cups of milk) to cut down on calories.  Also, I use half the sugar (1/3 cup), and it still tastes amazing!  Additionally, I make it over the stove and not in the microwave.  I just toss all the ingredients in a small pot and whisk constantly until it thickens.

This was really easy to make and delicious.  I always have the stuff needed to make this on hand so I really can't see buying chocolate pudding mix anymore.  This totally fixed my chocolate craving in a great way.  Really tasty either still warm or fully cooled.

This was excellent! Can't believe velvety it came out, and how close was I to fixing my shelf with the chocolate I was craving! I did stir a lot through to get the velvety texture. I added choc chips with the vanilla and it was even more heavenly. My husband who is a big opponent of sugar thought that this would work better with about half or 3/4 of the recommended sugar. So I'll probably try that next time. Thank you!

The pudding is quite easy to make but has an off-taste. Not bad just not your typical chocolate pudding taste you're expecting. I might try it again - the ingredients are things you easily have on hand - but couple it with some whipped cream or maybe use it with a Mississippi Mud Cake.

Just put in the refrigerator.  The sample I got off the spoon was great.  Used Dutch Chocolate Cocoa witch is a dark cocoa.  I did double the recipe and put it in some nice goblets.  I used a pyrex 8 cup mixing bowl and didn't have any problems with  bubble over.  Added 2 Tbls butter because I doubled the recipe.  Can't wait to eat it after dinner.  Will become a staple in my kitchen.

This was good considering the amout of time it took to make, and just good in general! I was a little skeptical at first, because before I put it in the microwave it seemed like it was just a bubbly mess... but it came together after a few rounds in the microwave. It was VERY chocolatey though. I would reccomend only using 1/4 cup cocoa powder, because as is, it is a little hard to eat a full serving. A little too much vanilla as well. It was kind of overwhelming, both the chocolate and vanilla flavor. Try 1 teaspoon vanilla, and as others have suggested, mix in a tablespoon of butter with it. Overall, pretty tasty, quick, and creamy!

Just what I was looking for! Didn't have any cocoa powder on hand, so I used approximately 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup chocolate chips (which I added after mixing the milk into the dried ingredients). Added butter after cooking as suggested by other reviewers. Smooth, thick, sweet--and so much easier and less clean up than the stove top recipe I previously used for homemade pudding! Thanks for sharing!

I made this according to the recipe, other than adding 2 tablespoons of butter (per other reviewers' suggestions) when I added the vanilla.  This pudding is so incredibly good.  I tried it cold and didn't care for it.  When it's hot though, it's the best chocolate pudding I've ever tasted.

PHENOMENAL!! I'm not a fan of the microwave so I made it on the stove top. It took a little longer but good things come to those who wait. :-) I added the extra tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of dark rum..and the result was delish!!

i doubled it, and the cooking times needed to be altered; 3 times @ 3 minutes, then 3 times @ 1 minute, using a whip to stir well in between each time. i used amaretto instead of vanilla - yum!

very easy and fast....once you try this you'll never go back to the instant pudding powder. I used brown sugar and only 2 TBS cornstarch ..I think if you are planing to make a pudding pie 3 TBS  are good(for a jello like Pudding ) but I like mine more creamy .
I serve mine in small cups by making a layer in the bottom  of graham crackers( crumbs + drops of milk to stick the crumbs together ) then banana slices then the pudding then I sprinkle the pudding with nuts and chocolate chips.

Fantastic recipe.  I took the advice of adding a pinch of salt to the dry ingredients and a tablespoon of butter with the vanilla.  It turned out just outstanding.  There is no need to buy boxed pudding ever again with this recipe on hand.

I only had Nesquick powder, so I used 1 cup of Nesquick and omitted the white sugar and it came out great! Very thick and chocolatey, but not too sweet. I bet you could also use hot chocolate mix in a pinch.

Fast, easy, and very tasty! I cooked it for the first 3 minutes, then one minute more, and it was very, VERY thick. May try just cooking it for the initial 3 next time.

I used dark chocolate cocoa powder which gave it such a nice flavor! But I over-cooked it, so when refrigerated it became all rubbery. CAREFUL!! DO NOT OVER COOK!

This was really good!  I added 1/4 tsp of cardamom for a different flavor.  It was yummy, but don't add more than 1/4 tsp because it's VERY strong.  I also added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.

People...if making pudding from scratch is this easy, and good, and cheap; why in the world would someone use a boxed mix? I took advice from others and added the butter. Madcook's times were right on for a double batch. Be aware: it's hard to wait until it cools! Simply delicious :)

3 1/2 - 4 stars. It's not rich like a real pudding with eggs, but very easy and tasty if you are craving a dessert but don't want to take a lot of time. I can always use another quick dessert recipe!!

This recipe is seriously fool proof! The only modification I made was to add 1 T. butter in with the vanilla. Also I would recommend using a sifter to make sure all the lumps are out of your dry ingredients before you start adding the milk. The hardest part about this recipe is waiting for it to get cool enough to eat!

I made this on the stove top rather than the microwave so it took longer...Used a combo of black unsweetened cocoa and dutch process.  Also fresh milk right from the cow--The family LOVED it!  Thanks for the recipe.

I was looking for a simple recipe to make my own pudding for lunches. Wow, I had no idea it could be this easy!! I didn't watch it close enough the first time, and it got really lumpy. Pulled out my hand blender, and it fixed it in a few seconds! I have been having all sorts of fun adding things to this...frozen cherries and almond extract for a little antioxidants, slivered almonds and coconut, blueberries. It is delicious by itself. I use small storage containers, and make individual puddings. My husband and kids love them in their lunches, and with the added fruit and zero preservatives, they are more nutritious!

What an amazing recipe!!!! I decrease the sugar to 1/3C and it still always turns out awesome and sweet enough to satisfy! We always have a surplus of milk, so it is a great way to make sure the milk doesn't go to waste. We have this every week. =)

Sooo easy and delicious!  I used flour instead of cornstarch and added 1 tbsp unsalted butter once the pudding thickness was achieved.  Served in chocolate cups with shaved white chocolate and a tiny dollop of homemade whipped cream.  As one reviewer mentioned the posibillities are endless; add crushed butterfingers, oreo's or coffee liquer.... Will NEVER make the boxed variety again.

I have to knock a star off for the recipe itself which doesn't really say how long to nuke the pudding for. If I kept going for 2 minutes on high, i'd be in the kitchen for a while.  As for the taste once things started to thicken up, it was really good.

Bravo!  Why hadn't I thought of looking for a recipe before all these years?  My daughter really wanted some pudding after a surgery, and I was sad to find my pantry empty (of the box stuff, you know). So, determined to fulfill her wish, I figured I'd attempt one by scratch.  EASY & Delicious, what could be better?  I added a dash of salt & butter as others recommended.  So fab!

I made this to kill a sudden chocolate craving, and it did the trick! I made it with whole wheat flour instead of cornstarch, and it was delicious but not the best I've ever had. I think it tastes better with cornstarch, but it's fine either way. You can do this on the stove top (it's just as fast). Follow steps 1-2 but do it in a small saucepan over medium low heat. Keep whisking until it has thickened up (you may need to raise the heat to get it to bubble). After that, stir in the vanilla. This would taste even better with a tablespoon or so of butter or coconut oil stirred in, but it's fine just as is.

Ready in 10min,  without compromising taste and texture.   I did have a minor problem with controlling the amount of cornstarch, but that's probably because I used 'generous' amount of 3 tablespoons.  With slightly less starch it worked great.  Certainly a 5 star recipe.

I would give 5 stars, but........ The chocolate taste was not intense enough for me, had to add about 1/4 more of cocoa powder to suit my taste...... added real whipped cream inbetween layers, very good, then it tasted like chocolate mousse :0)  yum

I gave it 5 stars because I'm sure if you followed the recipe exactly it would be fantastic.  So good with so few ingredients!  That said, I made some changes.  Hubby is not a big cocoa fan so I reduced the cocoa to 1/4 cup and added a 1/4 cup of Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips, reduced the cornstarch to 2 tbsp, and, as others did, added a couple of pinches of salt and a tbsp. of butter at the end.  I cooked it on the stove because that seemed more "homemade".  I was still amazed at how quick it cooked up.  I always imagine pudding being a "stand over the stove forever" event but it was really fast and oh so yummy!  Packages never again.  Can't wait to try vanilla or maybe banana.

I have made this twice now and still haven't gotten the consistency correct.  I put in 3 tbsp. of cornstarch, but it was still too thin.  However, I thought it would thicken up when I put it in the fridge, but it was a big soupy mess!  I tried it the second time and probably put 4 tbsp. of cornstarch and that was way too much...almost jello-like.  I'm thinking 3 1/2 tbsp. would be a good combination.  I haven't mustered up the courage to attempt this a third time yet.  The flavor is great though; very chocolately and smooth texture.

I make this frequently, but using Splenda in place of the sugar. About 1 cup of it gives the right degree of sweetness. Often I find that I need more Splenda than the equivalent measure of sugar, especially when the dessert is to be refrigerated. I always put a very tiny pinch of baking soda in with my Hershey's cocoa in order to neutralize some of the acidity. It makes an excellent sugar free treat, and using skim milk keeps the calories down, too, without sacrificing flavor. If you fold in some sugar free Cool Whip, it can be transformed into a respectable sugar free mousse. Additionally, 1 tsp of vanilla is usually sufficient. Nice recipe for a quick chocolate fix.

Okay,I give this recipe a 3 because I have made this pudding twice,last night,I followed the steps exactly like written and all I got was a runny thin mess. This morning I only put in one cup of milk and it's better, I think it calls for too much vanilla but to each his own. I don't think I'll be making this again.

I'm thrilled to find this recipe!  My husband and i are vegetarian, and most store bought puddings/mixes contain gelatin.  Now we can have chocolate pudding again!  I used vanilla soymilk instead of milk, and a splash of dark rum instead of vanilla.  After the first 3 minutes, i stirred it, put it in for another minute, and it was done.  So easy. **UPDATE**  This makes AWESOME puddin' pops!

I like this.  I haven't officially eaten it yet, but I did taste it just before putting it in the fridge (it's easy for me to wait because dinner isn't ready yet!).  The vanilla at the end is absolutely NECESSARY.  I tasted the recipe both before and after adding vanilla.  After, it was sweeter, smoother, richer.  Much better.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I don't quite like the flavor the cocoa powder gives.  I will have to experiment with different forms of chocolate.  But overall a very good (and fast!) recipe, I won't be buying boxes of pudding anymore.

This recipe is about the best you can do with chocolate in fifteen minutes.  I used cake flour because I didn't have corn starch and added 1/4 cup of butter.  Turned out great.  As a side note, I have also tried adding various types of Baileys(Irish Cream, Mint Chocolate and Caramel) to it with great success.  I generally add about 4 oz for a mild flavor, but I have added 7 oz without it affecting the texture negatively.

We couldn't wait for this to cool and ate it warm.  I used powdered milk and water adding 3/4 cup powdered milk to the dry ingredients and mixed all with 1 3/4 cups of water.  It sure was rich.  We loved it. I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon before cooling.

Great when you want something chocolate and fast.  I added a dash of salt before cooking to help bring out flavors.  I also added 1 T butter along with the vanilla after it was cooked to make it a little fuller tasting.  Super easy.

Variation: I accidentally added the vanilla before microwaving and was disappointed that the mixture never thickened. Well, I was so in the mood for a chocolate fix that I drank the pudding. :) Turns out it's the best hot chocolate I've ever had!! This will replace my old hot cocoa recipe for sure!

Well, I am rating this as a 5 simply because it couldn't get any easier!  I rarely make pudding because you have to stand over it and hope it doesn't scorch... with this one its simply one bowl, one wisk and a quick beat each minute for only the last 3 minutes.  I added butter and vanilla as suggested and used the flour instead-- now I am just having to be patient for it to cool in the fridge. It tasted wonderful hot however. I just couldn't resist!

I try to shield away from box food. This pudding recipe was wonderful. It was for my little brother, so I used 2% organic milk and ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa powder. I microwaved it for 3 minutes more after the first initial 3 min. The pudding was thick and smooth. I shifted the dry ingredients before slowly adding the milk. I made it into  a parfait with lowfat cats cookie from trader joes, and peanut butter mixed with cool whip frozen (sim. to peanut butter pie w/o the powdered sugar) with chocolate sauce on top. Both my 15 and 23 brother loved it.

Mixed up quickly, but for me the issue is not how long it takes to cook pudding it is how long it takes to really chill.  Ok taste, not super rich and creamy.

This recipe is quick and easy. I didn't have any lumps because I whisked the dry ingredients until the cocoa and cornstarch were combined well. I added the milk 1/4 cup at a time and it turned out beautifully. Great for your chocolate fix.

Yum! Follow the advice of others to add butter in with the vanilla. Didn't have corn starch on hand, so used A/P flour instead - worked fine. My 2 yr old doesn't like store bought pudding, but devoured this! Will definitely be making this for my family often! Thanks for sharing!

It came out great the first time!  So easy, so creamy, so good.  I used non fat milk past its expiration date, and forgot the vanilla. I love chocolate, but this is really choclaty....is that a word?  Next time might cut back on the chocolate a bit, or maybe the vanilla would have balanced it out.  But I definitely will be doing this again...delicious.

What a great recipe!  And I'm thinking of different types/flavors of pudding I can make now.  Coconut milk perhaps instead of regular milk with coconut extract and no chocolate?  Seems the possibilities are endless!  Thank you!

I just made this! Wow, it came out perfectly! I doubled the recipe because I wanted to put it into a pie crust. So easy, & delicious! When I was thru I added cool whip, just folded it in, & then put it into the pie. Topped with a little more cool whip & sprinkled shaved chocolate on top. It tasted like a very expensive pie from a bakery. Chocolate cream mousse pie! Yum! And I tasted the pudding before adding the cool whip & it was so delicious. I just doubled all the ingredients, microwaved it for five minutes, took it out & really mixed it, put it back in for 2 minutes more, again stirred it, another 2 minutes and it was so thick, & creamy. Put on the plastic wrap & cooled it, added the cool whip, put it in the waiting pie crust & topped it, & had the most beautiful pie for my family tonight. They all raved & had two slices. 
This is definitely a keeper! Easy & delicious!

I followed the direction very carefully but some how I still ended up with chocolate soup. I even tried to add more corn starch after leaving it over night to set but that still did not help.

I added a pinch of regular table salt to the dry mix; whisked all dry ingredients together to assure no lumps and added a tablespoon of butter at the end.  After the initial three minutes of microwaving, I had to nuke it three times in one minute intervals and it was perfectly made.  Yum for my daughter who cannot have a lot of dairy with "traditional" homemade pudding.

This is my go to easy pudding recipe. I never do it in the microwave. It works just as well on the stove top - just stir until it is thickened.

This turned out watery for me with 3tbsp cornstarch using skim milk even after sitting in the fridge overnight.  Tried again with 4tbsp which corrected that.  Also you need a very deep bowl because it bubbles up quite a bit and will make a mess in the microwave if you are not careful.  

Better off cooking over medium heat on stovetop imho since you have to stand around watching it anyways. No problems with it bubbling over like in the microwave and takes about the same amount of time.

This is so easy and so delicious! I couldn't believe microwave pudding could taste so good. Microwave it in a deep bowl 'cause it bubbles up a bit when cooking.

Wow! Over the past several weeks I've tried several pudding recipes from this site, including Chocolate Cornstarch Pudding.  That is a stovetop recipe, but my family thought this one was better, with more of a cooked rather than instant pudding taste to it.  I followed others advice and whisked in a tablespoon of butter with the vanilla at the end.  I put it back in the microwave for 3 one minute intervals before it was done.  I debated on sticking it back in a fourth time, as it was still not as thick as I thought it should be.  While deciding, I whisked it another minute ( I'd been whisking for the minimum 2 minutes after each minute of cooking).  During that time it started to thicken up.  I'm glad I stopped cooking when I did, as it was super thick by the time I was ladeling it into the last of the four individual custard cups.  I think if I had cooked it longer it would have cooled to be near solid.  So when in doubt, whisk for the full four minutes before cooking an additional minute.  The lickings from the empty cooking bowl were so delicious, I hope this won't be eaten before dinner tonight!

This is amazing when looking for something sweet.
I used hazelnut extract because I didn't have vanilla on hand. It tasted great! This recipe works with 1% milk.

This was definitely among the best pudding I've had. How ever, I tinkered with the recipe just a wee bit; Instead of vanilla extract, I used pure vanilla, and like my peers, used 3 tablespoons of cornstarch rather than 3 teaspoons. When cooking, I found that it wouldn't thicken, so I neglected the 1 minute intervals in the microwave and threw the pudding in for 2 minutes. It thickened up perfectly after that.

I love this dessert!  It's quick and easy and so satisfying!  Because each microwave is different, you do have to adjust the timing.  I usually set my microwave for 10 minutes on high, stirring at half point. The recipe thickens as it cools so there's no need to get hasty if it still looks liquidy once the time is up.

I love this! I have times when I want pudding or a pie and this my go to! I add butter and salt to taste. I have made it with splenda and have great success (add 1/2 tablespoon of corn starch more than it calls for a quicker set up). Butter adds the creamer taste and salt compliments chocolate well.

I would rate 10 stars! I wish I would have found this site 17 years earlier!  I took gwendolyn028 suggestion and cooked it on the stove top, (since microwave watts vary) and it turned out perfect! Thank You Debra for the easy, delicious, recipe!

Fantastic very easy to make homemade pudding!!!!  I don't have a microwave so made it the old fashioned way on the stove.  Very quick with little effort.  I added all the dry ingredients to a medium sauce pan and mixed together.  Stirring continuously I slowly added 2 cups of cold milk to the dry ingredients and mixed well until completely incorporated into the dry ingredients. I then turn the heat on medium and stirred continuously until pudding started to bubble.  I added the vanilla and 1 tablespoon of butter and stirred in.  By that time the pudding was thick enough to pour into serving dishes.  This pudding is not too sweet and had a very rich chocolate flavor.  I suspect the intensity of the chocolate flavor depends on what brand of coco you use.  I used Scharffen Berger Natural Unsweetened Cocoa Powder which is very good.  If you want a pudding on the sweeter side add another 1/4 cup of sugar at the beginning. I agree with other reviewer that the added butter adds a nice rounded out flavor to the pudding.

I tried this recipe, but i wanted a more cakey consistency, so i added 2 tbsp's of flour, an mixed it making sure there were no lumps. I put it in the microwave for 4-5 minutes, and i turned out to be a chocolate pudding cake! =)

This makes a great pudding in very little time! I use Splenda in place of the sugar and have omitted the cocoa powder to make a plain vanilla pudding - it's also great served warm over fruit. I usually bump up the cocoa powder to 1/3 cup when I make the chocolate version for extra richness.

The first time I made this, I added cinnamon and it almost ruined the batch.  I either added too much or the flavors didn't mesh. The second time, I ommitted all flavoring including the vanilla (I had run out of it), added the butter as recommended and used half cream, half skim milk.  It was the best pudding I've ever had.  Also, the only bowl I had was pottery and I found that cooking the pudding 2 minutes instead of 1 between stirs was
perfect.  This pudding is easy, quick, and so delicious!

I actually used 1/3 cup sugar and 1/2 cup dark cocoa and soy milk instead of cow's milk.  It was easier for me to heat this on the stovetop, and I'm so pleased with the results.  This is waaaay better than the boxed stuff.

Wow!  I cook all the time and never really tried to make home made pudding before.  This is quicker and easier to make than the "instant" pudding I've bought for all these years.  The flavor is much richer.  Put chopped bananas in two of the ramekins and chopped strawberries and almonds in the other two for two nights worth of deserts.

Was looking for something cool and chocolatey to make that didn't require using the stove or oven as it's scorching hot outside and we're all melting.  I honestly did not expect such a rich and creamy pudding from the microwave, and easy to make to boot!  Need to watch it closely after the original 3 minutes, mine started to boil over halfway through the 2nd 1 minute interval

Perfect! And very, very easy. Follow exactly as directed and it comes out perfect.  I also substitute  1 tsp peppermint extract in my second batch. Tasted like a Girl Scout Cookie.
It doubles wonderfully. :D  Thank you Debra SOOO MUCH!

Needed a chocolate pudding (none in the pantry).  I have made many puddings from scratch over a double boiler.  Never again.  It took my microwave 5 minutes instead of the called for 2 to 4.  Just watch it and stir after each minute as instructed. 

Also, it developed the "pudding film" almost immediately, so have your plastic wrap ready to cover it.

Try this, and you'll never make boxed pudding again.  I LOVE this recipe!  This is no different from any other corn starch-thickened pudding recipe - but I love knowing how to do it in the microwave now.  It's my go-to recipe for when I want dessert but didn't think to make one.  I can whip this up and nuke it while I'm doing the dishes - by the time it cools, dinner is digested and I'm ready to serve dessert!  I've also left out the cocoa and made vanilla pudding - which I can also use in any application that calls for pastry cream, should need be.  Make it without cocoa and add shredded coconut, and you have coconut cream pie filling.  Try it - you won't regret it!

1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/3rd cup of cocoa was way, way too sweet and chocolatey for my tastes.  I reduced the amounts to 1/3rd and 1/4th respectively and it tastes nearly identical to Jell-O chocolate pudding cups.  Fantastic recipe, thanks for sharing.

I accidentally read the ingredients wrong and used 3 cups of milk instead of 2...oops. But it worked to my advantage this morning. I put the soupy pudding, 1 very ripe banana, 1 cup of frozen strawberries and 1/4 cup of peanut butter in a blender and whipped it up. It was sooo yummy!! The pudding had a fantastic taste. It's way better than boxed instant. I will definitely be making again, this time using the right amount of milk :)

Fabulously fast and soo sooooo tasty! I reduced the sugar by 25% because I like really "dark" tasting chocolate items, and wanted to reduce the sugar/calories just a smidge. As written it would be just as delicious - just more a standard pudding sweetness. This was so fast, so tasty, that I agree with all the reviewers who say they'll avoid boxed pudding mixes in the future. All the ingredients in this recipe are commonly on hand as well.

Oh, I did use soy milk instead of dairy milk, and it thickened up quite nicely - no problems whatsoever.

This pudding is delicious! Thanks for sharing this recipe. The only reason why I did not give it a 5 star rating is because I used flour instead of cornstarch. I don't think there should be a big difference, but still, excellent recipe. Quick and easy to follow.

We made this gluten, dairy free. Using canned coconut milk, and using CACo powder, love the easy and the taste.
Would like to reduce sugar, maybe next time, use honey and stevia... But for today, it was yummy! THank you.

Perfect!  I decided I wanted some pudding, didn't have any instant pudding in the house, didn't want to go to the store.

Solution?  AllRecipes.com!  Found this recipe, and it's sooo easy, and sooo tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it worked out just perfectly.  Thanks. :)

I can't stop making this pudding! Its so incredibly easy and delicious.  I added about 1/8 tsp of salt with he sugar, cocoa, and cornstarch then I added a tablespoon of butter with the vanilla...perfect! The hardest part about this recipe is waiting for it to cool enough before eating it.

Good, but the skin that forms on top while it's in the fridge is a tad icky. Plastic wrap over the container is a must to lessen this effect.

This is a great recipe.  I made it a little more decadent by adding another 1/3 cup of sugar, 1/2 heavy whipping cream and 2 tablespoons of butter. I mixed in the vanilla, whipping cream and butter after the pudding cooked.  It was truly the best chocolate pudding I have ever made.

This is my new favorite recipe. It only took about 5 minutes to whip up and 5 minutes to fully cook, and it tastes amazing, much better than instant pudding.  I will definitely be making this again, maybe even for Thanksgiving!

This is my husband's favorite recipe for chocolate pudding. The original version is super fast and delicious, but I have changed to this recipe: 1/3 cup sugar (too sweet for our taste), 1/2 cup baking cocoa (fewer calories), 3 Tbs flour (3 minutes, then 2x one minute each in our microwave to thicken), the rest the same. We also love orange or almond extract in place of the vanilla sometimes, too. Thanks for the recipe! It is wonderful for a quick low-cal chocolate treat!

Yummy!  The family gobbled this one up.  The only thing I would change is to put a little less sugar in it next time.  Otherwise, it's perfect.

Super fast, easy & rich (I might add less chocolate next time).  No more store bought pudding for us!

I used fat free milk and it still came out thick.  I think I'll try adding some fat free butter next time.

I thought I should rate this since I CAN'T STOP MAKING AND EATING IT!!!! I didn't even know I liked pudding. I can't believe how delicious it is for being so easy. It's one of the few recipes in the world I make exactly as written, and it is AWESOME. Even when it doesn't turn out to be smooth the little cocoa powder chunks taste like truffle bits. MMM. The only bad part is waiting for it to cool. Haha. I make it with whole milk. If you love chocolate, this is the recipe for you! Sometimes I make chocolate yogurt by mixing a bit of this with some plain whole yogurt.

Wow.  I followed the directions exactly and really just did not like this recipe at all.  The pudding wasn't sweet enough and had a very chalky chocolate taste.  I will say that it was very easy and fast, so I may try it again with modifications, but as is, this isn't a keeper.

This was good ... however, I tried it before I added the vanilla extract and thought it was great. After adding the vanilla and chilling, I felt like the vanilla was overpowering. If I make it again I think I'll leave out the vanilla or severely reduce it. Otherwise, it was an insanely easy dessert to make!

Unbelievable!  I didn't have unsweetened cocoa powder, only Ghiradelli Double Hot Chocolate mix.  So I used that (full amount per instructions) and left out the sugar.  I did add the pinch of salt and a pat of butter and I also sprinkled in some instant espresso powder.  BAM, real chocolate pudding in minutes that tastes unreal.  Thank you for posting!

OMG, this pudding is so good and so easy! I'm trying to make healthier choices for my kids. They love the little pudding packs, but I was shocked by all of the crazy ingredients in them. I decided to bite the bullet and make them homemade pudding. Little did I know it would only take me about 10 minutes! I wish I had done this years ago.  I followed the advice of other posters and added a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of butter. It couldn't be better. Thank you so much for the recipe, I'll be making this all the time from now on!

These make great pudding pops!  I followed the directions exactly and used all SKIM milk and the pudding turned out great!  This recipe made 16 small pudding pops that my kids LOVED!  They were so excited!  And it's all natural too!  You wouldn't believe some of the stuff they put in even the boxed puddings!  I think next time I will make a vanilla pudding along with this recipe and layer them in popcicle molds to make choclate & vanilla pudding pops!  Fantastic recipe!

After reading the reviews, I was very excited to try this.  Overall the texture was good, possibly a little too thick.  Worse thing was too much cocoa!!!!  Could use probably 1/2 what the recipe calls for and still be good and chocolatey. It tasted almost like "semi-sweet" chocolate. Not what I was hoping for. I'll do some tweaking and see how it goes. BTW, I did add the pinch of salt and a little butter as others have recommended.

This pudding is DELICIOUS!  I followed the directions with the exception of using a cup of skim and a cup of 2% milk and it turned out so tasty.  I doubt I will ever need to use boxed chocolate pudding again.

AMAZING.  Easy and delicious.  I used flour instead of cornstarch and it worked perfectly well.  Also, I stirred in a bit of almond liqueur instead of the vanilla.  It gave it a fantastic kick!

This is such a great recipe! I was actually shocked at how good it turned out, because as a lebanese, we have a very similar recipe that we make with milk, cornstarch, sugar and orange blossom water instead of cocoa powder. We do not call it pudding though, and it tastes nothing like pudding. This recipe however, I thought was going to be similar. I was wrong! This DOES taste like pudding, only much better than store bought, and oh so easy and fast to make! I loved it, the kids loved it. It would be awesome as a chocolate cake filling, as for chocolate torte or something! Perfect taste and texture, didn't change a thing. Thanks so much for this great recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I love homemade pudding but hate sitting at the stove stirring forever.  Will make over and over.  If it is too chocolately or bitter for you, stir in a couple tablespoons of peanut butter when still hot.

This is a great recipe that I make often. This rating is based on the recipe as is. I did find there was a tiny bit of bitterness to it from the cocoa so I now add a pinch of salt to counteract that.

Goals: Decadent-tasting dishes that are as low in sugar and fat as possible. ---  I made the pudding exactly as described and found it yummy so I made it a second time with a slight alteration. I decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup and used non-fat milk. I found less sugar intensified the chocolate flavor, which I LOVED. And I honestly don't notice a difference between whole milk and fat-free milk. --- I made this in the microwave, but I actually find the stovetop version less error-prone. With small kids I am easily distracted and with 1-minute intervals I am more likely to forget there's pudding in the microwave! Whereas if I set the mixture over medium heat and stir it until it begins to thicken, I am forced to not get distracted. --- For extra flavor-enhancement, consider adding 1/2 teaspoon powdered instant espresso or coffee. (As recommended by a similar recipe, New-Fashioned Chocolate Pudding, on cooking.com.)

I love this pudding!  I have made it several times and finally remembered to review it.  I do not use the microwave; prefer the stovetop.  As it is great on its own, I have combined it with a graham cracker crust and homeade whipped cream for special deserts.  I also add butter and vanilla after it is cooked.

Great recipe! I did add 1 tbsp of butter at then end. It turned out great for how fast and easy it was. My husband is a chef and he said, "wow, that's not bad". Next time I think I'll use a little more cocoa powder for a deeper chocolate flavour.

I love this recipe.  I never buy chocolate pudding box mix anymore.  I just make sure to have cornstarch and cocoa powder on hand.  The only thing I do different is add a little less cocoa powder otherwise I think it is a little too rich.  But that's my preference.  Great recipe though, super easy and super yummy!

I'm giving this 5 stars because my husband, who is not a big dessert person, asks me to make this at least a couple of times a week.  Adding a Tbsp of butter at the end makes a big difference in taste.  Super easy!!!

This is awesome! When it was cooking in the microwave I was scared that it wouldn't come together smoothly but I just stirred it together and it became smooth and wonderful! I did add salt and butter as suggested and it made a huge difference! I also added coconut extract to make it taste like an almond joy! I love the strong chocolate flavor but it can be overwhelming so I mixed together Fage 2% greek yogurt with vanilla and splenda and a little Cinnamon and layered the pudding and the yogurt. It was a great balance of flavors! :)

Unfortunately, I mismeasured my vanilla. Other than that, I think this is pretty good, but my husband thinks it is too bitter (perhaps because of my vanilla goof...)

Really, really good ... I love chocolate, and this is delicious and easy. I have a small microwave (in a tiny 1920s kitchen), so I had to cook and stir a bit longer at the end to get it to thicken, but once it did, oh man. Followed the recipe exactly, vanilla and all. I tried some warm and chilled the rest as a chocolate pie filling. Yum.

I've made this recipe three times in less than a week!  A fabulous warm, chocolatey dessert.  WOW.  I normally add a Tblsp. of margarine with the vanilla, but honestly, I forgot the vanilla this last time and didn't really notice it too much.  Soooo great!  Thanks for a FANTABULOUS recipe!

My favorite kind of recipe. quick, easy and delivers what it promises! This is easy to make with ingredients that most people have in their kitchen and it is very yummy and comforting. It reminds me how simple it is to make most things that supermarkets want to convince us we need a mix for.

I'm certainly not a pudding connoisseur by any means but I do enjoy chocolate pudding.  This is quick, simple and tastes great.  For something I can whip up in under 10 mins, I think it's great!  Thanks.

I have also made this as a dairy-free version for my dairy allergic child and it was equally as yummy.  I just substituted vanilla almond milk for the milk and vanilla.

This pudding recipe is absolutely AWESOME!!  I don't think I could go back to boxed pudding again!  I used Special Dark cocoa and made ultimate dark chocolate pudding that we loved!  You can't ask for a faster dessert than 5 ingredients and 5 minutes in the microwave!  Make sure you use a large enough bowl to avoid boil over in the microwave, though!  You won't be sorry whipping this delicious dessert up!  :-)

Easy, fast, delicious, and doesn't come from a mix. If you put plastic wrap over the top, against the surface, no skin forms in the fridge. Try it, it's great!

Very good and very quick. I have used half a vanilla bean instead of the vanilla and sometimes stir in a tablespoon of butter as per the other reviews.

This pudding recipe is fantastic and easy!!  I did add two tablespoons of butter when I added the vanilla. If you have a convection microwave it only takes about 2 1/2 mn after the initial 3mn.  My husband loved it and we will not be buying boxes of jello anymore. Thankyou for such a great recipe!!

Very good, I like the idea of making my own pudding rather than using the box mix with all those other additives. I did detect a slight corn-starchy taste, but not overpowering.  Also, I must admit I forgot to add the vanilla at the end, so maybe that would have smoothed out the flavor a bit. I had a little trouble getting rid of the lumps in my cocoa and cornstarch, so might consider running it thru the sifter first. Will continue to play with this recipe.

With some tweaking, this will be a great recipe.  My first observations are: too thick (I'll use 2 T. of cornstarch next time) and not quite sweet enough.  Other than that, good recipe.

This is so good. I doubled the recipe so I added two Tbs of butter like recommended and I added cinnamon. My husband and kids loved it. So much better than instant.

Any time you can pull together a fantastic dessert from things you really do have in your pantry, it's a 5 star!!  Nothing extraordinary here, but it beats Jell-O by a mile, and satisfies a chocolate craving.

Excellent. If you are a fan of rich chocolate in desserts like those found in better restaurants, I suggest adding some bittersweet chocolate (I used 1/2 ounce which = 1 square of Ghirardelli)Added it to liquid ingredients prior to thickening.  Oh, my! Pudding served warm with this addition is beyond words.

Ok so I am not a baker and this recipe proved it lol! as easy as it seemed I messed it up twice. I am thinking the first time I didnt microwave long enough, it was more like syrup, so we put it over icecream!  and the second time I could build a snowman out of it, it was so thick (maybe too long in microwave this time) At least I was able to thin it down a bit. the taste was great though either way. One of these days I will be able to make a dessert!

WOW!!! My husband loves chocolate pudding and now I can make it homemade.  I cooked this on top of the stove and found it easier for me to watch and stir as it thickened.  VERY YUMMY!!

Really great chocolate flavor.  My pudding didn't thicken up as much as I thought it should even though I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I'll try another Tbs of corn starch.  I'm going to try omitting the chocolate and have vanilla pudding.  This was easy enough for my boys to help out too!

I have made this recipe dozens of times at home, and it's wonderful!  (I add the pat of butter and pinch of salt as others have suggested.)  My children love it.  I put the recipe to another great use recently - I tutor first and second graders in an inner-city elementary school.  For a holiday treat I brought in the recipe, ingredients and tools, and we went into the teachers' lounge and made warm chocolate pudding!  The kids were delighted to help measure and stir, and they were also delighted to eat the pudding :) I sent them home with pre-measured bags of the dry ingredients and the recipe on a card.  They had a different kind of lesson that day, and something warm for their tummies as well.

I can't believe I just made homemade pudding in the microwave!  This tastes delicious - just like the cook-&-serve kind my husband prefers.  But no standing at the stove and stirring for half an hour!  I'm quite impressed and thrilled to have found a way to use up milk a day before its expiration.  I took the advice of others and added butter at the end.

Easy and delicious! If you have a powerful microwave keep an eye on it during the first three minutes.  My first batch overflowed all over the bowl and microwave turntable.  What was left was still great.

This was so quick to make and very tasty - especially if you are having a chocolate craving and need a quick fix!  I followed the recipe exactly but added a pat of butter at the end with the vanilla based on suggestions from other reviewers.  I thought it was very good, but, my husband was not crazy about the texture.  He likes the smooth & silky instant type pudding and this definitely has a thicker consistency of a cooked pudding.  I am going to try cooking it a little less next time to see if it doesn't get quite as thick.

I rated this recipe based on following the ingredients and instructions exactly; it tastes good and is very easy to prepare.  That being said, I've fiddled with it a bit and now make it with a two changes.  I use 1/3 C. of sugar, and it's still plenty sweet; that saves getting out two dry measuring cups.  The other change is the addition of a big spoonful of peanut butter.  I stir it in while the pudding is still hot, and then I usually start eating right away.  This pudding is great warm or chilled.

Quik,super simple and a hit with kid' of all ages and adult's too...what could better??? Box mixes have nothing on this recipe.Thnx for a great recipe i  will be making this often :)*Update* I just finished making this again only this time i used 1 cup brown sugar omitted the cocoa powder,Added 1/4 cup unsalted butter & added just a pinch of salt to make butterscotch pudding.Work out GREAT! My daughter was eating it right out of the bowl.A bit on the seet side but i hoping it subsides a bit in the cooling process.but other than that fallowed the recipe as always.A nice change from just chocolate pudding :)

Very good recipe. My husband loves this, and requests it at least once a week.  I found it a bit sweet, so the second time I made it, I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, and the cocoa to 1/4 cup.  I found that this reduction didn't compromise the rich chocolate flavor at all.  I also added a pinch of cinnamon to give it a little bit of the Mexican chocolate flavor. Yum!

Very thick, not overly sweet and very chocolately.  I loved that you could make it in the microwave, no need to heat the house on a hot summers day.

Wow!  So easy and it tastes so good!  I was skeptical since the ingredients were so plain but this is a great dessert!  I'd probably even serve it to guests.  Scales down nicely for one serve (cook for 3 1 minute bursts) and works well with Splenda, making a nearly guilt-free pudding!  I also tried it without the cocoa and it's still great!

Mine came out a little too thick...I might try mixing in some cool whip to see if it improves the taste and texture.  Instead of a full 2 tsps. of vanilla, I used 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of peppermint extract (and I added about a TBS. of butter).  I probably won't make this again.

Kinda strange to me with the cornstarch and all, but it didn't really taste bad.

This pudding was awful! I can't believe how much cocoa it called for . After eating one serving, both my husband and I felt sick. We both had headaches and stomachaches. Maybe this would have been good if there had been a 1/4 of the cocoa. Wow, caffine overload!

WOW!!  This was too easy.  I too am pregnant and had a craving but hate the box stuff and wasn't going to slave over the stove for an hour.  Doubled this, but opted for using the stove after all because our microwave is probably slower than the stove.  Had to use up some whipping cream so used 2 cups cream and 3 cups 2% milk.  Also added a pinch of salt (takes out the bitternes - try it - works for home brewed coffee too, just a pinch in with the ground beans before perc'ing).  Also used Splenda instead of sugar - added about a 1/2 cup extra - got a sweet tooth.  Worst part is waiting for it to cool!!!  PS will NOT use cream next time - just had to use it up - although it was 'creamy' ;)  I think it muted the chocolate flavour a bit though.  Will also be making 'fudgicles' with the remainder of the batch.  Can't wait to try them.  Thanks a billion for sharing!!

Tasty and easy. I made a quarter of the recipe over the stove. I dumped the dry ingredients [including Droste Dutch-processed cocoa] into a pot and gradually added the milk [1% lowfat milk]. I stirred constantly with a fork until everything seemed dissolved. Then I turned on the heat and kept it low while constantly stirring and scraping down the sides. In five minutes or so I had a delicious and chocolate-y treat. Thick and smooth, too. As good as store-bought pudding. [Probably better since you actually know all the ingredients going in it.]

This recipe is Fantastic! When I was a little girl, my grandmother made me hot chocolate gravy and biscuits for breakfast. I used flour instead of cornstarch and Viola! Chocolate Gravy. It tasted exactly the same. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe! Very good warm and cold.

Very creamy texture! I was happily suprised that it wasn't even slightly lumpy. Easy to make and loved that it's a one-bowl kinda recipe. Conveinent in that it takes just basic ingredients that I always have on hand. Only thing I'm not crazy over was the slightly bitter taste. I think next time I make this I'll try it with slightly less cocoa and slightly more sugar.

Good recipe, but it is really not a good idea to microwave milk/dairy as the microwave alters the structure of nutrients in food.  I would suggest using the stove, especially if you are going to give the pudding to your children.

This was so easy to make in the microwave! I used flour instead of cornstarch and put a few banana slices on the bottom of the bowls then poured the pudding over it. My boyfriend loved it!

This was fast, easy, and so delicious!  My 5 year old said it tasted better than the chocolate pudding he had at a restaurant last week!  I had mine in the microwave for a total of 6 minutes and used a whisk for all stirring to keep it nice and smooth!  So rich and thick!  I will make this again!

Easy and so much better than the boxed stuff. I make this on the stovetop using FF evap milk and a half cup FF milk. I omit the vanilla (I swear I can't taste it). I have used this to fill cream puffs, in which case I use an extra tablespoon of cornstarch so it sets a little harder.

I made this pudding with Splenda instead of sugar and it turned out wonderfully. We don't have a microwave, so I made it on the stovetop, which went well and was still very quick- I think it took less than 10 min from start to finish. I did toss in a couple tablespoons of peanut butter since I am using it to make a chocolate peanut butter banana pie. Very good, and it is likely I'll just make this recipe from now on and never buy the boxed stuff again!

I was pregnant and craving chocolate pudding, and this fit the bill.  Maybe not the hands down best we've ever made but the convenience made up for it.  Also, the first time I tried it, it seemed thick enough before we added the butter and vanilla but it wasn't and didn't set up in the fridge - I stuck it back in the microwave for a couple minutes and it thickened just fine!  It was great that we could "rescue" it.  Very yummy, and my 1 year old couldn't get enough.  Good made with part coconut milk too as a previous reviewer suggested.  I might try evaporated milk next time so it is creamier....

This recipe turned out very well, except I used soymilk because my family is lactose intolerant. And because this was last minute, I didn't have cornstarch or flour, so I used pancake mix instead.

My first chocolate pudding attempt, so the only thing I have to compare it to is instant pudding..Be sure to use a medium microwaveable bowl as mine had a tendency to boil over...added 1 Tbls of butter just before the vanilla as others suggested...much better than the instant...very quick and easy too...Thx DBon!!

After just one minute in microwave  it seemed to thicken , did one minute more and the texture is like glue. Is it possible three tablespoons of cornstarch is too much?

In my 1250 watt microwave, I only needed one 1-minute cooking interval after the initial 3 minutes -- shortened the recipe time that much more and eliminated any boiling over.  As suggested by others, I added a little butter and salt after the cooking time and agree with most everyone else that this is a definite keeper -- easy, fast, and tastes super!  Why would I ever go back to boxed pudding?

I made this with all organic ingredients. It's easy, quick and quite good. Make sure you use cornstarch and not baking powder! (Just a little kitchen-upset-humor - I did not correctly label my organic baking powder container, and, no amount of sugar can make baking powder taste good. Hahaha!)

Great recipe. Great dessert. Top it with fresh strawberries for a semi-elegant look.

Delicious recipe! My pudding wasn’t thickening as I expected originally, but then I realized that my microwave is very low wattage, and you can’t put it on high. I proceeded to cook it for longer/ more intervals and it quickly thickened! Be hesitant with this though, your microwave may be at a higher wattage than mine. All in all, wonderful and easy!

excellent, easy recipe!! Comes together very quickly. I folded whipped topping into my pudding to make it more mousse-like, and used it in a chocolate trifle. Delicious!! I will make this again even though I normally don't like chocolate pudding. This is way better than the packages.

I made this on the stove, in a medium saucepan. It tasted great! I think that the problem for some folks who have complained about the texture being too liquid is that their mixture never reached the necessary degree of heat for the cornstarch to be activated as a thickening element. You have to get to the point where the liquid mixture is just-boiling — a few bubbles begin to come up — whisking or stirring it briskly and constantly. (The temperature of your milk can also affect the process, since very cold milk will take a bit longer to reach boiling.) This recipe is relatively easy and quick, but it did take me more than 15 minutes and, unless you prefer your pudding hot, you have to account for extra time chilling it in the fridge.

Was more like 4-6 minutes of one minute cooking intervals after the initial 3 minutes. But  after the two extra minutes it was definitely pudding like. I also added a tsp of Medaglia d'oro because I had it kicking around and always heard that coffee intensifies chocolate flavor. Anyway, YES! I will make this again.

So delicious! This satisfied my cravings in a timely manner. I added 2 teaspoons of butter and a pinch of salt, and heated on the stovetop instead. My family and I finished it off while still warm -- it was too hard to resist! Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Needed a quick chocolate fix and this was so quick and easy,  took some advice from previous reviewers and added some butter and used bourbon in lieu of vanilla.  Turned out delicious but four it a little rubbery.  Just wondering if some whipped cream would lighten it up?

Delicious! However....I did something wrong with this - my first time making this. I zapped it, kept stirring...I suggest to keep going. I stopped, thinking it was thick enough. Nope.  I did use the 3T, not 3tsp of cornstarch. However, not to worry - I pulled out the ice cream maker and made ice cream with it. A good save. I WILL make this again and will count the number of extra minute zaps/stirs to write it down for future use. Just the perfect amount of sweetness for me - not too sweet with a deep, chocolate flavor. Thanks so much for the recipe! Forgot to mention - this tastes exactly like what used to be Fresh and Easy's dark chocolate gelato when frozen.

I often do not have much luck with cornstarch-based puddings, often winding up with a runny mess. It's probably just me. Sometimes, though, a cornstarch-based pudding turns out great for me, and this recipe is one example of that. I just have to remember to keep an eye on it while cooking. After cooking, it does not last very long.

This recipe tastes great but I followed the recipe to a T aside from subsituting cornstartch for flour and I did not come out like others said, even like someone else you commented about using flower. Wasn't used as a pudding but I reheated it and poured it onto a moist chocolate cake to make a partial Self Saucing Cake and was amazing!
Tastes good but I guess I had bad luck?? If i try it again I will try figure out what went wrong otherwise I do recommend this recipe tastes great!

This was incredibly simple. The microwave trick bypassed the old sauce pan method and it turned out as expected. I'll definitely try this again.

Wow!  This was wonderful and easy. I had cocoa, milk, sugar and cornstarch.  Easy peasy and cheap. I’m a vegetarian, so I don’t use box puddings, so this was perfect. I don’t have a microwave so I made it stovetop. Yum

If I had been patient enough to make this "quick & easy" pudding, it may have been good. My microwave was far too small to hold all of the pudding so I moved to the stove top. That didn't work either though. I was opening the microwave every ten seconds to make sure it didn't overflow & make a mess in my microwave. (which happened anyways.) the pudding thickens at different places, so I did get to try the delicious, shiny black pudding. I would suggest dividing this recipe in half, or less.

I'm not sure this is quite as good as a pudding made on the stove top but it's still good and I've made it several times when I needed a chocolate fix. I've never had a problem with it thickening up properly in the microwave. 
I really like that it takes me less time than making pudding on the stove and it's better than standing over a hot stove in the summer.

I used the stove-top directions someone else posted and they worked perfectly, although it felt like it took forever to boil. One minute I felt like I'd been standing there staring hit chocolate for an hour, the next BAM chocolate velvet

Quick, easy. I did not wait and stir for 2-4 minutes between.  I used my fave whisk and just gave it a good whisk between heatings.  First cook time for 3 minutes then twice at 1 minute each, it came out thick and creamy.  I also had some heavy cream so i used 1.5 cups milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream.

Awesome! Followed the recipe near exactly, but set it to one serving. The problem is, depending on the serving size, it changes the time you have to cook it for. I made it to 1:30 before it started bubbling over, then took it out and stirred at 30 second intervals. Otherwise, PERFECT!!!

How easy is this?!? We are cutting down on sugar, so I only used 1/4c sugar and mashed a banana in it for a bit more sweetness and nutrition and it was bliss! We have always loved warm cooked pudding and this gets rid of 'the box' for a healthier alternative - especially if you use coconut or cashew milk.

So good, so easy. I halved the recipe and didn't even make a mess in the microwave. Try coconut sugar for a little more depth of flavor. ??

I thought I was doing something wrong when it didn't thicken.  Turns out I just wasn't cooking it long enough in the microwave.  After I read some reviews about an alternative cooking method involving boiling on the stovetop, I realized that my microwave wattage just isn't high enough, and I definitely hadn't been cooking anywhere near boiling.  So I left it in for significantly longer (while watching it, of course), and it turned out perfect.

I used about 2/3 the amount of sugar, which was about right for me.

It's a very easy to make dessert. 

I've also tried with coffee ( Cappuccino ) instead of cocoa powder. That also taste great!

Thanks for this easy, delicious pudding recipe! Reading the reviews made me want chocolate pudding right now, so I jumped up and made some. Practically immediate gratification, and very little clean up. I was out of white sugar, but even made using brown sugar the pudding tasted great. Lovely comfort food.

Very easy to make with simple ingredients. I didn't read the directions first so mine turned out a little lumpy but the taste and flavor were amazing! Great for a quick dessert especially if you're craving chocolate.

I used the ingredients list for this recipe but cooked it on my stovetop, as I don't have a microwave. For stovetop: whisk all ingredients except for the vanilla over medium heat until the pudding coats the back of a spoon well. About 10 min. for me. Also, to avoid clumping, combine dry ingredients well first with cold milk, and then turn on the heat. Added 1 tbsp butter with the vanilla after removed from heat, based on a similar recipe. Great basic list of ingredients for a chocolate pudding.

Tasty for a quick hit of chocolate.  I did half a recipe and added marshmallows which was delish.  Next time I'm going to put in peanut butter and will add diced bananas at a future date.  Much quicker and less hassle then my "regular" chocolate pudding recipe.

I used mint extract instead of vanilla, and it took 4 minutes after the initial 3 minutes to get the perfect thick consistency. It's pretty good, but a little too much cocoa. Next time I'll try it with a little less.

It was so easy and tasted great. I used dark chocolate cocoa powder. The next time  I'm going to use almond milk.

It was definitely quick and easy but it was more sweet and less chocolatey, which isn't really what I was looking for.

II have been using this recipe for about 2 years now.  I love it.  I don't use the microwave ( too much stopping and starting)but the top of the stove and a whisk.  It only takes a couple of minutes and never fails.

I halved the ingredients for two people, but I found trouble with it thickening. In the end, I added the full amount of cornstarch plus an extra tablespoon to get it to proper 'pudding' consistency.

The other amounts of ingredients were perfect however - quick, easy, filling, and delicious! Couldn't ask for more. Definitely making this again with some different variations.

This is super easy to make and tastes delicious! I added a bit of cinnamon with the vanilla. Perfectly smooth and thick chocolate pudding. I plan on making this with my toddler class! The kids will love the mixing and almost instantaneous results. A delicious and tasty science/cooking experiment.

I just made two batches. I followed one reviewers directions for stove top as I prefer that method. I made the first batch true to recipe except I substituted 1/2 c of heavy cream I had on hand to the 11/2 c of milk to make the 2c of milk. Soooo smooth and creamy. I hated to let it cool. For the second batch, I followed another reviewer's advice and swapped brown sugar for white sugar to make butterscotch, my husband's favorite!  Definitely a new dessert staple in our home

Fast and delicious! I had a graham  cracker pie crust to fill so I whipped this yummy recipe up, sprinkled some marshmallows in the bottom of crust and poured the pudding over it. Once it was chilled I plopped cool whip and chocolate sprinkles on top. Voila! Pie! I would love to eat just the pudding by the spoonfuls though!  Thanks for sharing!

Quick, easy, and delicious.  The only changes I make are adding a pinch of salt with the dry ingredients and stirring in a bit of butter with the vanilla.  Great with nutella or peanut butter stirred in after cooking too.

This is a wonderful recipe! Very fast, no added fillers or chemicals and low sodium (just what is naturally occurring in the milk.) I did reduce the sugar to 6 Tablespoons and that was more than sweet enough for us.

The only two things I found I had to do a bit differently were, first, I added a pinch of salt with the dry ingredients and second,  I had to let it thoroughly chill in the fridge.  Otherwise, it was too runny.  After it had set up for about an hour the texture, flavor and consistency were awesome.  I most definitely will be making this again!

Instead of popping in microwave mix all together on  stove, slowly and low heat. Mix the corn startch in about 1/3 cold water, then mix slowly into the warming mixture. Pudding will begin to get creamer and creamer!

I love this pudding recipe, extremely easy and minimal ingredients. I added a dash of salt and next time would consider less sugar, maybe 1/3 cup or less. I cooked it for 2 minutes at 1-minute intervals after the initial 3 minutes (total 5 minutes). I was a little afraid of the milk boiling over, but as long as you use a big bowl (I did) you'll be fine.

Pudding didn't thicken very much at all even after refrigeration. Not sweet enough for me with the amount of sugar in recipe...I had to add much more. Developed clumps when I took out of fridge. Won't try this one again.

I tried this easy recipe and I only had one issue. It tasted wonderful and had a great chocolate goodness. When I added the vanilla I totally lost the chocolate flavor. I added less than called for too. I will try this again without the vanilla. My grandmother made the best pies in the world and she never added vanilla. JMHO.

Yum! Great fast pudding. I changed the serving size to 2, since I didn't have a big enough bowl, but was delicious. Also, I had a few lumps, but I think that was my fault, because the recipe specifically cautions against it. Thanks, Debra for a pretty perfect pudding!

Made this tonight, first of all I say its Very tasty! I used 1% milk and also used Vanilla Rice milk all together, thats what I had in the fridge. It worked out! 
2ndly; the recipe doesnt say what size bowl to use, please use a larger one at least 3 or 4 x the amount of all the ingredients, as in the microwave it was exploding over in my bowl ??
Thanks for the recipe ?

Amazing! Spooned it into little glasses over crushed cookies and then put the glasses in the fridge to set. Served with cream at the table which people poured over the chocolate. Everyone loved it. So easy to make ahead for a dinner party.

I have made this time and time again and it comes out perfect every time. My entire family loves it!  (I don't see how the person could have kept cooking it for 30 minutes without it thickening. I wonder if she left out the cornstarch. When I stir after the 2nd one minute interval,5 minutes total, it starts to thicken and look shiny. I usually stop there, especially if I am refrigerating for a while.)

Edited to add:  This is as good as your cocoa powder.  We always buy good cocoa powder and it is scrumptious every time.  Once, we bought cheaper cocoa powder in a yellow container with red lid and it was terrible.  Use the good cocoa powder and you won't go wrong.

Super easy and delicious chocolatey taste.  A bit too sweet for my taste but that can be easily changed next time!  Would be so great with sliced bananas inside and fresh whipped cream on top!  I can see this being an awesome go-to dessert

I remember having this as a kid. This is the perfect recipe. You can also use almond milk,  and instead of cocoa I put in some chocolate peanut butter protein powder and it was amazing. I still agree with all others in the comments that say you should put in butter as well!

I made this for my beau after he stated he wanted some pudding.  It was a little bitter so I think that I will cut down a bit on the cocoa powder next time.  The texture and consistency were great though.

The taste is awesome, however, we ran into snags while trying to make it. We doubled the recipe but otherwise followed it to the letter. After the fourth time we took it out of the microwave it was still not getting thick. We decided to put it into the refrigerator to see if that would help, but two hours later it was still the consistency of milk. I ended up putting it into a saucepan and heating it over medium heat, stirring constantly. Once it began to boil it thickened up immediately. I put it back in the fridge to cool and continue to thicken. We were able to eat it about an hour later. Yummy!

I love this recipe... So easy!! I do not own a microwave, so I made it on the stove top. I brought the heat up slowly so it didn't come to an actual boil & whisked constantly. Be careful, it thickens fairly quickly once it is sufficiently heated. Disperse into cups and put into the fridge for 30 mins and it is ready :)

I ran out of milk so I substituted with coconut milk and boy was it good! A trick for making smooth and creamy pudding without a strainer is to mix the sugar, salt, cornstarch, and cocoa together first and then slowly adding milk until you get a smooth paste. Then, continue to gradually add milk. Whisk constantly on the stove, focusing especially the sides and you're good to go. I added a pinch of instant coffee to bring out more of the chocolate flavor.

Fantastic! I'm on a hypoglycemic diet, so always looking for something to satisfy my sweet tooth. I used Special Dark cocoa and added a bit of butter, like some recommended. I had my husband taste it and he couldn't believe how good it is. This is now part of my All-Recipe recipe box! BTW, I did need the 3rd 1-minute round in the microwave.

This is awesome! I add about 1/4 tsp. of instant coffee, use dark cocoa powder and 1% milk. I was a waitress in a coffee shop long ago, and the chef always used to mix a little coffee in with the hot fudge topping- it enhances the chocolate flavor. This is yummy and relatively low fat!

This was beyond my expectations. Had a late night craving for something chocolate and creamy....and quick.It is rich and creamy and scrumptious. I prepared it in the micro cooker from Pampered Chef. Worked like a charm.This is definitely a keeper and will be my go-to recipe for chocolate pudding - late night or anytime!

I used the exact ingredients portion of this recipe and cooked it on the stovetop... what a treat! The texture was perfect (not lumpy at all, even though I used only a wooden spoon, not a whisk), and the cocoa-sugar ratio is perfect; not too sweet with a rich, chocolately flavor. Even without making it in the microwave this was super fast. I will be making this again and again.

I made this recipe on a stove top, and it turned out beautifully... with only a few changes.
One time I made this, it turned out extremely lumpy, almost threw it. That was my fault. 
When making this recipe, remember to mix the cornstarch and cocoa into the sugar, and add to the milk slowly while whisking. Otherwise, it will be runny, and have hard lumps of cornstarch and cocoa. :(
I love dark chocolate, but there was a bit too much chocolate for me. The second time I made this, I used less cocoa. (maybe around 1/4 cup) 
I loved it. 
Another change I made was to add a bit more sugar. (1/2 cup + 2 to 4 extra spoonfuls) 
Someone mentioned adding butter for the texture. I added 2 Tablespoons, and I loved the texture. It was smooth, and hardened into a sort of custard when cooled. 
4 servings, what a joke! I ate half in one sitting. This stuff is good!
This recipe turns out just like store bought pudding, except for a wonderful chocolate taste, and just a hint of sweetness.  
Only giving 4 stars because I happened to change the original so much...

Amazing! SO easy & delicious! I couldn't stop eating it warm, waiting for it to cool enough to cover & put in fridge. I just now tasted it after it's been in fridge all night and still love it. I used 12oz canned goats milk (undiluted)+ 4oz water. I messed up by adding vanilla at the same time as the milk, but that didn't seem to hurt the flavor. This is so much easier than standing over the stove & making egg type custards and I will be making it often!

Made this using 2% milk and a little less than 1/2 cup sugar substitute.  It definitely was easy and the texture was great. It wasn't sweet enough so would use the full 1/2 cup of sugar next time and dark cocoa powder would be perfect. If fat and calories mean nothing to you, definitely add the butter.

I like pudding to taste more custardy, but this was great for a quick chocolate fix.  I replaced 1/4 cup of milk with Bailey's Irish Cream, and added the pat of butter and a pinch of salt as other reviews suggested.  I did this stovetop.  It takes a little longer, but I like the process and control better.  Just mix the dry ingredients together in the saucepan and add the milk (and Bailey's!), stir and cook over medium heat until it has bubbled one minute (turns thick).  It filled 4 ramekins.  I refrigerated two and served two warm with whipped cream and a ripe strawberry.  ummmhmmm

I don't have a microwave, so I cooked this over medium heat on the stove top, brought it to a boil, cooked for 2 minutes.  Then I added 2 tablespoons butter along with the vanilla.  YUMMY!

I tried this recipe tonight, and I loved it. it was so much easier with out eggs which always have the potential of scrambling. But, the only thing i would change is this, I think three tbsp of corn starch might be too much, next time i will try it with maybe one and a half or two tbsp of corn starch. also i chose not to put it in the microwave, i did it on the stove top and it worked much better. also you could make up the powder part and put it into either glass jars, to give away, or sandwich bags that you can store and use when you are in the mood.... love this recipe so awesome... its not royal dark and sweet cook and serve ( i will forever search for a recipe that tastes like it) but it was awesome!!!! thinking of trying it with the unsweetened bakers chocolate as well...

Yum, yum, yum!  I made a chocolate cream pie with it.  Cooked pudding is sooo much better than instant and I don't think it took any longer to prepare and no worries about burning it since it was cooked in the microwave.

Great recipe!  I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk, and a 1/3 cup splenda.  Left everything else the same.  Added a little extra cocoa after tasting it raw.  Can't wait to try different flavors.

This recipe is abosolutely amazing. Since I am allergic to dairy, I substituted the milk for vanilla soy milk and it enhanced the flavors remarkably! Even adding small candies to the top of this pudding was wonderful. I WILL be recommending this to my friends!

We enjoyed it.  For those with lactose issues, I substituted rice milk and it worked just fine.  I will probably cut the cocoa down a little next time as it seemed like the chocolate/sugar proportion was a little off as it was a little more bitter than most puddings.  Still overall a hit!

I came across this recipe about two weeks ago and only whipped it up tonight to satisfy a sudden craving. I wasn't expecting much, but it came out PERFECT! My husband could not believe i made it and so quickly. It was smooth and SO very chocolately. I ate one before it even cooled properly and inhaled another once they had cooled (I had spooned them into plastic dessert cups to cool and set). This is awesome. Thanks for posting. I WILL make this again by spooning it over mini marshmallows while its hot as recommended by another reviewer. Cant wait.

Fold in real whipped cream (prepared to your taste), for a rich and airy faux mousse - DELICIOUS!!!

I use Splenda in place of all sugar, fat free organic milk, and sometimesI add coconut extract. It satisfies my chocolate craving after a meal.

Tasty and quick. We magically ran out of cornstarch so I used tapioca starch. I also used a can of coconut milk instead of milk. between the different milk and starches it had a different texture then normal pudding, but the coconut taste was super good so I'm hoping it was just the tapioca starch.

I stuck this in the microwave fairly sceptical but this really worked! Thanks for adding this recipe! For anyone who wants to know more about it, be super careful with lumps. No matter how careful you are you will end up with lumps but don't worry, just stir it in. Even better with whipped cream.

This makes a really tasty pudding, loved it. BUT makes sure your microwave is working properly. Mine ain't what it used to be and I had to finish this in a double boiler.

I've made this several times and my family loves this easy, delicious dessert!  One note:  DO NOT DOUBLE!!  I wanted to make a double batch, but it wouldn't jell enough for pudding. I made chocolate pudding pops out of it rather than throw it all away, but I'll never try to double the recipe again!  BTW, we don't add the vanilla; it's fine without it.

I have been wanting to make a pudding for a while now. I am so glad I came across this recipe. This is the easiest and the most delicious dessert ever! I have found my go to recipe now. Also, as it was my first time making a pudding, I made it on top of a double boiler and it turned out great :D  Thank you so much for this recipe. My family has been asking me to make it a second time.

This comes together very easily, and does attain a nice thickness.  However, like others have said, it's a bit smoother in taste and texture with the addition of a bit of butter or margarine and a small pinch of salt. (I used sea salt, along with organic cane sugar.) Also, to add richness and make it a bit more fluid, I worked in one beaten egg after about 6 minutes, tempering the egg with part of the cooked pudding mixture before whisking it all together and cooking another minute or two. Also, as others note, it's terrific while warm.

Gotta say, it's a winner! Quick,easy, delish and inexpensive has all of my favorite criteria for a recipe I'll use again and again. Lots of opportunity for creativity. Low fat,sugar free, different flavorings (brandy,mint) add fruit when you plate it like strawberries or bananas. You just can't lose with this recipe. Thanks for sharing it with us!

This makes it possible to whip up dessert while finishing dinner preparations! Better than instant pudding from the market.,I used extra dark cocoa, and used 1 cup coconut milk with 1 cup half and half, rather than 2 cups of milk. 
Sure to please everyone who is still a child at heart.

This recipe was easy and fantastic AS WRITTEN and it gets 5 stars.
To lessen the calories, instead of all white sugar I make it with 1/4 cup Splenda and 1/4 cup white sugar.  I tried substituting Splenda for all the sugar and I thought it had a funny taste.  I also use skim milk. I do add a couple of ingredients to make it more to my taste.  I add 1 tsp instant coffee and then when I eat the pudding I pour some coffee liquer in and mix it up.  I will not be buying instant chocolate pudding again.

I have made this twice, the first time exactly as written.  It was very good if you like dark chocolate.  I prefer milk chocolate.  The second time I made it, I reduced the chocolate to 1/4 cup.  It was perfect.  After stirring in the vanilla I also stirred in a teaspoon or two of butter, just as I would do if I were making it on the stovetop.  Yummy. Thanks for the recipe.

So easy....so good! Used a large bowl to avoid boil over. Only had to cook the extra 2 minutes. Added 2 tbsp butter along with vanilla. Creamiest texture and richest deep chocolate taste you could hope for!

I had no cornstarch and used flour instead. I searched and  found that for every tablespoon of cornstarch was 3 tablespoons of flour. So I went with that.....this pudding was way too thick, maybe the info I got on the starch to flour ratio was off???? Kids said flavor was good, just way to thick to eat. Will try again since it is a very easy recipe and next time I will have cornstarch on hand. Thanks!

Pretty good. Too chocolatey though. Tasted much better when i reduced the cocoa to 1/4 cup and increased sugar to 3/4 cup.

This recipe makes an amazing vanilla pudding if you leave out the cocoa.

I made delicious chocolate and vanilla pudding pops with this recipe. I poured the pudding into muffin cups(i dont have molds) and stuck a popsicle stick with a banana on it in the center of the cups, then froze it in the freezer. yum yum yum!!!

I made a vegan version with soy milk and it came out Great! rich and creamy and so easy to make. I'll be making this all the time for my kids. I bet it would be good with ground flax seeds and frozen or fresh  berries to make it a "healthy" desert/snack.

A tip: 1-3 tablespoons of this pudding works well as a syrup to make chocolate milk or hot chocolate.  Mixes easily and is delicious!

My review: I liked this, but I found it both a bit sweet and a bit chocolatey; I would have preferred it was more balanced in favour of creaminess.  I also found it separated and thinned a bit overnight, but that could have been because I had to use potato starch and brown sugar instead of the exact ingredients listed.

Super easy and tasty. I had everything handy when I was dying for a sugar fix. I'm not a huge fan of cornstarch puddings as they tend to be a little grainy but when you're desperate it does hit the spot.I did it on the stove top rather than the microwave and it worked like  charm.

This really is a fast easy chocolate pudding. I think next time I will try adding salt and butter like other reviewers have stated. It's thick and rich but the flavor falls a hair bit flat, I think the butter and salt will pop the flavor just that extra bit.  I used a large microwave dish and didn't have any issues with it boiling over.I will definitely be making again.

Really tasty and couldn't be easier. I amped up the flavor by reducing the sugar by 2 tablespoons, added 1 teaspoon of espresso powder and a pinch of salt, and substituted Kahlua for some of the vanilla. 

When you want a chocolate pudding that doesn't use eggs this is a great recipe.

Not bad. The texture was more jelly than creamy like I was hoping for. Use a good quality cocoa powder; you'll notice the difference in flavour.

What's not to love? It's chocolate, it's fast, and only takes a few ingredients. I used skim milk and it was still awesome. I am a make-from-scratch kind of girl and very rarely use a microwave, so I was pleasantly surprised this turned out so well. I may even cut the sugar back a little next time to make for a darker chocolate flavor. Just be sure to keep an eye on it and stir it every minute or so. Thanks for the recipe!

5 stars as is but if you put a little more into it you will have a delicious chocolate custard from the microwave!   I reduced the cornstarch to 2 tbs heat for 2 min on high.  Put 2 egg yolks on a medium bowl and whisk.  Take pudding out of microwave and temper the egg yolks. I just slowly add 1/2 cup or so of the hot liquid into the yolks while whisking constantly.  Then pour the egg mixture back into the pudding, whisking the whole time.  Place back in microwave and cook at 1 min intervals until done.  I also add a handful of semi sweet mini morsels during the last min or at the end.  Just mix well.  If you are worried about lumps, push through a seive.  It is soooo good.

This is the first pudding i've made without eggs.Doubled the recipe and made an ice box cake with graham crackers.It took me back 50 years and I felt ten again! This is a keeper.Cooked it on the stovetop,it was worth the time.This is the first review I've done on anything but after reading the review from the woman who couldn't get it to thicken I thought why blame the recipe because you obviously did something wrong.That's why so many 5 star reviews. I've had the same experience a few times but i know it was because i messed up.Sorry it ruined your valentines day but you should give it another try.You may have made it before it was corrected to 3 tbs. That would be why it didn'nt thicken.

I wasn't in a hurry, so I did it the old fashioned way, on the stove.  I did add salt and butter as some others have.  I think next time I'll halve the vanilla as well.  But overall, this is a great way to make pudding when you don't want to use up a dozen eggs for it.  Thanks for the recipe.  It came out great.

I've made other cocoa-based puddings, but this one was way too sweet and cornstarchy. I think that with less of each it would have been much better.

Well, it was a cold January day and I needed a hearty, yummy dessert for dinner guests, something I could make at the last minute with ingredients I had on hand. This came together so quickly and easily. Used Guittard cocoa resulting in a dark chocolate pudding, oh my. I layered crumbled homemade chocolate crinkle cookies with the pudding in parfait glasses, what a lovely presentation. First time making the chocolate pudding and am I glad I used this recipe, bookmarking it now! (I forgot the vanilla and otherwise followed recipe exactly, no need for butter... taste was so rich!)

This was great! The consistency was perfect.  I've made it a handful of times now for a quick chocolate fix.  The first time it was too bitter for my tastes so I added a little less cocoa powder than called for and it came out delicious.  Adding a tad of butter was yummy too.  IMPORTANT: make sure to use a big bowl even if you half or quarter the recipe (have done both, taste/texture is always perfect either way)....I made the mistake of using a smaller bowl when I made just 1 serving and it exploded everywhere.

Best way to describe how it came out is chocolate custard. It looked very wrong when put it in the fridge but don't worry it turns out to be chocolate heaven. Its quite heavy so think less is possibly more in this case.

I've already made it multiple times. This is probably the best pudding I've ever had. And the best part of all is that there's none of that extra stuff you get with store bought. My husband and daughter love it too.

I made this pudding last night for supper.  It was so much better than the box.  The only thing I would do different is put only 1 tsp vanilla in it.  It was just a little too strong for me.  It is a lot easier than cooking on the stove.  Thank you for this recipe.

Yum!  a real keeper for those nights when you need a little rich chocolate.  Almost as easy as instant but MUCH tastier.  I like it warm too, as does hubby.

This was very good!! I made it for my boyfriend as a quick and simple treat on a cold/rainy day; he loved it! 
Personally I skipped the vanilla for the funky smell and taste it gave it, without the vanilla it was 10x better. Very chocolatey, moist and creamy.

Wowie!  This is super yummy.  During the microwaving section when you microwave 1 minute, stir, etc.  I microwaved it one minute stirred, and thought it seemed shiny and thick.  I gave it 30 seconds more, then stopped with the microwaving.  And it worked very well.  Great chocolate flavor, and it was a hit for someone who had had dental work and needed something soft to eat.  Thank you for this recipe.  I'd give it more stars if I could.  Oh, and I used powdered, nonfat milk and it turned out thick like pudding should.

Quick and delicious for any chocoholic craving!! Love the velvety consistency. I used the recipe as it stands, but cooked it on the stovetop. (Just whisk in the vanilla after you remove from the heat.) Next time, I will add a pinch of salt for balance and maybe a pat of butter, just cuz. Mmmmm! I like the sliced banana idea too. Thanks!

I ran out of cocoa, so I used instant mocha cappucino powder instead. Also, I only made 2 servings. 
I microwaved it for 2 minutes (for the first step) and it almost (literally) exploded! Thank goodness that I had plastic wrap (I poked a few holes). 
Then I stirred it at 30 seconds intervals. The cooking time for that was about 2 minutes.

I love this recipe! It definitely has more of a dark chocolate flavor. It is so easy and so delicious. Don't forget the plastic wrap over top. Yum!

I thought this was great - not being a pudding connoisseur, it tasted like chocolate pudding should, as far as I could tell! I used skim milk as well - it may have taken a bit longer to thicken - maybe 5 one-minute sessions? but tasted great. I think some people may be having trouble with the pudding maintaining a consistent temp - i.e. if you stir too long between the 1-minute cooks it might not be getting hot enough to thicken. Don't stir for any less than 2 min though.

I was craving chocolate pudding so bad ,i made this for a late night snack and I dont like it!!! I'm so sad. It came out looking good and the right thickness but it tasted like dark chocolate and I hate dark chocolate! My husband loves dark chocolate but he doesn't like this either.

This recipe was fabulous.  I love homemade pudding. I refuse to come near instant pudding with a ten foot pole.  However I didn't make it very often because I had to spend 20 minutes whisking the milk to keep it from burning.  Not anymore!!  I couldn't believe how easy it was!  It tastes just like I spent a half hour standing over a hot stove!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good and chocolately.  Much better than store bought versions.  The reason I'm giving it four stars is because I scaled this down to one serving and the texture didn't turn out right.  I'm not sure what went wrong.

Really excellent. Made per directions the first time and found the vanilla overwhelming, this may be due to it being pure vanilla from Mexico. The other two times I halved the vanilla and it was perfect.  Usually have to do 3-4 of the one minute nukes in the microwave.  So easy and I always have the ingredients on hand.

Great recipe! The only changes I made were to omit the vanilla because it clashed with the cocoa and gave it an odd flavor.  I also don't refrigerate it but just cool in dishes for 5 minutes. My family loves it, even my dad who doesn't like chocolate pudding says it's the best he's tried.

For convenience, cost, and fat content (with skim milk) this is definitely a five star recipe. I've made it twice now. This time I made it as filling for a chocolate cream pie. I  have made this several more times and just put a 1 to 1.5 tablespoons of salted butter in it along with the vanilla. Couldn't be better!

Excellent pudding!  I usually cut the cocoa down to 1/4 cup, and use 2 tablespoons of cornstarch.

This was so quick and easy I can't believe I ever bought the box.  I wish it was just a tad more chocolate-y, but I'm going to try adding some extras next time and see if that works. :)  I reduced the milk in this to 1 3/4 c. because I was trying to make it into a chocolate pie filling.  We still ended up eating the pie out of bowls but it had good flavor.

This is pretty good.  I had to add another TBSP of cornstarch to keep it from being runny (my first attempt made a pudding soup).  Also, don't use Splenda to save calories -- it's not worth it.  Be a rebel!

My son and I just made this pudding and everyone loved it.  We doubled it for our group of 7, and added a beaten egg, tempered, after it had cooked fully, then cooked it for another minute or two.  Super easy, super fast and it tastes great.

I make these into frozen pudding pops for the kids.  I use a little less cocoa so it's not too rich for them, about 1/4 C instead of 1/3.

I made this because i was getting my wisdom teethh removed, so I made it the day before. I had tried a couple of bites of it the same day I made it and it was great but after the next day it was even better after sitting the fridge for all night. I didn't make any changes, I didn't feel like it needed it. Thanks for the great recipe. I will be making this again since I just got my wisdom teeth out yesterday =/ and I need something cold AND good!

DECADENT! this recipe is amazing as is but chocolate chips make everything 100x better so i threw some in after it was adequately chilled. I kept stirring it even in the refrigerator mostly cos i couldn't wait but that helped not 'set' the pudding like it were molded and topped with a blob of whipped cream it turned into a 5 star dessert sans tedium. definitely a keeper.

This pudding is so simple and fast to make. I use almost 1/2 c Splenda instead of sugar and I add a few chocolate chips for a extra zing of chocolate! I also add a pinch of salt to the dry ingredients. It's so simple to make that I haven't bought any boxed pudding in months.

I will not be able to go back to a box mix. I thought this was very good and very easy. I made this as the recipe states. Only gave it 4 stars because the consistency was a little thick. Made it again tonight with the suggestions of a few others to add melted butter at the end and a little salt. It's very yummy and worth making!

What I love about this recipe is the simplicity of making it in the microwave with ingredients that you most likely have on hand.  With that said, the recipe as is gives more of a rich hot chocolate taste.  Which is a good taste mind you but not that pudding taste I was looking for.  I dumped in about a 1/3 of a can of sweetened condensed milk when it was all done and stirred it in really well.  Then it was the taste I was after.  So, so, yummy. Thank you for this recipe.  I had no idea I could make an incredible chocolate pudding in the microwave.

This was really a good chocolate pudding, but I found that, as much as I love chocolate, I tasted too much of the cocoa. Next time I will try adding more sugar and/or less cocoa. The consistency was perfect and this was really quite good, so I think some tweaking will make it even better.

I accidentally used 1/3 cup sugar and 1/4 cup cocoa powder.  This ended up being a good thing though because I thought even the 1/4 cup cocoa powder was too chocolaty.  Incidentally, my fiance thought it could have used MORE cocoa powder.  Next time I'm going to try using 1/2 cup sugar, and about 2 tablespoons cocoa powder to give it a milder taste.  I also look forward to trying this with almond extract and other extracts, and using brown sugar and no cocoa to make butterscotch pudding.  There are so many possibilities!

This is quick and easy and came out at just the right consistency. I will definitely try this again! Next time, though, I think I'll use a little less vanilla. It had a bit of an alcohol taste.

Yumm!! I used Splenda and flour instead of sugar and cornstarch, and it still worked. Just make sure you don't overcook it -- I did once, and it boiled over and had a horrible texture. As another reviewer suggested, I'm playing with the flavors. Plain vanilla, no cocoa, is good, too!

The pudding was great, but I wasn't sure when to refrigerate it.  I kept eating it hot from the microwave!!  I definitely need to try the vanilla version, but when I left out the pudding, I turned back into a puddle :( well, i have to say that the taste was prettyf good.

I am from India. I saw the recipe only two days back. My daughter was feeling very low and she wanted something sweet but not a cake. I made this and Wow!!!!!!!!. It was excellent.I followed the recipe as it was but also added little butter and salt at the last as mentioned in a review before. My daughter had it very hot. it was superb. And the rest I covered with a cling wrap and we all ate today. It was very very smooth and tasty. Easy to Make and EXCELLENT. Thankyou for the recipe.

Will never buy a pudding in a box again!    This is a FAST, easy recipe with only 5 ingredients and ready in less than 10 minutes of time.    The result is a smooth, creamy and best of all CHOCOLATELY pudding that beats anything else I have tasted.

This was the perfect desert I was looking for, chocolate pudding. Easy recipe and few ingredients. My only mistake was to not look after the bowl inside the microwave after the 3min heating. I WAS mixing every 1min, but after the 3rd minute (total 6mins in the microwave), it exploded. I scooped up most of it and everything was fine afterwards. I was wondering if I should leave the butter out, but I decided to follow the crowd and add a tablespoon maybe a bit less into the bowl and it came out more creamy and soft. The end was just perfect for me, I just wished that I made more while I had the ingredients out so I won't have to take them out again real soon. My sister personally thought it wasn't sweet enough, but I thought the sweetness was perfect. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!! Definite 5 Star.

I had no idea homemade chocolate pudding could be so quick & easy, and I had all the ingredients on hand!  The texture was just perfect, so smooth & creamy.  Mine took 6 minutes to thicken in my micro.  The only mistake I made was to add more cocoa that the recipe called for (a little less than 1/2 cup), and my husband & I both thought it was a little too overpowering.  Next time I will use exactly the amount the recipe says.  Will definitely make again!

This was very good, but not quite as luxurious as I'd hoped. A similar recipe in one of my cookbooks adds 2 eggs and says they can be omitted but recommends increasing the cornstarch to 5 tbsp. I don't have a microwave where I'm staying so had to do it stovetop and that definitely was not a "hasty" way to do it. I will play with the recipe -- maybe try adding an egg next time, and a touch more cocoa for a really rich flavor -- and when I get it perfect will serve for guests with fresh raspberries on top for a very elegant dessert.

Fast and easy - better than a mix.  I would have liked it a little bit sweeter though.  Can't beat it if you are looking for a chocolate fix in a hurry.

Quick, easy and satisfying!  Only complaint is the chill time - I could not stay away from this long enough to let it chill properly (although, warm chocolate pudding is delicious, I must say!)  I added a tbsp or so of butter at the end, as I usually use the Hershey's recipe and that calls for butter.  Gives it a rich flavor.

I have only made this once and loved it! Next time I will decrease the vanilla to 1 tsp as I found it too strong. I didn't bother with the saran before cooling since I didn't want to put plastic on a hot surface (it actually says so on the plastic wrap box) We don't mind the chocolate film that forms anyways.

I would like to give 4 1/2 stars...definitely 5 stars for ease, and four stars for taste.  It tastes really good (my daughter and I just shared a bowl and it isn't even cool yet), but I will probably add a little more cocoa powder next time to boost the chocolate factor.  Will definitely make again, thank you for the recipe!

This pudding was really good and really easy to make. The only issue that I had was that it was not sweet enough, but my kids still loved it. I'll just add more sugar next time. UPDATE: I just made this again on the stove and I added 1/4 salt, 1TBS butter, and an additional 1/4 cup sugar. It was really good.

I'm not a huge fan of pudding, but this was pretty good.  I did change one thing.  I replaced a teaspoon of vanilla extract with coconut extract.  And have also stirred in chopped strawberries.

Awesome recipe! Do add 1T butter/margarine when it comes out, it really enhances the flavor! You will be amazed at how simple & delicious this recipe is!

Quick, easy and delicious.  When I saw the recipe didn't call for butter or eggs, I didn't expect it to be that good but I was wrong. I will agree with some that it does lack something but not enough that I will never make the recipe again.  I am going to add a little salt next time and see if that does the trick.  I didn't use a microwave since the recipe didn't saw what watt microwave to use.  That will definitely make a difference in how the pudding will turn out.  I cooked it on the stove top which is not hard just takes some time.  I refrigerated it just until we were done with dinner.  It was still slightly warm when we ate it.  My son loved it and my husband had seconds.  I am really glad I found this recipe since I try to stay away from boxed foods as much as I can.

Creamy chocolate heaven.  I made it over the stovetop instead of the microwave and added butter as others suggested.  Turned out great and will make it again soon.

I'm not really sure how this recipe recieved such high marks across the board - I was expecting something specacular!  I agree with the review by MISSMOON. Although, I will say if you're having a chocolate craving - it is chocolate.    It severely lacked any depth.  The flavor was flat.  I thought maybe you could add a little salt to help it, but never bothered to try it again, so I can't tell you if that would've helped or not.  All things considered, if you're having a cocolate craving, go look for another recipe.

Oh boy. I wanted this to be so good like everyone has mentioned. I know the rave reviews don't lie, but I have too disagree. I swear, I made this recipe exactly as it said.. even added butter to it. It looked wonderful, even tasted great. I don't know if I should have let it cool first before putting in the fridge (though it did say serve cold) but the texture and the taste changed. It was like eating thick mud, and didn't have the flavor it once had. I was nervous about making a microwave pudding... will have to look for another pudding recipe.

Oh my goodness, this is so wonderful! It is very similiar to a recipe my babysitter made me when I was a child. My trick is to sift the sugar, cornstarch and cocoa before letting the milk touch them. It comes out smoother that way. Also, using evaporated milk..even nonfat...makes it super creamy. I do this on the stovetop because I the smell brings back great memories. And I, too, add a pat of butter. I don't know why, but that's what my babysitter did. :) OUTSTANDING recipe!

This is a very good and EASY pudding recipe.  The only thing I really did differently is cook it on the stove, I didn't want mine to boil over in the microwave like some people said happened to them.  So I brought it to the place where it was basically nice and hot and about ready to boil and then stirred it with a whisk and stood over the stove stirring it for about 3 minutes (I set the timer).  Like most other people I added a pinch of salt and then butter after it was done cooking!! Yummy and easy!

This chocolate pudding is 10 times better than instant pudding packages. It has such a yummy chocolate flavor,too. This was easy to make in the microwave.  Plus, it is very quick. This was very tasty.

Mmm mmm GOOD!!! This is actually quicker than instant in my opinion as you don't have to get out the ol hand mixer or injure your arm mixing away by hand. I used Splenda and skim milk and it turned out great. As others have said this is a dark chocolate flavor if your looking for sweet than this probably isn't the recipe for you. Thanx so much the recipe.

This versatile recipe can make chocolate relatively guilt-free. I used extra-dark cocoa, added a tablespoon of ground flaxseed, and stirred in some tart dried cherries along with the vanilla. It was rich and sophisticated. Next time I'll try adding some cinnamon.

Mine turned out a bit thick the first time - will reduce the cornstarch and cooking time a bit next time I prepare. I added a bit of butter and just one tsp. vanilla. The pinch of salt is probably a good idea.  Chocolatey and satisfying. Excellent for time involved. 4 stars because it's not quite as good as Grandma's.

Made the pudding on the stove instead of the microwave with great results.  Used 2% milk and added the dollop of butter at the end.  Just a quick and easy pudding that tasted thick and delicious!  Cheap, tasty and quick - what could be better than that?

This chocolate pudding tasted better than anything I have ever made from a box.  Next time I make it I will decrease the sugar to 1/3 a cup.  I found it too sweet for my liking.

I have made this recipe twice a week for the last 3 weeks.  My family and friends can get enough of it!  I have changed the recipe just a little. I use 1/2 Hershey Special Dark coco powder and 1/2 Hershey Original coco powder. Once the pudding comes out of the micro I add the vanilla and a small pat of butter.  It made the pudding very smooth and delicious.

This was easy to make and very tasty. I added butter, as per other suggestions, and added some milk chocolate chips and skor pieces at the end.  My husband and I like frozen desserts, so I poured the pudding into individual containers and popped them in the freezer overnight. Yum.

Love it.  I mix a whole lot of it up, except for the milk and vanilla, and keep it in an air tight container. Then just scoop 1 of what ever size measure and use the same measure times 2 of the milk.  I heat in the microwave for a couple of minutes, whisk, then heat again another minute.  Sometimes I remember to add a splash of vanilla, but I like it even without.

I like the idea of this being quick and easy but I substituted the flour for cornstarch (and doubled it as recommended). The flour I think gave it an off taste. Next time I'll try it with cornstarch...otherwise I think this recipe could be really good.

I am very impressed with this recipe!  When I try to make recipes, they NEVER come out right.  This one did!  Yay!  I to added 2 TBSP of butter with the vanilla.  This was so yummy, I will likely make it again...but not eat so much at a time.  Chocolate overload!

Excellent and super easy!  I made mine in a sauce pan on the stove instead of the microwave.  Just continually wisk the mixture until it bubbles and is thick and shiny.  This is easily made fat free with splenda and skim milk.  This recipe will be a life-long favorite!

Pretty good, but less vanilla. It's quick and easy to make. It's a great treat on any occasion, and I probably will make it again. My pudding was a little lumpy and I followed the directions so if you're going to make it I recommend stirring it a lot when it comes out of the microwave.

Wow! I would have never believed that something this easy to make could be so delicious. The tablespoon of butter that several other reviewers mentioned does complete this wonderful recipie. Add a dollop of whipped cream and it's heaven on earth.

I have been actively trying to eliminate processed foods and "instant" stuff that has a lot of additives in them, unfortunately that usually means taking more time to cook!  THIS recipe is my answer to finding a VERY fast, delicious dessert.  Better than boxed and I defy anyone that says that the boxed version is quicker!  Try it, you won't be disappointed!

This did the trick for quick and easy, but it wasn't very rich even with 2% milk.

This is very good, but next time I wont use sugar substitute trying to save calories, cause it left an after taste in my opinion, I didnt like it, but the consistency and ease is great, so just cause I changed it I still think it could be great with sugar.

Awesome recipe!  I live in England where 'pudding' describes the whole of desserts and not just a creamy custard. I miss the delightfully creamy Jel-O chocolate pudding that I grew up with in the States and this recipe recreates that recipe extactly!!! Now I can make my favourite dessert from scratch!  I've made this often for my husband and I and on days when I want to whip up an extra fast dessert.  Excellent recipe!! I did have to adjust the time on my mircowave and keep an eye on the pudding basin as it cooked.  I have a 950 Watt microwave. but all in all it made me a mighty fine pudding!

I agree with other reviewers that this pudding is just as good if not better than boxed, but I will make a few changes next time I make this recipe. I plan on adding a few tablespoons more of sugar and only microwaving it for one minute after the initial three minutes.  It was a little too thick once chilled.

This is really tasty, super chocolately and so fast and easy.  It does taste a bit corn starchy, though, and maybe a little bit of butter might help it.  It is a pretty diet-friendly choco-fix too, especially if you substitute Splenda for the sugar, which makes no difference in the taste in my opinion! You can do a LOT of different with this recipe.

This is delicious!  My kids helped me make it, and we stirred in a big spoonful of peanut butter (maybe 1/4 cup)in the end.  Boy, that really made it good!  We also enjoyed in warm because we couldn't wait for it to cool down.  I used skim milk and it still came out thick and smooth.

although it was good it had that 'quick cooked' microwave taste to it. Over the stovetop is always more flavourful even if it might take 5 more min, it is well worth it. So i would opt to stovetop and not microwave this.

Worked really well with 1% milk! Tastes more chocolaty than boxed and I don't think it needs the butter, but a pinch of salt and cinnamon didn't hurt.

Pretty rich on the chocolate. I'd like it sweeter. Was surprised to see the pudding set up via microwave. It was so runny/liquidy after the first 2 1-minutes stirring rotations. But the 3rd minute is when it got thick for me. Cool! I only rate 3 *'s because the taste wasn't sweet enough.

I was really suprized at how easy this was! However, I thought it tasted a little weird. I think maybe it was the vanilla extract. I loaded it with a mountain of whipped cream and my family gobbled it up! I will make it again, using less vanilla to see if that was indeed the culprit.

It actually took a few more turns in the microwave than listed in the recipe, but the end result was worth it.  Almost as easy as pre-made mix, but you can customize it!  Mint and coconut are two of my favorite extras.

Heavenly days! This is sooooo good! So homemade, so easy, so quick! This is a great recipe if you're looking for something healthy to feed a sweet tooth. I used sugar, but will be trying it with Splenda next time round. 
I found that cooking it the full amount of time makes it very thick, which will be perfect poured into a prebaked shell with layers of ice cream, chocolate wafer crumbles, and chocolate syrup for husbands birthday in a few days! 
I liked this so much I printed it to add to my binder of faves! Thanks for sharing this gem!

I really love this recipe. I did decrease the cocoa just a bit, added 1T butter and a bit of salt as the others recommended. I used 1/2 of the milk as evaporated skimmed milk. And, second round, I doubled the recipe. Cook time increased a bit, but still worked out. Just a great pudding! Thanks!

I thought it'd taste better if it were creamier. Maybe I'll use half and half next time instead of milk.

good. I made it on the stove.  It still turned out pretty good, but the top of the pudding formed a skin.  This might be my fault since I've never have tried to make home made pudding before.  I will definitely try to make it again!  Good recipe.  Thanks!

THANK YOU!! I didn't know that making pudding is SO EASY! I've always made it from a box before, and I thought even that was a pain! But this was so easy and SO delicious! I'll definitely be adding things to this recipe to make lots of different kinds of pudding! (I'm thinking about berries, or maybe some orange extract and zest?)

As my daughter (jokenaround2) stated it was a great pudding.  I used 1/3c sugar, a tablespoon of instant expresso (with the cocoa) and fat-free half and half. Added the salt to the dry ingredients and sifted it all together before I added the liquids, no lumps.  I had some after it cooled and my husband ate the rest. WONDERFUL

This was okay but i have to admit that i prefer the cooked boxed kind. I think it may have too much cocoa powder for my taste. Hubby liked it more than me though.

This was exceptional! I found it last night & emailed to my mom...she made with sugar & fat free half & half.  I also made w/the fat free half & half but used 1/3 cup Splenda. We both LOVED our versions. Next time I'll do half sugar & half splenda. The fat free half & half was PERFECT. My 11 year old & I did it together. I'm so glad I found this, low fat & low/no sugar.  It is almost impossible to mess up if you truely follow the directions & use good ingredients.  Thank you for posting.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I thought it was too good to be true due to its simplicity, but it really is that easy to make a great homemade pudding. I used skim milk and Splenda and it still turned out wonderfully. My suggestion to others would be to wisk very thoroughly to avoid lumps, and keep an eye on it when microwaving- mine took an additional three minutes. Also, the pudding develops that "skin" rather quickly so cover immediately if not eating warm. Thanks a bunch for the recipe :D

Absolutely wonderful. I don't recall eating better chocolate pudding anywhere. I ate three bowls of it right after it was cold. I'm looking forward to making this for our next family dinner. Thanks for posting it.

I thought this was really good.  You must really like chocolate.  My husband and 4 year did not like it, too much chocolate-what are they thinking??  Which works well for me!  The more for me!

I love this recipe! I just found it today and have already made two batches. The first batch that I made was the chocolate, and I cooked it for one minute less than I should have, so it was a little runny. The flavor was excellent, so I was very impressed. The second time I was determined to get it right but decided to make a banana flavor. I omitted the cocoa powder and the vanilla and instead used 3 teaspoons of banana extract. Delicious! I have already added this to my recipe book, and it's so versitile that any flavor can be used. I love it!

Simply delicious and so easy to make!  I added a tablespoon of butter at the end like others have suggested.  I couldn't believe how fast it all came together.  It literally took less than 10 minutes to measure the ingredients and heat and stir (my batch required 5 minutes total microwave time).

So easy to make.  Definitely needs 1/4 tsp salt added with dry ingredients and 1 Tbsp butter added at the end with the vanilla, made a HUGE difference in flavor.  With those additions I would give it a 5 star.

This recipe was very good and so easy.  I added a little salt & butter with the vanilla at the end.  Then when it had cooled very slightly I stirred in choc chips and bananas.  If only I had some whipped cream to top it off with.....

so simple and delicious!  I hate serving my kids instant pudding due to the artificial flavors and colors, and now I can make quick and easy chocolate pudding for them with ingredients I always have on hand.  thanks!   update:  I made this today to satisfy a major chocolate craving and decided to freeze it...it was to die for!!!   I highly recommend trying it this way for a refreshing summer treat!  It reminded me of a frozen pudding bar... yum!!  I used half rice milk half skim milk and it turned out wonderful!

A delicious simple custardy pudding! Absolutely scrumptious! I am on a no sugar no flour diet, and I just put a little over 1/4 cup of sugar, which was plenty for me. Very fast and simple. I did not chill it, as I am impatient and was craving chocolate! I ate it hot and am not regretting it. Delicious!

Yup, this was fantastic, and totally hit the spot.  Even though I'm not a big fan of doing things in the microwave, the convenience and outcome were worth it on this one.

This was a winner!  I didn't believe it could be so easy and I was nervous about using the microwave but I guess pudding elves did their magic after the second additional minute and it turned out perfect.  It's not quite as creamy as traditional homemade egg-yolk recipes.  I would compare it to what you'd find in a snack pack.  Perfect for a chocolate craving and it satisfies the little ones who ask what's for dessert after every meal.

I love this recipe! I made this with my daughter and her friend, and they just loved it! We chopped up some fruit and nuts and then put it into the pudding after it was cooled. It was delicious! The only reason I give this 4 stars is because I found the flavor of the cocoa to be very strong. I'm not a big fan of cocoa.

Just adding my praise to the heaps this recipe has received. I have made it several times and it is a keeper. The boxed version tastes no better and costs more. Like other reviewers, I added a lump of butter and a bit of salt. I also cut the sugar a little.

Enjoyed this so much, I made two batches. Once cooled, I put the pudding in 1/2 cup plastic containers with lids which kept it so nice with no skin on the surface. Not only is this pudding quick and easy to make, it tastes much better than the store-bought stuff! Thank you for a great recipe.

This recipe is amazing! I can't believe I even wasted my time buying boxed pudding mix when this recipe was right here, all along. I used real Dutch chocolate and it came out excellent and very tasty! What an easy recipe for a delicious dessert made in no time! I shared this with my choco-holic sister and she was amazed at how good it was!

Amazingly easy and super yummy...I did add the salt and butter after tasting and it does improve it nicely.  Definitely a keeper, especially since I am trying to get away from buying prepared foods and miss the pudding in the box (not any longer though)!

The great thing about this pudding:  NO EGGS!!  I have made this pudding 4 times already, and what's even better is that my family loves it.  It is 100% better than the one in the box.  Thanks very much for a wonderful recipe!!!

I love it that this simple recipe has no eggs!  I hate accidentally scrambling the eggs when I make pudding.  Very nice flavor and very minimal work.  Mama would add a pat of butter at the end, so I did too.  Delish!

Very simple, very chocolatey!  I don't have a microwave, but this is also quick on the stovetop.  It tastes just like hot cocoa- the kids  loved it!  I've also made this with powdered milk, with the same tasty results.

Wow, this was great! I am actually eating it as I am typing, and I think it is absolutely fabulous! I omitted the vanilla and added about 1 Tbsp. of instant coffee powder, and about 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. I also used flour instead of cornstarch.
Amazing! I can't wait to make this into a mousse!

Excellent recipe!  I don't think I'll ever use packaged chocolate pudding again.  If my husband hadn't seen me microwaving it, he would have thought I spent a long time making his grandma's famous chocolate pudding recipe.  Great warm or cold!

Wow - The ones who didn't like this must have either had bad ingredients, followed the recipe wrong, or have never made homemade pudding before.  This is phenominal!  I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was perfect!

Tastes o.k., good for a quick chocolate fix but not very creamy or full-flavored. I won't be making this again.

My kids loved this, and I was so glad to give them something for desert that was not full of processed junk.  Thank you for this recipe!

I couldn't believe how quick and easy this recipe was. My husband wanted a snack, but I just ran out of eggs. I thought pudding would be good, but most called for yolks. So, I stumbled across this one and thought, 'what the heck'.  It tastes just like pudding cups, but without all of the ingredients you can't pronounce. It came out really shiny, smooth and thick, despite my low powered microwave. I tasted it right away without the vanilla and yum! When I added the vanilla, it was ok, but I didn't like it as much. Next time, I'll make it with 1/2 tsp vanilla.

Great recipe. This was my very first time making pudding from scratch and it came out wonderfully. Fast, Easy, and delicious. I have a feeling this is going to become one of my "regulars".

I love chocolate and I tried this pudding for Valentine's Day Parfaits.  It was yummy, but not quite the chocolate I was looking for.  Amazingly though, I adore this pudding without the chocolate!  The vanilla is so tasty, especially with a little salt mixed in.  Try this recipe both ways--so fun!

I felt good about making this...have you read what's in boxed pudding???  But, the taste & texture to me was only so, so.  It was quick & easy though.  I might make again if I'm in a pinch.

YUM! I have a major league dairy allergy, so I tried this using Silk Plus soy milk (the best they've come out with so far IMO) and otherwise followed the recipe as given. I'm sitting here licking the bowl and very happy! It took a while (my microwave is an underpowered POS) but when it finally thickened up it was close to what I remember from childhood. Next time I may add a little extra chocolate, or variations (like brown sugar and no chocolate for a butterscotchy type), but this filled my long-denied chocolate pudding craving very nicely! Thanks!!!

Wow! I have always preferred cooked pudding over instant, but just hate the constant stirring over the flame and scorching of the milk. This recipe is the solution! Cooked pudding without the lumps and scorched pan. This stuff is the best, and even makes great vanilla pudding. I can't wait to try it out with other flavors and recipes.

This was an easy recipe, but tasted bland and was very globby (for lack of a better word).  The consistancy was just terrible and the taste was not what I was expecting.

I made this for my family, and they loved it. I think I'll add less cocoa powder next time though, because it was extremely chocolately. Still very tasty (and the texture was just right), but would be tastier with a little less chocolate.

This is a really EASY basic cornstarch pudding (let alone yummy!).  I never make stovetop because, frankly, I hate to stand and stir something over the stove.  My 6-year-old though it was fun to make, and the family ate it all before it even got a chance to cool!

After trying out the 'Thick Chocolate Pudding" recipe with modifications, I was happy to find another recipe with the correct porportion of ingredients written down. Great texture and appearence (shinyyyy xD), smells nice (mm chocolate...), and importantly, not too sweet. Great recipe!

I made this recipe the other night when I was looking for a quick dessert.  After reading some other reviews, I agree that it tasted bitter.  It was also kind of grainy feeling in the mouth.  It looked palatable but I wasn't a fan nor was my husband, who loves chocolate pudding.  I did eat some on bananas and it was ok, but not worth the extra calories to me.    I threw the rest out so the in laws wouldn't get their hands on it and lose faith in my cooking skills :)  
I wouldn't make this recipe again.

I've been making this for years!  The only thing is that I never chill it.  It's thick enough for me straight out of the microwave.  Warm chocolate pudding is the best thing to have on a cold winter's day!

This surprised me with how EASY and YUMMY it was.  I ended up cooking it for a minute too long, so once I cooled it it was very thick.  This was easily solved by adding some half and half to reach the right consistency.  Then I took about 1/3 of it and mixed it with some Cool Whip, and layered it into a sinfully delish pudding parfait.  I started with the full chocolate pudding, then the cool whip mixture, then more chocolate pudding, then topped it with Cool Whip.  Wow.  Not only was it soooo yummy, it was really pretty too.

ever so simple, ever so tasty! Highly recommended, no problems making it, you can add a little more chocolate, or a little less, throw in more or less vanilla, it always turns out.

Best quick pudding recipe. Had a hankering for a minty flavor, threw in some peppermint and it was nice, chocolate hits the palate first, then you get that little minty exhale after you swallow the bite. Just a dandy!

this was very easy. i used to make pudding stove top and i had to mix a lot, but this recipe made everything so easy and quick.. mine turned out bitter that's my fault because i used 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder opposed to 1/3. anyway, i was able to rescue the recipe. i mixed a couple of tsps of confectioners sugar. i also mixed 1T vanilla with 1/2T raspberry syrup that i had lying around for a slightly berry taste. it's really good.

This is soooo rich and so easy. Definitely will use as my default recipe. Loved that it only took one dish. I think I cooked it for a minute too long, which made it not as creamy of a texture, but that was my fault!

Yea!! This was awesome!! I added a bit of butter...but all in all I was shocked at the taste and consistancy. I am used to making my grandmother's recipe which has egg yolks and scalded milk...I can't believe how much it tasted like her recipe(which is mouthwatering)yet so much easier that I dont mind fixing! No more boxed pudding for us!
Thanks!

It is a little bit sweet for my taste, but that was easily fixed by cutting back on the sugar. Otherwise, it's delicious and the perfect quick chocolate fix.

I doubled this and it turned out great - it took only a few minutes in my microwave - it is a newer model and things seem to cook more quickly.  I did reduce the sugar by about one third to suit my husbands tastes.  Overall, a great and yummy pudding that could not be quicker or simpler to make.  Be sure to follow the directions about whisking the ingredients.

The flavour is nice, but it's way too sweet for me. Perhaps it would be alright with half that amount of sugar. Even my sugar babies (kids) only ate a small amount as it was too sweet even for them.

I've made this 3 times.  Two of the Three times it turned out great!  The second time I made it I tried doubling it and it turned into a mess.  This is a great alternative to expensive store bought instant/cook mixes!  Plus, it is really very simple and satisfying!  The third time I left out the vanilla and the kids still gobbled it up.  Definite keeper...

This is this first pudding I have ever eaten and made. I was unsure/didn't get how long to cook it and it ended up w/ little lumps.  So I'm thinking I cooked it too long or didn't stir it enough?  My boyfreind LOVED it and and said all pudding had lumps. Oh I added butter, more vanilla, and muddled some of the sugar with fresh mint. Good quick chocolate snack. Be sure to cover it really good or it gets a weird skin on top.

Hey, not bad!  I don't think I would say its better than the boxed kind but its definitely in second place!  Certainly cheaper and actually takes less time.  Tastes great warm or chilled and topped with whipped cream!

I was craving a sweet chocolate treat when I came upon this recipe. It was so easy to make and deliciously thick. I used all purpose flour in place of cornstarch like someone else suggested and it worked great. I lost half of my pudding in the microwave because I used too small of a bowl. Great quick recipe.

This was so good thank you! I used half brown sugar and added a tablespoon of butter and it came out great! Perfect for the chocolate cravings!
