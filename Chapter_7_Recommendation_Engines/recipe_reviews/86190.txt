This was hotter than we like but very good.  The meat was grilled perfectly and we liked the grilled plums....they helped cut the heat!  Would leave out some of the peppers if I make it again.

I originally saw this in the paper and decided to make it that weekend. I cut way back on the oil to keep it lower fat. I goofed on the ingredients and used orange juice instead of concentrate, so I also replaced the water with orange juice. We like things spicy, so I add more chipotle peppers. The family won't eat the plums or the almonds, so I just leave those out. I often leave this to marinate for 24 hours or more and sometimes add a bit of soy sauce to the leftover dressing and reduce it. Fantastic recipe, I highly recommend this one.

I used the recipe to make tacos using corn torltilla's.  They were delicious! My whole family went nuts over it as we served a total of 35 tacos.

I didn't turn this into a salad, but just used the recipe for the marinated grilled pork and plums.  It turned out great, and the leftovers were excellent in a flour tortilla with some sliced avocado and sour cream!

The marinade was delicious - I could see using it for chicken or shrimp as well. I used pineapple juice concentrate instead of OJ and it was great. I also enjoyed the cabbage as an interesting alternative to other greens or rice.

I thought the pork was perfectly seasoned, a nice mix of sweet and spicy.  I would have like the plums to be a more dominant flavor, like in a plum sauce.  I was expecting the flavor to be sweeter to cut the spice, but it wasn't enough.  The flavor combo was good, though.  If I make it again, I will use plum jam or plum sauce.

I had high hopes for this dinner.  The marinade was great, but it fell flat with the other ingredients.  For us, the salad was just lacking in flavor.  Thought the addition of some green onions and maybe diced tomato would help.  We did enjoy the taste of the marinade and then the marinade turned dressing.  The plums were very good on the grill and didn't get mushy in the six minute grill time.  We used a gas grill rather than a charcoal grill.  I served this over Napa cabbage as the recipe states, but wonder if it would have been more pleasing to use the baby greens as submitter suggests as an alternative.  We had 'Everything Bagel Cauliflower Rolls' from Pinterest with the salad.
