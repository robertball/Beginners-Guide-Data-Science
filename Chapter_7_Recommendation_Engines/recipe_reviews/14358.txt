Very easy to make, but the oregano and seasoning is too overpowering, I suggest using a lot less.

This is a great salad with any meal.  I have used it with Italian meals and with more home-style meals, and it worked well with both.

I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS AT ALL...I WOULD RATHER HAVE A SALAD WITHOUT THE SEASONING. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT THREE STARS IS BECAUSE MY HUSBAND THOUGHT IT WAS OKAY.

I liked this. I didn't have a block of cheese, so I used shredded cheese and I used English cucumber so I didn't have to peel and seed it. I liked the addition of oregano and poultry seasoning. I used mixed baby greens instead of romaine

This was ok, good for something different, but not something I would make again.

My husband went for seconds but I did not like the taste of the celery, maybe it's because I used Italian dressing instead of Ranch.
