This was a great and versatile dish!  We don't really eat meat so we ate it as a main course.  Since we were doing that, I added more peppers than the recipe called for as well as some mushrooms.  I've never toasted quinoa like this before and I really think it helped bring out the nutty flavor of it - I will definitely use this technique for quinoa in the future!  I liken this dish to a stir fry in my cooking library because it's great to use up leftover veggies you might have in the fridge.  I will definitely be trying it with broccoli and other vegetables that I often have.  This was a great weeknight meal and the leftovers (there weren't many) are going to be great for lunch.  I'd also like to put this filling in a tortilla, freeze, and give to my landscaper husband for a tasty lunch.  You can also add shrimp or chicken if you'd like.  Big fan of this recipe - will make again for sure!

Followed recipe exactly.  It was okay.  I added some cheese and it was better.

This was really easy and really good!  I changed it a little by adding a bunch  of chopped fresh green beans that I added at the same time as the peppers.  I also used like 8 of the mini peppers, yellow, red and orange.  There's no photo  because we ate it all!  I will definitely make this again.

Pretty darn good.  I was wondering what to do with the bell peppers about to go bad and I had nearly everything on hand, well no chicken broth.  However, I used 2 chicken bullion cubes and dissolved in 2 cups water then poured in, probably would have been better with real broth. 

I did not have parsley, but used cilantro and think it did a better job than what the parsley could have done.  Paired with baked lemon tilpa and made it into a bowl. 

I will make again, I felt so healthy!

Easy, quick and delicious. I added soffritto instead of shallot and used tri-color quinoa. Beautiful!

This is my first time making Quinoa with Swanson Broth and I won't make it any other way from now on! Veggie broth added so much flavor to the Quinoa and the peppers and garlic are perfect with it!

This turned out to be a great side dish for us! I used Swanson chicken broth instead of vegetable. I also replaced the yellow pepper with green and added salt and pepper to taste. This would go really well with chicken or fish. I will make this again for sure!
