These were tasty but too many unnecessary steps. Hence the 4 star rating. I did not leave the rolls connected but separated them. I placed 1 folded slice of ham and 1 oz cheese on each bottom then placed top half and poured butter mixture over top. No need to spread butter mixture with a spatula. I don't see the point of having them sit for 5-10 minutes before baking. Nor did I cover them with foil while baking. Baked for 17 minutes , uncovered and they baked perfectly.

I didn't put the poppy seed and made with fresh onion in the sauce.  I served these with some zuppa Toscana soup.  Yummy

WOW... these are seriously good!!   Made as written but double ham, double cheese and double dried onion (they put this over the top).  Ate 3 for a tasty and delicious (and easy) lunch.  Will absolutely make again.

I used  land o lake garlic and herb spread for time saver and spread a little on the bread before I placed the ham & cheese on it. I also did some with turkey. They were very tasty and easily prepared the night before .  Highly recommend this recipe for office party (as long as you have access to an oven to bake when ready to serve)

These had good flavor but I found the bottoms of the buns to be soggy
