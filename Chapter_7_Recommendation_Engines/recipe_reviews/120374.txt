These are soooo good! I can't stress how good they are enough. Easy and delicious. One thing that the recipe doesn't say that it should is that you should bake the cookies until they form the cracks at the top (like a classic gingersnap). I had trouble determining when they were ready, and I found that they were perfect when those cracks formed (also more visually appealing).

I love that these are so soft and chewy.  They are great.  I ended up chilling the dough overnight and then rolled them into the balls.  Having the dough very cold helped them from sticking on my hands too bad.

AWESOME cookies!  I made them for my corridor mates while in Sweden, and every nationality here approved. If you want softer cookies, make larger balls and bake for a shorter time.  For crispier cookies, make the balls of dough smaller and bake them for a longer time.

These cookies are the best!  This recipe has even replaced my great-grandma Bessie's gingersnap recipe.  I know, it's horrible.  But these cookies are so soft and chewy and have the perfect amount of sweetness and spice.  I made a double batch and two days later, they were gone.  Try this recipe, you will LOVE it!!!

As far as gingersnaps go, I could not have asked for a better cookie. My boyfriend and I prefer more spice than most, so I doubled all the spices. I also baked them in a well-greased muffin pan (I like a thicker cookie, and having them all the same size is nice, too!). They were absolutely delicious, and stayed chewy for days. Will continue to use this recipe for years to come.

Delicious! I especially appreciated this recipe because it was the only soft gingersnap recipe I found using butter rather than shortening. They are very mild, chewy and addictive! I plan to make these cookies part of my Christmas baking every year.

These were wonderful, easy, and made a TON!  The molasses in them was so wonderful.  I tried rolling the balls in red and green sprinkles for Christmas, and they were very pretty!  It took a lot more colored sugar than regular sugar for some reason, so if you don't have a ton of the colored sugar, you may not want to use it.  Thanks so much for the recipe - this is a keeper for Christmas!

Sooooooo soft and chewy! Loved it, although, I think I will use just a little bit less salt next time. I wrapped them in cellophane and gave them as office gifts.

I made these cookies as part of my baking for the holidays and OMG! Sooooo good! I prepared them exactly how the recipe said. I wouldn't change a thing. Just make sure you get them out of the oven in time so they are SOFT! Sooo yummy! A big hit!

I followed the recipe exactly.  The cookies looked beautiful and came out soft as promised.  However, 3 teaspoons of baking soda is WAY too much!  The taste of baking soda was disappointingly the strongest taste to the cookies.  However, my husband didn't really notice it and liked the cookies.

An awesome cookie! I was hesitant to make gingersnaps at first and so glad I went with this recipe. I just made these and I can't believe how delicious they turned out. Slightly crispy around the edges and soft and chewy in the center. I rolled them in red sugar and then flattened with my thumb before baking and they were perfect! Yummy!!

I made two batches of these for my dad since he loves gingersnaps. I ended up eyeballing the spices and ended up with roughly 3x the amount needed but he loved them anyway. They definitely packed a lot of flavor, were soft and perfectly cracked, and were gone within 3 days! I make these a couple times a month now for him - two thumbs up!

So good! I never really liked gingersnaps that much, so I thought making these would be a good way to keep hand out of the cookie jar! No such luck!

These were delicious, easy (very!) and made a ton, which was great for Christmas gifting. I dipped the tops in silver, gold, red, and green colored sugar before baking. Bonus? The house smelled wonderful as they baked!

I find most gingersnaps to "wimpy". The spice taste was excellent in these, although one person I served them to thought they were "too spicy". Most loved them though. Mine didn't show the crackle texture very well but the cookies were delicious.

These cookies are good if they really flat and crispy, other than that they're fair. I rounded them into balls then flattened them with a fork, and cooked them for 14 minutes. I don't think I'm going to make these again.

These are so good.  I was looking for a soft ginger molasses cookie like I can get at the coffee shop.  These are it!  I added some freshly minced ginger and it made them even better!

This is the first time i've ever made ginger snaps and they turned out perfect and chewy. Didn't have crushed cloves, so i just put a little more cinnamon in-still tasty! Refrigerating the dough helped to form the dough into balls much easier. I also recommend watching them and removing them RIGHT after the top begins to crack. Remove them and let them "deflate" and cool for a few min before putting them on a cooling rack. I'm making these again this weekend!

Soft yummy.  I like them with a little more ginger (like 2-2 1/2 tsp.) or they would be 5 stars.

Made these at Christmas and they might've been my favorite item! So good, even after omitting the cloves and i think the nutmeg. Veeeerrrry chewy and lasted a couple weeks with great texture!

Loved these cookies. Great flavor and texture, very yummy. I baked for just 10 minutes in my oven, came out perfect. Had a hard time not "testing" them all away.

Wonderful recipe!! These cookies are chewy on the outside- and even more chewy on the inside! The only change i made was adding no clove and a bit less of nutmeg. Will make these cookies every year now!

Mine didn't turn out particularly soft after they cooled.  They were rather crunchy actually.   But they did have an addictive taste.

I am going to make this cookies with my granddaughter this weekend, and for any one using butter with salt you don't need to add salt to this recipe or any other recipe. Because if the butter has salt in it, then you are adding to much salt to any recipe. hope this helps someone .

These are THE BEST Gingersnaps I have EVER made!!! Absolutely perfect. I rolled each ball of dough in sugar before placing on the pan, and then flattened the tops just slightly with my finger tips. Got RAVE reviews from my family. Thank you for this AMAZING recipe!!!!

I've been making these cookies for almost a year and - as is - I give the recipe 4 stars. The cookies are excellent, but another review was right: they were missing that "snap" for me. I love spicier cookies and I tripled the nutmeg, cloves, ginger, and use a little more than 3 tsps of ginger with a little more than 1/2 cup molasses... they're AMAZING now. Even my younger sister (who despises gingersnaps) raves about these; I just sent her three dozen at college and her friends are literally fighting over them. My office loves them, my church loves them, and my family threatens me to send them some in the mail, lol. 14 minutes was perfect in my electric oven and I do roll my balls a little bigger so I don't get the full 66 servings.  I told one of the girls in my office that I use cloves in the cookies. She told her mom the same thing and the next morning her mom woke up talking 'bout, "The cloves helped my glaucoma!" Hilarious!!!  Thanks for this recipe. And although the recipes says no substitutes for the butter, I made a vegan batch for my neighbors with Egg-N-Replacer and vegan butter spread and they turned out really great also (I ate one first to make sure I wasn't taking them something that would kill them). :)

Perfect Recipe. Made it exactly as suggested.  Per other reviewer baked until small cracks formed on top of cookie which was 9 min for my oven.  Nice soft and chewy cookie.
Thanks for sharing!!!!

Okay, honestly these cookies turned out beautifully, but I was expecting a more spicey cookie like Trader Joes, or the kind that burn the corners of your mouth after eating a few.  More spice would make a more likable gingersnap.  BTW, after I made this very large batch, it turns out my teen boys and husband don't care for them...=(  Guess, I will give them away.

This is the same recipe Pillsbury uses. Its the best. I sometimes use Crisco instead of butter and i sometimes stir in 1 1/2 cups white chocolate chips (see my photo.)   Make sure you only bake these 8 minutes if u want them to be soft

I used 1 - 2 tablespoons of ginger and left out the cloves.  Delicious cookies, just like my mom used to make.  Mine didn't stay soft but that's okay.  Thanks for the recipe.

I LOVE these cookies! The flavor has a perfect balance of sweetness and spice, and the chewiness makes them even better than the traditional hard snaps. I baked the batch on two different pans, and the ones that I baked on an insulated pan came out the "prettiest" (well, "puffiest"). :-)  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made these for Christmas, keeping the cookie size small and got more than enough out of the batch.  Used pumpkin pie spice that I had on hand instead of going out to get ginger, nutmeg etc.  They were yummy!

These soft gingersnaps are very quick and easy to make - they have gotten rave reviews from everyone I've given them to.  Around Christmastime, my husband requests them almost weekly.  They bake up soft and chewy and have just the right amount of spiciness.  Delicious!

Fantastic.  Soft and chewy, great taste.  Several people have commented how great they were.  The ginger flavor is mild, making it great for most people.  Not what you're looking for if you like a really sharp ginger flavor.  I'll definitely be making them again.

These most def. need more ginger.  I even added a little more, but it still was not enough.  I will try again and add maybe 2 tsp or more.  Made lots of cookies!

These were amazing! Cut the recipe in half, cause it makes ALOT of cookies. Used half the batter for cookies immediately, they came out soft & delicious, as advetised. 
Kept the other half batter in frig overnight, baked the next day. That batch came out a more typical 'snap' ginger snap. 
Recommend this recipe to all bakers!

I'm not a big ginger cookie fan but these were exceptionally good!  The cookies were crispy outside and slightly chewy in the middle with a mild ginger/molasses flavor.   I rolled the dough in red colored sugar (1 cup sugar + red food color to your liking) and it gave it a more festive look.  A very nice cookie to add to my Christmas cookie tray!

I'm giving this 4 stars because they were delicious when baked immediately after the dough was made, but I froze half the batter and those turned out tough and bland.  I've never had a dough do that after freezing before.  If you bake these immediately they are wonderful!  Soft, chewy, and great flavor!  Thanks for posting the recipe.

Delicious and soft cookies! Made a double batch for Christmas! I decreased the baking time to 6 minutes because I made smaller cookies! This will become a regular in my Christmas cookie rotation!

This is a wonderful recipe. I served it at a youth function and the platter was gone! I followed the recipe exactly and had wonderful results. I baked on a stoneware and a regular cookie pan and both we excellent. If you are looking a spicy(ish) cookie with great holiday flavors, this is it!!

These are the best gingersnaps ever!  I love the soft texture.  We brought them with us on our cruise because ginger is supposed to ease sea-sickness.  These definitely did soothe our bellies when we were a little sea sick.  They don't travel well, however, and we ended up with crumbs rather than cookies when we carried them in our carry-on bags.  (My bad...)   I'm not complaining, though.  Our whole family loved everything about these cookies!

I didn't know these were this easy. Mine looked more like pic 1 of 12 and not like the pic shown on the recipe profile. Keep the dough balls 2" apart or they will bake together.

I love chewy cookies so I wanted to try these soft gingersnaps.  They were perfect! Soft and so tasty. Compliments and praise from everyone whose tried them.  It's the first time I've made gingersnaps and I'm working on my third batch.

I loved this recipe. Extremely easy.  I exchanged 3 tsp fresh grated ginger (compressed to about 2 in the spoon) which gave the cookies that crisp flavor only fresh ginger can and complimented the robust blackstrap molasses so well.  This recipe has gone into my winter cookie list.

I have to admit Gingersnaps have never been my favorite, however these are out of this world, soft, chewy, just the right amount of molasses flavor.  I think these will go fast! I made it exactly as written. I wouldn't change a thing!!

WARNING!  These things are AMAZING!  I just made them today and I can not stop eating them.  I couldn't stop eating the dough and now I can not stop eating them. I hate to say I won't be able to make them very much or I'll explode.  I also used red and green sugar as well as the white.  It makes them look really festive on the plate.

Great flavor, great texture!  I undercooked my first batch because I was being paranoid.  Let them cook until large cracks form, but they're still puffed.  Ten minutes was perfect for my oven.

An excellent cookie but it's missing the "snap".  For those of us who enjoy a bit more "bite" in our gingersnap, you need to triple the amount of ginger called for. For such a large recipe, I think you could easily add 4 tsp of ginger and probably increase the other spices too.  I even added ginger to the sugar that I rolled the dough in.  Nice texture.     They make good ice cream sandwiches.  We used lime frozen yogurt.

These cookies were great; reminded me of the cookies my mom used to make when I was a child. I ended up with 96 cookies from this recipe and they were a huge hit at a bake sale.

So delicious!  The traditional flavor of gingersnaps but a soft chewy version.  I plan to make these for an upcoming cookie exchange.  Definitely give these a try.

These were excellent. I was out of white sugar, so I substituted brown (1 for 1) and they turned out fantastic!

Delicious gingersnap recipe that's easy to make! It definitely makes a lot more than 66 though...more like 100!The dough can also stay in the fridge for days.

Delicious! My two year old loved them. I didn't have molasses, so I did 1/4  cup Brown sugar and 1/4 cup agave syrup (I added a little more agave when I beat in the dry ingredients just to give it a little more moisture) and they turned out great!

These cookies are delicious!!! I am throwing away my grandma's recipe and replacing with this one. My son-in-law took a couple dozen to work and said they were gone in no time, and they all asked for more. He's military so I did a good deed for my country and made them another batch.

Recipe makes a LOT of cookies! That's OK, because they are very good.  My hubby always bought gingersnaps - don't think he'll want to buy them again!!  Takes a while to roll into balls and roll in sugar, but worth it!

I was hesitant at first, new recipe and all, but boy I am glad I made them, they are fabulous, sooooo soft and chewy and I like the large amount because they will not last long in my house. These are cetainly going in my "BEST EVER" file. Followed instructions to see the cracks on top before I took them out of the oven after exactly 12 minutes.
Thanks for a great recipe

Excellent!! Except a little bit too sweet for my taste, and I already have a sweet tooth. Will reduce sugar next time, mostly because everyone around me are not big sugar fans, but there will definitely be many more "next times". Thanks for the recipe - it´s definitely going in my collection.

Followed the directions exactly!  As soon as the cookies "crack" when baking, take them out of the oven so they are chewy.  Excellent!

Fantastic!! Absolutely delicious.  Really - can't say it enough.  Look fantastic, taste better.  I used margarine instead of butter and the results were great.  Make as per directions, no fail recipe:).

these are easy and fool proof. I have made many ginger/molasses cookies in my day but these are the best! Wouldn't change a single thing in the recipe. One hint for perfect cookies: always use parchment paper and they wont stick or burn. No need for special cookie sheets, old ones work fine with parchment.

The only change I made to the recipe was I used Fleischmann's Unsalted Butter because it is dairy free and my kids can't have dairy.  I also added a little bit more salt due to the lack of salt in the butter.  I made 144 servings of these cookies and they came out perfectly.  I find that sometimes when you double a recipe you have to more than double the spices -  not this recipe - they were perfect!

Hands down my favorite cookie!  Perfect for the holidays.  We make them into 1/2 inch balls - they're the perfect bit-size portion.  Even my father-in-law who doesn't like sweets couldn't get enough of these cookies.  This recipe is a keeper!

This is the 3rd Christmas I have been making these cookies and we LOVE them!  This is by far the best gingerbread cookie recipe I have ever made, and a family favorite!  I just recently found out I have a gluten intolerance so I made these cookies using Namaste gluten free perfect flour blend and they came out perfect!  My family did not notice a difference.

These cookies are delicious and very easy to make. I baked the first batch for 11 minutes, the cookies were good but the were not soft, so for the subsequent batches I baked them for 8 minutes and the turned soft and chewy. This cookies were a big hit at Christmas parties and I will definitely make them again.

Warning: This makes a HUGE BATCH, but they are yummy, so don't worry about eating them all.  Everyone raved about them. They were perfect for cookie-giving. Very fluffy and pretty sweet in flavor but very good!

Delicious cookie recipe! The only thing I added was a teaspoon of vanilla for good measure ;) I let the dough chill outside while making some other cookies and having chilled dough was easier to work with. Also, I made one batch of smaller balls and they were cooked on a darker cookie sheet. They came out crispy but still tasted good. We ended up putting some cream cheese frosting between 2 of them and making a little cookie sandwich.

Perfect cookie when baked 10 minutes.  They are a little crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I did not change up the recipe and love the results.

you can't get much easier or delicious than this!    I baked mine for the full 12 minutes and they are still soft on the inside with a little crip around the edges.  I took another reviewers advice and waited till there were cracks on top to pull them out of the oven.This is a really wonderful holiday cookie to bring to parties or to have on hand for guests.  YUM

Amazing!!! I had never made gingersnaps before and didn't know what to expect. But, these were wonderful. Followed the recipe exactly as shown (I did let the dough sit overnight in the fridge though....just didn't have the time to do it all in one day). Took them to work and to a Halloween party...everyone absolutely loved them! Will be making these again.

I loved the texture, but these cookies are REALLY spicy. My husband, who loves spicy things thought they were great. I might cut back on the ginger and cloves just a touch next time.

My new favorite gingersnap recipe.  If you like your gingersnaps soft, this is your recipe.  My husband loves the flavor of gingersnaps but didn't like the thin crispy ones.  The whole family devoured these.

Excellent!  Even my dad, who doesn't like gingersnaps, ate 4 of them.  I will definitely be making these for the holidays!  They smell amazing while baking.  11 minutes was perfect for me.

OMG! These cookies are amazing. I sent a batch to my Sister-in-Law in VA. and since then any conversation I have with her is the following "were's the gingersnaps, can't talk until I get the snaps"! No more store bought ginger snaps for me or her! This is the best cookie-very soft and very flavorful. I didn't change a thing except double the batter. Thanks so much for the best cookie ever! If I could give a 10 star rating-this ginger snap would get it. So easy to make too!

Guys, it's all true. These are PERFECTION. If you like gingersnap cookies, you've found your recipe. I changed nothing, just cut the recipe in half to make a smaller batch for the beau and I. I made larger balls (1 1/2") and cooked them only 9 minutes. Chewy and soft on the inside. Crunchy on the outside. Sublime!!! Thanks for posting....

I am not a big fan of gingersnaps but I decided to give these a try. I followed the recipe exactly as written and they came out perfectly. I could NOT stop eating these. I had a dinner party and brought these out with the desserts and my guests raved about them. These are definitely going to be part of my Christmas cookie baking from now on. I'm a fan!

Followed the recipe exactly.  These are great!  Soft and chewy, but the sugar on the outside gives them a little bit of crunch. Great flavor, too.  My grocery had MANY choices for molasses.  Who knew??  I chose the "mild" version and it seems just right.   Also, the recipe makes lots and LOTS of cookies.  I accidentally burned a dozen and still have WAY more than I know what to do with!

This is such a delicious recipe! I've always loved the taste of gingerbread but didn't like hard cookies. Theses stay so chewy and they have the prefect mix of sweetness with spice! And like others have said, you know they are done when the cracks appear! Will definitely be making these lots!

Molasses are hard to get where I live, so I replaced them with maple syrup. My mum took them to the office, and her colleagues loved it. I will definitely make these again using molasses (if I can get some), and compare the difference.

I made the recipie as is, and it is wonderful! I think next time I may increase the spices for me personally because I like a really spicy cookie, but everyone else though the balance is wonderful. When I made the cookies, I freaked out a little because there were SO MANY COOOKIES, but now it's not an issue; they are almost gone! They are very, very, very addicting. This will definietely be one of our new Christmas recipies for each holiday. Love them!

This recipe is fantastic!  With one batch, I tried waiting for the cookies to "crack" on top before removing from the oven as one reviewer suggested - however, these cookies didn't turn out soft and were a bit burnt on the bottom.  They do need to be puffy when you take them out.  If you over bake them they won't be soft!  I also found that my aluminum sheet baked them slower than my teflon coated cookie sheet, so don't forget to take this into consideration when baking!

I was looking for a recipe for gingersnaps that weren't so snappy; I like them chewy, with a little give, but not cakey in the least. This recipe is perfect for that! I will make these a lot; the texture is exactly what I wanted, the flavor is excellent, and they look so pretty and perfect out of the oven. They would be great vehicles for ice cream sandwiches; I think good old vanilla bean ice cream would be good, but my girlfriend says coffee would be better.

I made these last night and they were a huge hit with my family and at the office.  The recipe made a ton of cookies...perfect for those who like to freeze a couple of dozen for a later date.  I found them to have the perfect blend of sweetness and spice with a great chewy texture.

These are wonderful cookies...no modifications needed! I've been bringing these to the family thanksgiving/christmas get-togethers for a few years, and this year I brought other things for the christmas get-together. One of my husband's uncles was very disappointed that I didn't bring these cookies! FYI: If you're making a double-batch, they will require more time in the fridge to firm up.

On a budget, I made these last year for xmas gifts. Many people also brought cookies to the family party, but I heard days later that my cookies blew the competition away, and these were definitely the star of the show. They are "melt in your mouth" delicious, and they truly do melt in your mouth. They came out beautifully and I would not change a bit of the recipe. I decided to comment and rate because here I am a year later searching for this fabulous recipe. If you like ginger snaps or ginger bread, these cookies are for you!

AWESOME!!  Thank you for the great recipe.  I was getting bummed making my Christmas cookies today because they weren't turning out at all.  So, I decided to try a new recipe, and I found this.  I didn't change a thing, and they turned out perfect.  I don't usually like ginger snaps, but these are really good.  My husband loved them as well.  Thank you!!

Fabulous!!! As other reviewers suggested, keep the cookies in the oven until deep cracks form.  I didn't on a few batches and found them still to be gooey on the inside although they looked done.  I didn't have of the cookie in a glaze and sprinkled them with red and green sanding sugar.  Very pretty!!!

beautiful x-mas cookies, perfect for an assortment platter.  i made these with my 10 and 11 year old daughters.  they loved forming the balls and rolling them in different colored sugars to see which ones would be pretty.  the taste is spicy and not overly sweet.  crisp on the outside and soft inside.  i followed the recipe exactly.  will make these every year from now on!

This is a phenomenal cookie! Warm and homey, soft and chewy. This is a great flavor and texture! A hit with everyone I shared them with! I made a full batch, but, didn't make them all at once. I sealed the bowl in the fridge and make some every night... I think it is 'safer' That way; otherwise we would eat the whole batch at once! I would go so far as to say that is is a great 'comfort food' dessert!

Made these with a stand mixer, the dough is very thick.  Very good cookies, but I upped the ginger amount and cut out 1/2 cup of sugar.  Way too sweet for my family (especially with the molasses already being sweet!), but we eat healthy so the sugar content was just a little overwhelming.  Otherwise great recipe, everyone loves it!

GREAT cookies!! Soft and chewy with just the right amount of spices! Be warned though, the dough is  VERY thick- I used my standing mixer for this one and wouldn't attempt it otherwise. Fantastic cookies!!!

My daughter and I made these last night.  At least a dozen are gone already!  They are deliciously moist, very flavorful, and I loved them right out of the oven.  I will definitely make these again!

These have consistently been the best cookies every time. A favorite at every event. It's worth a bit of extra trouble to grate fresh nutmeg.

I love ginger and I love gingersnap cookies.  But these were a little bit too heavy on the other spices besides ginger.  I can't really taste any ginger at all.  I'll have to go back to making the fresh ginger cookies.  I thought this would be an easy alternative when I don't have fresh ginger in the house, but I think I'll pass next time.

These are heavenly.  The only changes I made were to substitute whole wheat pastry flour for 1 cup of all purpose flour, and I added 1 teaspoon allspice (in addition to all the other spices).  I do wish *some* of the butter could be  omitted or substituted but I'll take them like they are.:)

These were sooo easy to make and delicious! I used margarine instead of butter and had no problems. You can make them bigger or smaller than the recipe calls for and they still turn out delicious.

Great Recipe Shawn!!!!!  Easiest for me to refrig overnite and alternate 2 cookie sheets so the dough doesn't get too warm before you are done.  Did another batch and tried to be a bit healthier and they turned out great too!  Used 1 c. butter and /2 c. butter buds (1 packet with 1/2 c. water), 3 c. white flour and 1-1/2 c. wheat flour, and 1 c. sugar and 1 c. stevia in the raw - love the richness of this recipe - thanks!!

AMAZING! If I could rate it higher than 5 stars, I would! This will be the only gingersnap recipe I use from now on. So soft and chewy...didn't change a thing with the recipe except that I left the dough in the fridge overnight because I didn't have time to finish making them in one night. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

These were awesome cookies! Followed the recipe through, but the only thing I did different was not add the entire amount of mollasses. Not because I wanted to, but I had only about 1/2-3/4 of a cup left. They still turned out great though! Thank you!

These were awesome and a true crowd pleaser.  I added a bit more molasses than the recipe called for because I wanted to make sure that they were sweet enough.  I would recommend these for any gathering.

Great cookies! Just watch out, this recipe makes a lot of cookies! You also have to watch because they can burn real easily so take them out when they start to crack.

Absolutely yummy!  Didn't change a thing. BUT I didn't get the 66 servings as indicated in the recipe. Made 8 batches and gave them away for Christmas present. Friends loved them! Friends and friends of friends are now asking for the recipe.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

These are very tasty gingersnaps!  I like that they are milder than most, too.  I would not recommend using this recipe to make shapes, though.

Been looking for this recipe my entire life I think.  LOVE these gingersnaps.  Made them exactly as recipe and they were awesome.  Think I'll add some candied ginger next time for an extra zing.  But they are PERFECT just as they are.

This is easily the best cookie recipe I've ever used.  The cookies turned out perfect and tasted wonderful.  The only change I made was that I increased each spice by a half because we like very flavorful gingersnaps.  I chilled the dough overnight and it was so easy to handle that I baked all the cookies with ease.  I'd highly recommend this recipe.  The kids won't leave the cookie jar alone!

These are fantastic. I wanted to make something with ginger for my son with a stomachache...these were delicious!! The recipe made quite a few, it could definitely be halved for a smaller family.

I will never use any other gingersnap recipe again! This recipe actually makes twice the listed servings, if you roll out the dough into proper 1" balls - more for me!

I've been looking for this recipe for a long time, it's very similar to--if not the same as--a favorite aunt's that I lost ages ago.  Only difference is that we put raisins in our, goes great with the chewy taste and sweetens up the spicy flavor a tad.  Thanks!

Wonderful! This recipe makes a lot of cookies, so if you don't need that many, cut it in half. These cookies taste and look amazing when they're done!

These were EXCELLENT!!! Although the cookies I made didn't get the crevices on them; they were VERY smooth. Does anyone know what I may have done wrong? I followed the recipe exactly...

I usually make gingerbread men for Christmas but I didn't have the time this year so I tried these.  WOW! These are unbelievable.  Excellent flavour and texture.  In my opinion they get better with age - by the fourth day they still tasted out of this world.  No changes except I halved the recipe and rolled the cookies in coloured sugar.  Will be making these every year from now on.

This was my first time making gingersnaps. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out fantastic.  They are soft, chewy and spicey.  I baked the first batch for 9.5 minutes and they turned out a little underdone.  Twelve minutes worked best for my oven.  Give this recipe a try!

this could not be better!
we made a full batch last night and they are GONE already. 
i followed another person's suggestion and doubled the quantity of spices and i find it perfect. although my children were sad i wasn't making something with chocolate, they soon forgot once they smelled the baking cookies, and even my fussiest loved them. all i can say is this recipe is fab-u-lous!

Simply fantastic. I rolled smaller balls to make miniature cookies to donate to a local soup kitchen. Very tasty and once dough is made, easy for kids to get on the pan!

I also used this recipe last year and this has become a staple in my mother and I's cookie tray for Chrsitmas. Just the right spicy-ness. Super easy and so soft and chewy! It's a wonder that enough of them make it past my mouth to actually give away :]

Nice!  First time making gingersnaps and these will definitely make a repeat appearance.  The dough handled beautifully - I'd like a spicier cookie, so may opt to up some of the spices.  All in all, these were great!  Thank you for posting this recipe!

Super easy and super tasty recipe! I will definitely make this again! Took to a party and they were devoured and everyone raved about them! Just a warning though, no only are these addictive, but they make about 90+ 1 inch cookies! Next time I'll definitely half the recipe!

I took these cookies to a holiday party and they were gone within 20 minutes. I've recieved many compliments. I used less sugar and less molasses than called for, because it was all I had left, but they were still perfect. In fact, when I make these again I will use a bit less still.

These were good but the taste of all the spices were too strong for me.  Good cookie if you like very strong spice flavors.
