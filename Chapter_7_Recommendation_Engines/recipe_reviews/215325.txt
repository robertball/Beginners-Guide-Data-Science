I made a few changes to my original recipe and it turned out great! Maybe even better. I first browned the giblets in butter and then started the stock. also added brown gravy pack instead of turkey and it gave it a much richer flavor

My step-mother made this gravy and it was incredible! I know it was a little more effort, but it was so worth it! I'll be using this recipe next time I need turkey gravy.

I had bought some packaged gravy with all my other Thanksgiving fixings but decided I wanted to take it up a notch so, after searching several gravy recipes, I decided on this one.  Oh my, it was delicious!  Normally the pan of gravy just sits on the stove top until we're ready to eat but every time my husband walked by he dipped a piece of bread or piece of turkey into it while raving about it being the BEST gravy he's ever tasted.  I don't have a fat separator so I  filled my measuring cup with the turkey drippings and stuck it in the freezer so the fat solidified on top.  This will definitely be my go-to Thanksgiving gravy from now on!

I made this for Thanksgiving 2015. Best gravy ever. Made all except final step the day before. Added drippings/ thickening once turkey was done. Perfect. I had smoked turkey on Big Green Egg & stored it for three hours in empty ice chest after wrapping it with aluminum foil. Turkey was still piping hot & juicy & I had ample time to finish this gravy recipe. Definitely a crowd pleaser!

My first try at making gravy (my mother in law always made it) for Thanksgiving. Upon my husbands first taste, he told me I didn't make enough of it as it was SO good he was sure it wasn't enough to go around the table. This recipe is good for about 6 people.  If you have hungry men in the house, I would recommend doubling it for a bigger party.

I tried this recipe with the authors added suggestions last Thanksgiving (alng with Shelly White's Perfect Turkey) and it was, hands down, the best turkey graving we have ever had...I'm the kind of girl who doesn't care for gravy, but I wanted to impress my dad (who is an incredible cook and loves fine dining).  We all LOVED it....yes, even I could not stop eating it.  I am so surprised there are not more reviews.  The effort is well worth the rich flavor.  I was panicking last night when I realized that I never wrote down where I got the recipe and was so ecstatic when I recognized this as being the "one".....IMO the only "one".  Yum, yum, yum, can't wait for Thanksgiving :)

This gravy is delicious! The best gravy I've ever tasted. Its easy to make also. I used a brown gravy and a turkey gravy packet. I also used cornstarch to thicken and chicken stock because that's what I had on hand. The flavor was wonderful and the chicken stock didn't take away from the turkey flavor at all. You might want to keep it a secret from the kiddos that the gravy simmers with the turkey neck and giblets.

I made this tonight minus the milk and it came out delicious! I found myself eating a few spoonfuls of this before and after dinner and everyone here loved it.  this recipe made plenty, we are a family of 6 and there was some leftovers. I'll use it tomorrow for the Hubby's favorite biscuits and gravy.

This was my best gravy ever. I am giving it only 4 stars cause I deviate it from the recipe as some others suggested and put one brown and one turkey gravy mix instead.

Best.turkey.gravy.ever. 

I have never made turkey gravy before and this was definitely a winner! My family LOVED it and I'm worried they will eat more of the gravy than of the actual turkey legs I cooked also lol. 

Thank you for such a great recipe! I added the change that JULZBROWN said she added which was brown gravy and man that was the extra kick that just made it even that much more tasty!

This was my first time making turkey gravy from scratch and it was simply amazing!  Everyone loved my gravy!  I didn't have the turkey gravy packets so I substituted brown gravy mix packets.  It was wonderful.

Just like everyone else said, this is excellent! Best turkey gravy I ever made, or tasted! I don't know why it's hard to find when searching "turkey gravy" but it should have 100s more reviews and they should all be 5-star! Thanks so much for this recipe!

I brown the neck and giblets first in butter.  I don‚Äôt strain the neck, giblets and vegetables until the very end. Put it on low for 4 hours or until the turkey is ready. This recipe can be stored in a container and frozen if you have any left overs. So worth the effort and so delicious! Thank you for a wonderful recipe, it‚Äôs been added to our family favourites!

Such a great recipe. The only thing I would say is to be mindful of how much salt is in your turkey recipe since you add drippings. Mine has a lot. The first time I made this it was a salt bomb. The second time I used low salt gravy packets and no salt chicken stock and it was perfect once the drippings were added.

I was able to make tge stock the day before cooking the turkey, since I chose to beine the turkey this year. Excellent choice! I did not add the giblets or liver to the final gravy, but enjoyed it nice and smooth! No changes to the recipe needed!!!

Very simple, but excellent.  We made it as many reviewers suggested with turkey gravy and brown gravy, but we would go with turkey gravy only next time.  Also, most reviewers said it only served 6 people and that's crazy.  We doubled the recipe and it made more than a half gallon!  We served 12 and had tons left over.

Just unbelievably good. The best gravy I've ever had. I had never made gravy from scratch before. I had never worked with giblets before. It didn't matter, this really is the best.

Worth every second of effort for the taste. Boyfriend almost cried when I told him I didn't have time to make it this year and offered to help cook if I would make it.

This does not have to take so long and it is very simple but for some reason the directions made it feel complicated until I was done. Basically you make a nice stock by dumping the giblets/neck/veggies/seasonings into 4 cups of water or canned broth and boiling it, then straining it. Then you take your turkey drippings, whisk some flour into it, and combine it with the stock. I didn't have "turkey gravy mix" but dumped a bunch of poultry seasoning, salt, pepper and thyme in the stock while it cooked and adjusted it to taste at the end. I also used frozen pre chopped "seasoning blend" (celery and onion pieces) instead of cutting fresh veggies. I didn't have regular flour and used corn meal for the 1/4 cup of flour instead lol. And I also didn't simmer the stock for 2+hrs... I brought all ingredients to a hard boil then lowered the temp and boiled over medium for about 20-30min with the lid cracked then strained it. This gravy wasn't too thick or dark (I was imagining a dark gravy), but it was PERFECT and creamy and tasted amazing, and now I know how to make gravy! A few cups of good stock + drippings + flour! :)
