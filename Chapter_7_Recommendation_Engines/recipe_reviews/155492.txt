Very good and very easy. I expected it to have more cranberry flavor, though. The cinnamon and cloves gives it more of an apple cider taste. I did use more cloves than called for, however. That may have overpowered the cranberry. Next time, I'll stick to the original recipe.

Made this for a faculty holiday coffee...fit perfectly in my 35 cup Melita urn.    Put the sugar, spices and salt into a cheese cloth and placed into the percolator basket, though I'm sure lining it with paper filters would have worked.    Punch was festive without being too sweet.  A great alternative to mulled cider!

This is my family's favorite Christmas drink recipe! Smells wonderful and tastes great with fudge. It gets super hot in the percolator, so let it cool a bit before serving.

I made this for Thanksgiving and thought it was very good. It made my house smell awesome, too.

it is as good as they say it is.  Served this punch at a church Ladies Christmas gathering.  Every one wanted to the recipe to make for their own events.  I did not have a percolator, so I threw the ingredients in a crockpot, with the cloves wrapped in cheesecloth. The longer it sat in the crockpot, the better the flavor. Thanks for sharing.
