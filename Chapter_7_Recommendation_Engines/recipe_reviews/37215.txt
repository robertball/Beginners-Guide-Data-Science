These hot tomato grits have become my take to anything dish. This is always the recipe I am asked to make for pot luck suppers, etc.
I substitute one can of diced tomatoes, Rotel, mild, or regular diced tomatoes for the fresh, in a doubled recipe. Using canned tomatoes means I can always have the ingredients on hand. thanks.

I used a can of MILD Rotel tomatoes, because i couldn't believe the 1/8 tsp of green chilies.  Would have been better to use the SPICY, this definitely needs a kick!  Otherwise, it was an easy dish to make, and the recipe easily would serve 8 to 10 as a side dish.

Really great recipe!!  I used more bacon and home-made broth so this is a REAL keeper for us.  As is with any recipe, you need to customize to suit your taste. All I can say is yum-yum! Love things thick and tasty!!

This was awesome!!  I took some to work and even the grit-haters loved it! Being a vegetarian, I changed the bacon to veggie bacon and the chicken broth to vegetable broth and it was still great. I used half sharp cheddar and half mild cheddar for the cheese.  Tomatoes aren't in season now so I used a can of drained, diced tomatoes with peppers and onions.  Great recipe!

I Loved these grits!!  Would love to always have a bowl of them in the frige
ready to reheat.  Sadly, my bag of grits was not as fresh as I thought they were
and so my batch was benefitted by a dollop of sour cream on the top and some roasted garlic stirred in.  But with fresh grits I don't imagine they'd need the extras at all.    Yummmy!!

My husband loves grits (I can take it or leave it), so I've tried to find some good recipes in recent years.  This is by far our favorite - it even made a believer out of me!

This is now a favorite with my family.  It's so easy to make.  The first time I made it using fresh tomatoes and canned green chiles.  The second time I just used a can of Rotel.  Not much of a difference, tasted great either way.

Wonderful - used a can of Rotel and a Mexican blend of cheeses plus sharp cheddar (I did use way more than a cup! We like our grits cheesy around here). Could have used a little Tabasco - but was still great!

It was a different grit recipe. I would discard most of the bacon fat next time as the bacon flavor was too strong and it seems a little greasy. My son who does not like grits, liked this.

I'm not much of a "grits" eater but these were delicious. I totally left out the bacon/grease and they were excellent!!! Served with fish and had none left over.  Will definitely make again.

Good and yummy. My husbad who likes his grits with salt, pepper and sugar declined to eatit (party pooper) but my 1 and 4 year old gobbled it up.Everybody had seconds! We tried it with and without sugar. Of course, they ate even faster once I added the sugar. We ate it for breakfast and the entire time I had a hankering for some fried fish. if I try a recipe twice, it's good! and im trying this again with fried fish InshaAllah. its simple too, easy enough to make a family repeat. Thanx.

Definitely not health food, but it's really tasty! I can't wait to have the leftover grits with fried eggs.
