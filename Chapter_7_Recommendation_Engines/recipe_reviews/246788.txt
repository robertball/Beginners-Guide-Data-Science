I would make this again.  I didn't put in the white pepper because I tasted it after the chili oil and it was soooo spicy.  I would recommend starting with half the amount of chili oil and adding the rest based on personal taste.  I used it as a dip for artichoke leaves,  celery, sweet peppers, and triscuits.
