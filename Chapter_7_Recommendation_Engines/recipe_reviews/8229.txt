Even though my first attempt was a flop, I still give this a five for taste. I am not an experienced cheesecake maker, but I looked up some tips and I will make this again today. Here's what I learned: 1)Cream the cheese before adding all your other ingredents. This gets all the lumps out without adding too much air. Eggs are what traps the air. 2) Checking for doneness: One article I read said it should look shiney on top. I did not want to prick with a toothpick and risk cracking the top, so I followed the instructions given here and it was a runny mess. 3)I added 1 tsp of vanilla and subsituted sour cream for whipping cream and it taste great. I like the tang the saour cream gives it. 4) Grease your entire pan that way it will pull away from the pan as it cools avoid cracks. I also notice the edges were nicer when it pulled away on its own. The parts where I had to run my knife around the edge looked jagged and crumbly (cold be due to being undercooked - I dunno). 5) I followed the advice of another reviewer and only spread the shortbread on the bottom, however, I found it to be too thick. Tastey, but it was like try to swallow a spoonful of peanut butter. Sorry this is so long, but I wanted to try and save any first time cheesecake makers (like myself) frustration on some of these novice mistakes.

For many years, I have been in charge of baking the dessert for various family celebrations. After baking dozens of cheesecakes, I have found that this cheesecake recipe was HANDS DOWN the most superior plain cheesecake recipe. The taste and texture were phenomenal--absolute perfection.  I like a slightly dense cheesecake and this was truly was--like one you would find in a New York deli.  The shortbread crust was so delicious and blended perfectly with the cake.  

I believe the temperatures and baking times (as well as the hour cooling time in the oven after baking is complete), were one of the reasons this cake comes out so beautifully textured and decadent.  Most of my previous cheesecakes cracked.  No cracks in this one.  It looked gorgeous.  I've unsuccessfully tried water baths in the past.  I also believe that water baths add moisture to the cheesecake which negatively affects the density/testure.  So, from now on, I will never use a water bath and I will adjust baking times to allow for that one hour oven cooling time.

I got rave reviews...Several people insisted that this cheesecake HAD to be from a high-end catalogue. Thanks to Sandy for posting this great cheesecake recipe.

This recipe is phenomenal! I recently moved from USA to Finland, where my husband is from, and since living here I have had unconsolable cravings for foods from home that just aren't available here. Cheesecake was one of these undeniable yearnings. I asked my hubby if he knew what it was, and he didn't, nor could I find cream cheese at any of the stores. I was devasted and figured I would have to add cheesecake, my most favorite food, to the now ever-lengthening list of foods I can no longer make for lack of ingredients. But, as it turns out I was finally able to find cream cheese - yummy Philadelphia, actually - and the first thing I did was try this recipe. I didn't change a thing and it was absolutely perfect. 

I have made this twice in the past 2 weeks, much to the joy of my husband and his family who are now absolute cheesecake addicts! 

The famiy is so taken with this recipe and "new" dessert. I'll never try another again! This great recipe has already become a new family tradition for us! 

Also, I really think the shortbread crust was dynamite. So many cheesecake recipes call for crushed graham crackers, which I've always used, and those aren't available here in Finland, either, so having the chance to make a tasty crust from scratch with ingredients I had on hand was just awesome. In fact, the crust was the reason I chose this recipe in the first place. :P And, I have to say that this crust was better than any graham crust, and just as simple.

Wonderful cheescake...thank you for sharing. For all you choco-holics out there I made this cheesecake even more decadent by melting 6oz.(half a bag)of semi-sweet chocolate chips in the microwave and mixing it with half of the cheesecake batter. I then poured the chocolate cheesecake mixture on top of the crust and then toppped it with the remaining cheesecake batter, so I had 2 layers. Oh my...looks like it came from a restaurant, tastes even better!

I would like to add another response but apparently they only allow one so I am editing this one.  To the person who said that the eggs are too much for only 2 packages of cream cheese, its because there are FIVE packages, 2 1/2 POUNDS... please try it again!

I would also like to tell the people who don 't consider this a New York cheesecake, that it is Lindy's recipe. So i'm pretty sure that qualifies! Thank you for the responses in any event!

Earlier response:I am overwhelmed by these reviews! I haven't been to the site in a long time (in fact I had to re-join)and I am so happy to see others have enjoyed this.

I am making the cheesecake today for a family birthday tomorrow night. I am using a ganache topping (easy- just bring heavy cream to a boil and pour over chocolate chips- stir and let cool)and topping it after it has chilled overnight; then garnishing with chocolate-dipped strawberries.

Holy CHEESECAKE Batman!!!......WOW there is no doubt that this is the ultimate perfect cheesecake recipe.   I used the allrecipes.com article: “Making Cheesecake Filling”.  As for the crust, I do like my graham cracker crust.  For the crust I used a bit of a couple of different recipes and I made 1 ½ the recipe.  FYI Vanilla is a must for almost everything (if it is not called for in the recipe, I usually add at least 1 tsp).  I press the crust up the sides of the pan as well as the bottom.  Then refrigerated it while making the filling.  To me, the article made me more nervous about bubbles and cracks…at the end I didn’t have any bubbles or cracks.  Creaming the cheese is important.  I left mine out for over an hour or so, it was very easy and quick to cream it.  I followed the article and recipe (except to add vanilla) as laid out.  I placed a 9x13 pan of water on the shelf directly under the pan, I’m not sure if this helped or not.  Superb outcome…….I made 2 cheesecakes within 2 days – 1 reg fat and sugar  and  one low-fat and Splenda with cornflakes crust.  My parents absolutely loved the Low-fat No Sugar cake….For those with sugar and fat intake limits, the substitution of the low-fat and Splenda truly works with this recipe!!....Also, as I made the second one, I still followed the article, but didn’t fret so much and it still came out perfect… I found this recipe and the article really not hard to do, it’s just following the recipe and using a specific process that help

I have made this cheesecake several times and everyone says it is the best they have ever had. I am NOT a good baker but this is an easy recipe. (The KEY is to make sure your cream cheese is room temperature before beginning or you will get lumps. Instead of an electric mixer I use a wooden spoon. DON'T open the oven while the cheesecake is baking.) I served a chocolate version today at an ornament exchange and everyone raved about it. After the original recipe was mixed I added 8 squares of melted semi-sweet chocolate making sure to stir only until the chocolate was incorporated. Instead of the shortbread crust I used 16 coarsely crushed oreos mixed with 2 tbs of butter pressed into the springform pan and did not prebake. I poured the chocolate version on top and followed the original baking instructions. PERFECT and NO CRACKS!!!!

Okay, 1st attempt at a cheesecake, results: fantastic. The cake was perfectly cooked, looked great with no cracks, just the right density and great flavor.  

*Definitely make sure your cream cheese is at room temperature. If you use an electric mixer, keep it on low and don't overmix - you may add to much air, and that's bad.

*After reading many reviews on many recipes, I finally made the choice to do the water bath.  I used a large baking sheet, set the springform pan inside (wrapped on the outside with a plastic roasting bag, as suggested in another recipes' review - worked great and was easier than foil) and added about 1" of boiling water from a tea kettle after I placed it on the rack in the oven.

*Used an oven thermomemter to be sure my oven temp was accurate and followed recipe temp and time exactly.

*I did not open the door of the oven (no matter how badly I wanted to peek). I then placed it in the refrigerator for 6 hours before serving.

I topped it with Supreme Strawberry Topping from this site and my 16 guests were blown away - I had a hard time convincing some that this was not a store bought cake.

Final suggestions - while my 'reviewers' liked the crust that comes with this recipe, it was a bit sweet and may be a bit different than what you're used to.  I'll be trying a graham or other crust next time.  Also, be patient.  You don't have to be an expert baker to pull this off, but you have to take your time.  It will be worth the investment.

Makes a lovely, dense, flavorful cheesecake.  I didn't need a water bath or anything, and it was perfect; no cracks.  I just left it in the oven until it totally cooled to room temp and then put it in the fridge.  I also made a few adjustments: I used a combination of sugar and splenda (couldn't tell the difference), cut the total sugar down to 1.5 cups (plenty sweet), added vanilla as recommended by reviewers, and left out the extra 2 egg yolks.  The egg yolks weren't missed - I don't like my cheesecakes eggy.  I paired it with a homemade berry sauce: frozen strawberries, dethawed w/ the juice (these were home-frozen so no syrup); frozen berry mix from safeway; sugar; vanilla balsamic vinegar.  Lightly boil for 10 minutes.  Mix some cornstarch with a bit of water and mix into the berry mixture to thicken.  Let cool.  You can add some cinnamon/nutmeg for some spice, but it's a nice, naturally sweet and tart sauce to compliment the creamy sweetness of the cheesecake.  I also sprayed my springform pan with PAM for baking and I didn't have to use a knife to separate the crust from the pan at all.  It separated on its own beautifully.

Definitely a very good cheesecake!  My husband says the crust tastes like a sugar cookie! :)  
I didn't have heavy whipping cream laying around, so I looked up on google some substitutes for heavy whipping cream, and found out that sour cream is fermented whipping cream.  Well by golly...So I just used sour cream, and it turned out great! :)  Thanks for the recipe!

I have never in my posted a review on anything even though i strongly research everything. I love to cook and sweets are my favorite to make. I just made 2 of these today for the 1st time ever making cheese cake. They were perfect! After reading over 300 reviews, the only changes I did was= graham cracker crust, and added vanillia flavoring. No cracks, NO BATH WATER NEEDED, no bubbles. I did set out my eggs, cream cheese to room temp.After the Philladephia Creamcheese was room temp I used a hand mixer and mix by it's self gets rid of lumps. Added all eggs one at a time mixed with a spoon. Tapped my pan to debubble any air bubbles.I also let my pan sit for a few min before placing it in the oven.No eggie taste. I did not change any temps nor my time. Kept it to the recipie. If yours doesn't turn out, make sure when mixing your filling be patient and don't rush this. When I got to the step of turning the oven off, I left both cheesecakes in the oven for hrs, then into the fridge. If I can do this for the 1st time and turned out RIGHT, anyone can and retry it this if you mess up. It's worth it.Don't use the creamcheese "spread" that comes in a bowl. Use the best cream cheese in the blocks. Use a 10''springform pan. Don't get into deep on the negative reviews. This recipe is awesome and EASY just be patient and use room temp products.Only product that was cold was the heavy cream. Trust me. I can burn anything easy..

I made this recipe, and was quite disappointed.  First of all, it is NOT New York style cheesecake.  Anyone that is familiar with the white, dense, almost crumbly cheesecake of NY, and is looking for that recipe should pass this one by.  This recipe produces more of a heavy cheesecake custard (I should have known with all the eggs), and in my opinion, has kind of an "off" flavor that I can't quite put my finger on.  It is better with a fruit topping, and if I made this recipe again (which I won't), I would add the zest of two lemons.

With a few additions, this is THE classic Lindy's Cheesecake recipe. I couldn't put my hands on my mother's copy and didn't want to impose on her to recite it over the phone, so I searched the internet and found this.  The only changes I made were (per a phone call to Mom): 1 tsp. lemon zest + 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract to the crust, then adding 1-1/2 tsp. each of lemon and orange zest + 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract to the filling. This may be just the touch for those who complained that it lacked flavor. I wish I'd also asked my mother about the baking time, because I followed this recipe to the letter and didn't worry about the jiggly center. Granted, it appeared to firm up overnight, but upon serving turned out to be a runny mess in the center. I've since consulted my mother's recipe, which calls for 10 minutes @ 500°F, followed by 1 hour + 40 minutes @  200°F. (Don't open oven door). Other recipes call for 1 hour @ 250°F. A perfect Lindy's should be lightly browned at the edges. A few tips to avoid cracking: add the eggs one at a time, beating just til mixed. Overbeating adds air, which makes the cake rise (then fall and crack) during baking. Slow cooling is also essential. Ideally, it should cool for 2 to 3 hours before refrigerating. Despite the runny center, everyone loved it and kept apologizing for sneaking seconds, then thirds. My New York aunt -- a regular at Lindy's back in the day -- was elated and said this was her first taste of a real Lindy's cheesecake in 50 years.

This is a GREAT and easy recipe! I've made it at least 7-8 times and it always comes out good to taste! The cheesecake is nice and dense, but not too much. I made a few adjustments according to some of the previous comments. The crust is really its downfall, but easily fixed! You can either use graham crackers with butter, oreo cookies with butter, or even just store-bought short bread. Crush it up and pack it in the bottom of pan.  Instead of using 5 eggs and 2 yolks, I took out the 2 yolks. It makes the cheesecake a little too dense to my liking and a lot more yellow.  Added 1 1/2 cup of sugar instead of the 1 3/4. Replaced that missing sweetness with the richness of 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract.  Used sour cream instead of heavy cream for extra cheesy tartness. It was a good decision.   Mix cream cheese with sugar at the very beginning, the sugar helps smooth out the cream cheese. Add flour (get the dry ingredients out of the way). Add vanilla extract and sour cream, which made batter more liquidy. Then added the eggs one at a time and mix only enough to incorporate.  After everything's smooth, I banged the mixing bowl (use my palm to hit the side of the bowl or simply picking it up and dropping it on a hard surface)for a good 5-7 minutes to remove all the bubbles from the mixing. After I pour it in the pan, I banged it some more, 3-4 minutes, to remove more bubbles from the pouring. Makes everything dense, instead of fluffs. Played around with temp a lot. For 2 x 8'' p

This is the best cheesecake recipe EVER!! Don't let the funky reviews fool you, if you follow the recipe CORRECTLY, your cake will come out perfect. For the people who say the baking time is off, it isn't. Get an oven thermometer, it's your oven that's off.
I do add 1 tblsp. vanilla to the cake batter, and a sprinkle of cinnamon to the crust for a little extra flavor.
One last tip: save adding the eggs for last. Adding in the eggs is what holds in air bubbles, so mix everything else together with the hand mixer, then crack all the eggs into a seperate bowl. Use a fork to poke the yolks and stir, then add to the batter and stir BY HAND until just mixed. Don't use the hand mixer after adding the eggs, that is just asking for cracks! Let batter sit for a few minutes after adding eggs then pour into crust. Perfect cheesecake everytime!

This is the best cheesecake you'll ever make. The key to making this cheesecake without cracking is to make sure youe creamcheese and eggs are at room tempature, I've also put the cream cheese in the sink with warm water, this worked great, since doing this, I've never had a cheesecake crack or split.

Second attempt at a review, I accidentally hit the “Done” button and I can’t edit my first review. I have used this recipe A LOT over the past 8 years. I often get requests to make cheesecake for people, and this is my go-to recipe. I do not change any of the ingredients, I only make changes in the process. 1) It is important when making cheesecake that all of your ingredients are at room temperature, the cream cheese especially, it will cream much faster and smoother if it’s at room temp. 2) Cream the cream cheese (sounds weird I know) before adding any other ingredients. Once you have creamed the cream cheese add the sugar and make sure it is well incorporated. 3) Add the eggs one at a time, scraping the bowl between each egg. 4) I always stir the whipping cream in by hand with my spatula. 5) When I pour the batter into the springform, I pour it through a mesh sieve. This catches any lumps that may have gotten missed in the mixing process and helps remove excess air. 6) I always use a water bath! I have wrapped my pan in heavy duty foil and used a Reynolds baking bag (the huge one that fits a turkey), I prefer the baking bag. I’ve never had one rip or leak water into my cheesecake. With the water bath make sure your water is boiling before adding the water into the roasting pan. 7) Leave the cheesecake in the oven for an hour to cool then cool on the counter for an hour before refrigerating. Following these steps my cheesecakes never crack!

This the absolute best plain cheesecake I've ever made! Everyone loved it! I did make a graham cracker crust (1 c. graham cracker crumbs, 1/3 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. melted butter, 1 tsp. cinnamon). Made no changes to the filling recipe. DO grease the inside of your springform pan. When you turn off the oven, I recommend running a knife around the edge of the pan and loosening the latch on the pan to prevent cracks.

After reviewing some of the comments, I have decided to make Graham Crumb Crust (which I didn’t prebake, but you can). I lined outside of my 10 inch pan with aluminum foil, greased it with butter, and lined it (inside) with baking paper. This way, there`s really no need for water bath.I found one comment that was extremely helpful in my opinion: I prewarmed cream cheese and eggs in a bowl filled with warm water. Also, I used 1 cup of sugar for the filling, didn’t use yolks, added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp of lemon zest and 1 tsp of lemon juice to the filling and substituted whipping cream for the sour cream. I added eggs at the end and mixed them with the wooden spoon (DO NOT use mixer at this point) just until well combined. Also, I changed the temperature to 215 F and left the baking time at 1 hour. This is my first cheesecake that didn’t crack and I can’t wait to taste it (it is steel cooling in the fridge). I am so happy with how it’s looking; I had to write review before I have even tried it!  Update: it tastes wonderful too. The texture is dense and it was very easy to cut it. This is definitely the most beautiful and the most tasteful cheesecake I`ve ever made. Thank`s for the great recipe and thank`s to reviewers, without some reviews cake wouldn`t turn out so great.

I've made this cake 4 times -- each and every time it's been a hit.  To prevent cracks and overbrowning; 1. do not over mix the batter -- mix slowly and just enough to combine the ingredients (you don't want to add any air); and 2.  have a 9x13x2" pan of boiling water in the oven when you start the preheating; and 3. use an oven thermometer!

Taste is great- just what you expect and want for a cheesecake. (Though I am not a connoisseur of cheesecakes, particularly "New York" style) It was my first cheesecake I ever made and here are my tips for making it turn out better than mine did:
1. by "softened" cream cheese, they mean room temperature. Don't even try it until that cream cheese is really, really soft.
2. When you cream in the other ingredients into the cream cheese, mix them thoroughly after each addition. Other comments have said that it's the eggs that shouldn't be overly stirred, so stir and mix well the dry ingredients.
3. Add one egg at a time, mix. Add next egg. I had lumpy muck for my filling because I didn't mix the ingredients in order and I didn't slowly add the ingredients to get a fine consistency (and my cream cheese was too cold).
4. the crust is yummy, but don't prebake it too long or it will be a little dry and tough. just a little though.

Great cheesecake. The texture is perfect. My husband gave it 2 thumbs up. I made it for his work party and it was a success. I baked it in a water bath at 475 for 10 minutes and then I reduced temp to 350 degrees for next 15 mins then turned it down to 200 and baked for 1 hour. I didn't leave it in the oven because my cake was done at this point. Thanks for the recipe!

Just a tip about the use of a water bath - I noticed some are boiling their water for the water bath which is not recommended.  The purpose of the water bath is to slowly and uniformly control the heating of the cheesecake as it bakes so, start with room temp water.  Setting your unbaked cheesecake in a bath of boiling water is a sudden shock.  Happy baking!

Cheesecake was good.  However saying that it was 5 of the 8 oz packages of cream cheese would have made it much clearer for the novices.

This gets rave reviews everywhere that I take it. I don't use all the crust because I like a thin crust. I add 1/2 T of flavoring (almond, lemon & orange all work) to the cheesecake and I cook it for 70 minutes after lowering the oven temperature.  I follow the cooling directions exactly and it makes a beautifly, crack-free cake every time.  I like to serve it with raspberry sauce and whipped cream.

Made this for Christmas and followed directions exactly. DID NOT SET UP! What a disappointment. Was just like batter in a pan. Top looks done and crust is fine but center was complete goo. Terrible and inedible. Don't know what went wrong. So no holiday desert for us.

Made this twice, the first time it cracked, but was otherwise perfect, covered with a ganache and it was a hit.  2nd time I used a waterbath and "yea", no cracks!  But downside I didn't adjust cooking time and got a really soft center. My bad, should have watched for the top to brown up before reducing the heat.  Love the recipe.

YUM!!!  This is by far my favorite cheesecake recipe!  The only thing I changed was to use a graham cracker/pecan crust.  Next time I will try setting the oven temp to 225 degrees as I felt it could have been a little more firm in the center.  I served this with a whipped cream cheese frosting and some homemade strawberry topping for those who wanted it.  Next time I will try raspberries or blueberries for the topping, depending on my mood, though it's wonderful plain!

I've made this three times now in the past two months and everyone wants the recipe or for me to make another.  I use the graham crust recipe for the NY cheesecake II on this site and everyone absolutely loves the taste and texture of this recipe.  I followed some advice on this site and added a teaspoon of Vanilla and this cheesecake is perfect.  Mine cracked slightly, but who really cares, it tastes wonderful and I think it is worth it to not risk a soggy graham crust.

I make this recipe once a year for a special holiday and it is perfect everytime.  I put it in a bath just to be cautious and am careful to use softened cream cheese so that I don't have to mix too much.

These are the changes I made to the recipe:  1) I use sour cream in place of heavy cream and 2) I add a tablespoon of vanilla based on another review.

Fantastic.  One word of caution for the shortbread crust:  do NOT use high gluten flour if you want the crust to be at its best.

I halved the recipe and poured it into a cake mold for a special meal that needed a salmon shaped dessert. It worked perfectly!  Then I used pomegranate for the scales, chocolate for the fins, and placed the cheesecake "salmon" on a plate of blueberries. Looking at it, people couldn't believe it was cheesecake! But it tasted awesome! Seriously. This is the creamiest cheese cake I have ever made. Everyone raved. Great recipe!! and great tips from the reviewers ahead of me. I decreased the egg by one and played with the flour amount. It came out great without a water bath and without a springform pan. just awesomely delicious!

This is THE cheesecake recipe! I used a 9 inch springform pan for this. I let the cream cheese and eggs get to room temperature first. I made the sortbread with a touch of cinnamon and vanilla added in for flavor. I only cooked it for 10 minutes though as that is plenty long. Next time I may only cook it for 8 minutes as after everything it was a bit dry around the edges. When I made the filling I did add a touch of vanilla to it as well which I think added to the flavor wonderfully. I cooked as directed in the recipe. The only thing I did different there was I let it sit for 2 hours instead of 1 because it still seemed to have too much movement in the center. After the two hours I put directly in the fridge and chilled for 24 hours. My cheesecake looked perfect with no cracks or anything. The cheescake was the best tasting cheesecake I have ever tasted and I think better then the Cheesecake Factory! It can be used as a base for other types of cheesecakes too. I plan on doing othe types in the future. Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

Okay this whole cheesecake thing is still relatively new to me. This is the first cheesecake I have ever made. So I made every precaution I knew to prevent the "Crack of Death"; that I've seem to hear so much about. So I did this recipe differently: 
1. I left the cream cheese out at room temperature for about three to four hours.
2. When it was time. I mixed the eggs, yolks, flour, sugar together in a seperate freezer bag, and mixed it with my hands. Then I placed it aside until the crust was completed.
3. Preheated the oven and made the crust. The crust recipe itslef came out a little short. It seemed to sink from the walls when it baked. So a bit more ingredients would help.
4. After the crust was completed. I beated the softened cream cheese with the egg mixture from the bag. I beat it first on low speed with a hand mixer then on its highest to reduce the "lumps" in the mixture. Then I used a spatula to press out all the lumps and air bubbles. If there are some tiny air bubbles left don't worry about it. 
5. Added the heavy whipping cream and mixed it by hand. Shook it and jiggled it so all the air bubbles would surface to the top, poured it into the pan, and popped it in the oven to finish the remaining recipe.

You can read this in conjunction with the original recipe. So you get the "big" picture of what I was doing differently. Well I hoped this helped. I will definitley reuse this process again since it produced such great results......-China.

The first time I made this cheesecake, I followed the directions exactly and the center was still runny. The second time I made it I allowed it to bake in the oven at 200 for almost 2 hours and it was perfect! I got rave reviews and was even told from a friend who dines out a lot that this was the best cheesecake she had ever had! Will definitely make again!

I've made this cheesecake for every occasion imaginable and it is ALWAYS a success!  People will beg you to bring this tasty cheesecake again and again.  I agree with almost every suggestion from other readers: make sure cream cheese is at room temperature, don't forget any ingredients because it turns out the best when followed correctly.  My only other suggestion is to make sure you use Philidelphia cream cheese.  I tried a generic store brand and it was a funny texture compared to the perfectly creamy Phili.  I get the best precision cuts when I quick freeze the cheesecake for an 1-3 hours.  It makes a prettier cut and the bottom of the cheesecake(cookie crust) slides right from the springform pan.  I just started doing this after making 25+ cheesecakes....wish I would have tried from the very beginning.  Since I was a young child baking with my grandmother, I always thought making a cheesecake was the hardest thing ever to make.  Not true with this recipe!  Please try it, you will not be disappointed!!!!!

This is definitely NOT a thick dense cheesecake like what you would get in NY. Sorry, but anyone that has ever tasted an authentic cheesecake would not say that this tastes the same or is even the same texture. It APPEARS the same, but is not once cut & tasted.  It was an extreme let down after all the anticipation & excitement was built up that I was finally going to have a REAL cheesecake recipe to use.....then I tasted it........sigh....not thrilled at all. It is actually creamy & more like a store bought frozen variety. to me.  I was expecting much much more from the title & a few of the reviews, so my anticipation level was quite high when I dug into the deliciously looking & quite beautiful dessert. Will definitely NOT be keeping this recipe. I did give it 3 stars for simplicity & for edibility, but not something I recommend to those who have ever really tasted a true thick, dense, crumbly, NY cheesecake.

Abslutely love this recipe, however, we all decided that we do prefer it with an extra thick graham cracker crust instead of the shortbread which was just ok. Hint: Make sure to only use Lg. eggs (not XL or jumbo, lol ;) Also, gently mix eggs with a fork in a separate bowl and let it sit for a while to get rid of any air bubbles, then fold/stir into the beaten mixure with a spoon; it helps make it so the cheesecake doesn't crack/split while baking.

Best New York Cheesecake recipe ever!!! I finally found the ultimate cheesecake recipe after trying 6 different recipes.  Other recipes add sourcream so the cheesecakes taste a little weak but this one doesn't add any sourcream and it tastes so great!  It tastes just like the Cheesecake Factory one. I am so happy to find this recipe. THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!

this recipe is so close to mine I just had to try it, I also added vanilla and it was fabulous. I have made it many times, and am making another today. This time I am adding pecans and toffee chips, combine these in a saucepan with 1/2 cp heavy cream mix till creamy amd smooth, cool slightly,then pourover chilled cheesecake prior to serving. absolutely yummy!!  just a quick note, i have increased the cooking tme to almost 2 hours on 200, the rested in oven for one hr after with the door cracked, and i always use a pan of water beneath my cheesecake pan. it really works to prevent cracks. give it a try!!

Absolutely the best cheesecake ever.  I have never had a cheesecake that didnt crack before, no matter what method I used, until this one.  No cracks, perfect smooth top.  The only alteration I made was to add about a teaspoon and a half of good vanilla and about the same of fresh lemon juice.  I could not have asked for a better recipe.  This will be the only cheescake I make from now on.   Just a couple notes - For those of you that are having problems with it not setting are you using a 10 inch springform pan?  If you are using a smaller pan you are definately going to have to increase your baking time.  Also, remember to never mix this at a high speed and tap the pan on the counter several times after adding the batter to remove the air bubbles or it will rise and crack.

Great recipe... Took shortbread out at 10 minutes. added vanilla and almond extract to filling..... baked at 450 for 10 minutes then 325 for 1hr and 50 mins(this is important if you want your cheesecake to be anything other than colorless)....turned off oven let sit inside for 30 mins......PERFECT!!!!!!! no jiggling whatsoever!! let cool on counter for 15 minutes and had to taste a piece.. Fabulous... Do not listen to the negative reviews... If you are a first time cheesecake baker read all reviews and tweek to your standards.

Was a really easy recipe and Im only giving it four stars because of all the extra unecessary egg. The two extra egg yolks weren't needed and you should definately add a little vanilla extract for flavor.

I HIGHLY recommend making this about 2-3 days before you plan on serving it. I made it the day before my halloween party, and it was just ok. It didnt have that "bite" i was craving. But, boy, 2 days later, its fabulous!!! And even though graham cracker crust would have been yummy, the shortbread gives it a great texture. I did add about 1/4 cup of sour cream, and lessened the cream by just a little. and i added a few squirts of lemon juice.  excellent!!!

This cheesecake was excellent, except that I found the cooking time to be wrong.  I followed the directions exactly for baking, and it sure looked done, until I went to cut it today and found the middle was still soupy.  Other than that, this recipe is delicious!  I used a chocolate graham cracker crust, added 1/2 tsp vanilla and some toffee candy bar chips.  The next afternoon (today) I made a chocolate ganache, melted some caramel and broke up some chocolate covered toffee bars.  I stuck some chunks to the side with the ganache, and put the rest on the top.  I then drizzled the chocolate and caramel all over the top.  It was gorgeous!  Too bad I didn't think to pre-slice! Hardened caramel is hard to cut, lol.  (I would've also known the middle wasn't done before I served it to my husband for his birthday!)  Anyway, this recipe is a keeper with a modified bake time, and makes an excellent cheesecake base for some fancy stuff.  I'm definitely going to use it the next time I make my white chocolate raspberry swirl!

OK, before making this, I had never made cheesecake.  I usually buy my cheesecake at the store. I have to say, this was AWESOME!!!!  I made a few adjustments thanks to everyone's reviews.  I added some vanilla, only used 4 eggs (still used the 2 egg yolks though), used regular whipping cream and low-fat cream cheese.  I thoroughly sprayed my springform pan with Pam.  The key I believe is leaving the cheesecake in the oven without opening it for the one hour of cooking and one hour of cooling off.  I can't begin to describe the amount of willpower it took NOT to open the oven.  When I was done, there were NO CRACKS!  I refrigerated it overnight and VOILA.....an AWESOME CHEESECAKE that I will keep in my recipe box forever.  The best part....it was so easy to make....thanks so much for this great recipe!

This recipe turned out exactly as I had hoped; a thick, dense, and delicious cheesecake! I left it in the oven for about four hours to cool and did not have one crack. I was afraid it was not done in the middle but the cake finishes off and firms up beautifully while the oven is cooling off. Be sure to refrigerate for at least 6 hours before serving or it will still be very soft. Thanks for the recipe!

AMAZING!!!!This would have 5 stars if the baking time was appropiate! I had to try twice with this one to get it right. The original baking time of 1 hour was not near long enough (and I have a newer oven)! I baked it for 2 hours at 200, added vanilla, and it was perfect! Thanks.

This is a great cheesecake!!! I made this on Thanksgiving and now I'm asked to make it every family event. Many of the reviews helped me a lot to make this perfect. Some things to keep in mind are, do not beat everything together it will make air bubbles and that will cause cracking.  Also when going from 475 to 200, if you have a very hot oven go down slowly... a cheese cake that is at a hot temp then to a cool temp fast will crack easily. One last thing that can cause cracking is over cooking...if you notice cracking turn oven off early and let cool inside.  Also for the taste I use 4 1/2 Philadelphia cream cheese bars it taste a lot better for some reason with a little less then the given amount.

Oh yeah, this is where it's at. Nice, dense, tasty cheesecake. If you prefer the old-school jello-like cheesecake, you might not appreciate the density and texture of this bad boy - but rest assured from this Yankie, this is as close as you're going to get without taking a trip up north. I like the crust - It's bangin!

I have now made this 3 times perfect every time, I even made it in a 13x9" pan the last time and it came out the same. So creamy and smooth and if you make sure oven is right temp. it will not crack.  I Don't bake the crust at 400* seems like it gets really brown and dry. That is the only thing I do different. Now I  make it for every holiday, and special occasion's, thanks this is the only one I will ever make again!!

Great - nice and dense.  Half the recipe filled four 4-1/2" springform pans perfectly.

I used graham cracker crusts and later wiped off as much of the crust as I could. The flavor was too overpowering for the delicate cheesecake - the shortbread crust would have been MUCH MUCH better.  I should've listened to the other reviewers...live and learn.

Takes some time, but its worth it.  Many say not to overmix, but I just couldnt get the lumps out so I put the mix into my blender (little at a time becasue it woudlnt all fit at once) and mixed it like that.  I'm sure that was overmixing it, but it came out perfect, did not crack and tasted great.  There was so much mix though, that I also had to get another pan and make a "crustless" cheesecake, just so I didnt waste the mix, and it also came out wonderful.  The crust is a little dry, so if  youre not into that, make a graham cracker crust or but a premade one.

I just made this recipe for the first time and it was absolutely perfect! I am not great at baking but I followed the recipe and took the advice of others and added a a tablespoon of vanilla extract and left the cream cheese, butter and eggs out for a couple hours to get to room temperature and it turned out great. No cracks and it really did look like it came from a bakery! I used the exact timing and temperature in the recipe and it was perfect. I agree with others that if the cheesecake did not turn out right, your oven may be off temp. We liked it so much that I'm about to make the second one this week.

We liked this recipe but thought it could have a bit more flavor(despite my additions)and sweetness.  I made a regular pie crust for the bottom and not the crust recommended in the recipe as we prefer a plain crust.  I also lined the sides with parchment paper. The parchment provided me with clean sides without any crumbs and allowed the cake to pull away from the pan without any sticking as this can cause cracking. I added some vanilla and lemon extract. The cake baked up nice and high with no cracks.  I served it with fresh blueberry sauce from this site.  I like the recipe enough to make again but will bump up the sugar and extract amounts.

I have used this recipe for over two years now and I think it is the best!  Something I do different is add a tbsp of vanilla.  I don't like crust whether graham cracker or flour, therefore, I don't use it.  Just simply top it with strawberries!  Everyone begs me to bake them a cheesecake!

I added a little vanilla and fresh squeezed lemon juice to taste.  A few comments from my friends were…” it’s much tastier than Cheesecake Factory” and “this is the tastiest cheese cake I ever had”.  Well this recipe sure made me and my family happy:)

To me this is the way cheesecake should be.  It is firm, but melts in your mouth.  My Grandmother found a recipe quite similar to this in the Better Homes and Gardens magazine many years ago, and we have loved it ever since.  It was topped with a fresh strawberry glaze.  So delicious!!

Since I didn't have a 10-inch cake pan and only my 9-inch springform, I decided to halve the recipe. (the volume of a 10-inch is roughly double that of a 9-inch) Call me foolish, but it turned out wonderful.   I didn't make any adjustments to the baking time, but looking back, I think I should have. Nonetheless, the cheesecake came out perfect, just a bit more flatter compared to the pictures (maybe I should have made more filling). I left in the oven for an hour after it was baked before placing it in the fridge. Surprisingly, the cheesecake tastes better two or three days after it's been baked. The crust gets less flaky and much more... moist and the taste sort of melds into the cheese. Delightful!

Delish! I used this recipe to make mini cheesecakes and they came out great.  Just change the cook time to 20 min.

At first I was so scared to do this recipe eventhough it seemed easy.  I thought making a cheesecake was so hard but its the easiest thing I have done.  If you follow step by step, it will come out perfect.  I promise!!!  The first time I did this recipe I had enough to make two.  So I did one with the crust you make(the one indicated in this recipe) and one with the crust you buy already made.  I didnt like the homemade crust because it tasted so doughy.  I found it incredibly delicious the one you buy in the supermarket.  Make sure you use the BAR cream cheese otherwise if you dont it would not come out so creamy and rich in texture.  Made that mistake once!!! One important tip is to leave the cheesecake in the oven for an hour when you finish baking.  The warmth of the oven will give the cheesecake that extra touch.  I have been looking for this creamy,delicious cheesecake in every bakery. I would buy one but never could find it the way I wanted it.  I was amazed, I tell you amazed at the results.  I made this for New Years and many people told me " You need to give me your recipe"  If they only knew that its in allrecipe.com. LOL.  Good Luck and follow everything step by step and your results are going to be excellent.

very creamy and rich. I did a graham cracker crust instead because I just thought it was easier than having to deal with dough.

This is by far the BEST cheesecake EVER! I change it up a bit... I pre-mixed the cream cheese (always a good idea) then added the other ingredients. I added about 1 tsp of vanilla as well as I added 1 package of melted white chocolate chips. I did bake it at the suggested times but increased the temp to about 210-215 degrees. It does look like it's not baked at all in the center, but it will firm up after being in the frige over night. I also did not use a water bath and it turned out perfect! For the topping, I made a raspberry sauce, 2 half pints of fresh raspberries + 1 cup sugar. Mash together and drain in cheesecloth to separate the seeds. I cooked it on the stove at med/low heat and added about 1/2 cup more sugar.  The sauce will thicken a bit, but not as thick as gravy. Remove from heat and add another half pint or two of fresh raspberris. I used it to top each individual piece.  DELISHHH!

I am fairly new to cooking and this was the first time I tried making a cheesecake (I didn't even know what a springform pan was before I read this).  I didn't mix the cream cheese well enough so it came out a little bit lumpy and the center was a little runny, but otherwise it came out great and I was really impressed.  It was really easy.  The crust came out really good, but was a little thick.  I will be making this again very soon.

oh my goodness, this was fantastic!  I made it for my boyfriend's birthday and it was also my first cheesecake experiment so I was very hopeful it would turn out well.  
the crust was supertasty but mild enough to let the cheesecake flavor shine through.  the cake itself is creamy and rich, my only addition was a little vanilla, which lent a subtle flavor to the cream cheese-iness.  I did beat the cream cheese before any other additions to make it soft and lump free.  then I followed the order laid out in the recipe.  
next time, I might try the suggestion of subbing sour cream for the heavy cream, just to see if there's a difference in tanginess.  also use the largest mixing bowl you have, mine was spilling out of my large batter bowl and that made it hard to get all of the lumps out; although the few lumps that were left did not hinder the flavor or texture!  I also ended up leaving it in the oven for 50 minutes after baking (instead of the full hour) as I was pressed for time and it still turned out beautifully.  
I served with strawberries and whipped cream although it is equally good just plain!  if you're looking for a special dessert, you have to try this recipe!

This was my first time making a cheesecake and I could not believe how simple it was. It turned out perfectly! I used all organic ingredients and made a side dish of topping with strawberries cooked in a little water and sugar and thickened with cornstarch for those who wanted it. No one could resist it and the cheesecake connosieurs were delighted. I've made two more since then and it turns out perfectly every time. One important note however: I didn't use egg in the shortbread base the first time and it was excellent. When I used the second time the base was more "cakey" and so I have reverted to the shortbread base without egg. It's unbeatable!

Tried this recipe for the first time and I can truly say it was the best cheesecake recipe to date. I'm not quite sure about the crust but I may play around with the ingredients on my next attempt. As far as the filling and baking instructions go there are no good reasons to change or tweak the original.

i follwed the recipe.  i read the other reviews but to perfect it a "tad" more.  i lined my spring form pan with parchment paper.  i also pre-heated my oven with a water bath.  i followed the oven cooling methond **perfect outcome!** after the cooling, i made a sour cream topping (1 cup sour cream, 1 tblspn of sugar, & 1/4 vanilla: stir until well blended. spread on top of cooled cheesecake)  i won't use another cheesecake recipe after i tried this one!  Thanks

Easy to make, I didn't use a water bath, the recipe doesn't mention doing it, so I didn't. No problems at all. Follow the directions to the letter, and you will have a beautiful cheesecake. I added a tsp. of vanilla like one reviewer said. This cake is very rich, I let my guests have a choice between cherry or blueberry topping. They all raved about how good this was. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made this cheesecake last night to bring into work for a co-worker who is leaving our office. I thought for sure this would not come out good since I never made a cheesecake before.  When I went to buy the cream cheese, the store did not have enough of the block cream cheese - they only had the whipped version.  So I took a chance and bought the whipped cream cheese.  It was very easy to mix (it is already soft), but I think that the very big crack in the cheesecake was due to using whipped cream cheese.  BUT the cheesecake was still delicious.  Everyone raved about it.  I did make an error right off the bat and forgot to beat the egg before putting in the crust mixture, but it still came out fine.  Based on some of the reviews I added a little cinnamon and vanilla to the crust mixture.  I served the cheesecake with 2 different toppings, canned cherry pie filling and crushed oreos.  I left the toppings on the side so everyone could decide for themselves if they wanted topping or not.  I recommend having a cup of hot water to dip the knife in when cutting the cheesecake because it really sticks to the knife.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Can't wait to make it again and try to make one with no cracks!!  Total cost to make the cake:  $13.75 (with toppings).

Following the recipe exactly (creaming the cream cheese, not overbeating the other ingredients, and never opening the oven for the 2hrs and 10 minutes it's in there) made it turn out perfect! my first try it was delicious--perfect rich texture, great flavor and no cracks even! :) Mmmmm. Everyone loved it

Hands down the best cheesecake recipe I've ever used. Incredibly dense and rich. I made this for Mother's Day, and it was a hit. Everyone was very impressed. I decided only to line the bottom of the pan with the shortdough crust (personal preference), and used the left over dough to make jam tarts.

This is an excellent recipe. I live in Germany so I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for Graham Crackers, as they don't exist here. I was not disappointed. The cheese cake turned out scrumptions!

Thanks in large part to the simplicity of this fantastic recipe, my first cheesecake endeavor was a smashing success! I've made this 2x now and though both cracked, I couldn't be happier with the outcome. In fact, I think the cracks add character ;) That said one of these was taken to work at the request of a co-worker and in order to sort of camaflouge the cracks I topped the cheesecake with crushed butterfinger candy bars. Tasty! Very good recipe followed exactly as written. Thank you!

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake and it came out perfectly! Well...except for the gigantic crack down the center, but I'm ok with that!! Tasted great, though I'm not real sure about the crust. I think next time I make it I will do a thin layer of grahams. I made a strawberry glaze topping to put over it, and we all loved it. I think it would be great without the sauce too.

This is the first time I made a cheesecake and my wife is a cheesecake lover.  I added Baileys to the mixture with the heavy cream.  Just before serving I drizzled some Baileys on the top then added crushed cashews and whipped cream. 
My wife said it was the best cheesecake she had ever had.
Thank you so much for this recipe!

Mmmmmmmmm, so thick and creamy.... Just for a moment, i thought it wouldn't come out well 'cause it seemed to be liquid in the center. I had to cook it a little longer and left it inside the oven after done (as the recipe says)...perfect!!! ;)

This is amazing. Exactly what I was looking for, creamy, rich, dense, not too sweet. I've made it for a party I'm having tonight and I made in a 13x9 pan. I've cut the cheesecake into squares and am garnishing them with chocolate dipped strawberry halves.

I got rave reviews from colleagues at work. I made an Oreo base (1 packet) and added Oreo cookies (1 packet) into the filling and turned it into an Oreo Cheesecake! I halved the recipe and it fits well in an 8" round springform pan. However, the top browned too fast at 225 C for the first 10 minutes, so I will reduce the temperature the next time. Nevertheless, the texture is great!

Excellent recipe! (I had to make it in a smaller pan so I threw the extra batter in a muffin tin and came out with 12 yummy mini-cheesecakes as well.) Make sure to make a thin crust...I made it too thick and the crust was quite heavy. Overall a fantastic cheesecake!!

A thick, rich and creamy cheesecake! Absolutely perfect. This was my second attempt at a cheesecake since my first attempt (different recipe) cracked like crazy. This cake turned out perfectly and I got so many amazing compliments. Make absolutely sure you bake as recommended in the recipe.

Terrific cheesecake, Sandy! This was one of the desserts I fixed for a recent family reunion. I made four cakes: two with 2T lemon juice added, and two with vanilla added. I also made a raspberry sauce from this site to serve over it. On the cakes with vanilla in them, I simply mixed a cup of sour cream with 1t sugar and 1t vanilla, spread the mixture over the cakes during the last ten minutes of baking time. They were scarfed up in a hurry!

This is by far the best cheesecake I have ever tasted.  When my friends find out I have made this cheesecake, they make a special effort to drop by! It is excellent and very easy.

I had the same result as a few other reviewers. The flavor was very good, perfect you could say...but following the recipe, however, left this poor cheesecake a little too soft in the middle. It did not retain form when a slice was cut out. The second attempt was a smash hit: Shoot for 2 hours at 200 degrees, then turn the oven off and let sit for an hour in the oven before cooling overnight.

I made this for my husband for father's day and I'm about to make it again for his birthday.  Follow the recipe exactly as written-- leave it in the oven for an hour and then fridge overnight.  It was perfect!  Honestly, I've made tons of cheesecakes through the years (it's my husband's favorite), and this was the best one I've ever made.

I think that people may be MISREADING the ingredients list and using 2.5 PACKAGES of cream cheese and not 2.5 POUNDS....which will inevitably result in  an eggy mess. This is an easy recipe that is fairly fool proof IF one reads the directions and ingredients correctly. Also, test your ovens with a thermometer to make sure they are at the temperatures required! My previous oven was a full 45 degrees off from what the dial said, so I adjusted accordingly.

This is a fantastic cheesecake recipe as written. I only had 3, 250 gram packages of creamcheese in my fridge when I started out to make this for the first time. I took a chance and used a 475 gram tub of mascarpone in place of the 500 grams of creamcheese I was short of (thats right folks, this recipe needs 2 and 1/2 lbs. of cheese, NOT 2 and 1/2 packages). Dang!!!silky,smooth,rich deliciousness!! A wee splash of vanilla, Greek sour cream in place of the heavy cream, and I swear on all that is holy, that it was the best cheesecake I have ever tasted!! Oh,and by the way,make sure you chill it over night or you wont get the smooth texture and well developed flavors we look for in a good cheesecake.Enjoy, I sure did!!

I've made this recipe many times - it has become my go-to recipe for cheesecake.  I prefer graham cracker or oreo crusts, but this filling is wonderfully dense and rich.  My co-workers and family rave over my cheesecake every time I use this recipe for the batter.  Thanks!

Yep, Sandy is right.  This is the definitive cheesecake recipe.  It is seriously perfect, just as written, for a basic recipe.  I made it just as written the first time and my 5 stars are based on that.  However, for my personal taste, I'm adding a bit of vanilla and I made a graham cracker crust for it this time (2nd time), but I have never tried a cheesecake recipe that turned out so beautifully and I think I have tried every one out there.  Thank goodness this one doesn't require a water bath!  My oven only goes as low as 250F, so I just baked it for about 52 minutes on 250F instead of 60 on 200F.  It turned out great!  Thank you so much for sharing this Sandy!!

Update:  I figured out why mine cracked twice and just wanted to share this.  If you do the crust flat, the cheesecake will crack.  If you squish the crust up the side of the pan, the cake seems to lean inwards when it is cooling, just enough to keep the cake from cracking.  This is the most awesome cheesecake recipe ever.  Thank you!!

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out awesome...no cracks! First time making cheesecake and impressed everyone. I was just careful when preparing the cream cheese. I creamed the cheese first mixing in the sugar so it's well incorporated and added the eggs one by one. The cake is definitely better the day after. Next time I will add some sour cream for the tangy flavour. And experiment with some oreo cookies for the crust.

I followed the recipe to the TEE and let it sit in the fridge overnight. The next afternoon I was hoping to dig into some delicious cheesecake, but was extremely let down! This was much too egg-y; I'm not even sure the eggs were cooked all of the way because I'm almost certain that it's what led to my young daughter's stomach ache. I even cooked it longer than required! The cheesecake was not jiggly but the inside was pure cream and egg-y ness.

This cheesecake was so good!  I changed the crust recipe because I had to make it gluten free.  I didn't care for the way the crust turned out so I think next time I will just make it without a crust.  I followed the directions for mixing except I beat the cream cheese until smooth, added the sugar and flour and mixed and lastly added the eggs and half and half (I didn't have heavy cream on hand).

We had it for dessert after it had been in the fridge for about 6 hours.  It was a bit runny in the center but nobody cared!  It was SO delicious.  I put it back in the fridge and this morning it was absolutely perfect!  So, leaving in the fridge overnight is crucial (like the recipe stated).  

I also lined the bottom of the springform pan with parchment paper and buttered the paper and sides.  

After it sat in the over for an hour, I did run the knife around the edges before putting it in the fridge and the cake did not crack.

I thought about adding vanilla and I am SO glad I didn't.  The flavor really is just perfect without the vanilla.  

I plan to make this again next week without the crust.  Or, I may find another crust to use.  I just know that whenever my family eats cheesecake, the crust is what is always left on the plate.  

Thanks for this beautiful cake!

love the sugar cookie dough crust like thing...nice3 and buttery...however, i can not for the life of me figure out what i am doing wrong that leaves my cakes runny.  could it possibly be the oven is off?  made this cake twice now...second was a tad more solid than the first one i made for thanksgiving...my partner is a cheesecake addict, and i guess i am the enabler...and he loves the cheese cake to be as dense as possible....gotta try this one one more time...third time better be atleast a bunt...

WOW!! This is SO good and so creamy. It's definitely the closest recipe to New York deli cheesecake that I've ever tried.  My husband bragged all over this cheesecake!  I couldn't believe the top didn't crack; it was perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated (using a 9X13 pan since I don't own a springform) and the only problem I had was getting the crust pressed in evenly (it ended up too thick in the corners and too thin at the top), so next time I am going to use graham crackers. By the way, I had a little filling leftover so I made a few individual cheesecakes in muffin tins. The only thing I could find to use as a crust was a pack of mini Chips Ahoy cookies, so I crushed them and lined the bottom of the muffin tins with them...and those ended up being the BEST mini cheesecakes ever.  Thanks for the great recipe!

this cheesecake is VERY tastey! First try at a cheesecake and not a single crack or bubble problem. I followed another reviewer and did half chocolate half white. I also used a water bath AND left the oven off and closed for a good 3 hours. BEFORE mixing chocolate into half the dough, i took the whole bowl and rammed it against the floor about 20-30 times. you will begin to see the little bubbles come to the top and pop out of your batter.  For cook time, i did 475 for 10 minutes, then 350 for 30 and then 200 for 30 min. it was still too soft in the middle (couldn't cut it properly) so next time i will leave it at 350 i think.

This is by far the best cheesecake I have ever made!! There is nothing I would change except, I leave it in the oven an extra 15 minutes at the end to help it firm up, and I add the juice of 1 lemon and 1 tsp of vanilla to the batter.  It is amazing!! The crust is so unusual and an interesting twist on a great cheesecake!! I would recommend this to any cheesecake lover!! I brought this to a party, and everyone has been asking for it ever since.  It is a hit! Thanks Sandy!!

I have now made this Cheesecake recipe 3 times now, each time has gotten better, but from the beginning it was rich and creamy and so far everyone has loved it! Now I can not have wheat or anything with gluten in it. So just to let anyone know this cake can easily be made GLUTEN FREE!! When ever it calls for flour just add GF flour instead with about a tablespoon or so of xanthan gum and it work beautiful. You and your guest will not even know it is gluten free cheesecake! it is so wonderful! I am making my own wedding cake from this recipe if that help tell you how wonderful it is!  ENJOY!

I made this just as the recipe instructed and everyone loved it! Don't be afraid to let it sit in the fridge for a day or two - it gets better each day. Perfect!

I read reviews before making this and decided to go with a graham cracker crust. This was also my first time at a homemade cheesecake and it was AMAZING! This recipe is great and easy to follow! I also used 2 fat free and 3 regular cream cheeses so it was slightly low fat. It still tasted great!!!

Very, very good cheesecake. But I need to figure out how to prevent splitting. Also, the volume of batter created in this recipe does not fit into a standard cheescake pan. I had to make a few mini cheesecakes in addition to the big one in order to use it all up.

Very good cheesecake and this was my first time making one.  After reading the reviews, I decided to make a few changes based on what I had read.  Used slightly less than 1/4 cup of heavy cream and then added 1/4 cup of sour cream which I added with the eggs at the very end (to not overbeat and add too much air). I also added a little sweet lemon with some zest and some vanilla to the creamed mixture.  When making the crust I used a heaping 1/3 cup of sugar (a little more than stated) plus a dash of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla in the crust. I baked the crust for only 12 minutes.  It came out great.  Glad I didn't opt to use a graham cracker crust. I did have one small crack.  Not sure why, but it didn't look too bad and the taste was great. Based on the reviews, I decided to bake at 215 and I left it in about 10 minutes longer. Since it was my boyfriends bday, I wanted to make it extra special.  I used some of Costco frozen berry blend to make a nice sauce.  First I made a simple sugar sauce on the stove.  Then added a big handful of thawed berries.  Smashed them in the simple sugar sauce with a potato masher.  Added some of my moms homemade grape jelly.  Cooked a little longer before adding some cornstarch that I mixed with cold water.  Cooked until thick.  Added more mixed berries to this mixture before putting in the fridge to chill.  I put this on top of the cheesecake and then a dollop of homemade whipped cream.  Yummo!  Looked like a professional dessert!

This was my first cheesecake. It came out great. Aftre careful speculation of many differnt recipes, I used this one with few, but important variations. I baked my cheesecake at 325 for approx. one hour. Then, i let it cool with the oven door ajar for approx. two and a half hours before putting it in the fridge and chilling overnight. I also brushed my pan with butter, the sides slipped away perfectly, I didn't even have to go around with a knife. I also chose to use a water bath. I love the texture of the cheesecake, and it was delish, my family coud not stop raving. Overall, good recipe, but my advice is read the articles that have already been posted on how to make and bake a cheesecake, and check out other recipes a well.

All the previous comments about the crust are correct -- make a graham cracker crust.  My first attempt was a flawless, golden, dense cheesecake on a dry, hard, cardboard tasting crust.

My second attempt, I used 6 eggs instead of 5 eggs and 2 extra yolks.  DO NOT DO THIS.  The yolks are essential in binding the cheesecake together.  While it was still tasty, the result was much lighter, fluffier and only barely held together.

I was happy about not having to use a water bath and it came out absolutely perfect, no cracks! With the exception of adding vanilla, I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I would do differently next time is cook it just a little longer. I found that in the center it was still just a bit runny. But no one noticed because I just didn't cut the rest of the pieces that far into the center. Everyone raved about it and didn't believe I made it!

I did everything wrong, and mine didn't crack.  I did not use a water bath, I opened the oven 5 or 6 times checking my thermometer, and I beat the heck out of the batter after adding eggs.  In fact, I beat the cream cheese, then added the eggs one by one beating thoroughly after each addition to make sure they were well mixed in, then I proceeded with the rest of the batter recipe.  After I poured the batter over the crust I thumped the pan several times on the counter to remove air bubbles before putting it into the oven.

The only change I made was to add 1/4 cup sour cream.  I did not reduce or delete any other ingredients.

This does have an eggy flavor.  I will add vanilla and a bit of lemon juice to the batter next time to correct that.  Also, several reviews say it's even better after 48 hours in the refrigerator, so I'm anxious to see if the tangier flavors develop and cover the egg by tomorrow.   Update after 48 hours in the refrigerator:  The eggy flavor has all but gone today.  It still could use just a bit of vanilla and a couple tsp of lemon juice for a little more tanginess.

gotta tell you, for the first time (and I make cheesecakes for every holiday & family occasion for years) this is the only cheesecake that was like wet goo in the middle.  I followed the instructions to a "t" and was furious when my beautiful looking cheesecake was cut into & was an uncooked gooey mess in the middle...I was mortified.  I will say that overall this was a dissappointing flop but the cooked pieces from the edge that I could get a taste of tasted really good so I can tell this had potential.  I will attempt this recipe again but perhaps do something different with the temperatures.  Good luck to everyone else.

Truly a dense, NY deli cheesecake.  Lots of reviews debate the need for a water bath.  Water baths are typically used for delicate egg-based desserts that might curdle due to high heat.  It's my experience with this recipe that a water bath isn't needed, perhaps because it's so dense and/or the heat is pretty low.   Also, be absolutely sure to let the cheesecake settle for hours before serving; the time is needed for the dessert to become firm.  Lastly, consider adding the Supreme Strawberry topping recipe.

I've never made a cheesecake before and honestly my cooking skills are lacking experience but I DO know how to follow a recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't turn out so well.  I used a 9x13 pan instead of the 10'' springform pan because I wasn't sure what that was and was certain I didn't have one. (But the recipe says you can use a 9x13) I made the crust and seemed to turn out nice in the beginning.  I baked the cheesecake, following the directions about turning the oven down, etc.  I didn't open the oven a single time and my cheesecake had huge cracks in it (that wasn't supposed to happen, especially since I didn't open the oven)  Also, When i went to serve it the crust was burnt on the bottom and wouldn't come out of the pan even though I sprayed it with cooking oil spray as directed in the recipe.  Don't get me wrong, it tasted good but the presentation wasn't good at all so I'm glad I gave it a trial run before making one to take to Thanksgiving dinner with the family.  I guess next time I would try using shortening to grease the pan and not bake the crust first/seperately.  I would do it all at the same time since the crust was very burnt.

THE BEST!!!  Made a couple adjustments as recommended on this site.  Changed out the heavy cream for sour cream and added 1 T. vanilla.  I also switched 3/4 C of the sugar to Splenda and all the sugar in the shortbread crust to Splenda.  Even hubby and the kids couldn't tell the difference!!  Just the most perfect cheesecake ever!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

FABULOUS... to say the least. If you like REAL cheesecake... the kind you can stick a metal fork and... and it be able to stand up straight... THIS IS THE ONE! My pan was a sort of bundt pan so my slices came out square.. but I kinda liked that affect. This is my first attempt at cheesecake, heck, my first attempt at baking something that didnt come out of a box. I was rich, thick, and flavorful. Im sure it is yummy as is, but based on others reviews and my own personal taste I added: 1 tablespoon vanilla, 1 tablespoon sour cream, and 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice. My mom still prefers the graham cracker crusts but I loved the shortbread. It is the purists crust to me, and really let the cheesecake shine. I am so happy that I found this recipe, Im thinkin of selling customized cheesecakes for Christmas based on this recipe.. it is DELIGHTFUL! Very important tip: Do not open the oven for the full two hours! I didnt have one crack! This IS New York Cheesecake... and yes, you can make it too.

I only used the base of this recipe as I was making an unbaked cheesecake. Let me tell you, the base in great! I will be using it in slice recipes because it would be perfect in them. I added a bit more butter and did the whole thing in my food processor and took out the dough just when the dough started to come together in a big ball. I softened a block of frozen butter in the microwave, until still cool, but soft. I also baked this crust for 20 mins, mainly because when I checked at 15 mins, the middle still had slightly wet parts. Fantastic crust!

Flavor was 5 stars without a doubt.  I do however highly suggest using a water bake; Although other users had luck without it, mine came out cracked, and brown on top and around the sides.  I would also suggest a different crust or using 3/4ths of the dough rather than all of it, not because it was bad, but because there are tastier options (one user suggested chocolate graham cracker crust).  Cooling over night is most definately a must.  Just in terms of flavor... YUM.  I wanted it when I woke up in the morning for as long as it lasted in the fridge (which wasn't long since the entire family kept sneaking slices).

This recipe never fails me! Everytime I bake it I get asked to make it for another occasion. And some people offer to pay me for one. I've lost count of how many i've made.
It's so good with fresh strawberries on top!
The changes I make:
I use a graham cracker crust. 
I add vanilla extract. 
And I bake it in a waterbath.

Very good cheesecake. I increased the recipe to approximately 24 servings to fill a 12" cake pan (use parchment paper so it doesn't stick). The cheesecake ended up almost 2 inches thick. I also followed other reviews/suggestions like having a big pan of very hot water in the oven with it and skipping the 10 minutes at 475 and instead baking at 200 for 3 hours, 10 minutes. Since I had it in a 12" pan I left it in for 3 hours and 40 minutes. Then turned the oven off and opened the oven door slightly and left it in there for 2 more hours. After it was fully cooled I covered it and placed it in the fridge for about 24 hours. Note: For the crust I used 26 finely crushed Oreo cookies mixed with 4 T. melted unsalted butter, baked at 400 for 10 minutes before filling.//Getting it from the cake pan to the cake stand was tricky--lots of flipping and parchment paper involved. Fortunately it didn't crack!! Everyone was very happy with it.

It is a very good recipe, I bake the crust 10 minutes at 375 degrees because if you don't the crust will be to done, I use a water bath also and it comes out very creamy and just set in the center, do not skip process of letting it sit in over with the heat off. Wonderfull recipe, I make a homemade strawberry sauce, just puree strawberries in a blender with a little sugar, serve with sauce and fresh ripe strawberry's.

Love this recipe.  I have been using it for about 3 years or so, and it always comes out great.  Everytime I make it, I get rave reviews and it's devoured.  I've even had people offer to pay me to make it for their parties!  Wanted to share a few things I've learned over the years.  1) Use dental floss to make the initial cuts.  If your crust is thinner, it will even cut the crust.  Then, completely clean your knife between cuts (pain in the rear but worth it)  2) Like others, I only use 1/2-2/3 of the crust on the bottom.  3) I didn't have heavy cream or sour cream once, cooked it without & it turned out just fine.  I'm a sucker for just plain, thich & creamy cheesecake but I think a little vanilla or lemon zest would be good.  This is truly the best recipe ever.  It's very forgiving, easy to make and everyone will be extremely impressed.

this is the best.hands down..i substituted with 1/3 cup of sour cream instead of hvy cream. i used 1 tsp of vanilla and 2 tsp of tru-lemon for flavoring.i made the crust mixture but i decided to only fill the bottom of the 10 in. spring form.so. i divided the dough in fourths and used 3 of the fourths.the next cheesecake i make tomorrow im going to try to use only two.in other words, half the recipe for crust.but ,since im on a roll, i just may make 2 cheesecakes tomorrow since i'll have extra dough for it. believe me this cheesecake doesnt stick around in the fridge too long!excellent!i did have a crack ,but not till the very end of the cooling process.but for cheesecake bakers we all know this is not uncommon.if you slice it right ,no one needs to ever know.right?

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would!  This cheesecake was delicious.  I only made two changes: I added 1 t of vanilla extract, and I used 1 cup of sour cream instead of the whipping cream.  Mine did not crack at all.  It was beautiful.  The only problem I had was getting the crust to stay on the sides.  When I baked my crust, the sides slid down and burned.  I just went around the pan and cut the sides off.  I was scared that it would look funny once it was all done, but it didn't. Therefore, the next time I will just put the shortdough crust on the bottom and not the sides.  I had a bowl of once frozen strawberry sauce on the side.  Whenever I bake a cheesecake, I never use a bain marie.  I just place a pan of water on the rack directly beneath my cheesecake.  The shortdough crust is so much better than the graham cracker crust.  In addition to the above, I only beat my cream cheese and sugar,everything else I mix by hand.  I do this so that I won't overmix my batter.  If you are looking for the perfect cheesecake recipe, look no longer.  You found it!

This cheesecake is fantastic!  I only had a 9" pan so I increased my baking time at 200 for another hour and I did only place the crust on the bottom of the pan.  Next time I will put a circle of parchment paper on the bottom because even though I oiled the bottom, it stuck. The flavor and texture were restraunt quality, and I had several tell me it was the best cheesecake they had ever had!  Thank you for the recipe!

I've made this twice now and both of them cracked!  The taste of this is wonderful, so  if I could avoid the cracks it would be perfect. I was upset about my first attempt because the middle did not cook.  I had read a few reviews that also say the same thing.  I believe the problem was because I used an 8" pan, not a 10". When I used the proper size pan, the middle was fine.

Excellent recipe.. Looks like it was made in a bakery and no cracks!! You definately have to make sure that cream cheese is soft and don't mix with a beater.  I just used a spatula,it may take longer to mix than a beater, but this way you can make sure you don't overbeat it and incorporate air into the mixture. This recipe is a keeper.

I felt like I needed to extend the cooking time.  I let it bake for 3 hours instead of 2 at 200 degrees.  I like to see the internal temp of the cheesecake reach 160 degrees and it only got to 140 with the recipe's bake time.

This is the absolute best base for a cheesecake.  Similar to McCall's Ultimate Cheesecake which happens to be my favorite.  I love the shortdough crust, but a graham craker or vanilla wafer crust is a quick and excellent substitute.  I'd suggest adding a teaspoon of lemon zest and a half teaspoon of orange zest to the batter. So worth it.  Definetly chill the cake overnight then add a coating of sour cream to the top and a fruit puree. Saw saradipity's berry photo and can only imagine how awesome that would be with the lemon zest in the batter. Hmmm, I just decided my Easter dessert. I rated this a 5 based on the ingredients, I haven't tried this particular recipe that was submitted, but I've made the McCall's version before. I'd suggest a pan of hot water in the lower rack of the oven when baking this to avoid cracks.  Awesome.

I gave it four stars because of the fact that it was really good but the way I followed the instructions made me burn the cheesecake. Next time I will drop the temperature by at least 50 degrees so that it will not burn. Despite being burned it was still really good!! So now it's cheesecake cajun style!

I made this for a friend's birthday party, and it was a hit.  One of they guys took home what was left over - it was pretty funny.  So rich and smooth.  It did crack slightly, but, honestly, you're just going to eat it.  The crust was soooo good, a lot of people commented on it.  This is definitely one of the best cheesecakes I've ever made!

Great cheesecake- loved the smooth, creamy texture and flavor!  I stirred in a bag of Heath toffee bits, and served with Praline Sundae Topping from this site.  Added some vanilla to the batter.  The crust was good- a nice change from graham crackers.  I only had a 9 inch pan so I put some of the batter into a mini-cheesecake pan and made 3 cheesecake "muffins".  I used part Neufchatel cheese and didn't have any cream, so I used 1% milk.  My cheesecake cracked all over the place, but they were small.  That's probably my fault though, and I don't mind.  Good Thanksgiving dessert!

Just okay...I did everything like it said, but I didn't love the flavor, was looking for something more.  Consistency was great, perfect.  Didn't love the crust, would probably do graham cracker one like others have said.  I don't think I will make again.

I'm always looking for a better cheesecake recipe to use.  This recipe is simply the best.  I like a heavy, creamy cheesecake- so, the more cream cheese the better.  This recipe is simple to make and I like the use of heavy whipping cream rather than sour cream.  I did not use the recipe for the crust.  I simply just spray the springform pan with Pam and put a light coating of graham cracker crumbs.  I do not like a thick crust with my cheesecakes.  The cheesecake came out perfectly the first time I made it- no cracks and extremely creamy.  I will use this recipe from now on.  I usually use my main cheesecake recipe to make adaptations such as pumpkin or chocolate cheesecakes.

PERFECT!  This was thick and creamy and had the best flavor.  I've been making cheesecake for years and always get rave reviews, this one topped my best and is now my "new best"!  I did do a sour cream/sugar layer on top after it cooled, ahhhh perfection!  I also put a water bath in for the first portion of cooking, not one crack in this baby!

This made one awesome cheesecake. It got rave reviews. I baked it in a 9x13 inch pan and used a graham cracker crust.  Based on another review, I did not open the oven while baking. NO CRACKS at all.  Also, based on another review, I used a teaspoon of vanilla. It was very rich, dense, and creamy. Thank you!!

Holy mackeral!  This was just an awesome, easy cheesecake!  I used a  11 x 13 glass baking dish and added an extra cream cheese, and an extra 1/8 cup of sugar.  This filled the dish, made it very thick and firm.  I got rave reviews from my family, my son and his college friends.  I cannot tell you how incredibly easy this is!  You MUST make it ahead and let refrigerate.

i read everyone else's reviews and can't figure out exactly where i went wrong.  i had a grand -canyon type crack in the middle, the shortbread crust was too dry and worst of all, the whole thing turned out extremely lumpy.  i tried to beat the lumps out of the batter with my kitchen aid mixer, but i was worried about beating too much air in.  so i poured the lumpy batter on top of the crispy crust and hoped that the heat from baking would melt the lumps out.  didn't work.  i did use neufchatel cheese. did that ruin it?  help!

I was attracted to this recipe because it doesn't use a graham cracker crust. I used the crust in another cheesecake recipe and I thought it was so much better than boring old graham crackers. This makes one thick crust that won't get soggy.

The first time I made this was for Thanksgiving and my family warily tried a sample of it. To their amazement, it was exceptionally good and they kept coming back for more (and so did I). I followed the recipe almost to the letter, except like most of the others I added a little bit of vanilla. I think my only problem was that I didn't quite let the cream cheese soften enough but it still came out fine in the end. I baked it in a 9x11 baking dish in a shallow water bath and it came out perfectly. And the crust complimented the cheesecake very well.

This really is the best cheesecake.  Love the crust.  Mine didn't crack and I think it has to do with the amount of beating.  The more air the more likely it is to crack.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.  It was exactly what I was looking for.

Excellent! I made this as a thank you to a co-worker. What a wonderful response! I used fresh strawberries to top it off, and a graham crust. I also added a bit of Vanilla. Now, I will have to make one for home!

this cheesecake is the easiest to make!!! Although it does take time to bake, it is not difficult at all. I used a chocolate graham cracker crust. It more time to make the crust than to make the cheesecake batter. I added a water bath for extra protection against cracking. very rich and dense, a little goes a long way. My boyfriend is finishing off this cake AND asked for this on thanksgiving and for his birthday--and the dates are less than a month apart! his mother even asked for a second serving, and she NEVER asks for more. I will be making 5 more before thankgiving because it was such a huge hit and it is a keeper...next I want to try it on a friend who is from New York...will tell how it goes...

I prepared the recipe exactly as stated, however, it did not turn out as expected. The crust pulled away from the pan causing the batter to drip out of the springform pan.  When baking it for the first ten minutes the top browned to quickly and caused an unsightly mess.  I was also not prepared for the lumps that were in the batter and kept trying to get them out before baking.

I'm a first time cheesecake baker and this turned out perfectly! Like, everyone was SHOCKED that I  pulled it off, perfectly. I took the advice of others and did the following in addition to following the recipe exactly:
*eggs and cream cheese both at room temperature 
*add a tsp of vanilla
*cream everything first really well, then add the eggs very slowly, one at a time
*grease the sides of the pan again before adding filling 
*tap the pan firmly to raise air bubbles and then let it sit for a few minutes
*use a water bath...a 13x9 pan half full of water on the bottom rack

I topped with caramel and toffee bits.

I love this recipe. By request from friends and family I've made this cheesecake every holiday season thanksgiving and Christmas and even for holiday parties at work. I make at least 4 a year. It's dense but not a rich flavor. Which is perfect! I've even made non-cheesecake lovers into cheesecake addicts after they've tried my cheesecake one time. Where I thought I could never make this type of cake, this recipe is simple and simply enjoyable.

I love this recipe and had made it for years with no issues but when I bought my new oven I couldn't get this recipe to turn out any more. I kept getting a runny mess (4 times). However I was determined to keep trying to make it work and it finally did but it was because I left my 10" springform pan at my sisters house. Happy accident I guess because I went and used an 11" springform pan that I had and it came out absolutely perfect!!! I'm not sure if it is my oven or not but I just thought I'd mention it because several reviewers complain about getting a runny mess out of this recipe and it turned out to be a simple fix for me. This cheesecake is delicious and I follow the recipe to the letter. There are a few things I do while making mine that the recipe doesn't mention though. 1) I let all my refrigerated ingredients sit on the counter to warm up(including the eggs and cream) 2)I burp my cheesecake before baking it to get some of the air bubbles out. I tap the sides of the pan and pop the ones I can see with a skewer. 3) I chill this overnight uncovered. I used to cover mine with foil but it creates condensation and I would always inevitably end up having water on the top of my cake by morning. Uncovered it doesn't have that issue and makes it easy to top with powdered sugar which I sometimes like to do.

I really wanted to try this recipe but only had three 8 oz blocks of cream cheese and instead of a cheesecake pan I had a 10 inch round. I am happy to say that this recipe halves easily. Thankfully so because I've already had 2 and a half slices and could probably finish off a full sized cheesecake myself.

Absolutely fantastic recipe. This was the third cheesecake recipe from all recipes. The other two were OK. But, if like us, you're a NY style cheesecake fan, then this is definitely the recipe to keep. The shortbread cruset was a huge hit with everybody. My 10" springform couldn't hold all of the mix tho. Ended up with around a cup and a third overfill. But I also added 3/4 cup of homemade blubbery jam for a swirl that turned out great. I was dismayed at the large crack on the top, but luckily it was close to the end of the cook so it didn't dry out the center. Don't be alarmed by the jiggly center. After refrigeration my cake turned out exactly as I'd hoped.

I skip the heavy cream and extra egg yolks for an even denser cake, and sometimes add a tsp of vanilla. Otherwise this is the same as my recipe that has pleased a lot of friends and family over the years.
Thanks
P.S. Don't miss the 2.5 pounds (5 packages) part of the recipe or you will not get cheesecake, more like a custard I would imagine.

Delicious. I made this for Christmas and it was a hit. Very easy to make, great flavor. I topped with some homemade Peach preserves my aunt gave me and whipped cream. Oh my it was fabulous! I did skip the shortbread crust as it was late when I made it and well I was feeling lazy so I just made a graham cracker crust :)

This recipe has changed a bit since I last printed it about 1.5 years ago.  Still, it's a good base for a very creamy cheesecake (whether it's "New York", or otherwise...ehhhh...splitting hairs).  Here's what I do differently:  1. No flour crust.  I use "Nilla" wafers.  Mash them up.  1 cup will do, unless you like thicker crust.  2. No egg in the crust.  Just "Nilla" wafers, sugar, and 1/4 cup of butter.  It holds together well.  3. 2.5 pounds of cream cheese?  Don't confuse yourself.  5 regular packs is all you need.  4. 3 tbsp all purpose flour? Call it 1/8 cup.  Then, you're good to go.  I bake the cake for 5 minutes at about 375F (200C), then turn it down to about 210F (100C) until done.  (My own personal way of testing "doneness" is...grab a pot holder, and tap the side of the pan gently.  If you see "waves" across the cake, it isn't done.  If you have a small jiggle, it's done.  Close the door, shut off the oven, and let it sit for about 30 minutes.  Then, take it out so the pan cools to the touch.  As mentioned above, after the pan cools get it into the fridge overnight.  I've served this cake many times at work.  It has earned the title of "Absolutely Legendary".

This is my absolute favorite cheesecake recipe. A bit pricey with all the cream cheese, but the Golden Girls would be lucky to have a cheesecake this delicious. I usually prepare a couple of fruit compotes and a chocolate or caramel sauce to top the individual slices and let the guest choose their favorite.

This was amazing! Made a graham cracker crust (1/2 c butter, 1/3 c sugar, 1 1/2 c graham cracker crumbs - press in bottom of pan and bake 400 for 8 minutes). Came out with a few cracks but actually super easy to fix - heat a metal spatula in hot water and "weld" the cracks and smooth the top of the cake. OMG, this cake was sooo worth the effort!

This is THE CHEESECAKE recipe I have been searching for for years! How many different recipes I have tried! This one is THE ONE I will keep. Loved it.  I modified it a little-- didnt use 2 1/2 pds of cream cheese- used 2 pds and it was still plenty thick.  Also, only used 1 cup of sugar in the filling, added vanilla and did not add extra sugar to the crust.  It came out PERFECT. LOVED!! it!

This is a very creamy, delicious cheesecake! Very easy to make. Here are a couple hints:  I made one, which cracked. I decided to make another with this advice: after removing from the oven, run a knife along the edge of the springform pan- between the cake and the pan. It prevented it from cracking! I also discovered that the crust mixture needs to be mixed until it starts to pull together- like pie crust does. (That was my other mistake!)

This recipe was great. Delicious crust, super rich filling. I put a pan of water on the lower rack just to keep the moisture up in the oven. Not sure if it'll make or break the cheesecake, but it certainly doesn't hurt to minimize the cracks.

I topped it with strawberries and strawberry preserve to balance the rich texture.

I chose this recipe because of the shortbread crust, as I don't care for graham cracker. This is absolutely the best cheesecake I've ever tasted. I do add a tsp of vanilla but that's the only change I make to the recipe. Creamy and heavy but not so heavy that it feels like a lump in your stomach after eating a piece. This was the first cheesecake I've ever made and it's so easy. I've made it 4 times now and it's been amazing each time. Just make sure you let the cream cheese get to room temperature first and you should get good results each time...even if you overcook it. The very simple, Whipped Cream recipe from this site goes lovely with it also.

My first cheesecake turned out wonderful.  Just went to NYC and had cheesecake and this recipe is spot on!  I will definitely make this cheesecake again.  I accidentally added all of the egg and used 3lbs of cream cheese, still turned out great!

I used this recipe to make a NewYork cheesecake and I have to say,the consistency was just great. There were no cracks as I used a water bath and overall it was a good experience except for one problem.The recipe said to 'mix thoroughly' the cream cheese with the eggs,sugar and flour and then add cream and 'mix only enough to blend' Well,from what I could tell,this meant that I should just mix it with a non electric hand mixer and that's what I did. My question is,did I have to use an electric mixer? Because instead of tasting like a proper cheesecake,it tasted like a CREAM cheese yellow blob. I mean,I could not taste the sugar or anything,only the cream cheese. Since the reviews of this recipe are great,I assume that I did something wrong and I can only think of misinterpreting the mixing part wrong. Please help? Thanks!

This was my first cheesecake I have ever baked and it turned out beautiful!  I followed the recipe to a T except for the fact I did use a 9" springform so I did have to cook it a tad longer.  I have saved this recipe and I am looking forward to making it again soon.  A true 5 star recipe!

This was my first ever attempt at a cheesecake and I have to say, it came out pretty good. I added some vanilla extract like some other reviews had suggested. My only problems with it is that it's not completely set in the middle, it's more of a custard consistency there. Maybe it needed more baking time due to my particular oven. Also I found that it's a bit lumpy looking. I didn't want to over-mix but the lumps can take a hike! The taste is good though, and I love the short-dough crust which is a little different. I love crust, so I used the whole crust recipe and pulled some up the sides of the pan. I experienced no cracking either.

I made this several times and it ALWAYS comes out excellent! Everyone loves it and it gets eaten very fast! I follow the directions exactly, let it sit in the oven for at least one hour after I turned it off, then let it chill overnight in the fridge and never had any problems with cracking. Sometimes I use just 1/2 of the ingredients for the filling, to make a smaller cake (heightwise).

Great crust.  I only gave it 4 stars because it's good, but not as good as a cheesecake recipe I have called THE HEAVY ONE.

I think this recipe is amazing! This is my third time making cheesecake, my first was using a different recipe and turned out an absolute disaster! My second time, I used this recipe and the cheesecake was delicious! It was gone in a matter of 2 days! The only thing I would recommend to fellow newbie bakers is to make sure to not overbake this cheesecake! The cheesecake will still look undercooked, but it WILL firm up in the fridge! As an inexperienced baker, this easy recipe is a godsend. The ingredients were ones that I already had in the house, and right now, as i type this, I am baking this cheesecake in the oven. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Although the flavor was delicious, I was hoping for more of a fluffier texture.  The center never quite set even after waiting the recommended time and chilling over night and remained a custard-like consistency.

I have made this cheesecake twice and both times it came out perfect.  I had never baked a cheesecake prior to this recipe.. and I don't think I'll try another recipe after this one.  This is it :)

This is a good base recipe, and the cooking directions are spot on if you know what you are doing. I usually leave my cheesecake in the oven for three hours after baking, just to be safe, and then move it in to the fridge for the rest of the night. A little tip, even though I am sure someone else has said this. Instead of using a water bath to prevent cracks, place a baking sheet with water on the bottom rack and the cheesecake on the top rack of the oven. I gave this four stars because there isn't anything special about this recipe. I have tried many others that taste similar, also i thought it would be more dense by the description.

It is the best cheese cake recipe. I noticed that it turns out best if you use full fat cream cheese. I had some Neufchatel cheese and it cracked a little. Still wonderful tasting. I still recommend taking a cookie sheet with a little water in it and placing your springform pan in it if you want it extra creamy.

A great recipe! In Germany we usually use curd cheese for cheesecake and I wanted to try it the American way with cream cheese. It really makes a difference and I'll definitely stick to it. I added 1 tsp vanilla to both, the crust and the filling, but I add vanilla to almost everything I cook or bake. The temperatures/times didn't work for me, I had to leave the cake on a higher temperature (about 300 degrees F / 150 degrees C) for a  while longer (30 to 45 minutes) in the oven, but well, every oven is different! The result is a really delicious cake!

I made a different crust so this review is just for the cheesecake. I have been making cheesecake the same way for years and I decided to change it a little bit. This was so thick and creamy and delicious. The only change I made was adding a couple dashes of vanilla. I was told by many that it was one of my best plain cheesecakes ever!

This was a very disappointing recipe.  I read all of the great reviews and decided this was the one.  I did not change anything.  It was beautiful but not cooked all of the way. (it even says don't worry if it is jiggly)  Well worry. The crust was good.  I will stay with my old recipe but use this crust.

I can't understand all the great reviews.  I am a reasonably experienced cook, so although this was my first attempt at cheesecake, I expected better results.  The cheesecake cracked and caved and did all the things good cheesecake is not supposed to do.  Worst of all, both the crust and filling were flavorless.  I ended up throwing almost all of it away.  I do live at high altitude...maybe that is the problem?

First time I've ever made a cheesecake and it was an absolute success. The only slight criticism is the base, which came out chewy. When I make this again I would use less butter in the base mix.

Fantastic cheesecake with a great texture.  I added some flavorings that my family likes (scant 1/2 tsp lemon extract, 1/8 tsp vanilla) but I am sure it would still rate 5 stars in my book made according to the recipe.

My husband requested this recipe for Father's day and now asks for it every weekend. So delicious the family (6 adults and 2 children) finished it in one sitting. Maybe the only suggestion should be to double the recipe... Thanks

Im a cheesecake baking fanatic and just had to try this recipe, I mean it has so many great reviews! Mine did not turn out...the flavor was bland and texture was strange as if undercooked and just fell apart in pieces almost. I followed the directions and ingredients exactly too. I was hesitant about the shortbread-like crust and it was thick and not at all flavorful and pretty hard. This is the first cheesecake I have made in a very long time that cracked also. Maybe I was having a bad baking day..Im not sure but I wont be trying this one again.

This is FANTASTIC...In my critical eyes the first one wasn't as good as the second but practice makes perfect.  I had no complaints to either one.  I will definitely keep this in my files for future making!!  This is definitely a keeper!

Something went wrong...I am an avid baker, one who enjoys cooking.  This cheesecake was a FLOP!  VERY loose inside, was not cooked at all.  I baked at 200 for an hour and then turned oven off and left in for another hour...cooled over night in the fridge.  Cut into it and had to throw out the entire Easter dessert.

I live in a NY suburb and was looking for a NY cheesecake recipe.  I have tried a few from this site, and this one is the best so far.  I gave it 4 stars because I do not like my cheesecakes with ANY crust at all.  I feel that any crust takes away from the flavor of the cake.  I made the cake as written omitting the crust altogether.  Prepared that way, the cake is 5 stars.

I made this recipe for my daughter's 17th Birthday.  It was a hit!  I did add 2 tsp. of clear vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp. of lemon extract to the recipe.  It added a wonderful flavor.  I also made a graham cracker crust.  Can't wait to have another special occassion to make it for.

Phenomenal!  This is simply delicious.  I added 1/3c of sour cream to this recipe and 1/2tsp of vanilla to the crust and batter. Once I was done with the batter I poured off 1/4 of it and stirred in melted baking chocolate.  I poured off another 1/4 of it and stirred in melted white chocolate.  I then layered the regular cheesecake, then chocolate, then white chocolate.  It was just enough batter to fill my pan. I'm at a high altitude so I baked it an extra 45 minutes.  I topped it with a creamy chocolate sauce. (2/3c of heavy cream brought to a boil then added 1/3c of chocolate chips and 1tbsp of honey).  It is absolutely to die for!  The cake is thick, creamy and delicious! The chocolate topping is heavenly!  The crust is tasty. This is the best cheesecake ever. I know, I love cheesecake, I have made several other recipes and this one is outstanding.  I'm sooo excited!  My husband was licking the knife and he's not the biggest fan of cheesecake.

The cheesecake itself was absolutely wonderful, but the crust wasn't good at all. I read in someone else's review that it was like a sugar cookie, but it isn't! It lacked sugar to make it sweet. I think a graham cracker crust is best after all. When I make this again, I will be adding vanilla to the cheesecake since I like my dessert real sweet. UPDATE: I made it with a graham cracker crust, and I added a tsp. vanilla while blending longer than I did last time. I raised the temp. from 200 degrees to 225 degrees for 1 hour and 10 min. The cheesecake was AMAZING! I cannot wait to experiment with different toppings!

I have been cooking with recipes from this site for many years, and never posted a review.  That having been said...this is the best homemade cheesecake I have ever had!  I can't get enough of it.  Thank you so much for sharing this one!

This recipe was amazing!  I love the fact that it strayed from the normal graham cracker crust.  I made the shortdough like a cookie, creaming the butter and sugar, adding the egg and then the flour.  I did have to mix it for a little bit before it all came together like a cookie.  I was a bit disappointed in the cooking time.  I swore the other people who had problems must have been using a smaller pan, but in my 10", I had to cook it for an additional 1 1/2 hours at 250 degrees to get it to set.  I did make only additions to the recipe, no changes.  On the shortbread bottom, I layered a package of raspberries and drizzled white chocolate, put about 2/3 of the filling and then did another package of raspberries and more melted white chocolate.  I put the last 1/3 of the batter and then dotted the top with raspberry jam that I put through a tiny strainer to get the seeds out.  I swirled that with more white chocolate.  It was to die for!!!!  My husband says he has a new favorite dessert and couldn't stop smiling!!!  I didn't think it was too eggy like others said and I thought the amount of crust on bottom was perfect.  I hope someone will like the variation as much as we did!  Happy Valentine's Day!

This is the only cheesecake I have ever made, and I have made it multiple times.  Every single time it has come out perfect.  I'm going to be making it for Valentine's Day with chocolate covered strawberries!  Can't wait!!!

Stop looking for a great cheesecake recipe because this is the one. This was awesome!
I added vanilla and ¼ cup of sour cream. Did not use a water bath. Wish I had it cracked. Not the end of the world…fruit topping worked well to cover the crack. 
No problems with the center not cooking. Followed cooking times but increased the temp to 215 instead of 200 as suggested earlier.

I've made this recipe twice.  The first time, I didn't know that the battery was going out on my timer and it was not timing properly.  It got a little over done and cracked like crazy and it was still great.  The second time, I used 3 timers and it came out perfectly.  I've received rave reviews both times.  My friends from NY just love it.

This is easily a 5 star however the crust is what brings it down.  i recommend that you make a gram-cracker crust.  when doing so just soften the butter and then add the gram-crackers until it is very granular and them press it into the spring form.  also use egg whites not egg yokes for the cheese cake.

I have made this twice, and it was absolutely wonderful both times!  I did add vanilla into the batter, however.  

A side note: both times I made it, there was a layer of sweat or condensation over the top after refrigeration, even though the cake was completely cool before I put it in.  Did this happen to anyone else?  I think it might have been the brand of cream cheese I used.  I'll try it with Philly next time.

This was my first ever attempt to bake a cheesecake and I settled on this recipe. It was pretty easy to prepare. I had a couple hiccups along the way but in the end the cake came out looking really nice and tasted delicious. I served it after Thanksgiving dinner and everyone enjoyed it. This cake is extremely rich. I recommend this recipe, especially for beginners like me.

Oops.  I used 1c cream instead of 1/4c just now when I made this cheesecake, and didn't realize the mistake until after I put it in the oven.  I guess I'll cook it a little longer and see how it turns out.

Great cheeseckae! My only complaint (and maybe it's my oven) is that it wasn't cooked enough and was a bit loose inside. I didn't get that thick new york cheesecake like I was looking for. I made this for my hubby's bday and he loved it so I'm sure I'll be making it again soon.

The reasons I am giving this 4 stars is because the crust (IMO) does not go well with the cheesecake at all. Also the cooking time was WAY off!! I baked mine at 475 for 10 minutes, then at 200 for an hour. It was FAR from done so I changed the oven temp. to 250 and baked it for an additional 1 1/2 hours, then shut off the oven and let it sit for an hour. It turned out perfect! The cheesecake tastes AWESOME, I am definately keeping this recipe!! The only change I made to the recipe was to use sour cream instead of whipping cream. I made mine into a turtle cheesecake and topped it with caramel, chocolate, chocolate chips, and pecans....YUMMY!!! Next time I will use a chocolate graham cracker crust and it will be perfect! This is what I will be bringing to our Thanksgiving get together, I am sure it will go fast!

This recipe is wonderful.  It was my first attempt at making a cheesecake.  I added extra vanilla extract but have also tried with lemon, almond, and rum extract for something a bit different, all worked out well.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfect! Did not crack or fall, and looked like it was from a bakery. Very creamy and smooth texture, my mother didn't believe I actually made this! Thanks so much to the poster for posting this recipe.

Only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 was because I prefer gramcracker crust.  This was great though.  I got a bit confused with other reviews regarding bake time and temp.  But will stick to original recipe instructions next time.  Yum

The best homemade cheesecake I've ever tasted! I had never made cheesecake before so I wasn't sure what to expect but this recipe was very easy! I didn't use a water bath and it still came out the perfect consistency. Smooth, rich, and creamy! My whole family was raving about how good it was and how they couldn't believe I had made it myself! The only problem I had was it did crack, but oh well. I didn't effect the taste at all!

A very good recipe. The ingredients are very well porportioned. Great crust. Not good cooking instructions though - it came out runny. The second time I made it I did a water bake and cooked it at 350 until it was firm but  still a little jiggly. Perfect.

I had to give this recipe 5 stars ... it was amazing!  I did make a few slight changes:  I added a little sour cream to the recipe for some tang (about 1/2c).  I also added  1tbsp vanilla to the mix and some lemon juice.  I was thrilled that I had no cracks in my cake, which I was surprised because it's my first time baking a cheesecake.  I did use a water bath as suggested by some reviewers.  I played with the baking time because I was scared it would be runny, all in all I baked it for double the time requested:  I didn't touch the oven till after the baking and cooling time, however after sticking toothpicks in the middle I saw it could use a little more baking.  So I left it in the oven and put it back to 200 degreees for another 30 minutes and then let sit for the same amount of time.  I refrigerated it and topped it the next day and it was awesome!  Perfect even!  Thank you so much for this post, my boyfriend loved it!  We're two people and that whole cake disappeared way too fast lol!

This is the best cheesecake I have ever eaten!  The only thing I added was 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  I sometimes substitute a graham cracker crust.

everyone knows how heavy cheesecake is and how many people it should feed.  i brought this covered in fresh strawberries and chocolate sauce to an initmate gathering of about 10.  The entire thing was gone in about 2 hours.  This was my first cheesecake and I will not hesitate to make it again, esp since i tis blueberry season!  YUM!

This cheesecake has a good taste and is perfect for those who do not want a strong taste. The crust almost overpowers the cheesecake, so if I made this again, I would take another's suggesstion and cook the crust about half the time so that it could blend instead of being a completely seperate part. The texture is good when you eat it, but it was very difficult to cut without the whole thing falling apart. I agree with another reviewer who stated that it needed to be cooked longer and my oven is only 2 years old. Although the texture was not very soft, it still cracked. Overall, the taste is pretty good but for the presentation lacked.

This really is the best. I messed up my first attempt, but it was totally my fault. I have a 9" springform, so I did have a bit of trouble with it not setting in the middle.  I need to leave it at the lower temp for a bit longer. The taste was amazing though. Definitely a keeper!

After his first bite, my husband got down on his knees and wrapped his arms around my waist and called me a saint.  Truly, this cheesecake is fabulous.  I did make several minor changes: I added vanilla, the zest of one lemon, and juice from half the lemon.  Also, I used a graham cracker crust (a recipe from this site), I just thought my husband would like this better.  I did, however, get a crack. I don't know why, maybe because I opened the oven door after the timer went off.  I won't open it next time.  It didn't matter, though, it was fabulous!  For a topping I made a strawberry sauce recipe (also from the site), delicious!

This is a very good recipe, thanks! My crust turned out a little bit tough, so I think I will bake it for only a few minutes next time. Also it does taste a little bit eggy, so perhaps 3 or 4 eggs instead of 5. The flavor is very good, just not excellent due to the eggy taste. I did not have any trouble with making it though....no browning on the top, no cracks. It looks lovely! I did not need to use a pan of water either. I think a key step is to just put it in the oven and not open the door until it has sat for the hour with the oven off. As tempting as it can be, do NOT open the oven! It messes up the temperature inside. It is worth waiting for!

I had to make this twice due to the fact that my oven was too cold to bake as directed. The second try was successful when I raised the baking temperature to 300 degrees. Granted, it cracked but it didn't matter since I topped it with strawberries. The texture and flavor was wonderful! Thanks for the recipe. It will now be added to my recipe box!

This was my first time making cheesecake, even worse, I found out right before I started baking it that it was going to be used in a pre-wedding dinner for my sister-in-law. Thankfully it came out beautifully. I had a 9 inch pan on hand and an oven that couldn't reach the top temp nor get down to the bottom one so I ended up baking for 15 min at first and an hour and a half for the second bake. I then made sure to let it sit for an hour and sleep in the fridge for 24 hours. No cracks, no settling, just pure, thick, and dense cheesecake. I would recomend HEAVILY greasing the cake pan however. Not only did that help with getting the cake out of the pan at cutting time, but it seemed to help the cake pull away from the sides as well. My sister-in-law and her fiance loved the cake and I introduced my wife's family to what cheesecake is supposted to be, not the spongy mess that it is in Japan. THANKS!

The best, you must let it sit overnight. Don't know what happens to it, but it tastes much better the next day!

My first words after the first bite was "Oh My God" My Husband words were Wicked!! 
I have always wanted to make a cheesecake like you would buy in a restaurant but afraid.after reading the reviews posted I said I would try it.I put my creamcheese in the microwave to long and made my batter too runny and started to panic and didn't know what to do so I put it in the fridge for 15 mins and added half of 1/3 cup more of flour. i thought for sure I had it ruined bake it for 1 hr on 200 but it was still very jiggly so I baked it for another hour for a total of 2hrs at 200 then turned off the oven and left it there for another hour. left it at room temp for 20 mins and then placed it the fridge for over night. It never even showed any sign of cracking.

Oh my goodness!!!  Fabulous!  Made this for a friend's birthday party and it was too die for!  Baked it on the center rack and put a pan with hot water on the bottom rack.  Not the first crack!!  This was delicious.  Thank you!

Great texture!  I really did a lot of reading before deciding on this recipe and I chose it because of the crust, GOOD CHOICE!  I did use a 10" springform pan lined with parchment paper.  I left out the egg in the crust as someone else mentioned and I used only 4 packages of cream cheese.  Everything was at room temperature before starting.  I did add a teaspoon of vanilla, although I think this could be so versatile by using other flavors.  I baked exactly as stated and I did put a 9 x 13 pan of water on the shelf below in the oven. NO CRACKS, PICTURE PERFECT!  I chilled for 18 hours and added raspberry topping and whipped cream.  Try it, you won't be sorry!

I think this recipe is best left to sit for at least 24 hrs in refrigerator. Also you should keep the crust thinner or it tastes doughy when finished. I made a strawberry sauce and it was very good.

This cheesecake recipe is the BEST!  I have made cheesecake before and this is the best recipe thus far.  I have no intention of ever using another recipe again.  This is IT!  I put apples and caramel on the crust before I pour the cake batter into the pan.  My boyfriend loves caramel and apples and so next time I think I am going to drizzle caramel on the top as well.  My cake cracked on the top, but then again I had to use a food processor to mix the batter because I do not have my mixer where I currently am living, so I had to use the processor.  I was worried about overbeating, and the cake did crack right down the middle.  No biggie, if it was summer time I would have just topped the cakes with fresh strawberried.  Sides came out perfect, however the crust was a bit thick.  Next time I make this I am going to use less crust and bake it less, that way its not so thick and hard (I may have overcooked it due to a temperature problem with my over - NOT the recipe).

I would highly recommend this recipe for anyone!  It's easy and DELICIOUS!  So versatile and anyone will enjoy this cake.  As a lifelong New Yorker, I can honestly say this cheesecake is better than all the deli and specialty cheesecakes made here in NY!

Awesome! The creamiest cheesecake I have ever made and I have made quite a few. Following others suggestions, I owe the creamines to the long baking time at a low heat. I baked it at 400 degrees for 10 min. then turned the temp. down to 200 degrees and finished baking it for 3 hours. Then I turned the oven off, cracked the door and cooled it in the oven before refrigerating. Also as suggested I added 2 tsp. vanilla to the cheesecake and for the crust I eliminated the sugar and used 1/2 c butter. I'm glad I did. I substituted maple syrup (and added an extra 1/8 c. flour) for the white sugar for health reasons and it was way too sweet for me. Next time I will only use 1 to 1 1/4 cup maple sugar. The creaminess was just amazing!

This is a great recipe. It is the first time I made a cheesecake(not from a box) and it turned our perfect. Great flavor, no cracks! This is the best recipe for beginners. You may have to adjust cooking times.

My very first attempt at baking a cheesecake and it turned out better than great. It was better than a friends whom I always ask to bake my cheesecakes for me. Never again. 5 stars all the way around. Even the crust was something new for me. Better than the graham cracker. I have added this to my recipe box and will be sure to also add to my flash drive for safe keeping with my others. Thanks a million for this wonderful recipe.

This was incredible. Amazingly creamy and delicious. I used a 10" spring form pan like recommended, and I didn't need to worry about excess crust. It coated the bottom perfectly. I sprayed the pan with vegetable spray and had no problem with sticking. I followed the directions, didn't worry about steam baths or anything, and it baked beautifully. It did end up with a crack, but it didn't affect the taste. I let the cream cheese reach room temperature and then I whipped it with a mixer before adding any other ingredients. This was one wonderful cheesecake. I served it plain with a strawberry topping on the side that I found on this site. Delicious both ways.

I was so afraid of making cheesecake.  The waterbath, the cracking.  It made me queasy to think about it.  
I made this recipe for Chtistmas day and what a SUCCESS.  Everyone raved about how good it was.  I couldn't believe it was so easy.  I will adjust the crust next time.  I didn't spread it up the sides, so it ws pretty thick on the bottom.  That's just my preference though. 
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. Wonderful!!

Ok... love love love the cheesecake.  Flavor is perfect and dense!  Shortbread crust - not so much.  Burnt too fast and tastes kind of chalky.  (And it took FOREVER to get it out of the pan!)  I'll stick to my graham crackers - but the cheesecake itself is delish!

I recently made this cheesecake for the first time for a small dinner party. The other guests remarked that it was probably the best cheesecake they had ever had. It came out incredibly dense and smooth. I recommend blending the cream cheese first, as suggested elsewhere. I warmed up the creamcheese in a covered dish for about 2 minutes in the microwave to soften. The crust is incredibly delicious, nice and buttery. Better than any graham cracker crust. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

This was a big hit. I followed the directions exactly and topped it with the Supreme Strawberry Topping from this site. DH said it was the BEST cheesecake he'd ever had, and it was so amazing he ate almost the whole thing by himself and refused to share with his coworkers. 'Even better than the one mom makes!'

YUM! This is very similar to the old Lindy's cheesecake recipe that I've been using for years; it's one of the best. I love the "crust" as opposed to an ordinary graham cracker crust (which I think detracts from the cheesecake-iness.) The key is cooking it EXACTLY the right amount of time as it dries out easily if overcooked. It's a keeper!  (There's always room for cheesecake!)

I followed the directions exactly and the cheesecake was not cooked enough in the middle-it was runny.  The flavor and texture of the properly cooked outside part was great though.

This was my first time baking a cheese cake and it turned out pefectly.....no cracks and great tasting. 
However, I have an 8" spring form so I reduced the amount of cream cheese used to about 750 gms (approx 1.6 lbs) Also used 4 eggs instead of 5 and reduced the amount of sugar by 1/4 cup and the flour by 1/2 tbsp. 
Also I have never blind baked a pastry before either and fortunately for me it wasn't much of a disaster although the pastry did sag ever so slightly along the sides of the spring form while I was blind baking it. So for next time I would be a bit more cautious. I was told that it would be a good idea to use dried beans to hold the pastry in place before before blind baking. 
Anyhow, eventually the cake turned out great. I followed every instruction on blending, baking, leaving it in a warm oven, chilling overnight, etc., to a tee. Even resisted the temptation to open the oven door at any time during the baking process and after while I left it to cool in the oven and the result was a perfectly baked cheese cake which I served with Strawberry Sauce and was devoured by my guests who were really keen on getting their hands on the recipe.

THIS WAS THE BEST CHEESECAKE EVER!
EVERYONE SAID IT TASTED LIKE RESTAURANT CHEESECAKE.
IT'S HUGE AND IT DISAPPEARED IN ONE NIGHT. I USED A GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST FROM BOX OF GRAHAM CRACKER CRUMBS WITH TWO TABLE SPOONS OF CINNAMON ADDED AND DOUBLED THE RECIPE SINCE THE CHEESECAKE WAS SO BIG. EVERYONE RAVED!

This intimidated me at first.  It was the first New York Cheesecake I have ever baked.  It turned out awsome!  Takes a long time to bake, but is well worth the effort.  We topped it with canned blueberries (pie filling) and was the hit of Easter dinner!

This was my first foray into cheesecake-making. It came out a little liquid in the middle - I had cranked down the oven temperature a little because one of the other reviews said it burned, maybe that was the reason. It still tastes mighty good, but I think Graham crackers in the crust would make it even better. I might make this again.

I made this cheesecake to use up some leftover packages of cream cheese.  I had to cut the recipe in half though because I only had two 8 ounce packages.  It turned out amazing.  I followed all the directions exactly and the next morning half the cake was gone because my hubby ate it in the middle of the night!!!

This cheesecake was awesome!!!!! This was my FIRST cheesecake and my wife didn't believe I made it. Base on my oven I did let the cake cook atbout 1- min. longer. Based on everyone elses review, I put 1 3/4 cups of flour for the crust and baked to 13 min. It wasn't dry and turned out perfect.

I really liked this recipe. It was easy and I didn't get a crack in it at all.  I didn't like the crust though and so next time, I will make it crustless.  It's great though and the taste is wonderful. I did add the vanilla and a little bit more sugar.  I recommend it.

This cheesecake is delicious!! I used a cinnamon graham cracker crust. This is just our preference, so I can't comment on the crust. The cheesecake was superb!
Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful texture!  Couple of modifications...I used a graham cracker crust (just my preference), added 1 tsp vanilla as others suggested, and used sour cream in place of heavy cream (didn't have heavy cream on hand!)  Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer briefly then did the rest of the mixing by hand.  No water bath used...not a single crack either.  Delicious!!  Will make again for sure

Exactly the deli style in NY.  I used a cup or less of flour for the crust and only spread it on the bottom.  This cheesecake is divine.  Baked it for 1 1/2, then let it sit for 1/2 hour in the oven.  Perfect.
Thanks Sandy!

My Husband loved this recipe.  I made it for his birthday, and we could not eat it within a reasonable time frame. So I took the remainder and froze it in an air tight container.  It tasted just as good 4 months later as it did when I first baked it.

Very tasty cheesecake.  It has an authentic New York style texture.  Surprisingly easy to make once the butter and cream cheese are softened.

This is a TERRIFIC cheesecake!  A few words of advice to anyone making a cheesecake....YOU CAN NOT USE LOW FAT or FAT FREE cream cheese or sour cream in a cheesecake!  Atleast if you want it to be thick, creamy and delicious.  Also, all of your ingredients need to be at room temperature to blend well.  Good luck fellow cheesecake lovers!

I followed the recipe exactly with the only exception being I used two packages of Neufatchel cheese and the rest cream cheese.  It came out a little "loose" in the middle, but that may be because of the lighter cheese.  Other than that, it had very good flavor and I thought the crust was perfect for the cake.  If I make again I will probably use all cream cheese.

I haven't made a cheesecake since I horribly messed up my first one 4 years ago.  However, I made this one for my husband on valentine's day and it turned out perfect.  It looked as though I had purchased it from a bakery.  There was one 1/2" crack that was barely noticeable.  I had my doubts about the shortbread crust, but it really went well with the cheesecake.  I will definately make this one again.

This is a WONDERFUL cheesecake recipe!  I used to make this for my yearbook staff when I was in high school & everyone always loved it.  This is so dense and thick...just like the deli.  BTW, I do make this in the 9 x 13 inch pan and it goes farther that way.  MMM!

I made this twice, both times without a water bath - 1st time, the top browned too much and 2nd time, I got a grand canyon in my cake. The cake itself tasted sinfully DELICIOUS!!! But I didn't like the crust at all - it broke my knife's handle when I tried to slice the cake's crust. So the 2nd time, I used a different crust recipe. But the cheesecake was surprisingly easy to make and tasted just like the cheesecakes you would have to pay so much at delis.

This recipe was FANTASTIC!  I really liked the shortbread crust.  The only thing is...is that it is so rich you can barely eat a couple bites.  Everyone else that tried this cheesecake after I made it was mesmerized.  I also did a twist on it and added Kahlua and Chocolate.

It really was a good tasting cheesecake and I would make it again for a very special occassion.  It truly is rich but true to the NeW York cheesecakes that I have eaten in the past.

Great cheesecake:  dense, moist, highly successful on the first try. After reading the recipe and comments,  I made the following adjustments:

1.  Omitted the two egg yolks
2.  Added 1 tbls vanilla extract
3.  Added 1 tsp lemon zest

The family LOVED it...

Wow, this was the talk of the meal last week. Pretty simple, and even the crust was a winner. Can't wait to make my next one based on this recipe.

Very good. This was my first time making cheesecake so I’m sure it could be better. The only thing is that it made more batter than could fit in the pan so it was undercooked in the middle for the 1 hr bake and leaving it in there so should just cook it a little bit longer if it gets really full In the pan

Made exactly as recipe stated. I was disappointed with his this cheesecake came out of the oven. Even though I greased my entire pan extremely well, it still had a HUGE 3 way split in the center... It was for a party & I didn't have time to re-make, so I made a simple berry sauce & added some fresh berries to hide the crack. It looked beautiful, guests never knew & everyone raved about the taste!! Overall rich, sense & creamy, but without being too much- and the crust makes this perfect!! DEFINITELY my future go to,!

I used a food processor because I didn’t have a stand mixer so I think it didn’t rise quite as high. I loved the authentic shortbread crust like REAL NY cheesecake has. I didn’t use the extra yolks. I cut the temp to 250 instead of 200. I also made my usual sour cream and sugar topping and spread it on the last 15 min of cool down. I’ve made many cheesecakes in the past 50 years and I liked this the best. I’m pretty sure the low and slow kept it from cracking like many of mine. I will definitely make this again. So rich tasting, it doesn’t need toppings for true cheesecake lovers.

First chesecake ever and it turned out beautifully! As others suggested, I added a 1/2 tsp. vanilla and zest of one lemon to both the crust and filling,  I also gently creamed the filling ingredients, adding the whole eggs last. As suggested, I omitted the 2 egg whites. I left it in the oven without opening the door until it was completely cool. It looked fantastic and tasted even better! It was so smooth and creamy. Everyone at our Thanksgiving feast raved about it! Thanks to this recipe, I am no longer afraid of making cheesecake!

Still runny in the middle even though I followed recipe to a tee! IF I ever make it again I will double the baking time! Not sure if I can fix it but will try.

This was my first Cheesecake in many decades. I chose this recipe for its simplicity and my daughter's Love of the New York style Cheesecake. However, she did want a basic Graham cracker crust.
I followed the rest of this recipe with the exception of adding 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of lemon juice. I also didn't have whipping cream on hand so substituted 1/2 cup sour cream at the end. 
I wrapped the pan in regular foil and did not use a water bath. 
This Cheesecake came out of the oven in perfect condition! There were no cracks or burns! And it was fully cooked through the center!
My family was extremely happy with how this turned out! I was thrilled at how easy it was to prepare!

The taste was delicious but the cake was severely cracked and unset in the middle. We will try again and will not use convect next time (my mom a veteran cheesecake maker said the cake appears to have cooked too much/too fast)

I love the recipe! Did not turn out well the first time though. I followed the directions to a T so maybe my stove isn't great or I definitely mucked something up. I followed MelissaJean's suggestion on cook time and it was perfect!

I made this for the first time on Thanksgiving. I followed the recipe, but instead of cream, I used sour cream, and I added some almond extract. It didn’t need it,I just love almond! The recipe says to turn off the oven and let it sit for an hour, but I got busy and left it for close to two, and it was absolutely perfect! All I would say is, make sure all your ingredients (except the butter) are at room temperature, and you’ll have a winner!

This recipe is the absolute best I have ever found.  I do use the sour cream suggestion vs. the whipped cream.  It is thick, rich and delicious everytime....just make sure you let it set in the refrigerator overnight or longer!!

I love, love, LOVE this cheesecake.  I have been making it for  years.  It is simple to make and has always come out perfect.  I am surprised at the reviews that state otherwise.  I also do not understand the people who rate this, then proceed to change the recipe.  I appreciate "tips".  All in all it is a great recipe and I have always gotten great compliments on this.  Thank you for submitting this, I'm not a great baker but this one sure makes me look one!!!

Best lightest ,most delicious cheesecake ever!!!! Followed directions with some changes, I baked it as directed for the first 15 minutes but then baked at 350 for one hour.  I also omitted the extra egg whites, but did beat the cream cheese and sugar mixture for a good 10 minutes before adding other ingredients!!!!!

Very easy to assemble. I used graham cracker crust. I made sure cheese and eggs were room temp and I whipped the cheese til fluffy, alone before adding  the other ingredients. This is my go to cheesecake recipe for sure.

This was my first cheesecake.  I followed the instructions exactly.  It came out perfectly.  Perfectly.  Delicious, perfect consistency, perfect crust.  And I'm no expert baker.  

I now know how to make cheesecake that my family loves.  Thank you.

This recipe is from the Joy of Cheesecake book by authors Bobvjerg  & Iggers. I have been making this cheese cake for over 27 years. Try it with a gingersnap cookie crumb crust. Divine!

Followed the recipe exactly. Hated the crust the filling part was okay but not great. I will not make this recipe again. I am a fairly experienced cook.

Very dense and delicious! I've tried about a dozen cheesecake recipes looking for just the right one, and this is definitely my favorite. Mine cracked in the middle at some point while cooling in the oven (I followed the instructions exactly), so it didn't look quite as pretty as some of these pictures, but it still tasted stinking amazing!

Exceptional cheesecake - made exactly as described, delicious. One small addition: I used 1 tsp of pure lemon extract and 1 tsp of vanilla extract in the cream cheese mix - delicious!

This cheesecake in my opinion is awesome! I made this in my RV oven. I used the Graham Cracker Crust (no-bake) recipe from this site. Chilled the crust one hour before filling. Baked with the filling in it at 475 degrees for 10 minutes. then turned the temperature down to 200 degrees. If anyone has ever baked in an RV oven knows  this really doesn't happen basically you just have the pilot light going.  So after about a half hour I turned the temperature up to 300 - 275 degrees. I rotated the pan about every 30 minutes because an RV oven doesn't cook evenly. Since I used a 9 inch spring form pan it took about 2 hours to bake.  I will definitely make this again. It took patients baking in the RV but well worth it.

The only changes I did to this recipe is let the cheesecake sit in the oven with it off for and hr and half then let it sit on the counter for an hr before putting in the fridge. I realize that the internal oven temperature varies but this was very much undercooked. The flavor of the part that was cooked was delicious but it needs at least another 40-60 min cook time. After all that effort for a cake I throw away is extremely disappointing.

This is a medium-strong in weight. I was searching for a cheesecake that could beat my mothers. I know that she adds sour cream in hers. I am going to take less cream cheese and add the sour cream.

Bake it in a water bath. Comes out perfect every time. Also a thin shortbread crust is better than the recipe.

This is an update to my last review.  This recipe is amazing and has never failed me.  I wonder if those that had a problem did not make sure that ALL of the ingredients are at room temp.

I have made a number of Cheesecakes in the past and this is hands down the best. Everyone wanted the recipe or they thought it had been purchased at a deli. I did use Sour Cream instead of heavy cream - but that is only because it is a personal preference. What makes this recipe work is the detailed directions on time and temp. Make sure cream cheese is room temp and cream it alone to remove all lumps and then go on with rest of recipe. This is one that is truly worth the effort. It should jiggle a little but will firm up in fridge.

It was my turn to make dessert for a family dinner. My pregnant sister mentioned she had been craving cheesecake, so I used her as an excuse to make this. This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake that didn't come from a box that said "Jello" on it, and it was life changing. I made it exactly as written, it did get one crack, but it didn't effect the taste whatsoever. It was so good we were practically licking our plates, and 2 days later when I found out my husband ate the last piece I nearly cried. My Mom and sister both said it tasted as good as you could get at the Cheesecake Factory.

Made it twice and followed directions closely ( except I used a graham wafer crust) . Turned out perfectly both times. Creamy, rich, and no cracks! I will definitely make it again. It's my go-to recipe for cheesecake now.

Made the recipe as is, but adding 1 tsp of vanilla. Excellent! Just came back from a trip to NYC and didn't have time to pick up a Junior's cheesecake for co-workers and family. This rated better than Junior's! Will definitely make this again.

I used a graham cracker crust and omitted the two extra egg yolks. It tasted wonderful. perfect consistency and flavor. We used a variety of berries served on the side. 
It was my first time making a cheese cake and with this recipe, it wont be the last.
The baking times were just right for my oven, turned out perfectly.

My only problem with this cheesecake is that the crust likes to melt down the sides of the pan and then when baked, it's really hard. The taste is wonderful. But I do wish I could figure out a way to fix my crust issue!

I've read some of the reviews and I agree with some of the negative ones!  However, this is a cheesecake that reminds me of the ones I had in Germany!  You have to follow the recipe closely, meaning, oven temperature and timing!  I've made this around 5-6 times and my family loves it to includes my friends.  I have to actually hide a piece for myself!

This recipe is the best I've tried.  With the exception of one thing;  the cooking time & temperature. 
I followed the tips from another member and cooked at 200 for 3 hours,  & it came out great. 
I think i might prefer mine a tiny bit more golden, so I think next time I'll try cooking at 225 or so, for 2& some odd hours.

I made this, as written and it's amazing. The smoothest, creamiest cheesecake ever. I didn't even use any topping, that's how good it is. *I did not, however, refrigerate overnight before serving. I'd say, after left in the over to cool once turned off, about 4 hours refrigerated before served. So delicious!

I did a chocolate graham cracker crust and added chocolate chips to the batter and top of cake, other than that followed the recipe. Mine turned out very creamy (I prefer a firmer cheesecake) but very good flavor. I'm actually scaling it down and making it again!

Loved the crust.... so much better than store bought graham cracker or vanilla wafer crusts that are full of  full of preservatives and chemicals I used no yolks  only 3 8 ounce pkgs of ( could use 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda and 2 teaspoons vanilla  I separated my eggs beat yolks and whites separately  then fold in slowly very good!  If you add all the eggs up this recipe uses 8 eggs as written!

I do not know much about cheesecakes and this is the first recipe I have ever tried to cook.  The filling is outstanding!   However...  the crust was very, very bland.  After talking to others, I decided to use a graham cracker crust (crushed graham crackers--two sleeves + brown sugar+ stick of melted butter).  Grahman cracker crust does not have to be baked before hand.   I will also say here that I did as other suggested and whipped the cream cheese with an electric mixer before I added any other ingredients and if the cream cheese is gunkying up the mixer, go ahead and add the heavy cream.   Cream cheese takes forever to come to room temperature (even out of packages) so I have started microwaving the cream cheese at 10% power in the microwave until it starts to become more malleable. Anyway, I've made this recipe about 7-9 times already and it's pretty darn good!!   Very rich! :)

I like this one a lot ... except for the crust ... This is the best Recipe So Far ... I was looking for a Recipe without a crust ... Spring Pans are not easy to find because they leak and now that I have one I'll use this recipe and not use a Crust ... Keeping it in the oven for an Hour at 200F was perfect you wont need to Bathe the Cheese cake in Water while you bake it ... I Tried another recipe on here but I haven't tasted it yet ... I just made it today and it needs to sit in the fridge to form... I'll be back because I plan on making another one and my Printer is on the Fritz ... The Ink Cartridge

Tried this yesterday, followed the directions to a T.  The center was runny ~ didn't cook completely, and the cream cheese didn't "cream" with the other ingredients.

I made this over Christmas and it was so tough to get the cream cheese to a warm enough "room temperature". I would suggest like others did of creaming the cream cheese and sugar together before mixing with the eggs to prevent clumping.

Was my first attempt at a cheesecake overall and this  step by step recipe  made it easy . A few pointers that isnt mentioned here is NOT to over mix the batter and to also oil the sides of the pan to avoid cracks. Also i used a 9" pan not a 10" pan so i would think w the 10" pan these measurements would be off a hair. Lastly I had to add an extra 1/2 stick of butter to get the short dough to spread otherwise it was glue. After all that the cake was a success!! Ill hide the crack w strawberries / whip cream.

I just made this after 2 consecutive cheesecake failures. It turned out perfectly!! I did not par bake the crust because I didn't have time to allow it to cool completely, and though it was not raw, it would have been better had I done that. I followed a couple other reviewers' suggestions and added vanilla (~2 tsp for me) and substituted sour cream for the heavy cream. I mixed the almost-room-temp cream cheese first to get it smooth, then beat in the sugar, flour, sour cream and vanilla. The final step was mixing the eggs in all at once by hand with a flat whisk. I sprayed the edges of the springform that weren't covered by the crust with cooking spray and had no cracking. It also separated from the pan perfectly. I was fearful of underbaking it because that was part of my problem with the others I tried and they seemed to take forever to bake (2 hours for a 9-inch!), so rather than lowering temp to 200, I lowered it to 225 F for 1 hour, and it was beautifully light golden and perfectly cooked! I'm not sure this makes a difference, but I live at over 5000 feet elevation. I served it with a blackberry coulis made from berries in my yard. It was very yummy! Thank you SO much for this recipe! It made my husband's birthday dinner very special. This will be my go-to cheesecake recipe from now on!

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out a big runny mess tastes fantastic though. Next time will cook longer, I stuck my first runny one in the freezer so hopefully it will thicken up! :)

As for everyone talking about the cheesecake cracking cheesecakes are very delicate. Moving ur cheesecake from the oven to the counter can crack it. Some ppl say dont over beat it ect. I beat my ingredients the hole time im adding everything together. Thats with every cheesecake recipe ive every made an ive made tons of cheesecakes I use a low speed of course. This is a beautiful recipe. I use reg vanilla and Madagascar vanilla in it and even vanilla beans. Also I top mine with burbon cherries. Or pineapples, peaches, strawberries caramel, ect. Its a great recipe. Ive also used different extracts with it rootbeer, lemon with lemon peel and orange. Thank you for submitting this

I made this recipe, but made the mistake of removing the springform pan before refrigerating... Don't do that! But the cheesecake was perfect otherwise! Best recipe ever. Oh, but cook it for a lot longer... Mine took over an hour and a half at 200 degrees.

This was such a joy to make and it turned out beautiful. Had to adjust temperature some.  A few things to remember with making it: Do not over mix the eggs and cream,use foil sheets around the outside of the pan,water bath also and believe me it will be worth the effort that you put into making it.....lots of raves.

I really loved this cheesecake. It's sweet and tasty and the only one I use. Best cheesecake ever. The only flaw of this recipe is the crust so instead I use a regular Graham cookie crust. But, over all its the best cheesecake out there!

I made this cheesecake for the first time and absolutely love it!  I'm known as a cheesecake connoisseur by my family and friends, so I'm always trying new recipes.  This will now be my GO TO cheesecake recipe.

I added about a tsp of vanilla and vanilla beans from one pod; otherwise made as is.

I followed this recipe to the T and it turned out completely cracked. I've been making cheesecakes for 30 years and have never had a crack before. I might have done something wrong but I've never had anything turn out like this. It might taste good but I have to make another cake now.

LOVED LOVED LOVED the taste of this cheesecake. My family and I are "cheesecake snobs" and everyone loved this one!! I did have one problem. I promise I followed all the directions. After the baking process, the cheesecake was placed in the fridge for 13 hours. When we cut the cake this evening...the middle was still runny. Not sure why. Suggestions for next time? I do live in what's considered "high altitude"...maybe the cake should cook longer because of this? Regardless of the runny middle, there was NO leftovers.

The taste of this recipe is great! I followed these directions all the way until the cooking time. I left it in the oven about 1.15 hours and then 1 hour sitting in the hot oven. Its been in the fridge since yesterday and its still not set. Its very eggy in the middle. Im disapointed because all the reviews rave! I am going to try making it again with fewer eggs, no one likes soupy cheesecake. Thank you

Ok, all the mistakes I made were my own fault. I've never made a 'real' cheesecake (usually just no-bake), but I'm a decent baker. I'm a crazy cheesecake lover, though. So, there's my cred. LOL

I made this cheesecake according to the recipe, without any additions. I eliminated 1/3 of the crust and only put it on the bottom. It turned out delicious, and next time I'll probably put it up the sides a little. I might add a little vanilla to it too. 

The cheesecake scared me with the wiggly middle, but I took it out after doing exactly what the recipe called for and put it in the frig. It was smooth on top, no cracking, some browning on the edges, but beautiful overall. I let it sit in the frig for about 4 hours and HAD TO HAVE SOME. The middle was a bit runny and the outside eggy. However, it was still ok. THEN, I just got some this morning, after allowing it to sit in the frig all night and it's not runny or eggy!!!! It's amazing!!!

This cheesecake is amazing.  It tastes professional and I am a cheesecake snob.  I LOVE a dense New York style cheesecake!  Mine had gigantic cracks but I will try a water bath next time.  The recipe makes too much shortbread.  Other than that, wonderful.

I've made this cheesecake numerous times (have another in the oven right now).  It cracks every time for me but I don't care - it tastes fantastic and I always top with glazed strawberries or blueberries anyway.  The crust is perfect as I live in Germany and graham crackers are hard to come by.  I think the cracking issue has to do with the cream cheese available here - it is only sold in the less dense (whipped) variety so far as I have been able to find.  All I can so though is yum!

I followed the recipe even though it seemed like too much egg for only 2 packages of creamcheese, yeap, too much egg.  Even without the 2 extra yolks.

I love Philadelphia's NewYork Cheesecake and wanted to try this recipe as many claims how rich it is. It is creamy and rich (as in eggy). But the taste was bland and a bit too sweet. I simply followed the recipe without adding vanilla or lemon like other suggested.

The base/crust was also... hard and too sweet, maybe it needs a bit salt. 

Anyhow, I am will not be making this recipe again but will try others. I am giving it 2 stars as it does comeout beautifully even without waterbath. Just not my taste and no, it's not NewYork Cheesecake! If you like creme brulee, you might like this.

Okay I'm only giving this recipe a five star rating because I used the crust from this recipe. Just remember I didn't use the filling from this recipe only the crust.

I was a little upset with how my first attempt turned out. I decided to follow the instructions to a "T", however, the cooking time just isnt right. I kept it in my over for an extra 40 min, then turned off. The center seemed jiggly as the instructions stated they would be, so i went against my gut and took it out to cool. Guess I shouldve trusted my instinct, because it was very runny in the center of the cake. This cake couldve cooked for a good 2 hrs or more, or with an increased temp. Mine was far from browning, so im sure it couldve gone in at a higher temp and been ok. Not sure if ill attempt again.

The taste is right on, exactly what I was looking for. I have made this recipe at least 4 times and have yet to find the correct cooking time. The middle just wont get done enough...the top browns and I'm afraid to let it go much further than 2 hours.

Wonderful flavor! A big, beautiful cheesecake. I baked it a bit longer than in the recipe  and chilled it for 24 hours and it still was too soft in the center, which made serving it a bit of a mess.

The first time I used this recipe and made no changes. I made two cheesecakes, one for my family and the other for my picky in-laws (including my mother-in-law who has no problem criticizing my cooking), and everyone loved it. The next time I made it, I used a recipe I found for graham cracker crust in place of the crust on this recipe. The graham cracker crust tasted a lot better and was easier to cut into than the other crust. As far as the cheesecake part is concerned, if you follow the directions precisely there is no reason why you shouldn't have a near-restaurant quality desert. It definately beats frozen cheesecakes, the kind you would make out of a box, or the kind you would buy in the supermarket bakery section. Very delicious and worth the time and effort.

This cheesecake has incredible flavor.  I actually used the crust from the NIlla praline cheesecake recipe on this site and that crust plus this cheesecake filling made for a wonderfully rich, creamy cheesecake.  I am sure it was error on the part of this baker-but I couldn't get the cheesecake to set and I'm not sure what I did wrong. The center remained soft.  The flavor was so incredible that my family didn't seem to mind and killed it, runny center and all.  I followed the recipe to the "T"  so I'm not sure- but I do know the flavor was so good that I will try it again.  Runny center and all..

New to cheesecakes, I decided to try this recipe because I love dense cheesecakes ... and I wasn't disappointed!  I made it for the family Thanksgiving and, unfortunately, didn't have time for a "dry run" before the big day.  So when it was time for dessert, I warned everyone that it was my first time making a cheesecake and I had no idea if it was edible or not.  Everyone decided to be good sports and tried it ... and I got RAVE reviews!  Everyone said it tasted like it came from a little cafe - creamy, yummy, and dense!!  This is a wonderful recipe that (obviously) even beginners can master!!  THANKS!

LOVE the cake-it is my husband's favorite, however I use a Nilla wafer crust instead. We weren't a fan of the shortbread crust, it was a little too dry and lacked flavor.

The crust was great, but the cheesecake stayed gooey in the middle.  I think I should have increased the oven temp a little.

This was my first cheesecake, and it came out PERFECT! There were no cracks or bubbles... beautifully smooth top and texture. I may try the graham cracker crust next time, and start adding a little hint of flavor into it. I'm very happy that I won't have to drool over the cheesecakes as much when QVC feature's their $40 cakes.

I LOVE this recipe and so does everyone I have made it for.  It definitely has become a staple recipe in my home.  I made it exactly as the recipe says.  I have made compote from different fruits for topping (blackberries or cherries, usually).  It is spectacular!

I read all the reviews and sounded really easy to make. I decided to give a try since this is my first attempt to bake a cheesecake. It didn't turn out what I expected. Firstly, the shortdough crust is too thick and hard after baking for almost an hour. When ready to serve, I had a hard time cutting through the crust and decided to cut away the crust and served it crust less even though it wasn't presentable at all. The taste was really yummy, my guests really loved it! Next time if I ever make again, I will try it with graham crackers instead of the given recipe for the crust. Sorry to say it is not an easy recipe to make.

My first cheesecake, or really my first EVER foray into baking, and it turned out absolutely perfect tastewise. Because of my inexperience, the top cracked due to overmixing, but it still tasted like it was from a bakery with the supreme strawberry sauce topping on this site.

This is very similar to a cheesecake recipe that has been in my family for 30 years. It is excellent.  Also works with a graham cracker crust.

this was really good. my only real complaint is that the crust was a little hard to cut with a fork. i followed the directions exactly. i drizzled it with honey and dropped a few blackberries on it when i served the cake. i posted a picture of a slice on here, please look at it. you might drool on your keyboard

unfortunately for myself, i didn't realize that i barely had any cream cheese until after i had baked the crust. however, i made pecan pie on top of the crust, and it was fantastic! the crust was truly delicious.

This recipe is awesome and it is true that I will never use another cheesecake recipe.  I have been making cheesecake with the same recipe for years but I wanted something new and easier.  This was it!  I made it exactly as the recipe is written and I will use this forever and ever.  The crust was even better than I expected.

This is everything a cheesecake should be! My first wasn't nearly done enough so I cook it twice as long as it states.  It tastes its best after sitting in the fridge a day, so you may want to plan ahead.  I use a simple cracker crust recipe instead and I've now become the "cheesecake woman" in the family. My brother in law didn't previously like cheesecake until I made this one.  My Mom said its better than Eli's or Cheesecake factory.  It is dense you can easily serve 12 using one cake.  I make a strawberry puree and whipped cream on top.  WOW.

This was pretty good.  I think because I made some modifications it didn't taste as good as it would have.  Instead of 2 1/2 pounds of cream cheese I used a lot less so it wasn't as cream cheesy as people would like, although I'm not a huge cheesecake fan.  I think next time I make it I make it with all of the cream cheese.  It still served about 15-16 people.

OUTSTANDING!!!! My family raved over this cheesecake.  It was not difficlut to make..time consuming, but worth it. I would like to try the ganache topping.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Maybe I will make it for my sons birthday on 02/28.

The recipe is fantastic.  Just a note, though: don't use omega-3 fortified eggs. Normally I can make cookies, etc with them and not notice the strange flavor, but there are so many eggs in this recipe that I could taste a fishy flavor.  Other than that, the texture is awesome!

Excellent cheesecake!!!!  The only things I changed were to add a splash of vanilla and I used a graham cracker crust.  The center was a little underdone, but I blame my oven.  I made a strawberry topping and no one noticed it was underdone.  Will definitely try again, I may need to cook on a lower temp for longer.

This recipe rocks and it kills everytime I make it.  If you add cocoa to the shortdough its still good and it is a nice color contrast.

Perfect Cheesecake! Absolutely rich and glorious. Just what I was hoping for. I love my graham cracker crust, but decided to see how the other half lives. It wasn't too bad, but a teaspoon of almond extract and a quarter cup of chopped walnuts added to the crust really put it over the top in my humble opinion. Tasted like a scottish shortbread cookie that way. And then topped with Chocolate Ganache Icing... Sure was nice to be a compared to a gourmet chef that day. Requests on bended knee for this to be made again have already begun. Thanks!!

I agree with the other reviews that a different crust would make the cheesecake even better.  We really enjoyed it.  I followed the recipe exactly as written but found that even after a day or two the middle of the cheesecake was not set completely, especially like the outside perimeter of the cheesecake.  The flavor was great but both my husband and I could detect an eggy flavor (not off putting but enough to make us notice it), especially in the middle where it did not cook as much as the outside.  I will definitely try it again and would definitely serve it to friends because overall it is a great tasting cheesecake.

Tasted great. Loved the crust. I undermixed because I read a review that said overmixing will cause cracks. Mine had lumps of cream cheese in it due to undermixing - so don't undermix like me. Mine had a small crack in it anyway. Still looked and tasted great. Will make again and use Kitchenaid mixer.

This was my first cheese cake and it turned out very good. I like that there was no water bath required. It lasted a long time in my fridge, too (about a week and a half) You can also freeze leftovers and it tastes great frozen.

Made this twice.  Great flavor, but don't care for the shortbread crust.  Next time will make with a different crust. First time overmixed, causing crack.  Second time--didn't overmix---no cracks.  Great recipe.

The first time I made this it came out absolutely perfect and looked beautiful with no cracks at all. The second time I made it, I beat the batter a little too long and I did get a fairly large crack, but it was easy to hide under the blueberries and it still tasted great. I will definitely make this again.

AWESOME. This is a THICK cheesecake like you would get at a Restaurant. And Delicious. We did the waterbath method and the top was flawless. Might try it without the waterbath next time. Only thing I added was I like Lemon or Orange Zest in my cheesecake so we added about a 3/4 of a teaspoon of orange zest and the juice of one orange. Made it taste very good.  For a topping I took a small bag of frozen raspberries and some Mixed Berry Preserved (Raspberry preserves would work also) and put them in a skillet on the stove and heated it up. I put about 3-4 tbs of sugar and heated throughly until the fruit was cooked down. I was afraid it would get too thick so i added the juice from the other orange and it gave it some orange zing also. All I can say is DEFINITELY the best cheesecake I've tasted.

I had bought all the ingredients to make the cheesecake on the cream cheese box, and I am SO glad I checked here first and sent the husband to the store for more cream cheese. It was simple to make, and OMG so delicious. I can't believe that I made something that turned out so wonderful. Thank you so much for the recipe, my husband is also very thankful for no more no-bake catastrophes. That's how much of a novice I am.

This is THE cheesecake recipe out there.  I followed the directions as written to a "t" with fantastic results.  The *only* thing I did at all differently was to add a teaspoon of vanilla to the crust mixture and another teaspoon of vanilla to the batter mixture. OMG, this is to die for. NO WATER BATH NEEDED!  Save yourself the time and hassle and just follow the directions and don't open the oven. Flawless.

This was wonderful.  I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the crust and 1 tsp vanilla to the filling and followed the remainder of the recipe.  I followed the instructions on the baking to the t and my son opened the oven door once and my cheesecake turned out picture perfect!  The taste is as good as any restaurant I've been to, if not better.  This is a must try!!

This was a GREAT recipe. The only thing that needed to be added was to cream the cheese before adding the other ingredients. I even made mine in a 9x13 inch baking pan and it turned out great! Friends of mine that don't even like cheesecake enjoyed it.

Used graham cracker crust instead, but followed recipe for cake exactly.  LOVED IT!   First time making cheesecake and it was a huge hit with my guests.   My tin foiled failed and the water bath seeped, but didn't seem to effect anything.   Next time will use a silicone pan around the springform.

Make sure you beat the cream cheese before you add the other ingredients or it will be very lumpy.  It's been a while since I've made a cheesecake and the instructions missed that step so mine turned out pretty bad.  As other reviewers said the baking instructions are way off. I cooked it a little longer than it said (in a pan of water) and refrigerated for 3 days and it was gooey and tasted uncooked in the middle.  I think the flavor was okay but it was hard to tell.  If I do it again I will try baking at 325 for about 45 min next time.

I have to say, I was kind of disappointed with this after reading all of the great reviews.  I thought the shortbread crust came out way too thick and chewy.  The filling itself was okay and had a good consistency, but it definitely lacked something.  I even added vanilla and lemon juice, but that seemed to do nothing.  I decided to mix some sour cream with a little sugar and add it to the top of the cake after it was done, which made it a little better, but if you're used to a tangy tasting cheesecake, I'd definitely add sour cream in the mix.  I think with a little tweaking, this is actually a good recipe, but I'd go with a graham cracker crust next time.

Excellent cheesecake.  This was my very first try at making a cheesecake and it was spectacular. Overall highly recommended especially for beginners. For my taste is was a tiny bit too sweet so I will cut back on the sugar and try sour cream instead of heavy cream.  I found the crust a bit blah.  I think the crust might need more sugar.

This was the first homemade cheesecake recipe that I ever tried. It was some work, but defintely worth it. My fiance is a cheese cake connoisseur and he loved it. Needless to say, I was very happy. Great recipe!

I just made this recipe with very good results. It's a plain cheesecake so it can be modified w/a variety of additions or toppings (but it's delicious as is). I followed the directions exactly and the consistency, cook time, crust ratio, etc. were all fine. The only thing was I had a crack about 4" long. Overall, I loved the taste and consistency; this will probably be my standard cheesecake going forward, I may add lemon zest and a tsp. of vanilla next time.

oh gosh, this is THE best cheesecake i have eaten. the consistency is perfect. i followed every instruction, except to replace half sugar with splenda, makes totally no difference at all. You must try it and you will never gaze in wonder at the cheesecakes sold in highend restaurants, because u can easily make them. Will definitely make them again and again and again until i get sick of cheesecake:)

I have to say that as a first time cheese cake baker I was very nervous to give it a shot.  But I went ahead and did it anyways and was blown away at how great it came out!  My family raved at how delicious it was and they are saying "No more store bought cheesecake!"  Absolutely amazing!

I prepared the crust exactly as it was on the recipe but pushed it up the sides of the greased pan just a bit and baked it 12 minutes.  I added the zest of an orange and 1 tsp vanilla to the batter and left everything else as it was.  All ingredients were at room temperature before I began, and I had no lumps when I mixed the batter as directed with my KitchenAid mixer and paddle.  I did not use a water bath, and baked the pie for 1 hour and 10 minutes due to my altitude of 6600'.  I put a note on the oven not to open or bang it, but there is a circular crack half way around the top, and one half way through the center.  Next time, I will add the waterbath to see if that solves the problem, and will lower the initial temp to 375 (my oven does not conduct the heat evenly or exactly). The texture of this pie is firm & smooth, and the flavor as I made it is rich with a hint of orange - wonderful!

This was my first ever attempt at a "real" cheesecake and it was absolutely wonderful!  Mine did crack despite following to the letter the heating and cooling instructions but as one reviewer said, once you start slicing it nobody knows the difference!  The crust was by far the best I have eaten and will definitely use this crust recipe again.  Mine seemed a little sweet so I may cut back on some sugar next time but my preference is for a less sweet cheesecake too.  Excellent and this one is saved to my recipe box!

This was an outstanding recipe.  I got rave reviews.  I am not much of a baker but found this very easy.  My cake did crack on the top but since I added a topping it didn't matter.  I believe the cracking had something to do with high altitude (Denver) and I will try to shorten the time the recipe calls to cook at 200 degrees to see if that helps.

I have made this twice now and it is wonderful! This time I stirred cocoa powder into half of the cheesecake filling and then swirled it with the plain filling.  I served it with a rapberry puree I made.  It was great. I recieved so many compliments on it when I made it for a party. Everyone loved it. This cheesecake is rich and creamy. I will be making this again and again.

My cheesecake was a bit hard though it is my own fault to forget the heavy cream..
The overall result was still nice and i add 10gr or coco powder in the batter.
The bottom was a tad tough but it's still ok..

I made this for our weekly "American Idol" party last night and it got rave reviews,probably the best reviews I have gotten on anything before.  The only thing that I changed was that I substituted half and half for the heavy cream, because I forgot to get it from the store.  I also served it with blueberry sauce.  Thanks!!  I will definitely use this one again.

The taste was absolutely fantastic!! Very rich and filling though!!! It was a little lumpy but I think that was because I was stuck using a old hand mixer. Next time I'll use my Kitchen Aid.

Overall hte cheesecake came out pretty good, and everyone liked it.  I had a hard time with the crust when i baked it, and i prefer a grahm cracker crust instead of what is used here. The filling tasted good, but mine was a little runny in the very center. I will make again, but with differen crust, and a few more minute in the oven. I also find it helpful to but a pan full of water under the cheesecake in the oven as it cooks.  It helps with the cracking.

Wonderful recipe!!  This was one of the dessert selections for our Christmas Eve dinner last night; everyone loved it and raved about it.  (The short dough crust is amazing.)  I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the batter after reading all of the other reviews, but otherwise I made this exactly as written...delicious cheesecake.  There was a crack or two on the top, but I always get those when I bake cheesecakes...they still always taste great and the texture remains perfect, not to mention that I always put some kind of topping on...the cracks are no big deal.  Last night I put cherry pie filling on top.  Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe...I agree...it makes the "definitive" cheesecake.

This is the absolute hands down best cheese cake recipe I have ever made. I made this for a christmas party and EVERYONE raved about it. Even one friend who is from New York and has been making cheesecakes for years loved this recipe and demanded that she have a copy. The only adjustment I added was vanilla. I am going to make this recipe again today, but I will need to adjust the bake time, as my cake could have used a few more minutes baking to be perfect. The taste was spot on, the texture was superb.

Amazing, crack-free cheesecake that turns your mouth into a cement mixer if you don't have it with a cup of coffee. I'm about to upload a pic.

This was a favorite when I made it for Thanksgiving. Instead of cream, I sub sour cream and added a little bit of Vanilla. I didnt have any problems with it cracking even with not taking the time to let the ingredients warm up to room temp. The crust was a little too thick for our taste. It was very easy to make, and will be making it again.

This was my first attempt at cheesecake.  I  thought it was easy enough to make, and the flavor was awesome.  My family all raved about it.  I did have some bad cracks, and my cooking time had to be shortened.  But overall, it was a great recipe.

Extremely good recipe. The only fault I had in it was:

The conversion of lbs to 8oz packages was extremely annnoying. I finally just gave up and went with 2 8oz packs of cheese. 

The cake itself was so big! Would have been so much better if it was more fit for a 8inch springform pan.

The shortbread was burnt more on the bottom's sides. Didn't really matter but would have been better had it been perfect.

Also annoying to get out of the springform pan. I dunno what I did wrong but I ending up just eating out of the pan.

This was the perfect cheesecake, and I have made many, many cheesecakes.  Do add the T of flour and pat the crust up the sides of the pan a bit.  I will use this recipe as my base for specialty cheesecakes now too.

followed the recipe to the letter it was an excellent cheesecake.  I do believe it needed more time in my oven.  I will try again with a longer baking time.

This is the best cheesecake in the world BUT I made a couple of mistakes. I didn't beat the cream cheese first then add the other ingredients, so my cheesecake turned out lumpy. I also opened the door to the oven, which gave it a crack in the middle.
I used a crumb crust for the base, which was fine.
I didn't add anything else to the recipe because it was sweet enough and absolutely the best tasting cheesecake I've ever had. So easy to make, if only I had done the filling correctly.
Can't wait to make it again !!

I like it! Not to mention my family really liked it as well. It only made it an hour or so in the fridge befoe my daughter and husband attacked it, so we only have half of it left for dessert tonight. The crust is very nice. I will use this type of crust from now on, very nice change from the same ole same ole with grahmn crackers. This is definitly a keeper!

Pretty easy to make. Nice crust.

Very tasty cheesecake. I made it in a 9x13 inch pan and should have adjusted the time as it over cooked a bit and it cracked. This was okay because I wasn't using it for a traditional cheesecake. My goal was to roll it into balls and dip them into melted chocolate (with cream). They were heavenly. I let the cheese cake warm up on the counter for about 20 minutes before rolling -still crumbled a bit when rolling and I got pretty messy. When I find the right recipe for rolling these little things, I'll post it as a recipe. Until then, I'm still experiementing (darn it, I have to eat my mistakes). But the flavor and consistancy of this cheesecake was lovely.

I love this recipe! My family prefers a graham crust, so I just substitute that, plus it saves some time.  My mom always bragged about her cheesecake but this has become the new standard in our family. It's pretty easy to make and always turns out well. I will have to try the chocolate and oreo suggestion, that sounds decadent!

the cheesecake didn't seem to bake
in the middle. I know you said it would be jiggly, but it was still that way when I served it the next day.I think there were too many eggs

This was the best cheese cake I have ever tasted! A little disappointed in the bottom crust it turned out hard and the spray oil made the sides of the cake come out too dark. Maybe I did something wrong, but I will continue to work on it. The cake is worth it!!!!

Great texture and taste. Only change I will make the next time I make this recipe is to use a little less sugar. I found it too sweet. My family disagreed with me however and thought it was perfect as it was.

I've never made a cheesecake.  I followed the directions exactly as written and it turned out fabulously.  It had one small crack in the top after if cooled, but it is as creamy as any cheesecake I've ever eaten. Thank you Sandy!!

THIS IS THE BEST CHEESE CAKE - EVER!! Very rich.    I was always afraid to try and make a real cheesecake BUT this recipe is easy to follow. I blend mine in the food processor. Comes out so smooth - like velvety.

This was by far the BEST cheesecake ever.  I had NEVER made a cheesecake from scratch before this one, and it was so simple and turned out fantastic.  I loved the crust and felt that it really made the whole cake just that much better!! YUM
