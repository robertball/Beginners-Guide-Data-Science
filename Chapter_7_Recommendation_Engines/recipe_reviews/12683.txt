This was very good. The filling / topping is DELICIOUS! The minty-ness is not overpowering, but rather subtle. Rather than make a whole "pie", I made individual "bites" by spooning the brownie mix into mini-muffin tins before baking (one pkg brownie mix makes about 30 minis). When they were done, I pressed a well into the center of each (while still warm). Topped with the filling and one Junior Mint candy on top of each.(I put the filling into a gallon ziploc bag & cut a bit off the corner so I could "pipe" the filling into the brownie cups) Brought them to two parties, and received many compliments. Thanks for the recipe

I think this pie would be better without the coffee.  There is a little bit too much going on with all the flavors.  Its simple to make.  The only difficult thing is that you can't find a brownie mix that is 13 ounces these days which makes for a really thick "crust".  Not that my guests minded too much.  Next time I will leave out the coffee and see if this is better.

I thought this recipe was just OK.  It wasn't nearly minty enough, in my opinion, and it was so rich we all could only eat a few bites (there were a lot of plates with half-eaten pieces, which I hate to see after that much work).   I didn't use the coffee because I didn't have any on hand.  I'm not sure if that would have improved the flavor or just made the mint even less noticable.   I wouldn't make this pie again.  It wasn't awful, but I'd rather find another recipe for next time with more mint and less heaviness.

I made this for my daughter's bday party. Very tasty, and not too sweet. I decorated it with some Junior Mints. Be sure to refrigerate...I made this a bit too close to party time (I didn't realize the topping would be so soft!), so I put it in the freezer for 2 hours. Will make again.

This was good. I found a 10 oz Duncan Hines brownie mix that comes in a pouch and baked it in a 8X8 inch pan. It work really well for a nice thin base layer. I thought the idea of using a brownie for a base kept it unique and work well balancing the flavors. I kept the filling the same except I omitted the coffee. I placed 1/2 cup of Junior Mints in the freezer to harden them and then cut them in peices to place on top. This pie was really sweet so small peices are plenty.
