Used 9 eggs only- no egg whites. Also I'm not sure what turkey ham is but I just used some left over deli turkey. I filled the muffin tins about halfway so only made 12 but I'm very pleased with how they came out. I will be doing this again!

This was great!  I didn't use  egg whites but added cooked chopped  broccoli and a cup of shredded cheese . Fresh onion instead of powder, 1/4  cup of salsa instead of jalapeno. Very easy and a tasty spin on eggs.  Will absolutely make again!

Great recipe. We raise our own chickens so we are always looking for new ways to cook our endless supply of eggs! :) I did use bacon as the meat, because that is what we had on hand. Another great thing is, you can make these on the weekend and have leftovers for week day breakfasts and they reheat perfectly. Healthy, too! :)

This is a perfect base recipe that you can customize for your preferences. I added yellow squash, store bought fresh salsa ( we love tomatoes!), cilantro and sprouted mung beans. The beans added a nutty crunchy flavor that was awesome and also a lot more protein to keep you going in the morning!!  Thanks for this delish recipe!

These were delicious and my family raved about it!  I did make a few modifications based on our tastes.  I made it using 1 lb of pork breakfast sausage instead.  I fried up the sausage and then softened the peppers in the fry pan as well.  I also chopped up the spinach into smaller pieces.  I found I only had to add 2 cups of egg whites to the mixture to get 24 "muffins".  Finally, I topped each "muffin" with a bit of marbled cheddar cheese. Yummy!

I made this for breakfast today -- super easy and I will likely continue to adjust the recipe for Thanksgiving breakfast since it was so easy and could be 'finger food'.  I altered the recipe down to 4 eggs (no egg whites), diced onions, bell pepper, and chopped up veggie burger.  I added salsa as one user suggested (great idea!), chopped rosemary and basil, salt and pepper.  tossed it in the muffin tin and ready in 20 minutes.  Delicious and super easy.

This recipe made the eggs too dry. The cooking time needs to be shortened: twenty mins proved about right and my oven is not over hot. Very healthy, but I would need to adjust to make again.

I changed up the ingredients a bit and customized for my guests. I also added some milk, baking powder and flour to make them extra fluffy. These were a big hit!

Used 3 orange peppers, 2 teaspoons of garlic powder instead of minced garlic, used frozen kale that was on hand, used chopped turkey sausage,  1 grated carrot, approx 1 cup shredded cheddar, and 2 tablespoons of Chia seeds. omitted the Italian seasoning.  Made 36. Plan to freeze and keep as an easy breakfast for my kids.  Tastes great!

Should have gotten liquid egg whites. At the end mixed in for half the egg whites mixed in egg beaters. Does overflow while baking, put a tray under it. Wholesome and looks preety

Great make-a-head breakfast. My muffins did stick. Thought it may have been the darker muffin pan so switched to traditional and they still stuck. Other than that I liked the recipe. I substituted browned breakfast sausage and used sauteed onion and peppers along with Tuscan style spices. I will try these again and will read comments to see if there is a "secret" to getting them not to stick.

I should have picked up egg whites like others suggested. And I also should have chopped the spinach into smaller pieces. Otherwise: delicious! I ended up with extra so I made an egg loaf with a bread tin (out of muffin tins, ha!) and I left that in for an additional ten minutes to cook. Very tasty; I look forward to an easy breakfast for the next few days!

I loveeeed these little amazing things! SO EASY and SO good. I made a few changes...(with what ingredients I had in the fridge)...I simply cooked up some crispy hash browns with onion and a touch of jalapeno, scooped into muffin tins, added cheddar and a cracked egg and baked. So filling and perfect for breakfast. Next time I will try adding crumbled sausage or bacon..YUM:)

Very tasty and easy to eat - warm or cold..spread the warmed eggie on toast or an english muffin. I made 12 muffins and used 11 medium eggs and a splash of water - I find that placing half the veg on the bottom of the muffin cup, then half the egg, the cheese (or vegan cheese), rest of the veg and then the rest of the egg mix. - these freeze well once cooled.

This came out great.  I don’t usually stray from a recipe I find on here too much, but for this one, I added broccoli, mushrooms, grape tomatoes and fresh mozzarella, as I had some I needed to use up.  I used a large rectangular pan as I planned to cut them into squares and use for quick breakfasts all week.  It came out really tasty!  Thanks.
