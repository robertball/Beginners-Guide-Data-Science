Excellent recipe. I served this tonight for dinner and my family loved it. I used the entire 28 oz. of the green chile enchilada sauce and did not have a soupy casserole. Here's how I prepared this recipe: I used a 9x13 baking dish and greased it with Crisco. To save time, I used two boxes of Tyson's diced chicken breast meat located in the freezer section at the grocery store. I cooked the chicken breast meat in a skillet and used cooking shears to further cut up the diced chicken meat. I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt as instructed. I did not char my tortillas. I tore each tortilla into about 6 pieces. After placing 1/2" of sauce on the bottom of the baking dish, I placed the rest of the sauce into a pie plate to coat the remaining torn tortilla pieces as instructed. I did not pour any of the sauce onto the layers. I found that coating all the remaining torn tortilla pieces completely soaked up all the sauce. Maybe that is how I avoided a soupy casserole as others have experienced. I don't know that for sure though. I added the sour cream to the cooked chicken and mixed it up. I found the mixed chicken and sour cream mixture easier to spread than trying to spread sour cream on top of the chicken and shredded cheese. After baking, I let it sit for about 10 minutes before serving. I am delighted to have found this recipe. I hope you try it.I served this with spanish rice and warmed tortilla chips.

Have made this twice - once following the recipe exactly, which I am rating three stars as it was bland and lacked significant flavor.  Secondly, I would give it a five based on changes made to the recipe:  1.)  Sauteed red and green bell pepper, white and red onion and fresh garlic together, then chopped the veggies in large pieces and added a handful of fresh cilantro.  2.)  Parboiled the chicken in chicken stock, onion and garlic and then cut into mouth size pieces.  3.)  Mixed the veggies in with the chicken and added a 4 ounce can of salsa verde.  4.)  Added one packet of chicken taco seasonings, 2 teaspoons of cumin, and one small can of green chilis to the chicken/ veggie mix.  5.)  Added the sour cream to the chicken/ veggie mixture to make spreading easier.  6.)  Used 9 green chili corn tortillas and 9 chipolte corn tortillas in place of regular corn tortillas.  7.)  Used a mix of Monterey and Pepper Jack cheese in lieu of straight Monterey Jack.  8.)  Let it cook 30 minutes more than the recipe stated to avoid the soupiness other reviewers remarked on.  9.)  Added another 1/2 cup of cheese during the last 30 minutes of cook time.  Waited until the cheese started to bubble and brown!  And a big plus - if you like freezing casseroles, this one is a perfect one to try as I couldn't tell the difference between the one I made and cooked the same day and the one I froze.  Definitely a keeper and worthy of 5 stars with the listed alterations.

This recipe is GREAT!  I made this recipe twice.  The first time I made it exactly the way the directions told me to except I did't char the tortillas, and it didn't turn out soupy or bland,  It was perfect.  The second time I charred the tortillas, and after cooking the tortilla's turned to mush.  It was still yummy, but didn't look nice.  So I think I just won't char the tortilla's next time.  I would definitely mix the chicken with the sour cream like other reviews suggested.  It is too hard to spread the sour cream over the cheese.  My favorite mexican dish at restaurants is Enchiladas Verdes, and this recipe can hold it's own against the best Enchiladas Verdes I've ever had before.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Delicious!! My husband and I liked this alot. He had 3 servings! This was so simple to make and clean up was minimal! So much quicker and easier than making enchiladas the old fashioned way. It wasn't runny, mushy, or "ugly looking" at all. I took the advice of other users and mixed the chicken with the sour cream before adding it to the dish. I also skipped the charring of the tortillas. I guess that's why the tortillas didn't turn out mushy. I added chopped green onions and it gave it some extra flavor. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing and will definitely be making this again!!  UPDATE: It's been 2 years since my review. I add Mexican season or taco seasoning to the chicken & sour cream mixture. It makes it even more flavorful. Sometimes I make it with red sauce, sometimes green. Instead of baking the chicken, I boil it in a pot of water and add 1 clove of garlic to the water to give the chicken a little bit more flavor. I love this recipe so much. I make this for parties and friends. I have coworkers actually request that I make this for them sometimes. Try this recipe, you won't regret it!

Oh My Goodness!!!! This was such a big hit! We had friends over for a Dinner/Game Night with a Mexican theme (b/c I am Hispanic) and EVERYONE LOVED THIS DISH!!! I am very bias when it comes to Mexican food, but I gave this one a try, and I'm so glad I did. I used both Medium Green Chili Sauce, and Mild Red Sauce. I also boiled the chicken with Garlic Salt (as suggested by others) and then shredded and added a dash of red pepper (cheyenne) to the chicken. And I also mixed it with the sour cream. I started with Green sauce on the bottom, and then alternated between the green and red. I also did not char the tortillas. I cut in 4th's. 
I cannot rave enough about the casserole. It was so yummy! And everyone wanted the recipe.

I Love this recipe!  I made a couple of adjustments to make it work better for me.  I grilled my chicken on my George Foreman and browned my tortilla's in a skillet on the stove.  My husband asked me to add black olives.  I used 20 oz of the chile sauce.  It was absolutely wonderful.  Thank you!  Thank you!

I began making this dish a few years ago. I add in lots of cilantro, a 1/2 TBSP of lemon juice, one jalapeno and blend it with the store bought green enchilada sauce for improved flavor. Alternately, you can make your own green enchilada sauce by simply boiling tomatillos (they look like green tomatoes - remove the skins first, wait until they become blistered and blend in blender). This is my most requested recipe at all social events. This is a must make!!!!

This is a quick and easy recipe.  I used precooked chicken to save time that I just diced quickly.  I put the 1/2 inch of sauce in the bottom of a greased 9x13 pan and then added whole tortillas that I dipped in the remaining enchilada sauce.  I mixed the chicken and sour cream together and spread over the tortillas.  On the final layer I poured the remaining sauce over the tortillas.  I covered with foil and baked.  I didn't add the cheese on top until the very end because I was afraid it would burn.

I was too hungry to bake the chicken so I cooked it on the stovetop. Since I was too hungry to let it cool before shredding the chicken, I chopped it up with my food chopper. I skipped the charring step since I don't have  a gas stove but I tore tortillas into fourths as suggested. WOW! This recipe was great!! My fiance and I both loved it and almost finished the whole pan in one sitting. I'll definetely make this again.

I gave it 2 stars because it didn't taste right as written and I thought had unnecessary steps.
First, greasing the dish was not necessary...there's nothing to stick. The first layer is sauce. Secondly, baking the whole breasts adds too much time to your dish and is less flavorful. I dice up the chicken and saute it which is quicker and more of the chicken is exposed to your spices. A carne asada spice is preferred. And as the writer explained, I would pass on any charring and tearing, both unnecessary. Te charring would get lost in the dish and there is no need to tear. Just layer the bottom of the dish with tortillas. Then as directed, layer sauce, tortillas, chicken cheese, tortillas, sauce, etc...3 layers works best and then top with cheese. Finally, I would most definitely leave out layers of sour cream. That much dairy inside this dish is problematic. Dollops on top just before you serve seems to be a better choice. I also like to top with some chopped green onion and diced tomato. Also, I usually bake it about 30 minutes. Everything is pretty much cooked and just needs to be heated some. All this will taste better and save you about half the time. TY and Good Luck.

YUMM!!!  I added a packet of taco seasoning to the sour cream as was suggested, and it added great flavor.  Instead of baking, I boiled a small chicken and shredded half of it.  using the amt. of sour cream in the recipe, I ran out for the top layer and used more.  That might be because I used a 9x13 casserole dish, but the rest of the ingredients were proportional.  My picky hubby loves this!

Oh my gosh this was so delicious!  I will never make enchiladas the traditional way ever again.  You get more bang for your buck with this one.  I had all day to make it so I went the extra mile and cooked the chicken in the crock pot with a bottle of tomatillo salsa.  Then I mixed the shredded chicken with the sour cream and added a can of diced green chiles.  I cut the tortillas into 4ths and then coated them in the green sauce.  I did not pour more sauce over the layers and I'm glad I didn't.  It was absolutely perfect.  Not soupy, not dry and oh so heavenly.  Oh I did add some chili powder and cumin to my chicken mixture and I also topped the whole thing off with green onions and black olives.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanx!

Love this with some changes ~ I slow cook eight breasts and thighs when I have time (four and four) along with diced large onion, minced garlic - four to six, one jar of salsa, four tbsp taco seasoning and two cans of corn. Shred and split into two batches, use one next day and freeze the othe for future use as tacos, burritos or for this. It'll keep frozen for eight months.
Leave the sour cream for ba topping make as otherwise direct. Top dish with broken tortilla chips, green onions, diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, sliced black olives and sour cream.
Fantastic.

This is a great starter recipe - I started with cooking onions and garlic in olive oil until soft, then added that to shredded chicken (store bought roast chicken) along with spinach and added the sour cream.  I also added some red enchilada sauce to it (maybe 1/2 cup).  it was fantastic.  On leftover day, i poured more of the red enchilada sauce on top to keep it moist and loved that flavor as well.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I read over the review and made my revisions. I added 1 teaspoon of cumin...a must in my opinion. Also I added a small can of green chiles. I also added some fresh seeded roma tomatos diced to the chicken sourcream mixture. I also mixed those things together to make it easier to spread. I added black olives to the mixture as well. I thought this had great flavor and I would make it again

I used leftover pork carne adovada in this recipe--I think using a pre-spiced meat is key to making this good. I fried my corn tortillas in oil and drained them on paper towels before using them. I added chopped onion to the filling. This was simple and easy--it literally was all put together in a half hour. No leftovers.

This can be also be done in the crock pot. The whole round corn tortillas fit nicely in layers in the crock pot. I assemble everything in the morning, turn the crock pot on low and voila dinner when I get home from work. This is my go to recipe for the leftover store bought rotisserie chicken.

This turned out fabulous..but I did make some changes based on other reviews. I saved time by buying a rotisserie chicken from Wal-mart and shredding it. I mixed a pack of low sodium taco seasoning and the sour cream with the chicken and chopped up about a half cup of cilantro and added it to the chicken mix. I did not char the tortillas or tear them I just used about 12 total. I also use Cabot's cheese for a little less fat and calories. After 40 minutes I uncovered and cooked an additional 15 minutes. Turned out beautifully!

Excellent!  Using some of the tips: I used flour tortillas (instead of corn) and didn't grill them, cut into sixths (this made it much easier to serve), dipped them in the green sauce, added a can of sweet corn and a prepared package of Spanish rice (divided into equal amounts on each layer), mixed a packet of taco seasoning into the sour cream then mixed the sour cream with the chicken (which I boiled instead of broiled then shredded) before layering.  This is a new family favorite.

Stop reading reviews and start making this!
I used red enchilada sauce and it was still fantastic.

Loved, loved, LOVED this dish.  I did make some changes though.  I was in a hurry, so I bought a roasted chicken from the store and had my kids shred it.  I didn't char the tortillas either.  Instead I just torn them up.  Poured the sauce in the bottom of the pan, and since I saw that many reviewers thought this was a bit bland, decided to use some spicy/jalapeno refried beans.  Here's what I did.  1. Sauce 2. torn up tortillas, 3. spread a can of beans, 4. chicken mixed with sour cream, 5. the cheese, then baked.  This process went very fast. I think next time I will add some black olives, only becasue I love black olives.  I did change this up, but you gave me the idea.  Thanks so much for the post.  I will do this again and again.

We loved this dish! As reviewers suggested: I mixed the chicken, sour cream, a handful of chopped cilantro, 1 tbs lemon juice, dash of cayenne pepper in a bowl. Doing this made assembly easy. I did not char the tortillas. Since a 28 oz can was not available, I used 2- 10 oz cans green sauce and one red (red on top layer). It turned out fantastic. I will serve this again and again!

Great flavor!  Husband and I both liked this!  I used 3 chicken breasts instead of 4 and 2-10oz cans green enchilada sauce instead of 1-28oz, 10 corn tortillas instead of 18 and 8oz sharp cheddar, 4oz M. Jack, and 4oz pepper jack.  I baked in 2 Qt. rectangular dish for 45 minutes.  Important to allow to set for atleast 10 minutes.  Will make again except will probabaly roll up into enchiladas to improve appearance.  Also, good to use a cheese mix including cheddar to add some color.

Yummy! My hubby and I really enjoyed this. I halved the recipe. First, I cooked the chicken on the stove with the garlic salt & TSP of EVOO. I mixed my diced chicken with the sour cream and added 1 tsp of taco seasoning to the mixture. Layered 1 small can of enchilada sauce on bottom, followed by torn tortillas, then chicken mixture, then cheese in 8X8 dish. Covered and baked 45 minutes. Served w/ Spanish rice.

My mom used to make these with ground beef. (Of course, you have to brown the meat first!) For the chicken recipe, it's much quicker to boil the chicken and season it after you shred it.

This is very good. My husband loves tortilla casserole, but I made a few changes that I may skip next time. I used 4 chicken breasts for just the two of us and it was 2 too many. It was yummy, but he thought it tasted too much like regular enchiladas. Next time I am going to cut back on the chicken a bit and add more torillas. All in all it was fantastic!

My Chickies love green chile enchiladas way more than red.  I make my one homemade green chile sauce with anaheims and pasillo peppers and freeze it to use in this recipe.

Every time I make this it is a smashing success. Several people always ask for the recipe. I cook my chicken in the crockpot and sometimes use an additional can of green enchilada sauce since I make mine in two dishes. I make the recipe in two square 9 x 9 glass dishes. I keep one to serve my family and use the other to take to a covered dish meal or a meal to someone in need. I have even frozen one for use later.

I hate leaving bad reviews, but my family could not eat this. It turned into a big pile of mush. I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and didn't char the tortillas. I also only used about 3/4 of the enchilada sauce, trying to avoid a soupy consistency. Unfortunately, the texture for us was just unpalatable.

This is my go to enchilada recipe.  Don't skip charring the tortillas.  It makes the dish look so authentic.  I do one thing different to save time.  I mix the sour cream with the chicken.

Really like the base recipe. I spice it up quite a bit by adding taco seasoning and green chilies to the chicken. Very yummy. Quick and easy. Also I just tore the tortillas into pieces and didn't have any problem with it being to runny or the tortillas being to too dry. Delicious.

My family loves this recipe. I use the ingredients listed, but tear the tortillas into about 6 pieces and don't char. I also mix both sour cream and enchilada sauces together and add dried onion or chopped green onions to the sauce, then stir in everything else except the cheese, which tops it. We always have this after Thanksgiving or having a turkey meal. It's a great way to use leftover turkey.

I had to rate a 3 because I made some changes.  I used 3 chicken breasts - boiled and shredded. 4 oz cream cheese & 4 oz sour cream with 1pkg dry Taco Seasoning.  Mix chicken, cream cheese, sour cream, taco seasoning.  Add 1 can Fiesta Corn, some chopped black olives, 1 can green chili.  Mix all together and follow the layering process with enchilada sauce & tortillas.  I only had sharp cheddar on hand and it tasted just fine.  I did not toast the tortillas i ripped in half and then smaller pieces to fill spaces.  I covered and baked for 30 mins and the last 15 I uncovered.  It came out great with little mushiness.  This qty makes a large 9x13 baking dish.  Next time I will halve recipe to make 8x8 - one dinner for 4.  Kids loved it, so did the adults! :) I will make this again.  Good recipe for a gathering.  Thanks for the idea. :)

Well I wasn't planning on making this recipe, I had my eye on something else, when I realized after sprinkling all my chicken breast with garlic salt, chili powder and roasted ground cumin, that the recipe I was working on was lacking a huge ingredient that couldn't be possible to make....so this was a quick fix to my recipe diaster. So I left the chicken like it was and baked it per these instructions. But as this recipe was fairly easy to follow, it confused me a little. The ingredients say"18 (6 inch) corn tortillas, torn in half" then in step 4, it says arrange 6 tortillas in a single layer.....well to me I'm thinking 6 torn pieces. but then it didn't add up right, So I did the 12 torn pieces over lapping. I didn't really feel that the steps for tearing the tortillas in half or charring them over the stove was totally necessary after I had already done that. Because they were getting baked anyway. But I did follow the recipe to a T with the exception I previously mentioned about the chicken. But will say, it was a great enhancement to the recipe I might add. While it was simple to make, cutting and serving it lacked appeal to me, but the taste was outstanding. So ya can't judge the gross looking casserole when it tasted really really good. Thank you I will make it again, exactly the way I made it. Thanks.

Great recipe, I couldn't find green, so I used red enchilada sauce, which was spicier.  I also added a can of black beans which added some great fiber.

Very similar to a dish I made up myself a few weeks ago, except I used corn taco shells broken in half, and salsa verde from Trader Joe's.  Also added a diced onion and a can of drained black beans along w/the chicken. Hubs doesn't like sour cream, so left that out and added it to mine after cooking.  Cilantro would be great too - will try that next time. Very much like enchiladas verdes, but gluten free, and less work in casserole form.  It was great!

I have tried this recipe several times and it is a delicious recipe as is!  It is VERY simple as written.  The thing I love about this recipe is you can use any type of chicken, cut, ripped, baked boiled, or rotisserie.  It all works.  You can mix the sour cream with the chicken, which I too prefer, or dollop it on. I do find Jack Cheese is best and melts great in this recipe, but again that is personal preference.  I might throw in some Mozzarella next time, but I do love it with white cheeses... pairs really well with the mild taste of Green Enchilada sauce.  Top with Green Onion and sliced Black Olives YUM!  I like Salsa and Sour Cream on the side for guests so they can add to taste.

I stumbled across this recipe just now and saw that it's basically the same recipe I've been making for years, only my recipe includes a small can of chopped olives, a 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder, and a small chopped onion, and I like to throw in a can of diced green chilies. The recipe is basically the same, but the preparation is a bit different. I mix the sauce, cheese (saving 2 cups of cheese for top), sour cream and chicken in a very large bowl, and then I tear up the corn tortillas into pieces (without any charring), and fold them into  the mixture. I spread it in a 9x13 casserole dish and sprinkle remaining cheese on top. I bake uncovered at 350 for 30 minutes or until bubbly and then let it sit for 5 minutes before serving. You can't get easier and it is delicious! This has been in our regular rotation since I came across it 5 years ago. My husband loves it, my picky kids love it, and everyone I've ever served it for has loved it. When I'm super crunched on time, I've used 2 cans of chicken (even though I really don't like canned chicken) instead of cooking 4 breasts, and onion flakes (hydrating the flakes before adding) and it's still very delicious and even quicker to prepare. I would be lost without this recipe!

Family RAVED!!!!!  I used leftover cooked chicken meat which cut down the prep time significantly.  I also fried the corn tortillas in a little oil until soft and drained them on papertowels to soak up the exces oil.  It came together quickly and tasted delicious!  Served with my favorite Spanish Rice recipe and my favorite refried beans recipe!  The kids topped theirs with sour cream but in my opinion it doesn't need it.  It's rich and creamy on it's own and YUM-YUM-YUMMY!

This is my first bad review and I hate to leave one but I made this especially for my fiance'. He loves mexican food and enjoys casseroles.  He could not eat it.  The texture was a soupy, sloppy mess.  I followed the recepe exactly except I cut it in half.

This is awesome - did not char tortillas and mixed the chicken and sour cream together and it turned out great.  The only thing I will do next time is use a little less sauce - a little soupy for me.

Very good! I made this for the second time tonight and my fiance absolutely loved it. I seasoned the chicken with garlic and onion powders, then grilled on the George Foreman. Shredded it, then mixed in fat free sour cream. I followed the steps, except that I soaked all the tortillas in the enchilada sauce, not just the top layer. I did not add any sauce in between the layers and the casserole was not at all soupy. It held together very well. Thank you! :)

Love this recipe but I tweaked it a little.  I deboned a rotisserie chicken already cooked from store.  Added a can of chopped green chilies and used plain Fayo Greek yogurt in place of sour cream. I tore corn tortillas in quarters.   It rocked! Will def make again.

I used this as a base recipe. I like more veggies especially when therebis this much dairy. I chopped up a red pepper, I onion, 1 jalapeños with seeds removed and added 1 can dieced green chilies. I boiled my chicken with 3 gloves of garlic and a jalapeño with seeds for flavor then added the chicken into my sauté pan with veggies. I did everything else the same. It was really tasty! Because there is only 2 of us I used 2 9×9 pan's and froze one.

So good!! The main thing I changed was cook the chicken overnight (or at least 5-6 hours) in the crockpot with a jar of salsa or enchilada sauce. The chicken is DELICIOUS and so easy. Then drained chicken and add sautéed red, orange, green peppers and a little onion. Mix sour cream in with chicken and peppers. My whole family, including my very picky son, loved the flavor. Thanks for this recipe!

Made this for the first time for a potluck picnic and it was a HIT. I halved the recipe, 2.5 quart casserole dish, boiled the chicken instead of baking (first time!), and mixed the sour cream with chili powder (so good, do try), did not char the tortillas but tore them - turned out perfect. Try to leave a few tortillas at the top next to the casserole dish for some extra crispiness. Next time I will make my own salsa verde (tomatillos, white onion, cilantro, season from there) as the canned one I used was too spicy but this has nothing to do with this particular recipe. Thank you so much! Yummy, comforting, and delicious.

I made this for our block party and it was a hit!  I also added taco seasoning to the chicken and sour cream mixture and 2 sm. cans red enchilada sauce and one can green.  My kids don't like things that are green! =)  I also used 6 chicken breast, 4 wasn't enough.  Thanks for sharing!  The kids already want me to make it again!

I should have read more reviews before I made this, but it was pretty good. I have a few suggestions: I would use a bit less enchilada sauce, i would NOT put the sour cream in it because it ends up looking gross. I will only put sour cream on top as a garnish next time. Also I will bake in a 9 x 13 dish next time instead of a medium sized baking dish. 
Very easy to make and my husband liked it!

This was good and fairly simple to make. I think we would prefer a red enchilada sauce, but that is just a difference of taste.

These were very good.  I took readers advise and boiled the chicken breast with a clove of garlic.  After boiling, I shredded chicken and added about four tablespoons of sour cream to the chicken.  I poured 1/2 inch green sauce into baking dish, torn corn tortillas, layered with chicken/sour cream mix, and shredded jack cheese, placed more torn corn tortillas on top, then topped with the rest of the enchilada sauce and cheddar cheese. Was great!

I felt this recipe was average. First off, this recipe is nowhere near quick. I decided to make it tonight after a long day at work and limited time before hubby, the kids and i are off to bed. However, prep and cook time combined, it took about two hours. That is not what i consider quick. It did lack in flavor. My biggest regret was adding the sour cream to the layers and then baking it. We would have much rather it have been on top of the casserole, because then you have that cool creaminess instead of warm curdled sour cream. I think next time i will just stick with plain old enchiladas. Sour cream is a topper!!

Very tasty, not so quick if prepared as written.  That being said, I have made it twice now.  This time I didn't char the tortillas and I mixed the enchilada sauce and sour cream together and added a can of low fat cream of chicken soup and a can of diced green chiles.  I also cut the chicken into tiny chunks and cooked them in a skillet with garlic powder and a bit of seasoning salt and paprika.

You should have seen the look on my husband's face when he put the first bite in his mouth -- I'm pretty sure he fell in love with me all over again!  I used 2 pounds ground chicken.  I mixed the sour cream with the cooked chicken and added 3 tsp. of dried cilantro.  I recommend you take the time to char the tortillas over an open flame.  This step adds great flavor/character to this dish.  I will definitely make this casserole time and time again.  Thank you!

This is very similar to the way I make enchilada casserole.  I boil then shred the chicken breasts, I dip tortillas in hot oil for a second on each side to soften, then drain on paper towels, I dip the tortillas in the enchilada sauce and layer them and then I mix sour cream with the chicken and put a layer of that followed with cheese, and then I reapeat the layers, ending with tortillas on the top.  I also sprinkle a little cilantro between the layers for extra flavor.  After baking we cut this into squares and serve with sour cream, diced tomatoes, black olives and cilantro on top.  So yummy!

We really liked this!  Here are my tweaks:  I used hot red enchilada sauce instead of green because the store didn't have green; I used pre-cooked Purdue chicken because I'm lazy.  I charred the tortillas on my electric stove, using med-high heat and laying the tortillas directly on the burner, 30 seconds per side - toxic?  Yeah, probably, but I thought it added a nice touch of texture to the finished product.  After adding the base layer of sauce, I mixed the chicken and sour cream together, added garlic salt to taste, and layered them with quartered charred tortillas dipped in the leftover sauce.  (I halved the recipe because there are only two of us; only used 8 tortillas and a 15-oz can of sauce, and almost didn't have enough sauce.)  Finally, I added some sliced pickled jalepenos on top, because what isn't improved by sliced pickled jalepenos?  The finished result was not at all soggy, and was, in fact, delicious.  The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because I don't get how any recipe that takes 45 minutes to bake can possibly be considered "quick."

This one is definitely worth all 5 stars. Tastes great and easy to make. I used ground turkey instead of the chicken and I did not char the tortillas but tore them as Tracy suggested. This made it even quicker and easier. I had a smaller can of sauce than what the recipe called for and I was afraid that it would be too dry, so I used about 6 oz of salsa too. It was actually just right. Not soupy at all. Thanks to Tracy for sharing and to all who previously reviewed for their suggestions.

Tried this for the first time last evening....YUMMY! And very easy to put together. Everyone who tasted it gave it 5-stars. However I did not bake the chicken but poached it in a bit of water seasoned with salt, taco seasoning and Emeril's Essence (saving time and energy costs). Next time I may kick it up a notch and use half pepper jack cheese and half regular jack...I like spicy stuff! Thanks for 'a keeper' Tracy!

I too modified this due to what I had on hand. I had a 10 ounce can of mild enchilada sauce so I used it sparingly, but it still came out great. I shredded the cooked chicken and mixed it with the low fat sour cream and a half pack of taco seasoning. I only used two tortillas for each layer and dipped them in the enchilada sauce individually. I poured the little remaining over the top. I also covered with shredded cheese and baked uncoverd which gave it a nice crispy top if you like that sort of thing. This was so easy and so yummy! I will make it often.

OMG!!  This recipe was SO GOOD!!  And easy!!  Since their are only two of us, I did make a few modifications but tried to stay as true to the recipe as possible.  Instead of chicken breasts, I used the meat from a precooked  rotisserie chicken instead and omitted the garlic salt.  Tore 6 corn tortillas into quarters, used a 15 ounce can green chile enchilada sauce, used 8 ounce package shredded Monterrey Jack cheese, and 1/2 carton--4 ounces--sour cream.  Followed recipe to layer ingredients and baked at same temp/time suggested.  Again, could not have dreamed how good this would be!  Thank you so much for posting!!!

Loved it!!  We were so excited to try it, I forgot to take a picture before we dug in.  There are a few things I'd modify. I will marinate the chicken overnight then cook it next day in a covered roaster as I found the meat to come out a little dry & not really seasoned on the inside just by baking it. I also ran out of the chile sauce (large can) so I dumped a  can of Rotelle on top of the final layer and it was delicious!!!  I also used an lock of Monterey Jack cheese and cut it up instead of the shredded cheese that tends to disappear.  Recipe was easy and quick!  And really really delicious!!!  This will become a part of the dinner time meal rotations.

We travel alot in our rv . It was nice to have something that I would make at home with more space to cook.
It was easy to make & at very little cost. I was able to buy all the things to make this dish ( except the boneless chicken) at the .99cent store. The whole mael had a cost of about 6.50 to make. And it tasted very good . I made some rice and a salad fed for people . And I cut the recipe in half. Full recipe makes alot .I am going to pass thing on to all my friends.

LOVE this recipe!!! I make it two different ways. One I use a rotisserie chicken...they are my go to for all things chicken! The 2nd is a packaged Fajita Chicken Strips. I just chop them up! Already tons of flavor in both. Hubby is not a sour cream fan so I leave that out and put a nice dollop on mine when I serve it. I also skip charring the tortilla's. You can't taste it so it's an extra step for me. Awesome recipe and a lot of different things you can do to make it your own.

I made this for the 1st time for everyone at work. I'm not a big cook but it looked easy so I gave it a try. I did add some chopped green onions sprinkled over the sour cream layer. Everyone loved it and 3 people asked for the recipe too! A definite crowd pleaser! Thank you

I made this except I put a pork roast in the crockpot with onions, garlic, salt, pepper and cumin. Shredded it up to layer in the place of the chicken.  The sour cream in the recipe just makes it something a little more special.

LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! First of all, I greatly enjoy Mexican food so I was excited to try this recipe.  It was awesome - I baked it in a large glass baking dish and had enough leftovers that I was able to eat over the course of the next few nights.  The leftovers were just as delicious as when it came out of the oven.  It was easy & awesome.  Thank you for sharing I will definitely be making it again :)

Excellente!  Definitely don't skip charring the tortillas. Adds a nice smokey flavor and keeps the tortillas from turning to mush. If you don't have a gas burner, cook the tortillas in hot oil in a skillet for a minute or so.   I also added seasonings to the sour cream (cumin, red pepper flakes, cilantro, garlic) and mixed it with the chicken to make it easier to prep.  We all loved it!

I loved this recipe. As mentioned in other reviews, I mixed the chicken and the sour cream (along with some added cumin and paprika). It turned out fantastic! Will definitely make again.

I must say that I initially found this recipe to make for a quick potluck meal, because I didn't have time to roll up each individual enchilada.  With a few minor modifications, it has now become a regular "staple" meal in our home and for sharing with friends at parties and BBQs.
Since I am gluten-free, I only use corn tortillas, and I will sometimes add fat-free refried or black beans along with chopped green chilis, and I will sometimes omit the sour cream.  The recipe is fast, easy, and delicious, and if you bake and shred the chicken the night before, you can save yourself a ton of time.  (Oh, I also occasionally make the enchilada sauce from scratch).

I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it!  I knew I wanted to make it spicy- so I added a jalapeno, cilantro, and lemon to the store bought sauce. It really kicked it up a notch. As suggested in other reviews, I mixed the sour cream in with the chicken. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and I would totally recommend it. I used a 9 by 13 pan and I wouldn't recommend anything smaller or bigger - that size is perfect.

Easy and quick!  I followed other suggestions and coated chicken with sour cream before layering.  My green chile sauce that I bought didn't have much kick so I mixed in a small jar of green chiles.  Perfect served with spanish rice!

Really good except I used flour tortillas.  Do not do this - the texture is rather slimy.  The flavors are spot on.

Loved how great they tasted and how easy they were. I used a rotisserie chicken and layered  it all instead of rolling them individually. Tossed some taco seasoning in with the chicken and added some black beans. Wonderful.

I now make the casserole version instead of actual enchiladas because it is easier! My husband says, "It all goes to the say place!" Thank you to the poster of this recipe.
Some advice to everyone making this recipe, if you want to make it even better (yes, it is possible!) mix together the chicken and sour cream and some chopped onion. Also, get creative with the cheese. The second time I made this recipe I used 8oz Mexican blend and 8oz Pepperjack and it was so good.

Great recipe. I did "fry" the tortillas in top of the stove using Pam which I think adds to their flavor and eliminates the raw taste of corn tortillas.

This is a very good basic  recipe and we liked it. I read a lot of  the reviews  and I decided  this  recipe did need  a lot of seasoings.  I added  taco seasoning, cumin,cilantro and red pepper. I  cut  recipe to 4 servings and it still made a lot for 2 of us --( so leftovers) - I wish I could  of found  a 15 oz can of  sauce -- 2 10 oz  cans  was a little  too much,but hubby  likes this alot  so I will  be making it  again and will played around with the recipe --- thanks for sharing  your reicpe.

This recipe as written is neither quick nor easy. It is delicious though. A little bland for my taste, but my picky six year old ate it. I will make this again, but will probably try using precooked shredded chicken next time and maybe some additional spices that other reviewers suggested.

GREAT as it is! But ADD some spice like cumin :) Greek Non Fat yogurt instead of sr. cream. Some fresh fire roasted chilis.. and pass the fresh salsa with cilantro and lots of fire roasted tomatoes and chilis. Did I mention more chilis :) My foodie friends in Sante Fe gave this recipe a stamp of approval.

These were good.  I cooked my chicken in the crockpot with taco seasoning and tomatillo salsa for added flavor.  I appreciated the recommendation to dip the tortillas into the green sauce and not pour any extra sauce over the top.  I love my enchiladas saucy and it was plenty of sauce just dipping and the juice from the tomatillo salsa (I even had to drain alot of the juice off).  The kids didn't like it even though it wasn't spicy at all (and I even added a can of diced green chiles to the chicken mixture).  But that just left more for us.  Thanks for submitting!

Great Recipe. I cheated and used rotisserie chicken.  The only thing I would have added is olives. Will definitely be making this one again...super easy!

YUM. I made this recipe for my Mexican food loving boyfriend and he was in heaven! I made a few modifications, as others have suggested. I made a smaller version than this, and only used 6 corn tortillas total (2 on each layer, ripped in half and coated in the sauce). I used an already rotisseried chicken from the grocery store (major time saver) and shredded it myself. I mixed the chicken with sour cream and 1/2 a packet of chicken taco seasoning. I didn't grill my tortillas or add garlic salt to my chicken. I layered the casserole as specified but didn't pour extra sauce on the layers so it wouldn't get soupy. I just made sure to coat each tortilla while layering. I uncovered the dish at about 40 minutes and broiled the top to give the cheese a bubbled/browned look.   This was so good that I have already been asked to make it by a few friends and share the recipe! My boyfriend left me a note while I was at work saying that he wished I hadn't taken the leftovers myself because he planned on eating them!  This will be added to my meal rotation at home and it is also easy enough to make for potlucks!  Would also be easy to add veggies to this dish. I would add onion, mushrooms, tomatoes in the future!

This was delicious!  I used someone else's advice and stirred the sour cream in with the chicken, which seemed a little easier, and I also added a packet of taco seasoning for extra flavor. Oh, and I did not char the tortillas as I do not have a gas stove, I tore them into thirds and it was perfect. Will definitely become a regular in this household.

I made this the other night and it was super yummy! I read the reviews and added diced green chiles, and taco seasoning and about a tablespoon of hot sauce and it was so flavorful and good. I charred half of the tortillas and didn't with the other half, I didn't notice any difference, I did notice that charring adds a good depth of flavor to this dish though and so I would recommend doing that. Thanks for a great recipe!

GREAT recipe - delicious & so easy!  I bought four 6-oz pkgs of cooked strip chicked.  I cut it into small cubes, mixed it with the sour cream, adding approx 2 teas of garlic powder & 1 teas of ground cumin.  I poured half the can of green chile enchilada sauce into the bottom of the 9x13 pyrex, and layered shredded 9 corn tortillas (I did not char them) on top.  I soaked the other 9 shredded tortillas in the balance of the sauce.  In the pyrex, I then layered half the the chicken mixture, and covered it with half the cheese.  I repeated the layers: the balance of the tortillas in the green sauce they soaked in, the balance of the chicken mixture, the balance of the cheese.  Actually, I thought a 16-oz pkg of shredded cheese was too much - I will cut that back a little in the future.  Everything else - perfect!  It was not soggy or soupy at all, and boy it tasted Great!  This can easily be assembled in advance and refrigerated.  Remove from 'fridge, sit until closer to room temp, then baked 350 for 45 minutes.

The one major problem with this is the baking pan size we are instructed to use.  My dish overflowed in the oven and had a huge mess.  Let me suggest using a 9x13 baking pan, at the least, this should make nice green enchiladas.  I might try this again sometime, but definately use a larger baking dish.

Who would've know that combining a few simple ingredients could result is a great dinner like this?  It's easy, quick (I poached the chicken instead of baking it) and delicious.  I will make this one again!

I tried this recipe just to try and how different it was from the one I had received from one of my Hispanic neighbors.  First of all I made my own enchilada sauce.  Second, after shredding my chicken, I heated up a pan of oil which I deep- fried my tortilla.  After I finished deep frying, I took each tortilla and dipped it in my sauce and started layering my tortillas, filling each tortilla with Monterey Jack cheese and chicken.  I love my sauce hot and because I had put cheese on my tortilla and chicken, i didn't put as much on top.  I don't care for sour cream in my Mexican food when I cook so I totally ignored the ingredient.  I then poured the balance of my sauce on top.  Stuck it in the oven until the cheese melted.  Made some Spanish rice.  Meal was super.

It made a beautiful dish!  I found that it was a little bland. Next time I will spice up the chicken with taco seasoning and add some fresh tomatoes on top.

I just had this for dinner and it was fantastic! Like others have done, I mixed the chicken with the sour cream to make it easier to spread. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. This may be a new favorite for me -- so easy and fast.

Thought this was great!  Next time I make it I will use 3 chicken breasts instead.  I charred the tortillas, but won't next time to save time. I will also add the sour cream to the chicken as it is very difficult to spread over cheese. I added some chopped roasted green chilies I had stockpiled in the freezer in with the layers to add a bit more flavor. Definitely need a 9 by 13 pan as it was filled to the top. Shredding the chicken in the food processor is a huge time saver as well. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe for the most part with the exception of mixing the sour cream with the chicken. The other change was the night before I actually baked the casserole I  prepared the chicken by boiling it with a mixture of spices (cumin, chile powder, garlic powder, onion powder and salt). I then shredded it and refrigerated it until I was ready to put the dish together. I would make this again, but it seems like the type of green chili sauce could make or break this recipe. I might try it with red enchilada sauce next time. My 7 yo daughter really liked it.

This is great and my husband loves it so much I am popular tonight! I cooked the chicken with taco mix on it to seal the flavor. I put New Mexican green chilis, green onions,cilantro, Rotel to spice it up and bush's pinto beans in the layers. I didn't have alot of shredded cheese on hand so I used velveeta too and also replaced some of the sour cream with Fage yogurt since I was short on sour cream:) It's 9 miles to the store so sometimes we have to improvise.  I think this recipe is the bomb no matter replacements.

I thought the texture of this was excellent.  I didnt have a gas stove or grill so I just put the tortillas on a cast iron skillet and charred them that way.  I will make this again but next time I will season the chicken much more, and add some sauteed onions with garlic and peppers.  It was ok, it just needed more.

It was great!  My picky 6 year old even had seconds!!  It was a little soupy, I think next time I will use a little less enchilada sauce.  I also didn't char the tortillas, and they weren't firm so next time I will grill them.

We loved it! Made a few changes but nothing significant - didn't put the sour cream in the layers nor did I char the tortillas. I made a 1/2 recipe because I was only cooking for 2 and it was more than enough for leftovers for lunch the next day which is always great. This had a good flavor, was very moist and heated up well in the microwave.

We really enjoyed this casserole.  I added some sauteed green pepper, yellow pepper, and onion to the chicken mixture and mixed it all in with the sour cream.  I was glad I added the veggies in as they gave a nice flavor and added quite a bit to the dish.

I made the recipe as written and honestly it was very bland. Also the charring part took too long for me. So, I made it a second time and followed the advice of others and mixed a low sodium taco mix with the sour cream and then mixed it in with the shredded chicken. Then I chopped up (finely) 4 serreno peppers and mixed that (including the seeds) with the green enchilada sauce. It added a little kick but didn't make it really spicy or anything. And then I tried it with tearing the corn tortillas and skipping the charring process. Much better the second time around. Husband and father in law loved it.

Really good and really easy.  I did not char the tortillas.  Instead I took others advise and dipped them in the enchilada sauce before layering.  I also mixed the chicken and sour cream together to make it easier to spread.

This was delicious! I sauteed the chicken in a garlic and olive oil and shredded them up. I then sauteed chopped bell peppers and onions.  I tore up the tortillas into pieces,and set aside. I then mixed 1 can of cream of chicken with two cans of green enchilada sauce, 8 oz sour cream, and 1 can of green chiles. I mixed everything together and poured in a 9x12 in pan, topped with cheese and voila! Easy and so good.

How I wish I had read all reviews before making this one!  The "prep time" listed of 30 minutes is incredibly inaccurate:  If you are supposed to char 36 tortilla halves for 1 minute each... Well, you can do the math. 

I made this recipe exactly as directed except I didn't char the tortillas, used Pepper Jack cheese instead of plain Monterrey Jack, and cooked for 30 min. instead of 45 with it uncovered for the last 8 min. or so.  

It is decent -- not too soupy, which was a real concern after reading the reviews. Next time I will make the following changes:

1)  Omit the sour cream and serve it on the side with the hot dish.  It gets "lost" in here anyway. 
2)  Substitute tortilla chips or tostadas for the tortillas.  This may give the dish some much needed texture. 
3)  Use a shredded rotisserie chicken to save time. 
4)  Add some good quality salsa, green or red.  This will cover onion, garlic, etc.  I live not far from the border and am blessed to have some excellent Mexican restaurants nearby with outstanding homemade fresh salsas.
5)  Use a combination of cheeses, like Mexican Blend.

I used a good quality canned green enchilada sauce from a restaurant chain, and it is full of flavor.  I think that made all the difference; this dish would have been very bland otherwise.

Everyone kept asking me for this recipe at my Sister's baby shower it was so delicious! I love it because it was super easy and just so yummy! I seasoned the chicken with garlic, olive oil, onions, garlic pepper, and kosher salt and sauteed the chicken breast in a pan and then shredded the chicken and followed the recipe. I like to add chopped Cilantro as a garnish with Mexican Cotija cheese crumbled or Queso Fresco. ;)

My BF didn't like this recipe at all. I did. The only things I did differently were these: I didn't char the tortillas because of the time factor, the texture wasn't perfect, but it still tasted good; I had some left over diced tomatoes that I added into the sour cream/chicken mix; I used Mexican 4 cheese blend instead of Monterey Jack because it's what I had; I used regular sour cream because I use real everything; I cut the recipe in half since it's just the two of us, worked fine. The leftover's the next day were still good! 
I was very pleased! Especially now that I know when I make it next time I'll have a tasty lunch every day for a week since BF won't eat it! Yay!

My roommate and I make a similar meal all the time, but I really like the idea of turning enchiladas into a casserole- saves so much time! To make it extra rich, mix some cream of chicken soup with the sour cream. We like ours extra saucy, so remember you can never have too much sauce! Also, to make this even simpler, it's very good with a pre-cooked deli rotisserie chicken, or chicken that's cooked in a crock pot all day. Yum!

I made this for company and it was gobbled up. We didn't find it bland at all - - maybe it depends on the green enchilada sauce brand used? I used a rotisserie chicken, which made the prep time shorter. It was delicious and even the kids liked it. I'll be making it again! Thanks for sharing it...

Not a family favorite.  The taste was a bit bland for our family.  We were hoping to have more of a kick.  We added green chilies and it still tastes so-so.  If we do make again, we will add more chilies and better green enchilada sauce.

Loved this! It was fairly easy to make, though wee bit time consuming.  Not that I mind--I like playing around in the kitchen.  Took the advice of some other reviewers and mixed the sour cream with the chopped up chicken.  Wouldn't make much sense to do it any other way.  Also tore my tortillas into several pieces each and let them soak up the enchilada sauce in a pie pan, and only had a little left over to drizzle on top.  I had a busy day ahead of me, so I assembled the casserole the night before, let it sit in the fridge overnight, then baked when we were ready for our Cinco de Mayo dinner celebration.  Probably helped to allow the flavors to sit and the sauce to be thoroughly soaked up.  Boyfriend said it could have used some more kick, but I liked it as is.  If anything, I might recommend topping it with some spicy salsa.  Very enjoyable.  I'm already planning to make it again for a potluck this weekend.

This is a wonderful, easy dinner that I use a lot for pot-lucks.  Two things I do to change the recipe (I'm afraid that I am incapable of not messing with recipes just a little).  I cook the chicken in a crock pot ahead of time with some enchilada sauce and shred it--makes the meat MUCH more flavorful.  I also add finely chopped onions or scallions in the layering.  Because it's a personal preference generally, I use Greek (or drained) yogurt instead of reduced fat sour cream.

Second time I made this and added some variations; sauteed onions, a diced pablano pepper and a variety of mexican seasonings. My 19 year old son loves this dish, so I'm making it about once a week and left over's are of course "better the second day".

DELICIOUS!!!!
I boiled the chicken and added garlic and chicken bullion to the boiling water, to save time.  It turned out incredibly delicious.  I think I'll add jalapenos next time also.  I mixed the sour cream with the enchilada sauce to make it easier to spread and that worked out great.  Will definitely make again.

Great dish!  I read reviews and followed the advice of others by dipping tortillas in the sauce and also mixing the chicken, green chile, and sour cream together and it came out beautifully!  Very tasty and I'm sure we will have it again.  Several of the kids showed up and have eaten every bit of it!  Thanks SGRCOOKI!

I made this with everything as listed except for adding taco sauce to the chicken and sour cream mixture.  I boiled the chicken.  The dish is easy to assemble and delicious.

Made them last night and they were super easy and came out great! I read some reviews and decided not to brown the tortillas either. Just cut them in fourths. I only did one layer if chicken but used it all. I also mixed the sour cream with the chicken and it did make it easier. It's fast and easy to make, will do it again soon and try red sauce instead.

So good as is!! Also, the last time I used cheddar and provolone (because didn't feel like going to the store) and used wheat tortillas and left them whole, and used half the amount of tortillas.  It was delicious, and even tasted good cold the next day.  :)

Super easy and tasty. I did not toast the tortillas, and I used precooked chicken which saved time. My husband loved it so much we made it twice in the same week.

My family loved this.  I followed others suggestions: didn't char tortillas, mixed chicken with sour cream.  Didn't have monterey jack, used cheddar and colby/jack.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious!!!  I took the advice of a few reviewers and boiled the chicken with garlic, then I also mixed the sour cream and shredded chicken together with a pack of taco seasoning for the mix.  I also did not char the tortillas, as we do not have a gas stove, and it still turned out great!!!  Definitely a favorite!!!

Wow, this was rich. I felt it was a good dish but far to rich to be a traditional "casserole" which makes me think of a stand alone main dish. This would be a great side for a Mexican meal.

AWESOME!!  I used fat free plain yogurt instead of sour cream...it tastes just the same!!!!  I also added cilantro, red onion, and 2 cans of black beans. My 13 year old daughter had seconds.....She NEVER gets seconds unless its cookies or brownies.  The dish would taste good with mexican rice as a side.

quite tasty.  this was easy to make. I did mix the chicken with the sour cream per suggestions.  much easier to spread.  I also did not char the tortillas and it turned out fine. the tortillas were a little soggy come leftovers, but the taste was still the same.  I will definately make this again.  super easy and yummy.

Oh my Oh my!! I was asked this morning by Sw Chef, if you could make these on the grill. Well, I would say YES!! I seasoned my chix breast with smoked paprika,old bay seasoning and Mrs.dash,added some oil and let that hang out for a while. I fired up the bbq, sprayed the casserole pan with Pam. I put the chix and the tortillas on the grill. I added some fresh roasted,chopped pablanos to the enchilada sauce.I heated it up on the grill too.I forgot to add the sour cream to the sauce but added it to the dish after it was done. I chopped up the chix, tore the tortillas up and layered this with 3 different cheeses. I heated up the casserole on the grill until it was melted and bubbly. The family LOVED them!! Thank You SGRCOOKI I will make these again!

I made this last night for my family; used a baked chicken from Costco, boned, no skin, mixed with 1/2 pkg. taco seasoning. Toasted flour tortillas-6-tore each into 5-6 pieces and lined the bottom of 11x13 pan.  Mixed 1 can undiluted healthy Campbell chicken soup with 1 pkg. lowfat cream cheese, set aside. Layer #1: chicken, 3/4cup finely chopped onion and 1 bag frozen fiesta corn/blk.beans. Layer #2: place on top of chicken layer 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, 1 small 4oz. can sliced blk.olives, and 1/2 can [8oz. size] chopped tomato with jalapeno. Layer#3: top with chicken soup/ cream cheese mix and spread to edges. Place remainder of chopped tomato and jalapeno in a line down center of pan. Top with 2cups [or more, to personal taste]shedded mexican 4-cheese mix. Top with foil and bake at 350 for 40-45 min.=cheese melted and filling bubbling around edges. Let cool 5-10 min. then serve.  Even better reheated the next day.  My picky husband and sons devoured this in record time. Feeds 4 big eaters, or 7-8 small eaters.

thanks to other reviewers this was wonderful.  I did not have corn tortillas and was worried, but flour (my husbands preference) did work as well.  from reviewers this is what I learned. #1 only 3 of us so halved the recipe and used a glass pie pan. Again worried at first it would overflow, but was perfect.  #2  Used boneless chicken breast that I cooked in skillet with garlic olive oil, small can ortega green chilis, spiced with part of a taco seaoning packet (NOT THE WHOLE PACKET). Yum, yum.  Gives it a kick.  #3 shredded the chicken with a fork since I didn't have a processor or anything. Chunks would never have worked. #3 Did not char.  Cut tortillas into fourths, after putting part of the sauce in bottom of a pie plate, i used another pie plate for the rest of the sauce.  I dipped tortillas in sauce as I assembled. Since tortillas and pie plate are both round, this worked easily.  Depending on torillas size, with the large torillas you only need 3-4. #4 I used a packet of 4 cheese shredded mexican cheeses.  #5  I mixed the shredded chicken with the sour cream before assembly. #6 assembly order was: 1/2" sauce, tortillas in single layer, chicken spread, cheese, tortillas in 2nd single layer, chicken spread, cheese, tortillas in 3rd single layer, cheese.  #6 Baked covered with foil for 45 minutes. #7 cooled for 10 minutes.  Cut Pie into 4ths and used a pie server spatula to serve.  Sour Cream dab on top with a couple black olives.  Perfect.  I like flavor but not too spicy

We absolutely loved this recipe - will definitely make it again, and the leftovers were good too.  Some mods:  as previously suggested, I didn't char the tortillas, I soaked them in the sauce instead of pouring sauce, I only used 20oz of the sauce, and I added a can of black beans (first layer) and mixed black olives in with the chicken and sour cream.

This tasted really good, but was really ugly. As I was dishing it onto my husband's plate, he asked what it was. This casserole was a soggy soupy mess. I think it's too much sauce, sour cream, and melted cheese. It all combines together and it's just mush. Add soggy tortillas and it's so runny. I really liked the flavor though, it just needs to be firmed up. I might try it again, but use less sauce and sour cream or try to add something else.

This was great!  I changed it up a bit... I roasted 2 Anaheim Chiles & set them to the side.  I did mix the chicken, sour cream and a bit of the sauce together, as others suggested.  For the layering I did, 6 cooked & coated tortillas, the chicken mixture, the roasted Chiles, a bit more of the chicken mixture, cheese, 8 more of the tortillas, the rest of the sauce and a good helping of cheese.  Cooked for 40 minutes covered & 10 minuted uncovered to brown the cheese.  Hubby really liked it - he gave it 5 stars & said it was a keeper.  Served with spanish rice and pinto beans.  Thanks Tracy!

This recipe was GREAT! My family loved it.
I quartered the tortillas. I added green chiles, and I used 50/50 red and green enchilada sauce. I also used Colby/Monterrey Jack cheese.
I will defintely make it again!

My husband loved this, and he's not always crazy about Mexican food.  To scorch the corn tortillas, I just layed them across the grate of my gas stove with the flame on medium.  I took them off after about a minute.  I tore them after they'd cooled.  I boiled my chicken also, then saved the broth.  I used fat-free sour cream and mixed it with the chicken, rather than layering it on the cheese (I used cheddar because that's what I had).  For the enchilada sauce, I used one 10-oz. can of green enchilada sauce and one 10-oz. can of "hot and spicy" red enchilada sauce.  I didn't coat the tortillas in the sauce, I layered like lasagna.  I alternated the sauces when I layered, it added a little extra color.  This has become a family favorite!

My first thought is that this recipe in no way should be titled "Quick".  Besides the one and a half hour total baking time, I can't imagine someone holding 36 tortilla halves over a flame for 1 minute each.  The taste was okay.  My husband liked it more than I did, but I may have been a little put off by the appearance.

Wow, this was a BIG hit.  My husband LOVED this chicken enchilada dish, even more than his mother's recipe.  Excellent dish, the directions were a tad bit confusing, but I figured it out.  Overall, wonderful taste!

This is a huge favorite! I made a couple of changes. I would mix up the shredded chicken, sour cream, and put in a packet of taco seasoning....by mixing these ingredients together, makes it easier to spread. I also added tomatillo sauce and jalapenos. I would put sour cream, olives, and salsa on side for people to add on. Actually going to make it yet again this weekend

I served this to guests last night, and it was a hit.  They said it was better than chicken enchiladas, and it's far easier and healthier than fixing enchiladas, too!  I combined instructions from the video with information from the recipe. I used rotisserie chicken which saved me the step of cooking chicken breasts. I tried charring the tortillas as instructed in the recipe, but it was difficult to do with the floppy tortillas.  I found that browning them in a dry cast iron skillet was far easier. I also tore the tortillas into fourths, as instructed in the video, and I added some red sauce to the top of the dish before cooking. Guests added hot sauce, sour cream, onions, cilantro, jalapenos, olives, and avocado on top. This is a crowd pleaser.

Wow! We just finished this dish and it was delicious!! I followed a couple of other reviewers tips; I didn't char the tortillas, I boiled the chicken with garlic and cayenne pepper in the water, I mixed the chicken and sour cream before layering, and after the first bit of sauce I dipped the tortillas in the remaining sauce. It was super!! Loved it so much I'm going to make it again and this time add black beans!

Delicious... family raved about it. I put my chicken breasts in the crockpot at lunch and then shredded it when I got home, popped the casserole in the oven and dinner was ready with ease.  I followed the other reviews and mixed the chicken and sour cream before spreading over the tortillas. Will definitely make again.

My family and I didn't like this a whole lot.  We didn't hate it, but it is not a recipe I will repeat.  The only addition I made was to add cumin to the shredded chicken, as I love cumin very much, and I always put it in any Mexican or Southwestern recipe.  The flavor is ok, but not enough for us.  The texture is probably the biggest issue for us.  Kind of mushy.  At first I was trying to think of some ways to change it next time for more flavor, such as adding a can of green chilies to the chicken for some heat, but after talking to my family while we ate about what I might try to do different next time, I realized they weren't very enthusiastic, so I'll not try it again.  It's ok, and I'm glad so many people love it, as I always feel bad when I don't give a recipe a rave review.  But I do try and be honest.

Awesome recipe. I roasted bone-in, chicken breast halves seasoned with some essence cajun seasoning. After roasting and cooling the chicken, removed skin and shredded. Sauteed some onion until carmelized and added a little to each layer which added a nice layer of flavor.  Otherwise no changes, and I'm sure it would have been delicious as written.

This delicious casserole was a hit! It was even inhaled by my 9 yr twin boys. I did add a can of diced chiles, 1 T+ taco seasoning, 3 T cream cheese, 2 cans black beans, & tomato w/   green chiles. The chicken was boiled in water with 4 cloves garlic. I also skipped the charring. I did not use all the sour cream inside, but added to servings on top afterwards.  Fantastic!

Can't believe how yummy this turned out!  I even used the short cut from a reviewer that used frozen chicken instead to speed things up - I was hesitant, but it didn't affect the flavor at all. For my own spin, i added 2 cans of green chiles, diced and put it on the middle layer - really added some more zing to it! Also, can't believe how good this tastes heated up the next day. I'll definitely make it again.

This was pretty good!  I would use left over chicken rather than to bake chicken breasts.  I had a whole roast chicken left over from Costco that we hadn't gotten to and needed to figure out something to do with it.  I used the spicy green chile sauce and chopped in some green onions to give it some zing.  To cut down on fat, I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  Topped with cilantro when it came out of the oven.  Tasted great!

Good recipe and easy to follow directions. Unfortunately the meal itself turns out to be quite bland. I'm sure with a marinade of the chicken and some spices it can really come to life, but my imagination past the given directions is very limited as my experience in cooking does not extend far past the grill.

I made it exactly as written and even did the charring on the tortillas.  It was nearly flavorless.  It needed salt, spice, and vegetables - all of those.  We also weren't a fan of the casserole form and will never again waver from traditional rolled enchiladas.

Tasty!  Had to substitute jalapenos for green chilis, but other than that kept everything the same. This would also be good to make with leftover turkey. Absolutely will make regularly.

I made this tonight for dinner.  I used leftover baked chicken, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It went together very quickly.  It was wonderful!  I thought I would have enough for someone to have lunch the next day, but we loved it so much we finished it off.  This recipe has already gone into my recipe box.  It's definitely a keeper!

I have made this for years except without tearing the tortillas in half. I also add a small can of green chili's and a small jar of salsa verde to the chicken and some green onions. This is my kids favorite dish. I'll try it this way seems way easier.

Excellent!  Have been making this for years, just haven,t rated it!  I always add menudo seasoning-- about a tsp or oregano if I don't have the other.  I also use some cotejo cheese to finish for a little more Mex flavor,  Ole!

Loved this recipe.  I deep fried the tortillas before putting the casserole together and added whole green chiles split in half on one layer. Everyone loves it.  by the way this freezes well too.  I froze one and then partly thawed it in the refidge before baking it.  one of our families fav's

I wish I had doubled this recipe because I had to really spread the chicken thin in my baking dish.  It's pretty good but will probably add some more spices next time.

Wow! Let me start out by saying that I haven't found an enchilada recipe, white or red, that I like. Most are so incredibly bland & boring(even w/tweaking) & just not my thing. I loved this so much I ended up having seconds! I skipped the charring & added cheddar w/the monterey jack. I also followed some other reviewers & added a bit of taco seasoning w/the chicken mixture & mixed the chicken & sour cream together. I cut my tortillas smaller & only ended up using 2/3 of them. Doubled the recipe into 2 9x13 pans so we could have leftovers & I'm sooooo glad I did that!! Thank you!!!

Fantastic recipe considering its simplicity!  I made it tonight for the first time.  I used all of the meat (minus the skin) from a charcoal cooked rotisserie chicken I bought from a fantastic restaurant around the corner from where I live.  Also, I used a 16 oz jar of verde enchilada sauce with the remaining 12 oz (28 total for the sauce) from a jar of locally made green chile salsa.  As others have suggested, I mixed the rotisserie chicken (which I hand shredded) with the sour cream and added a small amount of garlic salt.  I cut the corn tortillas into quarters and applied everything evenly.  It turned out fantastic.  Granted, purchasing a quality rotisserie chicken for this recipe isn't the most cost effective method, but it sure turned out great!   Edit:  I almost forgot.  I ended up coating the dish with some bacon fat I had leftover from making bacon fried rice the night before.  It's definitely not healthy but added a tasty, bacony crispiness to the crust on the bottom and sides.

This just did not work for me. The chicken tasted just boiled. But I also do not like chicken enchiladas in a restaurant - too dry. I had hoped this would be better.

My family loved this recipe!  Being from Texas, we like things spicy so I added the taco seasoning mix and some chopped mild jalapenos to the chicken/sour cream mixture, and then added even more as garnish.   Will definitely serve next time I have a crowd to please.

I served it tonight and everyone loved it. I made a double recipe and used 2 packs of Gardien brand vegetarian "chicken", one tub of Tofutti sour cream, and one package of Daiya cheddar cheese.  I also added one can of black beans.  I followed a reviewer's suggestion and just mixed everything all together (including all the sour cream and 2/3 of the package of "cheese")then just put it in the casserole dish and sprinkled the "cheese" on top.  It tasted great!!  It took 65 minutes to get hot in the center.

I followed the recipe plus one addition. In a pan with olive oil I saute'd garlic, onion, and red bell pepper and added that mixture to the chicken and sour cream. Baked for 30 minutes covered and then 5 minutes uncovered. Tasted like an entree at a local Mexican restaurant. Will make again. Served with chips and salsa.

This was very good.  I cooked the chicken breasts in the crock pot with pepper, garlic powder and garlic salt for 8 hours.  It shredded very easily and had a great flavor.  I ended up using 16 oz sour cream and mixed with the chicken.  I covered the tortilla pieces in the enchilada sauce and layered in the pan. I also added a can of black beans, although I don't think it needed it and probably won't do that again.  I got rave reviews and will make this again.

Our family loved this recipe! We mixed the chicken and sour cream to make the layering easier. We used 1/2 28 oz can hot enchilada sauce in the pan and to pre-soak the tortillas. We used most of a large size jar of 505 Mild Enchilada sauce for the layering in a 9x13 pan. This did not make it soupy or lengthen cooking time. Super tasty with just a little bite! Definitely a keeper for us! Enjoy! :)

After reading some of the reviews and before I made it, decided to use some homemade taco seasoning listed on this website as Taco Seasoning I (didn't want to run to the store).  Probably could have shredded the chicken some more.  Mixed the chicken with the sour cream, but otherwise, followed the recipe AND

OMG this is so good, it's like my dream Mexican meal and nobody can leave it alone.  We keep going back into the kitchen to take a bit off here and there.  It's too funny, we were saying it's some kind of scientific phenomenon that it's just disappearing..haha

I have made this twice for a potluck group. They love it and come back for seconds. I use a prepared Rotissere chicken, add sauted onion, garlic, jalpeno pepper, can green diced chiles to the green chile sauce. It gives it more flavor. I make it the night before and just heat it up.

I pretty much followed the directions exactly on this except I added some taco seasoning to the meat. It was ok and my husband even ate a second helping, but  we have had better enchilada recipes. It wasn't soupy, but there was no crunch to it. The corn tortillas had soaked up so much sauce that they fell apart and could barely be identified.

This recipe is sooo delicious! Just wasn't sure what size baking dish to use. I think next time i'll use 9x12. Also I added mushrooms and fresh spinach to the casserole because I enjoy them in enchiladas. It was perfect!

Delicious & easier than the recipe I usually use.   Family loved it! It is not too spicy for a kid's palate, yet it is not bland, either.  I made as directed except I had a lot of unused tortillas left over.  I think it was because my pan was about a 10" square foil roaster about 4" deep.  I used 2 10 oz. cans of Kroger brand green enchilaa sauce, and it was still plenty saucy.  This is a really flexible recipe.

Amazing recipe!  Definite hit at our house. Made a few changes...Boiled the chicken and shredded in the food processor....added sour cream, cheese and fajita seasoning (from AR venison fajitas).  MIxed it all together and continued with the layering process. Tear all tortillas into 4th's...it helps soak up the chile sauce.  Fantastic!

Cut the recipe in half, and didn't char the tortillas. Also added cumin and chili powder to the mix. This was so good, and I am so full I cant breathe lol

This was pretty good.  I did not char the tortillas as others suggested, but I did still get a little bit of the mushiness others had mentioned.  It could have been the green sauce I used, or that I just don't care that much for green sauce (first time trying it) but a little of this taste went a long way for me.  I enjoyed trying this recipe and I thank you for sharing it!

This was amazing!!  I had to do a few things different just because I didn't have certain ingredients.  I used flour tortillas, which I didn't char, and I also had to make my own enchilada sauce (Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce, from this site).  Followed everything else and it came out great!!

I thought it was great.  My husband thought it was bland.  I would add onion, red pepper, and green chilis next time.  I did modify it.  I couldn't find green chili enchilada sauce, so I used red sauce.  I did 2 lbs of ground turkey instead of chicken.  I was so thankful that I followed the other reviewers advice- Don't pour the echilada sauce into the dish.  I put the enchilada sauce into a pie plate.  I tore each torillas into 4 pieces.  Then I dipped each tortilla piece into the enchilada sauce to coat it and then added the pieces into the baking dish.

Came out okay but I thought the flavors were a little bland.  Will probably keep as a good springboard recipe.  

Followed others advice and mixed the chicken and sour cream.  Also, used the enchilada sauce to coat the remaining tortillas instead of just dumping it in.  The texture and consistency of the casserole were really good and it held its shape well.

This is GREAT!  My whole family loved this, even my picky son.  The only changes I made were 1. Rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, because I was short on time, and 2. I added 1 T of taco seasoning to the chicken, from the Taco Seasoning I recipe on this site.  It was PERFECT!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a great dish!  Super easy and I love the green chile enchilada sauce.  I added 3/4 can of black beans to the shredded chicken and loved it.  Definitly will be making this again :)

Loved this one! Used red sauce rather than green, as that is what the family prefers. They were DELICIOUS! Plan to make these again when more of the family is over, as this is a good dish for a larger group.

Delicious and devoured by the guests!  I also combined the chicken with sourcream, and added a pkg of taco seasoning, 2 small seeded diced jalapeno, and 1 tsp cumin.  Otherwise it was perfect, and I saved maybe 1/2 cup sauce just to avoid soupiness some mentioned but I think it would have been fine to use the whole can.  Garnished with cilantro & chopped green onions.  This is a keeper!

Unfortunately, this did not turn out as good as I'd hoped.  However, it is not a total bust, because I think there is potential.  I did not char the tortillas (no gas stove and it was raining, so couldn't use the grill).  So, as usually happens with corn tortillas, they just turned to mush in the baking process.  I think if I had to do it again, I'd go ahead and go with my gut and use flour tortillas (uncharred) since they are my normal preference.   Also, it is important to let it set for a good 10-15 minutes after baking, otherwise it is very soupy and runny.  It needs time to set up.  Otherwise, it was a very easy recipe to prepare with few ingredients.  That makes it worth something, right?

Loved this!  So very simple!  I sauteed my chicken in olive oil...much faster.  I also added taco seasoning to my sour cream and mixed the sour cream with the chicken, as suggested. Much easier this way.  I used the red enchilada sauce because it was what I had on hand.  My husband is not a fan of sour cream, but he LOVED this.  Will definitely make this again.

Quick and Easy indeed!!! I'm a beginner and these were a HIT at home...I boiled the chicken with garlic and half chicken bouillion and didn't charred tortillas but tore them as other reviews recommended.  Also mixed sour cream with chicken instead of spreading it.  Will definitely make this one again but will throw some jalapeños in there next time. Try it! You won't regret it!

YUM!  I made this exactly as the recipe is written.  To save time though, I cooked the chicken on the stove.  I didn't have enough Monterey Jack cheese, so I shredded some American cheese.  Next time, I think I'll add some canned jalepeno peppers for some kick.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent!  A winner for this family!  I used leftover roast chicken which I sauteed with some garlic and Southwestern taco seasoning.  Everyone loved it--It is added to our recipe file.

We loved it.  Unexpected surprise.  It was quick, easy and delish!  I had to improvise becaues I didn't have everything on hand.   I actually didn't have enough tortillas so for the bottom layer I used cooked lasagna noodles. Used flour tortillas and fried slighly in pan with a little oil.    I used red chile sauce and topped it off with lots of fresh cilantro. Will definately be making again. Thanks Sgrcooki

This was pretty good... I used other ideas of cooking the chicken in the crock pot with salsa ( I think this probably makes it a lot more flavorful than in the oven with garlic) and then mixed the cheese and sour cream in with the chicken... this made for easily assembly and then I just topped it with cheese.  I also used corn tostadas, I think it left a better texture.

This went over very well for my boyfriend and his sister.  I made a few slight changes:  I did a dry rub of taco mix and garlic powder on the chicken.  I thought the sodium from the enchilada sauce was a lot already.  I mixed a the remainder of the taco mix packet with the sour cream and mixed the sour cream with the chicken, as others suggested.  The flavor was great but I add hot sauce to everything so the Chalula was a great condiment to use!  This was not soupy at all.  In fact, I used 3x10oz cans of the enchilada sauce and all of it baked in great!  I didn't char the tortillas, as I do not have a gas grill.  There are tons of leftovers and they taste just as great the next day!

I added garlic, cumin, and a little cayenne. Topped it with green onions, cilantro, black olives and avocado.  Pretty tasty!!!  Although the 9 year old wouldn't eat it.  Thanks for the good eats :)

I agree with the other reviewers that said this dish was bland. I did everything the recipe said except char the tortillas. It looked good when I took it out of the oven but when I took the first bite I could tell something was missing. Salt? Jalapeños? Not sure I'd make this again. This was just alright.

It was dry and bland. Not sure if I did something wrong. I did use green chilis, it calls for green chili sauce. That may be my problem.

I've made this on many occasions but with the following variations: - no sour cream - add a can of green chiles to layers - use flour tortillas instead of corn - use canned chicken breast (I know this sounds gross, but it actually tastes much better because the chicken shreds better and is moister from being in the can, plus you don't have to cook the chicken) - uncover and broil the last 5 minutes to get the cheese crispy (watch carefully though, will burn easily on broil)   I often times make this in advance and freeze it!

I love this recipe and make it all the time! The only thing I do differently is simply coat the tortillas in the enchilada sauce instead of charring them (it turns out fine), cook the chicken in the crockpot instead (easier for me), and mix the chicken with the sour cream instead of doing separate layers. This is a huge hit.

Mmm, good flavor!  I used a cooked chicken from the store to save time and didn't char the tortillas.  Very good.  I cooked it in a casserole dish but will use a 9 x 13 next time.  Oh, also used pepper jack cheese which was really good.  Added a nice bit of spice!  Thanks for sharing!

I'm new to the baking world. This was my very first casserole. I made it to spec and I love it! Though, I did mix the sour cream with the chicken, per other reviewers.

I skipped the charring step and used my own enchilada sauce, as it was on hand.  This recipe just seems to be lacking something in the 'wow' department. If it had truly been quick and easy as the title suggests, I might make it again.

I made several alterations to this recipe.  First--I marinated the chicken in a lime-cilantro marinade.  (1/2 cup of finely chopped cilantro, 1/2 a fresh Jalapeno, seeded & grated or finely chopped, Juice of 1 lime, 1/4 cup of olive oil, Garlic Salt to taste).  I baked the chicken as instructed (350 for 45 mins.)  Second--I made my own Taco Seasoning (Taco Seasoning I) and mixed it into the sour cream, which I also mixed with the diced chicken.  Third--I added 1/2 cup of finely chopped cilantro and 1/2 a fresh Jalapeno grated or finely chopped to the Green Chile Sauce.  Fourth--I used a "Mexican" cheese blend instead of Monterey Jack  Lastly--I quartered the corn tortillas in strips, which I did not char.    The meal was served with extra Sour Cream and homemade Guacamole, and a Mexican Bean salad on the side. Mmm....

These were very good. I ran out of enchilada sauce for the top layer so next time I will buy one large and one small can of the sauce. I also used a mexican blend of cheeses and added a can of chopped green chilies..very good.

I used left over pork I had from the other night when I made Simple Carnitas in the crockpot. I though it was ok, my family ate it, and didn't complain, so its that's always a big plus.

This was easy and pretty good, but not great.  Easy way to use leftover chicken.  Used flour tortillas since it was all I had.  Might try again with corn.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe! I did not char the tortillas at all- don't like the flavor- and instead I mixed the sour cream, chicken, canned green chiles and some green peppers and onions all together and then did the layering with the sauce and cheese. It was hot the day that I made this so instead of using my regular oven I used my toaster oven and it turned out great!

Absolutely wonderful.  Though I did make a few changes.  Used a 12 ounce can of green enchilada sauce, and doubled the sour cream.  Added a can of black beans, a can of sweet corn niblets, and a can of sliced olives.  Baked for 90 minutes @ 325.  Everyone loved it.

Love this dish!! But I must also say the title is deceiving! It is not something I would want to put together after a long day at the office! Here is what I did- I baked the chicken as directed with garlic powder and salt and pepper- I think it is too time consuming to shred with a fork- I do have a small food processor and that really worked well- To the shredded chicken I added the sour cream- didn't seem like enough but it was fine in the end- I also added some Goya cilantro cooking base to this mixture and some black beans, drained and rinsed- not quite a whole can of beans- I did not char the tortillas- in my area they come in a pack of 12- that seemed to be plenty- I used a 9 X 13 pan-  I also layered some scallions- very tasty!  I baked it for 45 min and then added mexican blend cheese to the top and let it bake about another 10 min-  I will make this again!!

This is a great recipe when you want an easy casserole-style enchilada.  I baked my chicken (30 minutes was plenty, and I might even boil it the next time) and let it cool.  I prefer it shredded in enchiladas, so I shredded it with a fork.  Like many reviewers suggested, I added 1/2 a packet of taco seasoning to my sour cream, and then stirred in the chicken.  I don't have a gas stove, so I didn't char the tortillas.  I tore them into 1/4's and that seemed to work well.  I let my casserole rest in the fridge for about 4 hours before baking it, and I think that helped the tortillas soak up some of the sauce, and intensify the flavor.  I followed the rest of the directions, and it turned out great.  My husband loved it, and I think it was even more flavorful the next day.  I will make it again!

This was awesome and so easy! Tastes just like my husbands enchladas, but so much easier. Next time I will add diced peppers, onions and olives (personal preference).

Very tasty.  Title is a little deceptive - it's not really a "quick" recipe - lots of steps that take some time, plus oven cooking time. I seasoned the chicken breasts with taco seasoning and a little garlic pepper. Shredded with a fork - worked just fine and one less thing to clean.  It's a good idea to mix the sour cream with the chicken since it doesn't spread very well. Whole family enjoyed this and it was a nice change from "traditional" salsa type recipes.

This is such a great recipe. I pour half of the Green Chile mix in my 9x13 pan. The rest of the can I soak my corn tortillas in. It definitely didn't turn out soupy. My brother and fiance request this recipe often and eat off of it for days. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is delicious! I added a few spices because per some of the reviews i think w/out them it would have been a lil bland. So, I added 6 chopped green onions and chopped cilantro to the chicken/sourcream mixture. Also when boiling the chicken I added taco seasoning. When mixing the chicken/sourcream mixture I added a Tblspoon of spice mixture, (not garlic salt) that included not only garlic but parsley, onion, basil, cayenne pepper, etc. ....U get the picture, one of those ;-) It turned out great. And as suggested by one of the reviewers I added a slice of avocado to the top along with diced tomatoes. U gotta try it!

I used carnitas that I had leftover from the recipe on my page, instead of chicken. I added chopped mild green chiles. I also added some black olives and only used the cheese to top casserole. This was surprisingly yummy. I only used a 8x8 dish because there is only me and my beautiful wife. We ended up with 4 HUGE servings this way. Very easy, very tasty. It did take twice as long to cook as stated in the recipe though. Enjoy!

Wow, I have no idea how this recipe has so many rave reviews. While it was by no means terrible, hence the two stars, it was in my opinion very bland! I even added some green chiles to the chicken mix and put some green onions and sliced olives on top! It presented well, I did have high hopes. Maybe it was the use of the canned sauce, I truly don't know. Won't be making this again.

I used the "baked slow cooker chicken" recipe from this site. Went by the recipe but I also added cream cheese along with sour cream to the chicken mixture. Made one for a friend and her family loved it as well as mine.

My casserole came our really mushy.  It tasted good, I just didn't like the texture.  I only used 2/3 of the 28 oz sauce.  I didn't char the tortillas and I did make it an hour early and kept it in the fridge before cooking it.  Maybe that was the problem.  I might try tis again with less sauce.  Leftovers-I wrapped them in a warm whole wheat tortilla.  It was really good!

I have used this recipe over and over again!  The only change I make is using red enchilada sauce then adding green just on top to give it a little kick! I have to double this recipe for I have five kids and they all want more for extra days when they come home from school, practice etc...Thanks!

We had this for dinner tonight and it was really good. The only thing I would change is to leave out the sour cream. I love sour cream, but it didn't mix well with the cheese or the sauce. It was too hard to evenly spread when assembling it. I will definitely make this again (without a doubt!) but I'll probably leave out the sour cream but use it to top it when serving.  Great easy recipe... really good.

This was pretty ordinary. It needed more seasoning. I'm not sure what the reason is for charring, since the tortillas become mush. I may try tinkering with this...

Wonderful.  I was hesitant about trying this but it was very flavorful and tasty!  My husband said it tasted like something from a restaurant.  I cooked my chicken in the crockpot with salsa and then proceeded with the recipe.  Used cheddar cheese and flour tortillas.  A keeper!

This is a great casserole. Everyone loved it! I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. The only thing I would watch out for is the enchilada sauce. The brand I used didn't have a heat level labeled on the can so I assumed it would be medium. It was a bit too spicy for my toddler, but fine for the adults. Next time, I will make sure I get mild sauce. This will be a regular in our house!

This was a great recipe.  I substituted the chicken with leftover turkey breast and it came out wonderful.  My kids and husband liked it very much!  My only complaint is that it looks a little boring if you serve it alone.  I paired it with mexican rice and it was a hit, however!

This is EXCELLENT!! I've tried several green chile enchilada recipes and this is right up there. It didn't dawn on me to mix the chicken with the sour cream, as someone else suggested, and had a difficult time trying to spread the sour cream... So next time, I'll definitely mix the two together. I used medium sauce and a Mexican four cheese blend. What a great time saver vs. preparing enchiladas the traditional way.

Sorry guys, but we didn't think this was so great.  It probably was because we aren't big fans of corn tortillas.  There are much better chicken enchilada recipes on this site that are better & easier.  If I made this again, I'd have to add some chilies or something to kick it up.

If you like chicken enchalada suiza, then you will like this. I don't have gas stove so I turn the small burner on my electric stove on 4 and then char each side of the tortilla right on the burner.  I also use a little more cheese than is in the recipe, especially on top.  I bake as directed, but I also uncover and bake for about 10 minutes at the end.  I have served this a couple of times to guests and they have loved it.  Thanks!

This recipe worked out great for my family and I. The kids said it was too spicy so maybe next time I'll leave out the green chiles but otherwise, magnificent in taste and so easy.  I also added some taco seasoning to the sour cream and the mixed the chicken and sour cream togehter before i spread it.  EXCELLENT!!!

This is so easy and everyone (even the teenage daughter) really like this!I didn't bother to char the tortillas, just cut them up-and I boiled my chicken in some seasoned water just so I could save the stock for soup later. This casserole reheats very well too.

This is a great recipe.  I also used less chicken than it suggested, and put it all in a 9 x 13 pan.  I like the idea to mix the chicken and sour cream together, because it was a little tough to spread the sour cream by itself.  I saw no reason to cook the tortillas first, or to dip them in the sauce.  I cut them into quarters, laid them in raw, and poured sauce over each layer.

Great casserole!  I used half monterey jack cheese and half cheddar.  I only had 2 10oz cans of green enchilada sauce, so I used those plus another of red enchilada sauce.  I used the red sauce to soak the tortilla pieces in for the top layer.  I used half a packet of taco seasoning mixed into the sour cream.  It all fit well into a 9x13 pan.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The first time I made this it was a disaster! (I heard "two tablespoons" instead of "to taste" with the garlic salt. I cleaned out my ears and made it again AS WRITTEN and it was fantastic!

Excellent and easy casserole. I added sautéed onions, garlic and two jalapeños to boost the flavor as well as fresh corn, taken off the cob, and a can of drained black beans. The entire can of green enchilada sauce, 28 oz, was perfect amount as the casserole was moist but not gloppy. Will make again particularly if I have leftover rotisserie chicken.

I am not really a fan of rating  recipes unless I made it exactly as the recipe says but in this case after  looking over the recipe and then reading many reviews, I agreed with most, that a few alterations were needed, in my opinion.  I pretty much followed the original recipe but added a small can of chopped green chilies, also used extra chicken breasts and a bit more sour cream to compensate for extra chicken, and mixed the sour cream with the shredded chicken for more even distribution. Also mixed in fresh chopped cilantro, just because I love cilantro!  I liked the idea from other reviews of not toasting the tortillas because I did not want that crispy texture, and then dipped the pieces of corn tortillas into the enchilada sauce vs pouring sauce into baking dish, as recipe says. Came out very good!  Also garnished with chopped scallions. I think the title Quick & Easy justify the original recipe. It is a good base or starter recipe, enabling you to be more creative, which is what cooking is all about!  I did not give it 5 stars just because it's a bit heavy, but very delicious!  Maybe I should just learn to have a smaller piece!

This one is a keeper. I made some minor changes based on what I had in my fridge and the comments.  I used two packages (9 oz. I think) of the Perdue pre-cooked chicken breast strips.   I cut them up into smaller pieces and mixed them with sour cream and some taco seasoning and garlic powder. I used nine corn tortillas, three in each layer, and I did not cut them up or char them first. I also used Mexican cheese since that's what I had on hand. I only used 20 oz of green chile sauce.

Made it for 2, and used salsa Verde instead of enchilada sauce. Also used 4oz of cream cheese with sour cream, stirred in 1 small can of green chili's. And left over rotisserie chicken..you could also use the cooked chicken strips...excellent flavor!

Good casserole. I changed the chicken cooking method. I chose to  poach it in some chicken broth, flavored with some garlic, onion and bay leaf. The poached  chicken breasts, unlike the baked ones, come out  very moist and easy to shred. Once shredded,  I added some traditional Mexican spices, such us Chili powder and cumin  and proceeded as directed.

This is really remarkable.  When we make it we generally roast a chicken and pull the meat.  Then we use the bones, fat etc to create our own chicken stock.  My husband is a lover of green chilies so he makes a green chile sauce with the stock and hatch green chilies we buy roasted and freeze every fall.  All together this makes the most amazing meal ever!!

I thought this was great!  I mixed the sour cream with the enchilada sauce so I could easily pour it over the shredded chicken instead of layering it. "Delicious!" my 9 year old exclaimed!  Will definitely be making this again...or maybe my husband will.  he loved it so much he said HE'D make it.  Score!  ;-)

This came out fantastic!

Although my local grocery store didn't sell corn tortillas,  i used flour tortillas. Plus, they didn't sell enchilada sauce so I improvised and added salsa, chilli seasoning and cumin to the chicken mixture to add flavour; salsa for the bottom layer.

 I made further modifications and added sautéed onions and red & yellow peppers to the chicken mixture. I also added a layer that consisted of corn and black beans.

Boiled chicken breasts in chicken stock.  Removed to cool, then shred.  Sautéed onion, red pepper and roasted poblano pepper, then added shredded chicken.  Let cool then add Light sour cream.  Used only about half of the called-for sour cream. Used one 15-oz (or so) can of mild green enchilada sauce and one 15-oz can (or so) of medium green salsa. Used large-cut corn tortillas; did not heat up and worked fine.  Use little less cheese than called for.  Served warm w/dollop of sour cream.  Next time serve on a bed of shredded lettuce.  It's Great!!  Takes like awesome chicken enchiladas without all the assembly.

I tweaked this recipe to my liking. I cooked the chicken 4 hrs in the crockpot on low. I cooked the chicken in cream of chicken soup, with a can of milk, minced garlic clove and taco seasoning. This made the chicken so flavorful. I used this sauce mixture on the bottom of the baking pan before putting my corn tortillas on top of them. I used whole tortillas instead of tearing them up. I shreaded the chicken after it cooked I put Monterey Jack and cheddar cheese on top of the tortilla, then spread sour cream on top with a spatula then poured green Chile sauce and repeated the layers. I used a 15 oz can of green Chile sauce since I didn't use it on the bottom of the baking pan. It turned out soooo tasty and the chicken was so flavorful! Smelled and tasted delicious and not soupy whatsoever! A must try!

I made this and modified a little. I gotta say first, I love making casseroles like this!! I did not add the sour cream to the dish, instead we just topped as we wanted. I put cumin and chilli pepper seasonings as well as garlic powder and sea salt. I added fresh diced red onion and tomato!! This is a first rate recipe!! Thanks for sharing!! (I paired this with Cilantro Lime Quinoa... So good!)

I did this in the slow cooker & adapted the recipe for less fat & calories - I replaced 1/2 the cheese w/ tofu cheese (less saturated fat) & also added dried tomatoes from my garden, which always add some savory/bass notes. I forgot to put in the sour cream (I would hv used Greek lo-fat yogurt if I had remembered - same great taste, more  protein, less fat by far). I cut the chicken breasts in 1/2 lengthwise but did not pre-cook the chicken before I added it for a layer. I did not char the tortillas - layered them & used them whole, * they turned ito a nice thick layer of cornmeal.  -- -- The whole thing was easy, pretty healthy & VERY satisfying. I was able to freeze extra for a later meal. :-)

Just ok to throw together on a busy night.  Definitely needs some seasoning , onions, and maybe olives.

We LOVE this, having a second serving tonight.  My husband didn't even add hot sauce, taco sauce, nothing, and really ate it up and looking forward to it again tonite.  I did use many of the "tips" from others, coating the torn up tacos, added green onions, mixed chicken with the sour cream---perfect meal.

Followed a few commenters. Blending in jalepenos to the green chile sauce adds a great kick and more flavor. Plus mixing the sour cream to the chicken gives it a great overall bite- instead of bites without it.

I used whole wheat tortillas and after I toasted and baked them, I needed a steak knife to cut into them. I also made it using onions, pepper & garlic and mixed the sauce and sour cream right in with everything and added cumin. I think I needed more sauce but the flavor was pretty good.

Used flour tortillas instead, didn't char them, and didn't use the whole can of sauce. Shredded the chicken in a food processor, seasoned with garlic salt, red pepper, and cumin, and mixed the sour cream in with the chicken for easier spreading. I used Colby Jack and cheddar cheese because that's what I had on hand. It was still a little runny, but very good!

I make a very similar recipe, but I use left over baked chicken breast. This is a quick and easy dinner to prepare.  Great for Family Reunions also.  I never thought of using sour cream in the recipe, but will try it the next time.

After reading some reviewers say it was too soupy I was cautious with the chile sauce. Ended up using 3/4 of the can and it still turned out like mush :( My husband still liked it. I really wanted to like this recipe but I definitely won't be making it again.

This was absolutely delicious! I need to try it again as I accidently used the wrong type of tortillas and I think too much liquid as it was a bit on the soggy side for me.

I like this change from regular enchiladas but it needs some tweaking. The flavor was great (with 1 tsp. each of cumin, chili powder, garlic salt added in with the chicken/sour cream) but it turned out mushy. :( I skipped the step of charring the tortillas so I'll have to try that next time.

So good. I think 45 minutes for the chicken was a little too long. The meat started to dry. Nevertheless, this was very good.

Delicious and easy! I used 3/4 the cheese the recipe calls for and I thought it was still plenty. I also used a half chicken instead of the chicken breasts so mine had more dark meat in it, and I also added some cumin to the chicken seasoning and it came out great. Also, I would recommend making this with the "Best Spanish Rice" recipe. I used the leftover chicken juices from this recipe as part of the chicken broth in the rice and it was deliciosa.

Very good! Like other reviewers, I added taco seasoning to the chicken then mixed it with the sour cream before spreading. I also didn't char the tortillas and cut them into fourths. I followed everything else in the recipe as directed. I could only find 10oz cans of the enchilada sauce and ended up using 2, and that was more than enough. I mixed in a little cheddar cheese with the jack. I should have let it sit a little longer before cutting into it because it was a little runny, but not too bad. Delish!

We thought this was really tasty but thought it could be a little more substantial. Next time I will try adding a few veggies for flavor and possibly rice or potatoes to make it less soupy.

This was very tasty and very easy!  The only change I made was that I used garlic pepper instead of garlic salt.  I also took others suggestion and mixed the chicken and the sour cream together.  Will definitely make this again!

This recipe turned out pretty well overall.  I did make the mistake of using flour tortillas instead of corn so they were a little soggy after baking, definitely will use corn if I make this again.  I also think that I will make the green chile sauce as well instead of buying the canned version.  However, for a quick and easy meal the canned stuff works out fine.

The first time I made this recipe my husband and I really enjoyed it!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time I made it for a larger group and changed it up a bit.  Everyone loved it and now I'm on my third time making it!  I use a rotissarie chicken that I purchase at the grocery store and just shred it.  Then I add a sauted onion and a can of fire roasted mild green chile peppers.  I don't char the torillas and only use 8 of them.  Nor do I cover the casserole when it's in the oven.  Great recipe, thanks SGRCOOK for the foundation!

This is a good starting point however I don't like the idea of eating all that sour cream so i substituted it for greek yogurt. I also sautéed one yellow chopped union with about 1/3 of chopped mushrooms. I mixed the sauteed mix with the yogurt, chopped fresh cilantro, and the shredded chicken which I boiled. Overall all it had great flavor. I topped the casserole with a shredded mexican cheese mx that I happened to have in my fridge 10-min before I pulled it out of the oven. 

What I will do differently next time: I will not chard the tortillas. Although it had great flavor it was slightly mushy, not soupy but not as firm as I would have liked. I will also consider adding green chilies or something to give it a spicy kick.

This was delicious.  I skipped charring the tortillas per advice from other reviewers.  I also mixed the sour cream in with the cooked chiken to make it easier to spread in the casserole. I also added a can of diced green chilis into the chicken mixture for a little more flavor.  I prepared everything the previous night & popped it in the over the next day afer work.  My whole family liked it, including my picky husband who is not a mexican food fan in general.

Great recipe!  Changes made:  I use ground chicken instead of whole (faster to make and tastes just as good), white corn tortillas over the grill, and for a little extra flavor I add avocados in my layers.  Yum!

My family liked this rendition of chicken enchilada casserole. I would definitely recommend cooking the chicken ahead to save on time if you are in a hurry. That way you don't spend time waiting for it to cool so you can shred it before adding it to the rest of the ingredients. Had I had the chicken ahead of time I surely would have cooked it a day before. It was surely easy enough to make but I followed the video more so than the written recipe. I didn't char the tortillas before adding them I just tore them in to fourths and I used a Mexican blend of cheese instead of just a shredded Monterrey jack. I also topped with my favorite Daisy Sour Cream and ripe avocado slices. I had to cook it much longer than the recipe called for. My oven is pretty right on with AllRecipes.Com so I was a bit surprised. I ended up cooking the casserole 75 minutes as appose to 45 minutes. All in all this recipe is a keeper in my house.

Good flavor!! I used left over meat from a roasted chicken (cut the recipe in 1/2 for just the two of us) so, it was 2 cups cooked chicken. Followed the recipe ingredients, but mixed the sour cream with the chicken and soaked some of the tortillas in the green chili sauce. I did not cook the tortillas. Served with garden fresh tomatoes, a sliced avocado and some refried beans. Great meal!!

Very good! I followed the base of this recipe and with my additions it was amazing! I pretty much baked the chicken in a light seasoning of garlic power and salt (didn't have garlic salt) and shredded it (definitely worth the extra time for the shredded chicken). I added one heaping spoonful of sour cream (my husband isn't a big fan but wanted to keep it moist). Also added half of a small can of green chiles for flavor. Mixed this with some of the cheese. Put a small layer of las palmas green enchilada sauce into pan, then the chicken mixture into the tortillas, closed them up, then topped with some cheese and some of the green sauce but definitely didn't need an entire can (maybe just over half the can). Awesome!

I too treated this as a base recipe and found reading the reviews and the suggestions very helpful.  I did a few things differently such as I slow cooker braised about three pounds bone in chicken thighs and drumsticks (quarters were on sale) and removed skin and extra fat and braised with 8 ounces of salsa verde, one can tomato & green chilis, one ancho chili, one guajillo chili, minced garlic, diced onion, cumin, ground coriander, and 1 can chicken broth on high for about 4 hours, cooled and shredded.  The braising liquid was so tasty after, I cooled, defatted and froze for the next time, as there will be a next time!

For the filling my additions were as many did, adding in enough sour cream to bind, 2 chipotles in adobo sauce minced, about half can diced tomatoes I had left over from my guacamole, chopped cilantro, garlic and onion powder, cumin, 4 ounce can of green chilis, and half a can of black beans and layered with wheat tortillas as we're not big fans of corn tortillas.   

I also used a Mexican four cheese blend mixed with Monterey.  This was a hit with me and my boyfriend as I prefer creamy yet savor dishes and he likes very spicy savory. So for him he ate with a splash more of the salsa verde and chipotles. Also, in reading comments about it being too saucy,  I used salsa verde and spread enough to cover the meat layer.  I found this keeping it moist but not runny.  I used a 9" round casserole dish which conformed nice to the 6" tortillas tearing as needed.

I used chicken thighs and added a can of green chilis, an onion and a can of pinto beans to the chicken mixture. Overall this was pretty good- I also added the sour cream to the meat which made mixing it easier. I will make it again.

My family loves this recipe.  I cook my chicken my in the microwave to save time.  I have even charred my tortillas on my small gas grill.  That way I can do a couple at the time.  I add some green onions to the chicken mixture and have used a variety of cheese.  Perfect everytime!

The first time, I always make the recipe as stated and this one was just too bland for us and a little dry.  Maybe we like spicy flavor more than most.  Anyway, the simplicity of the ingredients made me try again with changes.  I kept all of the same ingredients and only added 1 1/2 c. of cheddar cheese to the jack and a few Tablespoons of taco seasoning to the chicken.  That made the recipe outstanding!  So, I rated it 2 stars as stated but I really didn't need to make too many changes for our tastes. Also, the "torching" of the tortillas is a long, tedious process and tearing them up really does have the same effect.

I love the flavor of this casserole...but I don't like how the corn torillas just turn to mush :(  I will make this again, only I'll try using crushed corn tortilla chips instead of the corn tortillas.  I would also recommend a shredded mexican blend cheese just to add a bit more color.

Very easy to make, and tasty!  I made the recipe twice, both times mixing the sour cream in with the chicken.  The first time I used some green chile stew mix, because it was what I had on hand.  Two ladies at work saw it, and asked for the recipe, which I gave them (telling them where I found it).  One made it and said her family raved about it.  I made it with red, mild enchilada sauce tonight, and it's still good. I put the chicken in the crockpot for the day to make it very easy to shred.

This is in the oven as I write. I'm sure it will taste fine. I may tweak in next time to make it spicier or use pablano peppers on another pepper to give it more kick. I did find this to be MESSY and LABOR INTENSIVE. About like Lasangna with all the layers. Definitely not a "quick" enchilada recipe like stated. I'll probably make it again but I think the old roll enchilada's and pour stuff over method may be easier. I took other reviewers advice and soaked the corn tortillas in the enchilada sauce and also combined the chicken with the sour cream. Still messy with having to rinse off between all the layers due to messy fingers. I hope it is worth it. It sure does smell good and my husband and I love Mexican cuisine.

I made this over the weekend for cinco de mayo.  If I could give it another 1/2 star based on changes I made I would rate it a little better. There is nothing quick about the recipe but if I had bought a pre-cooked chicken that would have cut down on the time.  Also, when charring the tortillas I had 3 burners going at once to save time. I parboiled the chicken in chicken stock, onion and garlic. After shredding I added garlic powder, salt, cayenne and taco seasoning as it would have been way too bland otherwise.  I then added a small can of sliced olives and the sour cream to the chicken. Upon serving I put sour cream, spicy salsa, green onions and cilantro on top.  The condiments really completed the dish. My husband and his friend kept going back for more servings so I knew it was good.  I'm not much of a casserole girl but as far as casseroles go this is one I will make a couple times a year.

AMAZING!!! I will definitely make this again. I boiled my chicken with onions on stovetop instead of the oven. Much faster. After shredding, I mixed the chicken with sour cream and taco seasoning as suggested from everyone's comments. I'm glad I did, otherwise the chicken would probably be bland. I cooked everything else I directed on the recipe. The tortilla's do get softer but overall the casserole kept its shape. I think the reason why is because I let it sit for ten minutes to allow the sauce to harden/thicken. I will use crunchier tortillas for the next time. The other thing I would change the next time would be adding a little more spice or veggies such as bell peppers, cilantro and onions. I would also mix green onion on the top layer with the cheese as a garnish. Other than that, this was fabulous and fairly easy to make!

This is really good and will surely be making this again soon! I would give 5 stars if recipe would have stated the extra spices.  You really need to add some more seasoning to the chicken.  I boiled my chicken and did not bake.  As previous reviewers suggested, I mixed shredded chicken with sour cream and I added a lot of taco seasoning, some cumin, garlic salt and cayenne pepper.  I just kept adding until I could taste something.  I made more than recipe calls for and used a big glass pan.  I did not have a 1/2" of sauce on bottom of pan but maybe 1/4" or so.  Due to making a larger amount, I kept it in oven for an additional 30 minutes.

SOOO GOOOD I ate it for breakfast the next day!
I had to improvise a little because I didn't have chicken or the enchilada sauce.  I cooked ground turkey in taco seasoning instead of the chicken. And I mixed tomato sauce with taco seasoning to substitute the enchilada sauce. Oh, and I added waaay more cheese.    It was crazy good and I'm eating it right now!

It tasted really good but took a long time to make.  This is my fault as I did not have pre-cooked chicken.  I have a young son who does not permit me a lot of time in the kitchen.  My husband said he would have preferred it without the sauce.  I thought it was excellent.

Decent, but sort of plain. I would recommend cooking the chicken with cumin, garlic, salt, etc. Whatever spices you prefer. It just needs to be dressed up a bit.

I enjoyed this meal and will probably make again. I did not char tortillas and I cut back on the green chili enchilada sauce (used 2 small cans =20 oz.), because the only kind we could find had msg and lots of sodium.  I just might not have put a full 1/2 inch on bottom and used a spoon to make sure I covered the tortillas with a thin layer of sauce.  I did mix chicken, sour cream, and cheese in a bowl before putting in casserole and add a little taco seasoning as well.  Hard to go wrong with these ingredients!

I make this a lot: always a request!  I follow a very similar recipe, only layered in the crockpot!  (I've used chicken, beef, and "fake" crab, as well as adding beans, or whatever I happen to have!)  Fantastic recipe (browning the tortillas over the gas flame really adds to the flavor, but I've skipped this step sometimes, and used flour as well! A very versatile recipe!

Very tasty. I boiled the chicken and omitted charring the tortillas. The only disappointment  had was my flour tortillas- carb control were mushy. Maybe regular tortillas would have been best. Very flavorful.

My husband really liked this dish. I thought it was a bit on the bland side even though I added a packet of taco seasoning to the chicken/sour cream mixture other reviewers suggested. It made a lot of leftovers though and was better the next day.

My husband and I really liked this recipe! I added green chiles and onion to the mix, and cooked the chicken with taco seasoning and other spices. I think it would have been too bland otherwise. I mixed the sour cream, chicken, chiles, and onions together which made it a lot easier to spread. I will definitely make this again!
*Update - made it again and added some corn. My picky teenager loved it!

It's a great recipe considering how quick and easy it is. I followed someones advice below about not adding the sour cream at all, but just using it as a garnish. I'm glad I did this. I'll be making these again and may play with the recipe some. I'm glad i found this one.

Having a house-full of boys w/ totally different tastes, this is a HUGE hit!  I doubled the recipe and added 2 cans of diced hatch green chilies.  I mixed all the ingredients up w/ exception of a can of sauce - a lot easier.  Thanks for this recipe!  We're having it again tonight!

I made this recipe using other reviews recommendations & it was fabulous. I boiled the chicken, cut in quarters, in chicken broth with onions in garlic. Once cooked I cut into bite size pieces and placed in large bowl. I sauteed one finely chopped red pepper, one finely chopped onion and minced garlic and added to chicken. I mixed sour cream, salsa verde and taco seasoning with the chicken & veggies. I find it hard not to overeat with this dish!!

This is a delicious recipe!  I followed several of the other suggestions such as mixing the cream cheese combined with taco seasoning in the chicken before putting it in the casserole.  I also didn't char the tortillas and it worked out fine.  The only changes I made were that I seasoned the chicken with chili powder and minced onions in addition to the garlic salt, and I add an extra chicken breast.  This dish is a hit everywhere I take it!

This turned out to be a big mushy glob!  The flavor was good--with the addition of some chilies and seasoning--but I just couldn't get over the texture.  Forty-five minutes was way too long to bake.  I suspect the best remedy would be to take the extra time and roll up traditional enchiladas, top with the sauce and bake until heated through.

This dinner was a huge success for my family (meaning my kids ate it without protest).  The charring seemed too time-intensive so I just tore the tortillas in pieces and it worked great.  I also used 3 C shredded rotisserie chicken, thus saving the step of cooking the chicken.  I mixed the chicken together with the sour cream and 1/2 tsp salt.  Definitely will make this again!

We loved these enchiladas.  I don't have a gas stove, so I didn't char them.  It was quite the process to put them together.  Now that I've read other tips, I would mix the sour cream & chicken together & spread it.  I would maybe add some canned green chiles & onions.  I would definately make again.

I thought this recipe had a very nice taste. I was lazy and didn't char the tortilla and I boiled the chicken as someone else suggested - and I got confused about the layers (that's ok, I do it with lasagna too!) but despite all that, the dish turned out marvelously tasty. Had it for dinner last night and lunch (and dinner!!) today. Yum.

So delicious and so easy!!  To save time, I used Tyson pre-cooked, frozen chicken, which I heated in the microwave and then chopped in my food processor.  I added a little bit of Taco seasoning, and like many other people, skipped the charring of the tortillas.  I just tore mine into fourths.  This recipe is a keeper, even my 2 and 4 year olds enjoyed it!  I do recommend letting this cool for a few minutes before serving as it will make the portions easier to serve and more attractive on the plate.

This was delicious! I added the taco seasoning to the sour cream as suggested and added green chili's.  My boyfriend told me within 2 bites that he liked it, which for my boyfriend says a lot! I will definitely make this again.

This reminded us of one of oour favorites -- chicken chilaquiles. I made this a really quick meal by using frozen pre-grilled chicken. I also substituted Greek yougurt (0% fat) for the sour cream. We will definitely make this again!

Great recipe.  I cooked the chicken in a slow cooker and then shredded.  Added onions, green chiles, diced tomatoes and garlic to shredded chicken.  Then stirred in the sour cream.  Charred/toasted the tortillas for added flavor.  Poured green chile enchilada sauce in bottom and started layering.  Dipped remaining levels of tortillas in sauce verses pouring on top to avoid sogginess.  Did not use taco seasoning as suggested by some, but may try this next time.  Perfect casserole stype dish.  Very filling and had plenty of leftovers.

OMG! This is just amazing! My husband's exact words, "This is so good"...(scoops another mouth full)..."this is the bomb"!.  I have to agree...much better than I thought it would be. Just randomly selected this dish because it popped up on the screen.  I even used canned chicken breast that I seasoned and heated in the microwave to save time! Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  This recipe will definitely be going in the rotation.

This was super tasty and easy.  My 8 year old, who told me " I hate enchilada casserole" had 3 helpings!  It did get a bit mushy, but i did not char the tortillas as I do not have a gas stove.

Simple yet tasty!  I skipped charring the tortillas and added a can of diced green chile-I also used a 15 oz can of enchilada sauce instead of the 28 oz.  This was a quick and easy way to feed the kiddos enchiladas for dinner!  Will make again!

Other than adjusting cooking times for chicken in my oven, I followed the recipe to the letter. We went back for thirds. My boyfriend typically won't eat leftovers, but he broke his habit for this dish. This is going to be a repeat favorite for us.

Really Yummy! Seriously simple to throw together and great for lunch the next day too! I followed the directions except to substitute shredded rotisserie chicken since it was a time crunch day. It was perfectly seasoned and not too spicy for my four kids, who cleaned their plates (and with picky eaters, they almost never do!) My soldier and his guys raved about it! Thank you, this will definitely be in regular dinner rotation!

This was easy and very good. I prepared my chicken with a dry rub of taco seasoning and grilled it on my grill pan. Then, like others, I mixed it together with the sour cream. I didn't char the tortillas, just soaked them in the sauce. I also added part of a can of chopped green chiles. I will definitely be making this again.

made it for my fiance tonight. He loved it!!!  I made some changes suggested by others. I coated the tortillas instead of charring it. Also I used chicken thighs and cooked them with salsa in a slow cooker.  I'm very full from eating two helpings of the casserole tonight, but I can't wait to eat it the leftovers for lunch tomorrow! :)

I have never had green enchilada sauce, and I LOVE it!  I opened the can, and knew right away that I was going to like it because it smelled so good.  It has great flavor and just the right amount of "hot" spice to it.  This was easy to make, and although, as others have noted, is not the prettiest casserole, it is downright outrageously good.  I will make this one often, just because I liked it so much!!!  Thank you, thank you!

THIS WAS SUCH A GREAT RECIPE!!! The first time I made this recipe I brought this to a potluck...it was the hit of the party! Everyone was asking for the recipe and asking how hard it was!  It was VERY easy to make.  I added some chopped canned chiles to the layering and then some black olives to the top of the casserole. I will make this one over and over and over and over.....

Delicious recipe! I made this using homemade green sauce and chicken I cooked in the crockpot the night before.  I replaced 1/2  of the sour cream with plain greek yogurt to cut down on the fat. It came out perfect! Light and delicious!  This recipe is a keeper.

I really liked the flavor of this dish, it was just enough.  I also mixed the chicken and sour cream, did not char the tortillas, but tore them into big chunks, soaking them in the leftover chile sauce.  It worked fairly well.  Aside from being a little time comsuming, there are several shortcuts you can take, such as pre-cooked chicken being the biggest shortcut.  Mine came out just a little soggy, but not too bad.  I will definitely be making this again!

Ok, I changed this recipe so much....but the idea was wonderful! Heres what I did....I used flour tortillas torn into 4ths, and layered it over the green sauce at the bottom of the pan, then in a bowl, I mixed diced chicken (frozen), 8 oz of sour cream, 1 small can diced green chilis, 1 seeded jalepeno, 1 bunch of green onion and a little of the green sauce, mixed it all together and poured on top of the tortillas.  Then I spread 2 cups of jack and cheddar cheese over the chicken, and tore another 5 flour tortillas and placed over the top of the cheese, poured the remainder of the green sauce (I used only 1 large can for the whole recipe) and then sprinkled a handful  of cheese on top for looks :0) I got RAVE reviews for this recipe....I will definately be making again.  I imagine it will work perfectly frozen up until the point of baking....I'm going to try it!  Thanks for the idea!

Love it!!  I had 5 women coming over to eat and everyone one of them loved it.  I might have thought it was just lip service but they all had seconds and 2 of them asked for the recipe later.  I love spicy food but I knew my guess did not.  Next time I make it for my husband and I will be adding some extra's, can't wait to see how it will turn out.

This was good. First time I made this as stated. It was a bit bland. certainly was missing something. Second time I seasoned chicken with Tony's and baked then shredded. I added taco seasoning to the sour cream and a few dashes of cayenne only because we love the heat! I also top with olives and green onion. Thanks!

Five star if you do this: boil and shred the chicken.  Mix sour cream, 4 oz. can diced jalapenos, 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, and chicken for the filling.  Sprinkle the top with fresh cilantro.  I didn't char the tortillas, just cut them in fourths.  Spicy and delicious!!

I just made this for the first time, for five friends for dinner, and it was a huge success. I made it using shrimp in place of chicken, just defrosting some large shelled, deveined shrimp and then marinating most of the day in lime juice. Everything else I did just as called for in the recipe, but without charring the tortillas. Huge success, everyone had seconds and even thirds. Definitely a keeper!

Yummy - took some to neighbors, who also liked it. I poached the chicken in chicken broth, did not char the tortillas, pre-soaked the tortillas in green enchilada sauce, alternated one layer with green enchilada sauce and one with salsa (not enough green sauce on hand), and added some seasoned black beans.  We'll make this one again!

We loved this recipe! I did soak the corn tortillas first and didn't just dump the sauce in the pan, so it wouldn't be soupy. Also we used pepper jack cheese, and it was awesome!

I love this recipe, but make it easier on yourself if you can.  If you have a Foreman grill, do yourself a favor and grill the chicken, 5 min and your chicken is ready to shread.  I also add some chopped green chiles for spice, and 1/2 a container of cream cheese to make it extra creamy. YUM!

You can't go wrong with this recipe.  I slow cook my chicken breast in 2 cans of chopped tomatoes with green chili for 6 hours or so before assembling these, so it's shredded and flavorful.  I have toasted the tortillas and done nothing and both ways was delicious.  I also never use enchilada sauce, rather just lots of diced green chili.  Keeps it gluten free!

This was so easy and so good! I added some of my own touches though that made it way more flavorful in my opinon. I cut up 4 chicken breasts in cubes and sauteed them in a pan on the stove with some chopped onion and fresh crushed garlic and seasoned with salt, pepper, Cumin and Chilli Powder. Removed chicken from pan and mixed the sour cream and chicken together. I put a 1/2 inch of sauce on the bottom of my baking dish, tore up about 6 corn tortilas and layered the chicken sour cream mixture, black olives and cheese. I soaked the tortillas in the enchilada sauce instead of pouring it in. I did pour the lilttle ramaining sause i had on top when i finished layering everything. After baking if for 45 minutes , i lte it cool down for about 5 minutes then put it in the fridge for about 15 so it would "set" quicker. I served it with Spanish Rice and my husband LOVED it!

Very very good. I used 30 oz of green chili enchilada sauce since I could only find 10 oz cans. I also used colby  jack cheese since thats all I had on hand. I would not skip on the charring of the torts it adds a nice flavor to the dish. I made this yesterday evening and stuck it in the fridge for DH to bake today. This method worked very well. Just take it out and sit on the counter to warm a bit then bake as directed. Will be using this one again!

Really good!  I was kind of surprised with myself, I thought it really tasted like restaurant quality.  My picky husband even liked it.  I poached the chicken so it would not be dry, and only made half(I knew the kids would never try it)  I am having a large group for dinner next weekend, I think I will make a large one, and try one with red enchilada sauce and ground beef.

Really good!  Boiled the chicken, rather than baking.  Boiled chicken shreds really easily.  Mixed shredded chicken with the sour cream and spices and added diced green chilis.  Didnt have green sauce, so I used red and this was GREAT!  Might double up on the tortillas as the bottom layer next time, so they dont turn out as mushy, but otherwise this was REALLLY GOOD!!

This was very good and very easy!  My family really enjoyed it, but I needed to add a little more to it to get the flavor I wanted.  I cooked the chicken in the crock pot in a 1/4 C of chicken broth and a can of RoTel tomatoes.  Then, like other reviewers I also added some red enchilada sauce with the green.  Still....could've been a little spicier for me, but a very good recipe!!!

Great recipe for the family! I found this a wonderful solution for what to do with whole chicken fryers. (I hate having to cut up raw chickens since they're so messy.) Instead, I just boiled the whole chicken with a large chopped onion (just quartered) and about 2 tbsp powdered oregano, salt and pepper. After it was done and cooled a little, it easily came off the bone and had a great flavor. Layered as instructed and put in the oven. I bet this is easily adaptable to bulk cooking too! Thanks for the recipe!!! A+++!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!! Hubby loved it and has requested it on regular rotation.  We diced the chicken and cooked it on the stovetop.  Instead of sour cream and green chili sauce, we used cream of chicken and salsa verde sauce b/c this was all we had in the pantry. We added diced jalepanos for spice and it turned out awesome!!! We will be making this again and again!

YUM!! I put my chicken in the crock-pot this morning with water, some chicken bouillon cubes, big chunks of onion, whole cloves of garlic, and chunks of celery. Seasoned it with a little garlic salt, rosemary and black peppercorns. Came home and shredded the chicken and diced up some of the onion and mixed it with a little more seasoning. I did char the tortillas, and I didn't have any sour cream so I used some non fat plain yogurt, which worked well. It was REALLY good and looked so great. Give this recipe a try, you won't be disappointed!!

Very, very yummy! My picky son had two servings.  I followed the recipe with the exception of not charring the tortillas and using colby/jack cheese. It turned out perfect and tasted just like my favorite sour cream chicken enchiladas from a mexican restaurant. This is a keeper!

Awesome! The best homemade enchiladas. I used a whole rotisserie chicken from Albertsons and took all the meat off and chopped it a bit. Everyone had seconds, even my 2 year old granddaughter. I took some for lunch the next day and they were great. I can't say enough about these.

Made a few changes in this.  Only made 4 servings but used about 3/4 of the 28-oz enchilada sauce and added 1/2 cup diced onions and one finely diced jalapeno to chicken mixture.  I did "toast" the tortillas in a nonstick skillet.  They didn't go completely to mush as others commented.  We really did like this but it's similar to Green Chili and Cheese Chicken on this site and I think we prefer that to this.  Also that seems less labor-intensive than this.  The addition of the jalapeno added just enough heat for me.

Made it for a Father's Day church dinner.  The theme was Mexican Fiesta so this dish was perfect.  The only change I made to this recipe was poaching the chicken instead of grilling or roasting.  The chicken is much more tender.  I also mixed the sour cream with the chicken as suggested in some of the reviews. I also charred the corn tortillas in a very lightly oiled skillet.  Got great comments. Although "not quick" but definitely easy.

I liked this but my boyfriend wasn't a big fan.  I followed another reviewer's advice and mixed the chicken and sour cream together before spreading.  I also added 1 finely diced jalapeno and some fresh cilantro to the enchilada sauce, which was a really nice flavor.  The corn tortillas turned kind of mushy, and as I was serving it, my boyfriend asked if there were mashed potatoes in the casserole!

The whole family loved this.  Like others I used the large can of enchilada sauce and thought it was perfect.  I made this dairy free by using Tofutti Sour Cream and soy cheeses and used corn tortillas to make it gluten free and it tasted great for the whole family.  One dish wonders in our house are rare and I love it when I find a recipe that please everyones palate and meets everyones dietary needs.

This is a great recipe.  I've made it twice and my son craves it. The first time I made it he ate half the pan. I found it was easier to mix the sour cream with the chicken for easier spreading.  It is saved under my favorites.

I prepared this recipe in a 9x13 and think it would be much better in an 11x7.  I did not use 16 oz of monterey jack cheese, I only used 12 ounces and could have cut it back to 8 oz without any complaints. This was quite tasty and we will be making it again.

Very good- I made some modifications based on what I had...I had shredded pork and red enchilada sauce (which I realize changes the recipe a bit). But, it tasted very good and this seems like a really good basic enchilada recipe to build from. Thanks for sharing it!

YUM! This recipe is a keeper!  I only made a few adjustments to the preparation method to better suit me.  I was starving and don't consider 1 1/2 hrs total cooking time "quick" as the name calls it.  I cooked the chicken on the stove top and then shredded it.  I mixed the shredded chicken and sour cream together as others suggested to make it easier to spread.  I did not char the tortillas as I don't have a gas stove, but I did tear the tortillas into fourths as the submitter suggested.  As for the rest of the preperation, I followed the recipe as stated.  It turned out wonderful and I look forward to eating the leftovers and making this again in the future.

I used "Pato" sauce and heated the tortillas in vegetable oil. Also, I used Mexican sour cream (no salt), on top only, right before serving. I have also used a jack and cheddar mix. Extremely popular at office potlucks!

Delicious & quick.  I used leftovers and toned down the spicy sauce and cooked chicken tenderloins in frying pan with a tbsp of olive oil beforehand. Added sliced boiled & broiled potatoes, black olives, and chopped 4 sprigs of cilantro (leaves) for each layer. Added a can of Campbell's cream of celery and cream of chicken to can of enchilada sauce, whisked it together in a bowl. Cooked in oven or microwave to melt cheese. Served with a tbsp of sour cream to cut down acidity. (Personally, I like to mix it all up when I eat it, reminds me of chile verde.)

There is nothing quick or easy about this recipe! It took my husband nearly 2 hours from start to finish, although the last 45 minutes was all baking. We loved the end result, but I think I'll look for a slow cooker enchilada recipe because this just took too long for a weekday night recipe. We'll probably make it again, but it's not what it was billed as.

This was really tasty and really cheesy.  I ended up with way too many tortillas left over, so I am not sure what went wrong.  I think next time I will do a couple of layers of tortillas for each tortilla layer.

I also followed other reviewers and mixed the chicken with the sour cream mixture before spreading it.  I also added additional spices like chili powder and onion powder to the mixture before spreading it. It added another layer of flavor, but I am sure the dish would have been fine without it.

Instead of baking the chicken, I coated them in:  2 TBSP Lemon Juice, 2 TBSP Olive Oil, and 1/2 a packet of Taco seasoning.  Then, I grilled them.. I thought the baked chicken would be too plain, and this mexican grilled version was delicious.  To shred, I put them in the food processor.  Yum!

Yummy!  I have made this recipe several times, everyone has loved it. Don't skip the charring of the tortilla step, it really adds a wonderful flavor. I've not always had access to a gas burner to char the tortillas, but have found an electric burner at medium high heat (#7) works just as well.  The tortillas didn't stick and actually charred better than the gas.

Made this for dinner tonight.  After I got through the first layer in prep, I remembered other reviews about mixing together the chicken and sour cream so I did that too.  And I went ahead and mixed the enchilada sauce into it as well, figuring that's how it would look when it was done cooking and it was much easier to deal with.  Husband RAVED about this and I liked it too...this is a major compliment coming from a non-green chile eater...would highly recommend this recipe, just mix the layer fillers together before cooking for the easiest way to put it together.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was good and easy so it's an automatic 4 stars in my book.  I found it a little soupy but I think any casserole of this type just is that way so we didn't mind.  I'll make again no question.

I thought the flavor was really nice but the texture was just off to me.  It needed some crunch.  I think next time I will add some crushed up tortilla chips to the top close to the end of baking.  Instead of baking the chicken I cooked it in the slow cooker with the enchilada sauce on low for 6 hours, then pulled the chicken out of the sauce to shred it.  Put dinner on the table quicker that way.  I also added some Chalula Hot Sauce for an extra kick.  My husband loved it so I will be making it again!!  Thanks a lot!

I have never used green enchilada sauce before until today.  I had four teenagers over to test it out.  It was so wonderful I had NO leftovers.  Which says a lot for my food.  I am not the best cook!  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

This was great and so easy to make. My four year old thought it was too spicy. The rest of the family liked it. Thanks for an easy family meal.

This was just ok, not great.  I didn't have any problems with it being too runny or anything, it just wasn't great.  Also, it takes like two hours to make with baking the chicken and then baking the casserole, so it's not exactly 'quick.'  I wanted to love it!

I was a little skeptical, but this turned out to be surprisingly tasty! I wouldn't call it quick and easy, however. I used canned chicken and seasoned it with garlic salt to save time, and I also mixed in the sour cream as others suggested. The sour cream took on a weird consistency after baking, but I guess that's bound to happen. This made the house smell good, and we had plenty of leftovers to freeze for another meal!

This was really good!  All I could find was the 10 ounce enchilada sauce, so I used 3 which made it easy to divide it into 3 layers.  To save time, I broiled my tortillas, I could do 9 at a time that way and it was done in a flash.  I did not have trouble with anything being mushy.  Next time, I may use left-over blackened chicken because I like my stuff a little spicier.  This recipe is great as printed, though.

I LOVE this recipe, and everyone I share it with loves it too! I always use the Sargento's Mexican blend cheese, and it works out perfectly every time! I also top with sliced black olives and sour cream. (I don't add the sour cream in the recipe, b/c my husband doesn't do white condiments.) Simple and delightful!

This was yummy, but it is definitely not quick if you follow the recipe exactly. I think it would be a lot easier also to mix the sour cream with the chicken.

I absolutely loved this recipe, especially since I added black beans, a can of chopped tomatoes, and jalapenos to the chicken/sour cream mixture, but anything that has me charring tortillas and baking for 45 minutes isn't quick...plan accordingly :)

Quick, easy.  I used a green tomatillo sauce instead of the enchilada sauce and mixed different kinds of cheeses.  Nice, easy casserole.

Since I moved to Tucson in February, I've been experimenting with making more Southwestern-style foods, and this is one that I have absolutely fallen in love with. It's easy to make (as per the recipe title) and is SO good. My fiance absolutely loves it and begged me to make it for tonight's dinner. The last time I made it, the guests mentioned that it was like "Mexican lasagna", which definitely sounded like a good name to me. Great stuff!

We thought this was pretty good, but I think it would be better topped with the White Cheese Sauce from this site.

I love this recipe. It's not much work and tastes wonderful.  I was worried about the enchilada sauce but it was mild and added a great flavor.

A great recipe. I only had once can of enchillada sauce so I took the advice of another reviewer and used some salsa as well. I will definitely make this again, although next time I will either use a spicier sauce, or add some green chillis/jalepenos to give it some kick.

I made this the night before a potluck at work.  I heated it in the microwave and it was delicious.  I came back on allrecipes to print copies of it for friends and to write this review.  I charred the tortillas and cut them in quarters. I also used a whole pre-cooked chicken that I bought at the market. I will definitely make this again!

This tastes like it came from a restaurant.  I use 2 small cans of enchilada sauce -- the 28 oz. size makes it too runny (but still delicious).

My family found this dish to be good, but it was kind of bland. So I would make it again but use spicy enchilada sauce, the mild was too mild. I also mixed the sour cream with the chicken, added sliced black olives, and used CoJack cheese for about one fourth of the cheese, not just all Jack. I also threw in a can of green chopped chilis. I did not char the tortillas and see no reason for doing so. They kind of just disappear into the dish once it gets cooked anyway.

Quick, it is not if you follow the recipe.  I used canned chicken instead.  
It turned out soupy, but the flavor was good.  The kids loved it.  The hubby & I say it wasn't that great...

First off this was GREAT! instructions were a bit confusing but not too hard to figure out what she meant! I used mild enchilada sauce but it seemed to be too bland so I added some chili powder to it. My suggestion is, if you like it a bit spicy use Medium Green chili sauce! My son and husband (me, too) loved it! I will definitely be making it again!!!!!!!

This was the best chicken enchilada casserole ever!!!  I also mixed the sour cream with the chicken together, and just used the corn tortillas as is without charring---came out delicious!!  Everyone loved it, this will become a regular in my book!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Quick and Easy....hummm. Well the recipe was excellent, though the prep was not so quick. Unfortunately my children did not like it but they are young.  I enjoyed the recipe but quick is a bit of a stretch.

Followed the recipe with one change....didn't char the tortillas....they totally disintegrated anyway so I got a gloppy sloppy mess.....not even close to the picture.  Can't imagine why the results are so different.  Thank goodness I just made this for my husband and son...didn't look good but tasted ok.

Super easy to throw together, especially since I had pre-cooked chicken to use up. Didn’t worry about spreading the sour cream, just did dollops since it would melt when baking. Also did not toast the tortillas, don’t have a gas stove and besides it absorbs liquid better if the tortillas are just raw. Since it calls to bake covered, I uncovered and put it under the broiler for a few minutes before I pulled it out.

This was a hit, I'll definitely be adding this into rotation often! I made this tonight and it was amazing. I did not add the sour cream to the dish but offered it as an option on the side. I also soaked the top layer of tortillas in half of the sauce while I was preparing all the ingredients to layer. My casserole had just the right amount of moisture and wasn't soupy as others suggested.

I followed the recipe and even put in less of the enchilada sauce per some of the other reviews here, but it still turned out soupy and fairly unflavorful.  The longer it sat, the less soupy it became but it just needed more  flavor.  The sour cream separated, which looked unappetizing but was ok.  Maybe try more spices and adding veggies,  salsa or beans.  I probably won't make again.

Great recipe. I make my chicken enchilada casserole similarly, except I mix the sour cream with the shredded chicken because it mixes better, and I add a can off green chilies and sliced black olives to the layers. I always get rave reviews!

Quick, easy and delicious! Made exactly as written but did not char the tortillas, and DID mix sour cream into chicken before layering. (Wasnt sure what "a medium baking" dish meant, but used a 9X13 baking dish and fit perfectly)

I forgot the sour cream, so we added it on top before serving.  Much easier than regular enchiladas.  Will definately make again.

I followed the directions exactly, except I used shredded rotisserie chicken from Costco.  It was a soupy, sloppy, soggy and bland mess. The sour cream broke down and though it wasn't curdled in flavor, it had the appearance of being curdled. It wasn't a pleasant sight in the plate at all.  I was actually embarrassed to present it to my family.

I added about a cup of frozen corn, a can of black beans rinsed, a 4 oz can of sliced black olives and a 4 oz can of green chopped chiles drained.  Very good and everyone went back for seconds.

It was very easy, but didn't have much flavor. I will try again but probably double up on the seasonings.

My family loves this recipe. The kids always gobble it up and ask for seconds, and they never ask for seconds for anything! It's a good recipe for kids to help make, too. I have given it to friends and they like it as well.

I make the shredded chicken in my instant pot, cool it, and mix with the sour cream. I also do what the reviewer suggested about coating the tortillas in the sauce by dipping in a pie plate. 

I use garlic powder or garlic salt, whichever I have on hand. But I think the recipe is best with garlic powder added liberally and then salt added to taste. You can only add so much garlic salt before it's too salty, but by using the powder, you can add as much garlic as you want and not add too much salt

Throw your chicken into a crock-pot along with a small (drained) can of tomatoes and chilis.  I also added a dash of onion and garlic powder.  Cook on low for a couple of hours.      ( stir it up after an hour or so).  Don't overcook it ..drain any liquid.  When cool, shred the chicken with tomatoes and all.  I followed other suggestions....cut up the tortillas and soak in the green enchilada sauce.  I sauteed 1/2 of a finely-diced onion, jalapeno and garlic clove. ..5-10 minutes.  Add the shredded chicken, sour cream, juice of a lemon, handful of chopped cilantro and a few dashes of taco seasoning.  Mix it up. Taste and adjust seasonings as preferred.  Layer with sauce at the bottom, tortillas, chicken mixture and don't skimp on the cheese ! I mixed sharp cheddar with the Jack cheese.  WOW....fantastico !

I made this a few days ago,  The Charred tortillas really make this recipe.  I used whole corn tortillas.  I also added a package of Birds eye southwest proteins  Its a steam fresh variety.  I layered this with everything  else. I also cooked my chicken breast in my crock pot with the enchilada sauce all day. Served with my homemade salsa on the side .  It turned out great.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I used too much green sauce, unfortunately, but thought it had a nice flavor. I also used 6 large  flour tortillas instead of corn. I’ll try this one again and use much less sauce!

We enjoyed this very much.  I did make a couple of changes though.  I used my favorite brand of tortilla chips in place of frying corn tortillas.  I also added refried beans and used leftover grilled chicken breasts.

This casserole turned into a sloppy mess with soggy tortillas and goo. It needs more substance. Perhaps the corn tortillas should be toasted first and green onions, peppers and beans should be added into it. 
Very disappointed. I guess I'm an Authentic Tex-Mex cuisine girl.

My family loved it. My teenage son's frriends said if rating as 10 is the highest, they would give it a 10.2. I modified the recipe a bit. I cooked frozen chicken breasts in the crock pot with onion and spices. Added diced chilis, chili powderr, fresh garlic, garlic salt, and taco seasoning to the chicken after I cut it up.

Family loved it. Will make it again. Adjustments I made are:
Used rotisserie chicken. Shredded it. Cooked it with 1 onion, 1 red pepper, 1 can mild diced chilis, 1 package taco seasoning. Let liquid cook off for about 10 minutes. 

Did not mix sour cream into chicken. Added it later at table.

Will definitely make this again. I didn't char the tortillas as I don't have flame stove top burners, but it didn't turn out soggy at all just adding them soft. I think next time I might add some black beans to it!

Loved the flavor the charred tortillas added. I had to un-spice mine to fit tastebuds in my household and it was  still very tasty. Planning to make a rendition of this recipe again. Served with black olives, sour cream and chopped green onion. Served with Zataran's Cilantro Lime rice which was a tasty choice.

Great simple recipe. Always perfect. I adjust the portions smaller because of my small family and when cooking the chicken I add taco seasoning for a little extra kick. Great when you have left over chicken.

This was great. I made some minor changes based on availability of ingredients. I had a 12 oz jar of enchilada sauce from Trader Joe's,  and used all of that plus all of a jar of red salsa to take the place of the 28oz can of sauce. It worked and tasted fine. Tearing and soaking the tortillas in the sauce in a pie tin helped to soften them. I wish there was a little more sauce. Mixing the shredded chicken and sour cream helped a lot too during the spreading of layers. This 9x13 pan provided many meals throughout the week for work lunches. It was plated with green onion and cilantro on top, and a dollop of greek yogurt, and a side of canned refried beans (Amy's are good).

We used leftover cooked chicken breasts, probably only about 1/3 the amount the recipe called for and it was plenty of chicken and delicious.  We also were a little short on the corn tortillas so supplemented with some broken up tortilla chips for the top layer.  We just mixed them with the enchilada sauce and it worked out perfectly.   Also forgot to cover it while baking.  This could be the best chicken enchilada casserole I've ever made and  I think this recipe would be equally good with leftover pork roast .

I like the relative ease of this enchilada recipe but do think it needs some doctoring up.  I added a can of chiles, fresh garlic, and taco seasoning to the meat.

This is a great recipe, super easy. I boiled a whole chicken for stock and made some soup, I was going to use the meat to make curry chicken and decided enchiladas sounded better! I didn't char the tortillas, I ripped them into a few pieces like others suggested. I also mixed the sour cream with the chicken so it was easier to spread. I added some cumin and chives from my herb garden. I baked covered for the 45 minutes and then removed the foil and cooked an additional 15 and it was perfect. Tons of flavor! Great recipe.

Made last night for dinner. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, as that's what I had on hand. I had 6 thighs, which doesn't really equal 4 breasts, which is likely why I didn't have enough chicken to make 2 layers. I mixed the sour cream with the chicken as per other reviewers, and spread on top of the first layer of tortillas. I didn't char my tortillas, and soaked them in the sauce like others had suggested. I didn't use quite the entire can of enchilada sauce, but almost. This was quite tasty, and I look forward to making it again with the correct amount of chicken. :)

It was a little liquidy. I'm not sure if it was the enchilada sauce but I'll probably use less next time. We will also probably not use the sour cream. It almost turned into ricotta cheese and I don't think it really added anything to the flavor (I might be wrong and will add it again once I try the recipe without it.

As with other reviews I made alot of revisions. I mixed the sour cream with the chicken and added black beans, fresh cilantro, taco seasoning and some cayenne pepper. We are from Texas and love Mexican food. The original recipe was just too bland for our liking. We loved the way I made it. Even added some green verde sauce with it. Came out Perfect. This recipe can be adapted to anyones likes or dislikes.

I'm sure it's very good as written but I'm not good at sticking to a recipe.  I used half sour cream mixed with half Greek yogurt.  Stirred that into the chicken along with  minced cilantro and jalapeño.  Topped each layer with diced  green onion and tomatoes then sprinkled with cheese.  I dipped the cut-to-fit-my-pan tortillas in some roasted tomatillos sauce.  The more I can slide veggies into a dish the better we like it!  I would definitely make this again

Definitely easy to make!  I doubled the recipe planning on leftovers but it was gone the first night.   We personally prefer more flavors so I did do a few things but this was a great way to get started.  Served with Spanish rice and black beans.

This is my new favorite. My husband doesn't care for chicken and will not eat leftovers. He said we can have this Tomorrow too. We had it 3 days in a row. I used left over thighs and legs from the night before. I also used gluten free tortillas. They turned to mush but it was still great. I took the advice of others and mixed the chicken with the  sour cream and added Taco seasoning. I might try corn tortillas next time. If you try this one you'll want it again! Great recipe. The reviews made it even better. Thank you for the good advice.

Taste is fantastic but the title "quick" doesn't belong on a recipe that takes 2 hours to make. It's a lot of steps, too, and I used pre-cooked chicken. I added frozen green peppers for some veggies but I think next time I'll add corn too. Love the taste! By the way, what is a medium baking dish? I used 9x13 and I could only fit 3 tortillas per layer not 6. Oh, and I used fat free sour cream.

First time I made this, will definitely make it again.  Made it exactly as the recipe says although I might not of charred the tortilla shells as much as they should be (at least at the beginning).  Charring the tortillas takes a little bit of time but is a must.  The only thing I might do different next time is season the chicken with some cumin and garlic before baking.   YUM!

I had leftover chicken but not quite enough so I mixed in a can of rinsed/drained black beans. Great addition! I used  pepper jack cheese which was delicious and not too spicy. My corn tortillas ended up being a little too thick. I wish I had used less of them. Next time, I'll try flour tortillas - whole without tearing. No need to toast them first. I took the advice of one reviewer who put 1/2" sauce in bottom and then used the rest of the sauce only for dipping the tortillas. Good call! Not too soupy. Baked covered until last few min when I removed the foil to brown the cheese a bit. Rested for 10 min before cutting. Topped with fresh salsa and shredded lettuce to serve.

This turned out so tasty.  Only had 12 tortillas on hand and a big jar of green salsa, and it still came out super delicious, everyone was happy.  Sliced olives on top took it up a notch.  Thanks for the recipe !! A new favorite for sure

Some changes I would make;
I would use a larger can of Enchilada sauce.
28 oz. wasn't really enough.
I would use yellow cheese rather than white, to give the dish some color.
And I would add a large, chopped, sautéed onion and a couple small cans of diced green chili to the chicken to give it more flavor.
My family rated it at a 4 (out of 5)

I made this for my family and they loved it.  I was in a hurry and cooked the chicken on the stove with garlic salt and pepper. Because it was on top it made juice that I added just a sprinkle of chicken bouillon and poured this broth over the casserole. I used a whole 16 oz container of sour cream and 16oz of shredded cheese. Definitely let it set before serving. Makes a wonderful thick sauce and the flavors were wonderful.  This is easy enough for my son to make on his own.

4.5 stars.  I made this as written, only adding onion, minced garlic, chopped Serrano peppers and cumin.  I planned to add cilantro, but forgot.  I could only find 2 cans of green enchilada sauce (10 oz. each),  so I added a can of red enchilada sauce too.  Didn't char my tortillas, just tore them, and the casserole turned out just right.  I would make this again.

I've made my own version of this before but wanted to try this recipe. I wasn't thrilled... at all.  The tortillas were mushy and their flavor got lost. The chicken.. precooked with just garlic salt was more than a little blah. I cook mine with fresh garlic, onions, salt, pepper and one jalapeno pepper with it's innards removed cut in half . The jalapeno gets removed after the chicken is cooked and set aside to be diced and used by anyone who wants some extra heat at the table.  The jalapeno doesn't add heat to the chicken but adds a layer of flavor that can't be beat. 
I also use precooked corn tortillas, the kind used for tostadas. Nice and crunchy to start with they seem to hold up much better. But I've also used corn tortillas I've lightly fried in olive oil like I do when I'm making regular enchiladas. They work well enough but I prefer starting with the crispy ones.  Not lightly frying the tortillas makes them turn to an unpleasant tasting raw tortilla mushy grainy substance. 
Where are the green onion bits (chives) and sliced black olives that always top enchiladas? Those are an absolute must. It doesn't matter if you make them this way or the regular rolled individual enchiladas - enchiladas are all about layers of flavors. The cheese choice matters in a major way when making enchiladas. Never ever use cheddar or similar type cheese in chicken enchiladas. Use Asadero cheese. It's readily available in most grocery stores and takes enchiladas, regular or casserole, up 5

This is a great casserole to make as a couple.  There is always something for each person to be working on and it helps to have an extra set of hands.  I put frozen chicken into the crock pot with 2 cups of broth and cooked on high for 2 hours.  Everything was tender and juicy.  I will absolutely make this dish again!

I skipped the charring step just to make it easier. Next time maybe I'll try it. I'm sure it would be good. I sautéed diced onion, added fresh garlic, and then browned the chicken breast in a frying pan. Using a Kitchen Aid stand mixer to shred the chicken is so quick and easy.

Based on the reviews, I used the entire 28 oz of green chile enchilada sauce, cut the tortillas into four pieces, and "braised" them in the green sauce.  The bottom layer did come out a little soggy (but perfect the next day), but I also think I put too much sauce on the bottom.  Next time, I will use less than 1/2 inch on the bottom.  Excellent dish!   I am making it again in a few weeks for Bunco night.  Thanks for sharing!

These were really easy and good. I did add chopped cilantro to the filling and on top to add some flavor. Served them with a drizzle of a mixture of sour cream, cilantro, and lemon or lime juice and my family loved it.

This is a very forgiving recipe.  I used it as a guideline and took other reviews to heart.  I used boiled (with spices added) boneless skinless thighs because I didn't have breasts.  These were good, but not as easy to shred.  I used a package of taco seasoning from another reviewer.  I used salsa verde instead of enchilada sauce, about 1 and a half jars of TJs brand.  I used less cheese because of family preference.  Just tore up the tortillas, about 7 in all.  Used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream due to what I had on hand.  Did not cover the pan in the oven.  Added the top layer of cheese for the last 10 min and included fresh sliced tomatoes and fresh sliced green onions with that cheese layer for looks and fresh flavor.  Tortillas did get mushy, but that's OK with us.  Hubby says this is a keeper.

I used corn tortillas and flour tortillas. The casserole with the corn tortillas turned out less soupy. I used greek yogurt in place of sour cream but honestly couldn't tell it was there with all the sauce. We used green onionsnand queso fresco to top for serving. I had to bake at 375 F for the last 20 min uncovered to evaporate some of the sauce.

This recipe is super simple  to make, although I prepare mine a little differently, and am rating it based on those modifications. 1) The garlic salt is not necessary when baking the chicken. It adds no discernible flavor. 2) Don't layer the chicken and sour cream separately. Instead, mix the chicken in a bowl with a few scoops of sour cream, a few scoops of cream of chicken, and a can of green chiles (you'll need the flavor, and can do mild or hot depending on your palette) I know I always get frustrated when people don't list the ingredient amounts, but I just go until the end mixture is moist but not overly wet. 3) I layer as follows: 1/3 sauce on bottom, torn tortillas to cover, 1/2 chicken mixture, cheese, 1/3 sauce, torn tortillas to cover, 1/2 chicken mixture, cheese, torn tortillas to cover, remaining sauce, and top with a healthy layer of cheese. 4) I pull of the tin foil at the end and broil until the cheese browns. I haven't tried mixing taco seasoning into the chicken mixture yet, but since we always end up drizzling on hot sauce at the end, I'm going to try it next time and see how it goes.

This is definitely our new favorite recipe.  The ONLY thing I did differently was prepare the chicken by broiling and shredding vs. baking.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as is.  Don't omit charring the tortillas.  This makes a huge difference.  The second time we made it we charred them on the grill.  Will be making this a LOT.  Thank you for sharing!!

I am giving this 5 stars because it is so easy and my husband and grown son loved it!!!!! Here's my take on making the dish  just a bit tastier.  I had chicken tenders that I seasoned with taco seasoning and garlic powder (not salt), then cooked them in the crock pot on high for 2 hours.   I also added a can of green chiles to the recipe just to see how much more flavor I could enhance it with. We all like fairly spicy food and it kicked it up a notch and was so tasty. I did  fry my tortillas before smothering them in the sauce so that they wouldn't get mushy. Not keen on that bit of more work, so next time, I think I will try the tostada tortillas that they sell in the grocery stores. I did not use any thing to grease the pan, but I spread a good amount of enchilada sauce on the bottom (I guess maybe a little under 1/2 inch) and used the whole rest of the can to pour over each layer. After pulling it out from the oven, it looked soupy, so I let is stand for 20 minutes before serving and it was perfect. Such a great dish. Really. Thank you so much.

Wonderful recipe!  People love it at potlucks.  I made it with the chicken.  Only change I made is mixing the sour cream with the chicken as it was hard to spread the sour cream.  Also, did not char the tortillas and it worked out fine.

I also made a vegetarian version with black beans in place of the chicken.  I used 3 cans of black beans and again mixed the sour cream with the beans.  Got rave reviews.

I like all of the ingredients in this and followed the instructions but this was not very tasty.  It lacks something and I can't place it just yet.  I won't be making this again.

I actually loved it. Instead of garlic salt, I sprinkled with garlic powder, onion powder and salt because that's what I had. I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs. The other modification I did was just combine the sour cream, cheese and chicken and then spread it  over the layer. Also didn't char the tortillas because I have an electric glasstop stove. Thank you for the wonderful recipe for this novice cook!

This was great.  I did the chicken in the crock pot to make it easy to shred.  I added onion and a little jalapeño to the chicken as it cooked, also garlic salt.  It smelled delicious!  I used only 2 chicken breast so when it was done, I added about 1/4 of a can of retfried beans to bulk it up.  This gave it a great creamy texture and you wouldn't even be able to tell there were beans mixed in.  I followed the rest of the steps pretty close.  It turned out great and was delicious.  My husband even liked it and he is very picky and not a huge Mexican fan, like me.   It looks nice w sour cream on top, along w green onion, tomato, and lettuce.   I would make it again.

Delicious!!!!!!!!!!  I did not char the tortillas either.  I used 2 large cans of chicken, sprinkled the chicken with chili powder and coriander (along with the garlic powder and salt and pepper), mixed the sour cream with the chicken as others suggested, and added a layer of canned refried beans.  It was so easy with no clean up!  I'll be making this again!

The only change I made was combining the green chilies sauce and the sour cream  before I put the dish together.  I also cooked the  chicken in a covered small skillet rather than baking it in the oven.  I also added some chopped onion and  chilie powder as the chicken was cooking.  It was much faster.  I toasted the corn tortillas in a Pam sprayed skilled in quarters as was suggested.  I didn't add the top layer of cheese until the last 10 min of baking time.  It was truly a great dish  and I make it again.

First time ever reviewing a recipe!!  Wow, we loved it!!  I made the enchilada sauce from allrecipes.com and followed the recipe with the tips from others. I don't think I put enough tortillas down unfortunately because it didn't have quite enough structure, but man, it was delicious!!  Boiled the chicken in chicken broth for 15 mins and shredded it. Mixed it with sour cream with maybe a tbsp of taco seasoning then layered, but with not enough tortillas.  So next time, I will make sure I put down plenty more tortillas and I think it will be even more amazing.  Only thing I added was green onion on top for presentation.

My fiancé and I made this together. He's from the southwest so we changed it by adding  sautéed onions and finely chopped jalepenos with the shredded chicken to give it some kick and a bit more flavor. Turned out amazing!

So good--so easy!  I use a rotisserie chicken and add cilantro.  Charring the tortillas helps to prevent this from being soggy.  My family loves this easy, yummy dish.

The kids LOVED it. A little bland for my taste...but the rest of the family loved it. Might add some more seasoning to it next time or some jalapeños on top of my own.

It seemed as if no one was capable of making this without changes and I was no exception. I used half sour cream and half cream of chicken soup and sprinkled taco seasoning in it. I also sautéed some red onions and garlic and added to the mixture. I mixed in sharp cheddar with the cheese. It was delicious and even better left over.

Like some of the others, I did not char my tortillas and it was not soupy. I had left over chicken breast that I prepared in my slow cooker, so it was even quicker. I mixed the sour cream and chicken together to make it less difficult to spread. Great recipe!

Pour 1 can Cream of Celery soup over chicken prior to baking to retain moisture, scrape off this goo before shredding.  Skip charring of tortilla and okay to use more cheese. Tastes better reheated on day 2.

The flavor was really good. But, I didn't crisp up the tortillas and I used flour tortillas. They ended up soaking up a lot of the enchilada sauce, so next time I will definitely heat them over my gas stove and use white corn tortillas. Other than that, the flavor was good and even my teenage daughter liked it, so thumbs up.

This is a great tasting dish, but did not appeal visually to my husband or me. I couldn't find the yellow corn tortillas and the corn tortillas I did find were rather white (this is NH, after all). That would have added to the color. I will also use red enchilada sauce the next time for more contrast in the dish. Tasted even better the second day. I froze a couple servings and it still tasted very good and had a good consistency when thawed.

This recipe turned out great, but with a few slight modifications.  I boiled the chicken in order to shred it.  Cut the breasts in half and bring salted water to a boil.  Place chicken in and cover on low heat for 20 minutes.

Shred the chicken and add the sour cream to it.  Mix it all together.  This makes it much easier to spread.  I also added one 10oz can, drained, of diced tomatoes and green chilies, and a packet of hot taco seasoning to the chicken mixture.   Spread shredded cheese on top of each layer.

It turned out delicious!

Flavor is good but I think the amount of green sauce is too much. Mine came out soggy. I'd prefer the tortillas to be a little firmer/crispier. Next time I make it I think I will try one 10 ounce can instead of 28 ounces. But it's a keeper. Easy and yummy.

I have never made enchiladas before and I don't know why.  This was really yummy.  I mixed the enchilada sauce, sour cream, shredded cheese and chicken.  I also sautéed sliced red, yellow and green bell peppers, a red onion, mushrooms and 2 cloves of minced garlic and added that to the layers.  I did not do anything to the tortillas except tear them apart to fit in the pan.  Oh, and I boiled the chicken breasts then shredded.  I will make this again and again!

We loved this! I used a store-bought roasted chicken, shredding the breast and thigh meat, and simmered an additional chicken breast, shredded that. All of this went into a fry pan and seasoning was added to give the meat more flavor. This made a difference! I added garlic powder, onion salt, 1tsp of chili powder and 1/2 cup of Knorrs tomato chicken broth that I had prepared using the water that the chicken breast had cooked in. Stir and simmer for a few seconds so the broth soaks into the chicken. This adds a lot of flavor.   I did layer everything as indicated in the recipe. However, if you put the enchilada sauce BEFORE the sour cream the sour cream spreads easily. I used all of th green sauce (Las Palmas brand?) and did not char the tortillas.  On top, I put a little medium-hot red enchilada sauce, adding  cheddar cheese the last few minutes only because my husband likes red. This provided a nice kick.   If you are looking for your tortillas to have a lot of texture, you will not have it with this recipe, but I preferred this dish over the enchiladas that the local restaurant serves.

I have tried numerous enchilada casserole recipes.  This one is by far the most to my liking.  It is only mildly spicey which suits me perfectly.  The odd thing is that my husband, who likes everything extremely spicy, liked it very much as well.  I did used some pulled pork that I needed to use up instead of the chicken and it was delicious.  Next time I will try it with chicken.  This was very easy to make and needed few ingredients.  Definitely a keeper.

Should call for more cheese and at least some red enchilada sauce.  May make an altered version again, but not going with the exact proportions.

This dish was so easy to make. Perfect for a weekday dinner. I did add more seasoning to the chicken (cumin, taco seasoning, red pepper flakes, and mojo). It definitely made the chicken more flavorful.

I totally recommend making this the night before. This was so discusting after we made it we went out for burgers. We did keep it back because a review said it taste much better when it sets over and they are right. This is delicious and we will make it again. I did make changes. I doubled it because of my size family and I added green peppers cut in small  pieces and chopped onion I sautéed in oil ,garlic powder and salt. I added Midwest seasoning,cumin,salt and garlic to be the chicken after it was cooked and shredded. I also mixed the sour cream,  Taco Bell Salsa Verde and veggies with the chicken. I used a mix of half pepper jack and half Monterey Jack.  Anyway this came out amazing. Only gave it a 4 star cuz of all I had to do to get it this way and the fact we had to let it set till dinner.the next day before we could eat it.

Rather than layering everything, I mixed the chicken, cheese, and sour cream together to speed things up.

I have made this dish 3 times now. We LOVE it. To make it less bland, I used pepper jack for 1/2 of the cheese needed. That makes a big difference. I make several ahead as they freeze great.

Delicious!  The family loved it. I prepared it gluten free using Hatch green enchilada sauce (2 15oz cans mild).  I added fresh cilantro and topped with sliced black olives.  Mix the sour cream with the chicken.  I did not char the tortillas. I used a mix of Monterey and Cheddar cheese.  It was very mild, can use hotter enchilada sauce if desired.  Variations, add a layer of black beans and corn.  Top with pico de gallo!

I just boiled 1.5 lbs of chicken breast halves and shredded with two forks. I used 28 oz can of La Victoria green enchilada sauce. I mixed some of the enchilada sauce, Mexican sour cream, taco seasoning packet, crumbled queso fresco, and chopped cilantro to the shredded chicken. I only added minimal enchilada sauce in between layers since the chicken mixture was very moist. I did not char the tortillas. I topped it off with the remaining enchilada sauce and the shredded Mexican cheese. 
Next time I will lightly coat the tortillas in oil and heat before layering, the tortillas I used this time were very thin. It was delicious, I don't mind the thin tortilla because I like it moist versus starchy. Will cook again!

I threw my chicken in the crockpot earlier in the day, then shredded as usual.  Added the sour cream to the shredded chicken. Followed as recipe says except I didn't char the tortillas. I also just ripped them to fit in dish. Then to the top layer I added green salsa because I found I ran out of the enchilada sauce. Then I cut some fresh green onions from my garden and sprinkled on top. So yummy definitely will do again only double the layer of corn tortillas to reduce being mushy and falling apart easy.

Easy to make and good.  Can make it zestier with the addition of jalapeno peppers, red onion.  Good served with avocado.  I'll use cilantro next time too.

Very good recipe considering the base recipe is only six ingredients.  Do not have a gas stove, so I seared each tortilla in a pan on high heat, worked well. Added cumin as well.  Would make again adding black olives and green onions on the top. Keeper.

Quick and Easy.  I followed the recipe.  I did add cumin because I add it to all my Mexican dishes and I used white corn tortillas because I like them better.  I purchased all my ingredients from Wal-Mart.  I served this with Mexican rice and refried beans.  My husband LOVED it!

So good... Definitely not low carb or low cal, so be sure to serve with chips, guac and margaritas for full enjoyment! I used a 40 oz jar of 505 medium green chili. Just the right punch for my  family. Other than that, I didn't change a thing. I will definitely make this again!

Super good! I cut in half & baked in 8 X 8" glass dish. Used 9 corn tortillas. Tip: mix the sour cream, cheese and chicken together with cumin, chili pepper, garlic powder and S & P. Still used whole 8 oz. sour cream. Boiled 2 chicken breasts on low 20 mins. after first bringing to a boil. Can add sliced black olives. Be sure to dip your tortillas on top layer in enchilada sauce. Heats up good in oven next day on 350 deg. 20-25 mins.

Used flour tortillas straight out of package.  It was so easy especially since I had all ingredients on hand.  Delish!  Also used large can of chicken, drained and separated instead of cooking chicken.

This was so easy and delicious. I tossed the sour cream with the chicken and added cilantro. Remember to spray the foil if using foil to cover so it doesn't stick to the cheese on top. My only regret is I halved the recipe to feed fewer people so didn't have enough leftovers!

As usual for me, I used this recipe and tweaked it for my personal tastes and I found it to be an excellent base. I used the roasted "buttery garlic" whole chicken you buy at the deli, and I pulled the two breasts and thigh meat and used that. (I saved the other parts for another recipe). I found this recipe lacks moisture as/is, so when I make it again, I'll add more sauce of some sort -- something buttery, or creamy -- maybe a loose cheese sauce. The green enchilada sauce is assertive, so one can is plenty, and salsa on top (as the video suggested) didn't really add much moisture to the ingredients below.
    I found it to be delicious and so did my husband, though. I added fresh cilantro leaves to the inner layer so every other bite had a burst of freshness-- delicious! I also added a light layer of sliced black olives to the inner layer for a little punch.
     The video didn't suggest toasting the corn tortillas over an open flame as the written receipt did, so I wanted to suggest you do this step. The slight char that came up in a few bites was delightful.
     I served mine with shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes, and a dollop of sour cream. I will make this again!!

I followed the recipe as stated.  The flavor was good.  However, it turned out to be too soupy as others have stated.  The charring of the tortilla's is a bit time consuming as well.

My family loved it! We did not have the sloppy mess issue. I would change the name though. While it was easy, it was NOT quick. 2 hours to make something is not quick! I stuck the tortilla halves directly on the burner over the flames because I didn't want to take 30 minutes charring them. I had two burners going and was able to do 4 halves at a time. Next time, I'll char whole tortillas then cut them in half. I poured the 1/2" of sauce in the pan, and had used half the can. I misread the recipe and dredged the rest of the tortillas in the enchilada sauce for the middle and top layers. I also pushed everything down into the pan once all the ingredients were in. I think this helped soak up all the sauce at the bottom. I liked the idea of mixing the chicken and sour cream together before adding them. I plan to try it next time.

5 stars for minimal ingredients and ease of preparation.  3 stars for taste.  I think it is just my personal preference for flour tortillas.  Of course, then this recipe would not be enchiladas, it would be burritos.

This is very good.  I used leftover chicken supplemented with sautéed onion, pepper, and mushrooms. Mixed with sour cream as other reviewers suggested.  I used red sauce in the bottom and middle and green sauce on top.  Also topped the green sauce with some canned chopped tomato with green chiles.  A keeper.  I tore my tortillas in half and just heated them in a non stick skillet before assembling the casserole.

Very Good Recipe, but I agree with the other comments. You'll want to add onion, garlic, green bell pepper, salt, and a little red chili power for flavor.

Very good! If I haven't seasoned my chicken, the dish would've been bland. I used the 'a good easy garlic chicken' in AR. I did have an issue with it being soupy as others mentioned but we'll see how it is the next day. My husbands only wish is to find straight sided tortillas lol.

My roommate accidentally bought red enchilada sauce, but it was still delicious! When i made it again i think i will add vegetables, like maybe corn, green peppers, and onions.  Also, i added lime juice to mine and it was delish!

This was so good! I didn't have a Ron of time, so I cut the chicken into small chunks and cooked on the stovetop. Then I assembled the casserole as stated, but only used 8 oz of cheese for it instead of 16. I felt that was plenty. I used a medium heat enchilada sauce! Yummy! And I heated up some flour tortillas to soak up the yummy sauce! Delicious!

Quite good and pretty easy to make.  Next time I'll use a little more enchilada sauce as I like mine saucier than average.

This is delicious and very easy to make. I had shredded chicken in the freezer so I used that and did double layers of the corn tortillas. So So So So good! This could use some more seasonings and maybe some onion, I topped mine with raw onion and salsa.

I gave this recipe a 5 for taste.  I have never used green enchilada sauce before and I loved it.  It was quick and easy.  I did not char the tortillas as the recipe states, I followed someones recommendation of dipping in sauce instead.  The tortillas did become mushy however, so next time I will follow the directions and char them.  My husband and son loved it and said it was a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe.

Took the suggestions given previously - mixed taco seasoning, sour cream and chicken together before layering.  Used 505 brand green enchilada sauce and dipped tortillas into sauce instead of pouring sauce over.  EXCELLENT - everyone loved it!

UPDATE: BECAUSE OF ALL THE STELLAR REVIEWS, I DECIDED TO GIVE THIS ANOTHER WHIRL. I AM SOOOO GLAD I DID. THIS WAS FANTASTIC, ESPECIALLY WITH RICK BAYLESS' SALSA VERDE!!! THE SALSA MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE, IMHO. I was behind schedule with my grocery shopping for the weekend and knew that after a stop by the pet store (we bring home a new dog tomorrow!), I wouldn't have enough time to prepare what I had planned to make for dinner. Mexican food sounded good, so I quickly scoured my pantry to see what else I needed to pick up in order to make this. As with any recipe, I made a few alterations. I added a packet of chicken taco seasoning to my sour cream and mixed that with my chicken. To speed prep, I purchased a rotisserie chicken. As Michelle O'Sullivan suggested, I tore my tortillas into 4-6 pieces and dipped them into my salsa verde (not my initial layer - I placed those directly over my salsa layer as directed). I poured a 1/2 in. of salsa into my greased baking dish, followed by half of my chicken mixture, a good layer of cheese, tortillas, a repeat of this layer and the rest of my tortillas and cheese. After baking, I popped my casserole under the broiler to brown (I like bubbly enchiladas). My casserole was not mushy at all which I attribute to dipping my tortillas in reserved salsa as others have done. Served with Mexican rice, chips and guacamole, this was an "OK" meal. It's certainly easy to prepare, but just not what I was looking for. Thanks anyways, SGRCOOKI! :-)

This is really good. After reading the reviews I added taco seasoning to the sour cream and it was perfect. I boiled the chicken in garlic, chicken seasoning, and white pepper so the chicken was very flavorful. According to the reviews this was a good recipe but I was surprised how good it was. This was a sure hit in our home, thanks!

This was a HUGE hit with my guests!  I added 2 cans of Rotel (hot), green chile, diced onions and garlic salt.  I also used montery/cheddar cheese.  FAB and I will use this one again!!!

Very good recipe!  I only made a couple of changes.  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts.  Instead of baking the chicken, I cooked it in a pan - covered on low, with a chopped onion.  I shredded the chicken, returned it to the pan with the sauteed onions and mixed in the sour cream.  I will make this again!

I thought this was very good and easily modified to include favorite ingrediants and what I had on hand.  I used boneless skinless thighs cooked on the stove top seasoned with garlic flakes and jalapenos.  Also, put sour cream into chicken mixure, used cheddar cheese and flour torts.  Very yummy!

Didn't have a way to char the tortillas but still fantastic. These casseroles always remind me of tamales. I love how the corn tortillas turn to mush without being gluey.

This was a very tasty casserole.  Used "medium" green enchilada sauce-just the right flavor.  Also used par-baked flour tortillas (something new at my market) and browned in a hot electric skillet. Used 8 tortillas and cut the ingredients in half. Will make again!

I simmered the chicken breasts in chicken broth for 20 minutes, then let cool before shredding.  As others suggested, I mixed the sour cream cream with the chicken.  I also added 1/2 of a small jar of salsa to the chicken for added flavor.

The title is misleading, not a quick recipe but it is a delicious one! I poached the chicken then shredded it. I charred the tortillas as instructed to avoid the casserole from being to soggy. Then I mixed the chicken, sour cream and cheese (saving some for the top) together. Awesome!

These were  just okay for us.  I followed recipe exactly and maybe if I do decide to make them again, I will not char the tortillas.  Flavor was good, but the tortillas didn't hold up as I expected....maybe too much sauce?

Yum, yum!  I made this on the grill in my iron skillet and I must say they are delicious.  I'll be making them again when I have a real kitchen back in place.  Thanks to Patty Cakes for suggesting and thanks to SGRCOOKI for the recipe!

This was REALLY good!  However, I did make some modifications before making it without them.  I added 2 TBSP of vegetable oil and 2 cloves of crushed garlic before cooking the chicken and adding the garlic salt.  Then I used the same glass dish to cook the enchiladas in.  I added a can of green chiles and one small yellow onion (I added these in thirds anytime it called for the sauce).  Served with Jiffy's cornbread.  mmm!!!  SO FLAVORFUL AND TASTY!!  Thank you : )

This casserole is incredible!  We have 6 children from 16years down to 1year and everyone loves it!  The only thing I change is to mix the sour cream with some of the green sauce which makes it much easier to pour and spread

Awesome recipe! To save cooking time, I mixed 2 large cans of Snow's canned diced chicken breast and mixed it with a couple dollops of sour cream, 1/4 cup of shredded cheese, a splash of the green chile sauce, and about a teaspoon of garlic salt. I didn't have corn tortillas on hand and used flour instead. I rolled them like normal enchiladas with seam-side down, side by side, in a 9x13 casserole dish. I poured the remaining sauce and topped with remaining cheese. Baked for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees. I will continue to make this dish and freeze ahead of time as my hands will be tied with a new baby on the way. In about an hour, you really have a yummy quick and easy green chile chicken enchilada casserole!!

I loved this recipe and so did my husband, sister in law and co-workers! I did change the recipe a bit; I used flour tortillas instead of corn, mixed dark and white chicken meat and didn't add the sour cream to bake but put it on top of the portions as well as cut tomatoes and red onions. Soo yummy!

Wonderful recipe. Didn't char the tortillas as that really is a pain. I followed the advice on mixing the sour cream with the enchilada sauce and it did help. I will be making this again soon :)

I followed the recipe to a 'T,' and it was amazing. I had previously made a similar recipe out of Martha Stewart's Everyday Food that was not nearly as moist and yummy. This was excellent.

Delish! Modified some -- boiled the chicken, then simmered in Rotel, then assembled etc. Topped with chives -- also mixed the green chile sauce and sour cream before adding it in. Very tasty!

This was ok, nothing out of this world. I used a store bought rotisserie chicken and chopped it up to save time. Ok, but probably won't make again.

Made this tonight for dinner. I took the advice of another reviewer and mixed the chicken, a packet of taco seasoning and the sour cream and it gave the casserole a bit of spicy zip.. not to much, just right.  I didn't use all the enchilada sauce.  I used all but about a cup of it. My husband had THREE servings of this! Which he almost never does. This is easy and very tasty, will definetly make this again!  Thanks for the recipe.

I boiled the chicken in water with some fresh garlic, I mixed the sour cream with the chicken and added taco seasoning (1/2 packet) to it to add flavor (and a little diced canned jalapeno).  I will come back and re-review this recipe after I make it the next time cuz I followed some of the other reviews and mixed and matched them and although it tasted really good, it had a very weird consistency.  Some of the tortillas were soupy, some were hard!

Loved this and so did the fam.  I used flour tortillas because I already had them, and I did not char them.  I dumped one small can of sauce on the bottom and poured the other over the top.  Very easy.

hmmmm, I know I made some mistakes, for example, I wouldn't cook the chicken that way again. Also I had some difficulty with soggy tortillas, I did not char them. I think it needs more specific directions, for example, what size pan. I'm not sure why it called for 18 tortillas, didn't come close. Anyway, this is a good starting point, but overall I found the dish very bland, perhaps the sour cream mellows it to the point where you need to over spice it, I'm not sure. One thing I know for sure, I didn't miss rolling up enchiladas.

I boiled the chicken breast with onions, red peppers and carrots. Shredded the chicken and cut up the carrots. Mixed the chicken, sour cream, carrots and added half a packet of taco seasoning and 1/3 cup cheese I used the Mexican blend. Spread this out over tortillas and added cheese on top and poured some sauce on each layer.  I used salsa verde instead of enchilada sauce.  This turned out awesome not soupy at all!  A little spicy for the kids but just right for me and my husband. This one is a keeper!

My husband loved this (which is rare)! I cooked the chicken in some green chiles to add a little extra flavor. It was a hit...and it was yummy to eat the following day for lunch. :)

I thought this was kinda boring, didnt like the flavor and neither did family of the corn tortillas, we thought it would have tasted better with flour tortilas. And it was kinda dry.

This was really yummy!I changed it a bit.
I was short on time so I used 2 cans of white chicken in water (drained). I switched out sourcream for lowfat creamcheese 8oz.  I mixed together on stovetop chicken, greenchile sauce, creamcheese. 3 Layers of tortillas, chicken mix and then colby jack cheese in long pyrex dish. Top with sliced avocado on each serving.

This was delicious. I also tore tortillas into pieces and dipped them into the sauce, although starting with a 1/2" layer of sauce I thought was too much, I just barely covered the bottom.  Mixing sour cream with chicken was a convenient way to spread those ingredients.

We loved this recipe. I got rave reviews at a party and my husband requested it again too. I made it once with chicken and then with hamburger. Great both times. I did not char the tortillas, added sliced olives for color and added more spice with chili powder. I served it with jalapenos and diced tomatoes. I will definately make this one again.

This was really good and easy.  I didn't find it to be too liquidy at all, even though I didn't toast the tortillas.

This is a great casserole. Small changes I made were: did not bother to char the tortillas, used 4 blend Mexican cheese and used regular sour cream. This recipe makes tons, have friends over.

This dish came out great and it was quick and easy.  The whole family loved it.  My wife was happy that I could get this ready and set the timmer on the oven so that it was done when they got home that evening.  I think the family will want me to make this again.

This was pretty good. I was in a pinch and had everthing on hand. It worked out great for us. If you are expecting "fancy", it isn't. But, for a quick casual mexican inspired main dish, it works.

Definitely quick and easy but lacked depth.  If I make again, I will add corn, bell peppers and olives.

It was a hit with the kids!  I served it to two 5 year olds and a 2 year old and they loved it!  It is basically a colorless dish so they weren't real excited, but once they tasted it they ate all of it.  I was short on time so I boiled the chicken and seasoned the water with the garlic salt.  The best part is that I can freeze some of the leftovers for dinner another night.

Slightly dry, I forgot to cover it before baking. Also needs something more. Next time I will try using sharp cheddar and maybe a different brand of sauce.

I made this last night and everyone raved. They asked for it again tonight! I make part of the pan without chicken for me and it works great. I serve it with black beans.

I changed this recipe up a little, added hamburger instead of chicken.  This is an excellant recipe for chicken or hamburger!!  I am glad I found this.  Shredding the tortillas worked really well.

Great, and for a vegetarian substitution, try refried black beans.  Instead of charring tortilla as described, I just toast in toaster oven.  A quick to prepare, delicious dinner.
