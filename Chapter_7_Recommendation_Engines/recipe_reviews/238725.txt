Delicious, healthy and easy. No green pepper so I used a small zucchini. Also threw in a cup of frozen corn because I mean this is Chili!  Didn't have the Mexican ground round so I used the Italian one and added 1/2 TSP of cayenne pepper and same of Louisianna hot sauce, and I used Hunts think and rich spicy red chili Tomato sauce. It was looking pretty liquidy before the vegetable broth was added so I just used a TSP of soup mix without the liquid. Right balance of spicy for me and the kids to both enjoy.  Will definitely make again and again.

Delicious! I didn't use celery and added a bit of broth to the beginning but it is delicious! Added some tortilla chips instead of crackers and dipped it in!
