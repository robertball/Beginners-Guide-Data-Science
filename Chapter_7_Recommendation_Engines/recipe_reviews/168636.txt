This is one of my most favorite cocktails. When I make this, I use a jigger and a half of peach schnapps instead of a tablespoon. Really good!

Fabulous cocktail! Very refreshing and a great way to end the day. I upped the peach schnapps a little and added a splash maraschino cherry juice.  Added a slice of orange and a cherry and it went down very easy...

This is a very refreshing drink. I realized my brandy was wild cherry just before I poured, but it was a delicious combination. I went with the maraschino cherry garnish and I added a few extra ice cubes. I will definitely make this again, and I plan to try the blender version in the future as well.

I didn't have diet ginger ale so I used regular ginger ale instead.  Very simple and easy to make.  I enjoyed the drink while making dinner for the family.  Just what I was looking for today!

This was good. Not my all-time favorite drink, but it is a great recipe for something that is both tasty and super easy to make. It is also great because of the smaller amount ingredients, and I had it all on hand! Thanks!
