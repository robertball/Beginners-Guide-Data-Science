THIS WAS VERY EASY, I JUST USED ONE BOWL,AND INSTEAD OF APPLE PIE SPICE I USED A MIXTURE OF CINNAMON,CLOVES AND NUTMEG.  GREAT CAKE ON SHORT NOTICE.

This was okay.  I was generous and gave it a 3-star because it was propbably my own fault.  I didn't have apple pie spice, so I used 1tsp nutmeg, 1tsp ground cloves and, after tasting the batter, added another 1/2tsp of cinnamon.  I only chopped the apple pie filling instead of mashing, added about a 1/4 cup more to batter.  The cake spices were strong (too much clove) and not enough apples.

Pretty tasty. Light texture. I added about 1/2c more apples and it’s still not very “appley”.  I opted to just use cinnamon in it. Easy one bowl cake.
