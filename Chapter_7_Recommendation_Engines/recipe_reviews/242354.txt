Awesomely delicious!  Perfect as a low carb snack for my diabetic husband to take in his lunch box.  Dip the squares into salsa for an extra wonderful taste experience..Did use 3 eggs since my cauliflower

I mixed everything together and used three eggs. The flavor was delicious. I baked it for 20 minutes in my stoneware bar pan.

These turned out to be pretty good, maybe even better than actual cheese sticks.  I didn't have fresh cauliflower so instead I used to bags of frozen cauliflower.  I did add the extra eggs , 4 since 3 didn't quite seem enough.  I used a mixture of Pizza Blend cheese and Queso cheese blend and opted out the nutmeg as I am not a huge fan.  I spread the mixture out on a large cookie tray with sides sprayed with cooking spray and baked at 425 for 25 mins.  really am impressed with how good these turned out and will definitely be making them again.

3 eggs, no bell pepper or nutmeg. Cheese in and on top. Parchment paper. Marinara to dip in. Yummo.

I thought it would be a little more crunchy but it was rather soft throughout.   I also didn't think it had much taste to it.   I would also use riced cauliflower rather than putting it in the blender/food processor.  And, YES, it needs 3 eggs.   If I make this again I would be quite creative in the herbs and spices I add.  Potentially this COULD be quite good.

I used two eggs for a binder and after cooling these are still soft and crumbly so handle with care. This recipe will cover an entire half sheet baking pan. It needed longer than the original 12 minute baking time. This is a 4 star recipe warm but when it cools down it's only 3 stars.

I got this idea from 'Dr. Oz'. I use a big grater for chopping it small. It can be a pizza crust. We love this, I change it with cheeses.

I'm sorry, but this was awful. None of us could eat it and it got thrown away.

I thought this was very good. I used three eggs and a cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. I also baked it for 25 min and would recommend using a pan that may allow for air flow under the crust so it gets crispy.

These are good but I put them back in the oven to see if they would get a little more “sturdy” because they fell apart when I took them out of the pan. That didn’t help so we ate them anyway. Good flavor, just very “doughy” with no crunch.

This was good though I added an extra egg, white cheddar instead of pepper jack and brush the top with garlic butter.
a nice snack for pizza night and movies.
