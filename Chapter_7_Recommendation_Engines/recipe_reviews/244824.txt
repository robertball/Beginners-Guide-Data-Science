Chickpeas really are magical! Made this recipe as written in my food processor and it was perfect and no one had any idea they were eating chickpeas! It is great with honey crisp apples too:)

Omitted the milk and used the Enjoy Life! brand chocolate chips to make it dairy free.  Also left out the baking soda, and used well-rinsed great northern white beans in place of the chickpeas.   Really good, and made a perfect allergen-free dessert for a get-together.   Served with apple slices, graham crackers and pretzels, yum!

I used almond milk, skipped the baking soda and added a little more salt. I also added more chocolate chips. Really good!

It was okay, not exactly what I was expecting. The texture was a bit off for me, and the peanut butter in mine was overpowering. Although, after I made it my sister suggested adding some more cocoa powder and it improved the taste for me. Overall, it was pretty good and a huge hit among my family, while being healthy!

Glad another user said they substituted great northern white beans b/c that's what I had in my cupboard and no chickpeas. I don't have a food processor so I used a blender which is always more painstaking with these types of recipes. But, Wow! It tastes amazing! Pretty close to cookie dough! Yum!

Meh.  Perhaps I'd appreciate it more if I HAD  to go gluten-free.  The taste and texture reminded of me of Asian bean paste pastries.  I'm not a fan of sweetened beans.

Nice flavor without being overly sweet--I even eliminated the chocolate chips!
