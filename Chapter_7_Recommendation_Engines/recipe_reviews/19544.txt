I added 2 eggs and a can of chicken broth. I'm thinking that a couple of liquid ingredients
were missing from this recipe. 
But the end result was very tasty.

This was a really good recipe, but I had to change somethings around. Thank god I got a can of chicken stock at the store just incase, because it would've been to dry without it. Also, I used jimmy dean sausage instead and crumbled it into the mix. I would definitely make this again!

Good recipe--very nice flavor.  I left out the garlic and celery (don't care for celery), and used pepperidge farm corn bread stuffing mix (12 ozs)--also added a can of chicken broth.  Next time I will leave out the apple, as I didn't think it really added very much to the stuffing.  But the sausage (used country sausage), mushrooms and onion gave it an outstanding flavor.  Will be making this again--next time I will add a little more moisture.

Great recipe.  I thought it was too dry, so instead of adding chicken stock, I added a cup or so of organic apple juice, which was fantastic.  I also used chicken sausage instead of pork sausage (less grease).  Will definitely use this one again.

I wish there were 20 stars for this! We love this as a stuffing in between 2 pork chops.  There is plenty for 6-8 chops (2 per stack)with a bit leftover in the pan. The flavor combo is great...I always replace the pork sausage w/the light breakfast sausage links to cut down on the fat content and the taste is great. Thanks for an awesome recipe :o)

Very good, but I am glad that I read the suggestion to add liquid (I used a can of chicken broth). I omitted the mushrooms and added extra sausage and apples. I chopped the apples very coarsely so that taste would come through better.  Makes lots.  My family is not into non-traditional formats of familiar foods and even they liked it.

So I've prepared a very similar version my whole life, never dry! The difference is I chop the onion, celery and apple then boil gently till tender, adding water as needed. It does take about 90 minutes. Add the veggies, liquid and all, to the bread crumb mixture. Also, I use bulk sausage, usually Jimmy Dean hot, crumbled and fried till cooked through, and I don't drain the sausage. Ever. My mouth is watering as I type. I can almost guarantee you'll make this stuffing again and again.

This came out pretty dry. I had to add a lot of chicken stock and put it back in the oven.

Plus it is way too much, cut it in half and add 2 to 3 cups of stock.

This stuffing was very good, however, I made these following changes: I used Jimmy Dean ground sausage (regular flavor) instead of the links, and I added two cans of the chicken broth (italian seasoning flavor) and one egg. Next time I will also omit the apple, since I didn't think it helped the dish at all. Otherwise very good. Will make again!

A good stuffing that smells great while cooking and tastes great with the meal.  Followed the recipe and didn't have to make any changes, was perfectly moist, before and after cooking.  Stuffed a turkey and cooked the remainder on the side.  Everyone enjoyed and tastes good with leftovers too.

An absolute favorite with the entire family!  The only change made to the recipe was the addition of chicken broth which gave the desired moistness.  This dish will be a regular part of our family dinners.

Stuffing was a HUGE hit for Thanksgiving.  The recipe was enough to stuff a large bird (19 lbs) with leftovers to bake in a pan.  I also followed the suggestions of previous reviews in adding additional moisture--one egg and broth.  Next time I make it the egg might be left out.

i gave it 3 stars because it had the apples. i like fruit in my stuffing.  i usually also have cranberries and some other dried fruit and almonds or pecans or cashews. i used italian sausage, crumbled, not sliced links.  i did like the cornbread part, too.  but i ONLY gave it 3 stars because it was so dry. it should have had some kind of liquid in it to make it moist.  i was wondering, why would i bake this when it's already dry?  i think i would try this recipe again except with some broth...to find out if i REALLY liked it or not.

Although, it did have a lot of texture to it and an interesting taste, I did have to add more chicken stock as it would have been too dry.  I think I would enjoy it more with stuffed pork chops than with turkey.

Great recipe!  I took the advice of others and used a can of chicken broth, and I also threw in a handful of sun dried tomatoes to the mushroom mixture towards the end to add some more flavor.  Will make again!

Good, not great. I did use some apple juice, as mentioned by others, to add some liquid..which helped. I'll try it again, but with different cornbread mix. I used Jiffy and it crumbled too much.

This recipe should be re-posted with at least one can of chicken broth included. It was so dry it was embarrassing. I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before preparing. I'll never do that again. I doctored it up and it was better but the damage was done: the husband wouldn't touch it again. Good thing I made a batch of his mother's recipe of dressing as well!

This is pretty good stuffing once you add chicken broth. I reduced this recipe by half and had plenty for a 9x13 pan. I couldn't imagine making the full recipe unless you needed to feed a crowd. I did omit the mushroom out of personal preference, while I will eat them my monsters will not. I replaced with extra apple. I also added 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth. It would be a crumbly mess without the chicken broth.

My wife prefers a traditional dressing for turkey at Thanksgiving; I really love corn bread dressing, so this year she made her dressing and I made mine. I loved this because it has a both savory and sweet in it. I made it on the stove top and then baked it in a casserole dish to give it a crunchy top. I loved it as did everyone who tried it. It is richer because of the sausage and butter. I could also see that this as a breakfast dish served with eggs.
