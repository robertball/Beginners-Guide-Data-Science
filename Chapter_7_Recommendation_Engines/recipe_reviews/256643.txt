This is the best Barbecue pizza I ever had!!! All the family liked it. I added a little bit less sauce as suggested by other reviews. I had a half of a red pepper in the fridge so I used it as well as a little more onion. Delicious!!!

This was a perfect weeknight meal!  It used very few ingredients, but, the flavor really packed a punch!  I loved the addition of the red onion.  The Panasonic conduction oven did a wonderful job getting a perfectly crisp crust while keeping a soft chewy interior.  Next time I think I will add a little fresh cilantro after taking it out of the oven.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great quick dinner to appease the masses.  The timing was right on for cooking.  Next time we will cut back on the barbecue sauce a tad since we found it a little overpowering.  I added a touch of cilantro to the top because it's one of those things I just have to have on barbecue pizza.

Made this pizza with dough from the local bakery (Great Harvest) and a pound of chicken.  Hubby and I liked it and I'm looking forward to making more pizza's at home!

This was so quick and easy, just like it says! Seriously, if you like BBQ chicken pizza - this one is for you. I made this for lunch on a Saturday, and everyone gobbled it right up! I made half a recipe (as I was using the other half of the pizza dough for another pizza recipe), so I used the 9" pizza setting on my Panasonica CIO, rather than the 12" setting. The only thing I would do differently next time is cut back on the BBQ sauce just a tad. Thanks for sharing this quick and easy recipe!
