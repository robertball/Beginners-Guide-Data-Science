This was great!  I used fat free mayo and extra virgin olive oil in place of the butter and it was delicious and healthy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  However, I would recommend using only 1 tsp. of the Dijon mustard-  not 1 tbsp.  The flavor of the Dijon mustard can be overpowering, potentially masking the flavor of the halibut.  Also, make sure you cook it at a higher temperature.  Otherwise, the breadcrumb-crusted fish will be a bit soggy at the bottom.  However, if you use high heat, this will quickly evaporate all of the water that naturally comes out of the fish when baked.  Other than that, this recipe has a GREAT flavor.  The Parmesan adds a great flavor.

I served it as a fish sandwich with aioli on the side.  Delicious!!!

Given comments that the fish needed more cooking time, wasn't crunchy or didn't get brown, I made a couple of small changes to correct. I raised the oven temperature to 400 degrees, put the pan on the upper third of the oven, and baked the filets about 20 minutes. Also, I drizzled the fish with about 2 T. of  extra melted butter, letting some of it flow onto the pan. These small changes made the coating crisp and golden brown and the fish perfectly cooked. While this is not my favorite way to prepare halibut, it was an interesting change.  I won't be making this again, however, as hubby didn't like it at all (in fact, his ended up in the garbage can). He thought the topping too heavy and overpowering for this delicately flavored fish, preferring it more simply prepared. I have to agree.

This is a killer recipe!! I  Used halibut from Alaska which had been frozen and vacuumed sealed.  I didn't have horseradish so instead used Trader Joes sweet hot mustard and didn't use the required Dijon mustard.  I used 2 tablespoons.  In place of the bread crumbs I used Panko Japenese Bread Crumbs.  I also used Panko for mixing the topping.  After cooking for 15 minutes at 350, I popped it under the broiler for about two minutes to get the top golden brown.
This turned out great. Hubby was in heaven.  Makes him want to go fishing for more halibut!

As I was sharing this dinner with someone who is lactose intolerant, I could not use parmesan cheese in the recipe; instead, we added ground macadamia nuts - it turned out great. Even my seven-year-old (who hates both mustard and horseradish.. ) thought this fish was yummy. In response to the reviewer who thought that the ingredients overpowered the fish: use thick halibut steaks instead of fillets, and you will have plenty of fish flavour (and texture) to enjoy.

I used tilapia for this recipe and it was amazing! After just 15 minutes in the oven, the fish was so moist and tasty. I served garlic herb potatoes and carrots with a brown sugar sauce on the side. Try this recipe if you're looking for something quick and easy to serve to guests or your family!

Pretty good.  I am however going to be the rebel reviewer and say that the breadcrumbs overwhelmed the taste of the dijon-horseradish (which is the reason that I wanted to try this, we love horseradish & were looking for a kick).  We didn't hate it, but it didn't knock our socks off either.  If I make it again, Ill fix the bread crumb issue.  Thanks Christine ;)

Made just as is and actually only cooked 2 fillets but the same amount of sauce and topping as my husband likes sauces--this is divine!

Sorry, my husband and I found the mixture far too tangy.  We actually scraped the mixture off the top.  I will make it again, but I will modify it by cutting the mustard and horseradish in half, and add fresh garlic to it.

I used 1/2 Tbls of mustard after reading others' reviews that it was too tangy.  I also used shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated and panko bread crumbs.  Instead of mixing the butter, bread crumbs, and cheese, I drizzled the butter, sprinkled the cheese, and then topped with bread crumbs before tossing in the oven at 425.  After 14 minutes, I switched the oven to broil for about a minute and browned the top.  It was perfect!!!

Very good recipe.  Tried it with some Alaskan halibut that was caught and vacuum packed, very thickly cut.  Substituted panko for breadcrumbs, olive oil for the margarine and upped the horseradish and dijon mustard amounts (thicker cuts of halibut tend to need a little more flavor and I do like spicy food.)  Worked out really well at 350 degrees for 20 minutes, very tasty and easy to do.  Will definitely repeat the recipe!

We found this recipe to be excellent.
Flavors are mild and elegant and I am sharing the recipe with friends who recently brought home a supply of Halibut from an expedition.  Be sure to add color to your plate, for eye appeal--this is a delicate and white dish. Definitely will make again

Pretty good!  I used the topping on talapia since I didn't have halibut.  This topping would compliment most types of fish.  I went easy with the final step of melted butter and breadcrumbs based on other reviewers who said the breadcrumbs overpowered the dish.   ** New review as of 10/21/07:  I made this with the halibut and it was delish!  I used low-fat mayo and Japanese Panko breadcrumbs this time and the Panko was so much lighter than regular breadcrumbs.  I didn't use the melted butter on the final topping either - - it was so light.  Ran under the broiled just to brown everything up.  I'm glad I tried it again with these lighter ingredients.

Fantastic!  Used tilapia instead of halibut because it's what I had handy, and panko crumbs for the topping on top of the coating for a little extra crunch.  I did put the pan under the broiler for the topping to brown.  Yummy, yummy fish!  I served it with creamy au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach.

This was yummy.  Used light mayo and omitted the horseradish.  I prepped the sauce a little early and it became super thick from the bread crumbs absorbing everything, so mix it just before putting it on the fish.  Baked it at 400 as others suggested and broiled for a few minutes at the end to really brown the topping.  Turned out great.

AMAZING. Used flounder instead of halibut.  Used Fat Free Mayo and couldn't tell why you would ever use full fat.  So healthy and so impressed by this dish...and I'm picky.

My husband and I LOVE this halibut recipe. To cut calories/fat, we substitute low-fat mayo and fat-free spray butter, and it still comes out tasty.

This was pretty good!  We used pan fish filets, which were slightly smaller and so I should've adjusted the cooking time to account for the smaller filets, as they ended up being slightly over done.  However, I took some of the other reviewers' advice and broiled the fish for a few minutes after the cooking time in order to brown the crust and get a bit of a crunch on the crust.  Also, substitued a bit of chopped garlic for the horseradish and the flavor was great!

We loved this.  I went light on the horseradish as it's not one of my fav. flavors but I like a hint of it and it does go well in this mix.  Went a bit heavy on the lemon juice and I have become a devoted panko fan for bread crumbs.  Just about all I use now and they are great on this - light and crunchy.  Thanks for sharing Christy.  Will use this often.

Delicious!  My halibut fillets were on the small side so I shouldn't have used all of the topping.  So make sure you don't spread the topping on too thick if you like to taste mostly the halibut otherwise you will be scraping some off.  I served mine with Caesar salad, roasted zucchini and twice baked potatoes.  Very, very good and I will be making this one again!  Edit:  I have seen wasabi horseradish at the store and I think that would be a good sub for regular prepared horseradish!  Maybe next time.

Very good except I didn't use mayo (never use it..) and used instead an extra-soft low-fat cream cheese. Turned up great minus extra calories.

This was an easy recipe.  The flavor was very nice.  The mustard flavor with the horseradish is a great combination for mustard lovers.  I used hot dijon mustard, hot horsradish for a kick and seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain. We like a robust flavor which it all gave. I served it on the side with alfredo and noodles to compliment the parm cheese, and steamed lemon zest asparagus.  We made a separate batch of sauce for the asparagus because it was so good, and it went very well with the asparagus.  We will make this again with halibut and differnt white fish.  Great easy recipe, a definate do-over.

Incredible.  We all loved it....kids, mother-in-law, husband.  We have made it once with Halibut and once with Cod.  Both were great and I think I even preferred the cod.  Using low-fat mayo and a little less parmesan doesn't change it much at all.  I sprinkled a bit of paprika on top and broiled it for a minute or two at the end to crisp it up a bit and make it look pretty.

This was very good.  I had a hard time getting the paste to stick to the fish.  If I had children I can't say they would eat this.  It was pretty tangy.

I made this dish and served it to several guests on the first try. It was very well received.  i reduced the horseradish down to 1/2 tsp, and everyone agreed that much more would have been overkill.  It allowed just enough spice, while allowing the other flavors through.

I changed this recipe around a little with the help of other reviews.  Primarily, I used panko instead of breadcrumbs and it came out with a really nice crust.  Since I like halibut fillets to be about an inch thick, I increased the oven temp to 400 and cooked it about 20-22 mins which it allowed it to cook through and for the panko to brown.  I used butter instead of margerine.  One of the things to note is the topping ingredients should be doubled if you are using larger fillets -- mine were about 6+ ounces each.  Otherwise, amounts are perfect if you like dijon and horseradish -  just the right amount spiciness for the mild, tender halibut fillets.  EXCELLENT!  I have cooked it about 4 times now and everyone raves!

We really liked this recipe and will definetly use it again. Halibut is a delightfully light fish which could be easily overpowered. Since all Dijon Mustards are not created equal I would highly recommend tasting the one you are using and adjusting the recipe so that it doesn't take over all of the flavour. Lunch leftovers were just as delightful as the original meal.

LOW CALORIE OPTION WITH THE SAME TASTE.... I SUBSTITUTED THE MAYO AND THE HORSERADISH WITH A WASABI FINISHING SAUCE AND REDUCED THE AMOUNT.  I OMITTED THE BUTTER AND USED THE REMAINING LEMON TO SQUEEZE OVER THE TOP.  I ALSO ADDED A SMALL AMOUNT OF CHOPPED PINE NUTS AND FRESH CHOPPED GARLIC TO THE  SPREAD.   I SERVED WITH ASPARAGUS GRILLED IN THE OVEN FOR 15 MIN NEXT TO THE HALIBUT...JUST LIGHTED COATED WITH OLIVE OIL SPARY, SEA SALT, AND FRESH BLACK PEPER.  ALSO SERVED WITH A WHOLE WHEAT LINGUINI PESTO.  GREAT COMBO THAT I'M SURE DR. OZ WOULD APPROVE :)

This dish was delish!  My 13 month old and I LOVED it!  My changes: I omitted the horseradish (because I didn't have any) and the butter.  I accidentally added all the grated parm cheese to the creamy mixture (and ran out!) so the crispy topping was only bread crumbs - panko bread crumbs which I used in the creamy mixture too!  I omitted the butter.  I spread the creamy mixture over the fish.  Then I pressed the dry panko over the spread and sprayed generously with olive oil PAM.  I baked at 350 for 25 minutes (I used Halibut steaks, not fillets that's why the longer cooking time), then I crisped in the broiler for a couple of minutes.  You must crispy in the broiler.  Just baking cooks the fish but does not allow your crumbs to brown or get crispy.  Your dish will look albino and undercooked if you do not broil. Oh! so delicious, though!  EXCELLENT!

Excelllent and easy!  My favorite way of cooking!  I didn't even add salt as I thought there was enough in the parmesan. There is a little time in preparation and remember, just put the toppping on the top of the fist..

Very very good.  My husband said it was "restaurant quality"!!!  My fish was a bit thick so it took 30+ minutes of cooking, part of that at 400 degrees.  I didn't have enough (soy) mayonaise so I added plain yogurt and it was fine.  It crusted nicely, looked good and tasted delicious.

OMG I love halibut to begin with but this recipe is just heavenly!!! Even my fiance' who isn't a fish person LOVED it!!! I agree with some of the other reviews that suggest more of the sauce, it has such a great flavor I just wanted more of it. Also I used panko breadcrumbs which helped make it a little more crispy as well as topped it with a little of the cheese which I broiled for the last minute or so which gave it a great colour and little added crunch :o) We will be keeping this and adding it to our favorites.

i used sole for this recipe & didn't mix the crumbs & parmesan into the mixture.  instead i dipped both sides into the liquid mixture then dry mixture & baked for 13 minutes  @ 350.  Topping turned out crisp & flavourful.  my kids enjoyed it very much!

When the fish was ready at 15 minutes the topping was just a breadcrumb mush.  It wasn't crunchy at all, so I had to broil it, and I think this dried out the halibut.  I liked the flavour of the topping though.  For us, it would have been better without the mixed in breadcrumbs.

Delicious! I really enjoyed it, but my husband was fanatical about it and is still talking about it! I don't know why others say the horseradish taste is too strong, I didn't think so at all. Thank you for sharing, I will definitely make again.

I have been cooking this dish for over a year now and it is fabulous!  Both me and my hsband love it and he requests it all the time :)  I have used every type of fish and they all taste great. 

My kids (they are 5 yrs and 20 months) wont eat it so I just dont put the topping on there fish- simple :)  I just bake there with butter and lemon juice at the same time I bake mine. 

If you like tangy and want to try something different with fish this is IT!!

This is a fabulous fresh fish recipe.  Granted, we splurged for fresh Halibut, but, oh my!  Worth every cent!   I disagree with the reviewers who suggest doubling the sauce -- I made it as-written (as I always recommend the first time), and we found it to be perfect!   Flavorful, just enough to compliment (not overpower) our beautiful fresh fish.  This is going in my "Serve to Company" file!

Perfect!  Ridiculously easy, quick and delicious.  I use panko breadcrumbs for extra crunch, and finish up under the broiler for a minute or so for a nice brown topping.  The family loves this!

This was great!  Used Tilapia instead as it looked good in the store and only a tiny bit of Parmesan in the first mixture.  Also used Panko instead of bread crumbs (lighter)  We are big on light so next time I will very lightly spread the mixture on the fish.  My oven required 18 minutes to brown the top using Tilapia.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe that I have made many times!  I actually double everything for 4 - 6 piece of Halibut, as we like it thick and tangy!!  Sometime I lay the Halibut on a bed of onions with butter before baking.

A+++ recipe!!

6 adults and 1 child rated this fish, all said it was good, can't beat that! I did leave out the lemon juice, just because I did not have it, I did not add the bread crumbs to the mayo mixture just sprinkled on top before baking, took another advice and baked at higher heat 400* and top rack so it would brown better

One of the best fish preparations ever.  I found the lemon unnecessary and excluded all together.  Added approximately 2 tbsp chopped capers for a bit of a briny bite.  Thanks for sharing this!

Didn't use horseradish, and I used panko for the breadcrumbs. DELISH! I am only giving it a 4 stars because it didn't brown up enough on top. The flavor was really good. I will make again, and again and perfect the crust. I served with haricot verts and it was reminiscent of a French cafe. Yum!

I did not find that the topping mixture needed butter, so I excluded it to reduce calories. I also used fat free mayo and baked it at 400 degrees for 17 minutes then broiled it on low to brown the crispy topping. My husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed it!

I loved the mustard spread although I found the breadcrumb topping to be a tad soggy. I raised it in the oven to try and crisp it up but it remained quite soft.

This is my first time using this recipes and it was delicious. I used a thicker piece of halibut - 1 to 2 inches thick and it took me about 30-40 minutes for it to cook through. I also had to turn it up to 400 degrees during the last 10 minutes simply because I was scared that it wasn't going to cook. I also used Panko bread crumbs and it came out so beautifully! Overall, I didn't find the mustard, mayo, or horseradish overpowering. It was really good and I look forward to making this again.

This was okay but we didn't care much for it. I think it was the mayo taste that I didn't like. I used cod and it turned out fine. The Hungry Teen didn't finish his either, and he LOVES fish of any kind. Thanks, it was fun trying out a new recipe.

This recipe was amazing!!  I used red snapper instead of halibut, which turned out very nice. Put the oven to 400 degrees instead of 350 and cooked the fish for about 10 minutes at the suggestion of my guest. I also took someones advice to use more dressing, and let the fish sit for about 40 minutes in the fridge before cooking. I made it for two Alaskan fishermen, and they loved it!!

Way too bland - Halibut needs more flavoring - I used fresh horseradish but hardly any flavor. Will not make again unless I can figure out a way to kick it up.

I made this for dinner tonight and we really enjoyed it!  I did put my own spin on it - I used light Miracle Whip in place of the mayo, I used less mustard (about 1 tsp) and less horseradish (a generous tsp).  Lastly, I used panko instead of breadcrumbs.  We loved it, it was very tasty - but next time I will reduce the butter - 2 Tbsp is a bit much in my opinion.

awesome!  Made it for the wife and served with roasted zuchinni and onions. Lots of mmmms and we will be serving for company.  Doubled the recipe for more fish and worked fine.  Took previous hint and cooked at 400 for first five min to brown the crumbs then backed off to 350 for the other 12 min or so.

I loved this.  My grocery store didn't have any halibut so I used salmon instead.  Still turned out great.  I will make again.  Hopefully next time I will be able to get halibut!

This was very easy to prepare.  Halibut wasn't in season, so I used grouper instead.  I wasn't crazy about this - I think it was the strong taste of dijon and horseradish on such a mild fish. I did give it a higher rating though because my husband, who is not a fan of fish, really liked it so I would definitely make it again.  Next time I will try to stick with the original recipe and use halibut.

________________________________________

And it IS amazing! I needed a quick recipe for halibut, and I'm really glad I chose this one--I usually am a really slow cook, but it was actually done in half an hour. The fish tastes really good too; I am definitely adding this recipe to my collection.

Not as crunchy as I expected it to be, but great flavor.  Maybe next time I'll put it under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp it up.  Thanks!

After reading the other reviews, I used regular Italian bread crumbs for the mayonnaise coating, and panko crumbs for the final coating.  Delicious!!  However, I had to bake it for an extra 8 minutes, and put it under the broiler for 3 minutes to get it brown.

Gave the fish good flavor, but I thought it came out a little too salty. could be the mayo-mustard mixture. Next time I won't drench the fish in the mixture before breading it.

***12-27-2006 Really Good!!! I had to make a few last minute substitutions. Hubby and I both think this turned out wonderful!!!  Instead of Dijon, I used stone ground mustard, I can see where the Dijon would have a sharper flavor .. but it worked, I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs like I usually have so used regular and a little bit of Italian seasoning mix. I ran out of bread crumbs for step 3 so substituted chopped almonds .. we both thought this was a nice touch.. definetly a keeper

This was great! I used catfish, can't get halibut around here too often. Even the non-fish eater ate this, and didn't even complain(which is unusual). I am adding this to my seafood menu rotation. Thanks.

This recipe made an excellent Halibut dish...great flavor and a little excitement without detracting from the smooth flavor and texture of the fish.  I prepared the recipe as stated, went a little light on the Step 2 sauce, and wished that I had prepared just a little more of the Step 3 mixture.

This was fantastic!  We added a touch less horseradish and dijon, since we thought it might be a bit overpowering with the amount called for in the recipe.  It was so flavorful-- we will definitely be making this recipe again!  In the future I would like to try adding fresh garlic, or possibly other flavors of breadcrumbs (seasoned, herb & garlic, etc.) for some variety on the theme.

Tasted like spicy mustard on fish.  Crust not worthy of the price of the fish.  Pass on this one.

This was so good. Unfortunately when I wanted to make it halibut was out of season. I used thick cod steaks so the topping wasn't over powering. My boyfriend absolutely loved it. He's requested it for dinner several times. It was a very unique flavor that I enjoyed as well. The directions made it sound like it was going to be difficult to make but it was actually very easy. Now that halibut is in season we'll be making it alot more often.

This recipe was only mediochre. I wouldn't make it again. The fish was lost in the tastes of the coating.  It might be better with a stronger tasting fish, but we weren't really happy with it with a mild fish.

We really enjoyed this recipe!  I used Basa fillets instead of Halibut - if you've not used Basa yet, try it!!  Excellent texture, tenderness.  Enjoy!

This is such a good recipe, especially if you are new to seafood.  My picky eater loved the flavors.  I also used spicy country style mustard.  The second time I made this, I omitted the 2nd bread crumbs/butter mix.. the dish came out Tres Magnifique rich with flavor! Thanks Christine.

I loved this recipe. My husband & I aren't big seafood eaters -- so I was looking for something totally different. Really loved the addition of dijon, horseradish and parmesan cheese. I am sure this would also be delightful with tuna steaks.

We would give this a 4.5 star rating if we could. I used tilapia loins instead of halibut, light butter, light mayo, panko bread crumbs and baked at 375.  The topping browned/crisped up nicely at the higher temp (what I normally cook the tilapia loins out).  The dijon mustard flavor really came through, so if you're not a huge fan, cut it slightly. Great recipe for beginners - the directions are clear and easy to follow and the method sound.  We'll have again.

this was so amazing that three of us ate over a pound of halibut at one sitting and I am making it again. I don't normally use mayo in anything, so I am going to try Greek yogurt instead, but otherwise this was absolutely increible. Two thumbs up!!

I had a fresh piece of halibut and I found the fish totally over powered by everything on it. I will try the other tips for using less Dijon and a higher oven temperature and see if that helps with the soggyness, extra liquid left and over powering flavor. With some adjustments I think this could be great but as it is I feel like I wasted a perfectly great piece of fish.

This was great, probably will become a Halibut regular.  Easy the first time, will be able to do without looking up a second time.

DELICIOUS!!! Living in Alaska, we are always plum full of halibut in our freezer... and constantly looking for a good recipe to try. This is amazing. I am not one to cook the same recipe over and over, but this is amazing! My husband and I have it at least twice a month. It is very fresh and light tasting with just enough flavor. Yum Yum!

Wow!! This was truly a great recipe. I added more mayo to the mixture and used basa as my fish. I had to turn the oven up to 400° and bake maybe for ten more minutes. Defintaly to be made again!!!!

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe except I left out the cheese simply because I didn't have it on hand. I had 4 4oz fillets of halibut and the recipe made enough to cover them. Set the oven at 400 degrees for 18 minutes and the topping was pretty brown when the fish was done. I would make again, and would make sure I have the cheese on hand. (I made a little sauce to go with the fish by adding a tsp of horseradish to 3 Tbls of mayo. It went very well with the fish.)

I was really nervous about this recipe because I'm not a big fan of fish. This is now one of my favorite recipes! My husband and I loved it and will definitely be trying it again soon. It's so easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly as written and they came out perfect.

Very good even though I messed up reading the directions.  I only put the bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in the topping along with leaving out the margarine.  I baked for one hour, the fish was done but the top wasn't brown so I put it under the broiler for 2 min.  My husband and son loved it.

A tasty halibut recipe which I made with fresh 1-inch thick steaks. I omitted the horseradish (didn't have any) and used panko crumbs in place of the dry bread crumbs. I cooked the fish at 400 degrees F. for just over 20 minutes. I like the recipe for a change with halibut. Thanks for sharing, Christy.

This was wonderful, I loved it! I did use tilapia instead of halibut, and I seasoned my fish with salt, pepper and garlic powder before spreading the paste on them. Panko bread crumbs made a wonderfully crunchy topping and worked much better than traditional bread crumbs. I used olive oil rather than butter for the topping also. I left the paste off of my son's portion, and I'm glad I did because I had just enough the liberally cover the other three fillets. I served this with rice and mixed veggies and had dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes.

This fish was great!  My husband and 13 year old LOVED it!  I served it with garlicky mashed potatoes and salad.  I loved the creamy topping - and then the breadcrumbs.  I cooked it just as directed.  Loved the lemon juice!  Will  make again!

I made this for my boyfriend a little while back and we just loved it!! Now he asks for it anytime I mention fish. He loves fried food but we are trying to eat healthier. This is better than any fried fish I’ve ever had. Not only does it taste great but at just over 300 calories it makes for a great fish dinner that won't undo your day.

Great flavor and extremely easy to prepare.  I would recommend using less of the paste mixture (I was surprised the first time it was paste) and more of the top crumble. I also put a bed of sauted spinach under the fish...my husband thought I was wonderful.  The best recipe for the spinach is "spinach saute" found on this website and made with cream cheese and lemon.

Didn't have dijon or horseradish so I used garlic instead.  Yummy, especially the breadcrumb mixture on top!

This was pretty good.  I used catfish fillets (got 'em on sale) and the flavors were mild yet tastey.  The hint of horseradish counterbalanced that "fishy" taste my husband dislikes.  However, I found it messy to prepare and the dijon coating didn't seem to want to stick.  Next time I'll try patting the fish dry first to see if that helps.

Delicious, beautiful and easy to make. I used sole instead of halibut and it worked great. I sprinkled a little paprika and some dried parsley on top to make it eye catching.

I made this for my family. It was a huge hit, they loved the slightly tangy mustard taste and didnt even want any tartar sauce with the fish! Overall easy to make a pretty tasty.

This fish is absolutely delicious! I followed the other reviewers' advice on cutting down on the horseradish and the mustard. Also I use tilapia instead of halibut. It's about half the price and tilapia is very nice-tasting, mild fish. The first time I used halibut but because of the thickness of the fillets it took a lot longer to bake them than the recipe suggests. Additionally, when prepared this fish looks extremely pretty with the crust on top, so it's a great dish for entertaining dinner guest. In fact my husband and I like it so much that I make it on Christmas Eve as our special Holiday dish. I highly recommend this recipe.

This was fantastic!  I served it at a dinner party and my guests raved.  After cooking it for about 16 minutes, the fish seemed done, but it didn't seem crusty enough, so I put it under the broiler in the middle rack on high.  Because I was distracted, I ended up leaving it there for longer than planned--5 minutes and it ended up great!  this is an easy dish to do most of the prep work before guests arrive.

This recipe was just okay for us.  I have used a similar topping for salmon and found it much more complimentary to the flavor of salmon versus halibut.  It is easy though and provides a moist halibut!

The taste of lemon overcome the taste of fish, so next time I shall reduce it.

Amazing.  I made this for a dinner gathering of 6, the whole thing took me less than 10 mins and everyone thought I slaved in the kitchen all day.  My boyfriend practically begged me to make it the next night.  

The fish was very moist and the topping added to that moisture.  I have made this using a variety of fish such as salmon.

The only draw back is that the mayonnaise is pretty fattening and it basically covers up the flavor of the fish.  And after making it for 3 night in a row, it got a little old.

But I absolutely recommand it to anyone who's short on time and need something yummy to feed a table full of people.

I thought this was a fantastic recipe! A couple of reviewers thought the flavor too tangy or too strong... if you don't like dijon mustard and horseradish, don't make a dish where those are the main flavors other than the fish! Those are strong and tangy flavors! If you like dijon and horseradish however, this is a dish for you to try! It looked very nice too, I would serve it for company.

I am not a huge fish fan, but this is some of the best fish I have ever had.  The only thing I left out was the horseradish - I'm not a big fan.  I certainly didn't miss it - the taste was excellent.

My son didn't like the horseradish, and I tend to agree that it's not too compatible with a fish dish. Also I would include the margarine into step two instead of step four or eliminate it altogether. In step four it makes a paste and it's difficult to "sprinkle" a paste of small volume on that many pieces of fish. I doubt that I would make this dish again.

I'm not a big Halibut fan, as I feel it's a little bland.  With this recipe I won't have a problem serving halibut again.  It was great!  So easy and made for a very nice presentation as well.

Actually Halibut was selling at $10.99/lb so my husband used Cod - it was very tasty and very easy. We look forward to trying the recipe with Halibut when the price comes down a bit.

I always follow a recipe exactly the first time I use it.  This was our NYEve dinner and we loved it.  Halibut is really expensive so it won't be at our table often.  The flavor was wonderful.  I served it on a bed of leeks that I steamed with shallots, thyme, and cherry tomatoes.

I have made this recipe three times now and it is not only excellent, but it is consistently excellent. The flavor of the Dijon and horseradish are calmed by the mayo but still very present with the acid of the lemon keeping it from being cloying. The way the halibut is baked keeps it firm and flavorful without being overly done or dry. Halibut is an expensive choice around here, but I will make this dish again ... more than once. Delicious.

Really nice variation. It is not spicy by default so if you like your dish with a little more kick, then up the horseradish. I went a few minutes short on baking time and then finished it under the broiler to get the breadcrumb sprinkle mixture brown and a little crispy.

This is a great recipe, although I made some minor changes. I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise, I used panko breadcrumbs, I baked at 375,  and I make this amount for only two servings.  Delicious!

After reading all the reviews I cut back a bit on the horseradish  -  although I think using the full amount would have been fine.  I also broiled it for a minute at the end to get the top crunchy!  Served with beef tenderloin, twice baked potatoes, asparagus, and a tossed green salad.

The Dijon did add a nice flavor. Was good, just not my preferred way of cooking halibut.

My family loves this topping when we can afford to buy halibut.  I substitute yogurt for the mayonnaise. I also up the heat to 375 degrees, watch the cooking time though as it changes with thickness of the halibut steak.  A meat thermometer is my best cooking friend.

This was very good.  Next time I would leave off the bread crumb topping.  This fish does not need anymore bread crumbs on it.

When I have thick pieces of halibut I cut them cross-wise and cook for about 10 minutes without any topping so it has a head-start and the bread crumbs won't burn. I substitute miracle whip for mayo and I double the sauce (and actually just make the sauce to put into/on other things) and the whole family plus in-laws love it. It is almost always requested when we have company. :)

overwhelmingly taste of Mayo! Though my wife "Didn't mind it", she is tactful in the extreme. I followed this recipe EXACTLY. I believe this recipe may be salvageable by replacing the mayo with plain yogurt. I will try it tonight. With mayo, this recipe is very heavy.

I loved this halibut recipe.  Easy.  Great combo of favors!  Sometimes I add dill or garlic, but mostly as recipe recommends.  And, when I am in those moods where I need an extra loving, I add more butter and bread crumbs!

I loved this recipe but I used something called wasabi mustard by Woeber instead of horseradish. Since we don't do bread, I used coconut flour to make the crumb topping and in the sauce as well.  I really liked the coconut addition.  It smelled wonderful while cooking.  I will make this again.

This is probably the best fish recipe I have tasted!  I used frozen halibut; so after it thawed, and patted it very dry before making and that helped prevent the wetness commented on earlier.  Placing it under the broiler for a few minutes at the end just to crisp it.
I like that it has so few ingredients and that it is very light. This could definitely be a dish to impress guests!

I made this tonight to use up some halibut I had in the freezer.  It was absolutely delicious!  The dijon, horseradish and lemon mixture give the fish a nice crust and great flavor.  Very simple to make and would be good for eating alone, family dinners and for company.  I will be making this again!

It was soooo good and easy.  The crust is the best part.  I wish I coated both sides.  I did not have horseradish- but mixed in a little pepper jelly with the coating. I also used panko crumbs-and a little olive oil and parm on top- no additional bread crumbs or butter. Baked for 18 min and used the broiler for the last two minutes. YUMMY

This was good but I don't think that I'd make it again.

I used haddock.  The flavor was good.  We will make again.

Excellent fish topping.  When I got to the fresh fish counter, the Halibut did not look particularly good, so I used the same recipe with Talapia.  Wonderful!

this was great!  I wouldn't change a thing - we can't wait to eat it again next week.

This is great-does not taste fishy at all.  The dijon taste really compliments the halibut.
