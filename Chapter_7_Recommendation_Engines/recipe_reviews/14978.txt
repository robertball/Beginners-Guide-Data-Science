Was a great hit!! Remember, if you cut the apples before hand, you can leave them in water and lemon juice to keep from turning brown!

This dip is great! I used an electric mixer to beat it, i made it 2 times in a couple of days and I loved the taste but the consistency was very clumpy and chewy, so the third time I made it I softened the cream cheese and I whipped it until it was like thick whipped cream. It filled up with air and was so much more light and fluffy.(beat at the highest speed your mixer will go).
It was so much better!
Thanks Rachel!

This took less than five minutes to prepare, and it was delicious!  It was lighter tasting than the typical caramel dip you purchase at the store, and a little sweeter than yogurt-based fruit dips.  It is a keeper in my book!

I did keep the cream cheese out for over an hour to soften before I mixed it, and I'm sure this helped a lot.  I wouldn't try mixing it until the cream cheese is quite soft, either from setting out or from microwaving it for a short time.

Growing up, if I wanted an apple, all I got was an apple...Not even any peanut butter.  This dip was a little sweeter than I had expected but it went well with the tart granny smith apples that I love.  My husband does not eat sweets and even he spent a good half hour hovering over the bowl.  Excellent!  Will make again.

this was very good and quick.  a little trick to keep the apple slices from going brown is dipping them in a bowl of sprite pop.  the lemon/lime in the pop keeps them from spoiling rather than using lemon juice which can leave a little bitter taste.  the sprite works great on banana slices as well.  I use this trick at camp and it works wonders!

Very Yummy!  I do recommend that you bring your cream cheese to room temp. so that it is easier to mix your sugar and vanilla in smoothly.  Very good on bagles and would be a nice christmas gift in a pretty jar for your favorite of neighbors!

Excellent.  We served with Granny Smith Apples, like others suggested.  We also ate it with bananas.  Both were equally yummy.  Next time I may serve with a variety of apples, and bananas.  I made it with regular cream cheese, and I am sure low fat would not alter the taste one bit.  I am trying it next.  A dash of cinnamon may also be good in it. I will also try it with grahmn crackers.

MMMMMMMM....This was very yummy! I saw this, went to the kitchen, whipped up a batch and my 4 year old son and I stood right there at the counter and ate it with an apple. (And he's a P-I-C-K-Y eater!!!) Thanks for sharing a now permanent recipe for my family. Kim

I made up this dip for my 5 year old and tried a little before serving. I'm not a fan of cream cheese, and by itself, I think this tastes to creamy cheesy.  However, I then tried it on a piece of apple and was amazed by the taste.  This is a great snack idea!  Thanks for sharing.

I made this because it looked like an easy apple dip. Imagine my surprise when I tasted it & it tasted like the Caramel Bliss Cheeseball mix that I buy from Tastefully Simple for $6.99. Thanks for the recipe!! This is really good with graham crackers too. To make it into a cheeseball just form into a ball & roll into crushed graham crackers. So AWESOME!

I have been making this recipe for years...it's simple to make and has an awesome flavor.  I thinly slice Pink Lady apples and dip in Sprite or 7-up to keep them fresh looking.

I loved this dip... apples will never be the same without it!  I made with low fat cream cheese and no one knew the difference.  I would suggest mixing the vanilla & cream cheese before adding the sugar so you don't get clumps of sugar & vanilla (like I did).

I made this for guests, and it was a big hit!  However, I had found a similar recipe which added one (7 1/2 oz) pkg. almond brickle chips or (10 oz) English toffee bits. I added almond brickle chips, and it was delicious, nice and crunchy.

I made this dip for a party, instead of apples though I made cinnamon tortilla chips. I got SO many rave reviews on the dip!! Kids and Adults LOVED IT!! (It is still very good with apples...)
And it is SOOOO easy to make!! Most people couldn't believe how simple it was when I told them.
I will be making these again!!!

My daughter's passion is apples and this was the perfect dipping sauce.  I too had to leave the cream cheese out for apprx 45 minutes before I bothered mixing the vanilla and brown sugar in. Until now, always used carmel but this is a great substitute and will be used in regular snack rotation. Its so simple, I'm surprised I never thought of it myself! Thanks Rachel!

Utterly simple and utterly delicious. I can't believe how many people have asked what is in this dip. Like other reviewers, using a mixer really helps with the lumps. This is on the short list for appetizers!

A friend of mine brought this to a party and it was cleaned out! Unhealthy appetizers were not eaten as fast as this dip with Granny Smith apples. It's so yummy! She added either a crushed Heath bar or Skor bar to this recipe and it was great!!

I guess if your not a fan of cream cheese like me, you'd better stay away from this one.  I enjoyed this in small bites, but my son was eating it with his finger and off of a spoon.  I added a dash of cinnamon and used Neufchatel cheese.  I would make this again for my kids sake.

Easy, yummy dip!  I used regular cream cheese and made in 30 seconds -- I served it with Granny Smith apples after dinner.  My four year old thought it was dessert!!  I agree with a previous reviewer that it should be used with tart apples (like Granny Smith) since it is so sweet.

This is such a good recipe. It really tastes just like a caramel apple. You can also add some of those Fisher's ice cream nuts from the can, and then it REALLY tastes like a caramel apple! I have also added toffee bits. Be sure to soften the cream cheese before you start for the best consistency. Such good stuff!!!  Have a bunch of apples ready!!

This is a really good, easy recipe.  Perfect way to use up some cream cheese I had in the refrigerator and serve a tasty snack to some friends.

So, I give this recipe a 3 1/2-4 star rating but 5 star for my modified addition. I'll explain. I used fat-free cream cheese and clear vanilla because I ran out of my mexican vanilla and wished I hadn't. But I replaced my brown sugar with a sugar replacer due to health reasons. The brand I used is called "Ideal sugar" and it doesn't have to be hard packed, just scoop and go. And it was the brown sugar line in the brand...and it's delish. Anyway. I still stayed true I feel to the ingredients in this recipe. So having said that, it was thick, not that dip-able for me, no matter how long I mixed it. The flavor was not to my tasting of caramel either, but it tasted good but flavor was also very light. Now, because it was thick as theives, I added 1 tbsp of milk to thin out just a little which worked out nicely. But because the flavor was also light and mellow, I added 1/4 more of the brown sugar replacer but didn't want to over power it with vanilla...And then it was totally to die for. So delish! Now, I'll be making it again just as I have. I didn't want to change anything but to rate the recipe prior...it's a 3 1/2-4 star for me. But in addition to a little milk and a little more brown sugar that I used...it's a winner at 5 stars

*I Highly Recommend This Recipe* This is some seriously delicious, seriously simple dip! I used Neufatchel cheese and it is *SO* good; I can't imagine how good it must be with regular full-fat cream cheese! Thank you! :)

This dip sounds delicious.  I tried an apple dip a friend made, it sounds like this one, but she spread it on a plate and added skor bar pieces to it. It also tasted great with bananas.

I saw a similar recipe elsewhere - but it called for 1 teaspoon added cinnamon.  I added the cinnamon to this recipe and served with apple slices and graham crackers at a work social.  Received rave reviews!

Totally yummy, even when using the lowfat cream cheese. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of five is that the recipe doesn't specify light or dark brown sugar. Tried it with dark first and wasn't thrilled. The second batch with light was much better. Fabulous with any fruit you might dip in a fondue pot and have used it at a fondue party -- unheated, of course.

Awesome recipe!  I whipped it up in seconds and served it with slices of a variety of apples.  Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe!  I highly recommend this recipe when you want something quick, easy and super tasty to serve.

I've used this recipe for years, however mine calls for chopped peanuts as well.  A quick tip:  use lemon-lime soda for your sliced apples instead of lemon juice to keep them from browning.  It doesn't add any additional tartness and I believe it works better!  Just slice them ahead and leave them in a bowl of soda in the fridge, drain before serving.

This is super, for most of my family! My 3-year old is allergic to peanuts, dairy, and eggs, so next time I'm going to try it with the strawberry-flavored cultured coconut milk, or a mashed avocado, instead of the cream cheese.

SUPER, SUPER easy and SOO SOOO good!!  I used light cream cheese to make it less fattening (not totally healthier because you can't get healthy with that amount of brown sugar) and doubled it.  I sliced up a ton of apples, brought them into work with the dip, and it was wonderful.

Piece of Advice:  Use the more tart apples to dip with.  The sweeter ones just overpower everything.  The tart and the dip compliment each other nicely.

It's good but was a little too sweet for me ( I don't have a big sweet tooth).  Very quick to make.  I tossed my apples with just a little pineapple juice to keep them from browning.  I would still make again if I needed to make something quickly for a party.

This was delicious! It had a caramel taste as someone has already mentioned.  We ate these with our "Apple Ladybugs" from this site.  Our apples were Ambrosias and were delicious.

I softened the cream cheese in the microwave before mixing, added a little bit more brown sugar and used regular cream cheese after my first batch with low-fat didn't turn out

Very good. Used Neufchatel cheese. Which has 1/3 less fat than Regular Cream Cheese. You can't tell the difference at all. So good it's tempting to eat it all in one sitting.

I've been making this recipe for years with the addition of toffee bits. I also use light cream cheese and Splenda Brown Sugar Blend just to cut the calories a bit... it tastes delicious and you can't even tell a difference.

I made this recipe with American Neufchatel cheese, rather than full-fat cream cheese.  It was still creamy and flavorful. 1/2 cup of brown sugar was ideal for this recipe.  It was quite sweet, but complemented the tart apples perfectly.

Simple and easy to make but sooooo good.  I have made this for years and my grown daughter makes it for her college friends.  A little healthier than "carmel apples" but it tastes just as good. I sometimes chop peanuts and add them to the dip.  A  "go-to" standard.

This dip was a hit with people at my party, especially the kids.  I used strawberry cream cheese as suggested in some other reviews, and it gave it a more fruity taste.  Very good, caramel-y dip!

I recommend apples that are not sweet, since this dip IS very sweet. Besides being sweet, it takes about two second to prepare, and is very tasty!

Made it today, tasted great, except the vanilla extract overpowered the taste of everything else.  Next time I will try vanilla flavor without the alcohol. 
The alcohol from the extract was very powerful!  Great recipe, and easy too!

This was tasty, but there was only a vague taste of caramel.  The next day, the flavor was stronger.  My fiancé ate it on toast and was very happy with it.  Since it was so easy we will probably make it again.

I had been craving caramel all day.  Found this recipe, made for an after-school snack.  I will definitely make this again!

Tip: If the cream cheese is fresh from the refrigerator, try mixing the ingredients on low heat in a saucepan with a whisk.  Very smooth and warm dip for chilled apples. My son loves it. YUM!

My sister-in-law makes this and adds a layer of caramel sauce on-top of the layer of cream cheese and then tops it with crushed Skor bar.  It is amazing! It is really good with granny smith apples.  We convince ourselves that the apples make this a "healthy" snack.

I was skeptical of the sweetness at first so I started with halving the sugar and vanilla, I ended putting it all in anyway, also I wanted a fluffy texture so I added an 8oz container of cool whip. I know that it was a different dip at this point but very good, served with apples and Stacy's Gingerbread pita chips(only avail @ Xmas Time) great light appetizer!

Fantastic both in taste and easy to make.  However, I would double the recipe as it goes fast!  Per previous reviews, Granny Smiths are the best apples to use!

Just 3 simple ingredients and delicious! Be sure to room temperature your cheese (I used Neufchatel for less fat). Also using an electric mixture to "whip" it makes it nice and fluffy and thoroughly mixes the ingredients. Top with a small pinch of brown sugar and viola! My kids were begging me to lick the bowl!

This is super easy and yummy!  I just put the cream cheese in my storage container and microwaved it for about 30 seconds, whipped it up with a fork, then stirred in the brown sugar and vanilla--No dirty beaters or mixing bowl to deal with.

We actually used this dip for strawberries. It seemed like you need a lighter type of dip for that than you would for apples, so I folded in a bit of cool whip. Yum. Tasted it before the cool whip though, and I could tell this would be delicious with apples. I always have cream cheese so this one's a keeper for me. Thanks!

Easy and delicious!   Softened cream cheese in microwave at 30% power, then whipped ingredients together with a wire whisk.  Also added a dash of cinnamon.   I dipped the cut apples in lemon-lime soda before arranging on the tray around the bowl of dip.  The citric acid in the soda keeps the apples looking great (w/o tasting like lemon!)!

I had a hard time deciding whether or not I liked this recipe. It was pretty tasty, but I have a strong disposition against cream cheese. So while my taste buds were going "yum" my brain was analyzing the texture and saying, "Too cream cheesy!" I ate about half an apple with this, and then I added a dash of cinnamon, and that definitely helped to cut back on the cream cheesiness. I think if I had this at a party or something, and didn't KNOW that there was cream cheese in it, I would definitely think it was delicious.

So...if you like cream cheese, you will love this! It does have a nice warm taste that compliments tart apples nicely.

If you don't like cream cheese, still try this, but add a touch of cinnamon.

I made this dip and my 2nd grader said it was too sweet (!!) so I made it again with half the sugar that the recipe calls for, and I used reduced-fat cream cheese.  It tastes so delicious with those alterations, and every member of my family likes it better.  You can't beat that - a healthier version that people like better!

This was a huge hit with my house warming party.  I did both the plain and strawberry cream cheese.  If you can mix it the night before the brown sugar dissolves completely into the mixture better than doing it just before serving.

This sounded so good that I went out to the store just to buy stuff to make it. I was pretty disappointed. Tasted like cream cheese to me. I'll stick with the fruit dip recipe that has sour cream in it. Sorry....

This dip is amazing!! I always add one cup of cool-whip to give it a little extra smoothness.

Yummy! I made this today for a small get together. I used Hahn's Yogurt Cream Cheese which has a walnut/honey flavor. I served it with apple slices, crackers, strawberries, grapes, etc. It was a great dip for all the fruit. 

Rave reviews from my company!

i followed some of the advice i read in other reviews. if you use a mixer, it's very smooth and creamy and we absolutely LOVED this! definitely use a mixer and soften the cream cheese first though!

This tastes just like caramel and took about one minute to make.  (and still great with low fat cream cheese).  It was great with the apples, and I'm hoping I can think of some more things to put it on.

I love this apple dip, it tastes just like caramel. I tried the suggestion for using strawberry cream cheese, it was good but a little too sweet for me. I think I like using plain light cream cheese. I also added a 1/2 cup of chopped honey roasted peanuts to mine. YUM!

This was only OK - my 2 year old ate some - I threw the rest away.  Maybe I'm just used to the fruit dip with marshmallow creme and cream cheese.  I will go back to my old standby.  Sorry.

Used the strawberry cream cheese and would have liked plain better or to have followed some of the other options for flavor.  People really liked it though and it was extremely easy and economical to make.  Quite nice and pleasant.

Everyone loved this, young and old!  I asked my husband how he liked it, and he said he didn't know, he'd have to try it a few more times.  He tried until it was half gone.  I had to make another dip for the guests.

This was great! My 3 year old is starting to turn her nose up at fruits and veggies and hasn't touched an apple in well over 6 mos. I made this and she absolutely loved it. She ate her's and her little sisters :-)
I only had dark brown sugar so it was a little stronger tasting than I hoped for but overall a great kid pleaser.

Super delicious, super fast, super easy!! We prefer it when we use strawberry cream cheese, but is good with plain too...my son always says, Mom, can we have that healthy snack tonite? You know, with the apples and dip?! Much better than left over Halloween candy! LOL

Thanks for a great fruit dip.  We use it with bananas also.

This recipe is too good to be true and a big hit whenever I make it.  At our last get together, everyone ate this before the rest of the food!  I served it with apple slices and graham crakers, and also added some ice cream/nut toppings to dip in as well.  This is wonderful!

This really does taste like caramel!!  So Easy my small daughter helped.  She then didn't like it, but I think she was just being difficult at the time.  I think most kids and adults will like this recipe!!!

My kids love this!  My oldest has a huge sweet tooth and always wanted the apple carmel dip, but after I made this dip it is all she begs for!  I like it because it is flavored cream cheese and better for her.  It is also great spread on toast and makes a wonderful "carmel sandwich"!  Spread on graham crackers to make a "cookie" is another favorite!  Thank you!!

My mom tried this dip out quite a few years ago and we have always LOVED it and now I make it for my family!  Our favorite way to eat it is to add chopped pecans to the mix and eat it with Granny Smith apples.  FANTASTIC!

Loved it and so easy and quick!  I have an apple every night as a snack so I wanted something to add interest to the apple.  This was a great way to add some flavor.  I made it with low-fat and non-fat cream cheese and it was really good.

I had the neighbors over for breakfast today and they really liked it on the apples and on their bagel.  

Would definitely recommend.

My daughter-in-law had a simular recipe as above but she added an 
8oz. bag of Heath English Toffee Bits (not chocolate) and 1/2 C. Sugar and 1 Tea. of Vanilla and increased the brown sugar to 3/4 C.  All I can say is DELICIOUS......

We make this dip for almost every function we go to, although we do not make it with vanilla. For those that didn't like it you must be doing it wrong. Although pretty hard to mess this one up. We usually have apples left over after all the dip is gone. And despite what some reviewers have found for us, light cream cheese works just fine for this recipe. We start with a half cup of brown sugar then adjust to taste for sweetness. Another twist we added was to put skor toffee bits in for an added sugar kick. But make sure add these in at the last second before serving as the toffee bits can become soggy if added to far in advance. Best part is that it is simple and quick to make and can be made up at a moments notice if the first batch runs out too quickly. Everyone likes it so much that we get in trouble if we don't bring it.

Fantastic!  We made this for a quick addition to our fruit platter.  Delicious, quick, easy, and I had all the ingredients on hand- makes this five stars!  Quick tip-  to hasten the softening process of the cream cheese.  Open the brick of cream cheese, then slice it into eight pieces, separate the pieces on the foil wrapper and leave on the counter for 20 minutes.

I have tried it as it is written and also with low-fat cream cheese and saw no difference. It has been a hit at the parties that I have served it. My guests have asked for the recipe. I have always served it with apples. I think that one reason they like it because they are doing a good thing by eating fruit.

I did not like this dip at all.  Made it for a gathering & it was one of the only desserts that was left at the end of the night.  I followed the recipe exactly, using fresh ingredients & pure vanilla extract, but the flavor combination was odd.  I'm giving it 2 stars because the texture was good & it was easy to make, but I'll never make it again.

A little thick for me.  Second time I substituted a little caramel ice cream sauce for the brown sugar and it worked well.  I just read 7up could keep the apples looking fresh--seems odd but I'm totally trying it!

I teach a four week summer school cooking class for middle schoolers, and they made this apple dip two weeks ago. They loved it! They sampled it with Granny Smith apples, Red Delicious apples, and graham crackers, and they enjoyed them all. When they served it to other students and staff at an end of summer school party, it was a hit! The cooking class students were delighted when the school secretary and some of the teachers asked for the recipe.

I made this for a healtheir-than-normal side for a potluck at work. The co-workers were confused at first, thinking it was a chip dip (despite an apple piece stuck in it for example), but they loved it in the end. Apparently it tastes pretty good on nacho cheese doritos as well...

This was easy to make, and quick. I thawed the cream cheese as others suggested to make it easier and mixed the cheese and vanilla first before adding the sugar.

Pretty good!  I think it worst best with green apples instead of red because this is a pretty sweet dip.

This dip is darn good!!!  Not only for apples, but also with graham crackers, animal crackers, bananas, and as a topping for vanilla ice cream. I did modify it a tad. I doubled the recipe and also added a 7oz jar of Kraft Jet-Puffed Marshmallow Creme. Use an electric mixer to blend the ingredients and the end result will be smooth and DELISH!!!

I usually make peanut butter and cream cheese dip for apples and it's always a huge hit with everyone.  I decided to change it up a bit with this one and the kids who loved the peanut butter dip chose this one over the peanut butter.  The adults really liked both.

One word: Simple. It could not be any easier than this. I took my cream cheese straight from the fridge to bowl. Added the brown sugar and mixed. I was out of vanilla so added vanilla milk (Silk Almond Milk in Sweetened Vanilla flavor). It was a little lumpy just mixing with my fork so I busted out the whisk and it smoothed out quickly. I tasted it then and while super yummy, I was making it for my kids who are used to straight caramel dip. So I went in my fridge, grabbed the caramel sauce we had for ice cream and added some of that. Whisked again and it looks beautiful, smells, wonderful and tastes super yummy! I can not wait until they get home from school and get their snack! Great base recipe that can easily be adapted to suit anyone's tastes/needs (thinner/thicker, sweeter, more of a certain flavor).  Also, easy to scale down and make a smaller amount.

I love this recipe but I add about a half a bag of Skor bits that you can buy next to chocolate chips in the baking aisle and it adds a bit of a crunch and a little more caramel flavor! Delicious!! It would even be good with crushed up Skor bars for a bit if chocolate carmel flavour.

Love this recipe and have served it several times at the daycare center I run.  Kids love it, staff love it - win-win!  I use a mixer to make it really smooth and let it sit for a few hours to help the brown sugar dissolve!  YUM!

This was a big hit with my family as well.  For an even more decadent treat, you can top the dip with caramel sundae topping and crush up a couple of Skor chocolate bars and sprinkle on top.

I found a recipe very similar to this a couple of years ago and my little brother always put in a request for this when he comes home. My recipe calls for a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of toffee bits added to the cream cheese, brown sugar and vanilla. And I use an electric mixer to make it fluffy.

My daughter and I loved this Dip.  However, it wasn't the party favorite at preschool.  I may not be sweet enough and to heavy on the cream cheese taste for little ones.

A bit too much vanilla, I think.  Next time I make it I'll add less vanilla and a bit of cinnamon.

Very good- I liked it a lot! The kids in my daughters' classroom, not so much. I had to make a healthy treat, per the teachers request, but this was not the kids favorite. I didn't care - there was more left for me! Yummy!

This is a great recipe!  I just had it last week at someone's house. The only difference is that they added 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar, then stirred in toffee bits at the end after the other ingredients were well blended.  If you haven't tried it with the toffee bits you need to!  Thanks for sharing!

I saw this in a recent review and went right out in the kitchen and made it.  I used fat-free cream cheese and it turned out just great!  I'm eating it as I type with a cut up Gala apple.

This is a really good recipe!  I haven't made this in years and just came upon it in allrecipes.  When I make it, I usually add 1/2 cup of chopped, skinless peanuts.  I serve apples, bananas and pears with this dip.  I also use light cream cheese to cut some of the calories. I can't wait to make it this weekend when the kids are home!

I've been making this dip since I got the recipe from "Watkins" about 14 years ago.  The only difference is they have you add their caramel flavor in addition to the vanilla.  Delicious!

We used 1/3 fat cream cheese since many reviewers using fat free cream cheese had consistency issues.  The dip is delicious!  We’ve actually made it twice now – once as written & once adding ¼ c extra chunky peanut butter.  With or without (the peanut butter) I think you’ll be pleased with the outcome.

I just served this to my 5 year old, 3 year old and a playmate with red grapes, animal crakers and pretzels.  They loved it!  I used fat free cream cheese and added a couple of tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and a couple of peanut butter and then refridgerated until ready to eat.  It was not super thick but it was not soupy either!  Very yummy!!!

This was a disappointment.  I think we were expecting something a little sweeter.  Ended up throwing away all but a few tablespoons of it after our company left.

This was great! My 2 year olds loved it. They like apples anyway, but this was a special treat. Between them they ate nearly 2 apples!

One word: DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!! Like another rater I used dark brown sugar. It tasted awesome to me. I don't really like fruits but adding this to the side will definitely make this more often, and I love this recipe because it consisted of things I already had on hand. Thanks for sharing this!

This recipe was WAY too sweet and the vanilla flavor was overwhelming (even after cutting it down to a teaspoon.) I'd recommend using 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. With those changes, I think this is a terrific dip - creamy, not too sweet and with a nice "hint" of vanilla...a marvelous way to make an apple more interesting!

Sorry, but my girls and niece wouldn't eat more than one bite of this. I didn't care for it too much myself.  Guess it just wasn't to our taste. Thanx anyway tho :)

I made this in my dorm room- mixed it by hand and used the last of my vanilla- perhaps 3/4tbs. It turned out great! I took it to a girls night and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I will make this again!

This is fantastic!  I made it with low-fat cream cheese and it was wonderful!  Nobody would ever know it was lower in fat unless you told them.  Thanks Rachel!

Pretty basic, but overall a tasty recipe when you need something cheap and easy.  Check out the Chocolate Chip Cream Cheese Ball recipe on here, too -- but just leave out the chocolate chips if you want.  Twice as good as this.

Yum.  This stuff is amazingly good.  Totally addictive.  Both of my kids loved it.  My husband doesnt really like apples, so I had to make him try some.  He ended up eating the most of it.

This recipe was a hit at my daughter's Valentine's party! Her teachers were calling other teachers in to try it and they all wanted the recipe. I did it with strawberry cream cheese and look forward to trying it again with the other suggested ingredients!

Made just as instructed and… Holy cow. I love extra vanilla and I always feel like I'm cheating horribly when I add THAT much extra. So this is perfect for me. :)

This is great tasting!  I am on a diet during the holidays. My twist?  I used fat free cream cheese, Splenda brown sugar, vanilla and threw in a 5 ounce container of Oikos Salted Carmel Greek yogurt.  It was the first dip finished!

This worked out really well for a snack tray I took to a Bible study class.  I followed the recipe, soaked the cut up apples in water with lemon and then I actually smeared cinnamon graham crackers with the spread and topped each cracker with an apple.... Very easy and delicious!

I picked this recipe because it seemed like it would bring the apple out more. I thought it would be a little bit sweeter than it was. The cream cheese was a little stronger than I thought it would be. I added nutmeg to the taste and it was somewhat better. I would suggest adding more flavors because the cream cheese is too overpowering. Great recipe, though!

What a great dip!  I made this for my husband with both red delicious apples and gala apples.  Both were very good.  He loved it so much he said he never wanted to eat an apple without it again!  I will be making this for company!

Very easy & quick.  This is way too much vanilla extract, it overpowered the flavor of the recipe as a whole.  Next time I will start with 1 teaspoon.

This is a very good dip.  It reminded me of the dressing used in grape salad, so in addition to the apple slices, I also served celery sticks, red and green grapes, and mixed in some chopped sugared walnuts.  Think "deconstructed" Waldorf salad.  Yummy!  Be sure and let your cream cheese come to room temperature before mixing.

Pretty good. It tasted like carmel. I used nonfat cream cheese, which clumped, but it tasted good nonetheless.

Have been making this dip for years, always a hit and very versatile. I use room temp reduced fat cream cheese, less sugar as recipe calls for-don't like it too sweet. I also always use a food processor, mini prep to mix- gives a very smooth result and breaks down sugar granules. I like to top with chopped peanuts to give a taste of caramel apples when dipping apples. Thanks for bringing back an old fall fav!

Super yummy, quick and easy to make.  I used low-fat cream cheese(not fat free)and had it at room temp and it mixed up just fine. I didn't pack the brown sugar like you typically do with brown sugar.  I gave it 4 stars because while it was good, I felt like it was lacking something.  I ended up adding 1/3 C. vanilla Greek yogurt and it made it just right.  Everyone loved it, even the picky eaters.  I served it with apples and grapes.  I will make again.

I make this with sour cream instead of cream cheese. It is quite a bit softer and a little more decadent. I like to cube apples and bananas, halve strawberries and toss them in the "dressing" for a simple, but elegant fruit salad.

This dip has a very strange taste by itself. But in combination with an apple it's actually quite delicious. Without the apple it's almost bitter, something is off, maybe too much brown sugar? Or too much vanilla? A tablespoon is an awful lot. I don't know, I can't quite put my finger on it. I'm going to play around with it, the kids went nuts over it, and I thought it was really good, together with a fresh apple. The kids actually ate their apple slices with the peel, without saying one word! That never happens around here. So, my advice, if you follow the recipe exactly, don't taste it while you make it, you won't like it. Wait for the apple! :)

This is a great recipe. We have always used it for parties except we add Heath bar pieces from a bag. We also soak our cut apple slices in Pineapple Juice to keep them from turning. Sooo good!

I love it! Have made it twice, once with lowfat cream cheese, it turned out amazing. The second time was with nonfat, it came out a little soupy, but still tasted great.

simple but tasty - my kind of recipe! I added peanut butter but this is the great thing about a recipe like this - it serves as a great base SO you can add what you want to it to make it your own. Thanks!

yum, yum, happy tums!  Hubs and I love this as is, but when our youngest son thought it was bland, I figured that a bit of cayenne and cinnamon might be what he was looking for.  Didn't measure, but added some in for kicks, and he was a happy camper.  I like the changes as well.  yum, yum, yum, yum, ......, oh, we used FAT-FREE cream cheese, half raw sugar, half stevia - neither of which impact the flavor.  It tasted just like similar dips we have enjoyed at parties.

If I could give this more stars I would. This is beyond easy and it's so good I could eat it with a spoon till I burst! I first tasted this years ago when my child was in preschool and always meant to find the recipe but kept putting it off. When I saw this recipe I thought it sounded like the same thing but I figured it wouldn't be as good because it was so simple. Well I was wrong this is the recipe I was looking for and boy do I wish I had looked this up years ago. I will use this again and again! Thanks so much!

This dip is so delicious and not as sweet as other similar apple dips. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese to make it a little lighter calorie wise.  Thanks for sharing this simple, yummy recipe.

This is really excellent. If you are using a sweet apple (gala, etc) you could easily cut the sugar back to 1/3 cup.

Decadent, creamy, caramel-like, luscious! Everyone raves, skeptical that it's just 1:2 proportions of brown sugar and cream cheese (and a good dose of vanilla). Try it with bananas too!

This is so good.  Made it yesterday with neufchatel cheese, 1/3c br. sugar, and just poured in the vanilla.  didn't have a chance to try it then, but I've eaten it with two honeycrisp apples today and it's been a real effort to not just sit down with a spoon and polish off the rest.  I've not been patient enough to let the dip soften to RT before I eat it, but imagine it would be even better if it could soften and be a bit more dippy.   Will most definately be making this again...

Simple and Tasty.  I cut back a tad on the brown sugar so it wouldn't be too sweet and it was great.  Next time I will make a double batch b/c it will not last long!

This is my favorite fruit dip.  I had forgotten about it and haven't made it in a while.  My mom used to make this when I was growing up.

Just excellent and simple as can be!  I did let my cream cheese get to room temp and I used a blender to mix everything.  My son will love it in his lunches!

I tried a recipe similar to this at work but with an excellent twist: the dip was spread thinly on a plate and melted caramel was spread thinly over the top.  It was sprinkled with broken/crushed Skor bars that were slightly pressed down into the caramel.  Absolutely heavenly!

This dip is excellent.  I used light cream cheese (which I let sit out for an hour to come to room temp) and dark brown sugar.

This recipe is Yum! I made a half batch and ate all of it myself. It was really thick and I kept breaking apples in it so to thin it out, I added about 2 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream.

My daughter and I love this recipe. I initially made it with regular cream cheese and due to some health changes I have started using fat free cream cheese. It tastes just the same with the fat free so I suggest trying it for a healthier twist. My daughter says you can't even taste the difference.

Great tasting, easy & fast!  My daughter asked for some dip to go with her apple slices, and I had it done in no time at all.  I especially like it because it uses ingredients I have on hand.

I made this for my Christmas Eve spread. It was good. I added crushed Heath bar candy to it like suggested by other reviewers and served it with apples and pear slices. Everyone that tried it said it was good but no one made a big deal about it. It was the only thing that remained almost untouched. I ended up throwing it out. Too bad because it was tasty. Just not a hit with my guests.

My family discovered this simple yet amazing recipe years ago, and we forgot the ratio for the ingredients....way better than the store bought stuff, and it does taste great with either regular or light cream cheese!  Great with other fruits, too!  Thank you so much for posting this favorite recipe!: )

Great, easy, recipe. I'm diabetic so we made it with Splenda brown sugar and it tasted wonderul. I don't get sweet things very often and let me tell you this hit the spot. Adding some peanut butter, it made a great dip for celery sticks. 

I even used some leftover "dip" on a sandwich and made it with light wheat bread and it was great! It reminded me of peanut butter and syrup sandwiches.

It reminded me so much of the taste of syrup, that I've decided to use it pancakes next time.

I have made this twice this month!

I've made this dip twice in one week... It's just what I needed to get my husband and I to eat a little more fruit during the day! I use 1/3 less fat cream cheese to make it a tad bit healthier. I'll have to begin adding different things to it for a little variety!

I really loved this! My co-workers are sometimes my guinea pigs when it comes to food, and they all loved it. I also tried it with frozen strawberries mixed in (and a little red food coloring to make it look uniform), but I'm sure you can add anything you like. Thanks for sharing!

This was really good! I didn't have any plain cream cheese at the time, so I substituted honey walnut cream cheese, and didn't add the brown sugar in...yummy! Thanks for the recipe.

For a little bit of a different flavor try a tablespoon of almond extract instead of vanilla.  Very yummy!!!

i really liked this. but i'm more used to saltier dips. it tasted funny with apples but i tried it with pretzals, i liked it better. but if u want a sweet dip these are really easy to make for last minute parties.

I had my kids make dinner the other night. This was our appetizer and was my 6 year old's job. It was very easy, very tasty, and a very good way to build his pride.

Big hit with the kids... I thought it was ok, but mainly tasted like cream cheese.  Maybe it needed more brown sugar?

WE LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I've made it several times. Made it with fat-free cream cheese and it was yucky. I have since made it with the 1/3 less fat and 
it worked out great...I will be making this recipe again and again and again.

This is so good and so easy. I whipped the cream cheese and sugar with my hand mixer so it wouldn't have that grainy texture to it and used 3/4 cup of sugar because I wanted it a little sweeter. I've made this with 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown and it's pretty good that way too. I like it with apples but have used it as a bagel spread also and added a light sprinkle of cinnamon on top. Yum!

I LOVE this stuff!  I have served it everywhere from play groups to potlucks to big family parties and it is always a hit!  It is so simple and fast to make.  I just slice up apples and strawberries along with grapes to dip into this yummy stuff and it goes quickly!  It's also a good way to get fruit into my kids.

This wasn't much of a hit.  My sons each ate his apple, leaving almost all the dip untouched.  Response to my inquiry as to whether each liked it:  A shrug, followed by, "it's ok".  
I didn't find it to be super exciting, either.  It just pretty much tastes like cream cheese.

Tasted good to me, but had to give it a 3:  5 yr old son wouldn't eat it after the first taste, but daughter loved it--just not on apples or any other fruit (in other words she only wanted to eat it straight out of the dish).

This is a great recipe.  My 10 yr old made it without any problems and loved it, as well as her 7 yr old brother.  She used the mixer until it was nice an creamy-no gritty texture at all.  They can't wait to share it with thier class.

Excellent! This tastes wonderful and is so much better for you, and cheaper, than the store bought dip. This only took a couple of minutes to whip up. So easy! Thanks!

Two of my daughters enjoyed this dip, and it's a great way to get them to eat their fruit! I thought it tasted just like a cheesecake I have made often.

This is always delicious - a big hit.  I serve it my group that meets once a week and it goes quickly always.  A refreshing summer (slightly healthy) snack.  You can pick any flavor of cream cheese to do this with - mixed berries is really tasty too.

Great dip...simple, but delicious!! For some reason the combination of cream cheese, brown sugar and vanilla give this dip a sweet buttery taste.

Awesome quick snack. Just tried it with a little powdered sugar and it is even better. My 2 yearold loves it on any fruit or vegetable.

This was quick and good.  I only used 1/2 T. of vanilla.  This will be handy to use, as the ingredients are something you would always have on hand.  We will try again and again.

It wasn't thick enough, so it was more like a juice.  and i also added a scoop of vanillia ice cream so it was thicker and had that vanillia tinge.  I also used orabge juice instead of the  orange.  The flavor is just, ... to... healthy..i guess the ginger didn't make it for me.

My kids and plus 3 friends are enjoying this right now with apple slices, and all I hear is "This is soooooo good!" and "Oooh, like caramel, but better!" and "Mom, can we have this for dinner?"  I think it's a hit!  My only tip is to microwave the cream cheese a little to soften it up.  I think it tastes better a little warm anyway.
