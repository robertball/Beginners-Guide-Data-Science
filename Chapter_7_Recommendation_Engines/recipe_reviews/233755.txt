This is wonderful.  I like the orange/strawberry combo with the vanilla notes.  This would be good on anything toasted, as well as a drizzle on cake as one recipeep on the Buzz mentioned.  I did not have orange liqueur, so I used orange extract.  I think next time I make it I will buy the liqueur.  I also used 1/3 of the orange peel; next time I will leave it out as I did not like biting into the bits of orange rind.

I absolutely loved this jam! While I've tried making many different types of jam in the past, I've always come back to classic plain strawberry as my favorite and it was the only kind I made year after year until now. I had some leftover strawberries and decided to try this recipe out and to my pleasant surprise I like it even better than the plain strawberry.  As I made this at the last minute, I did not add the liqueur or the orange zest simply because I did not have those ingredients on hand. I will be adding this to my yearly canning list, and next time I make it I will add in the zest, but probably not the liqueur just because of the added expense.

Love it, wouldn't change a thing!  Orange really goes well with the sweet strawberry!  Okay, I made half a batch, added flavor protector and no pectin, when refrigerated the jam became almost like concrete!, but became more viscous at RT.  Maybe less sugar and no pectin again next time.

The flavor is good. I did use the orange liqueur. Next time I will cut the vanilla to 1/3 of recipe and add one more orange for zesting.

I have made this three times so far, and hardly have any left for myself! Very tasty and love the creamsicle flavour. Only problem I have is that it is a little runny- closer to a coulis than a jam. I have played with cooking times and sugar quantities but no luck yet, however, I am now on my fourth batch and hopefully I will get closer to my target of a firmer consistency. Fun recipe.

My daughters and I just finished putting up 48 pints.  This is the third year we have made this to give to teachers and friends for Christmas.  It always receives rave reviews and is our most favorite jam recipe.  It is good on toast and can be used on ice cream or as a topping for other desserts.  We just used it  spooned on top of a triple chocolate cheesecake.  Absolutely yummy!

This recipe used way too much sugar, but it was still good.  I got 5 pints and one half pint out of this recipe and didn't change a thing.  This would be good on English toasting bread and English muffins too.  My Mom loves Orange Marmalade, which is very time consuming to make, so I think this will be a close second with her.
