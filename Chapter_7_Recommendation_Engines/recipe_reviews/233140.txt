This is how i made this, i followed the basic recipe but i used two fat purple eggplants, two small green peppers, two large red peppers and two jalapeno peppers.  I  coated the veggies with oil and grilled till the skins started to peel and the veggies were a little floppy on a webber grill, you want a little black on the skins, it adds flavor.  I used about a half a cup of fresh onions and one lemon plus 3 tablespoons of the vinegar. 
I also added 1/2 teas. smoked paprika. Other than that i pretty much followed the basic recipe.  If you like spice grill extra Jalapeno peppers and peel them and set them aside, make your dip and taste adding jalapeno peppers one at a time. each time you add a pepper it needs to sit so the flavor mixes, you can make it one day and let sit overnight then adjust seasonings the next day, the longer it sits the spice will come out so be careful. This is an amazing recipe you can serve this with pita chips,  or use it as a relish on burgers or hot dogs.  It may be good mixed with mustard or even cream cheese i have not tried that yet.  I pulsed all in a food processor except the onions i chopped them fine first and added them at the end.

This was yummy - nice and spicy. I roasted the eggplant with skin on then scooped out the centers.  I roasted the pepper separately with the garlic.    I only had the red pepper on hand so I added some pickled jalape√±os - not the best choice.  I will make sure to have an additional fresh pepper variety next time.  I had fresh basil on hand so added a handful of that at the end.  Served with chopped green onion on top plus a nice bit of parmesan cheese.  It was really tasty the first night and even better the next.  Served with pita chips.

Like this recipe a lot.  Added a pinch of ground cumin to enhance the chilies.
