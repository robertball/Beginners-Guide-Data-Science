Turned out great! I made half a dozen, followed the recipe exactly. Just make sure you don't mix the wet ingredients and the dry ingredients too much. That's the key to making good muffins.

I used part brown sugar, and added a splash of vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon. You can really taste the banana flavor. and adding nuts is delicious!

Good + very easy.  Wouldn't beat them though, it makes them drier - the key is to barely moisten the mixture and then pop them in the tin.

This recipe was wonderful!  The muffins were moist and tender.  I'll definitely use this recipe again, and all other banana recipes will be compared to it.  Like other readers, I added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  Enjoy!

Wow, these are really good!  I think they're even better than my banana bread.  I did use less butter, and added about 1/4 cup applesauce to cut the fat.  As per other suggestions, I added some vanilla, and cinnamon, and the result was a moist, spongy banana-y muffin.  Excellent!  And low fat!!!!

This is an excellent recipe.  I give it 5 stars and I didnt add the spices like some of the others did.  I didn't want a spice muffin.  I wanted a banana nut recipe and thought this one looked very good with the real butter in the ingredients and by the pictures of it. Be sure to mix the wet ingredients first. The secret is to mix by hand and not to overmix. I added walnuts and mixed it up night before and kept in refrigerator to bake fresh in morning.   Muffins didn't stick to paper liners. Delicious recipe!

These muffins are really great!!  We bake these everytime we have mushy bananas.  I have substituted one individual applesauce cup for the butter and they turn out just as good, but with less fat!!  I usually also add about a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon. I always make the mini muffins and you MUST increase the time by several minutes (if you want them golden on top and not mushy).  The kids gobble them up!!

This recipe is PERFECT!  I wouldn't change a thing about it.  I must admit that I used 3 cups of mashed bananas per batch and I really don't know how many cups 3 large bananas make.    My kids gobbled up these muffins (mini & full size) and I realized I finally found a more convenient (and yummier) "Banana Bread" recipe than the one I had.  These muffins taste exactly like the bread recipe I've been searching for!  Whoever said Banana Bread had to be in loaf form?  :)  Thanks so much!      *TIP*  I always have several bags of frozen mashed bananas on hand.  I used to just freeze the whole banana, but realized it was much easier to mash them up beforehand and portion them at 2-3 cups per Quart Freezer Ziplock bag.  Lay them flat in a 13 x 9 pan and freeze.  Once frozen you can remove them from the pan and store them in the freezer.

I made these for my MIL & she absolutely loved them. I added a little vanilla extract & a touch of cinnamon, otherwise I followed the recipe. I only have one mini muffin pan so I made 2 doz.,& a small loaf as well. Very moist, with great banana flavor. Thanks Abi, for a recipe I will definitely use many times:o)

these were great!  My kids love them.  I've made them now as standard sized and mini muffins.  My kids like the minis the best.  They were very moist.  I have followed the recipe to a T and they were delicious, but they are also delicious with my alterations.  I've been making them for months now with 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla.  I also add 3/4 cup of mini choc chips sometimes.  But what I mostly like is that I use a combo of mostly wheat flour with a little white.  I use the Splenda baking blend.  I sub no sugar applesauce in place of the butter and I use egg white egg substitute for the eggs.  They are healthier and just a delicious!

This recipe was so easy! They were delicious! I added a dash of cinnamon and a dash of vanilla, but even without these I think they would have been great! A great Sunday morning snack! I am definitely going to make these again and again!!

I consider myself a banana bread/muffin connoisseur.  These are THE BEST (and easiest) muffins I have ever made or eaten.  Period.  I added the tsp. of vanilla as suggested and some chocolate chips, because that's the way we like our banana bread in our house.  AWESOME recipe. I wish I could give it ten stars! Thanks Abi!!!

I have made these with no changes and they are good that way.  I thought my muffin tin was large because they are bigger than my mini tin, but when they were in the oven for 20 minutes, they were done.  So make sure you watch them!  25-30 minutes may be way too long.  I have a banana everyday for breakfast and as they start to turn I put them in the freezer for bread.  I had a stockpile of 10 bananas to use up.  I came upon this recipe while looking for something new.  I have made a second batch with streusel on top, and a third batch adding vanilla, pecans and 1/4 bag of peanut butter/chocolate chips, using the mini muffin tins.  I must say that from now on, I will be doing that with all my leftover bananas!!!! I definetly loved the mini muffins with the vanilla, pecans and chips so much more!!!  All I can say is.....WOW! They would make a great morning breakfast treat....if they last that long.  You gotta try these!!!! Thanks for a great recipe ABI_GODFREY

Really really good. I was craving gooey sweet banana muffins today and this recipe was a perfect fix. I substituted the same amount of olive oil for the melted butter and followed the others' advice and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Will definitely make again.

I added some chocolate chips to mine for the kids. I also used 2 bananas I had forgotten about in the freezer! They were frozen with the skins on in a plastic bag and I barely had to mash them at all once I defrosted them and peeled them for the recipe. What a great way to store and use up those sad looking 'nanas.

I enjoyed this recipe, but made little variations to increase the nutritional value. First off, I used a cup of whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup of oats. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar. The amount of butter was cut down just a little, and I added 1/4 cup of vegetable oil. With a little vanilla, 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg, these muffins turned out pretty good! Next time, I'd go with a little more banana's as well.

I scaled down the recipe to make only 24 mini muffins (8 servings on calculator) as I had only 2 bananas.  It worked out perfectly, filling each cup to the top.  I took the liberty of adding 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract, a pinch of ground cinnamon and 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts.  The muffins baked for exactly 12 minutes.  I'll be making these again with the same proportions and may ice or top with struesel the next time.

This recipe is fantastic. I love that there is a powerful flavor of bananas instead of sugars and oils. But I admit it not being as moist as I would love it to be. Try melting butter and basting on the tops of the muffins. It gives a little bit to the muffins. :-)

Yum!! These were very good... nice and moist is how banana muffins should be.  We loved them.  I took other user's advice and added some cinnamon, and sprinkled the tops with cinnamon and sugar prior to baking.  I also added some freshly grated nutmeg to the batter.  Super good.  Try them.

Very good! I used about 5 medium-sized overripe bananas. I accidentally forgot to add the salt, but they still turned out well. I would also recommend baking the muffins for 20 minutes, tops, if you're making 12 muffins.

This is an AWESOME recipe! My 23 month old and "almost" 4 old had a great time helping. I substituted 3/4 C whole wheat and 3/4 C white flour. In lieu of butter, I used 1/3 C canned pumpkin. The pumpkin is basically undectable, and you are adding in some good vitamins while cutting a few calories. I topped it off with some Pampered Chef sweet apple sprinkle I had on hand. I think next time I will try to sneak in some spinich :) I know, a nasty trick to play on unsuspecting youngsters.

My kids (6 and 9) loved these.  I had decided to try muffins after a couple of less than successful trys with bread (it was too dark on the outside but had a moist spot in the center).  These were a wonderful taste and texture and very easy to make.  I will be making these again.

I used a whole stick of butter and also added a cup of quick oats to the flour mixture. It added a great texture and fills you up more!

These were awesome.  I too added a splash of vanilla, but I also added some chopped walnuts and chocolate chips.  I made mini muffins and they turned out great!

Wonderful recipe!  I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  Everything else was per the recipe.  My husband could not stop eating them!  For a garnish, I sprinkled confectioners sugar on top.  They were delicious!!

I decided to make muffin tops using this recipe. When I made this the batter seemed to be somewhat thick, but I threw it in the oven anyways. The muffin tops appeared more like scones and tasted increadibly salty. What did I do wrong?

These muffins were delicious, and very quick and easy to make. I recommend watching them closely the first time you make them, because it didn't take as long as suggested to bake them. I added one tsp. of vanilla and some nutmeg to the batter and sprinkled walnut pieces on top before baking. I will definitly be making these again!

I replaced the butter with unsweetened applesauce to cut the fat & cholesterol. And added 1/2 cup chocolate chips as an added treat. The result was a moist delicious muffin that I will definately make again.

I added 3 large bananas to the recipe, but otherwise followed what was already written. I beat the bananas first then added everything else to them. I got 24 mini-muffins and 22 regular muffins. I filled each muffin spot almost full (I like bulging muffins). The muffins came out full, super moist, flaverful, great color, and delicious! I've added the recipe to my book of recipes.

I love these muffins- they are moist and tender with just the right amount of banana flavor for me.  I made them just as written and will be making them again as soon as I run out. Great way to use up a few extra bananas. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is delish. I used Turvia instead of sugar and applesauce instead of butter. I can honestly say the Truvia doesn't leave that nasty aftertaste. It does not taste buttery as when I used butter, but it is definitely sweet, no aftertaste and is delish!

These are awesome. I did substitute apple sauce for the egg, (3 tbsp) and I only put a 1/2 cup of sugar since the apple sauce is sweet. A better-for-you version, they were perfect. And very moist!

Excellent, moist and delicious muffins!  I omitted salt to reduce sodium, used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white (just because I often do that), and added 1/2 c nuts.  I have made these several times now and they are always such a hit that I have to double the recipe.  I do not feel that these would be improved with additional spices as others suggested; they are great with just the banana taste.  Thanks!

Really nice muffins, a little crispiness on top and soft inside. As other reviewers I added 1/2 cup chopped pecans and 1 tsp vanilla and used 1/4 cup packed brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.

For a healthier twist, I added 1/2 cup of quick cooking oats, and replaced butter with margarine. I also reduced the salt in half. It turned out dense, and it's not too sweet, which is perfect for breakfast. =)

Fool-proof banana muffins! Great as a basic recipe to experiment with. I used part brown sugar and replaced the butter with the same amount in vegetable oil. It made for a very moist and tasty muffin!

I always use bananas with brown spots for baking. Even with 1/4 cup sugar, they were sweet so I will omit it next time since I have them for breakfast or an afternoon snack. Cinnamon would a great addition.

These muffins were a real hit.  I made a couple minor changes: used brown sugar instead of white, and added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  These muffins were very moist and tasty.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Great recipe. Substituted 1/3 C sour cream for the butter (all I had at the time) and still came out great! Plus simple enough to make anytime. Recipe is a keeper!

Absolutely fantastic muffins!!!! So easy to make and really simple and delicious. I used olive oil instead of melted butter, and halved the sugar. YUM!

I just made these with my kids.  We did the mini muffins and they came out great.  I made a couple changes though.....4 bananas not 3 since I had 4 on hand and added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2tsp. cinamon.  Kids love them and was super easy to make!!

Easy and quick to make, delicious, and kid-friendly.  They do spring back when they're done, so it's easy to know when to stop putting them back in the oven!  Thanks for the recipe!

These turned out amazing. I decided to add some vanilla and I did what other people advised to do and just folded the flour in with a rubber spatula and they turned out perfectly moist. :3 I also chopped up some walnuts and sprinkled them over the tops before putting them into the oven. It made them soooo beautiful. :D

Delicious! Incredibly moist and full of banana flavor. I think this is a wonderful base for banana muffins, and plan to mix nuts and chocolate chips into it in the future.

Very easy to make and very adaptable. In the recipe I substituted 1/4 cup of packed light brown sugar for part of the sugar and added in 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. They are baking now I hope they will be as good as they smell baking.

my first muffin made ever!! it was easy for even a beginner like me and they turned out well! :) I did everything as the recipe except as others suggested replacing the butter with apple butter, and I was scared it might be too sweet so cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup, they came out really nice!

This was a wonderful recipe. The muffins were moist and full of the banana flavor you'd expect from a "banana" muffin. The only extra thing I did was sprinkle a little cinnamon sugar on them before they baked up.

Unfortunately, I cannot agree with any of the other good reviews.  I found these muffins to be very bland and dry.  I even added an extra banana for flavor based on other reviews and was still dissapointed.  I cannot even think how much more bland it would have been without the extra banana.  I would never make this again.

This is a very good recipe. It has more bananas than other recipes which is exactly what I was looking for. The reason these are coming out dry for so many people is that the cooking time is WAY off. At 350, these should be baking for 18 to 20 minutes MAX. Not 25 to 30. I also added some cinnamon and vanilla and these are perfect.

Very tasty. Added 2 T of oat bran to the mix to pump up fiber content.  Also chucked a handful of chopped walnuts and finely ground walnuts that I had in the freezer.  No added spices or vanilla for me. We like our banana muffin flavor pure and unadulterated in this house!  A keeper!

Fantastic, I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar and added about 1 tsp vanilla. It made 36 mini muffins baked at about 12 minutes. Made it for a play-date and it was gone in a minute.

Fantistic recipe...my husband says that this is the best banana bread I have ever made.  I only had two smaller bananas so I subbed two of those single serving applesauce cups.  Delicious!!

As recommended by other reviewers I added 1t vanilla & cinnamon, and substituted 1/4 cup of white sugar for brown sugar. Delicious. Exactly what you expect from a banana muffin. An excellant way to use up frozen overripe bananas

Very good, moist. I substituted self-rising flour for the baking powder and baking soda, and added a teaspoon of vanilla. Everyone loved them!

Perfect simple banana muffin. Only thing it was missing was a teaspoon of vanilla. I did use whole wheat white flour. Twelve muffins exactly--mine were done just about 20 minutes. Great way for me to use the many frozen bananas I had in my freezer before moving day AND bake something with my kids. It might be too sweet, but that's not a deal breaker.

I added dashes of nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla extract like others suggested along with about 2 tbsp cocoa powder and they smelled amazing and have a nice subtle chocolate taste. Great recipe!

we really like this recipe, we sometimes add nuts chopped or chocolate chips a half cup of either just to spice things up a little and make them special. But alone or with added ingredients these are wonderful and easy.

This is the best recipe I've come across. I think using the melted butter works better than softened butter. Also, I prefer brown sugar instead of white. I added 1/4 tsp of vanilla & 1/4 tsp of cinnamon & they are perfect. However, I have to cook them 20 to 25 mins which is longer than what the recipe calls for. Maybe it's my oven.

Great recipe!  I just made these muffins as directed and they turned out perfectly!  Only thing I added was a cup of raisins because I love raisins in my banana muffins. This will be my new "go to" banana muffin recipe!  Thanks for sharing it!

Easy, easy, easy.  And surprisingly good, too!  Took about five minutes to put together.  I followed the recipe, but did add a touch of vanilla, though this could stand on its own without it.  Tasty, makes the house smell wonderful.  This is a really good recipe if you want to do add-ins like nuts, or chocolate chips.

Followed the recipe exactly, except to add a small handful of semisweet chocolate chips and a tsp of  vanilla extract as per other reviewers here. 

They turned out SO GOOD! So moist and light and banana-y and just wonderful in every way.

I swap out the butter and use pumpkin instead as well as add some cinnamon and wheat germ (can't taste it at all but get some addt'l fiber) and they are just as good with the butter. :)

I bake these once a month and freeze them for fun snacks later for my highschooler. Also add about and handful mini chocolate chips for a bonus. These are so moist and yummy. Like mini bananna bread muffins.

These are perfect personal sized portions of moist banana bread.  Aside from the addition of some raisins, I followed the recipe as written and could not have asked for a better result!

Really great recipe.   Thank you!.  It was easy to make.  Modifications I made: Replaced butter with Canola oil, reduced sugar to half a cup of sugar and used brown sugar, added chocolate chips and a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice.  I think I'll up the sugar back to 3/4 since brown sugar doesn't seem as sweet as white sugar.  Definitely would make it again.

These muffins turned out really great! They tasted 'healthy' because I used white whole wheat flour. I also added chopped pecans and a tsp of vanilla. The texture on top was perfect, not too soft, with just the right crispiness. And great moisture inside, specially when had warm. Next time, I will try these with brown sugar and nuts sprinkled on top.

These turn out really good even if you completely forget to add the sugar!  Would be better w/sugar, but what isn't?  Made a 2nd time w/sugar, very good - had 14 muffins and this time added 1/2 c. of chopped walnuts, really liked those in there.  Had to bake them longer, I think I may have had an extra 1/2 c of banana, so that is probably why, but they were in the oven a good 18-20 minutes and still were very moist.

These were just so good.  I love how the recipe uses just simple pantry ingredients.  I made 15 standard size muffins and followed the recipe exactly although I did add 1 teaspoon of Banana extract and a few chopped walnuts to the top.  These muffins were so moist and I just loved the crunch of the walnut top.

I love this recipe.  I add 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips.  My kids bring these muffins to school for their birthday celebrations.  We top them with a cream cheese icing: 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup cream cheese, and 1 1/2 cups powder sugar.  Yummy!

I halved the recipe and made 24 mini muffins baked for 12 minutes for my 2 year old.  She loves them!  Easy to make, the melted butter gives it a nice flavor.  I added a dash each of nutmeg, ginger, and cinnamon (I always add that blend to banana and pumpkin breads), but otherwise followed the recipe.  Yum!

Sometimes simple is best!!!  These are by far the best banana muffins I have ever made and I've been cooking for over 20 yrs.  I did substitute 1/2 c of the white flour for whole wheat, added 1 tsp vanilla, chopped walnuts and choc. chips.  The key really is to NOT overmix!  Super simple and delicious!!!

When I had some ripe bananas and a bit of time in the morning, I went looking for a nice, simple little muffin recipe.  This was perfect!  After making the muffins, and eating a few, I went out to run some errands.  Upon my return, they were all gone, courtesy of my teen age son.  I'll call these a hit!

This is a quick,easy and yummy recipe. I had all of the ingredients on hand. My only substitution was using brown sugar, instead of white. Thanks for sharing. I'll make these again...for sure:)

I am giving these 5 stars because they are great for kids, tasty and moist and really easy to make!  I used others advice and cut back on the butter and replaced the difference with applesauce.  I also froze my mini muffins in tiny zip lock snack bags (like "cookin mommi" suggested) so I can pop in my kids lunch bags for school snack.... because the mini muffins do thaw by snack time - which is soooooo great!  And my kids just love them!

These are great.  Like other reviewers, I added 1 t vanilla & 1 t cinnamon.  I sprinkled the tops with cinnamon/sugar mixture before baking.  I have also made them with chopped nuts and/or chocolate chips.

Really love these muffins...made a double batch as I had lot of super-ripe bananas.  I used 1 c. applesauce instead of butter (1/2 c. per batch) and they were supermoist.  I never missed the butter.  Also added a good amount of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I always spray the cupcake papers, makes them easy to get out after freezing.

I followed some of the suggestions and added a teasp of cinnamon and 1/2 teasp vanilla. i also added some oats and sprinkled some on top wit soem brown sugar and cinnamon. but the muffins did not rise as much as i like, and they are a little too mushy inside. could use a little more flavor too.

Delicious!  I substitute 4 oz. of unsweetened applesauce + 1 Tbsp of sour cream for the melted butter, add a splash of vanilla extract and a sprinkle of cinnamon, and bake in a non-stick mini muffin pan sprayed lightly with cooking spray (paper liners not needed).  Then I freeze them in snack-size ziploc bags, three to a bag.  In the morning, toss into the kids' lunchboxes and they're thawed by snacktime at school!

I would have given 5 stars if the recipe included 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg and one more banana.  I made the recipe as-is the first time and it was definitely lacking something.  The extra banana is really necessary to get a nice moist muffin and the spices are common and found in every kitchen so it is foolish to not include something!  My version made 12 med size muffins which I baked 25 mins to perfection.  And, I always use paper liners since it makes cleanup a snap!

When you combine the wet and dry ingredients, DO NOT "beat until smooth".  What this wonderful recipe means to say is "gently fold together".  This will yield fabulous, moist, delicious muffins.

I decided to try these after reading all of the great reviews on them.  I have to agree...they are delicious!   I took the advice of others and added 1 tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla and I added a 4th banana and some chopped walnuts.  They are very moist.  My whole family loved them....even my 6 yr old who doesn't like nuts in things like this!

I made a batch of these yesterday - they turned out quite tasty! I added 1/4 cup of walnuts, 1 tsp vanilla,an extra half banana, half brown sugar/half white instead of what the recipe calls for. I think next time I make them I am going to substitute some of the white flour with whole wheat.I found them to be really light and airy and I think the whole wheat flour would make them a little heavier. I would definitely use this recipe again. Thanks!

These were very good, with just a few adjustments.  As recommended by other reviewers, I added 1 tsp vanilla extract, used 1/2 cup light brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  Tasted good both hot out of the oven and cool.  Nice light texture and great flavor!  The bananas I used were almost black, very ripe and soft.  My husband, who loves banana nut muffins, thought these were good, and even my picky 4 year old ate one and liked it!  I will make this whenever I have overripe bananas!!  Thanks for the recipe Abi!

This batter seemed awful thick for muffin batter. Ive never had batter come out this thick....like cookie dough thick, and I followed the recipe as directed. I didnt over mix either. They did not cook all the way through and had an unappealing afte taste. I will not be using this recipe again.

I've made these twice with banana's that have turned and the kids love them!  First time I made exact as recipe and they were good.  Second time I made them with applesauce instead of butter (neighbor kid allergic to milk proteins) and added a bit of allspice--amazing!  I double the batch and they are gone!   Keep this recipe--simple, easy and fast!!

These were moist and delicious with lots of banana flavor.  Definitely a keeper!  We always have bananas in the house so these will be a regular recipe at our house.  I added 1 tsp vanilla and subbed applesauce for the butter - everything else was per the recipe.  I don't think any spices are necessary - these muffins have plenty of flavor.

PERFECT, YUMMY and what I like to call "stupid simple".....AND, I totally AGREE with the "do not beat flour to much" but I find that's a good rule of thumb for many things.  I DID add vanilla and cinnamon for added flavor.  Perfect and WAY BETTER then any mix I have ever had and I know what's in them.  A million thanks for this winner.

This made an excellent banana bread. I made it in an 8x8 pan instead of muffin tins. I used 4 large bananas, added a splash of vanilla and baked it for 35-40 minutes at 350. It's the best banana bread I have made. It has even more banana flavor than the Banana Banana Bread recipe on this site. This will be my go to recipe for banana bread/muffins from now. Thanks for sharing.

I LOVE this recipe. I do add between 2-4 tbsps of ground flax for some additional fiber, but it's tasty as is. Not too sweet, just right!

Followed the recipe exactly. These were great. I always have trouble baking banana bread, and these muffins are the way to go. Thanks for the recipe!

I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and a sprinkle of nutmeg. I also filled each cupcake compartment almost to the top, for larger muffins. It helps to put the bananas the freezer to hasten the ripening and add a fresh one for maximum banana flavour.

"Easy" is SO misleading! My husband and his friend were heading out this morning early. These were ready to go with them in 30 minutes...I did add 2 T of flour for high altitude baking, and a whole stick of butter. They are FABULOUS! Made 6 ginormous muffins (man-size muffins) They are light, full of flavor, easy to make and done in a heartbeat- can't beat this for homemade!

I liked these muffins, however I did do a few modifications due to other reviews.  I used 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, and 1/4 cup white sugar, overly ripe banana's, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  By using overly ripe banana's I had no problem tasting the banana's in the muffins.

made these as is, also with changes of canola oil instead of butter, 1/2 wheat flour 1/2 all purpose, cinnamon, nutmeg. 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white Added extra banana with both recipes. Original was a 5 the other also a 5, just a little healthier. When I say 1/2 I mean 1/2 of the amount called for.

Right off the bat, I can say that It SMELLS amazing while baking. Bannanas are so fragrant. Instead of muffins, I baked this in a 8 by 8 square cake pan. I tweaked the recipe to my availability of ingredients. I used half a cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar, and then a generous of tablespoons of honey and drizzled it in after I creamed the butter sugar, egg and bananas into sort of soup. I also used a bit more banana, I used four bananas, two really large ones, and two medium ones. The cake I made turned out dense, fragrant and flavorful. I also added a dash (about a teaspoon) of cocoa powder which tastes AMAZING (a little goes a long way) and also a some walnuts into the batter and i topped the cake off with almond halves for decoration.

I made 400 of these for a class of 7th graders, and they loved them. Do not overmix.  Using cupcake liners helps to keep them moist.

fantastic...I have an old banana bread recipe that is very close to this only this one had a few twists that I liked. This recipe uses less flour, less eggs and more bananas. Someone said they only used 1/2 cup sugar so I did too. I had some walnuts leftover from a Christmas recipe that were already chopped up, so I threw those in. (They had a little cinnamon in them.) The only thing that I really changed was the butter. My old recipe calls for 1/3 cup cooking oil, so I used that instead of the butter. (figured it'd be healthier) I only had enough baking cups for 6 of the muffins, so I made the other half using a little Pam instead. Both ways turned out great. I'll be making these again.

I healthified these muffins by using 1/3 apple sauce instead of the butter. I added some chopped dates and flax seeds. I used mostly brown sugar and coconut sugar with a little white. And finally I used an all-purpose gluten-free flour. They came out moist and tasty.

Excellent.  Very moist and very easy to make.  Once I had the batter done I knew it was going to be good because it was just so fluffy.  I used egg replacer rather than the egg (we have an egg allergy in my house) and it was still awesome.  This recipe has been printed and added to my binder as my one and only banana muffin recipe.  Thumbs up!

Great recipe. I used it as a template to build on. I added 1 tsp vanilla, 2 tbsp cocoa powder, 1/2 cup chic chips and decreased the sugar slightly. they were truly delicious!

Great muffins, I added 1 tablespoon of honey to add a little extra sweetness that seamed to be lacking.  It worked beautifully, plus they were soft the next day because of the honey.

This is a great recipe that holds up well to some substitutions. I use a gluten-free flour substitute. For a healthier muffin, in place of 1/3 cup or butter, I use 1/3 cup of applesauce and 2 table spoons of butter. Sometimes I throw in 2 tablespoons of poppy seeds and they still come out tasting amazing!
The other thing I do is use 1 and a half times the ingredients to make larger muffins. All the same, this recipe deserves 5 stars.

I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour, 4 bananas, and cut the sugar to a little less than 1/2 a cup.  I used Extra Light Olive Oil (can be used for baking and tastes similar to butter with a nutty flavor).  So I would need 4 tablespoons of the Olive Oil...well instead of 4 I used 3 and added 3 tablespoons of Flax seed which replaces a tablespoon of oil.  I also didn't add salt.  I did add 2 tsp of vanilla and 2 tsp cinnamon.  These muffins came out soooo good.  My house smelled of banana muffins!!  Will definitely make again!!

Loved this recipe! I made these and my family really enjoyed them. I added a little more banana than suggested because I like bananas and it turned out really good. I will definitely be making more banana muffins in the future! :)

such an easy and good recipe!  the kids love to help 'mush' the bananas, today we added a splash of vanilla and a few large choc chips (dropped into each muffin after filling with batter)!  Have also added other fruit too (strawberries and blueberries- added a little extra flour to offset extra liqued)!

These were great. I made some changes, including replacing the butter with applesauce, which made it a bit cake-y.  I like it more dense, but not as much as I like the lower calories.  Of course, I made up for it by adding 1/4 cup of chocolate chips.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and a splash of cinnamon.

I switched a lot in the recipe, but it was still delicious! First, I used 1/2 cup white whole wheat flour and 1 cup regular flour; I used brown sugar instead of white sugar; I mashed up two extra bananas instead of the melted butter; and I added nutmeg and cinnamon! Plus, I added about 1/4 cup pecan meal. But they were great! A solid recipe!

My first review, which I removed, only gave these 3 stars but after these cooled and sat overnight, they were spectacular. I really couldn't taste a strong banana flavor when they were hot out of the oven, but that changed once they sat. I just made another tin full tonight to use up the rest of my bananas. Thanks for a great recipe. Will use over and over again! :)

I made this with gluten free rice flour (you need to add a little more baking powder).  And I did substitute a little brown sugar for some sugar, used pure cane sugar too.  Also added a teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon.  THEY ARE FANTASTIC!!

Fantastic!!  Added 1/2 cup mini choc chips which did not alter perfect texture. Made 13 muffins.

I loved these! I read all the "bad" reviews first and have concluded that the bakers either a) mixed the batter TOO much, b) added too many extras like cinnamon and vanilla, or c) all of the above. I made two batches: regular (as written) and toasted coconut and toasted walnuts to batch number two. Both were fabulous :) I used almost black bananas, no cinnamon, no vanilla and they were very banana-y.

These were great. I love that this recipe is so simple, with on-hand ingredients. I actually only had 1 extremely over-ripe banana, so I added in 2 nectarines (in place of 2 more bananas) that had also seen better days. Since the fruit overall was SO ripe, I cut back the sugar to just 1/2 cup, fearing it might be too sweet...and I found it to be just right. Otherwise, everything stayed the same. I had 1 right out of the oven...it was so good. Then I simply had to have another with a cup of tea immediately after LOL. I'm doing my best to not have a third! What a delightful recipe...will make this one again!

So good!  I made a few adjustments per the reviews I read.  I made a half batch since I only had 2 bananas.  I used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla and a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  You can't taste the vanilla or cinnamon, but they make the banana flavor really pop!  I used half whole wheat flour and half unbleached all purpose too.  I will be making again for sure :)

This recipe is a great way to use a few over-ripe bananas. I did make a few adjustments to the recipe. I added a few drops of pure vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon. I also substituted the butter with cinnamon applesauce and cut down on the sugar. At the end I topped the muffins with finely chopped walnuts. The muffins turned out really moist. I will definitely make these muffins again!

These are the best banana muffins I have ever made! I added some chopped pecans and a splash of vanilla. I also topped them with brown sugar cream cheese frosting. My husband and I couldn't get enough. They were gone in 2 days!! I am definately looking forward to making them again!

Excellent with no changes!  I even ran out of all purpose flour so had to sub 1/2 cup with whole wheat and it was awesome!  The toddlers loved them.  Thank you.

I followed the general recipe but used 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar and added 1 t. vanilla.  Very moist and tastes like banana bread!  Will use this recipe again.  Best banana muffin recipe I've found!  Thanks ABI_GODFREY

You can't really get much easier than these.  Simple ingredients, no fancy mixing, and they turned out great.  Moist with lots of banana flavor.  Great way to use up those overripe bananas.

Delicious, Very easy to make.  I used applesauce instead of butter (making it dairy-free), and used a little less sugar.  I added a dash of vanilla and cinnamon.

I used 4 bananas (instead of 3), 1 cup of sugar (instead of 3/4 c), and added some cinnamon, a splash of vanilla, and about 1/3 cup of fat free vanilla yogurt. I also threw in 1/2 a bag of chocolate chips. They were excellent and I'll definitely be making these again!

These turned out awesome, and I used a gluten-free flour blend and exchanged the butter for equal parts of oil and applesauce.  I also added dairy-free chocolate chips and they turned out perfectly moist and amazing!  My kids chowed them down and are asking me to make them again.

I've made these at least 12 times now and they're amazing.  I've even used the same recipe, but with strawberries instead... sometimes strawberries AND bananas.  I use it every time I have a lot of fruit that won't get eaten before it spoils.  Sometimes I substitute applesauce for a banana.  Very easy, very flavorful, moist... perfect muffins every time!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is a very banana-y muffin.  Delicious.  As per other reviewers, I added about 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 cup walnuts, and did half brown sugar/half white.  Because you can never have too much butter and sugar in a muffin, I also added a streusel topping.  I'll be making these again for sure.

These are absolutely the BEST banana muffins I have ever eaten. I used whole wheat flour and I added a dash of vanilla. And I used 3 super ripe bananas. I kept them until the outer skin started turning black, then refrigerated to prevent them from getting mushy. My muffins took 28 minutes at 350 degrees to be perfect. They were golden brown and so moist, sweet and delicious! Do not mash the bananas too much if you want visible bits of banana in your muffins. I also sifted the dry ingredients and I didn't overmix. Wonderful, wonderful, WONDERFUL!!!

I have been searching for *the* banana muffin and I have found it in this recipe! My 2 year old and I made a batch today and all I can say is *WoW*!! 

I did a little modification. I added:
-1/2 tsp vanilla extract
-1 tsp. cinnamon
-1/2 cup chopped walnuts
-1/2 cup shredded coconut

Even without the extras, I am sure this is a winner! You won't be disappointed with this one :o)

The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because it does not include vanilla or cinnamon.  After adding those two ingredients this recipe is perfect!

This recipe is AWESOME!!! I added 1/2 c chocolate chips, 1/3 c walnuts, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and sprinkled brown sugar on top. I also used 1/2 wh sugar & 1/2 br sugar in the recipe. I also followed the advice on NOT mixing the dry & wet ingredients too much, in order to keep the muffins moist. Will definitely make these again!

I made this according to the recipe.  They were great.  I will definitely be making them again.  I made them in the large muffin tin and it yielded 6 muffins.  They were especially good the next day--you could really taste the banana in them.

Loved these! I made mini muffins for a preschool function and they were great. I made them the night before & tested them when they were warm - not too impressed. I was very pleased the next day, though. They're much better after they're fully cooled.

Very very good!  I added a bit of vanilla extract and cinnimon as another reviewer recommended and they came out so yummy!!!  I have to add though, that regular sized muffins only cooked for 20min at 375, or 15 min at 350, and they came out perfect.  It also makes more than 12, which I'm thankful for!  I made 20 regular sized muffins with the 12muffin recipe.

One of the best banana muffin recipes that I have found without nuts!  Moist, perfect consistency, great taste.  All four of my kids love these.  One hint:  Leave the batter set for 5-10 minutes before putting it into the muffin tins.  It is much easier to spoon in, not as runny as right after mixing!  Also, the perfect batter consistency (if you let it set) to put into a baggie and pipe into mini muffin tins!

These are really good!  I like that all the ingredients are things I always have on hand.  I only baked them for 20 minutes- any more and they would have been less than perfect.

I made these at work this morning, they were great!  I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg as suggested by other reviewers.  They had a nice crispy top and were very moist.  Great way to use up old bananas.

Very moist and very yummy! I'm a really big fan of crusty muffin tops so I used this recipe to make 10 muffins with big crusty tops, instead of 12 as suggested by the recipe (I might make 9 next time for bigger crusty tops). I didn't have any chocolate chips, as suggested by others, so I chopped up 100 grams of Cadbury dark cooking chocolate instead. Very yummy, and surprising quite light as well. Will definitely make it again.

I've made these muffins well over a dozen times.  They turn out awesome each time!  Sometimes I add a dash of vanilla or a few chopped walnuts.  
They are a new favorite and are always a hit!

I was disappointed by this recipe. It really needs more bananas. They turned out moist but bland. It is a good base for a moist muffin but next time I will add vanilla, cinnamon and extra bananas.

great muffins.  I added vanilla and nutmeg only because we love these favors.  I also had small bananas and should have added an extra one because of the size.

I sprayed oil and powdered bottom of each tin with flour.  They simply "fell out" when I turned the pan upside down! Clean up will be very easy.

Wow! I'm not usually a banana fan, but we found this to be the best recipe to use those quickly ripening bananas! I'm editing my review after 3 yrs of this being my favorite banana muffin recipe "as is" because over the years I've made a few changes to make it healthier...as suggested in other reviews I substituted applesauce-when I have it for the butter and use the butter Pam spray for the muffin pans for the flavor.  Also, the recipe seems fairly forgiving if I only have 2 bananas or 4.  I've also been able to exchange wheat flour and oat bran for the all purpose flour.  Although I do love cinnamon, this recipe is great whether it's added or not! The best thing I like about using this recipe is that I can make it into mini muffins and it's even quicker than the 25 min cooking time!Thank you so much, Abi!

Great recipe!  I used two bananas + about 1/3 - 1/2 cup of applesauce.  We also added tsp vanilla, tsp cinnamon, a little nutmeg and about a TBSP of spiced rum.  After putting the batter in we sprinkled granola & a little extra sugar on top.

Great recipe.  My husband loved them and he's super picky.

Awesome banana muffins!  I added a 4th banana, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp baking powder, and used Splenda instead of sugar.  Turned out great for breakfast!!

WOW! so very good!
I changed the recipe a little. I used 100% whole wheat flour instead of white and added 1 tsp of cinnimon. I didn't mash my bananas to mush because i like the little banana chunks in the muffin, and I made 6 jumbo muffins instead of 12 regular muffins.  I baked them at the desired temp. for 25 minutes in my oven and they turned out beautiful. My Husband and I just love them, and the whole wheat flour did not dry them out.  I added a sprinkle of walnuts on top before I baked them and they were just perfect.  I am going to make three batches next time and freeze them for when ever we want them. They didn't last long.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I made mini muffins for a brunch I hosted at my home. They were excellent. Per others' suggestions I added vanilla and cinnamon. I also sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top before baking as one reviewer suggested and it really made the muffins look nice and taste great! Be aware this is a very moist muffin and is sticky by the next day, so maybe not the best for guests, but I will definitely be making this again for my family.

I'm not sure what went wrong but the muffins didn't come out as moist and delicious as I expected.  They were quite hard actually and stuck to the paper.  I followed the recipe except for these slight changes:  I decreased the sugar from 3/4 to half a cup, replaced the butter with applesauce, and added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  And I decreased the baking time to 20 minutes (instead of the recommended 25-30 minutes).  But these changes (except for maybe the butter replacement) shouldn't have made the muffins so hard and dry.  So I'm wondering what happened.  Anyway, I was disappointed with the outcome...

Thank you Abi for this recipe. My son and I both enjoyed eating these moist muffins. I did add 1/2 cup of chocolate chips for my son and 1 tsp of vanilla. Very good!

Good muffins...
As suggested in other reviews, I added vanilla, chocolate chips (just enough to get the kids to eat them), and used half white, half brown sugar.
And don't over mix the batter! Thx Abi

Great recipe. I did make a few mods. I used 1/2 c whole wheat flour and the rest white. I used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar. It was plenty sweet for me. I even think you could use less sugar than that. I blended together until moist. I agree, too much mixing is not good. I only had 9 muffins and baked them for 20 min in my oven.

I absolutely love this recipe, its so simple to make and  my family goes nuts for it! The recipe is perfect the way it is but what I add is 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract and 1 cup of chopped nuts, I used pecans since they have a nice flavor that works with many ingredients, but of course you can use any nut of your choice. :)

I love this recipe.  It is great just as is.  I have also added many things to it to make more of a dessert.  Half brown sugar, half white sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, any fresh or frozen fruit I feel like throwing in and chocolate chips.  Throw it in a bunt or cake pan and you have dessert!

With the addition of vanilla and chopped walnuts and baking 22 mins. this is a 5-star.  Picked this recipe because muffins are quicker and freeze better than banana bread.  As with any muffin recipe the directions should say to mix just until the flour is incorporated, not "mix until smooth."

I pretty much only added pecans and they turned out great.. Personally I like them softer on the outside so I wasn't a big fan of this recipe but they were a hit with the family! The only thing I would say is to bake the big muffins for 15-20 mins instead of 25-30. The first batch I made were a little burnt and I baked them for 26-27ish mins on 350.

I just tried this one today and it worked out incredibly well. I didn't opt for any replacements and simply mixed the dry ingredients first and then slowly added in everything else. I also let the mixture sit for a while before putting it into the oven which helped it's overall consistency.

It's moist like a muffin should be, I would give it five star if it wasn't bland, like a little bit sweet and a little banana flavor muffin, 3 star is ok.

Followed the ingredients exactly.  I was too lazy to get out the electric mixer so I did it by hand.  From other reviews (read afterwards) my laziness paid off.  They were so moist and delicious I'm getting rid of my old recipe and keeping this in its place.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

These muffins have the perfect crackly top with a tender, moist crumb inside. They rise up and brown beautifully. Check your oven early; mine were done in 18 minutes instead of 20. I only had two bananas but they were very large, so still worked out well. My kids helped and we whipped these up in no time for breakfast this morning. Definitely a keeper!

Good way to use up over-ripe bananas. Really easy - added a little vanilla and chopped up a Hershey bar and threw it in before baking...so good I ate 4 today! OOOOOPS!

Great recipe. I might try adding cinnamon next time, but so delicious on its own. Very easy and quick to make, I made it as a before-bed snack!

I used the applesauce & added cinnamon as others suggested then added toasted walnuts and chia seeds for a protein/ omega-3 boost. Really yummy!

This recipe is great, as is! Of course, do not overmix and they're perfectly moist and fluffy. I only had two bananas today so I subbed in a food pouch of apple, squash, and carrot. I also used half brown sugar and half white, added a couple drops of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. My toddler loves them and so do I. (And I don't even like bananas!)

This is such a great recipe! The only thing is I changed white sugar to light brown sugar, and added a teaspoon of both cinnamon and vanilla, to give it a flavor boost. Other than that five stars!

These turned out terribly.  It seems like there was too much rising agent.  1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda 1 egg, doesn't sound unreasonable but something was off.  I did put in an extra banana because I used the small ones, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. They looked really nice, with an impressive 'muffin top' but alas . .

Delicious! Moist and fluffy like a good muffin should be. These are sweet enough to be cupcakes. I followed the recipe exactly and added maple pecans. In my oven they took only 20 minutes to bake - keep an eye on them so as not to overcook (I made the regular sized muffins, not the mini).

These are superb. I used 3 bananas, but they were more like medium size. Instead of 3/4c. white sugar I used a slightly rounded, but packed, 1/2c. brown sugar. Perfectly done at 20min.

I made this today for the first time and it was a huge hit! I changed the recipe to be vegan (1/4 cup oil and 1/3 cup applesauce instead of egg and butter) and it came out perfect!!

Fantastic muffins!  I had four over ripe bananas, so I used the extra banana.   Not having enough butter, I took a chance and used 1/2 a stick.  Didn’t mix more or less than I would any other muffin batter.  The result; lovely light, very banana flavored muffins that my family raved about.  Thank you for sharing this five star recipe!

This is a very easy recipe and I made it GLUTEN-FREE with just two small changes. I used 1.5 cups of Bob's Red Mill all-purpose baking flour and added 1.5 teaspoons of xanthan gum.

This is the BEST banana muffin recipe ever. Usually when I make banana bread or muffins, they turn out goopy inside, but these were perfect. They're moist and so, so soft inside. I added about 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon, walnuts and a brown sugar crumb topping, but I'm sure they would've tasted amazing without them.

Wonderful recipe - perfect proportions to make it tender and moist! I substituted brown sugar Splenda for the sugar, applesauce for half the butter & oil for the rest, and half whole wheat flour. So good, a great treat for a healthy lower calorie snack or breakfast! Thanks for this recipe!

only change I made was adding a dash of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. I'm sure these would have been amazing without it, but after reading other reviews it just sounded so yummy! We didn't add nuts, but next time I think I will. Easy and delicious!

D E L I C I O U S!!  They just came out of the oven, and I couldn't wait until morning to have one.  I did like some others recommended and added some cinnamon & nutmeg.  I was out of vanilla, so I used some almond extract.  I also used 1C white flour and 1/2C whole wheat flour, and reduced the sugar to 1/2C.  Then I added some fresh blueberries.  So I guess I sort of made my own recipe, but this was a great springboard!

Did a healthier version of these and they turned out great!  I replaced one cup of the flour with whole wheat, didn't use any butter, and reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup.  I pureed the really, really ripe bananas in a food processor because I like the texture of banana baked goods better that way.

These are maybe the best muffins I have ever made.  The idea of folding the dry ingredients into the wet was new to me, but made all of the difference in taste and texture.  Will definitely be making these again and maybe trying the applesauce version that some reviewers suggested for calorie sake.

This recipe is so simple and it came out GREAT.   I've made a lot of muffins and some are so complicated and come out dry or bland.  These had a ton of flavor were amazingly moist and had great flavor.  I used unrefined sugar and added mini chocolate chips. Quick, easy and good!

Perfect, fluffy, moist muffins, better than any banana bread recipe I have found. I use equal parts brown and white sugar and also for the flour use equal parts whole wheat and all purpose flour. I add about a tsp of vanilla and a good amount of cinnamon. Yum!

I added just a touch of vanilla and ground cinnamon. I also had some golden raisins in the pantry, so I added a few of those. Good texture and cook time was right on the money.

I made these as mini-muffins for my grand-children and they loved them. I followed the recipe exactlly.
 The second time I followed the recipe exactly, except I used  bread flour, and they were even better.  It gave  a nice fluffy texture to
them.  They were gone in a flash, so I will have to double the recipe next time.

Super easy...I don't even have to look at the recipe anymore.  My kids ask for these almost everyday.  It"s a great recipe.  You can change it up with just about anything you have on hand.  I've used blueberries, strawberries, chocolate chips, peanut butter and even nutella.  They have always turned out great.

To make this recipe even healthier, sub the butter with applesauce and 2 tbs of oil. Since applesauce is naturally sweet, you can cut a little bit of sugar out, the amount depends on taste. You can also use whole wheat flour.

My kids cannot get enough of these muffins! Make sure you fold the batter until just mixed and they will be light, fluffy and moist. I did try adding coconut and pineapple which made a fabulous muffin even better.

I made this recipe a week or two ago...super easy, quick, and delicious!  I am Gluten Free (GF) and I was a bit fearful the banana would not cover the "off" taste of GF flour, but it did a pretty good job of it.  Like others I added in 1 tsp cinnamon to the dry ingredients, as well as 1 tsp vanilla and 1/3 cup chopped walnuts.  Delicious!  For left overs, I recommend any one making these GF to warm up the muffin...when eating cold I could taste the GF flour more easily (not as pleasant).

This was my first time ever making muffins, I just knew I really wanted a muffin that would use up my too ripe bananas.  I did not follow the recipe exactly because I didn't have all of the ingredients.  Instead of all purpose flour I used wheat flour, I didn't have any baking soda so I doubled the baking powder, and I probably put in too much sugar.  With all of my "changes" the muffins were still AMAZING. They weren't as pretty (it could be because I overfilled my muffin cups or b/c I didn't have baking soda) but I've learned to "never judge a book by it's cover."

I made this in an 8X8 square pan and added a tsp of vanilla and worked out great!  Yummy.  I used 3 medium bananas. If using a pan instead of muffin tins, it takes about 42 minutes to bake.  Mix by hand and didn't melt the butter (room temp).

These Muffins were excellent!!!

Very moist and very fragrant.

What I did differently was add a teaspoon of Vanilla Extract which gave it a very nice punch, and used 2/3 cups of white sugar (instead of 1/2). 1/4 teaspoons of salt, and 2 eggs (whipped w/ beater). 

Needless to say, they came out perfectly sweet and extremely fluffy. Definitely a recipe I'll be repeating...

Very disappointed considering all the rave reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and got a very bland muffin. If I were to make these again I would follow other's suggestions of adding cinammon and nutmeg and maybe another banana or two. The flavor was very muted.

Quite the yummy treat!! Here's something though: We just so happened to be out out baking powder, but not to worry... We just used 4 teaspoons of baking soda and omitted the salt to even things out. Everyhing turned out quite nicely and they taste even better than they smell in the oven! ;)

Everyone in my house LOVES these muffins. I have lost count of the amount I have made in the past month ! I have found that the riper the banana the better it taste and 1/2 cup of sugar will do. I also use salted butter and leave out the salt...thank you sooooo much for this recipe !

I loved these muffins, I took heed of the other reviews and mixed the batter only slightly and the muffins were very moist and not heavy.  I added a tspn of vanilla to mine. I also added a streusel topping made with brown sugar, flour, butter and a diced up banana. These are awesome muffins!

Loved this!  I used frozen bananas, cut off one end, microwaved for 2 minutes, then squeezed them out. Also i used vegan becel and vegan choc chips because I have a dairy allergy, added a dask of cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla - and they still worked awesome!

This was a delicious and simple recipe. My family loved these muffins! I was out of butter so I substituted oil for the butter and everything turned out great! I will keep this recipe.

These muffins are really easy and make a nice moist muffin. I made the with my two year old and she had a blast.  We made them exactly according to recipe. Next time I'll add cinnamon/nutmeg/vanilla.

This recipe is delicious with cinnamon and vanilla added. I also add some walnuts. I agree with others that it only took about 20 minutes for a dozen of full size muffins so watch them in the oven!

These are great. I made them slightly healthier by using 1/3 whole wheat flour and decreasing the sugar slightly. Added a touch of vanilla and cinnamon for more oomph.

Fabulous recipe!  Tasty and so easy to make!  I do suggest using frozen (and thawed) bananas, they do come out a little moister, but fabulous nontheless!

I made mine into Black Bottom Muffins by adding about 1/2 T of cocoa powder to 1/3 of the batter and putting that on the bottom with regular batter on top. They turned out so great! The tops are crispy and the inside moist and so so perfect. Love it!

Easily altered for allergy prone folks.  Delicious!  I used the standard ground flaxseed and water in place of the egg.  I also used Earth Balance margarine instead of butter.  THese really are easy enough for my 7 yr old to make AND the are DELCIOUS!

I made mini muffins, it took me about 8-10 mins. I would reduce the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup. I added cinnamon as suggessted by others. Otherwise it is a perfect recipe. 4 Stars for ease of following, i would've given it a 5 but it is a little too sweet for my liking. Will try it again with whole wheat flour and less sugar.

Followed the recipe exactly and added just a splash or two of vanilla extract.  WONDERFUL!  Just the right amount of sweet, great texture, and the muffin tops baked up perfectly.  I agree that you want to be careful to not over mix.  Fold in dry ingredients until just combined.  Everyone, from my 2 year old to my husband, loved these!

The recipe made 6 large muffins.  I added a pinch of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of walnuts.  I used 2 bananas intead of 3 and they came out with just a hint of banana flavor.  Next time I'll make it with 3.

I switched some ingredients to make them a bit healthier and they still tasted great! Did half whole wheat flour half white flour, added 1/4 cup ground flax and replaced the butter with unsweetened applesauce. A great way to use up those overripe bananas!

Only used 2 bananas because that's all I had, and it still turned out great. Used 1 c whole wheat flour, 1/2 c all purpose flour, added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla, and used half white sugar half brown sugar.

I made these and they smelled so good but when I ate one, about 10 minutes later I had the strongest baking powder after-taste. My husband wouldn't even eat another one. He eats pretty much anything (except for an attempt a salisbury steak make with ground chicken). I threw the rest away and will never make these again. I gave it 2 stars because they were really moist and a great consistency for muffins.

Great muffins! I did the same as some others by adding 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon. I also switched to whole wheat flour, decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup, and substituted apple sauce for the butter. I add one tbsp of butter just to give it some of that flavor/texture and then they dont get to sticky chewy. Also I used 4 bananas, but only because I pulled them out before I looked for a recipe. They were amazing and super moist! Thanks!

I have made these many, many times and it is now my family's favorite over banana bread.  The last time I made them I had three little bags of chocolate chips that needed using up and a small bit of peanut butter chips, these all went into the batter!  YUM, my kid's were loving these!  I think this recipe has replaced my standard banana bread recipe!  I also add a tsp of vanilla, but it's decent without.

So quick and easy and soooo good, even though I mixed the sugar in with the other dry ingredients instead of with the wet ingredients by mistake.  I did add a little vanilla and cinnamon.  Definitely a keeper!

Excellent! Very moist. I made 5 jumbo muffins. I added 1 tsp of vanilla, next time I will probably experiment with additional add ins such as chocolate chips or walnuts or almonds... Thank you for a great new recipe!

these muffins were awesome!  I substituted 1/2c brown sugar for the white sugar, added some cinnamon and baked for 20 minutes.  They came out so moist and the butter adds great flavor.

Loved this recipe!  Very simple to make and my daughter was able to help as well!  I did make some adjustments - little bit of vanilla and cinnamon like others had mentioned and then used 1/3 cup apple sauce instead of butter!

This recipes is a great base. I gave it 4 stars because without the addition of spices and an extra banana, they would have been bland.  Thanks for sharing!

Fabulous! I make these every week with my 2 year old son. We always add a variety of extras, nuts, rasins, mixed spice, cinnamon etc what ever is to hand, but the basic recipe is excellent and we take advantage of the metric conversion and serving size adjuster. 5 stars!

Followed the recipe almost to the t... except that we always use olive oil instead of butters or shortenings, and I always use an extra naner. :) The muffins turned out wonderfully!

I did change it a bit, I used 1/2 cup WW flour and 1 cup AP, then instead of butter I used a 4 oz container of cinnamon applesauce, and for my sugar I did 1/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup regular. Only had 2 bananas and that worked out great. I also fold in some chocolate chips at the end to get my picky eaters to devour these great muffins!  While I did tweak it, the basic is great and i will definitely use it again! I did mini muffins which took about 12 minutes.

These are the BEST OMG I have already eaten 3 of them and I just made them a few hours ago!  I did as suggested and put 1 tsp of vanilla in and I think that enhances the banana taste.  My oven cooks hot so I only cooked for 20 mins and they were perfect and they looked better than anything I have bought in the bakery!

Very simple and reliable recipe.  I usually add 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips to mine.  I've started experimenting with reducing the butter and sugar a little and have had good results.  I use 1/4 cup butter and 2/3 cup sugar and they still turn out great.  Mine almost always take only 20 minutes in the oven though.

Lovedd, Loved, Loved this recipe!!  Easy and delicious!!  Husband loved them, kids loved them.  Made few differnt muffins!    I added cinnamon and vanilla to once batch, chocolate chips to another, and walnuts chopped up to another.  And they are ALL gone.  Husband came home today with a bag full of over ripe bananas from the grocery store and a new extra large muffin tin.  Is he trying to tell me something?

I made some "healthy" changes and these turned out WONDERFUL!!!  I used 100% spelt flour instead of all-purpose flour. And I used a skimp 1/2 cup honey instead of the sugar. I used only a 1/4 cup butter to balance the extra moisture from the honey.   They get darker sooner but wait until they "bounce back" when touching to see if they are done.

These are really, really good. For my second batch I added walnuts, substituted 1/4c brown sugar for white, and added a dash of cinnamon. Note that the batter comes out pretty sticky and it takes some patience to get it cleanly into the muffin pan. But the finished product is beautiful, moist & delicious!

I made these yesterday, followed the recipe exactly.  The muffins are outstanding!  They are very moist, but not too moist, light and flavorful.  Don't stir the dry ingredients too much; I folded mine in with a spatula until just moistened.  This will definitely be used again.

My son was home for the weekend and requested banana muffins.  I quickly threw this recipe together and they were a huge hit.  Quick and easy to make, banana flavor was very strong.  They were light and moist as can be.  I folded the dry ingredients in just till dampened and did have to bake an extra 10 minutes to make them golden brown on top.  Will definitely make these again!!

I am not a fan of muffins, but these are yummie!  My 7 yr old loves them!  i tweaked them like everyone suggested:  used 1 tsp of cinnamon & vanilla and added about 3/4 cp of mini chocolate chips.  Great way to use up ripe bananas!

Excellent!  I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the butter, added a tablespoon of flax seed (mixed in with the flour), and cinnamon & nutmeg.  I know some people don't think you should rate a recipe if you've toyed with it - I think as long as you keep the basic recipe, and you are able to tweak it for your own taste,  that makes the original recipe all the better!

These are delicious!!  I cut the sugar to 1/2 a cup and added vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.  We use smart balance for butter and oat flour.  I topped a few off with chocolate chips for my step daughter.  She doesn't like much (very picky) and she loved these!!  Adding this to my rotation!!

These are phenomenal. I would not buy a banana muffin from a store now that I know I can make them just as good or even better than what you can find at a cafe for $2!  I have been freezing mashed ripe bananas for a couple weeks now, and finally decided to make some banana bread. I decided muffins would be easier to handle for reheating, etc., and decided this recipe sounded great. I made only a few minor changes to the recipe as written:  - added 1/8 tsp. of ground cinnamon - added a dash of ground nutmeg - substituted 1/8 cup of Splenda brown sugar blend for 1/4 cup of the sugar - added a few chopped almonds to the mix and a few sliced almonds to the top for crunch and presentation  I'd say the changes were great. I especially love the sliced almonds on top! So yummy.... I will definitely make these again.

These are amazing!  Made the recipe exactly as-is.  While it's true that they don't rise much, but preheating the oven at 375 and then turning the temp down to 350 when they went in, I was able to make them rise somewhat and without a flat top.

These muffins came out very moist and delicious! My husband and I both enjoyed them. I made a few additions to the recipe which were adding 1 tsp. each cinnamon and vanilla extract as well as 2/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. Will definitely make these again.

I thought this recipe was very easy and that the muffins came out great.  I meant to add some vanilla...and forgot!  For a simple, quick and easy banana muffin...this one is it!

Absolutely delicious! This is a fantastic recipe! I did add a couple of things to it, but that was all like icing on the cake. I put it some cinnamon, nutmeg, and just a splash of vanilla. When mixing the dry and wet ingredients together, only beat enough for all of the dry stuff to get wet. They turn out fantastic! Will definitely make them again and again!

Wonderful banana muffin....using a previous baker's recommendations, I added cinnamon and vanilla, used unsweetened applesauce instead of the butter, and decreased the sugar to 1/2 C and these came out GREAT!  Excellent for grab-n-go snacks or lunches!

These were delicious. I only used 2 bananas, and I added about 1 cup of chopped apple slices just for the fun of it. The apple-banana favor is great! Also added cinnamon and vanilla like others suggested. Not sure if it made any difference, though. I also sprinkled Sugar in the Raw on the tops of them before baking. Yum.

AMAZING RECIPE! Made as written + 1 TB cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp allspice, 1/8 tsp cardamom. Also, I did not melt the butter (used softened butter at room temp). I used 4 medium bananas instead of 3 large bananas, and the banana flavor REALLY popped. Muffins were puffy, gorgeous, and delicious. Highly recommend. Side note, my muffins (full-sized, not mini) only took 17 minutes to bake ... my oven temp is probably off, but keep an eye on these because they might be ready sooner than you think.

these came out AMAZING. this was my first time making these and i'm really proud of mysel; these could rival my mother's! :D. i followed the receipe exactly (i'm not experienced enough to add my own twist) and they came out perfect. they were done 10 minutes earlier than the the time stated, so i would suggest to check on it after 20 minutes.

These were very good.  Took the advice of others and used part brown sugar and part white sugar, added some cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla (didn't measure....just eyeballed it).  Also, I added blueberries which added SO much to the recipe.  They are SUPER easy to make.

Couldn't have been easier. Made exactly as written. The KEY is to NOT over stir the batter. Just incorporate, fill the muffin tins and bake!

Very good muffins. I replaced half the butter with applesauce and added a little spice and nuts and they turned out grea. However, do not eat hot out of the oven. They taste much better after cooling!

a great recipe!!  The results from my high school students were amazing!  We tested a few of the reviewers comments: added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon-these were more tasty but less of a banana flavor; using stand mixer to mix instead of by hand turned out more dry and didn't rise as much; adding nuts gave it more texture; 1/8 t cinnamon & 1/8 t nutmeg & walnuts  and stirring was the favorite of the class-more flavor, texture, but still a great banana flavor.

I didn't like these at all.  They didn't have much flavor.  Next time I'll just use a banana bread recipe and bake in muffin tins.

Added 1 TSP vanilla extract to bring out the banana flavor, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup chopped nuts and sprinkled the tops with cinnamon. They were very moist and flavorful. The recipe made exactly 12 good size muffins. I used my bananas that were about to expire. Thank you so much for this recipe! It was very easy to make and very fast too.

Loved it!  Easy and SO tasty.  I used 3/4 cup ap flour & 3/4 cup whole wheat flour.  Also, added 1 t of vanilla and about 1/2 cup of choc chips.  Next time I might try it with apple sauce instead of butter but they were great with the butter.

Excellent recipe.  I made two batches - the first batch was made exactly as the recipe was written.  Simple, easy and very quick!!  Five stars.  The second batch I used whole wheat flour instead of white and Splenda in place of sugar.  These were just as delicious as the 1st batch.  The recipe is easily coverted to your tastes:  add cinnamon, nuts, etc...

Awesome muffins.  Doubled the recipe figuring with four boys, they'd likely be gone as fast I could make them.  3/4 of the first dozen are gone before the 2nd dozen are in the oven.  Delicious banana flavour.  Nice and light, not as dense as a loaf.  Will be making these again soon, and have replaced my former favourite, "banana banana loaf" with this!

These turned out great for me ~ the "blacker" the bananas, the more flavor.  The only thing I did extra, was to throw in chocolate chips.  Thanks Abi!

Like others, I added about 1/4t nutmeg, 1t cinnamon, 1t vanilla, splenda for sugar, only 2 bananas, SmartBalance Omega 3 margarine, and whole wheat flour.  They smelled heavenly and tasted really good too.  They were kind of small and a bit dry but maybe that's due to the 3rd banana I didn't have or some of my substitutions.  These changes brought the calories down to 108 and fat to 1.4g each.  I'll definitely be making these again!

I'm always looking for uses for super-soft bananas, and these muffins are a great way to use them up. I had lots of bananas so I made a double batch and they are so delicious! Really simple and good with raspberry jam.

VERY good muffins. I added vanilla, cinnamon, walnuts and lemon juice. I agree with the other reviews about not using the mixer. I just used a masher and wisk to blend all the ingredients.

This was very easy and very good!  I followed the recipe with these changes: 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of ANY butter.  They only needed 25 minutes in a pre-heated oven.

Great recipe after some changes.  I added a dash of vanilla and probably about a cup of walnuts.  These weren't quite as big as I like, so I'll probably make 1.5x the recipe next time, so I get those nice pretty crowns that I love on my muffins.

Great muffins that my three year old and I made this morning.  Mix only until moistened, add a 1/2 cup of choco chips (these made the difference for me), replace 1/4 cup of white sugar with brown, and add a 1/2 tsp of vanila. Yummy.

I modified recipe for 1/2 the batch to use some cranberries I had leftover.  I boiled the cranberries until they started to pop then folded them into the batter.  I also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top of the muffins with the cranberries.  Yum!

These are great muffins. I used whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup splenda brown sugar mix. Added some vanilla and cinamon. Also dumped some left over blueberries in. also some crushed pecans.

They were very light and fluffy.. Made the small muffins. 24 to a tin.

Nice! I halved the recipe since there are only two of us but used 2 medium bananas than the 2 1/2 stated, I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/4tsp cinnamon, obviously would be double if I made the whole recipe.
I used a small muffin tin and it yielded 9. They are very nice and very basic. 
I had 2 ripe bananas and thought I should use them up so looked for a very basic recipe and found this one! Next time I'd add some chocolate chips or some nuts and maybe have a streusel topping since these aren't very sweet.
Overall a good recipe and great with a cup of coffee or tea. :)

My family loves these muffins!  I make exactly as the recipe reads but add 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 Tbsp milled flax seed.  The kids stand at the oven window waiting for them to bake - mini muffins disappear quickly.  Thanks for the recipe!

OH MY GOSH!  These muffins are exceptional!  I did change a couple of things like others suggested.  I used applesauce instead of butter (1/4 cup) and added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I have not had such good luck substituting applesauce for oil/butter in the past with other recipes, but this time it worked!  SO good...can't wait to make them again!

A family favorite from now on! In the past 3 months I've made these delicious moist muffins atleast 8 times. Don't be tempted to alter the recipe, these are perfect just the way they are.

Super Yummy Muffins – So Moist. I’ve made these several times now and they are just the best. We substituted the nuts with chocolate chips and added the 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon and ¼ tsp of nutmeg. For fluffy muffins, only mix the wet and dry ingredients until combined - moistened, don’t over stir or mix with a mixer. These have come out divine every time. This is now my go to recipe for banana muffins.

I am so happy with this recipe! I thought it was a little simple at first... but what a great result! Muffins develop there own crunchy top which is to die for, so don't bother topping them with anything! I added a little bit of nutmeg and vanilla, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Best hot, these muffins hit the spot. Trust that many more will be made. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

These muffins are really good!  I never bake often, and mine came out great.  I added a couple of things, but I think they would have been great without it, too: first, instead of 1/3 cup butter I put in 3 tablespoons peanutbutter and 2 tablespoons regular butter.  Also, I mixed in 1/3 cup granola and 1/2 cup walnuts at the end, and that makes a big difference. I can't wait to make them again!

Excellent and easy! I make these often. My method is to let the dry ingredients sit while I blend bananas, sugar, egg, and butter with a hand-held mixer. Once this is really smooth, I add a fourth banana broken into small chunks because I like having bits of banana I can taste. I also top the muffins with a streusel mixture before baking (1/2 C. white sugar, 1/3 C. flour, 1 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/4 C. butter---cut to resemble coarse crumbs). I always use overripe bananas since they're softer and their flavour is more pervasive, and when I mix the wet and dry ingredients, I stir only until they're just barely combined. They come out fluffy and soft and very banana-y every time.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I have made these muffins at least a dozen times with my 3 year old and they always turn out perfectly.  The only change I made is adding another very ripe banana.

MMmmmm...fresh, warm muffins on a cold winter day. Very forgiving base recipe. I used whole wheat flour instead of white, 1/4 cup canola oil instead of melted butter, and added 1tsp vanilla extract and a few handfuls of mini chocolate chips.  Because I used less oil, the batter was thick, so I added a splash of milk to thin it out a little. Yummy!

Excellent and easy! I substituted 1/3 cup vegetable oil for the melted butter and added about 1/4 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. I also added 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I individually wrapped them so we can just "grab and go". Thanks for a great recipe!

I made a low fat/low cal version.  I double the recipe and used 1 cup homemade applesauce in place of the butter and substituted Splenda for the sugar.  I added 2t each of vanilla and cinnamon.  They are so yummy.  I totalled the nutrition info and each muffin has 89 calories and only .6 grams of fat which is fantastic for a great muffin.

Great recipe my 7 month old loves bananas so these are perfect for her to learn to self feed! Followed others instructions and added 1/2 whole wheat flour and cut butter in half and used applesauce. These are a great muffin base!

Yum!  Like everyone else, I made slight changes: used a heaping half-cup of brown sugar instead of the white, added vanilla, and topped with a dash of cinnamon sugar.  The liquids steps were all done in the food processor!  Kept the butter as is, of course.

Just made these muffins.  So yummy, I made a few changes. I used half AP flour and half white wheat flour. 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the butter.  Added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  And just for fun added 1/2 cup mini choc chips.  My kids gobbled them up. I gobbled them up!  So fun. Thanks for a great basic banana muffin recipe that can easily be added too!

These muffins have become an old stand by for a quick breakfast with guests item.  I do add vanilla and cinnamon.  I often will freeze my bananas to save them for this recipe.  Then you don't have to mash the bananas.

These taste very plain, but that's a good thing! I added vanilla, like other reviewers mentioned, and its just the wholesome flavour of banana all the way. These are so yummy when they are warm.

These muffins are so good! I made a couple of minor alterations to the recipe - used 1 c of whole wheat flour and 1/2 c AP flour (instead of all AP), and added 1 tsp of vanilla. I made mini-muffins and added mini chocolate chips to half of the batter. Both the plain banana and the banana chocolate chip were super moist and delicious. The whole family loved them and they disappeared fast. This is by far the best banana muffin recipe I've ever tried. It's a keeper!

This recipes make the most delicious and moist muffins I have ever tasted.We are big muffin fans and I have tried several recipes and this is the best thus far.I added some honey and some cinnamon and some vanilla like some other reviews had said...and that just added more flavor,not that they need much doctor-ing! I have made these 2 times in the past week,the 1st was to try it and the 2nd time was to use up the bananas AND my family asked for more!!! 5 stars all the way.

Delicious banana muffins.  The only changes I made were to add 1 tsp of cinnimon and 1 tsp of vanilla.  I made mini muffins for my daughter's preschool class, and all the kids loved them.  Thanks for the recipe Abi!

These muffins are more cake like in texture and not "heavy" as banana muffins & breads usually are.  I substituted a heaping TBSP of sour cream in place of the egg, I do not eat eggs and they turned out every bit as good. Once the ingredients (sp?) are combined, quickly place them in the muffin tins/cups, and get them in the over.  This is one of our more favourite recipes.  Easy to make and once made are quickly consumed.  Thank You for sharing this.

I make these all the time - except I use one cup whole wheat flour and one cup regular flour. I also cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup as the whole wheat flour is naturally sweeter. With a little vanilla and some chopped walnuts, these muffins are great!

I love these muffins.  I did take the advice of a couple other "reviewers", though...added an extra banana, some cinnamon, vanilla, milk, and walnuts.  I also used only 1/2 cup white sugar & 1/4 cup brown sugar.  With the added bananas, & milk, they turned out VERY moist & had great banana flavor!

Awesome muffins - will make these again!  I made the mini muffins - used Splenda sugar blend instead of sugar.

9/12/12 - I added mini marshmallow, chocolate, and caramel bits to this today...YUMMY!  (I also added a tsp vanilla)

Yummy! These muffins are a mild banana muffin alternative for those who aren't crazy about BIG banana taste, but need to use up old bananas - great for "smushy banana" haters like my four-year old! ;o)  Very good.  Not sure where the "healthy" part of these muffins comes in, besides the banana.  There seems to be a lot of sugar, and no whole grain stuff.  The only advantage is the small amount of butter.... so I substituted 1c. w/w flour for white.  These are great topped with a few choc. chips for a special treat.  Thanks for the recipe! These will become a fav in our house, especially for after-school snacks.

the muffins were delicious and moist.  the only modifications I made was I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg like another cook suggested.  I also used unrefined sugar instead of white sugar and I made 6 jumbo muffins.  I baked them for the full 30 min.  They were wonderful!  I will definately make these again!

This was a fantastic recipe, but of course I made a few adjustments: I used 1 C white flour + 1/2 C wheat flour, split the sugar into part white sugar + part packed brown sugar, and instead of butter I used almost entirely unsweetened applesauce and topped it off with about 1 TBS of Enova oil.  To the batter I also added about 3/4 C of raisins, and about 1 TBS of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  Once muffin tins were filled, I sprinkled a few more raisins on top, along with toasted coconut for a little crunch.  Baked for 30 minutes.  They were DELICIOUS (and perhaps a little healthier, too!)  One last note: I was taught that using an electric mixer with muffin batter is a no-no because it overblends the batter and makes it too chewy or rubbery.  All you need is a sturdy spatula to mix everything just until evenly moistened.  Just be sure your wet ingredients are well-blended first.  Perfect!

These were good but not enough banana flavor, perhaps mine weren't ripe enough.  They were very moist and very easy to prepare.  I like that they are low in fat.

This recipe was really good...I found the batter a bit thicker than I am used to, but that didn't seem to affect the final outcome.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla, and I also added chocolate chips simply because my daughter loves them. Once I filled the baking cups, I sprinkled chocolate chips on top of the batter as well - this looks decorative, and eliminates the need for any icing/spread.

Delicious.  A real hit!  I always make them with whole wheat flour and add a handful of chocoalte chips.  Adding an extra 1/2 banana gives a better flavor.  Fabulous and healthy as mini muffins for kid's snacks.

These muffins are great!!  I added 1tsp vanilla, 1tsp cinnamon and some mini chocolate chips.  I used 4 small to medium bananas but I think 5 would have been better.  My 2 year old loves them!!

Delicious and easy!  I did make changes..substituted ww flour for 1/2 cup of ap flour; decreased sugar to 1/2 cup; added 1/2 t cinnamon and 1/4 cloves; used canola oil instead of butter (daughter is allergic to dairy) and upped salt to 3/4 t.  Also added 1/2 cup pecans chopped fine, and 1/4 cup applesauce since the nuts would make it more dry.  Yum, yum, yum!!!!

Yummy!  A quick solution to those leftover bananas that are turning brown on the countertop.  I made them with Splenda instead of sugar.  I also took another reviewer's advice and added cinnamon and sprinkled the tops with Splenda before baking.  All dozen were devoured by the hubby and kids within an hour of baking.  This one is a keeper.

For noobs (like myself), this is an awesomely simple but beautiful recipe!  I wanted to make the bakery styled exploding top muffins.  So I preheated the oven to 425, coated the pan with lots of non-stick spray.  Then, I just followed directions.  Beat the wet stuff in on high, and hand stir the dry stuff until mixture is lumpy.  (I snuck in some chocolate chips and almond slices here... not so healthy anymore... >.

Very good, but recipe can be made even better if you only use 1/2 the flour and use Quaker oats for the other half--you'll find a better textured muffin and it's healthy!!!!  Also added vanilla and cinnamon and mini choc.chips for added flavor.  A winner all around!

These muffins were very easy to make and stayed fresh for a number of days.  Everyone raved about them!  I also changed the sugar amount - 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Added some vanilla as well.  I did forgot to add the cinnamon as previous raters had mentioned, and will do that next time.  Thanks for a great recipe, which I will continue to use!

2/19/2006: I made these as written, and also with alterations. They were moist & delicious either way. When I altered them, I used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 cup melted butter, baked for 23 minutes. I will absolutely make these again, probably with the addition of pecans. UPDATE: 5/26/2006 Made them again, adding a cup of Reese's Peanut Butter Chips.

I don't want to make those muffins again, they are too addictive!  Wow, this is absolutely the BEST banana muffins I've ever made/had.  After the muffins are baked, they are slightly crunchy on the top.  Yum!

I preheated my oven to 375°F and baked the muffins for about 20 minutes and they came out fantastic, the best muffins I have ever baked. I made them even better by adding 1/2 to 2/3 cup miniature chocolate chips into the batter. Thanks a lot for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

Made this in a loaf pan instead of muffins, was good, but need to lower temp to 300 - 325 when doing that.  Also, be sure to add 1t cinnamon and 1t vanilla..3/4 c nuts also good (pecans)

I tried this recipe for the first time yesterday and I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful results.  I followed some of the recommendations: 1/2 cup of brown sugar + 1/4 cup of white sugar and added 1 tsp vanilla essence.  Instead of butter, I used vegetable oil.  The muffins were so soft and yummy.  Thanks for the recipe, Abi.

These muffins were absolutely delicious and moist.  I took other reviewers' suggestions and added cinnamon and vanilla.  I also decreased the sugar a little since my bananas were very ripe.  Definitely a recipe to keep and make over and over again.

These muffins were easy to make, take my suggestion add a dash of cinnamon n a teaspoon of vanilla, could have been sweeter as well, when muffins are hot add some granulated sugar on the top, just a dash for more sweetness, but I would definatley use this again, So thanks! :)

Very simple and yummy.  My one year old loves them.  I also cut the sugar in half and add an extra banana if I have it, and I use half whole wheat.

Thought these were great, very easy. I like that the addition of baking powder (to what is otherwise pretty much the recipe I use for banana bread) lightens the muffins up considerably, making them different from the denseness of a banana bread. I am a sucker for all things banana, and this recipe is definitely one I will be keeping on hand!

Wow, this is definently going to be a favorite in my family.  The kids love to eat them AND they are easy enough for them to participate in making them.  I followed the suggestion with the vanilla and cinnamon, though I didn't really taste much of them.  Could also add nuts, raisins, or chocolate chips.  Great recipe!

Wowza!!! I had a freaking fanTASTic experience!!! Despite not having a bowl large enough to combine the wet and dry ingredients and resorting to mixing in a saucepan as well as the fact that I mashed the bananas with my hands for fun instead of a fork, these turned out S T U N N I N G. I used butter to coat the tray and these gorgeous & perfectly domed lil guys were immaculately p l u c k e d! from their toasty abodes, no crumbs left behind!!!!

These came out amazing! Perfect! Thanks for this wonderful recipe. I mixed white sugar and brown sugar, about 3 to 1. I also added chopped walnuts, a touch of vanilla extract, and chocolate chips (semi-sweet). My colleagues loved them. I made mini muffins and baked them for around 15-20 minutes. This is one of my first food reviews ever. Needless to say, I will definitely make these again. I also ate them fresh, spread with a little butter.

Excellent! I added a 1/2t cinnamon, 1t vanilla, used half brown sugar and half raw sugar because it’s what I had. I used four medium, nearly black bananas, looked like about 2 cups of gooey banana. Quick and incredibly easy

Definitely will be making this again. Great use of old bananas that get forgotten about. Overall great recipe.

One thing I recommend, for more moist muffins add 0.5-1 extra banana. Also boosts the flavour.

I made this recipe for Christmas brunch. I did make three modifications. First, I substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, so I used 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. Second, I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Third, for the melted butter, I used two tablespoons melted butter and the rest was applesauce. My family loved these muffins.

This is the first time I feel compelled to review a recipe, but these muffins are just so SUPER quick and EASY, and come out tasty. Would be great to bake with kids, too. 
I buy discounted bananas and stick them in the freezer, then microwave when needed, cut off the tip and squeeze out like toothpaste. I add all the dry ingredients together and use a whip to blend together, then I add in whatever I have on hand, like shredded coconut, walnuts, almonds, cranberries, cut up apricots etc -. and then, ever so gently, fold in the wet ingredients. I also double up the recipe, and use just a bit less sugar and baking soda (I find the baking soda can be tasted just a bit otherwise), and like others also added in vanilla.  I also use a little less butter, and I have in the past made these with all apple sauce or mix of banana and apple sauce as well.  It makes 6 great sized muffin heads plus 6 regular sized muffins for me with a double recipe. An absolute winner, would be a perfect recipe to make with kids as so versatile, you could add chocolate chips I would guess, or you could put all kinds of extra ingredients in a bowl and let them make their own type muffins.

These muffins sucked. I added 1/4 cup of milk and cinnamon  and while the batter  tasted amazing, the end result was dry. Cooked them for 20 minutes, would not recommend this recipe.

This is an amazing recipe. Very tasty muffins! It's also easily adaptable. After trying the banana muffins, I substituted a can of pumpkin pie filling in the second batch and added cinnamon, nutmeg, and all spice. Also excellent! Produces a great texture that isn't too wet, which is what I usually struggle with when it comes to fruit muffins.

This recipe is a great backbone for a banana muffin! I added 2/3 cup chocolate chips, 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/4 cup walnuts, and a little bit of lemon zest (to the top of the muffin) to make it more of a banana nut muffin, and they turned out great! Very big and fluffy and will definitely continue experimenting with this recipe.

Turned out soooo good. I made it twice and the key is not to mix it too much it tends to be "heavier" so to speak. All in all a great and simple recipe with ingredients that you don't need to go to the store to get.

I thought this would be a disaster as I ran out of white flour and had to use mostly whole wheat.  I was so wrong! Wow!  I went heavy on the bananas and added a little cinnamon and vanilla.  I also had to increase the cooking time for 12 large muffins.  My favorite trick tho was sprinkling Sugar In The Raw on top.  I adddd a little before baking then a little more when they got out.  It added a wonderful crunch and sweetness without overwhelming.   Excellent!

These were super easy and came out perfect! I love banana bread, but my loaf pan shattered recently and I haven't gotten a new one. These came out lighter and fluffier than I imagined too. Now I have a great way to use up ripe bananas.

Awesome recipe. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract for extra flavor.  Moist, cooked through, just perfect!  I am saving this recipe so I never have to Google search "banana muffin recipe" again.

These were very moist and delicious! Very easy to make. I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla into the batter.  Immediately after I take them out of the oven, I sprinkle sugar onto the top of them too.

I used 1/2 cup regular sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar because I only had 2 ripe bananas along with these changes:  whole stick of melted butter, 1tsp vanilla, 1/2-1 tsp cinnamon, dash nutmeg and dash allspice, along with 1/2 cup finely ground pecans and I couldn't wait till they cooled yummie!!!

I've made these muffins every single week since I found this recipe, we love them!! The only changes I made (after making it exactly as written the first time) are to use only 1/2 cup brown sugar, unsweetened apple sauce in place of the melted butter, and I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract. These changes absolutely are not needed as the original recipe is awesome!! I only made the changes to make them a little healthier and the vanilla just adds a little more to the flavor for me. This recipe also makes exactly 12 muffins for us. I recommend this recipe to everyone I know that likes banana muffins!

These were okay. I will try the recipe again with less mixing, maybe they will turn out more moist. I added a chocolate morsel in the middle, those came cooked up fabulously.

These turned out delicious!!!  My 7 year old made them with a little help from me.  I was out of regular butter, I only had the sweet butter for sweet potatoes (honey, butter, powdered sugar, cinnamon) and used that instead.  Added a little vanilla.  They were wonderful!

let me tell you, ive tried ALOT of banana muffin recipes on this, but these by far were the best ones ! i followed the recipe but made it "healthier" by subbing unsweeted applesauce instead of butter, & let me tell you, they are still as delicious & moist as if using butter ! Overall, FANTASTIC MUFFINS !

Great recipe! my 2 yr old loved it - fluffy, light texture, good banana flavour and a great base recipe that you can play with. I also added a dash of vanilla, nutmeg & cinnamon and subbed whole wheat flour and oats to add more nutrients & fiber, also used canola oil instead of butter (as I wanted to whip these up faster) and a tad less sugar more like 1/2 a cup - and they were plenty sweet. Will be my go-to banana muffin recipe, next time with the addition of chocolate chips!

Delicious easy recipe and of course I put my own spin on it.  Added a shake of cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  Also threw a few handfuls of chocolate chips to the flour mixture. Flour keeps them from sinking to the bottom. To the wet ingredients I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a 1/4 cup of chunky applesauce.  I topped with chopped walnuts after the batter was scooped into the tin. Bake time was 25 minutes and I only got 11 muffins out of this recipe.  Very moist and tasty!

Yummy!  I loved these muffins, even without a streusel topping or nuts inside of it.  I was out of baking soda, so I just used an extra half a teaspoon of baking powder.  They still rose up nicely and they were nice and moist.  Great recipe!

I like them, but they are kind of bland. I did add cinnamon (1/2 tsp) and vanilla extract, but apparently not enough of it. Oh well. For how simple the recipe is, they are good enough. Moist and smell great, as well.

This recipe is great.  The muffins turned out delicious and moist.  I'm not much of a baker, never having made muffins so I was looking for a simple recipe and this one was perfect!  The reviews were helpful.  I didn't know not to over-mix the batter if it weren't for the helpful comments :)

It is a good simple muffin but thought the texture could have been more cake-like.  However, I will be making these again and will try to use the softest banana's I can find to give the muffins a moist texture.

Delicious and very easy. I added a dash of vanilla. Did the rest just like the directions stated. I spooned out six muffins and then added a handful of chocolate chips, stirred in, and spooned out the last six. 

My five year old says, "Those banana muffins are delicious."

recipe was so simple and easy from start to finish.  My kids really enjoyed this very much. I added about 1/2 cup of walnuts to the batter and then when baked I drizzled a little quick glaze on top with a walnut half. They looked absolutely beautiful and were nice, moist and light, not dense. Will make again. TY

These were wonderful!  I did change a few things to make it healthier.  I substituted organic whole wheat pastry flour for the all- purpose flour, used coconut oil in place of the butter, substituted 1/2 cup raw honey for the sugar,added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts, and added 1 t vanilla.  They were very moist and light!

I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar + 1/2 cup of white sugar (instead of the recommended 3/4 cup white sugar), folded in chunks of dark chocolate, and a few pinches of cinnamon. Just barely combined wet and dry ingredients. The muffins were a hit! Delicious, moist, and decadent. Will definitely be making these again :)

Doubled the recipe and wish I could have tripled it. They are moist and fluffy with great banana flavor; my husband and I couldn't get enough of them. Did not deviate or add anything to the recipe. EDIT: After making these several times exactly as written, I tried subbing half the flour with whole wheat flour. I think if I decide to do this again in the future, I'll add nutmeg.

Absolutely THE best muffins I have ever tasted and made in my entire 13 years of life. I baked them in big muffin tins for exactly twenty two minutes and they turned out perfectly, especially with the vanilla extract and cinnamon I added. 
ABSOLUTELY TO DIE FOR MUFFINS.

These are so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and only added a little vanilla and cinnamon like the other reviews said to do. I used very ripe bananas and I didn't over mix it. They're very moist and bold tasting.

This is truly a great recipe !! Made it with the added vanilla and cinnamon as others had suggested! Loved these muffins, made one batch with chocolate chips at my daughter's request. They did bake sooner then the recipe suggests, my were fully baked in 20 minutes, so glad others had given me a heads up !!! Thanks for sharing, this is definitely a recipe that is tried and true!!!!

These are delicious - the flavor of the banana is way out there.  Reduced the sugar by 1/2 since the bananas were overripe.  Also added a teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla as others suggested. Love that this recipe uses melted butter - so quick and easy to throw together.  I overbaked them by mistake and they dried out a little. Follow your nose and start checking when the banana muffin smell starts to make you crazy and draws your stomach to the kitchen.

Great recipe.  
I made it gluten free by substituting for the flour:
1/2 C.ground almonds
1/2 C. tapioca starch
1/2 C potato starch (corn starch or rice flour isn't kosher for Passover)
I used oil instead of butter to make it dairy free
My husband loved it.

I have tried this recipe a few times. Maybe I added too many bananas, the batter was a little dry. Last night, I added some pineapples to the recipe and also 3 tablespoons of strawberry yogurt. Oh my, it smelt so wonderful and the batter was not as dry. And I have also learnt not to overmix the mixture so it was soft and fluffy inside. Btw, I also halved the sugar, and it was just right. Thank you for this wonderful recipe and the video, it waa very helpful for beginners like us. Lil from Singapore

Perfect for what it is - a nice simple banana muffin recipe.  I doubled the recipe with good results (added some pecan pieces and vanilla).  Moist and delicious.  Look no further.

Great simple and quick way to use up ripe bananas.  I doubled the recipe using 6 small bananas. I used 2 cups of ww flour and 1 cup white.  1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2 and 2 tsp of vanilla. Will definitely make again.

This is the only Banana Muffin Recipe I use! It is so simple. I normally will add some vanilla and cinnamon to these or sub a little brown sugar for the white sugar. These are truly great!

This was an easy way to use up my browning bananas before hitting the store! They were delicious and moist. I did sub 1/4 cup of the white sugar with brown and added a tsp of vanilla. I used a 12 muffin non-stick pan and it only took 22 min. My 17 year old daughter loved them.

I loved the muffins, I too added cinnamon and a t. of vanilla. I also put some chopped pecans on top before 
I baked them. So good. A perfect way to use up my 3 over ripe bananas.

Great, of course I made a few changes: 
brown sugar instead of white
vanilla extract
cinnamon and nutmeg
1t. salt 
I throw all the wet ingredients together + salt, cinnamon and nutmeg (dissolves better)- electric mixer
fold in flour and rising agents
then into the oven- super easy.

I used margarine instead of butter. Muffins only took 20 minuets in my old oven at 325, turned out great.  Will use this recipe again and again.  Would be great with nuts.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but the muffins turned out dry and lacking flavour.  I used 3 old  frozen bananas(something I haven't done before)...not sure if that makes a difference.

Easy and delicious. We add cinnamon and ground flax seed. Sometimes we'll use coconut oil 1:1 instead of butter with tasty results. Other times we'll throw in a fourth banana and I think I like those results even better.

My preschoolers helped make this recipe in class for Letter M week. After years of using a blueberry muffin recipe with mixed approval from the "food critics" :) I decided to check online for an easy muffin recipe that kids love. This one worked so well, it will become my new muffin recipe. SO easy for the kids to make, and they Loved it! Note: I did let them add some mini chocolate chips to the recipe. This added to the kid appeal. If you are a parent of a child read " If you give a Moose a Muffin" before heading to the kitchen. A fun day guaranteed!

Great recipe!  Turned it a little more dessert-style with a little vanilla and a dash of cinnamon, but also added a tablespoon and a half or cocoa, mini chocolate chips and a sprinkle of coarse sugar.

Very delicious, moist and easy! I pureed my bananas and some apples in the cuisinart. Also substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for 1/2 c of the all purpose. Used about 1/2 the amount of butter since I added the apples. Love them!

These muffins are simple to make, and are quite moist.  I used a mixture of whole wheat and white flour for a cup of the flour, and substituted a 1/2-cup of wheat germ for the last 1/2-cup of flour.  This may have caused them to be a bit crumbly, but they are nonetheless quite tasty.

My daughter, an avid banana avoider, finally relented and tasted one, then proceeded to eat several in a row.  

Definitely a hit at our house!

These turned out really well. They are the most moist recipe I have ever used. I doubled the recipe and didn't have enough white sugar, so i used one cup white sugar, and a half cup brown sugar. Excellent! Will definitely make again!

I keep making these.  I like substituting sugar free applesauce for part of the butter (sf applesauce at Walmart, 2.00 for a big jar).  Also, I use part brown sugar, use cinnamon and vanilla. I add pecans, finely chopped.  Everyone loves these, even picky eaters.

I think the key is having really, really over-ripe bananas. This was my first try with this recipe and It is a keeper!  I added some chopped, toasted walnuts and some butterscotch chips and was afraid that would mess with the chemistry, but other than taking longer to bake, they came out moist and tasty!

Delicious!! We added semi sweet chocolate chips! However, when I checked them at 24 minutes, they were already quite brown. Would adjust to 20 min bake time at 350F.

This is the BEST muffin recipe I've ever used. I frequently make it in the mornings,(it's that easy!) especially if family or friends are coming over. I add cinnamon, vanilla and sometimes white chocolate chips. YUM YUM, a dozen never lasts longer than a day. Thank you for sharing your recipe!!!

YUMM!! Made this exactly as written and we loved how these came out - great texture, flavor, and moistness. You could probably easily replace the butter with applesauce, and reduce the sugar a little (if using very overripe bananas like I did) - but really these don't need to be changed at all. We all really enjoyed these, and the leftovers were great the next day for a quick breakfast snack.

I took a chance based on the good reviews and doubled this and I'm so glad I did! Added some walnuts and some got mini choc chips! I did decrease the white sugar to 1/2c and added 1/4c brown sugar, and they were moist and delicious- not too sweet and perfect with coffee :)
Must try!! O and did half the butter and added 1/2 applesauce (followed the suggestions of other reviews).

Great recipe. I added one teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to the dry ingredients, and one tsp of vanilla to the wet ingredients. I actually forgot to add the egg and they still turned out really well! Don't over-mix the wet and dry together!

I've been making these muffins for years, the recipe is perfect as written, no need to change a thing. I now make them in a single bowl, first combining the wet ingredients, then stirring in baking powder, baking soda and salt, finally folding in the flour. So much easier and the results are identical, always moist and light.

These muffins were INCREDIBLE straight from the oven! My boyfriend and I sat down to share one over tea, and ended up devouring six before we knew it! My only complaint is that they got slightly hard/dense as they cooled... although I may have overcooked them a tad (27 mins.) I'll leave them in just until done next time.

EXCELLENT!!  I made these exactly as the directions say, and I have to tell you all that not only are these the easiest banana muffins I've ever made, but they are absolutely delicious as well.  No need to tweak as far as I'm concerned.  These are already a new favorite.  My family couldn't wait for them to cool entirely (I'm guilty of that as well).  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, ABI...

This was really yummy! Like other reviewers suggested, I added 1 tsp.vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  I also used 1/3 cup applesauce instead of butter to make it healthier.  It was moist, soft, with lots of flavor, definitely recommend this!

Easy and quick! Follow the recipe as written and it won't fail.
I adjusted the recipe to make 6 muffins and used 1 whole small egg (even though the adjusted recipe called for 1/2 of an egg)! it worked just fine with the whole egg.
One could add 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts, and sprinkle with some sanding sugar (which I did) or whatever else you like, but when you add other things you are not really making THIS recipe.

I forgot to add the melted butter! But they still turned out moist, attractive and tasty. I had replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with oat bran and added 1/2 cup walnuts. Served them with a dab of butter and they were delicious

Like other reviewers, I added 1 tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  My bananas were only medium-sized, so I used 4.  30 minutes was perfect timing for large muffins.  These are even better when stuck in the toaster oven for a little while.

These were delicious! I took a chance with them and made them for a family breakfast, and everyone loved them. I didn't have a whole lot of chopped walnuts, so I just sprinkled some on top for garnish. It was just enough crunch.

Wonderful banana flavor. The entire family loved these muffins and they were easy and quick to throw together. I followed the recipe exactly except I added one tsp vanilla and one cup of chopped walnut pieces. This recipe is a keeper.

If you're looking for a fluffy banana muffin... You're looking in the right place! I did cut down the sugar to 1/2 of a cup and than added a couple tablespoons of liquid honey. They are a bit sweet still. Next time I think I will do 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 honey and see how that turns out. I also divided the recipe into 3 and made three different kinds: walnut, chocolate chip and raspberries. They all turned out great!

This recipe was really good. I did substitute one of those unsweetened applesauce cups for all of the butter in the recipe, and added nutmeg and vanilla. I also added 2 tbsp of poppy seeds, and it turned out really flavorful. i definitely think you should add some spices, either nutmeg or cinnamon as other reviewers suggested.  Definitely a keeper. They came out soft and moist.

These were fantastic! Followed the recipe exactly except I added an additional banana and some chopped walnuts. (I did not factor that into my score; these were personal preferences as I needed to use up all of the bananas I had because they were on their way out). These were so moist and the flavor intensified the next day. My boyfriend brought them to work and his co-worker's loved them, even asked for my. Mine came out a little stickier looking than in the photos, but I think that was because I used that extra banana. Will definitely make again.

I don't think it deserves a 5 star rating but yeah, they're good.  Definitely don't cook them longer than 25 minutes or they get dry and tough.  Bake just until done!  :)

This recipe was an awesome base, and I would have given it 5 stars but I tweaked it a bit based on other's suggestions.  I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp of pumpkin spice, and 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I also reduced the flour to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup of whole oats.  The result was a perfect muffin that pleased both finicky kids and adults alike.

Makes a tasty muffin- like a mix between a muffin and banana bread.  I did make a few substitution out of necessity.  Subbed coconut oil for the butter, added one tablespoon of coconut milk, and only 1/2 cup of sugar.

I decided to make this because I was fairly certain that I had all of the ingredients. The result? A dozen very very delicious banana muffins. The taste had that banana flavor, but not overpowering. The reason for the four stars is that this muffin needed a little bit more of actual sweetness (if my mom or my brother, my brother being extremely picky with food, was writing this review, they would give five stars)... and it looked a bit like a bran muffin (although that isn't exactly the reason I docked points). It's very very easy as well - I WAS intending to do it on my own when my mother arrived, but oh well. A big hit with the family - six were quickly snatched away within seconds of popping out of the oven, with them smelling like typical banana and looking like typical banana. We're intending to make it this Thanksgiving; hopefully we'll double or maybe triple the recipe! I also changed the recipe from all-purpose flour to Sofasilk's cake flour, but I doubt that it made a difference.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was ok, but lacked flavor; even with all the sugar & bananas. The muffins baked up nicely, though, fairly moist. With a little tweaking this is a good basic recipe. I recommend baking muffins at 340 degrees for about 12-15 min. They came out perfect with this change. I will try some of the other review suggestions for flavor enhancement.

I made exactly as directed.  Turned out fine, but I just wasn't "wowed" by them.  Can't put my finger on why not.  Plenty of banana flavor and moist.  Had to put them in the fridge or else they were too sticky.
Made again:
1/4 c wh. Sugar,1/4 c. Br. sugar
One batch with plain Greek yogurt, one with butter
Yogurt one was more dry therefore add more yogurt or an extra banana

I made banana muffins this morning by following the recipe. They were sooooo good! I used four ripe bananas and added 1/2 cup of pecans. I also reduced the amount of sugar (5/8 cup) and butter (1/4 cup), and added 2 tbs apple sauce and 1/2 tsp vanila extract, and turned out perfect. My picky kids love them. Even my 1 year old finished one mini muffin. I'll definitely make this again.

Love this recipe! I changed it a little bit based on the comments and it turned out really good. Here are my changes: 

Substituted the white sugar for brown. 
Added: 
1/3 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

These are great and easy.

I added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. I wish I'd skipped the cinnamon; it's good but tastes spiced rather than simply banana flavored.  I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for the butter and it worked fine.

this is just a slam-dunk!  as long as the bananas are ripe enough, i don't think anyone can fail this one!!  i don't have all-purpose flour and therefore i used cake flour instead (2 more tablespoon per cup), it just worked out perfect.  simple and tasty.  i am now waiting impatiently for my bananas to ripen!

These came out great, made a few changes, added 2 tbsp flaxseed, & used 1/2 c. brown sugar/1/4 c. white sugar. I didn't have butter, but used 1/4 c. margarine & added 1/4 c. applesauce. They were a hit with the whole family!

Great muffins! I didn't have any eggs, so I used 1½ tsp. baking powder, 1 tablespoon vinegar and 1 tablespoon water. Then I added a 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I use a nonstick muffin top pan, and it only took 15 minutes. Will make again!

Used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 unbleached white flour. Substituted apple sauce for some of the butter but added 1/2 cup each of chocolate chips and chopped pecans! Baked for 35 min. YUMMY!!! Thanks for the great simple recipe!

I made these last night and they turned out so yummy! 

I saw some other reviewers added applesauce instead of butter, so I put 1/3 cup applesauce in put them in the oven for 226 minutes. They were really soft and probably could have stood another minute or two in there, but they were good either way.

These were simple and great tasting. I wanted a simple recipe and this was it! I had to make 1/3 batch because I only had 1 super ripe banana (who has 3 at a time, anyway??), so since you can't add 1/3 of an egg, I used 1/3 of a "flaxseed egg" (1 tsp ground flaxseed, 3 tsp water, mix & let sit 2 minutes-it didn't have a great texture but I put it in anyway and it worked great!). I didn't add anything to this recipe and I made 4 large muffins, which cooked for about 20 minutes and were very tasty :)

I'm throwing out my old recipe and only using this one from now on.  Easy and delicious!  I added cinnamon, vanilla, and a little molasses.  I also substituted Smart Balance Light since my daughter is allergic to dairy.  They came out perfect!  Thank you for the recipe!

Made this one a few times, turned out great every time. This last time I substituted half of the all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour, replaces half the butter with applesauce, added a tsp. vanilla, and substituted half of the white sugar for brown sugar. Turned out excellent and still very moist!

My son is allergic to milk and egg yolks, so I made this using dairy free margarine and egg whites.  It was DELICIOUS!  I never dreamed so few ingredients would amount to such a tasty muffin.

Made 12 beautiful muffins, and they also freeze great.  Added about 1/2 cup mini choc chips, reserving about 6 tablespoons for decorating tops before baking.

So easy to make, my 4 year old did most of it!  I subbed about 1/4 cup of brown sugar for 1/4 of the white.  Added mini chocolate chips in 1/2 of the batter.  Made about 34 mini muffins, and baked for 10 mins.

Excellent, easy recipe. We've made this one a few times and quadruple it! We reduce the sugar though and add a snack cup of applesauce, also add cinnamon and sweetened coconut and finish with a tiny sprinkling of brown sugar on the top!

I made these muffins yesterday with a few changes. First, I used three frozen bananas (that I kept in my freezer since last week) instead of ripe ones. Plus, I used less sugar than the recipe suggests because I put in half-sweet chocolat pieces. They tasted great, the smell of banana was amazing!

Very nice - quick and easy.  Made with homemade applesauce to replace ALL the fat, and it worked out fine.  Added half cup of butterscotch chips, which was also very pleasant.

Very tasty muffin! I added some vanilla extract and cinnamon to the mix for some extra flavor. I also added about 1/2 cup of cinnamon apple sauce becuase I didn't have quite enough banana. They were delicious. I will definitely make them again.

Awesome! The whole family loves them. I added semi-sweet chocolate chips. I also omitted the salt and baking soda (just used a touch more powder) and they were delicious. Could also add a bit of nutmeg for more flavour. The first batch I baked until the tops were almost all golden and they were still a bit doughy in the middle, so I baked the next batch longer. 5 stars though! No complaints from anyone, and I've made this more than once. :)

This recipe is great with some allowances as suggested by other reviewers. I used some cinnamon, added a spoon full of apple butter and used 1/4 cup of brown sugar with the 1/2 cup of white sugar. You can definitely be a little creative with this one.

I have been using this incredible and easy recipe for years. I love the buttery flavor and moist texture. It's perfect except for the fact that it hardly rises at all, so I don't use it for muffins but it makes a killer banana bread, even better if you add pecans.

I messed up by not having enough butter, so I had to substitute vegetable oil and I didn't mix the batter properly, and despite ALL of that, they came out dark but DELICIOUS. I added vanilla and cinnamon, and I doubled the recipe, it had great banana flavour despite my mishaps, I will definitely try this again!

Absoloutely wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly, and when puttining it on the cupcake liners, I topped it with walnuts. I made it for breakfast and the smell was overwhelming! I put it in the oven for 25 minutes-it made it really brown, like on the verge of burning but it was still good. The recipe is fabulous for making something delicious with bannanas. But adding nuts should be a must! I don't think it would be as good without a little crunch to it. Definetely making these again. Can't resist seconds or thirds!

These muffins are EASY and delicious!  My kids like to mix in PB and/or chocolate chips.  I love that it's simple & I can whip up a batch (or two) quickly after school.  We've made them 4 times in two weeks already -- and they are gobbled up for breakfast & snacks.

I love this recipe. My family loves it too. These muffins are so delightful! I made the recipe as stated...however, just because I like spices, i added some cinnamon, clove and French vanilla extract. I imagine that would have been just as good with out the additional spices though. Thank you for a quick, delicious, easy, moist muffin recipe!

These muffins were delicious!  Very easy to make.  I didn't change anything.  Can't wait until I have more over-ripe bananas!  Will definately have them again.

Amazing! A perfect breakfast.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and mixed until just moistened.

Fantastic!  This is definitely my new go to muffin recipe.  Great taste, great texture. Only change I made was to use half brown sugar and half white.  I'm thinking about trying these with applesauce instead of bananas, too.

I have made this recipe twice. I make them with whole wheat flour, splenda instead of sugar and unsweetened applesauce in lieu of melted butter. I also added raisins (softened by a hot water soak first), nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla. So amazing- even with my healthy twist on it. Suggestion: these muffins taste even better the next day, if that is even possible. Mine usually dont last quite that long :) Going in my recipe box forever!

This one was a keeper.  I made them in 'mini' form for my daughter's pre-school class snack.  I added one chocolate chip to the top of each before baking and they were a hit!  My mother-in-law wanted to know if I had to take ALL of them to school, because she wanted some for herself!

They were very good.  The only reason that i am giving 4 stars is i think i can tweek them a little more to make them better.  I added vanilla extract and pecans.  Next time i am going to add cinnamon and some brown sugar.

A pretty solid recipe, but so oily!  Made according to the recipe, but added about 1/3 c. chocolate chips at the end.  Don't think that would have caused the problem though.  Very tasty overall and would probably make again some time.

These were very yummy. I only had 2 bananas on hand so next time I think they'll have even more banana-flavor to them. I used 1/4 c. brown sugar and 2/4 c. white sugar, plus added a dash of cinnamon. Also, mine were a little brown so next time I'll only cook them 20 min. instead of 25. But even a little brown they still turned out nice and moist on the inside!

Yummy!  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla per other comments.  I will also add a few chopped walnuts next time.  I had heard you could freeze ripe banannas for use later use. I gave it a try on this recipe, after the bannanas thawed they were perfect for use in this recipe.

Fantastic, easy muffins! I was worried about how they would come out because I goofed and completely forgot to add the egg... they were still light, tasty, and rose wonderfully! Can't wait to try them again making them correctly!

Well i must start of by saying this is my first time baking. I use this recipe and combine it with a few other items, i included chunky chips ahoy cookies, vanilla extract and cinnamon, i replaced the melted butter with 1/3 cup of milk and it came out great, next time i would use some nuts to give it a bit of a crunch.

These are delicious! I added pecans and just a little cinnamon. My 6-year-old grandson bit into one this morning and said, "Oh Nana, I am ALWAYS going to love your muffins." Now there's an endorsement for you. I'd give them a 10 if I could.

This recipe was simple and good.  Not the best banana muffins I've ever had but the simplicity of the recipe makes up for it.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and they were sweet enough.  Also added cinnamon and vanilla.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and kid-friendly. Made these with my 3-year old. Cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup and added some chocolate chips. Used up the bananas left in my freezer so used 5 medium ones. Made 12 perfectly sized muffins. Everyone at preschool enjoyed them.

It's a really handy and perfect portion to fit a 12's muffin pan.
I reduce butter to 1/4 cup, add 1 table spoon of olive oil, also used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead and works excellent.

I followed the recipe and added a dash of vanilla extract and nutmeg because I read some of the other reviews.  I gave some to my family and they all liked it.  I have to say I was rather impressed that I actually made these. They were great!

Great Muffins! I changed a couple things. Used Splenda for the sugar, added 1 container Fr.Vanilla Yogurt, added 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and a 'few' pecans (didn't measure them) 

The recipe is WONDERFUL AS IS, AND GREAT with the cnanges... A KEEPER

Fabulous recipe.  I make these all the time when I have over-ripe bananas I don't want to just throw away.  These make a yummy quick breakfast or a snack for when I'm on the go.  I usually throw in some chocolate chips. Soo delicious!

These muffins are so incredible! They come out with this really delicious crust all around them and a super banana flavor. I literally have no complaints about this recipe whatsoever - such a keeper!

Very good!  I used all whole wheat pastry flour instead of all-purpose, melted shortening instead of butter (we were out), and substituted 1/4 cup of white sugar with brown.  I also added 1 tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of pumpkin spice, 1/8 tsp allspice, and a dash of nutmeg.  They look and taste great!  Husband loves them too- good way to use up aging bananas!

I was looking for something to do with the 3 bananas I had before they went bad and this was it. I added in vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon for flavor, but I really like this recipe! It taste great without any walnuts!

I loved these! I doubled the recipe and used half wheat, half white flour. I used Xagave instead of sugar, and added cinnamon, and nutmeg. I forgot to add the eggs and didn't realize it until we had all tucked into them. We love them anyway! Couldn't notice. Since the bananas are an emulsifier, it didn't need it. The only con is I thought they were too salty. I could taste salt. It wasn't overpowering, but definately noticable. Next time, I'll reduce the salt by half. This recipe is a keeper.

These were a hit. I even used 2 bananas instead of 3 (I used frozen and only thawed 2) and they were still good (though I would only do that in a pinch in the future!).

I only had smaller bananas, so I used 4 instead of 3.  I used brown sugar instead of white, and I think it turned out a bit too sweet.  Not sure if it was the extra banana, or the sugar.  I added some vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon which added great flavor.  Definitely a keeper.

These were delicious. I added a little vanilla and some cinnamon. I only used a little over 1 cup of flour (ran out), and only stirred in all ingredients (did not use a mixer) and they were perfect. Very moist and Very EASY!

This is a great recipe meaning it is very easy to make. I followed the advice from other cooks by adding 1 tsp of cinnamon and about 1/2 cup of raisins. I also replaced the butter with applesauce. These muffins are moist and full of flavor. I will make again!

I realized I had forgotten to add butter when I was already scooping them into the muffin cups but by then it was too late! However, this recipe doesn't even need butter. The muffins turned out PERFECTLY. They were slightly crispy, rose beautifully and tasted heavenly. I used half wheat flour have regular flour and added the cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla as recommended by others. Then, I used my mixer to blend the bananas, egg, sugar, and vanilla after mashing the bananas by hand. I folded in the dry ingredients as the recipe called for and used an icecream scoop to put portioned amounts in the cups. Removing the butter took away about 300 total calories. Don't tell my husband the muffins are good for him ;D

Quite good, though a slight tendency to be a little dry. I use one banana, one cup of plain yogurt, and one cup of applesauce.  The most important addition:  chocolate chips!  Yummy enough that I make them every few weeks.

I just made these and they are soooo YUMMY!  I did make a few substitutions because I was making them for my diabetic mom and 22 month old son (neither of whom need any extra sugar in their system!)  I used 1c whole wheat flour + 1/2c white flour, substituted the white sugar wiith 1/2c of organic blue agave sweetener, and used unsweetened applesauce instead of butter then baked as directed!    They came out perfect!  Definitely will be making these again!

My grandmother always prided herself on the best banana bread recipe. Sorry, Grandma. This is absolutely the BEST, most MOIST banana bread/muffin recipe EVER!!!Use the oldest, black bananas you can find. I usually freeze them first and use 4 instead of 3.

So I had a few brown bananas but was missing the sour cream that my normal banana bread recipe calls for. I decided it was time to branch out. After reading other reviews I decided to change the sugar to 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar. I had also intended on adding a splash vanilla but completely forgot. I made some muffins with walnuts, some with chocolate chips and some plain. I definitely enjoyed the ones with nuts the most. These are very very moist muffins (I'm sure due to the fact that there are 3 bananas!) but I found then took a lot longer to bake. My mini muffins too almost 20 minutes and my regular muffins took almost 30. Will definitely make again in lieu of my sour cream recipe.

Delicious!! I added a touch of vanilla and pinch of cinnamon and walnuts to the tops. I guess the only thing I still wonder about is how much is too much mixing when it comes to muffins. Mine turned out very moist but I still wonder if they could have been better.

I've been making this exact recipe for a couple of years now, just love it!  I add about 1/2 cup of choc chips as others have mentioned and they are a huge hit as christmas gifts!

Followed other suggestions about adding cinnamon  brown sugar, and chopped walnuts. Best banana muffins ever. I used  peeled bananas that I had frozen and they worked great. Will make these often.

Awesome recipe - I too added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.  Do watch the cooking time - they may need more or less depending on amount in each cup and/or your oven.  I would've given five stars but found the paper cupcake wrappers a bit greasy when removed from the cupcake pan.  May use applesauce in lieu of the butter next time.  Very good muffin - the kids love them.

Swapped a couple ingredients to make this a healthier snack. 1/2 wheat flour, applesauce for the butter, reduced the sugar. I did add a splash of milk and some cinnamon too. I baked in a loaf pan for 40 minutes, and had a warm piece as soon as I could cut it. YUM!

Wow!  Great every time.  If you want a stronger banana flavor , just use overipe bananas.  If you are too busy, freeze the overipe  bananas until ready to use...yes, they turn dark, but the flavor is wonderful.  My kids would never eat an overipe  banana.....but they sure gobble these muffins!

These deserve a five star- but I make several additions/substitutions to try to make them healthier and, I think, tastier.  I've made this recipe several times and they always come out great!  If you're trying to banana nut bread use a loaf pan, well greased and bake for at least an hour (I made the mistake last time of not letting it cook long enough :-( ).  Anyway, here are my regular substitutions:  1 tsp cinnamon to the flour mixture, 1 tsp of vanilla to the banana mixture, chopped walnuts to the banana mixture BEFORE adding dry mix, 1 c whole wheat flour instead of 1 c of the all-purpose.  This time I tried using less of the melted butter and supplementing with plain- no sugar added applesauce- enough to bring the volume up to 1/3 c total.  And I tried some streussel topping, but I think it may have failed.

I made this recipe this morning in about 10 minutes! It tastes EXACTLY the way you want a banana muffin to taste- the texture was PERFECT! Only thing I added after reading review was 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract- everything else stayed the same! I WILL ONLY MAKE THIS RECIPE FROM NOW ON! :) EXCELLENT!

I followed other reviews suggestions to add 1 tsp vanilla. I also used brown sugar instead of white and Tenderflake shortening instead of butter. I then did half the recipe with pieces of strawberries and then other half with chocolate chips for my kiddies. My picky kiddies enjoyed them and gobbled the chocolate chip ones up. My hubby took a few on a long car trip for breakfast and said they were super yum. Definately make these again.

This is the exact recipe I've been using for years now. The only difference is that I add 1/3 cup of walnut pieces (2/3 cups of walnut pieces for 1/2 the recipe cause I LOVE walnuts and my kids think the muffins end up too bitter when there is too many walnuts.)  and I only bake them 20 mins.

These were tasty...My boyfriend loved them. I doubled the recipe so I got 24 muffins. The first batch of 12 I forgot when I put them in and I ended up taking them out early (probably  baked for 15 or 20 minutes) the second batch I baked for 25 minutes like the recipe says.....my boyfriend loved them but he prefers the ones taken out early...they were more soft and moist and had more taste..so that would be my only suggestion is to keep an eye on them while they are baking.

Hands down the best banana muffin recipe I've ever tried! I followed it almost exactly: Since I was short on butter, I used half butter and half margarine. I also added about a tablespoon of vanilla into the banana mixture, as well as some cinnamon. SO GOOD!! I couldn't wait and almost burned my mouth to eat them! haha

These muffins are AMAZING!  I added 1 tsp of vanilla as others suggested.  To make it even easier I used the food processor.  First process bananas to a smooth puree, then add sugar and egg (and vanilla if desired) and process again.  Add melted butter or oil through the tube with the motor running.  Add baking powder, baking soda and salt and process again.  Then add flour and pulse a few times to combine, don't overprocess.  I made 6 jumbo muffins and they were done in about 40 minutes to perfection!

I followed the quantities exactly and the muffins turned out perfectly - I did add a tsp of vanilla extract and about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips - I also sprinkled the muffins with a little bit of granulated sugar before baking to give it a nice crisp and shiny top :) SO important do not over mix - only mix lightly and gently.

Really easy and really yummy!  I did add some cinnamon and vanilla just because! I subbed one cup of whole wheat flour so I had 1 cup whole wheat and 2 cups all purpose. I doubled the recipe and got 3 mini loaves, 24 mini muffins and 12 regular muffins!   Don't over mix, just fold in until it is combined!  I let mine set in the fridge over night and made them fresh this morning!  Excellent taste and so simple!

Really enjoyed these...made a few minor changes...only used 1/2 cup sugar (they were still plenty sweet), used canola oil instead of butter and used 1/2 whole wheat flour.  Husband who is very picky loved these.

Excellent recipe!  I did add the vanilla (1 tsp) like many reviewers suggested.  I cooked the mini muffins for 14 minutes.  They rose beautifully and came out perfect!

Mmmm, so good!  I used margarine, Splenda instead of sugar, and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Next time I will add vanilla as others suggested.  Thanks!

Yummy!! They didn't come out overly sweet, which may be because I used bananas that were quite green and very far from ripe.  I really like the subtle sweet flavor, but next time I'll definitely use a riper banana.    I also added walnuts (my favorite nut!) and they're delicious and out of this world.

I love this easy recipe.  Added the cinnamon and vanilla as others suggested and don't mix the wet stuff w/ flour too much. Like to add chopped walnuts too.  What really puts them over the top is to put a hersey's chocolate kiss or even better a Dove milk chocolate candy on fresh out of the oven muffin.  It will melt nicely and the flavor is sooooo good.  enjoy!

Amazing and versatile! I added an extra banana b/c I had one leftover. I substituted 1/3 cup butter for 1/3cup applesauce. The apple sauce was sweetened so I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup. The sweetness from the extra banana and applesauce balanced the flavors wonderfully.  I increased cooking time by almost 10 mins (probably b/c of the banana).  A tsp of cinnamon was a great addition and made the house smell heavenly! Next time I’m adding nuts.

These were moist and delicious. I will definitely make them again. I followed the directions as written. I filled mini muffin cups 3/4 full, and ended up with batter for 36 mini muffins, rather than 48. Cooking time was 15 minutes.

Perfect and delish! I did follow other reviewers and added cinammon and vanilla just for the heck of it. I also added choc chips to the second batch we made! Loved it. This will be my go to banana muffin recipe, although I may cut the sugar to 1/2 cup next time. Just in a small effort to be a little more healthy ;-).

I found 25 minutes too long for baking, 22 minutes was perfect. I only used 1 3/4 cups of sugar. I used half whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup of ground flax seed, some vanilla, 50/50 non hydrogenated margarine and grapeseed oil instead of all butter and sprinkled with slivered almonds before baking, these muffins turned out fantastic. I will definitely make them again.

Good muffins!  I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and a teaspoon of vanilla like other reviewers, cut the amount of butter and used 1/4 c of applesauce instead for lower fat muffins like another user suggested.  Didn't have any brown sugar or I would have used part brown sugar instead of all granulated sugar.. but I added a little bit of molasses (a little less than 1/8 cup) and that made these really good!  Guess I changed a lot, but they turned out awesome.  Added some chocolate chips and made mini muffins, and my husband and toddler loved them!  It was a good way to get my son to eat some bananas.

This is a really great recipe.  I made these last night.  I made a few changes - used 1/4 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. br. sugar, added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 c. choc. chips.  I filled extra large muffin tins about 1/2 way and I got 8 muffins.  They took 24 min. to bake.  I sprayed the tins with Pam and they came out great!!  Will definitely use this recipe again.

These were very good.  I added a half teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry mix.  I also made sure I didn't mix the batter but instead kept folding the batter until it was just mixed.  I made the 12 large muffins but they were done almost 10 mins ahead of time.  The smell while baking was incredible!

AMAAAZING!!! i did add about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, as well as half a cup of walnuts to one batch and chocolate chips to the other half. I had to double the recipe b/c these were deeelicious!  My family looved them!

These were soo easy to make & were really yummy & moist!! I liked these better than the top rated banana muffins (can't remember what they were called) I took other reviewer's suggestions & added 1/4 cup walnuts, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamin & then sprinkled the muffins with cinnamin & sugar before baking them. The only other change I made was that I used only 2 banana's because thats all I had on hand. They still turned out great & were delish...great banana flavor!!!

These muffins were really easy to make and tasted really good! I added 1tsp vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon based on other reviews, and cinnamon apple sauce because I only had 2 bananas. Also sprinkled brown sugar on top (only because my 4yo really wanted to put green apple sprinkles on them and I needed a fast alternative!) but we really liked it. I will definitely use the brown sugar on top in the future. Thanks for the great, simple recipe!

Everyone loves this recipe! I often make a banana bread from it and it comes out light and fluffy.   I've added choc chips and/or toasted walnuts and it tastes really great.

These muffins are so yummy! Full of flavor and fluffy.  I made them as directed and came out perfectly.  However I only had to bake for 20 minutes for normal sized muffins.

Yummy! I did as others recommended and added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and replaced the butter with applesauce. It made 24 mini muffins and 6 regular sized muffins. We will definitely make these again!

Just got done making these muffins, and they are GREAT!! I did however add 1 tsp. vanilla, and cinnamon, just to add a little bit of a spice taste. Other than that I will be making again. Just gave my daughter who is almost 2, and bite and she keeps coming back for more!! lol... Nice recipe!!! Thanks

These muffins were great, they went so fast! The only change I made was to add a little sourcream, which just makes the muffins even more moist...other than that, kept everything the same.

LOVE this recipe... I used it when I was visiting my in-laws in Hawaii, as we had some over ripe bananas that needed to be used.  I added a handful of mac nuts to the recipe and it they came out AMAZING!  Thanks for the recipe!

Love the simplicity of this recipe.  I substituted 1 c whole wheat flour for the white, substituted 1/4 c brown sugar for white, used applesauce instead of butter, then added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon.  I think they will all be gone before the end of the day! 17 month old loves them too!

Good, basic, and easy muffin recipe.  I chose it because it used butter instead of oil or shortening.  This was quick to whip up, and a good after-school snack for the kids.  The adults liked them too.

Quite a nice recipe - did change a bit to our tastes, used applesauce to replace most of the melted butter (made the applesauce at home using the 'sarah's applesauce' recipe); and the peels left over from the apples were cut up coarsely and added to the muffin mix for a bit of texture variation and added fibre/nutrients.  Also added a bit of vanilla and cinnamon.  Adding a crumb/oatmeal topping also enhances the flavour a bit.  So; as written; 4 stars; with the changes; 5...  Thanks for the recipe!

So, so good. I made them exactly as written, and added half a bag of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. Got rave reviews - this is now my go-to quick and easy muffin (not to mention a great way to use up brown bananas). Thanks!

Exceptionally moist, light and tasty muffins! I only had 2 large ripe bananas and still they tasted awesome. They only thing I did different was to add vanilla.  I also had no problem removing muffins from pan using just cooking spray and a dusting of flour. I used a mini pan and found they were perfect at 19-20 minutes. Not sure why some reviewers rated them as flavorless? This isn't a banana spice cake/muffin recipe!  I will definitely be making these over and over again!  Thanks for sharing :)

I've made these muffins the past 2 Saturday mornings. Taking care to slowly fold the wet and dry ingredients together results in very fluffy, moist muffins with a huge banana flavor!

Good, although I did make some alterations: I used applesauce instead of butter, and I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. I also added an extra banana. Very good, and healthy to boot!

This made 12 normal sized muffins and 8 mini muffins for me. They baked perfectly, no one has tried them yet though. I was tempted to add vanilla or cinnamon but my dad forced me to follow a recipe without modifying for once lol.

Super moist!I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon, some vanilla extract (capful) and a bit of brandy! They came out delicious! I have to say I followed the advice of not overmixing and fold the mixture in. Delicious and will be making again for sure.

These were so easy to make, and were delicious! I used over-ripe bananas as they are a bit sweeter.

Very tasty recipe. Bakes to be nice and golden and chewy. I also added some toast walnuts and chocolate chips. Yum! Next time I might also add cinnamon and vanilla as another reviewer suggested, to kick it up a bit more.

These are tasty!  Just what I was wanting to make.  I did add chopped walnuts, cinnamon and vanilla as someone else suggested!  That was a great idea.  I only had two bananas, so that's what I used and it worked out well. Don't over stir ingredients.  I only baked for 18-20 minutes and it was plenty of time!

I don't know if anyone noticed, but this is the exact same recipe as the banana crumb muffin from this site, but without the crumb topping. Anyway, I made this one with half ww flour, and one of the 3 bananas was a frozen banana, that I melted along with the butter. I don't know if this had anything to do with how good it came out, but the texture of these muffins was unbelievably moist, and bakery quality (Even better!). My kids my friend, my husband and I were unanimous on how delicious and great texture these were! Thanks so much for this great recipe.

Pretty darn good.  I added some cinnamon and vanilla and I only had 2 bananas left.  I too thought the batter was a little dry and added a bit of vegetable oil to moisten things up a bit.  I think the muffins were delicious and very easy to make.  I  will definitely be making these again.  An easy and yummy breakfast.

Fantastic! Very quick and easy to make, and they stay very moist even a couple days later! ... i add a crumble topping to mine: 1/4C brown sugar, 1/6C all-purpose flour, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 TBS melted butter, mix with a fork and then with your hands a bit if it's too clumpy. sprinkle on the tops before you put it in the oven. Yum!

VERY good! I added 1 tsp. vanilla, as others suggested and also a little bit of water (maybe 1/4 c.?) to ensure they would be moist (most muffins I make from scratch tend to turn out dry).  Next time though, I plan on using Canola oil instead of butter, to make them more healthy. Also, will add a little bit of honey. Nice alternative to banana bread.

These were delicious! I followed this recipe this the exception of using 4 medium bananas (as opposed to 3 large) and substituted 1/4 cup brown sugar for some of the white sugar (1/2 cup white,1/4 cup brown).  I checked on the muffins after about 22 minutes.  I really enjoyed how they weren't high in fat or calories, too.  My husband tried them before I did and he loved them!  Thanks for the recipe :-)  Enjoy!

We loved these!  I followed the recipe as is and they were gobbled up within hours.  I made another batch the next morning using my mini muffin pan - so good!  I am patiently waiting for more bananas to ripen. Will definitely make again and again!

By far the best banana muffin I've made.  I changed it up a little for the way we eat, substituting freshly milled whole wheat pastry flour for the flour and adding a little vanilla.  I sprinkled chopped/crushed walnuts over the top to create a little contrast.  The muffins looked and tasted great!

Oh-ho are these good!!  Perfect for that moment when you look at browning bananas in the bowl & contemplate freezing them for later, or whipping something up ASAP.  Go for the immediate!  They are filling, tasty, and great with any meal, or as a snack.  Husband ate one with breakfast, kids are them with lunch, I'm gonna gobble one down before bedtime.  All to say, a dozen will fly quickly out of your kitchen.  Very easy to make; classic taste to repeat!

I liked these muffins, very easy for my 3 yr old to help me with. I used 1 1/4 C whole wheat flour, and 1/4 C Bran, reduced the sugar to 1/2 C and added some choc chips into the dry mixture. I made mini muffins and they were really good. Need to try it with the apple sauce instead of the butter ( i didn't have any at home..). Will make again many more times....

I just finished making these muffins and they are so good! I put two eggs instead of one by accident, but I don't notice anything catastrophic. I also cut down on the sugar. It has very good banana flavor! I also added the tsp vanilla, cinnamon, and a bit of nutmeg. Thanks for the recipe, I'm going to have another!

Great recipe, easy to throw together with what's usually onhand.  I substituted 1/2 cup oatmeal for that much of the flour and added a few tablespoons of wheat germ and flaxseed, and about half a cup of mini chocolate chips.  They turned out great!

Just made these and they were great. I did have some blueberries on hand so added some to half the batter and chocolate chips (for the kids) to the other half.   My bananas were small so used 4 of them. Very yummy & so easy!

These muffins are amazing!  I didn't bother sifting the dry ingredients as I didn't really feel it was necessary.  Once the batter was in the muffin tins, I topped them with brown sugar.  Very moist and had a great flavor.

I enjoyed this recipe a lot!  I did make a lot of substitutions, in attempt to make it as healthy as possible - it still ended up being very tasty!  Here are the changes I made: For the flour I substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour and 0.5 cup all purpose flour.  I ended up using 4 (fairly large) bananas.  For the sugar, I used 0.5 cup splenda and  0.25 cup (maybe a little less) brown sugar.  For the butter, I used 0.5 cup unsweetened applesauce.  I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 0.5 teaspoon nutmeg.  I would have added vanilla extract, but I was out.  This made 12 largish muffins.  Once cool, I 'iced' each with some fat free vanilla yogurt, and sprinkled them with toasted walnuts and toasted shredded coconut.

They are just great and so moist.  I love that they don't have all the spices in them.  Simple and kids will eat them.  My 9 year old made them.

Wonderful muffins!  Recipe is perfect like it is, but for those who grind their own wheat...they are good with 100% whole wheat, too.  I added 3/4 cup toasted, chopped pecans.  When doubling the other ingredients, I forgot to double the sugar (I used dark brown) and they were still great! I also added 1 tbs. cinnamon.

This was a great recipe.  Very easy. I changed it a little bit and my husband said they were very good.  Instead of the butter, I substitued applesauce.  I also added some cinnamon and vanilla extract.  lastly, I added some butterscotch morsels about 1/4 cup and they were terrific.  So easy!

Oh my goodness!  I've never rated any recipes on this site before, but these were so good that I had to give it five stars!  I've made several types of banana muffins before, but this is the best by far!  I topped them with a little sugar and cinnamon and it gave them a nice little crunchy topping.  Yum:)

This was THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!  I did make a few changes.  Instead of the butter I used 1/3 Cup of Pure Pumpkin Puree.  I also used 1 Cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 Cup White flout (just to add some more nutrion to it).  I added 1/2 Cup of walnuts.  Mmmmmmmmm!!  It is now going to replace my old recipe.  My husband also rated them a 10!!!  Thanks!!

These are very yummy but I tweaked it a bit.  I doubled the recipe so these replacements are for that. I used 1C Whole Wheat flour in place of 1C all purpose. I cut the sugar to 1/2C and used 1/2C homemade pearsauce in place of the butter. You could use applesauce. If you use a fruit sauce bake for the whole 15 minutes. These are very tasty!!

I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Baked 3 dozen mini muffins.  My 4yr old has eaten HALF of them by himself in two days.  It's a good recipe.  Very easy and flexible.

These were GREAT! I used whole wheat flour instead of white, and 4 banannas (thats how many i had going mushy in the produce drawer!)
1/2 the batter got chopped pecans, 1/2 the batter didn't, and OOOH what a yummy treat!

It was good. Very  moist. I followes some of the reviews and added 1tsp vanilla, 1tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I did forget to add salt (oops) and it still turned out good. I made 1/2 the recipe with nuts and without nuts (my husband doesn't like nuts in his bread) they were both good either way. thanks

These were really great-simple and delicious.  I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 1/4 tsp. ground cloves, and about 1/4 tsp. of freshly ground nutmeg.  I also substituted oil for the butter in the recipe as it was all I had on hand.  Turned out great!

Fantastic! So easy to put together, and they turned out wonderfully. About 10 minutes before they were done, I topped a few with cinnamon sugar, a few with chocolate chips, and a few with brown sugar and put them back in the oven to finish. I'll definitely be making these again.

DELICIOUS!!! Whole fam loves them! The first time, I followed directions exactly - 2nd time I used 2.5T butter & 2.5T applesauce instead of all butter to cut down on fat. Worked great. They freeze really well - when you want to use them, let them thaw for 10 min. or so, then wrap in foil and put in 350degree oven for 15 min.  I used the convection function on my oven and baked them at 325 degrees for 18 min. We'll be making this recipe often!

Verrrry light and moist! These are wonderful! I might just use this as my main banana bread (loaf) recipe! One reviewer stated these are not as dense as they would like; personally, I LOVE the light and fluffy texture! I made them AS IS. No additions or substitutions. The recipe made exactly 24 mini muffins. I don't know how someone got 48?! Perhaps because I fill my mini's to the top of the tin? They *do* bake a bit longer than the specified 10 minutes ~ I went about 13 and that was perfect! Again, could be because I filled them to the top! A keeper for sure! Thanks for sharing!

SO GOOD!! These were amazing. I used half of the butter and 1/3 cup of applesauce. I also added cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, and half whole wheat flour. 
Warm out of the oven with a bit of butter... heaven.

AWESOME.  Just added some cinnamon.  These would be easy to add experiment with, by adding different nuts or chocolate chips and the like.  We frosted ours with peanut butter.  Absolutely delicious!

Wonderful recipe! I've made these a bunch of times and every time they come out great!
A few tips...
-use over ripe bananas- the riper, the better
- stir the wet and dry ingredients as little as possible, just till combined - stirring too much makes the muffins dry and tough

I loved the basics of this recipe but I just couldn't help but mess with it.  I was out of eggs in the house but substituted 2 tbsp cornstarch instead...seems to have worked just fine.  I also did half white flour and half wheat flour as well as half/half white and brown sugar.  I threw in about 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, a dash of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla YUM YUM!! Will definitly make again!

Wow, I've never made muffins before, and this recipe was a wonderfully easy one to follow.  I had small/medium sized bananas and so I used four.  Very banana-y and tasty, but not too sweet.  Great recipe.

I was looking for a good, basic banana muffin base recipe, and this was the winner. The muffins were just right when I made them according to directions, without changing a thing. They were even tastier the second time around, when I added cinnamon, walnuts, and 1/3 cup of mini chocolate chips/white chocolate chips.

Yummy!  I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1tsp cinnamon.  Very moist and delicious!  The kids loved them and the recipe did make slightly more than 12 regular sized muffins.  Super! Thanks!!

I have never had success w/ baking before.  I did this repice yesterday and followed others suggestions adding the 1tsp vanilla, 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 cup crushed pecans and I addded a bag of white chololate chips.  I also put a half pecan on the top of each muffin to make it look pretty.  It was a hit.  My step daughter who is a picky eater wants to make them again today.  My husband took a dozen to work and they were gone in seconds, people were asking for the recipe.  For someone who can't bake, this recipe made me a star!.  They were moist and had the big tops just like a bakery.  Thank you.

These are delicious.  The batter is just the right amount to fill 12 baking cups, if you fill them to the top.  I am used to filling a baking cup only 2/3 full, so I was skeptical about filling them so full.  I was pleasantly surprised when they came out perfectly.  They are flatter than other muffins, but they are moist and super tasty.  Another thing I should mention, mine were very done in 20 minutes.  It could be my oven, but others may want to check sooner than the 25-30 mins.

I only had 2 bananas, so I added 1/4 cup of squash puree (we roast butternut squash, puree it and freeze it in individual lumps, then bag it once it's frozen) and a pinch of nutmeg.  My wife/son's playgroup ate all but 3 muffins (made 24 mini-muffins).  Wonderful recipe!

I give this recipe 5 stars because they taste good, were very easy for my son and I to make together and it was a great way to use up those old bananas sitting on  my counter!  Oh, I did add some vanilla to the batter and my son insisted on adding some chocolate chips on the top :)

These are the best banana muffins!  I add 1 tsp. vanilla and only put about half of the butter and added 3 spoonfuls of sour cream.  They were so moist and yummy, it gives you exactly 12 muffins without wasting any batter.  My kids loved them!  By the way for the people who said they didn't have a lot of banana flavor, you have to let them get really ripe and they will have a ton of flavor.

WOW!  I added some choc chips (about half a bag), a dash of cinammon and a dash of vanilla  and walnuts sprinkled on top and it was a huge hit!  I am going to make these again soon!  They're almost gone already and I made them less than an hour ago.  PLUS, my 2 year old and 18 month old love them too...

Wonderfully kid friendly recipe!  It takes good old fashioned elbow grease to mash the bananas, which my boys LOVE.  
I found that if we use room temp butter and mash it with the sugar, bananas and egg, the muffins come out with a much more pleasant texture.  Further, I used 1 full cup of sugar, followed the 1tsp cinnamon and 1/4tsp nutmeg advice omitting the vanilla.  
In the words of my percosious 4 year old:  "MMMM they're very banana-eee!"

Fantastic!  My 5 year old son suggested cinnamon, so we added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of vanilla, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  My husband said it was the best banana bread he has ever tasted, and then polished off almost the entire batch, much to our son's dismay.

I got halfway through the baking time on these muffins before I realized that I had not added the sugar.  It was a hectic morning and I had been trying to get these done for breakfast.  I thought they were going to be horrible w/o the sugar, but luckily I had added 1/3 cup of mini chocolate chips.  And, they were actually quite good.  The ripe bananas and the chocolate chips sweetened it enough.  Next time, if I have my head on straight, I think I will add some sugar (maybe 1/4 cup.)  They were very good and super easy to make.  It also appeared that there was too much dry mixture, but I mixed until it was just all wet and they baked up light and fluffy.

I didn't want mine to be too sweet. So I put only 1/2 cup of white sugar and 2 Tbsp of milk and it turned out perfect for my taste. Oh! and like some other reviewrs I added 3/4 tsp of cinnamon, vanilla extract and 1/2 cup of chopped walnut. 
Thank you for sharing the great recipe! :)

it's okay, i can somehow taste the baking powder.  maybe i should have mixed it thoroughly, but i didn't want to overbeat the batter because it might be rubbery.

Used brown sugar instead and added cinnamon and vanilla extract for lustre, but overall the general recipe was simple and delightful!

I made these two days ago.. I followed the recipe exactly and then added a handful of chocolate chips...Yummy! 

Tonight I used this same recipe but instead of bananas I chopped up four small apples and sauteed them in the butter until they were soft. For the wet ingredients I had this apple and butter mix, 1 single serving container of applesauce, cinnamon, and vanilla mixed with the egg and sugar. Everything else was the same. So good! Would be good witha streusel topping too!

I too was attracted to this recipe for it's simplicity.  Basic ingredients that we all have on hand.  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and chocolate chips.  Awesome!  Will make again and again.  Thanks!

Excellent, moist and not too many ingredients.  Next time I will cut back a bit on the salt as I thought they had a salty flavour.

This recipe was good. Like other readers, I added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  I am only giving it 4 stars because I have had better.

Great banana muffins, even if I tweaked it a bit. I added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. I also added a crumb topping and they were even more delish...
I made a different batch for my students and they were asking for seconds, good thing I made a double batch.

These muffins are wonderful!  I doubled the recipe to make 24 muffins.  As I didn't have enough butter, I substituted 1/3 cup applesauce for 1/3 cup butter (my dog got on the counter and ate my butter!  He loves butter).  Also added the 1 tsp. vanilla + 1 tsp cinnamon.  I added 1 cup chopped walnuts too.

Great texture - I only had two large bananas. Takes well to substituting some whole wheat flour. Added cinnamon, nutmeg and a little vanilla. These won the "keeper" recipe status in our house.

These muffins are great. I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips like another reviewer suggested and they were so tasty. All the ingredients blended very nicely together. The key is to not over mix the batter (as with all muffin recipes) and these should turn out great each time.

I always make cranberry yogurt muffins, partly cause I love them and mainly cause I can never find any other good recipes. WELL - these muffins are excellent. I made mine with all whole wheat flour and replaced the sugar with slenda. I also kept parts of the banana quite chunky which made them really tasty. Thanks for the great recipe :)

Yummy and easy to make - I had all the ingredients in my kitchen!  I substituted Splenda for some of the sugar (I used 1/2 C sugar and 1/4 C Splenda) and no one could tell there was artificial sweetener in them.  Will make again!

Great recipe.  I did a few subs.  I halved white and brown flour.  1/4 c. white, 1/4 brown sugar.  I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, dash of nutmeg and 1 tsp. vanilla.  I used 1/2 the butter and the other half I used pineapple juice.  I also added 1/2 can of crushed pineapples.  My husband and 2 year old loved this recipe. I will be making this recipe again and again.

I loved how little prep was needed.  My family loves these muffins.  Once I added a few mini chocolate chips to the top before baking.  Those were a huge hit.

Excellent! I did however omit the butter and add one more banana. We also added 1/4 tsp of vanilla and 3/4 cup of chocolate chips. My two year old ate 2 muffins and my VERY picky hubby ate 3!! These were a huge hit!

OH. MY. GOSH. The best banana muffin recipe-in my opinion- EVER CREATED! I have made this recipe countless times and only tweak it to add some chocolate chips and i bake them in the mini muffin tins (its the perfect size for a  quick snack). Everyone who has them says they are delicious! BEWARE: they are addicting and you may have one..or two.. or three.. more than originally planned. But well worth it :)

Delicious. After reading the reviews I made the following changes:
substituted 1/2 C of the flour with oats, used 1/3 C white sugar and 1/4 brown (could probably even use less) and added a teaspoon of vanilla. i also add chocolate or carob chips, but they are so good on their own they really don't need it. also, i don't use an electric mixer. i like the consistency of the muffin when i stir the ingredients by hand.

Muffins turned out very moist and delicious! I subsituted butter for vegetable oil and used half whole wheat flour. Along with other suggestions I added cinammon and nutmeg as well as raisins. Very good! Best muffin recipe I've used in a while

I love this recipe. It has an amazing texture. I added a dash of cinnamon and vanilla and drops of honey to the batter. I love the crunchy texture of the top and the moistness of the middle. Five stars, although the flavor was still a little bland, and you couldn't really taste the bananas. Next time, I think I'll add more or mash it up less.

I loved this recipe. I chose to use very ripe bananas so that they would be sweet enough because I added a cup of walnuts to the recipe that were finely grinded and also chunks. Very yummy and the neighboors loved them too. I have made this as a bread loaf as well, I cooked it for 1 hour and it came out very good.

Wonderful recipe - however, I've made some adjustments:  I used all brown sugar, and substituted 1/2 cup of flour with whole wheat flour.  This gave the muffins an earthy nutty flavour.  Will be making them again (this time adding some cinnamon and cloves) - they make a great snack.

This was an easy recipe which was enjoyed by my 3 teenagers and their friends. Next time, just for a little added flavour, I would follow the advice of some other reviewers and maybe spice it up a bit with cinnimon or nutmeg.

Very good, moist (even though I added about 1/4 cup applesauce & used only 4 Tbs. butter) and also vanilla & added 1/2 Cup chopped walnuts to suit my desires!  YUM.  Chocolate chips would be super, too.  (an idea: add about 3 Tbs. strong coffee to the mashed bananas, makes it rich!)
I give it a 4 because I doctored up mine & feel they wouldn't have been as sensational as is. Great base recipe & extremely simple for kids to handle.

This is a great recipe for the kids.  I added a cup of milk chocolate chips and crushed 1/2 cup of bran buds in the batter.  I used my mini muffin tin  and cooked them for 10 minutes in my convection oven at 325. Great recipe.

A very moist and light muffin.  I added an extra egg and banana and also some wheat germ and oats and some pecans.    I also sprinkled them with sugar cinnamon when they can out of the oven. They're great for breakfast.

A tender and delicious muffin. I was looking for as simple a recipe as possible since my "helper" was a 3 year old. I added about 1/2 cup chocolate chips so I reduced the sugar to a generous 1/2 cup and the butter to 5 tbsp (just under 1/3 cup). I made these into mini muffins and baked for 15 minutes. Perfect! I love a simple recipe that comes out great.

I reviewed these before and only gave them 4 stars... This time, I am giving them 5 stars for the great banana flavor-perhaps last time they were not big bananas. I did add cinnamon and vanilla and once again, I doubled this to put some up in the freezer. I used half cinnamon for the margerine/butter. Right out of the oven, good, moist, great flavor...I imagine thawed from the freezer the flavors will be even better!

I just tried one of these muffins,warm from the oven, and it was great! I used an extra banana, brown sugar instead of white and margarine instead of butter. I also added a tsp. of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla. They would have probably been sweeter if I had used white sugar but I don't think sweeter is necessarily better. They were done in 25 mins. I will make these again.

Excellent muffin!  BUT, what's a banana muffin without cinnamon??  I added cinnamon, nutmeg & vanilla as others suggested and the end result.....they are almost gone and they aren't even cool yet.  Thanks for the great start up Abi!

I loved them! Tastes great. I added the tsp of cinnamon and tsp of vanilla. I may have undercooked mine, they were a bit sticky on top when they cooled off but didn't stick to the muffin liners.

This was an excellent muffin.  Made them this morning for breakfast with the kids and grandkids, and they were still warm when they came over.  Made 12.  The only things I can say about this recipe is to use Pam for Baking when you are spraying the muffin tins and they come right out.  Also, I didn't beat until smooth after I added the flour - I just beat until the dry stuff was incorporated.  I've found that beating until smooth leaves big holes in the muffins.  I will use this recipe for banana muffins forevermore.  Thanks!!!

This is the BEST recipe for banana muffins I have ever made.  They are simple to make and delicious.  I made 2 dozen and they were gone the next day!  For those who have said they had problems with them obviously don't bake much.  They are fool proof!  A++++++++++

Very easy and tasty!  They are very sweet, so I would cut the sugar back a little next time.  I added pecans and they were excellent!

I made these last night and they were delicious! So easy, also. I used 4 medium bananas and used 'can't believe it's not butter' to make it a bit "healthier." Adding some cinnamon to the tops was a great tip! Make these!

I just finished making this and it turned out better than I expected considering that I'm not that much of a great baker. I did alter the recipe a bit so instead of using butter, I used apple sauce and I susbituted half the white sugar with brown sugar. It did turn out pretty tasty, which really surprised me.

I may not be making this recipe again though, but it's because my family does not like baked goods as much as I do.

HOLY 5 Stars!!!!!!!!  Yum!  These muffins have great flavor and are sooooooooo moist!  Although it didn't seem like I made a lot of changes, apparently I did.  Here goes- 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 5 bananas, 1/2c walnuts, and 1/3 cup applesauce instead of the butter.  I've tried a lot of banana bread recipes, this is, BY FAR, the easiest and has the best flavor.  Thanks so much!!!!!!

These are amazing! I used all whole wheat flour & split the 3/4 cup sugar into 6 tbsp Splenda & 6 tbsp brown sugar. I used applesauce for the oil & added 1 tsp cinn & 1 tsp vanilla. The cinn is very vital to the wonderful combo of flavors of banana & cinnamon. A keeper for sure; thanks so much!

Excellent banana muffins or as banana bread. Also good with 3/4 cup of walnuts. Make sure NOT to over mix or they can get dense.

These were really good muffins..especially straight out of the oven. very moist and fluffy.  The next day they are still pretty good if you warm them up and slather butter on them!  I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of 3/4 cup white.  Also added an exra 1/2 banana.

Easy and fun to make with my 2 1/2 year old. He loves it especially when I make them in my muffin top baking pan - all his friends at school think they're cookies. I also use less sugar than called for and substitute with wheat flour - the kiddo is none the wiser. Thanks for this recipe!

In the words of my 2.5 year old, "Mmm!  That's 'licious!"  These were great!  Very easy to make, and just as easy to eat and enjoy!
I used half whole wheat flower and half regular white flour and added a little extra banana in there for good measure 
Thanks for a winner!

These were so moist!  They were the best mini muffins I have ever had. I used the teaspoon of vanilla,teaspoon of cinnamon,substituted splenda for the sugar, and left out the nuts.  Almost perfect, but next time I'll add the nuts and use more banana because I like a really strong banana flavor.

Really good. I cut the sugar in half just 'cz we try to cut back on sugar where we can and they were still very good. I like the fact that they have no oil in them. I, too, added one teaspoon cinnamon and one teaspoon vanilla as some suggested.

I was looking for an alternative to banana bread and stumbled upon this recipe.  I had lots of bananas and made 48 muffins and brought them into work.  They were an instant hit and were gone almost immediately.  Thanks for the recipe! It's great!

AWESOME muffins!  Very tasty and super moist.  I have made the recipe exactly as written, as well as with some of the suggestions (like cinnamon & vanilla) - either way theses muffins turn out great!

Yummy, yummy, yummy. I misplaced my family recipe for Banana Nut Muffins and now I've replaced it with this one. They are really good! Add some nuts, some vanilla and definitely some cinnamon.

This recipe is so good and SOOOO easy!  It is perfect for those last three over-ripe bananas that no one will eat.  We use a small, lunch-box sized applesauce instead of the melted butter, and the muffins are just as good.

This is the best banana muffins recipe. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, 1 extra egg and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and it came out perfect. Thank you for the great recipe, Abi.

The texutre of these muffins is almost "cake-like"; they're delicious! A lot lighter than most banana muffin, and not too sweet.

I also added an extra banana, cinnimon, and vanilla extract.

I wish I could give these more than five stars!  These are better than banana bread!  I made mini muffins and got about 36 large minis.  Next time I will not fill up the cups to the top  because they rise quite a bit and all ran together.  But the taste is EXCELLENT!!!!

I have tried several banana muffin recipes and these are BY FAR the best!  They are very easy to make and I made only a few modifications: eliminated the salt, used an extra banana, added one teaspoon of vanilla and a few shakes of cinnamon.  Next time I will double the batch because this first group of 12 was gone in a hurry!  Many thanks, Abi  :)

I have baked and cooked all day and I am exhausted. I hope I do my review justice tonight. These muffins turned out beautifully. I subbed a 4 oz cinnamon applesauce (the kind you would pack in a lunch) instead of the butter. I used bananas that were overripe. I added 1.5 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla. I filled 12 muffin cups almost all the way to the top. These didn't rise very much but turned out delicious and pretty. Thank you for the post :-)

These were great! It doesn't say how much to fill the muffin tins, so fill them up to the top! I didn't add chocolate chips but that would have been a good idea! I would definitely make these again.

The best banana muffins I´ve ever tasted. My recipe yielded only 10 large muffins, but they were just PERFECT! I added 1 tablespoon vanilla extract and 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon to the batter. Will definitely be making this recipe over and over YUMMY!!!

These come out so moist and fluffy (and they're not too high in fat)!  I love them!  I did, however, make a few adjustments.  I used 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin in place of bananas, added cinnamon and vanilla extract, and sprinkled brown sugar and pecans on top.  Even without these changes, I think these muffins would still merit a 5 star rating.  You won't regret making them!

I have tried many banana muffin recipes and this one is my favorite.  Muffins are light and moist.  Perfect.
I added about 3/4 c. pecans and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon but otherwise followed recipe.  Great Muffins!

This is the second time I am reviewing this recipe, because today I goofed and the recipe turned out even better than usual.  It was the end of the day and I was pooped and I didn't feel like melting the butter so I used the same amount of vegetable oil.  They turned out great.  And they were a little more moist than usual.  I use this same recipe to make really great pumpkin muffins, too.  I just replace the banana with pumpkin.  I triple the recipe and use a large can of pumpkin puree.  But for a single batch, I would probably use about a cup and a half.  I topped them with a simple crumb topping.  (I used the topping from the Blueberry muffins To Die For from this site.)  The pumpkin are the current favorite muffin at the shop.

These were delish.  I used 3 good sized bananas from my freezer (does anyone else do this?  I always end up with one really over-ripe banana from my bunch so I toss it in my banana-bag in the freezer.  They're perfect for making banana breads with- just thaw a few out, and slip them out of their skins! Warning though, they WILL turn black, but don't let it worry you!).  I think I could have used another one and it wouldn't have hurt.  I also threw in about a cup of fresh blueberries since I had a bunch to use up and that was yummy but they would have been just fine without! Just like little wee banana loaf but without the hour + in the oven.  This is my new banana breakfast treat!

I really like this recipe. My husband hates muffins that are "cakey" and this one is not. I tripled the recipe & had a few extra bananas so I used them (more moist?) and threw in a few chocolate chips, but it would be perfectly fine without the chips. Very moist and not at all "cakey"!

I just made these and they are AMAZING! The only thing I added (like most others) was a tsp. of vanilla extract. I also added some chopped walnuts to half of them. It made 12 large muffins, and I baked them for 20 minutes. Thanks for the great recipe I will be using over and over. My picky 3 year old daughter even loves them!

This is a great recipe. I made it twice in one day. However I added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon cinnamon to the recipe along with 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. My kids really loved it. This will be one of our favorites.

These muffins were fantastic!  I made them according to the original recipe by Abi--not sure how you can honestly rate them when you add or take out other ingredients...but I guess  that's just me!  I made both the large and mini muffins and both batches came out perfect! My kids like it for 'dessert'!  Thanks so much Abi!

Very excellent!  I used the suggestions of halfing the flour with outmeal and also added a very heaping tsp of cinnamon.  A few chocolate chips were added for the kids but would be great without them as well.  The few that I hid for myself were still supermoist at day 3.

I made two variations of this recipe and they were both excellent.  The first batch the only changes I made was to add 1 tsp. of vanilla and it only took 19 mins to cook.  The second batch (for my kids) I substituted oatmeal for 1/2 of the flour, substituted brown sugar for half the white sugar, added a cup of raisins, 1 tsp. of vanilla, 1 tsp. of cinnamin.  Both great recipes, just the right amount of banana and not too sweet.  Hope you enjoy!!!

Absolutely delicious. Very easy to make. I had my two year old son help and we had a great time. Wonderful! I did add the 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg that I saw in other reviews!

these were delicious muffins and really easy to make! i looked at other people's reviews and added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg! they turned out great! i wasnt sure if i should add the chocolate chips or not, because i didnt think everyone would like them, so i just put some chocolate chips in a bowl next to the muffins so that people could add their chocolate chips if they wanted them.  i cut my muffin in half and placed chocolate chips in the middle and since they were hot out of the oven it melted and gave it a delicious taste!

Great flavour and quick to make! I always double this one because it goes so fast, and make a few modifications. I use half white, half whole wheat flour, and half brown and half white sugar, plus 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. My family loves these.

Excellent recipe!  If you're looking to whip up some banana muffins in a hurry, this is the recipe for you.  It's quick and easy, and the muffins taste great.

My *only* hang-up (and it's a minor one) is the muffins' appearance-- mine were flat on the top.  But they tasted wonderful, so I'm not complaining!

This recipe is wonderful.  I mixed the white sugar with brown, about 1/2.  I added a dash of vanilla, 1 cup chocolate chips and about 1/4 cup chopped walnuts and I also increased the butter to 1/2 cup.  Baked for about 25 minutes and they're scrumptious

Fantastic!!! I would give these 10 stars with the additions I made. Since I am eating low carb, I substituted 2/3 of the flour with whole wheat bran. The muffins were extremely moist and delicious! Instead of sugar, I used the same amout of loose Splenda. I also used Smart Balance Spread in place of the butter. I added an extra banana, 1 tsp. of cinnamin, 1 tsp. of vanilla and 3/4Cup of chopped walnuts. My 2 year old daughter helped me and they were easy and cooked perfectly in 20 minutes. I used the regular size muffin cups. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Just updating my review, I wanted to thank "Abi" for sharing this delicious recipe.  I have been making these muffins for almost 2 years now, at least once a month (I always seem to have some over ripe bananas left over)  They are soooo good, and simple to make, 5 minutes to stir up and then into the oven, so easy.  My little guy who is 4 has literally grown up on these and loves helping me make them (and eat them)!  Sometimes I drizzle some of the leftover melted butter over the muffins and sprinkle with brown sugar before I put them in the oven. MMMM!!!!  So, thank you Abi, I no longer need to refer to the recipe, as I have made them so often!

These are very moist and scrumptious.  I agree with previous posts and think they could use a little vanilla and some walnuts, though.  Otherwise, no complaints...they turned out perfect.

This is a 5 star recipe!  I usually don't like reviews (especially bad reviews) of recipes that have been changed significantly, however in this case it turned out WONDERFULLY and I truly believe it's because the core recipe was wonderful.  I substituted half of the all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour and I "sprinkled" chocolate chips and peanut butter chips on top (to make it more kids friendly, however it probably didn't need it, as well as these turned out).  My four children absolutely loved them.  I sifted the flours twice to ensure they were mixed well with the baking soda/powder and salt. It only took 18 minutes to cook but I divided them into 17 muffins.  I read one review that said they didn't rise well...I think they should check the freshness of their soda/powder, as I didn't have ANY problems with them rising.  A quick easy, and inexpensive breakfast!!!  Thank you for sharing!!!

These muffins are wonderful! Very moist and great right out of the oven, letting them cool for about 15-20 minutes.  I used about 4 medium sized bananas, and substituted 1/3 cup vegetable oil for the butter (because I realized I didn't have any!)  I think they are great!

I just made these muffins.  Although they were very good, light, moist and spongy, they didn't seem to rise very much at all.  I suggest you make maybe 6-8 muffins, and fill the batter right to the top of the muffin tin or past.  I added some vanilla and a little splash of milk, and turn my oven down to 325 once I put them in.  Also, they would probably also be very good with some dried cranberries.

These muffins were great! I did add some cinnamon and vanilla. Our 4 year old had 2 of these at dinner, and they were also a big hit with out 9 and 12 year old as well. They are easy to make, and they really do make 12 good size muffins. We will be making these a lot I'm sure! Thanks!

These were pretty yummy and a nice way to use up old bananas. I made them in my countertop mini muffin baker and they came out perfect in 4 minutes. I'd make these again but might add some vanilla and cinnamon and maybe some chopped nuts. Thanks for the recipe.

The first time I followed the directions exactly and the muffins were great.  The next time I made them I doubled the recipe using half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I added a little cinnamon and vanilla.  To the batter I also added some milk chocolate chips and chopped walnuts.  We couldn't stop eating them.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These are the best banana muffins I've tried, I make them at least once a week. I did add some vanilla and choc chips, although they're great without the choc too! Thanks Abi!

These muffins were fantastic!  I changed the recipe slightly by using 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar in place of only white sugar.  I also added 1/3 cup semi sweet chocolate chips and 1/3 cup pecans.  There turned out wonderfully moist and super tasty!  I will definitely make these again!  Delicious!

I've been searching for a moist banana muffin recipie that my children will like.  Tried lots but they were all too dry.  This one was YUMMY!  Even my picky 6 year old liked it and wants to take it to school for class snack time.  I added 1/4 cup chocolate chips and a tsp. of vanilla like the board suggests.  I only had medium sized bananas so I added 3 heaping tablespoons of unsweetened applesauce.  Great recipie!

We loved these! I used half wheat flour & froze some & heat them up for my 18 month old. I added cinnamon to half.  They were still good but I think it masked the banana flavor. I think next time I will leave it out. Great recipe!

I have been making these twice a week because everyone enjoys them so much.  Sometimes I make them for breakfast, sometimes for dessert in the evening.  The muffin is the perfect size for the kids plus travels well for lunch.

awesome! very moist!... i added 1 tsp vanilla, 3/4 tsp cinnamon and 3/4 cup chopped walnuts and an extra banana. maybe my banana's weren't ripe enough. i'm waiting for my parents and sister to get home, though so they can try them. i still think they're yummy though and have eaten 4 of my small muffins already =P next time i'll add 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of only 3/4 and i'll wait until my banana's are almost black...

Thanks,Abi,for the best banana muffins I've ever eaten. I added vanilla & cinnamon, too but they would be just as good without.  Next time,I'll leave the bananas a liitle chuncky rather than smooth. Great banana flavor, moist, tender & light as a feather. Loved them!!!

Great basic recipe! I added some cinnamon like a lot of other people have suggested, and since I only had two bananas, I added ~1/4 cup of orange juice for a little more liquid. They turned out great!

THESE ARE AMAZING.  My family and I are in love with them. We have made these SO many times!  As written, these are so great, but we do add thigs, as many others have. I add 2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the dry mix. I also add 2 tsp vanilla extract to the wet mix. After BARELY combining the wet and dry ingredients, I add 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips.,and fold in gently. DO NOT OVER-MIX the batter. Fill mini muffin/cupcake liners about 3/4 full. Makes 48 mini muffins.

This is a really simple and delicious banana bread recipe. I followed it as written except I added about 3/4 cup   chopped walnuts. Yum!  So good!  I used a silicone muffin pan and sprayed it with Pam. I baked for 20 minutes and they browned up nicely and were super moist and not a bit undercooked. If you are looking for a simple recipe with simple ingredients that you probably already have, this is a good one to try.

These are so good!  I used a scant measure of both the baking soda and  baking powder and used oil instead of butter.   I used three large bananas and substituted part of the white sugar with brown.  Since my batter was runny (too much banana maybe), I turned back the heat to 345 so the bottoms wouldn't brown too much and baked them a little longer .  Perfect!

I think this recipe is a great starter point for banana bread. I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 2 extra eggs, and 1/2 a cup of butter instead of the 1/3. I recommend whipping your egg whites to stiff peaks and folding them into the wet ingredients for a fluffier bread. Will be making again!

Any time I have over-ripe bananas I try to remember to make these.  I add honey and a little less sugar but I do add chocolate chips every time.  These are so delicious my family of 5 will go through a dozen in one day - I usually double the recipe just to get into day 2!!!  Definitely recommend!!!

These are perfectly moist with just enough banana flavor to not be overwhelming, but still taste the banana. I added half a cup of chopped pecans and they were the best banana muffins I've ever had!

Moist and fluffy! We added chocolate chips and ate them while the chocolate was still gooey. As advertised they were easy for kids to make - my 7 year old made them almost all by himself, much to his delight.

Omgness!!! So yummy! I followed the directions exactly as stated for making them. Finishing touch I sprinkled a mixture of cinnamon and sugar in each muffin space and then on top of dough! 
I used a mini muffin pan and done in 12 minutes!

I added about 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. Also, the normal size muffins were cooked in 20 min not the 25-30 min the recipe called for.  I also used liners and sprayed them with cooking spray so the muffin didn't stick to them.

These turn out great every time. I add a teaspoon of vanilla and about a half cup of chopped walnuts (or a quarter cup black walnuts) to the mix. I also sprinkle the tops of the batter with a cinnamon, sugar, and nutmeg mixture. And then I push blueberries in the top of the batter until just covered.

I followed the recipe and they came out great, we loved them, I just added a tsp of vanilla extract.
Did another batch south beach diet phase 2 friendly for my husband, just used whole wheat flour instead of the regular one and stevia instead of sugar, added some cashews  and they were delicious.

Just made a pan of these last night. Amazing!!! These are hands down the best muffins I’ve made. Slightly sweet, but not too sweet and perfect in texture. I added finely chopped walnuts and milk chocolate. The batter fit in twelve muffin cups perfectly. No waste. Will be keeping this recipe! Thank you!!!

This is the recipe I go back to every time. Reliably delicious as written. I like to scoop out the first 9 muffins as is and then add some oatmeal and walnuts to the batter for the last 3. That way I can make everyone happy!

Excellent recipe. An added tip. As bananas overripe put them in the freezer. When you have enough for the recipe thaw them out before using. Banana flavour really intensifies.

Easy to prepare. I used 50/50 White Flour / Almond Flour, also replaced 1/3 of the white sugar with Stevia extract. Plus a little pour of  vanilla extract. I also added Ghiradelli chocolate chips on top with about 1 minute left to cook.

These are hands down the BEST banana muffins I have ever made.  I followed other reviewers advice with the 1:2 tsp vanilla but also added a 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice (cinnamon, clove and a couple other things).  I also headed the other reviewers advise not to over mix...just enough to get wet.  Mine ended up perfect golden brown with a slightly sweet crisp “muffin top”.  I love the author has made this a “basic” recipe so I can make them my own.

Wonderful basic recipe and easy to customize . I added some toasted cashews and ginger. Subbed coconut oil for the butter and as it is dry where I live so added a bit of milk. Perfect quick muffin to use up leftover fruit and nuts.

Made this substituting egg for vegan egg replacer and added vegan chocolate chips. They actually rose well and looks awesome. For my oven, I would have cooked them closer to 23 minutes rather than 25-30.

My friends loved them. I added a 1/2 cup oatmeat because I didn't have enough flour and they came out tasting wonderful. I'm making them about once a week now. I think I will double the recipe though because it only makes 12 muffins.

Every few weeks I make banana muffins for my grandchildren to take with their school lunches.  I tried this particular recipe for the first time a couple of days ago. My daughter told me the muffins were awesome. I just got a message from my son-in-law saying they are the best muffins he has ever had. 
I did add a cup of chocolate chips to the batter. I will definitely be making these again.

Very delicious recipe.  I only added a tsp of vanilla extract.  Do not beat the ingredients.  That will make the muffins dense.

A seriously good recipe, a fave that I've made many times.

I'll add choc. chips, or nutmeg and cinnamon to it, depending on my mood.  And to shake things up a bit.  
I save some for the next day, in the fridge.  Otherwise, these muffins do disappear.

I add 1/3 cup of sugar to this, instead of 2/3.  Still a great recipe!

These muffins are terrific with the additions others have mentioned: a tsp of vanilla and a tsp of cinnamon. I also throw in a half cup of mini chocolate chips. Yummy! The grandkids love them.

I've made this recipe quite a few times and richly enjoyed it!
This time, I only had two banana and we were out of eggs, so I substituted both with applesauce. I also followed previous reviews and added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg , a splash of vanilla and a splash of milk. I also added walnuts and chocolate chips! (I know, major deviations)
To my pleasant surprise, they turned out perfectly, and a little more moist than usual. Definitely a staple recipe for my muffins!

I made a gluten/egg free version! I used gluten free flour. I also substituted apple sauce for the egg. Then to spice things up a bit I added 1/2 small chopped apple, crushed walnuts along with vanilla extract, and pumpkin pie spice. I used 1/2 the sugar it called for but added some maple syrup instead. Topped them with a dash of cinnamon. I made these in mini muffins. I highly recommend using a silicone muffin pans! They pop right out without any battle and no need for paper inserts! (I also made large muffins and followed the recipe except for using gluten free flour and added some walnuts.) My whole family loved them both!

Tastes great! I ended up using 4 average size bananas and it was perfect. I made a dozen regular size and 12 mini (two were sacrificed for taste as soon as they came out of the oven. Don’t judge!). Definitely a great recipe. All I added was a little vanilla cause I believe all baked goods need it.

Was looking for a muffin-ized, classic banana bread recipe bcs I don’t keep a recipe box anymore. This was perfect. Made my usual adjustments accumulated from family recipes: 0.5t ground nutmeg, an extra banana. Had enough batter for 12 muffins & half pan of minis. Both cooked in maybe 2/3 or 3/4 the recommended time (toothpick test!). Yummy and soft!

The base of this recipe was perfect. The texture was great and airy like a muffin and wasnt dry. I did add a tablespoon of milk, some nutmeg, vanilla and cinnamon for a little flavor though since I didnt have nuts to add. Also it might be my oven but I only had to bake mine for 18 minutes otherwise they would have been dry. Great recipe though!

These are excellent as is.  I found that making them again, this time with the addition of 1/2 cup brown sugar, gave them a more golden color and a crispier edge that we like.  I have a Wilton muffin top baking pan (makes JUST the top) and that’s my favorite way to make these tasty muffins.

These are moist,  flavourful, and a hit with my family. I reduced sugar to 1/2 cup, substituted oil instead of butter and added cinnamon. I got 10 
regular size muffins. Absolutely delicious ??

Great recipe! One of my favorites. Cut sugar by 1/4 cup and added chocolate chips and walnuts. Baked until tops were very brown, which made the tops crispy and the insides moist. Perfect with a glass of cold milk!

Really yummy and so quick and easy. Minus 1 star because I do think it requires additions to bring it up to 5 - I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1 tsp vanilla extract. 

I also ended up folding in some peanut butter chips I had on hand. I got 12 big muffins and they're delicious!

I make these for my partner all the time, he loves them. I use a full 1/2 cup of melted butter and I also add 1 tsp of cinnamon (you can't really taste the cinnamon but I find it levels out the taste).

Easy to make and very tasty! I followed the recipe exactly as written and baked up 40 mini muffins. I opted to spray my pan with olive oil and they cane out perfectly. Thank you for a great recipe!

First time I made it I didn't have butter at home, so I used extra light virgin olive oil. Since it came out great, I just kept using olive oil every since time since then.

Very good as-is! My rating is based on the original recipe, but I’ve made this recipe multiple times and modified it in different ways. Sometimes I halve the white sugar and add brown sugar, sometimes I add chocolate chips. I even forgot the butter one time and the muffins were still moose and delicious (albeit smaller). My family loves this recipe!

I made this recipe with these changes:
To make them healthier I used whole wheat flour
I used coconut sugar
In place of butter I used olive oil
And I added grounded walnuts grinder in the mini food processor 
Talk about delicious, healthy and filled with protein.
I doubled the batch and did half plain banana with the nuts and did sprinkle a bit of flour and sugar for the topping 
And the 2nd batch I did dark chocolate chips-healthier for a lil extra sweetness and antioxidants

I like to add cinnamon , and I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and used brown sugar. I also cut the butter a tad and use a little sour cream. My kids like it when I add peanut butter chips 1/2 cup or so.

This is my go-to banana muffin recipe! Some have said theirs turn out dry. My solution for that is to measure your banana. Make sure however many you use, it equals 2 cups mashed. It actually took 4 for me with the size I had. I also sprinkle coarse sugar on top before baking to give them a little extra specialness. You can include a half to a whole cup walnut pieces if you like nuts in yours as well!

This last time, I used whole wheat, added little cinnamon, and vanilla and that made them even better!  Total family favorite.

This is a simple and prefect recipe. I added 1 hefty tsp of cinnamon, 1 hefty tsp of vanilla, (meaning I over poured it and let it splash into the banana/egg mix) and a cup of chocolate chips.

I made 24 mini muffins, took about 20 minutes to bake. I added a handful of walnuts smashed inside a sandwich baggie. They are good and have a nice balance of sweetness and banana taste. Also interesting but not related, today I noticed for the first time the flour bag says don’t sneak a taste before it’s cooked as the flour is raw. Thought that was funny. And yes I licked the bowl, raw flour and all.

This has been my go to recipe for muffins for years. Great flavor and always come out perfect. If you ever have old bananas to use up, I highly suggest it. I always prefer doubling it whenever the grocery store is getting rid of old bananas. Usually I sub the melted butter for apple sauce mostly because it's easier and faster than melting butter. I also add a bit of cinnamon for some added flavor.

Perfect. I added some swedish vanilla sugar. But make sure you don't overcook them.  I cooked my muffins for 30 min instead. You cook to long they will get dry.

I lowered the sugar content a little and added in choc chips. So delicious that my fussy toddler finished up his muffin! My hubby agrees that this is good too. Easy to make and fast. Awesome for breakfast.

I used this recipe. I added 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Instead of 3/4 cup of sugar, I put 1/2 cup. Next time, I think I would put only 1/4 cup of sugar, cause the sweet bananas with the chocolate chips was sweet enough. I prefer to give less sugar for my kids, but I love chocolate. Lol!

I have made this recipe several times,  as is originally and with 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract (per the suggestion of others).  My two children (ages 6 and 1) LOVE these, and will eat the whole pan of a dozen in a day!  I'm a fan, too.

I’ve tried lots of other banana muffin recipes and ended up with oily, mushy muffins. But this has definitely been my go recipe to for a while. I love that it calls for butter rather than oil and if I get lazy I just throw the batter into a 9 inch pan to bake and cut into yummy squares! I do add vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon, of course!

This is a go-to recipe for me. I change the sugar to 150mL of honey and add an extra 0.5 tsp of baking soda and people can't tell there's white sugar in there. I also like to add some berries or nuts!

I had some bananas left over and decided to use them in a recipe. i picked this one and I'm glad i did. i added 1/4 tsp vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp cinnamon. I absolutely love the flavor and how moist they were. They baked for about 22mins, I think 25 would slightly overdue it. anyways next time I would probably add a little bit more cinnamon and banana for that extra oomf.

Perfect recipe for tasty banana muffins. I tripled this recipe and it did not disappoint. Both mini muffins and regular size muffins were moist, solid, and devoured by all whom they were distributed to. 
There was a few hours pause between baking batches and the later were as good as the first. I believe that means they can be prepped ahead of time, the night before baking.
I made this recipe a second time, and didn't have enough butter. I replaced the butter with 1/2 as much unsweetened apple sauce, and used turbinado sugar. Still excellent!
10 out of 10, would definitely recommend.

This is my go-to when I end up with over-ripe bananas.  I've made it dozens of times.  A few variations I like to use:  replace half or all of the butter with unrefined coconut oil.  It adds a sweet, coconut flavor.  The last time I made it, I also replaced the sugar with 1/2 c agave nectar.  Still plenty sweet, but a much lower glycemic index (less of a sugar crash). If you substitute agave, it tends to brown faster so I lowered the heat by 25 degrees.  

I've also added fruit such as blueberries, nuts, or mini chocolate chips on occasion to add some variety.

Absolutely delicious!! I’ve made these a few times, and each time, they got better. I just added a cup of chopped almonds (you could use walnuts or pecans too) and half a teaspoon of cinnamon. I also add a little dollop of hazelnut spread on top of the batter before I put it in the oven and spread it very lightly and then top it all of with some last chopped nuts. I gifted these to a very sick teacher and got so many compliments!! Great potluck or breakfast recipe!!!!

These muffins are wonderful! So moist and delicious!
I used four small ripe bananas, added some vanilla, used 1/2 C of white sugar and 1/4 C of brown sugar. I also sprinkled in some cinnamon. When I combined the ingredients, I added a combination of milk and dark Ghirardelli chocolate chips. Not too many, as they're pretty good-sized chips. Just enough that each muffin had a few.  I baked them for 24 mins and they turned out amazing.  These will be a great snack at work. YUM!

The original recipe was decent, but I found it was too sweet and too dense texture-wise, so I experimented somewhat. After many times tweaking the recipe, I found the best course of action is to add a tablespoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla extract; multiply the amount of butter by 1.5x; remove the soda altogether, and cut the amount of baking powder and the amount of sugar in half; substitute a quarter of the white sugar with light brown sugar; and slightly reduce the amount of flour. This produces a tasty result with a nice, fluffy texture.

Perfect basic recipe! I had frozen bananas on hand and those worked well. I was low on flour so substituted quick oats for about 1/4 cup. I also added a splash of vanilla and shook in some cinnamon. I'm all about CHOCOLATE so I added 3/4 cup chocolate chips and cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. They were perfectly sweet, moist, and delicious!

They’re so good! They’re moist and fluffy, the initial flavor and sweet and very fresh and then you get the undertones of salt and butter. 100/10 would eat every day

I used two bananas instead of three because that’s all I had and it turned out great regardless.

I wanted to like this, but didn’t.  I made per directions exactly.  With all the raving reviews, it must have been my per preferences.   Thank you for sharing the recipe as it was well received by the majority.

Love this recipe! It's easy and delicious. I replaced the butter with coconut oil as I have to avoid dairy. I made them with no mix-in's since I didn't have any, but will absolutely make them again and add some chopped pecans and mini chocolate chips! Thanks for sharing!

I do make some alterations to make it sugar free!!

I add in an extra banana, 3/4 splenda, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. 

I seriously get rave reviews everytime I make these!

Followed the recipe exactly and the batter was beautiful. I did add chopped walnuts and chia seeds to give them a little more nutrition and variety. This is a perfect muffin recipe!

I Love this recipe, and we always double it because we are a large family. However, I did make some modifications! Because I use Really Ripe Bananas, I only use 1/2c. of sugar (sometimes none...kids still eat them just fine!). I also use coconut oil and apple sauce in place of the melted butter. I also add vanilla extract and cinnamon to taste! These are great muffins, and with a few modifications my kids are eating a healthier, lower sugar breakfast treat!

I had 4 smaller bananas and I added about a tsp (if not more cause I eyeballed it) some cinnamon and it really gave them the extra surprise I was looking for: in these PERFECT banana muffins! Thanks so much for the recipe! Definitely will be making again!

These are so good! I add a little more banana to the recipe, and chocolate chips as well. They are super moist and keep really well for about a week...if they make it that long. I also cook the muffins for about 18 minutes and they come out perfectly, but it might be because my oven runs a little hotter.

Perfect recipe, super easy. I can’t say I tasted them cause they were gone in a day by my kiddos. I put chopped  walnuts in and I didn’t actually sift anything. I think I got about 16 muffins.

Super yummy! I used 4 bananas which had been frozen so I left them out overnight to thaw completely. I also used only 1/2 cup of sugar, since my bananas were older and therefore sweeter. I'm glad I did because even with 1/2 cup of sugar, they were aaaalmost too sweet. I also added 1/2 cup walnuts and a handful or two of semi-sweet chocolate chips.

I followed the complete recipe and made sure to mash the bananas a lot because I saw in a previous review the muffins turned out dry. I made sure to fold the dry and wet ingredients together just so there were no dry ingredients to be seen. This is a very basic recipe and I am 15 and was able to make this.  The batter had a medium level of banana flavor. I filled the muffin tins 3/4 of the way full. The muffins taste very well and I would give the taste five stars. The texture is pretty dry but they are still an enjoyable 3 stars. The top turned out crunchy. I made the larger ones.
Tip: only leave the larger muffins in for 20 min, or even less.

These were really good. I did add crushed walnuts and cinnamon in with the dry ingredients at the suggestions of others. In average sized muffin pans, my muffins took about 21 minutes and were baked perfectly.

Excellent recipe. I made a few changes. Used 2/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 white sugar. Left out nuts (because I'm making this for a bake sale), only had 2 bananas, so I replaced one with a couple tbs of apple butter and a dash of oil. 27 minute bake. It came out divine.

I omitted the baking soda because I had already started mixing the ingredients when I realized my baking soda was no good. I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla, a shake of nutmeg, allspice, and cinnamon. Baked 30 minutes at 325. I'm sure the recipe as written is great but I like how my changes came out.

Made with Ian today on his 4th bd!  Added walnuts: he and his fam loved them!  Have now made them many times... Once I was low on bananas and used an applesauce pouch instead of one.  They still got gobbled right up!

These were delicious!! I substituted 1 GoGo squeeze sized applesauce packet for the butter and didn't loose any taste. These were so moist. I also added 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of  chopped pecans.  I followed the rest of the recipe.

Great recipe! The muffins turn out really moist and super flavorful. I add vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon (and chocolate chips to half the batter, for my husband).

So good! Easy to make in a pinch and the whole family loves these. No changes made here, making these again as one dozen wasn’t enough for my tribe of 6.

I've made these muffins several times and they always turn out great. I like to add chocolate chips, because let's be honest, almost any baked good is better with chocolate chips! :)

I have made this more time then I can count ... I do change it a bit. I add a Tsp of vanilla and I use brown sugar instead of white sugar (same measurement). Sometimes I also add cinnamon too.  They always turn out lovely and my kiddos gobble them up!

I added a teaspoon or so of cinnamon and vanilla , added a cup of chopped walnuts , and replaced half the sugar with brown sugar or add tablespoon of molasses if you don’t have any brown sugar ... and doubled the recipe  to make extra big muffins cause I like the tops.

My mom is brittle diabetic so I add a scoop of vanilla protein powder to the mix and use a whole stick of butter to compensate for the extra dry ingredient. I have never been able to get true muffin tops on my muffins until I used this recipe!! Everyone loves them!! I also add chocolate protein powder and powdered peanut butter for another variety.

To make it a little healthier and since my bananas were extra ripe, I only used half a cup of sugar and replaced the butter with applesauce. They turned out nicely, and have a slight sweetness. If I made this again, I’d use one more very ripe banana to increase the banana flavor.

Excellent recipe! I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. 
I also added vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and crushed cloves which made it very fragrant. 
I’ll be making it again :)

I made it for the second time but this time around I added chocolate chips. Very fragrant. Perfect recipe.

I've made this recipe a few times now, as it is written, not changing a thing, and that is why I've rated the recipe 5 stars.  I must say it is perfect the way it is!  I also must say that I was shocked to see so many reviewers rate it 5 and then go on to say they added vanilla and cinnamon to the recipe.  This is a banana muffin recipe and that's why you DON'T add vanilla and cinnamon.  You want to taste the bananas in a banana muffin recipe.  If you wanted a spice muffin or cinnamon muffin, then you shouldn't  be rating this recipe and then telling about all the changes you made to it.  You're supposed to rate the recipe here; not your changes to it.  Change any recipe any way you like but don't rate the original recipe as you didn't make it.

As-is, this recipe is excellent. It needs no improvement. I’ve made this muffin recipe twice, once as written and once with 1/2c mini chocolate chips and one scoop of whey protein isolate powder added for a more delectable and satisfying snack. Convection baking requires only 20 minutes at 350F for 12 large muffins. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Turned out delicious, even with modifications. I used whole wheat flour, and blend of melted margarine and canola oil instead of butter. Added loads of cinnamon too! They didn't rise much but were really fluffy inside. I would cut down on the sugar next time though...even with wheat flour they were really sweet.

I have been eating these muffins almost everyday for breakfast for years now, so I figured I should probably finally take the time to review them. I love this recipe as it is written, but it's also super versatile and I have changed it up many times and have never had a flop. I have subbed honey for the sugar, added wheat germ/flax seed, subbed applesauce for butter, used whole wheat flour, even made them gluten free for a family member, the list of changes could go on for a long time. And every single time they turn out great! Seriously, if you're looking for a great banana muffin recipe stop here. Make it as it's written, fall in love with it, then start tweaking it. You will not regret it!

Very moist and great flavor.  I did add blackberries (I have tons in the freezer and look for ways to use them) which increased baking time a bit.  Yummy!

Admittedly, I made a lot of changes, but this is a good recipe to start from. I wanted to make them slightly healthier so I substituted the butter for 1/2c apple sauce and added another banana. Also, reduced the sugar to 1/2 c and used brown sugar instead. Lastly, I substituted flour with whole wheat pastry flour. Needed to bake for about 35 minutes, but they came out really good—moist and sweet.

Light and fluffy! Easy and delicious. Several changes: organic spelt flour instead of all-purpose; 1/2 cup sucanat, instead of white sugar; 1/4 cup butter; 2 large bananas and 3/4 c. applesauce. Next time will add chopped walnuts. It's a keeper!

I make 6 jumbo muffins with this recipe & use vegetable oil instead of butter. Fold in 1/2 c walnuts & sprinkle some on top. Bake at exactly 350°F for 30 minutes. Cool a couple minutes in the pan then remove & finish cooling on a rack. I store them in a big tupperware airtight container after COMPLETELY COOL. Next day they are moist & chewy on top. Absolutely delicious for breakfast & with coffee.

A few tweaks to this recipe yielded the best muffins I've ever made.
My bananas were a bit small which made the batter a bit dry and thick. 
To add moisture I added one additional banana, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and about 2 tablespoons of Kahlua. This  made the batter the appropriate consistency. 
And because we like nuts and chocolate I added about a cup of chocolate chips and fat fistfull of chopped walnuts.
Bake time was right at 25 minutes. 
Best.Muffin.Ever.

I doubled the recipe and ended up with 36 muffins.

I added vanilla and cinnamon to the batter, and chocolate chips to the last dozen for fun.

Super easy to make, great for a snack on the go!

These muffins are not as moist as I would have liked.  They would have been inedible if I had baked them for the stated time of 25-30 minutes at 350.  I pulled mine out at 16 minutes and they were still slightly overdone.  The finished product is also rather heavy, and I can taste the leavening.  There are better banana muffin recipes out there.  I’ll keep looking.

Sooo yummy! Turned out great!For a healthier version I substituted the flour for oat flour and sugar for a 1/8 cup of zylatol(fruit based sugar). I also used over ripe bananas, walnuts and a teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon.

These are alright. Nothing tooo special, just basic banana bread. I always add extra things like hemp hearts, vanilla, brown sugar, etc to make it better.

Wow! The reviews are right on the money - these are the BEST banana muffins I've ever had. And all 3 of my picky eaters loved them, which, believe me, is a testament to how good they are! Thanks for sharing this simple and oh-so-yummy recipe!

The first few times I made these I noticed the temp & time was odd for muffins (muffins typically bake @ 400) but went with it anyway &  they burnt every time, especially on the bottom. This morning I adjusted temp to 400° and baked for 15 min and they turned out absolutely perfect! I always add 2 TBS of ground flax seed to make them a bit healthier.

Too much vinegar which causes the muffins to have that sour "Bite"... Proper Banana Bread and Muffins don't have that bite.

Partner didn't like it either - so we threw it to the pigs.

I have used this recipe for ten years. I freeze bananas that don't get eaten, and several times a year use them in this recipe to make muffins (regular-sized and large),  or mini and mid-sized  loaves, and even a whole loaf-adjusting bake times accordingly. I have added chopped dried cherries, dried cranberries, candied pineapple, raisins, golden raisins (lol, only one item per batch, I don't want to remind anyone of fruitcake!), and ALWAYS a cup of chopped walnuts or pecans. I have sometimes substituted the applesauce. I have made them with and without a streusel topping. I only use bananas that have well ripened (just a skosh  before too ripe), and I use four instead of three. I sometimes also add the vanilla and cinnamon. This recipes does well doubled, and the muffins/loaves freeze well.  I give mini loaves to the village workers who pick up trash, the mail carrier, and to my neighbors every Christmas. I have never been disappointed with this recipe. (Using riper bananas gives it a darker color).

Excellent muffins! So moist. Followed the recommendations of others to add one tsp of  cinnamon and vanilla each. Also added an extra banana, used a 1/2 cup white sugar and a 1/4 cup brown sugar, and added a 1/2 cup chocolate chips and a 1/4 cup chopped walnuts. My boyfriend and I love these!

These are so easy to make and delicious! I made sure to not over mix and used an ice cream scoop to get the batter into the pan. Mine made 11 normal sized muffins. I added 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and a tsp of vanilla extract, roughly. If you like banana bread but want something easier to take on the go, these are awesome. Highly recommend and will make again, for sure!

Yummy and moist.  ONLY variation I made was use 2 bananas and about 2 cups blueberries.  Probably would use less berries next time, but otherwise perfect!

This recipe was amazing and I've made it multiple times- and I have made multiple changes to the recipe.
The ingredients that I used were(I made a double batch):
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 cups all purpose flour
2 tsp baking soda
2 tsp baking powder
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup granulated white sugar
8 ripe bananas
2 eggs
1/2 cup applesauce
1/3 cup melted butter
cinnamon
vanilla extract
I baked the 24 muffins for exactly 25 minutes and they were moist and light.  They even tasted great after being  re-heated in the microwave the next day.

I added a few things and I changed the sugar quantities.

Used 1/3 cup regular white sugar & 1/3 cup of maple syrup.

Added:
1 teaspoon cinnamon 
Also added about 1/2 cups of chopped walnuts for texture.


They turned out amazing. Moist, fluffy, and just the right amount of sweetness.

Great Muffin!  I followed the recipe exactly as it is.  The second time I added chopped pecans (didn't have walnuts) and it was great then also.  Love them either way.

I followed the recipe as written then added some crushed walnuts on top after pouring batter in the pan. This was super simple to make and they came out nice, light and fluffy. I will make these again.

I really liked this recipe. But  I heaped the batter into 6 muffin tins,and cooked approx 30 min. Then I subsituted 1/3 c crunchy peanut butter for the melted butter the 2nd time,and they were even better!!! Big fluffy muffins,moist inside.

In the oven baking right now. Wanted something quick and easy to make with bananas besides a traditional banana bread. They look and smell delicious so far. Easy enough that my 6 year old helped me. Will most likely make these again. :)

I would make these again. I had a lot of frozen ripe banana to use, I made muffins.  I substituted 1 tsp. of stevia for the sugar and added another banana and followed recipe.  I did add a pinch of nutmeg to spice things up. I think I add some cinnamon next time.  Great texture!

Absolutely delicious- made the following changes- used vegetable fat instead of butter to decrease amount of fat, a third of the white sugar I used brown sugar instead, added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and a pinch of cinnamon. Taste was not compromised! Split mixture into 12 and that required 30 mins for mine- but not dry at all- lovely and soft and moist on the inside with a slightly crunchy top which gave the muffin a lovely texture.

Delicious :)  Was quick and easy to make on a cold fall morning as an incentive to get the kids out of bed.  By the time everyone stepped out to work/school, they were all gone!  Did not use an electric mixer, and was mindful not to overmix the wet & dry ingredients.

I rarely bake so this recipe was perfect for me. It was easy and simple! It turned out moist and had a slight crisp at the top! Very delicious! I accidentally doubled the butter, but it still turned out well.  It wasn't overly sweet, either! I think I will add a bit less sugar next time though, because I don't like things too sweet, in general.

Had some bananas that had to be used or tossed. This was the first recipe that came up so I used it. My 14 year old, who doesn't like anything sweet without chocolate, loved them, so I made them again. These are great for a quick breakfast or an after school snack.

I know to double the recipe next time because the muffins didn’t last more than a day in our house. They  were SO good! I used cake flour (add 3 extra tablespoons to the recipe if using cake flour) and some mini chocolate chips of course. I also added I teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. I’m trying to ripen some bananas so I can make muffins again this weekend. Yum! ??

Very flavorful. I added the cinnamon and vanilla as suggested by other cooks. 
 A tad dry, even though I did not over stir the batter, and monitored them closely while baking. The recipe made four very large muffins.

The muffins turned out great. My 8 year old daughter made it. I just help her put it in the oven.
I added vanilla, chopped walnuts and used 1 cup wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour.

I had four large bananas that I needed to use up so I added 1 cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar, 2 eggs, 2 1/4 cups of flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons of powder and soda, 2/3rd cup melted butter, 1/4 of sour cream for moisture, and a teaspoon vanilla.  They came out beautiful and so moist. Usually make banana nut bread so muffins are new to me. Will keep making these.  I stirred ingredients with a large fork. I didn’t want to over mix as others have stated.

A couple changes I made were adding 1/3 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 tsp vanilla. I only had 2 (very large) bananas so I couldn't use the required 3. 
These are amazing muffins! Even though I only had 2 bananas, they came out moist and flavorful. I will make these again! I will also mention DON'T  over mix the batter and always use unsalted butter to bake.

Great muffin recipe. I added chocolate chips. It made 21 muffins. My bananas may have been larger ? There’s a pic of 19 of them. I ate 2 right when they came out of the oven ;)

Love this recipe!  Kids did too!  Only thing I did a little different was I used less sugar (1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup)  and I used applesauce instead of butter.. PERFECT.

I beat the butter until it was really fluffy, then added sugar and egg to it. I did beat this wet mixture but not too much before adding mashed bananas.  I also added raisins to the dry mixture. Rest of the recipe was followed as it is and the muffins were so soft and yummy. I was afraid of ending up with super sweet muffins but the sweetness was just right!!! Everybody loved them. I am quite new to baking and this recipe  is perfection. Thank you so much for this amazing recipe.  :)

The whole family loved them! I followed the recipe exactly  and added 1/4 cup chopped pecans.  I will add a little vanilla and cinnamon  next time. It was a great quick and easy recipe, to throw together when you have some over ripe bananas on hand.

Great banana muffins! Made this recipe as listed except I added 1/3 c buttermilk. Be sure to mix all dry ingredients first and then add all the wet items, including the bananas last. Don’t stir until all wet ingredients are in the bowl. Then stir gently and as little as possible.

Really good muffins for how simple they are to make. I added a tablespoon of grounded flaxseeds and about 10 chocolate chips per muffin. I made 6 large muffins out of the batter.

I followed the recipe except I was short 1-banana, and mine were small not large and so I sustituted1-4 oz. container of unsweetened Apple sauce and added 1/8c. Chopped walnuts. I only needed to bake them for 20 min. And had filled my muffin cups half full. They were moist and had great flavor!

Yes, added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. I cooked these at 350 for about 14 minutes and they were quite brown on top, so I took out of the oven, but they weren't quite done on the inside. But very brown outside. I made regular sized muffins. So, need to tinker with cook time...

I've made these muffins so often, I hardly need to look at the recipe anymore. My son deliberately lets a banana or two get overripe just so I have to make the muffins. My husband calls them "Banana Muffins II: Electric Boogaloo". These are a staple in our house. :)

Excellent recipe. These disappear! I always double the recipe and it makes 24 exactly. Last time I made these with 1/2 cup sugar only, this time I’m trying 1/4 cup. Next time, I think I’ll try no sugar!

I had no idea how easy it was to make banana muffins. With my 3 yo daughter’s peanut allergy, I always have to check labels and the bakery muffins usually have tons of synthetic ingredients in them. I love how she can make them with me too! Fun and super tasty!

I just made these! I used gluten free flour, Bob’s Redmill, and added cinnamon when mixing all the wet ingredients together. Didn’t sub out anything! Stayed with the same baking powder and baking soda portions. I also doubled this. It’s very moist!

Doubled the recipe and got about a dozen and half. Nice light recipe. I use brown sugar and slightly less flour instead of doubled. Mix all wet with sugar and salt before powdered ingrediants. Only really needed 20 minutes for double batch.

I made regular sized muffins, substituting applesauce for butter, and they turned out great! However, they only took about 16-18 minutes to bake. 25-30 is far too long!

Very moist and delicious! I added 1/4 cup ground flaxseed and only used 1 1/4 cups flour. I added 1 tsp. Vanilla, 1/4 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 tsp. Cinnamon.

Followed the recipe exactly and was happy with the results! I didn't read the reviews before I started, so I mixed the batter quite thoroughly. Although many comments recommended mixing the batter conservatively, the muffins still turned out moist while also keeping their fluff! I actually prefer muffins to be less oily and sweet, so in a future batch I would cut down a bit on the butter and the sugar. A great way to save overripe bananas!

Really good, used coconut oil instead of butter and added shredded coconut and walnuts to the mix. Oat crumble, shredded coconut, a little brown sugar and a couple of dried cranberries for the top go a long way. Had to cook for about 18 min.

Theses were amazing!!!  I made them with some silvered almonds and a sprinkle of brown sugar on the top, but otherwise just followed the recipe. Super easy and so good my husband had two and came to eat another as I was cleaning them up. Will definitely be making these again!

I made them by substituting the butter with  veg oil. Since I did no t have any butter . The result are very good. They did not  rise much but the batter is super soft and moist .

I had 2 overripe bananas and only 1/4 cup of butter, so I knew I’d need to add some other things so it wouldn’t turn out dry. For the wet ingredients I used: 2 bananas, 1/4 cup melted butter, 1 egg, 1 pouch of cinnamon applesauce, and 2 tablespoons of milk. SO SO SO good!!! Best banana muffins I’ve ever had!

Delicious and simple to make.  I wanted something sweet and had frozen bananas. After creaming everything together in the blender I added some vanilla and then hand mixed it t into the dry ingredients. The muffins turned out light and Airy I added a mixture of almonds and peanuts to the top of some of them.

This has been my go to recipe for a few years now and they've always been a hit! I add cinnamon and i always roast my bananas, in their peels, before i use them. It really brings out the banana flavor. My husband had me make these for a potluck at work, i made three times the amount and he said they were gone in 30 minutes and everyone asked for him to bring more. Lol !

Just used other reviewers suggestion of cinnamon and nutmeg and only mixed enough to blend but did not beat.  Very simple recipe for when you realize those last couple of bananas will not be delicious to eat and should be used up NOW!  Ordinary pantry items needed.  I will make again and might add chocolate chips.

I used an extra banana, only because I had to use them. And I couldn’t find my muffin pan so I used my stone casserole dish. I added 20 minutes to the time and it turned out fantastic! My husband loved it!

These turned out amazing!  So delish!  I also added a few little sprinkles of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and once the muffins were all ready to be baked, I sprinkled a tad of cinnamon on top of each one, put a few caramel and white chocolate chips on top of each one and put a slice of a strawberry, on each muffin.  I baked them for 30 minutes at 350 F.  My sister loved them too!  Yummy!

These muffins are beautiful in appearance and delicious. I made the following changes: I used 2 small ripe bananas and 1/2 cup applesauce, reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, and used softened refined coconut oil in place of butter. My super finicky kids even loved these.

Made them gluten free using the King Arthur GF 1 to 1 flour. Turned out great! I’ve made these a half dozen times now with no complaints. Because I’m GF, I let them cool, wrap each one in plastic wrap and freeze them. To reheat, I nuke one in the microwave for 15-20 seconds, then put it in the toaster oven on bake at 375 degrees for 7-10 minutes. It tastes freshly made, the outside is crispy and inside moist and soft.

This made 9 lovely light very banana-y muffins.  I did add about 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice but I've also made without and it's just fine.  I beat the wet ingredients well before adding to the dry.  Of course you just stir until mixed and pop them in the oven right away.  I also sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top which I like but have also made them without.  An outstanding recipe.  I like these better than banana bread.

Made these this morning to have to snack while a friend comes for a visit. I followed the directions with the exception of adding some vanilla. Like others have said...please do not over mix when you add the flour to the wet ingredients. The muffins were outstanding! Very tender and very simple. Will make again!

I made a double batch and added about 1tsp of nutmeg and 2tsp of cinnamon to the  mix. It took about 20 minutes to cook in a cupcake tin, but it really depends on the oven (mine is not the best). My family loved the muffins, and I'll definitely make this recipe again!

I made these with a few adaptations. I used gluten free flour, flax egg and coconut oil in place of butter. My kids are all allergic to eggs, gluten, dairy and nuts. I always  have to make substitutions and these turned out great.

Thanks, these are yummy. Easy, moist, not too sweet. Been making them for a couple years and I don't change a thing but do add deco sugar on top before baking to pretty them up! Makes 6 large muffins. Freeze well.

I thought that these muffins were easy to make and they have good, simple ingredients.  I think this may be my go-to muffin recipe.  I added chocolate chips and all the kids love them.  (I did notice they were a bit salty, I've made them multiple times and tasted quite a bit of salt, but I usually double the recipe.) Still a great recipe, will make them again!

Such an easy recipe. I substituted the butter for one snack cup of apple sauce. I also like to add a cup of walnut and 1/4 cup of shredded coconut. Baked in a mini muffin pan for about 17 minutes.

I’ve been using this recipe for a couple years now and it’s very good. I always throw in about 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of either mini semi sweet chocolate chips or regular size chips. Sometimes I substitute flour with gluten free flour. They also freeze very well.

I had some bananas that were overripe and no one was going to eat, so I googled for banana recipes that were quick and used what I had in hand and found this recipe. Since the bananas were overripe that means they were very sweet by themselves, so I used 1/3 instead of 3/4 cup of sugar. I also used brown sugar instead of white. The batter was a bit thick so you may I want to add a little milk or water to thin it out a bit, if you want...I didn’t. The recipe says this would yield 12 servings but I got 8, but that may be because I used an ice cream scooper instead of a spoon to add batter to the tin. The muffins turned out just right. I’m glad I added less sugar because they had the right amount of sweetness.

I added about 1 teaspoon of vanilla and some golden raisins...and substituted 1/2 cup of real maple syrup for the sugar (trying to reduce sugar in my daughters' diets). And they turned out amazing!! No one would ever guess they didn't have sugar.

This recipe is amazing. I used 4 medium sized bananas and I added chocolate chips, 1 tsp of vanilla, & 1 tsp of cinnamon. They come out super moist and with great flavor. My family and coworkers are in love!

These muffins were good but wouldn’t be my first choice for muffins because of their slight cornbread taste (I don’t know if that’s just me.). But other from that they were perfect and they’d wouldn’t be my personal preference but I know that they do deserve 5 stars.

I cut the recipe in half since my husband is on a diet and I was going to be the only one eating these.  I made the recipe exactly as instructed, however, I added chopped walnuts and gently folded them in at the end.  They turned out sooo good!  I will  absolutely be making these again.  A keeper.

Insanely easy to make and so yummy. Follow the recipe and they turn out amazing and so moist. And to add, they freeze well too. I make them, freeze them and then put them in my hubby's lunches. Thank you so much for this recipe.

My 4 year old grandson and I made these to use up some very ripe bananas.  The whole family raved about them and my grandson, who is a very picky eater, was found eating these several times over the next few days.  They were a big hit!

Nice and moist.  A hit with my co-workers.  We added a little cinnamon and Mexican vanilla into the batter and sprinkled raw sugar on top. They disappeared quickly!

Simple and delicious, two of my favorite combos for recipes! They're made even better with an added teaspoon of cinnamon.

I used 1/4 whole wheat flour the rest all purpose. I also added a couple of dashes of cinnamon and allspice. My whole family (of picky eaters) agreed they were some of the best banana muffins we've ever eaten. Thanks for sharing!

As they were baking I kept thinking, “ I hope they taste as good as they smell”.  They certainly did.  Consensus at our house is that these are the best banana muffins we’ve ever eaten.  I did do as someone else recommended and used 1/4 cup of brown sugar along with 1/2 cup of white.  I also added a handful of walnuts and raisins.  Perfect!

Marvelous! I added about 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and a cup of walnuts. They came out just terrific—sweet and rich but not overly dense. Great results from such a simple recipe.

I made these the other day because I had banana's that were  ready to be cooked or tossed. They turned out very well, I did add vanilla and a little brown sugar.  I also added black walnuts and pecans together. We are enjoying these for breakfast with fresh fruit, I will make these again.

I was a banana short so added an individual applesauce.  Also, halved the butter and sugar, & added 1tsp vanilla.  I ended up with 11 regular sized muffins, baked for 25 minutes.

This are amazing! I followed the recipe exactly (except for whisking the dry ingredients before adding them to the wet ingredients to add air to the flour and make then even more soft). They turned out PERFECT. This are moist, soft and like they taste delicious and I don't even like banana bread! This recipe is now one of my favorites.

This recepie was easy to use and the muffins came out super soft and sweet. I did add 1/4 cup of coconut flakes and 1 tsp of vanilla. I'm sure it will taste even better with chocolate chips.

Tasty but very dry. I also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. Any more than this would have been way too sweet. I should have stuck with Janet's Rich Banana Bread from this site but I wanted muffins this morning. Goes to show you - stick with what works!

I made these muffins using applesauce (unsweetened) and added vanilla and cinnamon as suggested by others.  This recipe is now my go-to when I have wilting bananas.  Won't make banana bread as often now.  These muffins quickly go!!! Thanks to the original contributor.

I made these with a few modifications. Applesauce in place of butter and light brown for the white sugar. I got 16 small muffins that took 15 minutes to be quite done. I would make again.

Tastes delicious! I substituted bobs all purpose gluten free flour, and used about a 1/4 cup agave syrup instead of sugar.  Hard to find moist normal tasting gluten free muffins, this is an a awesome recipe

Ive been a chef/baker for 50 years and i must say this recipe is excellent . I personally think people who dont like this are missing the traditional cinnamon,nutmeg ect that they are used to. The consistency  is perfect as is the lightness Dont mix the batter smooth as u will get a heavier product Just mix with a fork  until ingredients are wet I buy bannanas leave them out till they start turning black put them in the freezer to use at a later date , peel them while still frozen bymaking a simple cut lengthwise...so simple and flavorful. enjoy! my family and i are!

Easy recipe. Did add  1/2  tsp cinnamon, dash of nutmeg, 3/4 cup of chopped nuts and 1 tsp vanilla to batter. As suggested earlier, did not over beat batter.  Makes 12 nice size muffins.  Will definitely make again.

So tasty!  I added some cinnamon and a heaping  spoonful of fig spread I found in the fridge, gave them a little extra depth of flavor that was so good.

Doubled this recipe and got two and a half dozen. One review said they only got half a dozen out of it but they must have been making jumbo muffins or filling their cups way too much. I put roughly 1/4cup of the batter into each cup and it worked out great. I added vanilla and some Chai Spice from Epicure for added oomph!

This recipe consistently makes excellent, moist muffins as is, so long as you are mindful not to overmix your wet and dry combo. When I started making them with my daughter, we started adding cinnamon, vanilla and chocolate chips, all which she adds in quite liberally because you can't go wrong with any amount of these 3 ingredients-- you can't--and pour it into a loaf pan to make a bread. Mana from heaven! Additionally, if we have a fourth banana, we'll throw it in and  it's that much better! But it's consistently moist and tender. We usually don't cut into it until the next day so the flavors have had time to live with each other and socialize in a most delicious way. Trust, yo! It's worth waiting for the second day so plan ahead. So this is our go-to recipe for muffins or bread.

Yum! The banana muffins were so good! Definitely making it again, but this time for a potluck! However, do check where your rack is. You should place it on the rack that is around 5cm away from the fire at the bottom, or else your muffins are going to come out slimy at the bottom.

Great recipe! I used brown sugar instead of white  and added 1tsp vanilla, about 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 cup of finely chopped pecans. It made 40 mini muffins. I filled each well greater than 3/4 full and baked for 16 minutes. They were wonderful!

These we're pretty  good, the texture was perfect nice and light and not weighed down like most muffins were. I added a couple chocolate chips to the top for a bit of added sweetness. I do have to say they're a teeeeensy bit bland and could go for maybe some cinnamon or more chocolate next time. Will definitely make again with a couple minor adjustments

Easy to make and they are guaranteed to disappear!  I added some cinnamon to the batter and three walnuts to the top of each muffin.  Bon appetite!

These turned out great! I've made them as instructed and   as a slightly healthier version (whole wheat flour and subbing apple sauce for half of the butter) and my 3 year old gobbles them up!

This recipe was perfect to make with my toddler. She had fun mashing the bananas! We made mini muffins and they turned out perfectly. We added chocolate chips and walnut pieces to a few of them before baking. Yum!

Delicious!  Moist, not too sweet not too bland.  No need to sift dry ingredients together for a recipe like this in my opinion.  I never do and it turns out fine.

GREAT recipe.  I only had 2 bananas, but it still turned out moist.

I added 1tsp cinn and 1tsp vanilla sugar (since I was out of vanilla).  Then, after the batter was in the muffin tin, I poked 3-4 chocolate chips in six of them and added 3 more chocolate chips on top.  For the other 6 muffins, I put in/on craisins.  My guests loved both equally.

I have no clue what went wrong. Mine came out super dense, super dry, and had an unusual aftertaste. I followed this to the T and they were not edible for my taste, but my boyfriend is happily eating them which is why I decided to average our ratings instead.

This is our go-to recipe for banana muffins.  It does help the consistency if you follow the instructions for how to mix the ingredients.

There is a lot of sugar in this recipe and I've recently reduced the amount I put in.  I only use 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup and my kids cannot tell the difference.

I had to make a few changes to my muffins. I didn’t have baking powder so added 1/4 tsp more of baking soda & 1/2 C of Fage plain yogurt. I reduced the butter to 1/4 C to lesson the liquid. The muffins are delicious but I think I will reduce the sugar next time to 1/2 C. I also added about 1 T ground flax seed & reduced the flour by 1 T.

These banana muffins are easy to make, but we did a wrong step which is we put banana after we knead dough.

Really great. It takes few time and it is easy to make. Muffins are my favorite baked food, especially the banana one. Though the banana tastes bitter in the muffin, it is the best baked food I've ever made.

This was the 2nd recipe for banana nut muffins I’ve tried and even though this one didn’t have nuts in the recipe, I added walnuts and dried cherries and my muffins are delicious.  I will continue to use this recipe.  Thank you!

I did follow other followers advice and went with the 3/4 tsp cinnamon , 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg in the batter. I used oil instead of butter and used 1/4 cup crushed walnuts in batter and 2 tbsp crushed walnuts and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon in the topping. They were delicious ! Super super good! The topping really makes these muffins the best I've ever made.

I needed to use up some too-ripe bananas I had frozen, and this was great. One of the best recipes for banana muffins I’ve tried! I added dark chocolate chips and walnuts, but kept exactly the same otherwise. Very good. Like others mentioned, I mixed wet and dry just enough to combine them. They cooked perfectly and weren’t dry at all.

I love this! So simple and so good! I followed the advice not to overmix the batter. It came out really soft and fluffy. I would like to try using brown sugar next time, just because I like the taste difference from the white. But overall, this recipe is good as is.

We made this with 1/4 cup less of white sugar (so 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup ) and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and it came out great!  We ran out of sugar (our reason for the lessor amount) and decided that next time we make it, we're going to try with even less sugar since it tasted delicious.

This is my daughter Ava's favorite! Add chocolate chips and/or nuts to stretch the batter. Family favorite!

I am someone who absolutely loves to cook but absolutely hates to bake. My bananas were on the brink so I decided to try this recipe and  it came out triumphic. I made it as is except I added walnuts. I really thought about adding a little cinnamon and a dash of vanilla but chose to see how they came out without any tweaking. These are fabulous. I halved the recipe as I only have one muffin pan and they came out very small. I'll know better next time to use the amount of ingredients as is. 
These are so yummy!

I’ve made this recipe at least a dozen times. It turns out perfect every time. So delicious. When my bananas go brown I throw them in the freezer. When I want to use them I soak them in warm water for about 10 min, cut off the tip and squeeze out all the insides. SO easy!

EXCELLENT! great way to use up my old bananas I collect in the freezer. I did make a few changes. 1.) Added an extra egg for a fluffier result 2. Added about 1/2 of bran 3.) Used 1/3 of brown sugar instead of white ( already pretty sweet if using REALLY ripe bananas . 4. )3/4 of toasted walnuts and. chopped to desired size. I decided not to add the cinnamon as others suggested just because I'm not going for a spice bread.

Delicious. Like biting into a cloud. I added 1 coup of chocolate chips. Cooking took me 20 minutes at 375 and it was perfection. Good with old, very ripe bananas.

I made a few changes - reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, added 1/2 cup chocolate chips, used 4 small bananas and sprinkled the tops with a small amount of brown sugar. This recipe only makes 12 muffins, I will be doubling next time as they go so quickly. They are so good! Great with 1/2 cup of raisins as well!

I am a horrible cook. It's okay, everyone knows it. I have made these muffins and few times and everyone loves them! Sometimes I add chocolate chips. This last time, I had 5 med, ripe bananas and they came out amazing.

Really great recipe, especially for fall. Great snack for school and perfect for a quick breakfast. Love how the muffins came out nice and soft in the inside and a little crunchier on the outside. Chocolate chips are a great addition. This is one of my go-to muffin recipes.

My husband and I are kind of obsessed with this recipe and have made it multiple times. The only modification we make is adding 1/2 cup chopped walnut and 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips. YUM. Perfect to bring to the office or to make ahead of time for a quick grab-and-go breakfast. Absolutely recommend. 1 batch makes 12 muffins in my normal cupcake tray.

Made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Delicious and moist.  Love the fact that you can make these any time without waiting for butter to soften!  Convention oven took 21 minutes for crisp edges on the muffin top.

Turned out great. Not as sweet as others I've had but tasted great still. I made 6 muffins and a small loaf. I also added cinnamon and vanilla. And put walnuts on half of everything for those who like without.

Very good recipe and I like that it uses butter instead of oil. My only additions and changes were brown sugar instead of granulated, 2 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tbsp cinnamon. Also I cooked then differently to get fluffier muffins with nice tops. 425F for 5 minutes then lower the temperature to 375F for another 15 min or so. Absolutely wonderful for fall and winter baking.

I omitted the butter and used applesauce only instead.  I also used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose.  They turned out perfectly! They were moist and delicious, and much healthier.

Delicious recipe for moist, flavorful muffins! I did make just a few tweaks: 
1) halved the sugar, it was plenty sweet for us
2) added a splash of vanilla and a few sprinkles of cinnamon
3) added about 1c chopped walnuts
Agree with other reviewers that you want to mix only until the wet and dry ingredients are barely combined and you still see flecks of dry flour. The muffins I made must have been smaller because they were done after 22 min in the oven. These were so light and tasty fresh out of the oven, with a smear of Kerrygold butter omnomnom.

I will definitely make this again! I added one half teaspoon of vanilla extract and it made it taste delicious! We also used whole wheat pastry flour, and they were still amazing. I definitely recommend this recipe, and will repeat it.

I have been baking banana and banana nut muffins for over 50 years.  No recipe has ever come out this perfect.  I did add the vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon and walnuts that others suggested.  Then I got creative.  I didn't have any mini-chocolate chips but I did have some chocolate covered raisins.  There was plenty of batter left after I filled up the 24 mini-muffin tin (enough for 6 regular sized muffins) so I added the chocolate covered raisins.  It was a fun treat.  The chocolate just melted perfectly and the raisins added to the muffin as well.  The batches baked in the time suggested in the recipe.  Others have mentioned they bake too quickly but I would start with the recommended time and watch them towards the end of the baking as there can be a variance in temperatures between ovens.

It was really good. Batter makes 12 muffins. It's best when you add some semi sweet chocolate chips. Or you can always add nuts.

These are perfect! They only took 23 minutes to cook a full dozen regular muffins. They were golden brown and had a nice dome on top. The only changes I made was I added a tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.

Delicious and easy.  I followed the recipe exactly except I had two large bananas and the muffins turned out great. Very light and moist.

They are good standard muffins--moist but not greasy or sticky. I added some freshly ground cinnamon and nutmeg. Sprinkling sugar on top of each before baking would add a crunchy glaze. Not to be too technical, but the word 'fold' has a specific meaning,  to gently add something like whipped egg whites to a batter with a spatula to retain as much air as possible, as in preparing a souffle. Also, mixing all the ingredients until smooth is an exercise in futility and unnecessary since you are working with mashed bananas.

Wonderful, easy recipe, that is hard to screw up! I added extra bananas, slightly less sugar, used 3/4 of brown sugar instead, and the muffin rose like an angel! Would add nuts on top the next time and even MORE bananas! Very pleased with this one!

I took Nikki J's advice and didn't beat in the flour mixture ... WONDERFUL ADVICE. They came out perfect. I don't like to use muffin liners. So I just grease the muffin tin with a generos amount of butter and they come out no problem.  I like to overfill each muffin so that it has nice rounded top. So that required me to leave in the oven about 10 more min.  This is my new favorite banana (NUT) muffin recipe

This was awesome.  Recipe was super easy to follow and tied muffins didn't take long to make.  Great easy breakfast to save us some time in the morning.  I added chocolate chips because I wanted to get them out of the fridge :-), and also used 2/3 brown sugar and 1/3 white sugar because I'm slowly reducing my white sugar intake.  It still tasted awesome.  Two thumbs way up!  5 stars!

These muffins are delish! I only gave it a four because I did take others suggestions and added a tsp of each vanilla and cinnamon.  I put some butter on mine but my kids gobbled them up plain. Made enough to freeze and will keep these on hand for a quick breakfast or snack.

I decreased sugar to  2/3 cup, added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon. They came out delicious, but I would love to taste the cinnamon a bit more, so next time I will increase it. I may try them with even less sugar as well.

These are the best banana muffins I have ever had.  I added 3/4 cup of small chocolate chips just because we like chocolate .  Costco Kirkland brand of chocolate chips are my family’s favorite.  I am careful not to over mix the batter on muffins so they are light and fluffy and used the paper liners in my muffin pan for convenience.  I have taken them to work, given them to my neighbors and made them for family members.  These muffins always receive many compliments and request for more.  I do not usually wright reviews but this recipe deserve it!

Very good and exceptionally easy to prepare.  I did add 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 cup each chocolate chips and peanut butter chips.  Made as a mini muffin and ended up with 48 bite size treats.  Baked  for 15 minutes and they were perfectly done.

The muffins are so moist and so yummy. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract like others suggested. I used salted butter so I decreased the actual salt to 1/4 teaspoon. I also used 1/2 cup of coconut sugar instead of white sugar. The taste was perfect even my sweet tooth husband said so. I also added some chopped walnuts to the muffins. I will use this recipe for my banana muffins in the future.

I love when I make a mistake and it turns out.  I made the batter before I prepared the pan.  My muffin tin was no where to be found.  I ended up putting it in a 8" square dark-coated pan, dropped the oven to 325 and checked it at 25 minutes, gave it about 9 more minutes and toothpick came out clean.
It came out terrific!  Not muffins but it works well as a cake too!

OMG! I made these with gluten free flour and I am in love! I ran out of butter, but I had close to the 1/3 cup required. Didn't seem to really affect the taste/consistency. 

I did add some cinnamon, but other than that I stuck to the recipe. 

As other users have noted, my toddler also loves these "cakes."

Great basic banana muffin. I used gluten free flour and added walnuts and a few minis chocolate chips. A few comments mentioned baking soda taste so I added a tsp of vinegar to avoid that.

Great Recipe! They are so good that my mom deliberately buys plenty of bananas in the hope that they get super ripe to be made into muffins. I normaly make them without the sugar and they turn out great! Also I add some walnuts for some extra flavor

Nice muffin. My girls liked them. 15 min bake was perfect for moist muffin. We added a scoop of dried apple dices and a scoop of pecans and a splash of vanilla. Would make again.

This is a very easy recipe and a pleasure to make. I added chopped pecans and cinnamon and used a whole wheat/white blend flour. They are moist and tasty. I used shortening on the muffin cups. The muffins popped out easily. I hate muffin papers.

This is my go-to banana muffin/bread recipe. I haven't found any to beat it. I often use brown sugar instead of white, which is just a personal preference. Have made it several times with white sugar and that's great too! My boys love this recipe. The muffins rarely last more than a day.

Super easy recipe. Whipped it up with the kids in 5 minutes and in the oven for 10-15. I used 3 small bananas as when I made it with three it was a little dense, but it's just my preference

I am just getting into cooking (together with my 6-year-old and 2-year-old daughters), and we found this recipe easy and fun to make.  Plus, it was delicious!  Have had numerous requests from my girls to make it again.

Loved these! Simple enough to make with my 1 and 2 year old girls and they were still delicious. I did mini muffins (10 min) (x15) and regular muffins with liners (18 min) (x12) and did the receipt exactly as stated.  This will now be my go-to banana muffin recipe.

Delicious!  I added pecans which was a nice touch.  I gave this recipe 4 stars as it was not as moist as I had hoped.  Saw a couple of other reviewers who said the same about moistness.  Definitely only needed to bake for 20 mins.  Will decrease the baking time the next time I make them.  Overall, very good and easy to make.  How do I post a picture of the final product?

Turned out awesome! My kids who are 8, 3 and 1 all did it with my help and had no problems. We used silicone baking cups. I filled them just over half way and it yielded a dozen and a half muffins. I plan on making this again next week and making 6x the recipe so we can put them in the freezer. Perfect for times when I'm sick but they have to have something to eat.

The muffins were delicious...For my 2nd bake, I tried mixing 1/4 of brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. It got a little bit of color and a little bit sweetness for my taste. I also did try adding raisins, blueberry, and mini chocolates for my tasters to enjoy.

Delicious, fluffy and moist. One of my all time favourite banana muffin recipes. I used a regular size muffin tin and it only took 20 minutes  for my muffins to be done so keep an eye on them because they may not need 25-30 minutes.

Awesome recipe that is sturdy enough to handle additions or substitutions. I used brown sugar, and have also added nuts and/or chocolate chips with great results.

Really quite good! A bit slightly drier than I would've liked but that may be because I overmixed the mixture. Quite light.

While this is a great base recipe, I found that the amount of sugar called for was WAAAAAYYYY too much the first time around, resulting in a sugar-high muffin with little banana flavor coming through. The second time around, I halved the sugar and substituted half the butter for cottage cheese. Those muffins came out fabulous and filling.

So instead of butter I used 1/4 cup leftover  baby food (pear corn zucchini) and 1/3 cup coconut oil. Inspired by other reviewers I substituted some brown sugar and added vanilla nutmeg cinnamon walnuts chia seeds flax seeds and 1/4 chocolate chips. I will use this recipe again as it helped and held up to my notorious finagling. Very moist and tasty but oily...will reduce coconut oil next time..My batch yielded one dozen large muffins in parchment paper liners. Next time I will save the liners as the coconut oil should do the job.

Quick and easy, and delicious! I added mini chocolate chips and a couple tablespoons of sour cream. Outer than that I followed the recipe exactly. This made 36 mini muffins and my kids scarfed down about half of them right out of the oven!
EDIT I’ve changed my method slightly, I now add the egg whites to the mixer after creaming the butter and sugar and whip until fluffy. Then I add the yolk and mix in.

I always mash my (spotted = PERFECT) bananas with 1/2 the sugar and let it stand while gathering ingredients, spraying muffin tins and pre-heating oven. NO other sugar added, 1/2 cup of butter and plain whole fat yogurt a heaping TBSP for a touch of tang.

Chopped walnuts optional.

Used  double the amount of baking powder because I didn't have any baking soda on hand. Used coconut oil instead of butter for the same reason and added 1/4 cup of cocoa powder to the mix. Made 12 muffins and baked for 25 minutes, turned out great!

I made it right by the recipe and it was super easy and pretty tasty as well. Next time I think I would try the substitution of 1/2 cup of quick oats for an equal amount of flour to perhaps give it a little more texture. But it was good and easy just as it  is.

A great recipe and very easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly and only added nuts. I baked for 30 mins and the top came out a bit harder than I would like. 25 mins might be a better timing for these.

Easy and delicious.  I made the mini muffins (adding in a bit of cinnamon) and forgot to add the egg.  It still roses and held together. The result was very sweet.  My family loved it. Imagine if I had added the egg! Lol!

It was very tasty, with the perfect texture!  However, it was quite sweet so I would reduce the sugar next time.  Also, I added a tsp of cinnamon like others suggested, and that was perfect.

I've made this recipe several times and it was always good.  Out of necessity, I changed it a bit today and it was great!  My toddler dropped/threw some bananas on the ground while mashing them, so I added some more...I think I ended up with four instead of three.  I ran out of sugar, so I only added 1/2 cup instead of 3/4.  I also added a dash of cinnamon just for fun.  They are amazing!

I will make this again but this time I won't follow others suggestions....adding nutmeg was a mistake!  Was moist and would have been awesome without the added spices...maybe a little cinnamon but definitely doesn't need nutmeg or vanilla.

My daughter and her friend loved these.  I made half a batch, used 1 egg (which is double the amount),  added a half tsp of vanilla and used canola oil instead of butter.  Half a batch made 7 muffins.   I will be making these again!

Was just about to throw away my overripe bananas when I paused to glance over this recipe. Super easy and they came out great. I also added around two tablespoons of finely chopped fresh ginger and a pinch of cardamom because I had them on-hand. They did come out a pinch sweeter than I normally like but still quite good. I'll experiment with sugar proportions and perhaps some lemon zest to lighten it up next time. Great recipe to play with, thanks original poster!

awesome!  would make again.
Ripe bananas make them flavourful and tasty.   The walnuts were an added treat as well.  Mine came a little bit dense, even though i put extra baking powder; nonetheless they came out very well.

I really like how soft & chewy the muffin is! Althought I'm suspecting the chewiness is because I changed the recipe a bit. Instead of 3/4 cups sugar i mixed in 1/2 cup of sugar. & instead of using 3 large bananas, I use 8 small golden bananas. But it works just as good!

An excellent basic recipe...so versatile! I like to add a bit more banana and butter as I like my muffins REALLY moist. I may also add some frozen berries. So far I have added cranberries to one batch and blueberries to another...super good!

Perfect recipe! I made them for my husband to grab one each morning. I ended up eating them all in a day. Best if left in till they are a dark Carmel color. It's exactly like banana bread but in single servings.

Muffins turned out delicious! I used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar and also added cinnamon, nutmeg and also added blueberries. I also added a little bit of milk to the mix to make the muffins soft. Will definitely make them again :)

Very easy recipe and for once I had every ingredient including three mushy bananas!  I did add vanilla extract.  My daughter loved these muffins.  Thank you for posting.

I am a real chef who like most of us does not bake.  Wanted to use up some bananas so tried this recipe.  I have zero time for dishes and sifting.  I mushed up all the banana stuff with a potato masher  and then sprinkeled the dry ingredients on top and mixed just enough to incorporate.  All in 1 Bowl no sifting...perfectly fluffy!!!

This recipe makes the best muffins! Moist, good size, browned nice too! I creamed the butter and sugar, tossed in the banana let that mix, then threw the rest in with it and mixed it some more. I'm a careless baker :) My husband wants this recipe to replace my "go to", and it will!

My son wanted to make them chocolate. We added 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder and about 1 tablespoon of honey. I rubbed a little butter on the tops while they were still hot from the oven.  The batter was almost too sweet( after i added the honey to balance out the cocoa powder) but they came out great.

I like to start with a simple recipe like this one then make some healthy modifications. I always cut down on the sugar - in this recipe 1/2 cup was plenty. I substituted 1/2 cup of ground flax seed for 1/2 cup flour, used only 2 bananas (thats all I had) and added 1 large grated organic carrot and a small handful of blueberries.... fantastic!

Delicious muffins! I swapped out 1 c of the all-purpose flour for buckwheat, coconut oil for butter and added hemp seeds, cinnamon, nutmeg and walnuts , otherwise I left it as is and it was wonderful!

Oh So Good! I did as other reviewers and added the vanilla & cinnamon, I also used whole wheat pastry flour and coconut oil instead of butter & mixed the wet ingredients then added the dry (including toasted chopped walnuts)and gently stirred until just mixed in. They turned out fantastic!

I just made these and they are SO good. I had a few bananas that were about to be too ripe, so I decided to try this recipe. They are so moist and  yummy. Not to mention, they are very easy to make.  Will definitely be making these again.

As I had only had 2-1/2 bananas, I added frozen pineapple to make up the equivalent of 3 bananas.  I used organic raw sugar instead of white sugar.  Simple, easy, fast! Sooooo goooood!!

I've made this a couple times now, and its an amazing recipe!! I put it in for one to three minutes under the suggested time and its perfect. It gets a little chewy if you leave it in for too long. Perfect muffins!

These came out delicious! I did however make a couple tweaks 1. Cut sugar down to 1/2 c and that was still quite sweet and 2. Gently folded the batter just enough to incorporate everything being careful not to over mix. The end result was non dense and non soggy muffins!! Just for taste I did add 1t of vanilla, 1t of cinnamon and mini chocolate chips to half the batch.

I did alter this recipe to make it more healthier. I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, used unsweetened apple sauce in place of butter, and used brown sugar (only 1/2 cup). I also added some vanilla (a big splash) and some cinnamon and nutmeg. Mine cooked up in 23 minutes and I got 11 muffins from my batter. My 3 year old really enjoyed it . I love making muffins with kids, they are so easy to through together. This is a great recipe that can easily be altered to make healthier, and they still stayed soft and fluffy.

I make these at least once a week for someone. My family, friends and coworkers all love them. As others have said, it's important not to overmix, but of course that's true of all quick breads. I usually throw in a couple of handfuls of chopped walnuts or pecans, but that's the only change I make. I love that the recipe uses real butter, the way nature intended. :)

Good basic banana muffin. I added a tsp of vanilla,  tsp of cinnamon, and a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. Also, 1/2-3/4 c of chocolate chips would be a yummy addition to this recipe. I prefer a 1/4 cup each of  whole wheat and bread flour in place of a 1/2 cup of all purpose. Next time I think I'll do half brown sugar and half white granulated sugar. Brown sugar is always a good way to bring out the banana flavor. I like to tinker, but I would definitely make these again.

Turned out great. I put about 16 in mini muffin tins & 5 in regular ones. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix. I also added some oatmeal on top of the regular sized ones just before baking, just for fun.

I made it exactly as written. It certainly was easy. Muffins out of the oven less than an hour after waking up on a Saturday morning is delightful. However, they are a little bland. After they were in the oven, I looked around to see what other reviewers have done. I think I'll make some additions next time.

This recipe is a keeper! They were best right out of the oven or at least eaten the day they are baked. Nice and moist and flavorful. I did add 1/2 teas cinnamon and 1 teas. of vanilla.

My family loved these muffins.  They were spongy and not too sweet.  I did add a tsp of cinnamon and vanilla.  Already making plans for another batch!

I added chopped walnuts and a bit more banana. My family and I liked them, but a bit more flavor or spice might be good.

in my house banana bread/muffins usually consist of whatever I have on hand.  I do add 3 mashed bananas but then I've been substituting mashed up pears (2) for sugar, a handful of old fashioned oats just for texture and substance, 1/2 reg flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour, and coconut oil for butter. The liquid from the pears is enough to balance the extra oats. As long as you stick to the basic essentials, (flour, egg, sugar, banana, baking powder/soda) you can add or substitute in so many ways.  I wind up checking on the muffins at 17 minute. sometimes they're ready, sometimes they need a few more minutes. We prefer them a bit underdone. Cooked thoroughly but on the moist side. Great recipe!!

I rarely leave reviews as they are always filled with tweaks to the original recipe anyway, but... sometimes one must leave credit where it is due.  These were excellent in flavour and crumb.  They were also simple to make.  The key with any muffins, is to just "barely" mix the dry portion, with the wet.  Lumps, or even some stray powdery bits are what you "want" to see.  If you follow that simple secret for muffins, they will always be light and tender.

Excellent, easy, and highly tasty recipe. I utilized some of the comments posted. I added homemade, no sugar added apple sauce, chopped walnuts, a little cinnamon, and a splash of vanilla. I topped with a few more chopped walnuts for fun and visual appeal. They're terrific. Will definitely make again

I made it according to the recipe and they were great.  I made them again adding spices and finally again substituting peanut butter for the butter,  using 4 bananas, 1/4 C brown sugar,  1/2 C white sugar and added 1/2 tsp vanilla,  1 tsp almond extract and chocolate chips. Yum! Definitely will keep making these.  Very versatile recipe.

These are like little pillows of heaven.  I used my stand mixer and gave the batter a good 10 second whip at the end of mixing.  They turned out really fluffy while still being moist.  Perfect!

Well I think you forgot an ingredient for liquid like a bit of water - the dough had no movement to easily incorporate ingredients so I added 1/4 cup water to get it ok - maybe needed more water - waiting fir the results as they are baking - filled 12 cups and enough left for another 1/2 batch .

This is my go-to recipe for the best banana muffins ever.  I originally got it from Food.com (I think, but I wrote it out on a recipe card, which is now all marked up).
This is a great basic recipe for all kinds of substitutions.  Sometimes I use 1/2 cup honey instead of sugar (and I almost always cut down the sugar by 1/2, anyway esp. if I am adding cocoa or chocolate chips (I usually add 1/2c-1c, depending on how I feel).  Whenever I am out of eggs, or if I just feel like it, I have substituted 1T ground flax seed + 2T-3T water (I have also added 1c flax seed meal +2T-3T milk or water to the recipe which gives a nice nutty flavour). For extra chocolatey goodness I have added 1/4c cocoa powder.  Using this recipe as my base, I have NEVER had a problem with any of my substitutions or additions; only with omissions, like forgetting the baking power, soda and salt...dense (me and the muffins)!

I substituted 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce for the butter; however, I do use Demarle silicon to bake the mini muffins. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and could have reduced it to 1/4 cup. They turned out super yummy.

Was very easy to make and very delicious! 

I added vanilla and cinnamon.  Cut up walnuts and folded into batter,  but I also left some aside and sprinkled on top of the muffins before baking.  Turned out wonderful!

Don't take out your anger on the dry and wet ingredients. Mix until smooth but chunky. Came out wonderful and moist.

Great, easy recipe! As suggested by other users, I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 cup crushed walnuts. I also subbed out 1/4 cup of the flour for whole wheat (I may experiment pushing that a little higher and/or decreasing the sugar a bit). 

Tip: If you don't have a plastic pastry scraper, it's a very cheap tool that will speed up your mixing a lot.

Recipe made 12 standard-sized muffins that were done around 23 minutes.

I am the type to never believe recipes because every time i try one it comes out wrong, BUT i was wrong here. I decided to make them one day but i noticed i had no flour once i had mixed everything. sooo... i blended oatmeal and used it as flour. My entire familly loved it they where the best muffins i have ever had. After that i make them all the time white oatmeal flour and there is always a request for more.

I read a few reviews and decided to add the vanilla, cinnamon like others suggested. I substituted safflower oil for the butter to make it dairy-free. I added 1 TBS of ground flax seed. I mixed the dry and wet ingredients until just mixed. The muffins were perfect and delicious.

Simple, quick and oh my god good.  I made the recipe almost exact, subbing 1/2 cp wheat flour (personal preference).  I used kosher salt, which is slightly bigger in grains, therefore had a few places where I could taste the salt.  I would recommend using a little less salt if you're using salted butter.  Also, DO NOT beat these, do not mix until smooth, do not spend any more time than necessary getting this batter moist.  Meaning: mix it until it's just barely combined.  A few small lumps of flour isn't going to hurt this.  Bake them just barely underdone too.  In the case of mini-muffins, for me (my oven), it took 12 minutes.  I also left my bananas slightly chunky.  I have a personal preference for not so sweet things as well and the sweetness on this bake was just right.  It's all going to depend on the ripeness of the bananas though.  Overripe, I would have added less sugar.  This is a recipe I will definitely keep and probably play with later on.  I feel these would be phenomenal with a little cinnamon and some pecans. :-)

Made exactly per the recipe and they were excellent.  My husband particularly liked them as they did not have any streusel topping.  Will be my go to recipe for banana muffins.

No butter used our travel applesauce packet. Added raw oatmeal and one cup of trail mix. Used large muffin tin and made 8 perfectly!! Moist, soft, delicious! Oh and a dash of cinnamon before putting in tins.

These are really easy to make and are the best banana muffins I have ever tasted! The secret is to not mix the wet and dry ingredients too much like other reviewers have pointed out.  Can't wait to make them again!

I doubled the recipe to get rid of all my bananas and I added one extra banana because they were all small anyway.  I used two dark 12 cup muffin pans, and I had to lower the oven to 325  about half way through cooking because they looked like they were going to burn.  I did let them bake 5 min longer since I had lowered the temp.  The muffins came out just okay for me, they did not have that moisture that I was looking for, but they do taste better the day after,  and my kids loved them.  Overall I think this is a quick simple recipe that can be tweaked around to fit your taste, I think next time I will throw in some applesauce, nutmeg and some dried cranberries.

I added cinnamon, ginger, vanilla in the batter. Instead of butter I used vegetable oil which is lighter and makes them more moist. I also added some almond powder to the batter. I sprinkled the top of the muffins with brown sugar and thinly sliced almonds... turned out great this way! Try it!

Made it exactly as directed and was blown away.  I also altered it with substitutions and had the same results. 
I substituted one banana for 1 cup of applesauce  and added 1 Tbsp. of cinnamon and vanilla. 
Also substituted one banana for 1 cup of pumpkin purée plus 1 Tbsp. of pumpkin pie spice and vanilla. 
I have also used half and half all purpose and wheat.  I've added walnuts to the mix as well as topped them with raw sugar and walnut pieces. 

I strongly agree with the others that say " do not over mix."  Whip the all the wet ingredients + sugar as much as you can ( I use my mixer on high for a few minutes), but make sure to stir together all dry ingredients and gently fold into the wet mixture. 

Each and every alteration has been as unbelievable as the last. Highly recommend this recipe as quick, easy and out of this world delicious.

I've tried so many banana muffin recipes I cannot count them and this by far is the easiest and most tastiest. I did add walnuts  and another secret I use with all muffin recipes (strawberry, blueberry etc) is add a 1/8-1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. It adds a little extra something that brings them over the top. Friendly warning though if you add too much you'll know it. (Still delicious but changes the taste a little (sweeter) , instead of enhancing it)

I just made these. I added about 1/8 cup of brown sugar to the egg/sugar mix then after the flour was folded in I added about 3 tablespoons of caramel condensed milk just because I had some leftover in my fridge. Consistency is perfect- inside isn't too dense and the top of the muffin is just a tiny bit crispy. 10/10 will make again.

So I just went through my first hurricane! Luckily I was not affected badly by Hurricane Matthew but it did make produce, and anything else refrigerated, fairly scarce. So to the cupboards and what is on hand I go. I used this recipe to do something with my old bananas, however I made some alterations.  I used coconut oil in place of butter and a flax meal egg in place of an actual one. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, simply because I love it! I also only used 2 large bananas, and added some walnuts, along with a good dash of cinnamon. Turned out amazing!! Will do again for sure

This is an excellent recipe and I will be making these muffins often!  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  I used 1/4 cup of egg beaters in place of the egg.  My bananas were very ripe with black spots on the peels which gave the muffins a lot of flavor.  I stirred and whisked the ingredients instead of using a mixer and everything turned out great!

I've used this recipe three times and the results have been great. I've substituted with atta flour, coconut oil and the muffins are still delicious. It's a very forgiving recipe.

These are excellent! They were a big hit with my husband, and when I took them to a church Bible study, they were gone in minutes. I love that it's such a simple recipe, but still so delicious!

Really, easy and really good. They made my house smell wonderful! I used 4 small very ripe bananas. I mixed as little as possible just until I couldn't see any of the flour mixture per other reviewers.

I been using this recipe for years now. This is the only time I manage to give a comment. I have a 20 months old child who is a picky vegetable eater. I use this recipe to hide vegetables. I change a little though since I am making for my little one. I only use 1/4 white sugar and 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce to control the sweetness. I also added 1/4 cup of milk as well. I hide shredded carrots or succhini in it  which it works perfectly since he loved banana so much. I even sometime toss semi sweet chocolate ones in a while without vegetable ofcourse.  I definitely will recommend it. I tried so many different recipe but this one is the best so far.

I enjoyed making this recipe. I wasn't too pleased with the new yogurt I bought and didn't want it to go waste so I found this recipe! All were made with organic ingredients. Bob's red mill organic 100% stoned whole wheat pastry flour and unbleached organic cane sugar (for the kids, I'd use coconut sugar myself, it's not sweet enough for the kids) in lieu of the whites. I used organic Sun-Coc oil (it's so light and runs thin). The muffins were so scrumptious! Heavenly! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

So easy and delicious. I substituted coconut oil for the butter and added a bit of Chia. They came out so light and tasty. Definitely had to cover them in foil half-way through so they wouldn't burn but it could be my oven.

They're great! I added a pinch of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla extract as suggested in the reviews. I sprinkled chocolate chips on top as well. I'm definitely going to make them again!
Well, it seems that they have become an addiction  for me! I have tried them with different variations: whole-wheat flour instead of all purpose, sometimes a mixture of both, cut the sugar into 1/2 a cup instead of 3/4, substituted the melted butter with plain yogurt, and the results have always been amazing. My friends and I absolutely love them!

Amazingly simple and delicious recipe. On a whim, I greased the muffin tin with some butter flavored Crisco (something I never do) and it made them even more mouthwateringly buttery! Muffins were done in about 20 minutes.

I love the recipe as is!
I also tried making some changes for dietary purposes as follows: 
swapped half the flour with ground oats
swapped butter with applesauce
swapped sugar for brown and only used half cup

I have also tried many variations for  flavour
*dried cranberries and orange rind
*dried pineapple and coconut
*walnuts and chocolate chips
the possibilities are endless!!!!!

I love this recipe! Muffins are moist and delicious. I usually add 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts, a 1/2 cup chocolate chips and a half a teaspoon of vanilla. My 2 and 4 year really enjoy making this recipe and we make it every time we have very ripe bananas.

Ive been cooking and baking for a couple of years now but only recently have I been really changing it up, that being said these these were pretty easy for me to make . My three year old and I mixed these up and added some brown sugar/butter crumble on top. cooked them in a cupcake tin for 13 minutes and they came out great. these will probably be my go to until i am feeling a bit more adventurous

If six stars were an option, I'd give them! I tried many variations and I've made these at least 50 times. My routine changes are adding 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, substituting brown sugar for white, using 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour. These are a family favorite!

Super moist! First recipe I ever made by blending everything by hand. I added the ingredients as given and baked for 25 minutes. Before putting into oven I topped three muffins with mini chocolate chips just for appearance and they looked great. I also dusted three others with powder sugar after baking but the taste was in the recipe as is. This was by far one of the easiest recipes to put together with great results.

Took the advice of just barely blending the wet and dry ingredients. Also added 1/2 cup of choc chips! It made 12 cupcake size muffins. They came out great!

My son (who is a selective eater) LOVES this recipe. The first week I made 4 batches and they were all finished by the kids and neighbors. I made them with splenda instead of sugar. It was a healthy hit.
When he started needing more calories I used the sugar and added chocolate chips. A new are requested every time we run out. I have made 2+ batches a week for a few months now.

These are absolutely delicious! I always DOUBLE this recipe and make the following modifications:

1) I use 1/3 cup of unsweetened applesauce and 1/3 cup of butter. The applesauce makes the muffins moister.

2) I add 1/4 cup of brown sugar, in addition to the 1 1/2 cups of white sugar. They don't come out too sweet and it gives the muffins a more complex taste.

3) I use seven bananas, instead of six to give the muffins a more intense flavor.

4) Like everyone else, I always add pure vanilla extract. I haven't added cinnamon or nutmeg, but I bet they would be great additions.

5) I bake these for 22 minutes, not 25. The muffins did not come out burned when I cooked them for 25 minutes, but they were very dark brown and I prefer golden brown.

This recipe is a perfect base and let's you modify it in almost any way you want. I have thought about adding slivered almonds or chopped walnuts, as well.

Tasty! Especially if you're like me and you have ripe bananas and don't know what to do with them. 
 Try not to overmix the batter. I had lessen the amount of sugar, added a dash of vanilla extract and a sprinkle of cinnamon to the batter.  Turned out wonderfully!

I have been making the chocolate chip banana muffins from this site for years, and was sure the kids were going to  ask where were the chocolate chips in this recipe. They didn't ! They loved it and so did I. The secret to  these muffins  is the same as for banana bread, the bananas need to be super ripe to have their flavor shine through.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the batter was a little to dry. (I didn't over mix!)  I added a touch of vanilla and an extra banana. Then it was perfect.  I made mini muffins and there was extra batter. SO I made one batch of 24. And added some chopped walnuts to what was left and it made 6 more minis. They are very soft and most and have a very delicious banana flavor! Very good with & without the nuts. Oh, I did forget the salt. I didn't miss it!

This has been my go-to banana muffin recipe for years, and no other compares to it for me. Generally I use whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of butter and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup; sometimes I add up to a cup of blueberries, chocolate chips and/or walnuts. Very versatile and turns out every time!

Very yummy and definitely tastes banana-y! I added cinnamon, clove and nutmeg (only a dash of clove and nutmeg, and a TBSP of cinnamon) and it was awesome! Also Instead of the 3/4 cup of white sugar, I did a half cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  On the top of the muffins, in the last five minutes of baking: I mixed 2 TBSP unsalted butter, brown sugar, and a dash of salt and brushed it on the top of the muffins.  It gave the muffin tops a sweet, crunchier texture! Enjoy them!

These muffins are one of my favorite foods ever.   I'm only posting this review because I've tested it many times and find that I prefer two large mashed bananas instead of 3.  

Each time I make it with 2 bananas, the flavor is complex, buttery, banana...y, and sweet, and the tops of the muffins have the most delicate crunch.  If I make it with 3, I still have a great muffin, but it's not quite the same.

Lastly, use browning, aging bananas, as I'm sure everyone is well aware.

The muffins were excellent.  I did add vanilla, cinnamon, and pecans and these were great.  A lot of reviewers said their muffins were done after 20 minutes, but mine took the full 30 minutes.  This recipe has now replaced my previous favorite banana muffin recipe.  :-)

These are really good. Great hearty taste & texture. I substituted to make a healthier muffin: 1/2 WW flour, 1/2 White flour, only used 1/2 c sugar (sucanat=lower glycemic index), added 1/4 c leftover pumpkin butter (could use any jam too), 1/2 c walnuts, 1t vanilla, 1 t cinnamon, 1 t ginger, 1/2 t cardamom, 1/2 t anise, 1/2 t fennel. Not too sweet or spicey- just right! Absolutely great w whipped cream cheese & then it's a complete protein w combo of walnuts, WW flour & cheese.

Very quick and easy to make! The muffins are absolutely delicious, fluffy and moist. And you can easily put your own twist in by adding cinnamon or chocolate chips and much more. 
I'm definitely gonna use this recipe again.

The kid purposely do not eat the bananas so they will brown and I'll have to make these muffins :)

Instead of adding nuts or cinnamon why not try what I did-- add chocolate chips!  Chocolate and banana go great together.   Just don't add too many chips like I did or you'll have a gooey melty mess all over your hands.

These were super good and pretty simple (and quick) to make. I made a dozen regular sized muffins. For some reason they were a dark golden and done at twenty minutes so watch your ovens. I actually used four ripe bananas, added vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. They're very moist yet fluffy and light. BF is gonna love them! Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful moist muffins loaded with flavour. I really enjoyed the soft and moist texture. They were not crumbly which is something I really dislike with other muffin recipes. I added in a pinch of cinnamon in my 2nd batch which added a nice spice. But the recipe is excellent even without alterations.

We enjoyed these muffins, but did make a couple of changes.  We added cinnamon and vanilla, at the suggestion of other reviewers.  The other thing we did was to substitute Truvia Brown Sugar blend for the white sugar.   Even with the reduced sugar, my 11 year old son gave them 2 thumbs up!

The changes I made:

I substituted a single small individual cup of cinnamon applesauce in place of the margarine, and I baked for 20 minutes instead of 25-30 for 12 "big" muffins.

Next time I make this, I will most likely add walnuts to the recipe, and I might use wheat or white-wheat in exchange for the all purpose flour.  

The muffins came out very moist and delicious.  They smelled great while cooking and my kids were excited to try them.  I shared one with them and they immediately asked for more of them and for me to make the recipe again.  A definite winner!

I've made this recipe dozens of times following the exact recipe. These muffins are easy to make and have a rich full bodied banana flavor, especially when you use very ripe fruit.
In addition to making the exact recipe, I've tried different variations too. Using brown sugar and nuts, raisins etc. They all work very well too. Another thing I think is important to know is that these muffins freeze very well and make a very welcome addition to brown bag lunches. You will love it.

I'm the worst baker on the planet.  I didn't even follow the directions and they turned out kick !  I dumped all the ingredients in the mixer at once...plus 3 oz of coconut yogurt, cinnamon,  and  chia seeds.  When they cooled I put Nutella on them.  I made 20 and my kids ate them all.

Love these! This is a great base recipe you can adjust to your personal taste. I switched out the butter for one individual, unsweetened applesauce cup. I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a splash of vanilla. Lastly I mixed in a 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Will try with blueberries too!

I am 13 years old and I made this without any difficulties! I had my dad find the sifter and that was all the help I needed! I consider myself pretty good in the kitchen because my mom taught me at a very young age . I did adjust the salt and sugar amounts. I used half the salt that the recipe called for and I also used about a teaspoon less sugar because I had very ripe bananas. I did use paper liners because I thought it would be easier. They turned out amazing! Not to sweet and not to dense. They were nice and fluffy! I did make sure that the bananas were mashed VERY well and I personally think that that made the world of a difference! I also read others' comments about not over mixing and I also think that made them better! 

Tips: 
-do not overmix 
-be sure to mash the bananas to personal preference
-adjust sugar to bananas ripeness/ sweetness
-add in only 1/4 teaspoon salt instead of the full 1/2 teaspoon

This recipe was so good! I was at a beach house with three overly ripe bananas and no muffin pans so I made it in a  bread pan sprayed with Pam. I added the cinnamon, and nutmeg as recommended by others because my husband loves these spices. I also added 1 teaspoon vanilla.   I used Truvia sugar blend for less pure sugar in loaf. I then compensated (hahaha) by sprinkling the top of the unbaked loaf with just a spoonful of dark turbinado sugar.  Baked the bread sized pan for  just under 30 mins and it was awesome.

It was very good, but I added an egg, 1/2 tbs  of cinnamon and a 1/2 cup of raisins. also, it may be my oven, but regular size muffins were done in 21 minutes so check around 20 minutes. Thanks

I used splenda and margarine light instead of butter and sugar, each muffin only 65 calories. They were so delicious. Thank you I will continue making them.

I added mini chocolate chips and the bake time was about 12-15 minutes not 25+.  Overall, easy to make and even more delicious to eat! YUM!

Very good!  I chose to increase the banana by one, and decrease the sugar by 1/4 cup, and added some vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Tastes great!

I've made this many times. Like others have done, I added a banana, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla, and used brown sugar for 1/3 of the total sugar. Noticed some of the other reviewers using applesauce instead of butter, and I'm going to do that next time as well.

Great, easy recipe for one tin. I substituted one banana for 1/3 cup chopped thawed spinach for my toddler who refuses to eat anything green. He's gobbling them up! I added cinnamon and vanilla as well. I also rounded the half cup of flour to sop up the extra moisture from the spinach and it seemed to be enough if I left them in a bit longer.

This is the perfect muffin if you mix the batter lightly with a wooden spoon.  It's okay to prepare the 'wet' ingredients with an electric mixer.

Very quick, easy, and the muffins were delicious! Only change I made was to use very ripe bananas like I do for banana bread. It just intensifies the flavor. Next time I think I will also add some vanilla.

Super easy for someone who never cooks/bakes. Made it with my  nine year old daughter. 25 minutes was a little crispy in my oven, and they are too buttery. Will try the applesauce substitution next time. Thanks for posting an easy recipe!

I have been looking for a recipe and this was easy and fantastic. I cooked for 20 mins and found they were still a little undercooked so I put them back in the oven for 10 or 15 mins extra and the outside was slightly crunchy and the inside was so moist and light. The banana flavour was good. I used an extra banana because mine were not very big. I froze the first batch and will be making another batch tomorrow.  I put walnuts on top too...fantastic recipe

turned out great...moist and fluffy. I used brown sugar instead of white, and I added pecans, vanilla and cinnamon spice to the mixture. Will definitely make this again!Also I partly mashed one of the three bananas to give it a little texture

I used Gluten Free Flour Blend and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  Excellent muffins.  The key is to not mix too much.

Since I already have a number of  bananas in my freezer... (my daughter's husband, her then boyfriend, used to say that it wasn't a normal trip to our freezer without the traditional black bananas. One time I found my freezer to be overcrowded and counted 46 frozen bananas. Sheesh! Time to bake or purge!) Anyway, I digress….I decided to bake something banana-y today with the almost-too-ripe bananas on my counter. Banana muffins! I settled on this recipe because it was super-duper simple. My subs/additions were pretty basic: brown for white sugar, an extra banana instead of the fat, a teaspoon of vanilla, a cup of chopped walnuts…all things that are purely to my own taste. The batter tasted yummy raw and filled twelve regular sized muffin cups and twelve mini-muffin cups. The muffins are in the oven now and have risen nicely. Tick tock, tick tock…Mine are taking a bit longer to bake although the minis were done in 15 min. And the minis are WONDERFUL hot! Moist, light and flavourful. Yippee!! The regular sized muffins have taken 20 minutes to bake. I have learned the hard way, after many many many years of tough nasty muffins, to just barely mix the wet into the dry. Resist the temptation to take your frustrations out on the muffin batter. Note: I think I like this recipe better as a mini-muffin. The reg sized muffins are a bit more soggy and just barely done, although still delicious. I dub this recipe a success!

This is the exact same recipe I have been using for years except that I add 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and throw in some fruit and walnuts.  I usually use either dried cranberries or chopped dates for the fruit.  I don't measure the fruit or nuts, but just toss some in until it looks right.  I always make them in the extra large muffin pan.  The recipe makes six of the large muffins.  It is a pretty foolproof recipe.

Super easy and delicious!  I did add a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon, and they are SUPER.  Moist, great banana flavor, and well-received by my sometimes-picky family!  I doubled the recipe and ended up with 28 muffins.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I just made them now again. Turned out superb. But I have to add that  1 teaspoon of baking powder with tsp baking soda is too much to this kind of recipe. The first time I made them, I didnt like the taste of it  because of that. Today I baked them again and used only 1 teaspoon of bak. powder and that was just enough with no need of bak.soda. Just use one or the other. Otherwise this is a very good recipe;)

Excellent recipe!! Just made these with the kids and I already ate 2. Delicious, moist muffins. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the batter, otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Definitely will be making these again. Update: These muffins freeze extremely well and once thawed actually taste like you just baked them. A giant factor for our household.

For a dozen muffins, I'd use 4 bananas instead of 3 next time. Even with 3 large, overripe bananas, I could hardly taste it coming through. I'll also try adding 1/3 cup of milk.

This is my favorite banana bread recipe! I use half brown sugar and half white. I omit the butter and use applesauce instead. I also add a cup of chocolate chips.  I make muffins and cook them for about 15-20 minutes. They are amazing! Moist and perfect!

Made recipe exactly as is and it turned out perfect. However, I made large (normal sized) muffins and only had to bake them for 20 minutes until they were golden brown and sprung back. Great recipe! Super flavorful and moist. Yummy! Thanks!

Delicious and easy to make, but I found the muffins a tad too sweet. I might change the sugar to 1/2 cup next time.

Great recipe very easy to follow. I added a 1/2 TSP of Vanilla and 1TSP of cinnamon for a extra little kick of flavor. And since my family loves Nuts I mixed in some chopped Walnuts

I was out of white sugar, so I subbed brown sugar--it was perfect. Also, I added a teaspoon of Almond Extract because I love the banana/almond combo.

I used the small bananas and about five of them as that's what I had in hand. Baked it as a loaf though and It turned out great but the center was still a little moist. Was still good and will be making it quite often!

I doubled the recipe since I had 6 very ripe bananas to use.  Only change I made was to substitute raw cane sugar instead of regular sugar.  I didn't bother sifting the dry ingredients and just ensured I mixed it well once added.  I didn't use a mixer and instead just used a spoon to combine the ingredients.  I like my muffins a little crispy on the outside so I had left them in the oven for two extra minutes.  The inside still stayed moist.

I love these and very easy to make with kids.  We love to add chocolate chips.  We've also tried using applesauce instead of butter and that turned out well.

Made these today, perfect! I wanted a healthier muffin for school mornings for my kids so I substituted in whole wheat white flour and 1/3 + 1 tbsp vanilla Greek yogurt for butter (or 1 small 5.3 ounce yogurt Cup). I added 1/4 Cup walnuts for high omega 3 content and 1/3 C choc chips to help sweeten from the wheat flour. Best muffins ever! Kids don't even realize they're getting high fiber and other stuff I feel better about feeding them! Thanks for the perfect starter recipe!

I made mini muffins with this recipe. I filled the muffin cups to the top and they made bigger mini muffins than your standard ones. It made 24 muffins by filling the cups to the top. They were very easy, quick and delicious! Will be making this recipe many times in the future!

I made the muffins tonight and substituted applesauce for butter, as suggested by others, but the muffins stuck to the sides of the paper cups :(   They were very tasty and worthy of another try for sure!

YUM!  Made exactly as written and my daughter and I love them.  Very moist.  I made 11 standard-size muffins filled pretty full (used paper liners) and baked about 18 minutes in my oven.  Very basic, fresh-tasting muffin.  Nothing frilly, therefore perfect for my needs.

I made this today and my husband already had three! Like other reviewers, I added 1/3 cup brown sugar instead of all white, a dash of vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, about 2 tablespoons applesauce and some chopped pecans. They turned out really moist and delicious! I ended up with 15 muffins.

I tried to make them just a smidge healthier, substituting the butter for coconut oil, cutting a quarter cup of sugar, and subbing another quarter cup of sugar for maple syrup.  They were SO moist and yummy!

I added about 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips and 2 Tbsp flaxseed. I also put a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg just because. The muffins came out great, great way to use up overripe bananas!

I substituted yogurt for the butter and it came out great. A light and spongy muffin.  Would add vanilla and spices a next time. This will be my go-to banana muffin recipe. Thanks for posting

The recipe gave me 10  delicious muffins really nice and soft. you should just wet the dry ingredients to get them soft .
 I would have given it 5stars if the top kept well raised, may be I did something wrong I am not sure.

I scaled it to 20 to suit the number of bananas I had on hand.  I only have one muffin tin so I made 12 and then 8 more later.  It was a little thick so i added a little water which made it perfect.  I reduced the sugar by 30% and added nuts, chia seeds and flax seeds.  They turned out great!  Will definitely use as my go to banana bread recipe- Thanks for sharing!

Great! Kids loved them and asked for more. We did add cinnamon for more flavor, apple sauce for moisture, and chocolate chips just because ...be sure to fold in the dry ingredients.

These are very Delicious muffins! i used brown sugar instead and they came out so good my nephew who hate banana before now actually eats bananas since "they taste so good in muffin they taste so good no muffin too" which is what im thinking means that the muffins made him realize bananas are yummy!
i would definitely not beat them lightly mix them and using an ice cream scoopper is a good way to get the batter into the tins

So delicious and easy to make. I did it in the morning before work and my boys were very happy with the results, the muffins turns out very soft, spongy and moist. I did some changes with the butter, I didn't have any so i use Canola Oil, and add 1 tablespoon of evaporated milk that i got leftover from something else and didn't want to waste. But i know that without the changes it would turns out delicious nonetheless. Thanks for the recipe

When these muffins came out of of the oven, they were crumbly  at the top. They looked horrible. But the tasted like regular banana muffin's. I rate this three stars for presentation.

Great Recipe. :)  I did use brown sugar and white sugar and added vanilla essence, about 2 tspn cinnamon, 2/3 cup of chocolate chips & 2/3 cup of walnuts. And the taste is heavenly, not that sweet but turned out really moist muffin. Baked for almost 30 mins. :)

Made recipe just as is, and found it to be delicious.  Very quick to put together and once baked has nice texture and moist.
I think this would be a great kid friendly starter recipe for any new baker.

I would definitely make this again. I would put 4 bananas instead of 3. Also you can add 2 Tbs of sour cream to make it more moist. You can also put in 1 Tsp of vanilla, and 1 cup of walnuts. And you should try to put the muffins in for 20 mins.  instead of 25 to 30 mins. but just for suggestions!

I love this recipe. I usually make minor alterations.  I replace one banana with a pealed small apple and process bananas with apple, egg and sugar using hand-held blander. I also add vanilla extract to the batter and some chocolate chips.

I doubled, using 29 ounces of small apple bananas (about 15), and replaced one egg with 1Tbs flax meal and 3Tbs water (combine, let sit for 5+ min). Super delish! Next time I'll replace half the fat with applesauce, and add vanilla.

This was easy and delicious, and easily handled substitutions.  I subbed out 1/2 c. whole wheat pastry flour, and used half xylitol and half coconut sugar.  Next time I will cut the sugar to 1/2c.  I also added about a cup of walnut pieces, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Greased the muffin pan and they came out beautifully.

These turned out great! I added vanilla, mini chocolate chips, and an extra banana. I also made them in mini muffin tins, and left the banana a little chunkier for added flavor. Perfect bite size moist yummy muffin!

Great easy recipe for bananas that are about to go bad! I added some vanilla extract (1 tsp) and 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, delicious.

I didn't have butter i substituted with  vegetable oil in th same  measurement.  I also used self rising flour  not ap, i added tsp of vanilla extract, a sprinkle of nutmeg and cinnamon for extra flavor!   They turned out perfectly!  I was so excited to find a recipe to use up the bananas before they were wasted! Super easy and yummy.

Really good recipe that is easily veganized by using ground flax seed meal in the place of the egg and using earth balance butter!  My family loves them and it's hard to get them to eat anything with the word vegan in it.

Very simple yet very good.  Great for those left over bananas that are turning brown, or ones you've already put in the freezer.  I had two I from the freeze and one that was getting brown.  I just made sure that I drained the liquid from the thawed bananas.  I also used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose.  Turned out great!!

This recipe is one of the best muffin recipes iv'e ever tasted! The muffins are light and fluffy and you can really taste the banana. This recipe works great with big or mini muffins too.

I actually made these without baking powder, and they still turned out really nice! Just added under 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda to make up for the lack in powder. I had a dozen muffins. Excellent recipe!

This will most definitely be a staple in our house. These muffins were so easy  to make. The muffins are full of flavor and very moist. I did use 5 small very ripe bananas and almost a full cup of sugar. My picky 12 year old daughter not only loved the batter, but loved the muffins after being baked. (She is so picky that sometimes she will only eat the batter). I was very pleased with the outcome of this recipe. I will DEFINITELY be making this again!!

This is a very quick easy recipe to put together. 
It's also quite versatile so you can add your own changes as needed. I did not have 3 over ripe bananas, only 2, so I also added some leftover coconut cream that I had in the fridge, along with 1/2 tsp vanilla and a few  dashes of cinnamon. 

Made 12 good sized muffins that are delicious! 

I think a person could easily substitute any other item they wanted to use instead of bananas, thinking pumpkin would also be good or even some mashed up sweet potato.

Super moist and good. Made a double batch. Definitely my new favourite recipe. Did 1/3c applesauce and 1/3c margarine to make them slightly more healthy, as well as 1c all-purpose flour and 2c whole wheat. Split the batch in half and did chocolate chips in one. The best muffins I have made in a long time.

Made these tonight. Used strawberry applesauce instead of butter because they're primarily for my lactose intolerant 1yo. They're nice and moist and he loves them. The recipe would've made 48 mini muffins if I had not overfilled a couple of them on the first batch.

I am determined to not waste so much food for 2016. So I had some bananas I would normally throw out and I said nope I have to make something. I came a tossed this. Oh my goodness!! It could be one of the best things I ever ate. I made just like recipe calls and it was so yummy. Also very filling one muffin and I was full all morning. Thank you so much for sharing.

Great the way they are, but I had to make them healthier. 

I replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with coconut flour. 
Replaced the butter with a tablespoon of grape seed oil and a snack size applesauce.
Reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and added walnuts and cinnamon. 

My husband says they are the best ever. Shhh he doesn't need to know they are healthy.

This was the second time making these muffins and I am so glad I decided to go with this one again! This recipe is spot on...it yielded 8 big muffins (they went over each of the top of the muffin tin cutouts..but I like them like that.) To the flour mixture, I added some spices: cinnamon/nutmeg/cardamom (not measured, just sprinkled in) and I also added chopped almonds and dark chocolate slivers.  I cooked them in a 350/375 degree oven for approx. 27 minutes to make sure they were cooked.
Really really good. My friend ate 3 in one sitting!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I just made these and followed the instructions with the addition of 1 tsp of vanilla and I substituted 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of granulated white sugar for the 3/4 cup of sugar called for in the recipe. I topped my muffins with cream cheese frosting. My family and I agree, this is phenomenal!

These were really good. I followed the recipe other then I used Splenda Sugar Blend instead of Sugar. I checked mine at 20 minutes and they were done. If I would have let them on the amount stated they would have burnt These had a good banana taste. Loved them!

Great recipie!  I added a splash of almond and cinnamon along with 1/3 cup cashews. They were great. I also used gingerbread mini cake pans instead of muffin pans. Worked great!!

I followed others reviews & added a teaspoon of vanilla & dash of cinnamon. Otherwise followed exactly. Result was a delicious moist muffin. Will continue to make anytime bananas need used.

These muffins are delicious and came out perfect. The only thing is that I had to cook them longer than the recommended time. I used a baking sheet with 12 muffin tins. Most recipes I have to alter a bit. Not this one. Thank you :)

This recipe is excellent! I made it several times as-is, and they are so delicious. I've also taken to adding  a splash of vanilla extract, and cinnamon.  Try adding blueberries or strawberries if you like them! (I add about 1/2-3/4 cup, depending on what I have around).  and  the mini-chocolate chips are also a hit.  This recipe is a winner!

Great basic recipe. I swap a cup of the flour for whole wheat pastry flour, use half brown sugar, and add cinnamon and vanilla. Mix with a light hand.

I really like the recipe. So simple, my 8 year old can make it. we substituted regular flour with Bob's Red Mill gluten free  1-to-1 four, added 1 cup chopped walnuts and used 4 medium bananas instead of 3 large. worked out better than I had hoped.

The most important part of making these muffins is to let them rest!! Otherwise, you won't get a nice rounded crown on them. I mix the batter, put it into tins, and THEN I turn the oven on to preheat. This is all the time it needs, but it's crucial. I found this out by accident. The first time I made them, I got distracted and they sat on the counter in tins for about 5-10minutes before I noticed and threw them in the oven. The next time I made them, I threw them right into the oven and they came out so flat and unappealing. It took a couple more times of making them this way before I realized the discrepancy and decided to wait a few minutes. It's works like magic every time now. 
1/3 cup chocolate chips always makes it into the batter in our house. And I usually add 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp vanilla.

These were really good and light, moist. If you like a very light and moist cake-like texture for your this will be a 5 stars for you. I added vanilla, a bit of cinnamon and used 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of all white sugar. It gave me exactly 12 regular size muffins. I would have added some walnuts if I had any on hand, I will likely make these again.

I used about 1/4 a cup less sugar. I would love to figure out the calories for this. They were a bit dense I may use a bit less flour next time. But they came out very good.

I used Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free 1 to 1 Baking Flour and added some mini chocolate chips.  Otherwise did everything exactly as the recipe called for.  They are DELICIOUS!

These were good. I did the the suggestion and added a bit of vanilla. I mixed the bananas, egg and butter in my mixer to break up the large chunks , and then hand stirred in the dry ingredients. I added some walnuts for texture.

I added 1 cup of nuts and I dont think it would have been as good without them :)

I made them again with 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 cup apple sauce, tps vanilla, whole wheat flour, coconut, and walnuts.  they were great!

Made them with my 8 year old, easy and delish. Regular 12 pan muffins at 25 mins. Only thing I added was 1/2 tsp real vanilla. Will make this again, next time I will spray the papercups, they stuck.

These are really good.   Per other reviews,  I added 1 tsp vanilla.  I also added a 1/2 c of mini chocolate chips.   It makes 12 standard muffins and 20 mins baking time in my oven.

Crispy on the outside, soft and tender and moist inside, good banana flavor -- so my daughter said! I can't have any but I made them for the kids. 

I was almost out of AP flour, so I subbed in 1/2 cup of cake flour. Doesn't seem to have hurt them at all. We were really careful not to overmix -- we gently folded only until most of the dry spots no longer turned up.

Amazing recipe! Super moist and full of banana flavor. I used a little bit of brown sugar and folded in chopped walnuts. I also put chopped walnuts on top of the batter when it was in the mold. It was moist and crunchy! Super good and will make again very soon.

Loved this recipe, its by far the best one I've ever used, the only changes I made was adding cinnamon, other than that I went right by the recipe, my husband wants me to make them all the time now! He loved them as well, said it was the best banana muffins he had ever tasted! Thumbs up for me being a good wifey ????! Thanks for sharing!! Also as people have said on here the tip to making them super moist is not over stirring!

Followed recipe as writen. The only change I made was adding 1/2 cup of chopped pecans. Only issue I had with the recipe is that the regular size muffins took over 20 minutes to cook. But then every oven is different. My husband will take these to work to share with his coworkers. I got 15 muffins out of this recipe.

I love these muffins and have made them many, many, times.  My family really likes them. I modified the recipe to make it gluten free, dairy free, and sugar free and they still taste great! I substitute coconut oil for butter, chickpea flour and gf flour blends for the flour in the recipe and a quarter cup of date paste for sugar. I also add about half a cup of chocolate chips.

We made this and 12 muff8ns lasted about 3 hours. Then the next day we had some big carrots and decided to replace the banana with carrot. We added half a cup of peanut butter chips and half a cup more sugar and they are awesome. Thanks for the super recipe! We will try this with other ingredients.

Good recipe. Keeping the sugar at 1/2 c. complimented the streusel and sweetened cream cheese used as topping. The recipe was increased 3x and used a #16 scoop for a yield of 24 nice sized muffins.

I did half whole wheat and half white flour, and reduced the sugar to half a cup.  They were very good! I rated as four stars because they are very sweet, even with reducing the sugar content. But otherwise very good! Would be fantastic, closer to 5 stars, with nuts.

I made a healthy version of the recipe and got delicious results as well.

Here are the alterations:
1. 1/3 c apple sauce instead of butter
2. 1.5 c oat flour instead of white flour
3. 1.5 tsp baking soda instead of 1 (add a little extra salt as well)
4. 1/2 cup of agave instead of 3/4 cup of white sugar
5. 1-2 tsp vanilla extract and about 1 tsp. of cinnamon

Hope this was helpful! enjoy:)

This recipe was ok in my opinion. I've done a lot of baking and honestly this one just didn't excite me. It was a little bit denser than I prefer. I made it exactly as the recipe suggested. However, I did add chocolate chips and walnuts to it but these ingredients should not have altered the density of the muffins. The flavor was good (although slightly bitter from the baking soda which is typical for banana-based sweets). I would recommend trying folding in the egg white after beating it to stiff peaks in place of half of the baking soda. This way you add a physical (natural) leavener in place of a chemical one. This should help with the bitterness and the density.

Yummylicious! Success at 1st attempt. I added 2 more bananas, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla essence, 3 tablespoons of milk and used brown sugar instead. They turned out to be really moist and the smell was heavenly! You could add nuts or chocolate chips to enhance the taste. Topping ideas (ideal for PARTY)- icing sugar + banana/strawberry slices, peanut butter, melted chocolate.

Great recipe! Entire family helped finish off the entire dozen shortly after they were done. Followed directions exactly with no modifications. I even goofed and forgot the egg. But even after pulling it out of the oven, emptying the muffin tins, adding the egg, and putting it back in, the muffins were super soft! Best tip: Do not over mix or beat!

These were very good. I made the recipe exactly as written, except that I only mixed the wet and dry ingredients until just combined to avoid toughness. Also, regular sized muffins only took about 20 minutes in my oven, but it runs a bit hot. These were very moist with lots of banana flavor. Great basic recipe and very quick and easy. Next time I might add nuts or even chocolate chips.

Amazing recipe! As is, the recipe is 5 stars. I do like to add a splash or two of vanilla extract and an extra banana because I enjoy the strong banana flavor and the extra moistness. I add semisweet chocolate chips or toasted walnuts as well. I use this recipe so much that I have it memorized!

Followed this recipe to a tee, they were perfectly moist but found them way too salty. Think there is too much baking soda and baking powder.Next time will cut all measures in half. Will make this again.

Very easy recipe. I've made these twice now and they've been great both times. I did use four bananas both times (because that's what was in the fridge, not because I like changing recipes) and one time I added walnuts. Delicious both ways!

Amazing! So moist! Tasty! Soft! Fluffy! I doubled the batch and made 2 doz nice size muffins. Added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Cooked for about 22 min. And stirred everything by hand - instead of using a blender. Soooo good!!!!

My first recipe review ever. I was that impressed. I have made dozens of different banana muffin/breads/loaves over the years, but this one I found to be easiest and the tastiest! Here is what I did different: 2 bananas (because that's all I had),I split the sugar to half white and half brown, added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp of vanilla. They baked perfectly!! My family loved them and kept asking for more.

Hi! After using all-recipes for a LONG time, this recipe finally made me join, to write a review. The recipe is DELIGHTFUL! I followed the tips from the comments, left out a banana because I didn't have enough, and instead added blueberry, and whipped up a crumble to go on top. So moist, filling, and even without one banana, the banana flavor is strong. I absolutely love this recipe and will make it my go-to muffin recipe. One tip to give, Make SURE you use bananas that have been sitting and have a fair amount of brown spots. These are sweeter and softer. And like all the other tips, just mix until the mixture is moist. Once again, great recipe! I tried to upload a picture but it wouldn't go through... Anyway, Thanks again!

* note* I mashed the bananas as instructed, but I would use a mixer so that the mixture has no lumps.

I happened to have fresh blueberries, so I added a cup into the wet mixture before folding it into the dry ingredients. Absolutely delicious blueberry banana muffins! My husband and I loved them.

Only chage I made was subbing 1/3 of the white flour for whole wheat. Otherwise, followed exactly and they were delish. I would be interested to know if I can make them as tasty without so much butter next time...

first time I've tried this recipe, followed it exactly as stated, except added a few chocolate chips.  I was very happy risen well, and nice and moist, bananary smell/taste and chocolate chips just gave it that extra dimension.  Me and partner were the guinea pigs, then took the rest to work following morning for colleagues. Everyone liked them:-) will definitely be making these again, when I have slightly over ripe bananas left over, which could well be soon as in middle of summer.

Had some mushy bananas.. Was looking for a simple recipe and WOW this was incredible. It's a great base recipe. I added chocolate chips this time. Next time I might add walnuts. And maybe some cinnamon sometime if I want more of a spice muffin. I ate 3 of these warm out of the oven. Ca

Excellent banana taste and texture. I added an unmeasured amount of cinnamon (basically a buttload) and cardamom, as I like spices with banana, and some vanilla extract.

I just pulled a batch of these out of the oven and  they  smell. AMAZING!!  I double the recipe and added a cup of blueberries and about a cup of chopped walnuts because I had them on hand. Also took the advice of other people and added cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg.

It's such a simple recipe and it's my go-to for banana muffins. Sometimes I add a splash of vanilla and nutmeg but that's for my own personal taste.

Have made these too many times to count. By far the BEST banana muffin recipe I've ever made. I have never changed the ingredients, except to add more or less banana. I just use whatever I have on hand that is ripe enough. I'll even let bananas ripen longer just so I can make these. I always get at least 12 regular size muffins, unless I use more banana. I've gotten as many as 18 using 4 bananas. My 2 year old twins absolutely love these, even after three days. I just can't recommend these enough! Thank you for such an awesome recipe!

I used GLUTEN FREE all purpose flour and aside from reducing the sugar to just half a cup and a couple shakes of some cinnamon, I followed the recipe exactly. These were so good that I immediately made another dozen, this time adding chocolate chips to 6 muffins and some blueberries to the other 6!  They were to die for!!  It's not uncommon to get dry results with gluten free baking, however, these were so moist and yummy that my husband was SHOCKED when I told him they were gluten free!

Made this very easy recipe several times with my preschooler - it's delicious! I cut back the sugar to 2/3 cup and added 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips. Sometimes we add a dash or two of cinnamon. If our bananas are small, we up it to four. I often go 1 cup all-purpose flour + 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.

We make this at least once a month- adding mini chocolate chips and using a mini muffin pan. We reheat them throughout the week for my 3 year olds pre-daycare breakfast, but they don't last long as my husband and I devour them too. Easy and quick!!

Love it, make it almost every month.  You can add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of ground flaxseed, too.  Also, I like mine with 1/2 cup of white sugar.  But then I use about 1/4 cup of course natural brown sugar on top.

I had 4 bananas left that were way too soft and browned to eat and I didn't want to throw them away so I turned them into banana muffins! I threw in some walnuts and they turned out quite tasty. I kept an eye on them though because I didn't think the pan of 12 would take even 25 minutes to bake and sure enough I had to pull them out about 5 minutes earlier. They came out great and were easy to make.

Made this for my family and were deeply enjoyed! I had to make a second batch that night! From now on we make two batches at a time! These are considered a specialty!

Good recipe. As others, I advise against mixing the flour mixture too much. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a half cup of chopped walnuts. Very tasty!

This was a great recipe!!! I wanted a banana nut muffin so I added about 1/2 of a cup of pecans to the batter and crushed another 1/4 of a cup to sprinkle on top. I will definitely be making these again!!!

These are awesome! I made half a dozen "jumbo" muffins and baked them for 25 minutes (high altitude). Followed a couple of suggestions from others and added 1 tsp vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. Yum!!

These are WONDERFUL! I added a dash of vanilla and a bag of chocolate chips to a double batch. I cook them on "convection conversion" and the tops have a nice crust to them while the middle is as moist as ever. Approved by my family of 7 :)

After mashing the bananas, I added about 1/4 c. brown sugar to them (instead of into the dry ingredients, as I had already sifted).  Then I added the melted butter and egg.  I gave it a good whir with my immersion blender to make it more of a puree.  I dumped the sifted, dry ingredients into the wet ingredients bowl and gently stirred/folded just until blended and moist.  At 350 degrees, it only took 20 mins (regular sized muffins).  The texture is sublime.  Here's a pic.  Sorry, two are missing; can you blame us?

Easy to make recipe: I added 1tsp of vanilla extract and sprinkled pumpkin seeds on every muffin. Tasted good, however if you like your muffin sweet I suggest you add more sugar, prolly another 1/2 cup.

I think they would be a 5 without some of the changes that I made, so therefore that's what I scored them! I used whole wheat flour, and subbed the butter for applesauce. They're still great, but I think they would feel "guiltier" without the changes! I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon which I don't regret :)

I've made mini muffins with this recipe a number of times for my daughter's daycare snack. This last time, I had four mushy bananas and used all of them and added some ground flax to compensate for the extra moisture and reduced the sugar to 1/2 a cup. As another reviewer suggested, I also subbed in applesauce for butter and I added about a cup of chocolate chips. Really fast and easy even to whip-up on a week night.

This is a family favorite! We've been eating it for years and I'm just now rating it because  as much as we love the original recipe, we also love this healthier version that I recently made. Sub out 1 cup flour for whole wheat, decrease sugar to 1/2 cup, sub out butter for coconut oil.  Still every bit of deliciousness as the original.

Followed the recipe exactly and it came out great! Added chocolate chips to half the batch just to mix it up. Very moist and light. I'm definitely going to make them again!

Great Recipe! 
I did make a few adjustments though.
* 1/2 Cup Chopped Macadamia Nuts
* 1/2 Cup of Raisins
* 1 Tsp. Vanilla
 *Substituted Butter with a Non Dairy Butter and used Organic Cane Sugar instead of White Sugar.

They were easy to make and delicious to eat!!

I have been trying a lot of banana bread recipes lately and I do believe the search is over! These came out perfectly moist.  The only variation I made was adding 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract and cinnamon.  Fantastic!

This recipe was the best option I had to use for our gluten free flour. I made this recipe and doubled the ingredients, I substituted Flour with Krusteaz GF flour, and substituted butter with Coconut oil, I also added 2 tsp of Vanilla. These were moist, non-crumbly for being GF, had tons of flavor and truly delicious. I use a 1/3 measuring cup to fill my liners and had 17 muffins.

Really liked it. I doubled, used whole wheat flour, added instant vanilla pudding to the dry, and did 1c brown sugar with 1/2c white. I also followed other tips and stirred the two together so as not to over mix. Turned out great :)

These bake up very nicely. I topped the muffins with chopped walnuts, which I highly suggest for appearance and texture. I got 12 muffins, exactly, with a #16 scoop. I sprayed my non-stick pan with Bakers Joy and they removed effortlessly after cooling slightly. My only issue was these reminded me very much like banana bread and not a banana muffin cut open and when tasted. The only difference is these are slightly sweeter and very soft. I would consider them an easily portioned banana bread, if craving that. My only change was the garnish and subbing a 1/2 cup of the flour for white whole wheat. I would make these for a banana bread lover.

This recipe resulted in the best muffins I have ever made! I will never use another banana muffin recipe again! Mix the ingredients separately first, then add the wet with the dry. It's essential that you DONT OVER MIX! Just mix until moistened. I sprinkled some chopped walnuts on top before baking as well. I baked 14 muffins for about 20 minutes total, and they were moist and perfect!

This recipe is amazing - both delicious and forgiving. I'm in the middle of moving and didn't have my measuring cups, so I estimated the measurements (after increasing them by 2/3 because I had 5 bananas to use up) and the muffins still came out delicious!

These are delicious!  I made a couple of batches - one with an extra banana and one with dried cranberries.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  I baked them for 22 minutes - any longer they would have beed dry or burnt.  My coworkers give me their old bananas so I make them bread :)

Recipe was perfect! I just reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and added another banana (because I had 4) and it worked out fine. I also added pecans for extra crunch and a few chocolate chips on the tops to test out the flavours. All of them came out perfectly at 25min. I will definitely use this recipe again. I love how bananas can be used in this way. Next time I will add the cinnamon and vanilla extract for added flavour like the video recommends.

This is my go-to recipe for banana muffins. It makes a dozen regular sized muffins, and I add 1 tsp. vanilla to the wet mixture and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the dry mixture. I also add chopped pecans to final mix (for personal preference). This recipe is also great as a bread loaf; just be sure to adjust cook times 10-15 minutes.

I cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of walnuts. The muffins were moist and very delicious.
Just to add to nutritional value next time I will swap 1/2 cup of flour to whole wheat and see what that does, but the recipe is very very good.

Good solid recipe, but set your timer for 20 minutes - in my oven, 25 would have been disastrous. I baked it as written - a little sweet for my taste, but then that may have more to do with the bananas than the amount of sugar. Quick and simple, moist and muffin-y. Good base for additions, but again, I might use a tad less sugar next time.

My "go to" banana muffin recipe. Super easy, and delicious! I add in some mini chocolate chips for the kids, but also swap out 1/2 cup of white flour for oat flour to get it a little healthier.

I use this recipe always but I add a splash of vanilla, a little cinnamon, allspice, cloves. Plus I use half brown sugar and half white sugar. The last time I made them I also used a splash of rum extract. Also I like to mix a little bit of oats with dark brown sugar and sprinkle it on top. My kids also love when I add semi sweet chocolate chips. YUMMY

I love this more than banana bread. It seems to last longer. I like to added mini chocolate chips, Skor chips, or nuts.  Always a big hit.

I followed this recipe exact.  Except for 2 things.  I only had 2 large bananas.  So I added 2 tablespoons of yogurt. I baked this in a cake pan.  Let's just say my husband loved it.  The cake was out the oven, cooled for 20min & gone in less than 20min.  It was so moist and delicious!  I am def holding onto this recipe.  Thank you, thank you.  Btw, if your bananas are super ripe (super sweet) cut back on the amount of sugar.

This was a great recipe! I ususally make banana bread/muffins with sour cream but there was no need for it in this recipe! Took the advice of the user who said be gentle and not over mix wet and dry ingredients. I think the lack of over mixing was the trick in this recipe. They cooked thoroughly but you had bites of moist mashed banana. Kids helped me make these and loved them!

What a great recipe! I had to make substitutions, because my daughter is gluten free and dairy free. I subbed gluten free flour for the flour and dairy free spread for the butter. It was so good! The entire family loved them. Thanks for such an easy recipe!

These were packed with banana flavor. I made a slight change and used 2 parts white sugar and 1 part dark brown sugar. I also added cinnamon and vanilla. I'll be adding these to my breakfast rotation!

These were amazing! When mixing, they didn't look like the video but turned out beautifully! If wondering how long to cook these muffins, I cooked for 13 minutes and they were perfectley moist. These would be so simple to make with kids. I would absolutely make these delicious muffins again.

Made these muffins and they were delicious!   I followed directions and made sure to fold the flour in with a rubber spatula instead of a whisk just until moistened.   They cooked in about 20 minutes instead of 25.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thank you!

Amazing!  Moist, and full of banana flavor.  I used 2 tsp of baking powder and omitted the baking soda.  At 10 min they were still gooey so I left them in for 10 more and they were perfect!

These are delicious as is but today I tried to healthify these a little and they turned out great. Used sprouted whole wheat flour and subbed out 1/3 cup Truvia for sugar. Delicious!

I like that this recipe is simple and does not require and spices or flavourings! I used 1-1/2 cup mashed banana (which came from 3 large bananas), 1-3/4 cup flour, brown sugar instead of white and tossed in 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. I think that the extra 1/4 cup flour is really necessary or it becomes a little TOO moist and cake-like. But otherwise, a good recipe!

Love this recipe! Made mine with 1/4 sugar and a spoonful of plain yogurt(more calcium) plus some grated carrot(nice way to sneak veggies), then added chopped up dried cranberries to replace the 1/4 of sugar I didn't add. Topped it with pumpkin seeds and whole a dried cranberry. It looks good and was super moist :) my nieces and nephew, love it! They call it a birthday cake lol

Couldn't have been any easier to whip this up! My sister tried to make herself some banana bread the other day and we'll just say... It didn't go so well. So I figured I'd fix her some muffins and these were fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly as written, no additions or substitutions at all. They were moist, had an excellent flavor, and were very fluffy. I think it's the absolute perfect base recipe, as the possibility for additions are endless. 
I wrote it down for my sister, so hopefully the next time she feels the need to (gulp) try to bake, it won't be a disappointing fiasco.

The perfect muffin base.  I added cocoa about 2 tbs, reduced sugar to half cup, added about 2tbs chia seeds, a bloop of vanilla and several healthy shakes of cinnamon.  I plan to experiment with pumpkin instead of bannana next time.  Excellent recipe!

Delicious!  Very simple recipe that turned out great!  I used a white sugar/brown sugar mix, and added 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts.  I was surprised that there was no milk or buttermilk in the recipe, but there was no need for it.  Great banana flavor, tender and moist muffin texture.  I will definitely make these again!

The texture of these is wonderful. They do not come out tough like a lot of other quick bread recipes do.  They are moist and very tender.  Just make sure you fold the dry into the wet.  This is key.  I might cut the salt by half next time.

Great recipe!! I tweaked it just a little bit and it still turned out delicious. I only used 1/2 cup of sugar. I added cinnamon and vanilla. I also added 1/4 cup of sweet potato puree for my kids and threw in some mini chocolate chips. They are wonderful! Such an easy recipe to work with and adjust to your needs.

This is a very easy recipe. I've made it many times with good, consistent result. I've made it as is, and i've also made it with some modification. Here's my modification:
Instead of 1/3 cup melted butter, i use 1/6 cup plain full-fat yogurt and 1/6 cup olive oil. Instead of white sugar, i use brown sugar. I've also baked it in a 9 x 3.5 inch loaf pan instead of muffins. For this, i made a topping, which ups the yummy factor by about 5 times. This is the topping recipe i use:
1/4 cup brown sugar, about 2 tablespoon very soft butter, 1/4 cup plain flour, about 25 grams chopped pecans. Mix everything together and spread on the batter before putting into the oven.

I added some  chopped walnuts.
Cut the sugar to less than half cup.  Still very sweet and they turned out pale even though my oven works great. I did not like the taste of these muffins . IMO there are better recipes out there.

These were yummy and fluffy.  I added around 1/4 c of buttermilk to the recipe.  I am always looking for recipes that include bananas for the ones that ripen to quickly.

I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg. I also used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, instead of all white sugar. They were the best banana muffins - nice and moist, and tasty!

These were wonderful - best banana muffin recipe I've tried in years!  I used added the spices/vanilla others noted, double the bananas (had lots to use up and love banana) and let bake a little longer - got 18 muffins, moist and very good banana flavor.  My kids THANK YOU!

I followed what others suggested (added cinnamon and a splash of vanilla), but I substituted Splenda instead of sugar.  It worked well and my family enjoyed every mouthful.

So fluffy, light and moist! I tweaked the recipe a little and added a little vanilla extract, 1/3 cup semi sweet chocolate chips, and a tablespoon extra unsalted butter! Just barely folded wet and dry ingredients together.  20 minutes for regular size muffins. Yum.

I added 1tsp vanilla, 1tsp cinnamon, and divided white sugar by half, replacing it with brown sugar and put oatmeal and cinnamon sugar combo on top... And it came out perfect!! I would rate this a 5, but wasn't sure that was fair with the alterations I made. I'm new at this. ?? I also turn the oven up to 400 only for the 1st few min to help them rise. And I make sure not to over mix helps with texture/moistness.

Delicious and moist banana muffins! I used 4 bananas instead of 3, and also added ½ tsp vanilla, ¼ tsp freshly grated nutmeg and 1 ½ tsp cinnamon.

Best muffins I have ever baked, I think.  I did alter the recipe a bit though.  I used Truvia baking mix instead of straight sugar, and I added blueberries.  Also, I buy the smallest bananas I can find, so I used five of them.  Absolutely fantastic!

Everyone loved these! A coworker was having a bad day, ate one, and was in a good mood for the rest of the day. 

I substituted brown sugar for white and added vanilla and cinnamon. Don't ask me how much. I don't really measure those two things.

This is the best banana muffin recipe I have ever tried. Been looking for the "one" for some time. You can really taste the banana & very moist. Great for mini-muffins.

I made some changes (used just 1/2 c sugar, coconut oil in place of butter and a 1/2 t of vanilla.  My results were perfect, tender and light muffins that were not overly sweet.  This recipes is going into my favorites.

Very quick delicious muffins.  The only changes I made were to decrease sugar to 1/2 cup and I added 1 cup of blueberries.  These are very moist and I'll surely make them again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Abi Godfry.

Easy yet delicious recipe. I tweaked it a little bit though. I used whole wheat all purpose flour, and brown sugar for the same measurements. Baked only for 25 mins, and they are superbly well moistend! Will make again but this time will play around with some cream cheese and some nuts.

Tried this recipe for half a dozen muffins. Added a teaspoon of vanilla syrup in vodka.
First effort in world of baking and must say it worked like charm.

Perfect homemade muffins with nice chocolate chips in top...wonderful.

Came out GREAT though I did make a few tiny changes. Used gluten-free flour, substituted coconut oil instead of butter, added 1/3 cup plain yogurt and only used 2 bananas instead of 3. Had no baking powder so I skipped it. Added some cocoa powder too. FANTASTIC!

This is my go to banana muffin recipe. It's so moist and DELICIOUS. I like to use oil instead of butter (preferably olive oil) and when I can't use eggs I use  2 tbsp water mixed with 1 tbsp of oil and 2 tbsp of baking powder and it makes the muffins rise so much more! I also up the sugar to 1 cup when I use the egg substitute(which I now always do) and sometimes even use honey instead of sugar and they turn out great( if you are going to use honey once you get past 1 cup of it reduce it by 1/4 cup. For example if you are doubling the recipe instead of using 1 1/2 cup, use 1 1/4 cup). Add ins go really well in them. My top two are chocolate and walnuts. If you haven't give this recipe a try, go for it. You won't be disappointed.

Great muffin! The oil can be completely omitted, bananas keep the muffin plenty moist. These can be made vegan/ extra fiber  with the addition of ground flaxseed (1T per 2 T water, let sit a few minutes until gelatinous)  in place of the egg! So tasty!

Delicious and moist!  I didn't add anything and so happy I didn't. They have the perfect banana flavor. I used a mini tin and was able to get 24 muffins. I like to fill my cups all the way to the top to get that bakery top. So good!

I make these muffins with my 3 and 5 year olds all the time. Super easy recipe and they can do most of it. I make them with whole wheat flour and usually add chocolate chips and a little extra banana. Moist and decilicious!

Excellent and simple! The only thing I changed was I added some nuts. I had a few pecans in the freezer but I wanted more nuts. Searching... ahhh! Slivered almonds, check! Great flavor combo! I didn't add vanilla or cinnamon or nutmeg or replace the butter with applesauce... and if I had, I wouldn't be reviewing THIS recipe. Nuts is a personal preference, but the base of this recipe is just wonderful and I wouldn't change a thing. I did do this though...  I wanted a nice high crown, so I made 10 muffins instead of 12. And I think the butter caused them to brown a little more than I had expected, but that was strictly visual. Great recipe, I'm keeping it in my recipe box!

Turned out amazing! Added vanilla and used canola oil instead of butter (was out camping and didn't have butter), baked it in a small foil bake pan in my little trailer oven and had amazing banana loaf for breakfast!!! So yummy. We ate the whole pan in one sitting. Turned out very moist! Thank you so much for sharing :-)

Excellent as is but can make it healthier without much change in taste.  Use all white whole wheat flour and decrease sugar to 1/2 cup and oil to 1/4 cup with enough applesauce to equal the 1/3 cup for moisture.  Aldo sub egg white for whole egg to decrease fat a bit.  I make it regularly like this and whole family enjoys.

This was a very good recipe but wanted to try and make it a little healthier, so I only used 1/2 cup of sugar, added 1/2tsp of cinnamon and used 1/3 cup of apple sauce instead of butter, they turned out great and tasted awesome!

I accidentally use self rising flour instead of all purpose flour. But luckily the muffins turned out okay and they taste good too... phew :p Will bake again next week using all purpose flour :p

ps: I add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and a pinch of cinnamon. And put some cheese cube on top :D

Great muffins! I substituted coconut oil for butter and the muffins were light and moist. Bake time is too long for large muffins, which is why I rated four stars.

i followed the recipe exactly.
they taste pretty good. i was careful not to overmix but the texture was a bit dry.
i think i would bake these again but i will add fruit such as strawberries or blueberries to give the extra moisture.

This will be the only banana muffin recipe I will ever use, it's going into my favourites!!!! I love it as is and it is so versatile that you can do numerous changes. You can add vanilla and cinnamon, nutmeg, chocolate chips, walnuts, pecans.......etc. the choice is yours!! I used whole grain flour, also changed the butter to coconut oil, used coconut palm sugar. Thanks Abi for the amazing recipe!!!

Great muffin, it has a great taste. As per someone's suggestion I made the mix the night before and baked it this morning. In the mix I used LACTOSE FREE margarine instead of melted butter. I didn't melt the margarine, just mixed it in, because I figured margarine's soft and will mix no problem. I also didn't use the whole 1/3 cup, and the muffins were still moist. I didn't over-mix. While mixing, the batter looked like it had too much flour, it had a thick consistency to it,but it turned out great; I just mixed until it was combined and left it in the fridge for the night. It was very easy to fill the muffin cups. It made 12 average sized muffins. They rose wonderfully and look so good! I waited until they cooled and ate two. You can definitely taste the banana, in a pleasant way. The flavour of the banana plus the sweetness (I guess from the sugar and/or sweetness of the banana?) are what you can taste the most, so if you're worried this recipe won't have flavour, don't be, it has plenty. However, the aftertaste is pretty sweet so next time I'm going to cut down the sugar by 1 or 2 TBSP and see how that turns out. I don't think it'll make too much of a difference because it's pretty sweet. Great recipe with ingredients I have on hand!

Fast and easy recipe! After reading the reviews, I decided to add in brown sugar and vanilla extract. However, I find that the recipe could use less flour and more chunks of bananas.

I highly recommend using either walnut oil or coconut oil for a subtle shift of flavor! I also add vanilla, which isn't mentioned in the recipe. Great quick muffin recipe!

Very easy to make and delicious. I added one extra bannana, used brown sugar instead of white and topped the muffins with nuts.

Delicious! This made 35 mini muffins. 12 minutes of cooking time was perfect - rotated 1/2 way through for even browning. I added 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips, 1 tsp vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon. Mix by hand only - just until moist. I'll be making these again and again for my little one (oh, and for the grown ups). Thank you for sharing this easy recipe!

Big hit both times I made these.  I did change the sugar to 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup regular granulated sugar, just because I like brown sugar.  Very good!

Wanted something tasty but pre made for breakfast in the mornings. Just finished up a batch of these and they turned out great! Next time I'm thinking of taking some advice read here and adding vanilla and maybe pecans. I made the mini ones because they are the perfect bite size for busy mornings.

This is the best recipe ever. They are so moist and taste awesome. I made some for my sisters birthday because she is going somewhere next week and she wanted them as a snack. She tasted them and she said they were really good. 
She and a few other family members think it would taste better with chocolate chips, but it was good without them as well. The muffins were moist and tender... They were just so good. They had wonderful results. One time I made muffins with a different recipe and they didn't rise very high in the oven and they tasted like flour. I threw them all away. It was a big waste of ingredients if you ask me. Every time my family has mushy bananas, we either make  muffins or banana bread.

Yum! I made these with my 3 & 5 year old.  We followed the recipe exactly. We made regular sized muffins and they took 20 minutes to bake. The muffins turned out great. We'll definitely make these again!

Loved these. Didn't change a thing. Didn't add any spices because like one reviewer said they wanted a BANANA muffin not a spice muffin. Very moist. Will make again, great use of brown bananas.

Yummy! I added 2 scoops of vanilla protein powder, and substituted Splenda for baking for the sugar. I also added a handful of dark chocolate chips! Delish!!

This recipe is amazingly simple and delicious as is but I personalized it a bit! I substituted 1/2 cup of organic buckwheat flour for the a portion of flour. Since walnuts are one of my favorites, I top the muffin cups with them and a light sprinkle of sugar before putting them in the oven. Yum - my!!!

Well, I'm done looking for a good banana muffin recipe. These were perfect. I barely blended the wet and dry to keep them from getting tough and added strawberries for my kids.

This is my go-to recipe for banana bread or muffins. With some minor tweaks, it is always a hit! I use four ripe bananas and I only use 1/2 cup of sugar. If I want to change it up a bit, I add 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips or pecans. For a banana loaf, it takes about 50 minutes.

Easy and quick recipe. Didn't have baking soda so I just doubled the powder. Tossed in some vanilla per others notes and they taste great! Was paying $5 for something similar at the grocery store now I know I can just make these fresh at home!

Great recipe! I added about 3/4 cup of chopped pecans and they made them even tastier! You have to be careful about how long you cook them though because they will dry out.

Both my two-year-old and I loved these muffins! I added a grated carrot, and used less than 1/2-cup sugar--as we aren't big on sugar. They taste delicious and are not at all dry. I was just able to get twelve muffins out of the batter.

These muffins were amazing. I made them twice in one week because they went so fast.I followed the recipe exactly but the only thing i added was a 1/2 of chocolate chips just to make it more exciting.

I made this exactly as the recipe however I sprinkled a few cinnamon chips on the top of the muffins before I put them in the oven. They were moist and tasted just like banana bread!

These were perfect! The only change I made was this: first I mashed the bananas by themselves, and added 1 tbs of brown sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon, and mixed that all up before adding the butter, white sugar and egg. So delicious!

I make these muffins at least once a week. Once I didn't have butter and used vegetable oil instead and it still turned out pretty good. This recipe is awesome.

A delicious cake-like muffin! I was out of a few items so had to do some subbing.  I used 3 tsp baking powder for the soda, used brown sugar instead of white, and used 1/2 a cup of whole wheat flour instead of the 1/2 cup of white. I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and toasted some slivered almonds and sprinkeled on top just before putting them in the oven. I used a large mufin tin and the recipe made just enough for 6 jumbo muffins. They were perfect at 25 min and ooh so good!

Great flavor and texture, super easy to make. I did add a little bit of cinnamon and clove...just enough to complement the banana flavor without dominating.  I do think they would be good with half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat flour or with some applesauce and a bit less butter. Brown sugar for all or part of the white sugar would be nice for variety, too. I always keep ripe bananas in the freezer, ready to go for muffins, cookies, smoothies or just pureed for dessert. They thawed easily in the microwave to mash for this recipe. 

We've also made them with blueberries mixed in (just toss fresh or unthawed frozen blueberries with a little of the dry mixture, then fold them in at the end). We otherwise left the recipe as listed.

I don't understand how this recipe has 5 stars.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the batter was extremely runny.  I added some more flour to try to thicken it, and it only sort of worked.  I decided to go ahead and put it in the oven, and after a few minutes, there was a strong burning smell.  I looked in the oven to find that the muffin tins were running over and spilling over the side of the tin and onto the bottom of the oven.  I had only filled the tins about 2/3 full, so this shouldn't have happened.  I gave it a few more minutes, and it continued to get worse, so I finally gave up and turned the oven off and removed the tins.  I have made banana muffins many times before, but I must not have used this recipe, because they have always turned out great before.  I am never using this recipe again.

I turned this into a great recipe for 24 cupcakes/muffins. I doubled all ingredients listed except the bananas (I didn't have 6 so I used just 3) and added cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 cup applesauce (batter was too dry otherwise). I mixed by hand with a spoon. Don't ovemix, Don't overcook and use cupcake papers. So good!

The basic recipe is great. I've used this over 10x because my kids love them. I do add whatever I have hanging around in the pantry. I have added (not all in the same batch) 1/2 c oatmeal, tsp. Vanilla, cinnamon, 1/3 c lemon honey, fruit cake citron mix, chopped walnuts, 1/4 tsp. Cayenne pepper. I also like to add Yellow food coloring to the batches to keep the banana muffins yellow.

Oh my gosh - there's no way to mess these up!  I've added too much banana, had to use nearly a cup of corn flour, and they still turn out.  I don't use butter or jelly when serving because they already taste so buttery.  We've been making tons of mini-muffins since we found this recipe.

There are two keys to making muffins, so as long as you don't mix too much and don't overbake, these will always be great for you!  When baking, your muffins are done with you can lightly push the top in and it springs back.  It you make a dent, you'll have to wait.

Very yummy! I definitely recommend adding cinnamon and vanilla (thanks for those suggestions!) and using half brown sugar. Next time I will use applesauce in place for half the butter.

Recipe made a dozen muffins, perfect!  Only change I made was to use oil in place of the butter, for cost savings....feeding 4 kids gets expensive!  Turned out wonderfully.  Oh I also added chocolate chips.

These came out good. They were tender but a tiny bit dry. I bought too many bananas and used 6 super ripe ones. Also added a tsp of vanilla, tsp of cinnamon, and two handfuls of walnuts. I would use this recipe again!

This recipe is simply perfect.
It's soft, fluffy, bakes swiftly, easy cleanup, fast to prepare,
just perfect in every way. Literally ANYONE who can operate an oven can do this.

DELICIOUS!! I am going to need to invest in a mini muffin pan because this is going to be my Go To Muffin recipe. Versatile,very easy, not messy, perfect! I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers, I added a tsp of vanilla & cinnamon to the banana mixture before folding into the dry mixture in. 30 min seems a little too long (I pulled the muffins out after 27 min. They were a nice golden brown) 
I can imagine adding cinnamon and apples to the batter, blueberries, zucchini - possibilities are endless. My 27 month old daughter ate 2 muffins immediately! Next time I'll use applesauce instead of butter. Wonderful recipe, thank you for sharing!

Made it for some friends last night. Super easy recipe so I was able to make them between my turns of the game. Everyone raved over them and most ate a second! I made half with walnuts and chocolate chips for variation and those went over even better, but the original recipe is great on its own!

Just made this recipe, it was so easy! I added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla as one other reviewer said they did, and put a few blueberries on top of half of them. You can really taste the banana. I will definitely make these again!

I used Gluten free Flour!!  Delicious.  I followed suggestions of 1/2 sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, touch of vanilla and Cinnamon, and added I heaping TB of Mayonnaise!  In five muffins I thru in semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Very yummy.  Best banana muffins ever.  I used to have a favorite recipe for banana muffins..it has now been replaced:-)

I have made this recipe a total of five times using the suggestions from earlier posts as a guide along with what's printed.  I find that old bananas (yes the ones with black skins) make the best muffins and I also use six instead of the printed three and a cup of sugar too.  I usually get approximately 18 muffins and my family devours it usually within the first day.  A staple in my kitchen, these muffins are well received by everyone who comes by also.

I read the reviews and decided to use cinnamon applesauce instead of butter and added a touch of vanilla.  I made 24 mini muffins in the little paper cups and poured the rest of the batter into a mini loaf pan.  The mini muffins cooked up well in about 23 minutes, but they stuck to the paper cups; I've never had to spray the paper cups before but perhaps I should have?  I'm still waiting on the banana bread as it wasn't cooked at the 30-min mark.  I'm not sure if I'll try this recipe again because my old standby banana bread recipe is really the best one I've tried.

Great!  The banana to muffin ratio makes for very moist banana-y muffins!  I throw in 1/2 cup of chocolate chips at the last minute because it makes my kids happy.

These are just good, normal, easy-to-make banana muffins. I made them exactly as the recipe said and they are very quick and easy. I think if I added just a little more sugar and banana they would taste like the Otis Spunkmeyer muffins. They are very light colored, so take them out before they brown. Mine were still light on top but the bottoms were just a teensy bit over cooked. Next time I'll take them out a minute sooner.

AWESOMENESS! i even used whole wheat flour, added quick oats for even more fiber, a dash of cinnamon and vanilla and all of these gave the flavor a BOOST!  My first time making these was a HIT with my family.  My next was a hit with my Sunday School.  They continue to be a favorite of my family.

Delicious!!! I doubled the recipe and added 1.5 cups of chopped pecans. Very easy to make and aside from the banana I had everything on hand. These are an easy way to sweeten any breakfast o brunch.

I love this recipe! It's so easy to make. I'm not that great at baking .. but these muffins came out perfect. The only thing I added was 2 tsp of cinnamon and 2 tsp of vanilla. Baked it in the oven for 25 min. Eating it the next day now and its still soft and moist.

I made this recipe with1 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of fructose.  This combo does not compromise flavor but cuts down on sugar and fat.

Fantastic recipe! I used Splenda instead of the sugar and added a splash of vanilla and chopped walnuts into the batter before spooning into the muffin tins. The cooking time skewed a bit to the higher range but they turned out perfectly!

This is my favorite Banana Muffin template recipe. The things I changed were instead of 3/4 of white sugar, try 1 cup of brown sugar and 4 banana's. It turns them a golden brown and gives it a great taste.

My favorite Banana muffin recipe! I'll add chocolate chips, or nuts or dried fruit like dried mango... my kids love these muffins too... it's my most used muffin recipe. I just throw all the ingredients into the food processor, bake in muffin tins and they always come out perfect.

Just made these with adding teaspoon vanilla extract and a pinch of cinnammon. Turned out greaat. I made mini muffins, had to put them a little more than 15 min in the oven I think I might have filled up the cups a little much, but after rising they were great.

Great use of leftover bananas.  Next time you have a brown banana hanging around, toss it in the freezer in a ziplock bag.  After a few weeks, you should have enough to whip up a batch or two of these easy and delicious muffins - all the ingredients already on hand.  I use a potato masher to smash my bananas up well.  Toss in some mini-chocolate chips, too.  Not too many, just enough to add a little richness. 
Everyone loves these!

i loved this recipe.  Just add a third of a cup less banana so they aren't mushy.  the first time i made them i changed the serving size.  Bad idea.  The banana made the muffins waaaay to mushy.  So just add a bit less banana and you're good to go.

This is a keeper that is for sure! The muffins are so fluffy that the family devoured them as soon as they came out of the oven!!!!!! The only change I made was to substitute the sugar with sweetener and I put one more banana in the recipe. Bananalicious!

This recipe was perfect! Made some changes according to the other reviewers. I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. I also decreased the baking time because my oven is quite strong. I also added some milk chocolate chips on top for some additional sweetness! Ended up with such a moist cake-like banana muffin! YUMM!

I have made these muffins a couple of times with my 1 1/2 year old. She loves mashing up the bananas and stirring all of the ingredients together and this is the perfect easy recipe for her to do that!
We always make them into mini-muffins and they turn out perfectly. though, the first time I made these there were lumps of baking powder in them, my daughter still liked them. We always stick them in the freezer for a quick breakfast or snack. They're wonderfully moist and sweet!

Soft and flavorful. Super quick and easy!  I love a good baking recipe that's delicious on it's own, but also plays well with minor adjustments. I have tried substituting some of the white sugar with brown sugar, delicious. I often add sliced almonds just before putting into the muffin cups. A splash of vanilla made an amazing addition as well.

This recipe is delicious! I followed all the instructions, including the very helpful comment to not mix the wet and dry items together too much. They came out wonderful! I love that these don't use oil or too much sugar either. I meant to save them for breakfast tomorrow but quite a few have already disappeared!

Very easy and delicious. I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and 1 cup of white flour. I also added chocolate chips to some of them for a treat!

These were a hit with my family this morning.  I substituted coconut oil for the butter and used 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar.  I also added a dash of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. vanilla for extra yum!

I messed up and mixed the wet ingredients. So I added 2 bananas to the mixture (in addition to the recommended amount) and my muffins were super moist! If you want and easy and fast recipe, look no further.

Good and easy recipe.  Was able to make these up quickly for my toddlers breakfast the morning of.  Did overmix the wet and dry ingredients.  Forgot to add the cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla - will have to try that next time.

These were great as mini muffins.  I have another recipe that uses sour cream or yogurt, but this recipe is even more moist and delicious.  Maybe it is all the butter? I did add a little vanilla and cinnamon too.

These are so easy to make and so delicious! My family all agree that it was one of the best tasting muffins they've ever tried! Unlike some of the users have suggested, I did not add any spices to the mixed, but I've made a few alternations to this recipe: 1) I used brown sugar instead of white 2)replaced butter with canola oil. It came out really great, moist and light. I would say the key is to use really ripened bananas and to gently fold the dry ingredients in.

An easy recipe.  I dumped some vanilla extract in it, a little bit of sour cream (maybe 2 tbsp), added a crumble on some.  The ones without the crumble are way better.  Very nice - moist and delicious! I also used three bananas and one plantain that I had frozen.

My family adores these!  My daughter requests them every year for her birthday breakfast as well.  The cook time and recipe are spot on when I make the large muffins.  I always use paper liners and add vanilla and cinnamon to the mix.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Perfect recipe!

These muffins were a nice change from banana bread. I did use whole wheat flour, add vanilla, & cinnamon. Very moist & tasty. They tasted very much like a banana muffin. I hand folded the wet & dry ingredients. I may add walnuts to the next batch.

Great recipe! The only thing I changed was I substituted a 1/4 cup of brown sugar for part of the white sugar. Might up the brown sugar to white sugar ratio next time. I also added a scoop of vanilla protein powder because we are trying to eat more protein in our diets these days while we workout. This was a great addition to my morning eggs for breakfast. And these are seriously the only muffins I have ever been able to achieve big, full muffin tops with so that was very pleasing to me too. The kiddo gobbled one up in a flash too! Family approved for sure.

This is so easy to make and everyone loves it.  I made some modifications.
I used whole wheat and organic pastry flower.
Substituted the white sugar with natural "sugar in the raw"
And used safflower oil instead of butter.
Sifting is essential and FOLD the dry ingredients into the wet.
I used a nonstick muffin pan and didn't need to "grease" the pan.
Fantastic

Delicious! turned out great. very easy to make. I substituted the flour with a GF flour blend, and they turned out wonderfully. very moist, didn't stick to the muffin papers, and SO much flavor. Super yummy. Definitely one of my new go-to recipes.

These were wonderful, moist and flavorful. I was going to add a little bit of vanilla and cinnamon then forgot and they tasted great without.  I did do a double batch so I could share with the grandkids (glad I did!)  This is my new favorite banana bread recipe.

Made as directed.  They were not too sweet, which was a surprise but nice. Especially
because they were for my kids. They were a bit dry and I was careful not to over mix. Maybe adding another banana would help or some sour cream. They did not last long.

These muffins are great AS IS!  I love that the recipe doesn't call for many ingredients.  I had some over-ripe bananas to get rid of and was happy to see I didn't have to go to the store to get anything special for this recipe.  We made the mini-muffins and they're so simple and great!

FANTASTIC!!  Made them with whole wheat flour for my three year old's class and they loved them (so did the parents).  I had trouble stretching the batter to make the 48 mini's.  When they were done I realized that just putting one spoonful of batter per well was more than enough to make the small muffins.

I added 3 tbsp. of chia seeds to the mix as well as 1 tbsp. of olive oil.  The texture was good, I thought it could have been a little sweeter. The kids and the hubby liked them, so we'll do them again.

Baked these in muffin cases and yielded about 11. I prefer my muffins bigger. Sprinkled chopped walnuts on the top. Yum! My roommate grabbed one on her way to class and sent a text exclaiming how yummy it was. Texture is exactly how I envisioned it to be - tender and perfect amount of flavor.

I just used this recipe, and I did add a tsp of cinnamon, and an extra banana (since I had 4 that I needed to use up) and I used margarine instead of butter, and I put in grated chocolate  and it turned out great!!!  My kids loved them, I will absolutely use this recipe over and over.

A lovely moist and flavorful muffin. I will definitely make them again but will reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup as I found them a little too sweet for my palate. Children may enjoy adding 1/2 cup of chocolate chips if the sugar is reduced.

Excellent recipe!  Very moist.  The only changes I made was to substitute 1/2 cup of the flour with 1/4 cup flax meal and 1/4 cup wheat germ, and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon; II also only had two bananas on hand, but it didn't seem to matter.  My new banana recipe.

These were good. I had two, almost rotting bananas that I needed to get rid of. Even though this recipe calls for 3 bananas, I used it. And they came out great :) The only changes I made was 2 bananas instead of 3, I added in 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon (to make up on flavor for the missing banana). Also, as I was making them, I started craving something chocolaty so I threw in about 1/4 cup of chocolate chips and about 1/8 cup a mini chocolate chips (I didn't have enough regular chocolate chips left). But everything came out great! I baked 12 regular muffins @ 350 for about 23 minutes. I will deff be making these again, the same way I just did but maybe take them out at 20 minutes. (mine were a tiny tiny bit dry, but still so flavorful and awesome!) Thanks for the recipe :)

This is a pretty perfect banana muffin recipe for BIG banana flavor. Moist and yummy! I followed the recipe exactly, despite my tendency to put vanilla in everything. I'll probably add vanilla next time, because I did miss it, but I still loved the muffins.

Great recipe.  Added the spices as suggested.  I also used my new Whoopie Pie tin and as my filling I used the new cool whip cream cheese frosting.  Amazing!  Next time I may add a layer of strawberry jelly in the filling.

It turned out wonderfully even though i have changed the recipe for a bit to fit our lifestyle. My little one cant have daily product so i used vegetable oil instead, plus i added vanilla and cinnamon for more flavour. I also reduced sugar to 1/2 cup since i think my banana is so ripe and there are already have natural sweetness in them. The kids love it and it also a perfect treat

I added some pecans on top and they were delicious. Next time I'll use apple sauce instead of margerine just to try it.

Excellent muffins! I did add a sprinkle of cinnamon and a drop of vanilla extract to mine. I also only had 2 bananas on hand but they still had lots of nice banana flavor.  My daughter loves them and the house smells sooo good.  Thanks!

These were easy and delicious!  I was looking for something different than banana bread and these were perfect.  I used 3 1/2 bananas and added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/3 c dried cranberries, and 1/3 c coarsely chopped walnuts.  I mixed the wet and dry ingredients just until moist and used the same baking time and temp...these disappeared quickly!!

This is a very simple, easy, and classic recipe for banana muffins. They definitely do not need to be baked any longer than 25 minutes. Sometimes I use 4 bananas rather than 3 to avoid leaving me with one very lonely banana. The muffins still come out perfect. Other reviewers added vanilla - the recipe is great both with and without this ingredient. Happy baking!

I made this recipe exactly but substituted whole wheat flour as an attempt to be healthier for my daycare children. They came out perfect! The toddlers gave them a big thumbs up. So did the husband. Needless to say, no leftovers.

These muffins were so easy to make and so yummy. I did substitute the sugar for 1/2 cup honey for a slightly healthier version. Will definitely be making again. I'll try to sub butter for applesauce next time.

Excellent. I am eating one just out of the oven and I am very impressed. Made some changes myself: added ~1 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 cup chocolate chips, and used whole wheat flour and brown sugar. Think I am going to eat another one! Very addicting.

Followed the recipe exactly and these are perfect banana muffins! They are very light -- not dense at all, like some banana breads can be. I'm going to make them again and add some crushed pineapple and coconut. I think that would make a wonderful "tropical" muffin. Mine baked in 20 minutes, but my oven tends to cook hot. Thanks for a great recipe -- now I won't mind so much when DH buys too many bananas at the store!

Delicious muffins.  If you blend the wet ingredients so that there are still banana chunks, it tastes SO GOOD.  A sprinkle of sugar on top adds a little sweetness.

I loved this recipe!  Oh, I did use brown sugar rather than white and half whole wheat pastry flour and substituted applesauce for the butter.  They were delish!  Oh and I added half cup nuts!

I wasn't sure how these could be 5 stars...they seem so simple. And yet, they are 5 stars. Moist. Tender. Very flavorful. I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon for a subtle spice. Banana flavor came through beautifully. I topped with chopped walnuts and sprinkled with raw sugar. Everyone agreed these are some of the best banana nut muffins we've tried so far.

These are amazing! and perfect. I followed the recipe exactly, except for I used 2 bananas and a 4 oz container of apple sauce rather than 3 bananas, and I added a splash of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. So easy and moist, these are the best! The amount of batter is perfect for 12 large muffins.

Made some changes, used unsweetened apple sauce instead of butter, added less white sugar(1/2 cup), and also added 1 teaspoon cinnamon and half a cup of broken up almond slices. Turned out great, healthy and delicious!!

I made these muffins for breakfast today and my family loved them. My toddler even helped make them! She had fun mashing bananas, mixing and adding cinnamon. In addition to cinnamon, I added vanilla extract, and on half of the muffins I sprinkled coconut on top.

These muffins were delicious and the perfect texture.  I followed other suggestions and made sure I didn't mix (fold) too much.  I did add about a teaspoon of vanilla and used 4 medium bananas.  I made 6 extra large muffins and they were perfect in 28 minutes.  Will definitely make again.

I really wanted to make banana muffins but I didn't have eggs so I used this recipe with alterations. I increased the amount of baking powder by about 1/4 teaspoon and added juice. The juice was Bolthouse Farms C-Boost...it has mangos, pears, and cherries, but you really can't taste that once the muffins are baked. I added the juice in order to improve the texture of the batter. Without eggs, the texture can be extremely dense. If you're going to use juice, I suggest pouring in a little bit at a time, mixing it in, and then seeing if you need more. You don't want to spoil the batter by using too heavy of a hand. 
These turned out delicious and fluffy, and they could easily be made vegan by just replacing the butter with an oil!

Super simple and super tasty.  I thought I would make it once and probably need to add things to it since it seemed too simple, but it is just right like this.  Thanks for a great recipe my 4 and 7 year old kids love.

Loved the muffins!! I did alterations to my recipe - used whole wheat flour (sifted it with the dry ingredients), added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 cup shredded coconut, 1/2 cup brown sugar, handful roasted walnut pieces and decorated the top of each muffin with a roasted pecan. I got a dozen muffins which were in the oven for 20 mins and they came out looking beautiful.

This recipe turns out perfectly every time.  I have it memorized & use it immediately whenever I have some aging bananas!  I add 1/4 cup chopped walnuts or pecans and it's PERFECT.

Delicious and quick, I mash 3 bananas at a time when they are not going to be consumed fast enough and freeze in zip lock bags for use at a later date. It makes these muffins quick and easy for an afternoon snack for the kids or a lunch box snack for school. I add a quarter cup of chocolate chips and half cup of walnuts for extra nutrition. Just wet the dry ingredients as the recipe suggests otherwise they will be dry!

Quick, easy & delicious!  Made them just as recipe says except I found a great chocolate glaze that I used on half of them.  Definitely a new go to recipe for me.

Followed the recipe as is using whole wheat flour. They are great fresh and it took 20 minutes to bake. I might add another banana next time :)

To make it vegan I used 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed + 3 tablespoons of water which equals one egg. I also used margarine instead of butter. They turned out soft, moist and light - not soggy at all.

Second time rating this recipe and have to say it's gotten to the point that I buy bananas and patiently watch them rippen so I can make this recipe! Love it and have only changed the baking time. I reduced it to under 20 minutes for large muffins (lower baking time for smaller muffins). Make sure your bananas are very ripe, almost mushy and it's ok to fold until all is mixed. Reduce baking time keeps them moist.

THE BEST! I added 1 small carton of lemon yogurt and left out the oil/butter.  Also made an almond/butter topping (upside down style).  Even our pickiest eater asked for seconds!  And he NEVER finishes breakfast.  My 18 year old son said to please keep the recipe!

Made these with the kids, to replace the hostess banana walnut mini-muffins. We added chopped walnuts and made them in mini tins. Excellent! Took the advice of many and didn't stir wet and dry ingredients much.

These were great but I think it could have used more banana. next time I'll add one to two more. Overall this is a great recipe with great flavor and texture. (I did add walnuts, cinnamon,vanilla and nutmeg though as other reviewers had suggested).

So good!  I also added 1t cinnamon, 1t vanilla and 1/4t nutmeg.  We made mini muffins (made 24 of them) and they were done in 10 minutes.  We all loved them...even my picky toddler, who ate 3 of them.

Almost as good as a regular banana bread!  I added a splash of vanilla, next time I'm going to add a bit of sour cream as well.

I just made these.  I had more than three mushy bananas so I just used them all, I think there were five. And I forgot the butter, (I melted it in the microwave and then just forgot about it) but they came out just fine!  I would absolutely make these again!  I can't wait for my family to try them! Oh!  And I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, a cap-full of vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon. So YUMMY!!

This worked out perfectly. Beat the butter banana and sugar and then hand mix in the dry ingredient until just moistened.

I've used this recipe three times now! First time I followed it exactly and they were great! Second time I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 a cup all purpose, and they were okay but a little too wheat tasting. Third time I used half WW half all purpose flour and used just over 1/2 a cup of pure organic coconut sugar instead of the 3/4 cup of white sugar as it calls for and they are DELICIOUS! Best yet!! And coconut sugar is so much better for you. Highly recommend trying this!! Also I found that it can easily make 18 muffins if you just don't fill the cups right to the top.

Perfect!! It was moist and not to sweet. I added some vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon. I also mixed in some chocolate chips for the kids and for the adults I added blueberries and walnuts.

I had a few overripe bananas so I wanted to make a batch of muffins.  I couldn't find my usual recipe so I looked to Allrecipes for a solution.  I could not have made a better choice!  This recipe is super simple, and calls for things you keep in your cabinet year round.  Very delicious, very moist.  A big hit with our 4 teenage sons!

I made these this afternoon. they turned out great. I did use 4 bananas because that's what I had and I always throw in extra banana when doing banana bread so figured it wouldn't hurt.   I can't vouch for the butter in the recipe but I'm sure its great. I used 1/3 c. coconut oil instead of 1/3 cup butter. I also mixed in about a cup of flaked coconut. I tried one right out of the oven (too hot to hold) because I couldn't wait and it was good, but I thought could be sweeter.  but when I tried one again later after they were cool I found they were sweet enough and I really like them.   this recipe is a easy fast recipe to throw together and can easily be adjusted for taste (less sweet/more sweet) mix ins, etc.   i will be making these again when i have over ripe bananas to use up.

Delicious! I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and an extra banana. I also put in less sugar (1/2 cup of soft brown sugar). I'm a brown sugar fan :) This recipe was really fun to make, too- I think I'm going to try it with my student tomorrow!

Awesome.  Came out perfect even using two bananas and a splash of vanilla.  Second time around I subbed 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour since I only had a cup of all purpose left and some veg shortening for part of the butter, because I was also out of butter.  We'll see how it turns out.  Either way a great recipe - my family loved them.

I just tried this recipe, personally I think these are the moistest and not to mention the most flavour full banana muffins I have ever made. I did make one addition and two substitutions. I added 1 tbsp of sour cream, supstituted one 3/4 cups white sugar for 2/4 cups of brown sugar an 1/4 cup of white sugar, I also used margarine instead of butter. None the less they turned out beautifully and this recipe gets an A+ from me, definately worth the try and because of it's simplicity it is a very easy recipe to have fun with.

We loved these muffins.  I followed it exactly because I think that is the only way you can really critique a recipe.  They were moist and yummy!!!  I liked them better than my banana bread. I will definitely make again and again.  Always have the ingredients in my cupboard and bananas on hand.  Thank you  ABI_Godfrey

These make an excellent base for a banana muffin, and are easy to customize for whatever flavours you like. I substituted the butter for melted coconut oil. I also added some crushed walnuts, coconut, cinnamon, and vanilla. Tasty!

I'm not much of a baker so I was looking for a easy and great recipe--I found it! The muffins turned out so great they looked store-bought; it rose well, the color was perfect, and it popped right out of the pan with no problem. I took the muffins out 5 minutes before the suggested time and they were moist and perfect!

Used 1 c applesauce and 2 medium bananas, and they turned out very moist.  Also used Earth's Balance baking sticks instead of butter to make it a dairy free recipe and added in dairy free choc chips for a yummy treat for my milk allergic daughter!

Very easy and tasty.  I feel the butter and/or salt was a little much.  I will try to substitute applesauce for some of the butter but hope it doesn't change the texture bc the texture per the recipe it is just right Not to dense). I added mini choco chips!

I added 1tsp vanilla, 1tsp cinnamon, swapped the oil for butter and added chocolate chips. It turned out moist and fluffy. Flavour was really good. I made sure not to overmix or overbake. Checked the muffins with a skewer every 2 mins after the first 10 mins and they were ready in about 15 mins. Funny thing is the tops of the muffins became quite damp the next day. Don't know why that is. Maybe because of condensation? And I live in a humid area. Will definitely make again. So fast and simple!

these were quick and easy to make and turned out great! 25 minutes in the oven was enough for me. I ate two before I even sat down! When making 24 minis, I needed more like 16-18 minutes.

I just made this and it turned out so good. I only had 2 bananas, but it still had the banana taste and it was so moist. I didn't have any eggs, so I ended up using 3 tablespoons of mayo in place of the eggs. I did put some vanilla and cinnamon in the batter. I have never had such a moist muffin like this one. I will be buying eggs and making this alot. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Very moist and yummy. Only change was to add 1 tsp vanilla per other suggestions. Made 12 regular size "cupcakes". Would make again.

I was unimpressed. It's just banana bread in muffin form when I was looking for more of a hearty breakfast muffin. I'll keep looking!

Made these this morning for the first time. My daughter, who doesn't like banana bread or pumpkin bread - is now eating her third one. These are super easy; and super delicious.

This recipe was absolutely delicious and easy to make. The muffins are very moist and can really taste the butter in them. Before I baked them I also sprinkled some toffee bits on top and it is a great compliment to a bananas. Will most definitely make again.

I have made these muffins two times in the past week and everyone loves them!  However, both times I only had 2 bananas on hand.  So, I added an equivalent (eye-balled) amount of delicious homemade apple butter put up by my friend.  The apple butter is very tasty and dark, lots of spices! And has a thicker consistency, which makes it a good substitute for a banana.

Delicious muffins! I substituted some of the white sugar for brown and added some vanilla to taste and they turned out excellent. Incredibly moist and a great banana flavour! Baked some of the muffins in little muffin pans and they turned out as perfect little-bite sized muffins :)

Perfect to make with kids! I just did it with my Kindergarten students and they turned out great.  We used canola oil (no butter) and they still tasted good.  I will make them with my class again!

Very delicious, the brown fibers from the bananas hardening in the muffins was kinda wierd. But it was very good, although a bit sweet.

Love these! I substituted 1/4 c. of the sugar for stevia cup for cup and subbed 1/2 c. of the flour for whole wheat and used 1/3 c. of applesauce rather than the butter and cooked them for 21 minutes - they were PERFECT! My kids (ages 1 and 4) loved them too. Will be keeping this recipe.

Moist & delicious. I added the spices suggested, and certainly nuts. Next time will try the applesauce idea instead of butter. But very very good.

Amazingly easy and amazingly delicious!  I added vanilla extract and used raw sugar instead of white sugar.  These were so moist and delicious, and took just a few minutes to put together.

These are a go to recipe in our house now.  Make extra and stock in the freezer.  Kids love them and can help make them.  Not to mention I always have the ingredients on hand.  If I have bananas that are starting to turn - I just whip up some of these muffins.

This is the best banana muffin recipe! My 6 yr old daughter and I made them today and her review was "mmm mmm mmm." They were so moist. After reading some of the reviews I tweaked the recipe by adding 1/2 C of brown sugar and 1/4 C of white sugar, a 1/2 tsp vanilla, dash of cinnamon, and some chocolate chips. Just perfect!

Followed FrugalistaJess's suggestion and added the nuts cinnamon and vanilla. Very good, I cooked them a little too long but if cooked correctly these would be terrific.

Great recipe!  Not overly greasy or too dry, but just right!  I added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 3/4 c. ground walnuts, and they were delicious.    The recipe made 36 mini-muffins, which I baked for 15 minutes.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I used whole wheat flour and applesauce in place of the butter. These turned out great & will be rotated in our routine of muffins for Sunday breakfast.

Due to what I had on hand, I used 1/2 C sugar 1/4 C brown sugar, 1 C flour, 1/2 C whole wheat flour and for personal taste added a dash of nutmeg.  Before baking I sprinkled with pecans and then brown sugar so it would carmalized them while baking....delish!  Very good recipe and simple.  We all loved them.

I added 1/2 cup grated carrots, 1/2 cup golden raisins and 1/2 cup walnuts (in addition to the 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cinnamon recommended by other reviewers) with AMAZING results.  Cooking time is increased, so use the press method to test for doneness.

I made this for my daughter's sleepover party and the girls loved it! I reduced sugar to half and used all natural sugar. I also used half butter and half canola oil (will try applesauce next time). I added 1/4 wheat bran and 1 cup of chopped walnuts and it turned out so yummy! I did bake 5 more minutes to make sure the top is light brown. Saved this recipe and will reuse it again and again!

I had to give these muffins at 4 out of 5 because most of mine didn't bake in the middle! I made the large muffins instead of the mini muffins....so that could be one of the reasons. I ate the couple of muffins that were done through and was pleased with them! These are easy to whip up and have great banana flavor!

These muffins came out perfectly.  I made my own topping with brown sugar, buttter, sliced almonds and a hint of cinnamon, and they were unbelievably good.   I also added a pinch of cinnamon to the batter (sifted with the flour) and a splash of vanilla.  I think they really helped bring out the banana flavor without overpowering it.  (Just a pinch!) Really awesome basic & easy recipe, extremely delicious.

I made these using Splenda instead of sugar and also used one small cup of applesauce instead of the butter. They are very good but are sticking a little to the paper cup.

I've made these about 10 times now, each time I have some over-ripe bananas. They turn out delicious each time! I've added a few spices at various times, but it hasn't really added to the beautiful and overwhelming flavour of the bananas.  The only thing I find hard is that they don't rise very well. I've tried doubling the baking powder, but that made no difference. I'm wondering if there's a certain combination of mixing, initial oven temperature and other factors that has to be spot-on before I can get nicely puffed-up muffins.

PERFECTION! Just make sure to mash bananas before mixing with the rest of the ingredients, otherwise, you'll have uncooked banana chunks in the muffin, like I did. Also added walnuts and it was a nice addition.

definitely a keeper. I changed the white sugar to brown and also added 1 cup of frozen blueberries. These muffins come out light and springy, unlike some other recipes that are very dense.

So easy and great! I didn't have an egg so I substituted 2 tbsp corn starch beat with 2 tbsp water and turned out fine! Next time I'll add chocolate chips to if I have them!

Very tasty. Moist and flavorful I did follow the recommendations and used a cap full of vanilla and a few dashes of cinnamon. Could use less sugar they are sweet but not so sweet it has to be reduced. I also like that their is enough batter to make 12 big muffins

This has become one of my favorite recipes.  My family loves these muffins, with or without nuts (walnuts or pecans).  I also add about a teaspoon of cinnamon and a half teaspoon of nutmeg to the dry ingredients.  This is a really easy and quick recipe.

The muffins were fabulous except that we could taste the baking soda.  Any suggestions?  do I just need to mix them more?

Yum!  I love this muffins! I have made them with the recipe on this page, I have aded walnuts, I have made them with whole wheat flour or less sugar. No matter how I make them, they always come out tasty. It's a great recipe to follow or tweak. The only suggestion I have to make is that I prefer to have a vanilla flavor to my muffins, so I add a teaspoon of vanilla each time. Enjoy!

I only used two bananas (all i had), added walnuts & a tsp of vanilla. They were yummy! Very banana-y. I think three bananas would've been overkill.

These mix up so quickly and are simply delicious. As suggested by other reviewers, I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and added some vanilla and cinnamon. (I also decreased the sugar as we don't like our muffins too sweet.) Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is great!  I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon and vanilla, and I used some bananas I had previously frozen, which I think affected the final flavor a tad, but otherwise they turned out awesome :)  Also, I had to decrease the time to around 8 mins for my mini-muffins, but I always have to decrease the time w/ this particular pan.

Great recipe! I made a few changes based on other reviewers, I used 3/4 of a cup of whole wheat flour and 3/4 white. I used only a couple TB of melted butter and used apple sauce for the remaining 1/3 of a cup. I also used 1/2 a cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup of white, 1 ts vanilla, 1/8 ts nutmeg, 1/8 ts cinnamon, and some chopped pecans. They turned out great! Thanks so much for the recipe!

These were great!  I followed the advice of others and added some cake spice (cinnamon and such) and I cut back on the white sugar to 1/2 cup plus 1/8 cup.  I also added a bit of vanilla.  I only had two bananas so I had to add almost two tablespoons of milk to get the batter the right consistancy.    I baked these in mini muffin tins for about 13 minutes.  They are yummy!

Excellent!  I added fresh blueberries and they turned out spectacular!  I think the key is very ripe bananas to give that sweetness.

These made 32 mini muffins, which are so much better since they're is a lot more of the top. I just popped them in the oven for about 18 - 20 min at the same temp.

Tried adding a little brown sugar or cinnamon (or both) on top, but it wasn't a good idea. These are perfect as is.

Hiee... made these muffins 10 mins ago and they are looking nice. I halved the recipe and I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. I also added walnuts and vanilla extract. I added salt according to the measurements given in the recipe... but I think it should have been a bit lesser.   Overall, the muffins are nice and moist. I think I'l make them again with little or no salt :-)

BEST BANANA MUFFINS - EVER!!!   Seriously.  These were so easy to make and so incredibly delicious - especially right out of the oven.  They melted in my mouth.  Here's some changes I made: I used 3/4 cup all-purpose flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour.  I added 1 tsp vanilla to the wet stuff and 1 tsp cinnamon to the dry stuff.  Yummy!  Thanks so much for the simple, delicious recipe!

used some cinnamon and cloves, just under 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 whole wheat flour. I also put some peanut butter cream cheese frosting blobs I had left over from a cake in the center.. kind of made a hole in the center, but it spread the peanut butter flavor throughout the entire muffin. So.... so good.

Really good muffins, also added vanilla and cinnamon. I like sweet but they were a little too sweet. Might cut out some of the sugar next time or use applesauce instead... This recipe is a keeper though!

I really love this! It's so incredibly moist. It is a little sweeter than i thought, but that may be becasue the bananas i used were very ripe and sweet.   Like others I altered it slightly. I used 4 small-medium bananas (I didn't had large ones) and I added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla, and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. Also, I separated the egg and whipped the eggwhite into soft peaks. I folded in the other wet ingredients most of the way and then folded in the eggwhite. It made the muffins a bit more airy. I am very happy with the results.

So easy and super yummy!  I used 4 small bananas but they aren't very banana-y.  Could use more, but I did add vanilla, cinnamon and chocolate chips, as they are for my sons preschool class snake.

I make these muffins about twice a month.  Sometimes I throw in a handful of mini chocolate chips, some vanilla, or cinnamon.  Also makes for a yummy bread.  Just have to increase the cooking time (I start at 35 minutes then check it every couple minutes for doneness.)

I lowered sugar to 1/2 c.  These were great and my kids keep asking for them.  Nice addition to supper or as a snack. I used 4 medium bananas.

Simple to make - and just a wonderful flavor.  I had 4 ripe bananas and I really think you can add even more if you have them - it just adds to the flavor. For convection baking at 350degrees - 18 minutes was perfect for 12 regular size muffins.   A keeper!

Great recipe! I did 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, added a tablespoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of cinnamon. Mix everything together and let it sit in the refrigerator over night & make them in the morning. They are so moist that way!!

Great muffins!!! I followed the recipe exactly and only added walnuts on the tops. Definitely take the advice mentioned by others and don't over-mix the dry ingredients with the wet ones. I can't wait to make these again!!!

Absolutely delicious recipe- the muffins are moist and perfectly soft. I also sprinkled roughly chopped almonds on top before baking, and they added a nice little crunch. As some other users, I added a little splash of vanilla essence and cinnamon.  I've made these many times, and everyone who eats them just can't get enough!

I love this recipe!  I do not like nuts at all in my baked good and needed a simple recipe to use 3 1/2 bananas before they went bad.  Adding that extra 1/2 of a banana made the muffins nice and moist just the way I like them.  Thaank you for this recipe I have been in dier need of a great banana recipe! -Kayla

Easy to make and my two young kids loved them. I like how they're not too flaky and crumbly once baked.  I used applesauce instead of butter and added cinnamon and vanilla.  Yummy!  I will be making these again.

This is a good basic recipe and it doesn't call for a huge batch of overripe bananas.  I tweaked it a little by adding 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla.  I also made half the batch with chopped walnuts and the other half with mini choc. chips.  They made about 36 in the mini muffin size.  This recipe turned out moist and flavorful.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and made sure to not overmix the wet and dry ingredients, and they turned out wonderfully. Before I even removed all of them from the pan, my family had devoured the majority. I will definitely be using this recipe again...and again.

Delicious muffins. I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour.  Also added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon in the first batch. Added 1/2 cup walnuts to the second batch for my husband.  Might have to add a few chocolate chips for me to the next batch.  19 minutes bake time.

I loved that the recipe is very simple.  I substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for the white flour to add some whole grain, and they came out great. The recipe made 40 mini muffins, and my one and three year old really enjoyed them!

Very Easy - My 8 year old daughter made them.  She made them with Splenda for baking, they almost taste like they were made with real sugar since this recipe relies on the banannas for sweetness.

I always make these when we have ripe bananas, my family loves them, they even ask me to go buy ripe bananas just to make it, Only thing I do different is use brown sugar instead of white...and bake it in small bread/loaf pans...DELISHHHH!

Very good recipe! I enjoyed it! The only thing is that it said to mix the ingredients until smooth. I was always told to mix lightly and that the batter SHOULD be lumpy when making muffins. Otherwise excellent recipe!

These might possibly be the best muffins I have ever eaten, and certainly the best I have ever made!  I did add 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla, but other than that I followed the recipe.  These will not last long in my house!  Thanks!

These are delicious! : Substituted applesauce for the butter, added 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  Great way to use up those overripe bananas, thanks!

I added a ton of chopped walnuts but otherwise stuck with the recipe.  Like others, I barely mixed the wet and the dry ingredients.  My super fussy friend said, "Best muffin ever!" I'm going to buy extra bananas just to let them get over ripe in order to make these again.

Substituted applesauce for the butter, used 100% www instead, and cut down the sugar to 1/2 a cup -- turned out great, and I don't even have to feel too guilty about eating them! They did stick to the muffin cups though, so I have to find a way around that. Also, added cinnamon and vanilla to boost the taste.

I pretty much followed the recipe except for the addiiton of vanilla, cinnamon and walnuts.  The muffins were okay but a little on the dry side.  May try adding some applesauce when trying them again.

I tweaked the recipe a bit. I added 1 tsp Vanilla, 1/3 cup light fresh milk, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown suger, chopped walnuts, and 3/4 a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Turned out moist and kept for over a week in the fridge without drying out.

Great for anyone who likes banana bread! I added a splash of vanilla to my batter (about 1 TSP). In my opinion, it added a bit more flavor to the muffins. Since I altered it slightly, I gave it a 4.

I made some modifications but it still turned out wonderful! I used whole wheat flour for half of the flour, canola oil instead of butter, and I added some greek yogurt I needed to get rid of. Great!

One of the best banana bread recipes.  Super moist, especially when using extremely overripe (black) bananas.  I think I could have reduced the sugar by another 2 TB and it would have been just as sweet.  I added walnuts, chocolate chips, and substituted with coconut oil to make a very special treat.

These were really moist. I think if I used riper bananas they would have had a stronger flavor. Otherwise these are really good especially with chopped walnuts! Thank you for the recipe.

They have great flavor and my fiance adores them but they didn't raise nearly as much as I hoped for. I will keep making this recipe for the wonderful flavor but will have to keep searching for a muffin recipe that raises more.

This is now my favorite banana muffin recipe.  I add a splash of vanilla and substitute splenda for sugar and applesauce for butter.  They come out great.  This time I added walnuts and chocolate chips.  They are delicious!

I used 3/4c wholemeal, 3/4c plain flour, vanilla,cinnamon and sultanas. This came out okay, a little on the bland side. Would probably not make this again and would try other recipes.

These just plain weren't that good. I added in chocolate chips for my kids and used VERY ripe bananas and added vanilla and they were still just a bit bland. My kids liked them, though.

I followed the recipe with a couple of additions: a pinch of cinnamon and 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips. I had to bake for 20 minutes for mini muffins. I mixed the dry ingredients together then sifted it over the wet ingredients. This resulted in less clumping which needed less stirring. Less stirring = soft muffins, not chewy. They were sooo good! I took them to work the next day and they disappeared in about an hour. With the modifications I made, this recipe yielded about 30 mini muffins. Next time I make this I'm going to also bake a few muffin tops. Mmm!

Very simple and tasty. I made it the first time with butter and the bottoms were oily. I made it the second time with applesauce instead and I actually liked it better.

Very Tasty!  I added some halved maraschino cherries and walnuts.  Used half brown sugar/half white and vanilla extract. Give this a try---you won't be disappointed.

Excellent muffins, moist and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding some walnuts, wheat germ and wheat bran. Next time I think I'll throw in a few poppy seeds too. Great use for old bananas!

Awesome recipe.  I usually do not change recipes, but I ran out of eggs and used one of my idividual sized cups of applesauce instead.  I also used vegtable oil instead of butter and I added a little bit of water, about 3 tb because the batter looked a little thick. But this is my second day of using this recipe.  Will use again. Thank you!!!

YUM!  Very easy to make.  I used an electric mixer for the wet ingredients.  I doubled the recipe and was one banana short and it was still good.  I was short on butter and added a little olive oil to make up for it.  I also sprinkled some sugar on top of each muffin before baking.  This recipe is very forgiving.

This is the same exact recipe as the "Banana Crumb Muffins" recipe, only without the topping.  It's excellent and the only recipe I use.  One time making it, I didn't have white flour, so I used whole wheat flour, and now, I make it this way every time, as the family likes it just as much.

These muffins were so good!  The only thing I did different was add a little vanilla.  I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour 1/2 regular flour and then put some flaxseeds in the batter.  VERY tastey recipe!!!

These muffins were delicious. I took the advice of the other reviewer and added some cinnamon,some pumkin spice,pure vanilla extract and some slightly crushed pecans. The only thing I did differently was add Half the butter asked with corn oil,and used all-pupose whole wheat flour. which made them more moist. They tasted great.

These are fantastic muffins.  I also add 1 tsp vanilla.  I always make them in mini muffin tins and it makes about 36 mini muffins.  My 3 year old will eat 3 or 4 of them in one sitting.  This is the only banana muffin recipe I ever use.  I like to use the Robin Hood Nutrigrain flour instead of regular white flour.

excellent recipe. i made a few adjustments to make these vegan friendly and way less fattening. instead of egg and butter, i just substituted 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce. i also halved the white sugar to 1/2 cup, and also did about 1/4 cup of brown sugar. i used 2 jumbo over-ripened bananas with 1/4 cup of soymilk, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1 tsp of nutmeg. baked for 10 minutes, took them out half done and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the tops, then back in for 8 more minutes. they turned out amazing! very moist, fluffy, sweet, and not too fattening.

These are pretty tasty, and I only had 2 bananas! They were not quite as moist as I was hoping, but that could be because I was one banana short. They got 4 stars because I only baked them for 20 min, and they were still almost too brown. So watch them carefully, and start checking them at 15 min.

These are SO good!  Very moist.  I used 2/3c dark brown sugar instead of 3/4c white sugar, and I added 1tsp cinnamon + 1/2tsp nutmeg.  I wish I had bought more bananas today to ripen for another batch next weekend!

These tasted good but next time I'll have to make them as stated. I made healthy muffins by substituting all the sugar and butter with applesauce. Also, I added walnuts and pecans because I love banana nut muffins! *UPDATE* Finally got around to making these as is with walnuts and they are great. Moist and definitely a keeper.

These are great! Extremely easy to make. I just made them to take to my grandfather who loves freshly baked goods. Not too sweet, either.  I used my mini muffin tins which cuts the cooking time down considerably.  It makes 48 mini muffins which is perfect for sending a special snack to school for the kids!  My daughters are eating them right up as I type.  I followed other users and added cinnamon and vanilla for extra flavour.  Folding the wet ingredients just enough with the dry ingredients is perfect.  The batter is thick and easy to fill the muffin tins with!   These would be fabulous with a small amount of chocolate chips in them!!

I found this recipe to be very dry.  The muffins were small and hard--not one I will repeat.

Thank you! These are great muffins. I took the kind advise of others to mix minimally. They were not too dry. I like to cut back on sugar so I used 1/2 a cup instead of 3/4 cups. They still tasted perfectly sweet so don't be afraid to reduce the sugar. Great warmed up again with a little honey or butter.

This recipe was pretty fantastic! I DID change and add a few things, following advice from other reviewers or just because I wanted to. I used only 1/2 cup sugar, substituted oil for the butter, added 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg, a packet of vanilla sugar (I'm in Europe and haven't found vanilla extract yet) and a little bit of milk just because my batter seemed dry. They turned out great! Very moist and still a little sweeter than I expected (bananas are already sweet), but that's fine. It's definitely a keeper!.....Second time around I used only 1/2 cup sugar and substituted oil for the butter, added a dash of nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon. Made 12, baked for abt 17 mins to a golden brown. Hot and fresh they are GREAT! Moist and cakey like I like it, with a great banana flavor!

Been using this recipe for years and thoroughly enjoy it.  I usually add 1 cup of semi-sweet morsels to it as well and it serves up great hot or cold.  Also, when I mash the bananas I leave some chunks in for added flavor.  Great muffins!

This is a good base recipe.  It definately needed some additions, though.  I add 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 c chopped walnuts, and (sometimes) 1/4 c banana nut granola.  I bake 12 muffins (filled cups to the top) for 20 mins at 350 and they come out perfect with golden tops! My whole family loves them.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had some very ripe bananas and needed to use them up with a quick recipe so i decided to make this for my 11 month old.  She was not impressed but my husband and i loved them!!  i only had 2 bananas but made the recipe anyway, just baked for 20 min instead of 30.

I made these for my coworkers and they were very upset that I didn't bring more!  Even my friend who hates bananas ate two!  They were inhaled in only a few minutes. I used bananas that hadn't ripened too much (you could still eat them) and they turned out beautifully.  My favorite muffin recipe!

The absolute best muffins that I have ever made.  I am a terrible baker and this turned out wonderfully.  I tripled the recipe for my daughter's class.  I did not have butter, so I substituted 3 (4 oz) containers of banana flavored applesauce.  Gently mixed the batter and placed in the fridge overnight. Baked the next morning and the muffins were perfect. I also added a bit of vanilla and sprinkle of cinnamon to the batter.

Filled a 12 muffin pan, cooked 18 minutes, cooked perfect.  Made as posted and they do need a little something added.  They are quite good though.  I like to review as posted and not concern others with my "tweeking".  Every recipe on this site needs "tweeking" to people's personal tastes.

Perfect! I made these last night and they turned out perfectly!! Simple, easy, and fast to make. The only thing I did a little different was use only brown sugar since I didn't have any white, added vanilla extract, and a 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I will make these again even without the chocolate chips. :-)

Super easy to make and they turned out great.  My oven cooks hot so I used 325 and 20 min to cook.  I also wanted to use up the bananas that I had so I actually put in 4 large banana.  Also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top.

These are really, really good! I added a couple of tablespoons of applesauce as well as a teaspoon of sugar and vanilla. They're moist and flavorful, but could've used just a bit more sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

Made it as directed, without tweaking.  I give it a solid "eh"-- it's a good recipe, but not as good as others.  It will be interesting to see how the flavor changes over time-- they are just out of the oven.  They might improve overnight.  But yes, they are easy, moist and cute.  ............. Update:  The next evening, my husband told me the muffins were the best I'd ever made and that my advanced stage of pregnancy must be throwing off my taste buds.  So, there you go.  Your mileage may vary.  I'm updating review to four stars to reflect the split decision...

These are quite tasty! I only had 2 bananas so I tweaked the amount of ingredients as follows:1 cup flour 3/4 teaspoon baking powder and soda, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 2  bananas, 1 egg, 1/2 cup sugar and 3 tablespoons butter. They turned out light and fluffy.  I also did not mash the bananas as much to leave chunks in the muffins.  I will be making these again! Thanks!!

OMG I made 20 mini's and the kids ate them all up. 
I changed it after reading the other reviews with 
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract 
My husband makes it a point now to pick up banana's when he's at the supermarket.
great recipe

I LOVE bananas and can't usually eat the banana bread I love so much because of the calories. This is wonderful! I as well added cinnamon and vanilla and these are wonderful and moist! I have an older oven that cooks a little hot but I cooked "8" servings which ended up being 7 crowned muffins for 20 minutes at 350. I will definitely make these again and again.

Excellent!  I added vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg as other reviewers suggested as well as a topping of brown sugar, crushed wallnuts and butter for extra flavor.  This recipe should be a staple for morning muffins.  Thanks Abi!

Excellent!!! I made this today and it's already a hit with my husband & son. This is an easy recipe to follow - coming from somebody who's still learning how to cook & bake. Two thumbs up!!!

I just made these muffins a few minutes ago. I am eating them now fresh out the oven =) They turned out wonderfully! I added some cinnamon, and also used 100g white sugar:50g brown sugar instead of using all white sugar! YUMMY!

Wonderful! Turns out well everytime! Like everyone else, I separated the wet & dry ingredients. I added a cup of chopped pecans to the mix and garnished (some on top before baking) to look pretty. I also put a dash of cinnamon, vanilla extract, and nutmeg. I used mini muffin pans and filled 2/3 of it. I also watched the baking time carefully as it varies from each oven. It yielded half of what the recipe says it would (~24 instead of 48).

Yum yum yum! This was such a good recipe to make together with my almost 4 year old daughter.  They turned out perfectly and everyone loved them.  It was the perfect level of sweetness for me, but if you like sweet muffins, feel free to add more sugar.

Really tasty! I made large muffins and added in some pumpkin spice (we were out of cinnamon), a bit of lemon zest, and some blueberries. A bit of a weird mixture, but frankly these are delicious and moist, plus really easy to make!

Moist and Delicious!!  These muffins are the best I've had.  I followed the recipe exactly and then took the suggestion of others and added vanilla, cinnamon and chocolate chips.  Made them in a jumbo muffin pan so I got six out of the recipe.  Definately making these a staple in my home!

Okay but not as dense as I would like. I will add 1/2 cub of oats, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and some spices next time. Also the cook time is too long, 20 minutes for large muffins should be plenty.

We loved them.  We used black bananas so it was super sweet.  I made a few changes.  I don't have white flour so I separated it into 3 parts.  1/2 cup of Soy flour, wheat flour and ground rolled oats to equal the 1 1/2 cups of flour.  I also added a little pumkin spice and a tsp vanilla.  Yummy.

This had a very wholesome, full flavor. The bananas made it look a bit unattractive, but I'm sure that could be remedied with a crumble-top of sugar and butter. I made them vegan but using corn starch as a substitute. My family loved it, and it was healthy enough for my grandma and dad to eat.

Absolutely delicious!!!! And I don't even like banana muffins and made these only for my daughter and husband! I went with 1/2 of sugar and sprinkled oats, cinnamon and sugar on top before baking. Baked 12 large muffins for 27 minutes to perfection!

These are the moistest muffins I've made so far. I was worried that something might have gone wrong because the bananas I used were not especially ripe, not to mention that I mashed them with a spatula. 

I mixed a few dashes of cinnamon and sprinkled some more on top when they were in pans. I didn't have nutmeg and I had been too absentminded to add vanilla.

They still turned out great!

Next time, I would cut back slightly on the sugar and try out vailla and nutmeg.

After a few "enhancements" these are the perfect, healthy & kid-friendly muffins!
Use half whole wheat, half white flour. Cut down sugar to 1/2 cup. Omit butter, substitute applesauce, add 1/2 cup ground flax seed. Like other folks, I added cinnamon & vanilla. Sprinkle with diced, toasted pecans & lightly sprinkle with cinnamon & sugar before baking.  Easy, quick & delicious! Our family's favorite muffin recipe!

These muffins were great!!  I added chocolate chips cause it's chocolate and it makes them so much better.  Plus I added one more banana and cut the sugar in half.  Very tasty, everyone loves them.

My four year old helped me make these with great success (the help and the results).  I followed the advice of previous reviewers and added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  I used two ripe bananas and one not-so ripe banana (that's all I had) but it turned out well because the less ripe banana left small little pockets of banana in the baked muffin.  For us, this was exactly enough for 24 mini muffins; the baking time (with a completely preheated oven) was closer to 20 minutes. Perfect - I couldn't stop eating them!

To make this a little healthier, I changed the recipe slightly. It comes out PERFECTLY and I'm still amazed at how good they taste. Instead of 3 bananas, I use 4 large bananas. I use only half of the butter that the recipe calls for (still melted) and also add 1/2 cup applesauce. I use 1/4 C. Splenda and 1/2 C. sugar, add 1 t. cinnamon, 1 t. nutmeg, 1 t. vanilla. I use the very large silicon muffin cups and bake at 35 for exactly half an hour. They turn out perfectly every time

A great way to use up old bananas. Like other reviewers I added some vanilla and a bit of cinnamon. I also halve the butter and make up the rest with applesauce.

These were so good. Nice and moist and flavorful. I added spices and frosted them because I served them to the kids for dessert. These would be excellent brunch muffins minus the frosting I added. I think nuts would be really good too. Love recipes that help you use up your bananas that are getting sort of old. Thanks for the great addition to my recipe collection.

These muffins are great! I was looking for a recipe to use up a few bananas that were a little more ripe than we all like to eat here in the house. This was extremely easy & with ingredients that I already had. Like many other reviewers, I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla, 1 tsp. of cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg to the mix. They were moist, delicious & flavorful. Thank you!

I didn't think these were that great. No one complained about them, but no one raved about them either. I did add vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon but I still found them to be a bit bland.

Wonderful! I've been making these like crazy. I substituted the AP flour for organic spelt flour, used organic bananas, and honey instead of sugar. I also added about a cup of bran cereal (I made it soggy with hot milk). Five stars for sure!

This recipe made 12 full, light, and delicious banana muffins that my family couldn't get enough of. I tweaked the recipe a bit by using self rising flour (instead of all purpose, baking soda, baking powder, salt) and added 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. I also used 1 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup. Absolutely delicious!

Very easy and I substituted unsweetened applesauce and eggbeaters for butter & eggs.  Came out very nice but I should have stayed away from paper liners & used the spray.  Yummy - hubby loved 'em.

These were just ok to me. I added 1tsp of vanilla and still tasted like it needed more banana. I didn't use any butter at all just used 1/4 cup apple sauce. The texture is good. and they turned out nice looking and even smelled really good. Probably won't make these again.

I liked this recipe very much, as did my 5 year old son. I've made these twice. The first time I found them to be a little bland, so the second time I added some vanilla extract and cinnamon and they turned out perfectly! Next time I am going to replace the melted butter with apple sauce to try a lower fat version and I can't wait! This is a banana muffin recipe which I will definitely be using again.

These muffins were wonderful! I followed the exact recipe.
My husband and I really like banana bread but after eating some after it's baked, we're done with it. 
The muffins were gone in the first hour.

Added cinnamon, vanilla, chopped walnuts, and semi-sweet chocolate chips and the mini-muffin variety turned out terrific & moist, not spongy or dry whatsoever!  Definitely will be the recipe I use from now on!

These muffins turned out pretty good. I followed the exact recipe. The only thing i added was vanilla and cinnamon. The muffins came out a bit to done, so next time I will probably only cook them for 20 minutes instead of 25.

Great taste.  I added the vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg as suggested.  I replaced a half cup of flour with a half cup of old fashioned oatmeal.  My muffins rose to the top of my pans and flattened out.  I'm sure its due to living in a high altitude and I'm not accustomed to this type of baking.

This was the best banana muffin recipe I've ever tried, it  was super delicious!  I added the tsp of vanilla, and cinnamon and nutmeg, and also I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top of half of them, and sprinkled a few chocolate chips on the other half, they were both very yummy toppings, and the muffins were so moist and tasty, I will make it again for sure!!!

EXCELLENT! Great flavor! I added about 1/2 teas cinnamon to the batter and then sprinkled generously with cinnamon and sugar just before baking.  It makes a nice crust on top.  Super moist and delicious!

EXCELLENT MUFFINS!! Will definitely be making these again.  I agree with the others.. its a must to add cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla.  Also, I will be using applesauce instead of butter next time, per other's suggestions.

Yummy and easy.
I added cinnamon. I used 1.5 cups of (frozen) mashed bananas, 1/2 cup of applesauce, and a little less butter.

I made this recipe exactly with the exception of adding 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon. The taste was okay but they looked like the picture does. Not fluffy like I thought they would be. Texture a bit weird. Maybe it was the amount of banana? My kids wouldn't eat them and my kids love broccoli. Go figure. The smell in my house is great but other than that this is a goner for us.

All I can say is YUM! My kids love these.  I added mini-chocolate chips and made mini muffins...I left one pan in the oven too long and they were still delicious.  I will definitely make again.

Yummy!  I also added some cinnamon, nutmeg (but I forgot the vanilla - gah!). The muffins were delicious and very moist inside.  I'll definitely make them again since they're so easy to whip up.

I make these muffins all the time. I wait until the banana peels are mostly brown, so I know the bananas will be mushy and sweet. I usually use just under 1/2 cup of sugar. Otherwise, I do everything the same. Simple, yummy, portable food. Everyone loves these!

These are terrific. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon to it. The smell is wonderful, my 3 year old loves them and asks for them every morning. I am very happy with this recipe I have made it twice now with great results both times. I will make again.

WOW!  These muffins are wonderful.  I just took them out of the oven.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I added vanilla and cinnamom.  I also added pecans to half the batch.  Thanks for the recipe.

GREAT RECIPE! the muffins were the perfect balance of dense, fluffy, and moist. i only had two bananas on hand but they still turned out wonderfully. i mashed up the bananas pretty well, but found that i liked to have some larger chunks of banana in there. i also substituted a few tablespoons of buttermilk for some of the butter.

I just made these for the first time (to use up some old bananas) and it is great!  Unlike others, I changed nothing (since it was the first time making them I decided to follow the recipe exactly) and I don't feel the need to change it or add anything.  I'm sure they would be tasty with vanilla or cinnamon, but I'm very happy with them exactly as they are!

Yum!

This is the best banana muffin recipe I have ever made. I made a double batch of this recipe so that we would have enough for snacks later. The only things I did different was use white wheat flour and whole wheat pastry flour, half margarine and half butter and added a little vanilla.These were absolutely fabulous!!! Not one complaint in my picky bunch.

I was gifted some homemade apple butter that I wanted to use, so I only used 2 bananas and added 1/3 cup of apple butter.  Like other readers, I also added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  These were SO good and SO incredibly easy.  I will definitely make again, and try other variations!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I added the cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg as recommended by other reviewers.  I also added chopped walnuts and chocolate chips.  While I suppose the rating I'm giving this recipe isn't authentic since the recipe has changed rather dramatically, the basic ingredients did a great job and offer good flexibility.  The muffins were dense, flavorful, and moist.  I will definitely make these again.

This was hard for me to rate because I altered the recipe so much to make it healthy, but I will share what I did. 1) I added the 1 tsp cinnamon, 1\4 tsp nutmeg, and 1 tsp vanilla suggested by other reviewers 2) I used all whole wheat flour 3) I used unsweetened applesauce instead of butter. That said, they turned out to be a decent healthy treat. I made a dozen, and they came out to 2 Weight Watchers points each: 126 calories,

this is a very flavorful recipe for banana muffin. it is very soft and moist. also, the sweetness is PERFECT ! i did not alter the amount of the ingredients however i added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of cinnamon. the ideal pair for this would be a cup of tea on a winter, sunday morning ---- WONDERFUL :)

This recipe turned out great.  I used 1/2 cup of oats in place of 1/2 cup of the flour.  I crushed them a little with my hands before adding.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 instead of 3/4 cup.  They were definitely sweet enough.  I will save this recipe and make them again.

a little oily, but other than that, great recipe and true to baking time.  i added vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg like others, and you can definitely taste the nutmeg.

Really easy and very tasty. I added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to enhance the flavor, and tossed in a handful of chopped pecans. Will definitely make this again.

Awesome recipe!!  A huge hit at my house!  I made these about 3 weeks ago and my two toddlers and my hubby at most of them.  I only got one or two!  Next time I'll double the recipe so I'm sure to get more than a couple!  Thanks, for a terrific recipe!

Very good! I added chopped Walnuts to the recipe but otherwise followed exact. I found I had to cook them longer than suggested by about 7 minutes. I used muffin tin with paper wrappers. They are super moist and delish!

I used to use another recipe on here for the use of my old bananas.  Of course, when my bananas we in the need to be used, I was out of brown sugar, which led me to look for another recipe.  That is when I stummbled on this one.  Instead of muffins I baked it in a bundt pan for 30 minutes, and used margerine instead of butter (I was out of that too).  It turned out great; my new favorite recipe!!

I followed the recipe and used mini-muffin tins, and the muffins turned out completely uncooked and mushy, even when I upped the temperature and added ten minutes onto the baking time. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.

These are easy to make.  I doubled the recipe with no problem.  You could add walnuts to the batter or to the topping, but it doesn't need them.  I took them to work and everyone loved them.

I made these for the staff last night at work. I added 1 cup of toasted walnuts and made it with one cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour instead. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. A very good base recipe. Next time I might add one more banana - or maybe riper fruit. It didn't have quite as much banana flavour as I would have liked but that could have been my nanas. Still, very good, well recieved (gone!) and I will make them again.

I substituted the butter with applesauce and used half sugar and half splend. I still thought they were pretty good. The recipe makes 12 small muffins. Next time will probably only make 8. Make sure bananas are very ripe for best favor. I also added cinnamon and vanilla. Very good overall.

Fast and easy. Nice and Moist. I did add a sprinkle of cinnamon, a teaspoon of vanilla and I threw in about a 1/2 cup of the mini chocolate chips. I also replaced 1/2 cup of the flour for whole wheat flour. They made 24 mini muffins. I think the sugar could easily be cut in half and they would still be plenty sweet.

My family loved this recipe.  I did double it, but only added 1 cup sugar.  I also added 1/3c mini semi sweet chocolate chips. I also added 2/3c oatmeal to half of the batter. It is very delicious and my 10 yr old loves it, and he hates bananas.  My 5 yr old well hates most things that arent meat.  You will not be disappointed they are awesome.

Extremely good muffins! I had a craving for chocolate chip banana muffins, but none of the recipes specifically for that were grabbing me. This one looked good though, so I decided to try it. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, and used half whole wheat flour and half white flour, but otherwise made the recipe as stated. (With the addition of miniature chocolate chips, as implied earlier.) The muffins turned out really well - nice and fluffy with a great flavor. I will definitely be keeping this recipe around to use again!

Awesome recipe! I added the 1 tsp vanilla, cinnamon, allspice & 1/4 tsp nutmeg! They were gone before they were cool! I buy the brown- almost too ripe for only $.15 a lb and bake plenty using this recipe then freeze them. (If I can ever get them cooled again!)

My muffins always have a tendency to be heavy or dry, but this recipe is 
definitely a keeper! These are the lightest fluffiest muffins i've ever had.  Kids are dying to try them with chocolate chips.

Wow!  This is the best recipe for banana muffins I've found.  I halved the recipe and cut down the fat by using low fat margarine and an egg white.  Also added a handful of sunflower seeds and oats to the batter then sprinkled wheat germ and raw sugar on top!  They all disappeared before supper!

I liked this recipe. It was super easy!  I added about 6 diced strawberries which made the muffins very moist. Next time I will put in less sugar since I found them to be a little on the sweet side. Good way to get rid of your brown bananas!

These muffins and quick, easy and amazing! I actually decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup and replace half the flour with quick cooking oats. Add a tsp of vanilla, 1/2 chocolate chips and they are moist, healthy and gone in no time. My super picky 3 year old will eat two at a time and is always checking out the bananas to see if they are ripe enough to make muffins. Have shared this recipe with many friends who love them as well.

I was really surprised by how easy these were... You could mix them up in no time.  I agree with some of the other readers that I didn't get very many muffins from the batter.  So, if you want more than 12 or 14, double up your batch.  Very yummy, though!

Made these with the help of my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter. Wemade mini muffins and had a ball. She could hardly wait unti they were done to try them. Really good flavor and very moist. May add some cinnamon or nutmeg next time along with a few nuts, but this one is a keeper!

I lost my grandma's recipe a couple of years back and have been searching ever since for a good banana muffin recipe.  This one comes the closest yet!  I did add a half teaspoon each of nutmeg and cinnamon, but did not change anything else!  All 4 sons and hubby loved them.

The only thing I did differently was that with half the batch I added chocolate chips, and the other half I made with pecans (family member has a nut allergy). Both turned out AMAZING. Beyond amazing.

I made these muffins today and they were fantastic!  I did take another member's suggestion and did not beat the batter, just mixed it until it was all moist.  I also added some macadamia nuts for a little bit of crunch.  Delicious!

Good simple recipe.  My favorite is still the brown sugar banana bread, but this is great.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla, substituted applesauce for the butter and 1/2 cup packed brown sugar for the sugar called for.  They are great and a little bit healthy!

It's a bit too sweet even used 1/2c white sugar and 1/4c brown sugar.  Maybe next time will cut it down to 1/4c white and 1/4c brown.  Used 4 bananas too. Also added 1/2c chopped walnuts.  My 4 year old likes it.

These were very yummy and moist!  I doubled the recipe and made just a few slight changes...substituted olive oil for the butter, put in half evaporated cane juice half honey, instead of sugar and used half white, half whole wheat flour.  Thanks!  What a great way to use up those over-ripe bananas!

Amazing!  I added 1/4c chocolate chips and 1/4c flax seed and it was so moist.  I also added an extra banana.  I will make these again and again.  They lasted about a day and there are only 2 of us!

We LOVE this!!  I add vanilla and cinnamon and an extra banana. (I'm a dash of this pinch of that baker so I'm not sure how much I add....sorry)  I also use half spelt flour which absorbs more liquid so I tend to add a touch of water.  My husband swears these are the best he's ever had.  He says with chocolate chips added there is no treat he'd rather have!!

I made the mini muffin version.  I took some other reviewers advice and added the vanilla and the cinnamon.  They are yummy!

Being a college student and not having the array of cooking ingredients, these were really simple and pretty tasty.  I added butterscotch chips to mine, which complemented the banana well. mm!

This is a very easy recipe. I used 4 large bananas, added a bit of vanilla, cinnamon, chocolate chips and a pinch of nutmeg. Everyone loved them. They didn't have time to cool before they were all gone. I will make these again.

We liked these muffins. I used Splenda instead of the sugar, added 1 capful of vanilla and about a tsp or so of cinnamon.  Also added some slivered almonds.  Mine cooked in 20 minutes and I got 11 nice size muffins.  Will make again--probably tomorrow--got to get rid of those bananas.  I would imagine the muffins will freeze well.

These muffins were good but not the best. I used unsweetened applesauce in place of the butter.  My parents loved them but for some reason I felt it was lacking the umpf to be rated the best.

Great muffins!  Used a few quite overripe muffins and they turned out great.  Ended up making about 10 large-ish muffins, but  the bananas were probably a bit smaller than expected.

These were good mine were a little dry but I checked them in 20 min and they were completely done so watch yours. I made 12 large muffins adding vanilla cinnamin to the batter may add more flavor. All and all this was a great low cal low fat muffin.

I made 6 regular muffins and 24 mini muffins with this.  My children did most of the mixing and thought they had really done something!  I would like to try it again with vanilla and cinnamon like others have suggested.  They are great, but I think those additions would make them a 5 star recipe.

Great basic banana muffin recipe!  I scaled down the recipe to one banana, as it was turning black in my kitchen-that means it was turning into a prime baking banana!  Because it called for 1/3 of an egg, I just used some leftover yolks, and it still came out delicious. If you use them, definitely use the liners that are paper/foil.  The muffins slid right out of the wrapping! (I've had some trouble with paper wrappers before.)

There was nothing too special about these muffins. They came out a little dry, but the flavor was pretty good. I would add some cinnamon and nutmeg to it to create more flavor. It was pretty good. You could substite half the fat for applesauce because that worked the second time I made these. I may be making these again using more banana and subbing oil for sour cream. (or at least some of it).

Another 5 star review! I used the new white whole wheat flour- worked great! They slightly over-filled my cute little Bundt muffin/cupcake pan, so next time I won't fill quite so full & make a few minis as well. So easy & delicious with my perfectly ripened bananas! Thank you!

Very good and easy to make.  I usually have all the ingredients on hand, so whenever I have some over-ripe bananas on hand, I'll make a batch and freeze them.  I also printed off the recipe for Banana Muffins I, but I liked these so much, I'm afraid to try a different recipe!

Yummy and easy to make. I did use lo-fat sour cream in place of the butter. This is terrific basic recipe that you can tweak any way you like. Very easy to make and the whole family practically ate all of them. I bake at 325 degrees because I used mini muffin tins. I used 1/2 c. whole wheat flour and 1 c. white flour. I also added: 2 tblsps. flax seed - flax seed is really healthy for you and my family doesn't even notice; 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 c. nuts. Thank you for the recipe - I've added it to my recipe box!

It was so easy and yummy. I reduced sugar and added some sliced almonds for the balance. Just good for tea-time snack.

I made these last week in mini muffin form and brought them into work. Absolutely amazing. A big hit! I also added some mini chocolate chips to the mix, and everyone loved them. I used fat-free sour cream, and the muffins came out so moist. Yogurt also works well too!

I have made these several times with my kids--they love making them and the recipe is so easy! (If you do it yourself you can make them in five minutes; with small kids, about 30!)  They are very sweet so I usually cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and use whole wheat pastry flour, which I think works very nicely.

A simple and delicious banana recipe.  I decreased the amount of sugar to a 1/2 cup and added 2 ounces of dark chocolate chunks.  Also, I added an additional banana cut into cubes to the batter mixture.

These were really good! I usually add vanilla, but they were great even without it! I did add a few bittersweet chocolate chips from Ghirardelli, which was GREAT, but even the ones without them were really good! Do remember to beat it BEFORE you add the flour mixture and only stir gently after.

I did add 1/2 t cinammon and 1/2 t vanilla + 2 T applesauce and a few chocolate chips. These were great.  I made them early in the morning and took them to work.  My co-workers will usually only eat cookies but they made an exception for these muffins.

Deliciously light and moist and super easy to make.  I used 2.5 bananas, 2 tbsp applesauce, egg substitute, and subbed 1/4 c white sugar for brown and some wheat for white.  Turned out amazing with 1/2 c choc chips.  Yum!

These were great!  I made a few modifications and used some suggestions from others.  For example:

I used 4 large bananas, mashed 
I used Splenda instead of sugar (about 1/4 cup as we don't like sweet things but they were just the right sweetness)
I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla

Instead of the butter I used a mixture of unsweetened applesauce (lunch box size) and mayo (an old trick a farmer's wife taught me, I do this with cakes too).

I added chopped pecans and golden raisins.  Oh drool ... these were sooooo moist and tender, not at all oily, probably because of the Hellmann's Mayo & applesauce.

I also sprinkled pecan pieces on top of the muffins before baking.  They were gone before I could make the cream cheese icing.  Oh well, next time I'll make the cream cheese icing ... I do intend to make this recipe again, thanks for sharing.

Everyone was right - these are fantastic.  So good, Hubby and I ate half of them right out of the oven (oops).  Based on other reviewers' suggestions, I added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and an extra banana.  I also substitued Splenda for half of the sugar and sprinkled the tops with cinnamon-sugar.  Perfect fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth texture.  I won't even bother trying other recipes in the future - I don't think banana muffins get any better than this!

I made these with 1/2 cup of splenda in place of sugar, unsweetened applesauce instead of butter, and added 1 tsp. vanilla and cinnamon, and a few sprinkles of nutmeg. Next time I'll use 4 bananas. Very good especially right out of the oven!

I love banana bread and muffins. This recipe tastes moist and delicious. The reason why i am not giving 5 stars is bcoz I had these tiny black strands (I think it is from the bananas) all over the muffins. So it dint "look" that good. Also, My husband felt that there is too much banana flavor; but iam ok with this recipe. Its the personal preference that matters.

Good muffin recipe.  I used quite a few of the suggestions and loved them.  I used a mixture of whole wheat and white flour, 4 bananas, vanilla and cinnamon.  I also sprinkled a bit of cinnamon sugar on the top before baking and it gave a sweet little topping.  I have forgotten the sprinkle and thought it was much better with it.  My husband and 3 year old love these muffins.  My daughter helps by mashing the bananas.

I'm not sure if these would be healthy as advertised with white flour, white sugar and butter.  That being said, they are probably the tastiest banana muffins I've made. A double batch with mini chocolate chips disappeared in record time.

This is my kid's favorite recipe.  If I ask them if they want muffins, they assume it is these.  Although, at our house they are Chocolate Chip banana muffins; I add 1/2 to 3/4 c. of mini chocolate chips then I bake them in mini muffin pans.  They don't last long.  Thanks for a great recipe.

One of the best banana muffins I've ever eaten.  I added the cinnimon and vanilla then made a glaze from canned cream cheese frosting and drizzeld over the top.

Great muffins!  My family and friends loved them. I did follow some of the suggestions, and added 1 tsp. cinn. and 1 tsp. vanilla.  I also substituted 1/2 c. whole wheat flour for some of the white flour.  Sprinkled with a cinnamon/sugar mixture before baking.  Will be making these again soon!

These are fantastic! I didn't substitute anything, only added cinnamon. They turned out moist and I love that they are not super sweet. I passed them out at work today and got great feedback - thanks, Abi!

Yum!  Lends itself well to healthy alterations.  I used 4 oz applesauce instead of butter, 1/2 cup Splenda instead of sugar, added 1 tsp vanilla extract & 1 tsp cinammon, plus a sprinkle or two of nutmeg.  Reduced oven temp to 325 F  as Splenda tends to make baked goods brown faster & baked for 25 minutes.  Very moist & tasty!

AMAZING! These taste just like moist, delicious mini banana breads! The outside has the perfect texture. I followed the recipe exactly, but added a dash of cinnamon. I loved it! I will definitely make this again and again! 

thanks for the great recipe

Very Easy recipe and soooo good! I added the vanilla and cinnamon as someone suggested. I also added choco chips and next time I will try nuts. I also baked in a stone muffin pan from pampered chef. They baked great and came out of the pan so easy.

Mmmm, these were so good! You will want to take other reviewer suggestions and use four average size bananas or 3 very large ones.  The banana taste was a bit more subtle than my family's preference but the muffins were still delightful.  A great recipe.

They were delicious when I followed the recipe exactly.  I also experimented on one batch by adding vanilla, cinnamon, and walnuts and they were amazing.  I made a batch with splenda, which were very good. And my favorite batch,  I made with vanilla, cinnamon, raisens, coconut, walnuts, and a struessel topping.  I made 5 dozen (my banana tree just fruited) and they were gone in under an hour.  People at work couldn't eat just one and everyone raved about them!

Great recipe!  The muffins were very good, not too dense, but not too fluffy, I think just the right texture.  I added some pecan crumbs and some cinnamon and it tastes just awesome!  I highly recommend this recipe.  I also made 10 instead of 12, since I like bigger muffins.

This is a great recipe!!!  I made it into a cake because I didn't have a muffin pan and they were excellent.  I did use spenda instead of sugar and 
1/3 cup milk to make it moist.  I made these for church and EVERYONE loved it.

These are really good but I certainly wouldn't call them "healthy" - white flour, white sugar, etc. - the only healthy thing is the banana!

This is what I did to make them healthier:
-replace white flour with whole wheat pastry flour
-replace white sugar with Sucanat-this is a less refined sugar and I think has a much better taste-when I cook with it I let it "sit" a bit in the wet ingredients, so it will dissolve a little better
-3 Tablespoons ground flax seed
-1/2 of a vanilla bean

Now they are healthier, and still very good.

It seemed too simple to be so tasty. I added raisins and some chocolate chips because I did not have any nuts to add. I also exchanged butter for I Can't Believe its Not Butter, and they came out awesome. My man has never liked my muffins before now.

Great recipie!  I was looking for a banana muffin recipie that called for more than 1 banana and came across this one.  I had some extra chocolate chips and walnuts that I added to it and the muffins disappeared!  I am not a banana fan, but even "I" liked these.  Thanks!

Yum! Yum! Yum!  I just made these this morning.  They were fast, easy and are really good.  They do taste like banana bread.  I made a dozen minis for the kids and 7 large for us.  I added vanilla because it seemed like that was the consensus in the reviews.  You have to try these.  Yum!

This is a great recipe. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla as others suggested and I used margerine instead of butter because it is what I had on hand. The muffins came out very moist and flavorfull. The family finished them off in only 1 day. Next time I'll make a double batch.

Great muffins!!! I added chocolate chips because I love that combination, but kept a couple muffins without chocolate - they were excellent just by themselves. They seem to freeze well if you want to make a bigger batch (like I did). Wonderful.

Less cooking time than banana bread but tastes almost the same. Would be good with chocolate chips and/or chopped walnuts.

I don't know what all the fuss is about. I thought these were mediocre at best. Too sweet for me (and I'm a sugar addict!) They didn't hold together well as I removed them from the pan. Next time will try the lighter banana muffin recipe at this site.

These muffins are great and so easy to make. My 10 month old couldn't get enough of them. I like that they aren't to sugary. This is a plus for young kids. I too added a little oatmeal in place of the flour.

Excellent recipe. I added the cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg the others suggested. I also added walnuts. My 8 year old, who doesn't like anything and is very picky, tried them and then ate 5 by herself throughout the day!

This is a great recipe!  I was short a banana (I only had 2).  The only change I made was I substituted approx 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter for the 3rd banana.  It turned out GREAT!  The hint of peanut butter taste complimented the overall tast.  Very moist muffins.  A big hit!

I doubled the recipe and made some modifications.  I used half flour and half oatmeal.  I added 1 cup of raisins.  These are great morning muffins for the kids to take to school when they get those mid-morning growlies!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

These muffins are delicious!  I made some changes though. Added some cinnamon and instead of a whole egg, I added 2 egg whites.  I also used 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar.  Used a little less than 1/3 c. butter and added some semisweet choc. chips to half of the batter.  They turned out fantastic!  Not too sweet or heavy and incredibly easy to make.

these were really good. I ran out of butter so I used shortening instead. I wasn't too sure how they'd turn out but they were really good. Will definitely make again, next time I'm going to try and add walnuts.

I was looking for a quick and easy muffin recipe to use up some bananas.  After reading the reviews on this recipe, I thought I'd give it a go.  Absolutely fantastic!  I didn't alter a thing and the muffins turned out really moist and light.  In fact as soon as they came out of the oven, I made some custard and broke a couple of them in there.  My husband thought they were magic!

It's sooo yumm, I reduced the sugar to 2/4 C coz' it's too sweet for my ripened bananas. Plus I added semisweet mini choco chips to make chocolate chips banana muffin. YumM. My family and people at church loved it and asked for the recipe.

Trying to healthify the recipe so used ww flour, mostly applesauce with a small amount of olive oil for the butter, brown sugar, added teh vanilla and cinnamon, doubled the recipe...and then topped it with leftover struesel I had leftover from a coffee cake I'd made.  So much for healthy, huh?  Didn't add the nuts, which I'm sure would be wonderful, just because of my nut-hating family.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks.

I was looking for healthy snacks to make for my son's preschool class.  These are moist and delicious!!! To make them even more nutritious, I used whole wheat pastry flour.  These will be made again and again....thanks!

ALL 4 KIDS loved them!  Half of them like chocolate chips, so I just placed 4 or 5 of them on top of the mini muffins.  I only have one pan so I used all of the batter and ended up with 24 jumbo minis--FAST and FAB!

These are good, they don't taste really sweet like a lot off muffins.  I also made them with a C. of chocolate chips.  I like them when the chocolate chips for a different flavor.

These were pretty good but not quite moist enough to my liking.  More chewy/dryer than moist.  But they still went fast and are tasty!  I added cinnamon and a tich vanilla too.

These were great!! I added a splash of vanilla and substituted the Shedd's Spread Cinnamon flavored butter for the plain butter. I also used Self-rising flour and omitted the baking powder, salt, etc. My brother-in-law said they were the best muffins he has ever tasted and DH practically ate the whole panful!

I made these with the help of the children (ages 2 to 3) in the toddler room of the child care center where I work. They were very easy to make and were a hit with the little ones! Moist and delicious.

YUMMY! Everyone enjoyed these muffins, I don't think they were out of the oven 10 minutes and already half are gone.  The only thing I did different was I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top, gave them a little something special. Thank you.

These were great!  Very, very moist.  However, they definitely need nuts, but still taste good without them.

These muffins came out exceptionally well and very moist!  The only change I made was using brown sugar rather than white.  These are by far the best banana muffins I've tasted in a long time!
