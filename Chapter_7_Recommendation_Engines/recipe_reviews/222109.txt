I did not have Rotel (diced tomatoes with green chilies), what I did was use one can petite diced tomatoes and one 4 ounce can diced mild green chilies. I also used my own homemade taco seasoning and I threw in a couple cloves of fresh minced garlic. Very good.

I've had this before. Made it several times and always love it just the same. Question, though. I'm keeping track of the calories I take in. What, technically, is considered a serving? A cup?

I also nix the beer for low-sodium chicken broth and find that it tastes amazing!

Really good. I made into more of a stew. I just used a large can of rinsed black beans for the beans. For the sauce I used jar of Newmans own marinara sauce and can of chicken stock (No beer or diced tomatoes). I skipped the canned chillis. Used four chicken breasts. When I took the chicken out to shred it I added a 1/4 cup cornstarch and 1/4 cup water (mixed together in a small bowl first)to the sauce. Stirred in the chicken tasted the sauce and added more taco seasonings. I also added a tbsp of brown sugar.

I make this all the time, and it always turns out well.  You can also make a few additions to kick up a notch: I sometimes add 2-3 zucchini and a green pepper for extra vegetables and I sometimes kick it up a notch with some extra cayenne.

Yummy!  I doubled the recipe, used low sodium everything, subbed veggie broth for beer, added sliced black olives, and 3 T minced garlic.  Omitted carrots. Also for chicken, I shredded the white meat of 2 ready-made rotisserie chicken. Could easily go vegan w no chicken.

Wow, I wasn't sure about this, but it turned out delicious!  Made just a couple changes - I hadn't planned on making it this evening, so I cooked it on the stovetop.  I added 1 tbps of minced garlic with the onion and left out the carrot.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  Will definitely be making this again!

Tried this for the 1st time & everyone loved it! Although i did tweek it around a little. I left out the carrot.  Added a can of pinto beans, 1 tbsp of minced garlic, and a package of taco seasoning since i didn't have the seasonings to make homemade. I also used crushed doritos chips  instead of reg. Tortilla chips. DELICIOUS!!

Very tasty.  I didn't have fresh cilantro so used dry.  Also instead of the chili beans (don't care for them), I cut up zucchini, green peppers and carrots to make up the bulk.  Everything else stayed the same.  My family loved.

Amazing!!! I used hot rotel and threw in some jalapeños. Only had to cook for about 4 hours and then shredded the chicken. It’s spicy just the way I like it!

Excellent, and easy to make. I added four breast instead of three, just the right amount of spices. So good, I'm making it again this weekend for lunches the coming  week.

Very good! I did not have beer, so I used chicken broth and it worked great. I also had precooked shredded chicken, so I just dumped it all together and simmered it for about 40 minutes. Delicious!

I've made this at least twice a year for years. It tastes better the next day. I double up the recipe and we have leftovers for a week! I home make the taco seasoning as others suggested, and use Modelo Negra beer. You can switch up what beans you want to include, but always make sure to keep the juices in. Highly recommend!

This is the easiest and most delicious recipe I have made -I make it every other week!  I do not put in the second can of diced tomatoes but substitute it for about a half a cup to a cup of chicken broth so it doesn’t get too thick!!  Everyone loves it -especially my husband who is on a low sodium diet and very very picky!

Easy to make with ingredients I usually have in my pantry and freezer. I love recipes that don't require a special trip to the store!  Not sure the beer added any flavor; chicken broth is probably just as good. I added Tabasco for more kick.

I made this the other day. It was good. I think I would add a little more taco seasoning on the chicken to give it more flavor. I did forget the black beans but it was enough with the chili beans. I used Fritos chili cheese corn chips, shredded cheddar cheese, and sour cream as the toppings. I will make this again.

It's really yummy! If I would change anything it's the carrots...it's just odd in a recipe like this...but it's not too bad. Excited to eat my lunch at work this week. And I love how easy the prep was.

Excellent. Did add more garlic.and had to use chicken legs. They were a pain to debone, but everyone loved it.

Love this recipe! I use my own seasonings and after shredding the chicken I added kale to the soup.

This has become a house favorite for my family! To make it more soupy, I add a can of low sodium chicken broth and my boyfriend loves when I put halved pearl onions in it.  I also will chop up extra toppings for this like radishes, black olives and green onions.   Whenever I go out of town I make sure to pre-prepare a dump bag of this for my boyfriend so he doesn't feed himself hamburgers the entire time I'm gone.  Its a great recipe that is easy to build on and play with!

Great flavor, my only critical comment is that I used large amish chicken breasts and 3 whole breasts was way to much.  It turned out more like a stew than a soup.  I will use smaller breasts next time and note the weight

It's a keeper; super easy and everyone loved the flavor. Reviewed others' edits and went with replacing water with more broth and added a can of black beans. Yummy!

Would make this again as it was quick and enormously tastee.  Have to warn others to use no more than prescribed amount of taco seasoning.    I used a stout beer.  Put tobasco sauce on the table with the cheese and sour cream for participants seasoing to taste.

I would add something for flavor next time. It was good, but not a lot of flavor.
