I used whole wheat flour instead, and I used apples that were peeled sliced and frozen and rhubarb that was frozen. It still turned out amazing!

It was delicious.  I felt like I was back living in the midwest.  We had rhubarb crisp a lot in the summers.

I didn't have any cornstarch but not sure if it would have made a difference. I was good but not as good as I've had.

Definitely will make again!  Added an extra 1/2 rolled oats as I like it to be a little thicker crumble.

Love the taste of the rhubarb mixed with apple, but too sweet.
