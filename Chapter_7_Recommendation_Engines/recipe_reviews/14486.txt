AND I DON'T EVEN EAT MUSHROOMS!

August 20, 2003 from Melissa: I made these Marinated Mushrooms last weekend to take to a niece's college graduation party.  What a hit they were!  I don't care for mushrooms myself, but can always recognize a good recipe when I see one!  

I had at least 8 people make a point of coming up to me to tell me EMPHATICALLY how much they loved the mushrooms.  They would say something like "I love those mushrooms you made" and I'd say "Oh, thanks, glad you like 'em." and they'd say something like "I mean I REALLY like 'em."  It's not that often that people go out of their way to comment TWICE on the same dish!  I'll definitely be making this one a staple of my "party dishes"!

I added just a bit more brown sugar to this marinade because it had a bitter aftertaste. A dash of orange juice could give this marinde an added touch of sweetness.  I thought the presentation was wonderful, with the colors of the red and green pepper.  Next time, though I am going to cut the peppers into long shoestrings to make the jarred presentation more dramtic.  This is the perfect thing to take to a Holiday gathering. They look and smell very inviting.

I had made these for an appetizer at a dinner party. I think they would be better in a salad. Alone they are slightly strong. The marinade would even make a great salad dressing.

I brought them to a dinner party and everyone loved them. I didn't read the other reviews before I made them. You definitely need to add more mushrooms to the recipe. They were very good and easy to make!

They were good, just a little bit too much red wine. (That might've been my fault!)  Use more mushrooms than what recipe calls for, there is a lot of liquid left to do so.

These are absolutely addicting!  I keep these on hand for a light snack.  this is kindof of a go by taste on the red wine and sugar as some red wines can be a bit more bitter and strong than other kinds so I usually go by how the strong the wine is and then adjust the brown sugar accordingly.

This is the best marinated mushroom recipe I have found. I prepare the recipe and let it marinate overnight. It really brings out the wonderful flavors. Will make again and again!

I made this with a few changes. I didn't have enough wine and had no red wine vinegar, so I used balsamic and extra EVO. I also used more garlic, more green onions, and no peppers. I also added some sunflower seeds. It was sooo good!!! Next time I'll mix it with some baby spinach with the extra liquid. Perfect for a cold salad :}

Overall a great recipe.  I agree w/ the other reviews --- there is a lot of leftover marinade, so add more mushrooms.  To mellow out the wine flavor, I used white wine and red wine vinegar and added fresh rosemary. worked beautifully.

This was SO good.  The mushrooms disappeared so fast at the party I took them to.  The best part of this recipe was the leftovers...I used the leftover marinade to marinade some chicken breasts, which lasted for two dinners.  BEST chicken marinade I've had in a long time! :)

My husband liked these a lot better than I did. I thought the vinegar taste was very strong. Might try again with white wine and white wine vinegar. The red seemed 'heavy' for mushrooms.

I was testing these out to use at my wedding.  Both I and a friend of mine were not crazy about them. They have an italian-salsa-ish feel to them, which is just not what I think of when I think marinated mushrooms.  They were certainly eatible, but will not be on my wedding food table!  Oh, and prepare yourself for some horrific breath!! Whew!

my first attempt at marinade mushrooms, and being a huge red wine lover, this recipe was just screaming for me to try it.  Having said that, I ALWAYS read the reviews when i read a recipe that sounds interesting...except of course, this time.  It is cooling on the stove as we speak and i am just now reading all the advice to add more mushrooms, which is absolutely correct, They are still rather hot now, but i dug in anyway and had a taste..they taste lovely!  But again, the strong red wine flavour is right up my alley.  If you are not like me, a borderline wino, then you may want to ease up on the amount of wine you put or do like one member suggested..use white wine with red wine vinegar.

Why spend so much time on a side dish? Put simply, it's worth it. The details make the difference and preparing these mushrooms will make you look like a cooking star. I used the mixture as a garnish for grilled pork chops using the allrecipes rub called Simple Pork Rib Dry Rub. It's as if these mushrooms were made for the grilled chops with this rub. They both bring a lot of heat and the taste explosion is spectacular. Do it!

After reading reviews, I cut the marinade by 1/3. I also cut the amount of red wine. I had no wie vinegar so I used balsamic out of necessity. Simple and tasty and will make again. Thanks for sharing!

I love mushrooms and I did not care for these.  Way too much red wine and red wine vinegar.  I couldn't even taste the mushrooms because the sauce was so pungent.  However, on the bright side, per others' suggestion, I've got some filet marinating in it right now so hopefully it will be a better marinade than an appetizer!

I didn't have red wine, so I substituted Sangria. They are awesome.  I'm not sure that there will be any left when the party starts in an hour.

Good flavor but a little sweet for me. Next time I'll cut back on the brown sugar to see if that helps.

I was disappointed with this recipe after reading the reviews, I looove marinated mushrooms so I was eager to make them myself.  The end result were bitter tasting mushrooms, and I had even added additional brown sugar during the process.  I didn't bother with the onions, oregano, or S&P in the end because it wasn't going to make enough difference for me.  **SIGH**

Color of mushrooms and taste was good with the addition of the red wine.  But I found that the recipe called for too much red wine vinegar. Even after cooking and sitting in fridge for a day the flavor of vinegar was overwhelming.

I LOVE marinated mushrooms but I only kind of liked this recipe. The red wine was just an odd choice. It made the marinade pink which did not look appetizing. The original flavor was not good so I added more sugar like some people suggested and it kind of saved it, but I will not be making this again.

These were too sweet for my taste.  Not really an italian style marinated mushroom.

This dish was stunning! I served it warm & it was a hit! I did serve it though with red bell pepper strips instead of diced & used white onion instead of green onions.

I LOVED these mushrooms!  I didn't have any red wine on hand so I used a cup of beef broth.  They were fantastic!  I will try these again and next time use the red wine and add a little more garlic!

These are best warm, not at room temperature.  Other than that, they were fine.

Great recipe. Takes a little time, but it's well worth it. You can add more mushrooms if you'd like, since there is plenty broth.

Simple to make and tastes great.  Exactly what I was looking for.  I boiled a package of mushrooms in this mixture for about 5 mins then set it in the fridge for two days.  Ate it on top of salad and just by themselves.  Am making again for grilling.  Thanks!

These were pretty good, and not difficult to make. I think I would leave out the green onions next time, and perhaps try white wine and white wine vinegar to improve the appearance.

Super easy.  I like a little extra red pepper strips.  I think they are best room temp or warm but they are good on a salad as well.

I made these a few days ahead of Christmas intending to serve them. When I tested them Christmas morning they were a kind of unusual taste so I didn't serve them. My husband and I ate them heated a few days later, they were okay, with a quite strong vinegar flavor. I liked the little bit of zesty heat but would probably not make again.

I served these chilled the day I made them and they were awful. I don't know what was wrong. The alcohol/vinegar taste was so strong we could barely choke them down and I didn't even use all that it called for. I was the only one willing to try them again a few days later and they were much better, but still not as good as I had hoped.

These were fantastic!  Boiling the mushrooms, then allowing them to cool in the pot gave them a nice texture.  However, I realized too late that I had completely forgotten the brown sugar--but it didn't matter!!  So, I recommend trying them without the sugar--they were really zesty!  Next time, I will use the sugar, but they were great anyway.

Used organic portobellos and eliminated crushed red pepper because Hubby can't handle them. Didn't use red pepper because didn't have on hand but dish was still a hit! Cooked perfectly and had good flavor. Definitely do this one again. Both of us liked it and I don't usually like mushrooms!

Served over pasta with braciole  & tomato sauce

My husband and I love to cook and love mushrooms! We made this last night and all we could taste was the vinegar. We may try it again and leave the red wine vinegar out.
