i followed the recipe and it came out great the only thing is its way to sweet. next time i would not use no were near the recommended amount of white chocolate. it just is to much and makes it way to sweet. i would suggest maybe a less then half a bag of  the the white chocolate chips .

This was delicious!   Very light and summery.   I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used just over half a bag of Ghirardelli Classic White Chips.   My boys gave this dessert rave reviews and they had seconds.   It was a little labor intensive but the result was exquisite.   I think this would make an amazing special occasion dessert.   It seems fancy and special.   I will make it again!  By the way... Despite using this web site for roughly 14 years, this is the first time I've bothered to write a review!  If your berries aren't very sweet, you may want to add a bit of sugar to the chopped berries on top.

PS:   I thought about using Walker's Shortbread cookies, but we ended up keeping those to eat.  So... I used a 10 ounce box of Lorna Doone cookies for the crust and added a bit more melted butter.   I only had a 10 inch spring form pan and it worked out very well.

We made this in school and it was so good. We couldn't get enough of it. I highly recommend it.
