I had fresh kale in the garden which I used in place so the spinach and then I added carrots and green beans. We loved it. I froze some and are the rest!

The photo and review is for an entirely different recipe.  I tried the actual recipe and it wasn't very good. Maybe it's more of an acquired taste but the spinach and chicken broth didn't seem to mesh well.
