Very good!  This did just hit the spot on a cold winter day here in Minnesota!  I added more potato and celery than stated I also heavied up on the cheese just because it looked so good.  But Im sure this is a delicious recipe just as it is for sure!  My family gobbled this up!  A note on the 'dumplings'  They are really just a very small noodle rather than an actual dumpling, but I believe they added an extra texture that really made this recipe tasty so I would recommend keeping them.  Trust the recipe!

This was very good. Next time I would puree the mixture before adding the dumplings because I felt the veggie chunks overshadowed the texture of the dumplings. I had leftover kielbasa so I used that in place of the ham and it worked great. I have had this in my box to try for over 1 year. I am so glad I finally tried it!

It was fantastic and very easy to make. However it did seem a little thick so I used more milk than it called for and I substituted the ham with bacon. It was a great meal for such a cold day.

Yum, loved this recipe! I had never made dumplings, so I was skeptical about how they would turn out--but they gave the soup good texture and I was pleased with the results.   I would call this a chowder instead of a soup because it's so thick and hearty-might add more liquid next time.  Well done!

I would definitely give this a five star rating.  The dumplings are great.  I didn't have any ham around so I substituted about 6 strips of maple bacon and it was delicious! I will definitely make this again

The soup was okay, we didn't love it.  The cheese didn't melt all the way at the end - it just clumped on to the ham.  I couldn't figure out the dumplings.  I just ended up with a hard ball of dough!

This soup sounded like the perfect solution to my potato ham soup delema.  However it was not quite what I was expecting in taste.  Maybe it was the thyme?  Others may like it, just not my cup of tea.  The boyfriend liked it.  I did add extra milk at the end because it was so thick.

So delicious! My very picky toddler who mostly throws her food polished off a good sized bowl without complaint then demanded seconds, she polished off that half bowl quite happily too! Hubby and I loved it too. I added one extra each of potato, celery, and carrot, and about a cup of water to make up for the extra but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Definitely added to the rotation!

Wonderful!!  The whole family loved it!  It did take me longer than 45 minutes to make it though, but well worth it!   I added more carrots and celery too and thought it was great!The broccoli took longer to cook too.

I thought this would be good, but it was just too much stuff in one pot. It isnt a creative mixture blended together to create some great tasting soup. No one in the family liked it.  :(

This is a great recipe! It turned out like a potato soup with tons of great veggies in it. I modified it slightly as I got toward the end of the recipe because it wasn't all going to fit in the pot (come to think of it, this was due to the fact that I tripled the amount of celery and carrots called for). I only added about 2 cups each of milk and cheese, and left out the dumplings entirely. Great taste, no need for salt.

I thought this recipe was very tasty though my children were not as thrilled. But then, if it's not Mac 'n cheese, they aren't likely to eat it.  In an effort to hide the veggies, I pureed the carrots and broccolli (after steaming them).  Other than that, I followed the recipe and I thought it was great especially for this cold winter night in sunny South Florida. (Yes, it was a record breaking  37 degrees!)

This recipe was exactly what it said!  It was perfect.  I followed the directions almost to the letter.  I only changed the kind of cheese (used what I had in the fridge) and added more ham, my family are meat eaters! It is definitely a keeper.  Everything I needed for this soup I already had in the kitchen which was perfect for the cold front which founds it's way to our town.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was kinda disappointed with the soup because the dumplings didn't turn up in the soup. Other than that great soup.

This soup was delicious! Ended up having to add 2 cups more chicken broth because it was too thick. Also cut back on the cheese to 2 cups and it was still very rich and cheesy.  Definitely a keeper

yummy.  5 for flavor, though I left out the dumplings and partially pureed it.  took away one star because of the curdling.  a few other reviews mentioned it too.  did some research to see if I could salvage it.  I couldn't, but may be able to keep it from happening next time by modifying the last step.  rather than continuing to cook after the cheese has been added, make sure all is ready (broccoli tender etc), take it off the heat and add the cheese, stir until melted.  it should be hot enough to melt the cheese.  adding extra heat, makes the cheese separate, thus curdling the dish.

This turned out great!  Very forgiving.  I had few plain potatoes so I used a bagged stew vegetable mix of potatoes, pearl onions, celery, and carrots.   I also had only about 1.5 to 2 cups of cheese, so I lessened the milk to 3 cups.  In addition I added a splash of ground mustard. Everything else was roughly as stated in the recipe.  Even with these changes it was great!  My toddler and husband both devoured it.  Huge success!  Thanks for posting!

WOW! WOW! WOW!!!  I modified this recipe for a low carb diet and it was fantastic.  I can only assume that the fully loaded recipe as written would be out of this universe.  The changes I made to make it low carb were:  no potatoes (instead I used some cauliflower), no carrot, no flour (and therefore no need for the egg).  After adding the chicken stock, I added the broccoli and cauliflower, brought to a boil and then simmered for 15 minutes.  Then I added the 4 cups of milk.  To thicken the soup, I used another 1/2 cup of milk with 1/4 cup of cornstarch blended together and then slowly poured in before I added the ham and cheese.  I brought the pre-ham and cheese mixture to a small boil to thicken.  Then added the ham and slowly the shredded cheese to melt it consistently.  Also, in the very beginning, I browned the diced ham in the soup pot, removed the ham but let the crusty stuff on the bottom of the pan.  Then I added the butter and sautéed the onions and celery, and went on with the recipe.  I feel like this is a very decadent meal and I'm not missing out on any flavor at all!  Enjoy!!!

This soup was AWESOME! I followed the directions to a T and it came out perfect. I did add an extra carrot!  
I did not have cayenne or thyme and I didn't replace them with anything. The flavor was great. My husband loved it and so did I . Will def make again soon. 
Next time I will a couple more carrots and celery, I really like veggies. 
NOTE: sprinkle green onions and bacon on top before serving, looks great and tastes better!!! thanks for sharing a yummy recipe!

This soup makes me happy!  I was unsure about the dumplings, but another reviewer said to trust the recipe, and I'm glad I did.  I followed it to a T, other than I held back on some of the cheese, as I want to pair it with grilled cheese sandwiches this cold, snowy week.  I just finished  eating 2 large bowls.  Yum!

Excellent base recipe, though I did adjust a bit.  Cut back a bit on the thyme because I like a more subtle taste.  Save a cup of the broth and  cooked/steamed broccoli in it. Used an immersion blender to puree and then added it to the cooked vegetables.  Rather than making dumplings, I used the butter,  flour, and a big pinch of nutmeg and  lightly browned to a roux. Allowed the roux to cool down and then used the immersion blender to incorporate the milk into the roux. Used only about one cup of cheese to try to cut down on the fat in the soup.  Soup was very thick, so I added a bit more water--maybe 1 cup. The hubby said "This is really good!" He is a man of few words so I think it's a winner.

Just made this and it is delicious! This recipe is spot on for a cold wintry day! Other than decreasing the cheese some, (cause I had less) and using 1/2 can of evaporated milk and 1-1/2 C of 2  percent Milk and a pinch of nutmeg and dusting of cinnamon at the end.. I made this exactly as written. The dumplings were an added treat I really love the baby pieces, not too overwhelming,  just right, light and easy! Thank you for the delicious recipe

This was a nice recipe.  I tend to make some variation of a potato, broccoli, cheese soup quite frequently.  It's hardy and warm and it reheats nicely for several days.  I omitted the ham as I served it as a "side".  It needed a bit more seasoning so I added 2 large tablespoons of a chicken bouillon paste and lots of fresh and dried garlic.  This addition really helped.  I made small "balls" out of the dumpling ingredients.  Make sure to keep them small or they won't cook up in time with the rest of the soup.  I add the cheese to each individual bowl instead of to the whole pot.  I will for sure make this again the family loved it.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and my family loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled the celery and carrots.  I loved how thick it was and the tiny dumplings were so good.  To me this is an elevated version of broccoli cheese soup and I will definitely make it again.

My husband and I really liked this soup. It was very hearty, but we weren't able to notice the baby dumplings in the soup. I would put them in again just as a way to thicken up the soup.

Loved it, real depth of good flavors.  I made only half the amount but scaled everything exactly.  Didn't have any thyme but used everything else and added nothing.  Because of dental work I pureed the vegetables after they were cooked then I added ham and ( thawed ) frozen broccoli to the blender.  I put it back in the pan, added milk then melted the cheese in once the soup was hot enough.  Really was exactly what I was looking for.  Will make a whole batch next time and hopefully won't have to puree it.  Thanks!

I make a couple good soups after holidays. I had the ingredients, so I gave this a try. I agree, it is just ok. I will improve it with a block (1 lb, maybe more) of Velveeta. On the dumplings, yeah that can be a big clump disaster, even with a ricer. I ended up making 1/4 tsp dumplings. Love dumplings. For salt/pepper, using Montreal Steak seasoning. Guarantee this will become good. Thanks for the base recipe.

I was a little tired of my mom's wonderful potato soup, so I thought I'd try this one. I won't make it again. It tasted fine. But what it did to my pots! I have good, solid, stainless steel pots. That much work to get the pots clean completely outweighed the unimpressive flavor.

Made this tonight but did mine in the crock pot instead for 7 hours on medium. I followed the recipe as far as sautéing the celery and onion but then took it a step further and browned my ham and I added corn and browned that a little too. I added the milk but also used about 6-7 cups of ham broth from my ham bone. The seasonings were great especially the cayenne pepper. Gave it a small kick that hit the spot. We ate this on a cold rainy gloomy day so it was the perfect ending to our day. Thanks for sharing.

This is the kind of soup I never make because it is rich and starchy. But it was a cold night and this fit some things I wanted to use up. Mmmm...hit the spot! My one real change was to use red bell peppers instead of carrots. Also I used mostly 1% milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream. These changes were just to use up some odds and ends. I don't know how the dumplings were supposed to be, but they mainly thickened the soup and gave it texture. They were not actually noticeable when eating it.

This was really yummy though I made three changes: olive oil instead of butter (and I used about 1/2 as much), added about 1 cup of corn taken off the cob and only two cloves of garlic instead of the four. I will definitely make this again!

I made this vegetarian by using vegetable broth and substituting a half bag of split peas for the ham. The peas made the soup really ugly, but if you can see passed ugly food, it was tasty. I made ham on  the side for the non-vegetarians. It really needs the ham. Without the ham, it needs a lot more salt.

I just tried this awesome recipe - even my kids liked it. I only didn't put the cheese into the soup but everybody could put some cheese in his bowl. And I added a few fresh slices mushrooms, because they were sitting in the fridge. I think, you would be able to omit the egg - flour and just add a cup of Alfredo Sauce instead, omitting the milk altogether. Thanks for a great idea.

This was excellant once I had the soup boiling and the flavor i wanted i dumped in a package of vegtables normandy and shut the pot off. The frozen vegtables heated in the pot and were crisp and tasty in the soup with big chunks of ham and little chunks of potatoe

The soup was very good, although a little on the thick side. If I made it again, I would add more chicken stock.

The flour/egg didn't make dumplings so much as it made a very thick soup. Very delicious.

The ideas are all there, but my soup separated.  Use whole milk and/or some heavy cream to help prevent that.  Flavors are all there though - I'd just up the spicing.
