This was my first attempt at pumpking pie, and it was a very easy recipe!  Everyone liked it, however mine didn't quite set up, so in the future I'll add another 10 minutes or so to the cooking time.  I also used 1 1/2 tsps. of Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus instead of the individual spices and that worked out very well.  Thanks for the recipe! :-)

I used this one because I could not find my tried and true pumpkin pie recipe. I was looking for one that contained brown sugar, at least in part.  This one contains all brown sugar, and it's too much.  I added extra spices (additional cinnamon and some ground cloves).  It was good, but mine is better.

I'm not a big fan of pumpkin pie, but I tried this recipe for my daughter.  Loved it!

It's a hit!  Nice and fluffy. Be sure to cover the crust while baking.

Cooking time is way off, and we added 1/4 teaspoon cloves for a more complex taste.

I used this recipe and followed it 100%.  Instead of making a pie I made tarts instead.  It made 48 tarts and I had a bit left over. Still baked them at 425 and they were ready after 30 mins. They turned out awesome!  I love pumpkin pie and will use this recipe from now on.  Thank you!
