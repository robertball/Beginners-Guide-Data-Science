Wow is this worth it.  Made 1/2 batch before and the other after overnight refrigeration.  Noticeably better after refrigerating but great either way.  This taste better than the naan I get at Indian restaurants. Used with chef John felafel and tahini sauce. Excellent combo.  For me a big difference was cooking 30 seconds on each side TWICE rather than 45-60 secs at once. Less burn and a GREAT air rise to create a nice pocket for the felafel

Thank you Chef John! 

This recipe is delicious!There is a learning curve on the stretching over the bowl technique. I used bigger dough balls and did less rolling out, more stretching by hand.
 It's so much easier and more fun to make than a traditional loaf of bread. 
Almost no clean up and just tastes so darn scrumptious! Hold me back!

DELICIOUS bread recipe and I highly recommend. BUT I suggest adding in the second round of flour slowly, the first time I made this, the 2 cups made it much too dry and there was no going back. Which should be done with all bread recipes...but I was being impatient. It’s amazing with Chef John’s gyros, tzatziki, and any kind of grilled lamb!

Made this just as written. Family loved it.  Even my 12 year old granddaughter  like this,  which she usually doesn't like anything that is homemade.

Was not difficult to make and I found it rather easy to stretch out. Be sure to add the additional flour gradually. I dumped in too much initially and had to fuss with it a bit to get a dough with a good consistency.  This is a great textured bread though I feel if you will be eating it on its own it could benefit from additional salt. If you will be adding fillings then don't increase the salt so whatever ingredients you put in will shine through.

CJ, again you stepped up and pleased the whole family! I agreed this bread will now replace our flour, corn, naan and pita fix! You definately do not need to buy store made wraps of any sort, you can adjust the recipe to suit the meal and make either larger or smaller versions of this recipe, thanks again for another job well done!

I’m making this bread for the third time. First two times, it was amazing. My whole family loved it. Very good recipe. And much easier to make than I thought it would be. Don’t be intimidated by having to stretch it out. I alternate between stretching it on a bowl and rolling it out with a rolling pin until it gets big enough. I’ve found that works best for me. Watch the video if you need help. I didn’t think it was quite as easy to stretch as he makes it look. But it’s not too bad.

I used whole wheat flour.  Definitely double the recipe.  Also, golf ball sized balls of dough aren't large enough.  Need to double that to get a good size pita.

I'm SURE it was a user error but the dough seemed to be too dry by the time I added all the flour.  I also had an issue with the bread tearing during the stretching.  Probably due to it being too dry.  I will be making it again and I have high hopes still.

So good with hummus!  It is just hard to wait until day two to cook it.  Kind of cruel not to mention that at the start of the video!  Stretching over the bowl is fun once you get the hang of it and then it is so much faster cooking than the pita bread recipe.  Plus I find that it puffs up much better.  Thanks Chef John!

Tasty and easy to make, with a slight crisp to its softness. The dough ended up being too dry even with thorough mixing however, upped the olive oil to 2 tbsp and it made the perfect tortillas for taco night, thanks Chef!

This is awesome!  I did have trouble at first with the stretching and having some tearing of the dough.  After a bit, it was easier.  I think it might be as it becomes more room temperature it becomes more pliable rather than right out of the fridge.  Three of us ate the whole batch with Chef John's recipe for American Gyros!  Yummmm

I used these as a lighter option in place of pita bread for gyros.
I did have trouble getting it thin enough without it tearing. Since I didn't want them super thin, I made 1 1/2 of the recipe and made 8 out of those. They turned out really well, light and fluffy with just a just a touch of crisp

Tastes like pizza dough but is like a stiff-ish tortilla. I would cut down on the salt. It’s too savory (like pizza without condiments). 

I 4x this recipe since we eat a lot of tortillas. I recommend not making only 8 servings.

You can also make this more low carb by having the added flour be part gluten-free flour. I made the flour sponge with allpurpose like normal. However, I added half flaxmeal for the next step’s addition of flour. It does not stretch as far but it is still thin and tasty

Made it with All-purpose flour. It was still very good. Alas, I slept in a bit and it took longer than 9hours and 38 minutes to make....
