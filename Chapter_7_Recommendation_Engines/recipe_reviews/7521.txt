Works great in chocolate cake.  I used with Hershey's Chocolate Cake (on this website) and frosted with buttercream icing....rave reviews!

This custard is so easy and delicious, and it's a great way to use up leftover egg yolks.  I made it with whole milk powder and vanilla flavor (instead of almond) and served it with apple pastries, and it was superb!

Fabulous and so easy! I filled a white cake with this and added an almond flavored white frosting, sprinkled with some slivered almonds. I'll definitely use this recipe again!

Yup this is very good and easy. Didn't have to change a thing and it was just the right taste and amount to fill a cake. I made a layered cake, cut the layers in two, and filled each layer dividing the filling in thirds. I think it works better that way otherwise I can imagine if you used all of the filling in one layer it might seep out a bit. I did also chill the filling first too.

This was my first time making custard, and it turned out perfect. Make sure to stay right by the stove and to continue stiring, so it doesn't go lumpy! My in-laws are from England, and the only difference is that they don't put as much sugar. I made this just like the recipe said, adding vanilla instead of almond, and my husband loved it!

The flavor wasn't offensive, but the aftertaste burned my throat- too much almond extract I think.  It also lacked any depth and texture. 
After making a small batch, I remade the recipe.  In place of water I substituted a 50% mixture of skim milk and fat free 1/2&1/2.  I also reduce the almond by 1/2 and substituted vanilla for the other 1/2. This made for a thick and rich finished product that was much better than the original recipe(as several people can attest).  The only other change I will make in the future is to reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup, and reduce the cornstarch to 1-1&1/2 Tablespoons because with the new recipe it came out more like pudding.

I have now made this twice.  The first time I had the hardest time getting it to thicken.  I'm guessing my "guestimating" of the cornstarch didn't cut it.  It was an easy fix--I just mixed a small amount (1/2 tbsp) of cornstarch with some milk, added it to the custard, and continued to cook it.  The second time I was more careful with my measurements and the custard thickened beautifully.  I'm so glad it's full-proof!  It's a delicious custard that I used to fill a white almond cake found on this website.  If you love almond-flavored foods, you'll die when you have this.

Yum Yum Yum! This was my first time making custard, and i was a little worried how it would come out, and how i would layer it in between my cakes. The custard was delicious, and my husband and his brother loved it! I wanted a big batch, so i doubled everything, including the almond extract for extra flavor. Since i double the recipe i had to cook over high heat at first, other wise it wouldn't solidify. I chilled it over night, then used it as my layer in my sheet cake. the custard was a big hit, and i'll be making it again.

What a great way to use leftover egg yolks. The almond extract was not such a good thing for mine. It smelled yummy till I added the almond extract. Since my husband can't eat a lot of sugar, I used granulated Splenda and evap. milk instead (He is also allergic to regular milk). Most of it is done!

DELICIOUS!!!  I was a bit wary at first because of the smell of the non-fat dry milk, but once I added the almond extract, that dissapeared.  I cannot stop sticking my fingers in it! (Using it as a filling for the Cream of Coconut Cake along with the Light and Creamy Brown Sugar and Chocolate Frosting)

This custard was delicious without changing a thing. I was looking for a filling thick enough to fill a tart and this worked perfectly. Vanilla flavor could be easily substituted for the almond flavoring. Great recipe!!

This is great cake filling, just be sure to chill it or your layers will slide apart.  Great when used with with decorator icing that also has almond flavoring.

Pretty good.  For us 1/2 cup sugar was plenty.  Instead of water I used skim milk, for powder dry milk I used powder coffee creamer because that's what I had on hand. Substituted equally no problem.  I did 1/2 the almond called for and the other half vanilla.  It goes from it not being thick and is never going to get thick to OMG its thick. Served it on the side of a pound cake with fresh blueberries on top.  I'm sure it would be great in a trifle or parfait cup.

This was so easy and yummy. It took me less than 7 minutes to cook and 30 minutes to cool. By the time the white cake was done and cool this filling was ready.

I have had trouble making custard fillings in the past, but this one is foolproof. I used this in a chocolate almond cake. I added 1 oz. of semisweet chocolate when I took it off the heat. It gave it a hint of chocolate and a nice chocolate color for the cake filling.

Nice texture & super easy to make.  Used it to fill my almond poppy seed muffins.  Only complaint is that I can still taste the powdered milk.  I do have sensitive taste buds and my box was expired...although it smelled the same as a fresh one does...terrible!  Love the almond flavoring.  Will make again with fresh, powdered milk.  Hope that changes the results!  (Glad I made the full recipe; I did have some leftover, but less than 1/3)

Recipe produces a sweet, thick "custard", such as you might get at the grocery store bakery. It's sole redeeming feature is that it is easy, although it has an alarming tendency to curdle at the edges.

This is WONDERFUL. I love how nearly everything in this recipe can be kept on-hand in the pantry. The texture and sweetness were perfect. I was leery of the amount of almond extract so I used only 1/2 teaspoon, which was perfect for me. I used this to fill an orange cake with orange white chocolate frosting. Looking forward to playing around with different flavors. Yum!

Amazing!  My 11 year old daughter made this with a little supervision.  Definitely making it again.  We used it for filling for vanilla crepes.  It would make a great filling for cakes or centers for cupcakes.  Fantastic!

I cut back on the almond extract ... but shouldn't.  It would have been perfect as written.  It made enough to fill a triple, 9-inch layer cake (might have been a little much for just a double layer cake, but then you could eat the rest!)  I'm going to make again with lemon extract.  Wow is this a fantastic recipe.

This was so delicious I wanted to just sit and eat it with a spoon....I did go by recommendations and did only 1/2 tsp almond extract and then 1/2 tsp vanilla...but that was mainly because I was using it on a white chocolate almond cake w/white chocolate almond frosting and thought I had enough almond already. I also had to improvise because for some reason the grocery store I went to did not have nonfat dry milk. So instead of that I used a 12 can of evaporated milk and eliminated the water. I did have to add 1 more Tbsp of corn starch, but it still turned out perfectly delicious! I will definitely use this as a filling as often as I can.. :)

There is too much almond extract on this recipe. I felt like if my tongue and throat were burning. However, 1/2 a teaspoon of extract would work well.   Will do again.

So easy to make.  I especially like using the powdered milk.  I used it for a marble cake I made.  Still had some left over.

I love this filling.  Of course I love almond-flavored anything!  I think it could have used a bit more almond extract, but I followed the recipe exact being the first time I attempted it.  I used this for filling for a chocolate 8" layer cake, it looks like I have enough for two cakes.  Great recipe.  Thank you!

I make this all the time with the egg yolks left over from making Swiss meringue buttercreams.  I do reduce the sugar though.

Substituted with regular 2% milk (omit the dry milk and water). Used vanilla flavor. Chilled and ate with strawberries. Dish

This taste great! I am going to put it in a puff pastry shell and top it with whipped cream for a fun dessert. Definitely a keeper!

The almond taste was overwhelming even after cutting the almond extract in half.  The custard has a very "eggy" flavor.

This was "good". Based on other reviews, I cut WAY back on the sugar and it still came out very sweet. I also did 1/2 vanilla, 1/2 almond. This will fill a chocolate cake for Halloween, so of course I'll be adding orange coloring :-) Thanks for sharing.

I had some extra egg yolks from a different recipe and this put them to a great use! Just minutes to make too.

Used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extracts with 1.5 Tbsp marachino cherry juice. It took a full minute of whisking to incorporate all the cherry at the end. I realize the cherry juice thinned it out a little but I agree the filling is not thick enough. As the recipe stands I would add at least 1 more tsp of cornstarch. Though I can't recall having a custard filling or topping on poppy seed cake, so maybe I'm speaking out of turn, because that's how it's supposed to be. Several people took home the modified recipe. I used as tart filling and sprinkled with a few slivered almonds and half a maraschino cherry. Thanks for sharing. :)
