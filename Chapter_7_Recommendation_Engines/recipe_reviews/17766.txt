While I'm gratified to know that a New England/French Canadian tradition is appreciated in other parts of the country, I have to let you know that you cannot make a pork pie using ground beef.  The taste is very different.  Try asking the butcher to grind pork butt for you.  Then, don't fry the meet, boil it in broth instead.  The result is a creamy paste which creates a melt-in-your-mouth dish with a unique taste.

I use ground pork instead of the beef. I think onion is the trick I use a lot of onion I also throw in a handful of chopped celery.  My family eats this on Christmas eve. We love it.

I love this pie recipe!  I do not always use the same proportions as stated but still never fails.  The only other change is that I sautee the onion a spell with the meat before I put them in the shells.

Being from Rhode Island myself as well as /French Canadian this is not how we make prok pie.  We use half ground pork and half ground pork
there is no potatoes in pork pie that is for meat stuffing, pork pie you use stuffing and no sausage or cinnamon.

I know there is some discrepancy on this actually being "real" pork pie, but honestly I don't care what we name it...it's DELICIOUS!  I halved the recipe for my family of 4 and it was perfect.  I used the Ore Ida steam potatoes for ease and added some grated parmesan cheese to the filling.  My family raved about this pie and so it will be added to the rotation :)
