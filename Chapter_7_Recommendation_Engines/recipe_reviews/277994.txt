This makes a delicious, but spoonable smoothie, rather than a “sippable” one. I brought -as is - to work, but saved half for when I returned home. I then thinned it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk after also straining the seeds through a fine-mesh strainer. I used a mixed berry frozen blend rather than individual types.
