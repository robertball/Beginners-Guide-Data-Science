The cookie TASTE is great...but they stuck to the cookie sheet! (so bad- they would NOT come off) i used parchment paper and it worked fine...another thing to try, i ground the oats for a smoother cookie- very nice!

This was a disaster for me. I made it with egg beaters and as they baked, the eggs just left the cookie! It looked like sweet fried eggs surrounding the piles of dry oats. Then, I added 1 cup of flour. My 4 year old enjoyed them

They were yummy but need flour/something to help them stick together. Must cook on parchment and cook a little longer than recommended.
