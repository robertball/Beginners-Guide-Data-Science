This was fabulous! I really liked it, it was so quick and easy. I used the crockpot because I had a pie in the oven and it turned out wonderful. I did not have an onion on hand so I used some dry, minced onion - never the same - and used minced garlic instead of powder. I think this recipe is a 5 but my husband said 3, he thought it was good but missing something - an onion perhaps? Loved the recipe, I have two deer in the freezer so I will definitely use it again. I do not feel that it would serve 8 though - at least not in this house!

My husband is the venison eater in the family and he said it was very good.  I served it with brown rice and it was a very hearty winter meal.

I used the oven method for cooking and followed the recipe exactly.  I did have to add some water part way thru cooking because it seemed to be thickening up a bit to much.  

Simple tasty meal that I will make again.

Pretty good use for venison.  Reduces the gamey flavor.  I used 1/2 the amount of oil & 1/2 the sour cream (also light sour cream) to cut the calories down even further, and I cooked it in my crockpot.  I also added a little crushed red pepper since my husband likes food spicy.  Served it over noodles.

I thought this was reeally good.  My venison was tough, so next time I will tenderize it first.  But other than that it was delicious.

This was delicious!  I made the following variations to the recipe:
I dredged the meat in almond flour instead of white flour before browning in half olive oil, half butter
I forgot to get a can of tomato sauce, so I actually used a jar spaghetti sauce (it worked!)
I added about 1 cup of red wine to the meat at the beginning of the cook time
Crock pot cooked - low for 8 hours - the meat was so tender! - added the sour cream at the end just before serving.
Will definitely make this again!

This was fantastic.  So quick and easy.  Every time I make it someone asks me for the recipe!  I do use less tomato sauce than here, and a few more herbs, and I also added finely diced carrots to add a vegetable to the main dish.

Delicious.  I made a few changes, I used olive oil, diced tomatoes, and put everything in a slow cooker for about 2.5 hours - turned out great.

I have used this recipe many times just as written. It is delicious and the meat is so tender.  The sauce is perfect, and has the right amount of tang from the combination of sour cream, Worcester, and tomatoe sauce.  So good in fact that today I came back to this loved by all recipe, this time using beef stew cuts rather than the venison. Thank you for sharing your great recipe.
