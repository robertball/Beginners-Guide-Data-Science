Perfect icing for sugar cookies!! Pipes easily from a pastry bag and dries on the cookies so your designs stay put!  Tastes yummy too!  I made this again last night tried to spread the icing on the cookies (vs. using a pastry bag).  It was very smooth for the first few cookies, but then turned really "grainy".  I finally found that if I put the bowl of icing over a saucepan w/ simmering water and stir often, it will stay smooth and spread easily.

I made this for my "Ultimate Sugar Cookies" (recipe on this site").  I substituted liquid hazelnut coffee creamer for the cream and eliminated using any extract flavoring.  This was sooooo good.  Frosting hardened on the cookie just like I wanted.  Could store cookies between wax paper without smudging any frosting.  You need to work fairly quickly frosting the cookies.  I just kept stirring in between.  Didn't have any problems at all.  My adult kids and grandkids just loved this.  Will make again.

Delicious alternative to royal icing!  It pipes beautifully, and is easy to change the consistency to suit your needs.  I added a touch more vanilla, just because we like it (you can use clear vanilla if you need whiter icing).  We decorated tons of gingerbread cookies and they looked and tasted great - the icing dries shiny and hardens so that you can stack your masterpieces.  This is a staple for the holidays!

Very good recipe for sugar cookies. I slimmed them down by using skim milk instead of the cream and it still turned out great.

This recipe is wonderful! I needed an icing that would dry semi hard - so my decorations wouldn't smudge/ fall apart or off, yet, not be rock hard like royal frosting. This works great! It hardens, but NOT too hard. yet was soft enough for us to eat. All my gingerbread man decorations stayed on perfect! This frosting is also Creamy and flavorful and you dont need alot on any cookie to get the benefits of it.(sweetness wise) - which makes it go further. I made the mistake of coating a cookie with it completely, and wow! overkill! You just need a little bit to get that sweet flavor and really perk up the cookies. All my colors blended in nicely too. If the mix starts to get a little hard while you are doing other things, just stir in a little hot water till you get the consistency back that you need. It will still harden up later with no problems. You can also nuke icing bags for 10 seconds if the icing hardens in it as well. Im going to use this recipe forever! thanks!

This frosting is perfect.  It is easy to make and easily speadable.  Once set it is still soft, but you can easily stack cookies without any problems.  Try it with Almond extract for a delicious flavor...excellent on sugar cookies.  I used it on the recipe titled Best Rolled Sugar Cookies-delicious.  Perfect for decorating Holiday themed cut out cookies! I used food coloring with great results. This is a keeper.

This icing tastes great on my sugar cookies and hardens nicely. The best thing I've found to do with these is to replace the regular cream with flavored coffee cream. That simple change makes this absolutely de-vine:)

I was making up some Bosses Day cookie & candy baskets, and wanted to try a different icing recipe.  I usually use a wonderful tasting buttercream, but the problem is it never seems to harden (one reason why I like it so much, just not good when cookies must touch each other).  I used milk in place of cream, and almond extract instead of vanilla.  I melted the butter in the microwave and added everything else to that in the same mixing bowl.  You have to work fast because the icing sets up very quickly.  Luckily it reheats well in the microwave since it sets up quickly in the bowl, too!  This is a very good icing recipe for cookies, and I bet it would be great drizzled over things like cinnamon rolls or coffee cakes, too.  I would stick to a thicker, fluffier buttercream type frosting for cakes or for decorating with tips, but this is excellent for when you want something that will harden and that you can maybe stick a few sprinkles into.  I'll definitely use it again.

I was very happy with this recipe. I have made it several times since I first printed it out. I made a batch of Cookie Press Butter spritz cookie and a regular batch of sugar cookie and used it on both. I go to a school for culinary arts specializing in Baking and Pastry Arts. I took them in to school and not only did the students like them. So did the chef instructors. Great recipe. This one is added to my personal recipe book. Thanks for sharing.

This is a great cookie icing!!  Hardens beautifully allowing the cookies to be 'stackable'.  I made chocolate drop cookies then used this icing. I added cocoa to the icing then after beating it smooth, I added toasted pecans. After icing cookies, I sprinkled coconut on top.  Very nice presentation and a very yummy cookie.  Highly reccomended

Good, reliable and certainly easy enough to adjust the consistency to your liking with more or less cream (I used half and half).  I used this frosting for "Amish Cookies," recipe also from this site. My only concern is that had I needed a pure white frosting,  this would not have been a good choice because of the vanilla.  But even at that, it would be easy enough to reduce the amount of vanilla or even leave it out altogether, use clear vanilla, or almond extract, which is also clear.

Exactly what I was looking for! I kept the pan on the stove on VERY low just to keep it from hardening. I had to stir before each time I iced a cookie but it was well worth it. This icing is not too soft or hard. You can stack cookies after they dry. Thanks for sharing!

This worked great.  I doubled the recipe and added more powdered sugar and more milk as needed to reach the right consistency.   I used 2% milk since that's all I had on hand and worked great.  I put the frosting in a large zip lock baggie with my Wilton cake dec tips and cut the corner out so it was like an icing bag...but no mess...throw away when done...we like this.  All you have to clean is the tips and white plastic jobbies.  It was enough to pipe a whole batch of sugar cookies.  We made 9's and 0's for my Grandmother's 90th b-day party, and piped around the edges with a thick star shaped tip and it looked great.  Dried nice and hard on outside, creamy when you bite into it.  Dried nicely enough to stack pretty on a plate.  Will use again!  If you plan to sprinkle, you must do it right away as it does set up quickly.  It reminds me of the iced sugar cookies  with sprinkles in the round box at Publix.  Yum!

MmmMmMMmmmmmm..... this icing is one of the best I've made! I used milk instead of cream and it still tasted great! Half way through spreading the icing, it got clumpy, so I put it in the microwave for 15 seconds to re heat it... worked beautifully once again.

This is a great icing. I didn't have cream on hand, so I used skim milk. Worked just fine. I used this icing to frost my Spritz cookies. Since the cookies were almond flavored, I added 1/2 tsp. almond extract to the icing.

Perfect icing!!!  it tasted great and dried really nice.  You do have to work fast if you want to add sprinkels on top so do it immediately after icing each cookie.  My husband and son and I worked as a team and it went really fast and we ended up haveing really cute cookies and a good time too.  As for the other posters who said it dried too fast and they had trouble with it you do need to put it in a decorating bag right away.  I put portions of it into baggies and then I could make different colors and each bag was kept fresh and nice.

Wonderful recipe! Taste superb, and the texture is perfect when it sets. Will definitely add to recipe book. Next time I'll use food coloring. I made this for the "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies", by Jill Saunders - tastes wonderful together.

I tried a few cookie frostings on this site and liked the taste of this one best.  I still don't think it's quite as good as the store bought kind, but certainly better than the other 3 I tried on this site.

Perfect icing paired with The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies recipe I found on this site.  The icing was super easy to make and easy to spread on our cookies.  (I didn't bother with piping and making designs etc...not with 2 toddlers wanting to help and I am NOT a patient person...I just wanted the cookies frosted!)
Had to use food coloring with this icing since it did not turn out white (had a slight off white appearance, probably due to the vanilla).
Like others have said, the icing hardens on the top so the cookies could be stacked, yet soft once you bite into them.  Very yummy combo with the cookie recipe I used.  My family ate EVERY LAST cookie!!!

Giving this recipe a three because although the taste was perfect, the texture and workability was HORRIBLE! Too much trouble for what it's worth. It gets hard and un-spreadable far too quickly! You're better off searching for another recipe!

My mom uses almost the exact same recipes every year for her christmas sugar cookies. The only difference is she adds a few drops of food coloring of her choice and doesn't boil anything, she just mixes it right up in a bowl and it is good to go. as long as the butter is close to room temprature it mixes together nicely!

So easy and tastes great.  Sets up very well.  I beat it too much, not knowing that it would set up  and had to add more cream.

beautiful frosting even if using margarine!  I didn't have any butter left so used margarine instead.  Was low on vanilla so replaced with Vanilla liquid coffee creamer.  Also added 1/2 tsp. butter extract.  This is easy to work with and dries quickly.  I did have to add a little more 10x sugar since using the margarine but wonderfully nice recipe for rolled sugar cookies.

Great icing, definitely a keeper! i used it to make drop flowers for sugar cookies and most of them hardened nicely. I did pink and red ones and for some reason the red ones did not stay hard. Other than that, use the icing quickly because it will start to harden in your piping bag. Also, you can refrigerate the icing and when you're ready to reuse just place it in the microwave (defrost) for 10-20 seconds (i was working with about half a cup). Try it!

I liked this icing. I used it to decorate my first crack at homemade gingerbread men. It was a good consistency and dried to a nice hard finish. I had already used the last of my cream for another recipe, so I used whole milk instead and it came out just fine. It will set up quickly on you, so if you have a lot of cookies to ice (or whatever you're using it for), I'd leave it on the stove on low or on top of a heating pad to keep it smooth and spreadable while you work.

GREAT! This was exactly what i was looking for. Instead of cream and vanilla i usesed my flavored coffee creamer and made amaretto frosted sugar cookies. YUM. If it begins to set up in your bowl just throw it in the microwve for 15 second intervals.

Great tasting icing and very easy to modify: can add more powdered sugar to make thicker or more cream to thin.  I made one batch thinner to frost shapes, one batch thicker to pipe thru pastry bag for details.  Icing took about 1 hour to dry enough to be stackable (a little longer for the parts where I piped it on pretty thick).  Piped icing held its shape very well, and sure tastes better than royal icing!  Thanks Barbara.

this is very thick so I think next time I will add a couple tsp of more cream.. I wanted it to be softer so some sprinkles could stick.  As written, I had to press the frosted cookies in the sprinkles as they wouldn't stick otherwise.  Very easy with just a few ingredients.  Taste is good but the texture isn't quite right.

This comes out perfect every time I make it for "Soft Christmas Cookies". It can thicken quickly, but a little bit of hot water (I keep the kettle handy) and it's good to go! It also pipes well too! If I'm doing intricate cookie designs, I usually double the batch. I use half and half or a mixture of that and hazelnut flavored coffee creamer. It comes out great either way.

A very, very difficult icing to work with when following the recipe exactly. I then heeded other reviewers advice.  Despite continuous stirring and leaving over low heat, the icing just crumbled when I attempted to spread it on my snowflake cookies. I ended up adding about 1/4 cup or more of cream and using the icing as a glaze. I then dipped my cookies or drizzled icing over the top. Although flavorful, I will not make again.

This icing was yummy! It was a little sweet for my taste, but I made some different flavors with it and iced cupcakes. I used cocoa for chocolate, i mixed in a little maple flavoring (which was divine!), I also mixed instant coffee in some, and peanut butter in some. The peanut butter was my favorite!

I doubled the recipe and used a microwave to heat the cream & butter.  It came out wonderfully, I split them into multiple bowls and added different food colorings and flavoring (lemon extract) to have a variety of icings at my christmas cookie party.  If they started to harden, a good stir made them spreadable again.  The consistency on the cookies once dry (and even a week later) is slightly harder so I can stack them, but still melt-in-your-mouth when you taste them.

the frosting was absolutely perfect for my sugar cookies this year.  i made it using one-half almond extract / one-half vanilla extract.  it does set up quickly; we had to continuously put it in the microwave to make it spreadable.  everyone in my family is raving about these.

This is a keeper! It's easy to make and is absolutely delicious! It reminds me of those sugar cookies with the pink frosting you find at the stores! I do recommend taking the advice of another reviewer to keep the frosting over a pan of simmering water while frosting as it does become gritty as it cools and makes frosting a little difficult (it will lift off the cookie as your spreading).  Keep it warm and it's easy to use. Thanx for posting!

This is an icing recipe that's been in my family for years, a few exceptions, not quite as much butter, we use milk and we've never heated it, we just mix it all up and slap it on the cookies! :)

Wow, is this excellent cookie frosting. I tripled the recipe to make alot of Christmas cutouts. Followed the recipe exactly and it was aweseome. If it thickened, we just blended it again with a spoon.

Good recipe, the icing does set up quickly which is great for immediate storage. I keep a steaming pot of water nearby to rest my mixing bowl on to prevent the icing from setting up on me as well as my mixer. This is really an excellent recipe for sugar cookies. I used my pastry bag and tips to pipe it onto the cookies.

I have never made a cooked frosting for cookies before and was skeptical.  My husband who does not like cookies with frosting couldn't stop eating this.  My other relatives also loved them and wanted the recipe and for me to make them again.

1) When using butter in this recipe, the icing tends to get a grainy look after a while, but microwaving it for a few seconds will reverse this for some time.
2) This hardens NICELY!!
3) I use half butter/half margarine which tends to make the icing take a longer time to appear grainy.
4) If you're using different colored icings (in different colored containers), cover the ones you aren't using tightly with plastic wrap to keep from drying out.

I used this icing on "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" and it was awesome! I did add about 1/4 tsp almond extract to give it more flavor. This icing does dry out quite fast. Since I made several batches to frost a bunch of cookies I discovered if you add some more cream to it to thin it out as you go it works just fine. You can also try to keep the icing covered with a damp cloth. On the cookies the icing sets up nice and is still soft when you bite into it. A great recipe!

Great!  I added a little extra cream, to make it a little thinner and easier to spread.  VERY easy to make, and easy to adjust for thickness; tasty; and it really does dry very well, so you can stack.  However, adding food coloring made the texture a bit rougher when dry.

I liked this frosting because the powdered sugar blended well with the melted butter. I added the cream after I melted the butter. I did used almond extract which gives the frosting a great flavor. The frosting is not a smooth frosting if that is what you are looking for in a frosting. However, the frosting made great looking Christmas tree shaped sugar cookies. I swirled the frosting and added sprinkles and piped on red frosting dots-that looked like small ornaments.

These were the first ever truffles I have ever made. These really are easy. If you use high quality ingredients (I use belgium chocolate and real vanilla extract) you will have great tasting truffles. The possibilities are endless when you start experimenting with flavors and additions.

This frosting is very easy to make. It's buttery, soft and the kids loved it. What more can I ask for? I thought it was a little too sweet and thick, but that may be because I didn't use a measuring cup in my haste, so I may have put too much sugar.

Love! I wanted something to put on my cutouts that would spread easily, but not dry to a crust, like confectioner's glaze does. This did the trick! I used half-n-half instead of cream, and it worked perfectly.

I have tried every frosting out there and this one is absolutely delicious. You can melt butter in microwave. I also substituted regular cream with flavored coffee creamers--Irish Cream and Amaretto--and, it was excellent.

Disappointing- I used real butter and vanilla and the flavor and consistency was just so-so.

I melted the butter in the microwave, stirred in milk instead of cream and the vanilla, and then added the icing sugar.  I also added cocoa.  The icing was quite soft, I didn't have any problem with it hardening too quickly.  I had to put my bag into the freezer to harden it a bit as the heat from my hands made it too soft after a while.  The icing isn't as neat as royal icing but it is tasty, at least with cocoa in it.

Loved this icing! No changes other than adding 1/2 tsp almond extract (along with the vanilla) and had no problems at all. Just had to stir it a couple of times which is no big deal. If you're also adding colored sugar, it's best to sprinkle on immediately after frosting each cookie...it sets up pretty quickly so waiting until they're all frosted might mean your sugar rolls right off. If this happens, just gently pat it into the icing. Thanks so much.... this one's a keeper!

Worked perfectly. I didn't melt the butter. Mixed butter, cream, and vanilla together and then added powder sugar. The consistency was perfect for what I wanted. I made half a batch and frosted a dozen round cookies.

This had a weird "melted butter" taste at first but once it dried it was good.  This made more than enough frosting for a 1/2 batch "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies".  It dried pretty fast, a bonus!

What a great icing - super flavour. I found it a tad thick initially, but just added a bit more cream until it was the consistency I wanted. It does harden quickly in the bowl (as was mentioned by several other reviewers) - to prevent that happening, just remove the beaters from the mixer, dampen a tea towel, and keep the bowl covered with the tea towel between spreading icing on cookies. Awesome recipe, Barbara,

The taste was GREAT!! I used almond extract instead of vanilla.My only complaint was it didnt make that much i had o remake this 3 times o cover all my cookies which was a hassle and i found that when it started cooling it became clumpy so i had to constantly re-heat to make it creamy but the over all taste of the icing was GREAT i may use this again

Frosting tasted great and it was firm enough so I could stack the cookies.  I melted the butter in the microwave and used milk instead of cream and it still turned out great. I will definately use this recipe again.

Absolutely perfect!  I used whole milk instead of cream because that's all I had and it came out perfect.  Easy to work with and dries well.  My search for a great tasting icing that dries hard enough to stack the cookies has ended.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I skipped the whipping stage and just used this right out of the pan. It made a nice glaze. Started as an yellowish brown color but dried to a nice white. Just a good, basic frosting. Nothing fancy.

Great Icing.  Used my microwave to heat the butter and cream.  I added a little more cream, 3 1/2 T to allow for better consistency and it still firmed up well.  I added a few drops of strawberry loran oil to flavor the icing for my daughters Valentines Day party.  This was a nice sweet icing for not so sweet cookies.

This was awsome for gingerbread cookies. It hardened just enough to hold on the rasins I used for decorating and did not over harden and fall off like some icings do, and it was simply delicious.

I was expecting the glossy icing you can dip cookies in--which this isn't!  If you spread it, it looks a little rough--but it pipes beautifully.  We used it to decorate "Eileen's Spicy Gingerbread Men" (on this site) and the sweet buttery flavor went well with that not-too-sweet cookie.  It gets stiff when cool, so you may have to warm it up a few times.  Really good icing.

Very good, tasty icing.  I wish it would be whiter..mine turned out a bit yellowish colored.  I've added more powdered sugar and that seems to help.  I will continue using this recipe.

I made this frosting for a Valentine's sugar cookie decorating party. It was easy to pipe and delicious! Basically followed the recipe but added a little more cream for easier piping for the kids. It dried nicely and hardens just enough to hold its shape but doesn't get crunchy. I added some cocoa powder to part of a batch to make chocolate and it was awesome! I will definitely use this recipe again.

Best icing recipe without shortening.  I used 2% milk and it tasted great.  I am sure the cream would make it richer.

Delicious and Easy!!  I did find, though, as I was beating it all together, that it was a little thin for my taste.  So I ended up adding more confectioners sugar, but that was just a matter of preference.  The icing dried hard, but not crumbly.  i was able to stack them in my cookie container without a problem.  Thank you for a great recipe-its a keeper!!

This is a good basic icing.  It tasted pretty good, and spread easily until it started to harden a bit.  You could fix this by microwaving at 30% for a few seconds, or if using stainless steel bowls, let them sit on a burner on low for a few seconds.  Definitely a keeper!

Perfect for icing gingerbread.  We used this for a kids cookie decorating party.  I made the icing about an hour ahead and put it into piping bags.  Just before decorating I microwaved it for about 20 seconds and it was the perfect consistency to squeeze out onto the cookies.  The icing hardened nicely during the party and the kids could stack the cookies to take them home a couple hours after decorating.  Just the recipe I was looking for!  I made it exactly as stated.

Good basic icing for cookies. I used 2% milk instead of cream(all I had). Frosted molasses cookies with it. Spread easily, hardened well, not overly sweet. Thanks Barb, for sharing!

Very good. I melted butter with half and half in microwave. I didn't beat the icing, it was more of a glaze. It does set up very fast, so I would place over double boiler with simmering water.  Then, dip top half of the cookie and shake excess.

I have used this so much! I used egg nog during the holidays. I just used strawberry flavor/extract instead of vanilla for icing on a yellow cake. It's a pretty forgiving recipe too, I put less sugar and it's very sweet still. I add more milk (instead of cream) and it's still the great. I use cream for special occasions. This is a must keep, quick, and delicious icing/frosting recipe.

Yummy! I didn't have cream so I used nonfat drymilk mixed at a 50/50 ratio. The vanilla taste was a bit too strong, but I fixed that with another 1/4 c. powdered sugar. I think using actual cream would've fixed the vanilla problem though. Super easy and sets well.

I used this recipe for a Martha Stewart lemon cookie recipe instead of the glaze mentioned in that recipe (on another website), it was really good and it stuck hard on the cookies but not like Royal Icing -TOO hard- They covered about 45 cookies putting about a teaspoon and a half on each cookie.. A couple of things I did to make it suit the lemon cookies better were that first, I used full fat milk instead of cream, and second, I added a tablespoon of lemon juice to make it lemony. They turned out great! (:

Very tasty icing.  It hardened rather quickly so you need to be ready to spread it on.  It can also be warmed in the microwave for a few seconds to help the spread-ability.

This worked well and tasted good. I didn't have any heavy cream so I used Vanilla flavored coffee creamer like another reviewer suggested. It did thicken up while frosting the last of the cookies, but dried nicely.

This icing tastes all right, however I simply could not ice fast enough.  I had to keep microwaving the icing to make it pliable and sticky again.  I'm used to working with shortening or cream cheese frosting bases, so maybe I'm just not familiar enough with this type, but I will not be using this recipe again.

This icing dried too quickly for me.  I kept rewarming the icing and after a few cookies, I gave up and used another recipe.  This recipe tasted good, but would have been better if I was using a piping bag.

Thank you thank you thank you!  This is the basic recipe I use for cake icing, too.  I have successfully made it for cookies before but it's always hit or miss since I never knew how much of anything I used.  I just iced the sugar cookies I made and they are divine.  Usually I just sprinkle on sugar but this is way better.  It's an old recipe that makes cakey thick not-too-sweet cookies that are just perfect for frosting.  I found that just stirring everything in the pan made the frosting smooth and perfect so I didn't bother with the mixer.  I also kept a small amount of skim milk (used instead of cream) next to me and added a few drops whenever the icing dried out.  No need for reheating or anything else.  These were ready to layer between sheets of waxed paper in less than an hour.  Thanks again for figuring out the proportions for me!

Tastes delicious, dries nice.  Use a sandwich baggie, cut off the very tip so that it makes a small hole, and you can decorate like a pro!  Mix colors in the plastic baggies by dropping a small amount of food coloring (or flavoring) into the bag, squeeze gently until all mixed.  Yum!!

Very tasty icing!  Not too hard, not too soft.  I used it to fill thumbprint cookies and the icing set well but did not get rock hard.  I could layer the cookies and still have soft icing.

This is a great icing recipe that we used for Christmas 07! It was easy for the kids to handle and hardened nicely (just right).  It did have to be thinned between uses but that's to be expected doing this with kids! I'm getting ready to do our holiday cookies again and am looking forward to the same great results.

This was so melt-in-your-mouth creamy. Excellent frosting. I only had enough cream to make a half batch, I sure wish I had more cream I would make more. I used salted butter, don't know if that matters. I was able to frost 16 cookies with this. It's sooooo good.

Wow, this is one of the best icing for cookies I have come across. I used it to frost The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies (recipe also found on this site) This icing dries nice and hard and really quickly too, so you can stack your cookies if you need to. The rest of the icing remains nice and soft on the inside though and the buttery taste just kept me wanting more. Delicious!

This recipe was fabulous! I have just one suggestion: I used 2% reduced fat milk instead of cream and it worked wonderfully. The icing was very light and it spreaded really well on the sugar cookies.

I thought this frosting had good flavor.  It is however hard to spread after it sits for a short while.

Great recipe, but for more flavor, I always use almond extract instead of vanilla - just like my grandma makes! Goes great with the "Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" recipe from this site. Using a stand mixer, if you have one, makes this recipe a simple task.

I am sorry but this did not work for me 3 hours before our family Christmas Eve party.  It was thick, and did not stick to the cookies.  Then the sprinkles did not stay on.  I may try again and use less sugar, more liquid. It does set up and tastes great.

This turned out to be a pretty good icing recipe. To make preparation quicker, I simply melted the butter in the microwave (30 sec) instead of on the stove and then added it to the cream. The only downside was that the frosting did not thicken as much as I thought it would, so I just refrigerated it for 30 minutes. If you want really thick icing, add 4 oz. of cream cheese. I iced cookies with this by spooning it into a ziploc bag and snipping one corner - instant piping bag!

i think this is the nicest icing i have tried!!! it is a bit more labor intensive than most but well worth the extra effort. the flavor is scrumptious and a perfect addition to any cookie you plan to frost.

This was a delicious frosting and really easy to make.  It also hardens really nicely to stack cookies.  The frosting didn't go on really smoothly though, it looked a little rough like others have said.

Today was my first time ever making/frosting cut-out cookies.  This is the frosting I chose.  Although I've never done it before, I can't believe that this is how its supposed to be... the frosting was not very easy to spread and dried pasty-looking.  NEVERTHELESS, this frosting has a GREAT taste... not so sweet, quite buttery.  I make cakes and I will definitely make this frosting to go on a cake ... but not on cookies!!!

Simply outstanding.  I used this recipe to frost my X-mas cut-outs and LOVED the results.  Tastes wonderful; dries nicely; and with the help of my trusty microwave, prep. time was only about 3 or 4 minutes.

This icing was SO GOOD!  We used it on gingerbread and sugar cookies.  The icing was too thick at first to pass through the piping bags so I poured it all out, added the tiniest bit more of cream (like a few drops at a time), stirred it up it was perfect.  It doesn't dry as fast as royal icing (but we weren't constructing houses and it tastes way better than royal icing), took a few hours to really firm up enough to put cookies on top of each other to store.  The icing was super tasty.  This one is a keeper for sure.

Perfect for icing sugar cookies!  Suggest melting the cream and butter in a glass bowl above a pan of simmering water. Then, when ready to frost, keep the bowl above the  pan of warm water (off the heat) to keep the icing smooth.

Very good. 2 1/2 batches made enough for about 10 dozen cutouts. It does thicken up a lot as it sits so I just stirred it once in awhile. Will definitely make again.

I stuck to the recipe only I didn’t bother whipping it a mixer. I just used a whisk in a heavy sauce pan.. I used this with a palette knife to glaze a very delicate cookie. I actually kept my icing on the stove, on low, to keep it a bit runny for a thinner glaze effect.

This is a very forgiving recipe.  I didn’t realize I hadn’t read the directions until I scrolled to the “I made it” button and noticed I was supposed to have melted the butter.  Oops.

Always use heavy creme instead of milk. Always use 1/2 cup butter which is 1 stick. I do use the tsp of vanilla and sometimes tsp of butter flavoring. Everyone always asks about my frosting.

The flavor is good especially compared to Royal Icing. The consistency was quite drippy and we had trouble timing our decorations. I made it twice and both times it took a long time to cool enough to not be drippy, and it took a long time to dry.

This turned out just like it was supposed to and was easy but it's time sensitive. It hardened in the piping bags after about an hour. Normally I guess that's not too bad but I used it for a big cookie decorating party. I didn't try microwaving the bags bc of the metal tips so that may have helped.

We made a double batch and separated it into separate bowls and added food coloring to make fun colors for  Chrismas cookies using the "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" recipes by Jill Saunders.  The combination rated 5 stars!  Very easy to make.

As we were working, I found I could quickly microwave the frosting to soften it back up while frosting about four dozen cookies.

I made this for our gingerbread cookies. We didn't want the hard icing. This one is goes on soft but then hardens slightly on the outside so that it is good for wrapping up and storing too. Yummy taste and easy to work with.

This frosting was perfect for a giant chocolate chip cookie :) I made half the recipe to use on two 9-inch giant cookies and It was just enough for a very simple border decor, using a tip and not placing the "stars" one next to the other.  The flavor and consistency are perfect, thanks!

Great frosting. Very spreadable, but dries and gets hard enough to stack the cookies, but still soft to bite into. I added a drop of peppermint and green food coloring for something special, but the frosting tasted great before I added the peppermint too!

Great cookie icing - the kids had a lot of fun decorating with it (unlike shiny icings that may look great, but dry far too quickly)  However, this recipe does NOT make 2 1/2 cups of icing.  I increased the recipe by 50% (i.e. 3 cups of confectioners sugar, 6 TBS of butter, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, 3 3/4 TBS of cream...) and I measured the finished icing at 1 1/4 cups of icing.  If you actually need 2 1/2 cups of icing, you'll definitely need to increase your measurements.

Used this to frost our Christmas cookies.  replaced the buttermilk with regular milk.  don't make too far ahead of time.  If you are piping place in piping bag and keep warm.  We put in the microwave at a low power until they got warm and it worked very well.  Stayed great and had many compliments on the cookies, the icing being one of the best parts.

As others have said, this dried WAY too quickly.  I ended up thinning it out with more cream and using it as a glaze.  I don't know how others say that they have been able to "pipe" this from a bag.  It did have good flavor though.  Will not be making again :/

This is the best cookie icing I've used. It tastes really good, and it dries quickly. The only challenge is that it has to be just the right temperature to work with the decorator bag. If it's too hot, it's runny, but if it cools too much, it's like playdough that won't stick to the cookie.

We just used this yesterday to decorate some sugar cookies to give out as gifts. It is very sweet so use it sparingly as other users have said. Not the kind of icing to coat an entire cookie, but tastes great piped around edges and such.

Perfect!! I used this to decorate my Christmas cookies. It was easy to pipe and set up quickly and just firm enough not to get messed up when stacking. I used liquid red food coloring for a really rich color - beware that it changes the texture a little. But it still set up just fine! The gel coloring for other colors didn't affect it at all. Definitely a keeper!!!

The flavor was good, but the icing started to harden almost immediately.  It made it next to impossible to "frost" the cookies.  I added a bit more cream to each bowl, and that thinned it a bit.  In a pinch, I might use this again but I will likely continue my search for an icing recipe.

I had a problem with timing on this icing it gets hard pretty quick. not that big of a deal if you just mix fast and keep it moving it stays plyable.  but not an easy icind if your decorating the sugar cookies.

It might just be, but I followed the recipe exactly yet I found the icing to be very difficult to work with.  It hardened quickly and was difficult to spread.  I had to put it on a double boiler and add water to it to get it to spread at all.  It ended up being a real pain.

Perfect icing for everything. I have used it on cookies as well as on cupcake and cakes, it tastes great and easy to decorate with. I made a change for the kiddies, I kept it on the heat for almost a minute longer while I stirred with a wooden spoon, the icing became quite firm. The kiddies moulded the icing with their hands and pressing it onto the cookies, the result was fabulous:)

This wasn't the kind of frosting I thought it would be.  I beat this frosting for at least 10 minutes and it never did get thick and creamy like the recipe said it would, so I added more powdered sugar and ended up ruining more than 3 cups of powdered sugar and the rest of the ingredients.

I really wanted this to be my new wonderful icing but I think I'll keep looking... I wanted it to be more flavorful and easier to use. I ended up having to add a lot of milk in order for my kids to use it and maybe that diluted the flavor. Once the milk was added it was much easier to use for decorating our Christmas cut-out cookies. It took on the color well and the kids gave it 5 stars.

My girls made this while I was away.  She said that it did get hard fast and was hard to spread... that she had to work fast but she added some milk and it worked fine after that.   I really liked the taste and the look of the icing.

This is one of those recipes that makes you wonder why you ever bought icing from the store.  I needed frosting for miniature brownie cupcakes that I made for a party at my daughter's school tomorrow.  I made this in about 3 minutes, tinted it, and piped it onto the brownie bites.  My husband was stealing bites of the frosting straight from the bowl - it's that good.  What makes it so great - is that it is so easy.  I will never buy canned frosting again.  This tastes better and doesn't have a bunch of artificial ingredients in it.  It was the perfect piping consitency and went onto the bites very smoothly.  Thanks!

Perfect cookie icing! Followed the easy directions except I didn't have cream so I used 1% milk and it turned out great!  Dried hard on the surface but remained creamy inside.  I even tried it with almond extract on some butter cookies and my family went nuts!

Very delicious ice cream!  It seemed very thin while I was mixing it, but it did thicken up and was great on the sugar cookies I made.  I added some food coloring for a more festive coloring.  Highly recommend making this icing!

i did everything the recipe said to do. i did use 2% after having seen the other review stating skim worked fine. i don't know if that was the issue, but mine was very runny. i will buy cream and try that. i really wanted mine to look like the picture :(

Perfect!  I spent almost an hour searching the web for an icing recipe for cookies that would be firm enough to send with my son to school.  Every one I've tried in the past was either tasty, but soft and messy, or rock hard with flavors that were mediocre at best.  This icing was quick, easy, delicious, and firm enough to stack within an hour, but still tender to the bite.  Exactly what I was looking for!  I substituted french vanilla coffee creamer for the cream, otherwise followed the recipe.  (Try White Velvet Cut-Outs with this icing...it's by far the best cut-out cookie I've ever had.)

This icing tasted great!  It was perfect on cut out sugar cookies.  It was so nice to able to stack the cookies to transport and the icing stayed put and the cookies did not stick together.  I made no changes and did find that you had to work quickly or it would dry out and be hard to spread.

I love this icing because it is so easy to make and it stays nice and soft on the inside while hardening enough to stack the cookies. I used it to ice the Nauvoo Gingerbread Cookies from this site. As some have pointed out, the icing is not totally white because of the vanilla, but it is not an unpleasant color. It looked perfect with the dark gingerbread cookies.

This is a great recipe just like my mom always made.  She didn't cook it on the stove though and just added melted butter to the mix.  It's easy to work with and tasty.  I much prefer this to icing made with creamed butter. Delicious!

Awesome!  I loved it - I followed the recipe exactly (well I may have used a good healthy 4 tablesoons of butter; but other than that I didn't change a thing.  I used this with my gingerbread cookies.  I put it in a baggy and cut a tiny hole in the corner and decorated that way -- very nice!

I made this recipe to go with the Best Rolled Out Sugar Cookies...I doubled the recipe to cover all the cookies that were made in that batch. It made the perfect cookie. At the party that I brought these to they were the first to disappear.

Very easy and delicious frosting.  I used it to frost the "easy sugar cookies".

I should have listened to one person who said it wouldn't stick to the cookies.  I had the same problem.  I just finished making these for my daughters christmas party tomorrow at her school.  It took forever just to do one cookie, and I had twenty four to do!  I had to heavily dip the icing in water, and even then it was almost impossible to finish.  As for taste, it's okay but really sweet.

This recipe does taste good but it was impossible to spread and didn't stick to the cookies.  It had more of a dough-like consistancy than what I was expecting.

Good - a little high on the sweet side for me. I would like to taste less confectioners sugar.

This is the very best icing there is for cut out cookies.  The frosting is easy to spread but then it hardens up to stay on the cookie and the best part is that it tastes delicious.  I made Georgie Bowers Soft Christmas Cookie recipe and used this icing recipe and my cut out cookies were delicious and so easy to make.  Definitely 5 stars.

Delicious. I used 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp almond extract. It was the perfect consistency. Thanks!

Good. It hardens quite well. However I had to use more cream so I coud get it thin enough for my son to spread on cookies.

Good stuff!  Excellent for cookies and I used it on a single pan cake.  I would not recommend it for two layer cake as it does harden a bit, but I loved it on my 'leave it in the pan' single layer cake.  It was like a fudge icing when I added some Ovaltine to 'chocolate' it up a bit (I was out of cocoa)!
