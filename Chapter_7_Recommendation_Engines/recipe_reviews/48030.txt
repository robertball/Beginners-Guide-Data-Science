This is my (extremely picky) 6 year olds favorite way to eat chicken.  The rest of the family enjoyed it also.

I couldn't believe how quick and easy this was! And it tastes like you got it at a restaurant! I didn't have onion salt, so I used celery salt and added minced onion.  I also added some freshly ground black pepper.  And ALWAYS use freshly grated parmesan cheese. Wow, what a difference!

This is a great basic recipe, which i altered a bit. I use a 16 oz tub of sour cream and mixed it with 1 cup of fancy shredded parmesan. I cooked up a batch of egg noodles and mixed it with the sour cream mixture and cubed cooked chicken. Popped it in the oven for 30 minutes on 300 degrees and it was fantastic.

I thought it was pretty good, but my roommate didn't like it much.  Very quick and easy though.
