READ THIS BEFORE MAKING IT....  I took advice from other reviews and mine turned out really good.  I sauteed the chicken in a little butter and added diced onions and two cloves of garlic to the chicken while cooking to it.  I also added some onion powder, salt and pepper.  I used the amount of soup called for, but doubled the amount of stuffing and it paid off big time.  Be sure to bake it uncovered so the stuffing isn't soggy.  This was really good and I'll definitely make it again.  My kids loved it too.

The "can" of milk they are asking for in the recipe is just whatever milk you want to use, measured by the soup can! Not "canned milk", like some of these other reviewers were confused about. I hope I helped someone out!

I made a couple of slight changes some might find helpful- I added some onion and garlic powder to the chicken while it was boiling to help add some flavor. I bought a can of low sodium chicken broth instead of using my own reserves as well. I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of mushroom. I mixed ALL of the ingredients together (chicken, soups, stuffing, and some extra onion and garlic powder) and apread into baking dish. I put a layer of stuffing I set aside on the top of the mixture so it would have a crispier topping. I also used Pepperidge Farms Seasoned Stuffing Mix, it came out great. I realize I made quite a few alterations, but it came out tasting absolutely wonderful. Thanks for the start!

The best chicken-and-dressing recipe I've ever eaten! Usually they're too salty or too gloppy, but this was perfect. I too made a few changes: 1) I used one 12-oz. box Mrs. Cubbison's cornbread stuffing (both bags) with 1-1/2 c broth. 2) While the chicken boiled (20 min. was plenty), I sauteed 1 c. chopped onion, 1 c. chopped celery, and 1 c. peeled, chopped apple in 4 T. butter, then mixed it into the stuffing mixture. I baked the casserole in a 9x13 pan (20 min. covered, 15 minutes uncovered). We could NOT stop eating this!

This was really good and pretty easy.  I made a couple of changes, per others' suggestions: 1) used TWO 6 oz pkgs of stuffing with 1.5 cups of chicken broth (I thought the cornbread stuffing was really good); 2) sauted garlic, 1/2 chopped onion, and celery in butter first, then mixed it in with the stuffing mixture; 3) added onion powder, sage, and rosemary to the stuffing mixture. My only problem was that I bought a rotisserie chicken, already cooked, from our store and that wasn't quite enough chicken for this dish. However it saved a bunch of time!  Next time I will add more chicken. These amounts were perfect for a 9x13 dish.  I cooked mine for 35 minutes total uncovered and it turned out wonderful!  With these changes this is an excellent recipe!!!

Delish! I sauteed about 1/3 c chopped onion and 2 stalks of chopped celery in 4 T butter til translucent and tender and then added that plus about 1 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning to the chicken broth. I only made a 8x8 pan of this, but if I had made a larger pan, I would recomend doubling the stuffing mix. I used only 2 large breasts since I was making a smaller dish and the ratio of chicken to dressing was perfect. I covered this with aluminum foil and cooked for 30 minutes and then removed the foil for the last 15 minutes of baking since some reviewers said it dried out. This is a great comfort food meal. Really simple and quite tasty.

Easy and tasty. We enjoyed this dish. The baking time needed was 35 minutes (the recipe asked for 45 min.).

This is like a pot pie with a stuffing crust.  When boiling the chicken, I added a stalk of celery, a couple baby carrots, a few peppercorns, some minced garlic, and a chicken boullion cube because I wanted it to be more "brothy".  Plus, the recipe ingredients  should state 1 1/2 cups of "reserved" chicken broth as well as stating "to add the reserved broth" (common sense told me to add it) because it really isn't clear.  I also added 1/2 bag of frozen mixed veges to the soup/milk mixture.  The kids loved it.  Thanks Creter.

Sooo good!  I added cracked black pepper & a bay leaf to the chicken stock.  I also sauteed one chopped onion & 2 stalks chopped celery in 2 Tbsp. of butter to add to the dressing mixture.  Also added some white pepper & rubbed sage to dressing.

I used a 16oz pkg of Pepperidge Farm stuffing and mixed it with a stick of melted margarine.  Instead of Cream of Celery soup I used a can of Cream of Mushroom along with the can of Cream of Chicken.  I omitted the milk and added 1 1/2 cans of broth that was measured in the soup cans.  I then placed 1/2 the stuffing/margerine mixture and placed it in a casserole dish that was sprayed with cooking spray.  I then poured about 1/2 the soup/broth mixture over the stuffing, placed chicken over that and then poured remaining soup/broth over the chicken.  I then spread remaining stuffing over that and baked.  Yum!!

This is a delicious and easy to prepare comfort dish.  Add a side of cranberry and you have Thanksgiving (almost) year round!  If you want to go the extra yard as other reviewers have mentioned, adding some sauted celery and onion, a couple handfuls of frozen peas or broccoli, a bit of sage or poultry seasoning certainly gives a bit more "homemade" taste and appearance. I did do as others suggested and added the second package of stuffing mix ... it made for a more "dressing" like dish and cut well into squares for freezing leftovers.  With or without the additions, you'll be pleased come dinnertime!  :O)

I followed this recipe exactly, and it was excellent.  My husband loved it.  I will definately make this recipe again.  However, I will probably add some vegetables to it next time i make it. Don't get confused by the can of milk this recipe calls for.  You will fill up one of the empty soup cans with milk...don't use evaporated milk.

I used two pounds of boneless chicken instead of 3, and two cans of cream of chicken soup - I didn't have celery.  One can of soup would have been enough for two pounds of meat.  I also used a smaller, deeper baking dish so the amount of stuffing was perfect.  I also added plenty of seasoning and chicken granules to the boiling water, and added diced onion to the chicken stove-top stuffing.  With all the seasoning, the taste was great - delicious.  This would also an excellent use of leftover turkey and homemade stuffing.  Served green beans and cranberry sauce on the side.

I had to change this up to save time and add flavor to the dressing. I used a rotisserie chicken to speed up the time to prepare the recipe. With all of the sodium from the soup I used sodium free chicken broth. The boxed dressing had no flavor. I added a spoon of finely minced onion, some poultry seasoning, some ripped up white bread, and a little whipped butter and a tad extra broth. It tasted more flavorful and little closer to a quick version of real cornbread dressing. I baked it for about 10 minutes less so that it did not dry out. It made for a quick and easy meal tonight.

I did exactly what the recipe said and it didn't come out right... Came out real soupy so maybe my oven temp is off? Anyhow, I added rice to soak up the mixture and it's ok.

My husband and son really liked this recipe. It was quick and easy and I served it with white rice and green beans.  I added chopped celery and onion to the bouillon when cooking the chicken and only parboiled for 20 minutes (that is all you need!). I filled the can with 3/4 of milk and added some of the bouillon with plenty of celery and onion to it.  Also when mixing the stuffing (I only had the herb seasoning stuffing on hand and used more than the recipe calls for) I added the chopped celery and onion and added poultry seasoning like I do real stuffing.  It came out fanstatic, had alot of flavor and the chicken was moist.  I will definately make this again.

I thought this recipe was pretty good. I read the other reviews before making it and I used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups. I think that it would probably be best to follow instructions and use the cream of celery soup with this recipe. I honestly think it would taste a lot better. I guess it depends on your taste, but I'm sure it will good either way.

I added some celery, carrots and onions because that's the way I like these type of dishes. That being said this came out great. It is one of those things that I crave from time to time so I make it a few times a year. It is quick and easy and delicious. What more could you ask for??

This is an excellent recipe.  I too followed others advice and used double the amount of stuffing.  I didn't change any other ingredients but I did mix everything together in stead of layering and found that the dish turned out beautifully!  Delicious!

Tasty and easy! But the prep-time is definitely longer than the recipe states, considering you need to boil the chicken first. It also needs just a bit of salt. Very good!

This is good for a quick weeknight meal..nothing too spectacular although it was comforting. Add some cranberry sauce to jazz it up. I added poultry seasoning, onions, garlic powder, salt/pepper to the chicken while cooking.

Really yummy! I added sauteed onions and celery to the stuffing (I used a 10 oz. box). I also added some cooked broccoli to the chicken before I covered it with the soups. Some of the stuffing was mushy and some was crunchy--just how I like it. :)

Ok, but WAY too soupy!  Next time, I'd cut the soup and milk amt. in half.  Don't know why this is getting rave reviews...just a decent, plain, easy to make casserole.

This was a really good go-to recipe. I have a very picky family and my husband has to approve the list of ingredients before he will try anything new. I didn't change a thing and everybody liked it! This will make its way into my regular dinner cycle.

I think this is a good starting recipe. The only variation I made from original recipe was to add veggies to the soup mix. I did not care for the flavor of the soup mix, I think it may have been the cream of celery. I think I would make this again only I will use either cream of broccoli or broccoli cheese soup and add broccoli pieces.

This was super easy. I open a 2-3 lb. package of frozen boneless, skinless chicken thighs, pop the block of it in a 2 quart baking dish with a lid into a 400 degree oven for about 30 minutes. The chicken cooks in its own juices and is very tender. Then I just cut it into bite size pieces and use the liquid from the chicken for the broth.  I've found this to be a great step and timesaver! And the family loves this dish. I never have any leftovers.

My whole family LOVED this recipe and begged me to make it again. On the other hand, I wasn't too impressed. It was very simple to make and very simple in taste.

Very good. Similar in taste to a recipe my mom makes with her leftover turkey around Thanksgiving and Christmas. I used herb stuffing mix instead and a little more of it. I also sprinkled a little melted butter over it. Finally, I took the advice about adding some veggies in w/ the soup mixture - added some chopped celery, chopped carrots, a can of drained mushrooms and some thawed peas. Although I think my mom's recipe is better, this was still pretty good.

My sister and i have been making almost this exact recipe for years.  You can add a 1/4or 1/2 cup of mayonaise to the recipe,put all the stuffing on bottom. If you have the time you can dice celery instead of the canned soup, i have done both.  When it is just about done cover the top with cheddar cheese.(you can also try adding diced onions!!!)UMMMM see if you can guess what we are having on Thanksgiving!!

I used 2 rotisserie chickens from the store to save some time. Used cream of chicken and herb soup and cream of mushroom soup. I also did one cornbread stuffing mix and one chicken stuffing mix (I wanted more of the dressing on top).

I don't understand how this recipe gets such good reviews. I took other reviewers recommendations and doubled the stuffing but left everything else the same. Mine came out very dry and crumbly and I even covered it for half the cook time to help prevent this. I guess I should have doubled the broth also but since many complained of it being too soupy as written ,I thought it would be ok. Other than the dryness, it was also VERY bland. I recommend adding extra seasoning and veggies for flavor. My other complaint is that the "gravy" was milky white after it cooked. It just looked like chicken cooked in milk and was very unappealing in appearance. Sorry but I can't recommend this one.

okay, I messed this up quite a bit, and it is still yummy!  First of all, I used left over rotisserie chicken, probably about 2 cups.  Then I made my own dressing b/c I had a couple of loaves of ciabiatta bread getting stale, so I sauteed an onion 3 stalks of celery, a garlic clove, a carrot and a bunch of sliced mushrooms, added a bunch of sage and mixed it in with the bread.  I only had cr of mushroom soup, so I used 2 of those. Then I forgot that was supposed to go directly over the chicken and already had 1/2 if the dressing in the pan. So I poured in the mixture, and put the rest of the dressing on top.  Since I used what I had on hand, I ended up with a whole lot more dressing than chicken.....wait, did I mention theleftover peas?  They were in the fridge, so what the heck, I put those on top of the chicken before the soup and stuffing.  Anyway, yum!  Seemed to be the best of pot pie and chicken and dressing. I left uncovered to get the top crunchy, but you could easily cover for a moister dressing.  Try this recipe, I promise even if you mess it up, it will be great! Thanks Creter!

Absolutely great! I always alter things a bit when I cook, and with this one, I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt, seasoning salt, Montreal chicken seasoning and some tenderizer. I used a can of evaporated milk (even though I could have used regular) and it made the mixture creamier when it was done. I also put chopped onion in it. Recipe was great!

I've made this recipe a couple of times now.  Both times I used the same amount of soups with 2 boxes of stuffing and it turned out fine.  The first time I made this with mushroom soup instead of chicken because that is what I had.  Everybody loved it.  The second time I used chicken soup and they ate it but didn't like it as much so I am now using it with the mushroom soup instead.

After making a few changes this turned out very good. Like the others, I used half the soup because using all would be way too much. Also, while the chicken was boiling I added about a quarter cup of diced onion, 2 Tbl. of butter and 1 tsp sage to the boiling chicken. Using that broth to add to the dry dressing. I will be making this again because it's a great winter comfort dish. We had mixed veggies on the side and I think next time I will just add them and make this like a chicken pot pie since they went so well together.

I really enjoyed this. It's good easy comfort food. I did reduce the soup to one can cream of chicken and added some celery and onion to the water when boiling the chicken. After the chicken was done, I strained the veggies out of the stock and added them to the stuffing along with a teaspoon of chicken boullion added to the stock used to mix with the stuffing.

I tried this recipe tonight, mainly because I had chicken breast and left over Mexican cornbread.  I read the reviews so I made a couple of changes to the original recipe.  Also because I'm not a big soup in casserole kind of person as I always think all casseroles with soup seem to taste alike,no matter what the ingredients,I used cream of chicken and cream of asparagus.  The reviews indicated the dish needed some extra flavor and I'm not a big fan of mushrooms in dressing.  I also used 2 stalks of celery when cooking the chicken to improve the stock taste.  I used left over Mexican cornbread, which has flavor instead of bread crumbs, but all in all this dish was still a little bland.  Other than that it works well.  My husband liked it. I think next time I would reduce to one can of soup and make the dressing close to the consistency a little drier than normal Thanksgiving dressing.  I did not particularly think that vegetables would add to the casserole, but I served with cranberry sauce and that helped.  Green Beans as a side dish was also a good choice.  I wish I had made a sweet potatoe dish as well.  I'll try again, with the above mentioned changes and use the exact recipe less one can of soup.

Are you really restricted for time and would like a nice simple recipe at the end of the day?  This was absolutely wonderful.  For a full time worker who doesn't have a lot of time, you will appreciate the simplicity of this dish, while still having the comfort and taste of a home made meal.  No altering needed.  Those who alter have too much time on their hands!!!!  Wonderful dish!!!!  Thanks a ton!!!!

Wonderful!  The only thing I changed was the boxed stuffing mix...I am not a fan at all of Stove Top.  I prefer homemade stuffing.  There is a *wonderful* recipe for stuffing that is easy and delicious called Really Easy Bread Stuffing...you can find it on this site.  The stuffing on top of this makes it a wonderful and filling dish!

I used breast tenders in this (less cutting, more tender and thin to soak up flavor.) and I mixed the whole list of indredients together and baked in a glass dish. Also used plain chicken stuffing, not wild about the cornbread kind. Not the prettiest dish, but everyone ate and enjoyed, and it was the easiest dinner! Will add to the "things you CAN cook while I'm at work" folder!

I love this recipe. My fiance and I make it very often - with chicken or turkey. They both taste great. We also like to mix up what "cream of " soups we use. Some of the different varieties we have tried are cream of brocolli, cream of brocolli and cheese, cream of asparagus, and cream of mushroom. We also like to add vegetables to it so it is a well rounded, full meal by itself. Thanks so much for this recipe.

Thanks for a old family favorite I thought I'd never recover. Have made this recipe many times and everyone enjoys it. I usually add very little milk to the soups so I've never had any trouble with it being soupy.

I loved this dish! I took advice from some of the reviews. I used 2 pounds of chicken breast (I omitted the salt), added in sauteed celery, garlic and onion, used two boxes of stuffing, and used a separate chicken stock (not the reserve). I mixed all of the ingredients together instead of layering. I will definitely make this dish again. This was a nice quick simple meal. The only part that took awhile was boiling the chicken. I was nervous at first about not adding the salt but remembered that the soup and chicken broth have plenty already.

This is a good comfort food casserole. I poached chicken breasts with onion,celery,garlic and poultry seasoning,salt & pepper. Then added fresh broccoli to the chicken,with cream of chicken and mushroom soup.  Instead of stovetop stuffing, used a 14oz bag of pepperidge farm stuffing with onions and celery,and more poultry seasoning.  I will keep this in my recipe file of great comfort food...also is easy on the budget!

Good recipe...  Would be 5 stars but had to improvise on the ingredients that I had in my pantry and followed the added tips from fellow viewers below.  I only had cream of chicken, cheddar cheese soup, boxed instant stuffing in the red box (forgot the name of the box and threw it away!) used skim milk, and leftover turkey from turkey day that I defrosted. Also used a combo of beef and chicken broth...  Did saute celery, onions with a clove of garlic and added it with the broth which was then added to the stuffing. Did bake it with the without the lid so the stuffing wouldn't be soggy. Served with this rosemary bread rolls from the pioneer woman website, oretty yummos!

I have a very picky family that isn't fond of white meat or stuffing. I substituted the chicken breast with chicken thighs and chicken flavored stuffing and it's absolutely delicous! When I first made this I followed the recipe and used the chicken breast and cornbread stuffing it was just so so. With the dark meat change it really made the difference! I prefer white meat so I was surprised just how much better it was with the dark meat. My family now requests this meal frequently!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

This was very tasty and easy.  I agree another box of stuffing needs to be added or the milk may not be necessary.  It was just a little runny, but I'll make it again.

Really good.  I did add a little more stuffing.  I did not double it though.  I also sauteed the chicken with onion and garlic instead of boiling it.  Husband loves it.  I would make this again.  Very easy.  Thanks for sharing it!

This was really good! I accidentally opened up a can of cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery and that was really good! PLUS, it's low fat! I do weight watchers and am always looking for yummy, lower calorie recipes. I was very impressed with this!!

I thought this was a great comfort food casserole, that can easily be modified to your family's tastes/needs as desired. I did an 8x8 pan using two chicken breasts, which I boiled in four cups of water with three boullion cubes and some minced dried onion (which I used for the stock in the recipe). Used the full 6 oz. of stuffing, one can of cream of chicken soup, added a can of drained cut green beans, and because I was worried about it being a bit dry, a tablespoon or so of mayonnaise (sour cream probably would have worked great too, but I didn't have any). Mixed it all up together rather than layering, baked at 350 for 35 minutes covered, 10 minutes uncovered. Yum!

I never do left-overs,but I sure did on this! I was looking for a chicken casserole that included stuffing,and this is just soooo darn good. I mixed my 2 fave kinds of stuffing for an extra mix of flavors (Stove Top Sage & Pepper Ridge Farms Herb). I added extra chicken broth to make extra moist. Turned out DELICIOUS...YOU GO AUNT JEWEL!

This is the BEST EVER! This is "HOME" for me and very close to the way my Mother prepared her chicken casserole. People always asked for it when they came to our house or when there was a special occasion or pot luck. NO matter how many time sI make it, it never tastes quite as good as hers and that "homey" country feeling that warms your tummy and heart! Happy cooking and enjoy this comfort food!

LOVE this recipe. It's comfort food. I've made it several times. The only change I make is to use regular bread stuffing rather than cornbread, as I'm not a fan of cornbread. It's in my permanent rotation.

This is tasty, simple comfort food. I did not pre-cook the chicken since it was going to bake for 45 mins and it tured out great! I did cut the recipe in 1/2 but used a whole box of stuffing. I also sprinkled the chicken with some Emeril's essence before baking. Served with baby peas. YUM!

This recipe was a HUGE hit with my family dinner. Everyone liked it, from my uncle (who usually just pours ketchup and salt all over everything I cook) to my grandmother (who doesn't always approve). I used a whole chicken already cooked from the grocery store deli to save time, and it worked just as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is wonderful.  Even my picky kids ate 2 servings.  I cubed the chicken before cooking and sauted it in some butter, garlic, and onion.  I also doubled the stuffing like suggested in other reviews.  Yummy!!!  My husband says it is definately a keeper.

Great recipe!  My 5 year old asked if I could make it again the next day!  Some other reviews said that it was soggy, but mine wasn't soggy at all--maybe they poured the soups on top of the dressing, instead of on top of the chicken???  Next time I think I'll throw in some veggies too.

I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOOD. I ONLY HAD ONE CAN OF SOUP SO I WAS WORRIED IT WAS GOING TO BE TOO DRY BUT IT WASNT. I ALSO DONT CARE FOR CORNBREAD STUFFING SO I USED CHICKEN STUFFING.

This was a big hit with my family. It's very similar to the Kraft one-dish chicken bake they feature on their stuffing boxes. I usually make that, but wanted a little variety. I ended up using 4 leg quarters I had, and added a couple boullion cubes, some rosemary, and 2 bay leaves to the water while the chicken boiled. Pulled the skin off the chicken, and the chicken off the bone, and spread it in the pan. I skipped the butter, since there was some grease in the broth. Oh, used 2 packages of stuffing mix, too. But it came out great! My family all enjoyed it (even my 3 year old cleaned her plate), and for the first time in a while, we were able to enjoy dinner at the table together. Hubby even took leftovers to work for lunch today.

I have actually been making one similar to this for a while now.  It's always a hit.  I reduce the amount of chicken a little and add cooked rice and veggies. Thanks for sharing!

This probably would have been a lot better if I had known what kind of canned milk to get, probably should have used evaporated? & will try that if I make this again. Not bad overall though.

Took a little time to prepare, but making it's own chicken broth was really nice.  This tasted great and everyone liked it.  I love dressing and might try doubling the stuffing mix next time.

I boiled 6 bone-in chicken thighs with onion. I removed the skin, used a 14 oz package of Pepperidge Farm Cornbread Stuffing Mix and added two diced boiled eggs (where that came from I don't remember).   I mixed everything together and baked 45 minutes. Easy.   Now I'm from Oklahoma and we consider gravy its own food group so I used part of the stock for the dressing and the rest to make gravy. Mix about a tablespoon cornstarch in a small amount of water.  Add to stock til the right consistency. Sprinkled in some dried parsley cause I think I looks more rustic.

I ended up sauteing the chicken first with butter, garlic and onions instead of boiling; then doubled the stuffing and also added brocolli. It was great comfort food and my little one loved it!

This was like our Nana's recipe.  I did add poultry seasoning and sautéed the onion with celery.  That was her adaptation.  We all have fond memories of this dish.

This was a HIT with the family. Very Easy to make but I too made a few alterations to the Recipe. I tweaked it to what I had on hand, but for the most part I followed it. First I did Boil the Chicken took a little longer, Cut it up placed in the bottom of Pyrex pan, in a separate bowl mixed 2 large cans of Cream of Chicken (all I had on hand) with about 1/3 of milk (1/3 measured in soup can) poured mixture over cooked chicken. Then mixed 2 boxes of stuffing (chicken, had on hand) with chicken broth, poured over top of mixture. Placed in oven for 35 (roughly) Minutes. While that was cooking I cooked Broccoli cuts and Cauliflower with a table spoon of butter and a little water until tender. Also Cooked some egg noodles. when it was done. I placed Veggie mix and Noodles on plate and spooned baked mixture on top. You could certainly put this in the oven with the other ingredients but it worked well the way I did it...Will definitely make again!

I actually found this recipe to be too runny.  And I had to double the amount of stuffing....However, I think this recipe could be great with some of the changes recommended in other reviews.

I thought this was very easy to make.  I cut the chicken before I boiled it, rather than afterwards.  This helped it to cook quicker.  The flavor was ok--it was a little bland as some other reviewers mentioned.  I will make this again, mostly because it is easy and it doesn't cost too much.

So I listened to the reviews and added an extra 6 oz. packet of stuffing to my batch and I was sorely disappointed.  The only dressing I was able to find was Stovetop and it was so salty that it completely took over the whole dish.  My husband and I agreed that biscuits or cornbread would have been a better topping.  The chicken and the soups were not the problem, the stuffing is the only qualm I had.  Next time I make it, I will not be putting stuffing on top of it.

very good. i replaced the cream of celery with cream of mushroom. i sauteed the chicken with onions, and in the last 5 minutes or so, i added a spoon of minced garlic.   i also used low sodium soups and broth.. im glad i did, because it was still a bit salty.  i baked it uncovered in the oven until the top was nice and crispy. turned out great, even the kids loved it.

Delicious! This proved to be a good staple for a quick chicken dinner with ingredients I always have on-hand. I did substitute cream of mushroom for the celery because that's what I had - and it worked great! Even my hubby, who hates cream soups, enjoyed this. Also works great with boneless pork chops!

Easy Healthy and Delish! I cooked the browned the chicken with some garlic instead of boiled and used regular (not stove top) stuffing mix which i added onions to. Next time I will use low sodium broth since it seemed a little salty with the soups.

This was quite good. I only have 3 people in my family so I used 1 lb of chicken and 1 box of Stove Top stuffing (chicken flavor). My husband who normally doesn't like anything new said it was good.

I read some of the reviews before making this and modified it as well. I added a can of mixed veggies and a can of corn. I omitted the milk. I didn't have the extra box of stuffing but HIGHLY recommend doubling this part! The whole family loved it and will be a routine meal in our home. With picky kids, definately a winner. Beats the ol' Tater tot hotdish hands down!!!

Something was missing, Kinda just average tasting, kinda bland I dunno what it was something was just missing. Also for time this took, and cost of ingredients, definitely not worth it! I have gotten comments every night on recipes I've made here, this is the first one where they ate it but no great comments, said it was ok to be nice... Chicken mixed with homemade stuffing with gravy poured on top tastes alot better then this. Will not make again.

Eh. Not much flavor if you don't jazz it up with some seasonings, or some sauteed onion and celery like others suggested. I didn't have time to mess with it, so I went with the recipe as is and it was very blah. I did use an extra package of stuffing, which it did need, but couldn't save it!

This casserole was a big hit with my family and friends. I did saute some onions and added 2 chopped boiled eggs before baking. Will add to recipe box.

I took someone else's advice and sauted the chicken (which i went ahead and cut up into small pieces) in no-salt butter, added onion and minced garlic. It came out great.

I followed other reviewers' advice and added celery onion and garlic. I also added some diced carrot and leftover red bell pepper. The casserole just insn't our thing and had we not added what we did to it I know I would be rating this recipe lower. It just doesn't sing. Too bland boring.

This was pretty good. I put it in a smaller casserole dish and added green onions, celery, and frozen peas. I definitely recommend adding vegetables, otherwise it would have been kind of blah.

Good recipe. Will definitely make again. I used only cream of chicken soup since I don't care much for cream of celery. I doubled the amount of stuffing as recommended by others, and it wasn't soggy at all.

Finally, a dish that the whole family enjoyed!  I did make a few changes. I picked up an extra box of stuffing and I'm glad I did. One box wasn't enough to cover a 13x9 dish, but two was perfect. I used two pounds of chicken tenderloins. I spooned the soup mixture over the chicken enough to cover it, but reserved the rest of the mixture to keep the casserole from being too soupy. I added canned chicken broth to the reserved soup mixture and doubled the liquid used to moisten the stuffing, since I used two boxes. All three of my kids and my husband loved it, and that doesn't happen very often!

My parents really enjoyed this. My mom and I made homemade stuffing, and used cream of mushroom, b/c that's what she had. Also added half a packet of onion soup mix. I think it would have been bland without it.

I would have given this 3 stars but my husband loved it! I thought  it was ok, not what I expected, too soupy. The only thing I did different was to use canned chicken, didn't have time for the boiling and shredding. If I make this again I will double the stuffing, half the soup, and cover it while it's cooking so the stuffing doesn't get crunchy. I guess it's just personal preference.

I guess everyone has different tastes.  I believe to rate a recipe fairly you must make it according to the directions - which I did.  This just didn't suite our tastes at all.

I did not care for this recipe at all.  My daughter "kind of liked" the sause and chicken.  I did not want to boil my chicken because I thought that would take away much of the flavor.  I instead put it on a baking sheet at 350o for 25 minutes or so, or until the juices ran clear.  But inspite of using a low sodium broth for the dressing, I thought this dish was so packed with salt from the packaged dressing and canned soup that it was almost inedible!!  I marinated the chicken for more flavor, but that was even lost in the sauce.  If you really like the flavor of canned soup--you might try this.

I thought this casserole came out very well.  Per previous reviews, I added two stalks of celery, 2 cups mushrooms, 1 jar of pimiento and 1/2 a chopped onion all of which I cooked before adding, I'd suggest doing so in a bit of the chicken broth.  I also added a 1/2 cup of mayo to the 2 cans of soup, I used only cream of chicken as I don't care for cream of celery.  This turned out well, I like my stuffing to be moist so I used more broth, in the future I might add more stuffing to the recipe.  I only had herb stuffing on hand so that is what I used.  Although I made a lot of tweaks, I'd say that this recipe was very good, and came together fairly easily.

This is an excellent easy meal that tastes delicious, my only change would be to thinly slice the boneless chicken breasts.

I was going to rate this last night and would have given it a lower score, however, I just reheated some in the microwave and it was much better. Last night, the chicken was very dry and we were choking on it. Somehow overnight, everything melded together and tastes better. The chicken isn't dry either. That said, it still is very bland even though I added garlic, black pepper, bay leafs etc. My kids were asking for fresh ground pepper after it was on their plate. They have never done that before.  Color was pretty. Served with green bean almondine.

Great recipe! I did add rosemary, onion and extra seasonings to the chicken broth, also added cooked chopped onion to the chicken on the bottom of the pan and used an extra box of stuffing.  Everyone loved it!! Keeping this recipe for sure!!

Not my family's favorite, but I thought it was great.  My son made his own chicken dinner because he won't eat "canned soup" recipes.  I used a little less chicken so I reduced the amount of milk.  I also used 2% milk and it worked fine.  Next time would add more stuffing.

This recipe is wonderful! It is quick and easy for my family-there are 4 kids!  I only added a 10 oz. bag of frozen veggies, and this made a complete meal.  This is one recipe I will be making again.

A very basic recipe. It absolutely needs some herbs added to the sauce, perhaps sage or thyme. I will only use this one again if I am in the mood to experiment. It's not terrible, but it is definately lacking.

WOW! This is a easy, tasty dish. The only thing I would recommend is to make it with reduced sodium soups - very salty dish if you use the standard soup.

Love the ideas about adding in the veggies - I'll be sure to do that next time.

I made this for my sister and fiance. They both loved it!  I added cauliflower, broccoli and carrots to the soup/milk sauce and also added about a spoon-full of sour cream and a few diced jalapeno peppers.  It came out great and I got rave reviews from everyone.  I served it with salsa and black beans...it was a hit.

We loved this recipe.  We doubled the stuffing and used chicken stuffing instead of cornmeal stuffing and just used a whole 14 ounce can of chicken broth to mix with the stuffing.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is good for a once in a while change of pace, but not spectacular enough to add to my rotation of recipes.  The flavor is good but missing something - not sure what, but I've made it a couple times, experimenting with different things, and I can't get it quite right!

Yummy!  Tastes like a leftover Thanksgiving plate with a lot less work.  I pick a rotisserie chicken instead using breasts.  It saves time, it's tasty and the dark meat makes it moist.

Loved this recipe and it was super easy.  I used Cream of Chicken with Herbs and Cream of Mushroom soups.  Also used 2 boxes of stuffing mix to top with a little over 1.5 cups of broth.  My son had two helpings so it's a keeper.

Ok this is a dish that I have made for several years and it has a lot of variations on it's ingredients. FYI @Lisa Michelle: I made this last week for dinner and used the changes you made. It was just ok for my family of 4. It was dry and the stuffing mix I used was very strong tasting of spices. It was the stuffing mix made and sold by Walmart and not one of the name brands like Stove Top. Not sure about it being dry but any suggestions would be appreciated as my family liked it enough that we would try it again. I usually make one similar using my cornbread but I like saving time especially during the week using the cornbread stuffing mix.

I made this recipe exactly as directed (used canned evaporated milk because I didn't read reviews until after, so this part of recipe was rather confusing.) 
I found the recipe very good, my husband absolutely loved it! I baked uncovered for about 40 minutes. It was not soupy at all and the dressing had a crispy crust. 
Next time,  I would probably add sautéed celery and onion and add some poultry seasoning. This is definitely a recipe I would make again.

This was so good and so easy. I used a rotisserie chicken shredded up because it's what I had on hand. Only other change I made was to add some sauteed onions/celery in butter with some Bell's Seasoning to the stuffing mix. I didn't measure how much broth I added to the stuffing, just eyeballed it. Came out so good and was even better the next day. Made plenty, we had 8 servings from a 9x13.

This was so good! I did make a few changes. I used rotisserie chicken. I also mixed the soup, milk and chicken. I added garlic and onion salt and a lot of paprika. I also added seasoned black beans. I put this on bottom of baking dish then topped with 2 boxes of Stove Top chicken stuffing to which  I added diced apples. I cooked it covered for 20 minutes and then uncovered for 15 minutes in preheated 325 oven.

Unless your baking, most recipes can be changed to your own tastes or to ingredients you have (or don't have) on hand.  This one caught my eye because mt wife loves stuffing and I had a couple of chicken breasts leftover from a previous meal.  I changed it to our own tastes, hence only the four stars.  I used only one can of cream soup (mushroom) but added sour cream for more moisture. I also added a bunch of chopped vegetables (onions, green pepper, carrots, celery) to help round out the meal as well as adding shredded cheese into the mix before baking.

Boiled 3 chicken breasts in water with chicken bouillon.  Chopped/shredded and placed into dish.  Mixed 1 can of chicken gravy and 3/4 can of milk and poured over.  Then mixed 10 ounce bag of pepperidge farm stuffing cubes with 1 3/4 cups of the reserved water and celery salt, onion powder and Monterrey chicken seasoning.  Spread over chicken.  Baked for 35 minutes.  Both husband and kids really enjoyed it.  Easy comfort food.

I always make a lot of changes to a recipe - usually using it as a framework.  I sauteed onions, and a clove of garlic in olive oil then I added raw chicken  pieces.  I cooked the mixture until outside of chicken was white; then added salt, celery seeds, and dried sage.   I put the top on the pan while I took the rest of the ingredients out of the pantry.  I used a can of Cream of Mushroom and Chicken soup but only added about 2/3 of both.  I added the cup of milk, probably 2/3 cup of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese.  I let the whole mess heat up to bubbly.  I poured the warm mess into the 9x13".  I lightly mixed about 10 oz of bread crumbs.  Just until all crumbs were moist.  Then I let the whole thing cook for about 45 min at 350, until it was browned on top.

This is the most simplest and best tasting recipe I've tried so far.  This is wonderful.  Of course I add other items to it but for the most part this is the best.

I thought this was dry and lacked in taste.  Although my kids ate it up, it needed some extra taste.  Maybe next time I'll try to add some vegetables.

Good recipe. Was a tad bit too salty for my taste, so next time I will try using lower sodium soups and broths. I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery, next time I will use golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom (too much "cream of", I think). Also used homemade stuffings instead of store bought as a personal preference. After reading a few other reviews, I decided to sauté the chicken in a skillet with a little butter and minced garlic, then diced it up and spread it across the bottom of the baking dish as per the recipe directions. Perhaps next time I will try making layers of the chicken, soups and stuffing. I also think next time I will add a little heavy cream to the can of milk to help it all thicken up a little better. My husband liked it, he had three helpings!

This is a definite fan favorite of my family's, although to me it was okay. I sauteed the chicken in chopped onion, garlic, and basil. I added additional stuffing, and used slightly more soup, and baked uncovered. It's an easy and quick recipe for when you want something hearty but needs to be done fast.

This was pretty good but not great.  I added 1/2 cup of chopped onion, 2 cloves of garlic and 2T of butter and sauteed with cooked chicken.  I used double the amount of stuffing mix and drizzled 2T of butter over stuffing.  I baked uncovered so stuffing would not get soggy.

The only alterations I made to this recipe were to increase the stuffing from 1 box to 2 boxes and I used low-fat cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery.  This was delicious! I give it only 4 stars because it was very salty. Next time I make it I'm going to try to find all lower sodium ingredients.

This was okay.  It would have been better with chicken or turkey stuffing rather than cornbread.  My husband and children really enjoyed it - but I felt that it could have been better based on the reviews it recieved.

I'd have to agree with others that said it was too salty tasting and definitely overwhelming on the soup taste.  My kids only ate the chicken.  Even my husband who loves stuffing was not a fan.  Will not be making this again.

Excellent basic recipe. Different things can be added to make this recipe special or use up leftovers. The first time I made this, I used some left -over pulled chicken and a diced up pork chop. After seeing another review, I sauteed them with about half a white onion and two cloves of garic. I used the recommended amount of soup, but added about half a loaf of left-over french bread to the stuffing mix (and doubled the chicken stock). It turned out awesome- everyone in our house loved it and fought over who would get to eat it the next day for lunch!

This is decent. I made some changes and it was pretty good. I'd add more stock if I make this again; either that, or cover it in the oven as the stuffing on top was a bit too crunchy for our tastes. Thanks!

I fixed this recipe for my husband...we both thought it was sort of boring.  I wish I would've followed the advice of a few of the other reviewers!  I'm going to try to jazz up the remaining casserole using other recipes.

This was quick and easy to throw together, but if I make it again I will add more spices. I did double the stuffing as per other reviewers' suggestions, and I agree that is necessary (but add more broth to compensate!)

I would have also doubled the stuffing.  I will do that next time.  Otherwise, delicious!

I thought this tasted like a boxed chicken casserole. I thought it was a little bland. My husband really liked it though.

I used canned chicken to save some time, but did everything else as directed. It was so quick & easy - my husband & daughter give it two thumbs up. I will be making this again soon!

I loved it, of course I added some of my own favorite seasonings, especially to the chicken. Some minced garlic and onion. My husband is not big on casseroles, although I love em. but he liked this one pretty well. I will throw this recipe in for dinner every once in a while but as often as I would l ike.thanks!

I had to scale the recipe down to feed my family of 4. I started with 3 chicken breast fillets in a pot of water with a large dash each of salt, black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. As the chicken was boiling, I sauteed half a diced yellow onion in a small amount of butter. When the chicken was done (it took about 25 minutes), I cut it up & placed it in a 3-quart casserole dish. I combined half a can of cream of chicken soup, half a can of cream of celery soup, and half a can of skim milk and poured it over the chicken chunks. I stored the remaining soup in the freezer, to be used the next time I want to make this recipe. For the stuffing mixture, I added a soup-can full of chicken broth (left over from boiling the chicken breasts) to a 6-oz package of "savory herb" Stove Top stuffing. After spreading the stuffing mixture in the casserole dish, I topped it with the sauteed onions and baked in a preheated oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. I served it with a side of corn and a green salad.

My family liked this dish, but it tastes exactly like what it is: boiled chicken and boxed stuffing. The chicken was a bit bland, even with the spices I added; I would recommend adding even more seasoning. I would also use just one can of cream of chicken soup, but sautee a couple of stalks of diced celery (along with the onion) and mix them into the stuffing. I would also shred the cooked chicken instead of cutting it into chunks.

Pretty bland for us but I will try this again and cook the chicken in a frying pan with a little butter and wine adding my favorite seasonings.  Maybe this method of cooking the chicken will add the extra flavor we are looking for.

Very good - Husband loved it.  Sauteeing some diced celery and onions (maybe half a cup of each) and adding that to the stuffing made it seem a little more fancy, but all in all -- we will have this again sometime.

So easy to make and really good.  I used lowfat soups and added one extra can of lowfat chicken soup for a little more moisture.  I made a little gravy to serve on the top if desired.

As suggested by some other reviewers, I also added some seasonings to the chicken when cooking so I could have some chicken stock for other recipes.

I've tried this with the cornbread and regular stuffing and the cornbread stuffing just "kicks it up a notch".

Good recipe; family loved it.  Seemed a little "one-dimensional," though.  Would add both a can of waterchestnuts and small can of mushroom.  A couple of TBSP of pimento wouldn't hurt, either, for some color and pizazz.

I found this recipe to be very easy.  The directions were perfect and my family really enjoyed the meal.  I added some onions and mushrooms cooked in butter on top of the chicken.

Call me stupid, but I made this from memory. I did pretty good too. I did NOT boil the chicken though. I put chicken stips on the bottom of the pan. I used a little heat to blend the two soups and milk together(2%). I used "canned" chicken broth to make the stuffng. Worst thing I did. Still it all tasted great. Wished I had made more stuffing though. 4 meals. Easy to fix and tasty too. That gets 5 stars from my point of view.

This recipe was pretty good.  My fella was very impressed with it.  I definitely liked it, but after getting about halfway through my serving, I agree with some of the previous reviewers that it is rather salty.  I'd use reduced or no salt items to cut the overly salty flavor.  Still, I give it a 4 overall for a rather good taste and ease of making.
