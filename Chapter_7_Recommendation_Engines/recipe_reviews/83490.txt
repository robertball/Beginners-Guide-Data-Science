This was pretty good.  I cheated a bit by using just a little bit of bleu cheese salad dressing with the cole slaw mix instead of the cole slaw dressing and bleu cheese.  If you chill it very well it's not as messy.  Made for a nice, portable lunch

I love making these they are easy and very tasty!  I just use regular slaw mix if I cannot find the Red, White and Blue.  I also add a little bit of cheddar cheese to the final product and drizzel with Ranch or Blue Cheese depending on the person I am serving them too.  On the chicken I add garlic, salt, pepper, and a little cajun season to give it a little bit more kick!  Very messy and very good serve with a salad and you have a complete meal.  The chicken is also awesome the next day be warned it will be a little bit spicer the next day!  Great Recipe!

We Serve a version of this in my restaurant. Next time try it with a Cheddar-Jalapeno wrap. Use romaine lettuce instead of slaw and bleu cheese. One question..Can a wrap be a sandwich?? They are two different things!

Easy and delicious! I had made the Red, White and Blue Slaw one other time and loved it. Would have never thought to put it in a wrap, but the crunchiness was excellent. I used Jalapeno Cheddar Wraps and they were very good! I personally prefer a buffalo chicken wrap with lettuce, cheese and ranch.

We enjoyed these very much.  I sauteed chicken breast in a little butter and then doused it with Louisiana Hot sauce.  Loved the slaw; perfect way to get our veggies with this dish.  Will make again!
