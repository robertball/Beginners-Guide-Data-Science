3.29.18  I used the bacon that I had on hand, and I was a bit short of what was called for in the recipe.  I wasn’t too concerned because I thought the recipe had too much bacon anyway.  I was wrong, it isn’t too much bacon, YOU NEED IT ALL!  I wasn’t sure the first batch of cookies were cooked enough, so I baked for 15 minutes; my mistake, they were overdone.  I took the next batch out of the oven at exactly 12 minutes, and I had soft, tender, perfectly cooked cookies.  An unusual combination of ingredients for cookies for sure, but it works.  I’ve had this recipe saved for a long time, and I’m glad I finally got around to making it.  Krissy, thanks for sharing your recipe, I liked it.

What is not to like about chocolate, peanut butter and bacon?  I made the bacon in the oven as I am way too lazy to fry it in the pan.  Mixture is quite thick so trying to stir in the peanut butter was a tad challenging.  Used a scoop to drop onto the sheet and voila world of happiness.  We loved them and will make more.

As is, they were alright. The bacon added little to the finished product. The dough was very thick, which made it difficult to mix in the peanut butter cups and bacon. For my taste, it was a little heavy on the cocoa and probably contributed to the lack of bacon flavor. Could probably use a little salt and something to make it more moist.

I made these exactly as the recipe says, I didn't get a salty sweet taste. Honestly, I think the bacon adds nothing except more calories and a weird chewy texture. I might make these again without the bacon. The cookies was pretty good before I added bacon.

I mixed up all of the ingredients just as the recipe instructed and I finished with a bowl of chocolate powder! After looking at various other recipes, I added another stick of butter, it connected all of the ingredients, but they're more like fudge than cookies

I made the recipe exactly as written.  Didn’t taste the bacon.  The cookie  batter was very thick and the cookie dry.  For the added time cooking and  choppingof the bacon as well as time pealing the paper off all of the the peanut butter cups and chopping them as well, I was expecting something wonderful.  I was so disappointed.

They are Delicious!!  I didn't make any changes.  The dough does get REALLY thick, but I mixed everything in.  I am glad I am bringing them somewhere or else I might eat them all!

I would add Sour cream nest time for moistness.
