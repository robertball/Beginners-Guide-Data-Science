I would reduce oil by half & add 2-3 Tbs. sesame oil, to improve flavor. Reduce salt or use reduced sodium soy sauce. Would make again with changes.

This recipe is tasty; very satisfying for people who do not want spicy hot chicken wings that trigger acid indigestion. Recipe is very good as it is. One addition I recommend is putting the pan of wings in the broiler for 10 minutes after baking, for added/necessary crispness.

I made this recipe exactly as stated.  It was a disappointment since it ended up with no flavor, and the expensive sesame seeds were completely lost.  My husband, who wanted Wings without them being "Hot" didn't like them, and he usually loves anything with Soy Sauce and Sesame seeds.
