I found that it had a nice taste but thought that it was a bit odd to put a breaded scallopini in sauce! I tried it and the breading did fall off the veal a bit.

We think this is absolutely delicious!  I have made it twice now, the first time almost exactly to a T, the second time I made some minor adjustments.  I added some oregano to the bread crumbs and skipped dipping the cutlets in egg.  I simply pressed them into the crumb mixture.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used some homemade marinara, but still added it to the sauteed peppers and onion.  The red pepper just gives this such a delightful flavor, my son says he  could drink the sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe.

We had this recipe for supper tonight. The plates were cleaned up :) 
I modified it a bit. Since I didn't have stewed tomatoes, I used fresh cubed tomato and saut√©ed it with the onion & bell pepper. Then I added a bit of red wine and 2 tbsps of tomato paste.
I paired it with KitchenAid mashed potatoes, pouring melted butter & warm milk slowly while the machine's working.
Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe.

I made Veal cutlets, added mushrooms and some Brazilian spices with some Capellini pasta. I could've pounded the Veal more to make it more tender than it turned out. Overall though, very good recipe! Leftovers for days.

There is a few things wrong with this recipe.  For one thing I would have really liked for this to have a crispy crust and not a soggy wet one.  Also the veal was super dry...AND last this was super sweet and off putting maybe a pinch of sugar, or none at all...I just really didn't care for much in this recipe.

It was very good, but like others, it is a little sweet for my taste, so I will cut the sugar in half next time. It was also very soupy. Next time I will cut the water in half or more, or leave the lid off while simmering.

I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and added a couple of tbsps of tomato paste. I also subbed vegetable broth for water.

I make this dish often. I 3 cloves of minced garlic to the onions and peppers about 30 seconds before adding the stewed tomatoes. Topping it off with red pepper flakes sets it off.

We really enjoyed the taste and will be making this again. I only had 1lb of veal so made up the difference with some sliced mushrooms. Otherwise we followed the recipe till it came time to put the veal back into the sauce. We opted to just top the veal with the pepper sauce cause we liked the crunch of the veal. We pounded them so with the breading they cooked up and didn't need more time.  Very tasty dish.

The sauce is really delicious and the cutlets are oh-so-tender.
 I had beef cutlets on hand and used those.  My Just-4-meat tenderizer flatten them out so they were thinner.   I was out of  bread crumbs and  used flour instead.  Also, did not have red peppers on hand and used green peppers.   Next time I'll used red peppers.   I served with brown rice and a green salad.  My son told me they were really good.  I'm not a real fan of beef cutlets and just usually eat a tiny portion of one  but this sauce was so good, I ate one whole veal cutlet with the sauce.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing your family recipe.

This was tasty but still needed a zip. I will try it again using my own spices. Husband liked it but it was no 5 stars.
