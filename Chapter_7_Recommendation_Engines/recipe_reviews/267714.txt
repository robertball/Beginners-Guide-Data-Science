I added one cup of finely diced chicken. Veg was celery, carrot, and peas.
When ready, I put the whole thing in a deep dish pie shell instead of smaller samosas. Baked at 400 for 40 minutes. Spicy and delish!

I baked mine in the oven instead of frying them. Very yummy either way.

Itâ€™s an amazing recipe! I made 32 altogether and my guests were very impressed. We ate half of them and froze the other half.
