flathead cherries are a local favorite.  I am often torn as to just eating them fresh since we can only savor them maybe 2 months out of the year or buying enough at peak to freeze or preserve.  This is a great recipe for fresh, but I just tried it with some cherries I had fresh frozen.  Summer in the middle of February. GREAT!

So good!  I got my cherries from the farmers market and it didn't say the kind but they were dark and sweet.  I served it over some chicken I just had pan fried with a little S&P and garlic powder.  Perfect!  If you don't like sweet meat you won't like this....I also would say the balsamic is a must!
