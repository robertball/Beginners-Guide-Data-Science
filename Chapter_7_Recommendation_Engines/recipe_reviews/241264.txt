I reduced serving size in 1/2 because there are only 2 of us. I have to say I didn't have time too brine the chops the full time. I'm not sure if they might have been better if I had. They were easy and the apples were tender. I served with Sweet and Sour cabbage and it was a nice side with these chops. I agree with the other review that there was too much fat. I will reduce the butter and oil and try these again brining for the full recommended time. They were more tender than they would have been without the brining. That is my goal since these chops tend to be very dry. I will try them again. Thanks for sharing.

I really wanted to love this recipe, but I had to knock it down one star for the cooking method.  I followed the recipe exactly, and these are the problems I encountered.  First of all, there was far too much fat.  The fat actually kept the meat from coming in contact with the pan, so it didn't brown quickly.  A quick sear is all that is necessary, with only enough fat to keep the meat from sticking to the skillet.  Secondly, apple quarters did not have enough time in the oven to become tender.  I would recommend cutting the apple into eighths or smaller.  I'm glad there was a brine, for the pork would have been inedible without it.  Nice flavor combination--I love rosemary on most meats, and pork with apples is always a winning combination, in my book.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This turned out great and my family loved it! I thought it was easy to make and we had all of the ingredients on hand. This is how I modified the recipe: I brined the chops exactly as prescribed, but only used the butter (and about a Tbsp at a time) when browning the chops in the skillet. I probably did 2-3 min on one side and 1 min on the other. I had to break up the browning into two batches since I had about 8 chops. I threw in the apples with the second batch (along with the rosemary)to soften them up a little. Then I transferred everything to a glass baking dish and baked it all for an additional 10 min. Served the apples and pork chops with some steamed broccoli. Delish!

My husband and I are trying to reduce our salt, so I selected the ‘low sodium’ filter before searching for recipes with pork and apples.  Call me stupid, but I thought marinating in a brine for two hours and tossing it out afterward (vs salting the meat) was what defined this recipe as low sodium.  It wasn’t.  It was delicious, but the sodium percentage was really high and the salt flavor was quite prevalent.  I should have checked that before continuing with the recipe.  I topped it with an apple cider/onion glaze I had left over from another recipe on this site, and served it with boiled potatoes and steamed mixed vegetables.  Our taste buds were really happy :-).  Our hearts....not so much.

This pork chop recipe is so good and easy! 
I didn't have the 2 hrs to brine the pork but I have a Food Saver Marinator. So I used that for 15 min only! 
I also turned up the oven to 400*. And bake for 14 min.
VERY tender and juicy. About 45 min overall but worth the work!  Apples are yummy.  
I also deglazed the pan and used the liquid from oven to make a sauce with cornstarch to drizzle over chops.
This would be a good company meal! Pair with a potato of choice and veggie.
PS... I forgot the Rosemary but it was still good! I will not forget it next time as I love the flavor of Rosemary!

I made it and while it sounded good in theory, I didn’t care for the way it turned out. There is way too much oil and butter. The pork chops were juicy but they don’t end up with any color because there is so much fat in the pan. Also, the apples end up soft, mushy, and drenched in butter.  I can’t imagine this recipe working out unless you scale down the oil and butter drastically. I won’t be making it again.

Will make this again. Perfectly cooked pork. I think I was expecting more from the apples but we loved this dish.
