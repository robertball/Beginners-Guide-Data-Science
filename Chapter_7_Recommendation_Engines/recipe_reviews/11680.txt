This is good but much better with ham frozen green peas cream parmesan cheese and garlic. Also a great substitute for the ham is sliced sweet or hot Italian sausage.

I actually cooked the eggs, as the recipe says to do (on low heat so they stay soft, but are still COOKED), and the results were wonderful!  Great recipe!

Super!
A great change of pace and a good way to use up left over ham.
There was only enough left for my husband to take for lunch the next day!

This recipe had a lot of potential, but I have a few problems with it. One, echoing a previous reviewer's comments about the "essentially raw eggs", the recipe didn't specify how long the eggs actually cooked. For another, the recipe seemed to have too much ham in it (and I do like ham). Third, the whole thing was too salty for my taste, so people may want to use unsalted butter, not salt the spaghetti, etc.
I'll probably make this again, with a few minor changes.

Delicious and great flavors of garlic and 
cheese with ham and spaghetti . I did add peas and a mixture of parmesan and Romano cheese and cilantro(instead of parsley).  I will make this again!!

Yummy and quick! What more do you want??? I don't like olive so I put in a handful of sun dried tomatoes and it was great. Fab dish to do when you've had along day and want something tasty and fast on the table in less than 15 minutes. Thanks for this one. Will definitely be a regular in my house.

The first time I made this it was dry. The second time, I waited until it came off the heat to add the parmesan, plus a cup of milk.  Omitted the salt and extra butter.  It was silky and delicious.

I made this only because I wanted an easy and quick lunch recipe for my family. I'll be honest, I don't get what the eggs do to this dish but the results were good. I personally don't think this dish is "special occasion quality" as the result is just a fancier version of buttered noodles and it certainly isn't very "Italian" but we liked it well enough. I used rotini noodles, 1/2 TBLS dried parsley and used a jar of diced pimentos in place of the olives. I'd make this again when in a time crunch.

I used penne instead of spagetti and I loved it.  I also used pre-chopped ham which made the whole cook time about 15 min.  Perfect!

Wow, I certainly didn't expect so much controversy over the eggs.  The recipe absolutely does NOT say to cook them.  It says to "stir them in" slowly, and then remove from heat.  One can't assume the spaghetti is hot if it's been sitting drained for a bit, so I don't see the assumption the eggs would be cooked.  I wanted to make *sure*, so I simply let it sit on the heat a bit longer - it doesn't take long nor hurt the recipe in any way.  I also stirred it a bit or they just go the bottom and cook as pieces.  I disagree that the recipe says to cook them, but it's not such a big deal to just let them sit there a bit longer. Now, I also dumped the olives since I don't like them.  I agree with Dreginek that I'd never consider this a "special occasion" dish, but it was good and easy.  Had a curiously different taste that I wasn't sure about at first but that kind of grew on me, and I've made this twice now when I've had ham to use up.

GREAT recipe, quick and easy! I doubled the pasta, used slow fat salami and it turned out creamy and delicious! Make sure you mix the parm and cheese together then add it to the pasta.

This was very good, a good idea for something quick and different. It was a little dry so I added an extra egg the 2nd time. Doubled the garlic and added some onion fllakes which gave it more flavor. Didnt use the black olives though.

Delicious!  Our family, which includes a toddler, loved this meal.  We replaced the parsley with tarragon and used olive oil rather than butter. Yum.

This recipe was delicious and easy.  It seems like a version of Carbonara, however it was not too greasy.  I used only 2 Tb. instead of the 1/4 cup and it turned out great.  Thank you!

This was great.  I'm on a cholestrol free diet so I used eggbeaters for the eggs.  I didn't have any parsley but I did have cilantro and used that instead.  I squezed a little fresh lemon over it and it was very tasty.  I will definetly make this again.  Oh yeah, I used turkey ham which is way less salty and whole wheat thin spagetii.

This recipe was very tasty. I added a little chopped onion along with the garlic. It seemed a little dry to me and didn't want to "stick" together. I may add a cup of alfredo sauce the next time I try it. I did not have a problem with thinking the eggs were raw as the spaghetti was straight out of boiling water, the ham, garlic/onion was hot, so the eggs cooked quickly when all was tossed together over low heat. One would never know there were even eggs in the recipe. I will definitely fix this again.

This was very nice and quick to put together.  I found it to be a little dry so I added a splash of cream.  Also added a handful of frozen peas.  I had no fresh parsley so left it out rather than use dried.  I cut back on the 1/4 cup of butter as that was too much for my taste.  Will make it again for sure.

I thought this was really excellent, although I like Fettucini Carbonara better.  This reminded me of that recipe while making this one.  Make sure the cheese you use isn't too salty and I wouldn't add any salt the next time.  And there will be a next time!  Although if you are hungry, this is not 4 servings!

I think this is an awesome, easy and tasty recipe. I make it with olive oil instead of butter to cut down on the calories. I also use dried parsley instead of fresh. I saute the ham so it is slightly brown. I served this recently at a party and everyone loved it. I love olives but my husband doesn't so I have served it without the olives and it is still good.

Very good, I didn't have parsley so I used oregano.  My husband wasn't too fond of this dish, but I liked it.  I do agree with the comment on putting peas in this meal.  It probably would have made it a little healthier too.

Looks and sounds great, and might be on the weekend's menu, and lots of variants in the reviews.
But not clear if that's 8 oz dried or fresh spaghetti :(
My guess from the serving size is that it's dried.

For those of you concerned about raw eggs, try substituting egg beaters or pasteurized eggs.   And, just a quick note, commercially purchased mayo has been pasteurized, so not really a good comparison there.

Very Tasty but one question where are people gatting the 'essentialy raw eggs' bit from the recipe says no such thing it says add them over a low heat- so they are getting cooked aren't they.

Very good!  Perfect with a spinich salad.  Nice texture and flavor but definitely not for a low cholesterol diet.

This was good, and easy to make. I omitted the olives as I don't like them, and substituted cooked spinach instead.

This recipe was fine, but nothing special.  I didn't salt the pasta water and I always use unsalted butter, so it didn't turn out too salty, but I did cut down on the ham a bit and I rinsed the olives before adding them.  Finally, about "essentially raw eggs": they're fine.  They're used in Greek cooking all the time, and what do you think mayonnaise is?  You just want to make sure they're fresh.  If you're still worried, then buy organic eggs, but I grew up eating "essentially raw eggs" and it never hurt me!

Tasts excellent and is quick! I used one less egg, 1/4 cup of cream and added frozen peas. Omitted the olives. Next time I think I will try adding sliced fresh mushrooms.

Very good recipe and thought had good flavor. This recipe's flavor depends on the quality of the ingredients. After cooking the ham and garlic on low in a dutch oven, I turned down the burner to lowest setting to add the eggs, olives and cheese. I also added sone of the pasta water to help loosen the "sauce". After the pasta was finished and drained, I added pasta to sauce and turned off burner to let the residual heat cook the eggs. I also added more pasta water to make sauce to desired consistency for the sauce. I believe it can be modified with different veggies if desired. Thank you for sharing.

great use of leftover everything, but adding frozen peas helped, sliced jalepeno stuffed olives (sliced) made it even better.  I wouldn't make this a staple in my food portfolio, but it was useful to have a leftover use guide for my refrigerator reduction act

I made this for dinner last night and it was amazing! A very grown up version of Mac and cheese. I added crushed red pepper for a little heat when I sautéed the ham. I also added peas along with the olives to give it a veggie and some color. I think sautéed mushrooms would be a nice addition as well (for next time).

My husband had something similar to this at a restaurant and described it to me. This recipes sounded pretty close to what he described.  The only change I made was to add a few splashes of the pasta water to moisten it up a bit.  He declared it to be better than the one he'd loved before.

I'm only giving this recipe 3 stars because I'm not so sure the essentially raw eggs are completely safe to eat.  I have 4 children and was leary at letting them try this dish.  I personally loved it but food shouldn't make one worry so!
