Very, very good. This was the star of our dinner when everything else was kind of meh. Everyone loved it. I'd SO make this again. EDITED: This has now become one of our favorite summer drinks. I like to change it up, too, and cut back on the sugar by half, cut back on the water by half and use either lemon-lime soda or ginger ale to make it a sparkling lemonade. We just love this recipe.

This was very good. A refreshing, not so tart lemonade for those that don't don't like tart lemonades. It really tastes like oranges. My husband loves it and asks for more. Next time i'll leave out the rind tho, cause not every1 likes those. Personally i really liked adding the rind, it gives it a very nice look and i dont mind the taste of them.

I really enjoyed this recipe but the men in my family hated the lemon & orange peel that was floating in the drink and insist that I leave it out the next time.  Nice flavor though!

This is a great recipe for orangeade!! I don't heat the water and sugar, I mix directly in the serving container and the sugar disolves just fine. The first batch was a little too sweet, so reduced the sugar to a bit less than 3/4 of a cup, and omitted the zest and it was perfect.

Refreshing and fresh tasting summer-like or breakfast drink with a lot of eye appeal because of its vivid orange color.  I didn’t find it necessary to simmer the sugar syrup for 10 minutes – bringing it to a boil to dissolve the sugar was adequate.  In fact, those who complained that this was too sweet may have reduced the sugar syrup too much by simmering it so long.  Adding water, of course, to make up the difference of the evaporated water, would take care of that.  So I’m not sure why the submitter directs to simmer the simple syrup so long.  I didn’t add the grated peel either – the thought of grinds of peel in our mouth as we drank this didn’t appeal to either Hubs or me.  It wasn’t missed at all, so I’m not sure what it would contribute in a positive way.  Our main criticism, or disappointment, was that this turned out to be decidedly more like fresh-squeezed orange juice than an orange-lemonade, which is fine, I guess, but not what we were expecting.  The reviewer who described this as “orangeade” was very accurate in her description.

It's easy and tasty, I just wish I strained out the peel or not included it, its inclusion made the drink less refreshing.

I made this for 4th of july and was a HUGE success. I thought it would be super orangey and it wasnt. It had such a nice balance!  I make no changes except I doubled it to fill my drink dispenser and I used dried orange peel. I will defintely do this again.

This tasted pretty good, but it is a "little too sweet" from the amount of syrup with oranges already being sweet on their own. The sugar though did actually disolve quite quickly and didn't need the full 10 minutes. I could taste both the orange juice and lemon juice which I liked. I did however leave out the rind because I only like it in baked goods. I made the full recipe and it took 3 oranges and 4 lemons, and I didn't even fill my pitcher half way suprisingly. So, this would be very suitable for someone living in Florida or that has lemon or orange trees. To make it the right blend of sweetness, I would consider adding more water to taste. But, an interesting twist on lemonade.

I left the peels out because I just don't like peel in my drinks but I LOVE this! I served it at a family bbq and it was a hit with everyone. I have made this multiple times and had no issues and will keep making it again! Tip: It is easier to make at night and you will then wake up to a refreshing drink, it takes awhile to cool down all the way

This is a great recipe! I cut the sugar in half and didn't use any of the peel. I've made it several times and my entire family loves it. The last time I made it, I had a lot of citrus fruit to use up, so I made it with 2 cups lemon, 1/2 cup each of grapefruit and orange, 1/4 cup of lime juice, about 11 cups of water and 1 cup of sugar and it was awesome. Thanks for sharing, Martha.

This was a perfect summer beverage!  Like others, I used freshly squeezed orange juice (4-5 navel oranges) as well as the juice of one large lemon and one grapefruit.  I also skipped the zest/peel addition, which I am sure adds a nice zing but I had already tossed my citrus.  Furthermore, I also substituted ginger ale/sprite to make it even more refreshing.  Was a huge hit paired with smoked grilled chicken!  Thanks so much, Martha!
