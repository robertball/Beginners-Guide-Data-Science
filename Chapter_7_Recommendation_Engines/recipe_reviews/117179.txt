I don't know that this would have been hearty or substantial enough for Hubs, but between him being out of town on business and all the baking I do (read between the lines...) this was the perfect choice for me - and I was wowed, simply wowed.  Waaay beyond what I expected from this.  I would have preferred some rice with it but I reference the aforementioned baking I do...  I didn't measure anything, and I think that's what is often KEY to whether a recipe works for you or not  - add the amount of seasonings to suit YOUR tastebuds.  So I didn't measure,  just threw the amount of coleslaw mix (I made it easy on myself) in the pan I thought my stomach wanted.  I found it easier  to cook the onions (I used red onion - nice color!)  and garlic along with the cabbage - it skipped a step first of all, and I felt more in control of how long to cook not only the garlic, but the shrimp too.  I used sesame oil when I cooked the cabbage and no water when I cooked the shrimp.  I know that cilantro is central to much of Asian cooking, but I've only been enjoying it recently and only in Mexican dishes.  It was WONDERFUL, especially when coupled with the toasted sesame oil I finished the dish off with (and  I highly recommend that finishing touch!).  I think I had this ready for my fork in 5-6 minutes tops.  I enjoyed every last bit of it and the only thing that would have made it better, other than rice, was more of it!

This was fantastic, though I did change it a bit. I added the soy sauce to the cabbage as I was cooking it, and also added some rice wine vinegar.  I added about a cup of chicken stock to the onions and let it simmer down before I added the shrimp.  Lastly, I sprinkled toasted almonds over everything at the end.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quick & tasty (and healthy!) one-dish meal.

I live with a Burmese man, and their cooking is very similar to Thai... he enjoyed this recipe very much!  I marinated the shrimp in my favorite spices, only used half the water and soy, and garnished the dish with thin-sliced onions marinated in chile sauce, chopped peanuts, cilantro, red pepper flakes, and would have loved some bean sprouts with it.  The cabbage would also have been good if sauteed with a little of the soy sauce or fish sauce and tomato paste.

This recipe was great.  Although I changed the serving size to around 4 to make it a dinner-sized meal.  I added a lot of onions and green bell pepper strips to the stirfry.  I also omitted water and added extra soy sauce. The shrimp cooked up great in just a couple minutes.  Delicious!

This was so good. I stir-fried the cabbage in sesame oil. Omitted the water and added a little more soy sauce. Added some cashews at the end.Very quick and easy.

Very good recipe.  The only thing I may change to "improve" the taste is to add some crunchy oriental noodle in with the cabbage.  I haven't tried it yet, but I think it would be a great addition.  Will definitely make again.

Thanks for a great idea. I added hoisin sauce because I like it in stir fry.  I thought that this recipe would also be good with carrots and mushrooms in the mix.

This was easy, fast and delicious.  I like that the recipe is written for one serving.  I added additional onion and garlic to the cabbage when I was cooking it and threw in a chopped jalapeno for a little more heat.  Other than that, followed recipe exactly as written.  Great.

This was good! Very filling and healthy too, I used red onion because that's what I had and increase the amont to 3 servings. Next time I'm  only going to use half the water and sprinkle chopped peanuts when serving. Simple dish that's good and easy to put together, definately worth trying many times! Elvira Silva.

This was WONDERFUL.  So easy and quick to prepare.  I did add shredded  carrots and it was beautiful.  I'm going to try this with chicken or pork.  I think it would be great for those who aren't nuts about shrimp.

This was very tasty!  I did not expect this to pack that much flavor.  I addes asian chili sauce instead of the red pepper flakes.  This was a fast healty meal.  My hubby really liked it as well.

Good, simple meal.  I didn't have cilantro (not a big fan, anyway) but the flavor was nice.  I used purple cabbage (for a family function - thought it would look pretty) but if it sits/cooks for any length of time, it will turn gray... just an FYI!!

this is perhaps one of the easiest and tastiest meals i have ever made!  as a working mom, it is so easy to throw in the wok and serve in minutes - especially with precooked shrimp.  the first time i made it, i shredded a head of cabbage, but since then have used the coleslaw mix which is a big time saver.  i also added julienned carrots so there is something other than just cabbage.  i left out the red pepper flakes for me and my 3 year old, but my husband loves spicy food and with the pepper flakes he thinks it is the perfect level of spiciness.  this is now a regular in my house!

I really enjoyed this recipe. Something a little different and pretty easy. I didn't have soy sauce and didn't miss it. Also, I used dried cilantro, and the recipe still had a good flavor (I added the crushed pepper and cilantro to the oil I used to stir fry the shrimp).  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing and so, so simple! Fresh, clean and cant wait to make again. I used the cole slaw mix for convience, red onion sliced thin, no water, fresh cilantro which really is key and the hot pepper flakes are right up my alley. I loved this dinner last night....who needs rice? Not me...this is tasty, easy, and perfect as is. Thanks!....ps....also forgot to mention that I did add a few splashes of sesame oil at the end! Really has great flavor!

Thai Shrimp & Cabbage Haiku: "Wicked, tasty dish. Made a couple small changes, but adored this meal!" I coarsely chopped my cabbage rather than shredding so it'd retain more bite and shape, and also stir-fried it in sesame oil. I used some red bell pepper for additional color. My shrimp were a frozen "garlic grilled" brand, so while that added extra flavor-oomph, I know next time I'd be happier w/ fresh shrimp. My only wee concern was that it was a little watery, so I think that next time I'll also mix a little cornstarch w/ water to thicken the sauce up at the end.

This is a super tasty and easy dish to put together quickly (does it get any better than that)!  I had red cabbage on hand and it worked out fine.  Otherwise the only significant change I made was replacing the soy sauce with Bragg's Liquid Aminos (healthy substitute) and eliminated the cilantro.  I really liked having a vegetable (cabbage) in place of a starch (rice).

This was really good for how simple the recipe is. I used garlic powder and crushed a dried red chili into flakes. I cooked the cabbage longer because I like mine tender and added a diced carrot.

I LOVE this! So quick and easy! Even my husband truly enjoyed and he's not one to venture...this is definitely out of the norm for my meat and potatoes guy! I did cook the cabbage with the soy sauce instead of adding it later, and I used shallots.  I'm 4 months pregnant and typed in the ingrediants I was craving "shrimp" and "cabbage" and I was SO GLAD I found this simple solution to what I was looking for! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

So easy, good and healthy.  What more could you want?  Well actually I wouldn't mind if someone else peeled the shrimp, I find that a bit tedious.

Quick and easy stir-fry recipe that is very good.  I used a bag of coleslaw mix and 1 lb of shrimp.  Next time I will make a bigger recipe.  It was all gone and everyone wanted more.

I liked this recipe and it was quick and easy to make.  I thought it needed just a little sweetness, my husband thought it should be a little more "saucy".  Next time, I might add just a little sugar.  I liked the idea of using some broth, as someone else suggested.

This is really good!!  The minced fresh cilantro really makes this simple cabbage taste very good. I seasoned the cabbage with salt when I stir-fry it. Served this with steam white rice.

Excellent! We still made steamed rice to add as a side. The sauce was so good. My husband said it was like a shrimp egg roll but I pointed out no breading & no frying. Nutrious and tasty!

I tried this today, it came out excellent. The only change I made was substituting the oil with a combination of olive, grapeseed and chili oils. I will definately make this one again.

This was a quick, healthy and delicious dinner.  I followed all the directions to the letter except my shrimp were a little smaller and I put the red pepper on my portion (and not my husband's). I will definitely use this recipe again.

Excellent! Used olive oil, added julienned carrots, and omitted the onions, but followed the recipe other than that. We really loved this dish, I will make it again. Thank you! :)

This was great and easy!  I didn't change anything, I think I will try to make it at least once a week.
