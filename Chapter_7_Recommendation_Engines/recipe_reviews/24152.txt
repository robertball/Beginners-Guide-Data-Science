This was a nice pancake recipe Sara.  I used all white flour and had to skip the buttermilk since I was out.  In it's place, I used an 8 oz carton of plain yogurt mixed with enough milk to make 1-1/2 cups and added about 3/4 of a cup of canned pumpkin along with some pumpkin pie spice.  I also added a splash of vanilla extract to give it some extra flavor.  I made "mini" pancakes for my kids to nibble on and got quite a few from one batch.  They were very dense and tasted healthy with the bananas and pumpkin mixed in.  Thanks a bunch for sharing.

I love the basics of this recipe. However I do make a lot of changes. Instead of using A.P flour I use all whole wheat. I also, mash the bananas before adding to the mixture. Then I have to add more milk and about 1 tsp of vanilla and some cinnamon. I make my own buttermilk also. Then while cooking, I add frozen raspberries. They turned out delicious. I've made these twice now and will more than likely make them again!

Great recipe - easy and low-fat, but tastes luscious.  Even my DH (not a whole-wheat kind of guy) loved them.  Add frozen blueberries for added taste.

New favorite pancakes over here. It's amazing they can be so fluffy and tender without the eggs and fat.   We don't usually have buttermilk on hand, so I sub with vanilla yogurt  thinned with skim milk, and add half a tsp baking soda. I also  mash the banana and add it to the liquid, along with vanilla and cinnamon, and brown sugar. Thanks Sara - this is a family favorite.

Probably will not be making these again.  I have found that using wheat flour (while healthier) makes pancakes a bit chewy.  Also, chopping the bananas left little banana chunks throughout the batter - the husband did not care for this.  Perhaps I should have beat the batter - I just stirred it with a whisk.  Overall, buttermilk pancakes is preferred over this banana version.

These were good.  Definitely a lot of banana flavor and very moist!  I didn't have buttermilk so I improvised using vanilla yogurt and milk.  I also added some cinnamon.  We all thought the flavor was awesome!  I'll definitely make these again.

We liked this very much. I added cinnamon and vanilla as suggested. The sugar added made it difficult for me to avoid burning the surface before the inside got cooked. It might have been that I did not measure everything appropriately.

I substituted soured milk for buttermilk and added two eggs.  The recipe made 12 eight-inch, cake-like, hardy pancakes.  My family love them.  I was surprised by the lack of oil in the recipe, but the consistency was excellent.

We did not care for this recipe. We felt that the pancakes were too dense and heavy, while we prefer light and fluffy pancakes.  We will not be using this recipe again.

These were too heavy and felt soggy-ish.  Won't use this recipe again.  I am wondering if it should be baking SODA instead of baking powder in the recipe.  The baking soda would react with the buttermilk to create lightness in the pancake.

I had the recipe calculate for 8 servings than, added 3 bannanas, 4 T oil, 1 t. almond extract, 2 eggs. It was very tasy, also I didn't have the buttermilk so I substituted 2 T vinegar in the milk & let it set 5 min.

After reading through some of the reviews, I added a little vanilla, one egg, and a couple tbsp. of melted butter. I made this tonight so it's ready in the morning. EDITED: This was good, but not great. It's missing something. My changes helped, but I just can't put my finger on what's needed still.

I wasn't sure about trying these because of some of the poor reviews, but they were great! I did add one egg and vanilla & cinnamon....but they were not too dense or stiff at all. My bananas were pretty dark which probably helped make it not be dry. my 6 month old & 2 yr. old gobbled them up!

This is a great recipe in a pinch if you are out of eggs!  I don't keep buttermilk around either, but you can add a tablespoon of lemon juice and a teaspoon of baking soda to substitute.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and blueberries.  It was wonderful.  Even my picky toddlers enjoyed them with butter and powdered sugar on top.

One of the easiest, best-tasting recipes you can make from scratch. I love to make this when people come to visit me! I definitely agree with the previous reviewers that suggested adding 1 tsp of vanilla. And use the oldest bananas possible to make mashing quick and easy!

This recipe is SO GOOD!  I must admit that I came across it one morning when I didn't have the eggs I needed to make my normal pancakes and was pleasantly surprised by the results.  I didn't have buttermilk either unfortunately, so I subbed a milk/yogurt combo that worked great.  I also added 1/2 tsp baking soda per another review.  They were incredible!  We added chocolate chips for an extra treat!  My toddler gobbled them up (even without the chocolate chips).  THey were fluffy, tender, and delicious!  Definitely try these.

This recipe is probably adequate for those seeking low-fat food.  I made it only because I needed to use up some bananas and buttermilk, and I was disappointed.  The pancakes are heavy, not fluffy.  Even my kids wouldn't eat them, and they usually love pancakes.

I used only whole wheat flour and instead of buttermilk, skim milk and low fat vanilla yogurt. I also recommend adding some Quaker oats. They turned out great and I will definitely making these again!

I used 1 c rice flour and 3/4 c oats, added 2 tbsp ground flax seed and a touch of vanilla and molasses. Very light and fluffy, but also a bit chewy as rice flour often tends to turn out. This is my second time to make them and will be sure to make them again.

I thought these were amazing!!!! i did change the recipe up though.  I didnt have buttermilk so used about 1/4 cup banana cream pie yogurt and 1/4 cup milk to thin it out. and i mashed the banana into mush and added some vanilla and cinnamon.  then i added banana slices once they were cooking.  I topped with honey cuse idont like syrup.  But they were great!...heavy just the way i like it and very filling...texture was great

For a no-egg buttermilk pancake recipe, this was pretty good.  The pancakes turned out quite soft, and I liked the little bits of banana throughout.  If you have eggs on hand, however, I think there are probably better recipes out there.  Good but not great.  I'd make it again if I craved pancakes and had no eggs.

I made these for lunch today, and they were very good!  I was looking for an egg-free pancake recipie since I was out of eggs.  I was out of banana's, too, so I substituted applesauce, made my own buttermilk, and added cinnamon and raisins...  the children really enjoyed them!  (as did I)

The batter was too thick to handle and required more liquid. I added almost half a cup of whole milk. The pancakes were a bit heavy but the taste was ok. I don't think I will make them again though.

I liked that this recipe didn't call for eggs, as my toddler son has a mild allergy to them.  I followed the recipe, but at the last minute added about 1/3 cup whole milk as my batter was quite dry.  These made delicious, fluffy pancakes that were scarfed up by my hungry boys (husband included).  Adding blueberries during the cooking process made them even better.

This is a good recipe if you're out of eggs, but overall they're not the best banana pancakes I've ever eaten.   I had buttermilk and ripe bananas to use so this was supper along with turkey kielbasi.  I was a bit freaked by other reviews who said they were so thick that they didn't cook through.  I followed the recipe exactly other than using all white flour and a touch of vanilla.   I started out with my griddle heated to 5 out of 10 and I didn't flip until most of the top was "dryish".  On my second griddleful I turned up the heat to about 7.  Lower temp on pancakes just made for chewy cakes I could barely cut.  The recipe made 12 ea. 1/4 cup pancakes.  Doubt I'll make these again unless I'm eggless with leftover buttermilk and ripe bananas.

These are good, but not great. Good option if I am out of eggs. I prefer Mom's Buttermilk Pancakes from this website instead, but these are a good low fat alternative.

Supper thick and sticky.  Had to add a lot of extra milk to make it more of a pancake consistancy.  Next time I will add more bananas, sugar, nuts and milk so they are more fluffy and more similar in flavor to banana nut bread.

These are good pancakes but not great pancakes. My test of a great pancake is when it tastes great all by itself. I rarely use syrup but did for these.

Thank you for this great recipe! It is very tasty. I was thrilled to find a recipe that does not call for eggs! We use yogurt instead of buttermilk. They do come out much thicker-I use a spatula to spread the batter on the pan a bit. We've used blueberries and apples instead of bananas.

These were awesome! They are a little thick and took a bit longer to cook than normal pancakes (i used lower heat) but turned out fabulous! Will definitely be making this a regular breakfast for my family.

These pancakes were wonderful! I made them for my 21 year old granddaughter and we both loved them. I had to add a little regular milk because the batter was too think but they taste GREAT!

I really didn't care for these.  They definitely had a lot of banana flavor but needed a little more salt and perhaps a little nutmeg or cinnamon.  Did NOT like the doughy consistancy caused from no eggs.  They also stuck to the griddle because of no oil.  Will not make again.

Good recipe! I made them with skim milk rather than buttermilk because it was all I had- they still turned out well! I served them with a little bit of powdered sugar on top and a side of cinnamon applesauce. It was a nice lower fat, lower calorie pancake meal.

Didn't have any buttermilk so I did 1 tbsp of lemon juice and the rest of the cup of milk and let it sit for a few minutes. then I didn't have any flour so I substituted bisquick for the flour, baking powder and salt. 
I added cinnamon and vanilla as suggested in other reviews. My fiance says they were light but a little doughy. good enough to make again.

I was home on Sunday morning with 3 kids and husband was at work.  We had fresh blueberries on hand but no eggs and wanted to make blueberry pancakes.  We found these.  I didn't have any buttermilk, either, so mixed 1 cup of milk with a tablespoon of lemon juice.  They worked well and gave us the blueberry pancakes we wanted!  Thanks (They didn't taste like "health food" to use at all, unlike what others have said)

Was very dissapointed after preparing this recipe.  I had bananas and buttermilk that I needed to use.  Pancakes are not fluffy at all, they are very doughy.  At first the mixture was thick so I added 1/3 cup of 1% milk, 1/3 cup of all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon of canola oil and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I will definitely not prepare them again.

When I first tasted these they seemed a touch bland, but they are just right with syrup. I expected them to be dense and they are but that's how this kind of pancake tends to be IME... I liked this recipe though I will probably play around with it next time- it does turn out to be a good way to get some fruit and whole grain into my picky kid, and filling too. Thanks!

If you're craving pancakes but don't have eggs, this is the recipe to use.  We like regular egg buttermilk pancakes better, but this was really good.  As with any pancake recipe, you need to adjust the milk until you get the consistency you like - in this case we added about 1/4 cup (soy)milk.

with my addition to the recipe it was about a 3.5. I followed the recipe to a T.   The only thing that could have been better as far as following the directions were use of riper bananas. However the batter once mixed was too hard. I had to add about 1/2 cup more of buttermilk. That helped quite a bit. It was good. I will be trying it again tomorrow.

It's amazing how the relatively small amount of banana adds so much flavour to the pancakes! Also, it's really hard to find pancake recipes that don't use eggs, and this one really is one easy recipe!

OMG It was so good, I found if you dont have buttermilk on hand or the funds to purchase it. A mixture of white vinegar and milk will have the same curdling effect. Not really sure the exact measurements but google does.

I followed it to the letter. The outcome was an average tasting pancake that got off of the gound only due to the bananas. 

In order for it to be better, it would need to be moistened (which is why some people added plain yogurt), would need to rise because it was flat (meaning you'd need either self rising flour instead of All purpose and a touch of baking SODA) and maybe a pinch of cinnamon. I'm going to check to see if there are other recipes that have made these changes but as for this one.....the original recipe is just average.

I did not care for this recipe. As written, this yielded a thick batter nearly the consistency of biscuit dough, with pancakes that stuck to the well-greased pan, burning on the outside while mushy on the inside.  Adjusting the heat and adding more buttermilk made no improvement.

I used this as a basic guideline. Also didn't have buttermilk so I took 6oz of milk and splashed some lemon juice into it and after a couple of minutes poured it into a mixture of roughly mashed bananas and 6 oz of strawberry yogurt and added all wheat flour (will try the half white flour next time to see if it reduces density) They were good enough to eat without syrup, but I also mixed up some sliced strawberries and sugar to pour over them. I meant to add vanilla and will next time, also want to make sure the pancakes are thin enough to cook through without burning.

I used regular flour for the whole thing and vanilla coffee creamer instead of buttermilk.  They turned out very flavorful.  Not too thin or too thick.  I got 18 pancakes.
