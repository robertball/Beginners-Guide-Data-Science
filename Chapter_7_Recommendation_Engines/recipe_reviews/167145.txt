This sorbet was certainly very easy to make.  The only changes I made were to add a bit of lemon zest with the raspberries and to put the mixture in my ice cream maker for 30 minutes before putting it in the freezer.  The flavor is very nice.  The lemon cuts the sweetness of the raspberry and gives it a little bit of tang.  It's very refreshing.  I think what threw me off was the texture.  I could really feel and taste the Jell-o in this sorbet, and not in a good way.  Despite whisking the mixture well, little lumps of Jell-o remained in the final product and I didn't find that appealing.  Also, the Jell-o gave the sorbet the taste of artificial sweeter, which I didn't like.  I might make this again, but probably minus the Jell-o.

This was very easy, a bit pricey though and hard to calculate for a Canadian. Just so others know, in Canada, our cool whip tub comes in 1L, this means you need to use 3 cups of it for this recipe, not the whole thing. Also if you get a regular can of lemonade, it's 12 ounces, so you need to use half of it. I would not make this again as I feel guilty about eating whipped oil/fructose corn syrup products, but if you are allergic to dairy, it's a great option. More lemon would be nice, maybe giving it a kick with some rind or juice, you can always taste it before you freeze it :)

Very easy. We always have the ingredients for this. Last time we used sugar-free and Splenda so my mother-in-law could have some with us and it was so good too.

The reason I made this recipe is because i don't have an ice cream maker and wanted to try making sorbet.. and this recipe did accomplish that... I really liked the texture and the lemon and raspberry flavors went well together

Super easy to make and very tasty.  My raspberries were a bit sour, so next time I may add sugar the the berries before mashing them, or add extra cool whip.

This was a really refreshing and light dessert. I actually used frozen raspberries (cheaper and can keep on hand) and just thawed them, I think they worked out fine. Next time, after mixing I will freeze it and store it in a square container, in a bowl it spins around after thawing and is harder to scoop.

This is so super tasty and so easy!  If raspberries weren't so expensive, I'd make this every week!  YUM!

Very tart and good on a hot day.  More like a Gellato than a sorbet, but yummy nonetheless!

sounds easy enough to make, not too expensive, and great for the summer or anytime. I'm single so I love the fact that I can pare down the recipe for my needs too! I look forward to making this sorbet!

We liked the idea for this light, refreshing cold dessert on a warm evening, but the lemonade concentrate really gave it a harsh intensity that we didn't care for.
