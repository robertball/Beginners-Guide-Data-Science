To make this easier on myself, I made this in the slow cooker by putting the meat and gravy mixture on high for four hours, then I added the carrots and potatoes and cooked for two more hours (still on high).  The meat was nice and tender and the sweetness from the apple juice cut through the saltiness of the soy and onion soup mix.  My husband liked it.

This was very easy to prepare and the result is delicious!  A nice variation from the traditional pot roast flavor.  Even my picky teenager liked it.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes and also added a few small quartered onions with the vegetables.  The meat was very tender, juicy and flavorful; it was good served with the broth, or you can thicken the broth with cornstarch or flour to make a gravy (as picky teenager did).

My kids loved this pot roast! Which is a great things because they are picky eaters. 

I did a few things differently, though. Instead of cooking it in the oven, I cooked it in a Crock Pot for 6 hours and omitted the veggies. Then when it was finished I put it in a baking pan, poured half of the broth on it and used the remaining broth for gravy. It was tender, juicy and delicious!

Really nicely flavored, the sweet of the apple and the salt of the soy balance well.  Very tender and not dry at all.  I forgot to buy the concentrate (it was even on my list and I just skipped over it!), so I used two of my daughter's 100% apple juice juice boxes.  I omitted the water.  This still worked!  It is a great alternative to the traditional, very salty pot roasts.

SO,SO Delicious! Not too sweet, Not too salty, I would say pretty darn perfect.  Very moist! No knives needed! I did add a bay leaf and added more garlic(we are garlic freaks in our house!).  A hit in the Elliott house!

This roast was very flavorful. I omitted the potatoes and added 2 coursely chopped onions.I also omitted the apple juice and added a sliced apple and 3 ribs of chopped celery about 1 hour before it was done.I also used 4 cups of beef broth and 1 packet of beef/onion dry soup mix along with the dry onion soup mix.It was very,very good.

I was disappointed with how this roast turned out.  I found the apple to be much too sweet.  Maybe using half a can of the apple juice concentrate would be better.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I didn't taste any apple in this roast.  It just tasted like soy sauce and onion soup mix.  The cooking time was really off, too, my roast (which was the same size called for in the recipe) was done after two hours, so I didn't even get to put the vegetables in.  I won't be making this again.

Sorry I hate to post a bad review, but this was not good!! I put it on was so excited to have a homecooked meal ready after picking up my husband from being out of town. We get home and serve it and it was to apple tasting. I followed the directions exactly as writen. Whenever you took a bite of the potato and carrot it was sour tasting. Yes, the roast was tender, but did not have good flavor.

This was really good! I didn't have concentrated apple juice so used what I had, apple cider, and was wonderful. 1 warning though, I used a 1lb roast so expected it to cook faster but it was done in less than 2 hours so you might want to check it more often to avoid over cooking. Update...I made this with a pork roast and it was even better! BTW I cooked this both times in my slow cooker. I have the kind that takes 1/2 the time as the usual ones. and they were done in only 2 hours. I cooked a little longer only to make it more tender. Try this with a pork roast thoughas it truly is amazing, more than 5 stars.

Great flavor, cooked for two hours at 350 for medium rare. very tender! I added more soy sauce to balance the sweetness of the apple juice and it worked out great!

I'm from the south so true southern style food is a normal in my home. I used this recipe as I was looking for a "new" flavor to my normal roast.   I found it to be way to sweet! Though it was "ok" Esp. For kids!

We were able to do this recipe in the crock pot / slow cooker...instead of a 1/2 inch of water i did an inch of water just to ensure the meat wouldn't dry out...also i ended up cooking it on high the entire time for an extra half an hour [4 1/2 hours]...i added the vegetables around the two hour mark...not going to lie we were very skeptical about the apple juice concentrate but it turned out to be super delicious and flavorful! the meat was perfectly tender! We will be making this dish again!

Excellent recipe!!!  This is one of our family's favorites and I love how it makes the whole house smell great all day.  I follow the recipe with a few exceptions: I add carrots and celery to the pot roast.  Then I make red-skinned mashed potatoes on the side and use the left over liquid from the pot roast to make gravy.  Thanks Christine for a wonderful recipe! The leftover meat and gravy (if you have any) is a great substitute for the meat and broth in the Beef Stew and Dumplings recipe from this site.  Makes another delicious meal without as much work as starting from scratch.

this roast was just ok.  3 pound roast only took 2 hours to cook, so listened to everyones advice about adding carrots/potatoes in sooner.  The potatoes tasted pretty decent, but the flavor of the apple juice concentrate/onion soup and soy sauce did NOT compliment the carrots at all.  I couldn't eat them.

Amazing!! I have never made pot roast before, but my Grandma makes the best pot roast and I have to say this is just as good, if not better! My husband loved it at first but as he was eating he said it was a little too sweet and next time I should use half a can of apple juice instead of the whole can. I still think it's DELICIOUS, I am eating the leftovers at this very moment! I did everything exactly as the recipe says except I cooked for 8 hours on low in my slow cooker.

Fantastic!!!  We only cooked potatoes with it.  We also put a small rack in the roaster and put some cabbage in to steam.  It was so delicious my 1 year old was eating it and my picky husband said I could make it again.

We used 2.5 cubes of veggie boulion mixed with a 1/2 c. of hot water instead of the onion soup mix.  We also used about 4 c. of Cran-Raspberry 100% Juice in place of water.  This was delicious...4.5 stars out of 5. :-)

I have never made pot roast myself because everyone else's, whether at someone's home or at a restaraunt, I never liked it.  But chuck roast was on sale at the grocery store and I came across this recipe.  I was skeptical but tried it out.  I followed the recipe but used regular apple juice rather than concentrate.  It was SOOO good.  The meat so tender and flavorful.  My husband couldn't get enough.  Usually we have left overs to give neighbors/friends...but not with this recipe!

I went a little crazy with the soy sauce & garlic so I was afraid it would be too salty.  Not to mention the onion mix was like pure flavored salt.  I bought a cheap apple concentrate- which made me doubt my creation as well.  It turned out perfect.  I honestly hate roasts.  This was perfect for me.  Not crazy BEEF flavor, a nice refreshing taste.  Thanks!

This was AWESOME! I think it may just be my new roast recipe. I did not make any changes, which is unusual. I did however, cook it in my slow cooker on low for 8 hours. Next, I am going to have to try the stew reccommended by another user. I love recipes that are 2 in 1!

I've made this recipe several times now, and each and every time, it has been a huge hit!  My husband LOVES it, and always says it's the most tender, moist and delicious roast he's ever had.  Better than a restaurant, he says! :)  I served it for family who came to visit, and everyone raved on how much they loved it.  A+ recipe, so easy to make, and quick too!

Loved making this, very simple, but made a few small changes.  A friend of mine told me about this recipe & had mentioned that her vegetables turned to mush, that cooking them for 2 more hours was too much.  So I cut that down to 1:15 on the last leg, also used gourmet baby carrots, (unsliced), red potatoes not peeled but cubed & added chopped green onions on the roast @ the start.  Perfect!

I really liked this recipe!  I made a few minor changes and it was delish!  I used sliced mushrooms and onions and instead of onion soup I used Emeril's Essence seasoning (I can't do MSG)  LOVED this roast and will make it again.

My husband gave this a 9.5 out of 10! So easy and so good. I added more garlic and chopped onions and used a cup or two of apple juice instead of the concentrate (helped reduce the sweetness). Made mashed potatoes and gravy with the juice. Delicious and so easy. Thanks

Awesome!!!!  I made this for dinner tonight and it was very tasty.  My husband enjoys things more savory, so it wasn't his favorite- but he did go back for seconds.  My kids and I loved it.  Five stars!!!

I loved this. I used apple juice instead of concentrate + water and chopped onion instead of the mix. I can see how it might be too sweet for some, but I really liked the flavor combination. I might add a little spice next time (red pepper?) to balance the sweetness a little more.

This was good. My husband thought it too sweet, but I didn't. Only put the carrots in, and rubbed the netted rump roast with the soy sauce. Could not taste the soy at all. stuck garlic in the netting, will cut pockets the next time as flavor was very subtle. Great for a cold fall night! Made the house smell wonderful!

I loved this dish!  The only thing I did differently was instead of juice concentrate I used apple sauce, just a bit more than 12 ounces though and it was incredible!

Delicious pot roast! It was so good, a 3 lb roast only served 2 of us with a little left for lunch. Not too sweet or onion-y.

I cooked mine in a slow cooker. Placed the meat and non-veggies inside as directed on high for 4 hours, then sliced up the veggies and put them on high for another 2. Came out fantastically. Might add sliced apple next time.

The roast itself was delicious.  The onion mix on top blended well with the sweet apple juice.  I had an English cut chuck roast that was a hair under 3lbs, so the cooking time was cut down about 20 minutes.  The only reason this wasn't a 4 star was because the vegetables were bland and undercooked.

Be careful with this recipe. I cooked a slightly smaller roast for 2 hours at 375 and the roast was finished before I even added the potatoes and carrots!  Overall, great flavor though!

This is awesome! I made it with actual apple cider instead of water and apple juice concentrate, and I used Lipton Beefy Onion dry soup mix. I also substituted coconut aminos for soy sauce, and sprinkled coarse ground black pepper and garlic powder on each side. Both times there were no leftovers!

I rate this as I love it but I changed the recipe slightly.  I added 1/4 cup of packed brown sugar and dissolved it in the juice after the roast had cooked for a while.  I did let some of the brown sugar on the roast as well.  The sugar makes the roast and carrots more tender.

Delicious.  I cooked it in the crock pot by coating it in the onion soup mix and searing it in a pan.  I put it in the crock pot and added the veggies (carrots and parsnips)underneath.  The sweet and savory combo worked nicely.

I loved this (and so did my husband, who doesn't normally like sweet or apple flavored meals). I browned the roast in a skillet and poked about 10 garlic slivers into it then transferred to my crockpot. I added the rest of the ingredients and slow-cooked for about 6 hours. I can't wait to make it again... the leftovers went much too quickly.

My roast is cooking as I write this.  I used 21/2 cups apple cider instead of apple juice concentrate. I also browned beef and veggies first, deglazing the pan with 1/2 cup brandy before adding the cider.  Because I generously seasoned the roast and veg with salt and pepper, I did forgo the soy sauce.  I tasted the broth as I put the roast in the oven----very good balance of sweet and savory.  Will add beef broth to drippings when making gravy.

It's a great recipe, accentuated by the sweetness. Adding a Granny Smith Apple in with the potatoes and carrots gives it an extra 'umph'. All in all, expect the vegetable to hold more of the apple flavor than the meat, even with the garlic insertions. Basting helps, and should be added to the official instructions. A delicious dish regardless!

I've made this recipe numerous times, both in my oven and in my slow cooker. I always make it when my local grocery has roasts on special that come with free bags of veggies. It is a little sweet (I've made it with both apple juice and the frozen concentrate) but I don't find the sweetness overpowering at all. I dump it all in the slow cooker and after an hour or two of cooking, I add in carrots, quartered onions, and diced potatoes. Then I just cook it until the meat falls apart. It's so delicious. As per another review, I also used my leftovers the first time to make stew and dumplings. I found the recipe for that on here was too many steps for what I had, so I just reheated the leftover frozen pot roast with all the juice and veg and then made dumplings to drop in. It came out super delicious. Great repurposed meal as well. Thank you!

One of my favs! This roast turns out so good. With the apple flavor and the tenderness, delish. I have to add a little more to it bc of all the men around but still wonderful lol. Ty
