With some minor modifications this was excellent chili and will become my standing chili recipe.  My fiance really liked it and he's a tough critic.  I did not use any chicken stock and I'm glad I didn't.  I like my chili thick and I believe the stock would have made it more like chili soup.  For a little more liquid I put about a half bottle of beer which was the perfect consistency for me.  The only other change I made was I added 4 cloves of garlic with the onion and I cut back on the chili powder to 4 tablespoons - which was plenty.  I used 3/4 teaspoon of red pepper - which was plenty of spice. I also used Bush's Chili Beans.  Topped with cheddar cheese and slatines - YUM!  Perfect for a cold night.  I can't wait to eat leftovers tonight.

Not sure if this dish really qualifies as Chile. Taste isn't bad but it strikes me as more of a pasta sauce that someone added a lot of beans and chile powder and left out the Italian spices. In Chile the meat should take center stage and have a good balance of vegetables and spices regardless of the heat level. In this, tomatoes clearly dominate with the beans a close second. Meat flavor is seriously lacking and it is very thin and soupy even tho I followed other reviewers suggestions and cut the chicken broth amount in half and increase meat 50%-which are the only changes I made. Sorry Justin.

My husband and I entered this in a Chili Cookoff last night and won first place. To make it a little different we added mild italian sausage and reduced the chili powder to 2 tablespoons. Like others suggested, we added 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of pinto beans. We mixed in some sour cream and cheese and it was excellent. This is really good with the amusement park cornbread recipe from this site.

I have tried this recipe out before and just made some tonight. I think the key here is what kind of chili powder you use. The first time I used the generic real cheap stuff at the supermarket. This time I used a really good, slightly expensive chili powder and toasted in a dry pan first. Let me tell you, it makes all the difference in the world. Before you make this chili, make sure you have a good chili powder in the cubbard. The taste of this chili is truly one of a kind. AAAA++++

I have to admit, partway through cooking, I was concerned about how this was going to turn out (the tomato soup was such an obvious flavour, and all I could smell was cumin), but fear not: After following the recipe exactly, this stuff is fabulous! Great flavour, great heat, great consistency. This is good stuff.

Easy to make and a real hit at work. Wonderful in a crockpot, just prep meat and onions, then add everything to the crockpot. Great for pot lucks served with grated cheddar and oyster crackers

Last reviewer is out of their MIND! This is what chili is supposed to taste like. You switched to beef broth instead of chicken broth thats the problem right there. This chili is very good stuff, and to me I think the chicken broth as wierd as it sounds is what makes this chili so good. Simply put, great chili.

This is the best chili I have ever made. I did make some modifications based on other reviews. I used only 1/2 can of chicken broth, and added  1/2 can of beer. I used one can of pinto and one can of kidney beans both drained, but not rinsed. And finally 5 teaspoons of chili powder instead of tablespoons. DELICIOUS!!!!

This recipe was simply fantastic!  I have never been a fan of 'real' chili, but this recipe just changed that!  Also, my fiance, who is a huge 'real' chili fan could not stop raving about it!

Based on other reviews, I did alter the recipe a little.  I only put in one can of chicken broth, I added an extra can of crushed tomatoes, and I added some macaroni to replace one can of the beans.  The end result was thick, hearty, spicy and simply divine.

Thank you for the recipe, Justin!  This will be a regular staple in our house from now on!

This is great chili. I did use less chili powder- only 2 tbls, but I bought some serious chipotle chili powder that I think is more powerful than most. I would suggest tasting as you add the heat. Thanks for the recipe!

Love it!  The chili has a nice spicy kick to it with a bit of heat at the end.  I did make some minor changes - added minced garlic, corn, and diced tomatoes.  I also substituted kidney beans for the pinto beans and I cut the chili powder in half.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

This is great stuff!  I doubled the recipe right off the bat because it sounded really good!  My whole family loved it, and has decided that it is our new chili recipe!  It appears really liqudiy while cooking, but it ends up perfect once it reaches the bowl!  I followed the recipe to a TEE, but skipped any additional ceyanne...next time I will add just a bit!  If you're on the fence, try it!  I think you'll be pleased!

We had this chili tonight and it was great. I've made it before, but I have never reviewed it. I've always pretty much followed the recipe, but tonight, I did make some changes per other reviews. I used 2 pounds of meat, 1 pound of ground beef and 1 pound of ground turkey. I added 3 cans of soup and only one can of broth. After browning the meat and onions, I finished it in the crockpot while we went to the movies. When we came home, the house smelled great and dinner was ready! Thanks for the recipe.

This has a really great taste, but is kind of thin.  I cut down on the chicken broth and added a can of tomato paste, and it was much thicker, with the same great taste.  My family loved it!!

Mmmm!  I'm not into to really hot chili so I only put in about 3 Tablespoons of the chili powder instead of 5, and didn't add any cayenne.  It still had a kick, but in a very flavorful way!  I used the pinto beans; next time I think I might put a can of them in and a can of red kidney beans just for some extra color.  I put it in a crock pot and cooked it all day - chili was kind of soupy at first but I left off the lid for the last 1 1/2 hours of cooking and it was great!  Perfect with cheddar cheese and cornbread.  I think I'll enter this in a chili cookoff myself soon . . . giving credit where credit is due, of course. :)

Thanks SO much - this is some of the best chili I've ever had, and much better than a lot of restaurants make. :)

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was very flavorful and easy, but a little soupier than I prefer even though I drained the beans.  I think it could be made with less broth and soup.

Original recipe I would give 4 stars but after tweaking it just a bit, this was darn good chili!!!  I doubled the recipe but added an extra pound of ground beef (3lbs all together) In addition to onion, I added some green/red bell pepper.  I added 2 cans of drained diced tomatoes and used kidney beans instead of pinto.  Instead of the cayenne pepper, I used ground chipotle chili pepper and this I think is what made this recipe excellent.  I added a generous amount and it gave it a smokey taste that was just DELICIOUS!

I am a bigger fan of Taco Soup, but this was good chili!  The few changes I made was....one can of rotel rather than crushed tomatoes.  I used one can of pintos and one of spicy chili beans rather than two cans of pintos. (I really like kidney beans, but didn’t have any on hand).   I too like a thicker chili, so rather than two cans of chicken broth, I used chicken granules, dissolved in 1/2 C of water.  I threw in a beef bouillon cube to the chicken granules.  I cooked this in the crockpot on low for 8 hours.   This had a great kick to it!!   I took an easy route and served with crackers.  For left-overs tonight, I am going to serve with grilled cheese sandwiches.  Very good.....thanks!

This is almost exactly the same recipe I use, and I am from Indiana, except I use BEEF Broth and use 2 lbs. of ground chuck.

Excellent!

This is very possibly the best chili I have ever had.  I followed the recipe but only added one can of pinto beans.  Texans do not usually add beans to chili.  Do be careful with the cayenne pepper "to taste".  I would recommend 1/2 teaspoon.

This is the first recipe I just had to write a review for.  YUMMY!!!  The only things I did differently were to only add 1 can of chicken broth and a little less chili powder (since my son doesn't like things to spicy).  This is very similar to my mom's chili and my family loved it.  Thanks!

This chili was amazingly soooo good!  Who would think that tomato soup and broth would make an awesome chili.  Made double for 4 people, and was worried that I would have to freeze half because it turned out to be alot.  But today is a few days later, and I just had the last of it...and it was still amazingly good!  Try it!

I followed the recipe exactly, and the flavor of this chili is great.  I thought the seasoning was perfect.  Will definitely make again, with some minor changes, namely using red kidney beans.  I thought the pinto beans were a little mealy for this chili.  And, I will decrease the amount of chicken broth to about 20 oz. and use a little more meat.  Overall an excellent recipe.

As good as described!  I came across the recipe while looking for something to make for a tailgate party I was heading to.  Main reason this recipe caught my eye was that EVERYONE rated it 5 stars!  Its hard to find a recipe that everyone agrees on.  Followed the recipe as described and it turned out to be the hit of the tailgate.  Nothing better than people constantly asking for a recipe!  Thanks for posting this one!  I'll be using it again for sure!

This is good for a fast chili. I followed others' suggestions and omitted chicken broth and used a half bottle of beer instead. I liked the thickness, but my husband said it could have been even thicker. Good flavors -- I substituted chipotle chili powder for one of the tablespoons of chili powder -- that gave it a good, smoky quality to it. I'll probably make it again when I need a fast chili.

This recipe is very similar to a campbells soup crockpot chili recipe I modified to make stovetop that I LOVE.  I have made it with or without red kidney beans (chili beans), black beans, can of tomatoes, macaroni (for chili mac) depending on what I had or didn't have in my pantry.  I have also made a 3 or 5 way chili with it using spaghetti or I sometimes add macaroni & call it chili mac. I have even been known to serve it over cooked white rice.   I have gone thru many chili recipes until I ran across the campbells recipe.  Now discovering this recipe to have much of the same ingredients & contain many similarities, I know it is quite good and not surprised this recipe won an award.  The only changes I would make with this recipe  is to add less liquid so that it is more of a chili and less of a soup, and add garlic (2 cloves)--a must in my kitchen!

This is the best chili I've ever tasted.  I didn't really like chili that much until I had this at my mom's house.  I had to get the recipe from her.  It's not too obvious from the ingredients, but this chili does have quite a kick to it, which I love!  Give this chili a try, even if the ingredients do seem a little odd.

The flavor of this chili is great. In my opinion, the beans are necessary. I like use half pinto and half kidney. Also, there is WAY too much chicken broth in this recipe. I think it has to be a mistake. Use half the amount of chicken broth at the very most. I use even less than that. Otherwise, it becomes more of a broth that tastes like chili. This chili is great when garnished with sour cream, chives, lime wedges, and cilantro.

This is great! I followed the recipe with one exception...I used red kidney beans in lieu of pinto beans. The recipe is wonderful. It is truly comfort food with you're looking for something to keep you warm on a cool evening. Enjoy!

I think this recipe is excellent.  I made it several years ago and got back on here to find the recipe. I was so excited that I was able to find it again. I leave it in the crockpot all day and by dinner mmmmm! Paired with some homemade cinnamon rolls it is a family favorite!

My daughter and her friends made this and none were impressed. The cumin overpowered the dish, it tasted like canned tomato soup and it was way too thin. Chili is supposed to be thick and hearty like a stew, not a soup.

This chili ended up "the best ever", with a few modifications. It started out too soupy, so I simmered it, uncovered, for three hours. I used three tbsp. chili powder and it was plenty spicy. Didn't use beans. Instead of all beef, I used a pound of ground pork and a half pound of ground beef. One thing I'll do different next time is omit the salt, as it was a bit salty. Still, it was the best ever!

Full TBSP of ground cumin on 1# of meat is pretty strong. Onion, if fresh is better lightly sauteed. To limit tomato flavor and its acidity try 1/cup of strong coffee. You will be surprised. If 2cans of beans are used, make 1of them the dark red beans. It ads flavor, texture and color.

I made this tonight for dinner. I usually dont change a recipe first time making it, but this time i did. I like it a lot but for me and hubby I knew all that red pepper would be to much for me, and so i did 1/2 tsp and also i put in one can of  broth becuz it seemed like 2 would be  to much, a dash of cayenne and I used ground beef and some italian mild sausage also. was just the right kick for us. will make again

Good recipe! Modifies well- I doubled the meat and used a combo of ground beef and ground turkey.  I didn't double the wet ingredients, more like 2/3 double.  I used 2 cans tomato soup, 2 cans diced tomatoes, 1/2 bottle of beer, no chx broth.  It was really good and our non-adventurous friend loved it.  This is the kind of recipe that wins chili cookoffs- good enough to please everyone! Thanks!

Very good! I did as others did, and cut the broth in half, added a half can of beer, and I didn't have any Pinto beans, but I had Kidney beans, so I used that. I also didn't have any chili powder and it still turned out great. I browned meat and onions, then threw everything in the slow cooker on low for 3 hours. Hubby even asked me to save the leftovers which is "the" sign that he loved it!! Thanks

Very good.  As most others did I slightly altered the recipe.  I added 2 lbs of ground beef, substituted beef broth for the chicken broth and sub'd one large can of diced tomatoes for one can of the tomato soup.  Made this for super bowl and everyone loved it.  Perfect amt of spices even for my hubby who likes everything super spicy hot.  I did this in the crock on high for 4 hrs and it was great.  Would definitely make again.

All I can say is I'm glad I don't live in Indiana if this is how Hoosier's enjoy chili. I should have known better, tomato soup and chicken stock don't belong in chili in the first place. I decided to try it again, only this time changing a few things around per other reveiwers comments, it turned out somewhat respectable, but certainly not the best I've ever had. Sorry Justin, I'm tossing this recipe. I guess I'll have to post my own recipe.

Wonderful!!  Ihave made this over & over and shared with several folks who love it as much.  It IS rather thin but this can be changed by using the juice/paste that comes in cans of Pinto Beans. I love it both ways!!  Yummm

Served this up for Superbowl Sunday, and it was a hit! I have some pretty picky chili eaters in my family, but even our die-hard texan had to admit this was pretty darn good chili! It was super easy, and with my new reynolds wrap slow cooker bags, clean-up was a cinch! Now if only the Seahawks had won....

We made this for a chili cookoff at church today.  We made per recipe except we cut the chili powder to 3 tablespoons as we had read that it was over powering.  Even with three tablespoons it was overpowering, and didn't even taste like chili.

LOVED IT!!! Seriously, I had a hard time sharing with anyone.  Those who I did share it with either loved it as well or loved it but said it was too spicy.  I opted to put the cayenne powder in it and those who complained aren't big on spicy foods.  They said they really wanted the recipe, but would leave out the cayenne.  Either way I, and they, highly recommend you try this!

Tried this recipe for the holidays and it was a hit! I used diced tomatoes instead of crush which made it soupy.  I added extra meat and a little sausage for an extra tang.  However, I wouldnt recommend the sausage because the chili is flavorful enough.  It was so good and my friends couldnt figure out the secret ingredient.  Next time, I will stick with the recipe and use crush tomatoes to give it more texture and leave out the sausage and add more vegetables such as green peppers and tomatoes. This is a hearty meal thats sure to warm the soul.

Hot Dang!  This is some good chili, even for a Yankee in Indiana, Ha.  Be careful with the cayenne though, I made a double batch and put a T in it and burned for days.  Next time I'll use kidney beans, more meat and less broth.

Great chili!  The only change I made was I used one can kidney beans and one can pinto beans.  I made this with the amusement park cornbread (here on recipenotes) and it was a great dinner for a cold south texas night.  Will definitely keep this recipe.  Thank you!

The first words out of my husbands mouth when he tasted this chili was "YUM"!  This is so easy and soooooooooo good. My family loves another chili recipe on this site but I think its just been out done.   I used ground round to keep the fat content down.  This is a 5 star recipe not just on taste but on how how easy it is!

Made this chili last night - wow!  The only difference I had was that I made small cubes of beef out of a roast, I didn't have ground, and it was fabulous.  The meat turned out tender, and what flavour!  One of those things you can't stop eating, even though it's spicy.  My husband loved it!  Great for a cold Canadian evening!

My husband and my in-laws absolutly loved this chili. It has some great flavor to it, didn't change much but left out 1 tablespoon of the chili powder and added a little extra cumin. I also added some green pepper and mushrooms(His family is mushroom crazy). Will definitly make this again, woderful recipe.

Look no further. There are a ton of chili recipe's on this site, and I have tried a lot of them. This is by far the best one out there. Planned on taking this to my aunt's birthday party but we ate it the night before, next time the recipe gets doubled.

Excellent chili! I used a can of pinto and a can or red kidney. Next time I'll throw a can of peeled whole tomotos to suit our taste. I didn't measure any of the seasoning, just measured by eye and spiced it up to our taste. I didn't have cumin and used chili powder instead. The soup makes it an addicting chili that is delicious!

Who'd have thought... tomato soup and chicken broth in chili???... could taste so good?!  My husband loved this recipe.  Next time, I may add more onion and maybe some green pepper.

This chili was pretty good, but not a favorite of ours. I thought it had too much of a tomato taste, or at least more than I like. All three of my boys did eat it without complaining though. Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe has become "my recipe" for chili.  I tried a lot of recipes before I settled on this one.  This is not really a thick recipe, but my favorite part of the soup is the broth part anyway.  We cut way back on the chili powder because the kids were having a hard time eating it.  Other than that, keep the recipe the way it is.

I was looking for something a little different than my own recipe. This is perfect- surprisingly sweet and savory at the same tame. The only modification was that I didn't add the salt. For me, there's enough in the tomatoes and stock. This is a keeper.

Darned good chili Justin. I thought this was going to be a boring bland chili wit the soup, but it was far from it. It did turn out very thin though and we would have liked it much thicker. I let this simmer for a couple of hours and served it with spaghetti, corn chips, sour cream, cheddar/MJ cheese and chopped onions so everyone could personalize their own meal. It had a little kick but wasn't hot. We'd rate it medium with an attitude. This would be great for camping as it takes few ingredients and all are pantry staples. Thanks Justin for the great recipe. I'll fix this again.

Excellent on a cool day.  I've made this about 20 times, and it always turned out wonderful!  Don't be afraid to add some extra ingredients such as veggies or coffee, if you cook in the slow cooker.

My husband always used to RAVE about his mom's chili...but this recipe shut him up really quickly! ;)  It's not a super thick chili-more like a soup-but it packs a lot of flavor!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe although my husband recommended adding a can of baked beans.

This chili is awesome!  I followed it exactly as written but was naughty and added a few things: garlic, black beans, and ground sausage.  It made so much that I froze some to use later and it was even better the second time around. From here on out, this is my official chili recipe.  Easy and delicious!

I gave this 4 stars because I had to change the recipe a bit.  It was too soupy as is so I added a can of tomato paste, another pound of ground beef and used only one can of chicken broth. I added 3/4 of a Corona beer.  It is a fabulous chili with great taste and a kick!

Awesome start to a chili that continually "WOWs" my superbowl party guests. My modifications to make it less soupy, more hearty?  Small cubes of steak instead of ground beef, and more of it (like double).  Halve the chicken stock. Make half the tomatoes diced instead of all crushed. Mix up the beans with some tougher dark red kidneys.

Itmay be a regional thing, but I believe that chili should be THICK and meaty.  I followed the recipe as written for the first time, but now I know how I will change it.  There is not enough meat in it and it is way too soupy.  The canned tomato soup gives it a sweetness that is unexpected and I'm not so sure that is a good thing.  I only used 3 tablespoons of the chili powder and none of the cayenne pepper.  It definitely has a spicy kick.  Next time I will follow the advice of the other posters, less chicken broth, more meat, garlic, and maybe some beer!  As for now, it will be served over pasta, but next time, hopefully it will be the thick, meaty chili that I come to expect.

wow you werent kidding this chili is SUPER hot! and I didnt even add any cayenne.  I may decrease the amount of chili powder by 2 TBSP, and I used drained chili beans instead of pinto, but it turned out very good just super hot. I also used rotel tomatoes with green chilis instead of crushed tomatoes so that could be why it was hot as well.  Thanks Justin!

After trying many different recipes this one has been our favorite & I've made it many, many times. Everyone says it's the best they've had. Like other reviewers suggested, I cut back on the chicken broth. I also double the meat because we like our chili meaty.

This is the best chili recipe I think I've ever made, & I even eliminated the red pepper flakes & chili powder to please my family's bland palates.

A delicious chili recipe!  Good for those who don't like beans in theirs.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the flavor was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a tastier chili recipe to try and I have to tell you I love this chili. My husband actually came home from work to have this for lunch and that says alot! I did change a few things, I took out one can of tomato soup and added diced tomatoes with chiles, I also took out one can of chicken broth and added a half bottle of beer and I added a pound of meat. The spices were just the right combination. I definitely recommend this recipe.

One of the best chilis I have ever had, besides my mom's.  This chili has quite a punch to it, so be careful with the cayenne pepper.  My husband and I usually both have to eat this with a Kleenex near by but that's the way we like it!

This was pretty good chili, but not spectacular.  It was easy to make, lasted well in a crock pot, and was just about the right heat for a party.

The best chili recipe I've found - although it was a little thin.  Maybe one less can of chicken broth would do the trick.  My brother, husband and kids all loved it, and I will definitely make Justin's Hoosier Daddy Chili again!

I'm soooo glad I made this.  Perfect.  It is a little scary when you first add the soup and broth,it does look like soup, but it cooked down quite a bit and was just perfect.  Thank you, thank you.

This chili has a good flavor but was WAY too watery.  I added three cans of tomato paste to try to correct it, but it still looks more like chili soup.  Definitely cut back on the broth!

Man, this is good!  I omitted the cayenne pepper.  Cooked everything else just as recipe said.  It came out perfect.  Just the right amount of heat.  Not too hot, but has a kick!  If you like it even spicier, just add the cayenne pepper as suggested.  It was a little watery, but after I added crushed corn chips and shredded cheese (my personal favorite toppings), it was just right!  This is a new favorite in my chili file!

Great recipe.  Easy but reduced the amount of broth.  Also I am a garlic fan so I added 4 cloves of garlic to spice it up.

My goodness 5 tablespoons of chili powder sounded like too much, so I used 2.  Used one can pinto and one can kidney.  Used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 sasauge (will just use all beef next time). The reason I am not giving 5 stars is because it's a rather runny chili; otherwise, the taste is pretty darn good! P.S. The pictures are pretty, but I was wondering who serves chili on a plate? Oh I guess that just might be an illusion, sorry!

The absolute best chili I think I ever ate, let alone cooked.  I doubled the amount of kidney beans used in this recipe because I love kidney beans but other than that, stayed exact to directions.  Thanks so much, I finally beat out my fiancee's recipe even in his opinion!  Yaay, thanks for sharing this one!

Definitely a big hit. I tripled the recipe for a Super Bowl party and there was hardly any left. Only change I made was to add one bottle of beer. If you scale up a lot, I would recommend decreasing the amount of chicken broth or it will end up too thin.

Good Chili.  It tastes a lot like my mom's.  Some of us added a little bit of spaghetti to cut the heat.  I cut the beans to 1 can and the chili powder to 1 tbsp and it still had a kick. Family said it's a keeper.

Just made this the other night for a church function.  Awesome!!  There are just two factors you look at depending on how like your chili.  If you like it thinner, you could leave out 1 or both cans of chicken broth and if you like it not so spicy, definitely watch how much chili powder you put in there.  I put 2tbs in there and that was enough for me.

This chili was outstanding!!!  Everyone who tried it loved it!  I think next time I will add more stuff to it, maybe more meat, green peppers but the flavor was out of this world.  Also, I didn't add the cayenne pepper at the end.  I thought it was spicy enough on it's own already.  This is a keeper and I will be serving this many more times!  Thank you!

Best chili I ever made,  never followed a recipe in the past for chili and now I will only make 'hoosier daddy chili'.  I only used about 2-3 Tbs of chili powder, and my only additions were celery and pan fried mushrooms( after chili was made)    thanks for the recipe,  awesome

I made this last night and even my 4 & 7 year old kids, who normally don't like chili, gobbled it up.  My husband went back for 2nds.
I followed the recipe exactly, except for leaving out the cayenne all together, since my kids are sensitive to spicy foods.  The red pepper flakes gave it just enough, kick on it's own, without being overwhelming.

Sorry to be the one to break the string of 5 stars but this chili just is not all that great. It is ok. but that's about it.  The first tine I made it  I followed the recipe exactly and was very dissapointed.  Tried it again using alarge onion, an extra half poubd of ground beef,  breef broth instead of chicken stock,  an extra can of crushed tomatoes.  I also added the chili powder 1 tbsp. at a time, using only about 4 tbsp. total.  Still not the best chili ever but better.  Would suggest googling Amigo's chili for a quick, really good basic chili.

Tasty chili!
I don't care for beans & there were too many in this recipe for me to pick out.  Next time I will probably use half the beans and double the meat.

extremely great chili recipe. So simple to make, made me wonder why I haven't been using chicken broth in chili before, adds a very rich component to the finished product. Try this one, you'll be glad you did. Thanks Justin :-)

Wow! This Chili's got some punch to it.  I can honestly say I have never eaten a Chili with more flavor than this. I used 2 pounds of lean ground beef and added extra beans and it was suited towards my family's taste.  Simply a great recipe.

Took this to a Chili cook-off we had at work and it won 1st place.  It was the only chili we ran out of, I actually had to make more and bring it in the next night.  I left out the beans and added some chipotle chili peppers to my tasting.  My family also loves it, gonna have to be the new family recipe, thanks for the recipe.

The first time I made this it was a bit thin for our liking. Now the only thing I change is using half the broth. We love it. It's a staple in this house

Delicious! (And dairy/soy free!)
Next time I make it I think I'll try doubling the meat and chopped tomatoes to make it thicker, but it really is delicious all on its own.

This recipe is very simple to make, and most people will have all ingriedents in their pantry. The spices were perfect as the recipe was written, the only addition I made was to cut back on the chicken stock and add red wine. I will make this chile again and again, very good. Thank you to whoever submitted it.

This was sooo good. I did put a can of rotel and chili seasoned diced tomato's instead of the crushed toms. I used two pounds of burger and extra beans for a large pot. Not to thick not to thin, just perfect. My  new go to chili recipe.

I owned a Deli for 20 years.... This is how I made my chili... It is the best!!!  Who would think living in Florida that people would want chili everyday when it was 98 degrees outside, sold out everyday. My mother taught me this recipe, she was making it 55 years ago. Thank you for posting it.. I'm sure it will get many 5 star ratings.

I have to say that although I'm from Indiana, I had never heard of making chili with tomato soup, so I tried it.  It was great.  I used ground bison because of personal preference and decreased the chili powder a bit.  Some people commented that it was too thin but I liked that it was more of a soup consistency.  It may not be authentic or gourmet but I liked it and that's what matters.

This was good, but I tweaked it. I only added 1 cup of chicken broth/soup and I cooked the large, chopped onion in the chicken broth/soup before adding that to the Crock Pot. Two cans of chicken soup would have made this soup - not chili. I added 2 T. Chopped Jarred Garlic and extra Cumin. I did not add the salt and it doesn't need it! It was good. Hubby wanted more heat, I thought it was fine as written. This would be a good chili recipe to take on a cabin trip where traveling with canned goods makes things easier. It was a good dinner. Thanks for the recipe!

Ive made some adjustments to this chili and how thick I make it... the addition of the chicken broth really makes it more "soupy" style, and we like our chili pretty thick so I add very little, if any. However, this has become our household's go-to recipie for chili! 

Added bonus is that it is Gluten Free, which is big for our home!

This is a very "safe" chili w/ lots of potential. I ommited the broth & added garlic w/ the onions - great consistency. I like a little kick & thought this recipe was missing that (did only use 4 Tbsp. chili powder, next time stick w/ 5). Overall, "family-friendly" recipe but not for your die-hard chili fan's.

Bit too much heat for me (and I like things hot!)  Good, easy to make, but could have turned the heat down, or I wish I had some cheese and sour cream to go with it.

I have made this chili MANY times over the past 3 1/2 years and it is always delicious. I have done away with every other recipe I have ever had for chili and I never entertain the notion for any new ones. I have made substitutions depending on what I have on hand. I don't eat meat, so I completely omit it, using more beans as well as substituting vegetable broth for the chicken broth. I cut the heat down a bit just because that it to my liking. I wish my "small town" had a Chili cookoff....I would definitely enter!!! Thanks for the great recipe Justin!

My family loved this. I did change a few things. Instead of ground beef I used ground turkey( no one knew the difference). I used 1 teaspoon of chili powder and it still was pretty spicy.  Great recipe!!!

this is our favorite chili recipe ever!  I make it for everybody.  I even sometimes make it vegan by omitting the ground beef and substituting vegetable stock for the chicken stock.  It is fantastic!

I've been making this chili for probably over 2 years now & my husband and I love it! I only use about a 1/4 can broth and throw in 1/4 can beer. I also skip the salt and the beans. I've had many compliments on it and have passed on the recipe multiple times.

Great recipe--I make this often.  I had to decrease the peppers a tidbit for hubby, but I love the blend!  Everyone at work loves it, too!!

This was a good recipe.  I made it exactly as called for except instead of chopped onion I used onion powder (preference).  It tasted great.  It wasn't really amazing but it was a good standard chili recipe.

I've tried a few chili recipes, and I don't know that I've hit on "THE" chili recipe for me. But this is a good one, and I would make it again. Plus, I liked that it was so easy to make. It may seem too soupy at first, but believe me it thickens up. And it's SPICY!

A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!!!!!!! I have been looking for a delicious but quick and easy type of chili to make and this is the one! I did follow some other suggestions by substituting beer for the chicken broth and adding 1 can of kidney and pinto beans. The pinto beans that I bought had jalapenos added which helped kick the flavor up. I made a big pot of this chili and it was gone in minutes! Thank you Justin's daddy; this is a definite keeper!!!! : >

Good chili - I am one that likes a thicker chili & would recommend using less chicken broth. Also, I used less than 2 T. chili powder & no red pepper flakes, but 1/2 t. cayenne pepper which made it way too spicy for our family. It had good flavor, and I will try it again with modifications - I only gave it 4 stars - still very good, but not knock-your-socks-off good!

This was delicious.  I only added 3 tablespoons of chili powder also, and it was plenty!  Everyone really liked it.  It was fairly simple, not having much variety of ingredients, but the flavor was very good.

This was my first time making chili, and it came out absolutely fabulous! I did make a few alterations. I didn't put in the red pepper flakes, and I cut back on a lot of the spices. I left out the chicken broth too. I think putting that in would have made the dish too soupy.

This chili was too thin for me!  After cooking the ground beef and onions, I cooked it in the crock pot instead of the stove, so I didn't follow the directions exactly.  Also, I had to add much more spice.  However, the next day the chili was great and had thickened perfectly.

Had reservations about chili made with tomato soup (this just seemed wrong to me) and chicken broth. Trust Justin's daddy; I followed the recipe, but added 2 cans of black beans and a bit more chili powder. Great consistency (I think it's the soup) and just a bit spicy. At out chili cook-off, beat Fusion Chili and Quick Chili I (the defending champion).

This chili is good, but not outstanding.  I halved the recipe for 2 people, but otherwise made it exactly as stated.  I agree with other reviewers, the chili powder is very overwhelming.  All I could taste was tomotoe soup and chili powder.  I also thought it was a bit too thin.  I like more of a thick chili.  Give it a try, you might like it, but it didn't knock my socks off.

This is a great chili recipe!! No need to cook it a day ahead for flavor. It's yummy right away. My husband even wanted to know what I did to make the chili so good. I only used half the crushed red pepper and no paprika or added salt. We like spicy but not firey and this was very flavorful. The only change I think I would make is to use diced tomatoes instead of crushed next time to make it a little thicker. Thanks for a great new chili recipe!

Yum. This was very good. Used beef broth, 1-can pinto beans, and no cayenne. To do again, I would cut the chili powder to around 3 T; a bit hot for me.

I liked the texture and the ingredients  and I do like spicy food. I thought the chili powder just overwhelmed the entire recipe .I will make this again and start out with 2 tbspns of chili powder and adjust accordingly. It does seem like it would be very good. The Chili powder taste was way too strong for us.

This chili was great. Just the right amount of spice when I added the cayenne pepper.  The only thing I would do differently is completely take out the chicken broth.  I like a thicker chili so I left out one can when I made it, but it was still a little too thin for me. So next time I think I will take it out all together.  The tomato soup and crushed tomato made it thin enough for me. Other than it being to thin for me personally, It was great.

This recipe is deadly delicious!! I'm not a fan of tomato soup but I'm a gambling woman and it turned out awesome.  This Chili had a rich looking sauce and it had a creamy texture to it. It's the best chili I ever made!!!

I came upon this recipe while doing an ingredient search.  I had 5 cans of tomato soup and 5 cans of pinto beans in my cupboard and I was desperate to make some room in there!!  So I made this chili yesterday....What great color!!  When the recipe called for 5 tablespoons of chili powder, I thought it MUST be a mistake.. But no..   This just may be the best chili I have ever made, and I have tried many...

As someone in search of chili perfection, each time I make a different chili recipe, I take what I liked the best about it, and add it to the next recipe I try. My most favorite thing about this particular recipe was the cumin - I LOVED the flavor. I must admit though I really do like a little cocoa and cinnamon in my chili. This was very good, however, even though I did need to add quite a bit more chilli powder and cayenne to achieve the kind of heat we like (perhaps my spices were a little bit old). But anyway, thanks!

Great taste. Added a little spagetti made it even better.

I was a little skeptical about this dish but it turned out great.  Even my kids who eat nothing loved it. I will definintly make this again, it is a keeper.

I knew I'd need to adjust the amount of cumin & chili powder in this recipe.  I only used 1 tsp. cumin & 2 Tbsp of chili powder & it still was pretty spicy for my family's taste.  I'm planning to make this again though & just adjust the seasoning a little more.
