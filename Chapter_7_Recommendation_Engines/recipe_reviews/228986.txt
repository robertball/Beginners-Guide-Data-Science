Found this to be an interesting combo but didn't really care for the overall taste.  Using cooked shrimp can be a convenience, but if you are seeking for a fresh tasting salad, put a little more effort and cook fresh shrimp.  That way, you won't be biting into a rubberish shrimp.  I used spanish olives because I didn't want to open up a can of black olives, however, I wouldn't add it next time.  I also whisked in minced red onions with the vinegar/oil dressing for a little boost on flavor.
