As the author of a cookbook, I would say this one is one of my favorites!
It is NOT a hard cookie, rather a chewy one.
You can't go wrong with this one.
Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy...Just don't think about the fat. :-)
I give it 6 stars!

I made this for a friend.  She made the cookies with her 4 year old nephew and reported back that they came back hard as rocks.  She said they may have overworked the dough because she was letting the kid form the cookies and he played around with the dough a lot.  I tasted one of her cookies and the taste was delicious but the cookie was hard as a rock.  I may give this one another try.
