This is probabbly the best salad of this type we have ever eaten. We have eaten in many highly rated restaurants throuout this country and foreign.The cutting up of everything took time but was well worth it.The dressing was great.

Good recipe.  I love that it is different from the rest of the summer salads that you eat year after year.  I found that there should be more veggies.  Next time I make this recipe I will double the zucchini and peppers.  Great for a picnic.

This recipe is superb! I love it! I added a 7.5 oz jar of Grilled Marinated Artichoke Hearts, an English Cucumber, an extra clove of garlic and some extra olives! Instead of regular feta, I used the garlic and herb kind. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone! I will make this salad often!

Thank-you so much for this recipe!  It was amazing and everyone loved it!  :)  

I only made a couple of changes...  I didn't put in any olives.  I used cocktail shrimp instead of the larger ones.  I also added in a little bit of honey to the vinaigrette and instead of two tablespoons of the dijon mustard, I used 1 tablespoon dijon mustard, and then 1 tablespoon of spicy mustard instead (make sure you put it in a jar or something so that you can shake it up because that's the best way to mix it!).  It turned out great!  :)

Wow this was excellent and very colorful.  I made a couple substitutions:  white wine vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar and a small can of sliced black olives instead of Kalamata.  Will definitely make again and for social functions.

This was a very tasty and pretty dish to present. I'm a grill-maniac, and the veggies were excellent grilled on our propane grill, they were even sufficiently yummy on day 2 as leftovers. My husband and I are partial to lemon, so  I used some lemon juice and Johnny Salt to season the prawns prior to grilling. For those who prefer warm meals, this pasta salad also tastes great when gently heated in the microwave, not more than about 45 sec-1min depending on microwave power.

This salad had non-salad eaters coming back for seconds!  Fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the oregano.

FANTASTIC! I made this to serve to guests.  Having everything prepped and ready to toss made dinner so easy. It tastes fresh and fabulous and was a huge hit...even with the kids.  I did substitute bowtie pasta for the shells, and didn't slice the shrimp, but otherwise kept the recipe the same.  It will be a new Summer staple at our house!

This was AMAZING!  I had to OMIT the yellow bellpepper b/c for some reason i thought I read "yellow summer squash" so that was put in its place and it was divine.  The dressing is really what makes this the BEST!   

SHRIMP:  I doubled the dressing and threw about 1/2 cups worth over the shrimp before stir-frying. So the shrimp are nice and flavorful like the dressing.

I have not tried the recipe sorry but I hate it when you have recipes listed under Healthy that are obviously not. This is high in calories, fat, cholesterol, sodium you name it. Get your act together and list stuff under the right category.

Wonderful summer salad! I followed the recipe exactly and everyone ate it and asked for seconds and the recipe! I think next time I will add some marinated artichoke hearts. The broiling of the zucchin and yellow pepper really brings out the flavor.

It was a hot day so I didn't want to start the oven to roast the veggies so I used chopped cucumbers, red peppers, celery, red onion, and halved grape tomatoes.  Otherwise I followed the rest exactly.  This was really delicious and my husband also raved about it.  I was skeptical about the dijon dressing for it but it is really perfect!  This recipe would also be good with another type of meat besides shrimp.

This is super delicious! One tip I can add, is that it really needs to be tossed in the dressing right before serving. I had it last night for dinner and it was awesome! Today, it isn't nearly as saucy or flavorful as it was last night. So, if you are making ahead, add the sauce right before serving!!

I made this for the 4th of July and it was a big hit!  My hubby loved it.  The only thing I changed was I did not have any rice vinegar so I used red wine vinegar.  Will definitely make again.

This salad was a big hit at our family party and I will definitely make again. It is colorful as well as tasty. I cut back a little on the oil in the dressing, used more grape tomatoes, red and yellow peppers, and crinkle cut crosswise the zucchini for interest. I threw in some of my fresh basil slivered.  When it became obvious that one gallon bag was not going to do it, I bagged the pasta seperate from the rest. To the vetetable/shrimp bag, I poured in about one third of the dressing to marinade them a little. Takes some work, but well worth it - very easy to transport and put together just before serving.

Didn't broil the vegetables - sautéed instead. Used black olives, a white onion & forgot the oregano. DELICIOUS! Makes a huge salad. Way more than 6 servings - probably closer to 10-12.

This is probably the best pasta salad I have ever made or eaten. My family and friends love it when I make this salad. The dressing is also delicious over mixed greens with olives and feta cheese. Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe! Since I'm on a low-carb thing, I omitted the pasta and added some blanched green beans instead (I've found that green and wax beans make a great pasta substitute!). I only had a bag of frozen raw shrimp, so I marinated the shrimp in a little olive oil, lemon, cumin and garlic for about 30 minutes, then grilled them on my electric grill along with the bell pepper, onion and zucchini. The dressing was perfect, and the flavor combination was just yummy. Thanks for sharing this one!

I have brought this to numerous pot-lucks, and it's always a winner. I typically make it without the shrimp. It's a little labour intensive, but it's well worth the effort - very tasty.

I made this recipe for a July 4th cookout. It turned out phenomenal!  I took the advice of someone and added 1/3 cup of honey to the dressing.--IT WAS SO GOOD!..  Also, I didn't use any shrimp. I was unsure of shrimp allergies.  
Everyone wants the recipe.  Thank you for a great pasta salad that is different and delicious.

I kept scratching my head when I saw that was supposed to take grilled veggies and throw them in a cold pasta salad. I could just see how mushy they would get.  So, getting creative and knowing the types of food Greek food usually consists of, I modified the recipe to put in fresh cut cucumbers and omit the grilled veggies.  I also used Wish Bone Romano Basil dressing. I hated the dressing that is called to go with this recipe.  It was not appealing at all.  I took this to a potluck and everyone enjoyed it!!

We loved this.  I used whole wheat shells and skipped the shrimp and used more veggies (to use as a side dish at a picnic).  Thanks!  Will use again.

This was a really good pasta salad recipe but I might do a couple of things different next time.  To this recipe I added: (1) about a tablespoon of dried oregano.  Greek salad isn't Greek salad without it.  (2) two small jars of artichoke hearts thanks to another reviewer. (3) roasted the red onion with the other veggies because I don't like it raw. Things I would do differently: Roasting the zucchini in large chunks didn't work, because as the zucchini charred out the outside, it retained all its moisture in the inside and it was quite soggy.  I would cut up all of the vegetables into the bit sized portions and roast them that way, so they release their moisture in the oven.  Finally, this is named a "Greek" salad.  Living in a greek area of the city I don't know how accurate that would be (especially due to the fact that the recipe is a DIJON dressing).  Nevertheless, it is a really good pasta salad in its own right, and I'll definitely make it again.  The recipe also suggests to keep all the ingredients separate until serving, but the leftovers the next day were great (sans the soggy zucchini).  I wouldn't worry about keeping the dressing separate.

I think it is safe to say that this is the single best recipe I have ever tried off this site.  I stumbled across it in the summer, and have been making it all the time ever since.  I make a few changes now and again based on what's in my fridge, and to cut the fat, but it is just an incredible salad.  I make it as often as we can squeeze shrimp into the budget!  If it's just for us, I mix it all together and have it in the fridge, ready to go; if it's for clients or company I assemble right before serving.

Followed everything as is except - substituted whole wheat penne pasta for shells (I only had the ww penne on hand) and used less oil in vinaigrette. Great recipe.

This was great!  I recommend grilling the veggies in the summer-it keeps the house cooler and has more flavor.  
I hate to admit that I made changes, but I followed other reviewers advice and made changes, and, in giving it a 5, I think it would be even better with the original ingredients.   I wasn't sure if seasoned or non-seasoned rice vinegar was called for, so I went with the white wine vin.  I also added some honey.  Since I was out of red bell pepper, I used green.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome.  I think it would be good with chicken or shrimp.  It was great to use homegrown veggies too.  It was a nice, light (though not low-cal) meal for summer.  Enjoy!

I get compliments whenever I make this dish. If you can, definitely cook the zucchini and the pepper on the grill. It really makes a difference! Try with grilled chicken if you don't have shrimps.

I made 20 servings of this for 4th of July, and I had NO leftovers. None (much to my disappointment!) It was the best dish served at the party. I used Barilla whole wheat pasta (with added omega 3s!).  I prepared the pasta and cut the veggies and shrimp the night before the party.  The day of the party, I roasted the zuccini and peppers in the oven (to reduce cooking time) and then mixed everything into 2 very large bowls.  I did not have rice wine vinegar, so I used apple cider vineger and white vinegar.  Many of my guests do not like pasta salad, but could not get enough of this delicious salad. It's colorful, flavorful, and kid friendly. I highly recommend.

I made this salad for my small group and it received many compliments.  The serving size is incorrect.  It serves at least 12 as a side dish.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used canned black olives instead of Kalamata, a green pepper instead of yellow and I forgot the oregano.  The seasoning was a little bland for my tastebuds.  Next time I will add more salt and pepper.  I loved the idea of broiling or grilling the peppers and zucchini.  I will make this again.

WOW! That is the BEST pasta salad I have ever tasted! I can not believe that I cooked it myself! It is better then any I've even had at a restaurant! The only thing I changed was, I did not have Dijon mustard I had creamy Dijon, and I used black canned olives instead of Katamata to save on money. DELICIOUS!

Incredible! I had never made a pasta salad before, but was asked to bring one to my sister's bridal shower. I left out the shrimp due to personal preferance, but left everything else as written. It was perfect, colorful, and flavorful. I was worried that I would end up with too much dressing because it seemed like a lot while I was making it but it turned out to be just the right amount. Guests raved, and there was an arguement over who got to take home the leftovers. Absolutely will make again, its my new "go to" pasta salad. Yummy!

This is amazing! I am so glad I took the time to try this recipe. I made it to bring to a potluck so I grilled up the veggies and assembled the salad before we left. I ate a large amount of it before I even left the house. I did use a combination of garlic and lemon flavoured olive oils in the dressing and it gave it even more zip. I'm thinking next time I might grill up some fresh shrimp and serve it on the side instead of in the salad. I will definitely be making this again.

My husband does not typically favor pasta salad (especially for a meal), but he did say that this was the best he's ever had. The only thing I altered was using whole wheat fusilli pasta instead of shells and I didn't use the entire amount of dressing prepared.  But BE WARNED! This is a pretty potent recipe (with the garlic/onions). Don't plan on breathing on anyone for a while. If I make it again, I will try to saute (or grill w/ the other veggies) the onions or cut back on the amount of raw onions. And I love onions.

This salad was fantastic!  Everyone loved it and wanted seconds.  I made it a lower calorie version. I reduced the oil in the vinaigrette to 1 tablespoon, and the oil for the broiled veggies to 1 teaspoon. I will probably reduce the feta to 1/2 cup next time and add a few more veggies. Even with the oil reduction, the vinaigrette was the perfect amount. I will make this often.

LOVE this dressing. I didn't use salt and didn't use as much oil (I love a tangy dressing that makes you pucker a little bit). I like garlic powder in it, so the dressing is smooth, no chunks. Also, I used half rice wine vinegar and half red wine vinegar. I used it as a marinade for veggie kebobs and also over salad. I am making a tortellini pasta salad this wknd and CANT wait to try it with this tangy dressing. YUM

A perfect hot weather dinner!  I followed the recipe exactly as it was printed and it turned out perfect.  There wasn't much to clean up since I mixed the dressing right in a screw-top jar, put the roasted veges. on the cutting board to cool, and used the roasting cookie sheet to then cool the pasta.  I put all of the other ingredients directly in a gallon zip lock bag instead of dirtying another bowl and would make traveling easier.  I will definately make this again.

Delicious!  The only changes that I made was to only use half the oil in the dressing and added in some artichoke hearts, which I broiled with the zucchini and peppers.  The dressing is delicious. This recipe is a keeper!  :)

This is a great summer pasta salad. I made this for a car club meet, everyone loved it. I grilled the zucchini and bell peppers out on grill instead of in broiler gives a great taste. My family loves this salad it a favorite in our house.

I think this is FANTASTIC!  My original rating was 4 stars, but I just tried some of these leftovers the next day,(adding the bottom of the bowl of leftover dressing), and I love it!  All of the good flavor of the dressing must have sunk to the bottom of the shaker.  One thing I would note for next time is NOT to slice the zucchini too thin.  I found the slices that were a little more than 1/4 inch were perfect for roasting.  If you slice it too thin it just cooks and becomes limp, nothing to dice up.  Delicious stuff that I will make again.

Delicious!  Made with shrimp the first time, then without.  Lasted longer for us without the shrimp already in it.

This was really good. I only used 1/2 pound of pasta (bowtie) and think if I used a pound I would definitely double everything unless you like it really heavy on the pasta. I didn't bother to cut the shrimp, seemed like a waste of time to me. If you want more shrimp per bite, just use a smaller variety. I might try some fresh basil next time. I served this for a main course for dinner but can definitely see bringing it to summer potlucks. Awesome.

Fantastic recipe!  I sliced the red onion and roasted it along with the veggies.  Delicious.  Best to use premium quality feta.  For best flavor serve immediately.  I'm wondering if the amount of oil in the salad could be reduced... going to try the next time I make the salad.  Definitely a keeper!

This...was SO good!  It was quite a bit of work to put it all together, but well worth it!  I made a few minor modifications;  used garlic wine vinegar, and forgot to add the oregano (which didn't matter one bit).  The combination of flavors is incredible.  Would be really good with some artichoke hearts thrown in.  I made this for dinner, and it was just as good the next day for lunch!

I made this tonight for a picnic tomorrow.  I "tried" it just to make sure it turned out.  YUM, YUM!  I'm SO not hungry but couldn't resist having a whole bowl!  Love the flavour!  This will be a regular in our house, even though I usually hate pasta salads!

This was very good.  I took a double recipe to a family gathering and it was gone before anything else.  I used Kraft Honey Dijon Vinaigrette dressing instead.  I tossed a little of it with the noodles when they were done, so they would stick.  I also tossed the veggies in the dressing before broiling to add more flavor.  Followed someone elses suggestion to add the dressing just before serving... so I added the remaining dressing.  I bet this can be done with Italian dressing as well.
THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!!!

Yummy!  This was quite good.  The dressing is very nice.  I don't care for olives and tomatoes, though, so I left them out.  I also added mushrooms and used green onions instead of red.  Thanks for sharing!

Revision!  Don't know what I did wrong the first time I made this, but this time around it was GREAT!  I doubled the recipe and did not have enough zucchini, so I added some fresh spinach and broccoli.  Delicious before even adding the dressing.  Previously:  "This was a very big disappointment...VERY oily and oniony, almost gloppy... "  NOT this time; I appologize for the former bad review!

This was great.  I followed the recipe exactly, but did not use as much oil for the dressing.  I do not think it was dry by doing that either.  Everyone enjoyed it.

I was looking for something easy to mix with some pasta and shrimp, and the dressing in this is perfect!  I just mixed up the dressing in a little bottle and kept it in the refrigerator to add to pasta salads the next few weeks, delicious!  I can't wait to try the recipe in full with the grilled veggies.

This is my favorite dish to take to a potluck, special event, ect.  I always get a compliment or someone asks for the recipe. It is great because, it can be a side dish or main dish if you like. Tri colored pasta gives it a nice look as well.

Made this for a summer party for 40 people (along with a baked   ham and other stuff).  On the test run, I decided the zuchini was too limp so switched to asparagus sliced at an angle into 1 1/2 inch size pieces. Also, love feta cheese and added 50% more.  I was able to make the recipe times 8 and put it in gallon plastic bags the day before.  Whenever I needed to replenish the buffet I just added the dressing as needed. Worked great, everyone loved it.

I’ve made this many times as written with rave reviews. It’s the Dijon dressing that does it. I’ve also used this as a base recipe:
No shrimp if I want it to be a side dish
Raw veggies instead of grilled when I’m lazy (cucumbers instead of grilled zucchini, and raw chopped pepper instead of grilled
Chopped fresh mozzarella instead of feta for picky peoples
Added artichoke hearts (yummy!)
Always great reviews and people wanting recipe. 
As I said-it’s the Dijon vinegrette that makes it.  Do your own thing, but use this dressing-it’s awesome

I made this for the teacher's Christmas luncheon and it was a big hit!  Costco has the best frozen raw shrimp for this.  I grilled the veggies in advance and poured half the dressing on after assembling and half right before serving the next day.  Very good and the leftovers kept well.  I didn't use the feta but next time I will

I absolutely love this recipe and I make it all the time for grill-outs and potluck dinners.  Usually I omit the shrimp, so its more of a side dish.  I also use only 1/2 pound of pasta... this gives it a better veggie/pasta ratio.  To step it up a notch, I grill the zucchini and pepper in the summer.  Lots of work but very colorful and impressive!

I made this recipe exactly as it is written and it was so good! The oregano is very important and it makes sense the last person stated it taste bland. It was alot of pasta salad though, I'd say 10 or so, 4 eat on it and there is still alot more left!

This recipe is so amazing that it should be kept a secret!  I've never tasted a better pasta salad.  The only thing I did differently was to double the shrimp, marinate it in Italian dressing, and then grill it.  I also made this salad the day before (with the dressing mixed in) and let it sit in the fridge so that the flavors would develop.

This was delicious.  I expecially loved the roasted vegetables. Next time I will add extra.  I added my dressing about an hour before.   I had leftovers which was my lunch for the next few days and it was even great as leftovers.

This was absolutely delicious.  Great flavor, great variety.  The only comment I'll make will be about portion sizes - the recipe says it will make 6 servings.  In the end, it makes for I guess about 7-8 lbs of food - I have no idea who these 6 people are, but my family of 5 most certainly could not have finished all at once, and we've actually had 2.5 days to work through this bowl.  So beware on that, otherwise, it is absolutely great.

I should have waited to put the dressing on just before serving but I did it a few hours before.  The dressing absorbed into the pasta and the flavour was weak after I did that.  It made too much for 5 people and we had lots of leftover so it would have absorbed anyway but it would have been better it I served it right have adding dressing.  We all thought it was "good" but I am moving on to the next recipe, too many to try.

SO GOOD! I omitted the shrimp, olives & zucchini, and added cucumbers.  Otherwise, I mostly stayed true to this recipe.  The Dijon dressing really makes this dish work - make extra! I also put a teaspoon or so of honey into the dressing and I agree that adding it just prior to serving is key.  Grilling the bell peppers added a fantastic flavor.  This recipe is a keeper!

Good pasta salad recipe - I think I'd marinate the shrimp a bit next time.

This salad is awesome and does not even need the dressing.  I use a 3 color pasta for extra flavor/color.

I am currently pregnant and I had to have type of vinagery pasta salad NOW! lol I just finished making it and it is chilling as I type but I couldn't keep my paws out of it as I was making it. I did use traditional greek salad veggies (cukes, tomatos, green peppers, red onion, etc) instead and tons of feta. The dressing is perfect for any type of pasta salad! I added a squirt of lemon juice to blend the oil and vinegar a bit better. I did notice a little bit of an oily texture afterwards so I splashed a bit more vinegar over top, stirred and voila! yum!

I took this to a baby shower and all ladies LOVED it! I did make a few changes but over all followed the recipe exactly. After preparing the salad dressing I marinated the shrimp in it for several hours as one poster mentioned. I also subbed cucumbers with zucchini b/c not in season. I also put about one tbs. honey to vinegerette. After broiling the pepper there was some burnt areas which I peeled off easily before chopping. Great recipe!

This was very good.  I took it to a pot luck and folks were going back for seconds and thirds.  It makes a large amount of salad and dressing.  I wasn't sure how much dressing the pasta would soak up so I used the entire amount.  It would have been perfect with 3/4 of the dressing.  I made no changes at all.  Very good recipe and different with the roasted veggies.  I think you could sub the veggies and protein out for something else to change up the flavors.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent recipe - We loved it.

I made the dijon vinaigrette exactly as written but "tweeked" the salad a bit.

 To the zucchini and pepper, I added a bit of thyme and a pinch of cayenne. I cooked them on the grill rather than the broiler and added a very small piece of soaked hickory to give light smoky flavor.

I used black olives rather than kalamata due to personal preference.

I also used a smaller shrimp (40 - 50 count) which eliminated the need to cut them in half.

Will make it again and often!
