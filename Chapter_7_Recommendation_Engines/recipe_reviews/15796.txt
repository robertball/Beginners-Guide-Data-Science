This is so easy, and it tastes great. Try it with cheesecake favor (Jello makes it) instant pudding, and you have and instant no-bake cheesecake. I also have made it with "sugar free" instant pudding, you just have to blend it more throughly, it still tastes great! Thanks Diane!

I took another reviewer's suggestion and used cheesecake instant pudding in this recipe instead of vanilla. I made my own graham cracker crust. We were divided on this recipe. Half of us loved it, the other half didn't care for it. If you are looking for a quick summer pie and love sour cream, this dessert is for you.

Wow! Talk about easy and delicious. My family has been bugging me to make a cheesecake and I found this recipe with no cooking, no waiting for cream cheese to soften, and almost no work! It tastes great! I usually keep a graham cracker crust on hand and various pudding mixes and a can or two of favorite pie fillings when they go on sale, and just happened to have bought a "buy one/get one" sour cream deal...Voila! Dessert! Just the perfect blend of sweet and tart! The whole family enjoyed it. Would be great to bring to a potluck dinner or holiday barbecue! Fantastic no bake goody for the heat of summer!

This pie was ok.  I used cherry pie filling and cheesecake flavored pudding. I'd prefer cream cheese to the sour cream.  Will try a different recipe, however this is a good alternative if you don't have sweetened condensed milk like I was missing.
