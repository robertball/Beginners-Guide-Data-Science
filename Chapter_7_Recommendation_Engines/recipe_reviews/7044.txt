All of my quickbread recipes that I have made in the past always stuck to the pan and came out all wrong using all the right instructions. I have made this pumpkin bread recipe twice now and it has come out perfectly every time.  Instead of Baking Powder I use one teaspoon of potato starch and one teaspoon baking soda as a replacement. It still makes a wonderful moist loaf for me to enjoy.

This recipe turned out nicely.  I doubled it and did one loaf and one pan of mini muffins for my kids.  It made 24 mini muffins baked for 12-15mins.  They came out perfect!  Thanks for sharing.  Will use again.

Moist and delicious! I used 1/3 cup of butter instead of shortening.  This has a great pumpkin flavor.  I added raisins, next time I'll add the nuts as well.  This is a very versitile recipe and takes no time at all.

This recipe was VERY tasty, but definitely does not have enough leavening. Mine came out more like a baked pudding than a bread. Next time, I recommend using baking powder, and increasing the amount to 1 tsp.

Great bread! I should have made 2 loaves because this loaf was gone by the end of the day. I didn't have any shortening so used 1/3C softened butter. I used 1/2tsp each cinnamon, ground cloves, nutmeg, & ginger. Out of milk too, I used 1/4C Half & Half. Simply delicious!

I made this with my 11 yr old son as it looked like something he could handle. It came out AWESOME! We doubled it to get two loaves and may have used too much pumpkin ( a whole large can!) but the texture was amazing. We're going to have make two more loaves for Thanksgiving as the ones we made tonight barely lasted 10 minutes!

I was looking for a great pumpkin bread in which to make all the time and I just found it.  I left out the raisins and nuts and it was superb!  I am planning on making this recipe for many years to come.

This has entered my top three favorite breads to make. The consistency, smell, texture and ease were all fantastic. I've only made it once so far and I did so without raisins. The next one will have raisins in it as I imagine they will compliment the pumpkin nicely.

Would've given more stars for the fab flavor, but the baking time seemed off tome - & I use an oven thermometer. I'm in Chicago, 597 feet above sea level - maybe altitude was a factor? Anyway, baked as directed but the middle was very wiggly, so I gave it another 15 minutes (checking after every 5 minutes) - while the bread was cooling, it collapsed inthe WAY undercooked center, but we ate it anyway - it was delicious! But the end pieces were more like a quick bread, while the middle was more like a Christmas steamed pudding. Also, it was VERY close to overflowing the loaf pan - if I hadn't placed the loaf pan on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet, it would've made a HUGE mess in my oven!

Loved it!  And that's really good considering I do not like pumpkin!  I used fresh pumpkin, not canned.  I doubled the recipe and for the last cup of flour I used wheat flour.  A very nicely spiced bread. Definitely will make again!  I did have to bake it between 20-30 min longer than what the instructions called for but not sure if that was due to the changes in ingredients I made.  And maybe my oven was a little cold to start.  Kids loved it too!

I LOVE this recipe.  I went with another reviewer's advice and made the 24 mini-muffins and a 9x5 loaf.  It is fluffy, pure pumpkin goodness.  Thanks for sharing!  God bless.  :)

Have made this recipe several times to use up my bumper crop of pumpkins.  Not too time consuming and a nice quickbread. Would probably make good muffins.

This bread is delicious! The only thing that bothers me is the pumpkin pie spice. I don't own it, and I had to guess with the seasonings. I love what I added (cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and ginger), but I don't know if I could duplicate the exact mixture again. Very moist bread. My husband loved it!

This bread came out very nice and moist. I used half a teaspoon each of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger. I also used 5 tablespoons of soft butter and half-and-half instead of milk. The nuts and raisins definitely brought it to the next level

i used this as a guide with my banana bread recipe.  the difference is i used 5T unsalted butter and 1 T lemon juice instead of shortening and milk.  i used 1T salt and 1 1/2 cups pumpkin puree, as called for in my bread recipe.  i did not have any pumpkin pie spice or cloves so i subsituted cinnamon and nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon each.  baked at 350 for 1 hour 5 min.  the bread came out excellent.  thank you for the spice suggestion and flouring the pan. i will definately make this again.

Moist but not too moist -- turned out perfect and cooked for just 50 min. Read the comments about it being too much like pudding. I'm betting that those folks used the entire can of pumpkin purée rather than just 8 oz (1cup) like the recipe says.

I just finished baking one. Too hot to try since it's midnight. I made it as instructed with the exception of adding "just" 2 tsp of cinnamon. Smells wonderful and can't wait to taste it for breakfast! *Edit* Just remembered, I didn't have shortening so used 1/3 cup of margarine.

Great bread, though I added some more spices and another half cup of pumpkin. Husband's workmates loved it.
