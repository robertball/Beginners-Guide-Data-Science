I love this recipe! I had Kheer for the first time yesterday at an Indian restaurant. I liked it so much that I immediately came home and started looking for a recipe.  I used this recipe and it was just as delicious as what I had at the restaurant. I made it almost exactly like the recipe except for just a couple of minor changes.  For example, I only had cardamom seeds in my pantry, so I crushed these and added approximately 1/2 of a teaspoon in place of the cardamom pods.  This worked out very well and gives it a delicious flavor.  The rose water is a very nice and subtle addition, but I'm sure the Kheer would still be delicious if you don't have any on hand.  I noticed that a previous reviewer thought that it needed more rice, but I think this is probably the correct amount.  The one that I had at the restaurant didn't even have this much rice in it. It was almost soupy enough to drink, which I presume is the way it is supposed to be. Since I was somewhat rushed, I didn't take time to soak the rice, but just rinsed it a few times in cold water.  That seemed to be sufficient and I don't think it made much of a difference.  I cooked mine uncovered as I was afraid that it would boil over and I couldn't watch it the whole time. I just kept it on a low simmer and stirred it now and then.  This is a very sweet dessert and you can safely reduce the sugar just a tad if you prefer.  I used sliced almonds which had been toasted lightly.  This is good warm, but is even better after

this recipe is alright, but its much better when you substitute half of the milk with coconut milk, and you can get by with only 3 T. of sugar, and half the amount of rose water, 1/2 tsp. of cardamom.

This is the reply to the first review.You can substitute 1/4 teaspoon cardomom powder.
This is the reply to the other review regarding milk quantity.Use the milk as advised because the milk needs to be boiled for longer which produces a rich taste and the quantity of milk is reduced with prolonged boiling.

This was pretty good.  I used the rice/milk proportion that the recipe called for, and cooked the kheer uncovered.  I worried that the kheer was too thin, so I raised the heat and boiled some of the milk off.  However when the kheer cooled it was too thick.  So I think the rice/milk proportion stated in the recipe is correct.  Also the rose water has a very strong flavor; I was not very careful measuring it and so the rose water overwhelmed the cardamom flavor.  And I mixed in raisins & slivered almonds in the end.  Overall this is a very good recipe.

I am wondering if the ratio of milk and rice is correct. 2 quarts of milk to 1/4 cup of rice seems to be off. I had to use less milk by about a quart and a quarter.. The flavor is wondeful though.

Addictive flavor.  Although it takes time, this is a very easy recipe with simple healthful ingredients.  The timing of soaking the rice is important.  If you soak the rice for too long, then it won't absorb enough of the milk and it will turn out too watery.  I substituted 4 tsp ground cardamom for the 4 pods which might be a little much, but I love cardamom.  Be sure to stir the pudding while sprinkling the cardamom on so that it doesn't clump.  I omitted the almonds and it tasted great.

Wow, this is so good and so authentic!  Exactly like what is served at Indian restaurants...even better!  I like the addition of the almonds.  I used basmati rice and lightly toasted the almonds.  I had my doubts about the rose water, because it smells so "perfumey"...but it really accents the pudding beautifully. I also cut back on the sugar a little...I used 1 1/4 cups. The recipe as it is scaled makes a lot of pudding...it doesn't cook down much since there is no boiling involved.  Next time I will scale down by half, since I am the only one in my family who likes pudding (I just don't get it)!  Shazia, I make your Pasanday often and now this will be a regular treat, too!  Thank you!

This recipe is exactly like the Kheer we get in our favorite Indian restraunt.  I searched all over to try to find the right recipe.  It's EXCELLENT!  My husband can't get enough.  Although he likes to just drink the milk and leave the rice.

Do not add more rice to try to thicken this dish. Kheer is supposed to be thin and runny. I have had it at many indian restaurants, and this recipe almost identical. A little less sugar and 1/2 cup coconut milk and this would be perfect!

I doubled the rice and removed the lid for the last half hour so the kheer would thicken.  I served it to my South Asian culture class and they loved it.  My professor from Pakistan said she couldn't have made it better herself!

Thank you, thank you, thank you. I think I spent 1 entire week looking for an authentic Indian rice pudding. I was going to make another recipe from another site, but it called for less milk and I didn't want a thick pudding. I changed the recipe a bit but it turned out perfect: 1/2 cup of basmati rice, one can of coconut milk (two cups) and 6 cups of skim milk (maybe a little less) with a splash of heavy cream. I followed the times listed but mine needed more time. About 1 hour and 40 minutes total. I added 3/4 cups of sugar (because the coconut milk has some sugar already) and it came out perfect, not too sweet, but not bland either (my husband suggested using condensed milk next time, and that might be a good idea). Didn't have rose water and used 1/4 tsp of ground cardamom. Used slivered almonds, chopped unsalted pistachios and about 20 golden raisins (1/2 cup in total). This added more flavor and depth. This is a keeper. I can't stop eating it.

This was really tasty, but far too runny. I think next time I'll increase the amount of rice and decrease the milk. Still, it tasted like my auntie's kheer, and was a great excuse for me to buy cardamom and rosewater - two of my favorite flavors.

Outstanding!  Almost better than the Kheer in good Indian restaurants.  I let it cook down longer than the recipe called for.  It was good before the rose water, but the rose water really adds complexity to the flavor.  I skipped the almonds.  mmmmmmmm

Scaled back to 1 cup of sugar and still much too sweet. Milk/rice ratio was perfect as it starts to thicken a little while cooking but still remains soupy.

I halved the recipe. I only had fat free milk and some 1/2 & 1/2...so used half of each totalling 4 cups. I used level 1/2 tsp cardamom...I love that flavor. Didn't have any rose water so I used a scant 1/2 tsp vanilla...figured it couldn't hurt....it was fine. Did not soak rice per other reviewers but did cook per recipe the whole 70 minutes covered and it came out perfect!!

As good or better than kheer I have had in restaurants. After reading other reviewers, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. Just right for my taste buds. I added a small can of coconut milk, 1/4 cup of golden raisins, and served the pudding with small bowls of toasted slivered almonds and chopped pistachios on the side. Very good!

This would be a five, if it didn't have so much milk. I lower it to six cups instead of eight and use 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2 it's perfect.

This is a very easy and flavorful dessert but it takes way to much time! I suggest that if you have an Indian or Pakistani Grocery near you, buy the Kheer Mix. It is very cheap and done in 15-20 min. All you do is add milk and boil, the rice is already in the packet. The packet looks small but it makes alot of kheer. If your willing to take the time this is a great dessert, but if you're impatient like me buy the mix. I serve kheer (made from scratch or mix made) over vanilla or pistachio ice cream and it tastes awesome!!!

this sounds good too.  It usually takes me a lot longer to make this recipe.  I usually blend the rice a little using a hand held blender when it's cooked well.... right in the  pot.  and I add one can of carnation milk after I blend it. that helps it to thicken faster and adds flavor to it.

Kheer is a very delicious dish. It is used as desert in various parts of the world, especially Indian-subcontinent. Over the years I have cooked several different varieties of Kheer. Please see them at: http://cuisine-beyond.blogspot.com/

This is a great basic recipe but if you're going to make this kheer, please read the other reviews!! Mostly, cut back on the milk and sugar, and rinse but don't soak the rice. I make this with full fat milk, and I also like to add a few small strips of orange peel to the mix (just personal preference). I'm not a dessert person, but I can eat kheer for lunch and dinner every couple of months.

I've been trying to find a rice pudding recipe that tastes like the rice pudding I used to get at my favorite Indian restaurants before I moved and I've been unsuccessful. Most have been too thick but this one was WAY too thin. It was like sugary milk with rice in it. The flavor was pretty good, although it was much too sweet. But the texture was just all wrong. I guess I'll keep searching.

This has the perfect consistency (much thinner than American rice pudding.) My north Indian family likes it with a little vermicelli and a touch of saffron. My spouse likes it with coconut milk due to lactose intolerance. Very versaltile recipe! If you're short on time, you can skip the rice soaking, use 1/3 less milk and cook for 30 mins.

I love the flavor!  I'm reviewing this after making it for the first time.  After reading through most of the reviews (starting with the most helpful), I decided to go ahead and make the recipe as written the first time and make adjustments as I go.  Cooking on low the entire time didn't cook the rice.  I still had milk soup.  I know it's a thin pudding, but it's not supposed to be that thin.  I threw another 1/4 cup of basmati rice into my food processor and ground it as finely as I could and added it to the milk for another 10 minutes after the initial 50.  It started to thicken some.  At that point I added the sugar (1 1/4 cups, but that's all I had) and cardamom.  I think the amount of sugar was just fine, but I could probably use even less.  And I used a heaping 1/2 tsp of ground cardamom because I couldn't find the pods in my local grocery store.  I raised the heat a little to medium low and cooked it another half hour.  I had to admit, I didn't see the part about covering the pot at first and only did it the last 30 minutes or so, but  I really think not bringing it to just below a boil before turning it to low in the very beginning and the amount of rice contributed more to the consistency.  But with my modifications, it turned out perfectly.  So, next time I'll use more rice, higher heat (at first) and definitely cover it.

I had to cook this recipe almost 35 minutes longer than the recipe stated before the rice was tender.The pudding was a lot soupier than I was used to, but it tasted delicious.

I've tried similar recipes that call for additions such as raisins, but the simplicity of this one makes it my favorite. Cardamom pods are impossible to obtain where I live, so I substitute about 1/4 tsp. of ground cardamom. If you've not tried it before, note that the consistency is very different from "American style" rice pudding--way more liquid. Excellent flavors, and don't be deceived by the cooking time; it's very easy to make.

I was very pleased with this recipe. I used 3 cups of goat's milk, 1/2 cup of sugar, 4 cardomon pods, 1 tsp of vanilla, and 1/4 cup of rice. i followed the cooking directions exactly and it turned out great, a bit too sweet. Next time I will use a little less sugar. Thanks!

This was yummy.  It is very sweet and I think the rosewater helped tone this down a bit.  Yes this isnt like any rice pudding i've ever had.. much more liquidy.  I topped mine with almonds fora  nice crunchy, but toasted coconut would also be very good

This is just like the kheer from my favorite restaurant! I made it according to recipe but halved it. I didn't have rose water and had to use ground cardamom(1/4 tsp). It was still wonderful! I used chopped blanched almonds and also added some chopped unsalted pistachios. I used basmati rice and cooked up some extra rice. I added some extra rice to the finished kheer for a little extra chew but still left it soupy as it should be. So addictive! I wish I wouldn't have halved the recipe and next time I won't! I'm so happy to have found this recipe here. Thank you!
