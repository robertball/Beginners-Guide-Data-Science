Creme Fraiche is basically 1 tbsp of buttermilk to 1 cup of heavy cream heated, and refrigerated for 24 hours before using.  It will last for several weeks in the fridge.  This recipe was excellent!

I wish I would have scaled this down to a smaller yield because I know this will not get eaten.   First, the description indicates the anchovy paste isn't noticeable.  Trust me, a tablespoon of anchovy paste in a cup of dressing is noticeable!  In my opinion a teaspoon, maximum, would be better. Second, with only green onion, parsley and chives, the dressing lacks the complexity and depth that the addition of other herbs would provide - adding dill and basil would really round the herb flavor out.  Third, between the lemon juice, parsley and anchovy paste there is a hint of bitterness that a touch of honey or sugar would rectify. Finally, creme fraiche is a several hour process to make and purchasing it is not only expensive but it's not always readily available.  I don't think using creme fraiche necessarily makes this dressing any better than just substituting sour cream or sour cream and a little buttermilk.  Overall, the anchovy taste SHOULD not be noticeable and I missed the creamy herbiness a good Green Goddess Dressing should have.

Just wanted you to know I really enjoy this recipe and to thank you for it. As a child of the 70's, now a 40-something year old watching sodium and avoiding MSG, I try to avoid bottled, store bought dressings. I loved the 7 Seas Green Goddess when I was a child, this is such an improvement!

This was an excellent dressing; my guests loved it.  It definitely benefits from 2 hours in the refrigerator prior to serving.

Excellent dressing packed with lots of fresh, herb flavor.  I used it as a dressing for a pasta salad made with small pasta shells, tiny teardrop tomatoes, chopped yellow pepper and shrimp.  People raved about the unique taste, not too mention what a beautiful color combination the dressing, tomatoes, and peppers made.  Thanks for sharing -

taste is ok but this is definitely not authentic "green goddess".  The origin of this dressing was to make a real mayonnaise homemade in the blender as that's what chefs did back in the day it was created.  the tarragon was the center point plus chive or scallion, garlic and anchovy with parsley.  when you whirl that around in the egg until it's well blended, yes, that's the "green" part.  Then emulsify oil into it.  Then balance out the finished mayonnaise with creme fraiche.  I didn't see garlic in this recipe or the tarragon.  Thus, it's not an authentic adaptation of what the original creator intended.  The original version of this was meant to be served with constructed crab seafood salad, much as remoulade or something similar is still used in New Orleans cuisine.

I could not find the creme fraiche so I used yogurt to keep the fat down.  The recipe was easy to make and a hit with the family.  This is a winner!

Very good dip, it tasted good with chicken, shrimp and my turkey sandwich.  I didn't have creme fraiche so I used reduced fat sour cream, and it was very good.

delicious. Because I am using Dutch mayonaise, I found it a bit thick, so I recommend less mayo and more creme fraiche. I also used anchovy oil (oil from a jar of anchovies) and used mint and basil for the herns as that was all I had - beautiful! I am going to serve it with dutch potatoes as a healthy alternative to them drowning it in mayo:)

Excellent and authentic. Adding or subtracting ingredients is a personal choice but you are not making green goddess dressing. This is a keeper.

After falling in love with Green Goddess dressing at a local restaurant, I decided to find a recipe for it.  The restaurant's version was very green and bursting with fresh flavors.  This recipe made a weak-colored dressing with no depth of flavor.  It was very bland.  If I hadn't reduced the anchovy paste down to only 1 tsp., it would have been far too "anchovy-y".   So I searched again and found another recipe from a famous television chef which contained lots of fresh basil, twice the green onion, fresh garlic, and used sour cream instead of creme fraiche (a much more economical and easier-to-find substitution).  It was bursting with flavor and color, and very closely resembled the dressing that I fell in love with at the restaurant.  This recipe is lacking ingredients needed to bring it from dull and bland, both in flavor and color.

yummy stuff.  I added an avocado to boost the veggies.   Great after-school dip for the kids.

This is tasty, but way too thick when prepared as indicated. I had to add about 1/3 cup more liquid and it greatly inproved the consistency.

used this recipe last summer. sans the anchovies.  don't do anything with fish in it, and yes I can taste it!  This is sooooo good on Taco Salad, still have to have lots of yummy spicy fresh salsa on, but there is such a great melding of flavors, and creamy.  Had it with both chicken, and hamburger taco salads. Really is a must try, and especially here in AZ. It is salad weather.  appreciated 2006 review with creme fraiche recipe, I can get it at local store, but not at a price I can handle.  Must have chopped avocado on salad, green goddess to me always has to have avocado in the mix

Excellent, fresh, flavourful and fantastic. Don't change a thing! (Although you can sub in a dash of fish sauce if you don't have the anchovies on hand!)
