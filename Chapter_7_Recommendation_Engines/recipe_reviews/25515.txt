This is delicious. I used 16 oz of drained pink salmon,liquid smoke in place of the worcestershire sauce, and minced yellow onion instead of green onions. I didn't roll it in walnuts or parsley, I just plopped it in a pretty serving bowl as a spread and sprinkled a little dill on top. I served it surrounded with an assortment of crackers, crudites, and cocktail rye bread-which is really yummy with this!

This is a fantastic appetizer for holiday or non holiday occasions.  My friends enjoy it so much, that they request I bring it to get togethers both formal and casual. If the gathering is large, this recipe can be doubled & looks great as an extra large ball on a bigger platter with a large assortment of crackers.  A+

I've added 1/2 envelope unflavored geletin (dissolved in 1/4 cup boiling water) to this and pressed it into a small fish-shaped geletin mold. The texture is a little more like a Pate'. It makes a great presentation at events that I cator!  Just remember to coat the pan liberally with nonstick spray and chill completely before removing it from the pan.

I made this in large quantity (x8) for an Arts fundraiser. I served it as a spread in a bowl, instead of as a ball, along with crackers and sliced cucumbers. I used smoked chipotle tabasco, and omitted the nuts and parsley. It was a huge hit and so many people asked me for the recipe! Will definately add this to my "tried and true" list for parties.

This is one of the best dips I've ever made (I didn't roll it into a ball but used it as a dip).  I omitted the walnuts and used a dill/mustard combination instead of horseradish (didn't have any).  I served it with crackers and was gone by the end of the night.  Try this recipe!!

Think this recipe would have been much better with smoked salmon and probably about 10 ounces, also will add some garlic powder when I try this again.

This is a wonderful appetizer.  No small praise from the people living here on the Kenai River where we catch the Largest King Salmon in the world!  The horseradish and hot sauce add just the right bite.

Love this recipe. My mom always made this for holiday parties and it always vanished fast. It's always the first thing I think of when I need to bring something for a potluck. We serve it with Triscuits and Chicken and Biscuit crackers.

This is the easiest best appetizer I've served in a long time.  I used regular onions instead of green onions and serve as a spread sprinkled with fresh parsley.  Will use the nuts at a later date.  We do a lot of entertaining after church and this is a great appetizer while dinner is being prepared.

Pretty good, could have used much more of a kick.  Next time, I might try doubling the amount of horseradish.  Serving size doesn't lie.  I made this full size recipe for 6 people and had waaaay too many leftovers (more than half)!  Tastes good on baguette slices.  I also tried it as a sandwich with a thick layer of horseradish and arugula - could make great entertaining tea sandwiches!

Got some great salmon from friends in Alaska.  This recipe is outstanding.  Just enough zip.  For appetizer for the two of us, I put on crackers and top with walnuts. Great crunch and taste.

This has good flavor, but as listed, does not make a 'ball,' but instead I had to turn it into a cheese spread.  It was not quite as flavorful as the other cheese ball I made for my party, but if you love salmon I would highly recommend this recipe.

This is a great appetizer.  I used smoked salmon, minced garlic, and added some jalapeno peppers for a little kick.  No leftovers!  Thanks.

Followed recipe quite closely, did mix cream cheese and salmon together with a food processor for a better blended dip and it turned out well. People seemed to like it. I did add a few shakes of white pepper and probably 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes. I also didn't add too much hot sauce b/c we didn't have anything on hand that I liked very much. Probably just a shake of hot sauce.

What a disappointment.  I used a 15 oz can of the best canned salmon (7 oz would have been really totally tasteless). Kept all other ingredients as per recipe. Agree with others that it tasted like tuna with little to no taste at all. Will not make again or even try to alter this.

I was not able to make this into a ball.
I guess it is OK as a spread, but it was
much too thin for a ball.

Best salmon cheese ball recipe ever!! Everyone loves this when I bring to holiday gatherings. It always gets eaten up the quickest. Children and adults alike. The only thing I change is using almond slices instead of chopped walnuts. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I used smoked salmon in this recipe because I prefer its taste and texture to canned salmon.  This is an easy and tasty prep-ahead appetizer for any event.

I made this recipe as written. It was too bland for me. So to create a spread for our french bread I added to it.  First I used a fresh salmon fillet(I don't like canned fish) that I seasoned with seasoned salt and rosemary garlic from Tone's and baked it 15 minutes.  I used all the ingredents listed on this recipe but increased the Worcestershire to 3 T  PLUS i tsp. seasoned salt, 1T granulated garlic,1 tsp.Old Bay Seasoning,1/4 tsp celery seed and 1 tsp white sugar. And it was great! My 17 yr old granddaughter said it 'sounds gross' but she loved it!

This recipe isn't even worth trying to "fix" it for another try.  It was awful.  I do not know what the problem is, because we (My husband and friends who tried it) like all the ingredients separately but put together following this recipe, it became a mess.  I used high end ingredients (because I made this for a dinner party) and yet in the end it tasted cheap and felt that way too.

I really didn't care for the salmon in this.  Maybe freshly cooked salmon would be better than canned.  I tried to improve it with pineapple but I still didn't like it.

I made this, but my husband does not like nuts, so I omitted the nuts .  He also can not eat spicy foods so I omitted the sauce. It ended up as a salmon spread. It went over very well, and was loved by all!

I made this cheese ball up tonight and a different one, as well.  This is delicious and I know tomorrow it will be SO great once I get it rolled in the nuts and parsley!  I did add 3 drops of liquid smoke to my cheese ball, to give the salmon a sort of smoky flavor, hopefully!  Thank you!!!

I have made this as a dip a few times. (I never bother rolling it) For one reason or another, I always change it up a bit from the 'official' recipe.  Most recently, I couldn't find this recipe when I needed it. Making it from memory, I used a can of Sockeye salmon, an 8oz brick of cream cheese, roughly one and a half tbsps of lemon juice and a heaping tbsp of horseradish. Even eliminating several ingredients, this was amazing. The combination of the lemon and horseradish surprised me at first, but the flavours really work together.  I have served my dip with garlic and chive flavoured pita crackers. So tasty! I'm guessing that the flavoured crackers compensate for my missing ingredients.

If you can manage to save any leftovers, I highly recommend it spread on a toasted English muffin or another dense bread like rye and topped with a poached egg. Love this recipe! 

Thanks for posting, Karen.

I have made this many times. I bring back about 75 lbs of salmon from Alaska each summer so I need recipes to vary my menus. This one has been a keeper.

Very very good.  I used a can of kippered salmon (cold-smoked), and served in a bowl as a spread (without the walnuts and parsley).  All eaten up, and recipe asked for.

I don't like salmon, but my husband RAVES about this recipe...it's very similar to the one his mom gave me 20 years ago (that I can't find).  When I asked her for the recipe, she emailed me a link to THIS one...but I had already made it and had it chilling in the fridge, lol.  He says it is even better the next day (that's because once I make it, he can never wait for me to let it chill for the full recommended time in the fridge first).

Made this with leftover grilled king salmon for a summer solstice fish competition and got second place!  I threw some alder chips in while grilling for just a hint of smokey flavor and used Vidalia onion instead of green onion.  Toasted the walnuts after chopping them up.  Looks very pretty and tastes even better.

This wasn't as good as I was hoping, but I think the result was my fault, not the recipe's.  I mixed everything in the food processor (doubled the recipe and used 12 oz canned pink salmon + 3 oz smoked salmon).  I think the texture was just too smooth, and I couldn't get it to roll into a ball.  After a day, I added some whole capers, minced red onion and parsley, which improved it greatly.  I'll give this another try and play with it a little.  Definitely worth revisiting.

I have been looking for this for years. I used to make this all the time then I lost it . I use chicken in the biscuit  to dip it with. That is what the old recipe has said to do. The only thing that the original didn't have in it was  the hot pepper sauce and the worcestershire  sauce. Love this. Thanks again for posting it.
