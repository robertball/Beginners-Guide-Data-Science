I have to say this was about the best quick treat I've ever made.  Our office has a "Golden Spoon" award potluck a couple of times a year - this last one was a Chocolate Lover's.  I made this in about an hour and I won the award - I've been waiting 2 years to get close enough to win it (we've got great cooks in the office)  So thanks so much for this recipe - the adults just loved it.  So if they did I guarantee the kids would too.  All I can say is it's great, easy and one recipe you can get creative with.

I liked this recipe pretty well but I would suggest using milk chocolate for the glaze.

I like the "concept" of a chocolate pizza.  I thought the crust was a little dry.  In the future I will use a prepackaged brownie mix instead of making it from scratch.

Great idea- chocolate cake crust, but we wished we would have taken the suggestion of another reviewer to use a brownie mix. The original crust is dry as prepared. We topped it with marshmallow whip, melted milk chocolate and candies- still a goodie to us.

Very quick and easy tasty dessert.  At first I was afraid that the crust was a little dry and that the glaze was not sweet enough; however, after the combination of the two, I thought it tasted perfect.  Sprinkled some chopped pecans and coconut on top for a delectable ending.  This will definitely be made again and again.

I used a brownie mix as another reviewer mentioned. I also added marshmallows to the chocolate chip melted mixture (I used milk chocolate chips). The added graham cracker crumbs mixed with powdered sugar to sprinkle on top of the melted chocolate and marshmallow mixture. Topped that with coconut and mini marshmallows. y-u-m-m-y! Will definitely be making again and I am already imagining other luscious combinations.

Didn't make any changes, followed the instructions exactly. It's really easy to make and very quick to disappear! Will definitely be making again.
