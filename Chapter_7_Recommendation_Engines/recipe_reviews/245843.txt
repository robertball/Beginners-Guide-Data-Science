They were delicious and would have received a 5 star. Unfortunately, the bake time is a bit aggressive. I burned the first batch then decided to cut times in half. 5 minutes  for first bake then 3 minutes for fruit topping bake.

I also lowered the temp to 375. 400 seemed a bit hot to me. I prefilled the cookies before putting them in the oven and a lot of the jam melted out! Maybe filling them halfway through would work better? But besides that, they were so yummy! My entire family ate all 60 of them ( I doubled the batch) within a day. I'm definitely going to make these again!

Easy and really good. I also adjusted the temperature and prefilled. I egg washed with egg whites to keep together before filling..

Just made these today.  I followed the advice of other readers and filled with Jam from the beginning.  I baked at 350 degrees since that was the temp I was using for other cookies. 
Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly.

I, too, lowered the temp to 375. I might try piping the jam into the fingerprints next time. I think I may have overfilled. They came out messy but very yummy!! Def will make again :)

These were easy to make and absolutely delicious.  Cooked at 375 versus 450.  Otherwise no changes.  Great recipe to make with kids as the dough is forgiving and not too sticky.  We will make these again!

I couldn’t keep them on the cooling rack long enough to take a picture.

I took the advice from the other reviews and lowered the temperature to 375° but followed the recipe and bake times and they turned out fabulously. I filled them with guava paste that I cooked down with some water until paste melted and it became like a jam. It made exactly 3 dozens that were a big hit with my family.  It’s a keeper.

Delicious. Took previous oven temp suggestions and baked in a 350 oven for 18 minutes. Added jam at the beginning. Turned out great and will make again.

These cookies are fantastic and are just what I was looking for!  I do; however, agree with the other reviewers that the temperature was too hot.  I baked mine at 350 degrees for 9 minutes, then another 5 minutes after adding the apricot jam. I used salted butter and reduced the additional salt to 1/2 tsp.

Definitely too hot/too long. I reduced the bake time the 2nd time and they still burned on the bottom. Still ate all of them. They're delicious and a great texture. I also filled some with Nutella - tastes great but it melts a bit.

I really like the base for these cookies.  Unlike others I have tried on this site, the dough is tasty!!  I doubled the recipe for a party tomorrow and had about 65 cookies, so the proportions work well.  I added a few drops of almond rather than vanilla out of personal preference.  The dough seemed too dry and I added the white of one egg, and that was MY mistake.  It made the cookies easier to form, but they were too soft in the oven and spread a little.  One suggestion:  I used grape, apricot and strawberry jellies for color and taste difference, but the strawberry was almost too chunky.  A smoother jelly works better.  I will make these again many many times.

Taste is good but burnt first batch at 8 minutes. Lowered temp to 375 and was better (about 8-10  min)

Be careful. At 450° it’s easy to burn the bottoms especially if your pan is dark! I had to throw out half of mine and the other half were fine as it was a light pan

Everyone is right about the temp. I lowered to 75 degrees for 6 to 7 minutes. I also put my batter in the freezer after I rolled up the batter, before baking.

Oven temp of 450 degrees too hot.  Ended up baking at 375degrees and filled before baking.  Came out great with these adjustments. Rate 4.
