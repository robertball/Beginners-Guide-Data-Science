getting ready to make this sure it will be yummy But just want to let you all know who don't. Be sure to wait and add the pepperoni and cheese, etc on your machine's last knead; otherwise, it will chew up the meat and other add ins to nothing.

I substituted mozzarella cheese for the cheddar cheese, but overall the bread was good.

Great recipe, I was amazed at how the pepperoni just disintegrates into the dough, I thought the finished bread would have small chunks of meat but end result was just small flecks.  Next time I will buy the spiciest pepperoni I can find (maybe even pepperettes) because once mixed with the dough the meat loses a lot of it's flavour, also would be good with a few sun dried tomato's and more garlic.  I used the bread maker to the second rise and then removed the dough, divided it and it made 24 dinner rolls (let it rise again) - baked at 350 for 20 minutes, and everyone loved it.
P.S. Tried this a second time with turkey pepperettes (the little individual pepperoni sticks) and did not like it as much.  I cut them in 1 inch pieces and they did not disintegrate like the previous try but instead the thick skin of the pepperettes stayed in tact while the meat disolved, overall not appealing.  I will stick to the regular sliced pepperoni and just get the spiciest one I can find.

Great recipe, I did make it slightly differently though. I didn't use a bread machine. I let the dough rise in a greased container with chopped garlic. Next I beat it down and allowed it to rise again.  After allowing the dough to rise the second time I rolled it out and covered it with sliced pepperoni a little more shredded cheddar and bacon bits. I rolled it together pinched the ends and allowed it to rise in the loaf pan and then baked it at 350 degrees. I used a garlic and herb cheddar cheese it was so flavorful!

My hubby had his fishing buddies over to plan the BIG trip to Tofino. I had this bread just coming out of the oven.They loved it and ate the whole thing. Every one of the guys took the recipe home. I do mine in the machine thru the second rise, then take it out and bake it in a 9X5 pan at 400 degrees for 35 minutes. PERFECTION! Thank your hubby for us Tamara.PS I used Asiago cheese and 1t of garlic powder this time. Yummy!

Just made this last night...very good.  One question...where did all the pepperoni's go?!  Used only 12oz pepperoni, and added crushed garlic, chopped onions, banana peppers and jalepenos.  Next time we'll add half the pepperoni's when the bread maker beeps.  The mixer pulverized them to nothing and we would like some pepperoni chunks.  Very good bread!

yummy, delicious! Family loved it.  The only thing I will do different next time will be to cook it on medium setting instead of light. The bread was just a little doughy in the middle. I think then it will be worth 5 stars!

Okay why didn't someone suggest making more than one loaf?  LOL This went fast!! I read the other suggestions by using the bread maker through the 2nd rise.  After the 2nd rise I rolled out the dough into a rectangle sprinkled the cheese and pepperoni ( I only needed 8oz could not imagine 16), then rolled the dough up pinching the ends under.  The dough was then placed in a lighty greased 9x5 loaf pan to rise again (45 min).  This bread was baked for 15 minutes at 350, I then took the bread out and topped it with a little cheese and pepperoni for decoration.  Placed the bread back in the oven for approximately 7 minutes.  Can't wait to make again.

Oh Goodness!!!  Heavenly goodness, made this with vegetable lasagna tonight, we loved it!! The only thing I changed is I used garlic salt instead of regular salt. Bread came out a nice big loaf, beautiful grain & color. It cut wonderfully. The flavor was devine, couldn't believe I actually made this myself, no more box mixes for me. I will be making this often.

This is a very unique, but extremely tasty bread!
 
I only have a half pound bread maker, so I just left out a lot of the pepperoni (there's no way it would all fit!). I also had to add more liquid to get it to mix together and found myself really having to help the breadmaker anyways (My arms were getting tired). 
Here's what I did different:
 1) A little extra (medium) cheddar
 2) About 7 oz Hormel Turkey Pepperoni (so much less fat!)
 3) Added about 3 Tbsp olive oil (yum)
 4) I didn't have any plain parmasean, so I used a pepper parmasean (made by kraft)

Future reccommendation:
 Maybe use sharp cheddar for even more flavor. Also, you may want to chop up your pepperoni into about quardters or so first, since it the breadmaker will chop it up anyways.

Super with marinara sauce and could very well be served as an appetizer!  I followed the advice given by inounvme and let the bread maker do all the kneading for me; however I did add the cheddar cheese before hand to add some extra flavor.  I rolled it out, sprinkled a light layer of garlic salt, laid on a good layer of pepperoni and mozzarella, rolled it up and let it sit in a bread pan an hour.  Then I baked it in the oven for 20-30 minutes on 350.

Had to make this as soon as I saw it.  Followed the recipe almost exactly.  I was skeptical about 16 oz of pepperoni--it just seemed like a lot to me.  I used about 4-5 oz of pepperoni, and put it in at fruit and nut beep.  One thing I've learned through trial and error about bread machines is that those kneaders are NOT kind to whole ingredients, so the later you add them the better off you'll be if you want chunks of the ingredient throughout the bread.  My breadmaker did still tear up the pepperoni; however,  I did get a loaf with  smaller pieces of pepperoni throughout the bread.  It tastes great.  I'll admit that more pepperoni would have made for a more uniform loaf, but that's my bad since I questioned the amount.

Made this as a first attempt in my new ABM. Will probably only use 1/2 the pepperoni next time. Was a bit greasy/gummy, but that could have been me messing up the setting slightly.

This was a huge hit at our house!  I followed Shezzza's lead and made my bread by hand, rolling the pepperoni up in the dough.  I proofed the yeast with the milk, then added to the flour, salt, sugar, parmesan, and mozzarella cheese (subbed for the cheddar).  I kneaded the dough and drizzled the 1 1/2 tbsp of butter to coat.  I let rise for one hour, punched the dough down and then let it rise for another hour.  After the second rise, I turned the dough out on a floured surface and rolled out.  I melted another tbsp of butter and smeared it on my dough, then generously sprinkled the dough with garlic powder and oregano.  I coated the dough with pepperoni, and then rolled shut and placed in a bread pan.  I smothered the roll with more cheese and topped with even more pepperoni.  Baked at 350 for 35 minutes, removed from oven and let cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan.  My husband and I both loved this pizza bread!  The dough was very easy to work with and stayed light and fluffy after baking.  Paired with some sauce for dipping, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Very good. I cut back to about 4 oz. of pepperoni. I think next time I would go ahead and put in a whole 8 oz. I do think 16 would have been way to much. It had a great flavor though. I toasted it and buttered it with garlic butter the next day. My family really liked it.

I only have a 1lb machine, so i halfed the recipe. Very good bread although mine looked nothing like the picture. Like another person said the pepperoni became small bits. Next time I'll add it later in the cycle not at the begining as the recipe states.

I put this recipe in my breadmaker's dough cycle. Split up and rolled with 4 cheese, butter and garlic, and pepperoni slices, and then baked. Didn't last ten minutes after I pulled out. On my way back to the grocery store to pick up some more pepperoni.

This is good.  I tried to add the pepperoni and cheese at the last knead, but think I put in to soon.  I wanted bigger chunks of pepperoni.  The family loved it though.

I added half of the pepperoni at the beginning and the rest when the fruits and nuts beep occurred so that there would still be chunks of pepperoni and that worked really well. This bread was good, but I little too dense for my taste. If you like dense bread and pizza - you'll love this recipe.

Don't let the picture fool you. That is how pepperoni bread looks. If you make the recipe as written, everything will be pulverized and your bread will be orange. We love pepperoni bread, but this is something very different. Will not make this again. My bread also did not cook all the way through on the light setting.

I loved this recipe.  Thanks!
I went one step further and added shreded sun-dried tomatoes (not the soft ones), or you can serve it with warm pizza sauce on the side.

This was very good even though I only used 1/2 lb of sliced pepperoni.  It had a rich flavor and texture.  I served with bowls of warm marinara sauce for dipping.  Mmmmmm - bread & sauce!!  I'll be sure to make this for our older son when he returns from military training.  He'll love it!

The bread had a good flavor, but didn't quite meet the expectation I had when seeing all the ingredients. Also, the dough rose far above the top of the pan and smashed against the top of the bread machine window. If I make this again, I'll need to decrease the amount of ingred.

Very good bread.  I did substitute mozzarella for the cheddar.  The pepperoni seemed to disapear once baked, but the flavor was still there.  Next time I will try ham or sausage.

No taste.  If you follow the recipe as instructed the pepperoni vanishes as though it's not there.  I would suggest adding more italian spices and perhaps crushed red pepper flakes and definitely wait to add the pepperoni in the last kneading cycle so there will be some bits there to taste it.

Well... let me start out by saying that my bread turned into a disaster. Part of it might have been operator error, but my bread didn't rise very well, and it was lumpy at best. It did, however, have a decent taste, and I think I might retry the recipe at a later date. Update: I was going through my breadmaker instruction manual- apparently all of the liquids (milk, for instance)are supposed to be at room temperature before adding them to the machine. So, I am sure that the majority of the lumpiness was due to my own error. Lesson learned. I'll try the recipe again soon and hopefully it will turn out better!

I didn't read many reviews before I tried this recipe. Like others before me, I was very surprised to see the pepperoni was pulverized and ground. By the pictures, I was expecting a stromboli type of bread with large chucks or pockets of meats. It was not what I was expecting by the pictures so I am only giving it two stars. The taste was okay, but I think I will try another recipe next time.

I don't know if it was the recipe or because I baked the bread per instructions in the bread machine. It was disgusting. If I ever attempted to make this again, I would definitely choose to take it out of the machine after the dough cycle and bake it manually in my oven.

Rockin'! Mine is a 1.5 machine so to reduce I used: 3/4 c milk, 1/4 c warm water, 1/2 c shredded cheese, 2 oz pepperoni (3/4 at beginning and 1/4 @ nut beep, 1 tbs sugar. 1 tsp salt, 1 tbs butter, 2 tsp Parm, 2c bread flour & 1/3 c all purpose. 2 tsp yeast. (go a wee bit lighter on the yeast/sugar as it's not exact science and just a tiny bit too much for the rise.)  Mods - threw in garlic salt & Italian seasoning. Wow, so yummy.

This recipe is great, I have my second batch in the maker right now. I did add some things to it though... A little more cheese, fresh garlic, pizza seasoning and some tomato paste... I'm already passing this around to friends and family!!!
