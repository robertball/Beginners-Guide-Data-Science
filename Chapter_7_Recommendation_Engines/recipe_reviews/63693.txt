I think there must be a mistake in this recipe. I will make it again, but next time I will reverse the amounts of half-and-half and Worcestershire.  I tasted the sauce and it was basically straight Worcestershire. Next time, I'll use a quarter cup of Worcestershire, and a cup of fat free half-and-half. I cut the sauce with an additional half cup of skim milk, but my mouth is still burning from the spice! Also, remember to lower the heat a little before adding the half-and-half, and whisk it in quickly, or it will separate.

Also, I crumbled three strips of well-cooked bacon into the sauce, along with a cup of fresh spinach, just before serving. As soon as the spinach wilts, it's ready.

Decided to sub dijon mustard for the worcestershire sauce. Sauce went nicely over the fish.

I really expected it to taste good because I have both South Beach cookbooks and have made some great recipes from them.  Since this was from South Beach Online, I assumed it would be as good as the others.  Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed in this dish.  It got good reviews but it was one of the worst sauces I've ever tasted.  :(

I didn't have the wine worchestire sauce on hand, and used the dijon mustard suggestion.  It was great!
