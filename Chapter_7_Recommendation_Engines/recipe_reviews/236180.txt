We loved this! I did use prepared horseradish and only 2 Tablespoons of sriracha sauce. It didn't seen real hot at first, but after sitting in the fridge, it really kicked up the heat, so I would stick with 2 Tbsps. in thew future. We really enjoyed this on our fish sandwiches tonight and I can't wait to try it w/ fried shrimp...a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was a decent sauce. I'm not a big fan of Sriracha sauce (all the craze these days), so I thought the garlic from it didn't fit too well here. On the other hand, this was the first time I'd ever bought a fresh horseradish root, so I liked peeling and grating some of it for this recipe. I made this exactly as written, and consumed it all in a few days (dipping lots and lots of 51-60 count shrimp into it). I probably would've liked this better if it was hotter (e.g., more horseradish).

Very well received with shrimp cocktail.  Will definitely make again.  Did use no sugar added catsup to lower the carbs.  Thanks for this recipe.

i have made this recipe several times now. I use the prepared horse radish instead. I always get raves about how good it is with shrimp and fish.
