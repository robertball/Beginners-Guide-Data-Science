This is a very tasty dish, easy, but uses up more dishes than usual.  We loved the crispy noodle cake and will be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly. My family loved it! My husband said best beef and broccoli he's ever had. The ramen cake was really fun. I prefer my food a little spicier so next time I will tweak it, but other than that will definitely make it again.

I don't review at all, but this recipe is so good, and had so few reviews, I wanted to add another 5 star! My family devoured it. I couldn't find oyster sauce at my grocery, so I subbed in same amount of Soy Sauce (I use low sodium) and an extra tsp of sugar, so altogether that is 4 TBSP of Soy Sauce and 2 Tsp of sugar. It turned out amazing. I also added more vegetables (cabbage, carrots, etc.) to the broccoli and cut back on the oil (didn't need to add more oil at every step). This one is a keeper!

Very tasty! And the ramen cake is awesome: chewy, crispy, and a little nutty where it's browned. My only change: I added some cauliflower along with the broccoli and a pinch of crushed red pepper to the sauce.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, I left out the ginger because I hate ginger, and didn't fry the noodles because I was short on time  and it was very flavorful and filling! I sprinkled toasted sesame seeds on top for garnish and it looked very good. Not frying the noodles makes this a simple healthy weeknight meal, I will definitely make it again!

My husband says it was “very, very good”. I substituted brown rice for the ramen noodle cake but I will definitely try the ramen noodles next time. I followed the recipe for the sauce adding another teaspoon of cornstarch based on a review saying the sauce was too thin. It was just right. I used the amount of ingredients listed for the sauce even though I was only using 1/2 of the stir fry ingredients because I like lots of sauce. I used venison instead of flat iron steak.. It was excellent and will definitely be favorite in my kitchen.

We would give this 4 1/2 stars if we could.  I followed the instructions fully.  I found it tricky to keep the ramen cake intact so after flipping it and having it fall apart, I gave it a good stir, pressed it down an cooked it another 5 min. The beef and broccoli was easy and very good.   My husband thought the sauce could have been either a little thicker or a little more flavorfull, and next time I will add toasted sesame oil, which I didn't have.  With that said, it was still very good and different than our "usual."
