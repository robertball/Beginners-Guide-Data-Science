Cherry tomatoes will keep their shape and not burst if you poke them once or twice...I use a skewer.
Rather than roasting. I prefer to lightly saute them in a small frying pan.  Wiggle the pan to heat them on all sides!  They keep their shape beautifully.

7.21.18I set the timer for 30 minutes (recipe says 35-40), and many of the tomatoes already burst, they were overcooked.  Also, they stuck horribly to the foil-lined baking sheet.  Certainly wouldnâ€™t serve this batch as a side dish, but they were quite good on a Friday-night pizza.  As with any roasted veggie, they have a very intense, deep flavor.  If I were to make again, I will start checking for doneness at 20 minutes

As a quick afterthought and in a hurry, I tossed my basket of cherry tomatoes with olive oil, salt and pepper, put them in a aluminum pie pan and placed in the Traeger BBQ while my pork chops were cooking. They added a delicious pop to our dinner. I look forward to making them again with all the add-ins.

This was the easiest side dish that worked so well with balsamic roasted chicken.  The hint of balsamic on the roasted tomatoes made a terrific blending.

I followed the recipe and added some slivered garlic. Delicious! so many tomatoes I have made 4 batches. We use it on grilled chicken, pork tenderloin, salads, or as an appetizer with cream cheese and crackers.
