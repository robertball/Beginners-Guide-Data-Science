Aghhh!  What a huge mess!  It took forever and was all over my kitchen.  The finished product melted only 1/2 hour after taking out of the fridge.  I'll stick with good ole caramel apples next time.

Delicious!  This recipe is fun to make and taste incredible.  It is easiest to prepare if you select a small portion of your kitchen and lay down wax paper/parchment on the counter, any little oops go in the trash quickly and easily. Thanks for the great recipe!

a helpful tip i found - use less water and the caramel won't be as runny and will set better

I found this to be quite the tasty treat! First let me say I had no problem making this and it wasn't messy at all. I made my own homemade caramel instead of using store-bought, but other than that I followed the recipe. I used Granny Smith Green Apples (two small apples) and found the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg spices to be divine in the homemade caramel sauce and nuts. Mine came out more like a "salad" meaning that I didn't have individual pieces of apple topaz candies. Next time I may try to make a thicker caramel sauce and drop of apple slice onto the wax paper sheet individually.

These look very pretty, but do not have quite a strong enough taste.
