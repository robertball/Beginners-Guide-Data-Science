I left these marinate overnight...even my picky daughter loved them, and she doesn't like to try anything new.

This recipe couldn't be easier. I just mixed the ingredients, no chopping or mincing required. 
 I made this for our annual St. Patrick's Day parade party. I made enough marinade for 15 pounds of wings- my guests inhaled them.
  I cooked the wings in throw away aluminum pans. I included the marinade at the beginning and then drained off excess liquid during cooking.  
 I stirred the wings gently so they browned evenly. Try it- you won't be sorry.
