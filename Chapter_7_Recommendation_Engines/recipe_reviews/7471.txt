I'll give this 5 stars, it tastes good, however I probably won't make it again.  I have another white cake recipe that I use and get similar results without jumping through all the hoops.  It is good and worth trying.  Thanks.

My boss who is an awesome chef/baker wanted her mom to make her famous LB cake, but she wouldn't so I took a stab at it and this turned out great! Everyone loved it, even boss's mom!

I was not impressed with this cake it. The cake was just ordinary but nice, I think the same results could be achieved much more simply and cheaply than in this recipe.

it's a real winner!  I have been making this cake since 1945.  It is in my WWII recipe book.  I have won ribbons at the fair with the recipe.
