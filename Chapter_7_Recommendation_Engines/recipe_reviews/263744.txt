My husband and I are on the Keto Diet and we both loved it.  We served it as a salad instead of over cauliflower rice.  We added the Easy Sesame Dressing on this web-site, substituting artificial sweetener for the sugar in this recipe and the dressing recipe.  Wow!!!

My husband, kids and myself truly liked this meal. I served it over riced cauliflower made with shallots, fish sauce & sesame oil.

Next time I will drain at least 1/2 the grease, then add seasonings. Serve with red pepper flakes and broccoli.

For me, this  wasn’t reminiscent of Korean flavours. I added mushrooms and shallot to the cauliflower rice like one other reviewer said and that helped.  Needed a bit of fresh chilli pepper more ginger to perk up the flavour. A side of kimchi helped out.

I made this and it was tasty, but I think I will reduce the amount of soy sauce next time. A bit too salty, and I love salt!

Good recipe.  The "rice" was better than I expected.

Great flavor and so quick and easy! I added onions, mushrooms and zucchini and used garlic powder as I didn't have any cloves on hand. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe almost to a tee. I did use fresh ginger and a bit more garlic because I know how much we love garlic. Also substituted xylitol because I didn’t have coconut sugar and xylitol is more acceptable for me. It was fantastic!! Falls into my weight loss eating program and didn’t feel at all deprived!!

This was a very good meal!  I really loved the cauliflower rice as a companion to the beef.  One thing I will likely do differently next time is use about 1/2 of the soy sauce the recipe calls for.  For me, soy sauce tends to go a long way since it is so high in sodium and I don't tend to like a dish that tastes too salty.  But other than that, it was delicious!

This turned out pretty good. I didn’t have coconut sugar so I used monk fruit. Overall the flavors were interesting. I doubt I will make it again.

I really enjoyed it. Nice flavor. Could use a bit more sauce to mix with the rice more and next time I make it I'll add something to spice it up. Thanks.

I'll definitely make this again! It was tasty - even though I forgot to add sugar. It definitely would have enhanced the flavor. I served it with jasmine rice and riced cauliflower that I added peas and grated carrots to.

This was easy to put together on an evening before we take off on a trip tomorrow and will also be convenient on a work night.  Not that much prep work required. Flavors were mild but one can "up the ante" with some hot sauce, which is exactly what husband did, or some red pepper flakes.  Husband also thought the concoction was a bit dry so he added some extra soy sauce to his bowl--I was fine as is.  A lot of kids would be willing to eat this as well.  Very economical dish.

I make this all the time! Im not on keto so I serve over jasmine rice. If the flavors appeal to you, please try it. I do double the sauce , I found it a little dry as written, but maybe that was due to my rice choice. Anyway.....delish

This Keto friendly Korean Beef was delicious! I'm adding it to our meal rotation. My very picky husband really liked it, and 1/3 of my ver picky kids liked it. I didn't have coconut sugar so I used honey instead.

The recipe didn't say to cook the cauliflower, so I did not.  It was very good.
