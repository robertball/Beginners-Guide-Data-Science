This is a LOT of work, but very good.  Here is a tip for making it though, I have several picky family members who do not even eat stuffing because it has too many chunks of things that they do not like, so I minced everything.  The result was fabulous! I did eliminate the cayenne pepper all together and I would recommend that if you make it this way, don't add the salt at all.  The recipe has so many spices that it does not need the salt.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was the best stuffing I ever had!! I would also cut the Cayenne pepper down to 1 tsp.
I will make this again and again.

I just wanted to say thanks to Kevin for submitting this recipe.  I am an American living in the UK, and so throw a Thankgiving bash here as an excuse to have a party.  I made this stuffing because it just sounded so good.  It was incredible.  Everyone who attended said it was the best stuffing they'd ever tasted.  I'll be using this recipe again and again.

My friend in Wisconsin made this recipe to celebrate Mardi Gras.  She made it for approximately 20 people, so she had to cut back on the spice. I am from the south, and I have two tried and true recipes that do not even come close to this one!  I have never had anything better.  This stuffing was amazing!  Thanks Kevin!

despite omitting the jalepno peppers this dish was still spicy hot.  However I really did like it.  I served with a crown roast pork.  I will definetly make again however for myself and my family's sake I will cut down the cayenne pepper to 1 teaspoon.

Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!  I made this recipe last year and it was a HUGE hit with my family.  It was our first year having Thanksgiving at home (instead of with grandparents) so I had never made stuffing before... but this recipe is almost impossible to mess up.  Being from the South, this recipe was actually not quite spicy enough for me so I was a bit more liberal with the cayenne pepper as well as adding about 1 tsp of paprika and about 1/4 cup of chives to the recipe.  The spices are easily adjusted to your own personal taste without taking away from the recipe itself.  In fact, I just hopped on to double-check the recipe so I can make it again this year!  Definitely a keeper for a spiced-up Holiday meal.

This recipe takes some work, but it is excellent.  It is also easy to alter the amount and type of spices.  My family loved it.

I've been making this stuffing for a few years now. It is truly amazing, my family and anyone who tries it loves it. 

I do add one thing Italian sausage, the type you BBQ not the hot dog kind. I cut off the sausage "skin" and break apart into small pieces. Then brown the pieces in a skillet. I use about 5 sausages but you can vary as you like. 

This small change brings another dimension to an already excellent recipe.

Try it you won'r regret it.

Flavor was great. The only suggestion I have is to use about half of a jalapeno. I'm from Louisiana, and it was too spicy for my family. This recipe makes a TON!

Polarizing recipe. About half my family liked it and the other thought it was bad. Too many conflicting spices for my taste.

I was very disappointed with this.  I enjoy heat, but this was way too spicy even for me.  It was also very bland...there was cornbread and heat and no flavors in between.  I would not make again.

This will be my 4th year to make this recipe for Thanksgiving and it is fantastic!  Very, very good!  Everyone goes on and on about it.  I substitute 2 boxes of jiffy mix (baked according to package directions) and crumble it, instead of making the homemade cornbread, just to make it a little quicker.  LOVE IT!

This was the best stuffing I've ever had. It had a good amount of spice and so much flavor. It didn't come out dry at all for me. I actually thought it was going to be too mushy at first from all the liquid I used, but it wasn't. It was a perfect texture, even reheated. My boyfriend and I both agreed that it would be so easy to just never stop eating it. Awesome!

this stuffing came out a bit dry. My wife made it while I was smoking the turkey and she followed the recipe exactly. She cooked it in a pan in the oven instead of inside the bird. That may have been the reason for the dryness.
