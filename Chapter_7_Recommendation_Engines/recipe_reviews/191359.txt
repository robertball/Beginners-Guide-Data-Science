These cookies turned out great!!! What is even better is that they were successfully made gluten free-not easy with most treats.  I added one egg, decreased the flour by 2/3 to 3/4 cup (depending) and added 1 tsp. of xanthum gum to the dough.  I kneaded thoroughly and chilled the dough overnight.  Rolled the circles between two sheet or wax paper and used GF preserves as the filling.  SO YUMMY!!!

Really good recipe.  I used canola oil and white whole wheat flour--the dough was great.  For the filling I made separate batches of apricot and prune, then put them in the blender with lemon juice and sugar, (no walnuts) so I had 2 different fillings, both good.  I ended up with more than twice as much filling as I needed, so I guess I'll have to make more dough and eat more hamantaschen!

This is a REALLY great recipe! The only thing I had a problem with is that my first round overflowed. The fix: only fill with ONE TEASPOON for a 2-3 inch round dough. Then, using a bowl of water, dip your finger in water, and moisten the boarder of the disc before forming the triangle. It helps the ends stick better. I also used store-bought jam, with no other issues. Yum!

SO good!  For some reason, the dough was too soft to roll out right after mixing it all together, so I refrigerated it for a couple of hours. I had no problem at all rolling them out after that. The cookies are so delicious!  They are so much more flavorful than other recipes that I've tried.

I'd like to add: 
We make extra filling and eat it on yogurt or cereal or plain. Besides being tasty, it really helps... hem... move things along :)

fabulous recipe!  I didn't have any lemons, so I just doubled the orange zest and it was perfect.  Also, I used the bread hook on my Kitchenaid to mix.

Fantastic, tasty dough! I mixed it w the dough hook attachment in my KitchenAid mixer. So easy! Scraped it from bowl onto Roul Pat mat & needed to sprinkle w some flour (used Organic pastry flour & raw sugar). I also added a drop of Young Living 'Citrus Fresh' essential oil to the egg mixture. Amazing flavor & I love cooking w my oils (I sell them as well).  The dough rolled out so nicely. Didn't have time to make the filling so I used a combo of cherry & apricot Bon Maman preserves. I made the cookies thin so I baked them only 14-16 min per batch. Crunchy edges & soft inside. Wonderful!

Amazing recipe.  Dough stays cookie-crispy after baking and storing in cookie jar.  I added vanilla and a little orange juice to the dough.  I also put mine in the fridge before rolling out.  I used chocolate chips, Nutella and a concoction of raisins, dried cranberries and dried apricots simmered in orange juice with cinnamon and sugar and then mashed with my immersion blender for the filling.

These were great. 

But for my neighbor down the hall, I'd be interested to know if commenter GreenApril meant gluten-free flour in her gluten-free version. Otherwise that recipe is -- obviously -- not gluten-free.

Hope she sees this!

I have made AND recommended this recipe more times than I can count, both  for sugar cookies and for hamantaschen (dough only, I use a different filling). A few tips:
- MUST MUST MUST use a stand mixer, do not attempt to mix this by hand or you'll encounter all the problems with the dough seeming to have wrong proportions of flour
- use only 1 tsp of baking powder. Baking powder causes cookies to puff and spread, if you're cutting specific shapes, the less puff the better. Can even reduce further if needed.
- Can be made as a chocolate dough, substituting the 4 cups of flour with 3 cups regular flour + 2/3 c cocoa powder
- Can leave out the fruit zests (although they're delicious) and use instead 1-2 tsp vanilla + 1/2 tsp either almond or lemon extract.

Good recipe! What a great filling! The one thing I would say is refrigerating the dough is super helpful! The dough was too soft but I refrigerated the dough for 2 hours and the dough was much easier to use and shape after that!

This is a fantastic recipe which yielded my best tasting and looking Hamentaschen, ever. I did not have a lemon, so I used the zest of two oranges; plus I substituted fig jam, Nutella and chocolate chips as fillings. I exactly followed the directions and these turned out beautifully, with no leaks or overbakes.  Happy Purim and thank you for the recipe.

These were fabulous.  Used a little less sugar in the filling and used walnut oil in the dough.

The dough never "came together." I added a few tablespoons more of oil until I could form it into a ball. Even so, the dough was so crumbly I couldn't roll it out. The cooking time for the fruit was inadequate. I cooked it for 5 minutes longer than suggested and it was still almost impossible to mash the fruit, especially the apricots. I ended up pushing lumps of dough into a muffin tin with my fingers and spooning the fruit into the center. The resulting "deconstructed Hamantaschen" tasted very good, but didn't look like much.

rolled out to 1/4" and it was a little bready.  Lots of leftover filling.  Used double the amount of walnuts.  Dough was alittle dry, had to add water.  Baked for 30 min

These turned out great. I used a gluten free flour, adding only  xanthan gum, and refrigerated the dough for two hours before working with it.  The only change I would make next time is there is too way too much filling for dough if you roll to a 1/4 inch...I would try 1/8 inch next time.

I made it pretty much as the recipe called for.  Didn't have the lemon and orange, so I just added a little vanilla.  I used canned fillings and a homemade poppy seed filling.   Dough worked out just great with hand kneading.

I had a very hard time with the dough, and although I loved the two zest idea- and added some vanilla-taste and texture nothing special. I would have given it 2 stars but I used splenda instead of sugar because of diabetics in family so some of the problem may have been that. But all in all- not a do over.
