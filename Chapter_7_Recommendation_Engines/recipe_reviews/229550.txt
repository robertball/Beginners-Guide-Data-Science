These were good but as stated by another reviewer you can't really go wrong with something like this. I didn't find them to be oily but with that being said the last time I made them I used another recipe that packed a bit more flavor. However, the other recipe I use calls for a ton of crushed red pepper which the kiddos don't enjoy so I guess what I'm saying is this a fantastic starter recipe. If you like more garlic add it, onion throw it in, into more dill have at it! I give this one 5 stars based on the fact that its simple and doesn't "twist" your arm to add things that do not suit your family for the sake of staying true to the recipe. Great snack, dirt cheap,  and easily tailored! Thanks for the tasty submission =)

These were a little greasy for my liking, but I do enjoy the flavor!  i'll decrease the oil if I make them again.

YUM! Can't really go wrong w/ these. They are great wether they are on their own or used for dipping. For as quick and simple as they were to make, they turned out delicious...a wonderful way to dress up an otherwise ordinary cracker. Thanks for sharing. :)

This is very similar to a recipe and friend gave me.  I use a whole box if saltines, 1 pack of ranch dressing powder, 3/4 cup of oil and 2 tbs of hot pepper flakes.  Pour everything in a big plastic bag and shake for several minutes until the crackers are coated completely.  Everyone loves these.  They will disappear very quickly and everyone will ask for the recipe.  If you have leftovers just save them in a plastic bag and they stay crispy for a long time.

My family loves these crackers. I have been making them for years.  We usually eat them with with homemade chicken salad IF there are any crackers actually left.  I agree with another reviewer. The measurement for the oil is too much. I use approx 1/2 - 2/3 cup of canola oil. (You stop actually measuring when you make them so often) I will add my crackers to a large Tupperware bowl and then pour the mixture over the crackers. I cover the bowl and then turn the bowl upside down and kind of swirl the bowl in a circular motion once or twice so the crackers do not break.  I also recommend flipping the bowl over once every 30 minutes or so. This helps the mixture evenly coat the crackers.

I love these, but wondered if anyone has ever used Parmesan cheese in the oil mixture?  I may give it a try!

I've made this a number of times and it's also good if you add in pretzels and cheez-it crackers!  It's addictive!

Too much oil! Next time I'm adding half of the oil and I'm sure I'll put more stars to the rating.

These have been popular with everyone I have served.  Very easy to make  and the flavor is excellent.  I often serve these as snacks but also like to use them with various soups.  I keep the ingredients on hand for last-minute preparation, when necessary.
