I did alter this a bit. I don't care for dark stout beer so I used and IPA a very strong IPA and I backed the amount down to 12 oz. Perfect for us we loved this! It's a solid recipe but be mindful of the amount of beer you use and what kind depending on your taste. If it's something you won't drink don't cook with it =)

Made as written except that I purposely cut the amount of liquid in half for 2 reasons.  The first being that I didn't want the beer to overpower as others mentioned and the second being that I wanted the finished brisket firm enough to slice. From past experience I've found that if the meat is completely covered in liquid the end result is more of a shredded consistency. There's nothing wrong with that but it is not what we prefer. My potatoes were leftover from another meal so I had to tweak that step and just add them in the final minutes . The carrots and cabbage took on the flavor nicely but I do think 4 beers would have been too much. Overall this was a good recipe and one I would make again. If you don't like a strong beer flavor in your food I recommend cutting back as I did.

I made this recipe, and found everything but the meat had a very strong beer aftertaste.  I like beer in my food don't get me wrong, but when the cabbage carrots and potatoes all have a strong beer taste it ruins the meal.  I won't be using the recipe again.

Delicious success using this recipe for St. Paddy's Day dinner! No serious alterations made, just personal preferences. Mine was a 3.5 lb. flat brisket from Costco (the best!), so I braised it for 3 hrs. I also cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup as I only used 2 bottles of Guinness stout. I needed to continue cooking the veggies an extra 15 minutes, but that may be because we're at high altitude. Served with Irish soda bread with raisins and a side of colcannon with bacon just 'cuz I love it! Nicely done!

Will make it again.!  Definitely a winner!
Because of previous reviewers, I only used 2 cans of stout and stock then covered brisket with extra stock and water near the end to cover the veggies when I added them to cook. ??

This recipe is fantastic ! I cut back the sugar  to 2 tablespoons and used crushed peppercorn,  and it was so delicious! This will be my new go to recipe for a corned beef dinner! And the Family loved it even my picky one who said she wasn’t eating it.

This was the best corned beef and cabbage I have ever eaten.  I used two bottles of Guinness instead of four, and I did not add any carrots. Delicious! This will definitely be made again.

I made this recipe, but since I can’t stand the taste of beer, I just used beef bone broth and water. I also cut the brown sugar in half. Everything else was the same. It turned out great and and used part of the leftover corned beef for Reubens.

I did not use 4 bottles of beer I used 2 and some of my homemade vegetable broth instead. It turned out well and there were no leftovers :)

I used half the mount of brown sugar, and less of the amount of beer also. 
But I'm very pleased with the way this recipe turned out. And my company enjoyed it as well.  
Thank you(  allrecipes ),  in the pass I've tried many of your recipes and I will continue to in the future .   sincerely a loyal customer,  Mrs.L. Bessler, East Brunswick,N.J.
