These sliders were so easy to make and a hit with my co-workers. I added curry and cayenne to the buffalo sauce to really give it a kick. I served a side of blue cheese and ranch for dipping.

Not bad for saving calories.  Not as flavorful and one would think after marinating for half the day in the fridge.  Works tho
