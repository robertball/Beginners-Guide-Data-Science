When I make quiche, I use only 2 eggs and WAY more cheese. I love the combination of Gruyere and Emmental (they're a bit expensive, but they taste awesome). Sometimes I add sliced tomatoes, or mushrooms and garlic. It's very versatile. Also, I prick the pie crust all over with a fork, then bake it for about 10 mins before adding the filling. This helps to avoid the sogginess you often get.

I doubled this recipe and put it in 2 deep dish pie shells that I baked for about 8 minutes at 400 degrees, although I think regular depth would work too. I used 2 cups of cheddar cheese for the double recipe, and about 8 oz. of chopped brocolli. I also used onion powder instead of onion, because I was low on time. With the brocolli, 4 pieces of bacon was plenty per quiche. Unless you really like the herbs, they were not necessary. It's a good basic recipe that I will use again.

I tired this recipe because I didn't have cream or evaporated milk to make my normal quiche recipes, and I'm not sure what I could have done to mess up such a simple recipe, but there wasn't nearly enough filling in this... I would have to double it to fill the pie crust, and it wasn't a deep dish pie shell... the filling wasn't nice and light and fluffy like normal either...

I made this with the "No Fail Pie Crust III" from this website and both my fiance and I loved it.  I didn't use any thyme or parsley and I added one more egg and a little more mozzarella.  Mmmmmm.  Loved it!!!  Only took 30 minutes in the oven and it fluffed up perfectly- don't forget to beat the eggs well!

Just wonderful!  I made this for brunch today and it was excellent.  I didn't use as much bacon because I had only about 5 slices and I added about 1/4 cup chopped red pepper.  I love how easy this was to make such an impressive looking meal.  I ended up cutting it into six and ate two slices.  My boyfriend ate three!  I will add this to my recipe box and make sure to make it again.

Great recipe.  I had never made quiche b/f b/c I thought it would b 2 complicated but it wasn't.  I added a 1/2 c. of spinach and it was absolutely delicious.  I can't wait 2 try different ingredients each time I make it.

This was a delicious quiche, although after reading many reviews and suggestions, I made some modificaions and it turned out amazing the first time.  Instead of 4 eggs I used 6.  I used AT LEAST 1 1/4 cups of milk (for fluff and moisture), no meat (although next time I might put black forest ham in it), I filled a cereal bowl full of cheeses-2 to 2 1/2 cups(swiss and cheddar-more cheddar than swiss), only 1 heaping t. of flour (it does clump up, but you cant tell in the final product), I added a little cumin, basil, and rosemary, a pinch of nutmeg, and LESS than 1/4 t. of thyme.  I also added garlic salt and finely chopped red nd green peppers.  I am not a fan of tomatoes AT ALL, but I added about a handful of chopped tomatoes and threw them in last to the mix.  I did not use a pastry crust.  The rest of the recipe I followed exactly.  I poured it directly in the pan, and cooked for the 45 minutes.  It rose about an inch above my pan, more on the sides, so I gave it a few more minutes for the middle to rise as well.  After I removed it, It shrunk back down.  I made this the night before and stuck it in the refridgerator.  TO REHEAT I moistened a paper towel and draped over desired slice to microwave for about 1 minute..... Just like fresh out of the oven!

Didn't really like this. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to double the recipe because I was using a deep dish pie crust.  It was way too thick.  I think the regular recipe would have been fine even with the deep dish.  As far as the taste, it was mediocre at best.  I may try this again using less bacon, more cheese and possibly spinach and/or mushrooms.

This barely filled 1/2 my regular pie shell, and tasted more like scrambled eggs in a pie crust than quiche. Needed way more milk and more cheese!

Over all a good recipe. I blended all of the ingredients in my new "Bullet". If you have one don't use it for this or you'll have mush as I did. I couldn't find the bacon or the sausage that I added after the "Bullet" was done. I think I will add two more eggs next time to see if that gives it a little more volume. Plus I'll mix it by hand. Not a bad quiche Angela. Thanks for the recipe. Oh. watch your cooking time. I had it in for 20 minutes. I ate it but I think it would have been too brown for company :)

I followed this recipe to a "tee".  It was dry and did not deliver in taste.  It was bland and did not have any "oomphf".  Very, very disappointing.  Next time, I will just make the call to my Aunt Ruthie for a Quiche recipte.

Quite delicious!  I made a couple of modifications: used less bacon and onion, added some leftover  rosemary ham deli slices, cut up into small pieces, as well as a handful of spinach, chopped (as much as I could add to the filling once I'd already poured everything into the pie dish).  I also increased the amount of milk to about 2/3 cup.  The quiche came out extremely flavourful and filling!

For the effort that went into this, I was not impressed. Even with the seasoning & the bacon it was just okay. I like hearty texture, but this was borderline heavy. Also, this does NOT fill a 9 inch pie tin; I had a full inch of crust around the edge that was not filled with quiche, even after baking. 
This is NOT a BAD recipe, I think it's just mediocre. I'm glad I tried it, but I won't be making it again.

I just quickly glanced at the ingredients for this recipe and went straight to the kitchen. I just guesstimated everything but it turned out perfectly. But I used different vegetables, no meat, and a lot more milk. This kind of thing is pretty much fail-proof and I love it! I used 5 eggs, about a cup and a half of milk, sweet yellow onion, broccoli, tomatoes, TONS of marble cheese and a bit of parmesan, and some grated carrot. I only put pepper and dried basil in for spices along with some salt. And for the crust I just mixed up my own off the top of my head. I rolled out a thin layer for the bottom of the pan and then cut the rest into thin star shapes to place on top. So good!

This is the perfect basic Quiche recipe.  I refer back to it when I want to make a quiche with ingredients that I have on hand.  I have changed it up with diced ham instead of bacon, shallots instead of onions, fresh herbs and a variety of cheeses.  It is a great recipe for a home base when you are feeling creative in the kitchen.

Nice recipe.  I suck in the kitchen yet this turned out well and my husband even went back for seconds.  I don't recommend adding any salt until you put it on your plate as the bacon makes the dish salty enough without adding more.

This quiche was a BIG hit with my family -- not a crumb left!  I think they prefer the milder flavor of the cheddar and mozzarella over the traditional Swiss.  Since it doesn't have cream, it's already healthier than a traditional Quiche Lorraine, but you could easily substitute low-fat cheddar and part-skim mozzarella to make it even healthier.  Also, without the cream, the quiche firms up faster and has a more dense texture.

Very good! I used 8 egg whites and one yolk. Fat free half and half in place of the milk. Six slices of turkey bacon in place of regular. A little more cheese too. We threw out the edge of the crust because I did not cover it, and it was too much crust. The filling did not rise very much. Overall, very tasty. We had it for dinner w/ potatoes.

The flavor is 5 stars, but it's not enough volume to fit in a 9-inch pie crust, so that's why it's docked a star. You'll need to add more of something, veggies, cheese, eggs, or milk, to get enough mixture for a decent quiche. Super tasty, though next time I will increase the bacon a bit. Thanks for sharing!

I made the recipe as is. The filling met halfway up crust. It was a tad bit overbaked at 45 minutes. Consistency was tougher than quiche I've had before. Flavor was okay.

Haven't tried this recipe but I like crustless quiche.  I think you can bake it without crust no matter what ingredients there are.

This recipe is great! I did make a couple of adjustments because I didn't have all of the listed ingredients. I used deli ham instead of bacon and I used fresh parsley instead of dried parsley.  I used a Fiesta Blend of cheese instead of the cheddar.  I also added an extra egg.  

It was wonderful and the consistency was great. I have used other recipes and they tended to be runny or too dry.  

Thanks so much and I will be making this using the recommended ingredients next time.

This recipe was very good, but I would omit the flour as it gave the quiche a pasty texture and mouthfeel.  The egg mixture will thicken up via the baking, so flour is not needed at all.

Thank you for this recipe.  I have been making Quiche Lorraine for years and this is a much better recipe than the one I used for so long.  I am embarrassed to say that my husband and I ate the whole quiche in one meal!  I really like that there is less liquid as it makes it easier to bake the custard and not over brown the crust. I followed the recipe exactly (except used turkey bacon and it was very good) and in my oven the baking time was only 35 min.  I will have fun trying different variations of this recipe. Easy & delicious dinner, lunch or brunch dish.

I rated Donna's Quiche a 5, but this is 1000 times better!  I even like it without a crust!
My dad is on the Atkins Diet and he loves this (with no crust of course!)

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. The flavor was pretty good, though I thought it did have some downfalls: Not cheesy enough, texture was too dry, and it turned out thin and heavy, not light and fluffy like a quiche should be. Overall it was okay, though I'll look for a different recipe next time.

13 years ago I added this recipe to my allrecipes box, and I've been making it ever since!  I put all different kinds of stuff in it, but always the 4 eggs, 2 tbsp milk, 2 tbsp flour, 3/4 cup shredded cheese. Always always always perfect quiche!

This is the first Quiche I've ever made! I was looking for something easy and delicious, and it was! Thank you for such a easy recipe! I will be using this for years to come! ~ ~  I used red peppers, onion, bacon, and a 3 cheese ( colby,cheeder,montery jack)!  I also used the roll out pie crust!  I also took some pictures but I was so hungry for it, I forgot to take the picture first! lol

It sounded like it would be good and I followed the recipe almost to a T, but it was heavy and kind of dry.  Would of been better with a little sour cream and more milk.

Needed to make the same changes the other posters noted: a bit dry...doubled the milk called for. It does not make enough to fill a 9" pie shell....had to use 1.5 times the eggs/milk/cheese. A tad bland...added basil and oregano. I did like my end product...with a fair number of changes though.

I only had 3 eggs so I used more cheese and a bit more milk to loosen it up a bit.  It was excellent!  I took another reviewers advice and baked the empty pie shell for 10 minutes before filling so that it wouldn't be soggy.  It turned out great - I will definitely make again!

Very good start, but I added another egg and 3/4 cup 1/2 & 1/2, instead of the milk.  I also used basil instead of thyme, because that is what I had on hand.  I also made mine crustless. Cooked for 50-55  minutes.  yum!

I liked the flavor of this.  Since I was running low on bacon I did only 4 slices of bacon and filled out the rest with roasted red pepper.  However, I felt like it was  bit chewy and it didn't have the fluffy texture I've tasted in other quiches.  This was my first time baking a quiche, though, so maybe it was me and not the recipe! It was definitely easy to make and I liked that I could do all the prep dishes while it baked.  Easy clean-up is always a plus for me.   For the record, watch your cooking time.  It says to cook for 45 minutes, but I only cooked it for 35 minutes and it was definitely finished and starting to get crispy on the edges by the time I took it out of the oven.

We modified this recipe to use some veggies we had in the fridge.  I only had 4 eggs so this is how I came across this recipe. It's a little denser than the normal quiche I make.  We liked it and will more than likely use it again.  If you are looking for a custard like quiche this is not the recipe for you.  We used ham, spinach, and mushrooms to replace the bacon and onion since this is what I had on hand.  The basics of this recipe allow you to have some flexibility with the recipe.

I loved this recipe, it was so simple to do and really worked. I think next time I'll only use 1/2 a small onion and not so many herbs and it's inspired me to try amking quiches with all sorts of different fillings, maybee I'll do bacon cheese and mushroom next :) Thanks !

I had no idea that quiche was this easy. Wow! I didn't have bacon on hand so I cut up some ham lunchmeat and my family loved it. I'll make this again. Now that I know the basic recipe for quiche I can hardly wait to see what other variations I can come up with.

I thought quiche was difficult to make, but this recipe was very easy. I added a small can of mushrooms, chopped green pepper and another egg. I gave the recipe to my mom and she used all hot pepper cheese and it was great! This will be used again for sure!!

It was dry and heavy and had a heavy onion flavor. After I changed the recipe to 1/3c onion, 1c half & half, no flour, no thyme, and 1+1/2 c grated Swiss, it was delicious! Light and fluffy.

Loved it, i am not a big Quiche eater, this was actually the second quiche i have ever made, and it came out perfectly (i should have baked it longer, to account for a higher altitude) but the difference wasn't noticable. added some mushrooms and some spices, left out the parsley and thyme, still great.

I didn't have all ingredients on hand, so I substituted what I did have. Instead of bacon I used minced ham, instead of cheddar cheese I used Parmesan, and I added a garlic and onion spice. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was delicious! My husband loved it and I know we will be making this again! In fact, I am pretty sure I will be having this for breakfast tomorrow. :)

This recipe is very tasty however the first time it turned out too dry.
Best option is to use 3 Tablespoons of milk and only 1 Tablespoon of flour.  Cook for only 30mins at 350 degrees and it turns out perfectly!!
Enjoy!

This is the first quiche I have ever made. It turned out perfect! I added 1 egg per other reviews and put in a cup of ground turkey sausage instead of bacon. Definitely will make again.

Yum!  This is a tasty recipe.  I used all mozzarella cheese and omitted the parsley because I didn't have any on hand.  I used a 9 inch pie plate and the filling didn't come very high on the side so next time I might increase the recipe by about a half.  Wonderful country flavor!

I add a few more eggs, spinach and additional seasoning with salt and pepper, and sometimes mushrooms.  If I use a deeper pie dish I always double the recipe and it's always excellent.  A little more milk or water tends to make it moister and not dry out to soon.  Love this recipe.

The first thing I will mention is to be sure not to use "ground" thyme in the recipe. It turned the filling greenish and the texture became powdery. I also used thick cut bacon, I think traditional would be better (but this is not the recipe's fault!). Barring that, it baked up just fine (after 30 minutes), but after adding one additional egg (based on others' comments) was still not enough to fill the shell. So I would recommend if you try this, perhaps add two eggs and more milk? An adequate quiche but not very exciting.

I was not impressed with this recipe. The hardest part of a quiche is making the crust, so use a different recipe for a real quiche, it's not that much harder. First of all I had to keep adding eggs in order to fill my pan. It basically tastes like scrambled eggs in a pie crust. It is not "creamy" like a quiche. I will not be making this recipe again.

Yes, Yes, YUM!!! A definite keeper. I've been making quiche like this for years. I do make some changes. instead of milk I use heavy cream and also add minced onions and a dash of season salt. I also add a sprinkle of green onions 15 minutes before removing from the oven and some shredded cheese. This is a keeper.

My husband hates the thought of Quiche, but he loved this one.  I used egg beaters instead of eggs and no milk, a few extra pieces of bacon and colby jack cheese.  It only took about 35 mins. Really really good.  I will make it again.

It was okay. I made the mistake of beatng the eggs and mixing ingredients the night before so I could just throw it in the pie crust and bake hte next morning, but I had to add 2 more eggs and beat all together to get the eggs to perk up again.  It came out quite dry, we thought. Less cook time? Will try this one again. It was simple enough!

This was really good.  I followed the recipe except for a few things.  I used 1 more egg, fat free 1/2 & 12, upped the cheese by about 1/2 more and put in some hot sauce for an extra kick.  I did not have any problems with the filling not being perfect for a 9 inch pie plate.  It was perfect and made for a nice Sunday morning brunch.

Good recipe but better with half and half.  I prefer a creamy, custardy, cheesy quiche and milk just doesn't cut it for me.

Wonderful!! I made this for my boyfriend for breakfast and he LOVED it! I added rice burgers which I chopped up instead of the bacon. Because the rice burgers already have herbs in them I omitted the herbs from the recipe. I would recommend beating your eggs at least 2 minutes before adding other ingredients to them. This is what I did and I had wonderful fluffy and perfectly flavored Quiche!! I will definitely be using this as a base recipe to all my quiche dishes from now on! I can’t wait to make another! I gave it only 4 stars because I changed a few things, and plan to continue to change things as I make it. Otherwise this was a great recipe!

this turned out great.  my mother is a diabetic so i modified the recipe for her.  i used a cup of egg beaters(eg whites) that equals the 4 eggs. i used pm to saute' the onion and added fresh chopped garlic and bell pepper.  i only used chedder cheese and used 6 slices of turkey bacon. i served it with tomato wedges that were salted and peppered to taste.  the dish was soooooo good and healthy.

Very tasty. I added broccoli instead of bacon and it complimented the dish very well. Next time I think I will double the recipe as it didn't really fill out the pie dish and was pretty shallow. The egg does puff up as the quiche cooks, so doubling it might be a bit much. What ever you do, be sure the fluted edges of your crust are thin. If they are too thick they will be too heavy and will slide down the side of the pie dish since the filling doesn't go all the way to the top of the crust and hold the fluting in place.

Very Good!    I added one more egg,  and used fresh herbs instead of dried.   The recipe doesn't give a cooking time.   I baked mine for about 35 minutes.     I'll be making this again. :)

This is a great recipe.  I have made it several times.  I've used different variations of fillings including sauteed deli ham and cheddar cheese.  It has turned out fabulous every time.  The only change I made to the recipe was using 1 Tbsp. of flour instead of 2.  If you use 2 tablespoons of flour, the quiche tastes too much like flour.  I recommend making 2 quiches because the leftovers are great.

This was so simple and so yummy!! I followed the recipe except for the cheese. I used one cup of each Jarlsberg & 5 year old cheddar. Wow!! The cheeses brought out so many wonderful flavours!

I am actually cooking off two of these quiches as we speak.  I did change things up a little based on the reviews.  I added 4 oz of low fat ricotta cheese, omitted the bacon, added 1 bunch of swiss chard to the first quiche and 1 bunch of kale to the second quiche.  For both the chard and the kale, I wilted them down as I was doing the onions.  I am really looking forward to having some of this tomorrow morning :)

I made two different versions of this recipe at the same time...the original and one with bell peppers and tomatoes. Both had a strange taste to me, and believe I narrowed it down to the thyme. I haven't really cooked with it before, and I dont think I like it...lol  I really think the recipe would have been delicious without the thyme in it, so I gave it 4 stars. My advice: if your going to make it, unless you know you like thyme, I would cut it. Other than that, It should be delicious. I may try it again myself without it. =)

This was my first time making a quiche.  It was pretty good.  I didn't have bacon so I used ham.  I also  shredded some potatoes and softened them with the onions.  It was probably more hearty than a normal quiche but I'm a hearty guy.  Next time will add green pepper.

Great starter quiche recipe.  You can add about anything to this quiche. I always use more eggs because 4 is never enough to fill the shell.  Taste amazing!

Very easy and delicious.  I followed other suggestions and baked the empty crust for about 10 minutes.  I also added a little extra mozzarella and about 3/4 chopped fresh broccoli which I cooked in a little bacon grease for a few minutes.  I will definitely make it again!

I used an un baked pie crust trimmed with a foil hood as indicated and it did not cook.  The crust was terrible.  The egg mixture was good but if I made it again I would use a baked shell and use the hood then.

The quiche was actually over cooked in our often at 45 minutes.  Next time, I will cook it less.  My husband and I didn't particularly like the thyme in the recipe and next time will try without.

We tried this out this morning. We were going to just buy a store made quiche until I came across this recipe. Easy, delicious, and will become a staple in our house! However, be careful with what you think is a small onion, you could easily use to much!  We plan on using sausage in the mix also next time. Thanks so much for this!!

quick, easy, great tasting. Made some easy changes, as the current recipe did not fill my pie shell. I added two more eggs and 1/2 C milk. The milk added "fluffyness". I also added more shredded cheese. Thanks for the recipe... we love it!

The flavor of this is great!!! I used dried herbs because that is all I had and it was still delicious.  Next time I will leave out the flour....took away the nice custard you usually get in a quiche.

The cooking time is definitely too long, but even if it were reduced, this is just an "okay" recipe...not a bad meal by any means, but not necessarily one I'd add to my rotation either.

I pretty much just used the egg base/cheese ratio and made it my own by using different ingredients. I started off with a whole wheat crust, sauteed an onion, added turkey kielbasa and threw in some chopped spinach as my mix, poured in the egg, topped it with cheese.   The flour didn't take very well to being beaten and there were visible clumps of it in the egg batter, but when it baked, I couldn't tell. The recipe was the ultimate definition of delicious.

I love this, making it often.  I make it exactly as directed using a frozen (NOT deep dish) pie crust and it fits perfectly.  I like how it is dense and not runny.  It does only take about 30 minutes though.  I have used the same recipe to make crustless mini-quiches in a muffin tin.  These heat up great for breakfast in about 30 seconds.

Tasty quiche!  I used French's fried onions that I had leftover instead of sauteing an onion.  I also added an extra egg.  Very good!

I followed the recipe to a tee.  My only complaint is that the quiche came out a bit on the dry side.  I'll definitely make this again, though, because the flavor was excellent.  Next time I'll just double the milk and see if that makes it a bit moister.

Very good. I use 5 eggs though, to give it more body and I use whatever veggies I have in the fridge- especially spinach!

I used sausage and colby-jack cheese in this recipe, and also fresh farm eggs which made it even better. The mixture is fairly thick, there isn't much liquid. This concerned me and I thought that I had made a mistake, but it turned out beautifully! Very quick and simple to make. My first guinea pigs were men, and they loved it. The kids will try it tomorrow for breakfast, so we'll see how well it reheats.

45 minutes bake time was too long!  30 would have been about right...I should have checked it sooner.  It also needs more eggs and milk to fill the pie shell properly.  The taste was good but over-cooked.  Will need to experiment.  As written this quiche made three main dish servings with fruit salad on the side.  And I am a tiny person!

I made this for a Sunday brunch and was very disappointed.  It didn't fill a 9 inch pastry shell and wouldn't have served 6 people. Will not make it again.

My husband and I LOVED this quiche. The first time I made it,it was simply delicious. We ate the whole thing in one night. I change it up every time  according to what I have on hand and it still comes out great. Very versatile recipe.

Great quiche.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I substituted some leftover ham chunks for the bacon, about 1 1/2 cups.  I think the quiche only serves six.

I used the basic recipe from here, but used ham, onions, mushrooms, and broccoli instead of the meat & veggies called for here. It came out lovely, but I was frustrated by the lack of cooking time mentioned in the recipe. I doubled it, making 2 quiches, and they took about 25 minutes at 350.

I have made many quiches in the past however this one turned out perfect.  I was a little worried because it seemed like not enough filling when I poured it into the pie pan.  I baked it for 30 minutes and it turned out great.  I also precooked the crust as others recommended because soggy crust can ruin a good quiche.

After reading the reviews, I did modify the recipe, and it turned out really good.  I added 2 more eggs, and a lot of milk (maybe a cup?).  I also left out the bacon (for my vegetarian daughter).  I love cheese, so I added a lot - cheddar, mozzarella and pepper jack.  The pepper jack gave it wonderful flavor, and I think it would be too bland for me without it.  It was delicious.

Wonderful recipe.   I made the dish for a dinner party and it was a huge hit.   We keep the dish in the oven for 45 minutes.   The recipe for 6 servings doesn't fill a traditional pie fully.   We put in 1 more egg and a splash of milk to help even out the top.

An easy quiche recipe. I added half and half and more milk than called for to fill up the pie pan. Easy to play with the recipe and add what you prefer.

I tried this recipe because the boyfriend doesnt really like fluffy quiches, which this def is not. It's more hearty. I like them fluffy, but if I want quiche (which I want it often) I end up making it this way so I can satisfy my craving. I did this twice. The first time I didn't have enough mozzarella but subbed with extra cheddar. No flour. Used a little more milk and an extra 2 eggs because it was a deep dish pie plate. I use the Pillsbury roll-out pie dough. (They come in a 2-pack and are easily frozen/thawed.) Plus they taste so much better than pre-baked shells and save a lot of time. The second time I didn't add the spices and I think I liked it better without. Also, this is great with pepperjack but if we don't have any, I chop up some jalapeno for some kick. Great recipe.

I wish I could give this 4 1/2 stars. The only thing I didn't care for, which  was my own fault, was the onion. Next time I'll dice them much, much smaller, and decrease the amount a bit. I only had a big onion, so I only used half of it, and it was still really strong in the dish. Other than that, FAB!

A Great Basic Quiche! I added the bacon crumbles in with the onion and I choped about 1/2c broccoli and put that in the pan with the onions. I also lined the crust with the shredded mozzarella to keep it dry (creating a 'raincoat' for the crust; and I crumbled a goat cheese within the mixture with some dried cranberries which sweetened thigs up a bit. Also the four eggs were not enoug mixture so I whisked in a can of hot condensed milk before adding the other ingrediants. Ok, i changed it a lot, but it turned out lovely! It was perfectly moist, not at all wet, and the consistency was marvelous! Be creative!

I made it to take to a potluck.  It was a huge hit with everyone!  I took two of my kids & they loved it...and so did the other folks at the potluck.

I used Four Cheese Italian instead of the swiss, used ham instead of the bacon (it's what I had on hand) and increased the cheese just a bit.

It bakes up to be a firm but tender quiche with terrific flavor.

This is a wonderful recipe for a beginner cook like me. I didn't add the thyme and parsley because I didn't have any. And I added a touch of garlic salt to the onions and it came out great. My husband loved it! He could have just been saying that though...

We fixed this on a night that there wasn't much in the cupboard and didn't feel like going out.  We had everything in the house so went with this recipe.  I would give it a "5" for ease alone but I think it was a little plain.  I imagine it would make a great breakfast meal.  I will keep this recipe and definitely will make it again.  Thank you for sharing.

My husband and I both really liked this. I'm very glad this recipe was the  first quiche he's eaten. I used a medium-sized shallot instead of an onion and 2 tbsp of real bacon-bits instead of making bacon. I loved the blend of cheeses and will try it again in the future w/ more gourmet cheeses and different additions to the filling. I didn't have a problem with the filling/pan size; it all fit perfectly in a regular-sized frozen pie crust. I cooked it for 36 minutes at 350, which seemed a bit long to me, so I'll bump the heat up a bit next time. Thanks for a very easy and tasty recipie!

This was very good.  I added some spinach while sauteing the onions and also added dill to the spices.  Even though I (OOPS) used a graham cracker crust which was a tad sweet for this dish, it came out very tasty and was still quite edible!  :)  I will make this again with a regular pie crust.

This was delicious. I made it according to the directions and was very pleased with the way it turned out. After baking it, I froze it as part of a Once-a-Month cooking session. I let it thaw in the fridge overnight and heated it this morning. I served it at a ladies' luncheon. Everyone requested the recipe. I will definitely make it again. Thank you Angela!

This is an excellent quiche.  It had a firm consistency that was not squishy or wet.  I used 8 oz. of sausage instead of bacon.  My husband suggested crumbling bacon on top.  I'll be making this one again!

this was awesome!!  I added 1 more egg and a little more cheese.  My family liked it a lot.  I did put the flour in but I think it would be fine if you omit it.  It was not dry at all.

This was wonderful!  We made it this morning for our Christmas morning breakfast!  Easy to make, and the flavor was wonderful!  I made sure that I made enough to fill two 9" pie dishes so that we had enough to feed the 5 of us for breakfast!!Thank you for the recipe, I will definitely make this again, and I will pass on the recipe to my friends!!

This recipe was so easy!  I had some sage sausage handy so I substituted it for the bacon.  In a pinch you can use the name brand frozen pie shells and it still turns out great (it doesn't beat Mom's pie shell, but...).  Great for a get together with the in-laws- quiche impresses most picky eaters!

Delicious!  Definitely a flatter quiche, but the flavor more than makes up for it.  I left out the onion, used turkey bacon,added some dill and garnished with tomato slices.  Gorgeous and absolutely irresistable.

I made this wonderful quiche for dinner and despite what some of the other reviewers have said, I didn't find it dry at all.  It was delicious.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  Another plus - it was simple to make!

Even after adding more milk there was not enough custard. Flavor was good it was just dense and not fluffy like  my quiche normally is.

I made this recipe tonite, adding 2 additional eggs as some previous reviewers suggested. Everything else I did exactly per the recipe. I had the oven timer set for 5 minutes shy of 45 so I could check it. It was completely overdone and dried out.

My family and I really like this, and I cooked it straight as described. No complaints and it allows you to tweek for your families taste. Never cooked Quiche until this, ate it yes, but not cooked it. I have had some quiche tthat is way to fluffy or light which is not true quiche. Its not a meringue!

My family asked me to add this to our favorites list.  I read other reviews and made minor modifications:  used cream instead of milk, 6 eggs rather than 4, and used small amounts of cumin, rosemary, basil and thyme.  I used the bacon and onion, but added pancetta and broccoli.  Delicious!

Thank you for this wonderful recipe! I made this for a ladies brunch I hosted and got rave reviews about it. I made it in the Easy Pie Crust from this site and added some chopped red peppers, broccoli, and carrots for some extra colors and flavors... Delicious!

I make this for my kids and they really like it. I like to try different things in the quiche. It always comes out great. I use the blender to mix every thing together in really saves time. It is really simple my girls sometimes make this.

I had some pie crust I made before sitting in my freezer to use so I decided it was quiche time. I used this recipe as more of a guide, in that I used a half pound of bacon instead of counting out 8 slices, about a cup and a half of frozen broccoli that I sautéed with the onions, everything that looked good in my spice cabinet, and a quarter cup of pepperjack instead of mozzarella cheese. I also generously sprinkled parmesan cheese over the top. It turned out fabulously. The entire quiche was eatten by 3 adults and 2 children in one night! I’m definitely making this again.

This is a great base recipe for quiche. To make perfect for my household, I add two extra eggs, at least a 1/2 cup of extra vegetables (usually sweet peppers and/or spinach), no cheese, and a lot more herbs from the spice rack. I also substitute sausage for the bacon (about 4 polish sausages). Turns out great every time!

easy and good. tasty with thyme, but probably not necessary. i did 1 and 1/2 of the recipe to fill the deep dish pie crust. i also did not do bacon or onion, but added small tiny broccoli florets.

This was the very first time I ever made quiche. My boyfriend and I made it together and we were so excited! We were a little disappointed though  because it wasn't light and fluffy like it is when you get it at a restaurant. I used store bought pie crust and it was overdone and all we could taste was scrambled eggs and pie crust. It didn't have much flavor.  We even added mushrooms and ham. I will definitely make it again but will adjust the cooking time and will make my own crust! But it was a great "first" recipe. Thanks Angela!

This was awesome. I made my own simple crust using a recipe online and used this for the filling. Turned out great and flavorfull. Althoug I didn't have cheddar. I used a italian mix of six different cheeses.

I tried this because I had everything at hand and was looking for something a little different for lunch for my husband. I didn't Mozzarella so I put 1/4 cup of grated Parm and I chopped up a small fresh bell pepper to saute with the onions. Then, because my hubby likes his eggs well done I put 1/2 of a small tomato chopped right before I put it in the pie crust to keep some moisture in even though the eggs would be done. It was very tight and tasty, but I would not double, bI would do 1.5 the ingredients because it did not fill the pie shell. Other than that it was a really good lunch and we have enough for a second. We will see how it re-heats! Overall it is a good choice for sure.

This was a fun basic recipe. I made it for Christmas breakfast and enjoyed it with my husband and I. We don't eat pork so used turkey bacon instead, I like a lot of veggies so added about half a green pepper and diced plum tomato. Really enjoyed it and will make again.

This quiche was good and very simple to make.  We did make a few alterations to the recipe.  We used a pre-made deep dish pie crust, three-fourths of a large red onion instead of the small onion, added two tablespoons of half-and-half, and one-eighth of a teaspoon of nutmeg.  Next time we would add one more egg, more cheese, and possibly change up the spices.

I thought this quiche was a little bland, but it could easily be improved by adding a few favorite ingredients. The main issue is that the ingredients do not fill a deep dish pie shell. Either make more filling or do not use a deep dish pie shell.

Very good!  I too added bacon for additional flavor.  It worked for both dinner & breakfast (as I work nights)!  I did feel it needed something.......an herb of some kind.  I'll probably try some rosemary, basil, or something on my second try.  But overall~~great recipe!

This is amazing quiche! My guests loved it and so did I! The only thing I might change next time is add a few green onions and mushrooms--the green onions because I love the flavor they give and the mushrooms because I'm a mushroom addict. Absolutely delicious!

Flour in a quiche recipe? Hmm...NO! Add an extra egg or two and extra splash of cream or half and half. Some green onions too. :) I followed the recipe, I will not follow it again.

First I have to say that I am not really a breakfast food person.  It was ok, but not something I will make again unless I have guests over and cannot find anything else.  I used 6 eggs, upped the cheddar cheese to 1 cup, upped the mozarella cheese, used 4 Tbs of milk.  I think the others that doubled the recipe must have been using a pie pan, because it did not all fit in the quiche pan.  I used the No Fail Pie Crust III recipe from this site, a recommendation from another reviewer.  It was my first time making a pie crust and it turned out flaky and wonderful.

I love this recipe so much because it's so easy and versatile!  I usually make it with a refrigerated pie crust from the grocery store, and also made it today with a frozen pie crust and it was also great.  I've used bacon and ham, almost always left over from breakfast or dinners, with pretty much any type of cheeses, and I add in veggies like broccoli or spinach (tonight I used leftover veggies from last night - broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots all chopped up tiny and it was yummy!)... it's a great way to hide in a few extra veggies for kids.  Thanks for the great recipe - it's become an easy staple in our house!

A little dense for my liking, but good easy recipe.  I did use more milk and cut back on the onions, I think it was the thyme that really gave it a different flavor, nice.

I liked this quiche a lot I changed it a tad I used Monterey Jack and blue cheese. It had really nice flavor and it was even better the next day heated up. I also took another reviewers advice and baked the crust a little first.

Recipe was good, but not great. The quiche was a bit dense, so I would follow others' recommendations and increase the amount of milk or half and half a bit. I also felt the amount of bacon called for was a bit too much, and more cheese could have been added as well.

Easy recipe.  Increase half and half to 1/2 cup for lighter, fluffier quiche.
We have made several times and have not been disappointed.

This was my first quiche and my husband decided that he wanted me to make it for Sunday breakfast each and every week.

This was a great starter recipe which gave me an idea of where I wanted to go.

I left out the bacon, used green onions, more parsley instead of thyme, subbed in Jalapeño soy cheese and soy milk. (Lactose intolerant husband)

I added a sprig of chopped fresh Rosemary but it only took over the entire flavor scheme drowning out the more subtle tastes.

I have made this several times & absolutely love it...get alot of compliments on it, too. I use crescent rolls as the crust which gives it a different texture. Tried it today with bacon bits due to lack of time to fry bacon...it was good.

Very delicious but next time i will try to bake it without the crust because it looses a lot of its flavor in crust. It's thick to bake without it. Definitely a great recipe.

Excellent! Very simple. Just changed some ingredients I didn't have home with me. Instead of mozzarella, I added 2T of parmesan cheese and sprinkled some on top of mixture; I also made the dough from scratch: 1 1/2 Cups of flour, 1 stick of butter (softened), 4T of cold water and salt. It was great! Thank you!

Lots of flavour, but much too heavy.  I would use 1 cup of milk and only 3 eggs with a pastry shell, but for crustless cut down on the milk and take it back to 4 eggs.

This cooked up dry, firm, and nothing like a real quiche. No moist, fluffy creaminess.  I should have known because there is no evaporated milk or cream in the recipe, but it got good reviews so I thought I would try it.  We threw it out.

I followed the recipe and it came out great.  My changes were that I used turkey bacon and provolone cheese.  (That is what I had on hand)  My husband even liked it, and he isn't crazy about quiche.

I used onion powder instead of chopped onion and sausage instead of bacon. I added garlic powder and green pepper. I don’t think it should be cooked for 45 mins mine was done in 15 mins. Besides that I will be making it again.

I made it exactly the way the recipe states except I didn’t add onions. It tasted like flour & it was too dense. I prefer a fluffier quiche.

Made this the other day. First, I have made a LOT of quiche and have never seen one that called for flour. I did follow the recipe as written & the flavor was ok. However, it did not make enough to fill a deep dish shell. It turned out flat and dry. Mixing the bacon, onion & cheeses into the egg was a mistake. I ended up having to use a fork to redistribute them. Plus, recipe called for too much baking time. It was completely done in just 30 min.  I ended up having to put it under the broiler of my toaster oven to brown the crust. Next time I'll make some changes. 1) no flour; 2) 6 eggs instead of 4; 3) 3/4 cup of both cheeses instead of 1/2 cup of each; 4) 1/4 cup of heavy cream + 1/4 cup milk to make it richer.  At some point if I want it with a little bite, I'll substitute pepper jack for the mozzarella.

I love this recipe and have been making it for years. It's One of the few I've found that doesn't call for a ton of eggs. I omit the parsley, sometimes add a clove of garlic. And I've made a spinach version with and without bacon. Great, versatile recipe!

Upped the milk to a cup, and the cheese to 1 1/2 cups.  Used sauteed chopped pork roll instead of bacon.  Loved it.

I used a deep dish pie shell and doubled the recipe. I hadn't intended to, but the first shell was pre-baked too much and fell apart. 

I also bought pre-cooked bacon, diced it up and threw it in the pan with the onion I had started sautéing in the pan with Kerrygold Butter.

I followed the rest of the recipe. It was delicious and a hit with the people I worked the elections with.

I einjoyed the taste of the quiche and it is easy and quick to make. I usually make my quiche with more egg and milk so this recipe didnt have the rich taste of the egg/milk mixture.  I may modify it and add more  egg/milk and see if it's a keeper or not.
I wouldn't make it again using the exact same recipes but with some doctoring will be yummy.

I like to double the recipe, add a pound of browned onion sausage, and pour  into two pie crusts. I have also added a jar of drained mushrooms if I have them on hand. This is one of  my husband's favorite dishes because it heats up well for breakfast the next day! I like it because it freezes well.

I will make this again but I personally don't like  the thyme in it. And it just wasn't quite flavorful enough. Maybe a stronger cheese would help. I added 2 extra eggs and a couple tablespoons of half and half. And also I sprinkled extra cheese on top after it was done and put it back in the oven to melt it.

Used my homemade crust (1 C flour, 1/4 c butter, 1 - 3 TBSP of cold milk) and came out fantastic for Christmas brunch, even meat eating men loved it :)

Used extra egg and green onion for flavor.  Also used bacon bits; after researching, I found out 2tsp = 1 strip of bacon. Tasted great and I love that there was no heavy cream.

This is the best Quiche recipe. I followed the recipe just as it is. Next time I will make two (6 inch) seeing that I'm not able to have cheese and I love spinach, my husband can have his and I will have my own.......yummy! I had taken it out of the oven seven minutes earlier, and it was perfect.

I make this all the time and just change up what I put in the filling.  I even put edamame in there sometimes.  I normally make 2 pie crusts and just freeze one for later.  So good!

Didn't have the thyme but still came out great.  Baking time shortened by 10 minutes and still firm in center and brown on top.  The wife loved it (or was it that I actually cooked?  Hmmmm).  Will make again.

Easy and delicious. I added spinach as well.  To change it up, I use whatever veggies I have on hand.

I made this but used 1/4 cup of turkey sausage crumbles instead of bacon, half a zucchini grated, a small orange bell pepper and a 1/4 onion minced. Delicious! I are half of it!

I made this for my husband, sister and brother-in-law.  They all liked it but I didn't think it was creamy enough.  I'm going to delete this one and try to find another with more cream or cheese.

This recipe yields a very smooth and creamy quiche.  I used 3/4 cup shredded cheddar and 3/4 cup swiss and didn't have to add additional seasoning.

I followed the recipe and this came out perfectly.  Delicious!  Next time we plan to add some mushrooms and maybe some diced jalepenos to sautee with the onions.

This recipe tastes great, but something is wrong with the ingredient measurements and with the cooking time.  I found an almost identical recipe that uses 1.5 cups of milk and .5 cup of flour.  It instructs to put the bacon, onion, and the cheeses on the crust before pouring in the egg mixure. It also bakes the quiche for 35 minutes.  I plan to make this again with the modifications and, hopefully, change my rating.

This may well be my new staple quiche recipe! It came out so well. It was perfectly set and so tasty. I did make a few changes, including the use of italian seasoning and garlic & pepper salt. I think I will add an extra egg in the future. It definitely needs a little something to fill out the filling a bit. But, in terms of consistency and ease, I love it!

I have never made quiche before but this recipe it was easy and yummy!  I think next time I would only use 6 slices of bacon because the bacon seemed to overpower the dish and I added another egg to it as well.  Overall very good and I will definitely make it again.  I also added spinach to mine.

I have made this a couple times and it has always turned out fantabulous!  My whole family enjoyed it so much, I made two this last time!  Instead of bacon, I used cubed ham and a box of chopped spinach.  Delish!
