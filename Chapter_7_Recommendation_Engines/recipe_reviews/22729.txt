Fantastic! Our new favorite lasagna recipe.  A few changes: I chopped the raw spinach and sauteed it with the onions, mushrooms, and garlic until onions were tender-crisp.  I was skeptical about using a whole onion, but it really provided extra flavor and texture. Also, I omitted the parmesan (which appears in the directions but not in the ingredient list) and just sprinkled extra romano on the last layer.  I wasn't sure where I was supposed to end up with the layering process, so after the romano, I topped it off with a layer of noodles, my last bit of sauce, and a good sprinkling of mozzarella cheese. For the sake of evennness throughout, next time I will alter the layering portions to 2c filling (three inside layers), 3/4c cheese (three inside layers plus top), and just over 3/4c sauce (three inside layers plus top). Thanks Robbie for the recipe!!!

This is an excellent recipe if you make adjustments to the amount of the ingredients. To me, you cannot call this recipe Spinach Lasagna if you use only 2 cups of fresh spinach. I believe I ended up using at least 10 cups. I had a 1 lb. tub of baby spinach and used almost all of it.  I also increased the mushrooms to 4 cups.  For the ricotta I bought a pound and a half from the deli.  I did not boil the spinach. I sauted it with the onions, mushrooms and garlic. This saves a step and a pot.          I have no idea how you use up 20 lasagna noodles in a 9 x 13 pan. I always use nine noodle and make 3 layers. For this recipe I layered a little differently than the direction.. I just mixed the ricotta cheese, Roman Cheese, egg and spices. I did not add the mushroom mixture. I layered as follows: Sauce at bottom of pan, layer of noodles, spread half of the ricotta mixture, sprinkled 1 cup of mozzarella, spread half of the spinach mixture, spread 1 cup of sauce and sprinkled 1/3 cup parmesan. I repeated this layering one more time.  Then I placed the top layer of noodles, I put the remaining mozzarella and parmesan on top of the noodles and then topped it with the remaining sauce. I found it took longer than 1 hour to cook.         This recipe turned out great. I am not so sure I would have liked it as well with the amount of spinach and mushrooms called for. This received excellent reviews from everyone who tried. it.

I made this for a dinner party, and it was a hit!  I did make a few changes, though.  I substituted 1 14-oz can chopped artichoke hearts (non-marinated) for the mushrooms.  Also, I did not pre-cook the noodles, but instead just ran them under hot water before layering them and added about 1/3 cup water to the cheese mixture.  They turned out perfectly.  I was also very generous with the tomato sauce.  I will probably add more spinach next time.  There were no kids at the party, so I'm not sure about the kid-friendly rating...but my husband, who hates all vegetables, ate two helpings!

I love spinach lasagna, and this one went over quite well. I did add quite a bit more spinach than just 2 cups fresh - that will hardly give you anything once it's cooked. I also tried a new technique and bought baby spinach in a package and didn't cook it. I layered the noodles, cheese mix and spaghetti sauce with the fresh spinach, packing in quite a bit of the fresh stuff. It turned out pretty well! And it saved a step (and a pan). Also used no-boil noodles for the first time, and was surprised to find that they actually do work pretty well (and save another step and pan). I have made lasagna based on this a few times since (not bothering to follow the recipe exactly - just from memory). I've also used frozen spinach and it works well. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Can't say enough about this recipe. (I finally registered on this site after years so that I could rate this one!) The Ricotta/Mushroom/Spinach filling was the key. (TIP: This filling is Fantastic used to stuff/ bake with Salmon.) And like others I am sure I used a load more spinach.  Don't worry about people not liking the spinach, because my husband the Carnivore was fighting with his picky brother for the leftovers!  By the way, this freezes well! I froze it uncooked and baked from frozen at temp stated. My only changes: didn't have the romano and added a tad bit of FRESH grated nutmeg to the spinach.  And make sure you use a good (not overpowering) sauce.  Thanks Robbie!

This was delicious. I followed another reviewer's tips and sauteed artichokes with the onions and garlic and also added extra tomato sauce with each layer to keep it moist. I also doubled the boiled spinach and even added fresh spinach to each layer and it was so good. I used 5 pieces of lasagna for each of the three layers. I also removed the foil 5-7 minutes before the end of the hour to let the cheese bubble up and crust a little. Everyone LOVED it and the leftovers were ridiculously good. Will definitely make again.

UPDATE: During Lent 2011, I made this recipe for my boyfriend's Catholic family for dinner on a Friday, and while they were making fun of me for my "hippie lasagna" they liked it. I went to grab leftovers out of the fridge for lunch the next day, and they had already been consumed by people who made fun of me and my hippie lasagna. ORIGINAL REVIEW: This was amazing! My roommate is a vegetarian, so we decided to try this one night.  I wasn't keen on the idea because I'd tried many terrible meatless lasagnas in the past. But, one bite and I was hooked.  You barely even notice that it's lacking a meat flavor.  I did make some changes...I used light cheese and had to use cooked frozen spinach because fresh was banned at the time. We used Prego sauce. I also forgot to add the egg. We had a lot of filling left, probably because we like thin layers.  I'd recommend this recipe...even to people who love meaty lasagna!

My picky-eater girlfriend won't touch mushrooms, so I substituted brocolli.  To spare a few steps and dirty dishes, I sauteed the brocolli with the onions, then added the spinach to cook.  Then, after allowing some time to cool, I stirred the cheeses, egg, and herbs right into the veggies in the pan.  No electric mixer needed.

This had to be one the best recipes for lasagna I've ever tried let alone made. The only changes I made to this was I added an additional clove of minced garlic, substituted 1 cup ricotta for cream cheese, and used baby portabellas as my mushroom of choice. I had my family over and they are meat lovers but opened their eyes with this recipe! I will make it a point to keep this one in my personal recipe stash.

After many concerns and no answers on other reviews here are my own answers after finishing the recipe: YES you can make ahead, I stored mine uncooked in the fridge overnight and cooked it next day for dinner, just don’t cook the noodles; buy pre-cooked and add a little bit more sauce. YES you can use cottage cheese, just drain it for a while and press it so most of the water comes off the taste is very similar to ricotta and cheaper. YES you can add a layer of meat, just cook it with a little minced garlic and olive oil. NO the spinach is not enough, add 1 more cup. And finally YES you can cook the spinach with the mushroom/onion mix.

Best lasagne EVER! My tweaks as recommended by other reviewers: 4 cups of mushrooms, 1 lb baby spinach. Sauté spinach with onions, mushrooms, and garlic. Layered: 1 c sauce, 3 noodles, 1/3 of cheese mixture, 1 c mozzarella, 1/3 of spinach-mushroom mixture, 1 c sauce. Repeat layers. Last layer add just a little tomatoe sauce and mozzarella. Bake covered in foil for 50 minutes, last 10 minutes add 1/3 c parmesean and bake uncovered last 5-10 minutes.

I absolutely LOVED this ....I've made many veggie (And meat)  lasagnas and this is so good. I think it might be the electric mixer step that improves this. I followed the recipe as given, didn't really pay too much attention to the layering as I've made lots of lasagna over the years so familiar with that.  It is really a keeper for us. My only change was to add a chopped green bell pepper because it was getting soft and the only thing worse than paying $2 for a pepper is having it go bad before you use it. Nice recipe Robbie.

This was the most flavorful lasagna that I have made and my husband raved about it.  I only had about half the mozzerella cheese on hand and it was still great!  I also used rice noodles to make it gluten free and it was so delicious!  The left overs were even better!

BEST Lasagna ever!!!!  So much flavor.  Cooked the spinach with the onions & garlic as others suggested.  Bought the no boil noodles.  Not a fan of ricotta cheese, so used cottage cheese instead.  Didn't see any reason to beat the cottage cheese mixture.  Used smoked provolone cheese for the 2nd layer.  You can't go wrong making this.

This was my first attempt for a meatless lasagna, and despite the comedy of errors on my side (not enough noodles, spilled Romano all over the floor so omitted, only had about 1 cup of tomato sauce, etc.), this turned out really well!  My husband and children really liked this.  I'll make it again and perhaps get the Romano in the dish next time....

I made this ahead and froze it, uncooked to take on a skiing weekend. I put it in a cooler for the 5 hour car trip, then in the fridge when we arrived. Defrosted on the counter the next day and baked it that night.. It was awesome!! Everyone loved it! Very highly recommended.I cooked a whole bag of fresh baby spinach, but it didn't seem like enought, so I added a 10 oz. box of frozen chopped spinach as well. Next time I will just use two boxes of frozen to make it easier.

This was awesome my family just became vegetarian and this was a really nice transition from our meat lasagna.  I used sliced portabella mushrooms and I also diced up some red and green peppers and used fresh herbs instead of dried. Very good recipe will make this again.

This was very good.  I added a bit more fresh spinach, which I sautéed with the mushrooms and onion and also added a few tablespoons of Alfredo sauce in the layers.  I just mixed everything together with a wooden spoon.  My lasagna noodles were on the small side, so I used just about as many as the recipe called for.   Was looking for a spinach lasagna and this is now my go-to recipe.  Thanks for submitting!

Delish! I used almost 2 full 10 oz bags of spinach. Added 1 can of quartered artichoke hearts (skipped the mushrooms since I don't like them.) I also sauteed eggplant and zucchini and put them in the mix.

This was the best lasagna recipie I've ever tried.  I made it for my family and everyone loved it.  I did add more spinach than the recipe calls for. A whole bag of fresh spinach that was.  I also didn't use all the pasta noodles it called for because my baking tray wasn't as big.  Served it with salad and garlic bread.  Thee best, I will definatly make it again and again.

I made this last night for company and it was fabulous!  I watched the video for making vegetarian lasagna so I added red roasted peppers to the layers.  Additionally, I added roasted tomatoes.  I ended up using a combination of a pre-prepared marina sauce and a tomato basil sauce and used more than the recipe called for.  I used a five cheese Italian blend to top the last layer and put some additional roasted tomatoes for garnish.  I needed to bake it an additional fifteen minutes because I used a very deep dish.  I made a side meat dish - braised short rib, pork sausage, and the Nirvana meatballs in a brown sauce - yummy!  Added spinach salad with kalamata olives, red onion, and shaved Irish cheddar cheese topped with Marzetti spinach bacon salad dressing with baked Italian garlic bread ....big HIT!

Oh man, this is delicious! Not really all that low-fat, but I did use 4% ricotta and reduced fat mozzarella. If you make it I recommend using twice as much spinach as it calls for and not boiling it first like it says - why  throw all the vitamins down the drain? Just stir it into the ricotta as is (you might want to chop it if not using baby spinach).

Best spinach lasagna I've ever made.  Everyone loved it, even my 6-yr-old (pickiest eater in the world), who didn't even complain about seeing "green" thinks in the pasta!  I also used the "no boil" lasagna and it came out fine.  For even more veggies, I shredded one carrot and added it to saute pan with the onion and mushrooms.  For the sauce, I used the Prego with portabella mushrooms for an even more mushroom kick.  Thanks for the recipe. This came out great.

We had a small dinner party with this lasagna and garlic bread.  It consisted of 4 adults and 3 kids ranging from 11 to 13.  The rating was considered yummy from everyone involved.  In fact, one kid who never eats much had 2 helpings.  On adult who hates onions loved it, one kid who refuses to eat mushrooms ate it with pleasure, and someone else who hates artichokes said they loved it.  I altered the recipe slightly... I added a few more cloves of garlic, an additional 2 cups of cottage cheese to the cheese mixture, an additional 3 cups of pasta sauce, I added the artichokes as suggested in an earlier review, and I used fresh basil instead of dried.  I also layered a couple of layers with a little fresh spinach. It was beyond phenomenal.  Thanks for a company ready recipe.

This recipe is a very good twist on a classic dish.  If you use fresh herbs and garlic your kitchen smells divine.  The multi-step process may put ants in your kids pants, but they'll enjoy layering the lasagna if carefully supervised.  All in all, one of the best lasagnas I've tried.

This lasagna was excellent.  I added a little bit extra spinach, mushrooms, and onions which worked out great.  I used fat free ricotta and low fat mozzarella to save a few calories.  I omitted romano cheese and it all tasted wonderful.  Although my boyfriend and I are meat eaters, we liked this lasagna better than the meat lasagna I make.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was absolutely delicious! I made it for dinner with fried fish and got compliments from everyone! I also thought it could use a little more spinach and sauce but was fantastic anyway! I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1 1/2 tsp Italian Seasoning instead of basil and oregano (didn't have any on hand). Hubby said "This is a regular!"

This lasagna was excellent.  I think it could have more spinach to actually be considered spinach lasagna, but boy was it good!  And my boyfriend (not a regular cook) made it and it was still delicious!!

I went with the suggested change-up for Easter this year & made the Spinach lasagna.  My entire family murmured the "Is she kidding?" Not only that, I hadn't made lasagna for 30+ years!  3 tries & I got the noodles to come out right.  I used the freshest, best ingredients available to assure success on such an important day....Easter. He is risen! Believe in Jesus & you have eternal life!  So simple! With Him I don't worry about inconsequential food failures. I live life fully.  No worries, it was fantastic.  Now my crazy dinner is the greatest ever!  Lol!  I made a lasting memory, guaranteed to be added to the other holiday favorites.  Carpé Diem!

This lasagna is fantastic!  I am trying to eat better and so made a number of modifications to cut down on the cheese and fat.  I also doubled the veggies (spinach and mushrooms) as I read in a number of reviews.  I cooked the spinach in the microwave for a few minutes and then mixed it in with the mushroom mix as I also read.  In addition, I used whole wheat noodles and simply soaked them in hot water for 10 minutes before using them instead of cooking them.  Finally, I used fat free ricotta, used a mix of romano and parm in the mix (2/3 cup total) and only used about 2.5 cups of mozzarella.  Even with these fat/cheese modifications, the recipe was great.  I served it for a few friends that came over and they asked to have the recipe.  Thank you!!

This was very good.  I did add the spinach while cooking the onions/mushrooms and also soaked the noodles in hot water instead of boiling them.  The texture was still awesome.  I think I will increase the tomato sauce just a bit next time... Other than that it was great.

Very very good! It held up extremely well. I have made other spinach lasagna before but the texture has never been good enough for me. This time the texture was right one. I believe the key was to blend the ingredients with the electric beater as the recipe suggested.This lasagna was rich creamy and best of all tasty!

This was pretty good, but I felt it was missing something, a little bland in the flavour department - next time I am going to use a zippier tomato sauce.  The mushroom/spinach filling was definitely good and as others had stated - I increased the amount of both spinach and mushrooms (you can never have enough mushrooms!) I will be using the filling for mushroom caps for an appetizer at an upcoming Ladies Night - and I try the suggestion of stuffing salmon with it too!
Thanks for the versatile recipe, definitely a keeper, just needs more zing though.

This was a great recipe!  I made a couple of alterations: I used firm, Mediterranean-flavoured tofu instead of ricotta cheese (for flavour and less fat).  I used regular lasagna noodles (boiled them first).  I was anticipating it might be a little on the bland side, so I used 2 kinds of pasta sauce: roasted garlic and a spicy red pepper.  I used portabello mushrooms for a richer flavour, as well.  My husband isn't big on lasagna but he loved this recipe and is asking when I'll make it again!!!

This recipe was delicious. Better than I had anticipated, as I've never made meatless lasagna before. I'm trying to reduce the amount of meat we eat each week and this was a very promising recipe to start off with. I did make some changes. I used a jar of artichokes, instead of mushrooms. Yummy. I didn't have Romano cheese, so substituted that for Asiago. Mmmm. And I sauteed about 8 oz of spinach (about triple) with the onions and garlic, instead of boiling it. I also seasoned that with salt & pepper, and I used sea salt instead of regular table salt the cheese mixture. In all, I think these changes made the recipe my own and super delicious. I will definitely be making this again. (My way, that is!)

Have made this lasagna twice now, its very tasty and was fairly well received.  I used portabellos and my daughter who generally shields herself whenever she sees a mushroom even enjoyed it. When I want a vegetarian lasgana I'll certainly choose this one again.

Really tasty.  Use lots of spinach and mushtooms.  To keep it simpler, I sauted the spinach with the onions and mushrooms and skipped beating them with the mixer.

Great recipe!  I made for a Thanksgiving dinner and everybody took home leftovers.  Left out mushrooms and used two bunches of fresh spinach.  I'm not Italian, so instructions to rinse the noodles would have been helpful.  Also, it seems like an instruction for the top layer is missing...and I used almost twice the amount of sauce.

First time making lasagna and it was very very good. Would have gave it 5 stars but the proportions on some of the ingredients were off. For example, I have no idea how you would fit 20 lasagna noodles in a 9x13 pan. I think I used half of that. Didn't include the 1 cup of parmesan cheese but the result was still very cheesy. Even though this didn't call for meat, I did include 1lb of ground beef to the mixture. I also broiled the last 5 min or so to brown the top layer of cheese. So delicious, will make again!

I watched the video prior to making this, great tips for saving time...wilting spinach with hot water, using no boil lasagna noodles, oh and for taste and texture, adding roasted red peppers.  It was delicious....everyone loved it.  I will be making this again.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Everyone liked it, but decided the recipe needed a few changes.  Next time I will triple the spinach - 2 cups is  hardly anything when cooked down.  I will make a little more filling and sauce as well, because the layers ended up being a bit thin.  Also, I will grease the pan and sauce the bottom.  (The bottom layer stuck to the pan when I made it.)  I made fresh pasta for this and didn't cook it before using it.  It worked great.  I'll try adding in some different things next time, too, like olives and broccoli and maybe some seitan.

I was looking for a recipe to allow me to use up some fresh spinach and cheese I had and ran across this one...delish.  I added a small green pepper and 1 lb. Italian sausage to the ricotta mix.  It was really excellent!  My only caveat is that the Parmesan is not listed in the ingredients (but used in the recipe) and that 20 noodles is--I think--too many.  Only 3 fit in each layer of my 9 x 13 pan, so I only used 9.  Despite this, however, I strongly recommend...my husband loved it.

Pretty good, added ground turkey to the pasta sauce, nice addition if you don't want vegetarian.  I did put about 6 cups of spinach vs. the suggested 3 cups suggested per someones review, I would actually put a bit more in next time, it seems like a lot, but once its chopped and blended it's not!  All around good lasagna, will make again!

This was delicious but I made some personal adjustments. I added 1 cup portobello mushrooms and doubled the spinach and regular mushrooms because they all cook down so much and we love these ingredients. I only needed about half the lasagna noodles, so next time I will cut that in half. It was time consuming, so I made two, and put the extra in the freezer. Turned out delicious and I will definitely be making this again.

The whole family loves this recipe.   I will definitely use a lot more spinach the next time I make it.  I keep forgetting how much the spinach shrinks when you boil it.

no...no you can't leave out the spinach, not unless you substitute swiss chard or 2/3 kale+1/3 mustard greens well saute'd with some onions. its the greens that make a lasagne a meal and cut the richness, and thats what elevates this lasagne to one of the truly great foods. Thanks Robbie

This was very good.  I used frozen chopped spinach for ease.  I don't think the recipe calls for enough tomato sauce so I doubled it and saved some to pour over the lasagna before serving it.

I've made this a couple times now, and it always goes over well! I sauteed the spinach with the onions and mushrooms, but just added it later. After it cools, I add the ricotta and egg into the pan without using an electric mixer. I also use fresh lasagna noodles, so there's no need to boil them. Also, I find that I like this better with a rose sauce than with regular tomato sauce, so I make a simple bechamel and then add a can of pasta sauce to it. I find this matches the flavour of spinach better, but isn't as rich as an alfredo-based sauce.

Sorry to be a buzzkill since everyone else loves this recipe...but I didn't really care for it.  Way too much cheese and not nearly enough sauce or spinach.  

But to each his own!

What an awesome recipe.  I added 2 bags of spinach instead of 1 and used italian seasoning instead of the basil and oregano.  I didn't mix the cheese mixture with an electric mixer.  I just used a spoon and made sure the mixture was mixed very well.  Also 20 lasagne noodles was too much.  I was only able to layer 3 noodles on the bottom of my 9X13 glass baking dish.  I was only able to get 4 layers using only 12 lasagne noodles.  Anyways it turned out awesome!! Hubby couldn't stop eating it he loved it so much.  This recipe is definetly a keeper!

Very, very good.  I added more spinach (this from a vegetable HATER), and it needed more sauce.  I spiced it up a bit by adding red pepper flakes to the cheese/spinach mixture.  It worked well to make the dish more appealing to my Indian in-laws who are used to very spicy food.

This was very good. The only chages I made were to add more garlic(can never have enough) and I used low-fat ricotta and mozzarella cheese to reduce whatever calories I could. It came out delicous. I will make this again..it's a keeper.

I loved this spinach lasagna but made some modifications to make it easier and slightly healthier.  I used no boil lasagna without any problems.  I chopped the spinach and sauteed it with the garlic, onion and mushrooms (and therefore didn't need to use an extra pot to boil the spinach).  Instead of using an electric mixer I just mixed with a fork.  I added at least double the amount of spinach and mushrooms and cut the cheese at least in half and the lasagna still came out plenty rich and delicious.

I loved the taste of this lasagna but the amount of ingredients is flawed.  I only used 12 lasagna noodles, needed more mozzarella (OK, we're cheese freaks in our house), and way more pasta sauce.  I used small curd cottage cheese instead of ricotta as my hubby doesn't like ricotta.  The result was delicious!  It was my first time making lasagna, and it is so labor-intensive that I won't be making it again in a hurry, but this will be my go-to lasagna recipe!  Thanks!!!

I was looking for a recipes that would satisfy both vegetarian and meat eating family members.  This was a hit.  I made it just as directed with one exception - I threw baby fresh spinach on the hot mushroom mixture and it steamed beautifully. Lasagna takes a lot of work and this one is worth the effort.

Great Healthy dinner! I did not have Romano cheese and I added 1/4 cup of low fat sour cream to the ricotta mixture. I also added green peppers to the onions and mushrooms. I  forgot to put garlic in (oops).

This recipe was NOT worth all the effort of chopping the spinach, mushrooms, and onions because we could not taste the vegetables at all. I even tripled the spinach as the others recommended. I could have just made a simple lasagna recipe off the lasagna box and it would taste just the same!

Really good! I used one package baby spinach, about 4 cups and sauteed with the onion. I didn't use mushroom cause my son doesn't like them. I used about 5 cups sauce and didn't boil my noodles first. Came out great! I made this for Christmas and my meat eatting family were concenred but all I received was compliments! Thanks

This was so delicious!!  I did cut the recipe down to accommodate 8 people.  I also added A LOT more spinach and about 2 cups of broccoli, I ended up using close to 24 oz of spinach.  Other than I followed the recipe as listed, and I used all fresh herbs instead of dried.

I made spinach lasagna for the first time! This recipe is really so good, I made it for  Christmas  and everyone loved it. The only change I made was I used larger baking dish and used more spinach and tomato sauce. It will have big success  in my family for the years to come...

This is a five star recipe but I give it only four since I believe that quantities are wrong. I made this for vegetarian Christmas Eve party, though I lean toward carnivorous.  The taste of the spinach mixture is superb, but is highly subdued and muted by the noodles. The next time I make this, I will double or possibly triple the quantity of the spinach mixture ingredients.  While picking up ingredients, the red pasta sauce seemed kind of wrong to me but I tried it anyway. Was debating whether I should use an alfredo sauce instead - but we're already working with a lot of cheese. Next time I'm going alfredo, and if I don't get a blood clot I'll let you know how it came out.  I had some difficulty finding all the cheeses, especially the ricotta so I had to improvise a bit. Don't get me wrong, it's a great recipe but needs tweaking.  I think with the quantities adjusted, this is a six star dish.

My vegetarian son is coming to visit and I needed to make meatless meals.  This is to die for!  I didn't need 20 noodles, 4 per layer was adequate for my pan. I never know how to measure spinach, but love it, so I cooked the entire package and squeezed the water out before chopping. It was a little bigger than a tennis ball. I didn't cook the mushrooms as long as the garlic and onions. I used Francesco's "Hole in the Wall" Marinara Sauce.  Limiting to 26 oz. keeps this from taking over the other flavors.

I have been teaching my 8 year old stepdaughter to cook and thought lasagna would be fun.  So we pulled this recipe and made it last night.  Not only was it easy enough to make that she was able to help me with the recipe from beginning to end, but it was fabulous!!  We changed it up a little bit, and used my 24 hour homemade meaty spaghetti sauce (made in the crock pot) and left the mushrooms out (she hates them).  We also added extra ricotta and instead of romano, doubled up the parmesan.  Also, added two times the spinach, since when cooked up it shrinks so much.    It turned out beautifully!  I highly recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a fabulous italian family dinner.  My husband ate three huge pieces and I think this is the first meal in a long time my stepdaughter actually finished.  Served with some fresh garlic bread, this is the perfect rainy day dinner!

Made this for my Bunco group and everyone loved it. I put a thin layer of the pasta sauce on the bottom so the noodles didn't stick. I also mixed the ricotta, romano, spices and egg first, then stirre in the spinach and mushroom mixture so the spinach didn't get caught up in the mixer. It was great.

I made this recipe as is which I do not typically do.  I like to read through all of the reviews and then alter the recipe based on the reviews.  This recipe turned out great and my vegetarian sister-in-law just love it.  For the next time, I think I will alter a few things.  I think that I will add more spinach and more pasta sauce since it seemed alittle on the dryer side.  I did not use all 20 lasagna noodles but only used 3 noodles per layer and made 3 layers.

Great recipe.  The only problem is that a few of the measurements seemed slightly off.  I only used 5 lasagna noodles per layer because that's what fit in a 9 x 13 baking dish.  And after three layers (15 noodles) the ricotta mixture and pasta sauce were used up.  Finally, if I make this recipe again I'll add more spinach and a bit more pasta sauce.  All in all, a great lasagna.  PS - If you're not a fan of mushrooms, try zucchini.

This is a nice recipe.  I strongly reccomend:  add extra tomato sauce, and do  not boil the spinach - it cooks nicely if its just chopped and put in raw.  Also, be liberal with the spinach and the garlic.  I removed the foil for the last 8 minutes of baking, and liked the result.

This recipe ROCKS!!! I've made it twice now and even the meat-lovers love it. I had a few slight variations...
--I used no-bake lasagne noodles.
--I did not boil the spinach. Simply de-stemmed it and chopped it up.
--I put a layer of tomato sauce in bottom of pan
--Sprinkled in some red pepper flakes for some kick
--Pulled the foil off for last 10 minutes of baking to get the cheese golden brown.

Wonderful in deed... I will make this over and over again.  I used a Huge jar of Prego and it was just perfect.  Made the large Lasange pan and it was full and beautiful.  My husband really loved it.  Can't wait to share with our son when he comes home from college.  This is the best ever...

Great recipe, thank you!

My modifications:

-Used nearly 5 cups of spinach (2 seemed token) and blanched the leaves vs boiling (goal being to preserve more nutrients)
-Cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced, worked well (my guy hates mushrooms and didn't even notice them)
-part-skim ricotta worked fine; still very flavorful
-I fresh-peppered the onion/garlic/mushroom sauté
-remove the foil and turn the broiler on high for the last ten minutes if you like a crispy cheese top layer (I preserved some of the mozzarella to sprinkle on top)

A winner!

This is yummy!  I know some people don't like ratings when the recipe is changed a bit, but I actually like hearing about variations, as they can be useful.  I used whole wheat noodles, added mushrooms, and did not have romano cheese...and it still came out great!

We loved! loved! loved!! this recipe. I used the oven ready lasagna because I hate wimpy lasagna noodles. I also incorporated Italian ground turkey into my dish with the tomato sauce and it was delicious down to the last bite.

Excellent recipe, even my picky non-veggie eating 5 & 8 year old liked it. I would recommend increasing the the spinach to 6 or more cups because if you follow as written you have a very thin baked lasagna. I will definitely make this again.

This lasagna was amazing!!! I used gluten-free rice lasagna noodles, and so I didn't have to cook them. I also used more spinach, more ricotta, less mozzarella, and omitted the Romano cheese. It was incredible!!! I also started with a layer of sauce first to add moisture. What a wonderful recipe; thank you, Robbie!!! We will definitely be making this again!

This is the best spinach lasagna recipe out there. My husband keeps asking me to make it. I also add ground turkey for a good dose of protein. We eat off of it for a week (if it makes it that long!)

This is the best lasagna ever! I leave out the onion and use more parmesan instead of the romano cheese. It could use double the spinach and only needs 9 noodles, but this is the recipe that taught me to make a great lasagna.

My family loved this lasagne!  Probably one of the best I ever made!  I'm not the greatest cook, but this was a winner. Tasty ingredients blended together was the trick.  I added German thyme from my herb garden and topped it off with fresh basil.

I used this as a basic recipe because my ingredients were slightly different. I used 3 of those 6"X6" lasagna noodle "sheets" that I softened in water in the microwave. I greased an 8"X8" glass dish for building the 3 layers of noodle/sauce/cheeses. My husband had a carton of grilled vegetables from a local "Fresh and Easy" market, so I chopped grilled eggplant, green pepper and red onion and mixed in with the spinach/ricotta cheese mixture. I had to scale back on the ingredients because I had a smaller bake dish (only needed 1 cup of ricotta for example). The parmesan cheese tastes salty enough, so I backed off on the salt (didn't need to salt the water for the noodles either). Salt is so over-rated; I found that pepper and garlic powder is all I needed to spice this up. I uncovered the dish during the last 15 minutes and sprinkled one last layer of mozzarella cheese. The lasagna turned out perfect for slicing and tasted great. Will make this again!

Okay, this spinach lasagna recipe was amazing! It was so good, my husband finished it and went back for seconds! This was one of the best vegetarian lasagnas I’ve ever tried. It’s important to point out a couple of things though. There are certain things I did change from the posted recipe. First of all, I didn’t have any mushrooms so I used canned artichokes in its place which attributed even more to the deliciousness factor. The author of this recipe mentions boiling the spinach for 5 minutes which is way too long for my preference. I only wilted it (a couple of seconds) in boiling water. I also used less noodles and slightly less ricotta since I only had a 15 oz. container. I also switched up the order of layering a bit. This was good and easy to make, give it a try!

Absolutely delicious and savory!  This is truly amazing and it's my go to recipe now for lasagna.  I had to tweak to omit the onion, because we have family members who won't eat onion at all, and replaced with extra mushrooms.  I sauteed the mushrooms in olive oil until they were caramelized. I added extra spinach, just a bit more, to my liking. I'll have at least someone who's never tried it ask "where's the meat?" but after they taste it, I never hear another word and enjoy watching them go back for seconds.  I'm a meat eater myself, but will never go back after this recipe! Ironically, I've been trying to find a meat lasagna recipe for years that's close to my Aunt's and this is the closest I've found. I think the sauteed mushrooms, herbs and garlic added to a fresh spinach and ricotta filling topped with fresh grated Parmesan, Romano and mozzarella cheeses are key. Thank you so much Robbie for sharing the perfect lasagna recipe!

This was great. I 1.5x the recipe and made 2 square pans. I used a full container of ricotta, most of one frozen spinach, and I stretched 1 jar of sauce, although I could have used a bit more. I had some of the ricotta mixture leftover at the end. I used 12 no-boil lasagna noodles.

Very good with a few changes.  As another contributor has already mentioned, it does need a lot more spinach!  More mushrooms would be beneficial too.   I layered the veggies on top of the cheese layer instead of mixing it all together.

I baked for one hour covered and an additional 15-20 minutes uncovered so the top would be golden and bubbly.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out to be delicious! My husband, who loves meat, was even impressed with this vegetarian dish. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

We loved this !!  I used a jar of pizza sauce for the "pasta sauce."  I used a whole onion, a whole large bag of frozen spinach (thawed in microwave), a whole can of chopped mushrooms.  This was delicious, and could easilyl be modified to taste.  We will definitely make this again when hankering for a filling, delicious vegetarian meal.

I made this last weekend and it was great!  I used the lasagna noodles that you don't have to boil first--made it so much easier to deal with.  I also added some yellow squash and zucchini.  Was a bit hit!

Very good-- this is my favorite lasagna recipe so far. I omitted the mushrooms since I don't like them, and I added a pound of browned ground beef and diced red bell pepper to my tomato sauce.  I used oven-ready lasagna noodles and wilted the spinach under hot water to save a couple of steps, and since I had some on hand, I added about three tablespoons of white basil pesto sauce to the spinach/cheese/egg mixture.  I still feel like there's some kind of spice missing, or maybe I needed more tomato sauce, though I used a big 26 oz jar.  It's very good anyway and so filling (especially if you add meat like I did)... my husband and I ate half the pan and will have the other half later in the week.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this! My husband is gluten intolerant, but no problem, I used brown rice lasagna noodles.I read all of the reviews and tips then went with the one where she sauteed the spinach, onions & mushrooms together, worked out great! Also used 2 different jars of pasta sauce, rustico veggetable & a spicy basil tomato. thank you for this awesome recipe. Will be making it many more times!

I have been searching for a great meatless lasagna and have finally found it!! The things I did a little differently was I used prego sauce with mushrooms because I am not a huge fan of mushrooms, but wanted a few in there. I also added Zuccini, red peppers, and  broccoli to the onion, garlic, spinach saute. I also did not use an electric mixer. I mixed all the cheeses together and reduced the Parmesan down to 1 cup. I layered noodles, cheese mixture, saute mixture and sauce and repeated it. Everyone at the party was skeptical at first but I had only 1 slice : ( left for my weekday lunch.

This was a really great Lasagna that even my "meat and potatoes" husband and picky kids loved.  I left off the Romano cheese and just added some more Parm and it came out wonderfully.

Delicious lasagna! I left the mushrooms out b/c I didn't have any on hand and used fresh basil rather than dried, but other than that I stuck to the recipe.  Using no-boil noodles cuts down on prep-time (and it's one less pot to clean).  Thanks for the recipe :)

Wonderful. Left out mushrooms and romano (used grated parmesan), and only 12 lasagna noodles. Also used frozen chopped spinach. Thanks for the recipe, great Sunday meal.

This is a fantastic basic lasagna recipe that can be modified to suit any taste; the next time I make it I'm going to try a seafood filling and a white sauce. The first time I made it I didn't have Romano on hand, so I just substituted Parmesan; I doubled the garlic, added a half teaspoon of nutmeg, and used a mixture of Monterey Jack and mozzarella. I also doubled the amount of spinach and used half boiled spinach and half fresh in my spinach-ricotta mixture; I omitted mushrooms since my room mate is allergic. As another reviewer suggested I removed the foil fifteen minutes before removing the lasagna from the oven to allow the top layer to brown, which really adds a lot to the taste and texture of the dish.

This recipe was very good!  I gave it only 4 stars because I have had better spinach lasagna and this just wasn't quite it, but it has potential.  I used frozen spinach and added fresh basil, but I don't think I got the spice combination quite right...

Delicious! In the future, I would use more spinach (it cooks down a lot). I also used just Parmesan in place of the Romano and extra (fresh) garlic. It came out great! Like someone else suggested, I removed the foil for the last 5 mins to brown the cheese a little.

Loved this recipe. Took it to work for a potluck and everyone loved it! I used fresh baby spinach, added 2 extra cups, boiled it and layered it separately instead of mixing it. Also added an extra cup of fresh mushrooms...GREAT STUFF!

This is the BEST lasagna recipe I have ever used. I have modified it a little to suit my  family's taste- I use 1/2 cup more ricotta, more garlic, and 6 cups of spinach instead of two, a pound of ground meat and an extra cup of sauce (which is only needed because of the added meat) DELICIOUS. I made 6 of these lasagnas for my wedding and received many compliments, I thought people were just being nice, but even still, people comment on how awesome this lasagna was and I have given out the recipe (adjusted as noted above according to my taste) more times than I can count.    Like all lasagna, it tastes even better the second day and freezes well. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I made for a family birthday party and it went over very well.  I made a few minor changes - used frozen spinach, which was fine.  Doubled the mozzarella because I like more cheese.  Also, I put a layer of noodles and sauce on top and put cheese on for the last 15 minutes of baking.  Note - if you make ahead and refrigerate, it needs to bake for about 90 minutes to heat through.

I make this about once a month.  My boyfriend and I have it for dinner and then freeze the rest for a lazy night later on.  I lightly cook the noodles, just enough to make them plyable before I layer the lasagna.  The first time I cooked this I cooked them all the way and they fell apart when it came time to stack the layers.

This was a very good lasagna, however the next time I will NOT add any salt at all because it seems to just get stronger as it cooks and doesn't need it.  I bought a parmesan/romano mix on the shelf instead of doing them separate due to cost.  I also halved cottage cheese and ricotta instead of all ricotta and added shredded carrots.  Despite the salt issue it was good and I'd make it again w/o salt.  Thanks

This is just Great! I am a beginner in cooking and this was pretty simple for even myself. The taste was most enjoyable. Love the spinach, cheesy taste!
(Update-I am not a big fan of Romano cheese so just substituted it with more mozzarella cheese/Parmesan for the mix)

Pretty good lasagna and easy to make. Really important to drain any liquid that expels out of the spinach before adding it to the lasagna.

This is a great recipe.  I made it for a group a friends and everyone loved it.  I added about 2x more spinach then the recipe said.  Also I did not boil the noodles first and they turned out fine.

This was my first time making any kind of lasagna dish and it was absolutely amazing!!!! I'm a college student so if I can make this, I think anyone can. Also, I used all fresh ingredients, which took a little longer to prepare, but it was well worth it!

This recipe was just okay for the amount of time spent putting it all together.  It was very dry.  I doubled the amount of spinach added, but felt it could have even used more.  I would also use more cheese and sauce.  I will probably try again, but will manipulate the recipe a bit.

This was delicious. This is my favorite lasagna recipe.. I always double the spinach amount (and I don't boil it). I use cottage cheese instead of ricotta, added a few red pepper flakes to the EXTRA garlic, and whole wheat lasagna noodles. I also add about 1 cup less of Mozzerella cheese to reduce the calories. I usually use fresh Basil and Oregano too.  THANK YOU ROBBIE!

This was my first try at spinach lasagna and it was really great. However I didn;t boil the spinach I wanted it to be fresh and full of the good stuff. Otherwise easy and yummy recipe.

This is a very good dish! I added about 8-10 cups of spinach, 24oz of mushrooms, and 2 jars of roasted red peppers. I also used a few more cups of sauce. It made a substantial amount and tasted great! I paired this with some homemade garlic bread!

I liked this dish, and will certainly make it again and again.  I changed the serving size down to 8, still...the quantity suggested of lasagna noodles was way too high for my 9x13 pan. Threw away about 6 large cooked noodles that had nowhere to go.  

And I'm so glad I bought 2 huge bunches of fresh spinach since that amount was dialed in with just the right amount of spinach flavor and texture.  When in doubt, use more spinach here than the recipe calls for.   Best tip is to use a high quality, but not overpowering fresh red sauce, something in the $6-7 range.  I will modify this next time by adding a browned spicy chorizo for a surprise kick, since my added red pepper to the assembly was too subtle for our taste.  Best melded flavors came out the next day with gently reheated left overs.

Tried this for a dinner party- it was really good! I used probably 4-5x more spinach, as others have said. I also sauteed the onions and mushrooms, and then added spinach to the same pan and just steamed it a bit. I have no idea why you would use an extra pan for this step. I used extra mushrooms, extra basil, and added a few cloves of garlic. I probably used extra tomato sauce (didn't measure), and definitely did not use 20 lasagna noodles. People loved it! Thi s recipe is a great starting point- it just needs a little alteration. I will definitely make this again.

This was definitely a five-star recipe when it came out of my kitchen, but I did change a few things. I have been working on making the perfect lasagna for years, but wasn't too sure about the vegetarian variety so decided to use a recipe. I sauteed the garlic, mushrooms and garlic, but also added a yellow pepper to the mix because I had one on hand. I also seasoned this mixture with some dried herbs, fennel etc. Instead of boiling the spinach or even adding it to this sauteed mixture, I have learned from using it in every lasagna that I make that you absolutely do not have to do anything to fresh spinach... So, I left it out of the pan and instead added a jar and a half of spaghetti sauce and a can of tomato paste to the sauteed vegetables. Once it was simmering I added fresh basil, oregano, sage and dill from the garden. I let this sauce simmer while I prepared the cheese mixture. They didn't have Romano at the store I went to, so I went for Parmiaggiano Regiano or something like that (a hard bar of parm). I grated this into the mixture and added a bit of mozza to it too. Started the layers with noodles, cheese, a layer of fresh spinach and then the tomato/veggie sauce. Repeated two more times. Topped with mozza and parm. Turned out very delicious!! I would give it 5 but I didn't use the method (way less pots) and I used lots of fresh herbs and way more spinach. Definitely a keeper with my changes!

Followed recipe exact with the exception of the mushrooms. It was fine but to be honest it totally tasted like a frozen meal.....I could have sworn it tasted like a Lean Cuisine frozen lunch. I'm surprised at all the rave reviews.    I won't be making this one again.

Very good lasagna. It takes several pans; cook spinach, lasagna noodles and mushroom/onion mix. I should have read the prep and bake time because it took a long time to make.  Good meatless dish!

Made this the other day and liked it. Don't use twenty noodle, 9 is good for one 9x13 pan. Made other changes too. Cut back on the ricotta cheese and added some cottage cheese along with fresh parsley. Didn't add the egg and it was fine. Also add your own seasonings such as garlic powder and Italian seasoning along with anything else you think would be good. And you don't need to cook the spinach and should add lots more than 2 cups. And you might need to add more sauce too. :)

I cut the recipe in half but only used 7 sheets of lasagna. I also did not use Romano cheese and used about 1/2 cup of spinach and 1/2 cup of zucchini. And it was delicious.

Simple and straightforward.  I flipped the layering at the end to make sure the cheese was on top.  I liked that it wasn't too saucy.  This would be even better with the addition of some hot italian sausage.

This was fantastic. I agree with the other comments that you definitely need to add more spinach to make it "spinach lasagna." I also added an extra cup of mushrooms. It came out great!

Love your recipe! I cannot eat tomatoes so I substituted the tomato sauce with a jar of Alfredo sauce. That made it soooo creamy and cheesy! Thank you for the recipe!

Excelent. I added a lot more spinach and have used different kinds of cheese (whatever I had on hand). I also added more onion and used the noodles that you do not precook (all that I can find in my local stores).

This recipe was fabulous.  I added an additional cup of spinach, and on second try, some more mushrooms and sauteed ground beef. Both times, it was a hit. My husband (happily) at leftovers for days.

I love this recipe! Every once in a while I'll get in the mood for an extra little kick, and since I'm no longer a vegetarian, I add a thin layer of cooked sausage right in the middle. Its fantastic! I probably add more cheese too, since I don't measure it. I love the flavor of Romano and ricotta cheeses, but sometimes plain romano is hard to find where I live, so I just use romano and parm mix. I have also used fresh herbs before, I just use more of them.

Good, but nothing exciting. It needs a bit more of something...maybe more tomato sauce and more spinach.

Thanks so much Robbie for sharing this wonderful recipe!  This was my first solo attempt (cooking with Mom not included) at making spinach lasagna and I must say that it was quite wonderful.  I did make a few slight adjustments to make it a little more heart healthy and suitable for my taste, but pretty much followed everything else as noted in the recipe.  I used part skim ricotta, frozen leaf spinach (didn't have any fresh on hand), omitted the mushrooms but added some delicious chopped red bell peppers and used egg whites instead of the whole egg.  I considered using low-fat cheese throughout, but decided to reward my taste buds!!  The results were fantastic and I will definitely make this recipe once again!!  Happy, Healthy Eating ;0)

Tried it for the first time today, and we all enjoyed it, my hubby, me and my son. Considering that they are both very picky, this is quite an accomplishment. I skipped the mushrooms and onions, but added more garlic (hubby doesn't like onions and son doesn't like mushrooms, like I said, picky, picky, picky!!!). I quickly sauteed the spinach after I boiled it, with the olive oil and garlic before adding to the cheese mixture. This is a keeper!

This is one darn good lasagna recipe.  Nevertheless, I trusted my gut on this one and followed another person’s review (no need to repeat it here, just find Mary Domaz’s review).  The minor variations are excellent.  But a few notes from me anyway: I used a 9oz bag of spinach, and 8oz. of chopped portabellos. I was also pretty generous with the sauce and the mozzarella (my preference). I ended up using approximately 1 and 3/4 jars of sauce, and probably 4 full cups of mozzarella. Also, when I layered the noodles, I was able to perfectly fit four noodles horizontally and one noodle vertically in my pan. All in all, I ended up using 15 noodles altogether. I baked it an hour, covered (aluminum foil), then removed the foil and left it in the oven an additional 10-15min. The pan was was really loaded down and heavy! But ultimately delicious (the lasagna, not the pan). Fed 8 of us.

I used the NO BOIL lasagna noodles. Don't know if that dried out my pasta or what, but I would maybe use more sauce next time. I made an extra to take for a friend. He raved, but he always does :).

This was my first go at lasagna and it was the best I have ever tasted! Granted, I unfortunately have not have lasagna that often because I do not mix meat and dairy together. I watched the video on AR of this recipe and it really helped me. It cut beautifully after letting it rest for 15 min and provided us leftovers for the whole week (and we had guests). This will become a staple in our home. Thank you!

Made this with out the spinach since I did not have fresh spinach on hand. My husband loves ricotta in his lasagna and I am not a fan. This lasagna was the first I have liked with Ricotta. The only extra I added was Johnny's Garlic Spread & Seasoning (seasoning bought at Costco good for many recipes) to the Ricotta mixture. And I used about half of what was called for in Ricotta since I did not have 3 cups on hand.

This is an awesome recipe!  It was big hit at my house.  I did a couple things to make it easier...I used no boil noodles and cooked the spinach in the microwave (in the bag that it comes in-fresh produce section).  I used other suggestions and added artichoke hearts, but I left the mushrooms in as well.  I was very generous with the sauce as well.  I uncovered the dish the last 10 minutes of cooking.

I did everything as stated in the recipe, except I used one package frozen spinach - turn out GREAT!  Make sure you really get the juices out of the cooked spinach.  I also used reduced fat cheese - couldn't tell!  And yes, as others have stated... you always want to cover your lasagne with aluminum foil... and remove the foil for the last 15 minutes to brown the top.

I WILL be making this over and over!  Thanks!

Everyone loved this lasagna - even my meat-eater of a husband! I'm only giving it 4 stars though because it needed the slight modifications suggested by others. I added nutmeg to the spinach mix and I used fresh herbs and fresh, steamed spinach. I also used a "Garden Vegetable" pasta sauce to make it even more flavorful. It was great.

Very, very good.  Not nearly enough spinach after cooking.  Just use frozen unless you're just that fancy, in which case start with about 8 cups fresh.  I deveined the spinach, a trick I learned from a fancy chef in a great italian restaurant years ago.

The flavors were average and the lasagna dry.  The recipe calls for 20 noodles, but you only use 15 in three layers.  My husband gave it a thumbs down.  If I try it again, I'll use more sauce and and more mushrooms, garlic and herbs.

This was my first lasagna.  I wanted something I could make ahead for a large group.  It was a big hit!  I actually played around with cheeses, i used the suggested, but also some fontina i had on hand.  Definitely will make more filling than was called for, i would have liked another layer. Overall, really good recipe

There is a video tutorial of this recipe on this site - check it out for tips on making this dish. I spent at least an hour for preparation - chopping veggies and grating 3 different cheeses takes tons of time! Unfortunately the finished product was too dry and tasted just so-so. On hindsight, I should have watered down the tomato sauce or added more sauce when layering. It's essential to cover with tinfoil while cooking to prevent it drying out. I added roasted red peppers when layering (as the video tutorial suggested). Good thing, as the ricotta filling was somewhat bland for my tastebuds. I doubled the spinach & mushrooms as well. Despite having so much cheese in this recipe, it didn't really have the rich cheesy taste I was after. I can't say this was a total disaster, but given all the hard work involved the payoff wasn't there. I wouldn't make this again.

This recipe was easier than I thought.  I used portobello mushrooms for that smokey flavor (since my dad hates eating anything without meat).  I also added zuchinni & red peppers to the mushroom & spinach mixture.  I grilled it all together (adding the spinach last).  It came out great.

This is actually a lasagna where I did not have to add more ricotta!  I love a CHEESEY lasagna, and I do love to add spinach to most of my italian dishes with ricotta, so this recipe was a great find for me.  The flavors blended well and it held together perfectly.  Nothing like slicing a lasagna and all the layers slop apart.  Make sure to get that excess water out of the spinach though!  If you do, your should hold up beautifully too!

I loved this and so did my husband (he told me it was the best lasagna he ever had)!! The first time I made it I didn't change a thing and it was great but the last time I made it I added some carrots, bell peppers, and zuccini and it was a very healthy and flavorful way to use up some veggies I had lying around.

This is awesome.  I halved the recipe and made it in a small casserole dish.  I used DOUBLE the spinach and I would use TRIPLE next time.  I think this would change it from "Lasagna with Spinach" to "SPINACH Lasagna".  I added a carrot to the mushrooms for good measure, and used about double the garlic.  Yum Yum Yum, tastes every bit as good as any meat lasagna.  I used about 3/4 of a large jar of sauce and it came out perfect - not runny and not dry!  :-)

This is a great, versatile recipe!  I usually stick to recipe instructions exactly, but this one I modified quite a bit based on what I had on hand.  I used fresh basil, more than a bag of spinach (which I cooked and layered seperately from the ricotta mix), 1 grated carrot in the ricotta mix, 32 oz. of ricotta and two whole jars of sausage spaghetti sauce, extra black pepper, but no romano cheese.  I used the last five lasagna noodles on top of the lasagna, which was a mistake - they got a little too dried out and made the lasagna hard to cut.  Nonetheless, it is the best lasagna I have ever made!  Thanks Robbie!

Excellent!  Should have read other reviews first, definitely needed more spinach.  I personally always spread my ricotta too thick, so I need more filling to do enough layers.  I used noodles that do not require boiling first and will never be boiling another noodle again!  Turned out great, and definitely a keeper recipe.

This was delicious! I made it for my family and they raved about it all night! I didn't have any basil leaves so I omited it and it tasted fine. I also adjusted  the ingrediants. I used 6 cups mozerella, 6 cups tomato sauce, 12 cups fresh spinach, and 1 1/2 cups romano. I also did not drain the mushroom, onion, garlic liquid, but instead let the mushrooms soak it up. It tasted great and wasn't difficult to make! Oh and it wasn't the slightest dry.

This is GREAT! I don't even LIKE lasagna and I loved this.My husband had thirds! I made a few changes...doubled the amount of spinach,used 1 lb of mushrooms,1/2 a head of garlic,added 1 sliced bellpepper.I didn't precook the noodles and they came out perfect! Make sure you drain,drain,drain your vegetables after cooking. By adding the xtra amount I did and NOT draining off fluids, the lasagna was a little too moist,or (which I will do next time) leave off the top layer of cheese until the last 15 minutes to allow the moisture to evaporate in the oven while cooking.

This is a wonderful recipe. I used only 12 noodles, doubled the vegetables, and mixed the sautéed onions and mushrooms into the sauce (in place of where many might put ground beef in other recipes).   The result was  a gorgeous, delicious lasagna.  Thanks for the post!

Wow!!!!!!!!!! I haven't made a ton of lasagna in my days but I sure have eaten them. This recipe is impressive. The amounts are spot on except you will want one more layer of everything but ricotta for the top and a small amount of sauce on the bottom. I have always had excess filling with past recipes but not with this recipe which is a huge relief to not waste anything. I used a no boil lasagna noodle and sauted my spinach in the pan I used for onions and mushrooms with a little chicken stock. Then I squeezed a ton of liquid out of the spinach to ensure it didnt water anything down. Used a homemade tomato sauce. This is the best lasagna I have ever made and one of the top five I have eaten. I usually shy away from meatless dinners but the mushrooms I cut thick definitely kept me from noticing a lack of meat. My wife enjoyed this as much as I did. Wow wow wow! Wow!!!

I loved this recipe.  Like other comments, do use twice the spinach.  I pretty much followed the instructions and my family loved it.  The vegetarians were happy and it was hardy enough for the carnivores.

I don't like reviews where the person made significant changes, but then sometimes I get great ideas from them, so here's mine: This is a delicious and (best of all) forgiving recipe. I cheated and used a 10 oz box of frozen chopped spinach (cooked and squeezed dry) instead of fresh, and 1 cup of pre-chopped "Creole seasoning mix" (onions, bell peppers, parsley, celery and garlic) instead of chopping a fresh onion. That saved a little bit of time and effort. I also used about an extra cup of pasta sauce to make it moister per my preference. Note: the recipe calls for 20 lasagna noodles but only uses 15, so don't panic if you're a few short. I also eyeballed the layer of 5 noodles vs a 9"x13"x2" pan and opted for a slightly larger pan that just fit all 5 noodles with no overlapping. That worked out perfectly--no spillovers. End result: Lasagna craving satisfied. Thanks, Robbie Rice!

First time making lasagne - it turned out amazing!  I did read other reviews and used 3 cans of tuna,  added a little turmeric and cumin while cooking quinoa, and used 4 cups broth.  

The worst part was layering the slippery noodles (I may experiment with no-cook noodles next time) and spreading the cheese/sauce layers.  At that point  I warned my family they may never see this again because it was hard for me to put together, but after tasting it, it was definitely worth it!  

Mine also looked a little different - couldn't find my hand mixer so I used my power wand, which immediately blended the spinach/cheese into a lovely mint green concoction, lol!  But it was delicious, so who cares?

I have been using this recipe for a few of years. Everybody can't get enough. People are always begging for the recipe. I WILL NEVER TRY A DIFFERENT LASAGNA RECIPE. I have had ZERO complaints. 

As per my personal taste I make the following adjustments: I add another cup or so of spinach, double the garlic, and replace romano with more parmasian. I'm going to try adding roasted red peppers and broccoli this year.

Family loved it - changed a few things. Used 1 1/2# fresh spinach (more like 6 cups). I rough chopped it and dry wilted it in the same cast iron pan as the one used to saute the onion and garlic. I omitted the mushrooms and added a head of cauliflower. Par boil the cauliflower then browned it in olive oil until slightly crispy and rough chopped it into 1/2" pieces.  I added the cauliflower into the last layer. My family thought there was meat in the dish! I used oven ready lasagna sheets. Will make this again!

I made a recipe very similar to this, and it turned out great. I use italian blend shredded cheese to make it even easier. It is a blend of mozzarella, Parmesan, and Romano. It's a shredded and blended together, I love using it for italian dishes. They have store brand and kraft. Additionally, for sauce I only use Francesco Rinaldi pasta sauce. It is actually thick, never bitter (actually a little sweet) and lots of flavor. The price is actually lower than the other sauces most of the time which makes it even better. Good stuff!!

I really liked this recipe but I did make a few adjustments. I don't like when ricotta is overpowering in lasagna so I only used two cups. I'm obsessed with garlic so I doubled the amount. For my filling I simply mixed the ricotta, spices, egg, garlic, olive oil, Romano cheese and scallions (I don't like onions). I layered fresh mushrooms and spinach instead of boiling or sautéing them.  Also, I added chicken to make the dish even more filling, which I cooked before layering. 

I absolutely loved it! Thanks for the recipe.

We just started going meatless during the week (trying it out - to do our part to try to save animals lives + for our health!) and WOW!!...this IS the absolute BEST meatless lasagna EVER!!  I made this last night for our anniversary dinner.  Even tho we were both stuffed after a few pieces we couldn't stop eating it and then went back for more a few hours later!  Even my daughter who can't stand meatless pasta raved about it and wanted seconds.  I did make some minor changes based on some of the reviews I read.  I bought a 10oz tub of baby spinach.  Rinsed it, chopped half of it & sautéed it with the onions, mushrooms, garlic & olive oil (the aroma is incredible).  I added an additional 1/2 TBSP of garlic 'cuz we like a lot of garlic.  I bought 2 different jars of sauce (Barilla Mushroom and Barilla Roasted Garlic & mixed them - we like a lot of sauce too).  I did 4 layers and in between 2 of them added a layer of fresh spinach (not chopped). I layered it like this:  sprayed bottom and sides of dish with cooking spray, spread a little sauce on bottom, then added a layer of 5 noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, spinach, shredded moz & shredded parm cheeses, repeat. Darn it, I wish I took a picture...next time. Next time I may do 3 or maybe all 4 layers with the spinach too (rather than just 2 of them).  Mmmmmmmmmmm!  Can't wait to eat leftovers today!!  :o]

I was looking for a new recipe, and decided to try this one out. I made some alterations, as many other people who reviewed, and it turned out great! I used a full bag of baby spinach, omitted the mushrooms as my family would have picked them out, and used 1 2/3 cup Parmesan/Romano mixed grated cheese instead of separating them. I also used 4 cups of mozzarella, because who wouldn't want extra cheese? My picky toddler ate some of it (more than his turkey sandwich at lunch), and my husband, who is a meat and limited veggie eater, ate a plateful and said it was good. I would recommend this to someone looking for a lasagna/meatless lasagna. Would make again.

I have made this twice now. The first time exactly as written (FANTASTIC) the second time I did not have the ricotta cheese, so I used cottage cheese as well as feta cheese in the blend, I also used a bacon flavored pasta sauce for a bit of a twist.. ALSO fantastic....LOVE this recipe.. I will make BOTH these variation time and time again to come. HINT: I also used TRIPPLE the amount of spinach the second time around.... LOVE this recipe. Thank you for sharing.

With a few adjustments, this lasagna turned out to be delicious!I added a whole eggplant and 3 small zucchini, which I diced and then sauteed with the mushrooms, onions and garlic. I also added a whole tub of spinach, which I sauteed for a few minutes in olive oil rather than boiled. I used whole wheat noodles and cooked them until soft rather than al dente. Yummy, and very filling!

This was delicious!  However the spinach couldn't possibly look like the picture since they have you chop it and then supposed to blend it with the cheese mixture ( I didn't do this step, just mixed it well. I would next time probably add additional spinach, and only slightly chop it & fold into the fully mixed cheese mixture.  Tasted great & my husband loved it, always a plus!

Made this recipe today for my vegetarian daughters birthday dinner.  She loved it and so did all of our guests!  Many asked for the recipe.   I used frozen spinach and had only 2 cups ricotta so I used 1 cup cottage cheese.  This will be made often in our house!

I omitted mushrooms cause the family doesn't like them but followed the recipe other than that. Thumbs up from on the family on this one. I personally thought it was missing some flavor. I might change and add more spices next time.

This was my first ever homemade meatless lasagna, and after a few tweaks I found it quite tastey. I used spaghetti sauce(Pregos chunky garden) instead of tomato paste adding it to each layer.

This is a good recipe but 20 lasagna noodles is way too much for a 9 x 13 pan. 9 lasagna noodles is enough.

Great recipe.  It got rave reviews.  I did saute the fresh baby spinach after the vegetables & used more than suggested, a lot more, since I had a big package of it.  I ended up using 15 lasagna noodles instead of 20.  I also used an artichoke pasta sauce which was a lovely touch.  I will definitely make it again.

This is the best lasagna I have ever had.  When I used to make a meat lasagna I used alfredo in it but this tops all lasagna.  I did have to make less noodles than what was required added some mushrooms and used a lot more spinach but hey it was delicious.

Such a good recipe! My roommate, who despises (or at least does not really enjoy) things without meat in them ate more of it than I did.  Some variations I included were that I didn't have the Romano cheese so I used extra mozzarella in the mozzarella/ parmesan layers.  Also, I only had 2 cups of ricotta cheese, and so I followed the suggestion of someone else on here, and didn't cook my noodles all the way (just before al dente really) and added some water to the cheese/ spinach mixture.  This made it come out just right.  Also, I tried putting red pepper flakes into the mixture (just about 2 tsp) and it was ok, they sort of got lost in the overall mixture.  But on a whole this was a huge hit with both my roommate/ friends/ family that I HAD to share!

I'm giving this 3 starts because althought the taste is great, the amount of work and ingredients that go into this lasagna are not really worth in. The furture, I'm going to use a simpler recipe that comes out just as good.

this was amazing, I would add a LOT more spinach than recommended and also add chopped artichokes to the mix,  Next time I will also add some carrots and brocolli to have more veggies and color to it.  I did use garlic alfredo sauce in place of tomatoe and it was delicious, my son kept raving about it, we are having leftovers of it tonight

I have to say this is the best Lasagna I have ever made.  It was delicious!  My picky kids who do not like spinach even liked it!  I replaced the ricotta cheese with cottage cheese because that is what I had on hand, no regrets!  I will make it again and freeze some of it for a day where I don´t have time to cook :)

Needs a bit more sauce which I added.  I had the misfortune of having grasshoppers decimate my fresh spinach patch in the last 72 hours!  I threw sliced fresh zucchini in as a substitute and the family loved it.

Great recipe! I made it for my vegetarian niece and myself for Easter. I made lamb for the other 9 people. Well, there wasn't enough lasagna to go around. They all wanted more even though they already finished their lamb meals. The only changes I made were I added the spaghetti sauce to the cooked mushrooms instead of putting the sauce in on its own. Oh yeah, and for a little kick, I added cayenne pepper to the sauce. It was zingy and tasty! Didn't have to add much.

Very good!  Used Barilla dry lasagna.  Added a little fresh parsley to the ricotta as well as a sqeeze of garlic paste.  Made it in an 8x8.  Very good!

I loved this recipe!  I made it a little bit healthier by using less cheese, and whole wheat pasta.  I also threw in a few of my other favorite herbs such as dried parsley and garlic.

I love, love, love veggie lasagna and this one is always a sure hit.  The only thing I do a little differently is I use a garden vegetable spaghetti sauce.  Otherwise - THE best lasagna ever.  Even for 'meat' eaters!

Fantastic vegetarian recipe!  I used the 'no-boil' lasagna noodles to make it easier, and left out the spinach.  One thing I found when leaving out the spinach is you must increase the ricotta cheese to 4 cups instead of 3 because the filling won't stretch as far.   I also used Don Pepino's brand pizza sauce instead of plain pasta sauce and it added a whole dimension to the flavor.  Fantastic

The most delicious vegetarian lasagna I've tasted! Good vegetarian dishes are hard to come by and this the time and the effort to  make this. The only tweaking I did is add more spinash and more tomato sauce!

Wow - this is so delicious. A bit of extra work, but worth it. I used 10 oz. frozen spinach and added it to the frying pan after sauteing the onion mixture. I also took off the cover for the last ten minute of baking for a crispy finish.

This was a great recipe and my husband loved it (so did I).  I did make some changes though.  I definately needed to add more sauce ... I ended up almost doubling it.  I also used 1 package of frozen spinach instead of the fresh spinach.  I used low-fat ricotta and 2% mozzarella cheese and everything still turned out great.  Also I didn't put 5 noodles on a layer ... I put 4.

Not often I rate some 5 but this is worth it.    Requires more ingredients and time than some recipes but the results show.  It is not something I make when in a hurry.  I always substitute fresh lasagne noodles from the dairy case which do not require boiling.   Thanks for a great recipe.

My fiance and I thought this was absolutely delicious!  Not only was the final product great, but it was a very easy recipe to follow (I didn't have to change a thing!).   I was kind of nervous bc my SO loves meat, and this was a vegetarian lasagna, but he went back for more 3 times!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Mouth watering!!!  I followed the recipe nearly exact and it was great.  Simple, yet balanced.  I was worried about the onion; however, it wasn't overpowering and the texture was perfect.  I've been prowling this site for years and opened an account so I could rate this recipe.  Cheers!

This spinach is so good, and if made well, you won't even miss the meat. I've made it quite a few times, and can say that the occasions I've skimped on the sauce the lasagna hasn't come out as well - more dry. I usually make it in two smaller pans so I can freeze one, and the second usually doesn't get as much sauce as the first. Use plenty of sauce (1 jar may not be enough), lots of the cheese/mushroom filling and the lasagna should come out great. It also freezes well. Just defrost and cook. Preparation can take quite a while, but you can buy chopped mushrooms, spinach in a bag, and shredded cheese to really cut down the time.

This was actually the first recipe I have tried to make since I moved out of my parents house so I was definently concerned about the turnout. But after I made it I saw there was absolutley no need because this was so easy and delicious. As a college student I also appreciated that it was so affordable to make. There were a few things I will change next time like add another 2 cups of spinach and some more mushrooms but overall this was a cheap, simple and delicious recipe that everyone needs to have on hand.

Made this recipe on the fly- substituted 2 mixed bags of "italian" cheeses for romano and moz. Tasted great and easy to make- i love the color of the cheese and spinach mix, threw off the family.

Awesome recipe!  I used oven-ready noodles and piled on the mushrooms and spinach.  A friend offered to make homemade pasta sauce.  I served it for Christmas Dinner and it was a hit!  Can't wait for 2nd's!

absolutely delicious! I added 1/2 teaspoon extra of the spices (except the salt and pepper) and since I don't like mushrooms nor onions I used one cup chopped zuchini and one cup chopped green pepper instead. Will make again!!

Very good lasagna.  Was requested for a birthday dinner by my boyfriend and he definitely enjoyed it.  I too noticed that only about 3 noodles fit in each layer, sometimes 4.

We made this for a family gathering last week, and everyone loved it.  We only made a few changes:
 - used Barilla no bake noodles in a silver foil pan (smaller than 9 x 13)
NOTE: No bake noodles needs extra sauce to cook, and smaller pan means used only 4 noodles across (1/3 extra jar of sauce to go with the 28 oz jar)
- added a layer of thinly sliced zucchini btw cheese and sauce (next time, will try sauteing it with the mushrooms)
 - used part skim ricotta cheese
 - used parmesan instead of romano

As others have stated, it turns out really well.

Delicious...but not simple.  I decided not to boil the spinach, and it made for a nice bit of texture--I also went overboard with it.  More spinach, bigger muscles!  I also added more mushrooms than were called for, and it turned out chunky and delicious.

This was good but it needed A LOT more spinach. I would triple the amount needed. I would also add more sauce. The overall taste was really good but I wanted more of the spinach flavor.

I made this recipe by using individual lasagma noodles and placing the filling on each noodle, rolled up the noodles and cooked as directed....easier to serve!
I also cooked the spinach along with the mushrooms and garlic for easier prep.

Liked this much but thought it was a bit dry.  Will add more spinach, more mushrooms & more sauce next time.

This was GGGGRRREEEAAATTT!!!  We added some cooked pork sausage to the recipe which really kicked it up a bunch.  Used the ready to bake lasagna noodles and will not use them next time.  Came out too starchy.  This will for sure be a regular in our house.  It's even great cold for breakfast.

My teenage daughters loved this. My 13 year old even had seconds! As others mentioned, 20 noodles is too many. I took a few cues from my favourite non-vegetarian lasagne and came up with the following modifications: 9 noodles, 2 cups of ricotta, scant 3/4 tsp each dried basil and oregano, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 cups chopped baby spinach, uncooked and mixed directly into ricotta, no Romano cheese, about half the Parmesan cheese if using ground style. Bake for 30 minutes covered, then 10 uncovered. Should be bubbly along edges when cooked.

One of the things I love about this dish is that 1) it tastes a little BETTER then 2nd day, 2)  it's quite filling even though there's no meat in this, and 3) my older son actually enjoyed it KNOWING it was meatless.

AMAZING! My husband found the recipe and asked me to make it. I was skeptical, but did it anyway. It was the best lasagna I've ever had!! We'll definitely be making this again.

To make the prep time easier, I used ready-to-use noodles (adding 1/3 cup water to the cheese mixture), and sauteed the onions, garlic, mushrooms, and spinach together. I added MUCH more garlic  than the recipe called for because we love garlic in our house. I used more spinach too, chopping it up straight out of the bag before sauteeing it.

Good recipe. I followed it exactly except for cooking the spinach. I used a package of frozen chopped spinach, next time I will use 2. I sautéed onion and garlic, then the thawed and drained spinach. Everything else I followed. Like another reviewer said the step of mixing the cheeses with the spinach was brilliant. Oh and way to many lasagna noodles, used 12, was just right.

I used a lot more spinach and two cups of mushrooms. I sautéed the spinach with the onions and mushrooms as others have recommended. I used an extra cup of sauce too. It turned out wonderfully. A hit at Christmas!

Took out the mushrooms and added a lot more fresh spinach. I steamed the spinach instead of boiling it to avoid adding too much extra water. My guest absolutely loved it.

I absolutely love this recipe and have made it now 4 times.   I have made some changes to it.   I put many more mushrooms in than what is called for and added Nebiola Blanco, Maitake, Shitake, Crimini, and Portobello.   I also saute'd the spinach with olive oil and garlic, and used a ton!   A ton, and it's amazing.   Full large onion and 5 garlic cloves.   All amazing and went all organic.

I loved the taste of this recipe and will make it again.  It was particularly great the next day, and I froze a couple pieces for later!

  ==> Some comments:
1) The prep time of 35 minutes seems VERY low, at least for me.  I think it took me closer to an hour to prep. The timing matters when you have folks coming to dinner!

2) I decided there was not enough tomato sauce in each layer, so I increased it, but I think I overdid it -- next time, I think I will stick to the recipe for the sauce.

3) This is the first lasagna I had ever made.  To keep the noodles from sticking together after I drained the water, I laid them on cookie sheets that I had sprayed with vegetable oil spray.  I used several cookie sheets for this, which meant a lot of clean up.  I need to figure out a better way before I make lasagna again!

4) My dish could have stood a bit more baking -- I wish I had had the extra time (note the extra prep time in #1 above!)

5) I used a bag of baby spinach which I boiled, drained, and pressed.  I didn't bother measuring out 2 cups.

6) As a 1st time lasagna maker, the number of noodles in the recipe confused me.  I knew to overlap the noodles for each layer, so that wasn't a problem.  While the recipe calls for 20 noodles, the box at the store contained 18.  So I was afraid I would be short. In the end, I think I only used 15  noodles (3 layers of 5), so the box of 18 was plenty.  I didn't have room for any more noodles, so I certainly didn't need 20.

Delicious. Picking up on some other reviews, I used 4 c. of mushrooms, around 12 oz of frozen spinach (that I microwaved and drained prior to cooking), a jar of artichokes, and sauteed it all in one pan. I couldn't find romano cheese so I substituted around 1/3 c. of parmesan. I forgot the egg but it was fine without it. I didn't use a mixer but just stirred the veggie and cheese filling vigorously with a large spoon. I also used more tomato sauce and no cook noodles. This all made for a very large lasagna that spilled over a bit but it was totally worth it.

My Husband was skeptical that I was making a Lasagna without any meat....After his first helping he said it was a 9 out of 10! 
I added a alittle bit more ricotta cheese and used a food processor to combine the mushrooms, garlic, and onions so the pieces were not as big.  
The only negative is that it was pretty greasy on top from all the cheeses

I didn’t bother with lasagna noodles.  Just used bow tie pasta cooked to al dente.  Used a lot more spinach (frozen, chopped). less ricotta, no egg, more mozzarella.  Also added my secret ingredient:  PESTO.  Added a generous tablespoon of it (Costco brand) to the spinach mixture.  As others commented...no need to cook spinach separately or using a mixer.  I Sprayed the dish well with Pam before adding sauce as the bottom layer, then kept layering pasta, spinach mix, mozzarella, and sauce.  Didn’t measure at all.  I poured a few tablespoons of water over the top before covering and baking as the pasta will absorb more water and you don’t want it all to dry out.  I call this dish LASAGNISH  as I use other pasta instead of lasagna noodles (too much trouble.)   This gets RAVE reviews at potlucks where it is especially appreciated by non-meat eaters.

I followed the recipe but increased some quantities:  I used two bags of fresh baby spinach, and next time I may use one more.  I used a full 32-oz container of whole milk ricotta cheese, and a full box of fresh mushrooms.  I used a full box of lasagna noodles, which I think are more than 20.  Finally, I think Rao's Homemade Marinara sauce is the best, and I used a full 28-oz jar.

Yummy. Possibly the best lasagne I’ve ever had!  And I’ve had a lot.  First off, I made my own Pomodoro sauce, cheaper and tastier.  Other than that I followed the recipe, exact for the egg.  I think what made this stand out was mixing the yummy spinach, onions, mushrooms, spices and grated cheese with the ricotta cheese. I usually think it’s too bland but what was so full of flavor.  Thank you!  I’ll make it quite often.

I added a lot more spinach (about 6 cups or so) and had no fresh mushrooms on hand, so I chopped up canned mushrooms. I followed the recipe otherwise. It's more of a "white" lasagna and I personally like it saucier so I'll serve it with more tomato sauce on the side. Other than that it's a good recipe and I'll make it again!

Pretty good basic plan, but I tweaked it using homemade lasagna noodles and more spinach than in the recipe.  I don't see how  anyone could fit 20 regular noodles in a lasagna. I used 12 (3 per layer) but perhaps mine were larger than some store-bought ones.

I did not use eggs, used small curd cottage instead of ricotta and I went with my own sauce recipe, but the technique for the spinach in the white cheese sauce is genius! Making it for the second time tonight.

Loved this recipe.  I didn't have Romano, but I didn't miss it.  Made with homemade tomato sauce, definitly enjoyed more than a meat lasagna.  Brought it to a Christmas pot luck and received a lot of compliments

This was delicious! I didn't boil the spinach - seems very unnecessary. Next time I make it, I am going to try adding way more mushroom, spinach, and onion. The top didn't get a browned/crispy like I wanted, so next time I will remove the tinfoil with 10-15 minutes remaining or try the broiler at the end.

just perfect! I did this for a small get together with friends and everyone loved it. This lasagna was super tasty, even for the meat eaters. I did the recipe just as directed, but added one more layer =4. It turned out delicious. The last layer was pasta with sauce and mozzarella cheese. Will do it again

I'd gladly make this again. I did make a few changes. Chopped up the spinach and  sauteed it with the other vegetables and used a bit of seasoned salt in there. I also, blush, blush, forgot to add the tomato sauce until the end, so I loaded up my top layer with extra parmesan and mozzarella and dumped a big jar over the top of it all and covered it up and it was fabulous!

An awesome vegetarian dish!  I put zucchini and spinach in it and made it with Alfredo sauce because I have tummy issues and can't take tomato products.  20 noodles were way too many for me and hubby.   Wonderfully delicious!

I had so much fun making this.  I live in Guatemala and while people have heard of lasagna, few have tried it, nor really understand what is in it.  We had a family of 7 drop in as I was getting ready to assemble, and pretty soon had 5 young men chopping veggies, grating cheese, and standing in line to assemble it all.  "Another layer of cheese?"  "It already has 4 kinds of cheese in it."

I made one batch vegetarian, and the other with baked chicken breasts, as my husband won't eat anything with mushrooms -- go figure.  We had guests from Spain and Mexico for dinner, and the dish was a hit!!  If you have never made lasagna before, follow the recipe.  If you have made it in the past,  you can add other ingredients as you choose.  I added zucchini slices to the mix, and a few red pepper flakes to the sauce, because I like it just a bit zesty.  Remember to spray the aluminum foil before you put the pan in the oven or you will lose all the top cheese.  Enjoy

It was very tasty, but I think as-is it may have not been quite as good. I doubled the spinach (probably will add more next time), and added a cup of zucchini with the mushrooms. This was really good. My 5 year old thought there was too much ricotta, and I kind of agree, but I'm not sure if lowering to 2 cups ricotta would be a good idea, I will experiment a bit with that one... thanks for the recipe though, I'm glad I tried it!

This is very good!  Made it for a potluck at work and it was gone in a flash!  I am not a stickler for measuring ingredients and added way more mushrooms and at least 1.5 times the spinach it called for.  Other than that I followed the recipe pretty closely - or at least as close as I ever do.  :-)

I made a few changes just to make it quicker and because I didn't have a few ingredients on hand. I used frozen spinach that I had and sauteed it with the onions instead of chopping and boiling fresh spinach. I also used 2  containers of cream cheese instead of ricotta. It was quite the hit at dinner!

Yes
Added 2tbsp tomato paste to Muir Glen pasta sauce. Also sautéed green and red bell peppers, celery, carrots  and 1/2 small jar sun dried tomatoes chopped to sauce along with 2 tsp each oregano and basil. Only had 16 Oz ricotta so added 8oz low fat cream cheese. Used 1 bunch of fresh spinach and probably could have used 2.   Did not use mushrooms as we don’t like them. Used 12 lasagna noodles. Not sure how 20 would fit a 9x13 dish.  all else as written.   Came out beautifully. Cuts well. And for you green-o-phobes you don’t even notice the spinach. Adds texture mostly. This is a keeper

Used a whole bag of spinach instead of 2 cups. Used 2 cups of mushrooms and more onions than called for. Sautéed the spinach instead of boiled cuz I was too lazy to wash another pot! I put a bit of spinach into the cheese concoction, but mixed most of it with the mushrooms and onions instead and layered it separately from the cheese mixture. Sauced the bottom of the pan, 2 layers inside, and the top topped with mozz and parm. 1H cook time was perfect with foil on. Guests loved this recipe!

Excellent recipe. I added zucchini, fresh mushrooms and a large sweet onion.  I also added fresh spinach into the mixture toward the end so it was all combined vs boiling it separately.  The sweetness of the onion really came through in the end. 
I also added some extra sauce to keep it all moist.  I recommend you use a pizza mozerrella ball as it has more flavour and triple the basil. Awesome.

Amazing! My teenage son who doesn't like to eat veggies, ate it all. Raved reviews from everyone.

I was only able to fit 2 lasagna side-by-side for each layer. I replaced the Romano cheese with Cheddar cheese. I also added a little bit of clove (saw it in a different recipe) and didn't use any salt at all, and it was so flavorful.

I add a small amount of ground Italian sweet sausage to my sauce 1/2 cup.  It gave it a little zip in flavor.

This turned out well. I did what others did and sautéed the spinach with the onions, etc. also., I used fresh mozzarella and sliced it instead of shredded. It could use a little more spinach but it was a hit!

I substituted the fancier cheeses for a mozzarella and cottage cheese blend. Still good but somewhat bland, could also be the type of spinach(Swiss Chard) that I used. Be sure to separate the Lasagna Sheets frequently while cooking else they will fuse and stick together.

This is one of my family favorites! I do however use more spinach, and instead of of boiling it, I add it to the onion and mushroom mixture and continue sauteing together. In my opinion, the Parmesan cheese is not necessary. I've made it with and without, with no notable difference.

I added ground beef, but I followed everything else exactly.  I got really great feedback from those who ate it, but I thought it was too dry because of too little pasta sauce and too little mozzarella and too much ricotta.  Also, way too little spinach.  Next time I will increase the spinach, mozzarella, and sauce, and decrease the ricotta.  Also, I was a bit annoyed with how long it took to boil and cook the noodles and also the spinach.  Other reviewers sautéed the spinach with the onions, and even put the noodles in dry and added water to the cheese mixture.  Next time I will try this because that was the most time consuming part!

As the name suggests, it was a very simple recipe.
I did add twice the amount of mushrooms and spinach.
Outside of that, nothing else added. 
It tasted great.

I will definitely make this again.  I sauteed chopped green pepper, onion,  garlic , and a bit of ground Italian hot sausage.
Then I added sauce to it.  I also used frozen spinach which worked out fine , however you do need to squeeze out  the water. I do believe the next time I will try adding  some shredded carrots.

Amazing!! This was my first lasagna ever and it came out sooo delicious!   Honestly I'll just keep using this recipe from now on.  I can't figure out how to make personal notes on this site,  so I'm just going to write what I added here:  I added 1 lb browned ground turkey,  cooked the spinach with the onions and mushrooms, and next time will make more of the veggies. I do not have a mixer - it was still fine! I used Trader Joe's Vodka Sauce and will definitely buy pre-shredded mozzarella next time!    I came home and my boyfriend had eaten two big pieces out of it - he said it was incredible!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. The second time I doubled the sauce and added extra mozzarella cheese. I used diced mozzarella in the ricotta mixture. I also used baby spinach and added it to the pan with the onion and mushrooms and sautéed it. Thanks for the recipe:)

Used 10+ oz of spinach, almost two jars of sauce and whole container of mushrooms. I heated the spinach in a hot dry pan. 
Sometimes sprinkle 1 lb of ground meat 
/sausage to middle layer. Delicious!

Yum; I just cut the cheese down by almost 75%... I didn't use any extra cheese in the ricotta mixture. And I reduced the mozzerella from 3 cups to 1- and just placed it on top at the end.

I make this lasagna ALL THE TIME- it's so easy! I saute the spinach with the mushrooms and onions as well- a tip I learned from the other reviews. I usually use about 4 cups of spinach, a large jar of Victoria marinara from Costco (most regular jars just don't have enough sauce), and I go extra lazy with no-cook lasagna noodles. I use about 3 1/2 per layer. It turns out great! This lasagna is delicious and simple and a true crowd pleaser every time.

Amazing recipe! More involved than most recipes I'm used to, but more than worth it. I made it for a dinner party and the guests were raving  about it the whole time.

Very good!!  I also sauteed the spinach and mushrooms and garlic together.  I also used oven ready lasagna noodles, and it worked really well.  I did not use 20 noodles, maybe 10.  I will look forward to making this again!!

This was really good, and my family enjoyed it.  It was also a pretty easy recipe. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is that I thought it could use more spinach. While it seems like a lot at first, it isn't as much after you boil it.

I did not boil the spinach and it turned out just fine. I also used more spinach than the recipe called for.  Everyone I've served it to has raved about it. No one misses the meat!

My son who claims to hate cheese absolutely loved this recipe.  Had taken some out of the freezer to share with my brother and it got eaten before he could pick it up.  Good thing I had another portion saved in the freezer...He absolutely loved it also.

The only change made was that garlic favored spaghetti sauce was used in place of the tomato sauce.

Loved this recipe. Changes:
I increased the spinach to 3-4 cups, chopped the spinach, and once the onions were almost done cooking, I added the spinach until it was wilted. I don't like to boil spinach, because it loses a lot of its valuable nutrients in the water! Set the mixture to the side to cool, before adding it to the cheese!
I also browned Italian sausage(1lb) & ground beef(1lb) together in the same pan I used for the onion/mushroom/spinach. Drained, and added one jar of marinara sauce, and took off the burner. 
I only used 12 lasagna noodles. 4 noodles to make three layers. It worked out perfectly! 

Def going to make this recipe again:)

I loved this recipe, but will admit that I altered it a bit.  I used Barilla no-cook noodles and used as many as suited my lasagna pan.  Also, I saved a step by sautéing baby spinach with my mushrooms and onion.   It was delicious and I made it again the following week for our holiday meal.

So good! I made this for my Italian friend who cooks like a champ and even she said it was great. I pulled back a little on the cheese (but not much, ha), and otherwise followed the recipe. Each bite was great! Not sure what makes this so good--the spices? The cooked veggies? Whatever it is, it's great. Can't wait to eat the leftovers.

Excellent, but I doubled the spinach, and if I made it again, I would cut the amount of parmesan in half.

This recipe is delicious!  My husband is a picky eater and he absolutely loved this lasagna.  I added extra spinach, mushrooms and onions to the recipe and removed the foil from the lasagna 15 minutes before it was done cooking for those crispy corner pieces that we love.

I think my oven is a bit too intense, so 45 minutes worked for me. Excellent flavor even with the over-browned cheese.

Not really a fan. As a meat loving family, this wasn't s popular dish. I think lasagna needs meat. Won't be making this specific recipe again.

I will never make meat lasagna again!! I used cottage cheese instead of Ricotta for a personal preference.  It changes the texture, so be sure to use small curd and strain it well (cheese cloth works).  You definitely will NOT need 20 noodles.  I didn't listen to the reviews that said this and I wish I had.  Excellent recipe for upscale, work dinner party or dinner with family.

This was a huge hit on Thanksgiving!! I sautéed the spinach with the onions, mushrooms (2 cups), and garlic. Like most reviewers I added a lot more spinach. I omitted the Romano as my local store was out. I also mixed the Mozzarella and Parmesan in with the spinach mixture. Mixed roasted eggplant sauce with tomatoe basil sauce. Place a little sauce on the bottom of the pan. Layer 3 no boil noodles, spinach/cheese mixture, and sauce. Repeate. Place 3 more noodles, a little sauce, and sprinkle Mozzarella and Parmesan. Pop in the oven and enjoy. I will make the spinach mixture again to stuff chicken with.

WARNING: If you have any issues with self-control, do not make this lasagna. I cannot stop eating it!! It's so freaking delicious. 

When I rate a recipe I tend to follow the recipe EXACTLY so that I can give an accurate rating. However, I couldn't really follow this recipe exactly because there were just too many lasagna noodles. I used only 12 noodles (three layers of 4). Plus, I used about a cup more of sauce. I only boiled the spinach for ONE minute because it didn't need anymore (baby spinach). Otherwise, I followed everything else exactly and it was DEEEELICOUS!

Good. 3 noodles fit on 9 x 7. Add some extra Romano cheese for a sharper flavor bc it is a bit mild. You can put a bit more spinach in there as well. On the top layer put the cheese on top of the sauce for asthetics. Don't put a huge amount of the mixture between the noodles or it will get overbearing and chunky.

Everyone loved it!   Based on other recommendations, I made a few alterations: 
1) I doubled the mushrooms
2) added the chopped spinach to the onions and mushrooms for the last 2 minutes they were sautéing
3) after I layered the mushroom/cheese mixture on the noodles, I also added about 1/2 C of raw chopped spinach on top (for each layer)
4) Used approx. 4 C of pasta sauce vs. 3 C
5) Only used about 4 noodles for each of the 3 layers (12 in total vs. the 20 suggested)

I highly recommend this recipe, even following it precisely should be delicious.  My husband loved it and invited his brother over tonight for leftovers!

Just made this for the first time, and it did not last! We loved it! I followed the recipe, except: I used a larger pan, I did 4 layers, I used extra spinach and mushrooms (12 oz), and I added a single layer of browned poultry Italian sausage in the middle. I made the tomato sauce from scratch, as well. I could have used more sauce, and doing 3 layers would have worked fine as well. I estimate that this wouldn't fit well in a 9x13 pan. The flavor profile is great.

I followed the recipe, but found that it was slightly too salty. I think the recipe needs more spinach and mushroom to help balance out the cheese. Otherwise, it was a decent recipe.

Delicious!  It is a lot of work, but it is worth it.  It makes a lot so you can eat it for a few days.  I add WAY more spinach than the recipe calls for.  I usually triple the spinach. I also use way fewer noodles.   I put 3 in a layer and it is fine.

From my husband's mouth,"this is the BEST lasagna i've ever had...even better than my mom's!" this was a very tasty lasagna. you could taste every flavor you put in it, unlike if you use greasy meat. I did, ofcourse, make a few changes. I used baby spinach and probably twice as much,about 4 cups. And since I used a smaller dish (8x8), I only did two layers of filling, but made them a little thicker. Using wheat noodles also made this a thicker lasagna. Overall, just a great recipe!

I doubled the spinach and this was a great recipe!  I would rate it 5 stars even without my changes.  To add some meat - I know - taboo - I browned up some ground chicken breast in spices - great stuff.  My husband sd it was quite possibly the best he has ever had!

This was awesome!  I used the no boil lasagna, but think I will use old fashion kind next time as it seemed to soak up the pasta sauce a little too much on the leftovers. I also used porta bella mushrooms, they are a little meatier and used romano cheese instead of parmasan (too many different cheeses to buy) I used 2 boxes of frozen spinach instead of fresh.be sure to squeeze out the liquid.

I'd give it 3.5 stars. It is a respectable lasagna but not amazing. It needed more zing or something. I think there's probably a better veggie lasagna out there.

This recipe is amazing!  I did make some changes though, I added ground turkey to it(even though it's a meatless recipe) also left out the mushrooms simply because i didn't have them, not because we don't like them.  Then I did add more spinach than what it calls for.  The best part is that I added some red pepper flakes to give a kick to it(eyeballed) and it was awesome!  My husband loves things spicy and said he could eat it straight for another 2 weeks! thanks for the yummy recipe!

I used raw spinach (9 cups) and didn't boil it and used way more sauce and mushrooms than called for, as other reviewers suggested. I also sprinkled Italian seasoning on each layer. It turned out really tasty. I didn't let it sit before I served it so it wasn't set at all and fell apart unfortunately. I ended up using 9 lasagna noodles - I made two thick filling layers. Really yummy - will make again.

The first time I made this, I substituted 1 lb hamburger for the mushrooms and I used cottage cheese because I didn't have romano.  I accidently used extra-wide lasagna noodles, so I ended up with way to many. (Oops!)  My husband and 2 yr. old twins loved it and it disappeared quickly!  The second time I tried to make it vegetarian, but this time instead of mushrooms I shredded carrots and broccoli.  It was an experiment, and while you could probably slip in a few shredded carrots, my attempt was overpowering!

Fantastic recipe! I only used 16 noodles, and I added 4 mild italian sausages (cases broken open, and mince browned up, then added to tomato sauce). Rave reviews all around. A family favourite for years to come!

My first lasagna and it was so good! I was really surprised, I thought it would be a disaster.  Easy enough to make (Although I guess you don't have to cook the lasagna noodles.  Add more sauce to saturate).  I would definately make this again.  Maybe more spinich next time.

The lasagna was great! I added about 1 more teaspon of the condiments. I did add green bell pepper, extra spinach and mushrooms, and a little more onion. I also added extra cheese. The only thing that I did not like was that I came out a little watery ... I'm not sure why? I will defenetly be making this again. Good job!

I used more parmesan in place of the romano. I think the romano would have given it a flavor boost along with fresh basil instead of dried basil.

Good basic recipe. I used more spinach & mushrooms. Added clove garlic to our taste & used 2 sm cans of Italian tomato sauce. Better the next day like most pasta recipes w/tomato in it.

Although this recipe is rather time consuming, the end result is DELICIOUS. I like there to be at least some meat in my lasagna, so I added ground beef into the onion/mushroom sautee. I also tripled the cheese!!! All three times I have made this it has turned out wonderful, and makes for even better leftovers. If you are wondering which lasagna recipe is right, and you have the time to prepare this one, try it out.

Very good, but needs four cups (or more) of spinach, for sure!

do not "combine ricotta & Romano"-rather save Romano for layering.  also prep time must be increased at least 2 hours (it took me the better part of a day).  i even bought myself an industrial-strength lasagne pan.  my guests claimed it to be the best they even tasted.  a superb recipe.

The flavor was good but I too felt it was a little dry. I think that I would like more filling and will add more sauce, it is worth trying again but will need a little tweaking.

I substituted an italian blend for all the spices and used a Garlic Herb canned sauce. This recipe was great and makes a very large amount. Yum. The more garlic you add, the better it will be.

FANTASTIC!!
I made this for Thankgiving and I couldn't even find the pan I baked it in.  Everyone loved it.  I cooked freshed spinach which I drained and mixed in with a variety of other cheeses.  I didn't taste at all while I was cooking; However, I was told that it was seasoned to perfection.  This is definitely a "gourmet keeper" & I'm keeping it :-)

The best meatless lasagna I've ever tasted. A big hit with my family.
