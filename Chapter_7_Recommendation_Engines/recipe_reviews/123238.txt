I LOVE cucumber salad and this one was very good.  I didn't bother peeling the cucumbers or adding the water.  Cucumbers once cut  and thinly sliced produce a lot of water on their own.  I used white wine vinegar which is a lot less tart and used bit of fresh minced garlic vs. garlic powder. The fresh chives combined with the sour cream goes perfect in this salad.

Hubs and I really enjoyed this wonderful use of fresh spring chives from the garden!  I don't like a watery cucumber salad so I used English cucumbers and NO water.  I don't like an especially tangy cucumber salad either, so I reduced the vinegar by half.  (Had I used just regular ol' cucumbers I would have salted them lightly, then let them set for awhile until they released their juices before proceeding with the recipe)

yummy.
I followed the recipe exactly except, I did not add the sour cream until ready to serve I was worried about it being too runny. I strained the juices off first then added the sour cream and added slow about 1/2 of the jucies back in. this is great a keeper

I love cucumbers and have looked at many ways to prepare them, but think I have finally found my favorite in this recipe.  I did not change a thing, except to halve it since there is only my husband and me.  I can't wait to try it on the rest of my family when they come for Sunday dinners.  I think it will be a big hit!

Fabulous base recipe. I did exchange a few items for personal taste, 1/2cup light mayo 1/2cup light sour cream, scallions instead of chives, same amount of dill, and red wine vinegar...yum

Simply ADORED this salad!  I made a few exchanges consisting of yogurt, white wine vinegar, and wild garlic from my garden instead of what the recipe called for due to personal taste and what I had on hand.  I also eliminated the water and sliced and deseeded my cucumbers.  Beautiful dish and will be making it a lot.

THIS is the cucumber salad Mom use to make when I was younger.  It took me awhile, but I found a recipe with NO sugar.  I didn't have chives or green onions so I thinly sliced 1/2 of an onion then quartered the rings.  I used one large glove of garlic chopped.  I did these things just because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  I thought Mom added dill weed so I added about a teaspoon of it.  I should have made a double batch as my family of 7 ate it up and wanted more.  Great recipe!

This was fantastic!!  Gosh it was so refreshing!! I used the light sour cream, white wine vinegar, two green onions and fresh garlic. YUMMO!  I can see making this plenty in the summer with grilled foods. As one reader suggested, I can see where radishes would be really good mixed in, also.  Will try that next time.

I was looking for a cucumber salad that didn't use sugar as I don't like a sweet dressing.  I thought this was pretty good.  I might decrease the vinegar a bit next time, but that's just personal preference.   The only other change I made was to leave out the green onion, simply because I did not have any.

Very good stuff. I added some radishes and doubled the sauce in mine I needed to use up the radishes and it made a very pretty color contrast.

I didn't care for this too much but my boyfriend liked it.  It looked really good and sounded like it would be good, but it didn't come out that way for me.  It was a little too watery and, in my opinion, only needed about 1 tbsp vinegar.

As far as cuke salad goes, this was just okay.  I wouldn't add the water and add more of all of the dry spices.

The flavor was SO good but I thought it was even better the next day.  I used the dried chives so I threw them in for the hour with the sour cream to soften.  I also added some red bell pepper for color.  I used a 1mm blade in the food processor for the "thinly sliced" cucumbers and that was just too thin; they didn't hold their shape at all.  Will increase to 2mm next time and there WILL be a next time.  This replaces our previous favorite of cucumber in a vinagrette.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I substituted the sour cream for nonfat greek yogurt and left out the water.  Overall, a nice refreshing salad but too plain to stand on it's own.  I liked the person's suggestion to serve with an Indian meal!

This is SO good. Made it as a dish that I needed to bring to my best friend's house for dinner to go with Tandoori Chicken and a Mango Brown Rice Pilaf. This worked perfectly!!!! Will definately be using this over and over.  Oh, and this recipe is completely effortless. Even better :)

Good, but I wish I had fresh chives when I made this. I'll try it again, using fresh chives and fresh garlic instead.

Quick and easy recipe. I didnt add the green onions just because I find chives have the same flavor. I added some fresh chopped dill and some fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Great refreshing side dish when grilling on those hot summer days. Definately going in the recipe box!

Really good recipe, light subtle flavors, perfect for a summer side dish.  I had to use white wine vinegar b/c thats all I had but it was still good.  Will make this dish again.

I just made this tonight and it is incredible!!! I'm not a great cook by any stretch of the imagination, and just knowing what a bowl is says something for me... But, I made this, it was so easy and it's just delightful! My husband is eating it right out of the container!

This was delicious and a nice break from the Italian dressing I normally make cucumber salad with. It was a little watery so next time I think I'll try salting the cucumbers down first before mixing in the sour cream.  But, overall, thumbs up. I'll be making this a lot this summer!
