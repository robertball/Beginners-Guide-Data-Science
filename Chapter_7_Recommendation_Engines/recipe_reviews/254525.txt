The recipe notes say SPAM can be used (weird!), but as I don't eat meat I used veggie weiners (since it's an imitation of another processed meat). I liked the idea of this dish. I used a few cloves of garlic, minced, instead of garlic salt. I didn't chop the melon into very small pieces--just a preference--and I just boiled them until they felt just a little tender, and stir fried until they were softer yet with a little crunch.
