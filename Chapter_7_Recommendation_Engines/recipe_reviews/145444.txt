Brilliant! I used less salt like 'Debbie L' suggested too, and i also made the middle a bidder space so it was easier to spoon in the cheese mix and then fold it over and flatten ready to grill. My other half LOVED these too, and it's hard to get him to like anything!

Delicious and easy. My husband loved them. I used garlic and herb goats cheese and didn't add the fresh herbs to it.

Loved the flavor, but half the cheese melted out since I didn't make sure they were sealed. My sister in law recommended I try freezing the goat cheese in a flat disc shape, then wrapping the meat around, so I will try that next time.

Very good!  I shaped the burgers in an oval shape so we could wrap them in pitas easier.  Note: I did not add as much salt as the recipe called for-- it just seemed like too much.  Is it a typo maybe?  I used about 1/2 tsp. and it was fine (and I like my food salty!)

The original recipe was great but I have a few recommendations. Cut back a lil bit on the lamb and add some beef... lamb can be really greasy and the beef can soak up some of the great, making it easier to eat.   Also, suggestions for toppings, tomatoes, lettuce, and/or sauteed onions/mushrooms.  Oh, and you don't want to put ketchup/mustard on this burger so to mix it up spread some hummus onto the bread and add a little feta cheese... really bomb.

These lamb burgers were delicious and so easy to make. Even my roommate, who lives off mac & cheese, loved them. A sure crowd pleaser and highly recommended!

These were great! Both my hubby and brother-in-law loved them...especially the goat cheese middle. I did cut back on the salt and used herb goat cheese. I served on buns and topped them with tomato, red onion, lettuce and tzatziki...yum! Will definitely make these again and maybe eat in pitas.

Loooved it! I found out I was out of bread crumbs as I was making it, so I ground up some pretzels I had in the pantry instead, served these on pita with a little mayo, and they were fantastic!

These were INCREDIBLE. I did do one thing a little bit different. I mixed the herbs into the meat because I followed other reviewers' advice and froze the cheese in discs and placed them between two thin patties. No leaking cheese.

I was naughty and used ground beef instead, I'm not a big fan of lamb, but I thought it turned out great and my husband LOVED these burgers, he would give them a 5 star rating. After reading other reviews, I mixed the seasonings with the meat instead of the cheese and froze the goat cheese slightly first. Served with Tzatziki sauce. Wow, someone get me a breath mint! Thanks for the recipe

HOLY DELICIOUS! Goat cheese is my favorite cheese and I LOVE lamb....the combination of this is unreal. The only change I made was the salt (hope that is a typo) and they were perfect. My husband kept giving me a 'thumbs up' across the table because his mouth was too full to talk. ;) 5 year old & 1 yr old loved it too. Thank you for this keeper.

This was great. I used feta cheese instead of goat cheese. I didn't have too much trouble stuffing the burgers. The only time they leaked cheese was when it stuck to the grill. I would recommend spraying the grill with some kind of anti stick stuff.

We LOVED these burgers!! We first had goat cheese lamb burgers at a great restaurant in Laguna Beach, CA (Sundried Tomato Cafe) and they are scrumptious. This recipe is pretty darn close and tasted amazing! We were a little worried using grocery store ground lamb (versus a nice butcher's lamb) but it turned out phenomenal. The herbed goat cheese stuffing is fabulous, perfectly compliments it. We didn't use any condiments at all! The only thing it is missing is a glass of merlot on the side!

AMAZING!!!!! Sadly we couldn't find lamb so we used ground beef instead. Probably even more spectacular with lamb. Best to be made with more than one person because then it's easier and because there are many parts (then again I have only just started cooking). I would invite everyone in the world to try these.

I made these and cooked them on the George Foreman, they turned out wonderful! I refrigerated the extra patties to cook later. This wasn't a mistake (exactly) but the burgers are so thick that when I tried to cook the refrigerated ones I ended up with raw on the inside, well done on the outside. I had to cut them up and put them in the microwave for a bit to cook the red parts.

These were pretty good. I skipped the onions because I was feeling lazy. I used ground beef instead of lamb, and I used way more garlic and cheese.

These burgers were very good despite not being a huge fan of goat cheese.  My fiance, who is a super picky eater, fell in love with them though.  He keeps asking when I am making them again... looks like this will be a regular meal ;-)

Thank you so much for sharing! They were absoultely amazing. I used gluten-free bread crumbs for this receipe. I also cut down the amount of salt to 2 t instead of 4 since 4 just seemed like way to much.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I will definitely be keeping this one!

We have done this recipe twice now. Prep is easy and it's flavorful with spices and fresh herbs. My husband and I really love both key ingredients, lamb and goat cheese so we had to try this one. Very good with pita and homemade tzatziki sauce. Thanks for sharing LeeLeeCooks! It's in the rotation now!

These were DELICIOUS!  I did cut back on the salt and I used finely crushed rice chex instead of the breadcrumbs to make it gluten free.  Also, I made eight burgers and they were plenty big.  I divided the meat mix into 8 portions, then cut each portion in half, flattened them out, put a disc of goat cheese in the middle and flattened another meat portion on top.  I also used 1/2 T dried basil and oregano.  I'm sure fresh would be even better but just didn't have it in my garden yet!  Again...these were amazing!

My husband and I enjoy lamb burgers quite regularly and I used this recipe last night. I did as Mochinda recommended...I mixed the goat cheese as per the recipe and made flat discs and put them in the freezer while mixing the rest of the burgers. When the burger mixture was ready, for each burger, I split the meat into two, flattened them into two skinnier patties and then put one of the flat discs in between and sealed the burger....leaving them in the fridge until ready to use. It worked like a charm. These are so delicious, I swear I could eat them every night!

Great burgers, they did not fall apart, juicy and tasty. I used goats feta seasoned with tomato and basil. I only used a dash of salt and egg white instead of the egg. I made them on the stove vs. the grill and had no issues. I made a yougart tzatziki like sauce to go with the burgers.

This is delicious and easy!  I made it for dinner tonight and my husband and I devoured it!  The meat is quite moist and tender and very flavorful.  I did cut back on the salt and pepper a bit.  Also, since I don't have a grill I just put the burgers under the broiler for a bit and it worked perfectly.  Served on hamburger buns with tzatziki.

Delicious, easy and so flavorful! I do recommend using fresh rosemary in the burger meat, it adds a wonderful element.

Followed the recipe but made this as a meatloaf instead of burgers.  Amazing!  Will make again.

These were great! I used 1.3 pounds of lamb, 2 tsp salt, 2 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp ground rosemary & a touch of cayenne pepper, 1 egg & 3/4 cup breadcrumbs. The herbed goat cheese was super!

Good burger and nice change of pace from beef and not a complicated recipe. I can’t say I see a need to stuff the goat cheese in the burger. My goat cheese melted to an almost liquid state after grilling. I am a huge fan of goat cheese in flavor but also the creaminess which is lost once it melts that much. In this case, I think a nice slice of goat cheese on top would make me happier. Definitely recommend combining goat cheese with lamb though.

I have never reviewed a recipe before but after I made this I had to review it! It was absolutely AMAZING!! I made the recipe exactly as it was posted except I used ground beef instead of ground lamb. It was awesome! I love this recipe and will be making it again!

A huge hit. Brushed pitas with EVOO and toasted them on the grill for a minute or two while the burgers rested, and served with kettle chips, Chef John's tsatziki, and thin slices of red onion and tomato. Will definitely make these again this summer, with half the breadcrumbs and a teaspoon or two of sambal.

I think I would make it again but I would use CONSIDERABLY less salt. The salt was way too much. I thought it might have been a typo and should have used my better judgement and used less.  I ended up throwing the rest of the burgers after I tried one.

Delicious! I halved the recipe because it was for 2, but it still made 4 nice sized burgers. We used potatoes bread buns, yum!

These were really delicious. I halved the salt based on other reviews and I'm very glad I did. I also used rosemary and flat leaf parsley instead of the oregano and basil and it worked great!  I also made little discs of the goat cheese and froze them before putting them in the patties as other reviewer suggested and it did the trick. Will keep and definitely make again.

I tweaked some minor things, based on my family's tastes. we topped with cranberry sauce, for another twist to our fancy dinner. the complexity of flavors was outstanding! nice, juicy burger! I'm waiting for ground lamb to go back on sale!

Made this for the first time tonight on my new grill and it was very flavorful. I didn't have goat cheese so I used provolone instead and we loved it. Next time I will try the goat cheese. Really good!

I made these last night for a diner party as meatballs instead of hamburgers. My guests LOVED them and devoured them. My husband wants to have another diner party just so I can make them again. The only change I made was I used 1 tablespoon of dried Italian seasoning instead of the fresh basil and oregano.

Delicious!  I loved these!  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I had to substitute hamburger for ground lamb and Italian bread crumbs for plain, but it still turned out good.  Maybe a little salty - next time I think I'll cut the amount of salt in half.
