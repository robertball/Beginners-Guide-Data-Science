This was a desperation recipe for me and it turned out great.  I put six frozen tilapia filets into a ziploc bag, added about a half cup of sesame oil, a packet and a half of Italian seasoning, a sprinkling of salt and pepper and 3 cloves of minced garlic, then shook the bag up and let the filets marinate and defrost at the same time inside the bag in a sinkful of cold water for an hour.

Baked them for 22 minutes and they were perfectly done.  My family LOVED them and they had plenty of flavor.

Very, very nice recipe. We love the subtle flavor that sesame oil gives. A couple of things: I used that lemon pepper shake that you can buy for seafood rather than the Italian seasoning which I thought would clash with the sesame. Worked wonderfully. Also, I sprinkled toasted sesame seeds on the top. Be careful not to overcook and you've got a 5 star recipe!

THIS RECIPE WAS A HUGE HIT - and my family is extremely finicky.   But, I did do a few things differently than the recipe called for.  I used fresh herbs (oregano, basil, and parsley) and dried rosemary (but not much).   I put everything in a dish when I was making the marinade, then transferred it all to a ziplock bag and put in the refrigerator.  I made sure all pieces of fish were coated with the marinade and turned it (the bag) and massaged the fish every 30 minutes for an hour and a half - this was to make sure every peice was good and coated with all of the herbs and spices.  Then I took the fish out of the refrigerator, brushed all of the excess marinade (from inside the bag) onto the fish with a basting brush and enclosed all of the fish in an aluminum foil "tent" and put it in a glass baking dish.  The fish fell apart when it was done (about 40 minutes at 345- 350) and the juices were inside the foil bag with the fish.  I WILL DEFINATELY MAKE THIS AGAIN!  BRAVO to the creator of this recipe!

This was very tasty. I didn't use the exact amount of seasonings or oil ( just sort of sprinkled on what looked right). The only addition I made was to sprinkle the fish with sesame seeds before baking. Next time I think I am going to try marinating this overnite. The sesame taste was nice and mild and seemed to pair with the fish well.

Instead of baking this, I put it on my Foreman grill for 4 minutes, and it came out just right. Surprisingly delicious!

This is a winner!  I added twice as much garlic and a little more Italian Seasoning.  I baked at 400 for about 12 minutes and it turned out just great!

I loved this recipe.  I did make one change when I made it.  I also added some ginger to it.  I love the flavor of garlic and ginger together.

A simple, tasty easy to make dish...what more could you want.  I've tried it twice; once without the sesame oil and once without the Italian seasoning.  Both worked very nicely, although using both tends to confuse the flavors.

If you are in a hurry...this one is a good choice.  I didn't marinade in advance, and I did decrease the sesame oil by about half.  I couldn't believe how simple and delicious this was.

Flavorful and light.  I added sliced green onions to the oil mixture and marinated only an hour.  The fish was flaking nicely after only about 16 minutes.  Looked great with fresh minced basil and and parsley.  Excellent recipe and quick!

This was tasty and easy to prepare, and my husband and I enjoyed it, so I'll definitely be making it again. I was a little wary of using Italian seasoning after reading some of the reviews, but we thought it was a nice blend of flavors. I do have a few suggestions, though: (1) 1/4 cup of oil for 2 4-oz fillets of tilapia is MUCH TOO MUCH oil! Using half that amount still provides you with enough flavor and gives you enough liquid to drizzle over the top after it's done cooking. (2) Just marinade the fish in the same (non-metal) dish you're going to cook it in - one less dish to clean and easier than pouring oil from one dish to another. (3) Definitely sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds on top of the fish - adds good texture and additional flavor. You can buy pre-roasted seeds in well-stocked grocery stores in the asian food aisle (look for it with the sushi making ingredients). (4) Try to use actual sesame oil and not just vegetable oil infused with sesame flavor - it's a much richer taste. Thanks for the recipe!

This was an excellent, easy recipe! I was looking for something different and flavorful to do with tilapia and this was it. I used homemade Italian seasoning (recipe from this site) and added ground ginger too. I will save this and use it again and again!

I too was not sure how the Tilapia would taste after marinating in sesame oil, but it was a pleasant surprise. This recipe will be used again. It is best after marinating at least 6 hours in the fridge.

I've made this a few times. Sesame oil is amazing with tilapia. This recipe is a great start, but be prepared to add more seasoning, especially salt. I also took the tip from other reviewers to sprinkle with sesame seeds before baking. I serve it over seasoned white rice.

Pretty tasty for a quick and easy weeknight meal. All enjoyed, will make this again.  I jazzed it up a bit with little ginger and a dash of Chinese Five Spice instead of the italian seasoning . Topped with green onions.

we are afraid of fish at my house, but try to eat it nonetheless.  This was really good.  I didn't use the oil marinade, instead I rolled tilapia strips in flour seasoned with Italian herbs blend, salt & pepper and sesame seeds.  Baked in butter.  Served with a lemon wedge over risotto.  Got scarfed down!

Love the way the sesame oil tastes and the way its scent lingers in the air when I'm done cooking. Didn't have sesame seeds to add, but would like to try that. I used someone else's advice to try lemon pepper seasoning, but I also sprinkled a tad of the Italian seasoning. I'd also like to try this with ginger next time for a Hawaiian flair.

Just made it, and enjoyed the sesame flavor blend.  As suggested by another reviewer, I subbed lemon pepper blend for the Italian spices, and I think this worked well with this dish.  Might add a bit more lemon juice next time, or try the recipe as written.  A good, lighter dish!

I've been using this recipe for years!  I first tried it when I was trying to increase eating fish.  Neither my fiance and I were big fish eaters so I wanted to find something that we'd find yummy.  This definitely did the trick.  It's easy to make and the fish tasted wonderful.  Since then, this dish has stayed in my main rotation of recipes.

Was really good.  I marinated it overnight and used fresh Italian herbs: oregano, parsley, basil.  I also used just a little less than the 1/4 C sesame oil since it's a very strong flavored oil.  Thank you for such an awesome recipe that I will use very often.

I tried this dish tonight after marinating in the fridge since early this morning.  The fish had a very nice flavor, which is good, since tilapia is a very bland fish.  I would recommend overnight marinating, and I would also highly recommend BAKING FOR ONLY 15 MINUTES.  I checked the fish at 20 minutes and it was edible but dry and somewhat overdone.  I used about 3 tbsps olive oil, since I had no sesame oil, and tons of garlic.  I don't have 'Italian seasoning' but I do have oregano and basil, so I used those, and put in about a tsp of lime juice.  I beat all the seasonings into the oil first, then poured over the fish in a zip loc bag, then refrigerated.

This is a great recipe.  I didn't have the seasonings listed so I just added Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning and it was wonderful.  We have this dish every couple of weeks.  The sesame oil really makes a difference.  Thanks for a great way to prepare Tilapia.

I thought this was very good. I was shocked at how insanely expensive sesame oil is though. Due to this one thing, I probably won't make it again, but it really tasted great!

As written I did not care for this recipe at all.  Fish was overpowered by the competing strong flavors of sesame oil and the italian seasoning, plus it was extremely oily.  I would not even both trying to fix this one.

Only ok.  Doesn't really do a whole lot to the fish, and the texture leaves something to be desired.  If I try this again I might pan fry the fish to get a little texture to the surface to contrast.  Also the cooking time needs to be shortened to no more than 25min unless you want overdone fish.  I found 23 was perfect.

I prepared this for my friend who said that he did not like tilapia!  He loved it.  I did a little extra twist before baking.  A plain egg wash and then dipped in Panko Asian Sesame crumbs.  Baked as recommended.  Squzzed 1/2 lemon and about a table spoon of butter for a last minute sauce.  LOVED at all!

I marinated overnight. Baked at 350 for 20 minutes, otherwise followed to the letter. It was okay. I was expected more flavor, but it was my first time cooking with sesame oil, so maybe I was not expecting accurately. Husband liked the nutty flavor. not a repeat in our home.

I made this exactly according to the recipe.  I liked the texture of the fish a lot, but thought it was very bland.  I will try using Italian salad dressing, as others suggested, or something else to give this some flavor.

this was great. I probably used a little more sesame oil. added sesame seeds. didn't measure the seasonings- just sprinkled both sides w/ oregano, basil, garlic, salt/pepper. didn't marinate. served over wilted spinache. My husband loved it. We will definately make this again.

I found this recipe at the last minute and had to make a couple of modifications.  I didn't have itailian seasoning so I used low sodium seasonal.  I presoaked the fish in milk, then rinsed, while I mixed the marinade.  Same marinate and cooking time/temp, but I covered with foil.  When it was finished I sprinkled black sesame seeds for look and let sit for about 10 minutes (mainly cuz hubby wasn't ready yet).  Oh, and I had 4 fillets so I doubled the recipe, maybe could have used just a little less oil, but it was really yummy!!

This was amazing!  I admit I was very worried about the amount of peanut oil, but it was perfect.  I followed another recommendation and enclosed the fish in a foil tent, I highly recommend that so the fish doesn't dry out.  I also marinated the fish (while frozen) in the fridge in a zip lock bag for about 4 hours.  This is a must try, fantastic fish recipe!

As per some suggestions, I marinated the fillets with the sesame oil mix for over an hour...warning, DONT! It gave the fish a weird, almost gummy texture. The oil mixture definitely didnt take away the fishy taste. It could have used some lemon or any kind of acid in my opinion. I didnt like this recipe at all.

This was delicious! I only marinated it an hour, and overnight would have probably been better. Next time I will use that. I was looking for an easy, healthy recipe to use with tilapia and this was amazing! So delicious and easy to make. I added an extra clove of garlic as I'm a garlic fan. I'll definitely be using this again and again! ^^

Very tasty! The mild sesame paired very well with the mild Tilapia. To spice things up a bit I topped the fish with small yellow onion sautéed with about 1 tbs. of hoisin sauce. I served the fish with edamame and saffron, clove, corriander spiced rice to complete the meal.

I used six frozen filets and added extra garlic and 1/4 cup of teriyaki sauce.  The teriyaki cut down the "nutty" flavor.

I love sesame oil but I was a bit skeptical because I wasn't sure how well it would blend with the italian seasoning, but the oil that I used was not too heavy and the recipe was very good. I almost followed it to a tee with two small changes: I marinated over 2 nights and I only cooked the fish for about 15 minutes. It tasted great.

Very subtle flavor.  4 minutes on George Foreman grill works great!  Definitely needs more Italian seasoning, garlic and some ginger.  My kids all asked for seconds!

Honestly, this elicited a meh from me. It's sufficient for a quick on the go dinner, but the array of flavors really didn't appeal to my palate as much. Maybe it was due to the excessive sesame oil? Either way, I would probably take it easy on the sesame oil next time and incorporate just a touch of lemon to balance the flavors out a bit.

Very, very easy. I think next time I will use less oil, but over all it was good.  My husband likes it a lot. It does mask the taste of the fish, but that is a benefit to me.

This fish was excellent! I would have never thought the sesame oil would add so much flavor. I like a little spice, so I added some spicy asian sesame seasoning as well and served the fillets with white rice. It was great! Thanks! I will use this more often and get my family to eat more fish! *mine were done perfectly after only 20 minutes, 30 & I think they would have dried out*

Didn't completely follow the recipe but it was really good. I used the sesame oil but instead of the Italian seasoning I used Emeril's Oriental Seasoning which made the dish a little spicy but very good.

This was soooo good. Quick, easy, healthy. I would add less sesame oil next time - take it down by 1/3.

My hubby made this with the red potatoes and greenbeans as a side to it. The whole meal was awesome. Loved the flavor of the fish.

This was really good. I followed the recipe  precisely. A word of caution, I didn't have enough tilapia, so I decided to use some salmon as well.  But the salmon didn't go well with this recipe. Stick with Tilapia. You won't regret it!

This dish is perfect as-is, & fortunately I was able to marinate the tilapia for several hours. Served with a side of steamed asparagus and, as a bed, a slightly simplified version of Red Chard and Caramelized Onions [from this site], the plates looked gorgeous & my family raved about the combination. Thanks so very much, Demi.

I love this recipe! Its one of my favorite for tilapia!!! So simple and quick but SO good. The only changes I make is using a goumet citrus sea salt and sprinkle with black and white sesame seeds.
Thanks for sharing this!

The whole family really enjoyed this recipe.  The sesame oil gives this a great flavor.  Served it with the lemon thyme rice recipe also found on this website, and this combo is now a family favorite!

Delicious, quick and easy.  I made it exactly as the recipe states except for one thing - I marinated the tilapia overnight with (liquid) marinade, then I used the marinade listed in the recipe and put it in the fridge for 1/2 hour as stated.  Made some couscous as a side dish.  I'd  definitely make this again.

I was a bit disapointed when I went to the grocery store & they were all out of tilapia. I had to buy salmon instead. But I have to say, this was the best salmon I've ever had. I didn't change anything else in the recipe. The salmon turned out tender & flakey. Very moist. The sesame oil is the key ingredient here. I served it with brown rice & stemed broccoli.  
It was so good that even my 2 year old cleared his plate!
Yummy!

This is a very simple recipe to make but I thought the taste was just ok.  I let it marinate for almost an hour and although you could taste the sesame oil, it just didn't have a lot of other flavors.  I would try again as it was easy and I have the ingredients on hand.

my husband said this was an A+, which is a rarity. i personally thought it was a little bland. might go heavier on the salt than i did, and that would help.

I cooked 2 different kinds of tilapia and this one got the better review of the 2 from everyone. It had a good flavor, although I did use Zesty Italian salad dressing instead of the italian seasoning. I took out some of the sesame oil as well since there was alot of oil in the dressing.

I loved this recipe. I used some italian dressing instead of "seasoning" and it came out really good. I served this with watercress and bean sprouts for a light dinner! It was a hit.

This was excellent on a bed of steamed white (short grain) rice.  It smelled very strongly of sesame at first, but every fillet soaked it up nicely and gave them wonderful flavor.  This will be made often and recommended to friends and family!

This was good; I liked it more than my husband did.  I marinated the fish overnight and used fresh oregano, chives, rosemary, and parsley from my herb garden.  You could really taste the freshness of the herbs.  Served it with creamed spinach for a healthy meal.

This was a good recipe, not great, but I will probably make it again.  Hint: if you're going to add sesame seeds to the dish, try toasting them on the stove first before adding them.  They'll have a better flavor.

This "Sesame Tilapia" (marinated 2 hours) tasted many orders of magnitude better as "leftovers" after the flavor developed than when it was hot. My fish seemed to have a lot of water in it, so the marinade "washed away." I really needed to add some Asian sauce as a condiment to "kick it up" for our tastes (5 stars served like that). I used toasted (not flavorless plain) sesame oil because I like the classical Asian flavor. Thank you DEMI3RD for sharing your recipe.

This is a very simple, light, easy dish to make. I added in some green onion as well and it went perfectly with the flavors. I'm not quite sure what to do as a side since the fish isn't a meal on its own.

Marinated the fish for several hours, cooked exactly as directed. Very easy recipe, but in the end it needed a little something extra, I drizzled some lemon juice on top and it was wonderful.

I liked this, but at 2o minutes, my fish was done and had actually split. Also, next time, I'll probably use less sesame oil and maybe add a little ginger.

We weren't huge fans of this. For one thing, the flavor of sesame oil is altered by heating; it loses its tang and flattens out. I knew this all along, which makes me wonder why I decided to make this in the first place, but I think I just didn't look closely at the ingredients list. There's really nothing in the marinade but sesame oil and a few spices. Basically, you're baking the fish in oil (and not cheap oil, by the way, and this recipe uses a LOT of it). Which would be fine if the end result was delicious, but we found it just sort of bland and oily. Sorry!

Not a big hit. Although the taste was okay, the texture was not. It was cooked to the point of flaking with a fork, but still seemed wet.

I thought this recipe was ok. I didn't have a chance to marinate it for 30 minutes, so I'm sure that would have made more of a difference.  Couldn't taste the garlic at all, but I thought it was definitely a 4 and not a 5 star recipe.

I didn't love this recipe, to be honest. I wanted to love it since I make tilapia all the time, but I actually thought the fish tasted too oily. If I were to make this again, I would halve the amount of oil I used, but realistically, I don't intend on making it again.

This was fantastic.  We pan fried instead of baked just to save time, but wow it was great!  What a beautiful blend for tilapia.

Definitely add more garlic and some sesame seeds, and I think I'll tweak it next time. Wasn't as good as the Garlic Lemon Tilapia recipe on here.

Great recipe, I'll make it repeatedly, except it calls for too much oil. I didn't have Italian seasoning, so instead I sprinkled basil plus Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb. That was fantastic, plus sesame seeds on top. Followed another suggestion to bake @400 for 12 minutes.

Thank you so much for this recipe. I made this dish  the other night for my mother that loves tilapia. I had to use garlic powder seens how i did not have any fresh garlic on hand. It turned out amazing.

I have made this three times now and just love it.  My husband, who is not a tilapia fan, said tonight..."that I like!"  So easy.  I let it marinate over night.  Takes just minutes to prepare.

Such an easy and tasty meal! I made a few changes: brushed the sesame oil & garlic on the fillets to cut down on the fat, used the lemon pepper instead of Italian seasonings, layed them in the baking dish and since I had some leftover bread crumbs, sprinkled them on top of the fish.  Also threw in some chopped almonds for kicks. It turned out really well...this one's a keeper!

the sesame oil makes a great flavor base for fish, but the italian seasoning doesn't knock me out. didn't seem to work with the tilapia. i have created a seriously altered version of this recipe, but the flavor so different, it really qualifies as a separate recipe. i will post it soon and ya'll can try my version - which was a huge hit, BTW ;)
not a bad recipe, but needs, well, something. it was quick and easy - and pretty healthy, so those are big plusses.

I served this to 25 people & it was a general consensus... it's ok.  Nothing wonderful, not something they would want to serve if they were hosting a dinner party.  Probably won't make this again.

Such great flavor and the fish were so moist.  I used 3 small cloves of garlic and turned into a paste with a little salt.  Then combined all the ingredients and brushed over the fish.  They only got about 10 minutes of marinating time but turned out great anyway.

One of my alltime favorite recipes, and so easy to make.  If you use the very thin, previously frozen filets they get a bit crispy around the edges when baked.

I slightly modified the recipe by using Mongolian fire oil. I did a marinade in that and then dipped the 2 filet's in seasoned bread crumbs. Baked them for 30 mins in a small dish with a touch of olive oil. Served alongside sweet corn and some seasoned veggies. The fish was tender and moist. Great simple recipe.

This was great i was a little nervous about it and i followed the recipe except for adding a little green onion and i marinated it for about 6 hours.  When it was cooking my boyfriend said he didn't think it would be good but he went back for seconds and that is what makes this a keeper as well as a 5 star review.

this is SO bad. the combination of flavors was kind of intriguing to me, and curiosity killed the cat. the sesame and the italian seasonings do not blend well at all, and the extra time marinating really just left the fish soggy. this recipe was a waste of time and tilapia.

This was very easy and quick to put together.  I didn't have time, so I marinated this only a half hour at room temperature, but it was still delicious.  I just drizzled the fish with sesame oil, but did not use the 1/4 cup called for.  I also added toasted sesame seeds at the end.  We all enjoyed this dish.  Thanks so much!

How simple, and absolutely yummy!  I would never have thought of the sesame oil with the Italian spices - but it so works.  My kids cleaned their plates, and even husband was vocally complimentary!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was great! I did not measure my seasoning out. I just sprinkled it on as I like to do. I used garlic salt instead of fresh garlic & sprinkled a little of the chuncky salt on the filets after it was completely cooked. It was perfect that way so it wasn't overly salty tasting but just right with every bite. It's great with Uncle Ben's long grain rice.

My husband and 4 year old son absolutely loved this.  I liked it pretty well, but next time will try marinating overnight in hopes of a little more flavor.  (I did marinate for about an hour.) I did not have italian seasoning so I used basil, and added some fresh ginger. I served it over garlic couscous, which was a good match, and with a side of sauteed spinach.  I will make this again!

I made this for dinner tonight and we loved it!  It was easy, quick (instead of baking it I pan-fried it for speed, worked out perfectly with the sesame oil already in it!) delicious and relatively low cost. We eat a lot of fish and are always on the prowl for unique recipes - this one fit the bill nicely and it will definitely go into my  favorites to be made again. Thank you!

I made this last night for my husband and me and it was not good at all. There was very little flavor and I even marinated it in the fridge for close to 10 hours. I also used italian dressing as others have suggested. I will not be making this dish again.

I thought this was great!  I cut down the sesame oil by half and added some italian salad dressing to the marinade.  The fish cooked in less than 30 minutes.  The sesame oil delivered a different aroma, but I thought it was really light and tasty.  My husband liked it but said that it had an unusual aroma.  We'll definitely make this again!

I made this for four following the instructions in one of the reviews. I put the tilapia in a bag with the oil, but substituted fresh oregano, basil and parsley for the 'italian seasoning'. Marinated for 30 minutes, baked at 350 for 30 minutes, and served over a bed of rice. Everyone (even the 4 year old) loved it. Husband said it could use some lemon.

This receipe was very good.  I made this dish for a luncheon at work.  I marinaded the fish overnight.  The tilapia fillets along with marinade were wrapped up individually in aluminum foil and grilled.  Everyone loved this dish.  I will definately make again.

I marinated for 6 hours and didn't get much sesame in the fish.  I'll try longer next time.

Also, I pan-fried for 3-4 min per side to save cooking time.

I thought this was pretty good, but it ended up a little too bland for me and my family. We do love flavor though! I didn't have enough sesame oil so I only used half the recipe called for and then substituted with an infused olive oil. Followed the recipe in all the other ways and it cooked really well! I put it all in a ziplock and let it marinate while the frozen fish thawed in cold water. In hindsight I think I marinating overnight and using more sesame oil will help. Will also experiment with using other Asian inspired flavors like water chestnuts, soy sauce and fried rice. A nice, easy meal to make for busy days!

So simple, quick, and tasty.  Followed recipe and added a bit of fresh grated ginger to each filet. Marinated fish in sesame mixture for 30 minutes prior to cooking.  Garnished with sweet and & sour.

I love this recipe...it's my favorite way to make tilapia. I usually only have time to marinade it for a few hours and it's still delicious. My one year old son loves it as well and will eat a whole one to himself! We have to double the recipe to satisfy everyone.

I was getting frustrated with most Tilapia recipes requiring breading or being done in a Spanish style. (Both are delicious options, but I wanted something new.) This was a refreshing recipe for the sweet fish and was well received in my home. Simple ingredients, easy to cook and yummy.

Tip: to get extra flavor, marinade overnight and cook for an extra 5 minutes. You'll get a sweet aftertaste from all the seasoning.

I baked about 35 minutes.  I also used lemon pepper in place of Italian seasoning.  Very moist!  I was afraid the sesame oil would be over powering so I cut it back a bit.  Turned out great.

Super simple. Good for a healthy quick dinner. I dribbled the oil on b
one side of fish then brushed it around so that it wouldn't be too oily. I crushed a couple cloves of garlic on and sprinkled with Braggs seasonong. Then repeated on the other side and let marinate for an hour. It baked in the oven in about 15 minutes

I loved this recipe I combined some of the suggestions above and the results were excellent I added the fresh rosemary and a little bit of fresh chives put 4 frozen fillets in a large zip lock bag added all ingredients and let thaw in cold water for an hour.  I then baked at 350 in tented foil in a baking pan for 40 min.  Served with Italian spiced couscousa and roasted red and green bell peppers. Yummy

It was good, but the Italian Seasoning didn't really go well with it. I would still make it again, but I'll use something else with the sesame oil.

This was a great, easy recipe.  I didn't have sesame oil on hand and just used olive oil.  Still great but can't wait to try it with sesame oil when I get some more.   I fixed this with Stir Fried Kale by FISHLOVE and some garlic mashed potatoes.  Great meal.

Followed it to a 'T' (except perhaps I was heavy on the garlic).  We found it a bit bland for our tastes.  Perhaps we are so used to fish with stronger spice.  Eatable but not our favorite.  Worth the try though!

I tried this because I had the ingredients on hand.  I like the idea of the sesame oil, but the Italian seasoning just didn't work for me.  My husband liked this dish. We matched the ratings here -- some love this recipe and others not so much! I may experiment with other seasonings.

A subtle clean taste with this simple and yummy recipe. Easily adapts for garlic powder if fresh isn't available. We really enjoy this over rice with broccoli and other veg. Yum!

This was my kids introduction to fish that was not just fried!  And it passed with flying colours....my kids are 5, 5, and 4 and they all ate it!  Awesome!  THanks so much....I thought it a little bland which is why 4 stars but really an easy good recipe you can doctor up to suit.

This was so good.  I let it marinate for 6 hours and it was so much better.  My daughter's only went for 3 and it was so-so but after 6 my husband's and mine were to die for!

Wonderful! This recipe was quick and simple and tasted great! I used frozen tilapia filets and pan fried it, made a great quick dinner after work.

Very nice light flavor. We prefer broiled tilapia, so we were eating this about 45 minutes after I found the recipe. We had a lot of smoke from all the oil, of course. I might not add the extra marinade to cook next time. Definitely a top recipe for tilapia. Kids loved it, too.

Very good flavor.  Thought the combination of Italian Seasoning and sesame oil might be a bit overpowering for fish, but it wasn't at all.  In fact next time I'm using more sesame oil.  Prepared on my indoor grill pan, this was quick and perfectly moist.  I only grilled the fish for a couple of minutes on each side.

This is OH so tasty!  I let it sit in the marinade for about 1.5 hours and then drizzled a little extra sesame oil over the top before I baked it.  It turned out GREAT and I will definitely make it again!  I like a bit more extreme flavor, so next time I'm going to double the "marinade" and use half of it to marinate and half of it to spread as a glaze over the fish before I bake it!

I don't like fish, my boyfriend does. This was so wonderful though!! I did not think I would like the sesame oil, I was not fond of the smell. But the end result was a flavorful, mild, delicious dinner I will surely make again.

This was good except something about the Italian seasoning didn't jive for me and I'd probably replace that next time.  My boyfriend really enjoyed however.

Perfect recipe for Tilapia!  I marinated in ziplock bag, per other's suggestions.  I ran out of sesame oil and only had just over 1/8 cup for 4 fillets - was totally fine and will make it the same way next time.  Paired with Homemade Basil noodles and topped with wilted baby spinach and toasted almonds.  My husband called it a "gourmet restaurant quality meal!"  Thanks for the recipe!

Thirty minutes is way too long for this fish--it came out crispy which is not what I was expecting for baked fish, and I only left it in for about 20-25 minutes!  Plus, the marinade really didn't sink into the fish all that well, so the flavor was lackluster--bland, in spite of my adding some powdered ginger towards the end along with roasted sesame seeds. I might play again with this recipe but it won't be anytime soon. My husband suggested that next time I could add a little white wine for moisture, but he also thought thirty minutes would still be way too long for such a light fish.

I would give this recipe between a 2 and a 3.  There is nothing specifically wrong with the recipe it's just very bland and I prefer more flavor in my cooking.  I followed suggestion to marinate longer and marinated for 24 hrs.  It still came out quite bland.

This recipe did not work for me...  the Sesame oil has a strong (almost pungent?) odor and it was all I could taste when I tried to eat it.  I did give it two stars because techinally it was edible, but even my boyfriend, who is easy to please at the kitchen table, said not to put this one in the recipe box.

I'm not sure what went wrong for me, but I made it by the recipe and it was awful.  I wanted to try something different with my tilapia, but I feel like I just wasted my money on the fish.  We won't be doing this again. My son said it tasted like the smell of paint.

I loved how this recipe came out!  Since I used 3 tilapia fillets I doubled all the marinade ingredients and let it soak overnight.  Otherwise I followed all the rest of the directions to the letter.  My husband LOVED it and I'll make this again.

Great recipe! First time making tilapia I used this recipe, and absolutely loved it! Very simple and quick too, which is another plus!
