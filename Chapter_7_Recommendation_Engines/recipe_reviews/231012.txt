Try adding a teaspoon of season salt and a tablespoon of garlic. Also needs an extra tablespoon of pesto. Add corn starch to thicken (flour if no corn starch)

Was very easy and quick to make...had a great flavor, & my family loved it!! Only difference was I added about a tsp of garlic powder to the sauce & I served it over penne pasta.

The sauce was watery, The cream cheese didn't melt so much as separate and the flavor was bland. I followed the recipe exactly.

Really delicious, but needs more flavour.  I'd suggest adding some more pesto and maybe adding salt to the pasta water.  Added a little bit of pepper to the sauce as well for extra flavour.  Otherwise, I would recommend this recipe and make it again

Good, but as written doesn't work. Needs corn starch to thicken, garlic to add flavor, and 1 T more pesto. I had to make these adjustments, and with such it is really good.

I was looking for recipe to make with  my "homemade pesto", that I made from scratch from my basil . This was   delicious. I  did add 1/ 2 t  garlic powder -- I used  roasted red peppers,   that  worked out well since I didn't have a fresh red pepper  -- Now I  know I can sub .  I  did not  need  cornstarch -- I put  extra cream cheese and thicken up   well . I used  penne  pasta - will  be   making this  again.  oh I forgot  - made this for  2  but added  a lot more  pesto than stated in original recipe.

I liked it. Just add 3 more tablespoons of Pesto. Try adding Garlic Salt, it brings out more flavor. The Sauce is VERY watery if you make it as shown on this recipe. Mix Cornstarch and water and slowly pour it into the sauce mixture and stir until thickened.

I used a thicker, twisted noodle and did not add any red pepper but did add a bit of nutmeg. I also cooked the sauce quite a bit longer to thicken it up. Very delicious.

Loved it! I followed the recipe as stated. However, next time I will probably use fettuccini noodles or linguine noodles instead. Instead of cutting the red bell pepper into strips, I diced them. In my opinion the strips were to big. Oh yeah! I also added flavor. The creator of the recipe seems to not like seasoning. That's odd.

I only added 1 cup of milk and added another tablespoon of pesto. I used more chicken as well and the whole package of angelhair for dinner. It was amazing!
