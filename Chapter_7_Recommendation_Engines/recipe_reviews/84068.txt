After my third attempt at making this, I finally got it right.  It is difficult to form the crescent roll triangles into a circle (since they are canned together in a rectanglar shape) so I used a 13x9x.5 cookie sheet.  The first time I made it on a flat pizza sheet, and the edge of my crust was not sealed well enough and I had egg leak all over the bottom of my oven.  This time, the cookie sheet had just enough of a short edge to give support to the crust.  Additionally, I baked this at 350 (vs. 375) for 20-25 mins so that my egg will bake without my crust burning (which was my first trial mishap).  Third time is a charm and this was great.  I used sausage, onion (skilleted both with garlic powder and tabasco), then topped with the cheeses, sliced mushrooms, and thin sliced tomatoes.  Very easy.

I've made this for work celebrations and I got so many positive comments! I too leave off the peppers (not everyone may like them) and I use the refridgerated shredded hashbrowns. Just brown them ahead of time to make sure they're cooked through. The first time I made this I baked in as one large dish in a 13 x 9 pan, the results are more casserole-like, equally as delicious but takes about 45 minutes to bake.

YUMMY! We made these in a jelly roll pan instead of a pizza pan. I didn't add any of the bell peppers because unfortunately I'm the only one that loves them. We didn't have a single crumb left over. The eggs did have a hard time setting. When the crust was done the eggs were still alittle runny. I didn't want to overcook the crust so I ended up just putting the pizza in the microwave for about 20 seconds. Very good and hardy.

Made this for our kids last Christmas breakfast and they LOVED it. And, it was pretty easy to make.(actually, my husband made it!) Had to put the pepper and onions on the side for the kids.

I've made this several times.  It is not the most flavorful thing I have ever made.  I don't like onions and peppers so I leave them off.  I bet it would be a lot better if they were added.

Great and easy breakfast.  Fixed this for family coming over and they loved it.  Changed it to make it a lowfat breakfast.  Used low fat cressent rolls, Jimmy Dean crumbled turkey sausage and low fat cheese.  Also added chopped bell pepper, mushrooms, and zuchinni

This is delicious!  I am unable, after several tries, to make a decent round crust.  It still turns out great every time.

Well, my family dislikes veggies.  NO veggies NO potatoes of any kind on this pizza.  First, I rolled out crescent rolls into a square baking sheet and pre cooked the crust.  I made 2 cups of homemade Alfredo sauce for the base.  Then added cooked crumbled sausage.  Cooked Scrambled Eggs, Cheddar/Jack Cheese and then Topped with Cooked crumbled bacon.  Tossed this back in the oven for maybe 5 minutes or so to melt the cheeses.  NOW this is a keeper even though there are major changes to suit my family.  Sage flavored sausage works great too.

A very easy recipe and all three of my kids loved it.  Rather than the crescent rolls, I substituted a Pillsbury thin pizza crust (found in the biscuit area).  Enjoy!

My family loves this recipe. I usually omit the peppers because my boys won't eat them. Also, I just roll my crescent rolls out flat on a bar pan that way there is not messing with trying to make the pizza. Then I cut into squares. I use the Pampered Chef large bar stone and there is not leaky mess.

I made this over the weekend and will definitely make again. I had a hard time making a round pizza so I made a square (only make one pizza).  I omitted the potatoes because I didn't have any and omitted the Parmesan too. It turned out delicious and my husband loved it. The next day I heated the leftovers in the oven and it was a great breakfast again.

I don’t care for the sweetness of crescent rolls so I used the Pillsbury pizza crust.  The instructions on that say to prebake before filling so I did do that.  Sautéed the onions and peppers to give them a boost and then following another review I gave the potatoes a quick cook.  The pizza crust makes a 10 x 15” pizza. I halved the recipe so used 3 eggs but I think if doing it this way it could easily use another one.  Really good pizza. I will be making this again.  Thanks for posting!

Made this for the first time, and it was a success.  In a dark 9 x 13 inch cookie sheet, I unrolled one full cressent sheet and covered the bottom of the pan.  With the dough of 3 cressent triangles, I rolled out and pressed a thin tubular border around the whole pizza to build up the crust.  Because the pizza was smaller, I only used 1 pound of sausage, less than a cup of potatoes, and 4 eggs.  The result ends up a little on the bland side...adding italian seasoning to sausage helped.   To add more flavor, next time I think I will try using a sage pork sausage, a cheese that isn't as bland as cheddar, and perhaps add a spiced canadian or regular bacon.  The smaller size fed a family of 5 with lots of leftovers.
