We loved this.  Juicy and tender, bright, fresh flavor. I used dill rather than oregano for its milder, more subtle flavor and marinated the chicken for just over three hours. I sliced them up and served them over a big, tossed green salad with a homemade Barbecue Ranch dressing.  Hubs made a point of mentioning that he generally doesn't like marinades but that this was a "make again" - but he said I never "make it again" when he tells me to "make it again."  This was so easy and so good that I will have to make a point to please him and make it again.

It was delicious.  Even my picky eater boyfriend liked it.  Instead of 1 tsp of Oregano I used 1/2 tsp Oregano and I think it was the perfect amount for my taste.  And it sat marinating overnight, instead of 8 hours it turned out to be more like 14 hours.  The taste was strong which I like, but you could still get the chicken flavor.  Will definitely make this again in the future.

Marinated for about 6 hours and cooked on the grill.  Very juicy and flavorful, but I would have liked a bit more lemon flavor.  Recipe does specify "8 hours or overnight," so that could have been my issue, not the recipe's.  Next time I'll marinate overnight.  Not to worry, though, it was all good and all eaten!

I used garlic infused olive oil to increase the garlic flavor
Fresh oregano was also used, and about 2x the amount in the recipe

Hi.  This was delicious but I added some rosemary, thyme and hot pepper flakes to give it a bit of a punch.

Love this dish, could eat it everyday. I didn't have time to marinate, but mixed all ingredients and placed in preheated oven covered with foil at 425* for 1.5 hrs then removed foil and browned for 15-20 mins to my liking.

Simple and delicious. My husband asked me to keep making this chicken, my daughter's friend who never eats my food said the chicken was delicious. I didn't have breast so used boneless chicken thighs, and used just 1/2 tsp oregano.
