Wow...This cake is inceredable rich but very good. I did mine a little different. Fisrt i doubled the recipe so i could use it in a pan with fluted sides. I didn't have the chocolate squares so i used chips. I used a semi sweet chip and a mint chocolate chip. After i melted it i left some out. After it was all done and cooled i took some heavy cream and whipped it up. I then added the extra melted chocolate to it and whipped it in. I cover the cake in the whipped frosting. It made it extra good.

This cake didn't rise - maybe my foamy egg whites weren't foamy enough - but can cake be built withuot baking powder? I am at a loss. Mine resembles crumbly brownies with a gritty coffe ground flavour.

I don't know what I did wrong but this recipe totally failed for me. The cake was completely flat (although the taste was good). Had I been baking it for home I would have just served it to the teens but I had planned to take this to a party.
