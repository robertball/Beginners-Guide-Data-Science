I love hummus so I have been trying different recipes than just your traditional hummus. This was very good and did not have an overwhelming jalapeno flavor. I did use fresh jalapeno instead of dried and added some tahini paste. Mine was a little dry so I adjusted my wet ingredients accordingly. Very tasty!

Hummus isn't really my bag but we were having guests that I knew would dig it so we gave this a whirl. It was super easy to prepare and I didn't end up needing any additional liquid. Our grocery store didn't carry dried jalapeno (even in the specialty Mexican section) so I subbed a whole (deseeded and demembrand jalapeno). I'd make this again particularly when we're entertaining dairy free friends. THANKS for the recipe erin!
