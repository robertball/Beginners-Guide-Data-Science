These cookies did not need the cream cheese frosting at all - in fact I thought it detracted from how good these cookies were. If this recipe were for the cookies alone I would have given it 5 stars. I would recommend adding the baking soda to the flour before adding it to the mix and I was slightly scared by how crumbly the mixture was but with a little heat from my palms it stuck together and turned out great. As my husband said they taste like chocolate chip cookies without the chocolate chips. Thanks!

DELICIOUS!!! I made these as a desert for some company we had over the weekend and they loved them! THe kids loved them their kids loved them I got exactly 24 cookies just like the yield suggested. They were fabulous so soft and chewy. I am making these for Valentines day for my sons class and I am going to use red food coloring in the icing! Will definately keep this recipe thank you. Oh yea I used shortening instead of butter. I always get a softer cookie that way.

I love cream cheese so I decided to make these. The taste at first is odd but you get used to it and they actually are quite delicious. My family ate them all in one day!

Very easy to make with a fantastic chewy taste. I made these for Christmas and put red food coloring in the dough.

Definitely did not need the cream cheese filling. I thought that it made the cookies overly sweet. My family does not like pecans so we used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead and they turned out really good.

I rarely ever make a recipe that hasn't received more than 100 ratings and reviews. But when I found I had some extra cream cheese I found this recipe and it sounded good. I also hardly every give a recipe a review either. These cookies were KILLER! My husband only ever wants chocolate chip cookies (and only my recipe) when I make cookies. But since I made these last night he is begging me to make them again. FANTASTIC! I didn't add the nuts to the filling because I prefer a creamier filling but I kept the rest the same. Great dough - nice and stiff but not dry. Cooked beautifully.
