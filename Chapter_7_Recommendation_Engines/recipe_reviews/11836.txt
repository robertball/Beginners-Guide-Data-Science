After reading ALL the reviews I consolidated the good advice into the following: used small curd cottage cheese; upped the garlic powder to 1 full tsp.; added one package frozen chopped spinach (thawed, liquid squeezed out); added 2-3 tbs. fresh parsley and same amount of FRESH basil; added a healthy grind of black pepper; blended filling in the Cuisinart; used plenty of spaghetti sauce; added extra mozzarella on top.  Baked 20 minutes covered to keep from drying out and 20 minutes uncovered to brown.  Served with green Tabasco at the table for those who wanted more zip - it was awesome.  My die-hard carnivore of a husband liked it a lot but would welcome hamburger or sausage added to the filling or spaghetti sauce.  My vegetarian daughters were deliriously happy.  I'm great either way.  Will definitely make again.  In fact, I will make some to freeze for those hectic nights.  Real yummy.
Oh... one more thing... as recommended by others I boiled the shells 2.5 minutes less than directed, plunged into cold water and let dry.  They were easy to handle and didn't tear.  I didn't try piping filling in from a Ziploc but it sounds good.
             **************** U P D A T E ************
Made again and piped from a gallon size Ziploc bag.  Loved it, loved it!  The whole recipe of filling was too cumbersome to handle in the bag, about 1/3 at a time worked best for me.  A hole about the size of a dime works great.   Too small a hole is hard work, too large is hard to control.

So.  I don't like cottage cheese but wanted to give this a chance, so I made half the shells with ricotta instead, in case we didnt like the cottage cheese ones.  Oh and I used small curds (in the snack packs) instead, cause I thought the large ones might be gross!  It turned out after eating the cottage cheese ones, I couldn't go back to the plain ricotta ones!  The cottage cheese ones were so much richer and had good texture, I start thinking about the leftovers at like 10:30, when lunch is at 12, and cant wait until that time to eat them.  We had extra filling left over, and some extra manicotti shells; it made a really good manicotti filling too.  The only suggestion I would make is to season the filling a little bit with Italian seasoning, but other than that this dish is EXCELLENT.  *Update* I've now added one box of defrosted frozen spinach (rinsed and squeezed dry) and about half a pound of cooked ground sausage, and it's so delicious.  It makes this really hearty and works well if you have a needs-meat significant other like I do.  Otherwise I would still do the spinach for some added vitamins without the meat.  The large curd cottage cheese I found out is big and soft and not small and grainy like the small curds, and the texture is unnoticeable especially if you have spinach and sausage in there, so that's only what I use now!

I have not made this yet...but plan on doing so this week sometime!  I just wanted to share this tip that I use with EVERY lasagna & manicotti recipe. I have never pre-cooked the noodles.  Make everything up the night before, pour about 1/2 cup of water over the whole thing, cover with foil, and refrigerate till supper the next night.  The shells cook in the extra water and sauce, and its not the least bit runny!  No worrying about tearing the shells again!

Awesome filling.  I whiz the whole mixture  in my food processor to get a great texture.

To fill the shells easily, scoop all of the filling mixture into a zipper bag.  Just snip the tip off one corner of the bag and squeeze the mixture out of the hole into the shells.  Much tidier!

Easy and tasty.  I made some adjustments for my picky husband's (and mine too) tastes.  I used Ricotta instead of cottage cheese, added some garlic to the cheese mixture and some ground beef to the sauce.  I used a jarred Arribata (spelling?) sauce which went well with it.  It could have used more sauce we thought, maybe a jar and a half.  Hubby requested that this be added to the regular rotation, always a sign of approval.

This is an absolutely wonderful dish, and it freezes pretty well.  Stuffing the shells is the biggest challenge.....I think next time I'll put the filling into a ziplock bag and cut the corner off and fill them pastry bag-style.

Replace cottage cheese w/ricotta cheese, no egg in mixture makes stuffing to heavy. Add a little of the tomato sauce to mixture to smooth.

I have been making this recipe for decades, but I always add chopped spinach to the filling. I thaw and drain it before adding. I figure that this addition makes me think that I'm eating something healthy!

Thanks for all the great reviews.  When I posted this recipe in 2001 had no idea it would be so versitile.  Love the idea of chopped spinach in the filling.  Can't wait to try that myself.  Like I said in my Italian Sausage Soup review, I am a lazy wannabe Italian and come up with the easiest way to make a good recipe.  Glad you all enjoy this one too.  Thanks again for the wonderful reviews.  Karen M

We loved this recipe, and the only thing I changed was using 1/2 mozzarella and 1/2 shredded cheddar chesse, and used a parmesan/romano cheese mix, putting 1/4 C in the cheese mixture and reserving the rest for the top. Here are a couple of tips I have learned over the years about stuffed shells that the novice might find useful.  First, I mix all the cheeses & spices together with my mixer.  This not only breaks up large curds of cottage cheese, and thoroughly blends the spices, but will make the end result more creamy.  Second, follow the directions on the box for the shells BUT cook the shells 2 1/2 minutes less than it says, then immediately cover in cold water, but remember to keep the water cold.  Drain, and let shells air dry before filling.  This way you can just open them with your thumb and index finger for easy filling and they aren't as easily torn, plus the pasta stays firm. (Covering them with foil while baking will keep them from being dry also.)

Excellent recipe, thank you for sharing!  I will make this again and again!  I used the advice of another member and put the cheese mixture in a ziplock plastic bag and then snipped the end off when stuffing the shells.  It worked great, no mess!!!

This recipe was a big hit with my young daughters, vegetarian (adult) niece and the rest of the family. Everyone asked for the recipe.

I did add a little basil to the recipe in addition to the other spices.  

Since we were going to be gone all day and needed an easy dinner that evening, I stuffed the shells in the morning and refrigerated the dish all day.  When I baked it, the cheese mixture was a little watery on top... but that may because I didn't let the dish warm to room temperature before baking.  It was still delicious - just looked a little runny.  Next time, I let the dish warm up before baking.

I followed Sallyjun's recipe to the letter but when I went to stuff the shells using others suggestions of putting mixture in a plastic bag and cutting off a tip to allow mixture to be squeezed out, it was a horrible mess. So, here's what I did.  I used my smallest spring loaded scoop, about the size of a golf ball, and filled the scoop to the top and then released the filling into a shell....worked fantastic and there was very little mess.  Sometimes these small scoops are hard to find but they are worth their weight in gold.  I use it for making cookies.  Now back to the recipe.  I baked the pasta shells for 20 minutes covering it with non-stick aluminum foil and then removed the foil and baked for another 20 minutes.  Turned out perfect.  I used Prego which is our favorite red sauce.  Hope I've made someone's day with the small spring loaded scoup suggestion.  Meanwhile, thanks Sallyjun.....great recipe!

I made some changes based on some of the reviews as well as because I like to use fresh herbs better.  I used 2 cups small curd cottage cheese and 2 cups Ricotta Cheese.  I also chopped about 3 tbs. fresh basil and about the same of fresh parsley.  Added one pkg. chopped frozen Spinach, thawed and used freshly ground black pepper, 1 tsp. garlic powder, a little salt, freshly grated Parmesan cheese, about 1/3 cup shredded Asiago Cheese and about 2 tbs. grated Romano cheese. I used Bertolli Olive Oil & Garlic Spaghetti sauce and topped with freshly grated Parmesan.  Made it the night before and took to a potluck at work.  I got rave reviews.

Just wanted to let all of you die-hard ricotta fans know that until this past year I, too, would never think of using cottage cheese. I decided to give it a try with lasagna and now I will never go back to ricotta. I tried it in this recipes and again it was fantastic. But don't tell my family. Thanks for the recipe.

Simply, ooey gooey cheesy goodness!!  These were even better the next day after the cheeses had settled and firmed a little more.  I recommend fresh shredded parmesan cheese and extra mozzarella.  Serve with a garden salad with Italian dressing, and you have a meal better than you could buy at Olive Garden!!

This recipe is delicious! I made it for myself and my boyfriend and we both loved it.  I only have a 9x13 pan, so I made the recipe in that and found that I had enough shells and filling to fill another 8x11 baking dish too! I assembled the second pan and put it in the freezer.  Not sure how long it will last in there, since my boyfriend won't stop raving about the first batch! Thanks for the good recipe.

Awesome with a few needed changes: For a 16 oz box of shells, I used 1c small curd cottage cheese, 1 & 1/2 c ricotta cheese, 16 oz shredded mozz cheese, 2 jars spag sauce, 1/4 c parm cheese, 2 eggs, 1 t garlic powder & 1/2 t each: oregano, basil, parsley, fresh pepper.  Mix all spices, all cheese (excpet 1/2 of the mozz), & eggs: set aside. Cook shells 3 minutes less than directed, emerge in cold water until cool, place on a clean towel and let air dry (1 hour or so). Cover bottom of 9X13 dish with sauce, fill shells (I used a gallon bag with dime size whole at one tip and add 1/3 of mixture at a time).Place shells seam side up and very close together, top with rest of sauce, make sure you get all of the shells. Sprinkle with some parm cheese and the rest of the mozz cheese. Bake covered 20 minutes and uncovered 15 more minutes. Let sit for 10 minutes prior to serving. I added meatballs and sausage to the dish, just wonderful.

This recipe has become my family's favorite.  I can't make them fast enough.  Really great taste.  I make my own marinara sauce which takes a bit longer but also makes them wonderful.  Thanks from our whole family.

I made this for six women last night & they loved it!  I used half ricotta & half cottage cheese - I blended all the ingredients in my food processor.  As suggested, I used a ziplock bag to pipe the filling into the shells... could have used one more hand!  Overall, very good recipe!

This recipe was very good, although I have to admit that I used fat-free ricotta (Sargento), fat-free mozzarella (Kraft), and low-fat Parmesan (Kraft). I pumped up the spices a little, and the flavor was great! I also doubled the sauce. What a low-fat solution to a normally hi-fat recipe and it was so tasty!

Have been making this for years except I do not pre-cook my shells. It is too hard to stuff those little puppies. I stuff the shells, pour a layer of sauce in the bottom of my baking pan, place shells
in pan, pour more sauce over, cover with foil and bake as directed. My shells always come out tender.

I liked this recipe but needs meat.  When I make shells I always add a sweet italian sausage and hamburger mixture to the shells.  I add the meat mixture in the shells then add everything else on top.

Aside from the actual shell stuffing (although using a ziplock bag made it easeier) this recipe was fantastic. I like more 'stuff' in my pasta dishes, so I added mushrooms, spinach, and sausage (un-cased, cooked, blended) to give it extra pop...and it was a huge hit. I might use extra sauce next time.

This was excellent. I followed the recipe as is, and I'll make it again for sure. I have never liked stuffed shells because I hate ricotta, but this was awesome with the cottage cheese. Oh, I did use the small curd. Loved it.

I made the 4 serving version, but increased the garlic powder as another reviewer suggested.  When I opened the box of pasta A LOT of the shells were broken, so glad I was only needing half the box.  I used small curd cottage cheese, fresh sauted spinach (drained).  I put everything in the mixer to blend it well.  I chilled the mixture to make it easier to fill (it made a big difference and I only needed a spoon to fill with).  I cooked the shells for 2.5 mins less than the 10 mins on the box....then shocked them in cold water.  I had a bunch that had tears in them, but thankfully I was doing a half portion of this recipe.  I baked covered with foil for 20 mins and uncovered for 10 mins.  I garnished with fresh parsley.  Served with potatoes, but the whole time we were wishing we had some garlic bread.  They tasted like they came from a fancy restaurant.

Like any good Italian dish, I make the night before-always better the next day. Don't want a sloppy mess? Then don't cook the noodles! Simple fill up a pan of tap water & place noodles in pan for about 15 min, they will be a little hard to handle, but it will work & when you are all done cooking, they will be perfect. I used red. fat rigotta cheese & red. fat cottage cheese, it was delicious. Added a bit more than a pinch of Italian seasoning for a bit more flavor. The most important part of this is to use FRESH Parm/Romano cheese, it makes the dish. Thanks so much!!

This was so good. My husband loved it and I did too. The only change I made was doubling the sauce. The cheese mixture was perfect and it was totally worth the effort of making. Will definately make again. Thanks so much!

This is very good and easy. I made this twice. the first time was very good. The second time I was trying to lower the fat/calories and change to taste/ I used part skim ricotta and low fat small curd cottage cheese. I also omitted the parsley (i don't like it) and used 1 tsp basil. I used half the mozzarella and 1 crushed garlic glove. Excellent!

These have become a regular at our house, my husband loves them.  The only changes I make are adding fresh basil, 2 cloves of fresh garlic, and about a cup of frozen spinach.  I mix it all in with the cheese stuffing.  Very easy, pretty healthy, and very tasty!

My family really liked this, I used half Ricotta and half cottage cheese, 1 lb. mild Italian sausage which I browned in a skillet with chopped onions and added to the sauce. extra shredded cheese, a package of spinach squeezed as much of the water out that I could and added to the cheese mixture and two jars of spaghetti sauce. Great recipe! It filled two 13 x 9 pans. One to eat and one to freeze.  I'm adding it to my book of favs. Thanks SALLYJUN

My husband says this is the best shell recipe he has ever had.  Only a couple of changes made this to our liking.  I used small curd cottage cheese...added a bag of chopped spinach, and seasoned with more garlic powder, basil and parsley.  Topped with both mozzarella and parmesan.  Covered with foil for the first 20 minutes and then cooked another 20-25 minutes without.  Will definitely be a regular recipe for us.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I like the use of cottage cheese. I used my own marina, layered a ground beef marina the placed the stuffed shells on top of the beef and liberally spooned marinara over. It was a tasty, hearty meal. The leftovers were great too.

Good flavor, but I think I'll stick with ricotta instead of cottage cheese - these were a little bit watery.

These were really good! I sauteed a large sweet onion plus 1 teaspoon of minced garlic in a little olive oil, and added it to the filling -- which I kept the same, aside from doubling the spices. I also doubled the parmesan cheese (fresh-grated) that I sprinkled on top. I will definitely make this again!

I have made this recipe twice first time i made it just about exactly as it says with tips from the helpful reviews like adding ricotta cheese using small curd cottage using fresh herbs and upping the seasoning. well the second time i elimated the cottage cheese all together and upped the parm and moz cheese and used about 2 cups of ricotta seasoned with garlic salt and pepper garlic powder onion powder fresh basial and italian seasoning to taste. no premeasurements just by taste. i seasoned my pasta sauce when its out the jar. i use NO SALT when seasoning the sauce because i salted the cheese mixer. i want it bursting with flavor not salt. i used garlic powder and pepper with some cumin to add a nice smokey kick without the fire. i under cooked my shells just a bit so they wouldnt fall apart while i stuffed using a ziplock bag. used lots of sauce to cover the shells completely and finish them in the oven. i topped it with moz and parm cheese and italian seasoning baked until melted and bubbling about 25- 30 minutes uncovered. came out great with the right balance of flavor. big family hit!

I added two chicken breasts shredded in with cheese mixture and 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 ricotta.  I also used 3 jars of spaghetti sauce (I like lots!)Kept everything else the same.  I had enough filling and shells for 3- 9x13 pans.  Kids really liked it...that in itself deserves the 5 stars.

I use one pound of large curd cottage cheese and one pound of full fat ricotta cheese instead of just cottage cheese and I use basil instead of oregano.  I also use  about twice the sauce (I love sauce).  I use this recipe all the time ... it's definitely a keeper!

This is one of the few dishes that all 5 of my kids AND my husband will eat. My husband and I even fought over the leftovers the next day! He did say he thought it needed some meat (ie ground beef) but I thought it was great as-is.

I used small curd cottage cheese instead of large curd.  I pulled one over on my husband with this recipe, he HATES cottage cheese but I whipped it up enough that he had no qualms, as a matter of fact, he really liked these!

I'm not a big fan of cottage cheese, so I used ricotta instead. It turned out fantastic. My very italian in-laws are still raving about it.

This was the first time I made stuffed shells.  A few tips:  use MUCH more sauce - it needs it.  I used 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese (full fat, large curd).  I tried a ziplock as a pastry bag, but actually found it easier to stuff with a spoon.  And undercook the shells by a few minutes, cool completely, and they should be easier to fill.  Thanks for a yummy recipe.

So Good,  Everyone just loved them!  I got so many compliments..  I used Cottage Cheese, Swiss Cheese, Mozzarella Cheese, Sharp Cheddar Cheese and a Parmesan Riggiano.  Mix all your ingredients in a food processer.  (Your filling will turn out  much creamier)!
Also let your shells cool before stuffing them. (They will not tear as easy).  
Thanks, Karen - Great Recipe!

I liked it  because it was interesting. Cottage cheese instead of Ricotta, for one. The downside is it's vegetarian, no meat. I would suggest adding Italian sausage or other meats to this recipe.

Very yummy recipe! I had left over spinach artichoke dip in the refrigerator that I used about 3/4 cup of and reduce the cottage cheese accordingly. Then used Prego meat flavored sauce. Excellent combination! Tasted a lot like lasagna and my husband loved it :)

I could not stop eating this! My husband who doesn't usually like anything "spaghetti like" (any pasta with sauce) and thinks there HAS to be meat in everything liked it. I used lowfat small curd cottage cheese and Classico brand Fire-roasted tomato & garlic sauce. LOVE IT!

The cottage cheese in place of the ricotta, really makes a difference! Rich and delicious! Will be making again!

Unanimous, 5 stars from the whole crew! I added fresh spinach (as is without cooking 1st) in the filling, which worked fine. To stuff the shells, I used a cookie scoop so I didn't need to toss a plastic bag. This worked well. Was it still a bit messy? Sure, but it really helped. I ran out of filling which may have been my fault as I filled them quite full. Next time I will stick with 1 box of shells which is 12 oz. instead of using 16 oz.. I did as another reviewer suggested and cooked the pasta for 2 1/2 minutes less than the directions. Great idea! The shells held up well during stuffing and were just right when it came time to eat them. I used Kay's Spaghetti and Lasagna Sauce from this site, which I highly recommend especially for those of you missing meat in the dish, as it is in the sauce. My husband suggested I make this the next time we have company over; now that's a good sign!

Easy and delicious!  I also added spinach, more garlic powder, and black pepper, as others recommended.  Using a plastic sealable bag to pipe in the cheese mixture was such a great idea!  I will definitely make this again.

5 stars with the changes, a little bland I think without them. After reading Littlepuffy's review, I followed most of her advice.  I upped spices, 1+tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp parsley, 2 tsp basil, added 1# mild Italian sausage, and 3 large handfuls of fresh chopped spinach (I don't care for the cooked/frozen).  Wonderful!!!  I piped, as suggested, but in the baggie the shredded cheese came in-worked great.  It filled my 9x13 and an 8x8 that I was able to freeze for later.  Our whole family liked it, even the picky ones!

I replaced the cottage cheese with ricotta cheese (I use whole milk, not lowfat which just waters it down).  The dish turned out perfect.  Even my fussy 3 and 6 year old kids loved the stuffed shells!

This was very delicious!  I modified as follows: used half ricotta and half small curd cottage cheese, fresh oregano and fresh parsley, garlic salt instead of powder and cooked the shells partially (about 6min).  I made sure that the sauce covered the shells well and sprinkled the parmeasean and mozzerella over the top.  Covered with foil, baked for 30 minutes, removed the foil and baked an additional 20.  PERFECT!!  Even though this was a meatless dish, my husband loved it!  And, on a side note, I took the advice from another reviewer and put the filling in a zip lock baggie, snipped the edge and piped the filling into the shells.  Very easy and almost no mess!  This will be a great addiditon to our menu rotation  :o)

I have fixed this twice... great recipe!  I made a few minor changes the second time ... added spinach, used italian seasoning instead of the oregano(family preference), added Mozzarella on top.. and followed one reviewers suggestion of covering for 20 mins, then removing the cover for another 20... big difference, didn't dry out. All in all a great meal ... very filling and very tasty! THANKS for sharing!!!!

YUM! 5 stars for inspiration! I used half ricotta & half cottage cheese, one egg instead of two & fresh garlic. I added ground beef to half of the sauce since dh likes meat.  Leftovers were so good & I'm sad it's all gone. I'll be making this one often!

This was absolutely DELICIOUS and incredibly easy.  Spooning the cheese mixture into a zip-loc bag and then cutting the corner of the bag off made squeezing mixture into the shells a cinch and not messy at all.  Everyone loved it!  Served with garlic bread and broccoli.  I will make this again and again!

This was delicious!  It made a lot, but the leftovers were great.  I did what some of the other reviewers did and used half ricotta and half cottage cheese and more sauce. I also put some shredded mozzarella on top before baking.  To keep the shells from sticking and breaking I added a little olive oil to the water. I will make this again.

Awesome!  This recipe will be a regular in our house.  So much easier and tastier than regular lasagna!  Used the tip another member mentioned about putting the cheese mixture in a zip lock baggie and cutting the corner off to fill shells...worked great!  Only change I made from original recipe was to add browned ground chuck to filling mixture.  Italian hubby loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I think it is a great starter recipe that is very flexible as far as changing it to add your own style to it. I added 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese and it made it even cheezier. it went great with a salad and some fresh form the oven garlic bread.

I doubled this reciped for a bridal shower and got a lot of compliments.  Based on other reviews, I used 1/2 small curd cottage cheese and 1/2 ricotta. I also added one package of frozen spinach (for the double recipe), chopped fine and drained, and used extra sauce.  I had a lot of shells that were in bad shape after boiling them, so I would suggest making extra pasta.  Leftovers were great too!

This came out really well.  I made manicotti with this filling.  I did a 50/50 mix on cottage cheese and ricotta cheese as some had suggested.  I added a bit more mozzarella cheese but this was just great.  Well done and will be made again in our household.  

Do yourself a favor and get one of those pastry bags so filing the shells or whatever you use is not so challenging!

Yummylicious! Used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, 1 tsp of garlic powder and salt and 3/4 tsp of pepper and basil. Mixed all of the ingredients together in my KitchenAid and it was nice and smooth. I used 30 oz of fresh marinara sauce instead of spaghetti sauce. Forgive me but I just have to say it - Ciao!

These were the best stuffed shells I've ever had! I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage (just a personal preference) and they were awesome!  I love the tip from another reviewer about "piping" the filling into the shells, that was perfect!

I also ended up with alot of cheese mixture left over, and the final product was just a bit runny. The flavor was good, and my family enjoyed it. I think next time I'll use less cottage cheese and maybe add a little spinch or some Italian sausage. Overall, a good meal!

Absolutely loved it! I used the small curd cottage cheese and covered it with run foil for half of the cooking time. Other than that I did not change a thing! Delicious! The 5 people I served it to also loved it! Make this,

Delicious! I was pretty skeptical about using cottage cheese but decided I would try it anyways. So glad I did! I have always used ricotta but will probably stick with cottage cheese going forward.

I made this and liked it. But instead of 4 cups cottage cheese I did half cottage cheese and half ricotta cheese. It was even better heated the next day.

Delicious!!! The only changes I made was I sautéed half a bag of spinach with about a clove of minced garlic, I added a tsp of garlic powder to cottage cheese mixture..used the small curd cheese and I used the "best marinara sauce" recipe from this site. I also cooked up some lean ground beef and let it simmer in the sauce and that's what I topped it with after I placed the plain sauce on the bottom. My boyfriend who is so picky loved it!!! Don't swap out cottage cheese for ricotta...the cottage cheese is much better!

This was my first go at making any kind of stuffed shells and it was so easy! We only used 3 c. of cottage cheese, added a little more sauce and an extra bag of mozzarella cheese on top. Had no problems stuffing the shells. Just used a spoon while holding the shell open with my other hand. Easy easy easy. Will be making again in just a couple of days and can't wait. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I have used this recipe since I started cooking many years ago with great results.  The only changes I make are using part-skim ricotta instead of cottage cheese, fresh chopped parsley instead of the dried, and I add a pinch of ground nutmeg to the cheese mixture.  I sometimes use my freshly-made marinara sauce (time allowing).  I usually serve these with my homemade meatballs and garlic toast.  Always a family favorite.

So good! I had the perfect amount of filling for the shells, although I did add a small head of broccoli and about 1/3 lb of ground turkey, cooked. I chopped the broccoli in large chunks and steamed for about 9 minutes. In the food processor, I blended the broccoli, turkey, cottage cheese, Mozzarella, and 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese. I had to do half at a time. Meanwhile, the eggs got mixed in the Kitchenaid using the paddle, along with the spices. Then the cheese broccoli mixture was added and it was mixed for 1-2 minutes to incorporate completely. Baked shells for 20 minutes covered, added Mozzarella cheese to top, then 15 minutes uncovered. The Ziploc bag with a clipped corner was a life saver! My kids really liked it (even the one who hates lasagna!) but my husband wasn't overly impressed. He liked it but wasn't super excited about it like the kids and I were. Each of us ended up having 3-4 shells and a couple of pieces of garlic bread (toast with butter and garlic salt). Will be making this again for sure!

wonderful recipe for stuffed shells! great left overs also! i added ricotta cheese to the cottage cheese to get a blend of both cheeses.  i cooked bacon and chopped it up and added it to the cheese mixture. i also added chopped fresh spinach to the cheese and it worked out very well! also cooked up a pound of italian sausage with the sauce. i used more garlic and added mozzarella cheese on top of the parm and baked covered 25 min and uncovered 15 min. after all the changes/additions, it turned out AMAZING! i couldnt stop eating it. it is my new favorite pasta dish!!!

Delicious basic recipe.I made my own sauce instead of jar Prego.big batch...put some in freezer for later this month.I used fresh parsley to give it a zing...and a splash of apple cider vinegar (it's healthy) in the sauce and in the cheese mixture, fresh chopped finely garlic was amazing in the cheese filling!

These were good, and I'll try them again.  I did like the cottage cheese a lot. But it wasn't a 5-star recipe for me, although I think it's a really good base to experiment with!

My grocery store only had a 12oz box of shells which worked fine.  I actually could not fit all of the shells in a 9x13 pan.  I also used a whole Tbsp of garlic powder as someone suggested, and I feel this is too much.  1/2 Tbsp would be better.  I cooked it for 20 mins covered and then 20 minus uncovered.

This recipe is amazing as is!  I LOVE it!  I did not have shells, so I used Manicotti.  I have made it 3 times, sometimes freezing a batch for hectic nights.  I have started making it with sausage/ground beef mixed into the sauce!  Makes it even tastier!

Really good, and very easy!!!  I added a lot more garlic powder and thawed some frozen spinach, and added to mixture.  Next time I think I will add some mozzarella to the top and broil for a minute.

Love this recipe! very delicious, if you cover the shells, they wont dry out. I have found if I add meat, the shells get dryer (idk why). Its a great last minute thing if we forget to thaw meat. I highly recommend it!
I havent tried filling the shells with the ziplock bag, but I love that idea!
The only downfall is my husband is type one diabetic, so i love that this site shows the nutrition facts, but since the cheese is so fatty, its takes a while to digest which is harder on his blood sugar. And lower-fat cheese has more carbs.

I would give this more than five stars if I could!  The whole family loved it.  I did not use jar spaghetti sauce and instead made my own so I'm rating the shells... loved the cottage cheese for a change up in place of ricotta.

Great starting point recipe. Made it with the following changes: half ricotta, half small curd cottage cheese. Added a box of chopped spinach and some spicy Italian sausage. Used chopped garlic and upped the amount to our taste. I needed about a jar and a third of sauce and extra mozz for on top. The ziploc bag filling trick was a godsend. Everyone loved this even the two people who "don't like stuffed shells and/or ricotta cheese"

Husband and the kidlets really liked these shells. I used my last canned "World's Best Pasta Sauce!" for the spaghetti sauce. When canning the sauce, I did add some meatballs using "The Best Meatballs You'll Ever Had." In the future, I would bake these shells for at least 45 minutes.

Only thing that I did differently was to add 1 tsp dried basil.  It was delicious. My husband and I loved it.  I never would of thought to use cottage cheese instead of ricotta, but it was so good! Picky 2 year old wouldn't touch it though.  Maybe next time.  :)

This recipe was a huge hit!! The only changes I made was using small curd cottage cheese instead of large, added a little ricotta, and made it with my homemade spaghetti sauce. I ended up making a double recipe and they were all gone in one day! Thanks for this delicious recipe!

I made the mistake of being in a hurry and NOT pre-cooking the shells.  Big mistakes b/c even after 45 minutes in the oven, they were still hard in spots.  Other then that, I followed the recipe and the taste was good.

Yummy! This recipe ROCKS!  Made with the sauce from "World's Best Lasagna" minus the meat, and homemade garlic bread. Try it! You will NOT regret it.  Made it for 4 and everybody raved about it!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

i am a die hard ricotta fan--would NEVER use cottage cheese in place. BUT--that said, after reading the reviews i felt compelled to try it just once! OMG! very creamy and tasty--one couldn't even tell except for the few curds that didn't melt. VERY GOOD recipe and a must try for all non-believers!

Next time I will use Ricotta instead of cottage cheese and also will use a three-cheese blend from my deli, (Romano, Parmesan, Asiago) instead of all Parmesan.  I also will cook some Italian sausage to mix with the sauce using enough sauce, maybe two jars, to cover the pasta completely so I won’t have to cook it covered with foil.    I don’t think the cheese mixture needed the oregano rather a bit more garlic.

This dish was absolutely delicious! I did not have parsley and so I added basil instead and it still came out nicely. I was a little unsure of the cottage cheese because my Grandmother always used ricotta, but I was highly impressed. I am pretty new to the cooking scene and am starting out slowly, and this was a very easy dish to make!

I always make my Stuffed Shells with cottage cheese.  I prefer the small curd, but using large curd is never a problem.  I mix everything in my kitchenaid .  I do add more mozzarella cheese to the recipe. Personal preference.  I add preground italian spice and a pinch of ground garlic.  The only hint I can give you is if you have a jerkey maker or cookie press use this to fill your shells.  No mess and very easy to use.

I think the readers who suggested switching the cottage cheese for ricotta cheese are totally missing the point of this recipe-- it's stuffed shells WITHOUT ricotta cheese, whether for health reasons, price reasons or taste reasons.  (In my case, my SO doesn't like ricotta cheese.)  Either way, these are SPECTACULAR, and you don't miss a thing using  cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  They freeze (without the sauce) really well too!

These turned out perfect.  The only thing I changed was food processing the cottage cheese so it has more of a ricotta texture.  Other than that, followed directions exactly.  Super!

Yummy! I did make a few changes. I only needed about half the large shells that came in the box. I increased the garlic powder to 1/2 tsp and added a little water to the sauce that I poured on top to make sure it did not get dry. I saved some of the mozzarella and sprinkled on top. And of course, I added spinach to the cheese mix.

Helpful Tip: After draining and rinsing the shells with cold water, I put all of the shells in my salad spinner and spin them dry. Works great every time and does not damage the shells.

I love these shells.  The filling is just right.  Hubby gave it a 4 because he prefers ricotta, but I love cottage cheese.  Side note: the filling was sufficient for half the shells.  Maybe I over-filled?

Great recipe with very minor changes.  I've never cooked with cottage cheese, always used ricotta, and loved this filling.  The filling was much more moist and not as mealy as ricotta.  First, I used manicotti noodles.  Second, the filling recipe is a great place to start, but add more or less of anything to suit your taste.  We added a LOT more garlic.  Next, I took the advice of other reviewers and used a plastic storage bag with the corner cut off to 'pipe' the filling into the noodles.  Just a little mess and so much faster than the spoon method.  Finally, because I added my sauce directly from the can, it was cold.  My cooking time was 20 minutes longer, I believe due to the cold canned sauce.  Next time, I plan to heat my sauce while the noodles are cooking.  Then this will be a tasty and quick dish.  Overall, my family loved it!

I came across this recipies a few years ago on the web before it was posted on here. I changed nothing about the recipie other than sometimes swapping out a different herb for the oregano depending on what i've got at the time. I make it for my co-workers and friends all the time and they all insist I continue making it! Its just so tasty!

DELICIOUS!  This recipe is amazing and pleased both my SUPER picky husband and food striking 20 month old!  Only complaint is that I cooked for 25 minutes like the recipe calls for, and the shells and filling were only luke warm.  I put in for only another five minutes and they became dried out.  Good thing we ate a majority of it before the second cooking!  Next time I would definitely follow a fellow reviewer's advice and cook covered for 20 and then uncovered for 20.  That way the insides are nice and hot and the tops don't get dried out.  Also, I used 3/4 of a HUGE jar (3 lb and some odd ounce jar) of spaghetti sauce rather than just 26 ounces...the 26 ounces didn't cover the shells completely.  Also, don't be afraid to really stuff them up...I used a 9x13 pan and was able to fill up three rows of tightly squished shells (using I would say 4/5's of the box of shells).  I had to go back and add some filling to the beginning shells since I had some leftover!  Next time I won't skimp so much on the filling!  I also added some mozerella to the top and we all sprinkled parmesan over our servings on our plate.  The taste overall was beyond delicious and really SO simple to make...this is only the 8th time I have made dinner in my entire life, so if I can pull it off and think it is easy, anyone can!  :)

Oh my god, these were amazing! I had to scale the recipe down slightly for a 12 oz box of shells, but otherwise, I left everything the same. I prepped the noodles and cheese mixture the day before to minimize prep time, which worked great. I also used the Ziploc bag "loading" method (very easy!) I baked it for 20 minutes with foil and then 15 minutes uncovered. It worked and tasted AMAZING!

This is by far the best Italian Dish I have ever made.  The recipe is very easy to make and every bite of this deliciousness is wonderful.  I put one batch in vodka sauce and the other in regular marinara, both were excellent.  The parsley and oregano made this dish amazing.

Very, very good.  Very, very easy.  My husband said it was almost as good as my lasagna! (which, I have been told is excellent).

My daughter and I had fun scooping up the filling and putting it in the shells with our hands.  You gotta have fun when you cook!  Even if there is a little mess to it!!

This was good, but I think I prefer the texture of ricotta chesse. The cottage cheese makes a thin sauce that seems more like a lasagna than stuffed shells. So, I will make this again, but next time substitute the cottage cheese with ricotta. Overall, pretty good, though.

I made this for Easter and it was quite a hit!   I did feel obligated to substitute ricotta in honor of the holiday and I only used about 8oz of mozzarella (as it was a pre-shredded bag).  After reading all the reviews I added fresh garlic, 1/2 package frozen spinach, fresh basil, fresh parsley and more sauce.  I baked it for 30 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered. As recommended by others I boiled the shells 2.5 minutes less than directed, then plunged them into cold water and let them dry.  I boiled 2 boxes of shells as incidentally, half of them came out of the box broken. Stuffing the shells takes awhile and is a bit messy, but I will certainly make these again!

A good base recipe. I added crushed garlic, chopped baby spinach and plenty of salt and pepper to the cheese mixture (used ricotta instead of cottage). I had leftover spaghetti sauce and used that - it was chunky with plenty of meat, mushrooms, basil, celery red pepper etc and really added zip. I wouldnt use a plain sauce with this.  Topped with plenty of mozzarella cheese. I had no problem spooning the mixture into the shells but I took them out while they were quite firm and let them finish cooking in the oven.

I made this as an extra side dish at Easter...yummy! Everyone loved it, and went back for seconds...there were leftovers of everything else except these shells. Definatly a make again!!
P.S. I substituted Ricotta Cheese for the Cottage, and it came out wonderful!!!

I have been making this recipe for about 20 years and it is always a hit.  It has become one of my personal specialties!!!  My husband always requests it for all his "special" days!  It is really simple and they freeze well.  I've tried a couple of variations but I always return to this same basic recipe!  I am so glad to have found this recipe on here -- my original recipe is so dog eared I was ready to laminate it!!!

This dish turned out great (though I was out of oregano and parsley).  I typically use ricotta in my stuffed shells/manicotti recipes, however I thought I would give this cottage cheese recipe a try and it was a refreshing change.  When I made the recipe, it filled a 10x13 and an 8x8 baking dish.  I used the 26 oz of sauce to coat and cover the 10x13 baking dish, then used an additional 13 oz of sauce to coat and cover the 8x8 baking dish.  I still had noodles left over (but had used all of the cheese mixture).  We will be making this again.

Nope. Lack of flavor. Not great texture. Didn't like the cottage cheese. I used to use a recipe that called for ricotta, breadcrumbs, parsley, and other seasonings. I couldn't find that recipe so used this one. Big mistake, Big, Huge...

Absolutely delicious and really easy to make.  Stuffing shells isn't hard at all! So much better than spaghetti, lasagna, etc.  I did add meat but it would have been just as good without it.

My family loved this.  After reviewing previous reviews, I increased the garlic to 1/2 tsp+, and added spicy Italian sausage that I cooked with my sauce.  I also used 2 cups small curd cottage cheese and 2 cups ricotta.

This recipe was delicious.  I refuse to rate any recipe that I've modified on my own.  I made it as directed and the kids, husband and I all loved it.  Tons of leftovers though.  Will cut the recipe in half next time.

Great but I definitely didn't need that many shells. This recipe accounts for almost 30% tearing it seems. Just be gentle and all shells are usable. Annoying to have a bunch of shells left over when stuffing and space ran out at the same time

I loved it. The only changes I made was upping the garlic powder and parsley both up to 2 tsp. I also added 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef to the spaghetti sauce which also required an extra jar. Instead of the mozzarella, I used an Italian cheese blend as well as topping it on top during the last 10 minutes  of baking.  It made so much that I ran out of room in the 13X9 and had to put the rest in an 8X8.

Loved this recipe. I used ricotta cheese although my family generally loves the cottage cheese in lasagna. I increased the garlic powder (preference). I covered to bake and removed the cover the last 20 minutes. It was amazing. Will make again and again.

I have never eaten cottage cheese before this dish, and when I tried it right before mixing I was really worried. However, all the reviews are dead on - it's delicious. The curds melt away and its a creamy flavorful mixture. Having said that I did double the garlic powder and I added salt and pepper. My husband loved it also and he loves stuffed shells. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of how runny it is which I can only assume is because of the cottage cheese. Ricotta is drier so May do half and half next time just to see if that makes a difference. Will definitely make again.

I did it exact except I used the small chured cottage cheese and added the frozen rinsed and thawed chopped spinach to the mixture and i used my cuisine art food processor and mixed it better.. Using the zip lock bag and cutting the corner to pipe in the shells was easy as well! Suuuuper delicious!

This recipe was amazing.... The only changes I made were using small curd cottage cheese & increasing the garlic powder. I also put the filling in a ziploc Baggie & cut the corner to stuff the shells. My fiancé kept complimenting them also, and he rarely eats a meal without meat. Delicious!

I used fresh chopped spinach instead of frozen, a teaspoon if California garlic powder, and a bit more Parmesan.  I rinsed the shells in cold water after cooking them the minimum amount of time on the package, then turned each one upside down on paper towel to drain.

i was wary about the cottage cheese instead of ricotta, but decided to give it a try.  it was AWESOME.  I blended the filling in the food processor and piped it into the shells so i wouldn't be too reminded it was cottage cheese lol.  i'm sure jarred sauce is fine but the dish can only improve if you make your own.

Made these tonight with Toasted Garlic Bread and they came out well. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and didn't have dried parsley, so I chopped some up--otherwise, followed recipe as stated. Thanks to OP and other reviewers for sharing:)

I only use cottage cheese, for all you die hard ricotta fans,  I now use cottage cheese in my lasagna also.  The small curd cottage cheese give a wonderfully smooth texture and a wonderful taste.  Try it before making substitutions.

This dish came out great but I did change a couple of things the second time around that I really thought made it that much better.

- 1 15oz of ricotta instead of cottage cheese
- added fresh spinach (chopped) into the cheese mix
- 1 egg instead of 2
- added red pepper flakes to the sauce

I cut the recipe in half and used small curd cottage cheese, used 2-3 teaspoons each of basil and parsley and I was generous on the sauce on top (I used a whole 24 oz can of Ragu 7-herb Tomato Pasta Sauce overall). I used a ziplock bag with a dime-sized hole in it to fill the pasta shells. I also covered the top of the pan with aluminum foil, baked for 20 minutes, then took it off and baked for another 20 minutes. It was delicious and afterwards I felt like a happy stuffed Shell(my nickname)!

Easy and delicious.  I added the spinach as others did.  This now a go-to dish for when I have company over.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is great recipe.  Modified as suggested by Littlepuffy (sort reviews and this will come up most helpful).  It did take quite a bit of time to get it all together.

This was a hit, and tasted good. I don't feel like it had anything so awesome about it to give it 5 stars, but it's good enough to make again. Stuffing the shells took a while.

Alright, so I've made this recipe once already and I LOVED it. My husband is a total carnivore, I am planning on making these tonight or tomorrow for dinner and I will add some hamburger or chopped chicken breast to half of the cheese mixture. I always use a different amount of spices to everything I cook but I am sure I will be using fresh garlic, and at least quadrupling it. Oregano, parsley, and basil are regulars in all of my cooking too. My mother used to cook this for my family when I was younger and it would take her such a long time to fill the shells with a spoon. I did use the advice of others and used a Ziploc gallon sized baggie. This TOTALLY helped I couldn't imagine NOT using this. Super helpful. I did add extra sauce to the shells and it was yummy but it made for adding more shells to the pan harder. I think this time I'll add the regular amount of sauce and then cook more on the side to add later. Overall, I think this recipe is just as good as my mother's is, GREAT JOB! This is an excellent recipe! Thank you for sharing it with us!

Delicious. My whole family loved it. I used the fresh herbs instead of the dried. Just my prefaced.  I used the small curd cottage cheese, but will try lg curd next time to see the difference. I baked it covered for 20 minutes and 15 minutes uncovered as suggested and it came out perfect. This is a keeper as my husband would say.

This is definitely a family favorite - even my 2 year old loved it! I followed what was suggested in the review by "LITTLEPUFFY" and added spinach and used small curd cottage cheese. I ended up cooking half the shells for dinner and froze the other half. Thanks so much!

Tastes good but too runny. I followed the recipe, added diced tomoatos to make it pretty and ad a little flavor. I was not majorly impressed with this recipe, but might try it again adding spinach, mushrooms or onions and do ricota cheese instead of cottage cheese.

Delicious! Used fresh basil & parsley, added frozen spinach, thawed & drained, and pureed in food processor as suggested by others. My kids enjoyed helping make them, and then eating them afterward.

I usually don't like stuffed shells but I thought it might be because they were always stuffed with so much meat. I found this recipe and now I am in LOVE! They were so good! The only change I made was to mix 2 C small curd and 2 C large curd. I used one full fat and one 2%....it turned out GREAT! I also added about 1/2 lbs of ground turkey to my sauce. I will never use another recipe!

This recipe was excellent.  I followed a few of the suggestions and under-cooked the shells per the box directions by 2 1/2 min.  I also added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder instead of the pinch and 2 teaspoons of dried parsely (instead of the 1) as well as 2 teaspoons of dried basil.  I added 1 package of frozen chopped spinach.  This added nice color without the spinach taste.  I tried the dish with small curd cottage cheese, ricotta cheese and a small curd cottage / ricotta mixture - so I had 3 different varieties of shells.  I have to say that I prefer the ricotta over the other 2; however the mix was also tasty.  I made a meat sauce for my husband, which he enjoyed.   Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Loved it! My kids (who are super picky) loved it! It's very forgiving, as I used ricotta instead of cottage 'cause that's all I had. I don't like garlic powder, so I left it out. Didn't have parsley, but had dried basil.  Key to yumminess: blend filling in cuisenart!

This is sooo good and my whole family gobbles them up without a single complaint! That's saying alot for 4 kids aged 6 and under!  I had a friend make this recipe and use ricotta instead of cottage cheese and she said it turned out superb! Can't wait to try that next time.

I used ricotta in place of the cottage cheese, and the filling was delicious. My only complaint was that I felt like the grated Parmesan cheese didn't melt in the filling, and it took away some of the smoothness. I'd leave it out next time. I used a 6-blend cheese (8 oz bag) and put the extra 2 oz on top in place of the parmesan. This is a good recipe for shells for someone who doesn't like spinach inside the filling.

Yum yum!! Is all I can say! First of all I gave this recipe 4 stars because I made  some changes.. I put maybe 3 cups of part skim ricotta cheese, 1/3 of a small block of part skim mozzarella, a good sprinkling of Parmesan, 6 cloves of FRESH GARLIC, 1 box of thawed and drained frozen spinach, sprinkling of dried oregano, salt and pepper and two eggs (I put a second one in at the last min and it works perfectly) all into a blender and blended until smooth.  Poured it all into a ziplic bag and snipped the bottom corner off, then piped into each shell (I cooked the shells al dente) and placed each shell straight into the baking dish which had about 1/2 of my sauce in the bottom, once all the shells are done and you are covered in a messy green mixture! Pour the rest of the sauce on top and sprinkle with Parmesan and mozzarella.. My sauce makes the dish that much better two ;o) whether you make a sauce from scratch or you mix a jar of vodka sauce with a can of crushed tomatoes like I did one time just make sure you slice up a large piece of chorizo or similar sausage, sauté it for a few mins then add your sauce, seriously it goes so well with the dish.. One guest even used the word 'exquisite'! I'm making it again tonight for my Italian father in law! Fingers crossed :oD

Great stuffed shells recipe!  The second time I made these I added about a tablespoon of garlic salt and ran the mixture through my food processor.  The shells are easier to stuff when they're cooked just enough to separate, about 6-7 minutes.  Definitely a keeper!

These are easy and delicious! I made them for my father-in-law and he said this is now his favorite dinner I have ever made for him! The only thing I did differently was to use fresh parsley as I had some on hand. I also divided this into two smaller pans and froze one. A month later it was still delicious! The frozen pan I baked covered at 350 for about 45+min (until warmed through) then an additional 10 minutes uncovered. You'd never have guessed they had been frozen!

Wonderful recipe.  I used fat-free cottage cheese, part skim mozzarella, and Ragu no sugar added tomato basil sauce and it made this dish a healthy choice.  Add chopped spinach if desired.

I did not like this at all.  I made it exactly according to directions.  I think the amount of parmesean is way too much.  Mixing the cheese in the sauce gave it a strange flavor.  Unfortunately we threw it all away.  A lot of wasted time and money.

Delicious and easy!  I made it the first time w/cottage cheese, but it just didn't taste quite right.  Made it the second time around w/ricotta, and it was perfect.  This recipe's a keeper!!!

These are pretty good, but I'm not crazy about the cottage cheese and neither is my husband. Will try them again with Ricotta or half and half.

The only reason I could not give this recipe 5 stars is that I found it a bit messy.  I read many reviews and took the advice to fill the shells with a plastic bag. Maybe it is just me, but I made a mess!   BUT, it was delicious!  I did add a touch of crushed garlic and Italian herbs to the filling. I will be making this again BUT not something that is an everyday meal! Definately a weekend or company meal.

These were delicious.  I made them for company, and everyone raved.  Putting the filling into ziploc bags was genius and a big time/mess saver!

My daughter made this dish, as is, and it was wonderful. We had to buy two 12 ounce packages of shells to get the extra 4 ounces called for and had quite a few cooked shells left over that she couldn't fill. One 12 ounce package would have done nicely.

This was very good.  I followed the recipe to a T and really enjoyed it.  My picky husband enjoyed it as well!  The filling was just right and the whole thing was easy to make.  I like the idea of using a plastic baggie with the corner cut out to fill.  UPDATE - since there are just two of us, I froze about half of the shells.  We have made them twice - once thawing first, once without - and they turned out great!

Okay, okay - I made this with homemade ricotta (using sunflower17's Homemade Fresh Cheese recipe from allrecipes.com) and with homemade tomato sauce - BUT - the rest of the seasonings, cook time, etc. worked wonderfully - this was my first go-around with stuffed shells, and I just stuffed them with my hands. Cook the shells VERY al dente (my package said to cook for 14-15 minutes, and I cooked for 7) and you won't have any problems stuffing them at all. A great recipe - I think it would have been great with jarred sauce, too, but just felt like going the homemade route this time. Thanks!

Good recipe!  I don't care for ricotta cheese, so this was a good recipe for an alternative.  I also added 1 lb. of hamburger to sauce.

This was a hit with my family.  I did make a few adjustments though, I added a pound of cooked and crumbled italian sausage in with the cheeses.  And for the sauce I combined 3/4 jar of spaghetti sauce with 1 jar of alfredo sauce to make a nice rose sauce, it was absolutely wonderful and everyone gobbled it up.  Yumm!!!

i followed recipe exactly,only added extra garlic (we're a garlic family) and used small curd cottage cheese (that was all i could find).when mixing the ingrediants i didn't have time to to get the food processer out so i used my handy little mix master, also i made the mixture ahead of time and let it sit a few hours. this was by far the best stuffed shells i've ever had.will definately make again.

This was really good! I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, and used the ziplock bag method of filling the shells. Thanks for a great recipe!

I give this 5 stars because I thought it was delicious and very easy to make.  I cut the recipe in half and still had an entire pan of shells, the full recipe would feed an army!  I added 1/4 cup of sour cream to the filling.  I used a ziploc bag to stuff the shells.  I baked at 350 for about 32 minutes - next time, it could probably use 35-40 minutes in the oven.  Also, I think I will add 1 cup of spinach to the filling next time to give this dish a little more nutritional value.

This was pretty good. The cottage cheese made it a little too salty. This recipe made a lot and I froze the majority of it. I might add just a bit more garlic powder to off set the saltiness next time.

This makes a lot!  I made 1/2 of the recipe's cheese mixture to start - froze half of it for later use - and made the rest into a 9x9 pan.  I still used a full 26 ounce jar of sauce, used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and put extra mozzarella on top.  Turned out great!

Awesome. My four year old told me this was the best meal I ever made. I reduce one egg and add the basil as well. I also add browned beef to the sauce and have constantly had to add extra sauce. I have made it the last three times mixing in ricotta  cheese with the cottage....kind of a 2/3 cottage 1/3 ricotta. This is phenomenal though. Very easy and delicious.

Loved it!  The only thing I changed was I cooked hot italian sausage then mixed it with the sauce.  I always cooked my shells open side down - but liked them better open side up!  Great recipe!

This is a great meatless option.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was very flavorful.  I did read one review that suggested not precooking the shells and I would advise that you DO precook them.  Otherwise the shells break too easily while you are trying to stuff them.

I followed some of the suggestions for other reviewers and added some of my own and this was fantastic!  I used half ricotta and half cottage cheese.  i only made half a recipe and it stuffed 15 shells very full.  I also used 1t of garlic power, basil, oregano and parsley.   I also just put the sauce in the bottom of the pan and used mozzarella and Parmesan on top to make a cheesy crust.  We couldn't stop eating it and my son even ate it.  I am going to make this again for sure!

This recipe was great. I did make a few changes the second time and really like them. I added only 3 cups of cottage cheese and added 1-2 cups ricotta cheese. I also added a bit of Italian seasoning to punch up the taste. Last, I added 1-2 cups spinach to the cheese mixture (I used frozen, thawed and squeezed.)My husband loves this and can't get enough. Will make again!

Great recipe. I also changed it a bit. Using half ricotta/cottage cheese and cut the recipe in half (still too much food). I even forgot to put the egg in, but it was still really good. My husband liked it alot.

This was great! I made a few changes per some reviews I read and what I had on hand. I subbed ricotta cheese for cottage cheese; used dried herbs (about 1 t. of each) instead of fresh and used more mozz cheese. I also added a box of spinach, thawed and drained well to the cheese mixture. Also, I added about 1/4 t. nutmeg to compliment the ricotta. Per other reviews, I cooked the pasta a little less and put them in a cold bath after draining them. I may not do this next time because they were a little tough. Also, per other reviews, I covered w/foil for 20 min of baking and then uncovered for another 20 min. You definitely need a pan larger than 13x9 or 2 pans b/c it makes a lot. I'm thinking I will freeze half of the cheese mixture next time to make it again later (then I just have to cook shells, assemble and bake). It makes a ton for 2 people (we ate it for 4-5 days!!). Also, I didn't need to use a bag to pipe it into the shells as others suggested. It was pretty easy to use a spoon to fill the shells. I'm not usually into vegetarian meals but this one was very filling. This is better than my mom's version of stuffed shells (w/meat and bread crumbs!) b/c it is more saucy. Good for company!

I used this as the foundation for my own recipe which turned out fantastic! I made w/ ricotta instead of cottage cheese and added about a tsp of minced garlic, italian seasonings, fresh parmesean, mozzarella, and provolone. I alos used egg beaters instead of the egg and maybe 1/4 tsp salt, little pepper. Oh and I can't forget that instead of spinach I mixed in about 1/2 c basil pesto. My kids absolutely loved it!! I had some refrigerated pizza crust so I rolled that out and topped w/ butter, seasonings, a little minced garlic and parmesean cheese as well and cut into strips when it was done for  "homemade" breadsticks. It was really good! Enjoy!

This dish received rave reviews and requests to make again and for company.  The only changes I made were to increase the garlic powder to 1T, use 1/2 part-skim ricotta and 1/2 low-fat cottage cheese, and I used 1 1/2 jars of spaghetti sauce since we like the extra sauce.  This also kept the leftovers from drying out.  Definitely will be making again and again!

This was a fantastic recipe.  I did put the mix into gallon size bags to pipe in.  That was extremely easy!  A little time consuming but worth it!

Very good.  I only used a 12 oz. package of shells (didn't find the 16 oz. package).  It had about 35 shells in it, which was still plenty to serve eight.  The cheese filling was just enough.  Serves up prettier than manicotti.

I love this recipe!! I couldn't put the shells down! I halved the recipe and still had extra cheese mixes left. I made modifications: I used ricotta cheese instead cottage cheese. I used frozen spinach (thawed AND squeezed dry!!) instead of mushrooms. I used a whole jar instead of just half. Definitely necessary! 

I think the sauce is extremely important. I used my favorite chunky spicy sauce, threw in some jarred jalopenos (boyfriend is a fiend) and topped with shredded mozzarella cheese instead of parmesean. 

My boyfriend and I loved these. With modifications, one of the best recipes. I will DEFINITELY make this again.

These were delicious.  I used fat free small curd  cottage cheese. (it was all I had)  I also used shredded monterey jack and shredded swiss instead of mozzarella.  I will be making these again soon.

Made these for my husband for Father's Day yesterday.  Although I am not a pasta person, I found these to be delicious and so did he and my son.  But my goodness it made quite a big batch. So, we're looking forward to the leftovers.  Hint:  I used a cake decorater tube to fill the shells (I use this also when making deviled eggs).  What a time saver!

These were very good. Half of the batch I made without change, other than using 2 cups ricotta. I added spinach and mushroom to the second half...just threw it in the food processor. Both varieties were yummy. The recipe made 2 pans worth of shells and I still had some filling left over.

very good and very filling. because the cheese can be too much, adding sausage to the spaghetti sauce helps bring in other flavors and texture. also, took the advise of others and used more sauce. overall, excellent recepie and will definatly make again.

Wonderful meal!  I used half the cottage cheese and substituted the other half with Ricotta as suggested by others.  I also added a package of thawed and squeezed chopped spinach for a healthy boost.  My children (3 & 4) and husband couldn't get enough!

I am a beginner cook and chose this recipe based on it's simplicity. I was a bit weary that unlike many of the other "Stuffed Shell" recipes, this one called for Cottage, rather than Ricotta cheese. I made the recipe last night and as I guessed, it was incredibly simple and quick to make, even for a novice like myself. The cottage cheese was a delicious and lower-fat alternative to Ricotta and added an unexpected flavor. I will definitely keep this one in my recipe box!! Excellent!

This was really good. I used a 50/50 mixture of ricotta and cottage cheese. I used an Italian spice mixture instead of the suggested spices and doubled the amount.  I also put in some spicy Italian sausage - delicious!  As suggested by others I ran all the filling ingredients through my food processor and the results were fantastic.  It was very creamy and easier to stuff shells.  I also adjusted the cooking of my shells per another reviewers suggestion and that really helped make the shells easier to fill.  Definitely will be making this recipe again.

We loved this and its fairly easy to prepare.  Added lots more fresh, minced garlic and some defrosted, squeezed-dry spinach to half the filling as I love that addition.  Will make often!

Loved this, is even better next day.  I followed others comments and used manicotti instead.  Is easier to stuff if you take a plastic baggie and cut tip off and use like a pastry bag.  I also added spinach and a few sun dried tomatoes (not the kind in oil).  Used others idea of substituting half ricotta for cottage, came out great.  It does need more spices. Would suggest cutting recipe in half if you only have one jar of spaghetti, that came out perfect.

Awesome recipe.  My family are meat eaters so I added 2 lbs ground beef to the sauce and made a double batch. I also used small curd cottage cheese and some ricotta too. I will be making this again real soon.

I really liked this recipe, we had so much leftover.  I substituted half of the cottage for ricotta, and kept the rest of the cottage cheese.  It was a big hit with our dinner guests!

These were delicious but my husband wanted to know where the meat was. (You've never met such a carnivore. haha!) Next time I'll probably add some browned ground beef to the mixture. Also...am I crazy, why did they come out of the oven so runny? (I made certain not to overcook the pasta shells, so I don't think it was from that.) The next day everything had set up, and tastes much better. Would adding an extra egg help everything set up better?

This was so good, and not that hard to make. It was actually fun stuffing all the shells. This was delicious and I can't wait to make it again.

This recipe was wonderful. I did some things differently. The main thing i changed was the amount of spices. I used more of everything because i love a lot of flavor. Also, i used to jars of sauce but added basil, parsley, oregano, onion salt, and garlic powder to give it a more robust taste. I also browned some 92% lean hamburger and added that to my sauce. I also sprinkle the aboce spices on the beef and added grilled onions.
  I loved the taste of this recipe. OOOO I SUBSTITUTED THE COTTAGE CHEESE FOR RICATTA!!!
  But i found that there was not nearly enough filling to use all the shells i had cooked. Next time i will definatly have to double the recipe. Also, i will add beef in with the fillings as well.

I made an extremely similar dish from Taste of Home and it was very good.  I used fresh parsely and low fat cottage cheese and I can't wait to make it again.  I think I overcooked the shells.  They go from hard to floppy pretty quickly.  This is a great potluck dish.  I used the new tomato sauce with the meat already in it so it was very easy to even make it a meaty dish.  
It is a lot easier than it seems.

Big hit with my boyfriend!  We have tons of leftovers-even great the next day!  I used Ricotta and added extra Italian seasoning and garlic.  With half of the shells I used a package of frozen spinach-which was also a hit.  I could have used an extra half jar of sauce too.

Great recipe!  Great idea to use a ziplock bag to pipe the cheese mixture into the shells.  I just made the stuffed shells and froze them for later meal.

I loved this recipe.  My picky 3 year old loved this recipe. This is a winner. Made my own spaghetti sauce instead of jar. I suggest checking allrecipes for a quick spaghetti sauce recipe for another element of yum. I did have a ton of cheese stuffing leftover, but I just quick cooked up some lasagna noodles and spread the cheese on em, then threw em in the freezer for another day. Whatever haha. I will be making this probably 100 more times, only with a little less cheese mix ;)

So good!! I made this and added fresh chopped spinach and a little more seasoning and black pepper and basil to the stuffing and it was delicious! It made two pans of stuffed shells and I didn’t have enough pasta sauce so it was a little dry so next time I will get double sauce so I have enough. Other than that it was perfect!!

I will never go back to the traditional way of using ricotta cheese - cottage cheese is SO much better (even if you aren’t a fan of it). I have made this recipe half a dozen times now and it’s fail proof. I usually add extra mozzarella/Parmesan on top and broil until bubbly towards the end of baking. I’ve made it with added spinach before as well as meat sauce - there are lots of ways to mix it up. I usually freeze half of it because it makes such a large amount. 5 stars!

Delicious and wonderful. Nice to pair with garlic bread and a salad. I have made this before and I made it tonight. Totally love it. Recommendation; try using a 12oz box instead of a 16oz box of the jumbo shells.

This is always a good dish to serve, but I did make a couple of changes, as others have mentioned.  I added 1 tsp. minced garlic from a jar and added frozen, drained spinach to the cheese mixture.  The end result is a crowd pleaser!

This recipe was a dream recipe for me, I had just "put up" 2 dozen quarts of Marinara Sauce.  The tomatoes were great in my garden this year, so was the spinach so that went into this dish also (just a half a cup prepared).  What a yummy dish, easy to fix too!

a little trick I use for stuffing is to use an ice cream scoop as long as it's not a large one. it makes it much easier

I added fresh chopped spinach to the mixture, and covered with extra sauce, mixed with pesto, sugar, and spices, (oregano, thyme, basil, and garlic salt).  Also, I only soaked the shells in water while stuffing them.  The family liked this dish!..

I really liked this recipe. Everybody ate it, including my picky eater! Yay! 
I only added one ingredient- 1.5 tsp Italian Seasoning to the cheese mixture. 
This was my first time making stuffed shells, so I would add to the instructions to fill the shells so that the filling is within the shell and not bulging out so that there is enough filling to fill all the shells.

Really enjoyed this! When I made this I decided to make a cheese blend for the inside--with the cottage cheese/egg mixture I grated parmesan, mozzarella, asiago, and aged white cheddar (eyeballing the proportions). Absolutely yum. I followed the advice of the top comment and baked at 350, 20 minutes covered w/foil, 20 minutes without, and then turned up the heat to about 450 in the last few minutes to try and brown some of the cheese. I also took a paper towel with some olive oil to the glass pan beforehand just to make scooping easier (might be unnecessary given the pan is covered with sauce). Rinsing the pasta well w/cold water also helped keep it from being too mushy. Would definitely like to add sausage or chicken bits to the inside next time :) Great recipe to build off of.

A bit bland.   I used quite a bit more garlic powder and doubled the herbs and I think it could use more.

Used 3c large curd cottage cheese because that's the volume in the carton I bought. I also added 1lb sweet italian sausage that I browned first. Loved the flavor but the texture was very loose, so next time I'd drain the cottage cheese. Easy to make and definitely worth repeating with this slight adjustment.

The cheese was great, but I undercooked the shells slightly. There were too many shells, so I had to make a bowl of pasta. It was overall great and I do plan on making it again.

This is the third time we’ve made this dish and every single time it ended up great. Like many others, I absolutely think cottage cheese is disgusting, but yet somehow in this dish it taste so so good. I’ve done with ricota cheese as well but I would have to say the cottage cheese is definitely better. I liked it with the spinach as well, and tonight I decided to go with a 50-50 mix on the cottage cheese and ricotta. Absolutely beautiful.??

Yes, I added my ground beef, sausage,onion to the cheese mix
 to give a protein boost. I made marinara enough for three other dishes and didn't want meat for next mix. Talk about kiss the cook! I love All Recipes...never let me down.

My family loves  this recipe. It makes 2-9x13 casserole dishes stuffed shells, (not sauce) but I freeze half the stuffed shells for another day. I also mix cottage cheese, egg, garlic and fresh spinach in processor. I'd add cheese too but it won't all fit in mine!

This was pretty good: I added quite a few things (spinach, mushrooms, onion, leftover ricotta cheese and sour cream, fresh parsley, diced ham, half a teaspoon salt, red pepper flakes) and omitted the parm cheese. Over half an hour wasn't enough to zap the insides, though-- had to finish it out in the microwave.

I thought these were tasty and pretty easy.  I added about a pound of sweet Italian sausage (half in the cheese mixture and half in the sauce) because my husband considers it a snack if meat isn’t involved.  My toddler also about quadrupled the oregano :).  I used our favorite, Classico fire-roasted tomato & garlic sauce.

I made this exactly to the recipe HOWEVER my Jumbo Pasta Noodles did NOT become jumbo, they remained the side of small shells???  I don't know why.  So, I just put in a layer of the delicious cheese mixture, a layer of my own All Recipe spaghetti sauce and a later of the sad small noodles, it was very good, but I am sure it would have been better if the noodles had puffed up!!  I will try it again though!!!

I loved this recipe.  I prefer small curd cottage cheese over large curd or ricotta and it is an easy swap to fit your taste.  I added baby spinach which I wilted with some of the pasta water and squeezed out the extra water with cheesecloth.  I happened to have roasted garlic on hand that needed a job so I chopped it up and added it to the cheese mixture.  I flash froze the stuffed shells and then packed them airtight with my foodsaver.  The frozen ones tasted like I had just made them. I would definitely recommend this freezer friendly dish.

These turned out great! I added half a package of veggie ground round to the cheese mixture to add some protein and substance.
I'll definitely make these again. My kids loved them, and we had plenty of leftovers.

Mr. Wonderful told me that it was a 'keeper' recipe - as good as any Italian Restaurant in Cicero, IL.
 The only change I made was to use  "Veggie Bits" instead of ground beef - so my vegetarian friends could enjoy it.

I give this exact recipe 3 stars.  This needs some heavy modifications.  It was bland and very forgettable. And after 40 min it still wasn't hot enough. 

I'd read the reviews first and make their suggested changes.

Made half the recipe, but used the spices in the quantities as written and added 1 tsp Italian Seasoning and 1 tsp basil.  Was able to squeeze 20 fully stuffed shells into an 11”x7” Casserole dish.  It was a perfect amount of filling.  Baked 25 minutes in a 350F convection oven with out covering.  Using low moisture part skim mozzarella and 1% milk fat cottage cheese made these about 110 calories each.  Great heated up the next day.  Will make this again.

I loved this recipe! I noticed that it made a little bit more than i expected, i had to use two pans. I did use a whole pound of meat and a few ounces extra of all of the cheeses combined, so that does make sense, but it felt like a lot of food. They make great leftovers! It was messy, but i’m definitely going to make this meal again.

Omgsh! So so good. I’ve never tried stuffed shells before but glad this was my first try. I was turned off at the thought of cottage cheese but so glad I did it anyway. Such a great flavor. I followed the recipe exactly. Had to use 2 pans cause I didn’t have one big enough. I think a 12 oz box of pasta shells would’ve sufficed as I had leftover cooked pasta. My young kids were easily able to help me with the recipe. And they LOVED it and can be so picky so this was for sure a winner. We all went back for seconds.

I couldn't find pasta shells so used manicotti instead with the same filling. My guests loved it, but I found it a little bland. Would add more greens/herbs next time!

Yummy! I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Added dried basil and completely forgot about the eggs. It still turned out awesome! Whole family loved it.

Love this recipe! Used small curd cottage cheese instead of the large though. First time making stuffed shells and I'm very happy with how they turned out. Will be saving this recipe for future use.

I always use ricotta cheese and I spread a homemade ground beef spaghetti sauce over shells. Was tasty with a homemade Italian meatball, garlic bread, and a nice salad.

Yummy and simple. I also used a small ice cream scoop to fill the shells and it was much easier that piping it. I didn't have enough sauce so I also used a can of stewed tomatoes which my family loves. I added Italian seasoning too.I will make this again!

This was really good and easy to make. I use a ziplock bag to stuff the shells. Just fill bag with your cheese/spinach mixture and cut off  one of the corners :)

So delicious!  I used half cottage cheese and half ricotta, increased to 1/2  tsp garlic powder, added fresh chopped spinach and freshly grated parmesan. I browned 1 pound ground beef / 1 pound Italian sausage and added to the sauce then spooned it over the stuffed shells (husband is such a carnivore).  I topped it with more mozzarella and fresh parmesan when it was done.  This filled a large deep dish pizza pan .  It turned out great!

It was good. I prefer ricotta over cottage. I used a mini cookie dough scoop to fill shells..very easy, and less messy. I covered with foil while baking until last 5 minutes.

I thought it was really good! It made great leftovers as well! I personally didn't add as much cottage cheese! You can very how much of the ingredients depending how much filling you put in each shell.

I subbed in ricotta for the cottage cheese and left out the egg.  I added sausage meatballs to the dish and it was a hit.  I will make these again, easy peasy once the shells are stuffed.

Easy and delicious! I substituted 2 cups of ricotta cheese for 2 of the cups of cottage cheese.  I also added 3/4 t of basil and saved some of the mozarella to sprikle on top.

Great recipe, a little time consuming but worth it. I've tried it with the large and small curd cottage cheese, I personally like the small. I feel like it all blends together better with the small. We will enjoy this meal many more times!

This was delicious, everyone enjoyed it. It took a little longer to get into the oven then it said but that was probably because I was refereeing 3 kids at the same time. :) Wasn't sure about the cottage cheese, (usually use ricotta) but it was great and I used the low fat, small curd and blended everything up. We will definitely do this again. Thanks!

EXCELLENT RECIPE! I've not used cottage cheese in a recipe like this but I found I prefer it to the heavy Ricotta I used to use. This is my new favorite.

This is an excellent recipe that you can adapt (season/add spinach, etc.) to meet your own tastes. The best tip I picked up from another reviewer was to cut short the boil time on the shells, making them easier to stuff (and I did use the ziploc method), and they cooked up perfectly just the same. My husband LOVED this meatless meal. Also it made a ton of leftovers (there are just two of us)!

Absolutely delicious! I added a package of spinach and it was the perfect amount for the number of shells that come in the box.

My family loved this recipe. I added fresh spinach sauteed with butter to the mix but otherwise kept it the same. I will definitely make this again.

With the exception of not measuring the seasonings, I made exactly as directed. They were fairly quick and easy and my six year old lasagna lover was apprehensive about trying them but ended up asking for seconds and choose to take leftover shells for lunch versus her favorite pizza!! Thanks for the recipe!

I made it in a cake pan. There were enough shells and filling to make two 9x13 cake pans. You will need another jar of spaghetti sauce. My husband asked me to add ground beef next time.

I am not Italian but I love my pasta and tomato dishes. Ignore any bad reviews about this dish. I was a little hesitant on using cottage cheese instead of ricotta but it was absolutely great. I did add a little Italian seasoning to the mixture, and I did precook the shells as indicated on the box. I had no problem with the shells breaking or tearing. I used Ragu marinara. This is a dish I will wear my wife out on. I cut the recipe in half for just two people. It made 18 shells. I see many find stuffing the shells as a big job. I started stuffing using a spoon but switched over to using my clean hands. It was very easy when done by hand.

Just in time for LENT. This was fantastic, I could've eaten the whole pan myself. My son, NOT A BIG CHEESE PERSON, and I forgot, thought they were OK.  Next time I will make a meat sauce for the carnivore, he still ate six.

I added 1 finely diced onion and 1 pkg baby spinach trimmed...
melded the onion and baby spinach in cooking oil until the spinach wilted and added to the other ingredients.
It got great reviews from my family.

I added ground sirloin to the sauce.  I wasn't fond of the idea of it without it.  Quite bland.  Most oftentimes I read the reviews of others before trying...bypassed this part this time and won't do that again.  I like to add some of the others suggestions to help spice things up.  Will try again but with adding the spinach for one and more seasonings.

Used ricotta cheese instead of cottage. Came out very good. It's a keeper with a few tweeks will be great. Thinking of adding a little Italian sausage next time.

We absolutely loved this!  I tried to follow the recipe very closely, but they didn't have large curd cottage cheese at the store, so we used small curd.  Also, for seasoning I used an Italian blend we have on hand and I was quite generous with it. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

My husband hates pasta. That said, he said this  was the best pasta dish he ever ate. I followed recipe with a few exceptions. I would use 1 tsp. Garlic powder for a whole recipe. I halved the recipe and used a 9x9 glass pan. Definitely purée the filling. Easy to pipe in from a plastic baggie with dime-sized hole cut in a corner.  Placed remainder in freezer for another quick meal.

As written I gave it a 4.  Very good tasting, but I prefer using ricotta cheese in any Italian food you stuff.  It's much firmer, and has more flavor than plain cottage cheese.  If you are going to use cottage cheese, turn it upside down on a paper towel covered plate to drain, or let sit in a strainer for 15 minutes or so.  Another hint an old Italian lady told me, is to use just a slight dash of cinnamon in your filling, a little garlic always helps, and always add mozzarella or provolone to the top of any dish, before you bake it.  Give ricotta cheese a try, you'll be glad you did

I used 2 cups of ricotta and 2 cups of cottage.  1 jar of sauce, and mixed together about 1/3 Panko crispy bread crumbs, 1/3 cup shredded parmesan, and 2 tbsp salted butter.  Mixed and sprinkled on top before baking.
Fantastic!

This was delicious! The only thing I changed was I used maybe 1/2 a small tub of cottage cheese (small curds). My family is not big on ricotta fillings. But this gave it just enough. Everything else was perfect!

I put ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  It was EXCELLENT!!!  

The only thing is that it took 45 minutes prep time from start to finish.  But, all in all totally worth the effort. Would definitely make this again.

I should thank Siri, too.  I asked her how to make stuffed shells and this was on the top of the list.

I added diced mushrooms, 1/2 lb of ground beef, and 1/2 of ground sausage to the filling. Delicious! Family gobbled it up.

Very easy to make!! I was looking for a basic recipe for stuffed shells that I could change to my tastes. I used small curd cottage cheese (just two cups), feta cheese crumbles, mozzarella, and shaved Parmesan for the cheese mixture. I added garlic powder (considerably more than the recipe, about 1 1/2 tsp), 2 tsp oregano, 2 tsp basil, pinch of rosemary, pinch of thyme, salt to taste, black pepper. I didn't use egg as my mixture already stayed together well. Then I stirred it together and let it sit in the fridge while I made my homemade sauce. Also added mozzarella to the top. Very delicious.

I only had three cups of cottage cheese, so I added another egg and lots of extra mozzarella. I also used small curd cottage cheese and more sauce than the recipe asked for (2 28 oz jars). I needed the big pan, plus an 8*8 glass dish for all the shells. It turned out great though. Everyone loved it.

Pretty solid recipe. I did end up adding a half a pound of Italian sausage in a half a pound of ground beef to the sauce. My family and I love meat with our pasta. I tried one tray with ricotta and one tray with cottage cheese and we actually prefer the cottage cheese. I will definitely make this again.

I thought this recipe was a bit bland for our taste. It was good, but nothing to write home about.  I used the cottage cheese and it seemed all I tasted was the curds of cottage cheese. I would much prefer ricotta. the recipe called for 16 oz box of jumbo shells. Our supermarket only carried the 12 oz box. I'm glad they did. The 12 oz box actually filled two 9x12 baking dishes. Homemade sauce to me would be better. I also think fresh parsley or basil would improve this recipe. That being said, this is a great recipe if you like Sandra Lee type cooking.

I had not made stuffed shells in a long  time so decided to use  recipe.  I thought the recipe was very good.  I used minced garlic instead of powder   and made homemade meat sauce to go with it.  My husband loved the finished dish.

AWESOME, loved this, couldn't find any big curds so i used the regular ones. Took the advice of others and cut a corner in a ziplock bag, awesome idea!
I pureed an orange pepper, onion and mushrooms, added that to the spaghetti sauce. I also used a heaping teaspoon of the dry spices and changed the garlic powder to the stuff from a  tube and put in two teaspoons of that and added cracked pepper ...  i used a handheld blender to blend the cheese ingredients together... love this.. i will definitely make this over and over and over again!!

Excellent! with some changes..  used ricotta instead of cottage and added spinach to the filling.  Used cooked lasagna noodle (cut in half) and scooped a good hunk onto each one and rolled it up.  Also used my homemade tomato sauce and it was devine.  When I warmed it up work my colleagues smelled it and were bummed I didn't bring enough to share.  Next time!!

Substituted ricotta cheese for half of the cottage cheese, and used small curd cottage cheese. Added finely chopped fresh spinach. Yum! Will definitely make it again.

My fiancé requested stuffed shells for his birthday dinner and this was my first time making them. This recipe was awesome and we both loved them! I used small curd cottage cheese and made a piping bag out of a ziploc baggie. This recipe makes ALOT of shells so I will definitely cut it in half next time I make it since it's just the two of us.

Was restaurant quality per my husband.  The only reason it has 4 stars is due to changes.  I added extra garlic powder.  Used frozen spinach and 4% fat small curd cottage cheese.  For someone who doesn't like cottage cheese, I wasn't sure about it, but it was very good, with no cottage cheese flavor.  I would make 1/2 recipe next time as full recipe was too much for 2 people, and I had leftover filling.  A keeper!

Simple to make and delicious.  I made my own spaghetti sauce so to avoid all the sodium and preservatives.  I also played with the seasonings a bit and used the small curd cottage cheese.  My guys LOVED it!  I will definitely make this again.

LOVED this recipe. For a family of three we used only about half the box  of jumbo shells and made in a 3 QT baking dish full.
The one thing I did add however for that amount of noodles is, I cut down the cottage cheese to about one container, add the parmesan but in addition added grated parmesan into the mix for that cheesy texture. I also cooked lean ground turkey with some minced garlic, added it to the sauce and layered it. Altogether with a side salad it was a delicious treat. As long as you blend blend blend you won't get that cottage cheese lumpy texture! Hope this helps some!

I added more garlic to the filling and some fresh spinach. There was plenty of left over filling so I stuffed extra shells and put them in the freezer for later that week. They were still amazing. I used jar sauce for the frozen shells for a quick meal. I will do this again! And again!

This recipe is AMAZING! Everyone in the house enjoyed this recipe so much, there were no leftovers! The only changes I made were I added a Italian seasoning and some ground mild Italian sausage to the filling and I used freshly grated Parmesan reggiano.

I got complimented on just the perfect amount of herbs. I wish the recipe had been more specific on the amount of shells. At first I put in 12 but there was a lot of left over stuffing  so I made like 12 more and there were lots of extras. I recommend doing around 20. Overall this was an amazing meal!

Awesome dish. However, did add fresh basil and oregano. Also fried up some pork sausage, ground it and added to the filling

I followed others' suggestions & stopped cooking noodles 2mins early so they wouldn't turn to mush. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T. (OK,  extra cheese always helps.) This recipe is time consuming, but makes for an awesome dish & it's worth the time.

First time I've made stuffed shells...actually very easy!  I put the filling in a ziplock bag, as someone recommended in the comments...very easy to squeeze it into the shells!  Will make again!!

My husband and I made these for a dinner night with my father and brother. We made two boxes of pasta and doubled the recipe. Well, needless to say, it was all gone within one hour. My children loved it as well. We will definitely be making these again!

Added 1 package chopped drained spinach and 1 diced red pepper.  Used the bag method to apply to undercooked and cooled shells.  Cooked beautifully and were mightily delicious.

I halved the recipe but added more herbs.  It was very good.  My grocery store didn't have ricotta, so I used cottage cheese and it was still good.  This recipe made alot.  So we have a ton of leftovers.

This is delicious! I made a double batch and froze one. We are having it again tonight. The only thing that I changed was to use Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  And I probably used more seasoning than called for as I never really measure. This will be in our rotation, as we all love Italian and I'm always  wanting to cook at least one meatless meal per week. Thanks for the simple, yet delicious recipe!!

Half small curd cottage cheese and half ricotta. Pressed garlic to taste.. don't over do it as it will get bitter. A teaspoon of sugar in the ricotta fixes that ;) Used Italian seasonings in the cheese and Newmans Own Marinara for the sauce. Very yummy!

I used Ricotta cheese, cooked 2 garlic cloves and a small diced onion  with the hamburger. I didn't have Parmesan or parsley on hand, so just deleted them. It turned out fantastic! Froze some and cooked at a later date and were just as good as the first time cooked !

Slight Changes ... Added GROUND CHICKEN to mixture .. Seasoned with seasoning salt, garlic powder and oregano, Cooked off and set aside to cool ... Then diced small. A small tub of Brookstone cottage large curd(entire tub)  ... Sargento mozzarella and half the bag of the Sargento Italian blend ... No Parsley and Bertolli Oilve oil and Garlic tomatoes sauce ... PLUS the rest of the said ingredients.. Plastic spoon to scoop mixture  in pasta ... Spoon full of sauce on each shell and a bit of the Italian blend cheese before covering to bake 30 minutes ... HEAVENLY .. A SURE HIT

It made waaaay to much for me. Of course, there were only two of us. It'd probably be good for 4 or more people. I used small curd cottage cheese instead of large as other people recommended otherwise it tasted great

AMAZING!! My husband is VERY picky when it comes to Italian food so I don't tend to make it often but I told him about this recipe and we figured we'd give it a try. I took some people's advice about using small curd cottage cheese and I definitely think that was a good choice. To make a long story short, I gave him his plate (which I served with pork italian meatballs and garlic bread), he took one bit, came into the kitchen to give me a hug and told me they were the best he's ever had. Lol! I think it was a success! Will definitely be making this many more times!!!!

Super easy and yummy :) I ended up using less shells and stuffing the remaining ones a lot :) Maybe could use some more spices to break up the cheese flavor, but yummy :)

I would absolutely make it again! I added a bit more cheese on top, though. As for ricotta vs. cottage cheese, GO WITH RICOTTA. The texture is much better. I also heated up some more sauce in a saucepan, put it in a bowl and everyone added a little extra on top. Overall amazing, I recommend trying this recipe.

I loved this! It turned out so yummy! And I only changed a few things. I used the small curd cottage cheese because I felt the large wouldn't be too good. I added ground beef in with the sauce, which was a great idea! And I topped it off with a little bit of Mexican fiesta cheese, which is just a mixture of different cheeses. All in all a great dish! Totally saving this to use again later!

This is amazing!!! My husband raved about it and he doesn't usually like pasta dishes. I made it with large curd cottage cheese and added shredded mozzarella to the top of the dish. I made some plain and some with Italian sausage mixed into the stuffing. They were both awesome!!!! I will definitely be keeping this recipe!

loved it!!!

used small curd cottage cheese, also added some shredded parm in the mix. also I would suggest using 3/4 of a box of shells. The whole box made too many shells.

I was so excited by how this turned out.  I used small curd  cottage cheese.  I also added a package of frozen spinach and mild sausage to half for my son and husband.  It was so good and everyone was happy!  Thanks for the recipe!

I prefer to make mine with ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Also I increase the garlic powder and add onion powder. Instead of parsley, I use basil. Then it deserves 5 stars.

very tasty and not difficult to make at all. didn't cover with foil and they didn't dry out either aside from what others said. agree that topping with mozzarella would add more to it though it's just fine the way listed. will make again.

Great recipe, I altered some things based on what I had and was very pleased. Instead of cottage cheese I used sour cream and used less than called for, added basil pesto, added feta, and doubled the Parmesan. It was great, very flavorful and surprisingly enough they melded well. big hit, will do it again.

I was skeptical about these stuffed shells because they called for cottage cheese instead of ricotta. After reading the reviews, I decided to go for it and they were the BEST stuffed shells I've ever had. I'll never make them any other way.

I really liked these, but my son didn't. The cottage cheese gave it a different taste, I think I will try doing a half cottage cheese/half ricotta mix next time.

Loved this recipe the only thing I changed was I used fresh spinach to avoid having to drain the liquid. I also used garlic seasoning instead of cloves of garlic. Other than changing some of the ingredients, I followed it to the letter. My family loved it.

So delicious!!! My whole family really enjoyed this recipe! It makes a very "stuffed" 9x13 and will feed our family of 5 twice. Can't beat that! I also used ricotta, and instead of mozzarella, I used the shredded six cheese Italian blend from Publix.

My son and I loved this dish! I added a thawed and drained block of frozen spinach, doubled the basil, increased the garlic powder to about 3/4 tsp, and used two cans of Hunt's tomato sauce (basil & herb - what we had on hand). It turned out perfectly and was pretty easy. I thought stuffing the shells would be a pain but it wasn't. Plus, we will be able to get at least 3 full meals out of it (I made another half pan with all the extra shells and stuffing since it didn't fit in one pan). Added to the regular dinner rotation!!

Delicious! You can also freeze these for use later. I scaled down to 4 servings. Used 1 cup of Ricotta and 1 cup of cottage cheese. Also, be generous with the sauce. I had to almost double what the recipe calls for.

Coming from an Italian family this was in our dinner rotation often.  The mixture here is wonderful - I too am not a fan of cottage cheese and used ricotta instead - left everything else the same - family enhales it - always a good sign.  I usually double the batch and freeze one tray for another night.  DELICIOUS!

I am lactose intolerant and there is a Lactaid cottage cheese. I beat it with an electric mixer until it was light and fluffy as ricotta cheese. Added the rest of the ingredients. I sautéed mushrooms and added my marinara sauce. Poured the sauce over them and baked it. It was wonderful! Our guests had no idea until I told them it was cottage cheese.  I served them over sautéed baby spinach. Some wanted the spinach on the side and that was fine with me.

Easy and delicious. The only thing I did different was swap out cottage cheese for ricotta because that's what I prefer and used an extra half a jar of sauce. It was a winner with everyone.

Pretty good, but tastes just as good with about 1/3 less the mozzarella. This recipe is pretty much nothing but cheese, so try adding some spinach to make it healthier, and to add more variety. Also, add some of the pasta sauce into the cheese mixture to improve taste and it make it easier to mix.

This recipe is delicious!! My husband doesnt like ricotta, which I grew up putting in this recipe... Don't even miss the ricotta... The cottage cheese makes it so moist! I cook up about a pound of hamburger and add to this recipe, to make it fill us up more!!

LOVE this recipe. It is a great alternative to the stronger taste of ricotta stuffed shells, which makes it kid friendly. So yummy!

Very good and super cheesy. I used the 3 cups small curd cottage cheese and 1 cup ricotta cheese. It was great and very filling.

Delicious! I took the advice from an earlier review and put the shells into cold water after cooking.  I also used a sandwich bag for the filling. Came out great! Thank you.

This was very simple and very delicious. My kids absolutely loved it. Aside from adding extra spaghetti sauce (my bottle was a 32oz bottle from Costco, so I just used the whole thing!), I didn't change a thing. It was GREAT.

This was very good - my husband and son really enjoyed it. I thought it needed more sauce, and more seasoning in the cheese filling but less egg. With some minor tweaks this would be perfect! :) (I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese for the filling). I added 1 lb cooked ground beef to my spaghetti sauce as well.

Loved the recipe!  We added spinach as recommended by one of the reviewers (only half a package), used a mixture of ricotta and small curd cottage cheese, and added chopped fresh garlic instead of powder (added probably a tablespoon- yum!)  This made more than one pan, so we made two!  Lots of leftovers.  Absolutely delicious!

I made the recipe as is - it turned out great with LOTS of leftovers!  This recipe is only a 4 because the cheese mixture inside the shells could be a little bit more set together instead of runny and with any italian casserole dish you need to cover the pan with foil for most of the cooking so that your pasta does not dry out.  I cooked for around 40 minutes.  The leftovers the next day are even yummier :)

This was awesome!  I had friends over for dinner and made this for the first time.  It went over fantastic!!  I made a few changes to make it more filling.  I added a package of cooked and well drained ground sausage to the filling and kept out the cottage cheese since I did not have any.  I used a red pepper sauce that I believe made it even better.  Will make this again soon!

This is delicious! I'm giving it four stars because I did have to double the spices; if I didn't it would still have been good but just a tad on the bland side.  I did not use cottage cheese because I didn't have any on hand but next time I'll be adding that as well.  Thanks!

I didn't feel like digging htrough my recipes for my mother in laws stuffed shells w/ cottage cheese so I tried this one.  For some reason, although I drained the pasta well, everything, including the filling was disappointingly runny. The flavor was quite bland as well.

My family enjoys this meal. I kind of combine two recipes I have. I like to add half a pound of sausage and half a pound of hamburger. I cook it in a skillet with sauted onions and add it to the mix. Very tasty!!

I made these today and they were very easy. The taste was very good. I don't like the texture of ricotta so this was a nice change. Also, seasoning the filling was a nice change instead of the plain ricotta, egg and parmesan. It did make a lot of shells, but I am sure I will find people to eat food this good.  Thanks for the recipe. I will be making these again.

We added in the spinach and used the small curd cottage cheese, as recommended. We made enough to freeze the stuffing so we can have a quick and easy meal on a weeknight.

This is an excellent meal for any pasta lovers.  My husband has declared it as one of the best dishes I have made.  He believes the cottage cheese is what makes it so good.  I used a tomato and herb pasta sause, which gave it added flavor.  I also made half the recipe and froze the rest to be made later.  Will definitely make this dish over and over again!

Very good - I did add some sausage to the mixture and made a basic homemade sauce. The filling was a little salty but I think that was the cheese that I used. Thanks for the recipe

Very good recipe.  The stuffed & baked shells freeze wonderfully - just add a little more sauce around them when you reheat.  I like to add some blanched spinach to the filling, but made exactly as the recipe these are great.

I LOVE stuffed shells and just made them myself for the first time with this recipe.  It was easy, tasty, and you can basically add any little thing like spinach or tomatoes, into the filling and it still comes out great

I made 12 servings of this which filled a 10x15, 9x13, and 9 inch pie plate. I followed the advice of "redamber" by not boiling the shells. And it worked great! (I had to make it the night before and pour 1/2 - 1 cup of water of the tops of shells with their stuffing.) The moisture of the sauce on the bottom, the filling, and the water softens the shells. And they needed to cook for 50-60 mins the next day. Also I poured the top sauce on (which I added ground turkey to) right before baking. This recipe was salty =(. I needed more sauce than the recipe called for. I put the filling in a ziploc, cut the corner off, and squeezed the filling in. Seems like a great recipe! Probably much easier the way I and some other people did it! I added spinach too!

I used Ricotta cheese instead of Cottage cheese.  I didn't mix the cheese together with the sauce either.  It turned pretty good.  My guys liked it but I notice that no one has heated up any of the leftovers.  I topped with Mozzarella and covered the dish while it baked and then took the foil off for the last 15 minutes of baking.  The Mozzarella on top made this dish, without it it would not have been as good.  I think using a meat sauce instead of just a marinara sauce would be a good addition.  This was OK but not one of our absolute favorite meals.

I cooked these for my ravioli-loving boyfriend. he liked them just as much as he likes ravioli! it was a nice change from our usual. we used pesto sauce instead of tomato, and I also added cheese on top. overall, it was really good. some of the noodles were a little dry, so next time I'll probably cover for longer.

I got very good reviews making this for a pretty large crowd.  The only changes I made were adding 3 tablespoons of italian seasoning (I doubled the recipe though) and chopping up meatballs and mixing them into the cheese mixture.  You can use however many meatballs you want. It was great.

Great recipe! A little more work than baked ziti - but the results are fantastic and the kids loved the look! I cooked the shells for only a few minutes, so that they were soft, but not fully cooked - so they would retain their shape and be a bit more stable hen filling them. I too placed all the filling in a large zip-lock bag and it was very easy to fill the shells. I topped the shells with mozzarella cheese the last 3 minutes of baking so that it would still be cheese and not too crisp. This is a keeper!

Alot of stuffes shell recipes call for ricotta cheese. I like this recipe very well because the taste is much better with the cottage cheese. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe but was skeptical about the cottage cheese.  Since so many people praised it I tried 1/2 cottage cheese 1/2 ricotta.  I thought the cottage cheese gave it excellent flavor and next time I am doing 100% cottage cheese.  YUM!

Very Good.  I halved the recipe and it fits into a 9x13 pan. I subbed reudced fat cottage cheese and lo-fat mozzarella and didn't notice any difference.  I added 10 oz. frozen  chopped spinach.  I also used 4 cloves of garlic instead of powder.  I added salt and pepper to the filling and piped in the filling using a zip loc bag.  I boiled the shells for only 10 minutes so they were super al-dente to make handling easier.  I covered the shells with the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" recipe from this site.  Very tasty and not too much work.

I had to use manicotti instead and followed reviews to up the garlic powder to 1 tsp and parsley and basil (dry) to 2 tsp and add a package of frozen spinach.  My favorite piece of advice was to cook the pasta 3 minutes less than recommended then return cool water to the pot.  Not only were the manicotti easy to work with, they were cooked to perfect al dente when they came out of the oven.  My husband told me they were wonderful 3 times during dinner.

I made this for my Husband and I and we loved it! The only thing that I have done different was I added a pound of ground turkey. I took the ground turkey and while it was raw I seasoned it with garlic, onion, and Italian seasonings and then cooked it on the stove (just like I would hamburger) while my shells where cooking after my turkey was done I set it aside to cool and mixed my cheese mix together I added the same spices to it as I did the turkey I than added the cooked turkey to the cheese mix and stirred it well than stuffed it in the shells. My husband and I loved it!!

I don't cook very often but I made this recipe for my boyfriend who is very picky eater and we both loved it! It wasn't very difficult and baked well. I used part-skim ricotta instead of cottage cheese, added a bit more garlic powder, and topped it with mozzarella as well as parmesan. I baked it for 20 minutes covered, and 20 minutes uncovered. I used two jars of Newman's Own Tomato Basil sauce to which I added ground turkey and Italian Seasoning. This recipe made about two trays of shells, so I'll probably halve it next time. Great recipe though, I will definitely keep experimenting with it!

Darn good! Good for kids who "don't like ricotta". I made it for a pregnant friend who had a kid who "didn't like ricotta" but ate this all. Great for vegetarians and husbands. I don't make any changes. This is in the meals-we-eat-regularly rotation.

Awesome! I asked my husband(the official taste tester) what he thought I should rate this recipe. I automatically thought 5 stars after tasting it but he said 25 stars!!! Lol. We both loved it. I halved the recipe because there are only the two of us and there is still enough leftover for lunch tomorrow even after stuffing ourselves... I only measured the cottage cheese though. I just eyed everything else to a good looking consistency. I also topped with extra mozz cheese and let it get slightly browned and bubbly in the oven. Delish! I am going to make this for a bible study potluck on Friday too and will update everyone elses thoughts on the dish later...

A perfect base recipe to add your own touches to. Great for my family with vegetarians and nonvegetarians. I don't have to make 2 main courses! My daughter had them for dinner, an afterdinner snack and lunch the next day. Thanks so much!

I made this recipe for the first time last night and it was a huge hit.  My husband loved it and so did my 5 children.  I only had one large container of cottage cheese, I didn't realize I needed four cups and I only had 8 oz of mozzarella cheese, but it turned out great anyways.  Next time I think I will add some riccota cheese in there also.   Great Recipe!

Really good dinner.  I tried to blend it together to make it easier to put into the shells, but it didn't work.  I did the zip lock bag thing and that was great!

Delicious recipe but makes a ton of shells. Next time I will halve the recipe. I didn't feel like using oregano and parsley so I used all-purpose italian seasoning instead, which worked fine. I also added a bit of garlic to the stuffing mixture because my family loves garlic. I would love to try this with a meat sauce, too. My daughter cleaned her plate without a fuss which is unusual for a four-year-old!

I doubled the recipe and made four pans. I froze three for when I don't feel like cooking. I made a few minor changes. I used Manicotti because that's all I could find at the store. I added half a pack of cream cheese. I'm not sure that made much of a difference, but I love cream cheese! I used about twice as much spaghetti sauce then the recipe called for but my husband LOVES spaghetti sauce. Lastly, with one batch I added ground beef and with the other I added spinach. I will not be adding ground beef in the future, I think it made the consistency weird. The cheese is so creamy but the meat is chunky, I didn't really care for it. We are having the spinach tonight...I can't wait to try it. I think I will like it with the spinach. I was eating just the filling last night as I was making it and I loved it. Oh and I piped the filling in with a ziploc bag.

This recipe was great! I used ricotta cheese for the filling instead of the cottage cheese, and also added italian sausage into the filling. For a shortcut, I used italian seasoning and topped the shells with extra mozzarella.

I did make a lot of changes but the basic recipe is very good as well hence, 5 stars. First, I added can of tomato sauce, frozen spinach and I used tofu instead of cottage or ricotta cheese. My vegetarian family member LOVED it!

This was great! We couldn't stop eating it, it was actually really funny. Every time I'd take out 2 pans to put the next 2 we'd sit around and eat from the pans cooling off. Needless to say there wasn't much left when I was finally done making it, hehe.

I recently made a tray of these for my daughter's second birthday.  Everyone raved about them.  I did process the cheese mixture in the food processor.  I have to tell you - no one knew it was cottage cheese and everyone asked for more and the recipe.  This is a definite keeper and user again.  Fabulous for dinner, parties, or for when you want to give something to friends for sickness/births/deaths/etc.

Thank you!!!!!!

Very, very good.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and cut the filling recipe in half.  I ended up using about 21 shells, and half of the recipe filled them all perfectly, with none left over.  I also used homemade sauce that I make in large batches and keep in the freezer.

Turned out pretty good made as directed.  I think next time I will add some basil and a little more garlic.  I definitely will use more sauce next time.

These were pretty good.  I used half cottage cheese, half ricotta and pured the mixture in my food processor.  Then added the spices.  I used the piping method to fill the shells and it worked beautifully.  I do recommend only cooking the shells for 5 minutes, run cool water over them, then lay them out on towels to dry and cool for about 20 minutes- makes filling them a breeze.  Made my own pasta sauce from this site, "best marinara ever" Next time I will use a different sauce recipe...

These are super tasty!  I used cottage cheese (small curd) as I had no ricotta.  This is going in my keep file for sure.   Thanks for sharing!

I loved this recipe, but I changed a couple of things. Instead of using cottage cheese, I used cream cheese and it was a hit! Really creamy! I also stuffed the shells with seasoned extra lean ground beef cooked with onions. My guests couldn't get enough of it. I'll definately make this again and again.

I never made this before so I started by following your recipe, I did however make some changes. I made my own spaghetti sauce with hamburger, green & red onions, mushrooms, garlic and the whole wide array of spices.. I added spinach to the cheese mixture and used ricotta cheese instead, after stuffing the shells i spred some sauce on the bottom and placed the shells in the pan and then covered with more sauce and toped with mozza cheese and spices.. EVERYONE here loved it, they said i should make it a weekly meal! Thanks for the recipe, I will use it again and again!

These were good (especially the filling), but I'm thinking I may substitute homemade sauce for the store-bought kind next time.  My family also prefers ground beef in spaghetti sauce, but hardly missed it in this recipe.

This was very filling and simple to make.  I have the Pampered Chef stainless steel scoops, and the medium-sized one was perfect for stuffing the shells.  Absolutely no mess!

Great recipe!  I followed the advice of others and used small curd cottage cheese and I did add a cup of spinach (thawed, rinsed and drained) and it was fabulous.  My family loved it and my husband said it was the best pasta dish I have ever made!  I make a lot of pasta too.  It is pretty time consuming but definitely well worth it.

This has GOT to be my favorite dish to make and eat.  I look forward to this all the time.  I substitute my own home made sauce and it freezes really well.  This can also be made low fat with low fat cheeses...still delicious and hard to tell its low fat!

This dish was good. I thought it needed more of a zing, it was sort of bland. Next time I will use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. I didn't like that it was runny/watery. And definately more mozzarella cheese. I will add it to the top along with the parmessan. Overall, it was easy to make (I made it the night before) My husband and best friend loved it, so I will be making this dish again. Thanks!

I have made these several times - it is also my go-to recipe for entertaining.  They are amazing!  This is my one recipe my boyfriend will beg me to make.  They are better than any stuffed shells I've ever had.  I hate cottage cheese by itself, but it is amazing in this recipe - it gives you a lighter cheese texture - never that dried out chewy ricotta texture I've had in some stuffed shells.  I usually add some spicy ground sausage meat because my boyfriend needs his meat.  Sometimes I'll use 1/4 ricotta and 3/4 cottage cheese which is good, but not necessary.  I cook the shells for 1/2 the time indicated on the box as they are easier to work with and will finish cooking in the oven.  I tried the plastic bag method to stuff them, but I found it's easier to just stuff them by hand and get a little messy.

This was very good. The only thing I did differently was use small curd cottage cheese.

We really liked this recipe! I added spinach to the cheese mixture as others suggested (although hubby would have been happier if I had left it out) and made my own sauce. I was really in the mood for an Italian meal, but not spaghetti again. This was a really nice change!! Thanks for the recipe!

This was good but I did use Ricotta instead. I'm not a cottage cheese fan. Everyone seemed to enjoy it.

I made this recipe for my family and boyfriend. They absolutely loved it! I followed other reviews and instead of cottage cheese I used ricotta. I also added crushed red peppers for a little kick and turned out wonderful!!

this was very very good but go easy on the stuffing of the shells or you will end up with a mess.  The original recipe makes way too much, half the recipe for a family of 3-4 IT WILL BE PLENTY!!!  My whole family loved it and was a nice alternative to the regular pasta dishes we eat

This was very good and easy. I did use ricotta instead of cottage cheese though as my family doesn't like cottage cheese. I also added extra sauce. A quick and easy meal that pleases the whole family. Thanks for the recipe!!

Amazing.  This is now in my regular recipe rotation!  I use this in manicotti shells, and it always turns out great.  I use fresh herbs, and I sprinkle some of the minced parsley and basil over the top before baking.  YUM!

I was not a huge fan.  I did not care for the cottage cheese, and I probably would have preferred ricotta.  This was my fault, but I followed some other suggestions and added some seasoned ground beef.  It did not go well at all!  I may try again with ricotta and no beef.

eh...ok.  I've had much better.  In fact I've made a lot better just throwing together a bunch of stuff I have on hand impromtu.  I definitely did not like the large cottage cheese curds either.  I won't make this again.  Bummer.

We mae this all the time. I like a little more garlic, and I use ricotta instead of cottage cheese cause I just can't get past the clumps (yuk). A new family favorite- I've also used the stuffing in lasagna and manicotti as well, all with great results.

This recipe was great.  I was worried the cottage cheese would make the filling too lumpy, but it melted in with the rest of the filling and came out smooth and creamy, but not too runny.  Piping the filling in using a ziploc back was a real time saver.  I will be making this again and again!

I really liked this. I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and it was a little dry. Next time I'll add more sauce. Very easy to make...I did the whole thing while I was on the phone!

My family had mixed reviews on this one.  My daughter liked it cause it tasted like pizza to her.  My son hated it.  My husband liked it and I thought it was pretty good.  I think I would've liked it better with meat in it.  I'm not sure I would make again since we're not huge pasta people anyway.

My whole family loved the shells! It was a messy job to fill the shells. I think that the kind of spaghetti sauce you use really adds. Still it was pretty good and I will try them again.

Boyfriend loved it!  I used my favorite cottage cheese - Friendship.  It is smaller curd cottage cheese - almost the consistency of a chunky ricotta.

Very good.  We cut the recipe in half for our family of three.  Per recommendations we added thawed frozen spinach, and half ricotta and half cottage cheese.  The store I went to only had large shells, not jumbo, so rather than stuffing the shells I layered sauce, shells, cheese mixture, and added mozzarella cheese to the top.  The neighbor kid loved it too.

I used my own spagetti sauce and it was great. I used ricotta/cottage cheese and also added more garlic. Will be making often.

This was a good recipe.  I made as stated but next time, I will double the amount of spaghetti sauce and I don't think small curd cottage cheese will make any difference.  I also could only find 12oz boxes of jumbo pasta shells.  This seemed to be the right amount.  I will also use fresh garlic cloves.  Not quite garlicky for us.  This will be great for Lent next year!

I took Littlepuffy's suggestion and added chopped spinach, fresh basil and parsley.  I used fresh mozzerella and parmesan and didn't deem necessary to have as much sauce as posted in the recipe.

Very Good!  I mixed the ricotta and cottage cheese which made a very creamy filling.  I added italian sausage to half of the shells.  The plain cheese ones tasted better.  Go for the extra sauce, garlic powder and italian spices.  Would make again.

The only thing I changed was to add 1 lb of cooked and crumbled italian sausage.  This is definitely a keeper - ky picky toddler/preschooler both loved it and asked for more.

This is the second time I have made this and love the recipe!  I did 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese.  It is really good.  It makes a lot of filling so I would boil more shells.  They freeze great.

I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and I added some lean ground beef to give the meal a little more "substance".  The recipe made a lot more than I expected but, since it was so tasty, I didn't mind the leftovers!

Very simple to make and very filling.  I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese.  There was way too much cheese mixture.  I recommend cutting it in half.  I also added italian sausage to the spaghetti sauce.

Made this for dinner tonight and my picky 7 year old even asked for seconds!  Took advice from others:  boiled pasta for 2.5 minutes less than the package directs call for and used the KitchenAid and pastry bag for the cheese mixture - also added a little salt and garlic powder.  Didn't have mozzarella, so I used Colby/Jack mixture.  Covered with foil for the first 20 minutes of baking.  This was great...thx!

Yep, this recipe was really good, and pretty easy to make also. I made my own sausage/mushroom/onion/pesto/basil/tomato sauce to use, and I feel that it really brought out the potential that this recipe really has. I also baked a Romano/mozzerella blend on top of the dish. pretty dang good.

Followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  Another time used small curd cottage cheese and still turned out great.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks!

These shells had a great taste.  I did substitute half of the cottage cheese with ricotta.  Otherwise, I left the recipe "As Is".  It would have earned 5 stars, but it was pretty time consuming.  Make sure you have all the ingredients on hand and have about an hour for preparation, as that's about how long it took me without rushing.  I don't know about you, but I hate to rush when cooking.  I would only make this on a day when I have the extra time.  Overall, a GREAT RECIPE!  Thanks Karen!!

This is a good, easy recipe; but it definitely needs some blend of ricotta cheese as many have suggested; next time I'm adding a sprinkle of black pepper also. The pastry bag trick is also impt; I didn't see anyone else mention any problem with it but I also baked it covered because I didn't want the pasta shells to dry out.  It is a good recipe.

This was a great recipe although I did make a few changes.  I used manicotti tubes instead of sheels for ease of stuffing.  I used all ricotta cheese and no cottage (personal preference) and I also added a 10 oz. boz of spinach to the mixture.  We like things with a lot of flavor so I also played around with extra seasoning.  Overall, a great basic recipe that can be modified for anyone.

This recipe is so easy and very good! I thought the idea of using a cut plastic zip bag to fill the shells with was a good one, but it was actually much harder than using a spoon! I added minced garlic to the filling and a few whole cloves around the shells in the sauce. Thanks for the great recipe!

Needs more spaghetti sauce.  It was very good though, especially the leftovers.  I topped the dish with mozzarella and parmesean before baking.  We love cheese!!  I also added spinach to the mixture, and used ricotta rather than cottage cheese.  I'll try cottage cheese next time.  Yummy!!!

This was very yummy! I, like many others, added a package of frozen spinich. I also upped the spices and added Italian Seasoning to the cheese mixture. Also, I put some extra Mozzarella cheese on top before baking. YUMMM! This was the perfect dish to me and my fiances romantic dinner!

This was really yummy.  I added fresh basil and parsley, some hot pepper flakes and about a teaspoon of fennel seeds.  It might have been a little bland, otherwise.  Also, I had asiago, not parmesan on hand, so I used that, and half mozzerella and half edam.  I only made a half-batch, but kept the amount of sauce the same, and that worked perfectly.  It nicely filled a 9x13 pan.  I used skim mozzerella and 1% cottage cheese.  The curds were looking too big to pipe into the shells, so I mashed them a little with a potato masher, and that worked well.

I've used this recipe for many years now, with the exception that I've only used parsley to season the cheese mixture.  This time I also used the garlic powder and oregano your recipe called for, with much more flavorful results!!
I also use small-curd cottage cheese for more of a ricotta-like texture.

OH MY!! This was wonderful! I used Manacotti noodles because my store was out of the large shells, but it was delicious! My dh loved it, and even wanted to know if I would make it again a few days later. This will definately be a keeper, and even better, it is so quick and easy to make. Thank you, Karen!

One word....YOWSER!!!  I made this for a potluck and I thought it made waaay too much.  But to my surprise, they went like hot cakes.  All the buzz was..."Who made the shells?"  Such a simple, yet tasty recipe.  But I used about an additional 14 ounces of sauce.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe, and my office thanks you!!!

This was a great recipe and not so hard to make! It makes a lot of leftovers too! I actually used a little bit of ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Thanks!

We loved this when I made it.  I ended up with alot of extra cheese, though.  I now put in 3 cups cottage cheese and add 1 lb. browned hamburger for a little variety.  It is really a great recipe!
