After reading reviews, I decreased the cinnamon and red pepper. Also added sliced mushrooms, a diced red bell pepper, and more pineapple juice + cornstarch to make a sauce. Came out wonderfully flavored (and the red pepper was a welcome touch of color) and not too spicy. Served over brown rice. Will make again, using 2 bell peppers in different colors, and maybe a sweet onion.

this recipe was really really great! my family loved it.I read a couple of the reviews before i made it and just put half as much cinnamon. I cut the chicken breast in big cubes and and made sure it was cooked before i added the ingredients, then i continued to cook it on medium to medium high, so it wouldn't be too soupy, and it came out great.  Easy and tasty recipe!

I made a few changes - more brown sugar and jerk seasoning.  I also added some flour to thicken the sauce.  Served over rice, it was delicious!

Way too much cinnamon.  In fact, if I make this dish again, I would probably leave it out completely.  Pretty spicy.  Also good leftover.

As most of my reviews show, I tend to give "high" ratings based on recipes. There's very little we don't like.  

However, this one just did NOTHING for us.

This dish was entirely too spicy and had almost no liquid at all...(the liquid from the pineapples wasn't nearly enough)

I'm not sure where we could have gone wrong with it, but it wasn't a keeper for us...sorry.

Easy to make!  Great flavor!  I served mine over white rice - it was delicious!  I think that next time I'll try carmelizing a sweet onion and tossing it in the mix too!!  Yum!

This sounded so odd I had to try it.  We liked it a lot.  I used jerk flavored marinade and that worked great.  It definitely had a kick but the pineapple was a good combination with that.  I used spaghetti noodles.

I would rate this a 4.5. I gave it a 4 since I had to make small adjustments to the recipe as the other reviewers mentioned.  It was very good, I just wish I had seen the recommendation to serve with rice before hand.  The entire time I was eating it I was wishing I had rice to go with it.

The sauce thickness was perfect, just a little runny so the noodles (& rice) can soak up some of the goodness too.

I used less than half of the cinnamon and thought that worked perfectly.  Next time I'll also cut back the red pepper by half and add a diced red pepper for some color.  I like spicy, but was just a tad too much and if I had been cooking it for others, I'm sure their mouths would have been on fire.

Good job Joel!

I really liked this recipe. The family thought it was a bit too spicy though. Next time I make this I will cut down the heat.

this recipe was delicious and a huge hit! i altered it a little by marinating the chicken in coconut milk for about an hour and then i cooked the chicken in the COCONUT MILK INSTEAD OF OIL. after i cooked the chicken for about 8 min in a skillet on high i added my other ingredients (minus the jerk seasoning) and cooked in the skillet on low for about an hour. the coconut milk made it very juicy and gave it a little bit more sauce. i served it over white rice and it was GREAT!!

A party in my mouth!! This dish is so totally delicious, it is packed with flavors that burst in your mouth! I made 2 changes...I could not find jerk seasoning anywhere, so I used KC Masterpiece Caribbean Jerk marinade instead. I marinated the 2 chicken breasts in it overnight.  The other change I made was that I doubled all of the other ingredients to have lots of sauce for the whole wheat angle hair pasta noodles (added a little cornstarch to ticken it up).  LOVED IT! I did not cut back on anything, loved the cinnamon and pepper flavors combined. Just delicous, my husband said it was a 'keeper'!

After reading the other reviews, I took their advice and dropped the amount of cinnamon and adding more pineapple. Turned out great! I threw in a little corn starch to thicken the sauce and used rice instead of pasta. Great dish!

This was great - my hubby normally does not like fruit/meat combos but he ate this right up.  Since I have small children I used a little less of the jerk seasoning and omitted the red pepper in their servings. I also only used half of the red pepper seasoning and half of the cinnamon and liked it that way. I might try it with rice, but the pasta was good.

I didn't think that there was much flavor with this dish. I did follow other reviews & used less cinnamon. I don't know if that had anything to do with it.

This recipe was great and easy to prepare.  I ran out of jerk seasoning so I used creole seasoning instead.  Based on other reviews did cut down on amount of cinnamon but found the amount of liquid was good if simmered for just the right amount of time!

Simple to make, my husband loved it! He doesn't like pasta so I used brown jasmine rice instead. I marinated the chicken for about 20 minutes in lime juice and followed the advice of others to cut back a bit on the cinnamon. Will make again the same way but add some veggies such as bell pepper and shredded carrot.

I made this recipe as written other than adding a little less of the red pepper flakes.  I thought it had amazing flavor!  It was spicy and sweet, really, really good.  The only negatives were that it was too spicy for my kids and I would serve it with brown rice instead of noodles next time.  I think the sauce would flavor the rice nicely and it somehow didn't seem to go with noodles.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe a few weeks ago, and have been loving it ever since. Per other's comments I've made a few changes, like adding in mushrooms, onions and peppers (which I almost always use when cooking) while cooking the chicken, use a chicken stock cube, rice instead of pasta and add in the herbs and spices while cooking the chicken. I find this dish has a great Cajun feel to it, which is a nice change compared to the Curry/Chillis I've been eating recently. All in all I love this dish. Great job!

My entire family loved this recipe.  The only thing I would change is the amount of cinnamon used.  Next time I will decrease the amount slightly so that it doesn't overpower all the other wonderful flavors in the dish.

I made this last night and I would agree with most of the reviews above. The dish needed mroe flavor - try adding some red wine vinegar to give it a more robust flavor. Depending on what seasoning you use, I would reduce/eliminate the amt of chili powder and red pepper flakes - dish is very spicy. Also reduce the brown sugar, too much offsets the dish to being too sweet. The bellpeppers and onions are a nice addition.

I've tried many recipes from this website and this was the first one I didn't care for.  There was entirely too much cinnamon, and I did not care for the smell of this dish.  I give it a two thumbs down.  Sorry Joel!

Very good recipe, though I made a couple changes. I added a clove of garlic (minced) to the chicken along with the spices and sauteed for a minute before adding the pineapple to develop their flavor. I used fresh pineapple and didn't have enough juice for a sauce, so I added about a cup of apple juice (it's what I had on hand). Didn't have flaked coconut or coconut milk, so I cheated and added coconut extract. Added some chopped green onions for color/freshness at the end along with some cornstarch to thicken the sauce and served over brown rice.

It was pretty good but would be better over rice with more sauce. I also added red pepper, mushrooms and onions.

Nice blend of sweet and spicy, but nothing spectacular.  Sauteed some onions first, then threw the chicken cut into bite size chunks in to cook with it, then added green and red peppers along with the seasonings and extra pineapple and juice.  Used Jerk Seasoning from this site, omitted coconut (not a fan), added and served over rotini pasta.  I think it would be much better served over rice.  Don't skimp on the pineapple - it really served to offset the spiciness.

I followed the advice of another review and didn't add as much cinnamon and more pineapple juice. It was delicious!!! I will definitely make this again and add some more veggies. Thanks for such an easy and delicious meal!

I made this to the recipe with the addition of 1/2 sliced fresh jalepeno and 1/2 red bell pepper chopped, and the juice of one lime at the end. Very Good! Yes, as others have said, reduce the cinnamon. I dont think the shredded coconut does much for the dish. Next time I will leave it out and add a half can of coconut milk and a tablespoon of hot red curry powder.

was just a tad too spicy between the jerk and red pepper; would cut the red pepper in half. On the cinnamon many have discussed/cut back: it didn't bother me but it did bother my daughter...said she didn't like her pineapple to taste like cinnamon.

This was really awesome! I added 1/2 teaspoon of ginger and instead of chili powder I increased the jerk seasoning to 1 1/2. I also added Browning which gave the dish a nice color. I served over white rice!

This was very good and different from my normal faire. I followed others' comments and only added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, added a red pepper and an onion, and served it over rice. Also, I don't know if it was my seasoning mix, which was the Pampered Chef Jamaican Jerk Rub, but it was plenty spicy without the red pepper flakes.

This was good. I took the advice of others and only added a dash of cinnamon. My only problem was it didn't make much sauce. I might add some coconut milk next time to make it saucier. Very good flavors though. I will try again and make a few changes.

I followed the recipe exactly, as I always do with a new recipe,  and found that it needed to have more sauce.  I later read TanjoJo's review and believe I would have been more pleased with the recipe had I used the her suggestion to add more sauce using the ingredients she used.  This does seem to go with rice better, and that is what I used.  Could not find dry Jerk seasoning in the stores, so I found a recipe for it on the web through Google.  The seasoning itself, and the other ingredients in the recipe, including the cinnamon, were pleasing to us, but then, we like cinnamon.

I made this for my husband last night.  He says "add to the top 10 list".  Of course, store didn't have coconut, so they had some kind of canned coconut juice.  Used that, some onion powder, garlic powder, McCormick Grill Mates Cinnamon Chipotle rub, and made more liquid using some powdered chicken broth, water, the coconut juice and corn starch.  After the pepper and onions were cooked, added that until thick and then put the cooked chicken back in.  Seemed to go better with rice, so I used rice.

Made this last night with some cut up chicken thighs (because that's what I had) and it was wonderful over some Jasmin rice.  I did cook chicken in coconut oil.  Will make with breasts for company in the future it is so good and so easy.   Thanks to your hubby.

I liked this a lot.  I made it with my best friend and I've made several changes each time I've made it.  I made it with and without the coconut and it tastes the same.  Though if you don't like the texture of coconut, you may want to make it without.  That's how I plan to make it from now on.  Also, I've added some cayenne pepper to give it a bit more of a spicy kick to it.

I wanted to have leftovers so I used three chicken breasts, added more pineapple and most of the juice from the 20 ounce can of pineapple I used, was generous with the spices, but halved the cinnamon and accidentally omitted the crushed red pepper. The dish was really spicy which I believe resulted from the jerk seasoning I used, but my husband and our friend loved it. I served this over rice and the only thing I will do differently next time is test the jerk seasoning before adding more.

I like things spicy so I increased the jerk seasoning and added green onions. Turned out awesome. I think adding some diced green and red peppers would make this even better. Also used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil to cook the chicken.

Great recipe! Packs some sweet heat. I didn't change a thing. If you simmer it for a bit before adding the pasta (or rice) the sauce thickens right up.   :)

I halved the cinnamon and added extra chili powder to taste.  I added some corn starched mixed with water to thicken it and served it over rice.  Awesome recipe! Thanks!

I just made this and thought it was great!  I took the advice of some and cut the cinnamon down a bit and it was great with that change.  It is on the spicy side, which we like.  I will definitely make this again!

Pretty tasty, new family favorite! I like a ton of flavor so I generally double most spices (made our own jerk seasoning without the cayenne since my daughter couldn't do too much heat) and started adding a diced onion and green pepper just to stretch the serving size and get more veggies in. Also, fresh pineapple works great, but you may want to add a bit more brown sugar to taste since it doesn't have as much juice to sweeten the batch. We usually serve it with rice, but again...personal preference. Great recipe as is and fun to experiment with. Thanks!

one of the few meals ive made in recent memory that ive actually been able to eat my entire serving of and go back for more. seriously enjoyed this. served it over some coconut lime rice instead of pasta because thats just weird... and used a 20oz can of pineapple chunks in juice instead of 8oz, eyeballed the spices, used less cinnamon than called for. perfectly delicious!

I followed others suggestions of cutting the cinn in 1/2 and my family doesn't like spicy food like I do so I left out the red pepper.  I served with rice instead of pasta & my family gave it a 4.5.  Even my picky eater really liked it.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent recipe!, I did mine in the slow cooker, browning the chicken in a skillet with the olive oil. I adding some red peppers & chopped onion and I also added some extra pineapple juice to help keep the chicken moist in the slow cooker, I did like others had mention and cut back on the cinnamon and used half of what the recipe called for. My husband LOVED it, we really like it served with rice!

I made this with coconut rice and it was fantastic! I cut the cinnamon in half and added onion, green peppers, and mushrooms. Will make again.

This recipe was just alright, I wouldn't make it again. The sauce was not thick enough, and was overly sweet. It was salvaged with some soy sauce and chili paste to add a balance of salt and spiciness, but we did not enjoy it as much as we would have hoped to.

Good recipe we'll be adding to the standard mix. Cut the cinnamon in half based on advice of other reviewers, and created jerk seasoning on-the-fly by using rough proportions from All Recipes. We did this with vegeterian chicken substitue over coconut rice. Yum. Even non-vegetarian husband loved it and wants to have it again.

I doubled the recipe and this was really good.  I made it with brown rice.  I read that there was too much liquid in some reviews so I simmered longer and that was a mistake.  There wasn't enough liquid so next time I will follow the review exactly.  Also - very spicy!

I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only difference was I cut in half both the cinnamon and the red pepper flake as some reviewers suggested. It was perfect. Sweet, and complex, with just the right amount of spice. Also, it was fantastically easy and fast. I served it over couscous so total cook time was about 30 min, including the 5 min for the couscous. This will become a common dish in my house.

I made this dish for me and my boyfriend and we both loved it! We added some extra red pepper flakes because we love spicy food but it still had the perfect blend of sweetness because of the pineapple! This will become a staple in our rotation for sure.

Made this for lunch yesterday and while the taste was okay, it was nothing to shout about.If I make this dish again, I would probably have to adjust the ingredients somewhat.
