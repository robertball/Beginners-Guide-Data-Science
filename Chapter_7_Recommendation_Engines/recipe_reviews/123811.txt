I really enjoyed this recipe However, the second time I made it I added a package of onion soup mix instead of onions,parsley leaves and seasoned salt. It was a real talk of the party. So if you are ever missing those ingredients mentioned above using onion soup mix works well.Just a helpful hint!

A good basic recipe, but for my personal tastes it was a little bland. After I added my own touches, I would give the recipe 4 or 4.5 stars. I doubled the parsley and dill. I also add some chopped garlic and fresh chives. Unfortunately, I didn't have seasoned salt so I made do with what I had on hand. I combined a little salt with thyme, paprika, and a pinch of curry powder. It came out delicious! I let the flavors meld in the fridge over night. I served it at our annual Halloween party with sliced cucumbers, carrots, bell peppers (all different colors), and cherry tomatoes. It looked simply beautiful and everyone loved it. Later on that night, we ate the leftovers with potato chips and sesame bread sticks during our horror movie marathon. It tasted really good with the chips and bread sticks as well. Over all, I think it is a nice recipe and I will definitely use it again with my own personal touches of course. But I think most recipes need to be adjusted to your own personal taste anyway! Thanks for the recipe! :)

This was very easy recipe to make.  I am not a mayonaise fan, but I really liked it in this dip.  I made the recipe exactly as stated.  It was very easy to put together with most ingredients I already had on hand.  I made it the night before my daughter's 5th birthday party and it tasted great the next day.  I think next time I might double the amount of onion I use because I really like onion, but otherwise a really simple and yummy dip.

This is pretty good.  I guess I changed it, now that I'm looking at this again bc I used dried minced onion.  It has been in my fridge for a few days and it has had time for the flavors to meld together.  It is good with my veggies, but there is really nothing that special about it.  Just a decent veggie dip.  Thanks.

This is a good,dependable,"count on me" veggie dip. First time making it, I used dried onion flakes instead-about 4-5T.  Everyone loved it, and it tasted very fresh. The second time making it, I didn't have onion or flakes, but used about 2 tsp onion powder and added a little lemon juice.  Just as good!  For a little zip, you could add a little hot sauce.

This is AWESOME!!!!!!! Love love love it!!! Huge hit!!! I doubled the recipe and used the advice of a fellow member and added 2 envelopes of Lipton Onion Soup Mix and omited the seasoned salt,parsley,and chopped onion. I also added 1 tabs. of Real Lemon Lemon Juice. Wow it hasn't even soaked in yet and it is fantastic! Cant wait to try it after it sits over night! I am going to try it also as directed later. I am curious to see which is better. I feel like the original recipe will have a lighter crisper flavor which is awesome in the summer. I also think lemon juice will add a special taste to it no matter which way you go. ENJOY!!!  Thanks!

5 stars for ease and taste.  Simple to make and delicious.  Added a little extra onion and dill because we like things strong.

Basic, serviceable dip that, because  it calls for ingredients generally on hand, can be whipped up at the spur of the moment as I did.  I liked that there was a higher proportion of sour cream to mayonnaise.  I used fresh dill and parsley and made the dip a few hours  before we ate it to allow the flavors to meld.  It did seem to make a difference.

Delicious!  There's no reason to buy dip anymore.  I didn't have seasoning salt so I used 1 tsp kosher salt and a couple shakes of paprika.  I also grated the onion.  It's excellent!

I went with another reviewers suggestion and used onion soup mix and dill instead of mixing all the other spices.  Turned out really good.  I'll be making this again.

I followed this recipe almost exactly. The only change ws I used green onions instead of a white or yellow onion. I find that they are much easier to mince than the others and have a fresh, mild taste. I was very happy with the results as I really didn't want to use dehydrated onions or a soup mix. Nice, unoffending seasonings - a crowd pleaser!

Why is this so good???  I guess the simplest things are really the best.  Yummier than even the packaged gourmet dips.

We thought this was a great all purpose dip recipe.  It was as good as something made with a package or some sort of mix, but without the MSG and other chemicals.  Will definitely make again.

This was really good.  I added 1 tsp. of celery seed and didn't have Beau Monde seasoning so I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/4 tsp salt instead.

We liked this, but felt it need more seasoning of some sort.  I did end up adding double the seasoned salt and dill, to suit our tastes.

I mixed this up with the last of my reduced fat sour cream so I could replace it with this week's couponing awesomeness. I did add a teaspoon of garlic and because I happen to be out of seasoning salt, I used 1/2 teaspoon Beau Monde seasoning. This was great to mix up and have it ready ASAP so I eat something healthy instead of my boys' weekend dip. I thought this was pretty good for a nice basic dill dip. Next time, I'd like to add some actually chopped green onion.

I had this recipe many years ago and lost it.  I "re-discovered" it and used it for a baby shower.  It was just as good as I remembered.  I made it the night before to let the flavors blend and intensify.  Plan to make it this weekend for a graduation party.  Very easy just right with crisp fresh veggies!
thanks!

This is WONDERFUL!  We made this dip along with ranch and french onion for the last baby shower we gave and noone touched the other two dips.  We ran out of this one and had to share the recipe almost everyone who attended.

I really suggest making this with fat free plain Greek yogurt (which is thicker, creamier and less tart than regular yogurt- we actually use it instead of sour cream even on things like tacos!) instead of the sour cream, and light mayo.  I use 1/2 t onion powder in place of the minced onion (easier!) and my seasoning salt of choice for this is Beau Monde.  The dip turns out really darn good, eaten either with veggies or chips, and 3 tablespoons only has about 50 calories.

This was a good recipe. It is nothing special from dill dip you might buy at the store, but it really came in handy this weekend when I forgot to buy dip for a party and found this recipe, which has basic ingredients that I usually have on hand. I will definitely make this again.

I made and served this dip a couple nights ago for my book club meeting and it was a BIG HIT! (Made it early afternoon for the 7:30 p.m. meeting so the flavors married well.) I served it with different raw veggies and also some sesame crackers. Really delicious!!

This was really good dip.  I used fat-free mayo and low-fat sour cream, and it was great.  I added a little paprika for color.  Didn't have dried parsley flakes, so used fresh parsley.  I assume the recipe called for dried dillweed, which is what I used.  Very tasty and a nice change from ranch dip!

I love this recipe!  It's quick and easy.  My mom used to make this when we were growing up, (except for the parsley flakes.)  I like using half a cup of mayo, it doesn't have a strong mayo taste then as with the other dill dip recipes.

5 Stars for a great dill recipe.  I've now made this 3 times.  First time, almost completely by directions, the only change I made the first time was using green onion instead of onion.  Found it to be a little salty, but as other reviewers have stated, depends on the seasoned salt you use (not to mention your taste buds).  Second time halved the seasoned salt and added a bit of garlic powder and used green onion again. Perfect for my taste,  Third time used the 2nd method again.  Tonight I'm making it again, bit I'm going to try the Greek Yogurt 1/2 cup, sour cream 1/2 cup and mayo 1/2 cup.  Experimenting with getting healthier dips for my veggies.  Will update later.

This turned out great! I used fresh parsley, but that's pretty much the only changes I made. I think it would taste better if it sat for awhile, but it was still delicious.  Dipped veggies in it, but also dipped the Baked French Fries from this site.

This is an excellent dip, easy to make and really good flavor. I made it using dehydrated onion flakes in place of the chopped onion, but otherwise made it as per the recipe. I made a large batch for a dinner we hosted for 50+ people. There was none left at the end of the night!

Very good dip recipe.  I needed to make a quick dip but didn't have a ranch packet on hand.  This one is great to make in a hurry because I had all of the ingredients in my cupboard.  I used 1 TBSP dried minced onion instead of fresh and it turned out great.

This was great, and I made it almost as is - I added a bit more seasoning than on the recipe since I wanted more flavor.  However, I did find that it tasted a lot better after it sat for a while so if you can, make it at least an hr in advance.

This was ok. I added the onion dip as others sugg and I also added about 1/4 cup more sour cream, not the zip I am looking for thanks. I also added Pampered Chef dill, which did give it a great dill taste

Good. Easy. Can't find pre-made dips in the country I'm in, so it was a nice, easy one to whip up.

This is a great tastey dip that you can make up in a hurry.  It is best if it can sit for several hours before serving.

This dip is fresh and tasty. I find it tastes better after sitting in the fridge for a day or two.

I had friends over and the dip was gone so fast. Everyone loved it!
