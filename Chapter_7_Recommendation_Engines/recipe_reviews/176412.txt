This recipe turned out fabulous!  The only thing different that I did, was that I pat tried the turkey with papertowels and then rubbed the herb butter all over it.  I baked it breast side down for 2 hrs.  Then I reapplied the remaining herb butter and then turned the bird breast side up, both sides were roasted, with crispy skin and the breast meat was tender and juicy.  Everyone raved about the flavor.  The base made an incredible gravy.

I love this recipe, this is how I have been making chicken and turkey for years. However, I stuff the bird with a couple of sprigs of whatever herbs I'm using and lemon, onion, and garlic. Don't even bother peeling just half them and stuff them in there then discard before serving. It really enhances the flavor of the turkey because everything inside it gives another dimension of flavor.

I am a vegetarian, so was kind of worried about making Thanksgiving Turkey for all of me friends that are away from family... This recipe looked simple and easy, I made it, and everyone loved it!! They all said it was jiucy and flavourful.  I did not change anything, basted ALOT, every 30 mins or so... looked awesome.. almost made me eat meat for the first time in 10 years!!

I used this recipe (with a few tweaks of course) for my Thanksgiving turkey and got rave reviews. I stuff the cavity of the bird with a quartered onion, apple, and orange, along with some celery, carrots, and crushed garlic cloves. Then I butter the bird generously, and put some chicken or turkey stock in the bottom of the roasting pan, and baste the bird every 45 minutes or so. The bird was tender and juicy, the turkey skin was crispy, and the drippings made an awesome gravy. I'll be making every turkey like this from now on. Can't wait for next Thanksgiving LOL.

Tasted good but personally I was expecting a lot more flavor. It was incredibly juicy though. I tried to pull the drumstick off, but the bone just slid right out of the meat!

I cooked this in an electric roaster pan and had to take the grate out at the bottom to make it fit.  I did put the butter under the skin as well as rubbed it on the outside.  It didn't come out as beautifully brown as I hoped, but the taste was really good and it was really moist.  I used a turkey from West Wind Farms and real butter and dried herbs.  I cooked it 2 1/2 hours breast side down and basted it like crazy, every 20-30 minutes...

I baked my first turkey using this recipe and it turned out very moist and juicy.  Everyone loved it.  I did not use fresh herbs because of price and I already had the dried version in my cabinet.

This is the best turkey I have ever made! I followed other readers' advice and threw a quartered onion, plus a couple cloves of chopped garlic inside the bird. Wow! what a difference. I've already been asked to make the turkey again because the leftovers disappeared so fast!

I can't even begin to say how proud I was over my first Thanksgiving turkey- This recipe helped make it happen! I also used 'Apple Turkey Brine' from Godiva Goddess- *If using the brine, wash turkey off & pat with paper towels before applying herb butter marinade; use light salt and pepper*

This was my first time cooking a turkey and it turned out great. I took the advice of other reviewers and added all the herbs to softened butter in a baggie and then rolled it and refrigerated it again to harden. Sliced it up and put the slices of herb butter underneath the skin. Also rubbed some of the butter all over the outside. I cooked the turkey breast side down and turned over for the last hour, basting every 30 minutes. Came out very tasty...especially the dark meat!

AWESOME!

This bird roasted so perfectly with such tremendous flavor and was absolutely beautiful coming out of the oven.  I am a firm believer in roasting turkeys and NOT using the bag and this recipe is so easy and so great you will see why you should give up those bags!
