I am very picky when it comes to meats and meatballs in general.I have to say that the title does not lie.I think these are the best meatballs i ever had.Since finding the recipe a feew months ago I have made them at least a dozen times.I did a few things different though.I added one extra clove of garlic per half pound of beef.I also did not follow the directions very well and actually mixed the butter and olive oil right into the whole mixture.I also added grated parmesan cheese as well...I then put them in a shallow glass baking dish with vegetable spray and baked them in the oven on 370 for 15 minuntes.After this I take them out along with all the juices in the bottom of the dish and cook them in plain old spaghetti sauce for about 15 minutes.The flavor goes into the sauce and is AMAZING.The meatballs end up being so tender that they just fall apart.I also made these for my girlfriend and she loved them just as much...THANKS ALOT for this awesome recipe! One of my favorite things to cook now !!!!!

These are awesome meatballs!!! My husband has had me make them 5 times in the last week. Instead of frying them....I place them on a broiler pan and bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Then I broil them for 5 mintes, flip them and broil another 5 minutes. They are perfect!!! I hate meatballs, but the first time I made them my husband and I were fighting over the last few.....we eat them with nothing on them....we would not want to ruin a perfect flavor!  Thanks for a great recipe!

PS- I have tried them on the stove and I agree with the other posts...do these in the oven and you will not be sorry...this is the best...made them again tonight and did it all in the food processor I got for Mothers day....try them....they ROCK!!!

Best texture, YES!  Melt in your mouth meatballs!  Best tase, NO WAY!!  These were spicy which was ok but the mustard and worcestshire was way too much!  Next time I'll omit mustard and use maybe 1 TBSP worcestshire.  I ran out and used less than 2 TBSP this time and it was still overpowering.  I will also cut the spices in half next time, I prefer good flavor over spiciness.  Also used the oven.

Yep! They're right! These are the *best*! I baked mine in the over for 30 minutes at 350 rather than on the stove. We really enjoyed these!

I had to make a few changes based on what I had, but still excellent overall.  We like spicy food, so I didn't think this recipe would disappoint.   I had a huge quantity of ground chuck to use up today so I made a double batch. 

I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs rather than the crushed croutons.   I also used Spicy Brown mustard rather than yellow.  This recipe seemed to call for too much Worch. sauce but it worked and possibly is the key to the moisture of this recipe.  I baked these for 20 minutes at 375F, on foil lined baking trays.  I should have swapped the trays positions after 10 minutes as one tray was more done that the other, but no biggie. 

They had a nice kick but didn't seem overwhelming to me.  I wasn't sure what Cajun Spice was, and I had a lot of spices in store, so I used one packet of Emeril's essence for a double batch of these meatballs.   The meatballs are currently being "individually" frozen on the same trays so I can bag them for later.  

Thanks for a nice addition to my recipe file.

Mmm...very tasty. Instead of crushed croutons, I crushed ritz crackers and added some dried parsley and basil. I used Creole seasoning instead of Cajun, and my mustard was of the dijon variety. Instead of cooking them on a skillet (no patience for that constant turning), I baked them in the oven at 350 degrees for 35 minutes and they turned out perfectly. The end result was very good and I will definitely make these again.

These are absolutely delicious. At first when I saw some of the ingredients (mustard, red pepper flakes), I thought, these can't be good in spaghetti sauce. But they're great! All of the flavors of these particular ingredients blend together so well that they'll probably be good in any sauce. I've used them in spaghetti and also a ketchup/brown sugar/Worcestershire  sauce. They're outstanding! I did not pan fry these, though. I just put them under the broiler for about 15-20 minutes, and then tossed them into my sauce. Also, I don't keep any Cajun seasoning on hand, so I just used good old salt and pepper. Works every time!!!

My husband, who usually doesn't care for meatballs with his spaghetti, declared these the best (even better than his grandma's).  I was worried that the cajun spice wouldn't compliment the spaghetti sauce, but it was fine.  I used very lean ground beef, browned the meatballs in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes, and let them finish cooking in a slow cooker with homemade spaghetti sauce for 2 hours.

I had to substitute extra bread crumbs for croutons, and used cayenne pepper. I also, because I just have always liked the flavor it adds to meatballs, added 2 tbs of brown sugar (adds some sweetness to the spice) It was added to our spaghetti sauce, and it was an H E double hockey sticks of a meal! Thanks for the recipe!

We weren't fans. The Cajun spice didn't work for us, nor did the overwhelming taste of mustard. If you were to remove those two items, you would be left with a bland product. They fared slightly better when served with a brown gravy than they did with tomato sauce and pasta, with which the flavor was decidedly incongruous. They left a very strange aftertaste, and after trying them those two ways, hoping to salvage them, we ended up cutting our losses and pitching them.

These were good, omitted the hot spices. There's a little kept secret Italians use when making meatballs...add a about 1/3 cup of water, yes water, to your meatballs. Raw meatballs should feel wet and soft, and you'll be amazed that your cooked meatballs will come out soft and tender, not dry. Try it, you'll be amazed.

Incredible!  Second time I've made these and got rave reviews again!  A few minor modifications-used seasoned bread crumbs instead of croutons, doubled the recipe and used 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb hot Italian sausage but omitted red pepper flakes since I used the hot sausage.  Also added 1/4 cup(ish) of diced green pepper. Used a pampered chef cookie dough type scoop to make them (sooooooooooooooooooooooo easy and fast!) and baked 20 minutes at 350!  Incredible!

Awesome!!! I stuck to the recipe as-is, and tossed them into my crocked spaghetti sauce for an hour after they were done browning in the skillet. By FAR the BEST meatballs my family has ever had, they are still licking their plates! My husband gives it an A+!

These really are the best I have had!! I am impressed!! I love garlic, so 3 cloves sounded better to me and I used shallots instead of onion because I had them and they have a sweet delicate flavor. I Cut back on the worchester to 1 Tbsp and 1 tsp on the mustard. I added about 1/4 cup grated parmesan. I baked them at 350 for 30 min., so didn't need to use the olive oil or butter. They turned out perfect and are an awesome stand alone snack. They made my spaghetti over the top!! Thanks for the great recipe. Try these!!

These meatballs are definitely delicious.  I have been asked for the recipe multiple times and my husband wont eat spaghetti without them anymore.  I did change a few things though.  I left out the mustard as I don't care for it and used Italian bread crumbs instead of crushed croutons because that's what I had on-hand.  I also followed the advice of fellow reviewers and baked them in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes.  Way easier than the stove I would just recommend lining your pan with foil for easier cleanup.  Thanks for a great recipe the flavor is amazing.

I made these meatballs exactly as stated. They are quite good, but not the best I have ever tasted. We ate them alone; they were flavorful enough to do that! Next time I will try them in a meatball sandwich with pizza sauce and mozzerella cheese. The texture (soft inside) is different than I am used to, but definitely not dry. We did not think they were too spicy - they could even use a bit more spice if used as an appetizer. Thanks for the recipe!

These were pretty good.  Be sure to crushe the croutons AFTER you measure out the 3/4 cup.  The mustard flavor is a tiny bit too strong.  I baked mine for 40 minutes at 350.

I would agree with the title of this recipe- these are the best I've had! We'll never buy frozen meatballs again. A few things I adjusted to fit my family: I always saute the onions and garlic first, and substitute ground turkey to lower the fat. Actually with all the flavor in these you can hardly tell the difference when I use turkey. I bake them at 350 for 20 minutes instead of frying them, and triple the batch to freeze the extras for a quick weeknight meal.

I was a little suspicious of the recipe name but I have to agree. They were wonderful. I was planning a large family gathering and wanted something I could make ahead and re-heat the day of the party. These seemed to fit the bill.   I did a test run for friends ahead of time. I'm glad I did! Everyone loved the meatballs but my 91 & 92 year old grand parents would not have liked the red pepper flakes. I omitted that ingredient from the version I served my family.   I baked the meatballs rather than frying since I was making these for 17 people and time was an issue. Everyone asked to take home leftovers!

These were really good.  I did not have crutons so I had to substitute breadcrumbs.  I did a batch with ground meat and a batch with turkey.  Both were very flavorfull.   We will definitely be making these again!!  Thanks for the Recipe.

Fitting title! I NEVER enjoy meatballs, but these could be addictive! I baked them at 375 for about 18 minutes on a foil-lined pan. If your meat is very lean, I would recommend greasing the pan (wish I did). I also think I will mix a little more next time; generally the rule is to be gentle with ground meat to avoid toughness, but undermixing these balls leaves them so tender they fall apart. Oops, I forgot the Cajun seasoning, and I had to leave out the pepper flakes on account of the little guys, but it was flavorful and well-spiced nonetheless. The dominant taste is indeed mustard and worcestershire (so do use a good kind- I used the classic "Lea & Perrins"), which is actually a better combination than you would expect. However, if worcestershire or yellow mustard is something you are absolutely certain you do not enjoy, then I think halving both of those, or just the mustard, would be fine. Next time I am going to try a different mustard.

I have never made meatballs before so I decided to go with this one as my first timer. Let me just say that there are no words to say how wonderful these actually were. I was so impressed!! We like spicy foods so the spices worked in nicely. I also made them in the oven like the others suggested and they  came out perfectly. Thanks a bunch for this recipe. I will make these again...Yummmmmy!!

I love these meatballs. I do without the butter and substitute a few drops of hot sauce for the Cajun seasoning. Also possible to bake in the oven. Enjoy!

These were great!  I omitted the red pepper due to being afraid it was going to be too spicy for the kids.  I used the crushed croutons, but I think next time I will use breadcrumbs.  I made a batch and froze a batch for future use!

Doubled this recipe and pretty much followed to a T.  The only changes I made were to use loads of onion powder in place of the raw onion-I was afraid they would be crunchy, and that my 4 yr old might protest.  :). Also baked at 350 for 30 minutes instead of frying.  Turned out good.   Not the best I have ever had, but definitely good enough to use this recipe again.   Oh, and I served mine with a homemade onion and mushroom gravy on the side.  Very comforting!!

My husband who does not like meatballs loved these. They were moist and wonderful. I sauteed on the stove then popped in the oven for 15 mins at 350° then topped with homemade spaghetti sauce and cooked for another 15 mins. Fabulous!

On basis of the reviews I made a double batch of these. Don't be afraid of the spice here...the combination works very well. The only alteration I made was baking at 375 instead of sauteeing. Very flavorful and with terrific texture! Next time I will probably add parmesan cheese...thank you!

Very Very good. Best I have managed so far. But... there seems to be a lack of a Italian herbal zing zing to the taste.

This was my first attempt at making meatballs, and they turned out great! Instead of beef I used ostrich (yes, ostrich ... the taste and texture are identical to beef, but much healthier and leaner). The spices combined well and the texture was great!

We didn't care for the taste of these meatballs. They did not mix well with pasta sauce & were over-seasoned as written. The large amount of Worchechire (okay, I've never spelled it out) sauce made a funky taste - kinda sour. Not what I want in a meatball sandwich. Edible, not delicious - sorry...

Great flavor.  Very spicy.  I might cut the red pepper flakes down just a bit next time.  I made these small for appetizers and used the sauce from Cocktail Meatballs I and they got rave reviews.  I baked them in the oven for about 20 minutes at 350°, poured the sauce over them and put them in the refrigerator overnight.  The next day a couple hours before my party I put them in a crock pot to cook on low.  Very easy make ahead appetizer for a party.  Will definitely make them again.

Cheers to you Bearnesta!  My family devoured these meatballs.  I really enjoyed the little zip I got from the hot pepper flakes and cajun seasoning.  I have been making the same old italian type meatballs for years and needed a change. Yours are wonderful, tasty and exactly the change I needed! ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!

A great tasting recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I did have trouble sauteing them so in the future I will cook them in the oven at 350° for 15 minutes, then add them to my homemade spaghetti sauce where they can simmer for a while. I plan on adding this to my regular rotation.

We had these meatballs in a marinara sauce on top of spaghetti.  I did take a different approach to cooking these.  I first browned them on the stove and then cooked them in the sauce in my slow cooker.  They were very moist and tender.  The only thing we didn't care for was the Cajun seasoning.  But that may be because we were looking for more of an Italian flavor to go with the sauce instead of a Cajun one.  Still a really easy, great meatball recipe.

My family loved these meatballs. As suggested by another reviewer I actually mixed the butter and olive oil right into the whole mixture. I then put them in a shallow glass baking dish with vegetable spray and baked them in the oven on 370 for 15 minuntes.After this I take them out along with all the juices in the bottom of the dish and cook them in plain old spaghetti sauce for about 15 minutes.  I received rave reviews.  In the future, I would like to use a meat mix that includes ground beef, pork and lamb that is available at my grocery store.  Very good!

I guess I'm one of the odd girls out. I did't care for these at all. I like spicy but I didn't care for the spices in this recipe. I would leave out the mustard and cajun spice just because it didn't give it a good taste. I was so excited to make them because I'm having a spaghetti and meatball dinner for about 30 people for my husbands birthday and I wanted to make a good impression. I'm glad I tried the recipe first. I baked them on 350 for about 40 minutes and that turned out okay.

I agree that this is a GREAT recipe!  I omitted the red pepper flakes, just because I'm not sure how my 5 year old would react.  Maybe on a mom and dad night I'll make this with them, just to see!  But everybody in the house loved them!  These would be PERFECT for use on a meatball sandwich.  I love that they're not the traditional meatball with thyme and basil and blah blah blah!  Loved it!

I was looking for Italian meatballs. This makes a better hamburger which is probably what I will do next time with this recipe.  The kids enjoyed it but it wasn't what my husband wanted me to make with lasagna.

We did not care for these.  I followed the recipe, except I baked them.  I think it could be due to the large amount of worcestershire sauce, but I'm not wasting my time to try it again with less!

I would not say these are the best I have ever tasted, but they are pretty good. I only have dijon in the house so I substituted the yellow mustard for that. Plus no sweet onions in the house so I used green onions instead. I probably could have left those out. Other then that, I crushed my own fresh garlic and baked in the oven until done and placed them in my spagheti sauce. I like the use of crutons though. I will try these again but a little different next time.

I thought these were really good!  I did'nt add any of the red pepper flake for the fear of them being too spicy for the kiddos.  I browned them on the stove top and finished them off in the spaghetti sauce.  They were so tender and moist!  Great recipe!

Yum!!! These were so good and moist. I left out the red pepper flakes and cajun seasoning. I also cut back the Worcesterchire sauce to 1 tablespoon since there were complaints about it being too strong. In place of yellow mustard I used spicy brown mustard. And I also substitued minced onion for chopped onion and garlic powder for garlic cloves. I baked these for 30 minutes on 350, flipping them half way through.

The only change I did was 3/4 cup crushed up spicy pork rinds in place of breadcrumbs because I'm on a low carb diet.  My mom dunked hers in barbeque sauce. Delicious!

These meatballs have incredible flavor.  I doubled the recipie and only put in one and a half tsp. of red pepper; they were spicy and good.  I took the advice of other posters and baked them at 350 for 30 minutes.  Once cooked, I added them to my basic spaghetti sauce and simmmered it for about an hour.  I decided that I'd make meatball hoagies.  Yummy!  Once the meatballs and sauce were done cooking, I split up some good, crusty bagettes, added the meatballs a little sauce, motzerella and parmesean.  Incredible.  Everyone  loved them and I have left overs for spaghetti.

very good recipe!  i was missing some ingredients, so i used what i had and they still turned out really well.  i baked mines for 25 min at 375 degrees instead of frying...frying meatballs takes forever and you have to keep turning them, plus they get super greasy.  baking solves these problems!  you can freeze them up for later use, too!  highly recommended!

Very good and moist. I baked at 350 for 25 minutes and they were perfect. As a family who likes spicy food, I found them a little too spicy. I would cut the red pepper flakes in half. If you are a family who doesn't like spicy food, cut it out altoghter, as the cajun seasoning and other stuff adds plenty of kick. I will be using this recipe from now on...

Ew ew ew!!!!  The texture was ok, but the taste... lets just say I disagree with the other reviewers!  I love mustard, but thought the taste was grossly overpowering here.  Not good at all.  Thanks anyway, but I will never make these again.  They went in the trash.

Not good. Both my husband and I are Italian and I have several meatball recipes. When trying these, I did not expect them to resemble meatballs, in the traditional Italian sense. That being said, the texture was off and the flavors did not blend at all. I am sorry, but I don't think these would fair well in any kind of sauce or recipe.

Wow, these were really good!  I also baked them (less time-consuming) and followed the recipe exactly, except a added a few shakes of Italian seasoning.  The great thing about these is that they are really versatile; you can throw them in marinara, BBQ sauce, gravy, etc.  Thanks for sharing this!

I cooked them in the oven like other reviewers suggested... 400 degrees for about 15 minutes... then simmered them in sauce for about ten minutes. They came out very good, I will be making these again.

This really was the "Best Meatball" I'd ever had!! Great flavor. Next time if I don't have any fresh onion on hand,I may try substituting minced onion...we'll see.

I always say that meatballs and sandwiches are alike.  It's hard to mess them up but to make them amazing is even harder!  Well - these meatballs are AMAZING!!!  

I had a few additions of my own but the Worcestershire sauce and the mustard really brought this together!!  I'm deathly allergic to pepper of any kind (weird I know) so I left out the Cajun seasoning and the red pepper flakes and instead stepped it up on the garlic as well as used spicy mustard instead of regular.  Also, because I didn't have croutons or Italian breadcrumbs (I simply grated dried out whole wheat buns) - I added a whole bunch of different seasoning to taste (eg: basil, marjoram, cumin, parsley, etc - just pick what smells good to you!).  I also caramelised the onion before mixing it in(I didnt measure it to 1/4 cup but simply used the entire onion of medium size).  I made the mistake of adding a bunch of salt because I forgot that the mustard and the Worcestershire sauce would have lots in it.  It wasnt bad and definitely add some, as the recipe doesnt mention any but just remember about the other ingredients  ;)  And of course a touch of cheese, I did not have parmesan so I used grated gouda.  

And finally, just as everyone had mentioned, I baked them in the oven at 350 for 25min and then scraped the meatballs and the juice from the pan and into the saucepan with the pasta sauce - YUM YUM 1,000 times YUM!!

The Best Meatballs You'll Ever Have Haiku: "Title challenges. But these can't quite meet that boast. Not bad, but not great." 1. Cajun Seasoning doesn't jive w/ yellow mustard and meatballs. 2. Totally falling apart when cooking in skillet (Maybe I should've baked?) 3. These can't compare to AR's "Meatball Nirvana." I'm glad that I had super-tasty homemade spaghetti sauce to eat these with, or I would've been even more disappointed.

These were very good!  I made them in the oven using a broiler pan and then simmered them in store bought sauce.  The meatballs were great but what they did to the sauce was incredible.  The only things I changed was that I used a little less cajun seasoning and Italian bread crumbs instead of croutons.  I will definitley make again.

I used venison burger and tossed half of the meat balls in baby rays BBQ and the other half in sweet chilli sause.  Both were fantastic.  Also, I make 6 pounds at a time and either refreeze the mix or pre-cook the meatballs and freeze just like the bag of meat balls you buy at costco only 10 times better (no offense costco cause I love ya)

Not bad! Still not my moma's meatballs, but these were prolly the best I've tried on here so far. :) Going into this, I wasn't sure how I'd like a spicy flavored MB paired with traditional marinara sauce. To my surprise, these weren't that different from a plain 'ol MB - just more flavorful! As Kevin did, I too cooked my MB's in a 370 degree oven for 15 minutes (I sprayed them with Pam cooking spray to ensure they'd crisp up a bit since I was skipping the pan frying step), then in simmering sauce for another 15 minutes. I didn't have much grease to add to the sauce, but I attribute that to using semi-lean beef. I did not add any cheese since my Italian seasoned croutons tasted very Parmy (is that even a word???). Served over spaghetti with a fresh grating of Romano cheese, a side salad and homemade garlic bread. Needless to say, my hubs and I barely had any energy to clean up afterwards! Thanks for sharing, Bearnesta. Your meatballs were very filling! :-)

This definitely has a kick...it is spicy, but more medium than hot.  I baked these on an aluminum foil covered pan for 25 mins....they had an internal temperature of 165 degrees.   I put them in spaghetti sauce and simmered for a few minutes.  Then put them on a bed of spaghetti.  Very flavorful.

These were very tasty and easy to make, but I thought they were a bit dry (probably overcooked). I will make these again but will try changing the cook time.

These seriously are the best meatballs! I am in college and I LOVE to cook, bake and try out new recipes (as does my boyfriend love that I do!). There were a major hit in his house! The first time I made these I tried to bake some to make them "healthier" but didn't taste as good as the one's that were pan-friend. The second time around I added more mustard because my boyfriend and I loved the mustard flavor to it with the spiciness. They tasted AMAZING. We pan fried them and just ate them as was! YUM! The next time that I make these I am going to try to make them with ground turkey instead of ground beef to make them a bit healthier :)

OH SO GOOD!  Wonderful recipe as written.  I was out of worcestershire sauce and used steak sauce as a substitute.  It was wonderful!  Give these a try!  I like to make a double batch and freeze the extra.

Came out great, ommitted red pepper due to others tastes, but I ended up eatting them all myself, will add it next time.  Also did the bake method 375 for 20 min or so.  Great by themselves no need for sauce.

Yummy meatballs that were seasoned perfectly.  The only change I will make next time will be to saute the onions and garlic in some olive oil first.  It's just a personal preference for taste and texture. I like soft onions. Thanks for such a great recipe.  :)

YES. These were MONEY. Because I am watching my carb count, I used 1/4 c. homemade whole wheat croutons and 1/2 c. parmesan cheese. I also used two egg whites instead of one whole egg. I was out of my homemade cajun seasoning so I used 2 tsp. of Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute. I didn't fry these in oil, I baked them at 350 for a half hour and drained all the grease off. SUPER yummy. Really great with the Best Marinara Sauce Yet, which is also from this site. Really held up well.

I enjoyed these but the family thought they were too spicy. Also I baked them so they were a bit rubbery, but  I'm sure the texture would have been a LOT better if they were fried.

Good recipe. I substituted bread crumbs for croutons and baked the meatballs instead.

Yo, these are killer!  I'm Italian, so I added 1/4 lb of sausage and halved the Worchestershire Sauce to avoid an overly salty taste.  Also, browned them in a fry pan for 10 min. and baked at 325 for 20 min.  The texture is better.  Also, added a bit of red wine to the sauce to combat the sweet taste of the sausage.  Gangbusters!!!

These came out fantastic!  I just prepared these for tomorrow's dinner, but had to make a small one to taste.  I was a little apprehensive about the yellow mustard, but it really complimented the flavors quite well.  I cooked the meatballs in a cast iron skillet and will drop them in the sauce tomorrow, but really- these don't even need a sauce.  Great addition to my recipe box! Thanks!!

Very nice indeed. I was surprised by how subtle the flavours turned out, considering the huge quantities of mustard and Worcestershire sauce included, but they all mellowed out to produce some fairly mellow meatballs. For a lack of croutons I instead used toasted brown bread, blitzed in a processor, and toned down the mustard, as I believe that the yellow mustard in America is quite a bit less potent than yellow 'English' mustard.  I'm fairly sure that these are not the best possible meatballs, but they are definitely the best I've had. All in all, definitely worth having, and don't be put off by the quantities of the ingredients.

The taste was good, and it wasn't too difficult, but the cooking method was not my favorite. They didn't stay nice and round. Some fell apart, and they didn't look appealing. That being said, my family liked them, and I will make it again.

Wow, loved the spiciness of these meatballs.  I made only a few changes.  Used Italian style breadcrumbs instead of croutons (simpler) and reduced the amount to 1/2cup.  I used 1TBSP of Worcestershire sauce instead of 3.  Per other reviewer’s suggestion, I baked my meatballs instead of sautéing.  Pre-heated the oven to 350° and baked for 15 minutes, immediately transferred the meatballs to my sauce.  My spaghetti sauce was a bit sweeter than I like, these spicy meatballs balanced the flavor out perfectly.  Plan to make large meatballs for meatball sandwiches.

Sorry, can't say I agree... For some reason the mustard taste really stands out. I did bake them to make it easier to prepare, and went light on the red pepper flakes because of the kids.

I thought these were good but not anything special. Be warned that these pack some heat (a good thing in my opinion!) because of the red pepper flakes and Cajun seasoning.

The name is true!  I used ground bison instead of ground beef.  We had these plain on hamburger buns.  My husband loved them and said they reminded him of the White Castle hambugers he used to have in college!  Will use this recipe again!

I debated between 4 and 5 stars, mostly because of the recipe's title. I'd say these are the best meatballs I've ever made but not the best I've ever tasted (restaurant). But these are really great. I combined this recipe with a recipe I adapted years ago from my mother's recipe--1/2# ground chuck and 1/2# ground pork, crackers rather than croutons, no Cajun spices (didn't have any), and no red pepper flakes (too strong). The meatballs were excellent with the pasta I made but were outstanding in meatball subs the next day--absolutely delicious. I think the worchestershire and mustard really add to the flavor. Next time, I'll experiment with a little ground red pepper, not flakes. I think it might blend better (no hot spots), and I'll get some Cajun seasoning--might as well follow the recipe (almost) exactly now that I have a good sense of it from my adaptation.

very moist and incredibly tasty. I omitted the red pepper for the sake of my toddlers but think that would have made them even better. Next time I'll make two batches to freeze.

These meatballs definitely promise what they deliver.  I didn't have any cajun seasoning, so I omitted it entirely.  In place of the croutons, I used Progresso Garlic and Herb Bread Crumbs and sprinkled the red pepper flakes in to my personal taste.  I am putting this in my recipe box and will definitely make these again and again!

Good.  The "best"?  I wouldn't say so, but a fairly tasty recipe.  I would like to have had some sort of sauce covering them or for dipping (perhaps should have come up with something myself) as they just needed "something".  I'll keep looking and/or tweeking this recipe to find a sauce; perhaps a worcestershire sauce with butter and ??

We really enjoyed this - very hearty, savory, distinctive flavor that needs no sauce or pasta.  I've made them twice -- the first time exactly as the recipe stated, and the second time I used bread crumbs instead of croutons and baked/broiled them in the oven.  I feel that while it is harder to cook on the stove top, and my poor meatballs looked more like meat cubes when I was done, they tasted better than the oven/bread crumb version because they had a beautiful seared crust that added to the overall flavor.  I will also reduce the amount of red pepper because it was hard to distribute evenly throughout the mixture, and one in five meatballs had a hidden spice surprise! Overall, an outstanding combination of flavors that, regardless of your cooking method, make meatballs worth the effort!  YUM!

Wow! These are awesome! I just made these meatballs and so far have eaten 2, just to "test" them :).They're super moist and have such a nice flavor, nothing to strong but not at all bland.

The only things I did differently were to use bread crumbs instead of croutons, omit the red pepper flakes (I had none), and bake them at 350 for 20 minutes, then broiled for 5 minutes. I can't wait to serve them for dinner!

I've been making the same meatball recipe for years and fancied a change. This was a good choice. I did omit the mustard but otherwise followed the recipe. I also went with other reviewers and baked them for 25 minutes and didn't find them dry at all. My husband and daughter loved the slight spiciness in these. Whilst I'll still use my old recipe from time to time, this one will also be on my menu again. Many Thanks.

Spaghetti and meatballs was what the family asked for...and this recipe delivered! Delicious! I had to use Italian seasoning instead of Cajun (not on hand) and I baked them first, then browned in the skillet. Everyone loved these.

My family really enjoyed these! I just used the last batch out of the freezer and plan on making more this weekend. Made them last night using a milk gravy as a sauce with garlic mashed potatoes. My husband took some to work and just called to let me know I need to give him 3 copies of the recipe. Thanks again for posting this.

Awesome recipe!  I made a three minor changes:  substituted seasoned bread crumbs for the crutons, and grated the onion (extra moisture and flavor from the juice) and garlic into the meat mixture.  We're native New Mexicans and lots of garlic, onios and spice works for us!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I am not a meatball fan but my husband is, so I made these for him & my whole family loved them so much! Now, I am a meatball fan! I will make these again & again.  I followed the recipe closely except I omitted the red pepper - I have little ones who don't like spicy & I baked them at 350 for about 20 min. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!

oh my god! How good are these? I just finished. I followed the recipe pretty closely. I added some ground pork to it to give it some more flavor and didn't have red pepper flakes so I used chilli pepper. But they are moist, with a hint of spice to them. I put half of them in my spaghetti sauce and I'm leaving the other half for meatball subs. yumm.

Great Recipe!  I used ground meat from a hog that I killed last year and I also baked the meatballs in the oven as others had suggested.  350 for 35 min.  They were very tender and very flavorful.

Not the best ever, but certainly worthy of 5 stars, imo. I enjoyed them earlier for dinner, but I just sneaked one cold (!), several hours later, and they tasted even better! I thought I should double the amount of Cajun seasoning as it's been in the cupboard a while. I served these with the sauce from the 'Italian Spaghetti Sauce with Meatballs' recipe, and 'Garlic Bread Mama Rita's Way' (both were very good). Thanks!

These were excellent, but I should have read the reviews first because I think that baking them would have made them turn out better.  They would also be less greasy.  I didn't have any red pepper flakes, but that was okay because as I thought the cajun spices (Tony Cachere's)by itself was delicious, although I added an extra 1/2 tablespoon to the recipe.   Also, I didn't think that there was enough bread crumbs, so I think next time I will add 1 cup of seasoned breadcrumbs instead.  I think that it will make them better!

mmm, very good, although I didn't have any cajun seasoning or red pepper flakes, I left them out and cooked the meatballs with a chicken and mushroom gravy.

These were not the best meatballs, but they were good. A word to the wise, if you don't like really spicy foods cut back on the red pepper flakes. I didn't use the Cajun seasoning, and I added basil and parsley to them.

This was AMAZING! I didn't use as much garlic because we used the recipe but we have 8 kids so we needed more hamburger, using 3 lbs rather than 1. The recipe called for 6 cloves of garlic, I love garlic but that was way to much. I only used 3. I also diced them very small and used another reviews idea and sauteed my onions....and garlic together, then added them to the meat so this way the garlic and onions weren't hard within the meatballs, they were very soft. And if you're like me, when you eat garlic, you don't want a mouth full of hard garlic pieces that just ruins the bite. And because we don't keep cajun seasoning or red pepper flakes on hand, I used chili powder instead, and just used one tablespoon of it, in place of both seasonings. I also substituted the crushed seasoned croutons with bread I toasted and then broke up with my own personal seasoning. Which idk if you have this, but Adolph's "seasoned" Meat Tenderizer. They have a red capped bottle and a yellow capped bottle and if you ever cook steaks or any meat, this is an amazing topper to put on while you are cooking, not just to allow it to sit with the tenderizer on it. I used the adolph's "yellow capped" seasoning in my toast crumbs. It was very good! I also didn't have the time or patience for cooking on the stove, I have a big family so I tripled the recipe, had way to many meatballs to cook to do that, so I placed them on a cookie sheet! 350 for 35 minutes. They turned out AMAZING! Picky kids, No problem!

Use the "Cajun seasoning recipe" from this website, rather than store bought. You won't regret it. Also, used a mix of ground pork, beef and veal (a meatloaf mix) which made the meatballs even more tender. I bake them at 375 for 30-40 minutes. My family likes them plain, but you can add a red or white sauce after they're cooked. Absolutely the best meatballs I've ever cooked.

Delicious! Made these as burgers and my 12 yr old, who has been telling me my burgers/meatballs are tasteless gave these the thumbs up! I missed out the cajun spice as i didnt have any, same for the croutons and used breadcrumbs and substituted red pepper flakes with a tiny amount of chilli flakes, but still very tasty! Ill definately make these again!

My hubby enjoyed these meatballs a lot.  I took cooked them in the oven for 15 minutes at 370 degrees and then transferred them into spaghetti sauce for 15 minutes.  They were really good but I don't know if they are the BEST, we've ever had.  We will however keep the recipe handy!

Loved this so much. It's the first review I've ever written. Great flavor. Soft and moist. Just changed a couple of things. Used 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 ground pork. And when cooking, I seared the meatballs in the skillet but finished baking them in the oven at 400 for 10. Thanks so much for sharing.

I'm usually not a meatball guy when I make pasta.  However, I did so this time, and this recipe was easy and absolutely delicious!  I didn't have to change a thing...made it just as is.  Well...that's not accurate.  I did not have Cajun seasoning, so I just omitted it, added salt/pepper and it still rocked.

I agree with everyone, do these in the oven they are so so good! I eat them in my favorite red sauce with some homemade garlic bread to dip.

I tryed alot of meatball recipes on this site this was the #1 best! The best meatballs I ever had!NOTE:for melt in your mouth meatballs place them on baking dish 1 inch apart for 375 for 15-25 mins (time may very on size of meatballs). I love these meatballs they are amazing! If looking for meatballs for soup fry them alittle before oven so it does fall apart. I put mine in slowcooker for 8 hour some falled apart while i mix it. These meatballs are a meal in its self. I can make these and nothing else! Thanks for sharing and God Bless!!!

These were awesome! I baked in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes rather than frying. The red pepper flakes made it a little hot for our taste - but I'll be making these again!

This is a great recipe...I  used creole seasoning instead and baked them for 15 min at 350 degrees then put them in traditional Prego sauce and simmered for a hour. some of the meatballs broke apart and that made the best sauce! I will use this again and again

They're pretty good, but not at all the best meatballs I ever had.  The Worchester sauce is just a weird taste in it.  Sorry.

I thought these were pretty good and as I become a better cook, I become pickier!  I pretty much followed the recipe to a T... I added bell peppers (though they ended up crunchier than I would have wanted, probably because I baked instead of fried) and I didn't have any cajun seasoning so I looked up the ingredients and added everything but the cayenne pepper.  My meatballs only had a hint of spice... the spice was perfect.  I eyeballed everything else and I probably added less worcestershire sauce than what the recipe calls for and next time, I would probably add a little less and maybe a tad less mustard.  But, the flavor wasn't offensive at all.  I didn't have croutons, so I used breadcrumbs (don't know if that made a huge difference).  I also needed to add an extra egg.  And, I baked them @ 370 degrees for 15 minutes, but felt that they needed more time and I baked them for an additional 15 minutes.  I didn't add the fat to the sauce and I simmered everything for 15 minutes.  I will probably try the other recipe with the 3 meats next time, but I really didn't mind the taste of these.  I think these would be better as cocktail meatballs, but definitely try this recipe if you like worcestershire sauce and spice! :)

Really great way to use up packaged croutons, I made a triple batch since my family loves meatballs, I also added 1/3 of a green pepper to the food processor with the onions and garlic. I did not have Cajun spice so I used Old Bay seasoning. I also used a half teaspoon/lb of red pepper flakes instead of a full teaspoon/lb. I baked them in the oven for 30 mins at 350 as recommended and made the sauce from "Sweet & Sour Meatballs" recipe it was fabulous. The recipe made a cookie sheet crammed full of meatballs and the rest of the triple batch i put in muffin tins to make 12 mini meatloaves for the kids' lunch cans. They all loved it.

So very good!  Points for melt-in-your-mouth texture, quick and simple prep/clean-up, adaptability, and flavor.  I don't particularly like or seek out meatballs in any other context--I tried this one for my SO--and I end up taking seconds every time I make this recipe.  I butter some foil, sprinkle it liberally with Italian seasoning and bake these puppies for 25-30 min at 350 (do curl up the edges of your foil).  If you include the onions, chop them very finely, otherwise you'll get chunks of half-cooked onion (unless that's your thing, in which case, have at it).  My hang-up on this recipe is that it isn't particular healthy (and I really don't try to adjust it so that it is...so I wouldn't say it's in my regular rotation, but they're so worth the indulgence once in a while).

These were really good. It was my first time making meatballs and it was pretty easy, besides grinding the croutons (because I wanted them really fine). They looked good when they came out, and I wish I would of remembered to take a picture. The only thing that I wish I would of done better is to have chopped the onions smaller, because there were chunks in the meatballs, but that was my fault. Thanks!

I make up the meat mixture as directed and bake them in a large jelly roll pan at 350 for about 40-50 mins.  I pour off any fat that baked out of the meat balls and then use what I want to immediately and freeze the rest.  They are very easy to freeze in single servings and use as needed.  I take them to work with pasta sauce and parmesan cheese on them, reheat in microwave and have a wonderful lunch!

Hmmmm.... I wanted to give this 3.5.... but since there are no  halves I rounded up.  This had an interesting taste, not sure I will make it again though.  It was EXTREMELY moist, almost TOO moist if thats possible... kept on breaking when I went to cut it in half, it was like spaghetti with meatball-tasting meat sauce!!  But it was pretty good, and there were no leftovers, that alone is worth 4 stars minimum!!

Really delicious!  Mine turned out really salty, though.  I might use low-sodium croutons next time, as there is already so much sodium added by the worchestershire sauce.

Very tender.  We do like spice, but it was a bit too over the top for us.  I will use the general idea next time, but will have to go my own spicy route.  Thank you though, I appreciate your thoughtfullness and sharing,  Bev

I really liked these meatballs.  They were a bit hot/spicy.  Next time I will tone that down a bit.  My husband and daughter did not like them as much as I.  If they were rating I think they would go for a 3.

I was not impressed with this at all. I didn't think they were well suited for the Italian style spaghetti sauce and would be better for maybe bbq sauce. They were a little spicy. I flattened this into patties and then breaded them and made hamburger parmesan with them. Sorry, but we've made better.

I loved this recipe but I did make some changes.  I added some blue cheese that I had left over and instead of the croutons I used panko.  It was delicious.  I do feel the cheese helped with the flavor.  I will try it the next time sans cheese.  Again, fabulous recipe.  Who would want to buy those pre made meatballs when they are so easy to make.

WOW!  these were a huge hit with my family of 6...even the kids thought they were fantastic.  I didn't have croutons, but had bread crumbs, so I seasoned them and added to mixture.  As someone else mentioned, added the oil + about 1 tsp butter to mixture also.  Baked 350 degree oven for 15 minutes, and added to my marinara sauce.  Made them into the best meatball sandwiches I've ever had.  Thanks for a great recipe.

They were all right but I have a better dutch meatball recipe that I love to make. This one is a bit crumbley when you cook it on the stove top.

These are wonderful! But they should come with a warning because you cannot stop eating them! I love it because it was just enough spice. I did substitute the croutons for breadcrumbs and they turned out great.

I really do think these are the best meatballs I've ever had! I'm not overly fond of meatballs because they are pretty bland, these have a lot of flavor! It's what I've always wanted meatballs to be! We ate them plain with mashed potatoes. I definately think they would be better with some type of sauce. We'll be eating the leftovers tomorrow with spaghetti. I think they'd also be good with BBQ sauce. I took others advice and baked at 375 degrees for 20 minutes, and broiled for 5 minutes. Will definately make again.

There were too many conflicting flavors in these meatballs.  I thought they were too spicy, and I like spicy food.  I ate them plain, but I cannot imagine eating these in spagetti sauce.

The taste on these were good, but, nothing particularly special for us.  I used them with spaghetti. I would not use these with spaghetti and meatballs again.  I like my meatballs a little firmer so they don't fall apart when they are simmered in the sauce.

I have made these twice in the past two weeks. My family loved them.  The first time I browned them in the pan then finished them off in the oven the second time just did them on the stove top. great both ways.  They are a bit spicy so I will cut down on the red pepper flakes next time.

Wow!  These really ARE the best meatballs I've ever had!  I followed the recipe exactly as far as ingredients were concerned, but I altered the cooking method.  I buttered a large baking sheet and baked the meatballs for 15 mins, then tossed them into my sauce (Best Marinara Sauce Yet - also from this site) and simmered for an add'l 15 mins.  The end result was pretty close to perfection!  However, reheated the next day, they lost a lot of their initial tenderness.

As a cynic, I was very skeptical about this recipe.  But this recipe lives up to its name!  I have tried many different meatball recipes but this is the every member of my family raved over.  I used Italian bread crumbs and Old Bay rather than croutons and Cajun spices.  I would not recommend using these with milk gravy as they have a little kick.  I made them smallish, baked in a 350 oven for 20 minutes, and then reheated under a low broiler for just a few minutes at dinner time.  To make meatball subs, I heated some Ragu (don't judge me...somehow it jumped in my cart and came home with me) and added the meatballs to the sauce.  Then served with yummy sub rolls.

This has become our go to recipe for meatballs over the past few years.  It is very forgiving, as I have played around with the amounts of different spices quite a bit.  My 5 year old loves these meatballs so much that he picks around the spaghetti and just asks for meatballs!  I like to add about 1 tsp of italian herbs to the mixture as well.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!
***  After being diagnosed with numerous food allergies, I had to modify these for my son.  To make them corn, gluten, dairy, and egg free, I use 100% grassfed local beef, substitute a mix of brown rice flour and chickpea flour and just use the mustard, red pepper flakes, garlic, and onion for seasoning.  My son prefers dried minced onion rather than the fresh kind, so I use @ 2T.  I mis in a little grapeseed oil and I season them with garlic salt while cooking.  They are such a hit that the whole family wants to eat them if he is having them.

Yum!!  These are so good and so easy.  I doubled the recipe and mixed everything in my Kitchen Aid Mixer.  I was out of Cajun seasoning so I used a recipe I found on this site to make my own Cajun seasoning.  I also used Italian Bread crums rather than croutons.  So fast and so easy.  I baked the meat balls at 350 for 20 minutes and then broiled them on "low broil" for 5 minutes on each side.  These are yummy even without sauce!

These were fantastic as turkey meatballs.  So moist and tender.  I baked them instead of frying them.  I also added a chunk of mozzarella to the center of each meatball. I used a lot of Italian seasoning instead of Cajun seasoning because my daughter wont eat food that is very spicy.  She loved them.  They were a huge hit with everyone.

These meatballs are delicious. I doubled the recipe and it called for 2 tsp. hot pepper flakes so they are a little spicy, next time I will only use 1 or none at all. Delicious. Thanks.

I thought that these were really tasty, but the mustard flavor was a little too strong for what I was expecting. I think I would reduce (but not omit!) the mustard in the future.

These meatballs were delicious!  Probably some of the best I have ever had.  I did cut the red pepper flakes in half and it was still too spicy for my daughter, so next time, I will just leave it out.  I will be making these again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

I made 20 meatballs out of the recipe.  The only change on the ingredients I would make is add dijon mustard vs regular mustard.  I did add 1 tsp of red pepper flakes but it's too spicy for kids so next time that would be my only change.  I baked it at 350 for 2o mins and broiled them 5 mins and turned them over and broiled another 5 mins.  VERY GOOD!!!  We loved them!

Great meatballs with a lot of flavor, my family loved them!  I doubled the recipe and used 1lb of ground pork & 1lb of  lean ground sirloin.  Delicious!

For some reason, when I think of meatballs I think of dog food.  I probably had some gross meatballs in my life.  Just made these ones 5 minutes ago and they are so good! I can really taste all the different flavors.  The mustard gives it a nice little kick. I didn't have croutons so I used the Italian seasoned bread rumbs.  Thank you for the recipe!

Super recipe!  I made these to avoid using frozen meatballs called for in the recipe also found on this site,"Meatball Grinders with a Yummy Sauce"  submitted by, Krystal (which I also recommend if you like grinders or meatball bombers).  The meatballs were very tasty and worked really well with the grinder sauce--my husband and I both loved it!  Thanks Bearnesta!!!!

These meatballs are awesome! I followed the recipe pretty closely & had them with store bought spaghetti sauce & noodles.  Very good!  We really liked the little kick the spices gave them.  Tonight we'll be using the leftovers for a meatball sub, YUM!

I have eaten way too many squirrels stuck to cook in a crock pot all day, and not wanting to eat them again I took the time to debone a few of them, stick the meat in my food processor and make meatballs out of them. I halved this recipe and used squirrel meat instead of beef and baked them in the oven instead of pan frying them and they turned out very good. The flavor was excellent, and these were so easy to put together. Did the rest of my family eat these? Oh yeah.

Everyone loved the meatballs.  I followed the advice of the last few raters and baked them before placing them into my sause.  They came out very moist and tender with excelent flavor.  I will make these again.

These were really great! Super moist and full of flavor. I didn't add the crushed red pepper because I just don't like it, and I was out of croutons, so I did a mix of Italian style bread crumbs, crushed veggie Ritz crackers and veggie chips that I got in a Christmas basket. Other than that, I followed the recipe pretty closely, including the sautee. After I browned them to the point of crispy, I turned the temp down to Lo, covered and let them finish their time, and then they went right into the sauce for about 4-5 hours. My husband used them for a Meatball sub the next day! Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making these again today to put in the freezer, so we can get at them any time we want!

These were really tasty! I added these meatballs to a pasta dish with veggies. I added a light sauce to that it wouldn't take the flavor from the meatballs. Would make again!

My husband loved them so I made extra and froze them. He reheated them at 350 for 15 min. and now I have to make more. I gave it a fifth star for the reviews. Because of them I was able to tweak the recipe. I used less cajun, added basil and parsley, used Jack Daniel's Dijon mustard, and baked them at 350 for 20 min then broiled them on each side for 5 min. The first time I pan fried them then baked them because they were too greasy and they turned out great but it's easier just to bake them.

these meatballs were very good!! as you can tell by the recipe, they are little spicy (hot), excellent for those who like a little kick!
i ended up baking them at 350 for about 20 minutes then simmering them in the sauce for an hour because I had some extra time.
delicious! thanks!

The flavour in these was great, but the problem was in the cooking. I found they kept falling apart in the pan. Make sure to use a spoon while turning them, and you may need to use more olive oil than the recipe calls for.
Otherwise, they tasted great.

Incredible.  I had my doubts, because I am a spice sissy.  I read someone else’s review that said ‘don’t be afraid of the spices’.  I made the recipe exactly as written, but instead of frying, I also baked them at 350 for 20 minutes.  Fabulous.  Great texture and flavor, and the spicy little kick is just right.  Yep, add me to the BEST meatballs bunch.  hanks for this recipe!

These meatballs were very tasty. I added 1/2  pound of ground sausage and increased the onions to 3/4 of a cup and used 3 large cloves of garlic. I was trying a new Creole seasoning so I took a tiny taste of it before adding it to the mix. I am so glad that I did! It was so salty! Since there was not any salt in the recipe, I went ahead and added just a couple of dashes of the Creole seasoning. I also reduced the red pepper flakes to half. And I used seasoned bread crumbs in place of the croutons. Since you can't taste the mixture, I suggest that you taste the seasonings before you put in the mixture.

These were so good! I made a few changes because of personal preferences and what I had on hand. I used a mix of ground veal, pork, and beef, 1 tbl of Dijon mustard, only 1 tbl of Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tbl of onion powder, (because my son doesn't like chopped onions) only 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes, 1/2 c. of seasoned bread crumbs, (I've made twice. Once with bread crumbs and the other with crushed croutons. I didn't notice a difference at all) about a tbl of parm, a pinch of salt and pepper and a sprinkle of mesquite powder because I didn't have any Cajun powder. I put them on a broiling pan and pop in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. After draining them, cooked them on low in spaghetti sauce (which I added a splash of red cooking wine) for about 15 minutes while my spaghetti was cooking. Everyone loved them so much (even my picky daughter), that I'll have to double the recipe next time.

Good flavor.  I baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and used GF Italian breadcrumbs.  I will freeze to use when my zucchini comes in to use on zoodles. Thank you.

These meatballs are great.  I followed the recipe except I didn't have Cajun spice and I cooked them in the oven but they turned out moist and very tasty.

I will definitely make this again. I did leave out the Cajun spice, as it is not one I enjoy, other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out excellent. I used dried red pepper in place of the teaspoon of red pepper flake, because that is what I had on hand. They were very tasty with just a tiny kick of heat after you ate them. My girlfriend also really enjoyed them.

Very very delicious! I did make some modifications. I omitted the Red pepper flakes and Cajun spices as I am not a big fan of spicy food. I did 4 cloves of garlic, used Italian bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon of honey. I added the tablespoon of butter and the teaspoon of olive oil right into the mix. Mixed everything together and refrigerated for 1 hour. Made the meatballs and dropped them right into my marinara sauce.  I used 2 jars of Bertoli tomato and basil. I sprinkled one tablespoon of sugar into my sauce!!!! Mmmmmmmm!!! My girls went crazy for it!!

Perhaps I shouldn't rate this since I only used 1/3 of the red pepper flakes it called for. (We have a 4-year-old who wouldn't have appreciated the spice!)  Even so, these meatballs had a good flavor. However, there was a little too much fat. Unless your meat is very lean, I recommend 1 teaspoon each of butter and oil. The meatballs also didn't stay together very well. Whether that's good or bad is a matter of preference. We will probably make these again!

OMG, I'm a fan!!  I made a few changes: 1lb beef & 1lb mild Italian sausage, I needed a large batch of meatballs for the freezer;  dried parsley, oregano, black pepper, ice water + I was finally able to use up those croutons I had in the pantry, brilliance :^)  I tested one by frying, YUMMY!!  When I use the ones from the freezer I will be baking them in the oven.

I followed the recipe but cooked the meatballs in the sauce instead of the oven.
I found the mustard and Worcestershire to be overpowering in this recipe, and the cabin a bit to spicy for pasta.

Ive always been horrified of meatballs in the past. Canned, frozen and generally poor quality meat left its mark as a kid but I decided to have a go at making these and my mind was blown. So good! Make batches regularly now and often adapt slightly to make different flavour combos. Goats cheese and red pepper are excellent. Also used to reshape into home made burgers. Thanks for sharing this!

Truly are the best meatballs I've ever had! Amazing. The only thing I did different was lightly browned the meatballs on all sides then cooked them in the oven for about 10 min at 450. Then added them to the marinara sauce.

I didn't have croutons so I used roughly half crushed Ritz crackers and half Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I made a half recipe but used an entire egg as I didn't feel like trying to separate an egg.  :)  These were absolutely awesome meatballs and not too spicy at all.  Texture was perfect and taste was better than any other recipe I've tried.  You won't be disappointed!

Love this recipe and modified it for low(er)fat, gluten-free deliciousness!  Instead of croutons, pulverized some Glutino's parmesan garlic bagel chips. And instead of beef, used 1/2 lb ground chicken and 1/2 lb bison. Both my husband and 15 year old stepson LOVED it (as did yours truly!)

Easy and Everyone loved!  My son said, "they melt in your mouth", hard to imagine with a meatball.  However, they really are light and delicious.  I did not have the red pepper flakes or fresh garlic...they were still great.

I am hard to please with meatballs, but these are the best I ever had! I modify the recipe at times by adding fresh parsley or reducing the amount of onion.

We loved them, also baked them in the over, but too spicy (for the kids, I love spicy) and too much Worcestershire, otherwise VERY GOOD! Next time I will put less spices, mustard and worcestershire.

Homemade meatballs are just homemade meatballs - Wrong, these are great and go with so many different sauces. I use them with marinara, sweet and sour, beef gravy. Love their versatility. Always keep a couple of batches in the freezer, makes week nights so easy. Delicious!

We made these with venison and followed the directions for the most part, except for the cooking part (followed the advice of other reviewers and baked in the oven before letting cook up in the sauce). These turned out GREAT, we will definitely make again. We prepared 5lbs of meat, and for this I only added 3 teaspoons of pepper flakes, because I felt like the full serving would have been too spicy. I think if they were more spicy I would not have enjoyed them as much.

I made these for my husband, to put in spaghetti with marinara sauce.  He rated them 3 stars, but they smelled 4 star to me. I didn't taste them though, so we'll go with his rating.  Very easy to make.  I substitute ground vension, which worked well.  Using crushed croutons is key.  I could tell they added more flavor than substituting bread crumbs.  I chose to bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and they were perfect!!

Good meatballs though not the best I've ever had.  I substituted bread crumbs for the seasoned croutons to accommodate a guest's need for ingredients without lactose.  I served them with spaghetti.

Very good meat balls! I used Kevin's method and baked them for 15 minutes and finished them in marinara sauce. Nice texture, great flavor.

Super easy! Make them in the oven like the other reviews said, about 450 for 15 minutes. Add more spices and salt too.

I doubled the recipe and made these to take to a pot luck.  Neither my husband or I like meatballs so I never make meatballs.  These were THE BEST!  I thought he was going to eat them all before we could leave home!  I almost followed the recipe word for word.  I didn't have enough croutons so I substituted some Town House crackers and just did not add as many as it called for.  Also I added the olive oil to the meat mixture, omitted the butter and baked them for 35 minutes in a 375 degree oven.  Then put them in a crockpot for a couple hours.  Yummmmm!

This recipe as written makes very good meatballs.  Lots of flavor and a little bit spicy.  Fantastic for a meatball sub or an appetizer with a little marinara sauce.  However, as much as I enjoy the meatballs on their own, they're a bit too spicy and overwhelming for my personal taste when making spaghetti.  For spaghetti meatballs, I use this recipe but make a few changes.  I half the mustard, omit the pepper flakes and replace the Cajun seasoning with Italian (or use Italian breadcrumbs).  I also typically bake my meatballs because I find it easier and less messy - 350 for about 30 minutes.  Often, I substitute bread crumbs (1 cup) for the croutons simply for a lack of croutons.  As written, these meatballs are great, and my changes probably make them a little more mundane - but I like my spaghetti and meatballs a tad under-whelming.

Great base recipe. I doubled it and used a pound of ground pork with the beef. Also used crushed french fried onions with the croutons and italian seasonings instead of cajun. Rolled into balls, set on cookie sheets, drizzled olive oil and baked at 350 for 35 minutes. Browned nicely. Thanks!

Extremely easy, tasty, and adaptable.  I omitted the croutons and onions - I avoid bread products, and didn't have onion.  I added about 2 TB of parmesan.  Baked at 375 for about 20 minutes before tossing in with sauce and sauteed peppers.  Will make again soon!

This was my 1st try at making meatballs in about 30 years. I read all the reviews and cut back on the Worcestershire and red pepper. I used dijon mustard and left out the butter. I baked them and when finished I added them to a Swedish meatball sauce in a crockpot. Made a great New Year's Eve appetizer. My very picky husband loved them!

I'll be rating these within the hour however I just discovered that I have no worcestershire sauce!!! I settled for using Guinness. Which is good because I was debating to open a bottle of wine as I cooked anyway....Here's to innovation!

I've made these 6 or 7 times.  Cut down on the spicy factor since we have kids.  Have done it several ways and all good.  Baked from raw with pink sauce, really good but a bit crumbly.  Recommend cooking on pan first for outside crispiness.  Then bake with sauce.   My gang loved with marinara/alfredo sauce mixed...and also baked with marinara and cheese on top.  Really good!  Will keep making them......

Great tasting meatballs, love the red pepper flakes - really like spicy.  I added more garlic, like lots of garlic (have home grown garlic.)  I used ground beef but I think meat loaf mix will be good, which I will use the next time.

I liked this meatball recipe very much. I increased the portions and used half ground pork, half ground beef. I also didn't use the red pepper flakes this time because I was making them for a large party, thought I'd err on the side caution. They turned out well and got a few compliments. Thanks!

I'm rating this as five stars based on my husband's reaction. I am a vegetarian, but I love to cook, and often prepare meals with meat for my husband. I followed the recipe exactly, and after his first bite, he was in love! He said the flavor was great, and they were very moist. I will admit I did have a little trouble cooking them on the stove. It was difficult to cook them through without burning them on the outside, so I think next time I will do them in the oven. However, for my first time making meatballs I'd say it went pretty darn well. Overall, this one was definitely a winner!

I was really impressed with the flavor of these!  They were delicious!  I did bake them instead of pan frying...which turned out just fine.  I baked them at 350 for 35 minutes...just perfect!  Yummy!!! Served with spaghetti and sauce it was a huge hit.

These were absolutely phenomenal.  We had some ground beef that we bought on special and I wanted to make freezer meals.  Your recipe came out just perfect...  I made about 12 small ones for taste-testing and bagged the rest for later use.  They were just perfect, even without any sauce:)  I DID sneak in a little cheese, but only because we loveeee cheese in our meatballs here:)

Absolutely AWESOME!!! I was a little hesitant about the last few ingredients but I'm sooo glad I follwed through.  I used bread crumbs because i didn't have croutons, tripled the recipie, using 1 lbs. each pork/veal/beef and added a cup of grated parmesan. Truly the best ever!!

I'd never made meatballs before, but I think these turned out pretty good for a first attempt. I baked mine instead of fried (foil the baking sheet; they aren't kidding) and used an ice cream scoop to help make them uniform in size. I made extra to keep in my freezer for quick meals. The spices aren't quite right to my taste, so I only give 4 stars.

A small group of friends had organized a Meatball Cook Off and I had no Meatball Recipe.  I followed this recipe yet added some ground pork and lamb. I won the cook off! It was a bit spicy for some.

Did not care for these meatballs. Found the worcestershire to be very overpowering.

I was looking forward to some great meatballs but was very disappointed.  These are way too spicy and conflicted with my wonderful marinara sauce.  I guess I should have known better than to use a cajun seasoning (italian cajun?).  Won't do these as the recipe is written ever again.  Should have looked at more of the reviews.

From all the reviews I thought for sure this would be a hit with my meatball & spice lovin hubby but I have to say he wasn't as excited as I expected.  He liked them but did not love them.  I don't eat ground beef so I can't comment for myself.  Like other reviews, I baked rather than pan fried the meatballs.  I will try them again someday but probably with a little variation.

More like 4.5 stars. Excellent recipe. I baked them at 375 for 30 minutes and they were perfect. I did not have cajun seasoning but added a few dashes of italian seasoning. I also didn't have croutons but substituted italian bread crumbs. I would add a few pinches of sugar next time to break up the tanginess. My boyfriend loved them.

Very flavorful and moist; my second batch was so moist they sort of fell apart in my spaghetti sauce--not sure where I went wrong there.  Very versatile recipe.

Good moist meatballs but just average taste.  Maybe my meat was too lean, 93%.  I'd make these again but I'll try other recipes first.

These were pretty tasty. Good flavor, but I think I will cut back slightly on the bread crumbs next time. I used seasoned bread crumbs rather than crushing the crutons,it's much easier. I served them in barbeque sauce with skin on mashed red potatoes and a veggie. A very tasty meal.I like the little kick from the red pepper flakes! I will make again for sure. My picky hubbie liked them as well, which is always a plus.

These were great, but a bit too spicy for us.  Next time I'll use half the red pepper flakes, and half the worschestershire sauce.  I baked in the oven at 350 for 30 min. in a glass baking dish and they were tender and juicy....

After a disastrous foray into turkey meatballs, I decided to try and conquer them with beef. This recipe is delicious! I substituted Cajun seasoning and red pepper flakes with some cayenne/paprika/chilli powder and it was great. Only downside? Heartburn!

These are great!  Made these spicy meatballs exactly as written, and we really enjoyed them.  Served them with Marinara sauce (w/wilted baby spinach), and brown rice (w/Frozen black eyed peas, and bottled mushrooms).  Cannot wait for the leftovers.  Thanks for the great recipe.

loved these-followed the recipe but reduced the worstershire by 1T.  these meatballs were fantastic.  they looked like they were going to fall apart but I continued to fry and brown and they held together great when added to the sauce!

I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I used Italian Bread Crumbs instead of crushed seasoned croutons, because that's what I had on hand.  This truly is the best meatball I've ever had, bar none!  Thank you Bearnesta!

This will be the recipe my kids ask for every time they come home from college, and later in married life (they are 9 and 11!!) I LOVE this recipe, and it uses stuff you already have onhand.  For the cajun seasoning, I use either Lawry's six pepper seasoning, or blackened redfish seasoning, bc they were in my cupboard. Now, when ground beef is on sale, I buy a lot of it, and make 3 batches of the meatballs, cook them and freeze them.  Thank you!

I loved these meatballs, they were delicious and tasty but not the best meatballs I've ever had BUT i did make a few of my own variation.  I used spicy brown mustard instead of yellow mustard because I didn't have any on hand.  I also used coconut oil instead of butter and lastly I used A1 instead of worchester.   The meatballs were a wee bit soft but that was also my own doing I assume because I accidently added 1 tablespoon coconut oil to the mix.  Overall I enjoyed them but feel that they are ggggreat as a compliment for spaghetti but needs a bit more spice for an appetizer.

I make as is except I omit the cajun seasoning, cook in the oven and broil them at the end for a crunch. Very tasty! I usually make these with mashed potato's and gravy for more of a swedish meatball feel.

Had a bit of a kick with the red pepper flakes and the cajun spices.  I will try using a bit less red pepper next time.  I didn't have croutons either so I used seasoned bread crumbs.  That made quite a noticable difference.  I'll use croutons next time or LESS bread crumbs (almost 3/4c).  Also, I followed the advice of "Kevin" and baked the meatballs at 375 deg for about 20 mins.  I didn't use the olive oil or butter and they came out fantastic.  I will definitely be making these again.

The last time we made meatballs they were really bland, so I decided to try this one. This was definitely the opposite of bland! I think it was a bit too spicy even though we left out the Cajun seasoning (and the mustard)... but I can't really handle spice. They turned out really well. We'll definitely make them the next time we have spaghetti again.

These meatballs ARE AWESOME!! I don't usually eat ground beef, but I tried a bite, and boy am I glad I did! I baked them instead of fried them (healthier version)... everything else in the recipe was perfect!

Definitely try these out!

This is a great meatball recipe. I made some changes like other's have posted and it came out perfect! I used italian bread crumbs instead of croutons, and baked it at 375 for 20 minutes. My kids like them served with toothpicks (makes it a fun food for them) but it also tastes great in marinara sauce with spaghetti. This recipe is a keeper!

They weren't inedible, but husband asked for them NOT to be made again.  He said there was a flavor that didn't jive well.

I thought they were fine, but I wouldn't crave them.

Very easy and tasty recipe. I added 2 tbsp. parmesan for extra flavor. Also be sure to evenly brown entire meatball for a good texture. Turn frequently on lower heat to prevent burning.

This was a good recipe but I didn't have all the ingredients.  I didn't have any Worcestershire so I used 3 TBSP of ketchup and added a few drops of liquid smoke to it and about 1 tsp chili powder.  I also added a little more onion because my husband loves onion.  I didn't have any cajun seasoning so I added Paprika-i know it's not as intense, but better than nothing.  
I put tinfoil on a large baking sheet, fit all the meatballs onto it and baked them for 20 minutes at 375 degrees F.  
(I made the meatballs a few hours ahead of time during my babies nap. I put them on the baking sheet and covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated them until I was ready to bake them)
My husband really enjoyed these!

We loved this recipe.  I was pleasantly surprised because I am not a huge meatball lover.  I used italian style bread crumbs instead of the croutons, I doubled the recipe but only put 5 tbsp. worchestershire and 1 tsp. red pepper flakes.  I also used the oven method.  I baked them at 360 for 20 minutes and then broiled them for 5 minutes.  We added them to a jar of classico four cheese spaghetti sauce and made meatball subs.  They were amazing.

I have made this recipe many times and my fam loves it.  Even my non beef eating daughter thinks these are "a little bit OK"...that's huge!!  I do bake them, and probably dump in more pepper flakes than is called for, as we do like it spicy.  Bottom line, this is the first recipe I have ever been inclined to respond about, and I have been cooking off of this site for years.
Kudos.

A friend of mine recommended this recipe and I am so glad that she did!  I tripled the recipe so I could freeze a bunch of them.  I really enjoyed the red pepper flakes and cajun seasoning.  It gave it just a small kick.  I also baked them in the oven on 350 for 22 minutes a batch.  These will be great in spaghetti sauce, the sauce you make cocktail meatballs in and just by themselves with a yummy dip!  Definitely a keeper!

Definitely not the best meatballs I've ever had. I followed the directions to a "T", but I was not thrilled with the result. They tasted ok, but I will not be making these again. The flavoring just wasn't what I expected.

We really love these meatballs.  I usually leave out the mustard because I don't think it goes well with spaghetti.  I double the recipe and freeze them on a cookie sheet.  Then I put them in freezer bags and can take out as many as I need for a quick meal.  I've made them with spaghetti, sweet and sour sauce, and bbq sauce.

I have made these meatballs a few times now and they are great every time.  Like a few others, I also bake mine for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees and then broil them for about 5 minutes.  Other then that, I stick to the recipe precisely.  Happy eating!

Given the name and the ingredients in the recipe, I was a little disappointed. The meat balls lacked any real flavor. Rather than use the skillet, I followed a suggestion to do them in the oven for 20 min at 350 and then broil 5 min, turn 5 min - they were dry. Had to use chili sauce to bring out any flavor and reduce dryness. If I was to do this again, I'd probably double the spices and certainly use the skillet method.

These were great and very moist. I added some grated parmesan that I had in the fridge, and baked them for 30 mins at 325.  I can hardly wait to make this recipe again.

These were really great paired with the "Meatball Grinders with Yummy Sauce" recipe here on this site.  They are a bit spicy, so if you're not into spicy foods, try cutting back on the Worcestershire sauce, the red pepper flakes or the Cajun seasoning and working up to what you like.  I made a batch of these, browned them in a hot skillet, then put them in the Crockpot with the "Yummy Sauce" mentioned above and cooked it all for five hours.  These meatballs made wonderful meatball grinders!

UPDATE-- I was looking at my reviews and found out i started making these two years ago and i now make them almost weekly. I have mastered the recipe to how we like them by removing the worcester sauce and no we add red peppers which we dident according to the last review. Also I have made them so they dont fall apart. They are great I highly recommend.   they really are the best i loved them more then any meatball ive ever had! Also wanted to say i skipped the red pepper flakes as my son (2) flips out when he eats them but they were awsome i also fried them for a while then put them in the sauce to cook the rest of the way they fell apart a bit but that was fine they were awsome!

This was the first time I'd made meatballs by hand and they went down very well, a lovely spicy flavour. They tasted great cold the next day too! I served them with gravy and mashed potato.

These were very tasty. The mustard added flavour not normally found in meatballs, was a good addition. Will make these again.

This is a solid recipe!  I took the advice of other cooks and baked them instead of frying them.  I usually fry my meatballs, but I find that baking them gets the same results, not to mention being healthier.  I had seasoned crutons on hand, so I used them as well as seasoned breadcumbs.  I'll definitely make these again.

These were very good, I found that I didn't have all the ingredients so I added a couple things myself and also cut down on the mustard, not a huge mustard fan. But they turned out great!

These tasted great, but I had a little trouble making the meat mixture stick together. I served them with spaghetti. My husband thought they were okay, my toddler had a blast eating them.

These were delicious.  I did use ground turkey instead of beef and I baked them like the other reviewers suggested instead of saute-ing them (350 for about 40 minutes).  I also ommitted the cajun seasoning.  They were very moist and tasty.  The family LOVED them.

very yummy, gave my spaghetti an extra kick! I added three pepper mustard instead of the yellow and since I dont eat wheat products, I used oats.  =) my boyfriend asked me to make it a little less spicy next time.

Used seasoned bread crumbs and dijon mustard.  Also added a small square of mozzerella cheese to middle.  Turned out yummy.

Very good. I didn't use red pepper flakes, and I used crushed "Melba Toast" instead of croutons. And for my sauce, I just put a mixture of ketchup and brown sugar on the bottom of the pan that I baked them in- Yes I baked them instead of frying.

A little bit greasy, but overall pretty good.  These were done prety quick.  I will probably make them again someday.
