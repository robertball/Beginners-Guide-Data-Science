Interesting combination of flavors- like nothing I had ever had before.  Needed something else though... next time perhaps some fresh grated ginger, crushed red pepper flakes, more teriyaki sauce.  Nice texture though.

This is by far the best tuna patties recipe I've ever tried. It's so easy to prepare, and it has great flavor. I substituted crushed seasoned croutons for the bread crumbs, and it worked fine. I also realized after the fact that I'd forgotten to sprinkle the corn meal on the patties. They were delicious anyway. It just goes to show that you can't "mess up" this recipe. Thanks for sharing it, Michelle!

This was wonderful!! i skipped the sesame oil as I didn't have any. I will get it for the next time though as my patties were a tiny bit dry. I loved this though and can't wait to have some for lunch tomorrow!  Per another persons suggestions I made Peanut Butter Noodles(also from this site) to go with the patties.  It was delish!

Hearty & hits the spot. Goes together quickly. Overall, not too shabby. Omitted the green onion, since I didn't have any. Used olive oil instead of sesame, added about a tsp of peanut butter to replace the flavor of the sesame oil and for extra protein. Added a dash of 5-spice powder too. Cooked on a cast iron skillet with only a bit of olive oil. I'd make it again, especially to serve on a bed of lettuce and with steamed veggies on the side.

I wanted a different way to eat tuna, and this came out great! Served with some lemon wedges and a side dish of stir fry, it was a big hit. I'll definatly make this again!

This was excellent!  I DESPISE canned tuna, but was looking for a recipe using things I had on hand and so whipped up this with things in my house...and I'm so glad I did!  I followed the recipe exactly except used regular onions instead of green onions.  When I make it again, I think I will try coating it with breadcrumbs instead of cornmeal, as I don't care for the gritty texture that cornmeal has.  Other than that, this recipe is awesome!!!

Boy..these did not turn out well at all!!  I followed the recipe with the exception of using garlic powder in place of the real thing.  For some reason, my tuna was very FISHY...so the problem could have been on my end.  I just didn't think these had much of an asian taste to them.  Won't be making them again, but thanks for sharing.

I was really psyched to try this one because of the great ratings, but I didn't think it was worth a 5--I grudgingly give it a four.  The "Asian" flavor was very subtle, I guess I was expecting a stronger flavor.

Tasted pretty good even though I had to sub olive oil for the sesame oil.  It seemed to have a bit too much black pepper for my taste, so next time I'll decrease it a bit.  Thanks for sharing, Michelle.

I thought that this was a tasty and quick dinner. It was a little dry, but I had cut back on the oil. I used crushed seasoned croutons instead of bread crumbs for extra flavor and I left off the corn meal because I was in a rush. My 4 yr. old loved it and had seconds even the baby ate all of hers before she ate her fruit.

This recipe is so good!  I added a quarter of an onion (sauted a bit before adding) and used oyster sauce instead of teriyaki.  Now I know why all the other reviews are praising this dish, it's a winner!

Just what I was looking for. Great taste and different from anything I had tried with tuna before. Very inexpensive and quick. I didn't have soy or teriyaki sauce and it still tasted great.

Really good! I used a can of tuna and a can of wild salmon. I ended up adding another egg as it was quite dry at first. I added some fresh minced ginger, as I was making Peanut Butter Noodles (from this site) to go with, and that recipe call for it and I had extra! I used a reduced sodium soy sauce, cooked them in olive oil, and did not use any cornmeal. Will make often!

These were very easy to make! I did them a little smaller, like appetizers, and instead of frying them, baked on a non-stick cookie sheet. (15mins in a 350deg oven) Texture was good, and they stuck together beautifully.  The results were quite salty, though, so in the future I might add rice to stretch them a bit, or perhaps I used the wrong sort of breadcrumbs. Calls for experimentation!

Everyone in family loved this recipe!  I wasn't sure how my kids would like it, so I actually made a bunch of mini patties, and wrapped them in lettuce.  I gave them little dippers of soy sauce and teriyaki sauce.  These were soooo good!  Making them into mini patties made me think they would be great as appetizers at a party.

These were so easy to make and came out great! I halved the recipe and was still able to make 6 decent-sized patties. I also made the following additions: toasted sesame seeds, dollop of red pepper hummus, dried basil, lemon juice, red pepper flakes, sweet chili sauce, radish, roasted red pepper (omitted the ketchup). I also let them set in the fridge for 2-3 hours, which prevented them from falling apart. Next time I'll try adding some water chestnuts to give them a nice crunch.

I HATE canned tuna. I eat canned tuna maybe once a year, but had several cans stocked up that needed to be used up, so I was looking for a recipe that could disguise the "tuna" taste. These tuna patties are fabulous! The addition of the spices and ingredients turned the tuna into a deviled fishcake, without a tuna-y taste. This is exactly what I was hoping for. Almost like a deviled crabcake, without the expense -- (but do not expect the crab taste.)  I may actually go out and buy canned tuna just to make this recipe after all my cans are gone!

I made this a couple of weeks ago and I thought it was great!  I am very happy to have a simple and new way to use canned Tuna.  I do not recall having changed a thing in the recipe.

I was hesitant to try this recipe because I've read the reviews and alot of them said although the texture was good, the flavor could've been improved.  So i measured out 2 T of store bought teriyaki sauce and doctored it up with fresh grated ginger, squeezes of fresh orange and lemon juice, some honey, brown sugar, and a few shakes of garlic powder.  They were pretty good.  Even when I thought my dad wouldn't like them, he loved them!!

MMMMMMmmmmm.   This recipe is great.  Quick, easy, and cheap, but really impressive.  Tangy and light flavours but hearty enough to fill you up.  Add ginger for extra zing.  I serve with my coconut lime rice.

So easy and I had all the ingredients on hand (except gr. onions)! I agree that I'm not a huge canned tuna fan, but these were a great way to get some fish in my diet. 

I added an extra egg, and used DARK soy sauce (light soy sauce can taste really salty). They don't really taste Asian but they're good nonetheless. I think this will be one of my fallback meals for rushed evenings!

I really enjoyed these.  I have been looking for a tuna patty recipe that did not have mayo as an ingredient.  I used low sodium soy & teriyaki sauces and served it with teriyaki rice.  I didn't have cornmeal and it was fine without it.  I will make these again.

Basic recipe looked really good...made a few changes. I made 1/2 a recipe for just the two of us...but used the full amount of sesame oil. Patties were a great consistency! Used just the egg white, and added a pinch of ginger and curry powder. I also omitted the cornmeal. Served it with a spinach salad with cuke, scallion, orange pepper and sunflower seeds with an Asian dressing. Put small patties (1/2 recipe made 6 small patties) around the salad and topped the patties with an oyster sauce which I thinned and added sesame seeds. Looked great and was rather tasty!

Nice little dish.  And it's something new for me to do with tuna that doesn't involve two slices of bread!  I followed the recipe pretty much verbatim, but I did take another user's suggestion of using a tsp of olive oil and a tsp of peanut butter in the place of sesame oil, since I had none. I thought the patties turned out moist and delicious ... and I look forward to fiddling with the recipe and making it my own in the future!

Really tasty! But I found them a bit dry the first time I made them, so the second time I doubled the egg, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, and ketchup. The flavor was great and they will be better second day.

You can definitely taste the sesame oil, which I like. I did over-cook these a bit though, so they had somewhat of a burnt taste...oops. Just make sure you don't get your oil TOO hot like I did & they'll come out nicely!

Pretty tasty!... I decided to make these for dinner tonight at the last minute because our meat hadn't thawed and I had all the ingedients!..  I do usually make salmon patties the same old way, but tried this with the asian flair!  I really did like the taste of the sesame oil... I was surprised after opening my cans of tuna/water... Not much fish in them... If I make again I'll add another can to stretch it further since this barely served the 4 of us...  Served with rice and veggies!

Even though I left out the teriyaki sauce and doubled the amount of ketchup, these patties had a delightful blend of flavors! I dry fried these in my non-stick skillet.
We will be making more of these!

YUMMY! We hesitated to try this recipe, but it turned out delicious! I substituted crushed tricuits for corn meal and I didn't have any terriyaki sauce so I used more soy sauce and ketchup. I also used white onions instead of green. This still turned out delicious. They kind of fell apart during cooking, but we ate them with rice and veggies. Will definitely make again! Very juicy and flavorful!

Great recipe- I also needed to add some extra egg to get it to hold together better- it was a little dry at first- overall really good recipe

Easy, but the flavor was not what I was expecting.  Perhaps a quick saute of the garlic and onions before the are added to the patties would improve the flavor.

I found this to be a little bland. I dipped it into wasabi mayonaise and that made a difference.

Lifesaver recipe.  I did not tell my husband it was tuna. My mother also made it for my dad who complimented her on the meal.  Definite keeper.

A good recipe -- a change from the ordinary plain tuna.  I found that these were tasty, but a bit too greasy.  Next time I will cut down on the amount of oil to fry them.  Instead of cornmeal (since I was out, as was the corner store) I used crushed ritz crackers.  My husband had suggested I use salmon, but found the meal an unexpected taste surprise.  My son, gave it a "so-so," which is great since he tends to gravitate towards pizza and hamburgers.  Try this recipe, it will surprise you at how good it is!

This recipe was a real lifesaver.  I had to pick my daughter up fom daycare early because she had a fever, and because she needed me to stay at home with her I didn't have a chance to do my grocery shopping.  I had no idea what to make for my dinner with the food I had in my cupboard but once I found this recipe I had a quick delicious hot meal.  I never knew canned tuna could taste so good.  I didn't even have all the ingredients but they were still very tasty.  I will make this one again and again. Thanks

My husband gives this 5 stars, I give it 3.  It is a little dry, though I think omitting the cornmeal might help (you only need about half that amount, anyway).  I didn't care for the combination of flavors, but it was worth trying if you're a tuna fan.  Mainly tasted just like a normal tuna patty to me.  A previous reviewer suggested serving it with macaroni & cheese, which might have been a good idea.

I tried this last night when I needed dinner in a hurry.  It was easy to throw together quickly.  I followed the recipe exactly except the use of Olive Oil in place of Vegetable.  I was unsure when I put it on the table because I don't really like Asian food and my husband is picky...but it was perfect.  Just enough flavor to be different and tasty, but not too much.  My husband suggested flaking the leftovers and making tacos...I might try that next!  Overall, this is going in our "save" folder for a tasty, quick, affordable meal at home!  Thank you!

DELICIOUS!! We didn't have any breadcrumbs on hand, so I substituted some oatmeal flakes, and instead of ketchup I used tomato paste. I also put in some red pepper flakes which another user (smartly) suggested.  I was skeptical about how the texture would come out without breadcrumbs, but my husband and I were SO surprised that we ended up splitting one more because they were just so tasty!! Thank you. Will definitely make again!

Yum!  This is a great variation on tuna--not your ordinary flavor combo. I stuck to the recipe exact except for using red onion in place of the green onion since its what I had on hand.  My 7 year old and my hubby both gobbled them up! I would almost give this recipe a 5, but I save 5 ratings for the truly exceptional!  I want to try this without the egg and bread crumbs and see if it would make a good cold tuna sandwich for the lunchbox.

These were pretty good, very different flavors for tuna patties. I doubt I'll make again, I prefer the traditional celery, onion, and breadcrumbs.

these are excellent and seriously impossible to get wrong if you stick to the recipe - the one exception being the cornmeal, which is not necessary and adds a gritty texture.  The flavor is great, try making bigger patties and letting them be the main course with a bed of greens and some store-bought steamed veggies.

These came out way better than I anticipated for my own cooking. I like spicy so I added a tsp of horseradish sauce to the mix. I also made a sauce of tsp Horseradish sauce, tsp Mayo and 1.5 TBSP of Soy sauce. I adjusted if for those who didn't like spicy as much as me. Everyone was wow'd! Thank you! :)

Not a fan of this recipe. Added a little extra soy sauce b-c I could tell it was going to be dry when making the patties. Didn't taste Asian at all.

This is by far the best tuna patties I have ever made.  The kids loved them, even better than the "coveted" grandma version they used to love.  Thanks for sharing.

This is delicous!  I didn't have any teriyaki on hand, so used sweet chili sauce in it's place.  Also added a handful of grated carrot, and a tsp of chopped parsley for color and flavor.  Can you say WOW?!!!  Will definitely make again.

I made these along with the Peanut Butter Noodles from this website suggested by others. I also added 1 cup of frozen stir fry vegetables. This made a fantastic meal.   I prefer salmon or potato cakes but the tuna ones were decent. I left out the ketchup and substituted it for Whole Foods Teriyaki sauce. I did not use cornmeal but did use itlian breadcrumbs. Overall, as a meal I really enjoyed the patties and noodles.

quite tasty. i added some extra green onions. needed more bread crumbs than called for (needs closer to a full cup, maybe a touch more) and Defiantly needed more than the 2TB oil for cooking. kind of crumbly(not sure if it was because i didnt use corn meal-i had none on hand). really does only make 6 small patties. so its more like 3 servings if you're eating as an entree and not a snack. will make again soon!

These patties were delicious. One think I noticed is that you may need to add more egg, maybe 1 1/2 instead of one. I didn't have teriyaki sauce so I added a little more soy sauce and i added a pinch of sugar. The only sesame oil that my local supermarket had was a fortune so I used regular vetable oil.  Delicious!!

These were awesome!  I didn't have any cornmeal but they turned out fine without it...I cooked them in sesame oil and made some pineapple chutney to go with them.  So delicious!

I have made this twice!!  Loved it both times.  I did not have bread crumbs the second time, but substituted oatmeal!  It came out fine!  Add more soy sauce than the recipe calls for -- at least 2 T.

I THOUGHT THESE TUNA PATTIES WERE VERY TASTY. A LITTLE BIT OF A CHANGE FROM THE REGULAR TUNA PATTIES I MAKE. I DIDNT HAVE BREAD CRUMBS SO I USED QUICK COOKING OATS INSTEAD AND IT WORKED GREAT.

I used wheat germ instead of bread crumbs and it turned out well.  Very easy to make!

We liked these a lot!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but added a little bit of fresh ginger with the garlic.  The only thing that kept this from 5 stars was that my fiancee and I agreed they would be even more delicous with some sort of dipping sauce.  I'm thinking maybe a thick teriyaki-ish sauce.  Any suggestions/ideas?

Seemed a little salty or...something...to me. granted I didn't have teriyaki sauce and excluded the ketchup and added worchestershire sauce instead. The husband liked them though so I'll give it 3 stars since he liked it.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but my batch of Tuna patties didn't turn out very well.  Seemed like there wasn't nearly enough liquids for the tuna/breadcrumbs.  I even added an additional egg, but still was very dry.  The flavor was interesting, but the sesame oil seemed to dominate.

I altered the recipe by adding a tablespoon of rice vinegar and a couple of dashes (about 1/2 teaspoon) of five spice powder and it turned out amazing.  Thanks for the recipe.

I tried this recipe years ago on a dare to myself (I thought they sounded sketchy), but ended up loving them. My family really likes them, too--even my picky daughter. They almost have a crab-cake texture, they aren't fishy at all, and they reheat well for leftovers. Oh, and they're cheap to make. Always a bonus!

This was a wonderful, light dinner, or would have been if I did not eat more than my share. Like other reviewers I changed the proportions a bit - more tuna and egg, less bread crumbs (I'm on a low-carb diet). Also, I added a LOT of hot sauce. I can't wait to try this again.

I was nervous that my husband would hate the idea of having tuna patties for dinner but he loved them.  We both did!  Since I usually have most of the ingredients on hand, I can see myself making this one often.  Really, really good!

I've made these several times because they're easy, delicious, and my husband and 2 1/2 year old son love them.  My son asks for "crabby patties" as I call them and devours them.  They're perfect just as the recipe calls but in a pinch I used 1 tsp onion powder instead of fresh onion and they were excellent.  reaaly good with a squeeze of lemon or lime!

The texture of this great recipe is perfect; crisp on the outside, a little soft on the inside.  Do note: the cornmeal works wonders in holding the patties together.  I used two eggs as many reviewers suggested and the final mix was more moist than seemed ideal. I expected the patties to fall apart in a mess in the skillet. Surprisingly, everything held together beautifully and I couldn't have been happier.  My family didn't say anything but all seven patties were snarfed up quickly! The flavor mix is quite exotic for something as ostensibly basic as a tuna pattie.  Great stuff, man.

These were so good! I was amazed that something that took me 5 minutes to assemble and 10 to fry could taste like a restaurant quality appetizer.I did not use cornmeal since I had none on hand but it didn't seem to make a difference. I have shared the recipe with everyone I know...it was that delicious!

My 14 yr old actually went back for seconds! The dish was a hit for all of us. Unable to find any cornmeal and as suggested by another person, used smashed up Triscuits. Found that the oil was used up pretty quick during skillet cooking, (3 min per side is enough). Tried recipe again Aug 09' - for some reason, not as impressed this time around - did it same way.

These are so fast, and so delicious. I scaled in half, but I still used a whole egg and they turned out perfect! As other reviewers said, I have made them twice, and I skipped the cornmeal both times with no problems. I serve them with an Asian salad or noodles--simple, easy and tasty!

Pretty good flavor.  Only takes about 3 minutes per side to cook - I did the 5 minutes recommended & they started to burn before I realized it - watch it closely as you cook it.  I also made the peanut butter noodles recipe from this site to go with this & it was so filling and satisfying.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks!

Tasty and flavourful! A great way to add more fish to our diet.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I fried them in peanut oil, and added extra garlic because we are garlic-lovers!

Definitely worth trying if you like tuna. :)

Oh. My. Goodness. My husband took one bite and told me to put this recipe in the "permanent" file. These are so, so good--like a crab cake only it's delicious, affordable tuna! We enjoyed these with peanut butter noodles (as suggested by other reviewers) and Japanese Style Sesame Green Beans, both from this site. It was an excellent meal, and we're already dreaming about the leftovers.

I followed RAVEN321's idea and served this with Amy's Peanut Butter Noodles. What a great meal... I didn't measure the bread crumbs (just poured until I had what I needed!), I used a few shakes of garlic powder instead of minced cloves, I only used maybe a tsp of ketchup (my husband doesn't care for ketchup), and I omitted the sesame oil. I only used MAYBE 1/4 tsp of pepper, and I omitted the cornmeal and just fried the patties up in a pan sprayed with Pam. It made 7 patties, which was perfect for the three of us. I made them maybe three hours before dinnertime, and I put them in the fridge for awhile. 30 minutes before I wanted to cook them, I put them in the freezer so they would be less likely to fall apart in the pan (I do this with hamburgers and salmon patties too). Nice tangy little patties, an awesome change! Thanks for sharing, Michelle!

My husband doesn't like tuna, but I made these and he loved them.  He didn't even believe me when I said they were made with it!
I've also tried it with canned salmon, and it's wonderful.  I use two eggs, because I think they hold together better that way.

These are very good. I love tuna, but was getting sick of eating plain out of the can. I won’t use mayonnaise so this recipe made perfect sense. I didn’t have cornmeal but they still came out great. I am eating leftover for lunch right now with a little Chinese hot mustard. Thanks for the recipe, it’s a keeper.

I followed this recipe to the letter. My husbands favorite meats are chicken and tuna fish. I make tuna patties often and wanted a change. These patties were very dry and rather tasteless. I had to buy the sesame oil, green onions and cornmeal, items I seldom have on hand. I think 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs was too much and 1 egg not enough. I will not make this again.

sounded like a sure keeper, but sorry to say they came out very dry and with not much flavor. The taste of the tuna was non-existant.

I was surprised to see how many people who said they did not care for canned tuna actually give this recipe a shot. Well, good for you guys! I, on the other hand, love tuna and I thought these patties were really good Michelle! For the reviewer who said that these tasted salty, I would suggest using a low salt brand of tuna and low sodium teriyaki and soy sauce. The cornmeal gave the outside a nice crispy little crust. I garnished with some wasabi sauce. YUMMO and thanks!

I have made these over and over again!!  They are wonderful.  They freeze great!!  I usually make up a double or triple batch. Shape them, put them on a cookie sheet to freeze and then put them in a large freezer bag,when they are frozen. this way they do not stick together and are ready to use.

Really great patties! I used albacore tuna- it's not so fishy. I might not use the cornmeal next time. I served this with "Peanut Noodles" - which are also delicious! Thanks so much for submitting! By the way, I try to type this recipe in the general search & it doesn't show up. You have to go to seafood first.( I wonder why )

Great flavor.  I cooked mine in a non-stick pan with cooking spray instead of the oil to bring down the fat content.  They turned out great.  I served it with edamame and couscous.

I didn't care for this recipe that much. I used 2 cans of albacore tuna so they didn't taste fishy. I just didn't like the combination of flavors the ingredients created. I won't be making this again.

I was looking for something quick and easy and  different for dinner.  This recipe came together very quick and easy and we loved it. I have never had this before, but can't wait to try a salmon variety too.  Would not hesitate to cook this again. YUM!

I gave this a five because I was looking for a way to have tuna other than tuna salad and we do not like tuna casserole at all.  This was very good and very easy to prepare.  I used a really great variety of bottled teriyaki sauce and served more sauce with the patties.  I also used only about 1/3 tps. pepper. We will be having this often. Thanks Michelle for a different and tasty recipe.

I added chopped celery leaves from a celery bunch, and actually I think that saved the cakes from being really bland.  With the leaves, combined with the other ingredients (as well as a pinch of red pepper flakes), we enjoyed the flavor, which did have a mild Asian taste.  I substituted 1/3 c. old fashioned rolled oats ran through a food processor and 2 T. cornmeal for the bread crumbs.  Although I was following others' suggestions to reduce the amount of bread crumbs, I think actually using more oats and cornmeal to arrive at 3/4 c. probably would have been okay.  The cakes were fairly wet when I was forming them.  I also chose to bake these instead of frying them.  They baked at 350 degrees for 10 minutes on each side, then I broiled them for about 7 minutes to brown them up and give the outside a slightly crunchy texture.  (Note that these times were for higher altitudes.)  It probably would have been best to bake them for the noted time, then pop them in a fry pan for a few minutes to give the outside the best appearance.  

Also, I used the same wet ingredients to make a sauce for Thai noodles to have on the side, which worked great.

I have made this many times & it is very good.  Excellent, quick & easy meal for a weeknight or when you don't have any meat defrosted.  Very nice with Jasmine rice (w/ sesame oil & salt) and sauted stir-fry veggies.  Even my picky kids will eat this...definitely a keeper!

My family loved it! I don't like the taste of ketchup with the tuna so omitted it and added double the teriyaki sauce. Great for a quick dinner and my husband said he'd have a tuna pattie burger for lunch with the leftovers.

It's a little funny tasting. It takes some getting used to. I'm not sure I made it right, but I think I did and the sprinkled corn meal was an odd addition. If I make it again, I would not use that. I think they were better cold than heated up. I had a patty for lunch and it was a bit better than the dinner one that was heated. I might try this again, but probably not.

Ok so I substituted a few things, but I justify that by giving this an outstanding rating.
Instead of teriyaki sauce, added a little sugar and a bit of ginger to existing ingredients. And I substituted sriracha for ketchup. I served it on a bowl of rice. Delish!!

I didn't taste much of the Asian flavoring but nice taste anyway. I followed the recipe as written with exception of the tuna. The canned tuna sizes have gone down to 5 oz instead of 6 oz, so I added a third can. I did forget to coat the outside with the cornmeal. I don't know if I would do this recipe again without some changes. I served it with baked sweet potato fries and steamed asparagus. Nice meal.

i just tried this recipe and i must say as i saw some other reviews  this does not taste "asian" at all. dont get me wrong the recipe is good as is although i did throw in some red and green bell pepper and a bit of celery  (only b/c i always try to find ways to eat more veggies) and a squirt of sirarcha but i still didnt taste "asian" at all. some reviews said said subtle well for me not at all :(. 

this is a really good recipe though and i suggest you try it for a new take on canned tuna. i for one stock up on canned tuna when its on sale for 50 or 75 cents and end up with lots of cans so im glad i found this.

here are some things i plan to do next time to punch up or bring out the asian flavors. I will add more than one TB of soy and teriyaki perhaps an extra tsp or even tb. i will add some dashes of cumin, salt and ground ginger. I will add more garlic. maybe a dash of rice vinegar. a dash of the hot chinese mustard. and finally i  have the idea to use sesame seed instead of cornmeal to toast them in

This recipe was so good. I added some fresh basil and cilantro. I think any herbs will go well with this recipe. I used Worcestershire and oyster sauces, since I do not have teriyaki sauce. I also sprinkle some garlic powder and crushed red pepper flakes. My husband loved it. It went well with burger buns and ketchup. Thanks.

To start I did not use any ketchup but used 2 tbsp of a teriyaki syrup which diffenitely gave it a a better asian flavor also added some fresh minced ginger to it. Still havent figured a good way to stop the crumbling. Still A very good twist and tuna patties

Was very tasty.  I'll make this again.  The only thing I changed was I didn't use the cornmeal...It didn't need it and I baked them instead of frying.  Also I put them on buns and topped them with an asian coleslaw.  Yummy!

Not bad. I added a second egg and a large dollop of peanut butter which helped with the consistency of the patties. I also added some red pepper flakes which added a little flavor. I recommend serving with a nice sauce, perhaps a yogurt or peanut based sauce to help with the dryness.

Just made these for the second time and both my hubby and I love them! I used Panko crumbs the first time and Zesty seasoned bread crumbs the second. We both highly preferred the zesty, for the extra kick! Would love to find a great sauce to serve these with, but even alone they are so tasty! And did I mention how easy and quick they are to make! Double thumbs up!!

I used Hoisin sauce instead of ketchup, and panko instead of cornmeal and baked them.  I might use plum sauce next time instead of Hoisin or Ketchup (and maybe only a half T, and add some sesame seeds with the panko.

I enjoyed this a great deal. I was so sick of eating tuna straight out of the can! Anyway, I made one minor tweak to the recipe - I added Sriracha Sauce instead of Ketchup and it came out pretty  good and spicy. They were a little dry but that's because I overcooked them a touch :) They went great with my vegetable Tom Yum soup.

As is, these are too dry.  Based on other reviews I doubled the egg and sauce part of the recipe, which worked well for both dryness and to help them hold together.  Very easy to make, and very cheap.  Slightly bland though, even with the doubled sauce.  Next time I think I'll add ginger and maybe coat the outside with sesame seeds.

I was skeptical, but my mother really wanted to try this recipe. Glad she did! It's excellent. Really tasty too if you substitute sesame seeds for the cornmeal at the end. Tastes very good with plum sauce.

Delicious and easy to make!  I wish they stayed together better.  A couple of them fell apart, but they still tasted great.  Wonderful, quick dinner with ingredients I have on hand. Thanks for the recipe.

These were pretty good. I had the hardest time getting them to stay together however. I didn't have cornmeal so I left it out. Next time I will dry doubling the wet ingredients.

The taste of these were spot on. Where I had the issue was that that were so dry they were falling apart.  My tuna was even in 5oz cans so 2 oz less.  I knew after I had mixed them up they were to dry and needed some more moisture, but I wanted to complete the recipe as written to make sure that they didn't surprise me.  They were falling apart making the patties and fell apart when they cooked.  I think if I did these again I would increase the teriyaki sauce or the egg.  BTW, I got 3 decent size patties out of the recipe. I'm not sure how you get 6 out of this unless they are mini patties.  Thanks for sharing Michelle.

This was the first time I personally made tuna patties but are by far the best ones I've tried. The flavour is great a bit strong though, therefore I made a plane brown rice and a green salad  A few hours after dinner I opened the fridge to eat one they were all gone! Everyone loved them.

Really easy, really good. I omitted the green onions and used almond oil instead of sesame oil. Delicious, quick, inexpensive dinner. Serve with veggies and/or rice.

Loved it!  Baked them in the oven and used wheat germ instead of bread crumbs.  I also added some chili garlic sauce for some spice.  Very good over spicy chinese cabbage.

Really good and really easy to make.  I substituted chili sauce for the ketchup and dusted the cakes with panko instead of cornmeal, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  My husband was skeptical when I told him what was on the menu, but he ate them up!  I served with a teriyaki dipping sauce and the ever popular sesame noodles on the side. Will make again.

A couple of people I fed this to seemed to like it, but I thought it was pretty bad (still edible, though).  I always make teriyaki from scratch, and since there is soy sauce in teriyaki sauce I didn't add any extra--in the end I would have regretted it if I did.  I didn't add any ketchup because it sounded repulsive to mix it with the other ingredients. Also, like another reviewer mentioned, it tasted more fishy than I expected--one of the other ingredients must bring out the fishy flavor of the tuna, because I eat this brand all the time and I know it doesn't normally have that strong flavor.

I'm giving this a poor rating, but its possible it was my fault for them not tasting great. I followed the recipe entirely, but I think I maybe have ruined it because I didn't eat them fresh and had to re-cook. Also, I think I pressed them too hard when making the patties, probably would have been better if it were more chunky. I am definitely going to try it again.

These were ok... I personally couldn't taste the tuna in them, just the soy/teriyaki... perhaps I mixed it too much but they were a bit mushy on the inside... actually my oldest absolutely loved them, gobbled them up actually, the rest of us ate them but didn't have a lot to say.

I did not care for these at all.  I took four bites and threw the rest away.  The husband did not care for them either.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I thought they were mushy and the flavoring was bad.  Also, the cornmeal seemed a little unnecessary to me.  I can't even think of a way to improve them, hence the 1 star.

This is the 1st recipe I've rated and I've been using this site for years. This is an excellent easy recipe. I used 1 12oz can of albacore tuna and followed the recipe exactly. I topped them with the glaze(a teriyaki glaze) from the Herb Roasted Pork Recipe also on this site. It complimented the flavor. I also took the advice of another reviewer and served the Peanut Butter Noodle recipe from this site and WOW! Thanks for sharing.

These were fantastic! I was looking for an easy way to prepare canned tuna besides using it for tuna salad and this recipe is definitely it! I used sesame-flavored chili oil for a little kick and served them with a side of steamed Asian veggies from the freezer section in the grocery store. Wrap them in a large lettuce leaf and you've got a great meal!

When I saw this, I just had to make it since I love tuna, and this was a wonderful change of pace!  I also made mini patties, wrapped them in romaine lettuce and used dipping sauces as another reader suggested!  Yummy!!

This was really good to start with...added ginger powder, sriracha sauce, and I always make my own teriyaki sauce which really is only 1:1 soy sauce and sugar/mirin.

I made these expecting my family to tolerate (rather than like) them, and was surprised to find that they actually ate every last bite!  My daughter thought they were best eaten without any kind of bun, and my husband discovered that cold, the texture was quite unpleasant.  But straight from the pan, they're a nice alternative to burgers.

I made these and was very happy with how they turned out.  Served them with soy sauce and steamed edamame.

I never have bread crumbs on hand, so in my scramble to find something absorbant, I used bonito.  It was super yummy, but didn't hold together so well in the pan.  We didn't care what it looked like after we tasted it!  Thanks for this yummy treat!

Finally, something to do with canned tuna besides make tuna noodle casserole!
This was good but turned out very salty when I made it.  I will make this again and try to modify it so it won't be as salty.
The patties are very dense, maybe there could be a way to make them less hockey-puck-like.
Still a good recipe though.

This was my first time making tuna patties, this recipe sounded good and had very good reviews.  I made this with one change on the onion, instead of green I used white.  This recipe was fabulous, I loved it!  My favorite recipe from this site so far.  I can't wait to have it again.  My seven year old wasn't crazy about it, but everyone else liked it.  Thanks for this one.

These were great! My six and two year old liked them. I didn't have sesame oil, but will use next time. I used crushed club crackers for the bread crumbs. I used corn flour instead of corn meal, because that is what I had on hand. The corn meal is a must, because it gives an extra crunch.

Excellent, easy and tasty! I followed the recipe exactly as printed except didn't coat with cornmeal and added a dash of red pepper flakes. My husband and I both enjoyed and will definitely make this again. I served with the peanut butter noodles on this site. Great combo.

These tasted FANTASTIC!  They were very flavourful.  I added an extra egg and the consistency was perfect.  Husband and toddler gobbled them up.  The cornmeal added good texture to the patties.  Will make again for sure!

These were quick easy and tasty.  I did add more oil than called for, about 1/2 Tbsp instead of 1 tsp.  I didn't have sesame oil I used olive oil instead.  My husband loved the patties and that's saying a lot because he is not a fan of tuna!  I will be making these again when I need a quick and easy meal.

I used salmon instead of tuna because it's what I had in the pantry.  Much improvement on regular salmon patties.  I'll be doing this from now on when making them.  Thanks!

I've made these 2x now and wanted to share an updated review.  Both times i didn't have cornmeal.  1st time left it out.  2nd time used breadcrumbs to the outside of patty.  Didn't like it.  Made it too dry when reheated.  Used 1 egg and a little extra oil (used evoo... it's what i had on hand) in the mixture.  The oil kept them nice and moist for reheating.
enjoy!

I used albacore tuna and did not add the sesame oil but I did add 2 teaspoons of olive oil.  I mixed the cornmeal into the patties instead of sprinkling on top and then I broiled them in the oven.  They didn't take long to cook at all...maybe a couple of minutes on each side depending on how close you place to the broiler.  They came out really pretty and tasted really good but I will say a little dry.  I served these with a lowfat wasabi mayaonaisse to compensate for the dryness(recipe found on this site) and it was great!  This is a great and inexpensive recipe that takes no time at all to cook.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Thanks!

I really liked these!  I had to make a couple of changes to use things I had on hand.  I used seasoned bread crumbs, honey teriyaki marinade, and a regular onion minced fine.  I also left out the cornmeal and just lightly coated the patties in more bread crumbs.  Everyone liked them and it was a great change of pace for us.  The kids said we were having "crabby patties" a la Spongebob LOL!

This wasn't all that flavourful; the "Asian" flavour, as another review mentioned, wasn't very strong. This recipe was really missing something. It also needed 2 eggs instead of one. It was pretty good, but if I make it again I will have to make some adjustments!

After reading the reviews, I guess I expected something more... I didn't have teryaki or ketchup (that was a surprise!), so I substituted ginger flavored soy sauce and sweet and sour sauce.  I think I was expecting a stronger flavor from the various seasonings.  They were good, but they tasted like tuna patties, not really any kind of Asian inspiration here. I would make them again, but kick up the spices... Oh, and I had to add an extra egg AND I baked them at 350 for 15-20 minutes instead of frying.

We loved this! I ommitted the cornmeal and black pepper, and added ground ginger and a tsp of chili sauce. I also added an extra egg white and formed much smaller patties, so that I got about 14 from the recipe. I took other suggestions and served with Amy's Peanut Butter Noodles. Delish.

Delish!  I omitted the cornmeal and vegetable oil, and just "fried" them in a pan with a little Pam spray.  Just as good, with a few less calories and fat.

Great recipe. I didn't have any onions,garlic, or teriyaki sauce so I left them out and just used garlic powder. They still turned out wonderful. The soy sauce definatley gives them an Asian flare. Thanks, I will definatley use this recipe in the future!

Didn't have cornmeal, but it turned out pretty good.  My husband really enjoyed this, and ate all the left over the next day for lunch.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll try it with cornmeal next time.

I am always looking for new ways to eat tuna.  Everyone in the house loved these!  They are so easy to make, and I had everything but the sesame oil on hand.  I used olive oil instead, and they turned out great!

These have a really great flavor.  I enjoyed them, but wouldn't use as much oil for cooking.  Everything in them is good for you, so why ruin them from being a healthy meal by frying them with a lot of oil.  I sprayed the pan with cooking spray, then added, just a tad of oil.  Good, easy, and cheap!

While these had good flavor, they did not stick together, so I ended up with a crumbly mess instead of patties.  If I made them again, I would maybe add more egg, or leave out some of the bread crumbs or cornmeal.

These tasted just as good as I had hoped but I don't think they are for everyone.  Great flavor & fun to make but I know my husband prefers his tuna in a casserole if he had the choice.  I will make them again, for myself.  I'm sure they would freeze well.

Sorry to say, but I didn't care for this at all ... I even added the additional Teriyaki sauce. It wasn't bad ... it just was blah.

i really enjoyed the consistency of these...they were MUCH better than the dreaded "tuna burgers" my mother used to make when i was little. i followed the ingredients exactly, but made the patties half of the size stated. i served them on beds of shredded lettuce and served them with wasabi mayo and sushi-like accompaniments such as wasabi soy sauce and pickled ginger. that was a big hit. :)

These were delicious.  I did not have the sesame oil or the cornmeal.  I did substitute olive oil for the sesame oil but didn't substitute anything for the cornmeal.  I thought they were great the way they were. My husband thought they were missing something and ate his with salsa on top. I can't wait to try them again with the other ingrediants I didn't have.

Excellent recipe. I love this recipe as does my roommate who can't stand canned tuna.  It has a great flavor.  Definite winner.

Adding the sauted onions is a nice touch as well.

Easy and delicious. I did, however, add about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and ginger as suggested by other reviewers.  Also, to add to the moistness, I added more Teriyaki sauce. But you cannot go wrong for a quick mid week fix,

Great recipe! The only things I do different is use chives instead of green onions because I grow them & use panko  bread crumbs in place of the corn meal for a slight crunch. I usually try & refrigerate the patties at least hour  to harden a bit before frying.

Very interesting.. I enjoyed these a lot. Instead of waiting to shop for teriyaki sauce, and, because I like spicy foods, I decided to sub Szechuan sauce, otherwise I followed the recipe as it was written. I served them in lettuce wraps with ramen on the side. Next time, and there will be a next time, I think I’ll make them more of a 1” meatball size and serve them with extra sauce. Maybe incorporate more heat with dried red pepper or a little sriracha. Overall, very good. I’m glad I tried this unusual, intriguing recipe!

Absolutely delicious patties, I ended up with more patties than the recipe says because I used more tuna and onion than the recipe called for, and it went excellently. My family loved them.

This was the second time I made this great recipe, though I made the following additions:
1/2 a medium red bell pepper, finely chopped
1 carrot, grated
(I wound up adding some extra breadcrumbs and egg due to the added volume)
dried red pepper flakes (to taste)
and finally I went with 3 tablespoons of teriyaki sauce instead of one. 
FINAL TIP: Make a double batch because they're awesome as a leftover!

Surprisingly tasty! I had doubts about 1 egg being enough to hold it together, but it worked out beautifully. I subbed black bean/garlic sauce for the teriyaki sauce, a full tablespoon, which was a bit too much; probably 2 tsp. would have been better.  Overall a great recipe; thank you!

As is, it's maybe a 4 star, but it needs flavor additions. I've made several times with different variations. You can add almost anything Asian. I've also added 1/3 stalk minced celery,  1/4  c. minced carrots,  2 T. tuna liquid, 1/2 t. lemon juice, 1 t. peanut butter with 1 t. olive oil as substitute for sesame oil. Others suggested croutons for the dry breadcrumbs & that's what I use. Plus, some crushed French fried onions f (bagged) beat out the green onions any day! You can use 1/2 flour for the cornmeal or a combo of these. Then you'll have a 5 star recipe!

These were very, vey good. Didn't have sesame oil, so I just used sesame seeds. Also, used egg whites instead of a whole egg. Boyfriend loved it! Very filling. Will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! Instead of cornmeal I used panko to cover the parties. Definitely would make it again! I also made a sriracha aioli sauce which complements it perfectly.  sriracha aioli recipe: 1 cup of Greek yogurt, 1/2 cup of mayonnaise, half lime juiced, pinch of salt and pepper and 2 tblspn of sriracha.

I used tuna my husband had caught on a deep sea fishing trip. This made good patties which we ate on a bun topped with the curry ketchup from this site's Easy Sweet Potato Fries with Curry Ketchup.

These are just no big deal. They were fine enough but really you can just taste the tuna. I served them with sweet chili sauce and that made them taste more Asian and it gave them more flavour.

These were great. I was lucky to have one. My kids loved them! next time I will have to double! They also would be good with some kind of tartar sauce for dipping. I put sriracha on mine because I like spicy.

I used less sesame oil, used a red onion, and added a bit of ground ginger. This was good, But the tuna is a flavor too assertive to overcome with the amount of Asian ingredients.  I served with stir fry veggies. I like that  this is basically a pantry meal.

Made a few slight changes:  I used oyster sauce instead of teriyaki, regular onions instead of green, sprinkled sesame seeds instead of corn meal, and baked instead of fried. My Korean father in-law loved it.

Delicious! A great new way for me to make tuna. I used yellow onions instead of green onions for a sweeter taste. This recipe is now in my recipe box.

It was a great take on the usual "salmon patty" concept!  The only thing I didn't have was cornmeal so I used panko breadcrumbs instead and they were still great!  I think the sesame oil and the teriyaki sauce really makes these!

Yummm! Such a great recipe. I had to add an extra egg, and I also substituted oyster sauce for the teriyaki sauce (I didn't have any). Will make many more times!

'Had leftover tilapia sooo, ya know ... & probably more than 12oz of it so I doubled everything except the bread crumbs & egg(omitted the green onions & subbed powder for the fresh garlic).  My teriyaki sauce was quite salty so with adding additional soy, the patties were too salty; not inedible, but no salt needed.  :D  Oh, since you're not really supposed to heat sesame oil, I added a t sesame seeds instead & added the sesame oil after cooking.  Eventhough I only made six patties as the recipe does & doubled the sauce part, they were still kinda dry. 'Smelled better than it tasted, but I still may try with tuna sometime - doubling the sauce as I did here.  No promises.  :)

excellent.  i had most of the ingredients except for teriyaki sauce and corn meal.  Instead, i added brown sugar and a little extra soy sauce in the tuna mixture..and i used corn flour for the patties before frying.  these taste great, and have a nice golden color.

These patties were good, however, I added double the garlic and some sweet thai chili sauce as well. Even with my additions I found that these guys were still a tad bit bland, I didn't get really any of the soy sauce/teriyaki flavour. I would still make them again but maybe with some more tweaking :)

This was good recipe. I say good because I thought it was a little dry. The only thing I changed was the corn meal and vegetable oil. I sprinkled with seasoned bread crumbs instead and I used cooking spray to cut back on the fat. Next time I am going to try and use more teryiaki and/or soy sauce and a little less bread crumbs to try and moisten the patties a bit more. I thought the patties had a wonderful taste with a hint of asian zing. Maybe could use a little ginger to spice it up a bit. But all in all it was very good and my family really enjoyed it. This is a keeper in my book, just needs a little adjusting. Thanks!

This is an excellent and easy tuna patty recipe!  I substituted crushed light rye crisp bread for bread crumbs, added another TBS of teriyaki sauce instead of ketchup, and 2 egg whites instead of 1 whole egg to make them lower in fat.  My kids (ages 3 & 4) loved them!

They had great flavor, were very easy to fix and will become a regular in our house. I changed a few things due to what I had on hand....subbed oatmeal for breadcrumbs and canola oil for sesame oil and omitted onions. They were very soft and difficult to handle before cooking but after cooking firmed up and stayed together.  Thanks for a yummy, healthy recipe!

I have made this recipe many times, and each time it is fantastic.  Goes over well with family and friends that pop in for dinner on short notice.  They are a little dry..so I'm looking for suggestions on a dipping sauce.

I didn't have cornmeal so i substituted Cream of Wheat for coating. I thought they were great. My wife thought it was too salty. Next time I'll use twice the teriyaki sauce and omit the soy. (I'll also check the salt content of Cream of Wheat.)

There are great. We have had these with rice, pasta and on even an open faced sandwice with melted cheese.  The first few times, I used the cornmeal in the mixture because of the large quantity, but only realized the last time that it was used to coat the patties - duh.  Great addition to my repertoire.

I followed the recipe exactly except for the following: I used crushed croutons instead of crumbs and used chives instead of green onions as I had none on hand. The patties were very flavourful but a little on the salty side (perhaps because of my substituting the bread crumbs for crouton crumbs, which are already seasoned?). They also fell apart a tad during frying. I will definitely make this again, when I have bread crumbs in the pantry.

These were just alright. It wasnt a very Asian flavor in my opinion and the chili sauce was kind of overwhelming.  I would definitely leave the cornmeal out if I was to make them again- it just made them gritty.

My family asks for these every week...sometimes 2 or 3 times. My variations - double teryaki sauce, no garlic (didn't have it on hand, but I don't care for it much anyway), no cornmeal (I don't use anything to coat). SUPER!

These were pretty good, but I just didn't think they were flavorful enough or that the patties were large enough, so I doubled the recipe and included additional sauce as a topping before serving them.

These were great and So easy to make. I was a little hesitant about the teriyaki and ketchup in the recipe, so I used something else. I substituted these two for Kraft's Asian Toasted Sesame Dressing and Marinade. It was So good! My husband loved them and has already asked for them again this week. Like another reviewer, I paired this with the Peanut Butter Noodles also on this website. They went great together!

Nice different way to use canned tuna; but only needs about 1/3 cup of cornmeal, the rest is wasted. Also, didn't have terriyaki sauce on hand so used hoisin sauce instead - result fine.

I love the idea of this recipe. But next time I'm going to change it up a bit. It didnt turn out as flavorful as I had hoped. The basic idea is great though.

My family loves this!  It's the only way we will eat canned tuna.  We love Oriental cuisine, and this recipe is quick and easy for busy nights when we want something other than the usual stir-fry. There were a couple of times that I was out of cornmeal, so I substituted breadcrumbs instead.  Still comes out delicious.

Originally had planned to make salmon patties but discovered mom-in-law, who lives with us, ate all the canned salmon.  So picked the first recipe I came across for tuna patties and it was this one.  Turned out delicious.  They were very happy with the results.

Hmmmm. These were just "OK." Certainly nothing to write home about (IMHO).... Made these for my bf and I tonight. I have been craving these ever since I first saw the recipe here on Allrecipes.com. I must admit that I had reservations about this (and to my dismay, they were correct).... Because of the ingredient list (all items that I like) and outstanding reviews, I decided to give this a try. Although not terrible, my bf and I agreed to never have these again (sorry!). I followed Michelle's directions to the T, but I wish I didn't... my tuna mixture was very dry. I would suggest adding another egg as many other reviewers have done. I'd also suggest refrigerating your formed patties for a while beforehand (I refrigerated my 5 patties for 1.5 hours - I don't know how I even got 5 patties out of this mixture????). One note: Be sure to watch these babies because they fry up REALLY fast!!!! Mine took 2-3 minutes per side MAX (and they were VERY brown - ikes!!!). Served alongside a boxed Thai peanut noodle mix with Arizona green tea as the beverage of choice. Maybe these will float your boat, but they just didn't ours. Thanks anyways :)

This is an awesome variation on tuna patties. I substituted Sweet Chili Thai Sauce for the ketchup for added zip. I found the cornmeal unnecessary so omitted it & didn't miss it. This has become a Friday night quick & easy go to meal with stir fried spicy veggies on the side.

Great way to use a pantry staple! I haven't tried the cornmeal, but do a bread crumb/toasted sesame seed coating before frying.  A nice break from salmon patties and less expensive than crab cakes!

These were delicious!  I took the advise of fellow reviewers and did not press the tuna too dry. I made 8 smaller patties instead of 6.  I also added 5 spice powder for more asian kick (also recommended by another reviewer).  I made them with peanut butter noodles - a perfect match!

I omitted the green onions, because my hubby is allergic, but these turned out great!  I'll definitely make them again.  I thought they were especially good paired with sliced pineapple on a sandwich bun.

Awesome recipe...thank you so much for posting.  This one we will make again and again.  I used a tablespoon of sesame oil and a bit less pepper...i used albacore tuna, and it needed another egg.  Can't wait to have it again!

this recipe is so quick and easy and tasty!! one of the few (I'm a new cook) that my boyfriend has asked me to make again and again!! the second time I made them, I upped the asian ingredients to try to heighten that flavor but it was still pretty subtle though nice--I may try to up it even more next time. these remind me a lot of crab cakes which is great because canned tuna is way cheaper than crab!! I made them with the peanut butter noodles like suggested and together it was all fantastic! thanks for sharing!

These are good! I made mine almost as directed- only since I didn't have sesame oil, I added in a teaspoon of ginger salad dressing. Next time I'd like to try making these with the white albacore tuna rather than chunk light. Definitely better than tuna and chips.

I don't know if I added too much or not, but the soy sauce seemed to overpower everthing else.  Overall I thought they were really good and I will make again and adjust to my liking.  I might even try with crabmeat.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was a great tasting recipe.  It was a tad on the peppery side, so next time I'll reduce, but my husband and I both loved these.  In fact, I think they were even better the next day as lunch left overs.  Yummy.

Very, very good. My young son was hesitant to try it at first, but once he did he loved it! It was a hit with the whole family, and we will be making it again. I did make one small change, however: We are on a tight budget, and while most things for this are inexpensive, the sesame oil can be a bit pricy. The sauce already has enough flavor without it, though, so I just added a touch of olive oil to keep the moisture. It worked great!

These are really yummy! My dad even loved them and he is hard to please. I use Soy Vay terriyaki sauce because it's extremely flavorful, unlike most and is a must try when using anything related with terriyaki!!
I will be keeping this recipe and using it for a very long time.
Thanks for sharing :)

I found that 1/2 a cup of corn meal was overkill for 6 patties that need to be "lightly sprinkled." I didn't initially give this to my 4 year-old for dinner, since I wasn't sure that he would even try it, but after tasting a bite of mine, he ended up taking a patty to school the next day.

My husband and I liked this recipe.  My 12 yr. old did not.  The corn meal didn't seem to go too well.  I wonder if bread crumbs or a potato coating would have been better?

I have never made anything with canned tuna, never ate a meal made with canned tuna.  This was fantastic.  It had great flavour and if I didn't know that it was canned tuna I would have never guessed.  I will certainly make this again. I followed the directions as written, didn't change a thing.

I came across this recipe simply to make something besides tuna salad for the many cans of tuna that we had.  We were quite impressed with these patties.  They were full of flvor and moist as well.  I doubled the Terriyaki sauce and also added about a tablespoon on chinese plum and chili sauce which was a great addition.  I also increased the garlic a bit.  We will certainly make these patties again and look forward to sharing this recipe with others.

I just thought these were really blah.  I added pepper flakes, ginger, five spice and chopped red pepper and it still did not have much flavor.  I cooked it in the oven and added another egg.  Maybe fried would be better.

These were fan-freaking-tastic! I didn't have sesame oil, so I used someone else's suggestion of peanut butter + oil. I also did not have teriyaki, so I used soy + ginger and honey. These were absolutely delicious and I will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was really tasty, my husband actually like it too.  And easy to make.  Served it up with some steamed broccoli.  I used italian bread crumbs and olive oil, cause I didn't have any sesame oil.  Would definitely make this again.

These were great! I'd been looking for a tuna patty recipe but most of the ones I'd found sounded bland. These weren't bland at all, especially since I added a finely chopped red chilli to the mix. I also substituted hoisin (Chinese BBQ) sauce for teriyaki sauce. The patties held together nicely. I served them like hamburgers, with tomato, lettuce and ketchup.

This was a nice, new way to utilize canned Tuna! I used tuna that was in oil (mistake that happened at the grocery store! lol) which may have actually helped it to stick together a little. I may replace the sesame oil next time just because I am not a huge fan of the taste, but I can tolerate it. I will replace it with hot oil. I used olive oil to fry these in and added some hot oil to that to give the patties a little kick to them. My husband really liked these.

These did not turn out very well for me. It could be my fault though because I was out of teriyaki so I had to use stir fry sauce. The flavor was very strong to me, but again , that could be because of the stir fry sauce. *Sorry*

I love this recipe!  I never add any sesame oil or green onions.  I also add some extra teriyaki sauce, only put 1/2 tsp. of the black pepper, and 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs.  I do not add corn starch.  I add just a little bit of bread crumbs on the outside of each patty.  Very good!!

These were good, though they still tasted "tuna-y" even with everything else in there.  I would probably put more seasoning in next time as we dipped them in soy sauce to eat them but they had a great crunchy outside and soft inside!  Thanks for sharing!!

These were just ok.  I served these as "burgers" on buns.  My 3 year old who eats anything in front of him finally found something he wouldn't eat.  My 6 year old ate about a quarter of his and pushed it away.  My husband asked to please not make those again.  Personally I didn't think they were that bad, but I won't be making them again.  Sorry!

I'm not sure what all the rave reviews are about.  My husband liked these but I thought they were just ok.  They might be better on a sandwich roll with some wasabi mayo, but they're a bit on the bland side by themselves.  I added cilantro, which I think is a must.

Love this recipe.  I make my patties smaller (usually get 10 or so out of a recipe) and serve them with hot Chinese mustard (a great way to use those leftover packets from Chinese take-out) and saltine crackers.  Serve Amy Barthelemy's Peanut Butter Noodles and some steamed broccoli alongside and you've got a great, easy meal. Even my picky teenage son loves them.

This was surprisingly delicious.  I added Thai chili and garlic sauce-about a teaspoon and it added some heat (not a lot) to it. I didn't measure out the cornmeal either I just sprinkled some on both sides and the extra egg white did help hold the patties together.  I will actually make this again because it was very good especially since its made with tuna (I used albacore).

My whole family really enjoyed these ; I did too, though seemed dry to me.  Without teriyaki, I added fresh minced ginger and some assorted Japansese condiments we had lying around.  Would be very tasty with a spritz of lime!

I only made half this recipe just to give it a try and was very pleased with this dish. An interesting way of using tuna and now one of my most favorite ways of doing tuna patties.  It has a different blend of tastes which come together perfectly, watch carefully because the cornmeal coating does tend to brown very quickly.

I was skeptical of making tuna patties but the reviews won me over. I followed the recipe as is and they were good! The cornmeal was an interesting but good pairing with the tuna. I only wish there was a yummy sauce included in this recipe. I mixed wasabi with a bit of mayo and it wasn't too bad.

My family really liked this recipe, and I liked how easy it was.  Only caution is that the recipe's yield is small--I doubled the recipe and still only made about 10 patties.  Tasted great though!

My husband doesn't care much for tuna, and he surprised me yesterday by asking for something with tuna for dinner.  I didn't want to do the usual tuna noodle casserole, tuna salad, or pasta salad, so I decided to try these.  They're ready in no time, and have an interesting and different taste.  My husband said I should make them again some time, so that's high praise!

Yum! So many flavors in one just perfectly mixed. Was a little hard to keep in pattie shape- very flaky. They were a huge hit that came with many compliments! Thanks for the new favorite.

These are very good!  I'm giving 5 stars because they are easy, inexpensive & tasty.  I had all the ingredients on hand.  Even my husband who was VERY skeptical when I told him I was making tuna patties, said he really liked them.

These were ok.  A healthy alternative to a regular burger, but still not as flavorful.

I have never liked tuna but I'm trying to be a little bit healthier, so I tried this recipe.  It is absolutely great!!  The only thing I changed is instead of using regular canned tuna, I used albacore.  This recipe is a must try!

My kids love these.  My husband can't have corn so I omitted the cornmeal without any ill effects.  I highly recommend these.

OK but nothing special - kids didn't like it & I found the sesame oil a little overpowering.

Pretty tasty. I took others' advice and sauteed the onions before stirring it into the tuna mixture.

I HATE the smell of fish....and especially tuna! This recipe camouflaged the smell of the tuna and it tasted great! Now I will definitely be eating tuna! Thanks for sharing!

I also left out the cornmeal and substituted wok oil for sesame oil/minced garlic.  I then added some Worcestershire sauce and some habnero sauce for a kick... turned out great.

My family thought these were okay. It was a good way to eat tuna, however, I thought they were REALLY salty. I'm not sure how to avoid this, but I thought I'd let you know. Thanks for the recipe :)

Both my boyfriend and I love these.  The only thing I do differently is omit the cornmeal (just because I don't keep it on hand).  These are great served with some steamed broccoli and Amy Barthelemy's Peanut Butter Noodles.

This is good! We are on low carb diets so I substituted low carb bread and omitted ketchup. I also lowered the amount of terriaki sauce as it is high in carbs to 1tsp.
