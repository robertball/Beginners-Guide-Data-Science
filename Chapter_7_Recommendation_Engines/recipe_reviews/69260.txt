This was so delicious!  I've given up white flour, so I used 1/2 cup buckwheat, and 1/2 cup whole wheat, and they came out fluffy and perfect!  I'll use this recipe from now on :)

Unfortunately I did not know to let the batter sit for a while (or overnight) before making the pancakes. They were good enough to try again. I love all the healthy ingredients. I substituted Smart Balance oil for the safflower. UPDATE- I've made these several times now and love them. I do a double batch, cook them between two pans on the stove to speed things up and freeze them. Letting the batter sit makes for a fluffy pancake. Beautiful and tasty,too.

Loved this recipe.  Dropped the white flour and used buckwheat in it's place.  It made just enough for two adults.  People are right that the batter changes as it sits, but that only takes 10-15 minutes to happen.  Tasted great with real maple syrup.  Also good with jam.

I have tried other versions of Buckwheat pancakes, but this is the best I've tasted.  Light, fluffy, tasty, and can be healthy!  For a healthier version use all organic ingredients if you can.  Use whole grain flour.  Replace the white flour with more buckwheat.  Replace the safflower oil with virgin, cold pressed coconut oil, use whole grain oatmeal (e.g. McCann's Quick and Easy "Steel Cut" instant oatmeal has not been pulverized, thus a lower hypoglycemic index), and use raw honey.  For improved flavor add tsp. of Vanilla.  Then of course use real butter and organic pure maple syrup as the coupe de grace!

I added a 1/2 tsp. of salt and used buttermilk. I made no other changes. It's best when using oatmeal or wheat flour that you make the batter beforehand and let it sit and soak up some of the liquid. I was cautious and ran the wisk through the dry ingredients before adding the wet, then stirred the  batter until just incorporated. These pancakes were light and fluffy with a slight nutty texture. Very good. You couldn't tell they were healthy. My kids and I loved them. I'm so making these again.

I love these and frequently make them for breakfast.  They're so easy to make and I use only 1 Tbsp oil because that's really all you need and they still won't stick.  Excellent recipe!

These are a very tasty way to get your whole grains.  My 3 and 5 year olds loved them!  I followed one reviewer's suggestion and used half whole wheat flour and half buckwheat flour, which tasted great.  I also reduced the oil by half.  For added protein, I added about 2 Tbsp of ground almonds to the batter.  I made a double batch and froze the extras; a double batch makes about 20 pancakes.  Putting some fresh grated apple in the batter would also be a nice addition that I'll try next time.  This is a keeper!

This recipe is for those who aren't necessarily die-hard buckwheat pancake lovers!  The pancakes bake up light and fluffy and the taste is mild, but if buckwheat flavor is what you crave - look for a recipe that incorporates a greater amount of buckwheat flour.  Real buckwehat pancakes normally do not rise as light and fluffy. but you'll get that great, old-fashioned buckwheat taste.

I used brown sugar instead of honey and made up bags for gift baskets at Christmas. Everyone loved these pancakes. Very easy and very tasty.

Good simple base recipe. I used 1/2 buckwheat and half whole wheat flours, used regular sugar instead of honey, coconut oil for the oil, and added a dash of salt. Came out nicely. I think I'll use the honey next time and add some ground almonds too.

These were delicious! I made them for dinner one night with a quiche. I did as others suggested and let the batter sit for a couple of hours.

I made these for some friends and family staying over a while ago, and they were really good.  I love buckwheat.  I think I used canola oil and old fashioned oats put through a food procesor, but other than that I followed the recipe.

This is a delicious recipe!  I chose it because it used whole wheat flour.  Instead of using all-purpose flour, I used another 1/4 c. buckwheat flour. I was not disappointed!  Instead of honey I used granulated fructose.  This mixes up easily in the bowl and cooks well in a cast iron skillet.  Fluffy and light.  We've already made this recipe more than once, and haven't changed a thing... because this recipe is perfect "as is"!  Thank you so much for sharing.

Best buckwheat recipe we have found yet.  We used applesauce instead of oil and added 1/4 ground flax.  Very moist and sweet.

used canola oil; added 2tsp vanilla and 1/2tsp salt, added 1tbls lemon juice to milk (2percent). didn't have buckwheat flour, used wheat bran worked great.  excellent flavor, light and fluffy (as needed for kids to like them) vanilla adds additional sweetness as well. will use again!

These are so good!  My hubby adds a couple Tbs. of sugar to give it sweetness.  We just used normal canola oil though.  The buckwheat gave it a nice crunch though!  Thumbs up!

This recipe is a keeper.  The first time I made these I used the ingredients listed except I substituted coconut oil for the safflower oil.  I followed one reviewers note to let them sit, so I made the batter the night before and cooked them in the morning.  They turned out great.  I've since tried my own spin on the recipe and used 1/2 cup buckwheat flour and omitted the all-purpose flour.  Also I used 2 Tbs of real maple syrup instead of the honey.  These also turned out yummy, although they had a much more pronounced buckwheat flavor.  
Thanks for a great recipe!

What a find this recipe was!  I love buckwheat pancakes, but my family never liked the heaviness or gritty texture.  I replaced the all purpose flour with more whole wheat one time and more buckwheat the other.  Each time they turned out fluffy and light with an incredible taste.  Both grandchildren ate them up and asked for more.  The one year old just wanted to eat them plain.  This will be my new go to recipe.

These are the best whole grain pancakes I've ever had!  They were light and fluffy and moist. I used whole wheat pastry flour for the wheat flour, but otherwise made them according to the recipe. So good with pumpkin syrup from this site.

Easy and very tasty. My children loved them! The baking powder makes them really fluffy, so don't omit it! I did on accident and poured the 1st batter in the pan, realized my mistake, and corrected it. The 1st were flat and hard the rest with the bp in were lighter and fluffier!

Awesome! Reduced the fat by cutting the oil in half (to 1.5 Tablespoons) and adding about 3 Tablespoons pumpkin puree. Did as another suggested and substituted buckwheat for the white flour. Also added a small pinch of allspice and a little splash (abt. 1/8 teaspoon) of almond extract. Thanks for this great recipe--yum!

Excellent!  I've been looking for recipes that don't have refined flour and sugar, and this one proves you don't have to sacrifice taste to eat healthy. I also added a quarter cup of milled flaxseed for even more nutrional boost.

Great!  I used kamut flakes instead of quick cook oats as that is what I had on hand.  Soaked the kamut in the wet mixture for 5 minutes or so.  Also, used 1/2 cup buckwheat and no white flour.  Incidently, I think these would make a great base for a savory pancake with some sort of cream cheese, herb, garlic blend for a topping with a little dab of caviar...but that is just me!

These were pretty good!  My kids ate them all and kept asking for more.  They have a pleasantly spicy buckwheat taste and were great with real maple syrup.  I used 1/2 cup white whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup buckwheat and I had to use old fashioned oats instead of quick, since that was all I had.  Next time I might try subbing buttermilk for the milk.  I also used coconut oil instead of safflower, butof course I had to heat it (and the milk, egg, and honey mixture) to get it to stay liquid so it would mix well, so I might try olive oil next time instead. I let the batter rest about 30 min before cooking and that worked well.  They were nice and light and fluffy.  thanks for the recipe!

I used almond milk in place of regular. I followed advice to let the dough stand for 15 minutes before cooking. The pancake dough was the right consistency. The pancakes turned out a bit crumbly. We will be making these again. Thank you!

Tastes great and is a good source of whole grains.  I reduced the milk a bit and made these in to waffles.  I did leave the batter sit for about 45 minutes because I used old fashioned oats instead of quick cooking.

An excellent pancake recipe. We use water instead of milk and it does not alter the taste. It has become our Saturday morning favourite.

Very tasty.  I might add a pinch of salt next time.  I made mine with fresh blueberries and they were so good.  The batter only rested for about 10 minutes and they were light and fluffy.

Delicious!  I eliminated the white flour, increased the buckwheat to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  Perfect!

yes, I added a  little more salt and a bit more sugar. My 101 year mom went to heaven 2 months ago. She had left in the freezer her buckwheat. but no recipe. I remember helping her fry it up but had no clue to the ingredients. I searched the net and found your website. It was perfect! I found three recipes that I wanted to try. I quickly wrote them down.  I made this first one just now and I got wonderful results.  Mom would be proud

I've made it twice now and the family and I just love it! Like some of the previous comments suggested I used buttermilk instead of skim milk. I also let the finished mixture sit for an hour which seemed to make the pancakes a lot fluffier. A couple other small changes I made were to cut out the white flour and just use twice as much buckwheat flour, which seemed to work fine. Also I used peanut oil because I dint have safflower oil. One last suggestion is to double the recipe. The doubled recipe was just enough to satisfy three adults in my experience.

For all those who don't especially care for buckwheat, this is for you.  It's fantastic, the oat flour makes the difference.  You can make it from oatmeal cereal.

Just wanted to add my thumbs-up and thank the contributor of this recipe. These are great!

We too have replaced the white flour portion with whole wheat. Initially I was wondering if these would turn out a little bitter, especially when excluding the white flour, but they're not.

The picky kid in my house enjoys these.

Since we don't buy skim milk, we just use 2% milk and water at a ratio of 2:1.

Also, since we don't have safflower oil, we substitute sunflower oil.

The point being, this is a flexible recipe, so give it a go.

I grind my own buckwheat groats for this.  Buckwheat is definitely an acquired taste, and this is a great way to fall in love with it.  My kids all eat these served with blackberry preserves.

This recipe is fabulous!!! The only thing I changed was to mix 1 Tbsp flax flour with 3 Tbsp boiling water, to substitute for the egg, they were tasty fluffy and fabulous!! I think you could get away with using 1 Tbsp honey, and I always add some vanilla and cinnamon...super yummy!!

I made these for my family after the holidays and they were a big hit. The buckwheat taste is very subtle. The pancake's texture and consistency are light and fluffy. I made the recipe almost exactly as called for, but substituted 1 Tablespoon of Xylitol sugar from the health food store and only 1 Tablespoon of dark honey to accommodate diabetic family members. Good enough to pass the most discriminating palate when served with warm applesauce with a touch of cinammon and butter.

I am so glad I found this recipe!  I am always trying to find easy healthy recipes to feed my family and this one is a winner.  I used soy milk instead of regular and I doubled the recipe and forgot to double the last three ingredients and it still came out great (the batter was a tad thick).  Definitely a keeper!

I thought I had buckwheat flour but the bag said "Barley" flour so I used that instead. I did add a dash of cinnamon and used buckwheat honey.  Also used 1&1/2 tsp baking powder which was fine, we are watching our salt intake. The wheat flavor seemed to predominate but they were very good.

This is a lot of work.  We use 100% buckwheat and whip the egg whites ,folding them in.  Also just baking soda.  no need for honey if you use syrup.

Added a scant half teaspoon of salt and a quarter teaspoon of cardamom. Added a tablespoon of vinegar to the milk to make it buttermilk. Delicious and fluffy served with blueberry jam or maple syrup.

Kids loved them!  I made them with gluten free all-purpose flour and oat flour in place of the ww.  They weren't very fluffy though, so I will let the batter sit next time for 10-15 minutes next time before cooking them.

Made this recipe (sort of) this morning.  I used buckwheat flour and all purpose unbleached flour in a 2:3 ratio, 3 Tbps coconut oil, and sugar rather than honey.  The pancakes were very tasty.  However, the amount of oil was too much, and they came out too oily.  Next time I'll cut it back to 1 Tbsp as another reviewer suggested.  Also, I don't think the sugar or honey is needed as we put pure maple syrup on top.

Tried this recipe. I remove the oats and added walnuts and walnut oil instead of safflower. Topped with bananas and some with fresh fruit. My family loved them.

this recipe is way faster than the pancake recipes I'm used to, so it's great for on-the-go healthy breakfasts. The oats give it a nice texture which goes well w/maple syrup. My pancakes took less than 15 mins to prepare and cook. I used olive oil instead of safflower oil so that might have made it cook faster...

My husband and I both loved these pancakes!  They turned out with great texture and flavor.  I used spelt flour instead of the all-purpose, and only used 1 T. of oil. We've been looking for a good multigrain pancake recipe and this one is it!

I wish these would have tasted more strongly of buckwheat, but they were solid pancakes nonetheless. They were very dense, but didn't cook up raw in the middle. I didn't add the full amount of oil, and I only let the batter sit for maybe 5 minutes and they still had some puff to them anyways. I might use 1/2 WW and 1/2 buckwheat next time.

This was a really good recipe, the only reason for the 4 stars is that it was just not like my moms buckwheat pancakes.  I liked that they are healthy and good tasting though, even my picky two year old ate them!
