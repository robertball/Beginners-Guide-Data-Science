This recipe was a hit at a recent gathering.  They are very fragile little tarts!  I recommend spraying the pan with a non-stick coating, and let cool before removing.  Several of mine broke apart upon removable.  They are very yummy though!

The squares were quite popular as party fare. I would recommend reducing the baking time by a small amount or watching it closely because the edges started to become brown after 30 minutes or so. I used a glass pan and an electric stove. They tasted geat, though!

Thank you! This recipe was great! I haven't mastered marbling so mine didnt look quite as nice as the one pictured...but it still looked pretty good and nobody believed that i made it! Thanks for the great recipe!  the only change i made was instead of making just a graham cracker crust, i did 1 cup graham cracker crumbs and 1/2 cup crushed oreo. Thank you for the great recipe! they turned out great!
