I hesitated to make this because there hadn't been any reviews on it yet, but I'm so happy I did, because all I can say is...wow!

I made 2 minor changes:

1) Reduced cook time to 45 minutes - glad I did as it was perfectly done by then and so moist.
2) Used 2 tbsp almond milk instead of heavy cream in glaze. Next time I'll just use 1 tbsp as I had to add a bit more icing/powdered sugar to thicken it up. 

Fantastic recipe - it's getting added to my regular rotation. Thank you Kim!
