Everything about this recipe is perfect! I brought it to Thanksgiving dinner and everyone was raving about it. I brought this recipe, along with a batch of my usual cranberry sauce that I make (orange-spice flavored) and this one was the clear winner.  Even the youngest guest (1 year old) kept crying for more! :)  I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. A new favorite! Thanks Leah!  FYI: my 12oz bag of fresh cranberries was about 3 1/4 cups, so I reduced the rest of the ingredients a bit.

I made it exactly as written except I used two pears and chopped them very small...any more would have been a waste of good pears. I did discover that a 12 Oz bag of cranberries is about 4 cups. The recipe made 5 pints of sauce.

This is a great option for people who want to eliminate processed sugar.  The pears and cinnamon stick were a nice twist. It was good-- different, but not better than the standard.  The smell of steaming vinegar while cooking was off-putting... enough to not want to make it again.

Delicious.  It is a little to sweet for my taste so next time the honey will be reduced to 3/4 c. and the pears will be cut into smaller dice.

This was absolutely delicious. Even the kids who usually donâ€™t care for cranberry sauce ate it up. This is definitely going to be made again.

Oh, I never follow recipes to the letter.  Hehehe...I put a  ton of that solid honey in, no cinnamon, no lemon...didn't measure anything...I used ginger apple juice....hehehe...and it was absolutely delicious!  The kids went crazy over it and there was not a drop left.

I tried it before it was completely cooled so I'm not sure if that makes a difference but the honey taste was a little too much for me. Next time I will decrease the amount a bit.
