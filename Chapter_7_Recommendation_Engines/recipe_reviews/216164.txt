This works a whole lot better if you use baking cocoa in place of the cocoa mix. You get more chocolate-y flavor with less sugar. I didn't have whole milk so I used a mix of fat free evaporated milk and fat free half-n-half. My kids and I thought this was great. Next time, I might add a little more peppermint extract.

This was excellent and easy to make...very delicious...I only had the baking cocoa powder and not hot cocoa mix, so that's what I used and it was excellent...have already made it 2 nights in a row.

I prefer using cocoa from the can too for this. Also use your own judgement for the extract 'less is more.'

I thought this tasted alright. I used the calculate button to change it to 1 serving to try it. I went to cook it in a pot, but it just wasn't enough ingredients for one drink to do so. I used the microwave instead and added the first 4 ingredients, in a large mug, and microwaved for 30 seconds. I then added the milk and flavorings and did an additional 1 minute. I did change it up some to lighten it up a bit. I used 1% milk and a packet of Truvia for the sugar. For the extract I added a drop of peppermint and 2 drops of vanilla extract. I have used extracts, enough, to know a little goes a long way. It can be added but not removed. I am not a big fan of making flavored cocoa from a packet. However, it did sort of taste like a thin mint cookie, although, even much more so with some Andes mints melting in the bottom of the cup.

Yum! This is an easy-to-make recipe! I shared some with a relative of mine, and we both thought it was great! Although I didn't have any cocoa mix on hand, I decided use two Keurig cups which worked out great! I also happened to use the rest of my peppermint extract, since there was so little left in it anyways. This recipe is a definite keeper!

This recipe comes out perfect with 1/4 cup of dark cocoa powder in place of the hot cocoa mix and taking the peppermint extract down to 1/2 tsp. It really does taste like a thin mint cookie!

I think this has way too much peppermint extract. I recommend 1/2 tsp and then tasting it to see if you want more.

This was pretty good. The only problem was that it was way too sweet even after reducing the sugar by half. I used 2% milk instead of the whole milk and pure peppermint extract (if you use the pure extract, remember to reduce the amount, i forgot to and 1 tsp was way too minty). I agree with Sarah Jo, it would taste much better if baking cocoa was used instead.

I followed the other notes and used the cocoa powder I had on hand. I also used cane sugar because I don’t use white. I used almond milk in place of whole. It tastes great. Just the right amount of sweetness and mint. I’ll definitely be using this recipe again.

It tasted...Interesting. It could have used less peppermint but it was good.
