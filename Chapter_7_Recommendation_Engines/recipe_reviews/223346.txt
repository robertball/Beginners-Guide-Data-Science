Very moist and flavorful meatloaf. This was a last minute deal so I used what I had on hand: one pound of lean ground turkey, two links of uncooked sweet Italian turkey sausage, panko plus 1 cup cooked rice instead of breadcrumbs, 1/2 an onion,a large red sweet pepper,  (no mushrooms) which I saut√©ed until caramelized. 3 minced garlic cloves, 2 carrots shredded, and cheddar instead of feta were added uncooked to the turkey mix along with the listed spices and an extra egg. Tomato paste plus some ketchup (no tomato sauce), along with cayenne and smoked paprika,honey, and balsamic vinegar made for a thick and tasty sauce on top. Even with my  sad list of pantry substitutions this turned out great. The meatloaf held together perfectly (I hate crumbly meatloaf), and the sauce turned out smoky, slightly sweet, and with a bit of heat. We had enough for cold meatloaf sandwiches the next day (equally terrific). Yum.

Fit for a king and for the queen! Absolutely delicious. Have made with beef as well as with turkey. Both are outstanding. Do eliminate milk because of lactose intolerance. Is plenty moist without it.

I really, really like this, and normally I hate meatloaf. I love how it's got lots of veggies (I add more) and it doesn't use beef. But what really makes it is the sauce!
However, it doesn't get 5 stars because it requires some changes (well, at least for my palate): 
1) The seasoning is weird. The "Italian" doesn't go well with the other flavors, so I would minimize it and play around. Also, I couldn't find the other mix, so I just added cayenne, salt, pepper, and garlic.
2) The sauce is too "balsamic-y" with just the few ingredients and there isn't enough for my taste. I more than doubled the sauce and added tamari, Worcestershire, sriracha, and instead of honey I used a pineapple habanero salsa from Costo (we can't get enough of the stuff). Obviously, we like things spicy-sweet. 
3)To cut down on carbs, I used less bread crumbs, and I used panko (because that's what I had in the house).
4)I served it with spaghetti squash. 
5)I upped the quantities of most things and for 1.5lb of turkey, we got 8 servings.

Excellent recipe but needed to scale down on the glaze. It wasn't absorbing as well as expected from recipe.

The husband said this was wonderful. He asked if it had blue cheese.  I said no, feta! Every once in a while you get a bite full of flavor.  The kids loved it too although it had mushrooms visible in it. I got lazy and tossed the carrots and mushrooms in with the onions.  I was so impressed that it held together.  I don't have the best track record for turkey meatloaf.

I made this recipe according to the directions. The only complaint I have is the cremini mushrooms used in the recipe are  rather expensive. I had to order them from the internet, because the local grocery store doesn't carry them. I cooked it in a loaf  pan.

Deliciouse! Very moist and flavorful! I thought it was going to be small because of the small amount of meat, but there are so many veggies that it makes up for it. This is definitely a keeper!

Delicous and really moist! Made exactly except I didn't have mushrooms and used dried thyme. I was leary about the crispy onions and artichoke hearts but it really gave it flavour. Doubled the glaze - used Costco's White Linen Marinara for the tomato sauce. All three teenagers and husband loved it too! We found a new go-to!

The only change I made was replacing carrots (I cannot tolerate them) with bell pepper. 

On day one this was quite a tasty dish. But, as with all meatloaf, you anticipate having it again on day two and possibly three. Well, it was completely dried out. It required a lot of adjusting to make it edible after day one.

Yummy - I was a bit skeptical looking at the amount of veggies - thinking it might be mushy.  Not at all - it was wonderful!

Based on the other ratings - I adjusted slightly.  I only used 2 carrots (Costco carrots are a bit larger then the grocery store) I didn't salt or use any of the creole seasonings 

Low sodium and low fat diet.  I found that I didn't even need to use the olive oil to cook onions - just a pump of olive oil - the onions, carrots and mushrooms have so much liquid - I found I didn't need it.

Always looking to add additional veggies in our diet - it really held up (I also used ground chicken) - surprised at how wonderful it turned out and how it held together.

Really good!  Thanks for the recipe and also all of the suggestions.
