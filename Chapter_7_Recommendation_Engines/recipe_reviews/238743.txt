You can't go wrong with fresh garlic and avocado. I followed the recipe as written but recommend broiling the bread or adding th garlic to the olive oil before it is baked.

Now why didn't I think of that!  I adore avocado and feta so it makes sense to pile them on top of crusty bread. No garlic necessary.  THANKS!

This was nominated but not selected for recipe group on the buzz. It looked so good I had to try it. The only change I made was to add the garlic to the oil before baking. This was really tasty and I will be making it again.
