I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  =) But I have made a few changes to it over many uses now.  First, I brown the beef chunks in flour to help thicken the sauce.  Salt is added at this step as well.  Instead of adding plain tomatoes in and jalepenos, I switched it to one (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes with jalepeno peppers - or green peppers - with juice (or you can sub in 1/2 regular diced tomatoes and 1/2 jalepeno for less kick).  I also don't just pour them in, I actually puree it up before pouring it into the skillet.  I add 2 large white onions to this recipe as well, because the onions (if you use just one) can get lost in this recipe.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Definitely a keeper!

This was reallly good!!!....I noticed alot of reviewers did not notice or really tast the curry component....I would suggest that you add the curry amount in the begiining as well as the end.... or just at the end if you dont want a real strong curry flavor....Like garlic and a few other spices the longer you cook them the more mellow in flavor they become....adding them to the end will definitely give you the intended flavor you were looking for in your dish.. If you are using fresh spices about 2 hrs...if you are using dried then 3..I always do this when I am slow cooking..and I always get the flavor of what my dish is suppose to taste like. :)
HOPE THIS HELPS!!

Really delicious! Instead of curry powder, I did 1/2 tablespoon of red curry paste and 1/2 tablespoon of roasted red chili paste, omitted the jalepenos and it was still plenty spicy. I skipped the first stovetop step entirely. Just put everything in the crockpot and let it cook for nearly 10 hours on low. The beef practically shredded itself. We ate it over basmati rice to which I added turmeric and black pepper for color. Highly reccomended.

Wow, what a great recipe! I am a low carb lady so this was easy to modify. I totally skipped the browning stage and just tossed the onion and the beef in the slow cooker then mixed up the rest of the ingredients in a bowl and poured it over the meat. I didn't use a jalapeno to save time, and simply used a jar of diced tomatoes with green chilies in it. I also added more curry powder and a little cumin, nutmeg and red pepper to suit our love for strong flavor and spiciness. When it was all done I fished the meat out and thickened the juices with some xanthum powder (availible in your local health food store). I served it with some sauted veggies. Very tastey!

Okay, I'll tell you what not to do.  Do not add the jalepeno with the seeds inside, don't add extra curry, or extra spice until you've tasted the original recipe.  My husband and I are still crying.  The good news it was good, but only with 2 or 3 glasses of milk. The meat was very tender, and I hope to try it again using my new suggestions.

This was absolutely delicious and the house smelled so good. I did dredge the meat in flour before browning and this seemed to have helped thicken the final product a little. Also added a bit more curry as we love the flavor. Wasn't spicy at all. Served over mashed potatoes this was almost decadent.

Family loves this recipe with 3 TBSP of mother-in-law curry and no jalapeno.  We like the spice not the heat. I also saute the onions first.

WOW!  This was really good.  If you are looking for a true curry recipe, look elsewhere.  This is a wonderful twist on a classic beef stew.  I didn't use jalepeno pepper but green chilis (kids don't like alot of spice). I also used a roast and then shredded at the end.  My 9 year old was picking the meat out of the crockpot!  Excellent over rice.  Will make again on a nice cold day.

Even after altering this recipe b/c I did not have some ingredients, it was awesome.  I used chicken, chicken broth, no jalepeno...it was great over jasmine rice.  Smelled terrific when we came home from church.  My kids ate *3* bowls of it.  Great idea, great recipe.  Will now try with beef!

This stew was wonderful!  I have already made it twice and served it on mashed potatoes.  My family thought it would not be good on the potatoes but they are definately believers now.  I used one can of diced tomatoes with green chilies to spice it up a little.

this is fantastic .. great flavor! I have made this recipe as is, and it's delicious!! the only thing I would do is to dredge your meat in some flour before you sear it... it makes a nice coating on the meat, locks the flavor in, and it also helps to thicken up the sauce while in the slow cooker ..so it's not so runny it's almost like a gravy.

for people who don't like too much spice, stick to this EXACT recipe (don't let the jalapeno scare you .. with or without seeds, there is no overpowering spiciness) .. for those who like more of a Ooomph in their food, a little kick... right when the food is done (I do mine for 6 or 7 hours), add another 1 or 2 tsp's (do 1 at first, stir and mix well...go by taste) of curry .. I find the curry flavor kind of gets lost in the diced tomatoes, so if you like your curry/spicyness, try that.. sometimes I add in another clove of garlic, and some more diced onion (half of a small one) towards the end, just for more fresh flavors, and cook until onions are soft...

I noticed the overall positive feedback for this particular recipie, and I think this a wonderful dish to experiment with, depending your taste.   I found that dicing up a few russet potatoes and layering them in helps thicken the dish and makes serving over rice or whatnot optional.  Otherwise use flour to thicken.  Another option is to serve over something like Marrakesh brand cous-cous, since it cooks much faster than most rices and is a bit thicker to mix or serve on top of.   You can also allow the meat, broth, and tomatoes to simmer a while longer, which reduces the water a bit. Add spices as desired.  Also, I agree with many other reviewers who used curry pastes over powder. I used Patak's brand Vindaloo Curry Paste (w/ cumin & chile). It is nice and thick and quite hot on its own. I think The best way to use this is to throw in a teaspoon or so while browning the meat, along with the around half the jalapenos and onion.  While I prefer fresh ginger and garlic, I found a wonderful product from Christopher Ranch - "Garlic/Ginger Stir Fry". Very hearty and puree style, quite sharp & fresh tasting. Excellent for many dishes. Sort of a short cut, but works really well!   I dropped a teaspoon in the skillet while I prepared the meat  and veggies, and added a bit more in the slow cooker later on.   As for the peppers, I used three fresh jalapenos (seeds included) and two fresh habaneros for real heat, and rounded the dish off with a diced green bell pepper.   I also threw in

This was very good & spicy!  I was craving meatballs, so I substitued them for the beef. I browned them before putting in to slow cooker.  I also added an extra chopped jalapeno and more curry.  Served with cooked egg noodles - EXCELLENT!

OMG, we LOVED this!  I used 1 1/2 lbs of stew meat, 4 cloves of garlic and a can of tomatoes with chilies instead of the jalapeno pepper.  Cooked on high in the crock pot for 7 hours and served it over white rice.  PERFECT!

I made this tonight and it turned out alright. My husband liked it and thought the taste was a medium heat. I thought it tasted ok but felt it had too much onion and Jalepino. I also would have preferred the tomatoes to be more of a stewed consistancy rather than diced. I will make this again for my husband with a little more heat next time.

I cooked this recipe as directed and I found it quite bland. There was heat, but not much else. It's definitely lacking something and I can't quite figure out what it is.

I made this using venison stew meat -- it was fabulous -- no one knew it was not beef.  As suggested by others, I floured the meat before browning.  I didn't have fresh ginger and used 1/4 teaspoon of powdered ginger.  I used 3 jalepeno peppers (with seeds removed, 5 cloves of garlic and added a bit of cumin and garlic powder.  I also added an additional tablespoon of curry powder about 1 hour before serving.  It gave it nice heat but not so much that the spice is a distraction from the great flavor. This is definitely a keeper in the rotation.

This was a delicious and very easy weekday meal.  I floured meat prior to browning, added baby carrots, peas, and diced yukon golds to make it a true one-pot meal, and served over jasmine rice.  After 9 hours on low the beef was so delicious and tender.  Thanks for sharing!

This came out really good but HOT!  I dredged the meat in flour, browned it in peanut oil and then deglazed the pan with beef broth.  I subbed beef bouillon and coconut milk for the beef broth. I also doubled the curry. I added sweet potatoes and two habeneros instead of jalapenos. I cooked everything in the slow cooker on low for about 10 hours. It made me and my husband sweat but yummm!

Loved this, it was perfect for a winters night. After reading some reviews, I coated the meat in flour before browning. I also used three times the curry  and added a teaspoon of curry paste instead of jalapenos.

Boy, this looked and sounded so good.  I couldn't wait to make it. Loved the smell as it was cooking but was so disappointed in the final outcome.  The meat was dry and while it was not as spicy as I feared, it lacked...taste.  I took another reviewers advise and coated the meat with flour before browning it but it was still very watery and again, not tasty.  I think IF I try this again, I'll put the salt and pepper in the flour when I coat the meat.  I've heard that salt will seal in the moisture of the meat.  Right now, I'm going to take some red wine with more flour and I'll try to thicken it up but it is too late for the meat. : (

I didn't really follow the recipe but I still really liked the concept.  I added cinnamon and coriander, used red pepper flakes instead of jalapeno, chicken stock instead of beef broth, lamb instead of beef, and tomato paste instead of diced tomatoes.  I also added carrots and potatoes.  I just threw everything into the slow cooker.  I wasn't intentionally being a rebel, but was just trying to use up some leftovers.  Next time, I'll actually follow the recipe :)  I really liked the idea of using ginger and curry in a slow cooker. I served over white rice.

Thank you so much for the recipe - we loved it.  We like it hot, so we adjusted the recipe a bit:  we doubled it to start (2 lbs stewing beef) and double everything except:  I added 1 tbsp garlic/ginger paste in addition to garlic and ginger, and used 4 tbsp of Sherwood Hot Curry powder instead of 2.  I also added 4 onions and some red curry paste.  As other's mentioned, I dredged the beef in flour before I browned it.  Excellent recipe - will be on our fav list!

I made as written, except used beef roast.  After cooking in the slow cooker I shred and use as the meat for taco/burritos or as a topping on nachos.  Thanks for the recipe

Very good. Will make it into my slow cooker favorite recipes. I too breaded the stew meat before frying it for a thicker sauce. I added more garlic and more curry but no jalapenos as my husband can't take the heat.

Delish! Made in the crock pot - 5 hours on high. Floured the beef and browned in a skillet. Used the diced tomatoes with the jalapeno peppers, just a dash of the red pepper sauce and added some diced green peppers and some mushrooms.  Otherwise, followed the recipe - smelled so good in the house!  Served over baked potatoes diced up - yum!  Had a nice flavor without being too hot.

The whole family loved it. We served it over brown rice. I had some left over roast beef, which I just chunked up/half shredded. I'm a wimp, so no jalapeno, but others added spice (Scorned Woman hot sauce). I will DEFINITELY make again (and again.) It contained three ingredients the hubs loves: beef, rice, and curry.

We really liked this recipe and we doubled it. We like lots of flavor, so we added 4 more cloves of garlic just halved, and then one more jalapeno pepper including the seeds. We also added a can of tomato paste to thicken it up a bit, a tablespoon of beef herb ox, and another teaspoon of chopped ginger. We put in water as needed and for our taste 2 dried hot thai peppers crumbled. We cooked it for 11 hours on low. We ate it over jasmine rice and it was delicious.

This was not spicy at all and needed a gracious amount of salt.  I probably wouldn't make this again as I like very strong flavors.  For those who like milder tasting dishes, this is probabl good.

This was fantastic and everyone at my house loved it!!  I am going to add corn into the crock pot next time.  (I also did not use a jalapeno)  It seems that this would freeze really well and I am going to try that next time when I make a double batch!!

Loved it!  I used chicken instead of beef (dredged in flour and browned before putting in the crock pot).  Put ginger and small can of jalapenos straight into pot after sauteeing onions and garlic.  Also added 1c baby carrots, one sweet potato peeled and chopped and doubled the curry powder.  Used chicken broth instead of beef broth.  Added canned tomatoes at the end when veggies were all tender.  Didn't need more than 4 hours on low.  This was great served over brown rice!
It had quite a kick and the leftovers are phenomenal!

This was just ok for us. I was expecting more Thai flavor--this was just beef stew with a hint of curry flavor.

Fairly easy and quick recipe- I don't know that browning the meat makes any difference.  I might try to skip that step next time.  I added some flour to the browning process to thicken, but perhaps not enough- it was still very thin, but tasted good.  Just enough heat.  Served over mashed potatoes- delicious!

Yum. We only had veggie stock, so we used that in place of the beef broth and added some cashews to the final product, and this recipe made an excellent dinner served over brown rice.

I really enjoyed this, although I did kick it up a little with some extra curry powder.  I also substituted coconut oil for the olive oil as well as a splash of coconut milk a two good dollops of Greek style coconut yogurt to the skillet mixture (what can I say, I like coconut!!)

This is very good with some green peas and/or chickpeas added.  You can adjust the thickness by adding more or less beef broth.  Good over jasmine rice.  Also, a good way to use up leftover roast.

Nothing special... used 2 fresh jalapeno peppers and not spicy at all. Think there are better curry stews out there... it is an easy dinner to put together but that's about it...

Terrific with a great balance of flavors. Not nearly as spicy as all the reviews made it sound. I didn't deseed the jalapenos and it still wasn't that spicy. Loved it.

Made this last night, great recipe!  I added more ginger and curry, as we like our spices strong...added cayenne for some extra heat.  Also coated the beef in flour before cooking and used sesame oil for good flavor.   Cooked in the crockpot on low for 8 hours and served over brown jasmine rice.  This ones a keeper, thanks for the recipe!

This was really yummy!!!  I read some of the other reviews and doubled the curry powder and I also coated the meat in seasoned flower like another reviewer suggested.  My hubby's tummy can't take fresh jalapenos, so I got canned tomatoes with green chiles and that added just the right amount of heat.  The only thing I will do differently next time is cut each of the beef cubes in half.  To make this more hearty, I added about 3/4 cup of lentils and I served it over cous-cous.  I put a dollop of plain yogurt on top.  Thanks, for submitting this, we enjoyed it!!

Yum....that's all I have to say. The only modification I made was to use 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper instead of the jalapeno because I didn't have one. The whole family loved it.

So good! I added red lentils and kidney beans too. also, added potatoes to one batch. You can't go wrong with this recipe I think. I doubled the curry powder because I really like that flavor. Thanks for sharing. I'd never made a stew before. this recipe sett me up for success.

I made this dish for Father's Day.  I doubled the recipe with 2 lbs stew meat.  The dish was tasty.  However, I thought 2 cans of tomatoes was quite overpowering.  I used stewed tomatoes instead of the kind recommended in this recipe.   The next time I attempt this dish, I'll use less tinned tomatoes and check for taste.  I served the stew with Mexican Orzo Pasta.  Great combination

... maybe 3 1/2 stars because I usually like stews more the day after.  Glad I tried it but probably won't make again.  I omitted the browning stage and just threw everyone in the slow cooker for 7 hrs.  It definitely has some heat so I'm not sure about other comments that it is not spicy.  I made sure to use the jalapeno's seeds and substituted red curry paste for the powder so maybe that is it?  Also, only used 1/2 cup of beef stock and added 1/2 cup of coconut milk.  Still very liquidy but worked out fine over rice.

This was good...I just didnt find anything different or great about it. I bought the jalapeno for this recipe(dont have much experience with them) and didnt think it was spicy at all. I think I would give this one a try again, maybe add more curry and cut the jalapenos bigger. Knowing how this taste I'm going to look back at the reviews and see what would make this great bec it has potential.

I love this recipe, very easy to make and tastes great. I added Potatoes and Carrots to make it a little more stew like. The taste of the curry in the beef came out awesome. I look forward to making this one over and over.

Wonderful! I loved the flavor! It didn't turn out very spicy, but I may not have had enough ginger.

Really good - I make this a lot in the winter.  Also use Pataks curry paste rather than powder to give it more oomph.  I will sometimes add a couple of tablespoons of coconut milk powder towards the end - really nice and transforms it into coconut-curry type dish.

I feel this worked really well. I did follow the advice of some of the other reviews and used a curry paste, Patak's Madras paste.  I browned my onions first, then my meat and added the paste with the garlic and the ginger. I then sliced up some potatoes and other veg to make this a meal in a pot thing, browned them off too, this is something I always do with the veg in stews or soups as I think it gives them a better flavour. Then I  deglazed my pan with the stock. I didn't need to add flour, you don't want a curry too thick, it needs a certain amount of liquid. I just found this to be really easy and tasty. Thank you for sharing it with us.

This was fantastic!  I served it over Jasmine rice. I definitely recommend using a good quality curry (the quality of curry you use will make or break the dish) Morton and Bassett is one of my favorites and easy to find.  We will definitely make this again and it was quite healthy too.  I think it might be tasty to add a red or green bell pepper.  I didn't find this spicy at all (but I cut the seeds out of the jalepeno since I don't care for much spice).

This was very tasty and I served it over Jasmine rice. I added extra jalapenos and thickened it with a little flour at the end. Good recipe for a cold day.

We absolutely flipped for this recipe. I am making it again tonight and inviting the neighbors! I followed the recipe exactly adding a tbsp of curry pouder at the end..  Oh, I used curry powder instead of curry paste because that was all I had.  DELICIOUS!!

I'm torn. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this after I made it? The beef was delicious (texture, etc), but the dish just seemed overpowered by the spice. There really wasn't a depth of flavor...just pure heat. I doubt I'll do this recipe again.

Wow this is so good! I doubled the recipe and the only thing I changed was that I added the amount of curry at the beginning and again near the end. This had plenty of spice and curry flavor.  Served over rice with Syrian green beans from this site.

I added sweet potatoes, parsnips and carrots to it. I also added extra curry, a touch of ginger and garam marsala because I love the spices. I cooked it in a deep frypan on simmer.  I also coated the meat in flour and it came out perfect and amazing.

I made this a second time and found it was better.  I didn't read the reviews the first time and it definitely wasn't spicy enough for us.  This time around I used red curry paste instead of curry powder.  I served over rice and steamed long beans.

This was great!
I added one peeled & chopped carrot; 1 Tbs brown sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  
The only negative things I could say would be that it was neither thick nor spicy enough for my liking, but that's all about personal preference.
Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very tasty.  I dredged the beef in seasoned flour prior to putting it in the crock pot...this made for a thicker sauce.  I also added a pinch of cinnamon and some chopped coriander at the end.  Rave reviews from hubby and my six year old.

This was very good but mine was over cooked just a little.  Maybe my new slow cooker is extra hot, but it was ready in 4 hours on low.  By the time we ate it the meat had fallen all to shreds.  Very tasty though.  Will start it later next time.

Wow. So delicious! The only change I made was to add some canned coconut milk at the end as we like creamy and curry flavor together. It was so great over rice. This one is a keeper and the house smells fantastic! Thanks Nanci!!

Very good and flexible recipe. I made it with a beef roast I had in my freezer. I cooled the roast slightly after it had cooked and then shredded it and added it back to the vegetables which I had thickened with some tomato paste. Also, I used more onions, garlic and curry powder than the recipe called for... but that's just a personal perference. Served it over rice... made a very nice dinner!

My boyfriend is from Africa, and I have a hard time finding recipes that we both love.  This was definitely a winner!  I add extra curry, jalapeño, and cayenne pepper too because my boyfriend likes his food spicy. But we loved it. The house smelled great,  and it was nice to come home to a tasty, hot meal after a long day at work.

Made this a week or so ago! The family LOVED it! Definitely a keeper! I seeded and de-membraned the jalapeno, and was a bit generous with the curry powder - I like the flavor. I'd definitely recommend adding "seeds and membranes removed." to the jalapeno in the recipe!

This was really good.  We had it with rice, but I might try it with mashed potatoes next time.  I did the canned diced tomatoes with jalapenos already in them.  I might add more plain tomatoes next time - the flavor was great but the tomatoes just looked so lonely in there. I always add extra garlic and I didn't really measure the ginger.  I didn't bother pre-cooking the meat either.  I never do - I find it comes out more tender.  Really great flavor.

Ended up needing a lot more seasoning.  I added 2 TBS curry at beginning and ended up adding another at the end.  Also add about 2tsp cumin, 1 tsp ground ginder along with the fresh ginger at the beginning.  I think what really made it was adding 2 tsp cider vinegar and about 1 tsp sugar.  Also, slow cooking for 4 to no more than 5 hrs is way plenty.  I made the asian coconut rice from here to go along side it.  In the end with all the additional seasoning it came out Ok, and a nice change.  May make again if I get into a rut of something different to cook.  Just not on my go to.

This was an extremely easy recipe to make.  I too, skipped the frying pan stage and just threw it all in the slow cooker.  I did add extra garlic, and I too used red curry paste and chinese garlic sauce.  I also added ground corriander and cilantro to the cooking phase and then more chopped fresh cilantro as a garnish.  Definitely in the make again list.

This beef stew turned out very well.  A rich curry and spicy flavor in a thick stew meat and tomato sauce.  Thanks Nancy!  I used beef tenderloin tips, a little extra ginger and 2 large Serrano peppers and about 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper with a tablespoon of curry powder and two teaspoons of garam masala.  I also used two large fresh diced tomatoes and a very large sweet onion.  I followed the assembly instructions and cooked this for 8 hours in my crock pot on low.  This yielded 4 large servings of wonderful stew!

I floured the beef before I braised it and used some substitutions-like powered ginger, sliced jalapenos from a jar, and hot curry powder. It was delicious and all got eaten right up. It was a little soupy, but serving it on rice took care of that.

I loved th beginning of this recipe but had to change it up to suit my famil's taste. I added curry powder to my flour mixture for dredging my beef. I used the coconut milk like other suggessted instead of the beef broth. I also added 4 chopped carrots and 2 large sweet potatoes. Towards the end of cooking I added a can of chickpeas.

Great taste when made as the recipe described. I would like the sauce to be a little thicker though. I might add carrots and potatoes next time to make it a bit more hearty.

Very nice. I didn't do the browning of the meat and it was just fine. Next time I will add some apple to give it a bit of sweetness with the spice, besides I love beef curry with apple. Thanks for the recipe

I thought this was OK.  I increased all the seasonings and it was still not tasty enough for me.  My husband liked it and we ate without complaints, but nothing to write home about.  I would definately use better quality meat than "stew meat."

I made this a couple days ago and followed some of the suggestions in the reviews  such as flouring the beef and using a can of diced tomatoes mixed with diced jalapenos instead of just tomatoes.  I didn't find it spicy (as in hot) in the least.  I found myself adding another tablespoon of curry powder at the end along with 3 dried chili pods to try to give it more heat.  The beef came out very tender, but despite the flour, the broth didn't really thicken.  It wasn't bad and I guess my expectations were influenced by seeing th word "curry" in the recipe name so I was expecting something a lot hotter and thicker.  It is a good, simple beef stew though.

Great flavor, but not spicy.  For more heat, add another jalapeno or curry paste.  I used extra lean beef stew meat and it was still very tender.

This stew was great. Easy to prepare and so tasty. I was disappointed and thought it would be much spicier. I added 2 jalapenos and still had no kick. If you like your food hot like me, add more peppers. Maybe next time I'll even try different types of peppers.

Make sure you buy a tender cut of meat, or tenderize prior to cooking. I made this recipe as stated, and the beef was very tough.

I changed this recipe a lot. I saw another recipe here (French Beef Stew)and I combined the 2 and improvised a little for a delicious outcome. I shook the Beef pcs. in a bag with flour, browned stovetop with onions, added to the crockpot with herbs, 2 Tbsp. mustard, a bay leaf,1 Tbsp. honey, ground ginger (to taste), ground curry (to taste), the beef boullion, tomatoes, and 2 Tbsp. vinegar. Served with minus veggies with breadsticks and  a side of corn.

Great stew!  I didn't have canned tomatoes so I used Rotels and we didn't have jalapenos so we used chili peppers from the garden (seeded.)  While I would make it again just as is, I would also try it with carrots and mushrooms and served over rice.  We had it over mashed potatoes.
Sticks to the ribs.  Great for a cold night.

This is very good and something I would definatly prepare again.  As recommended by other cooks, I added another large jalapeno (with seeds,) I upped the ginger by a half teaspoon and I always add extra garlic over what is called for in any recipe.  In this case, I doubled the garlic.  Next time, I will add a tsp of brown sugar.  For some green and added nutrition, I added cooked Trader Joe's organic green beans to the hot crockpot mixture, stirred, and served over jasmine rice.  YUM!

I didn't brown the meat before, just threw everything in the pot together and it came out wonderful.  The sauce is thin, so if you like it thicker, add flour.

This was excellent, I followed the instructions perfectly however I cleaned out the seeds from the jalopeno's and I must have lost some spice.  It wasn't very spicy and that is what I was looking for.  Will make this again for sure!

I've made this three times now and it's become one of our favorites.  It's so aromatic you can smell it from outside while it's cooking (if the window's open).  And it's so easy to make; we just serve it over mashed potatoes.

Thanks for a great recipe!

Aloha! 

All credit goes to this recipe as my inspiration. This curry was incredible. I used ingredients that we had on hand.

The recipe process was the same, made w/ the following additions/revisions:

- 1 T butter 
- 26 oz can spaghetti sauce (out of canned tomatoes)
- 13.5 oz can coconut milk instead of broth, but tomorrow I'll probably add broth to thin the curry
- 8-10 dried shitake mushrooms, reconstituted
- 1 T sauce from canned chipotle peppers (for heat)
- 1 large potato
- 3 stalks smashed, sliced lemongrass
- 1-1/2 T grated ginger
- I used 2 T curry + 1 sliced onion & 4 cloves garlic
- Salt & fresh-cracked black pepper to taste
- We BBQ'd steak & served it on the side instead of using stew meat cooked into the curry itself

I followed the instructions in the recipe, but cooked curry on the stovetop (since thin-sliced BBQ steak was served on the side) served on white rice.

I'm not a big meat eater, so I didn't cook the meat into the curry. That's why it's on the side.

It'll taste better tomorrow.

Thank you for the inspiration!

Love this recipe...and it's so easy to make!  As another reviewer suggested, I pureed the can of tomatoes (excellent suggestion because I hate tomato chunks) and dredged the beef in flour and that seemed to help thicken up the sauce.  Instead of a whole jalapeno, I pureed about 3 slices with the tomatoes.  Served over brown rice.  Thanks for the recipe!!

My husband and I LOVED this stew. Delicious! Really adds something special and different to stew. I made it pretty much as directed with a few changes, no jalepeno, ground ginger rather than fresh, tomatoes w/green chiles and onions, a sprinkle of cinnamon and a pinch of tumeric. I also added carrots. So yummy!

Wow, sooo good!  I made it two weeks in a row; big hit with the hubby!  We love Indian cuisine, and although not totally authentic, I love the flavors and spices.  It's a great alternative to regular beef stews!

This was very good!  Even my picky 9 y.o. loved it!  I served it over rice.  I didn't have beef stock on hand, so I used 1/2 of a package of onion soup mix in one cup of water.  It gave it a great kick.  The rest of the recipe I left unchanged - which is unusal for me.

I sliced the onions first, put them in the bottom of the crock, and then browned the meat.  That way I could just put the meat right on top without making another dish dirty.  I cooked this on high for one hour, then on low for 7 hours - perfect!

If you're looking for a curry dish, this isn't it. But it's a great stew recipe. I added extra curry and it still didn't have good curry flavor. I did like it very much, though. I used a venison roast that I cut up, and served over mashed potatoes.

I merged this recipe with one for curried lentil stew with coconut milk.  I cooked it for about 10 hours in a crock pot.  I used a chuck roast rather than stew meat and trimmed it of all fat, then cubed it.  I also made a dark roux to thicken the sauce.  It is excellent served over rice.

This recipe does not taste very curryish, but produces a good stew. I've tried adding more curry powder but it didn't help much.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I changed it so much just because it tasted so good!  I really hate runny curry so I added the flour for the browing as suggested but then also added a little corn starch and a can of tomato paste.  I also added baby carrots.  It turned out perfectly.  Mmm I can't wait to make it again!

Excellent. Added fresh okra to the pot. It is definately spicy, so if that's not your thing, then I would recommend cutting back on the pepper.

We loved this! - I didn't have the fresh Ginger so just shook a little powdered Ginger in - not the same I know.  Next time we will thicken the juice a little with some Corn Starch to make it more like gravy.  We served it over Bow Tie Pasta -yum! and easy

this is easy and quick, although not hot as promised.  if you like it spicy you will need more jalapeno. As the reviewer below, dredging the beef in flour helps thicken as mine was fairly thin prepared as offered. I also cut the stew beef into smaller pieces that would be easier to grab with naan. overall it is simple, quick and good...just what we are looking for.  thanks

not really spicey at all - but a nice recipe. I brown the beef after dredging in a bit of flour, keeps the meat from becoming too rubbery but I like it!  Some scallions when serving next time would be great.

Vert tasty.  Added a 750 ml of tomatoes by mistake which made it very tomatoey.  To counteract, I added a can of chick peas and coconut milk.  I liked it with additions so much that this how I make it now.

really nice taste. The sauce is way too watery, and I would leave the cup of water (or beef broth) out next time. I cooked this in my Instant Pot electric pressure cooker, and it was done in 35 minutes.

This recipe was good, but it could use a little additional flavoring. With some more tweeking I think I can get it really good. I followed the advice of some other reviews and browned the stew beef after coating it in flour. I didn't bother to saute the jalapenos because they were from a jar. I also added carrots and potatoes and to compensate for the extra veggies I added some more beef stock so they were mostly submerged. I added almost equal amounts of sugar to the curry powder to bring out the flavor. I added more curry powder and pepper about an hour before serving to bring out more of the curry flavor. I think it would be good to add some more ginger, salt, and if you like spicyness, sirachi, chili or hot sauce would probably compliment it well. I also added about 2 tablespoons of corn starch mixed with beef stock to thicken. I served it with egg noodles.

Very Easy to put together. Right amount of spices. The only thing I had to do different was use a can of diced chile instead of adding jalenpeno. I didn't have the jalenpenos on hand. Definitely will do again

I thought this was excellent, but my son said it was too spicy and my husband said it wasn't flavorful enough. I think my husband's problem was that he was expecting a curry dish, but it is really just spicy beef stew.  Next time I may add more curry, coriander, cumin and cinnamin to see if I can turn it into a curry dish for my husband. I personally like it as is :)

This recipe was really good and the flavors in it were awesome.  My husband loved it too.  Instead of one onion I used two, I left out the jalapeno completely and added red pepper and spicy green chiles, and I thickened it up a little with some cornstarch.  Definitely a keeper!

If you want this to be spicy use jar jalepenos instead of fresh.  I made as stated the first time and was disappointed that it wasn't spicy.  The second time used the jar ones and tomato puree like another reviewer suggested and it tasted and looked more like what you would get in an Indian Restaurant.  Much thicker.  But the beef broth was a little overpowering.  I will water it down next time.

I tried this recipe as I had some stewing beef and hadn't used my crock pot for a while.  It is a nice twist from the usual curry recipes I've made.  The meat was very tender and flavourful and I decided to add some potatoes to go along with the 'stew' theme and found they complimented the recipe well.  I served it over some rice and it made a good hearty meal for the family!  Good recipe!

Served at a dinner party, and turned out really well! We actually used beef neck (never tried this before, and is a cheap cut of meat) which was quite marbly and turned out very tender and yummy! Will make again

Excellent!  I used green chiles instead of jalepenos because that is what I had on hand.  Also, skipped the browning step as I was short on time... turned out great!  The sauce was a little thin so next time I might add a little flour to the beef like I do in my other stews.  Thanks for a fantastic dish!!

This was good.  BUT...it definitely needs spicing up.  I'm pretty good at "doctoring" my recipes, and this was one of them.  The heat was just right, but I added almost twice the curry, garlic salt and lots of pepper.  Served it over rice.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but I followed this recipe to a T and it tasted and smelt awful! Would not make it again.

OK. It was good, somewhat spicy, and did make the house smell rather nive while it cooked. It didn't seem to fill up the crock pot, I'm contemplating making it again with a load of potatoes or other starch added to cook with the meat and sauce. Or perhaps a load of vegatables to make a stew...

This turned out great!!  Not too spicy.  Used mild curry powder and added extra as suggested by other reviewers also added some mushrooms and red peppers (get extra veggies in anywhere I can) and a few spices we like.  Will make again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

this was really good. we served it over rice and everyone enjoyed it. i do suggest adding the curry near the end as others suggested because the curry flavor mostly cooked out. i added more and it was fine. thank you

I have a new love for Curry! This was awesome. I followed other suggestions and added extra Curry at the end, and I'm considering an extra Jalapeno. I used cornstarch and water to thicken at the end, and served with mashed potatoes and steamed carrots.

This dish was easy and sooooo spicy! We didn't have fresh jalepenos so we used the stuff in a jar. Still came out tasty but don't scoop too much like we did! The jalepenos end up blending in with the curry, making it blazing hot! Muy caliente!

This was a really good, and easy recipe to make.  If you like really spicy foods I would go ahead and up the jalapeno's and such.  I did not think it was quite spicy enough.

Great and very easy.  I used "hot curry powder" that I bought at an Indian spice shop.  Served over plain couscous (only takes a few minutes to make).

A tasty meal.  Served over rice.  Changes:  shook cubed beef in zip-lock baggie with flour (basically, to thicken the broth--which it really wasn't very thick at all, but, worked out fine with the rice) before sauting in pan.  Added a can of Rotel Tomatoes instead of regular diced tomatoes & jalapeno--because it was all I had--and it worked out well.

Very easy.  I took the recommendations of a reviewer and threw everything together in the slower cooker before heading off to work.  Came home that night to a perfect beef stew.  Will maybe think of adding spinach to the cooker about a half-hour before serving, to get some greens in.  Served over basmati rice.  So good.

This is a good, hearty and filling meal.  I served it with brown rice and steamed broccoli.  My ginger had gone bad, so I had to use dried, and I also used cayenne in place of the jalepeno.  I browned the meat, and added everything else except the onion and broth- no need to remove the meat before adding the garlic, etc.  I added the whole can of (low-sodium) broth.  This was easy and flavorful!

My family absolutely raved over this dish. And the beauty of it is that it is even better the next day! I cook it exactly as directed and then serve it over real mashed potatoes. Even the kids loved it. It's got a little kick, but not so spicy that it makes the kids fuss! I've made this several times and it is a family favorite!

This was okay, but not spicy enough for my husband and my taste. I cooked everything in the crockpot as suggested, and the next day I reheated it on the stovetop and added curry paste for some more flavor. I will make it again but next time I'll add at least a teaspoon of the curry paste at the start and add a lot more onion.

I loved this but hubby and kids thought it was too hot even though it was delicous. Like other reviewers, I also just threw everything in to the crockpot and let it cook overnight and it came out great without the extra work of browning, sauteing etc...I added 2 extra onions, threw in some potatoes, and used ginger powder because I didn't have fresh. Next time I'll only add half a jalapeno. Yum.

This is a great basic recipe, as evidenced by all the suggestions for variation.

The only thing I can add is that it freezes well. As a single woman, I double the recipe and freeze containers with two servings each since I have no problem eating the same thing two nights in a row.

I've had it over baked potato, rice, couscous, and drained ramen noodles. I've also just scooped it up with pita bread or whole wheat tortillas. Always tastes good and so convenient.

We really like spicy foods so after reading the other reviews, I was concerned it wouldnt be spicy enough. I added a habenero pepper to the one jalepeno and  used tomatoes with chiles. I left the curry as it was though.  I also added red potatoes and carrots.  It turned out REALLY REALLY spicy, but that's how we like it. It was awesome.

Like some others, I found this was good, but the curry componenet was barely noticeable.  It ended up as a basic stew, more or less.  It was still good, though.

Unbelievable dish.  Wife cut back on curry out of fear that it would be too hot...will use full amount next time.  We like spicy and flavorful.  Will be remaking many times.

I loved this recipe! I made it with 3 lbs of beef chuck I cubed myself. I prefer the meat’s quality that way. I Browned the beef In batches
Making sure it got a good sauté. 
I used one can of stewed tomatoes and two cans of diced tomatoes and I added a really
Big  cubed yam when I added 3
Cups of beef broth.  
I increased the curry to two Tbs and added at least 3 more tbs of grated ginger. I did not add
Jalapeño peppers.
I served with mashed potatoes.
Loved by all at a family
Dinner!
 Thank you so
Much!

This was great.  I decided to use two 10.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes with hot chilies instead of plain diced tomatoes and fresh jalapeño, and I consider it a good time saver.  

We will absolutely make it again.

Delicious with the following edits:
- Added sweet potato and green pepper
- Skipped step 1 and added all to the  crockpot on low for 10 hours
- Added more curry to taste (maybe double?)
- Skipped jalapeno step, and used instead a can of diced tomatoes with chiles (Rotel).

I’ve made this quite a few times since I found the recipe. First I sauté everything together onions included. I also use a TBSP of ginger and 2 TBSP of curry. I also use two jalapeños because we love spicy food!  I love this recipe and is always a big hit.

Very tasty! As with many reviewers, it’s not super Indian flavored or very spicy as is. We substituted a habenaro pepper for jalapeño pepper, because our store was out, and we like to live dangerously.  We are very glad that we did. We ended up adding quite a bit of curry (Penzey’s Vindaloo) to our own bowls toup the Indian flavor. We also toyed a bit with light coconut milk which added a nice flavor. Next time we will probably put a can into the crock pot & let it deepen the flavors. We also like potatoes, carrots, and corn in beef stew so we added them. We served with Basmati rice which helped stretch the servings.

I really liked this, and it wasn't particularly spicy.  In fact, my one-year-old has been eating it all week, and loves it.  I served it with rice.

Made exactly as set out. It was excellent, and spicy, and we LOVED it!  Reason for 4 stars is because I would have liked it a bit more saucy, ie slightly thickened so next time, I'll brown the beef in flour. Will definitely be making this again.

I have made it several times. The only thing I changed on it was using  sea salt (gives it more flavor apposed to table salt) and adding some chillies to it.

Will definitely make again.  I added an extra 1/2 onion, 1 carrot, and a handful of green beans.  I also added an extra 1/2 cup of beef broth because it was a little chunky for my taste after the addition of extra veggies.

Used tomato with green chilis rather than jalapenos and added extra curry powder. Still could have used more spice.  I wanted to roll the beef in flour but realized I was out when I started to make it so I may return to it and try that again.

Love it, make it about once a month and freeze some portions. Serve it over mashed potato and I add a chopped sweet potato to the crock pot on top of the meat, think it works well. Otherwise, I make exactly as is except for using a habanero from my garden instead of jalenenos.

Oh my. I had a round roast in the freezer to use up so came upon this recipe. I actually have never had beef curry before, but the idea appealed to me. I did brown the beef and it's well worth it. I really wanted some veggies in here, so added a sweet potato and cauliflower. Very good additions. How good and how spicy your finished dish will be depends very much on the quality and heat of the curry powder you use; it can be extremely different across brands, even across home made recipes. I served it on jasmine rice. Outstanding meal, I'll be making this often.

Loved this recipe!  I served it with brown rice and fruit.  My family loved it and has asked when we will have it again.  I also have made it and put everything in a freezer bag at the end of step two and frozen it for a later date.  We love curry so I added a little extra curry, both mild and hot.  Terrific stuff on a cold night.

Great cold night recipe!  I didn't brown the meat in advance, just mixed it with flour in plastic bag.  Added carrots, potatoes, onions and green peppers to slow cooker, then mixed spices and tomatoes in a separate bowl and poured over meat and veggies. Voila, an easy, tasty treat!!!  I liked the extra heat from jalapenos (w/ canned tomatoes) but they can easily be left out.  Thanks!!

This dish was fantastic, and so easy to make.  I followed another reviewers advice and used canned diced tomatoes with jalapeno's, just to save on time.  Amazingly good!

This is very good!  I added 1 potato and flour at the end to thicken the broth.  Next time I won't thicken the broth, it go to thick.  I browned the meat after coating it with flour and curry powder mixed - that is enough.

Over all very good.

This was a different way to make stew for me.  I liked that it was so easy to prepare.  The liquid was thin even though I dredged the meat in flour before browning.  I will tinker with the liquid next time, I will definately make this again.

I took the 2 most helpful and combined them. This wasn't anywhere near as spicy as the reviews, in fact I tripled the amount of red curry paste, threw in 3 jalapeños AND added in 2 tbls of fresh ground red peppers. While this recipe was ok, it isn't something I would make again.

I took the advice from some of the reviewer and use red curry pepper paste and roasted red chilli paste instead. Following other reviewer, I also added 1 tsp of turmeric. Turns out pretty yummy. Next time I'm going to add carrots on mine.

I followed cheffernan's advice along with the recipe and the result was absolutely delicious.  I did "cheat" and cook on the stovetop - it was ready in the same amount of time that boring- spaghetti would have taken!  We love spicy food, so I used a can of diced tomatoes w/ green chilies, plus 2 fresh serrano chilis and a heap o' curry powder.  I served it over couscous (w/ cooked collard greens on the side) and it had a very Moroccan/North African sort of vibe to it, which is what I was hoping for.  I can't wait to make it again and try some variations!

The store was out of fresh jalapenos so I substituted jarred.  Worked fine.  I also doubled the amount of curry powder and thickened it up a bit with flour at the end.  Very yummy.

This was good if you're looking for a quick and easy beef stew to cook in the crock pot.  Added potatoes to mine.  Needed more flavor though.

Not bad...added one green pepper.  Was very soupy, will try dredging the meat in flour next time.  Also used only one jalpeno pepper, will try two next time with a little more curry powder for more heat

This was very tasty!  I didn't have jalapenos in the house, so it wasn't as spicy as I would have liked, but nevertheless, it was a very good stew.  My husband also liked it.  It was easy to make, and I will definitely make this again!

Very good and easy. We found it pretty scipy but perfect for us.  Will make again.  I had a shower after making this and then picked up my son at a friends house.  He could smell the curry on me still!!!!
