This recipe was AWESOME. First for the ease and second for the taste. I would have given 5 stars but I added mushrooms, parsley, parmesan cheese, lemon juice & zest and crushed red pepper (my preference) because it was a bit bland. After adding my personal touch, it was absolutely fabulous! I will make this again and again! I served it with a marinated steak, salad and garlic bread.

I used low fat cream of mushroom soup and 3 Tbs. of butter instead of 4 to make it lower in fat. It is even better when you add parmesan cheese to it. My husband aka: the pickiest eater in NY loved it!

I made this recipe exactly and used 1 lb of shrimp and 2 cups of small bay scallops.  Some of us sprinkled on some grated Parmesan cheese.  I give this recipe 5 Stars because it is the closest you'll get to an "Alfredo" Sauce without all the cream.  My health conscious husband remarked that it looked fattening.  I was so happy to tell him it really wasn't too bad!  Next time I will try cutting the butter in half and see if it makes a big difference in the taste.  I will also add more seafood because all the shrimp went and there's none left in the leftovers.  (Not that much left over anyway!)  Thanks for an excellent recipe!  I can't wait to make it for my Dad!

This recipe is the greatest!  All I had on hand was mock crab so used just that.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect, according to my taste.  I sprinkled Parmesan cheese on my serving at the table.  My husband warmed up the left overs the next day for lunch, so I guess he liked it too!

Quick, easy recipe!  I used a bit less milk and butter and low-fat soup.  I added a bit of pepper and Mrs. Dash to add a little spice and also used fresh mushrooms.  I will use this again!

Tastes fantastic once you add the little extras suggested by previous posts.  I can hardly stop eating it.  I grated in some Parmesian Reggiano rather than regular Parm because I had just had to buy it and hadn't had anything to try it in yet, fantastic stuff.  Substituted 1/2 c. 1/2 & 1/2 for part of the milk also.  This was just delicious.

This is a great, easy dish for the weekdays. I used artificial crab meat, low-fat mushroom soup, soy milk, added a little green and red pepper, and spices (oregano, basil, seafood seasoning). I will make again.

We didn't like this recipe. I think it had too much garlic and onions in it and the consistancy didn't settle well with my stomach. Won't make this again.

I used less butter, fat-free milk, Healthy Request cream of mushroom soup, and no scallops, but the dish turned out pretty tasty. I also threw in mushrooms.  That said I think I'll use a bit less milk next time, since the sauce was a little bit thin. We also don't seem to have used much of it as leftovers, unfortunately-- I think a little something to add a bit more savoriness to the sauce (perhaps some garlic salt) might help.  Still and all though, quite good and easy.

Yes this recipe was easy but the
cream of mushroom soup over powered in taste. Also too much onion by far for my likeing. I added some cayenne pepper in a last stich effort to save the dish before serving,  which helped but next time I will use a diferent recipe.

This was the easiest and most tastey dish, so quick and flavorful!  I did use half/half cream instead of the flour to add some texture and it turned out smooth and creamy.  Will definitely make again with other proteins.

I made this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it! However I have never tried scallops so I didn't add them. Also it had a strong taste of garlic, which I love anyways, so I suggest if you are not a fan of garlic then take away a couple of cloves. I also has a strong seafood taste too :) the crab and shrimp taste great together. I have made this dish three times already and I plan on making it in the future too :) Very good! Thank you!

This recipe was very easy and tasty!  I did make a few modifications, though.  I cut the soup in half and used fat-free half & half instead of milk.  I added oregano, thyme, red pepper, bay leaf, grated Parmesan, Romano, & Asiago cheeses, salt, & pepper.  I had to use a cornstarch slurry to get the mixture to thicken up a bit.  I used shrimp only, because that was all I had on hand.

Just made this recipe and it was pretty tasty.  I did add cream cheese and a little less milk, which worked out good.  Next time I'll add more cream cheese and less milk to make it creamier.  I also added nutmeg, cayenne, and oregano and this gave it a lot more flavor.  We only had scallops but it still turned out well.  Thank you Anita for the recipe.

Absolutely delicious served over angel hair pasta! The only thing I changed was adding some cayenne as well as garlic powder to enhance the minced garlic. Hubby and kids all loved it!

I liked this recipe as well but found it somewhat bland for my tastes.  I followed another commenters recommendations and added crushed red pepper; as well as a few fresh chopped mushrooms, parmesan, feta and roasted red pepper seasoning for a kick.  After that it was great!

More like a 3.5, it was pretty good. I added fresh mushrooms, used green onions instead of white, reduced the butter to 3 tablespoons. Only had a pound of scallops for the seafood. It was good, but not exceptional. Leftovers reheated pretty well but i got lots of cracks at work about it smelling super fishy. Not my favorite seafood recipe by far.

It was OK....a little bland, so I added some yellow mustard, pepper, & Italian herbs till I liked the flavor to bring it up to 4 Stars. Also, I just had shrimp on hand, so if I would have had the scallops & crab that would have most likely added more flavor to the initial recipe.

Yummy, easy to  make and the family ate it up!  Just would recommend that you add seasonings as it was a bit on the bland side for my tastes.

Delicious.  I added a little more bay scallops and crab meat because I served it as a main dish with just salad and bread sticks.  It was wonderful.

I loved the recipe.  I added the juice of one lemon to give it that zip that only lemon can give.  It was served with a Filet Mignon for a rather nice Valentine Dinner in the comforts of our own dining room.

WAAAAAAAY too much sauce! I had to remake it. I thought for sure it wouldn't come out as saucy as it appears. I remade it, sautéing with coconut milk instead of mushroom soup. Healthier too and looks so much better. Try that. This recipe version wasn't good for me at all, sorry.

WHEN I TELL YOU THIS IS THE BEST FETTUCCINE ALFREDO I HAVE EVER TASTED! It does not taste like you used Cream of Mushroom soup! It tastes like a restaurant quality  dish. Everyone needs to try this!!

Submitted a picture, but forgot to submit a review; sorry Anita! This recipe was just what I was looking for as my husband's boss gave us a pound of scallops and neither us really like them. I loved the simplicity of the sauce. I sauteed mushrooms with the onions and garlic, as I had them on hand. I also used clams instead of crab, though I think it would have been fantastic addition. All in all a wonderful recipe, thanks Anita!

Good, easy to follow recipe.  I added some Parmesan cheese to the sauce which added a nice flavor to it, but besides that I followed the recipe as stated and it came out well.  I used imitation crab meat which tended to soak up the liquid in the sauce and become a bit soggy so I suggest using real crab meat if you have it on hand.  All in all I would make this again.

This was really good!  I used 2 tbl of butter instead and no onions.  I also sauteed some sliced shittake mushrooms with the butter and garlic.  I threw in some fresh brocolli with the scallops and shrimp.  For spices i added some salt, black pepper, dried oregano, dried basil and nutmeg.  After it was done I threw in some chopped italian parsley and 5 italian shredded cheese but next time I will add just shredded or grated parmasean cheese for the cheese.  It turned out great...will try it also with some canned clams next time in it too.

Easy recipe to make. I used a frozen mixed seafood blend with shrimp, scallops & calamari from Trader Joe's for the seafood and it worked perfectly! I also added a little salt and pepper to taste.  Otherwise left recipe as is!

I thought that this recipe was a good BASE to work with.  I added Bay Seasoning and fresh garlic to my mixture to give it a little more taste.  That said, it's MUCH easier (and faster) than traditional alfredo-type sauces, and since I generally keep cream of mushroom in my pantry, this is a recipe that I'm sure to make again in various dishes (I think adding some sliced mushrooms and pouring it on top of chicken would be delicious too!).  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this the day before Thanksgiving and was pleasantly surprised. Very tasty! Cut the butter to about 2 tablespoons and didn't add any onion. Used skim milk and added an 8 ounce package of mushrooms that I sauted until cooked. Used 8 ounces of bay scallops and about 6 ounces of imitation crab. We were all very surprised at how "restaurant" it tasted! Warning though!! It makes a TON of pasta!! Could easily serve 6! Had lots of leftovers which is NOT a good thing the day before Thanksgiving :-)

Quick, easy and a low-fat alternative to traditional Alfredo sauces.  The only additions I made were to add nutmeg and pepper.  Will definitely keep this recipe handy for a standard weekly meal.
