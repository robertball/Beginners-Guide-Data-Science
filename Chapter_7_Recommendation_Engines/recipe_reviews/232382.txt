Thank you for submitting this recipe.  This was the first time I tried a recipe that had not been rated and I sure am glad I did.  These cookies are soft, chewy and so, so delicious.  If you love the combination of coconut and dark chocolate you should make a batch of these, stat!  I followed the recipe as written except I added the yogurt to the wet ingredients, instead of at the end, and I used quick cook oats.  You may be tempted to add more chocolate chips but don't, otherwise you will end up with too many mix-ins and not enough dough to hold the cookies together.  These are a decadent treat.

Looved these cookies! Mine went flat though so that's why they got a 4/5. I used real butter (maybe that's my problem?) and only 1/2 cup of choc chips and no nuts. I'll be making hem again soon! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Added this to my list of Christmas cookies this year, just to try something new...and it was the favorite of many people! The mingled flavors of coconut and chocolate are excellent (I used sweetened coconut flakes and semi-sweet chips because it's what I had in the pantry), and the chunky texture given by the oatmeal makes for a hearty, dense, chewy cookie. I gave it four stars only because they were a little dry (but I used butter, not margarine)- but went down great with a glass of cold milk! Will definitely be making these again and again. I think next time I may add some almond pieces...mmmm....

Thanks for a wonderful, healthier ch chip, coconut cookie! These were pretty decadent for me, but I'm diabetic and don't do much real sugar baking. I made these changes; subbed some applesauce for some of the fat,used butter because that's what I had, added 1/2 tsp baking powder so they would be a little lighter, higher, used 1/2 cup Stevia in place of some of the sugar, used 2 cups ch chips and 1 cup coconut. These were great looking and tasting, kind of rustic and moist and chewy. Great flavor! Will be making again!

I made these last night and the entire household could not stop eating them. As many other reviewers, I used butter instead of spread. They did turn out an unusual texture, as they didn't stay together and kind of crumbled up as you picked them up. Nobody cared about the texture though, (they were so good that I think they'd have sucked them through a straw if they had to! haha). They were not dry at all, they were chewy, and very buttery tasting. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chips which worked perfect. They almost taste like toffee somehow. I usually like cookies undercooked and gooey, but these are better a bit crispy, as they did flatten for me, and almost reminded me of a chewy version of a "Lacey" cookie. Mmm, definitely a keeper in this house!

I used butter and omitted the almonds and the yogurt. Taste was awesome. Will definitely make these again and maybe try adding walnuts.

I have never rated anything before! I was a little afraid to make these; seemed all over the map as far as reviews went. THEY ARE AWESOME! For my son's girlfriend, I made them with MELT instead of butter, sunflower seeds instead of almonds, and a flax egg , all due to allergies. They are delicious! The person I actually made these for...will not know the difference :-). I too added one half teaspoon of baking powder. Thanks, these are great.

These turned out really good. I only used 1 cup lightly packed brown sugar, and substituted 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce for half of the margarine (which is what I used instead of the oil) they are so yummy. Will definitely be adding them to the regulars list.

These cookies were delicious.  I didn't give them a 5 star rating only because the dough wouldn't stick together when I was  putting them on the cookie sheets before baking.  Did anyone else have this problem?  I followed the recipe exactly as written.

These cookies are fabulous!  I swapped the chocolate chips for raisins, omitted the nuts and added a half teaspoon of baking powder as well.  They are wonderfully chewy, I love it!

This recipe is delicious!
n the second try, I made a double batch, but soaked the oatmeal in Bailey's for an hour prior to making this. I shared the batch with the volunteers at the horse rescue I manage; they were gone in a matter of a few hours!

This was my first time making cookies. The recipe was quick and easy to follow. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and pecans. I had to cook them a few minutes longer, but the turned out soft, fluffy and pleasantly crispy around the edges. Definitely adding this to my favorites.

Soft and delicious! Used actual butter because why not, and skipped the nuts/chocolate chips in favor of 2 cups of raisins (the only proper thing to put in an oatmeal cookie!). Made for a friend but I think this will join my regular cookie repertoire.

These are simply amazing! The combo of chocolate chips, coconut and oatmeal was delicious. I used real butter and so mine were flat. I also overcooked my last batch, thus flat and crispy. Gave some to the neighbors and they asked for another 2 doz! I would use a little less brown sugar next time as I found the a tad too sweet.

A coconut-oatmeal combo cookie never crosses my mind! I modified ingredients to include butter, less than a cup of oatmeal (because that's all I had in pantry), only 2 cups of coconut, instead of 1cup + 1/2 (instead of 2) , 2-eggs (instead of 1), a few teaspoons of vegetable oil, used less brown sugar and added honey w/ chopped pecans and a splash of cinnamon. They came out soft + yummy even the next morning for my hubsters to take to work for a mid-day snack!
