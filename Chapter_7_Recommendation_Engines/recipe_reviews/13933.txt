Great bean salad!  I added much more lime juice, more garlic, a bit more salt and reduced the oil.  Plus, I did equal amounts of corn and beans.  Also, to avoid "mushiness", I added the tomato and avacado very last, after mixing the dressing in with the other ingredients.  I gave it one last toss just before serving to coat the avacado and tomato.  Very good!

One of the best recipes on this site.  You MUST use fresh lime juice- not that icky stuff in a plastic lime- if you want great flavor.  I have made this recipe more times than I can count and there's always half a dozen people at any party who station themselves in front of it and just chow it down all night. Tonight I made it with a little twist- I added 8 oz. of bowtie pasta and doubled the dressing to compenstate.  It makes a great southwestern pasta salad!  Hit of the party.

This salad is so yummy and super versatile. It’s great by itself, or for a full dinner we like to grill some chicken breasts and throw it all on baked corn tortillas with lettuce for a tostada salad. The only changes to the actual salad we make are that we use finely diced purple onion instead of the green onion and add a bit more spice to the dressing. I’m not a cilantro fan by any means, but I think it’s vital to this salad. I just chop it very fine and use a little less. The only problem I have with this salad is that it doesn’t make the best leftovers. It’s tasty the next day, but the tang of the lime and the cilantro can’t survive the cold of the ‘fridge overnight and it loses it’s ‘zing.’ Definitely the best on the day it's made.

Good salad but too much oil as written.  Decreasiing oil to 1/4 cup still maintains the integrity of the dressing and makes for a healthier salad.  Helpful Hints:  Grill your corn instead of using frozen, add 1/2 tsp of cumin and please make sure you use FRESH lime juice not the concentrate.  Definitely improves the flavor.  Salad is best eaten the day it is prepared as the dressing tends to "break down" and lose it's zip over time.  Note:  Try serving this as a dip with tortilla chips ~ Wonderful!

This is great following the orig. ingredients.  Why do you folks rate a recipe if you havent made it per the instructions.  Try it first, write your review and then make it again with your changes.

We LOVED this salad!  I made this healthier by decreasing the olive oil to a quarter cup and increasing the fresh lime juice to a half cup, and the dressing was perfect.  Zippy!  I can't wait to dig into the leftovers (it makes tons!!).  I can see myself making this a lot.

This is very good!  For a lower fat alternative to the oil based dressing - replace all the oil with 3/4 cup tomato juice and add 1/4 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. oregano and half a seeded jalepeno, process until smooth.  Either way this is a simple and very delicious recipe.  I also add crushed baked tortilla chips.  Yum!

This salad was very popular at a pot luck dinner I went to last night and I had several requests for the recipe. I liked it too, but thought the taste of the cilantro overpowered the other flavors in the salad. I will make this again for my family but will reduce the cilantro to maybe 1/4 c. and increase the garlic. I also increased the amount of lime juice (to 1/2 c.) and reduced the olive oil (to 1/3 c.)... the olive oil could be reduced even more as other reviewers said.

This is pretty good, but look at the recipe for avocado salsa by Barbara Vinson. Add a can of beans and fresh cilantro to that one, chop it a little chunky, and you've got two very simmilar recipes. I've tried both, and I like the dressing on Barbara's better...just more flavor.

This is the best cold bean salad recipe ever!! I made it this weekend for a birthday party and got rave reviews. Everyone wanted the recipe. I used frozen white corn instead of yellow. I agree with other reviewers of this recipe....the cilantro is key....dont omit....the flavors are incredible. There was enough dressing, so it wasn't dry at all...and it was a very "fresh" tasting salad. Will make over and over....perfect bbq side dish!

Excellent!  I used about 1/3 cup of olive oil, increased slightly the lime juice and salt, added two crushed garlic cloves to the dressing, used three Roma tomatoes, two avocadoes and omitted the red pepper but will probably use next time. The suggestions about waiting until the last minute to add the tomato and avocado, and to leave the avocado pit in the salad until serving, were great and the salad turned out just wonderful. I served with baked lemon and garlic chicken and the meal got raves.

I just made this last night and it's awesome! I followed the recipe exactly. I tasted it immediately after  making it and thought it tasted too citrusy from the lime. But after refrigerating for an hour or 2 it had mellowed and was just fine. It is just as good the next day too, I just had some for lunch! A tip to keep the avacado from turning brown: save the pits and once the salad is all mixed up put the pits in the bowl with it. I do this with guacamole too and the avacados always stay green!

I thought the original recipe was okay, but feel that the cilantro, an acquired taste, was overpowering. However, I LOVED the dressing. I sauteed shrimp in it, then poured it over fresh spinach fettucine with grated grana padano cheese. Exquisite!

I have refined this a bit from my original review.
Now, I omit the tomatoes and use a combination of green & red bell peppers, for added crunch and color.  I make everything else the same. Leftovers keep longer this way.  It has become a family favorite!  Jen, you did GOOD, with this recipe!
"Great recipe!  For some unknown reason I happened to have cilantro-flavored olive oil, which I used. Regular olive oil would have been just as good. I did chill the salad overnight and added the tomatoes and avocado just before serving."

I love this- I do use frozen corn but find Trader Joe's roasted corn adds even more flavor if you have one in your area.  In a pinch used a green or orange bell pepper if I did not have a red.  I also believe the fresh cilantro is not an option but a must.

I'm not a cook by any means, so this was very easy and right up my alley. I made a few changes to it, though.
Add more lime juice, use less EVOO.
I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I used some kind of Cajun seasoning that worked well.
Instead of 2 cans of black beans, I would use just one next time.
I sliced the kernels off two ears of corn. My boyfriend said it tasted fresh and less salty than canned corn.
We had extra avocado, so we ended up using 1 1/2 instead of just one.
Use 1 package of cherry tomatoes (slice them in half) instead of 2 chopped tomatoes.
Add 1/2 package of feta.
Like I said, super easy and very good! It made good leftovers, too.

MMMMMMM!!!!!!  This is the best recipe from AllRecipes that I've cooked so far (and there have been a lot of great ones)!!!  My mom and I both give it a perfect ten.  It was fast, easy, and a lot healthier than most foods.  I used about 1/3 less olive oil than it said, used more green onions, put in some more cayenne, and added some cumin because I love cumin and one of the other reviewers said it tastes great like that.  Also, I thawed the corn out under the faucet first.  The only other change I'd make is next time, I'll put in more tomatoes because the tomatoes I used were pretty small!  Serve this salad wrapped in wheat flour tortillas, with oranges on the side, and you have a great dinner!

Loved this. Left out the avocado to avoid avocado moosh, and added chopped English cucumber to add some crunch.  In consideration of Hubs' sensitive innards, I also omitted the cayenne.  Can't imagine it would have made this any better anyway.

Everyone LOVED this salad!  I actually wanted more of an avocado salad, so I reduced the black beans to one can and increased the avocados to four.  Very refreshing at a summer BBQ.  Thanks

WOW!  My stomach is smiling!  It was over 32C (90F) here, and I made this early for our evening meal. Neither my daughter or I could wait that long to have a bowl, and it didn't disappoint us.
I used 3 ears of fresh corn (raw) and only half the oil as per other reviewers.  I couldn't find any cilantro today, but I will pick some up tomorrow for the leftovers- if there are any!
I have never reviewed a recipe before, but I just had to say something good here!

This is excellent, but I too made some adjustments.  I followed a previous users advice and made a dressing out of tomato juice, lime, garlic, jalapino (the whole pepper!), cyanne pepper, cumin, oregano and just a touch of olive oil to cut back on the bitterness.  When the salad was tossed with the dressing I added extra garlic powder, salt, pepper and some Tabasco - love the heat!  Wow, what good flavor (and healthy too!).

Okay, I totally improvised but used this recipe as a guideline. Winner! I cooked a pound of black beans from scratch. Yeah, that took a half day -- but it's just soaking and letting them cook properly while I'm doing other stuff so no biggie. When they were done, I rinsed them like canned beans and used them as the base of the salad. Didn't have some of the ingredients and never care for raw onions in anything anyway so I used a 15 oz. can of whole kernel corn (drained) and a 15 oz. can of Hunts diced, stewed tomatoes that already have bell pepper and garlic in them - also DRAINED. I had dried cilantro in my spice rack. Added somewhere between a tsp and a tbsp of that to the dressing recipe. Minced a clove of elephant garlic I grew last season. Ended up with about 1/4 cup of lime juice because I only had one good lime in the house. Didn't have an avocado or I would definitely have used that -- and fresh cilantro. My challenge though was to make a delicious, vegan dish that I can take to church tomorrow to share, without having to leave the house for a single ingredient simply because I didn't want to get dressed and go to the store. Delish! Indeed, it was good with the first 3 ingredients. Dressing just made it POP. Hoping the flavors meld overnight in the fridge and it's even better tomorrow!

I followed this recipe as far as the ingredients go, but kind of winged it with the measurements, as I was making it for a baby shower for 30 people. I made it about 6 hours ahead of time, and let it sit in the fridge. I got a little bowl shortly before I left (just to make sure it was ok), and I thought "meh...it's ok". I brought the salad along with about 100 pastelitos I'd made over the last couple of days. When I got to the party, I gave the salad a good mix, set everything out and went to mingle with the guests. About an hour or so into the party, I noticed that people were starting to eat. Shortly after that, I had my first compliment about the salad. After that, the flood gates opened and it literally became the talk of the party. I emailed the recipe to 3 people right there in the middle of the party. I thought that maybe I was missing something, because I didn't think it was THAT good (but I'm not the biggest fan of lemon/lime based dressings either). I made myself a little plate, and gave it another try. This time I thought it was SO good. I think mixing it once I got there along with a bit more time of letting the flavors merry did the trick. Either way, I'm a huge fan and plan on making some tomorrow to bring for lunch and as a side to dinner. Maybe next time I'll experiment with a bit of orange juice along with the lemon. Either way, it's healthy and tasty! Oh, one thing I didn't add is the cilantro. Not a fan...

Great summer salad. Add the avocado chunks just before serving and toss lightly with the salad/dressing.

This was good!  I used two avocados instead of one (and surprisingly, the avocados didn't turn all mushy the next day).

This is great!  I also added a little sugar, not enough to make it sweet, but just to take the tart out.  It is best made a day ahead, I think.  The flavors are too overwhelming when it is first put together.  Perfect with tacos or spanish rice!  Thanks so much.

I am nuts for nearly anything with black beans in it, so this recipe was a shoo-in. My 3-yr-old loves it, as does my very picky husband. The avocado does get a bit mooshed if you aren't careful about tossing, but doesn't brown at all because of the lime juice. And the cilantro is essential - ommitting it would really leave a hole in the flavor. All in all, a really addictive recipe. Drooling just thinking of the leftovers in my fridge! :)

Yummy and very versatile!  I brought it to a football party where fajitas were served for dinner. This was used for chip dip during the game, as a salad on the side with dinner, and as a topping for the fajitas! Yum! It makes tons though so next time I will probably make half.  Oh, I also used 1/2 cup fresh lime juice and only 1/4 cup olive oil as per other reviews.

I made this salad twice and it was a big success!  It is so flavorful and tastes even better the next day, so make it ahead of time.  The second time I made it I didnt use as much olive oil and it was still fine.  I would let this sit at room temperature before serving because the olive oil tends to solidify and looks a little funny.

VERY good!  I loved how all the flavors came together and it tasted so fresh and wonderful.  I only used one can of black beans (only had one) and it was good.  Would be good with more too.  Definitely don't skip the cilantro.  It really ties everything together.  I used grape tomatoes sliced in half, and fire-roasted frozen corn from Trader Joe's.  I used only 1/3 cup of olive oil.  Took this to a family campout with some organic blue corn tortilla chips on the side and it went over very well!  I mixed it up in the morning and we ate it that night, and it was very tasty and fresh still.

My sister Lori has been making this recipe for a while now.  It is a the most wonderful bean salad I have every had.  I like the combination of ingredients.  The crunchiness of the corn combined with the creaminess of the avocado is great and that little hint the lime juice gives it a great zing.  This is a great fresh tasting healthy salad!!

This is a wonderful recipe, and has become a staple dish in our house.  Like a few others, I also decreased the amount of olive oil and avocado to reduce the fat content, and increased the amount of garlic for an extra kick.

This is one of our family's favorites. It's great as written, but to suit our preferences we've modified it a bit over the years. We add a second avocado, a little cumin and a splash of red wine vinegar. And we reduce the oil a bit. This is great with tortilla chips, over grilled meats, or tossed with toasted cubed bread to make a panzanella. You really can't go wrong. Just leave the avocado to the very end if you want it to look pretty. It gets mushy. We don't care. It still rocks.

Wonderful flavor the first day!    All kinds of things you could do to make it your own.. like add some crumbled feta,  diced chicken  and/or diced jalapeno.   Add tomato & avocado right before serving to avoid mushiness!  Not as good the second day,  starts losing its pizzazz.

Great cold salad.  I added 1/2 tsp. each of cumin and oregano for more flavor.  Also skipped the cayenne and added 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes instead.  Cut back of the olive oil to 1/3 cup.  Fresh lime juice is a must!

I cut some down on this recipe since only four of us eating. I used one can of black beans, and one tomato. For the corn I used a 15 oz. can of sweet corn, but used the full amount of the rest of the ingredients. The dressing just wasn't flavorful enough for me, so I added a tablespoon of red wine vinegar and a teaspoon of cumin and few shakes of chili powder, and black pepper. I let the salad marinate without the avocados for a couple hours, adding in the avocados at serving time. I didn't need any salt since I added the extra spices. My husband and sons really raved about it.

Fresh, easy, healthy, and delicious! My spin on this recipe is to always use frozen white petite corn in order to add the bit of sweetness and crunch. I use the seasoned, canned black beans, thus eliminating the need for the called-for cumin. I up the garlic, add super finely diced red onion, small diced chunks of roma tomatoes sans pulp/seeds, omit the cayenne due to my 3 year-old's tastebuds, and either omit the oil altogether, or only use 1-2 Tbsp. Since I rarely buy fresh cilantro, I use the dried stuff (I know, gasp!), however, added directly to the dressing, it softens and the flavor really comes through. I generally don't add the avocado either, as I prefer them plain. I can literally make a meal of this, along with lime tortilla chips. Tasty flavor combination....thanks for the submission!

Excellent  salad!  My family ate it as a salsa with tostidos.  Just like  another reviewer, I too added more garlic.  I also added 3 plum tomatoes (chopped) 1 yellow and 1 red pepper  (chopped) for color, 1/2 red onion and 3 healthy scallions (just the whites If they are skinny, use 6 scallions.)  I  also used corn-on-the-cob (6 ears) that I cut fresh.  Three limes made 1/3 cup of juice.  I used 1/2 cup of evoo and 1/2 cup fresh chopped cilantro.This dish is more than excellent and I am not a lime lover.  Thank  you for this refreshing and great tasting recipe.

great salad! I used grape tomatoes and processed lightly. Also processed bell peppers and garlic to save time. Drained all the juicy things on paper towels and stored separately in the fridge to combine the next day. This saved alot of time on cooking day and the salad was not full of juice, only the sauce that was mixed in...family loved it.

I'm afraid my husband and I just did not like the taste at all.  I wasn't able to get a ripe avacado, but other than that, I thought I followed the recipe to a T.  Just personal taste I suppose.

This was awesome! I used mostly fresh lime juice(didn't get enough limes)and fresh cilantro (make sure it's finely chopped). We added a little apple cider vinegar to the leftovers so that it will keep better and to add a different flavor. This is definitely a keeper!! 

Edit: I've been making this as a salsa instead of a salad. I skip the olive oil completely now. I get a fresh tomato salsa from Sam's (it already has onion and cilantro) and then just add the other ingredients in. It saves SO much time. I use equal parts corn (frozen) and black beans. It is excellent on pretty much any mexican food.  I even find myself putting it on my Taco Bell tacos!

This is one of my favorite recipes ever.  My mouth waters everytime I think of it!  I double the lime juice, add a red onion instead of the green onion and use 2 cans of white corn instead of the frozen stuff.

THIS is IT! Sooo good, colorful and healthy. I spooned it atop spinach. I used all the ingredients except for green onions - used diced red onion. Cilantro is key and so is adding some cumin to the dressing and salad before serving. Add the avocados last so they don't get mushy. My house raved over this vegetarian dish!

This has become a weekly staple in our house this summer, it's so good! You can get away with a lot less olive oil and it still is fabulous. (I only use 2 tablespoons for the whole thing.)I also use a little less cilantro, since it can be overwhelming. It is wonderful wrapped in a tortilla with cold chicken the next day.

This was a very nice summer salad.  However I felt it needed to be dressed up a little so I put it on a bed of crisp dark lettuce leaves and sprinkled broken tortilla chips over the top.  I also cheated and purchased Louis Rich Santa Fe Grilled Chicken Breast slices (in deli case) and that was the perfect finishing touch.  I also took another person's advise and added a little sugar to the dressing so it wasn't so tart.  Very good and I'll make it again. Maybe next time with a crisp tortilla bowl like the ones in the restaurants....if I can find them.

This is so delicious! And healthy. I add extra cilantro, simply because I adore cilantro. Other than that, no changes to recipe were made.

I searched recipes for a dinner with my friend who was recently diagnosed with both Gluten and Dairy allergies, and is also on Weight Watchers.  I served it with the Chili-Lime Chicken kabobs, and they were fantastic together!  
My friend is not an adventurous eater, and told me that if she saw a bowl of this out at a party, she never would have even tried it.  But she took a tiny spoonful to taste it to be polite, and then was shoveling it by the spoonful!  She had corn tortilla chips that are Gluten Free, and they turned it into a fantastic appetizer before it was the dinner's side dish!
  If you do wind up making both the chicken and the salad, the leftovers from the 2 recipes are insanely wonderful in a tortilla wrap as a sandwich!!!
I will add a little more lime to mine next time, as I never get enough citrus! :)

Tastes fresh and summery.  Didn't use avocodos.  Finishes with a bit of heat.

My aim was to create a topping for my romaine lettuce and cubed grilled chicken to replicate the taste of chipotle's salad.  This copied it perfectly with the modifications as follows: I omitted the avocado as I didn't want the mushiness factor; instead of green onions, I used half a vidalia onion finely chopped; I used one finely drained and rinsed can each of sweet kernel corn and black beans.  I scooped out the seeds of the tomato before I chopped it.  I also added one finely chopped jalepeno (ribs and seeds removed) for a little bit of heat.  This made a lot and I will keep in my fridge for the next couple of days so that I can mix with my chicken and lettuce for a delicious, craveable salad.

This is FANTATIC!  I use less EVOO, add the avocado just before serving.  I make a big bowl on Sunday nights and then use as a salad much of the week.  Very versatile.  Have added grilled chicken, steak or shrimp to make it a main dish salad for lunch.  Cilantro is a MUST!

Exellent salad.  I couldn't stop eating it.  One reviewer said it didn't sit well overnight.  I think it still tasted great. I even used it as a dip for tortilla chips. My only recommendation is that you have to add the cilantro. I don't think it is an optional ingredient and together with the lime it makes a great combination.  I too added extra lime as suggested by another reviewer.

This was really good. My vegetarian friend loved it! We followed another user's recommendation to use half the olive oil and it was perfect that way. I also added a little extra corn like another person suggested. Also instead of using 6 green onions, we happened to have 7 in our bundle so we used all of them and it was fine. We also doubled the cayenne and still it was barely noticeable, next time we will probably add more.

I really like this salad, but now that I've made it a couple of times, I've modified it like other reviewers. My favorite way to prepare it is to reduce the oil to 1/4c (1/2c is just too much and a lot worse on the arteries), use an equal amount of corn & black beans (2c) and definitely keep the cilantro, but reduce it to 1/4c. I am not a huge fan of cilantro, but I think it's good in this recipe and 1/4c is just right.

This didn't work for us at all.  Way too much lime - it was overwhelming.  I'd scale it down to 1/4 cup, if even that.  Maybe more like 1/8 cup.  Also, I thought it was really strange to use frozen corn.  I'd recommend thawing it out first.  It just had a weird texture.  We ended up eating it with chips just so I wouldn't throw it away.

I give this 4 stars for how it is written, 5 for how I make it! :)  I don't really measure things, I just guess and taste.  I reduce the olive oil and whisk it with lime juice, garlic, salt, cayenne, and a bit of honey.  Instead of frozen corn, I cook 2 to 3 ears of fresh then cut it off the cob and throw it in a bowl along with one can of rinsed black beans, a red bell pepper (or yellow/orange, just whatever I have around), some red onion (instead of green), a good amount of cilantro and then an avocado or two.  I don't like the tomatoes in it, they get squishy!  The honey and corn really compliment each other and the cilantro gives it a great fresh taste.  It's even better the next day (with the honey - without it, you should eat it the day you make it), just make sure you press some plastic wrap down right ontop of the salad to keep the avocado from turning brown. My husband and I LOVE this salad - we make it every couple of weeks!

My son, Matthew (14), made this as part of a Health class project. he says: it gives you a "chillaxin'" feeling after a hot meal. He wanted to give this recipe 5 stars, but I would have probably given it 3, so we compromised. I have made and had much better black bean and corn salad. Heather's Black Bean and Corn Salsa from this site has much more flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

This salad was delicious!  I brought it to a party and served it with Tostitos scoops corn chips.  I know the recipe says that the cilantro is optional, but in my opinion, it is essential.  It was still delicious the next day, but I cannot say what it tastes like on the third day because there was none left!

This salad is great.  I mix equal amounts of all of the vegetables listed here (sometimes substituting grape tomatoes that are cut diagonally in half - prettier and less mushy)plus chopped carrot, cucumber, red onion instead of green.  This mixture tastes great in warm tortillas (especially the sprouted grain ones.  It's also good without the beans, as a vegetable salad with fresh cilantro.  Sometimes I mix this with some cooked and cooled quinoa.  This is so versatile, yummy, satisfying, and a great way to eat lots of veggies.  Thanks!!

This recipe is awesome.  I am asked to bring it to every potluck I attend.  I agree with one of the reviews, though, to soak the avocado in the lime dressing beforehand.  It keeps the avocado from browning and adds a little pop to it.

Very good recipe. After I mixed everything together I tasted it before serving, and decided to add about 4 tablespoons of white vinegar and about 1 tsp of Adobo seasoning to bring the flavors out more. If I made this again, I'd double the avocado and add it just before serving. I'd also add a finely chopped jalepeno pepper, since it wasn't very spicy at all (I'm a wuss about spicy food but I would have liked just a little more). We had it with Oaxaca cheese quesadillas. Very good!

I have been making this recipe for almost 2 years and LOVE it! Just shared it again with someone new...everyone seems to enjoy it. We use it as a salsa with blue corn chips.  I skip the avocados and add a few shots of Tabasco sauce into the dressing.  In a pinch, lemon juice works instead of the lime juice.  My 14 year old son devours this as an after school snack!

Excellent!  I mixed 1/2 cup of oil with the 1/3 fresh lime juice and that was PERFECT.  To keep the salad looking fresh and not "mushed," toss only once (and gently) after you add the viniagrette.  Don't forget the cayenne (as I did) because it really needed that kick.  Add extra corn to equal the beans; I think it needs that balance.  The lime viniagrette is SO refreshing and just the right taste for a summer salad!  A single batch will serve WAY more than 6. A big hit and I will serve again!  Thanks.

This salad was a huge hit at a 4th of July picnic we went to!  I added some small shell pasta to it and the compliments were flying!  Definately a keeper!

Reading 6 green onions – in my mind registered 6 ‘bunches'. Made 50 servings for 25th anniversary. Prepared layers days ahead, put all together hrs. before serving. Started onions, thinking bunches purchased 20 bunches (8 onions /bunch) Some added red onion, cutting red onion easier than green onions. ½ through green onion cutting–REALISED 6 GREEN ONIONS–not 6 bunches! 80 green onions were a little more needed plus red & white onion added. Assembling layers, next-cut up peppers. Mild chili red peppers more cost effective red sweet peppers (@$1.89 each vs. $1.99 lb. chili) used 1 red sweet pepper, lb. mild red chili peppers, + couple green peppers. Next made dressing. Initially got bag of limes. Realizing needed more, purchased several individual limes. Individual limes juiced easily. Bagged limes pain juicing. Lesson learned - higher quality limes difference was pennies, labor juicing – BIG DIFFERENCE. Now I’ll buy limes individually  Purchase garlic bulk cloves then freeze. Pureed frozen garlic w/ lime juice & cayenne. Many reviewers 2x lime juice & dramatically reduced oil. So did I. Recipe 50 servings = 4 cups oil I used 1 cup. Cilantro, tomatoes & avocado last, day serving put all together. I’ll include recipe in thank you cards. Modest amount left over, many stated this does not store well, they were certainly not as wonderful as initial serving – but a great left over. This was a huge hit.

I followed the recipe and had great results. The oil amount seemed fine to my crowed. All the fresh ingredients make this salad delicious, so don't cheat; use fresh squeezed limes.

Mmm, good!  I cut this in half and it still made four plus servings.  Great flavors, but other reviewers are correct in that it does not save well.  It becomes mushy, so only make enough for your meal.  I will make this again, thanks!  Great for a crowd.

This was very good! I left out the tomatoes and avocado since we were having carnitas was pico de gallo and guac anyways. The salad still tasted great! I think I will stick with red onions next time though, instead of green onions...I threw a little of the pico de gallo in with it and it tasted perfect, so I think the real onions would be better. I also added a little 1 tsp cumin, and 3 more garlic cloves.  It definitely needs the cilantro too! Will make again!

It's actually a bit hard to rate this accurately considering it seems to be impossible to buy black beans in most Australian supermarkets! So I used a mixture of other beans and thought the dressing was fantastic. Hopefully I can get some black beans sometime!

This was really delicious!  I did make a few changes according to what I had on hand.  I used lemon juice instead of lime, canned corn instead of frozen and omitted the green onions and cayenne because I didn't have any.  I also used two avocados instead of one, I should have just stuck with one though.  The avocados made the salad look creamy and so it didn't look as fresh and colorful as it could have.  Next time I will just serve avocados on the side.  Also I will only make half the dressing because the salad was just swimming in it and I even reduced the oil to 1/3 cup.  Even without the changes though this was a delicious recipe.  Thank you! :)

I made this tonight it is one of the best bean salads I've had.  I didn't have the cilantro or bell pepper so I to leave those out.  Even without those two it was great and everyone raved about it.  Other than omitting the two items, the recipe was followed as it says.  The texture and array of flavors puts this at the top of my list.  The next time I make this I'll make sure I have all ingredients.

Delicious and beautiful salad. Love, love, love the bright flavors. Only (tiny) changes I made were to cut the olive oil way down and to use garlic powder instead of fresh garlic because we don't care for raw garlic. Super yummy. I will make again. Thanks :)

Loved this recipe!  To amp up the flavor because I was in the mood for Mexican, I only used one can of beans, no tomatoes (didn't have any) and added extra lime juice, chives, tons of cumin, and chili powder instead of cayenne since that's what I had on hand.  Will make again!!!  Thank you!

This is an excellent salad, winter, summer or fall. I guess spring will work too. :) The only thing I really changed was I added different beans. I am getting my daughter into cooking and she chose3 types. (turns out, have fun). This was excellent.

it was amost a salsa too watery to be a salad, either way the flavor was good.  If I was to make this again, it would include jalapenos and be served as a dip.

I've made this recipe multiple times since I first found the recipe years ago, but only used the avocado for the first time last night.  Delicious!  We serve it with Chili Lime Chicken Kabobs and cooked rice.

great! went with suggestion to add more lime juice (3 fresh limes) in lieu of extra olive oil.  Also did not have green onion and substituted 1/2 of a red onion.  I also used "mexicorn" and "chipotle" corn from green gial for extra kick, and a pack of Sazon.  did not have cayenne, used crushed red pepper.  Came out great!!!

Really good. I followed the dressing recipe exactly, except for the seasonings. I added more cayenne (1/4 instead of 1/8th and added a tsp of Tabasco as well. You can really throw "whatever you have" along the same theme as the original recipe - we followed pretty closely, but minus the corn and I used dried beans instead of canned. Really good! Thanks!

As with others I inverted the quantity of lime juice and olive oil to 1/2 cup lime & 1/3 cup oil. As an added twist I also replaced the avocado with about 1-1/2 lbs blanched asparagus. Simply blanch the asparagus for about 4 minutes and chill in ice water to stop cooking. You want it nice and firm. Once chilled, cut it into about 1" lengths. Probably best to mix together all the other ingredients and then fold in the asparagus at the end. Overall this recipe makes for an extremely fresh and delightful summer dish.

Even my 9-year-old old niece adores this and asks for seconds.  She cracked me up by bringing the tortilla chips to the table and scooping it up.  Great flavor and I always get asked for the recipe.

I agree with others: use more lime juice and more of your favorite seasonings (garlic, cayenne, and/or green onions), and less olive oil.  But, just as written, delicious and so healthy.

I was craving something fresh.  this was delicious.  Enough for 6 adults and a few kids. Next time I'll use more avacado and less corn. didn't use cilantro but I bet it would be good.

we had this with our enchiladas.  It was really good and fresh!  The only thing i did differently was I left out the red bell pepper and I only used 1 can of black beans.

Huge hit with friends!  Tastes awesome. I did take garlic and chop super fine and salted and let sit for about 10 minutes...then smash and make like paste and put in the olive oil/lime juice.  Let marinade as long as possible before mixing in with beans and tomatoes and the flavor of the garlic really comes out.  YUM YUM!! I also deseeded tomatoes for less juice.  I did use cilantro (whole bunch from store) and love it!

One word...YUMMY! Only thing I added was 2 tsp of balsamic vinegar. Did not have fresh limes so I used the stuff in the bottle. All including a 5 year old and a 14 year old liked it. Only my picky 8 year old would not eat it.  We had this with soft tacos and my 5 year old even put some on her taco.

Excellent tasting bean salad.  The lime juice livens things up and makes it taste so fresh.  Will keep in fridge for a few days.

I thought the amount of olive oil was too much. I then used half the amount called for, also no cilantro (I don't care for it) and no red pepper.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and got many compliments, even from an ex-husband who said he didn't like it but ate quite a lot of it.  I will make this again. Thank you for this recipe!

I was trying to incorporate more beans into our diet, so went looking for recipes like this one.  Delicious!  Very fresh taste.  If you plan to have left overs, save some of the dressing and dress the salad just before you eat, as the lime zing does diminish even just overnight, and add the avocados just before eating, too.  We loved this salad.

This was so colorful and we loved the ingredients. The dressing was very good, but a little "biting"/wangy (is that a word? :). Will definitely make again but maybe add a few more ingredients (pinch of sugar,vinegar, etc.)to the dressing.

Just okay but probably my fault...the avocados were a little firm, and the tomatoes kinda tasteless. Great idea but not many guests tried it, and nobody went back for seconds.

Make this YOUR way, and it will be equally delish! So much goes into how a recipe tastes..do you like cilantro?  How much?  Garlic?  Again, how much?  And are your taste buds normal, or are they diminished by nasal congestion issues, or age, or whatever (because taste and smell are closely related? All of this affects how you taste food. Just add more of what you like if this is the case).  This said, I have to say, I've made this recipe exactly as it is written for many people, and I've never had anything but raves.

Very, very yummy. I halved the salad portion of this recipe and still needed lots more dressing than it called for.  I'd suggest halving the recipe & doubling or tripling the dressing.  Also, a half recipe made 6 servings of salad so the original would make about 10-12, not 4-6 as stated. Ps. 1 lime equalled about 1/3 cup lime juice and I also added cumin to the dressing as I was serving it with cucumber soup & a southwest pasta dish.

This is a very good salad, almost more like a salsa than a salad.  I made this early in the day so the flavors would be at their peak at dinner-time.  Scaled this recipe in half, used fire-roasted frozen corn from Trader Joes increasing that to 1c, added the juice of an extra lime, and a diced fresh mango for a taste of sweetness that I normally enjoy with a black bean salsa.  Served alongside grilled chicken and nacho chips.  Many thanks to reviewer, JodiA, for the tip on leaving the avocado pit in the salad to prevent the avocado from turning brown; we had leftovers and your tip worked like a charm!  Thanks for the recipe, Jen!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I madeit to bring with me camping and it was a hit. The flavors meld even more as it sits; however, the avacodo gets very soft. My friends really enjoyed this recipe! I did make one change, I added about 1/2 tsp of cumin to the lime dressing to jazz it up a little.

Good stuff.  I don't like avocado so I did leave that out, but it sounds like people had issues with it anyway.  It was a bit spicy and I had to have a beverage at hand, but great stuff and I like having things I can take places w/out hunting down a microwave.  Only thing that bugs me is all that oil, so I might try cutting back on it and see how that turns out.  EDIT:  I've tried this now with about 3/4 the oil and it's still really good.  Also, I made this very close to another black bean salad, which I had given 5 stars to, and just realized this is so much better - bit more complexity of flavors in the dressing.  (The other tastes mostly like cumin.)

This is great.  I make it all the time.  The only change I ever make is to use juice from a Meyer lemon as part of the lime juice, so it is a bit sweeter.  I've added papaya as well.  But this recipe on its own is great

I love black bean and corn salad and this was the best I've ever had!  I had some leftover boiled corn on the cob and used that.  I'm sure it would still be good with frozen corn, but the fresh was really delicious!  I think the dressing is what makes this salad special.

This is so great! I've made it several times now and each time I'm pleased.  I used lemon juice instead of lime juice.  Also, the first few times, I was disapointed that the avacados turned brown, so this last time I soaked them in a little fresh lemon juice first and they were green as long as the salad lasted!  It also added more of a citrus flavor, which I love.  Thanks!

My mom loved it...my husband did not -- and he likes everthing.  He left most of it on his plate--this is not like him.  I liked it, but was not looking forward to eating the leftovers.  Can't put my finger on what was missing...maybe if I make it again I'd add a small amount of sugar to take away that extra tartness (like another reviewer did and recommended).

Jen, love the recipe!  As others have suggested, I added the avacado right before serving so it could hold up a little better.  (should do the same with tomato, but I omitted it b/c of the color of the bell pepper.)  Also, we have local corn right now and nothing beats it!!  I made the dice for the pepper the same size as the corn, and substituted red onion, very small dice, for the green onion...a little sweeter and adds a surprise crunchy texture.  Thanks again-

What a great recipe! What is great about it (besides the taste :) is that it can be eaten immediately. Sometimes it is inconvenient to have side-dish salads that have to sit overnight or for a few hours for the flavors to meld. This one is fantastic the minute you finish it AND it tastes exactly the same the next day! I forgot to buy a red pepper so I made it without it, and I omitted the salt. Also - this is good to know if you are trying to cut down on the fat and calories - I only used 1/4 cup of the olive oil. Now, I haven't made it with the full 1/2 cup so I can't compare it, but I think it was great with just the 1/4 cup, so give it a shot! I served it with homemade burritos (whole wheat wrap, ground turkey, red beans in sauce) and it was a super healthy, high-fiber meal. Thanks a bunch!!

This is an excellent salad that keeps well for a couple days. You can add extra zip by finely chopping a jalapeno pepper and adding to the dressing.  I was recently add a party where a dip was served with the same ingredients, except the dressing was mayo and cumin. Everyone loved that one too.  Cheers!

This salad makes a colorful side dish or a light, delicious lunch by itself.  I use half the amount of olive oil called for in a recipe because I like more veggies and less dressing.  It doesn't keep that well in the fridge, but it will probably be gone fast anyway.  Lots of chopping, but very easy.

I have made this recipe several times, and occasionally throw in cubed cheese.  It's delicious. When I serve it, there's usually just silence as people gobble it down as quickly as they can - I kid you not.  A fabulous find!

I never measure anything... so who knows if I put in the amount mentioned? I used frozen roasted sweet corn from Trader Joes (the BEST corn! YUM!), only one can of organic black beans (all I had!) and a bunch of cherry tomatos to use up before they went south. I just tasted this before putting it in the fridge to "meld" and OH MY GOSH! It's DELICIOUS!! I did add a little extra cayenne, I think.. we like things spicy around here. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!!

GREAT! Put it into homemade masa corn tortillas. Made it for 4 servings, so I only used 1-15 oz. can bl beans, but increased the following: 2 medium tomatoes, whole avocado, 2 limes juiced (also zested them first with peeler and chopped finely into mixture YUM:) According to MY big-garlic taste I used 6 cloves instead of less than one! No salt needed, very tasty, very, very refreshing. We had fresh raspberries on the side, perfect dessert, with a single pinch of sugar flicked over each bowl of berries. What a meal for less than $9.81 for both of us! (Our 2nd helping tomorrow would be 4.81 for just the salad). Just have to make this soon after shopping to make sure you use the avocado, cilantro, bell pepper, green onions, and limes quickly while still fresh.

I picked this out two weeks ago and have already made it twice! Easy and everybody LOVES it - had taco night just so I could make the salad! Used fresh corn blanched in boiling water for about 1 min. then cut off the cob - make sure and use the cilantro, it makes the salad.  Thanks!

I get rave reviews every time I bring this dish to a gathering, and am asked to share the recipe without fail!  Just looking at it makes your mouth water.  The lime, cilantro and red pepper give it such a fresh taste.  It's an excellent recipe for the warmer months, but I make it year round to remind me of the fresh taste of summer.  I leave out the tomatoes, and put in an extra avocado. It's nice to have someone help cut up all the ingredients, once that's done, it's a snap throwing it all together.  It's not really 4-6 servings.  More like 10 servings.

This is a delicious summer side dish.  I took the advice of others and switched the oil and lime juice proportions.  I also added a peeled cubed cucumber, black pepper, 1/2 C more corn (frozen white)and a second avocado.  It was a hit at a party last weekend and I made it again tonight to rave reviews.  It is also great eaten with blue corn chips.

First time I made this, I forgot to drain the black beans.  It was good but alittle soupy.  It reminded me of a salsa more than a salad, but really good.  I made it again recently and drained the beans --- much more like a salad.  Loved it!  I definitely recommend this recipe.

This is by far the best recipe out there for black bean salad.  I halved the amount of oil and I didn't miss a thing on flavor.  Sometimes I make it without the avocado too.  I shared the recipe with my Mom who said every time you take a bite you are in heaven!!

This is a great salad.  However I found that it needed a little extra zip so I substituted balsamic vinagrette dressing for the olive oil.  Also, I doubled the amount of cayanne and garlic.  Everyone loved this dish!

This recipe is time consuming but deliciuous.  Allow for some prep time.  The dish is absolutely beautiful when completed and can be served in taco shells, on chips as dip or as a side salad, the possibilities are endless.  The recipes makes a lot...it lasted my husband and I three days, munching on it constantly. Enjoy, great dish for get togethers!

Delicious. I omitted the cilantro simply because I didn't have any, and added some shredded lettuce. I also cut the olive oil to a couple tablespoons. Next time I'd like to try adding some chicken. Yum! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was great!  The various textures really made this salad refreshing.  The softness of the beans, tomatoes and avocadoes balanced well with the crunch of the pepper, onion and corn.  The dressing coupled with the cilantro gave it a very nice zing.  This is a great recipe for the summer months when corn is in season.  I used fresh corn that I blanched and then cut off the ear and it worked great.

There are two things my 8 year old son loves.. (1) What he calls "mom's famous chicken soup" and (2) Black Bean And Corn Salad II.  I have had at least 8 people so far ask for the recipe for this dish!  It's simply the best.  I rate it 5 stars for everything but for "quickness" I gave a 3 as I find it takes some time to cut up all the veggies and prepare the beans, but it's not too hard if you have help.  I usually use dried black beans (soaked overnight) instead of the canned, as it's much cheaper.  Make sure you use freshly squeezed limes for the best taste!   Also try adding cubed chicken if you want meat for the meal.

I made it exactly as written and it was extremely bland. It made no sense to me, because all of the things that went in it are delicious. But here's the deal; The olive oil pretty much cuts the lime taste completely. I would recommend either omitting it completely or severely decreasing the amount. It also needs more spices, so crank up that cayenne (if you have a taste for spicy) and maybe add some cumin & garlic powder. Also, frozen corn is weird and gives a bad texture. I would recommend canned or even fresh. I gave this two stars because it's a really good concept, it just needs some work to give it flavor.

Great recipe! I love how colorful it is. Taste is great - the lime juice and cilantro are zingy & fresh and nicely balanced with the creaminess of the avocado. Agree with others about decreasing amount of olive oil. I am making this my go-to recipe for any potluck or gathering.

Love this! It deserves a name with more flair! Very versatile.  Good as a stand alone salad, on tortilla chips, or as a taco topper. For lunch, a tasty side is cheddar jalapeno toast. I was concerned about the avocado turning brown in the fridge so I left that out and just added it to each portion as I ate it. It lasted several days in the fridge that way. I also tossed in a diced serrano pepper for a little heat and cut down on the olive oil a bit. I found that two limes gave just the right amount of juice. I tossed in some diced peach with the leftovers one day and that was a good variation too.

Followed instructions exactly as written. I thought the cilantro was a little over powering. But otherwise, a great recipe. Very similar taste to spicy bean salsa recipe which is delicious!!

Positively ambrosial! We can't get enough of this fresh, flavorful salad--it's that good. Perfect alongside BBQ, grilled or roasted meats, or sandwiches. Also tastes great whether dressing is added in advance or just before serving. (You might try cutting the olive oil in half. Saves calories, and you can't tell the difference.)

awesomely delicious and easy to make side dish that goes well with spicy dishes  or by its self. I used less oil and more lime juice to make it a healthier choice. :)

Very good.  I used the recipe here for the dressing on half of the salad, and used a balsamic vinegrette that I had made for another salad on the other half.  We actually preferred the balsamic, but both were VERY good.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this recipe. I hold the cayenne pepper and add a large diced jalapeno pepper to the salad. It's delicious. I could make a meal of just this.

This is a really excellent salad.  I made it for a party for New Years and made it again for my family this week.  The pinch of cayenne really makes the salad!
Thanks!

I made this for a potluck and everyone loved it!  I did add a couple diced fresh jalapeños and a little chili powder to the dressing, which added a little bite, but not too much.  I'll make this again, for sure!

Excellent.  I took to a tailgate and it got rave reviews.  Because I set it next to the tortilla chips, some thought it was a salsa...still loved.

This was ok but not that impressive of a dish. I brought this to a potluck recently given the positive reviews and it barely was touched. Compared to all the other home-cooked "comfort" foods, this really wasn't that appealing. Didn't taste bad, just wasn't awesome either.

Pretty good. Next time will try with red onion and halve the amount of onion. Also, I would use real limes and mix it with some lemon, and serve it over rice. I added a little hot sauce to mine because I like that vinegar taste, and this came out pretty good.

WOW! I was practically shoveling this stuff into my mouth; I couldn't get enough! I love all the flavors in this salad and I made the recipe almost exactly as written.  The only change I made was to use red onion rather than green (all I had on hand) and add 1 tsp. ground cumin to the dressing mix.  Absolutely delicious summer salad with readily available ingredients.  Thanks for this recipe, I'll be using it often!

SO good! I made this all last summer and can't wait to make it again when the veggies are in season. Basically, the "dressing" is so versatile, you can switch up the veggies to what you have in the house. I used equal parts lime and evoo for a tangier dressing.

I loved this!  I was afraid the lime juice would be overpowering, but it was not at all. I omitted the tomatoes and used crushed red pepper flakes instead of cayenne, but otherwise made it just like the recipe.  I think you could add cooked rice as an addition to make it a little more filling, and serve as a main dish, topped with chicken, shrimp or pork.  I also think it would be tasty as a dip, served with tortilla chips.  I will DEFINITELY make this again!

Made this for a picnic, and it seemed to be well-received. I did add some cumin, and used the amounts more as guidelines, but I really enjoyed this. It was good as a burrito filling too.

I love this salad!  It is the best of this type that I've had, especially with my adjustments ;-)  I just think the salad doesn't need so much olive oil, and I only put in 2 T.  I also use New Mexico red chile powder instead of cayenne since I live in NM and it's great.  Another minor change I made is to use Trader Joe's frozen roasted corn instead of just regular because it gives a really delicious flavor to the salad.  I like making a big batch and having it for lunch during the week; the flavors meld even better with time, and I would never leave out the cilantro!

The flavors are pretty good (not exciting), use 1/2 the olive oil called for otherwise its far too "watery".

Made this exactly as written (oh - except I did use bottled lime juice - bet it's even better with fresh) and took it to a 4th of July cookout and boy was it a huge hit! I heard later that there was a big discussion among my daughter's friends as to the best way to eat it - with a fork like a salad or scooped up on tortilla chips. Everyone wanted the recipe. Thanks for sharing - I think this might be my go-to recipe for summer time potlucks from here on out.

Just made this tonight and it was quite tasty!  The lime really brightens the flavors.  I didn't have the red bell pepper, but I didn't think it would have made much difference.  Thanks for sharing this festive salad, Jen!

This is a really fantastic and refreshing recipe. I didn't follow the amounts exactly, though. I only had one can of black beans and I poured in corn until the ratio looked about right, then added two tomatoes, two avocados, and a handful of chopped cilantro. I did not add green onions, as I prefer it without. For the dressing, I used closer to 1/4 cup olive oil and just squeezed in three limes, added a scoop of minced garlic, some coarse sea salt, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. As it often happens with salads like this, it tasted even better the next day!

I added some garlic powder, black pepper and cumin.  Also used a jalapeno instead of bell pepper, next time will probably use a green chile.  I ate way too much with crackers for lunch!!

This has so many reviews but I'll add mine anyway.  I tripled the recipe and served it to 60 people along with tacos and refried beans.  The bowl was empty in a few minutes. Everyone raved about the salad.  They put it on the tacos and used it as a dip with tortilla chips.  I've made it 2 times since then and always get asked for the recipe.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is one of my favorite salads. I always double the dressing and use half for the salad and half if it needs it later. I used cherry tomatoes and shake out the seeds so the salad doesn't get too watery. I also add extra corn..delicious!

I make this for parties and ALWAYS get rave reviews.  I chop up the tomatoes and peppers pretty small and serve it with tortilla chips. I NEVER have leftovers!!  The lime dressing makes it.  A must try!!!

This is a yummy bean and corn salad, but I still prefer the Mexican Bean Salad from this site. I thought this recipe called for way too much oil; I used 1/4 cup, and was very glad I did. 1/2 a cup is way too much, and most of it would end up being thrown out, as this salad is very juicy! I loved the strong lime flavor in this salad, and the sweetness from the corn. Since I didn't have any green onions, I used fresh chives instead. Thanks for sharing; this is a tasty salad!

This was awesome.  The taste of the fresh lime really came through the next day.  I made it lower in fat by halving the the olive oil.  Great low fat protein.  Thanks

This salad is delicious.  The second time I made it I cut the olive oil in half, added extra cilantro and it was even better!  Getting good quality avocados makes a good difference (Costco has good ones). Perfect for the summer!

really good! I made some revisions for my own personal tastes however:
I doubled the avocado--the 1 avocado just got lost with all the beans. I also halved the tomato and red pepper, just because Im not wild about those flavors, which is no reflection of the recipe itself. 
 this recipe was super fast to make, healthy, and was a big hit at my party.

Fixed this many times this summer, my DH asks me to fix it more and my relatives all ask for the recipe!  I use my own corn that I froze, and everything else the same, maybe alittle more cayenne, We love the kick!  It's awesome just like it is, love it!

Great dish, rave reviews from kids and adults alike. I did make some adjustments based on previous reviews -- for the vinaigrette: 1/2 cup of lime juice and 1/3 cup of olive oil (instead of the opposite), added a bit of honey and 1/4 tsp. of caynne (instead of 1/8); for the salad: added chickpeas, omitted the tomatoes, and used corn cut off the cob instead of frozen. Really delicious!!

I didn't have green onion so I diced thinly a little vadalia onion instead. This salad was a HIT! I've given the recipe to 3 people who tried it when I made it. Dad and I ate the rest up. Delicious. I'm not much of a cook so these simple items are great for me. Easy.

This recipe was ok.  It has potential to be really good but I thought the lime and olive oil taste were very overpowering.  The yummy veggies and beans could hardly be tasted.  Next time I will reduce both liquids, add some sugar, a little more cayenne, and omit the garlic.  I also thought this salad turned out more like a salsa.  Thanks to the other reviewer that suggested adding the avocado pit to the salad.  It worked!

I felt the dressing lacked a little bit of flavor. I ended up adding more lime juice to make it tangier.  I also think the bean-to-corn ratio was too high, but that's my personal preference.  I'd rather have an even amount of corn and bean, if anything more corn than bean.  This recipe is also HUGE.  Definitely not simply 6 servings for a salad which is a side dish.

This is absolutley GREAT, don't hesitate to make it, if you make it in advance, be sure to leave the avacado pit in the salad, it helps to keep it from browning and keeps it fresh.

This is good - wonderfully refreshing.  Don't get super ripe avocados as those will be hard to cut up. 
Add some spinach and some seared tuna and you've got a full meal.

To save time and add flavor make with out the avocado up to a day ahead. Than just before serving stir in the avacado.

I omitted the tomatoes, decreased the cilantro, copied LadyJayPee & added cubed mango (great idea!) & also added a couple of tbp of sugar to tone down the tartness/bitterness of the lime. It wsa good but I thought it still needed something in the dressing. Next time, I may try adding just a tad bit of rice wine vinegar (has a very subtle vinegary flavor) for part of the lime juice. Thanks for the recipe,  Jen!

This was quite a nice salad with some changes, I loved the lime dressing, but I am somewhat confused. I don't see how it needs a whole (raw) onion per serving, especially with the garlic in there. I cut it down by a quarter and I was still picking it out towards the end. Looking at others' submitted photos I don't see so much onion in there, so I'm not sure what's going on with that. Some other ratios seem to be a bit off for me, but that may just be personal taste. I also made the mistake of preparing this as a meal on its own for a light lunch. I think it would be much nicer as a side salad or at least served on leaves. And finally, I agree with other reviewers in that it should sit in the fridge for a while before serving. Next time I'll know better.

I used this as a basis for what turned out to be super yummy!  I didn't have some things, so I used beans, corn, cukes and grape tomatoes.  The dressing didn't have enough kick for us, so I added some white wine vinegar and a tiny bit of sugar and it was great.  We tosed this on a bed of spring greens and topped it with herb-crusted seared yellowfin tuna.  It was SO GOOD!

This is very tasty, but I think you need to let the dressing sit on the salad for a couple of hours before you serve it.  When I made it, I immediately grabbed a big bowl for myself.  My first impression was that it had a very raw flavor to it.  The spices had not yet blended together.  Next time, I will thoroughly thaw the corn and add cumin.  There was definitely something missing to the salad...a little more salt, some cumin, red pepper flakes, more garlic???  Anyhow, it tasted A LOT better once it sat for a couple of hours.  Not as raw...still something missing, but not the uncooked flavor.  I might make it again.

This was very good. I made a few adjustments such as I used a green pepper as the red ones were fairly expensive. I tripled the cayenne as the friends I served this to love it hot as do I.  I used 5 garlic cloves because we're garlic freaks and I think it made it better but go with your party tastes.  I also used extra green onions.  I made it the night before the dinner so the flavors could meld.  This recipe worked great for the BBQ.

I have renamed this 'Texas Taboulla'(or Southwest depending where your from). If you have ever made taboulla the dressing resembles it as well as the flavor.  Made it without cilantro only because cilantro can overwhelm. I crushed the 'large' clove of garlic and added 1 tsp cayenne. More flavor and couldn't stop eating it!! Delicious

I really enjoyed this.  It was great as a salad, but served it with fajitas, and it was great as a topping!  Would also be wonderful as a dip with tortilla chips.  I scaled this down to 3 servings, but it still made a ton.

First time making---
 I made it as is without the cilantro.  I also used grape tomatoes instead of chopping a tomato.  I did find that it was not as spicy as I had hoped, but the dressing is very good.  I will finish reading all the reviews for suggestions on how to spice it up.  I'm thinking of adding a jalapeno and cumin.  I also like the idea of adding bowtie pasta to it. Mine looked much different than the submitted photo because it had, get this, black beans in it :)  My only real complaint is that the recipe calls for frozen corn and leaves out the cooking the corn part in the directions.

-------
This is the 2nd time I made this recipe.  Last week it didn't dawn on me to use frozen corn on PURPOSE.  I thought it was a mistake.  I added frozen corn this time and loved it.  I also decreased the olive oil to 1/4 and increased the fresh  lime juice to half a cup.  I doubled the cayenne and I also used the cilantro this time.  I'm not a huge fan of cilantro, but it is good.  I'll probably add a smaller amount next time.  I also used red and green peppers because I had a green pepper to use before it went bad.  

I like the versatality of this recipe.  My husband and I used this tonight as a quick dinner solution.  We can stand in the kitchen and talk while we chop and there is no need to turn on the oven, which is a plus when it's 103 outside.

SO good!  I've made it twice in the last week already, with and without the cilantro, and everyone loves it both ways. I use about a teaspoon of garlic powder in the dressing along with more cayenne pepper than called for, and a bit of kosher salt to balance the flavors instead of 2 chopped garlic cloves.None of us like to bite into even a small piece of raw garlic. :^) 
This recipe is definitely a keeper, it is tasty, healthy and a good way to get your veggies.

YUM! This was SO good!!! I made a couple changes. I used pinto beans instead of black beans because I don't care for black beans much and I used lemon juice instead of lime because that's what I had on hand. It turned out great! 

It's SO filling!! We put ours on flour tortillas with a little shredded colby-jack cheese. I could only eat one and my hubby that can REALLY eat could only eat two...and this is coming from meat eaters!! 

The only thing I would recommend is that this really does need to sit for a few hours before serving for the flavors to meld. I tasted it right after I made it, then again when we ate it at dinner. It was much better a few hours later at dinner. 

This would also be an awesome salsa type dip!! Just chop the tomatoes & avocados small. A definite must try!!!

This was really good but if you are not madly,  head over heels about cilantro I would not use the whole amount. I only used about 1/8 c. and it was enough for my family.

Very good - perfect for the summer.  It has a nice, fresh taste and was easy to make.  Being able to eat it immediately was a nice touch too since most salads like this need to sit overnight to let the flavors meld.  Used halved grape tomatoes instead of chopped whole ones like the picture shows.  The fresh cilantro is a must.  Will definitely make again.

Used kidney beans as I can't find canned black beans and omitted olive oil to cut calories. Great salad! It'll definitely become a staple recipe for us. To make a meal out of it, I added feta cheese and rolled the mixture in tortillas.

I loved this recipe!!! 
Made a couple of changes though. I used grape tomatoes and cut them in half instead of whole tomotoes. I also used an orange pepper to add another color which really looked great. I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used black and a dash of chili powder. Served it for company with deli sandwiches. There was no leftovers!!! Big Hit!!

I'd give this one ten stars if I could!  Made it for an Easter luncheon, and everyone raved.  I found it to be simple to prepare (exactly as per the recipe), and fairly economical.  The flavors blend nicely, and fairly dance on your tongue.  Try this one!!!

I have been making this for a couple of years after finding the recipe here.Quick to make. Fresh clean taste. Have made with and without the advocado. Make this the day you plan to serve and let set on the countertop. If you have any leftovers to refrigerate the dressing changes consistancy and I don't like as well the next day.

This is so yummy.  Omitted avocado and tomatoes because I didn't have any (will use next time since I love both).  Used a whole package of frozen corn, 1 can of black beans, 1/2 a bunch of cilantro, juice of 2 limes, 1 green pepper chopped in tiny pieces, scallions, a bit of olive oil, salt, pepper, lots of garlic powder, lots of minced garlic, cayenne pepper.  Next time I may add red and yellow peppers, and a small red onion in place of scallions. I like to change my recipes around.

Incredibly wonderful!  Even my son who claims he doesn't like cilantro went back for seconds!  I also followed another's suggestion and used Trader Joe's frozen roasted corn -- I also used their canned black beans.

This is awesome!  I made this for 4th of July and it was a big hit.  I used only 1/3 cup of oil though and added more cayenne pepper.  Can't wait to make this again.

Every time I make this people always love it - and I always wonder why I don't make it more often. It's a great summer salad, and the extra is just as good or maybe even better as it sits in the fridge. The avocados don't even seem to get dark.

Sometimes I add 2 avocados since I love them, one & a half red peppers (same reason) and just one 18 oz can of black beans just because .. And the dressing made as is is enough even with some extra veggies. 

I think the fresh lime juice is what I love the most. Oh yeah, and I add a few cloves of garlic instead of one.

I use this as a salsa.  It is amazingly addictive.  I sometimes don't even add the oil.  I like a little cayene for spice.

Delicious and easy.  I used 1 can each of black beans and small white beans which gave the dish great color.

Great flavour! For the dressing, I cut back on the oil and added an extra 1/8 of a teaspoon of cumin. For the salad, I used corn on the cob that I'd roasted on the barbeque. It tasted even better the following day, but next time I make this I'll probably add the avocado to each serving individually - it went brown in the fridge overnight.

This salad is awesome!  My kids will even eat it.  They like it as a salsa with chips.  For personal preference, I leave out the red pepper and then use red onion instead of scallions.  I also use small grape tomatoes cut in half.  Sometimes I add fresh jalapeno slices.  Lime and cilantro are 2 of my favorite accents; this salad wonderful!

Everyone at my family reunion loved this salad. I cut way down on the oil to a couple tablespoons and left out the avocado for the picky eaters, and it turned out very tasty. Great as a salsa with tortilla chips!

A wonderfully refreshing recipe! And I devoured this on a cold January evening - I can just imagine it on a hot July day out on our patio with friends and a cold beer - Yum.

(I substituted the cilantro for a tbsp of fresh basil and served with Tortilla chips)

This was yummy!  I didn't add the 2nd tomato and skipped on the cilantro (which I advise against), since I was running low on time.  I only used about 1/4 cup of olive oil and it was plenty.  This would also be good tossed in bottled italian dressing.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe! Definitely better the next day, except the avocado does get a bit mushy. 
The only way this recipe feeds 4-6 people is if they're hungry linebackers and this is the only thing you're feeding them. I'd say this recipe feeds at least 10 people as a side dish.

I replaced the frozen corn with can of kernal and then I added some bits of canned pineapple to give the dish a sweet flavor to it, which worked well. My husband and I really enjoyed it and will probably make it again.

I was so excited about the reviews I read, and couldn't wait to make this salad to bring to a cookout.  I brought it Sat., and hardly anyone touched it.  I thought it was good...more like a fresh summer salsa than a salad...very pretty and colorful presentation, and smelled terrific.

Deee lish!  Except watch if your black beans are salted or not.  If they are salted, make sure you don't add another whole teaspoon.  Plus, I found that 1/3 cup oil was enough.  Try adding cumin and oregano, too!

The fresh lime dressing is great! I used only one can of beans and added to fresh
romaine lettuce. It makes the salad a little lighter. Great with the Grilled Halibut II
in lime marinade.

Oh-so-fabulous!
I made this salad to suit my tastes by leaving out the avacado and the
red bell pepper...in it's place I added extra tomato.
(One- 14.5 ounce can of Eden Organic
diced tomatoes)  This salad is so very tasty and colorful, can't wait to bring it along
to a summer barbeque!

I LOVE this recipe and have made it for years!  I have changed it by adding half of the olive oil,  and adjusted the spices to the flavors to what my family likes.  I've also used it to top tacos, added it to salads as a dressing, and used it as a dip with chips!  EVERYONE loved it, also!

This is beyond what I was expecting. It was so good, I called my sister to come over so she can try some! I am trying to go vegetarian and this somewhat tastes like the ceviche I use to make! Definitely will be making this again. It is so easy and no cooking is required! Love it!     BTW, I used only half of what the recipe required for olive oil.  I also used Del Monte Fire Roasted Corn in a can. I believe it gives it more flavor. I think cucumbers would have been a nice touch, however, I didn't have any.

Made this for company, as written. Got raves, even from my husband who doesn't like black beans!  I made this in the morning but kept the tomatoes and avocado separate until ready to serve, as others suggested.  I put some of the salad dressing and the cut up  avocado in a baggie and it stayed green until dinner time when I added it to the rest of the salad.  In fact, 2 days later when we ate the last of the salad the avocado was as fresh looking as when it was first cut up.  Will definitely make this again!

I love this recipe. Most recently, I scaled it down to 3 servings, for my husband and myself, intending the third serving for next day's lunch. It is a generous recipe, and made enough, even scaled, for additional servings. I made it with canned "peaches and cream" corn, containing little to no liquid, and I refrigerated the corn and the beans before making the salad. For me, fresh cilantro is a must, but because my husband does not like cilantro, I left it out of the mix, adding it to my serving only. I have made it twice, the full recipe for a pot luck, and the scaled down version for my husband and myself. It is a lovely side dish for those who like beans and corn, and It would mix well with cold, leftover rice, or as a side dish for any Southwestern or Mexican themed meal. The cayenne pepper is just the right amount to tickle the tongue without being too hot.  I served it with planked salmon and small flour tortillas, with berries and vanilla yogurt for dessert. I look forward to making it part of a meal, again!

As the other reviewers stated, MORE lime juice/less oil.  fresh corn off the grill is best too.  I used halved cherry tomatoes and twice the cilantro.  Also crushed a few corn chips on top to serve. Delicious!

I used Roma Tomatoes, seeded, and nothing got 'mushy'...I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup.
This is sooo delicious!
Very Versatile!
Thank you so much for the Recipe!

This is a great and sustaining salad.  As advised by previous reviews, I decreased the olive oil.  YAY!  I also added a little cumin to the salad; at our house we do like cumin.  I kept the avocado (as they get icky so quick), cilantro (not agreeable to some), and green onions (my husband dislikes onions) on the side.  Perfect.

We really liked this! The only change I made was to add a little cumin (we love cumin in this house), and next time I will add some cooked quinoa to make it even healthier.  Great recipe!

I loved it and so did all my family and friends who I served it to. I had read that there was too much oil in the recipe but  made it according to the recipe and it was really good. I added the avocado at the end, so it would not go dark, but the leftovers the next day showed the Ava Ido still bright green. I imagine the lime kept it great. Will make again for sure.

Reduced the Olive Oil to 1/4 cup, squeezed 3 limes into the oil, then served this with BBQ fish and it was perfect. My brother is Gluten free and really appreciated this dish.

Excellent!  I also used only ¼ cup oil and increased the fresh lime juice to ½ cup plus  I added a cup of cooked Orzo pasta and made a Southwest Pasta side dish salad out of it.

Awesome! I cut the oil by half and did a slight pinch of Stevia to balance the acidity of the lime. Turned out great.

Easy and tasty! I used more lime juice than the recipe called for..about 1/2 a cup.... and less olive oil and fewer tomatoes, but mostly because that is my taste preference. I also saved the avocados and added them st the end since I didn't want them to get mushy. Cilantro adds a lot of flavor.

We love it because its light and refreshing!  I didn't really change the recipe except for adding a bit more lime juice. The oil was overpowering so I might reduce it next time or not use extra virgin.

I was skeptical but once I made it I could just smell the aroma. The only change I made was I cooked my beans and corn and then mixed it with the raw veggies. Such a great meal for vegans. Will make again.

We took this to a potluck last night and several people asked for the recipe.  I used 1/4 cup of EVOO, plus a little extra lime juice, and halved grape tomatoes to cut down on the juiciness. This recipe is definite keeper.

In 2000, "Black Bean and Corn Salad II" was the first vegan recipe I ever made from Allrecipes. I love this salad - especially the beautiful colors and zippy dressing - and have made it at least a couple dozen times now. I have always made it with black beans that I cooked myself in the pressure; however, today I used canned black beans for the first time. I find this salad infinitely better with the fresh-cooked beans (significantly different taste and texture). Thank you Jen for sharing your recipe.

Great recipe! I didn't have fresh corn, substituted frozen (cooked and cooled) and it was still great!  I added a dash of cumin and more garlic than the recipe specified, but that is just personal taste.  I served it with Orange-Chile Tilapia also on this site - deliciousl!  Overall a wonderful recipe that I will use again. Great idea for summer picnics.

Fabulous recipe! I was worried that the salad might possibly have too much salt, but I did not change a thing and the salad was amazing!! Everyone loved it. I went with fresh lime juice which truly makes a world of difference. I also added the cilantro although I only used about 1/2 cup which was perfect for our tastes. Some suggested that there was too much oil, but I would not agree. I used a light flavored olive oil so maybe that is why the oil was not a problem for us. Thank you Jen, for a recipe that I am sure we will make again and again. :)

this salad was unbelievable!!! I made some minor altercations and added tomatoes last to avoid mushiness! I skipped on avocados but it was so delicious! I served it with wild grain rice and grilled blackened chicken and it went very well together! I will be making this again!!!!

This recipe was great!  My husband and I both loved it!  I didn't have fresh cilantro so I used frozen cilantro and whisked it into the lime dressing -  it worked great!  Next time I will use less corn, and more artichoke - Thanks for the recipe!

Cilantro? Lime? Does it get any better when those two are both listed as ingredients?? My favorite summertime salad! We add a bit more salt to taste, and then eat it up. Great with burgers on the grill!

I used less olive oil & lime juice for the dressing, as well as an extra clove of garlic and I still didn't use all of the dressing! I absolutely love the recipe though, it's delicious. I like mine better with fresh corn though.

Made without any changes and received many compliments at a Memorial Day cookout. Nice light side to go with all of the heavier food. I might try fresh corn cut from the cob next time to make it even better if I have more prep time to spare.

Loved it!  Very good!  I will take this to my next potluck.  I used 1/4 cup red onion instead of green and used a little less oil than recipe suggested.  I didn't have cayenne so I used cumin instead.

This is an amazing dish with tons of flavor.  It looks best just after you've tossed the ingredients together.  The next day it tastes even better but the looks do suffer as it wilts.  It has become one of my favorite recipes for pot lucks because it is always different and popular.

Amazing!!  Made this for a BBQ on Labor Day and it was a hit. Excellent flavor... At least the way I made it. I left cilantro out and up the red pepper and garlic. Left the oil and lime ratio the same.  I don't like green onion so I sautéed white onion and added the peppers (red and orange). It was very yummy!!  Did I mention this was fabulous?  Well IT WAS!!!

I was put in charge of a side dish for a cook out that the main dish was grilled tacos so I found this recipe and thought it would just be ok.  It makes a lot and it does take some time to put together.  The fresh ingredients make it great so it's worth the time it takes in chopping!  I read reviews where the oil was cut to 1/4 cup so I did change that for mine as well and it was perfect.  I will definitely make this again.  Everyone loved it and there was not one bite left.

Holy schmoly, this is a winner. I omitted the bell peppers because I don't care for them, and used boiled corn on the cob instead of frozen. It is so delicious! If I could improve one thing, it would be to add more avocado, perhaps increasing the amount to 2 whole avocados. All the same, I will be making this easy salad again and again.

So if you are too tired or lazy to cut up all the veggies I used some fresh salsa I had on hand and mixed it with the corn black beans avocado lime and I used knorr tomato seasoning to add a bit more flavor. You don't even need the oil and it's a super healthy snack my kid loves!

So delicious. The only change I made was to half the amount of olive oil. And I agree that fresh squeezed lime juice is a must. I could eat a big bowl of this as a meal. I served it as a side dish at a get-together, and most people ate this with tortilla chips. Although I had not intended for it to be an appetizer, it turned out to be the hit appetizer of the night. It was very good with tortilla chips.

Everyone loved this salad.  I used a can of corn, 1 can black beans, only 2 Tbsp olive oil, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 cup chopped cilantro.  I left out the cayenne pepper.  I was in a hurry and so instead of making the dressing separately I threw everything together and mixed it up.  I did add the avocado at the end and gently mixed that in.  I served this salad as a side dish and filling for 'Pico de Gallo Chicken Quesadillas.'

A fantastic recipe...thanks Jen. I'm a big fan of cumin, so add a bit, and stir in the tomatoes close to serving time. Also was inspired by a recent trip to Puerto Rico where I tasted something similar (but not quite as good), and used chopped fresh mangoes instead of tomatoes, which was a delicious version.

This salad was so tangy and yummy. I put in extra corn. Definitely use the cilantro. It could easily be a meal by itself, but I served it with the Key West chicken and grilled pineapple recipes from this site.

Yum!!  Made for a family meal to go with beef and rice enchiladas.  Perfect!  Based on some of the reviews I read, I used less oil.  I did equal parts lime juice and olive oil.  And in place of the cayenne, I used half a tsp of chili powder and half a tsp of cumin.  Everyone loved it and we ate it all!

You can make ahead, but add the avacado when ready to serve.

HUGE HIT! I made this for a diner party and everyone loved it. It is bright and colorful and just as tasty. I did use frozen corn instead of canned and I also made black beans from scratch but that is a personal preference to cut down on sodium.

I used less oil and more fresh lime juice.  I definitely recommend the fresh cilantro.   It is very good and I like other reviewers' suggestions of adding pasta and/or chicken for an entree.  It makes a lot and I will probably half it next time as my other family members did not want to try it. Add more salt.

OMG - really, really delicious!!  I doubled this recipe to take to a cookout.  I used only 1/3 cup oil (as stated in this recipe the oil would be WAY too much) and 1/3 cup fresh lime juice.  I used 8 ears of fresh corn and 3 cans of black beans.  I also used red onion very finely diced in place of the green onion.  I kept the salt to 1 tsp despite doubling the recipe.  Left out the cilantro.

Finally, I took several reviewers' suggestions to increase the garlic (used 4 cloves), add 1 tsp cumin and to use halved grape tomatoes.  It was beautiful, healthy and got rave reviews.  

The avocado does get squishy and brown as do the tomatoes so it is best to make this the day you will serve it.

This was really good. I used fresh/organic ingredients like an ear of corn as a opposed to the frozen corn and I used less oil than the recipe required. Came out perfect. Thanks for sharing.

This was an awesome recipe!!  Easy to make and tastes great.  My adjustments (because I love avocado & tomatoes):  added one more of each.  I also used 1/2 the oil....again, my personal preference.  Took this to a family get together and had a number of requests for the recipe.

This is delicious. I don't like avocado so I add chopped frozen artichokes instead. Fresh lime and cilantro are a must.

One of the best black bean salad/dip recipes I have tried. Great with pita chips or on it's own. Healthy and flavorful. Definately use a fresh lime for the best flavor!

This is a great recipe that can be used as a salsa with chips.  A co-worker fixes a similar recipe but without the avocado and calls it cowboy caviar.

Just delicious, Jen! Thank you. I live in a very remote mountain area with a tiny market so I don't always have access to certain ingredients. For that reason, I was forced to use bottled lime juice (egads!) And believe it or not, no olive oil at the market so I substituted with canola. No olive oil at the market but they had big, beautiful bunches of fresh cilantro. Go figure. Definitely add the fresh cilantro if you can. It adds such a bright freshness. It was amazing with my changes so the original must be beyond description. I too, could make a meal out of this as another reviewer mentioned. Thanks again, Jen!

Also makes a great dip with tortilla chips. I'd chill for awhile before serving.  It'd be ok to cut back on olive oil a bit if you wanted and add a chopped jalapeno for a bit of zip.

How did I miss this recipe? I love black beans, I love corn, and I love anything tart...these were perfect! Made minor changes like used less oil, less red bellpeppers (finely chopped), and added finely chopped jalapenos. I wished I had left a little bit of seeds from the jalapenos because i felt it needed a little heat.

You're going to laugh at me but I didn't have enough lime juice but I DID have a bit of leftover margarita mix (cuervo) and YUM!  I really did just use what I had and adjusted accordingly which is probably the real beauty with a recipe like this.  Terrific!

Loved this recipe.  Made a few modifications:  Omitted 1/4 cup of the oil, cayenne pepper, and the bell pepper.  Added 1 tsp cumin, additional 1/3 cup lime juice and 1/2 of a finely chopped Jalapeno pepper.

Good and different to serve with the usual mexican fare - also works well as a black bean and corn salsa!

This was a big hit with our family.  Healthy and delicious!  We just topped our salad with sliced avacados because I didn't want the avacados in with the leftovers while turning brown. I made plenty and the salad was great the next two days.

Great summer salad. Very versatile. I added radishes, English cucumber, black olives. You can really make this your own by adding to your taste.

This recipe was DELICIOUS. So fresh and very healthy.   A few notes:  1. Only 1 can of Black beans 2. fresh-boiled corn (4-5 ears) 3. less oil (I used half what it called for)  Delicious!

I have made this many times. I serve it like a chunky salsa, with a little less olive oil, red onion instead of green, two avacadoes, and with tosito scoops. Makes alot and I never have any left overs when I bring to a gathering.

I liked this.  I tried this one because I wanted to use up some limes I had.  Although I love lime, my family found the quantity a bit sharp. Also I think  the cilantro (if you like it) is essential.  I think next time I will add a touch of sugar to counteract the acidity of the lime. then it might be a 4.  Will definitely do again with modifications.

I tripled this recipe for a party and it was a hit.  I pretty much went by the recipe.  I left out 1 can of beans and 1 cup of corn.  Since I love the tang of lime juice I added more.  I got rave reviews.

Loved this recipe, I consider it more a salsa. I made a few changes thought, I only added one can of black beans and one small can of corn, I found it more balanced with the amount of veggies in this dish. Also I didn't add the cilantro but that is just a matter of taste. Great recipe!

I folllowed the recipe as written. I really love the addition of the cilantro, so much so that I wouldn't say that it's optional; it really elevates the flavors of the salad. Also, be sure to use FRESH lime juice. I tried to get away with the bottled stuff, and it disrupted the flavor of the salad. I also used fresh corn instead of frozen.

A SUPER FAST (not quite as good of course) version of this is a can of black beans and a can of mexicorn, then do a quick version of the sauce w/ olive oil, lime juice, cumin, garlic, cayenne.  Still quite yummy!!! Thanks for the great recipe :D

Yum... I added extra avocado AND some mango.  It's definitely a keeper and I've already had two requests for the recipe!  I also figured out it requires 3 cups of black beans so I can make larger batches with freshly cooked beans!

I thought this was fresh, light healthy.  It has all my favorite things in it.  I made this for a party, so I added a can of beans, a yellow bell pepper and extra avacado.  I decided to add more dressing since I added the extra ingred., but once the salad was nearly gone there was too much dressing left in the bottom of the bowl.  I think next I will cut back on the oil a lot, maybe a 1/4 of a cup and up the lime to 1/2 a cup at least.  If that taste good still I will try even less oil.  Also I read some of the reviews saying the tomato's got mushy, I cut mine up and put them in a small bowl with a little salt for an hour or so to get some water out of them and it worked great.  I didn't add the tomato and avacado till just before leaving for the party, and it was great once we ate it, over a hour later.  I will make this over and over again.  Thanks very much for the recipe!

My family and I have tried this version numerous times and have always enjoyed the flavors.  We've substituted fresh basil for the cilantro, red onions for the green onions, and green or yellow peppers for the red pepper to add some varying color.  What turned into a salad, has now turned into a side appetizer by combining it with scoop tortilla chips.  You won't be disappointed!

I absolutely loved this salad!  I only had one can of black beans, so I also added a can of garbanzo beans.  I only added half of a red bell pepper and added a finely diced jalapeno with the seeds removed.  The last thing I did diffently is I added grape tomatoes cut in half instead of regular tomato.  This salad is so light and refreshing, I'll definitely be making it again!

This was so good.  I took it to a family bbq and everyone loved it.  I kept a little at home fore myself to use as a dip for chips.  Man, just thinking about it makes me want it again.

Funny story...I made this last year to take camping with 2 other families. They couldn't stop eating it. My husband's birthday is coming up and he has to take something to work, so he has been trying to make this salad, without the recipe. I told him I would make the salad for him. Its a great salad alone or with chips.

The only thing we change is to omit the green onion and add 3 cloves of garlic instead of one-- just our personal preference. My husband and I love this recipe! Great for summer BBQ's! Thanks for sharing!!

YUM!  Do yourself a favor and if you have a Trader Joe's nearby, use their Frozen ROASTED corn instead of canned corn.  Oh.My.God!  Your tastebuds and guests will be thanking you! (...and if you choose to make it a special day and toss in a little crumbled bacon, you might just eat this by yourself out of the bowl standing over the sink and not share it with anyone!! :)

I'd give this 10 stars if I could.  The fresh lime juice makes it wonderful, plus I added some lime zest to it just for fun.  Didn't have a red pepper, didn't feel like substituting a green pepper, so left it out, but it was so yummy I didn't miss it.  Try this recipe, you will like it.  Even my picky eater loved it.

I'm asked for the recipe everywhere I take this salad.  Here are the changes I made: 1/2c lime juice, 1/4c olive oil, 2 cloves of garlic, 1/4t. chili powder instead of cayenne pepper (it's what I had), and added 1/2t. oregano, 1/4t.+ cumin for the dressing.  I used canned corn instead of frozen (I think it has more flavor that way), quartered grape tomoates and I add a medium cucumber, seeded and diced.  Be sure to put the diced cucumber between two paper towels to absorb some of the liquid or your salad will be very saucy the second day.

This is delicious!  Everyone at a recent party loved it and many asked for the recipe. I also served this the next day over greens with cherry tomoatoes, avacado, and crushed up tortillas to make a mexican style salad. So yummy!  Great in the summer for a picnic salad.

This was very good. I cut the olive oil down to 3 tbsp. as I feel the avocado makes that much olive oil unnecessary, and cutting it it brings the calorie count way down. I'd rather add an extra avocado instead and I may try that next time.

I love this recipe!  I make it all summer long when we cook out.  I don't add garlic or onions and I add a can of chick peas along with the black beans, sometimes butter beans-canned.  I always add extra lime juice and cilantro and let it sit over night so the flavors come together.  I add the avocado right before serving.

This is hands down my favorite salad of all time.  Every single time I've made it (which is a LOT), I have been asked for the recipe.  I've made it exactly as the recipe states and it's fantastic.  I have tweaked it just a tiny bit to suit my needs - I only use 1 tomato because I am not a big tomato fan.  I also only use 1/8 cup of olive oil.  I also often leave out the avocado.  It's FANTASTIC with the avocado, but sometimes I'm just not willing to shell out the money for one.  The salad is still amazing without it. :)

This recipe is surprisingly simple and tastes amazing.  I didn't have limes on hand and used the refrigerated juice and it still came out good.  The recipe is also flexible, if you are missing an ingredient or two you can substitute or even leave out.  Also, I used the leftovers to make Tex-Mex Omelets.  Delicious.

Very, very good salad.  I used it with fajitas but it would be a good compliment to any Mexican meal.  It makes a lot of salad, so it's good for a big group.  I didn't make any changes to the seasonings as they are excellent the way Jen has them.  I did subsitute whole grape tomatoes for the larger tomatoes, though when I read the review about the tomatoes making the salad too soggy to eat the leftovers the next day.  And it worked.  We enjoyed the salad the next day, too.

Everybody loves this recipe.  I've made it three times now for several functions and I have people taking home containers.  My caterer even asked for the recipe.

I did cut the olive oil as suggested by several people and made it spicy with about three splashes of hot sauce.  Very easy recipe and even a non cook can do this one.

I couldn't find fresh tomatoes when I made this recipe so I bought 2 cans of diced tomatoes and rinsed them well. The comments were they were the freshest tomatoes of the season. I also left out the cayenne pepper. We love this salad and everyone who had it has asked me to bring it to the next event we have.

This is officially my favorite salad. It's extremely easy to make, keeps well, it's healthy, and best of all it is absolutely delicious. I've made it as a side dish for baked Tilapia and also along with grilled chicken, and both meals were a huge hit. I highly recommend this recipe for any meal, but I think you could really impress some relatives if you brought it to a family function.

A little cilantro goes a long way, so if you're like me and don't cook with it that often, remember that it's a lot easier to add more than take it out. Also, the amount of olive oil in the recipe is too much! You can get away with using a lot less.

This was so good and refreshing. A good way to use some of your homegrown tomatoes.  I didn't have an avocado so I made this without it. Also, I was short a little lime juice so I used a combo of lime and fresh lemon juice.  Still very good.

So yummy! I did not have green onion so omitted that ingredient. I used canned corn (drained) and added a little extra garlic & pepper to the dressing. Everyone raved more about this salad than they did about the main dish. Thanks!

I  agree with others reviewers, this is great with a bit more cayenne, and I have a suggestions for those who want the leftovers for the next day.  I am from the midwest, and I love avacado, but the firm ones are not always available, they come home too soft.  So instead I grate up carrot.  I know, not a good as the avacado but it makes the salad hold up for the next day, retains it colors and by leaving the avacado out, you don't get they mushy, murky look the next day.  (Besides, carrots are cheaper here and have way less calories!)

Oh, wow.  This is sooo good!  The avacado, the lime juice, the cilantro all work together to make this special.  I have other black bean and corn salad recipes that I like, but this one outdid them all.

Made this for a July 4th potluck and it got rave reviews.  I added an extra avocado and used a whole 16oz bag of corn, and used slightly less oil (1/3 c) per other reviews.  This is good so many different ways - by itself, on salad, with grilled chicken, on chips.  I agree that it's not very good the next day - it loses some of it's color and ends up looking mushy and less appetizing.  Could definitely see adding a little extra cayenne pepper for some extra zing.

I've been making this salad for about 4 years now and love it.  I use less oil and a little extra lime juice (fresh).  I also put in extra corn, about the whole bag of frozen super sweet white corn.  I put in extra garlic and I leave out the cayenne.  I love the cilantro, but leave out sometimes depending on who I'm making it for.  I always get requests for the recipe when I bring it to bbq's and potlucks.  I like to eat it as a salad and my hubby likes to use it as a dip for tortilla chips.  My only complaint is with the leftovers the next day..they taste good, but the texture is weird.

Very good...only change was to reduce the salt by 1/2.  I do feel that it is a little bland -- needs a little something -- not sure what.

Used 2 ears of roasted corn, left out garlic, red peppers and 1 can of beans and only 1/8 cup oil.  Used lemon juice instead (no limes around), 2 chopped and seeded jalapenos, added chili powder and cumin.  I found I needed to add the jalapenos and extra lemon juice for that extra zing but it was a great vegetarian meal for my DH and me. It was better the next day and since there was so much lemon juice, the avocado didn't oxidize much at all.  Will definitely make again, thanks!!

Best black bean and corn salad out there!  The avocado and red pepper plus the yummy lime dressing make it even better!  I have had MANY requests for this recipe.  I usually serve it with tortilla chips and whatever is left over gets eaten up at the meal!  A+++

I've made this several times for home and to take to potlucks at work. Everyone loves it. I add a finely chopped jalapeno or two and more cilantro. Good served with baked Tostitos-like a dip. I calculated it on Weight Watchers and came up with 3 points per serving. Lots of fiber.

So fresh tasting and fantastic.  The lime dressing helps the salad taste light.  A great meal by itself or the perfect side for chicken or fish on the grill.

This is a delicious and fresh salad. I am giving only 4 stars because I think that it can be a little bland if you don't use the cilantro, which the recipe lists as optional, and I usually add more garlic as well.  A wonderful recipe!

Very pretty salad and good!  Next time I will cut the olive oil back...it seemed to overpower the rest of the salad.  It got better and better with every passing day!  Because of avocado turning brown so quickly, I added it to each serving and did not toss it in.

VERY TASTY!  Although I omitted the tomatoes.  I substituted red onions for the green onions.  Like others here I cut down on the oil to 1/3 and used only one can of black beans.  Oh...I added added some chili powder and cumin to the dressing and more cayenne pepper to taste.

Excellent salad!! I did cut the oil to 1/3 of a cup, used one can of cannellini beans and one can of black beans and used an anaheim pepper for a little more "heat" but everything else was perfect!! Everyone ate mare of the salad than of the main dish!! Definitely worth making again and again!!

I made this yesterday for our Mother's Day Luncheon, and boy did everyone love it! I made it exactly like the recipe, except I went to two grocery stores and they were out of avocados. So I put a little guacamole in the sauce, which gave it a very nice taste. I thought I would have leftovers for lunch, but when I got my bowl it was empty! Very nice salad for something different than the average green salad.

This was a yummy salad.  The black beans give it some protein so this could stand alone.  Good choice on a hot day with some grilled steak or chicken.

YUM!!!  Tastes even better the next day.  When I make again (and I definitely will), I'll make a day ahead and add avocado just before serving.  Eating leftovers right now with a fresh sliced avocado.  So good.

We reallly enjoyed this.  I used 1 can of corn and 1 can of rinsed black beans.  I also added 1/2 of a can of drained diced tomatoes and 1# of precooked shrimp too.  I forgot all about the avocado until everything was at the table so I skipped it.  I really would have enjoyed the addition.  This is really quick, easy and light and would be great in the summer.  Thanks for sharing!

This was WONDERFUL!  I am going to make big servings of this that will last all week long.  The longer it sits the more the lime juice brings out the flavor.  What a great recipe! I could eat this again and again!  Tangy, juicy, and WONDERFUL!!

This was amazing.  It has a great blend of flavors and wonderful texture, even after a couple of days in the refrigerator.  I served it with barbecue chicken and then had more the following day for lunch over a bed of lettuce . . . yummy!

This is the best bean salad I have ever made.  My family loves it.  It is even better the next day but can't stick around too long because it will become mushy.  Whenever I bring this as a side dish it is alway gone.  I have never had any to bring back home!

What an easy, healthy and tasty recipe!  The only modifications I made were to use a can of corn rather than frozen.  I am not a fan of cilantro, so I didn't add any. I served over lettuce and with chipotle  pork tenderloin (from this site).  The next day I chopped up leftover pork, added lettuce and it made a great lunch salad.  I have a little left and I think I will have for a snack with chips. It makes a lot and it is so versatile.

excellent and easy.  but don't let it sit too long or even overnight - it gets sort of thick.  it's fresh-tasting, crunchy and healthy!  served it as a side along with a quesadilla - delicious!  thanks

All the right ingredients, the recipe calls for frozen corn, I served it too early and the corn was still frozen and just too cold, the next day it was a bit better, I probably will try the recipe again.

Delicious! I only made half a batch to try it out and wished that I had made the whole recipe. This was awesome. I had to stop myself from eating it before I put it in the fridge! I used a little freshly ground black pepper in the marinade also. I will definitely be making this often.

So good and fresh! I thought, for sure, this would have to sit before I could munch on it, but I ate a nibble before I put it in the fridge and it was awesome! I imagine it will just get better as it sits for a little while...yum!

I cooked my own blcak beans instead of canned,because of that, I think it affected the flavor.  It was ok ,it lacked something but could not put my tongue on it. Overall, it was ok.

I made this for a party over the summer and wound up eating half of it myself. This is an excellent recipe! We ate it both on its own and with corn chips (like salsa). It's a bit time-consuming with all of the chopping, but it's worth it. Will definitely make again!

It's a good salad, but it made a LOT.  The avacados turned brown and mushy by the time my husband and I could finish the leftovers.  I'd suggest only making enough for one night of dinner.

This is amazing.  I also used red instead of green onions and lemon instead of lime juice.  (That's what I had on hand.)  Do yourself a favor and use Green Giant Extra Sweet Frozen Corn...yum.  I forgot to add the pepper, and I'm glad I did.  I can't see how it could taste any better!  Thanks for a new favorite recipe!

YUM!  I added the avaocado at the last minute, but made the rest around noon to serve with dinner and let it set in fridge for a few hours.

Super easy, super great taste!  Whole family loved this healthy salad. I omitted the salt as we restrict salt in our household and it wasn't even missed with the tartness of the lime juice. Excellent recipe.

MMM....I'll make this again. It was so quick, easy, healthy. I did not use avacado, but instead put in 2 diced zuchinni and also used 1/2 purple onion instead of the green onions.I also used 1/2 cup fat free caesar dressing instead of the olive oil, still used the lime and spices. Everyone loved it.

This is my favorite recipe to bring to a picnic or to have friends come over.  Its fast and easy to remember, although it is a lot of chopping.  To make it easier, I usually put in one can of black beans and one can of corn.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  We have made this several times because it is so easy, fast, and everyone likes it.  It is good made with the two cans of beans or even with one can of beans and the same of everything else (except dressing).  We used less olive oil than stated and instead of measuring the lime juice just squeezed 1-2 limes over it.  Also, it tastes great with a little cheddar cubed up and mixed in with it to make is a good dinner salad.  We will continue to make this!

Wow!  If I could give this more than 5 stars I would!  The only thing I did different was use chili powder instead of cayenne pepper to tone it down a bit.  And it still had fantastic flavor.  This recipe is certainly a keeper!!

I served this as a southwestern-style salad, on a bed of leaf lettuce and corn chips.  I added a pinch of sugar to the dressing to counter balance the extreme tart of so much lime.  I also added 4oz of cubed white-cheddar with chipolte for a bit of something extra.  This fed my family of six with leftovers.

This was good, but a little too sour.  Next time I'll cut the lime juice in half. Also, I substituted pinto beans for the black beans which I'm glad I did.

I LOVE this and make it all the time!  The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the dressing is not very flavorful. I use 2 T. lime juice and 1 T. apple cider vinegar in place of 1/3 c. lime juice, I don't use as many green onions, I use garlic salt in place of salt and cumin, chili powder to taste.  Get the seasoning perfect and then add avocados just before serving.  It is yummy tossed in a green salad, or tossed with pasta.  We like to also combine it with brown rice and some tomatillo dressing and roll up in a wrap.

This was exceptionally good & great for the health conscious!  I used green bell pepper instead of red, and cut the olive oil in half and the lime juice down by one quarter (I don't like a lot of dressing!).  Thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious!  Lime juice and cilantro give it a wonderful flavor.  Make sure to use lime juice, do not substitute for lemon juice.  Next time I would probably add another avacado.

WOW, super yummy side to a mexican feast but Im also looking forward to having it as a lunch main dish with the leftovers. I cut back on the oil in the dressing to 1/3 cup and it was still good. Probably could have used even less. Great easy and healthy recipe!

This is probably THE best recipe on this site!  With a few small changes, it has become my favorite (and most requested) recipe. I omitted the olive oil, added a little pepper, 1-2 jalapenos, half a bunch of cilantro instead of 1/2 cup, and one extra clove garlic.  This is more like a salsa - so I serve it with tortilla chips.  It's wonderful!!

I love this recipe.  I have made it many times, just now getting around to rating it.  I have handed out the recipe several times, as well.  I usually serve it as a "salsa" with chips.  This is a recipe I will continue to use.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Awesome!  This is a keeper!  I followed the recipe exactly (well, changing the oil to a 'scant' 1/2 c.) and it was gone!  I juiced 3 fresh limes - fresh lime was key.  I would probably leave out the avacado the next time.  I don't think it made any flavor difference, and this does make a lot so it probably does get mushy.

Served this with chicken enchiladas and spanish rice.  The lime is an essential element so don't leave it out. I also loved the cilantro in it and wouldn't consider it any other way. Delicious!

We really like this salad.  The only change I made was the cilantro.  I prefer parsley.  I used cilantro the first time I made it.  But since then I changed it to parsley.  It tastes best the next day.  Thanks for this recipe I have been looking for a good black bean and corn salad for some time now.  This is a keeper for me.

Delicious!  The only thing I would note is that the serving size seems a little large.  I made the recipe as a side dish for 6, and had quite a bit left over, which got a soggy in the fridge.  I would recommend only dressing what you plan on serving immediately, and keep the rest separate for fresher-tasting left overs.

This was absolutely delicious! My new favourite salad, for sure. I made a few slight changes to the dressing: only used 1/4 c. of olive oil, added about 2 tbsp rice vinegar, a couple teaspoons of sugar, an extra clove of garlic, and an extra 1/4 tsp of cayenne.

This was great, didn't change a thing except using extra-virgin OO, and it was a very pretty dish next to the steak and potato dinner. I used parsley because that's what I had, but I love cilantro so that's probably better. I would use what you most prefer, since they're usually interchangeable. Good stuff.

This is a favorite in our house.  I've served this with the "scoop" tortilla chips and I've also put this mixture into a tortilla.  You can add a little less oil.  Also, for my family, I add enough corn to equal the amount of black beans.

This salad was good but made WAY too much.  Most of it ended going bad in the fridge because there was no way we could eat that much. I would sugguest either cutting the recipe in half or only making it for larger parties (6 or more people).

I used 4 tablespoons of olive oil (it doesn't need more), grape tomatoes and 1 red onion instead of green onions.  The onions gave it a nice crunch.   I also added the avacado last right before serving.  I served it with lime tortilla chips and it was really good.

A great recipe -- nice and colorful, with a fresh, lively taste!  I doubled the amount of corn, using freshly cooked corn off the cob, and used only one can of black beans.  I didn't have any cilantro, so I left that out but didn't miss it.  I think the avocado is optional, too, but I had one and liked the texture and green color that it added to the salad.  I also didn't need all the dressing, so I'm going to try the extra as a marinade for chicken breasts.

Now I can see why this got many 5 star ratings.  This is packed with delicious flavor.  The recipe tastes a lot better than it looks.  My son even liked it.  He's a picky 4 year old that doesn't like to eat much of anything except cereal. Thanks Jen for such a good recipe.

I used canned baby corn cut into bite-sized pieces instead of sweet corn to create a saltier version of this salad - excellent recipe.

SO good. I made a huge batch quickly and easily and it was my lunch for a week - co workers oohed and aahed every day I brought it.  This is a great summer salad and I'll definitely bring it to the next potluck.

FOLLOW UP: I have brought this to two pot lucks so far, and when I mentioned I was bringing it to the most recent, I had a number of people say, "Oh I LOVE that salad!"  Thanks again!

Everyone loved this salad.  I added slightly more lime, and after tasting the dressing, decided to add some cumin and oregano, which gave it a nice kick.  I thought I'd have tons left over, but alas, it was all gone by the end of the meal.  This will be great when the weather gets warm.

I think it could use a bit more of a kick, from chili powder, cumin, etc.  I switched the amounts of lime juice & olive oil as other reviewers suggested and used grape tomatoes cut in half, which didn't get mushy.  I'd also suggest equal amounts of black beans and corn.

WOW, I say.  This recipe is great.  I had people try and want more.  All I got was a small bowl.  I am now in the process of making more.  This will be a summer staple.  Like other reviewers I switched the oil and lime juice.

Fantastic salad!  I never got to serve it because my family kept 'tasting' it before mealtime.  I made it a day ahead...my mistake!  Next time I will have to either hide it or make it at the last minute.  A great recipe.

I love this salad all year round but what a great summer dish. I reduce the olive oil to 2 tbs. with great results.  I make a simple chicken marinade of lemon juice and green jalapeno sauce.  This salad compliments the grilled chicken and makes a nutritious meal.

Very tasty.  As many others said - it was better the next day. Next time, I'd add the avocado at the last minute (it was a little mushy).

I used halfed cherry tomatoes and I think it cut down on the "mush" others had mentioned.  I used this as a burrito filling with some lettuce and shredded cheese and it was delicious.

Everyone really liked this salad, even the skeptics!  We had it with BBQ ribs, but I think it would be even better with grilled chicken or fish.

This is a great recipie! I agree with the idea of leaving it in the refridgerator for about an hour to "marinade" this way all of the flavors blend. I served it as a salsa with tortilla chips, everyone loved it!!

Taste delightful and very colorful! It gets a little soggy after a while, so next time I'll cut down on the moisture. I'll also cut down on the olive oil. The amount of lime used is just right! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This salad was amazing!  My whole family loved it and are still talking about it almost a week later.  The combination of flavors is absolutely delicious, and I ate the little bit of leftovers we had on some mixed greens for lunch the next day.  I did not use avacado and based on previous comments, used about half of the dressing.  This is going to be a favorite.  Thanks.

I made this for a school function and it was a big hit.  Many teachers asked for the recipe.  I didn't use cayenne in the dressing though, I used Tapatio, which added a little zip.

Excellent. You may roast the corn frozen corn niblets in oven by rubbing with a little olive oil, spread on a cookie sheet at 375 in oven  until golden brown 30-40 min. Stir from time to time. This is really worth the effort as it does add a lot of flavor to an already fantastic salad

This one is definately a keeper.  I made the full recipe for my husband and I and we loved it and had leftovers.  It was even better the next day.  I wouldn't hesitate to make it ahead and put the avacado in at the last minute although the lime kept the avacado from turning dark even by the next day.

Used 1/4 olive oil per other reviews.  Subbed red bell peppers for tomatoes just because I don't like tomatoes.  The salad was very yummy.  Family ate it with tortilla chips as well.  We are trying to eat vegan and this salad is perfect with the beans adding protein.

Exceptional.  Made it just as written 1 day in advance for a Super Bowl Party and it was a major hit.  The seasonings are perfect for those who like full flavor but no heat.  Served chopped jalapeno on the side for those who wanted heat.  Everyone was happy!

Awesome and fresh. Yummy with multigrain tortilla chips from Aldi. Flavor improves with time. Make the day before BUT add avacado just before serving

Was really good.  I put 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper.  I made this for a pot luck at work and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.

I didn't add any olive oil and it was still very moist and delicious. I wanted to make this as a snack or meal since I'm on weight watchers. It is soooooo delicious. Since I didnt use the olive oil the only points were for the avacado (which is good, but I'm sure it is good without as well). Eat with a spoon, lip smacking, filling, good.

Next time I'm going to try canned diced tomatoes (save time) to see if it is still as good. I'll try to remember to update this review once I do.

This was fantastic! As suggested by others I only used half a cup of olive oil. I also left out the avacado as my kids don't eat it. My kids still didn't like the salad but all the adults who tried it loved it.

Absolutely tasty! I agree with previous post to add tomato and avocado at the end before serving it to avoid mushiness. I put it in the fridge for a little while. It’s so delicious and refreshing.

This is very similar to Texas Caviar but the lime really makes it fresh for a nice side dish.  The family voted that I keep the recipe.

I have made this several times and served it several different ways. You can use it as a dip with tortilla chips, as a side salad, or as a vegetarian filling in tacos.  Any way you choose, it is delicious.  I do cut back on the oil, as others have suggested, and use avocado oil instead of olive to bring out the real Mexican flavors.  Adjust the heat (cayenne pepper) and spice (cilantro) to your liking.

This salad was fantastic! I loved it and everyone at the birthday party loved it as well. It was quick, easy and delicious. I just added a dash more cayenne and some black pepper and it was good to go. But the cilantro and avocado really brought it all together. A great Summer dish.

The only thing I did differently was I did NOT add the avocado (I like avocado OK, just didn't wanna mess with it) and got so hungry while making it that as soon as I stirred it up, I fixed a bowl.  SO GOOD!!  I'll will definitely make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I thought it was a bit too limey as written, so I'll decrease to 1/4cup of fresh lime for next time. The canned beans probably dictate the final amount salt; I used close to 2tsp. 1/8tsp of cayenne was undetectable which I'll probably replace with a minced fresh jalapeño for next time, and while adjusting the seasoning I added around 1/4tsp of cumin.

I thought  it was great. I  tried to cut back but then wound up using the suggested amount of oil to have enough liquid to coat the salad when stirring. I did however, add extra spices like cumin and seasoning salt to the dressing like some other reviewers for a little extra zing. And I did think the cilantro was a must but I really like it. Everybody really liked it and the leftovers were still great on day 3.

This is a great recipe....colorful and delicious.  I do think next time I'll leave out the avocado, IMO it doesn't add a huge amount of flavor and once mixed in it kind of clouds up the color.  Also without avocado I think the dish keeps better....this stuff rocks on the second day!

Everyone loves it!  I made alterations based on what I had available and would say it’s an alteration-friendly recipe. I used black, kidney, and garbanzo beans. used a can of diced tomato’s with purée, white onions in place of green, didn’t add avacado as the ones we had were kinda rubbery,  and quite likely tripled the garlic lol!

Next time I would double the avocado.  I used a garlic infused olive oil instead of plain oil and minced garlic.  it was delicious and very filling! 

I served it with the baked chicken and rice chimichanga by Lil’ Luna.

Like most folks I reduced the amount of oil in the dressing by half and increased the amount of lime juice and seasoning. I didn't have cayenne pepper but used equal parts chili powder and cumin for heat. A lover of cilantro I also doubled that. If you don't have one of the ingredients like tomato, onion, pepper or avocado you can easily sub that out for more of the others. 

The dressing also makes for a great marinade, 15-20 minutes for thawed shrimp. I made quinoa to go with the salad and shrimp to round out the meal (rice or riced cauliflower are good alternatives). You could easily add a bed of greens under the bean salad if you wanted.

I have made this many times and it's always a hit at family gatherings or a pot luck. If you're serving a mixed crowd you may want to eliminate the cayenne.

This is delicious! I didn’t change anything and it’s perfect. The only thing I didn’t add was cilantro. I think this will be a big hit at the cookout today!

This is a really great recipe that is adaptable to changes to fit what you like. I used canned corn (1 can). Per other reviews, I reduced the olive oil to 1/3 c.  I added a 1/2 t of cumin with the cayenne and it seemed to improve the flavor. I did not add the tomatoes or avocado since I knew I would have leftovers and it would cause the salad to deteriorate.

Really good! Made it for Kal's 5th birthday cookout at Chip's.
Upped the servings to 10, made plenty. Used big glass bowl in teak holder. Didn't defrost frozen corn, just added it to salad & it helped keep things cold. It sat there for at least an hour, tho, so it had thawed b4 lunch. Used alot of the dressing , certainly not all. Did it to taste. Added avocado just b4 serving.

Great, easy, colorful salad. 2 notes though:

 1. Recipe says it serves six, but it serves at least 8-10 as a side dish.

2. I found the dressing too heavy on olive oil. Next time I plan to decrease the olive oil and increase the lime juice.

This is a very tasty and versatile recipe! It's great as a side, a dip for chips, taco or taco bowl topping, we even mixed it in with eggs for breakfast. For a little variety, I've made it with one can black and one can white beans. I also just used a can of sweet corn kernels instead of frozen.

Delicious!!!! Loved this salad. I did make a few adjustments based on many of the previous reviews. I cut the oil to 1/4 cup, added at least double the garlic, and used the black beans/corn in equal measure. The dressing is the best part (and I’ve used it for a few more things!). Even my picky, non- veggie eating teenage boys loved it! Very tasty!!!

This has become my lunch favorite. I utilize it for its nutritional value after I work out. I have made a couple changes to turn it into a lunch dish. I have made it with one can of red beans instead of two cans of black beans. I also add a serving of tuna per bowl to boost the protein.  Having the lime juice in the dressing of the dish with the tuna is awesome.

Yum! I left out the onions and made guacamole separately instead of adding in avocado. This was great with chicken enchiladas, chicken taquitos, and on tacos! It really lightens up heavier Mexican dishes.

This is best if you can make it a day ahead of time. I had made it in the morning and by evening I was still not thrilled, so I added a little cumin. It was ok with our dinner of Mahi Mahi, coconut rice and fried plantains. Cumin really made it pop. The next day it was to die for. I ate the leftovers with tortilla chips and even saved my spouse some so he could see how it improved just sitting overnight.

I added about 1/8 tsp of cumin to the salad, it really added some nice, warm flavor.   I also recommend using two avocados instead of one.

I like how versatile this is, you can change up some of the ingredients and proportions as you like, but the excellent garlic-lime dressing brings it all together.

Made it just the way it is except I didn't have any avocados. The sauce was a bit bland so I added in a little stevia. That did it - yum!!! Thank you for this wonderful recipe that helps my family like raw veggies more! I would give it a 5 with the stevia added! :)

It tastes like you're in Mexico.  The key is the fresh lime juice and the cilantro.  Easy to make,  but set aside a little time for chopping.  I have 4 year old twins and when I finally convinced one of them to try it, she gobbled up some more.  The other twin wouldn't try it but my husband & I both loved it.

I added, a bit more salt, an extra tomato and a second avocado. My lime juice wasn’t fresh...it was out if the bottle so I added fresh lemon juice. I also let it sit it the fridge for an hour to absorb flavors. Fan favorite!

Delicious served warm or cold.  I mashed the garlic clove and sprinkled it with salt and let it sit for a few minutes before adding the other ingredients for the dressing.

This was so-o-o good.  I followed the tips offered in two of the previous suggestions, that is, increased the ratio of lime juice to olive oil and added the tomatoes and avocado last -- for the final light toss -- to keep them from being crushed.  For  my own tastes, I skipped the cayenne pepper, garlic and added a chopped green pepper.  The flavors were a terrific mixture of colors and textures. The cilantro, lime juice and onion were a perfect complement.

This is delicious.  Everybody at our Thanksgiving get-together loved it.  I used avocado oil rather than olive oil and had to leave out the avocado because it was too hard.  It was a hit nonetheless.

We made this as is, with the only exception that we used fresh corn.  It was really really amazing.  We left the avocado out of the whole dish and just added it before we ate it.  This made it great as leftovers as well.  We will absolutely make this again.

Loved this!  As I am trying to cut down on salt, I bought beans that were not additionally salted, and I only added a pinch of salt.  Next time I will add a half teaspoon of salt, as it did need some.

I make this all the time. I use it as a fresh salsa for my homemade street-style tacos. I do use a lot less olive oil, just a couple tablespoons, and add a splash of rice vinegar to cut the oil and lime a bit. So good : )

Didn't like it cold, especially garbanzo beans. Ended up heating up with some pasta. much improved, but the garbanzo beans were still out of place. My fiance felt the same way.

Great salad, really fresh tasting!  I've made it twice now, once as a side with enchiladas and another with fish tacos.  Both times it turned out well and everyone enjoyed it.  Makes a lot and feeds a big crowd, perfect for fiesta nights! I like to add a little extra garlic, zest of lime and some extra spice, but I like it zesty!

I pretty much halved everything. Used frozen kernels  and thaw them under hot water then put them in the fridge to cool down.  After rinsing the beans, I refrigerate them while I prepare everything else.  Substituted cucumber cause I didn’t have green pepper.  This salad is delicious and very satisfying.

I think I've finally found my 'go to' side dish for potlucks, although many people at the party were not treating it as a side dish so much as a salsa to dip dark corn chips into.  Whatever!  I'm making it and bringing it every time.  

The only thing I changed was I added more cayenne pepper and salt.

I decreased the olive oil to 1/4 and still thought it was too much for the salad. Next time will just use lime juice.

I used lemon juice instead of lime, just because that's what I had on hand. I'm sure the lime suits the ingredients better, but lemon worked well anyways. I doubled the garlic, added diced red onion and a cup of cooked quinoa to make it a little more filling. Will make this a regular recipe for sure.

Great, healthy salad. I use only 1/3 cup of oil. I add avacado and tomatoe seperate so that it stores better.

delicious! Great recipe! I used left over corn on the cob which was perfect-- and added in avocado to the bowl I was going to eat.... I thought it would turn to mush sitting overnight. I can't wait to eat it again for lunch ! I think adding diced grilled chicken would be a great way to turn it into a complete meal! My 10 year old thought it was delicious too :)

Delicious.  I Added 1 teaspoon of sugar to the dressing but  otherwise I Made it as directed.  It  was a perfect side dish with pulled pork barbecue. Husband said it is definitely a keeper!

Did not need all the dressing. Even leftovers 2 days later were good. I used 3 ears of fresh corn cooked first for a few minutes.

I made the salad twice.  And each time there were no left over.  This is a side dish.  However, this dish was the talk of the evening.  The rib eye steak entree couldn't even compete with the salad.

Really like this recipe. I did not pour dressing over salad, but let individuals add to suit their tastes.
I used leftovers on sandwiches and wraps.
I used finely chopped red onion as that is what I had on hand.

This is a very forgiving recipe. I made it according to the recipe, but used only  1/4 cup of oil. As it was I could have gotten away with less. The full 1/2 cup would be way too oily I think.
It is delicious and so easy to throw together. It can even be made just before serving adn it still tastes great.

Love this recipe-so easy & tasty.  It’s one of my favorites for any summer pot-luck & it’s always a hit!
Followed the recipe with the exception of the oil.  Per some other tips, used 1/2 olive oil & 1/2 tomato juice to equal 1/3c liquid (I use the tomato juice from fresh tomatoes or canned, diced tomatoes (which I later use in salsa).
Also, I often add orange sweet peppers for another color, & omit the cilantro (per our preference).

Awesome!  I used 2 cans of corn, one yellow and one white and left out the avocado as I knew this was going to be served much later than I had prepared it.  The dressing is so light a fresh.  The quantity was generous and some guests were using the salad on their burgers for a special zip to the routine barbecued hamburger.  I have placed this recipe in my make again file!

This was just okay in my opinion.  Kind of bland but with very sour lime dressing.  I made per recipe but did twice as much corn and half as many black beans as I’m not that much of a bean fan.  I won’t make it again.

We love it!  Every time I make it my family comments that it’s the perfect autumn & Halloween salad because of the colors.  Like others..., I only used 1/4 cp oil & equal amounts of corn & black beans.  I live a weight watchers lifestyle so on the freestyle SP program... you only need to count the Oil & Avacado everything else is free.  Great salad to bring to gatherings !

To me, the taste of olive oil over powered everything else.  If I make it again, I will make drastic changes, such as either omitting the olive oil, or dramatically reducing it.

The amount of oil made this salad distasteful.  I drained off the dressing, added another lime, ground chilli and cumin, and it was much better.  I do not recommend this recipe as is.  Recommended to use no oil for the best results.

Healthy and refreshing!  I make this on a regular basis  and it’s best after the flavors have mingled overnight.

This recipe was pretty good as is.   I think next time I will reduce the amount of oil as suggested by others.   My avacado was on the small side so i think it will use 2 and increase the garlic and cayenne pepper.  Oh and i purchased lime juice instead of squeesing it myself.

added a little more garlic (because im a garlic junkie), but this recipe  is everything! it's refreshing, filling, and non-guilty. I might add quinoa next time. But try this recipe for sure.

You can substitute parsley for cilantro for those who don’t like the latter.  I’m crazy about cilantro though and it’s one of the best things about this simple, fun recipe.

A healthy alternative to the usual cheese heavy appetizers. Eat as a cold salad or with Tortilla chips. I love that the measurements and ingredients do not need to be exact, the recipe is adaptable to individual tastes.

I made this recipe almost exactly as written, in a smaller quantity since just my husband and I were eating it.  I had a bag of the small, multi-colored peppers, and they made this salad even more colorful.  I circled the mound of salad with tortilla chips, since this salad could also be a salsa. We both loved it.

This was GREAT!  I served it on a plate of greens.  My first choice is (Rocket) AKA Arugula but I was out so I used Spinach and then a layer of Quinoa to provide a healthy grain and then the Black Bean and Corn Salad II and then I topped the entire dish with a chicken breast that was seasoned with a southwestern lime seasoning.  It was gorgeous and yummy and very healthy.  The only change I made to the Black Bean and corn salad was that I used fresh corn on the cob that I grilled lightly directly on the grill and got some nice grill marks and cut the kernels off the cob.  I did not put any dressing on the salad until served so that I could have a tasty leftover the following day for lunch without too much of a vegetable breakdown.  Taste is best on the day initially made.

Next time I changed the cilantro for parsley and lemon instead of lime but it was not as good as the original recipe so next time no changes!

Very fresh, healthy and tasty. I made it with grape seed oil because that's what I had. I was making ahead of time for a camping trip, so I didn't add the tomatoes or avocado (didn't want them to get mushy). I did add one whole diced cucumber.

The dressing was pretty good. It could used a little less oil though and a little more cayenne for my taste.  I might also add a little Stevia for sweetness.    I ditched the avocado because the recipe already has almost 20 g of fat without it.     I plan to mix it with  quinoa this week for a few healthy lunches.

A very colorful, appealing salad. I used red onion instead of green, omitted the corn and avocado, but added yellow and orange peppers. I used lemon concentrate but agree fresh real lime juice would make it a 5 star. Very easy to prepare, fast and healthy!

olive oil isn't necessary if you want to steer away from all the extra fat. Adding a bit more lime juice and some parmesan works just as well and tastes great!

I would definitely make it again, but not put the avocado in until the last minute, as it can go soggy.

Great, everyone loved it. I used one can of beans which I just realized after looking at the recipe again. Don't think it would have mattered. This recipe is very forgiving and allows for some variation while still tasting great.

By far the BEST salsa EVER!! A perfect take along to any party!! I love avocado so I always double or triple the amount :) A little too much oil so I cut that in half and add more lime.

Amazeballs! I axe the tomato and Av's because honestly I'm the only one who eats the salad and it takes me about a week. Kick it up with a couple a jalapeños or if you're feeling brave 1 whole scotch bonnet sans seeds. Also add some cumin to this as well, seriously takes it up a notch. Also if you're sick of eating just the salad (ha cause that happens NOT) add some chopped ham, some salsa and some Tex mex shredded cheese ( please don't hurt me for not using caso) and make a calzone one nigh, seriously good eats

Wonderful recipe.  I added quinoa for a high protein meal.  If going that route, I recommend keeping the amount of oil as cited in the recipe so it is not too dry

I was cooking for a large group, so I doubled the recipe, except I only used 150% of the beans called for, making the beans and corn more nearly equal in amount. I used canned corn instead of frozen because that's what I had on hand.  Also, I chose to use cherry tomatoes instead of chopping, because it was easier and allows my kids to more easily avoid them since they don't love tomatoes. I definitely included the cilantro (yum!), and took another reviewer's advice to gently stir in the avocado at the end. I only used about half of the dressing,  so didn't really need to double that.

As for the result...AMAZING! It's a great, healthy and fresh tasting salad that I will definitely make again. It's beautiful to look at too...very colorful. Thanks so much for sharing.

This is absolutely delish!! I make this for dinner often. I throw cold shrimp in as well and serve it as the main dish perfect for a light summer meal. I make a double batch so there's plenty of leftovers. I eliminate the avocado bc my daughter doesn't like them. This is also great thrown in a wrap cold the next day. I only use 1/4 cup of olive oil. And of course, this taste even better the longer it sits in the fridge!

I love this bean salad. Made it the first time just like the recipe. Last time I added some fresh basil, and I used a can of garbanzo beans and a can of black beans. I add the tomatoes when I serve it because they do get soggy. I would only use fresh lime juice.

I followed the recipe and we all really liked this!  only thing I made sure to do was, I chopped the avocado and put it in a small bowl tossed with a little of the dressing and then added it at the very end so it didn't get all mashed up tossing all the other ingredients.

I love this recipe that's called Texas Caviar around here. I modified a few things. I omitted the tomatoes and added an extra avocado. I also replaced the green onions for half a red onion finely chopped. I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used black pepper. It was delicious accompanying turkey sliders.  Everyone loved it! Note: I changed the ingredients because I didn't have everything the recipe asked for.

I  used kidney beans and garbanzo beans, I added some arugula, I used equal parts soy sauce instead of salt (I recommend you do this with all dishes because it adds more flavor, but shhh its a secret), In the sauce I added Brown sugar for a thicker/ sweeter liquid, and I added some extra cucumber and radish. It was very good.

I loved this but wanted to add to the dressing with an extra garlic clove, a bit of added rice vinegar, and some added spices- 1/2 tsps of cumin, paprika and celery salt added. Very very tasty overall!

Loved this! I had some corn that we had grilled and used that. So good! The only other change I made was to chop up two fresh jalapenos and add. Although the dressing did seem to lose it's zip overnight, I just added some more fresh lime juice.

I thought it was just okay (3.5 stars-ish). Pretty much followed exactly (except reduced oil), and it was pretty blah. I added more cilantro  and threw in some balsamic vinegar, which helped a little. I like the avocado addition that I wouldn't normally throw into this kind of salad, but other than that pretty run of the mill.

I decreased oil to 1/3 c, added a tsp of cumin, and added an extra avocado. I think it would have been even better with 3 avocados!  Yummy, fresh, and super simple!

Terrific healthy recipe! Like a few other reviewers, I used 1/4 cup oil instead of 1/2. I also omitted the cayenne pepper (too hot for my family). I served some of it over shredded romaine lettuce, and used the rest as a dip with Tortilla Chips.  Yummy!!

This is very good! I stuck to the recipe for my first try. When I make this again, the only thing I'll change is adding more! I think adding olives would be good. I ate this as a side with fish and tomorrow I'm going to wrap it in a tortilla for my son's lunch.  Great recipe!

So delicious I made it twice in 2 weeks. The second time I used red onion instead of green onion and sweet mini peppers instead of a red cooking pepper.

Very good salad and easy to make.  Made a few changes due to my tastes - didn't use garlic and added more lime  juice.  Loved the flavor the cilantro added.

I would have given it a five if I could have rated the dressing separately.  I followed the dressing recipe exactly but found it too bitter. ...so I added mayonnaise, Splenda and a little milk to thin it out.  Adding this made it absolutely delicious and I will make this again.  I served it with rotisserie chicken.

Very tasty and colorful!!!   The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating was because FOR ME I thought the ratio of the lime juice to the olive oil was a bit too much.   Next time I'll cut back just a little on the lime juice!   Very very good!!!

My family liked this with the adaptions I made due to dietary restrictions some family members have. The dressing was juice of 2 limes which came to the 1/3 c. I used less oil per another reviewer, 1/3c . Also per a reviewer I used almost 1/2tsp of cumin since I couldn't use anything too spicy this time. Also, the last adaption I had to make was using a bag of mixed vegetables instead of just corn. Otherwise , I did add the written recipe ingredients. Even my child liked it. Big cilantro & lime lovers here. Yum!

I will make this again but I will half or quarter the recipe. This serves way more than the suggested 6. The addition of avocado just before serving really enhances the flavor of this salad.

My husband and I absolutely love this salad! I just cut the oil in half as recommended by a few other reviewers. Other than that it is great the way it is. Being a salad it is flexible, so you can use orange or yellow peppers, you can add some extra beans of your choice etc.

This is great. It  keeps very well, too. 2nd day is good eating also. Be sure to add the full complement of lime juice as that keeps it fresh--and the avocado from turning brown if any is to be eaten the next day.

Used garlic powder rather than minced fresh garlic, passed on the cilantro because I always end up throwing out the remainders. Salad itself was good, I thought the dressing was a little bland, possibly the cilantro would have helped; but it was good, I'll make it again, and tweak the dressing a little.
#2 upped the salt and lime juice a little, added about 1/4 tsp white pepper, bought the cilantro.

This was so good, I'll definitely be making this again. I pretty much followed the recipe as written, with the following exceptions; I used cherry tomatoes cut in half, they stay firmer, and I cut the cilantro down - I'm not a fan, but it's needed to make this work.  
Since I made this lunches I omitted the avocado, and then just cut a small one in half to add to my lunch portion. I leave the other half in the container with the pit attached, keeps it from going brown. By doing this, the salad lasted over a week in my fridge.
I saw a mention about using canned corn, I wouldn't recommend that, the canned corn taste would seriously change the taste. I used fresh, but will be using frozen in the winter.

I  made this for my husband's birthday party and didn't change a thing!  My guests loved it, especially the lime juice.  I would definitely make it again.

This is my "go to" summer  salad recipe!  I use fresh corn right off the cob instead of frozen.  I also swap the lime juice and olive oil measurements.  So I use 1/3 cup olive oil and 1/2 cup of lime juice.

This is my go-to summer cookout salad! I've been making it for years and always get rave reviews. I don't add the cayenne, just black pepper, and I always add extra avocado. (If you make it ahead of time, add the avocado just before serving.)

I made this exactly as written and it is wonderful.  The dressing is bright and bold, the proportion of all ingredients is perfect.  For the future I would change one thing.  The cayenne pepper.  It is nonexistent in the tiny amount the recipe states.  I think next time I make this I will increase it because it would be so good with the sunniness of the lime and the kick of cayenne.

Excellent summer dish when corn is in season.  (I live where fresh corn from the field is plentiful).  I also admire the simplicity of the dish.  Freshness and simplicity equals delicious in this recipe. Didn't and wouldn't change a thing!

We loved this salad.  I reduced the olive oil to 1/4 cup.  I used the juice of three limes and increased the garlic to about 4 medium cloves. One can of black beans was plenty for us. I charred my corn in a cast iron skillet before adding to the salad.   I did not use cilantro since I cannot tolerate the taste.  But the salad was very flavorful without it and came together with easy ingredients I had on hand.  There are just two of us, and we ate this salad for two and a half days and were fighting over it at the end.

Killer salad - new favorite! Reviews were spot on - best salad "won" @ the annual family picnic, and again the following week at another gathering - people had 2 and 3 helpings! 
No avacado, cherry tomatoes , red onion instead of green, didn't have cayenne so I used red pepper flakes. Dressing on the salad in am - serve @ noon. Try bundt pan corn stripping - works awesome!

Home from soccer practice and my grand-daughters were starving. This salad is a fabulous summer salad find; it went together quickly and they loved it.  The fresh, lime dressing is so delightful. I may try adding a little cooked pasta shells next time, as my youngest grand-daughter thought that would be great, too.

I absolutely love this dish! It's my all-time favorite from this site, and everyone I've made it for it has been floored. As other reviewers have said, make sure you use fresh lime! I use only one can of beans and add 1/2 a cup of quinoa. I tried it for the first time a month ago, and have already made it 3 times. I will be making this dish for the rest of my life!

Delicious as is.  I did not include the cilantro (because I was taking it to a pot luck).  I will when I make it for us next time.  It was very popular with all the guests.

I was asked to make a corn and bean salad for our Easter Picnic one year.  I had never made that salad and came across this recipe.  It was a hit.  Now it's a regular dish not only for the annual Easter Picnic but is a family favorite.

Delish, quick, and healthy. We substituted a red onion for green, because it was what we had on hand. So yummy. I also saved some of the unused dressing and used it for baguette sandwiches the next day. Both the salad and the dressing are keepers. Thank you for the great recipe!

Delicious salad and holds up pretty well! I did not add garlic and cut the oil down to 3 tablespoons. Perfect for my three day convention where I have to bring my own lunch. Added shredded lettuce on top because I love lettuce. Perfectly vegan! :-)

I've made this over and over and over, all variations depending on what I have on hand. I consistently use way less oil, and just add extra like juice. Keeps it low-cal and low-fat, and you can not even notice the oil is gone! Great dip!

I've made this salad twice and love it! I served it with bbq chicken and baked macaroni and cheese.The only adjustments I made were using 1/4 C olive oil to minimize the oiliness in the salad dressing and using halved grape tomatoes because I was short on time. Pretty dish when it is all together and tastes as good as it looks. My guests were impressed!

Really easy salad, but I thought it could have been stronger in flavor. Next time I might add a little jalapeño pepper to spice it up.

I would add lemon juice if you don't have lime juice. It's pretty good and really healthy. I love it.

I made this making a couple of changes.  I am sure the recipe would have been good as written though.  Changes were made based upon what I had on hand and personal taste.
I only used 1 large tomato.  I used Avocado oil rather than olive oil.  I cut back the red pepper and  added one small diced jalapeno.  I did not have any frozen corn so I used canned.  I did not have fresh garlic so I used 1/2 t of jarred minced garlic. I also did not have the full amount of cilantro. I added 1/8t Cumin & fresh black pepper as well. My green onions were quite large, so cut them down to 3 and used green parts as well. Some new cooks may not know that the green part is great and mild in flavor.  I would have liked more, but the overall recipe still turned out very tasty.  People should not be afraid to make a recipe their own.  Will make this again, I am sure.  Thanks for posting!

I generally follow every step of this recipe however, I was short on black beans so I used one can of black and one can of light red kidney. I also have used canned corn as well. I haven't changed any other ingredient. Great recipe!

Easy, fresh and perfect make ahead.  I switched to red bell pepper and omitted the cilantro.  We don't like green peppers and cilantro.

A yummy quick said dish, I wouldn't call it a salad though. Best when used with a firmer avocado and less olive oil. Another pinner recommended 1/4  cup.

We loved this. I did cut the olive oil down to just 1/8 cup and agree with another reviewer that you need to use fresh lime juice. I also zested the lime and added that to the salad. I also added 1/4 t of black pepper and a few shots of hot sauce. My 15 year old loved this and ate two helpings.

Way too much lime juice and olive oil which did not keep well at all. I would add more corn, eliminate the olive oil, half the lime, double the avocado. Overall, the ratios were just not to my liking.

Super super summery salad! Definitely cut back the olive oil by half! If you're someone who likes a lot of flavour and zip double the lime(add the zest too) and garlic. Chopped fresh jalepenos would make a nice addition to this salad. I would also recommend adding tomatoes and avocado before serving, to prevent mushiness. Or replace avocado with a cucumber . used fresh chives from my garden in place of green onions. So many options to make it your own. 
Topped mine with a sunnyside Egg for lunch. 
This will be my go to salad for BBQs this summer

I don't do measuring very well. I tend to just throw the ingredients in and adjust as I go. As a result I ended up with a very large bowl of this salad. The problem? It's only my daughter and I eating it! One taste though and I told my daughter she'd be lucky to get any! This is delicious!! And so healthy. Its a win/win!
I did reduce the oil to 1/4 cup as other reviewers advised just because we are trying to eat healthier. So yummy! An addition to our regular menu for sure!

Excellent salsa flavor and textures. The avocado adds a nice creaminess. I'm not sure if it really needs the olive oil. I really cut back on it. I accidentally bought kidney beans instead of black beans. It turned out great. Will try black beans next time.

This is really good! I've made it a couple of times now, and they have always turned out great. I reduce the oil by about half, which brings out the nice tanginess of the citrus. Great recipe!

Fresh, healthy, and tingles your palate!  If you do not like beans (like I do), this dish is for you because you will hardly notice it because of the other flavors and texture that are dancing in your mouth.   Great as a side to a burger, skirt steak, grilled chicken breast.  For vegetarian friends, I like to serve it with fresh hot toasted tortilla chips and shredded lettuce....instant salad!

I agree with others that it was too oily as the recipe stands. Next time I will reduce the amount of oil. Other than that I found this to be very tasty. I would like to try it with grilled corn but in a pinch the frozen worked just fine

I love the look and flavor of the dish.  I will increase the cayenne a bit next time for my own spice preference.  The salad tastes better at room temperature shortly after it is made.  The next day chilled was okay, but not quite the same.

So good! I didn't realize I didn't have an avocado but it was still great without it. I did find that there was a little too much dressing and it pooled at the bottom so I would be more careful how much I put in next time. I also love corn so I added an extra half cup. I find this keeps great in the fridge as a snack, it was super easy and fast to make and you can mess around with the portions of the ingredients. A fabulous recipe to add to the collection.

Wish I had read the reviews first. Less oil and real lime juice are what I'll do differently next time.  (I was trying to use up a plastic lime that we had for some reason and it tastes like "sour" or generic citrus instead of like lime.

I added quinoa (measure 1/2 to 1 cup uncooked, cook according to directions and add to the salad) and it's still too much oil. May make some more quinoa to absorb more of the oil.

Overall, I like this combo. What's not to like about lime, garlic, and olive oil!

I made this using things that I already have on hand. I substituted one can corn, 1/2 an onion, spiracha for the cayenne, refrigerated lime juice, and decreased the olive oil to 1/4 cup. I also added garlic salt to taste and used prepared cilantro in the tube from the produce section. It was delicious. I served it on salad with chicken, but it would also be fantastic with some cheese on some tortilla chips or by itself. I think I might try baking some chicken breasts with this on top. Definitely recommend. It was so easy and these are ingredients I always have. This will definitely be added into my meal rotation.

Not terrible, but I'm not a huge fan of it either. The dressing is too bland and the texture is a bit too mushy overall. It's very pretty though.

This has quickly become a year-round favorite—it’s great in the summer for a cool bbq appetizer and works well during the holidays as a side well. It’s a little different every time I make it but for the most part I stay fairly close to this modified version:

—zest of one medium lime
—juice of three medium limes
—4 cloves minced garlic
—1 tsp salt (or more to taste)
—1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper
—1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
—1 tsp honey
—1 can rinsed black beans
—1 bag thawed frozen roasted corn kernels (Trader Joe’s is my go-to)
—1-2 diced avocados (optional but a delicious addition)
—2-3 chopped bell peppers (usually red and yellow)
—6 green onions, thinly sliced
—3/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
—1 cup chopped grape/cherry tomatoes (optional as I tend to forget to add these by the time I’m done)

If there’s time, I like to refrigerate the salad for an hour or two so the flavors meld and then serve it closer to room-temperature.

If you add avocado, you should add at the very end, and barely stir in. If you mix it in with the other ingredients, its starts to smash, and turns the dish messy looking. I guess that's why there is no avocado in the picture. Otherwise, it's a good dish.

Some changes were made do individual tastes. However, on the whole this was a perfect accompaniment for Chef John's Spicy Spanish-Style Rice and my TexMex marinated sirloin pork chops.
Good recipe will definately be making again.

I love this salad. I have made it many times for us or to take to potlucks. When I take to a potluck, I keep the dressing in an air tight container. Also, I cut the avocado in half, take the pit out, dice  and leave the flesh in the avocado  skin, squeeze some lime over it and put the 2 avocado halves back together using plastic wrap. This  keeps the avocado from darkening. Last but not least,  if you're not one of those people who hate cilantro, don't skip it, it's important to the over all flavor of this salad.

Very tasty salad! I cut the amount of beans in 1/2, deseeded the tomatoes so it wouldn't be too watery and added less oil.

I've made this recipe now several times for my family. Fresh corn on the cob and cooked on the grill is best! I also use a small red onion diced instead of the green onions, as it holds the crunch better and tastes sweet and delicious. Cherry tomatoes halved also hold up better than a regular tomato. I always add 1 clove of garlic, minced, 1/2 tsp of salt, and 1/4 tsp pepper to the dressing. This recipe will stay fresh and delicious in the refrigerator for a few days as long as you keep the avocado and the dressing separate until serving. Serve with a tequila lime marinated chicken. It's the bomb!

This is a really solid side dish recipe when you are interested in something different, but not sure which direction you should go. The lime dressing has zip and is really refreshing. That one of the recipe's star ingredients are beans, a superfood, is a real plus. That the entire recipe is healthy makes it doubly good.

Really good even though I didn't have enough tomatoes or green bell pepper or kidney beans (just add an extra can of black). I added mango which was super scrumptious. This was easy. Next time we have a potluck at work, I'm definitely bring this!

Love this recipe! Have made it twice now and everyone loves it.  I added more salt than called for, and would also add more garlic next time.  I also added a pinch more cayenne and some ground cumin.  I agree that the oil could be cut back but I don't find it to be too much. Made it with and without the avocado -
I think the avocado is great if you don't plan to keep the leftover salad for the next day as it gets mushy.
It is great as a salad, but also love dipping tortilla chips in it...

Excellent recipe!  Other reviewers are correct.  Definitely use fresh limes.  I also added the zest of the limes and it really made the dish.  I also added diced cucumber for added crunch.

My family LOVES this salad! Most of the time I make it exactly as the recipe states - sometimes I have to use canned corn occasionally I double up on avocado because we love avocado. 
Been using this recipe for a few years now . Its colorful and has great flavors!

After making this salad several times, it is by far my family's favorite.  I personally could eat the whole thing myself!  The ingredients are light, fresh and complement each other so well.  I have made it with green and red onions, with and without cilantro and cayenne pepper, which have all been equally delicious.  No amendments are necessary, but can be easily tailored to taste preferences. Truly addicting!

Easy, delicious, and healthy. I've made several variations and various homemade dressings and each time they come out great. Highly recommend trying it. Great alone, with tortilla chips, or on a bed of lettuce.

So good. I reduced oil to 1/4 cup as others did as 1/2 cup did seem too much. Great side dish for fajitas or tacos; love the leftovers for lunch!

Very good as is, all I did was add a bit more cayenne, we like spice.  I omitted the avocado and added more corn. Only because we don't care for Avocados.

The whole family loved this, especially as a dip with tortilla chips.  Definitely use fresh lime juice, add some cumin, grill the corn, and cut the oil back to a 1/4 cup.  I didn't have a ripe avocado, but the salad was delicious without it.

I didn't use the avocado because the hubby doesn't like it. I used 1/4 cup of olive oil and it was perfect. Also used freshed limes for the juice. They're chowing down on it now as I type with organic que pasa tortilla chips! I also patted every veggie dry after I diced them up to reduce the moisture and keep it from turning mushy. LOVED IT!!!

I like a little more lime than olive oil an extra cayenne pepper, also added in cucumber and Serrano peppers for extra crunch and fire. One without avocado but so good with it!

This was a bit with the guest at our Christmas gathering.  I found it a bit spicy for me.   The avocados were delicious!  Next time I will try the real lime juice.  It makes a great salsa.  People were using it as as salsa and raving about it.

I also reduced the oil to 1/4 cup, increased the lime juice to 1/2 cup and added some ground cumin. I love the combination of lime, cilantro and cumin and have made a dressing (including honey) for coleslaw that I use to top fish tacos. When I made this salad I used two 14 oz cans of kernel corn, one 19 oz can of black beans. We were pleased with this ratio. Next time I think I will use 2 avocados. I also chopped one large tomato and substituted a large handful of grape tomatoes that I cut in half. I wanted to try red onion but could only get shallots and I added some sliced green onion stems for color. We really enjoyed the salad, the dressing had bold flavors but I felt like something was missing. Two cans of corn doubled the amount of corn called for but there was still enough dressing. Maybe next time I'll add some chili powder or maybe a squeeze of honey (although the sweetness of the corn might mean the honey would make it too sweet?)

Great fresh and healthy side. Quick and easy for a weeknight. The lime dressing is perfect, though I used about 1/4 cup of oil like others recommended.

Okay I have to admit I made this salad without the black beans because I didn't want to open a whole can just to experiment with a new recipe, but I actually came away pleased. In fact my recipe was way off as written (I know it bugs some of you when members rate recipes they've changed) but the good thing about this salad was I brought it for lunch as an experiment, and didn't head toward the vending machine in frustration that afternoon to indulge in a giant bag of Doritos. I will make this again and feel good about what I'm eating for lunch.

I love the simplicity and versatility of of this salad because you can substitute any vegetables for the ones listed above in the recipe as long as you have corn and beans in the mix! The cilantro adds a freshness that compliments this salad and not only is this recipe delicious!, but it is really healthy! Oh, but I don't use olive oil because I don't like the taste and there is way too much in this recipe. In fact, I don't use oil at all! After the flavours have time to sit and mingle, the salad has enough delicious flavour without the need for extra fat!

I love this  salad!  I've made it several times with no changes to the recipe.  This last time, though, I added more (fresh) corn to equal about the same amount as the black beans.  I think it makes it more colorful and takes good advantage of sweet summer corn.

Just made this recipe, and I ate way too much of it.   And, I didn't even have avocado on hand. The only thing I did differently was using 1/3 cup each of fresh lime juice and evoo.  And, I zested the lime just because I hate to waste the peel of citrus fruit.  This is now a favorite.

Loved It! Traded red onions for the green and sliced some cherry tomatoes - glad I did because the tomatoes held up under the stirring. Go easy on the salt until you taste-it needs some...but the beans and corn may have been salted in processing. Lessening the oil makes no difference in taste, but sure takes down the calories!

Loved it and will definitely make it again!  Took lots of tips from other reviewers such as upping the lime, cutting back on the oil as well as how much the dressing changes when sitting over night.  So, since I was making it just for me, I kept the dressing in a container and added as I ate it which kept the flavors bright and fresh. Also, one clove of garlic isn't enough and it could even use more cayenne.  Oh, and I also added the avocado as I went so it didn't get mushy.

Loved this...but far too much dressing.  I will reduce the amount of olive oil next time and it will be perfect. A great, fresh dish.

Made 1/2 recipe. This was really good! I loved the lime dressing. I had key lime juice so that's what I used. I didn't have black beans so I used white beans. I used leftover corn on the cob. No red pepper, I was out. And no cayenne, as my family doesn't like things too spicy.  This was good with corn chips and just as good eaten right off the spoon. It was even better the next day-and I added another 1/2 avocado and a squirt of lime juice.

Delicious.  I used the juice of one lime (easier than measuring out 1/3 cup and omitted the avocado since it wouldn't keep for long).

Simple and delicious. You can't make it ahead of time very effectively because the dressing separates some and a lot of liquid settles out. I need to think about the best way to handle that situation. Also, I prepared the avocado ahead and put lime on it so it didn't brown BUT I didn't add it until just before serving.

Wonderful!!  As other reviewers suggested, I cut the oil in half = good call.  In order to avoid any mushiness other reviewers mentioned, I rinsed the tomatoes after dicing to get rid of any extra juice, and I added the avocado within an hour of serving.  No mushiness (though I might just have been extra thorough and mushiness wouldn't have been a problem anyway)!  I also used half red pepper and half orange, just for the additional color.  Delicious!!  Brought to a baked potato bar dinner at friends and got rave reviews!

This was just OK for me.  It needs more 'punch', like more lime or spice perhaps.  I will probably make it again, but tweak the seasonings.

I don't measure when I cook, but I used all of the suggested ingredients except the green onions because I was serving it to 3-5 year olds in addition to adults.  Loved by all.  I did add the cilantro. I used fresh corn, approximately 6 ears, that I boiled for 1-2 minutes then rinsed with cold water and cut from the cob.  Wonderful for summer.  Very colorful.  I also used a pint of grape tomatoes that I sliced in half.

I made this salad for several events last summer and it was always a winner. It is colorful and looks beautiful on the table. I tried reducing the black beans to one can and it was even better. The lime juice and cilantro are essential to the great flavor.

This was sooo good.  I made it for dinner last night but it was eaten before it was on the table and I had to make a second batch.  I added rice to my bowl and that was my meal.  I did increase the lime and reduce the evoo as suggested by other reviewers.  Thanks for this keeper!

Super tasty! I split the recipe in half as it would have made too much for my small family. I decided not to add the bell peppers but instead added some chopped raw onions. Served as a side dish to spicy garlic lime chicken-went well together with all the lime juice.

I omitted the tomatoes because I don't care for them but otherwise prepared it as written and it was outstanding.  I was feeding 10 college students and they were dipping into it with tortilla chips before dinner even began.  Most used it as a relish to top chicken tacos, which I highly recommend.

This is SOOOOO yum!  Pure, unadulterated, flavorful, fresh vegetable heaven!  I have made this many times and love devouring it with tortilla chips.  It's very filling too.  Best when fresh, flavor tails off after a day or two.

I use fresh corn, sliced off the cob when it's in season.

I've made this several times, and it has always been awesome. I wouldn't fret too much about fresh lime juice or freshly peeled garlic... I used the lime juice that comes in bottle and minced onion that comes in a jar. I've also skipped the avocado a few times since it doesn't hold well in the fridge. In all cases, the salad has still been very tasty and unbelievably simple to make.

Excellent flavours.  I too cut back the olive oil to 1/4 cup and increased the lime juice.  I did use fresh juice, and the results were fantastic.  Will definitely make this again.

I've made this a few times, once exactly as printed and twice where I tweaked it for my tastes. I added red onion instead of green and used no oil. You don't need it. Why add the fat?

It is a great recipe. I did not use the hot sauce (my husband has allergy to it). Still  it came out very good. I recommend to go easy with the sugar.  It is very colorful. I chilled it over night. Will make it again.

Fantastic!  I omitted the red bell pepper and the cayenne pepper, and the taste was excellent!  First bite was a bit...tart or sour...hard to put into words.  But, second bite and beyond were great!  Next time I will serve immediately or else chop up fresh avocados each time I eat it because if any of it is leftover, the avocados start to turn brown.  Overall, excellent recipe!

Very tasty!  After trying this recipe a few times I cut the oil in half, omit tomatoes, double bell pepper, and add an extra half cup of corn.  You only need one medium lime to get enough juice.

Before I begin, I confess I did not use any olive oil. I was intending to put it in grilled burritos/wraps, so I figured the lime juice and other ingredients would be good enough without making it so runny that the wrap was messy.
That being said here is how I prepared it - slightly mashed the 2 cans of beans, let the corn thaw before mixing in, used 2 avocados and 2 red peppers (ONLY because those in my store were very small), 2 tomatoes, 6-7 green onions - and instead of adding cayenne I diced a jalepeno pepper. I did include the fresh cilantro, plus a bit of black pepper, salt, garlic powder and cumin (because we like those flavors) - but not very much, I probably could have used more.
So, there are a few differences, but if you compare, it is not too extreme. Anyway, after we had everything cut up evenly and mixed together I let it sit for no more than an hour while we did other things before I put some in a wheat tortilla with a bit of sour cream and cheese, then I grilled them on the stove. These are really, really good. It does seem a lot more like a 'salad' than any kind of wrap filling - I kind of want to just eat it plain or maybe with some chips - but it is really good when grilled, too. This recipe is awesome and I will be making many times. My previous black bean wrap filling is nothing in comparison!

Great salad. If you are using canned beans it helps to rinse it first. I used dry cilantro in the salad dressing instead of fresh.

We just had this on top of our fish tacos tonight.  I thought it was very good and a little different from our usual toppings (because I was out of them).  I used fresh lemon juice instead of lime, canned corn, and no red pepper - all because that is what I had.  I added some oregano and ground cumin to the dressing to give it a little more flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe.  It's very hot here and we love cold recipes!  I made this recipe twice in one week, one for a family gathering where all of the leftovers were taken home by others, then again for us.  I did not add cilantro (because it's the one thing I can't stand) and, the second time, I reduced the oil by 1/2 because I felt like it had too much juice (but it was great!).  Turned out, I actually missed the extra flavor of the olive oil, so the next time I make it, I will go back to the full amount.  The 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper did not keep my non-spicy eater from eating this.  I recommended this recipe to a friend who said she added her avocado later but mine held up well being added in at the beginning.  It did not become mushy.  Thanks for the recipe, Jen!

This salad was a huge hit, easy to make and exceptionally tasty.  The lime dressing was the kicker.  My guests asked me for the recipe.  Kudos!  I have had a lot of black bean salads but this one will surely go to the top of my list.  I'm not a pepper girl, so I omitted those.

If I could recommend just one recipe ever, it would be this one.  This salad is unbelievably delicious, I have made it many times and will make it many more.  I sometimes vary the quantities of the ingredients but it comes out perfect each time.  The cilantro and lime juice are key.  I eat it as a salad but have also used it as an accompaniment to nachos (like salsa).  Once I added it to chicken pieces and sour-cream in tortillas to make a burrito of sorts (used a slotted spoon to drain most of the liquids).  This salad is so, so good!

This is one of the BEST recipes I have ever had.  I don't use oil at all...I simply don't drain the tomatoes, (I use Rotel), I don't use salt at all. I use fresh lime juice and some Adobe. Fresh lime juice and cilantro makes the difference in this recipe. I hope all who try this enjoy the recipe. I enjoy it more the next day.

This stuff is so yummy! I crave it (and am actually craving it right now)! I don't mix the "dressing" separately but just add it all together. I use tons more lime juice, garlic, and cilantro.

Delicious.  You could use this in burritos or tacos or on top of lettuce.  I only used 1/2 the olive oil and it was very good.  Choose a FIRM avocado

It just didn't do it for me, and I followed the directions exactly as stated. After I finished making the salad and realized I REALLY didn't care for it, I added some honey which helped. I could see that this recipe would work as a salsa or a topping on a piece of chicken, but I make these type of dishes to be eaten as a meal with brown rice. The lime seasoning is just to much for this to be eaten as the main meal.

This is a great recipe. I love the vibrant colors and the flavors of this dish. I used only one (15 oz) can of black beans and reduced the olive oil to 1/3 cup and it still made a lot. I was a little concerned about leftovers but everyone ate it up.

This was a BIG hit at my New Years Day gathering with family.  Even those who say they don't like onions or cilantro went back for seconds.
Very fresh taste.  I have made this twice more since then.

This is an AMAZING salad. Perfect for vegetarians and was a big hit when i made it for my carnivore friends, as well! i used extra green onions (aka scallions), an extra tomato, half the amount of cayenne pepper, and just a sprinkling of cilantro. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Outstanding recipe.  Usually add a variety of beans, artichokes, hearts of palm, olives, etc.  The lime dressing really ties everything together nicely.  Sometimes I leave out avocado if I don't have a ripe one.  Can even add a little feta cheese, but it changes the overall taste.  My next adventure is to try it without oil and perhaps with spinach.

Everyone loved it!  I brought this dish to a potluck at work and the flavors paired beautifully together.  I didn't have enough limes to make 1/3 cup so it was probably more like 1/4 cup.  The garlic, cilantro, and green onions make this a tasty salad so don't forget to add them!

Love this! I have made this serveral times for parties and gatherings. It is always a hit. Always the first thing to disappear. I could make a meal out of it myself. I add more garlic and use purple onions instead of green. I also use less olive oil. I think you could leave it out altogether.

Made as indicated BUT found that the avocado 'mushed' so next time, I'll add it at the very last, and be sure it isn't overly ripe.I pre-chopped the tomatoes  and added at the end  so excess juice could be poured off. Mix the dressing in a jar so you can add as needed.

So good! A perfect and healthy side dish. We used the leftovers to make a tamale pie the next night by combing the bean salad with ground beef and topping with cornbread mixed with cheese. It was incredible! :)

Very good recipe.  Served as a side dish with another recipe from this site, Tex-Mex Burgers with Cajun Mayo.  Makes pretty much - more than the 6 servings listed on the recipe.

I like to add some potatoes (hash browns package) to add more carbs and really complement the saltiness.  Great vegetarian, super-balanced meal.

I took it to a family BBQ and it was a big hit! Out of preference I cut back on the cilantro, left out the bell pepper and green onions and added a bit of onion seasoning instead. I used lemon juice instead of lime juice because that's what I had and there were no complaints. My family scooped it up with Fritos. There were no leftovers!

Love this because you can use whatever you have on hand. I only used one can of beans but doubled the corn and avocado. I used just a couple tablespoons of finely minced red onion instead of green and garlic powder instead of fresh. Everyone loved it!

Holy Cow this is delicious! it is so healthy it is almost disgusting....  It is just loaded with fiber - black beans being the leader.  It also makes a good beef tortilla or chicken wrap.

This salad is excellent.   I use cherry tomatos and white corn.   I have served it with crab cakes, fish and as a topping on tacos.   On of the best I have ever made.

This was very good and a hit at the pool party that I took it to.  Used only 4 green onions, used less cilantro, and used a previous suggestion of increasing lime juice and reducing olive oil.  Will come to this again, and gain.  Delicious!

This was a lacking something, but I'm chalking it up to the fact that I forgot to buy cilantro or avocado. I also felt there was way too much dressing as the stuff at the bottom of the bowl was drowning in it. I wasn't pleased with my results, but I give this 4 stars for potential. I used frozen corn, but fresh corn would have better flavor. I also added a 4 oz. can of diced green chilies for zing, but they were mushy and got lost in the salad. Fresh seeded and chopped jalapeño would really make a difference. Adding some red onion and cumin would add a nice flavor too. The recipe says cilantro is optional, but I don't suggest leaving it out!

Completely love it. I didn't have green onions (I don't miss it), and I did adjust the lime/olive oil ratio by doing equal parts of both, doing a shake with the spices and taste, then added the juice of one more lime. Totally amazing flavors - I will definitely make this again in hot summers when you don't want to heat up your kitchen.  It's a great salad definitely, but also great on chips (though you need a strong chip), in tacos and burritos.

I made exactly (well almost, used lime juice).  I had my family for dinner and lets say that is not an easy task!  This is gluten free and dairy free.  It was totally awesome, we all really enjoyed it and will enjoy it in the years to come....

I added more garlic to the dressing and some pepper to taste. The less ripe the avocado the better since it will get smushed with the rest of the ingredients.

I added a few extras; yellow & green bells, white beans, red onion instead of green, and store bought italian dressing instead of making my own.  Colorful and healthy.  Great go-to salad for picnics and gatherings.

This salad went over really well at a party I brought it to, and will now be one of my go to dishes, especially in the summer. My boyfriend who usually doesn't opt for healthy foods absolutely loves it. I changed a few things though. For 12 servings, I used 3 avocado, 4 green onion, 3/4 cup oil, 2 cans of white corn-drained, and only about 2 tbs of cilantro. I also added a bit of sugar to the dressing (I used 2 packets of Truvia).

I made this for a pot luck lunch and work and everyone loved it!  Very simple to make and a great summertime dish.  I am usually not a a fan of cilantro, but this had just the right amount to not be overpowering...it wouldn't taste the same without it.  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

Not too bad.  I personally didn't care for this salad but I made it for a BBQ and most people enjoyed it.  The dressing definitely had a great taste to it, just be sure to use fresh lime juice!

This was absolutely delicious!! The only thing I did differently was I thawed and dried the corn and roasted it in a nonstick pan for a few minutes before adding it to the salad.  Eat it as is, with chips, or on a taco salad!

I have made this salad countless times for potlucks, parties and home dinners. It is such a flavorful salad, and it is definitely my favorite. It is so good that EVEN my husband loves it and he can't stand beans! The only think that I do differently is add an additional clove of garlic and some chopped jalapeno for some extra heat. I have not tried increasing the amount of lime juice; however, I think I am going to do that today as I can see how it would add some extra zest!

I cut back on the salt and added 2 tsp of sugar to the dressing recipe.  It made it not quite so tangy, which I liked.  I also opted to use the frozen yellow and white corn which made a nice contrast in color and texture.

Made this for dinner last night, although it had a great flavor and my family loved it, I thought it was missing something. I left out the cilantro, I hate it. Maybe next time I'll use chopped jalapeno.

My husband loved this. A very versatile salad/side dish. I omit cilantro because I am not a fan, and may use less olive oil next time.**UPDATED** Made for the second time with less olive oil and added chili powder. Liked it even better... but think it still needs slightly more lime juice

Made this as a side item to Fiery Fish tacos and it was a hit for everyone at the table.  The dressing  was really tasty.  We couldn't stop raving.  Love the idea to add pasta, may do that this summer for a quick meal.

So delicious! Everyone really enjoyed this. I reversed the oil & lime amounts and added a touch of cumin to the dressing. It's great served with Peruvian Baked Quinoa & Cheese from vegetariantimes.com, they really compliment each other.

EXCELLENT FLAVOR! Thank you so much for this recipe. There was an extra step I did that I think makes a difference in salsa. I cut up the tomato, put it in a bowl, salted it, and let it sit for a few hours to draw out the extra liquid. Then I went ahead and followed the recipe. Awesome, especially after it sits overnight.

This is absolutely amazing!  My husband called it a "taste powerhouse."  I did crumble a couple of strips of bacon leftover from breakfast into it, and since I didn't have fresh cilantro, I added dried cilantro into the dressing!  This is a keeper!!!!!

Great recipe I added a 1/2 tsp of Cayenne for more kick and a 1/4 tsp of cumin for a more southwest feel. Good as is though if you like it milder

DELICIOUS!  A lovely salad to just sit and eat!  We enjoy eating it with pita.  Our family doubled the spices and lime juice but that is pretty normal for us, we are big on SPICY!

This was really good!!  We had it with quesadillas and they were delicious with a big scoop of this salad on top.  It's also great as a salsa. Definitely a recipe I'll make a lot, especially for summer BBQs.

I loved the clean taste.   As others suggested used less oil and more lime.   I also used dried black beans which I soaked and cooked.

This was a good salad.  I also reduced the amount of olive oil, and I only used half the cilantro, but added parsley to make up for it.  I think we'll use the leftovers over grilled chicken tonight, I'm sure it will go nicely.

This salad was excellent, high in fiber and so healthy that I'll continue to make it!  To make it more WW friendly, I did cut the oil down to 1/8 cup and increased the lime to 1/2 cup, left out the avocado because I don't like it.  I'm sure the avocado would have been great for those that like it but it's my salad and I'm eating it!  Try this one!  :)

This salad is SO good!  I added a bit more lime juice, but other than that it was great.  I made it for a BBQ and doubled the recipe and it was still fantastic.  I made it a few hours in advance and still tasted great. I received many compliments and requests for the recipe! Easy and delicious!!

This is an awsome recipe!  Everytime I make it I find new uses for it.  It is great alone or as a topping for other dishes.  It is best when used fresh becasue the avocado will discolor.  It makes a very large serving so don't double it for parties!  I usually cut it in half if it is only for our family.

This was really delicious.  I found several recipes on this site that were all very similar so I took the pieces I liked from those and modified this recipe slightly. I used one full bag of frozen corn, only 1 can of black beans, half the oil suggested, used the juice from 3 limes and added in 1 teaspoon of sugar. Use red onion instead of green since that's what I had.  I really enjoy how fresh and tangy this is. And I love the addition of the avocado for a creamy extra touch.

I loved this dip/salad. I've made it 3 times in the last 3 weeks. I omitted the onions and peppers but added fresh mango and it tasted so fresh and healthy...Perfect for summer! I even made it camping and everyone on our annual family campout raved about the dip and wanted the recipe.  Thanks!

This is a fabulous and versatile recipe and has never failed to be a hit. It is also a nutritional heavy-weight! I find that the measurements of any ingredient can be adjusted to your tastes and the salad will still turn out great. I usually wing it and probably make it differently every time, mostly working with  whatever I have on-hand at a given moment. For example, you could substitute a few drops of hot sauce for the cayenne pepper and I almost always use 2 avacados instead of one, because I like the taste/look. I only ever drizzle a bit of olive oil on the salad, finding that there is no reason to add any more than that, so you could lighten the salad up that way, if you wished, without compromising taste. Not only does this salad taste great, but it looks beautiful as well. There are so many colors represented in it, making it really very visually pleasing as well. I would highly recommend this recipe and have shared it with several family members and friends!

One of my favorite salads! I don't eat much meat and this is a main dish for me. I make just as is...have used canola oil instead of olive and like it just fine.

This is the yummiest salad ever!  I only put in 2 tablespoons of oil and use a can of corn instead of frozen.  I also put in 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper and 1/4 teaspoon paprika to make it a bit spicier.  For a truly colorful salad, use a green pepper instead of red since the tomatoes are already red.  The avocado is a wonderful addition, but many times I don't have one on hand, and the salad is equally as tasty.  It is also good with a bit of red onion or no onion at all because it already has so many flavors.  I practically have the recipe memorized because I make it so often!  I make sure to stock up on all the ingredients when I go grocery shopping so that I can make it whenever I want to.  Thanks for sharing Jen!

This is a pretty good salad and sometimes I will add some chicken if I want meat with it.  I personally like it without anything added better.  Sometimes I chop the ingredients up small and serve with my tacos or as a dip too when we are in the mood for something different as a snack.

This was great!!! I added a little chili powder and cumin to the dressing, and diced colby jack cheese and avocado to the salad. Also I think a couple of cups of cooked rice or barley would be great and make it into more of a main dish.

I loved this!  It has a great mix of flavors--the mildness of the corn, beans, and avocado gets plenty of zing from the crunchiness of the bell pepper, the fresh citrus flavor of cilantro and lime, and the kick of cayenne, garlic, and onion.  I liked it so much I ate the leftovers the next morning, the first time I've ever had bell peppers, onion and garlic for breakfast.

This is very good, even without the bell pepper. The lime juice dressing does a lot to make this a delicious salad. I used finely diced jalepenos instead of the cayenne pepper. The avacado was also great in it.

At the last minute on Memorial Day I was looking for another salad for our cookout and this was on the homepage, after a quick review my sister and I thought it look good and it was so good we don't have a picture to post, b/c it was all gone! Our family loved it. Did not use all the olive oil as many previously suggested, added an extra avocado and didn't have fresh lime juice, just used what little I had in the the fake lime, and I used 2 cans of corn instead of the frozen. Everybody at the cookout wants this recipe.

Love this and make it a few times a year. Refreshingly different and I do let it marinate a while.

This was very good!  I cut the recipe in half, left out cilantro (we don't like it) and didn't have green onions.  I also used equal amounts of oil/lime juice.  Very nice flavour, I added a couple shakes of chipotle chili powder for some extra smoky flavour!  Also used the tip about the avocado pit from another reviewer...leave it in the salad to keep the avocado chunks from turning brown!  This went nicely with our baked tilapia done with a butter/lemon juice and guacomole seasoing mix, yummy!

I made this dish for a wine party a few weeks ago and it received rave reviews! My guests loved the flavors infused in this dish. It was very quick and flavorful...I'm adding this to my summer line up.

A wonderful salad, full of flavour and beautiful to look at. I ate it with hard boiled egg wedges for extra protein and whole wheat tortillas, and my husband had it with Adobo Sirloin (from this site) and both of us really enjoyed it. Thanks so much!

This was very good.  So easy to put together.  I think it tasted better the next day. But, after marinating overnight, the tomatoes and avocado looked kind of funky.  Also, next time I'll add another avocado.

I am requested to make this at every party, BBQ, birthday, etc.  I don't measure the veggies.  I probably add more corn that mentioned.  I mix everything and let it sit for a few hours before serving, adding the avocado & cilantro right at the end so it tastes fresh.  This is seriously good.  I have also used it on tacos, and I grilled chicken.

This recipe is excellent.  The only change I made was used the juice from one lime instead of a 1/4 cup and canned corn instead of frozen.  My entire family enjoyed this dish including my 13 year old son who doesn't eat vegetables.

love the flavors!  great to make in the winter when you can't wait for spring.  I did make a minor change, I put a little bit of the oil, c.pepper and threw in a dash of chili powder in a pan with the frozen corn first to give it some extra flavor and sort of roast it to defrost it.  Making this one again and again!

Only had one can of black beans but still turned out great!! *update* Passed this recipe on to my mom who had a dinner party for 15 last night, she made it the night before (added avocados right before serving) and doubled the recipe. She said it was a huge hit at her party, easy to make ahead and very colourful for the table. Letting it sit overnight in the fridge really let the veggies absorb all the flavors of the dressing.

Very pretty salad, but wasn't really very tasty in my opinion. Our guests said they really liked it, but I thought it was way too limey. Might have been my fault because I used artificial lime juice. Next time I might do similar ingredients, but a more vinegar based dressing. Sorry, but I just didn't care for the lime flavor.

Awesome and quick salad! Will definitely make again. Made for the first time for our July 4th bbq at the last minute and it was a smash hit with my friends and family, most of whom are VERY picky and do not care for Tex-Mex style foods. I followed the recipe to a T and could barely taste the cayenne pepper.. next time, I will add more, but it was still delish the next day. Our guests ate alone  and with lime tostitos chips!!!

I really LOVE this recipe.  I usually skip the green onions, but that's because I never remember to buy them.  The flavors are amazing in this salad and it gets rave reviews where ever it goes.  Give it a try, you will not be sorry.

I absolutely love this recipe! The only thing I do different is that I add in equal parts of corn and beans & add in sliced black olives. Could definitely add in leftover chopped grilled chicken or steak for an all-in-one meal! Thanks for a great recipe!

I've made this salad many times since I first found it on allrecipes, and I've never, ever gotten tired of it. It's always a big hit at parties, and I recently served it to 150+ people at my backyard wedding reception. Hearty, savory and zesty!

This recipe is great as a starting point, but it definitely needed more lime and garlic as someone else noted.  I too substituted-  white onion for green.  For my purposes, I tossed it with cubed grilled chicken and used the salad as a topping for a dinner salad.  Big Hit!!!

Sorry we just didn't care for this one. I think the Spicy Bean Salsa from this site is a much better bean dip and suits our taste better.

This was quite yummy! I did decrease the oil a little, added a green pepper, used the whole bag of corn, and used half of a red onion in place of the green. I had two limes but they didn't produce enough juice so I added a little zest.  On the back of the can of black beans there was a similar recipe and it called for red wine vinegar.  I thought the dressing needed a little more tang so I added a few splashes.  Next time I think I will add a jalapeno.  Also, try to make this the same day you are serving it.  I made the salad the night before (except for the avocado) and I thought the flavors melded too much.  It was a lot fresher tasting right when I made it.

Wonderful dish!  I made this for a Memorial weekend party and everyone loved it!  I got so many requests for the recipe!  I added one more avacado, and added a 1/4 cup of italian dressing and it was great.  I will make this again for sure!

This is so darn good.  I did what the some of reviewers said and cut down the oil to 1/3 cup, but other than that, I made it to the letter.  Love it, thanks.

This is one of our all-time favorite recipes - sooooo good with fresh summer produce. I look forward to the farmer's market every year so I can make this (it's wonderful with roasted sweet corn). Also a hit at parties - if you don't eat the whole batch yourself! (which I did the first time I made this) We often add a jalapeno to the dressing (instead of cayenne), and lots of cilantro really makes it! Also, there's more oil called for than needed - we just do a couple splashes, which keeps the fat content down. So healthy and yummy! My favorite thing is that I can do it from memory, and sometimes if your memory isn't exact & you modify it, it turns out just as good or better.

Such a flavorful and healthy salad! To the dressing I added red wine vinegar and white wine vinegar to make it more tangy.  I also added lime zest and a green bell pepper. The fresh cilantro is a necessity when making this because it just adds a whole other element and flavor. Overall,  really enjoyed eating this!

I'm addicted!  The changes I made are to reduce the amount of oil to 1/4 - 1/3 cup....I thought 1/2 cup was too much. I also left out the onions(personal preference) and added some sunflower seeds for a little additional crunch. What a fantastic summery taste!!

This salad is a staple for summer picnics and family gatherings.  It can also be used as a fresh salsa. I usually cut the olive oil to 1/3 cup and the difference is unnoticeable.  The lime and cilantro make a very fresh-tasting salad.

Awesome!!!!! It's nearly addictive. I made it just like the recipe and I wouldn't change a thing. I think it's better after refrigerating a few hours as the flavors penetrate the beans and veggies. I also stirred the avocados in last to avoid smashing them.

This was one of the best bean salads I've ever had!  I used cilantro, dropped the green onions, and added a dash of adobo. Yum:-)Thanks Jen!

I have made this numerous times- is a very easy recipe to double or triple, and you can play around with the amounts of ingredients to tailor it to your tastes. I add extra cilantro and avacado myself. My only complaint is it tends to get 'soupy' on the bottom, but I like it just as much the next day. I made it for my sons graduation party- holds up well- I kept extra in the fridge and kept replentishing it as it ran low.

Delicious!  Very light and fresh tasting.  I read other reviews and decided to wait to put the avocado in and after tasting how yummy it was, I never got around to putting it in!  I am making it again tonight - maybe I will try it with the avocado.  Thanks!

This was really really good and everyone loved it.  I wasn't able to add the avacado because it wasn't ripe enough and I was missing the bell pepper because they didn't look so good at the store.  Reguardless, it was wonderful and I'll be making it again soon :)

I really liked this recipe and found a great way to cheat! I found Hanover Latino Recipe frozen veggie blend with corn, black beans, diced red & green peppers and onions. I used 2 bags, thawed under tap water. Used the vinegrette as written, but I threw it all into a mini processor with cilantro and the garlic. Used 3 green onions. Very good and minimal chopping!

Very good,,, I could live off this stuff!!! I added some extra cilantro to give it that extra kick.  I also used green onion AND red onions to give it a bit of variety. The purple color of the red onion definitely makes the dish extra colorful.

I cannot tell you how many times I have been asked for the recipe!  Definitely a staple.  Some suggestions for making it even better though - 1. Use 1/2 white beans instead of all black beans 2. Use an orange pepper to really make it colorful 3. Roast the garlic first for an  additional flavor kick 4. Chop everything uniformly to about the size of a bean or corn kernel.  You'll love it!

Really like this recipe.  It makes for a great side when you are serving Mexican food because it is lighter than most traditional Mexican dishes.  I served the avocados on top of each individual portion instead of mixing it inside - that way you can refrigerate leftovers and enjoy the following day - just cut another fresh avocado!

This is a great healthy recipe! Instead of using 2 cans of black beans I used one can of black beans and one can of garbonzo beans. I also used a drained can of corn instead of frozen corn. It's easy to make, really tastey, and very healthy! I put the salad ontop of 2 corn tortillas and served as a taco type dish. Would be excellent with some sort of grilled chicken.

I liked this - very healthy alternative for a covered dish than most things that are brought. I'm not accustomed to avocados, so I ended up tossing that part...just didn't seem like it would hold up that well. Very colorful and tasty - followed others' input and cut back on the olive oil, increased lime juice, cayenne and added cumin and a couple of diced jalapeno peppers. Realized why it tasted familiar - I make a Texas Caviar recipe very similar to this (uses Italian dressing rather than the lime juice/olive oil mix) and serve it as a dip.

Great salad! Whole family  (including 3 young children) loves this! I can't get enough - the lime dressing is fantastic with all the flavors. The only thing I do is keep the avacado separate, and serve it to people on top of their salad - so that salad keeps nicely in fridge.

This was bland.  You can't really taste the cayenne at all.  I added an extra clove of garlic and that still didn't help much.  I even put in the cilantro.  It was still bland.  I won't make this again.

husbands reply: The best thing you made lately! I did one can of beans and 3/4 can of corn, 1/4 c of canned diced tomatoes. Turned the avacado into guacamole, I took the tip from another reviewer and added cumin and chili powder. I toasted tortilla shells and served it with yellow rice made a nice vegetarian burrito. Only the two of us ate it, we were able to have it two days made a good amount and was deliciou

This is absolutely fabulous!  I added a little bit of sugar to give it some extra magic, though it's not  necessary.

Very good. I will make this again....only thing is that the olive oil was a little strong. I used EVOO, not regular olive oil. Next time I'll try the regular olive oil and see if that tones it diwn.

Very colourful and attractive salad. We forgot to add the cilantro and found it bland - will definitely not forget to do that next time. The texture is nice and the feel is fresh. Not dying to make it again, but it is good for summer time.

We love this as is.  I have used the following modifications and we like it better with the changes.  I use 1/3 c. oil and 1/3 c. lime juice, just to cut back on the oiliness.  I prefer red onions to the green, and then add feta (cotija might be good to)  This is a great dish-everyone loves it.  It's great with chips as a dip or as a salad with grilled steak or chicken or fajitas.  Perfect summer food!

I made this recipe for a pot luck recently.  I wanted something that would be "different".  I followed the recipe exactly...perfect!  EVERYONE asked for this recipe.  The salad was so delicious that I thought about not taking it so I could eat it all LOL!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This one is a sure keeper!  OUTSTANDING flavor.  I took advice of others and used red onion instead of green, and added 1/8 tsp cumin and 1 tsp sugar to the dressing.  I'll use this recipe this summer as a glorified salsa! It was great with tortilla chips!

Maybe I was expecting too much because of all the outstanding reviews.  This was good but I served it at a party and didn't get any rave reviews.  I think if I made it again I would increase cayene and add the optional cilantro.  It didn't have enough flavor for me.

Made this last night to go with some chicken breast that I marinated in a southwest seasoning and then grilled. The only change I made was I added 1/2 each of red & green peper and used red onion instead of green. Just loved the salad! I left in fridg. for my hubsband to have when he came home from work at midnight. There was note on counter this morning that he thought it was excellent! He doesn't say that often. I also brought to work today and ate with some Pepper Jack Dorito's, it was delicious that way. 
Thanks for posting this recipe.

This is one of my favorite recipes to bring to a bbq or party.  Everyone loves it and always asks for the recipe.  I do however add red onion instead of green and up the lime juice to 1/2 cup because I love the zinginess of it!

You can't go wrong with this recipe!

This was good.  It is more like a dip or a salsa -- and it could use some jalapeno -- but it was good.

Really yummy!  I made this as a side dish to go with tacos, and our whole family loved it.  Even my 5 and 3 year old thought it was great.  I did omit the avocado- personal preference- and just added some extra corn instead.  Also, I didn't have any cilantro, so I used the parsley that I had on hand.  I'm sure this would be great with the cilantro too.  I love that this doesn't need to sit before you serve it, but the leftovers which I ate the next day were excellent as well. I'll definitely make this again as a healthy, interesting mexican side dish.

It's not the worst thing I've ever had, but I was definitely disappointed in the money, time, and energy I put into it. Something about it just didn't mix well. Even after coming back to it later, I wasn't impressed. It has all my favorite things in it! It sounded great when I read the recipe, and it looked beautiful, but I found myself trying to fix the flavors. I finally gave up.

This was so easy to make and so delicious. I made the dressing first, then the salad, put it in the fridge and waited until it was ready to be served before I mixed everything together and added the avocado. I served it with enchiladas and spanish rice. Definitely 5 stars for this one!

I make this for every pot luck or party and there is never any left.  It is such a great garnish for chicken or as a dip with chips.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

yum, yum, yum, I just finished eating this for lunch (leftovers from last night's dinner) and it is definitely my favourite salad.  Sometimes I leave out the tomatoes and avocado and add more corn and bell pepper (love the crunchiness) but either way, it's always delicious and healthy.

This is so incredibly tasty.  Great on its own, tossed with lettuce, served like a dip with tortilla chips.  One fun way to serve it is tossed with mixed greens with tortilla chips crumbled on top instead of croutons.  Flavor definitely develops if you let it sit for a bit, and the fresh lime seems to keep the avocado from coloring too much.  I've used fresh and frozen corn--great either way.

I love everything in this salad so I liked it but to my preference it was missing something. Maybe little stronger flavor of dressing or more spices. But overall very healthy and easy to make.

Amazing recipe!

We added cumin and feta cheese, and we think it worked even better.

I had been searching for this recipe for years!! I made this for a church potluck and had to fight my family away from it before we got to church! This is the easiest to throw together last minute and is so yummy and healthy tasting, that I never have leftovers. I also love that I can serve it to all of my vegetarian friends and/or restricted diet family members and know that it's good for them. Definately a keeper!!!

EXCELLENT!!  I made this exactly how the recipe stated and it turned out great!  It does make a lot, but it'll definitely get eaten.  This is great plain, or I put it in a pita for a full lunch.

This was a great recipe that I used as a side dish. It works well either as a side salad to a Mexican meal or as a dip for nachos!

I followed the recipe completely, but the only things I would do to this recipe is lower the oil content to 1/3 cup, reduce the lime by just a little, and add a bit more cayenne (if you like things a little spicier). Oh, and if you want, you can add more avocado. 

Other than that, this dish was great.

Excellent salad!  Quick and easy to make.  I'm always looking for new and interesting recipes to get my family to eat veggies and this is a good one for that.  It makes a great side dish but can stand on its own for a healthy lunch.

I love this recipe - it has become my new potluck dish. It has a problem sometimes with getting too runny. I sometimes serve it without the dressing. I recommend keeping it cold until you serve it - if it gets warm the frozen corn melts and you get extra water that you don't need. Other than that, it is excellent. It has great flavor and is very colorful.

I love this recipe! So easy and delish! We serve it like salsa and eat it with baked tostitos, instead of as a salad. You have to make sure you rinse those black beans very well or it gets mushy. yum!!!

I made this with a bag of Trader Joe's roasted corn (based on the reviews, thanks! this gave it great flavor!) and a can of chickpeas. I also crushed up garlic pita chips and sprinkled them on top of the salad. Fantastic!

I chose a veggie lifestyle about 8 months ago.  No problems adhering to the change, but food selections have been rather limited since I'm lost when it comes to cooking.  This recipe was not only delicious, but so easy to make.  I did take the suggestion of another reviewer and added a little more avocado. PERFECT!  Thanks Jen.

This is just delightful!!! So pretty and fresh! I used Trader Joe's roasted corn and doubled the amount but changed nothing else and it was delicious! Next time I will add more pepper or hot sauce because I like spicy. Took it to a pot luck and returned with an empty dish! This is good stuff!

Great great recipes. Very delightful and and refreshing, especially for the summer, and easy to make. The 1/2 cup oil seemed a bit high when I made it, but in retrospect, it would be just fine because you're making a ton of salad. The serving size I felt was closer to 8 servings than 4-6. I also added a tiny bit of fresh black peppers just to round out everything. I love this salad -great as meal when served with bread or side dish with corn chips.

This recipe was an instant favorite in our house - and it was so quick to make!  I made it as a side dish for my husband and I, so we had a lot left over.  The next day we mixed in some cheese, rolled it in some flour tortillas, heated it up and topped it with sour cream.  Really good!  I modified the original recipe because I only had sweet banana peppers on hand, and I don't like a ton of green onion, so I only used two.  Next time I will add the cilantro.

Terrific. I made this for quite a large party and received many compliments. I made the dressing and the salad the day before separatly and mixed it the day of the party. It does make alot so if you are making this for a few people scale it or at least cut the recipe in half.

This was awesome.  Very very tasty, the lime was really good.  The only thing I'd do next time is put half the amount of beans and add another avocado.

This is excellent.  Light and refreshing for summer, too.  I changed the lime juice amt to be lemon and lime juice and lowered the amount of olive oil called for and I since I didn't have 2 cans of black beans I used one can of black beans and one can of great nothern beans.  Not only does it taste great the colors are a great combination!

This is a staple in our household.  We serve it as a salsa rather than a salad.  Tortilla chips complement it well.  The only thing I have difficulty with is the avacado.  It breaks down in the refrigerator and becomes mushy, so if I think we are going to have leftovers, I leave the avacado out. Other than that, this receipe is sublime!

This was a hit at a recent dinner party!  We were serving light summer fare and this fit the bill!  Tangy and delicious--goes great with veggie burgers!

I found the lime slightly overpowering, so the second time I made it I added a half teaspoon of honey to the dressing.  This definitely toned down the sour and made the dressing much more balanced.

We also don't like peppers in our house, so we added a second avocado as a substitute.  Yummy!

This recipe was extactly as it should be, fresh and flavorful.  I alternated slightly by only using one can of black beans, sweet onion instead of green and my favorite hot sauce b/c I did not have ground cayenne.  I'm already looking forward to the next time I prepare this dish!

We made a double recipe of this (with half of the oil as suggested by others)for my father-in-law's 70th birthday party. I cooked the beans from scratch and used cherry tomatoes instead of chopped tomatoes to prevent too much liquid. We also added the avocado just before serving, and served with tortilla chips. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. It's a great "potluck" recipe.

Delicious!  The only thing I changed was that I used 1/4 cup of fresh lime and 1/8 cup of fresh lemon and I soaked the avacados for a minute in the dressing before adding to the rest of the mixture (they stay greener that way)  I also doubled the avacado because I had  to use them before I had one go bad and I really love avacados---but really, you don't need to change a thing on this recipe---What a great staple!

This is a fabulous salad!  I made it this morning and I've devoured about 1/2 of the bowl!  I used lemon juice instead of lime, cut the oil in half, and mixed 1/2 black beans and 1/2 black-eyed peas.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is terrific. I used 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, added more garlic, and when I had finished, I mixed some of the salad with a little fat-free plain yogurt and put it in burritos. This is worth a try! Gives it a smooth, creamy taste without drowning anything out.

Wonderful salad!!  I wouldn't omit anything.  The only thing I wish I would have done is add fresh jalapenos.  We like our food spicy.  If your not into spicy food leave this as is.  The next day I added it to my eggs and then tonight we plan on adding it to our pork chops.  It can go without just about anything.  Great Summer salad!

This was absolutely the best recipe. Only I call it black bean and corn salsa, and eat it with tortilla chips. I just added the juice from 2 limes, and then some tabasco and cayenne pepper/chili powder for some kick. Oh, and try adding a little cumin too for some extra flair. Everyone just LOVED it. Thanks.

I thought this was great.  I didn't use as much oil as it called for,it seemed like to much. Next time I will use more lime juice and maybe a little jalapeno to give it some more spice.  This is definatley a keeper!  Thank you!

This always gets great reviews when i make it.  I recommend halfing the oil- I agree that the recipe calls for too much.  Also, if you are making this ahead of time for a party, dont add the avacadoes until the day-of.  I learned this the hard way- even though there is alot of citrus juice in the salad, it apparently isnt enough to keep the avacado from browning a little bit on day 2 of the salad.

This recipe was tasty. I liked it best the same day I made it. I like the suggestion as using it as a salsa, either way it was good. I left out Cayenne Pepper and just used black.  Very quick prep.

WOW! Gone waaaaay to fast. Guests thought it was the best part of the meal! I made it without scallions (by accident) but it still turned out well. Don't cut the tomatoes to smal, it makes the salad soggy.

This was very good.  Can be used as a salad or a main dish.  for those of you who need meat with a meal, grilled chicken would be nice added to it.  I also swapped the lime juice and the oil.  Great for a summer dinner!

You won't be disappointed with this recipe! Wow! I left out the red pepper because of personal taste, but kept everything else. I took the spice advice and added cumin and oregano, and also doubled (at least) the salt, fresh garlic, and cayenne pepper. It gave it a very tasty kick!

This is one of my favorite salad's. I've made it numerous times for family, friends, parties, potlucks, everyone loves it! It's really healthy and has a great flavor. I always add extra garlic. The last time I served it over grilled portobello mushroom tacos.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It made a large amount and I used it over several days.  The flavors are great and it tasted just as yummy the first day as it did the third.

I only used about half the olive oil, but it was very good and everyone liked it - I served it as a "dip" with chips. If you want it even lower in fat, I don't think you'd miss the oil at all if you just left it out.

A terrific 'salsa', a little to chunky for a salad. I served it to a group of friends who came over for dinner and they all ate it with chips. Got rave reviews, but only as a dip.

This salad is sensational! Add a little more lime and a bit more cayanne for extra kick! Terrific as a side dish or with chips as a chunky salsa.

This was very good.  I left out the avocado because I don't care for it.  For the best flavor, I recommend refrigerating this for an hour before serving.

Awesome recipe! Since my family doesn't like chunky tomatoes I puree them for this salad and they like it much better. I also cut the olive oil down to 1/4 cup and that works very well. Thanks Jen, for this great recipe!

This was fabulous.  I've tried other five star recipes and was disappointed by most.  But not by this one.  I mixed in some cooked couscous to absorb the excess dressing and it was great.  Thanks.

This was such a fantastic summer recipe.  No cooking required, and it's so refreshing on a hot summer day.  Perfect with grilled fajitas or just as a meal by itself.  Leftovers are scrumptious.

This was a great tasting salad--the flavors blended together very well.  I think it works better as a thick salsa rather than a salad, however.  Just my preference! :-)

Good staple side salad, but could use a little less liquid and a little more flavor--I added cumin and extra salt, and a little extra cayenne.  A good addition to the repertoire, though.

This is my new favorite salad!  I made it for Mother's Day and it was a huge hit.  I don't like cilantro so I omitted it, and the avacadoes in the store weren't any good, so I omitted those.  I used 3/4 tsp. salt per other reviews, and it could use the whole 1 tsp.  The salad was even better the next day, which wouldn't be the case if it had avacado in it.  We imagined eating it with a hearty corn chip as a salsa, or topping over green salad, but it was great just spooned out of the bowl too!  It was so easy, and so flavorful as well as nutritious.

This takes time but is quite tasty.  I left out most of the oil to reduce the fat.  The avocado was good but next time I may leave it out also to further reduce the fat.  Overall it was just what I was craving.  Thanks!

This was quite easy and tasty.  It blends all kinds of flavors; the lime and olive oil blend is really tasty.  I left out avocado and it was still excellent.  However, there seemed to be a bit too much dressing, making it a bit mushy and runny.  Other than that, a very good recipe that I plan to make again.

This recipe tastes like summer!!!  I think you could eat this salad in the dead of winter and feel as though it were July after just one bite.  YUM!!!  Do yourself a favor and try this!  I made a few modifications:  I decreased the olive oil to 1/6 cup and added 1/6 cup of water.  I also omitted the avocado and red pepper because I didn't have them on hand.  Oh, and definitely, definitely use the cilantro... it compliments this salad wonderfully!

My whole family loved this. It would be great for a picnic or cookout. I served it with grilled chicken. I thought it had too much dressing so the second time I made it I only used about 2/3 of the dressing. Also, it only keeps a couple of days because of the avocado.

I've made this one about once a month.  It's quick and delicious!  I don't like avocados so I leave them out, but other than that it's great.  Good for picnics.

OH MY!  This recipe is absolutely delicious!  And seems to be good for you too!  YUM!  I used a pound of dried beans instead of canned and used blanched, fresh-off-the-cob corn instead of frozen.  Wonderful.  I made it for a picnic and it was SOOO good, I left the salad at home in my fridge--I didn't want to share!  Thanks for the recipe.  I will make it time and time again.

My husband and I throughly enjoyed this salad!  We served it with crab cakes.  My kids wouldn't go near the salad, but I'll make it again for adults!

This salad is incredible! I used fresh corn and topped it off with avocado and it was beautiful. Great color and flavor! Try this with nacho chips as a salsa!

We had this salad for dinner this evening, and everybody loved it!  The lime dressing gives a very "bright" flavor.  The assorted vegetables and black bean make a colorful presentation.  I served it on a lettuce leaf.

This is wonderful as salsa for chips.  It would be a great winter salsa because you don't need many tomatoes.  Everyone I've served it to raves over it.  I didn't have frozen corn so I substituted a can of corn and that was great too.  I can't say enough about this recipe.  It's wonderful.

Great recipe and easy to make. I was out of lime so I substituted lemon juice. It was very good. I can imagine that the lime would give it abit more tang. We will definately have this again. I love this website!!
