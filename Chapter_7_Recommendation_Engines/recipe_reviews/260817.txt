Fantastic and filling meatless meal. Full of flavor!  I added zucchini and used my slow cooker (five hours on low).    I made 12 rolls and didn't double a thing.  I did add some tomato sauce to the stock for a more flavorful sauce. Oh.  Freeze the cabbage for an hour and then carefully peel  and remove the leaves.  The only way to prepare cabbage rolls!

This kinda reminded me of making lasagna. You gotta do all the different steps to get the authentic feel and taste! Very yummy insides to these cabbage rolls. I did have filling left over for about 6 more rolls. It has the sweetness of the golden raisins, rich tomato flavor, and the yogurt mint sauce! I made no changes.
