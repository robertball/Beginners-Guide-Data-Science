This was really good!  I will never buy sparkling grape juice again.  This tastes very similar except better.  It makes exactly 1 gallon for the same price you would buy 1 of those little champagne bottles of sparkling juice. I used Fresca and welch's white grape juice and threw them both into a 1 gallon pitcher. Quick and simple. Thanks for sharing!

Exactly what I was looking for! Pour in the punch bowl and go- so easy. I don't like white grape juice by itself, I think it's too sweet. So the grapefruit soda (used Squirt) balanced the juice so well. I used Kroger brand juice and it was just great.

I used the new Mountain Dew White Out since I don't like artificial sweeteners and also used White Grape Peach juice. It was delicious!

This was very nice and simple. Its easier to make than stirring the frozen juice together.  I just dumped everything in a pitcher like the previous reviewer did and served at my open house for all my potential buyers. The only thing I changed was that I used welch's white grape peach juice instead of plain white grape juice.  For the soda I used Fresca.  Thanks for this non alcoholic champagne.  It was yummy!

I first made this punch because it is so simple.  I have had to make it again and again because my friends request it.  Haven't met a person yet who does not like this punch, and I have served it to hundreds!  Works well in a fountain punch bowl.  Number of servings listed here is a little conservative.  I get about 22 servings per recipe.

What a perfect drink for a baby shower!  It's so easy and so versatile, too, depending on what you want it to taste like.  I know that the little ones in my family will like this.  You can "dress" this any way to suit the occasion!  Thanks!

I had looked forward to making this after seeing all the positive reviews, but both myself and my girlfriend agree that this drink is nothing special.

Your recipe has become our family tradition at New Year's. All three of our kids absolutely love this, and I do, too. We like it better than the bottles of sparkling juice. We pour half-and-half chilled Fresca and white grape juice right into glasses, so there's no leftovers to store. Delicious!

Loved this. I put the apple juice in the freezer just till it was slushly,
chilled the fresca, then mixed them. Very refreshing not overly sweet. I took 
it to a party and everyone wanted the recipe.
