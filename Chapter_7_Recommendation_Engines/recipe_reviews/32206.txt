Delicious! This was perfect for a quick and easy lunch. I cut the recipe in half and added a little basil to the mix of herbs and spices. A local Italian Grill has a sandwich similar to this and so I toasted some thick cut Italian bread and when the chicken breasts came off the grill I added some Provolone cheese to melt over top along with some crisp Romaine lettuce. Overall, very good!

This recipe was excellent. We are trying to cut the carbs, so I took the olive oil, white wine, spices, chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and olives combined in one baking dish and baked covered for 40 minutes at 400 degrees. Will definately make it again.

Very quick and easy.  Next time I will cut the sun dried tomatos and olves into small pieces, or maybe even blend them into a sauce.  It had a nice little kick on the tongue!! Perfect summer dish that avoids the over-heated kitchen!!!

I used this recipe in my final when I was a SR in high school. I had to create a five course meal & this was my main entree. I opted not to make them into a sub sandwich, instead, I just served them without the bread. I still make this recipe occasionally and it is always a big hit with everyone.

These have great flavor but are really dry.  Off of our leftovers, I took the sundried tomatoes off and pureed them to make a paste and added pesto to moisten.  Then they were great!

We liked it, but probably not well enough to make it again.

The sandwich was OK.  It did not have quite enough zing for my family.  IF i make it again I think I will try adding some feta cheese and more spices.

OMG!!!! This was so good!!!  I actually took the advice of others and turned it into a wrap.  I added sunflower seeds and toasted the wrap in a George Forman Grill for a mintue or so.  Great recipe.  You can't go wrong with sun-dried tomatoes and feta cheese.

I made this for dinner the other night, without the bun.  My husband just loved it!!!  He kept going on and on about how good it was.  How the chicken was seasoned just right and it was so moist.   I kept a piece for him to make the next night.  Just served it with a tossed green salad.  I have to say I'm waiting for the next time I can make this chicken.  If time would only speed up.

I added the seasonings to the olives and tomato mixture, added some Italian shredded cheese and toasted it. Came out really good
