A keeper! I've always had a thing for the butter rum candies, and recently, I fell in love with hot buttered rum, so I needed to try this recipe. I could not find butterscotch extract anywhere, not even the natural food store, so I used a tsp of butter flavored extract and a tablespoon of butterscotch topping, and voila! Just don't forget to cover it before refrigerating. Otherwise you'll get that gooey skin on top. Thanks, Susan!

I left out the egg and kept the cornstarch as the only thickener, and this turned out fine. I couldn't find any butterscotch extract either, but it still tasted good without it. Very nice rum flavor, it was a nice addition to regular butterscotch pudding that didn't overpower the flavor from the brown sugar.
