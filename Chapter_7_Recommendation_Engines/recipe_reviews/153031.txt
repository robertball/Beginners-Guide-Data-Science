This was a little odd. I'm not a fish person, so maybe that's why. But I thought it lacked flavor and that the marinade was a weird combo. But true- much better than fried fish. I give it a 3.5.

This was a great combination of flavours but I adjusted it a little bit. I combined all the ingredients in a baking dish, let the fish marinate a little while and then removed the fish, lined the bottom with raw onion slices (rings), replaced the fish and added a couple of pats of butter. I baked it (actually, steamed it) for about 15 minutes and then broiled it for a few minutes. Delicious!

I really liked this recipe. Easy to make and tasty. The only thing I did differently is I cooked it with tomato slices rather than dicing them.

Incredible!  Best baked fish recipe I have ever tried!  My husband (who doesn't care for fish) LOVED it!

I liked the combination of flavours - not boring, not overpowering. Like other reviewers, I topped the fillets with tomato slices. I will surely make these again, they're easy, tasty and healthy.

Excellent dish it was a little soggy, so I made a brown rice, and top the fish over the rice.

Great recipe.  I usually make Tilapia in a fried coating and this was a great alternative.  Found it needed a bit more cooking time - but that may have been due to the thickness of the fillets.

I used salmon instead of tilapia.  I diced up the fish and 3 roma tomatoes before sticking it in the oven.  I also used fresh parsley instead of dried.  Great flavor.
