I made this recipe as written and I'll make it again! BUT, next time I'll make changes. This loaf recipe should either be doubled or made in a smaller loaf pan.  The directions did not indicate whether the canned tuna should be drained or not, so I drained it, saving the liquid in case I thought the pre-baked loaf looked too dry.  I opted to leave the tuna liquid out.  The loaf was a bit dry, but it could have as much to do with the fact that the pan was over-sized (in my opinion). Baking it at 400 degrees might a bit high, as well. While I don't often eat it, I loved the horseradish in this loaf. I didn't, however, like the ceyenne pepper, but realize it's a personal preference. All in all, a good basic recipe.

I went with a more minimalist approach to seasoning.  Whole thing is soft breadcrumbs, two cans of tuna, two eggs, salt, & pepper.  It's what I had--and it still works!

I did this pretty close to how it was written. I didn't have any horseradish, so I omitted that, and I cooked it for 30 minutes but set the oven to 350. I left some water in the tuna, and that seemed to help keep it a little moist. I also didn't have any "soft" breadcrumbs, so I just used regular breadcrumbs and just eyeballed it.

I think next time I make this, I'll double the recipe, as it was kind of skinny, and I prefer my loafs to be thicker. The cayenne gives it a little bit of a kick, that I'm not a huge fan of, but it's still pretty good.

An experiment is indeed right. I tried to follow the directions exactly so I could review based on that, but it didn't work out that way. The recipe didn't say to drain the tuna, so I didn't. It said to add the tuna in water, so I did. Then the recipe looked WAY too thin, so I added almost another cup of bread crumbs. I used less than 1/2 cup minced onion; I think 1/2 cup in the original recipe is too much, as what I used in the tweaked version was still pretty strong. I like spicy things, but like other reviewers, I didn't care for the cayenne in this one. Two eggs was an awful lot as well; it almost looked like a tuna souffl√© when it came out of the oven...until it fell flat as a flitter. Calling this is a "loaf" is a stretch as well. It's more like a rectangular, 1-inch thick, baked patty once it settles. This recipe needs a lot of work. If I tried it again, I'd probably double and drain the tuna, decrease to 1 egg, leave out the cayenne, and add some season salt.

I replaced the mayonnaise with light mayonnaise and the bread crumbs with oat flour. It  lowers the calories and fat; increases the protein and fiber.
