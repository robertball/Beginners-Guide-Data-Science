I was very pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  I was looking for a recipe to use a left over puff pastry sheet.  I used individually wrapped swiss slices since I did not have Gruyere on hand.  Also, since I only had one pastry sheet, I halved the other ingredients, but still used one whole egg.  The result was marvelous.  My husband ate more of these than the soup I served them with for dinner.  Thanks for the recipe.  We'll definitely make it again!

just made this today because I had to use up some puff pastry and cheddar cheese.  seems like there was too much milk and you definitely need to cook much longer because mine turned out gummy on the bottom and mushy in the middle after cooking for about 16 minutes!  I added some scallions for flavor...I will make these again but will cook much longer and use less milk...perhaps one more egg?

Well of course I love this recipe. One note we make them in the small mini muffin pans not the large ones. That might be why the 3 inch square did not work. Hope this is helpful and thanks for the reviews you made my grandmothers day!!!

This recipe was pretty good but a little bland. Next time I would use a different type of cheese, something sharper. Also, my filling did not puff up at all.

This looked like a great appetizer recipe, but mine went all wrong.  The egg was runny and undercooked even after it puffed up.  It tasted a bit to rich for me, and just didn't turn out the way I was hoping.

I did not see the "wow" factor in this recipe. First time, I made the recipe according to the directions...BLAH Second time, I added toppings  green chilis, sauted mushrooms, onions.. tried them in mini muffin pans and the reg size. Still no improvement.. too eggy, and cooking time much much longer than recipe calls for....I do love puff pastry but, I was hoping for more!!
