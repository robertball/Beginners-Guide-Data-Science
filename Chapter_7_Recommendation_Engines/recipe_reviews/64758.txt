This recipe created a great texture but it was way too much lemonade!  It was way too overpowering.  So, I cut the lemonade in half and increased the strawberries to 8 oz. instead of 5.  It definately tasted better and wasn't as bitter.

This was so good!  I used the whole can of frozen lemonade, 12 ounces of club soda, 1 T lime juice, 16 ounces of frozen strawberries, and ice.  This made way more than two servings.  I made half with out rum (two kid servings & one adult serving) and three adult servings with 4 ounces of rum.  My husband loved it and said it tastes like a hurricane.
