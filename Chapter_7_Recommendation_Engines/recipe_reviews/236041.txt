Very easy to toss together. They re-heat well too.

I think these would taste a whole lot better if you added your own ingredients (ie turkey sausage seasonings ect) rather than using the garden burger.

So easy and light. I added cut-up breakfast sausage in the middle of each of them & today I plan on doing the same with the addition of bacon pieces on top!

These are amazing! I m starting a new healthier lifestyle and these took so little effort; Once you try it once then you can start to add different ingredients to customize it!
