So simple yet so delicious. I'm a big fan of salt but actually felt it was unnecessary in this recipe. I used it and then regretted doing so.  This is one I will make often..thank you!

I made this with my garden peas and followed the directions exactly. We liked it but I think I'd go with the suggestion to leave out the oil before broiling so that the sauce would cling better to the peas. Other than that it was delicious.

Best sugar peas I've ever had!  Not particularly crispy, though, which would have been even better.

These are so simple and so delicious!  Normally I stay away from recipes that only have a couple reviews, but I had both sugar snap peas and fresh chives that I needed to use up.  I'm so glad I tried it!  I didn't change a thing, and I think the recipe is perfect as is.
