I am rewriting my review because after a little tweaking with the recipe me and my husband now just love it. It isn't hard to make, just frying up the chicken takes time. How changed the recipe was I instead used about 1/3-1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/3-1/2 cup of honey, soy sauce, 3 tbls. of vinegar or water (one or the other not both makes sauce to thin)  and 1/2 tablespoon of chili garlic sauce (its an asian sauce that can be found in the ethnic food aisle at your grocery store). If you don't have or can't find the sauce then you could probably use red pepper flakes instead. I really do suggest that you put in some "heat" to the sauce it just makes it ten times better and you don't feel like your eating candy chicken. You don't need to add a lot of spice just a little for flavor. Hope this helps someone.

These wings are addicting.  And now this family's favorite chicken wing.  After frying the wings, I transfered them to a 350 oven to really crisp up, added cornstarch to the sauce to make a thick glaze, basted the wings, turned them and turned the oven down to 250; basted the other side and let them finish for about 10 mins.  You can baste them repeatedly depending on how much glaze you have left.  The taste of the glaze is awesome (I added crushed garlic) and the crisp coating of the wings under it makes them even better.  Great recipe.

This is the simplest recipe with the most delicious results I've tried on the site to date. My kids fell in love with it and people can't believe it is so simple. Sometimes, I don't bother with the flour and egg and place meat into oven and pour sauce overtop and bake. I always make  extra sauce for dipping with other meats throughout the week. It tastes great as a glaze on baked ham as well. It's definately cut back on the Chinese Take Out bills. Thanks for the recipe!!

Excellent and easy. I used honey instead of sugar for the sauce. I removed the skin from the drumettes, the cripsy coating turned out great. Sauce could have been a bit thicker, but reminded me of VH Sauce that my folks used to put over pork ribs. Next time may try adding cornstarch as others did, and maybe some garlic. Yum!

I'm not sure where I went wrong but the breading turned out very soggy.  I'm not a big fan of frying so next time i'm going to skip the breading altogether and just marinade and bake the chicken in the sauce.  My husband loved this and even my picky kids weren't so picky at dinner time.  Thanks for sharing.

Easy to make and very tasty. Although the drumsticks were too messy to eat with our hands because of the sauce. I will make again and maybe try it on boneless chicken.

This sauce was wonderful! I did not bread or fry the chicken as the recipe states instead i baked them skin on and used the sauce as a glaze. I doubled the sauce. I did marinate for about an hour like someone else with half the sauce. The other half I placed in a pot and cooked on the stove adding corn starch to thicken which made the chicken sticky and just yummy!

I have also used the sauce on cubed chicken breast which i did coat in flour and fry..yummy over rice...

Thanks!!

I love this recipe and have used it numerous times! I like to use boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut them into bite sized pieces before the egg/flour process. Served over some plain white rice. I almost can't stop myself from going back for more except for the thought of leftovers for lunch the next day! This recipe is wonderful! Thanks!

good and gooey, I tried brown sugar and red wine vinegar, it adds a different taste to the sauce. Also try a half tsp of salt and accent.

Here are some changes I made to the recipe as suggested by others who have tried this recipe previously. I used about 1/3 cup of white sugar instead of 1 cup and I added 1/3 cup of honey, 1 tbl of cornstarch, (many people were saying how the sauce was not thick enough & were suggesting the honey and cornstarch to thicken it) & 1 tsp of red pepper flakes.  I also did not use any water.  My kids loved these!!

I've been making this for a few years now. So simple and tasty. For those who are new to this recipe: the sauce is not a thick sauce. Despite being thin, it is quite delicious. I suggest you double the sauce, because it's fabulous on rice. I've played around with this recipe and I like to add half brown sugar and half white, as well as a bit of ginger. Kicks it up a notch.

Very tasty.  Doubled the sauce to have more for the rice.  Boys thoroughly enjoyed it.  Modified recipe so it isn't so sweet.  Follow footnotes.

This was delicious! I used brown sugar instead of white and added chopped garlic to the sauce. Next time I will marinate the chicken in the sauce so the flavor saturates the meat and not just the coating.

I used prior suggestions and cut the sugar in 1/2 and used honey for the other half.. Also, neither my husband or I am big fans of the coatings usually suggested so i cut all of that out. instead of baking in the oven i cooked the legs in the sauce until they were fully cooked then broiled them to add a crispy taste. They came out really good. My husband loved them and told me to keep making them.

Delicious and easy. As noted in other reviews, I had to fry for about 20 minutes, 10 minutes on each side. I also doubled the sauce recipe, but otherwise flawless. This could easily work with other cuts of chicken or even tofu as well!

Loved this chicken. My 2 year old and husband could not get enough. My husband asked me to make sure I make it again. Used drumsticks, because I am not sure what a drumette is.

I made this as written and although it was good, the sauce was a little too sweet and too runny. I've made it quite a few times since, and found it tastes best using approximately 1/4 cup white sugar (or a little less) and 1/4 cup of honey and also adding a little something for some heat to counteract the sweetness (I usually use red pepper flakes). Sometimes for a change I use apple cider vinegar, but the white works well too. I also add about 1-1.5 TBS of cornstarch mixed with equal parts water and add that to the sauce. This thickens it nicely and creates a nice glaze while it cooks in the oven.

great recipe.  I used chicken breast pieces and followed frying instructions.  Then for sauce I followed all amounts except I put 1/2 c sugar and 1/3 c honey. I used red wine vinegar and also added about 1 Tbs minced garlic and 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch for thickening.  I poured really runny sauce over fried chicken and cooked it till the chicken was done (about 30 minutes at reg temp and then about 10 minutes at 400 degrees).  At this point the chicken was pretty crisp and the sauce was more of a thick glaze.  Fantastic.

Pretty good.  One and a halved and used chicken thighs.  Good stuff.  Marinated overnight in the sauce, and skipped the frying.  This recipe is quick, easy, and tasty.

My middle son is the pickiest eater, but he absolutely loved this, he said "this is the best chicken in the world". The rest of us enjoyed this as well. I added about 1 tbsp of minced ginger root (I didn't measure it, I just usually add ginger root to chicken.)
Thanks for the recipe!

This was good but very sweet.  I think I would like to try it with honey instead of all that sugar. It was very runny.  Will add cornstarch next time to thicken.  Even my picky 7 year old like it.

A bit too sweet for us.  I had even cut out some of the sugar.  Didn't have much sour taste either, just sweet.  Also, the flour coating was nice and crisp out of the pan, but once out of the oven, it was soggy.

Loved the recipe, the only thing we changed was we used apple juice instead of water and apple cider vinegar in replacement of the white.

Very good! I actually made this with chicken breasts instead of drumettes and it was awesome. I sliced two breasts into about 3 filets each and basically followed the directions, changing only some ingredient amounts here and there. I only used one egg, 2 tablespoons soy and 4 tablespoons water. I also cut down on the sugar. Actually I used agave nectar in lieu of white sugar and cut down on the amount by roughly 1/2. I also added some Chinese Five Spice, cayenne pepper, and sweet chili sauce (like another reviewer had suggested). I fried the chicken as it called for, prob not for a full 15 mins, transferred to a baking dish, poured the sauce over and added some sliced zucchini and put in the oven for the said time. It all turned out so good! Definitely RQ baby (restaurant quality) as my husband says.

Outstanding! Mild sweet 'n sour. Easy to prepare, even for a rank amateur like me. We served it with brown rice and mixed veggies. Did not do any changes except drumsticks instead of drumettes. Next time might use more flour & egg just for ease of preparation.

Very good! The sauce was delicious. I did add some corn starch to the sauce after I pulled the chicken out of the pan. The sauce was great over brown rice. I will definitely make again.

A huge hit! I wasn't sure how the sauce would turn out so I served some drumettes with regular bbq sauce, but there was no need to worry. The sauce in the recipe turned out way better. Deffinitely a keeper.

My husband and I had this last night and it was very yummy. I used drummettes and also cut some chicken breast into strips. I liked the strips better because the sauce stuck to them better and was easy to mix with the rice I had with them. I doubled the sauce and added a little cornstarch. I will be making this many times. Thanks.

I have been using my mother in laws sweet and sour recipe for the last 10 years. Well that was until I decided to try this one. This is SO easy and tastes just the same as her complicated need to boil for 20 mins recipe. I added cornstarch and heated it in a pot on the stove to thicken, then poured over cooked meatballs. My very picky husband gave it two thumbs up. Definitely have updated my recipe box with this gem.

Terrific recipe; we all loved it.  I followed others' suggestions and added cornstarch and hot chili sauce (Sriacha).  I cooked the sauce ahead of baking to ensure it would thicken, and it did.  It turned out perfect - nice and spicy with a bit of sweetness! I also used half honey and half sugar, and used red wine vinegar; I used chicken breast sliced into strips instead of drumettes.  I served this with brown rice and stir fry vegetables. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I realized when I was getting ready to pour the sauce on the chicken that I hadn't checked the reviews and I started to take the time to see what people said about the sauce because it looked really runny but was hoping it would thicken as it cooked. Unfortunately it didn't.  I also thought about bringing it to a boil before I poured it on the chicken but since I was running short on time I decided to take a chance.  I wish I had followed my instincts because it was still really runny when it was done (as many reviewers pointed out) The flavor was pretty good but probably won't make again.

I made this recipe for dinner n it was soooo delish! I substitue the water for honey(like others has stated). I did add cornstartch however I think its not needed bc the honey thickens the sauce. I like my dishses to have a bit more sweetness to them, so I did a half cup of brown sugar n half cup of white sugar. Them followed the cooking step n now we have a winner.....WINNING!!

The glaze had a good taste.  The only thing that I didn't like was how watery the glaze was.  I took the suggestion of another user to use honey and omit the water.  The glaze was still not thick....I'll have to try  adding something else to the sauce to get the consistency that I like.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The chicken fried up nice and crisp, but the sauce was too thin and the chicken ended up soggy in the oven. The flavor of the sauce was good. If I make this again I will thicken the sauce with cornstarch, as others have suggested.

This was super!  I removed the skin on drumsticks to make it a little less fattening.  I doubled up on the sauce and used it to cook some shrimp in...yummy!  Next time I'll make a rice to pour this over.

this recipe was truly tasty. I made it exactly the way as stated. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I never tasted a "sour". There was just the right amount of sweet and it perfectly melded with the breading. I am going to try these on the grill next time with just the sauce. Make lots of rice because the sauce is so tasty you will be eating it with a spoon!

Pretty good.  Next time I'll make it with a better section of meat, though.  Breast or thigh would be better than legs.

These are fine; however, 30 minutes is not quite enough in my oven.  I reduced the amount of sugar to 2/3 cup and increased vinegar to 2/3 cup.

Easy & tasty.  It's a good option for a quick dinner - like some others I skinned drumsticks - that way I got to eat the breading!

Used  1/2 cup  sugar, would have used honey for thickness too but had none on hand. Added 1 teaspoon molasses maybe  not the right addition to sauce.  Would suggest frying the chicken a little longer for a darker brown coating.  Added cornstarch because of consistencey, again honey maybe best!  Be sure to coat both sides of chicken in sauce.  Was a little sticky for our tastes but the chicken was very moist cooked this way.  May experiement again!

This recipe is awesome! It was not what I was expecting (because it is not sour at all), but it exceeded my expectations. I loves the texture that frying it adds. I will be making this again!

This. Is. Fantastic.  I have a very low tolerance for bland, flavorless food, and this recipe was a hit! My boyfriend, who's a big fan of all good food, said it's one of the best things I've ever made. I skipped the frying (only because I didn't have oil), doubled the sauce (yum!), and took another reviewer's suggestion and added 1 tbsp of red pepper flakes for an extra kick. Fan-freakin'-tastic!

I love love love this sauce! I skipped frying the chicken and just baked 5 chicken thighs in a double recipe of the sauce. Next time, I will marinate the chicken in the sauce overnight to have even more flavorful meat, but even without doing this the chicken was incredibly tender and tasted amazing. I used the leftover sauce to flavor future dishes of shrimp, rice, potatoes, etc. I used half honey and half sugar for the sugar part of the recipe - just make sure to stir thoroughly to blend them into the liquid portion.

This is basically a really nice recipe, but after reading some helpful reviews, I changed a couple of things slightly. Instead of the 1 cup of sugar, which I thought was completely ridiculous, I used 1/4 cup honey and 2 Tbsp. sugar. I changed the 1/2 cup vinegar to 3 Tbsp. I also seasoned the drumsticks and flour with salt and pepper and added a few pinches of red pepper flakes to the sauce. I know it's not fair to give a lower review when a recipe has been changed, but the only reason I'm actually not giving this recipe 5 stars is because of the amount of sugar being so over the top.

This is by far my new favorite recipe! I used a 4 lb bag of chicken wings instead of drumettes. I put 1 1/4 cup of flour with a bit of paprika, garlic powder and salt in a large freezer bag. Then I put the chicken in the bag and shook it up really good. Kept in the bag, I set them in the fridge for a couple of hours to let the flour set. (note: I did not use an egg wash before coating). I doubled the sauce, but I boiled it for about 1/3 hour and then added about 1/4 cup of cornstarch to thicken it up. I deepfried these at 350 for a about 12 minutes. Once done, I put them in a glass 9x13, poured the sauce over the top and baked them for 1/3 hour. These were just amazing! So crispy and the flavor was out of this world!

This chicken has quickly become a family fav.  I’ve made it with drumettes, regular drums, breast and boneless thighs.  I always double the sauce because we like it so much.  The other day I used the extra on some tilapia on the GF grill and we loved that too.  I also like to add dried chiles to the sauce for a little kick.  Sometimes I have the white sugar with brown and honey, it’s very versatile and you can’t go wrong. I also followed other reviewers’ advice and added a little cornstarch for thickening.  It’s our at home version of take out.  I always serve it with rice. We love it.

Super simple, tasty, no-fuss weekday dinner fare. It gets five stars simply for it's lack of exotic ingredients, imho. To make it simpler, I skipped the frying, as other reviews suggested. I also used all brown sugar and added powdered ginger. Garlic might have been good as well. Next time, though, I'm going to halve the sugar and use a half cup of either apricot or pineapple preserves. That will slightly thicken the sauce, as well. All in all, thanks for a great recipe idea on which we can all add our own twists! Oooh, cut up chicken pieces with stir-fried vegetables would be good, served with rice......

Thank you, Lynda!!! This is a GREAT recipe! I did change the amount of sugar to half of what the recipe call's for and added honey instead. Mmm-mmmm! I also fried it a bit longer and turned the oven up to 375. My husband actually requested this recipe again! My mother in-law(a fantastic cook!)even loved it! A sure fired winner!!!

When I made the sauce, I doubled the recipe, but only used half the sugar. I did not fry the chicken first, I just baked it in the sauce.  I actually liked the fact that the sauce wasn't thick; I spooned some over the chicken and the brown rice that I served, and it didn't overwhelm the dish.  By the next day, the sauce had thickened, so I took the meat off the bones and stir fried it with the leftover rice and added some quickly blanched green beans.  It was good, but I'll use even less sugar next time.

This was honestly the best recipe I have found on this site.  I doubled the sauce and served it over rice.  Everyone in my family wanted seconds!  The sauce may smell strong at first but don't change anything!!!  It is sooo good!  I used drumsticks (12) and they came out fabulous!

My husband is not a fan of chicken but we loved this one. He actually requests that I make the sauce with extra so he can throw it on something else (like I said, he's not a big chicken fan). Definite keeper for me, though!

Finally, a chicken recipe that everyone enjoyed! At first I was hesitant because it said VINEGAR, but these came out AWESOME! Careful when frying the chicken - it's hot! I fried mine about 17 minutes because I wanted it brown and crispy before I put it in the oven. I also used 10-piece wing drummette pack and this amount of sauce was fine. I had to add a little more than 14 of flour, and followed everything else exactly. Will keep this recipe and make it again! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I loved this recipe!  My family wasn't too keen on the vinegar smell while the chicken was cooking, but everyone was pleased with it after they tasted it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have prepared this recipe twice, adding just a pinch of this or that, my grandmother taught me. I usually create a special dish to relieve my wife and make her feel super special as she is. So far allrecipes has been a winner for me . My recipe box grows. Now I bring my crafts from the shop to the kitchen loving them both.

I love this recipe and use it often. I use chicken drumsticks to make it into a dinner. I skip the frying part, it is a lot of work and really not needed. The sauce is absolutely delicious! I serve it over white rice and pour the sauce over so the rice absorbs it. 
So good!

I replaced water with sake, sugar to 1/4 honey, and as suggested, a bit of red pepper. It came out still too watery. The chicken's inside has no taste. I think the chicken would have been much better by marinated over night in soy sauce + ginger + sake over night as most asian chicken recipe calls. Chicken also needed to be turned several times to catch the watery sauce.

My family was totally torn on this one. I made it exactly as written and personally speaking, it's not worth the time you invest.  I think it could be a lot better if you used something besides just flour to coat (think panko with a spicy kick) or heat up the sauce. Or both. To me it was overpoweringly sweet. My husband on the other hand, ate double servings. Even slathered the sauce onto the rice.  I will be making this again, but with some adjustments... And probably chicken breast instead of the drumsticks.

This was really, really good. However, I used one reviewers advice (beanie) and omitted the water, did 3 tbl of vinegar, 1/2 cup of honey, and 1/2 cup of sugar. I too added 1 heaping tablespoon of asian chili garlic sauce. I don't know if it's because I love heat and garlic but this nailed it for me. Next time I make this I am going to go lighter on the sweet stuff and heavier on the garlic/heat.

Like other reviewers, I made a few tweaks.  I did not add water, and used just 3 tbsp of vinegar.  It really was not a sauce, more like a basting liquid, and it didn't have much appeal as is.  I added some thai chili sauce, and that thickened it up a bit.  Next time I might use honey.  

I did not fry the drumsticks first, just dipped them in milk and flour, then baked for about 30 minutes.  Then I added the sauce and kept basting every few  minutes. The sauce had good flavor, but after you bite into the drumstick, all you get is baked chicken.  

For that reason, next time I might try de-boning the chicken after baking, then basting the small pieces in the sauce.  Or maybe do chicken breasts in the crock pit, shred, then baste.  The base recipe is a good combination of flavors, it really was sweet and sour and tasty,  but for my tastes, I will apply it differently since I like things covered in sauce.

I took beanie's advice and went with 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup honey, vinegar (no water), and chili-garlic sauce, and it turned out fantastic.  I just wanted to add, however, that the sauce is still pretty thin, and you would do well to select cookware that is just barely large enough to hold the chicken and sauce--I chose a dish that gave the chicken some separation, and I ended up with a lot of blackened sauce at the bottom of the pan.  Luckily, it was just barely caramelized and still tasted fantastic :)

This recipe was a hit in my house, used a family pack of drumsticks and they were gone by the next night. I followed the recipe exactly sooo good ... very time consuming when done in large batches but would totally make it again Thanks for sharing!

I made this with the suggestions of other reviewers and they turned out amazing.  I fried the drumettes as suggested, but I did change up the sauce a bit.  I used 4 T soy sauce, 1/2 c sugar, 1/2 c honey, 3 T white vinegar, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and a couple pinches of red pepper flakes.  I poured the sauce over the chicken and baked it for 30 minutes.   The skin on the drumettes turned out crispy, but the meat was so juicy and tender.  I served it with fried rice and broccoli.  Yummy!  I'm looking forward to making this one again.  BTW - the sauce is really good over fried rice.

Made this last night for dinner. It was fairly easy to make and little ingredients needed. I suggest to use smaller drumsticks or wings. Using larger drumsticks won't allow the sauce to bake threw as well. Very good thou.

these were great! I used a half cup of maple syrup and half cup of white sugar to give it a different flavor and consistency. The sauce, even using maple syrup, was quite thin and liquidy so I would recommend using corn starch to thicken, as others have suggested. Will definitely make again!

I was skeptical about my 4 yr old and 8 yr old with the vinegar and sugar.  My 8 yr old saw assisted with making the sauce and she  did not like it, but my 4yr old loved it and weny back for seconds.  I did only use a half cup of sugar and it was great my family loved it.  I used drumstiks and they came out perfect.  My sisiter and her family were over for dinner and they enjoyed the left over for lunch the next day.  I have told my aunt about it and waiting her verdict.  This may make it to the Thanksgiving menu as the new receipe of the year.

I looked all over for a sweet and sour type recipe and trying to please my family members.  This one did the trick.  The only thing I did differently is that I used chicken breast fingers and to the sauce I shook in some garlic powder and onion powder.  They were begging me to make this same meal the next night.

The author does not tell us at what temperature to fry the chicken. Since I seldom fry anything, I had no idea at what temperature to cook the chicken. I first had it too hot, and then too cold as I tried to adjust. So although chicken was cooked through, some had a darker breading than others - a problem for small children. Flavor was good however.

Haven't tried this recipe yet but reading reviews and seems to be a problem tring to get the Sweet & Sour right. Just a little trick....use equal amounts of Grape Jelly & Ketchup, heat in a sauce pan while wisking. The perfect taste is REALLY easy to achieve!!!  I make sweet & sour dishes quite often...and have found this a sure thing!!!

Oh my goodness!  I made this recipe two nights ago, my family LOVED IT!  The smell is so good, the taste is delightful!  Sweet, yet tangy.  I added a bit more pepper and some green onions/fennel on top to give it a spicy kick.

It's okay when you add a little bit of chili sauce, however, I don't think it is worth the calorie count in the end. Too sweet for me!

This was easy and excellent.  The sauce was perfect over rice and even my picky 5 year old said "Mom, I really like this chicken".  I'll try the sauce again, maybe with wings, or thighs even.  Very yummy!

It was really good and my picky PICKY husband actually asked me to make it again.  I double breaded it and I did add the cornstarch to the sauce.  I will make it for sure .

This was an excellent recipe that was overall easy and my kids and husband just loved.  The only thing I did was instead of making my own sauce, I had Mr. Yoshida's marinade and I poured that over the chicken before baking.  I made sure I turned the chicken at least once to get the sauce to coat all over during the baking process.  I recommend cooking at least 35 minutes in the oven.  This is def a keeper!

Pretty darn good. I only had apple cider vinegar so I gave it a whirl and not bad at all. Very sweet-tasting sauce but we like it that way. Wish I would have remembered to throw in some chili pepper to give it some kick. Very easy. Good over white rice.

I made this dish as per instructions, and SOMETHING went horribly wrong. The coating of the chicken fell of end ended up being boiled in a red, runny soup at the bottom of the pan. I tried it alone in the kitchen, and it was a sweet, boiled chicken mess. 3 stars because I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers**, and my family LOVED IT! **I used regular chicken drumsticks **I took a tip to avoid runny / watery  sauce and chose to use just vinegar,  not both the vinegar and the water.  **I didn't want to eat "candy chicken" so I added 2 tea spoons of crushed pepper flakes to the sauce to give it some kick, and it was perfect! **I forgot I had used all the white vinegar preparing the original calamity, so I used red wine vinegar and brown sugar this time as another reviewer mentioned.  **I let the coating set on the chicken for about 5 minutes before frying **Because I used drumsticks, I fried them for 8 minutes each side, then reduces the oven time to 20 minutes. My basic meat and potatoes partner couldn't stop raving about it, and both of our picky 9 year olds ate 3 pieces each! I will try this recipe again with all the changes made, except I will try without substituting the white vinegar for red. See if that REALLY makes it perfect!

Super tasty but took way longer in the oven than 30 minutes. More like 50. Otherwise very easy and good. I suppose you could brown them in the morning and finish them in the evening.

The only thing I changed was I replaced the sugar with Splenda. I Loved it!!!  The whole family ate it up and guests loved it too! This is now in my weekly rotation! Works great with chicken thighs too!  Thanks :)

I made this for my kids who love sweet and sour anything.  They loved it.  I took the skin off the drumsticks - not an easy task but easier if you rinse chicken in water first.  I also fried a little longer than 15min to crisp up the coating on all sides.  I think the sauce was perfect and is a good recipe in itself.  I am going to try it on pork next time.  Thanks!

I was looking for a sweet and sour recipe that did not call for pineapple since I did not have any on hand and I found this one. I used drumsticks and the only change I made was to add a little salt and pepper to the flour when I breaded the chicken. I turned the chicken over a couple of times while it was baking to make sure it was well coated with the sauce. It was very good and the sauce was excellent over white rice. The coating stayed crunchy, even after being basted with the sauce and the chicken was moist and flavorful. This is a good, basic sweet and sour sauce that I am sure would also be good on boneless pork cubes or bite size ribs like you get in chinese restaurants.

Really great flavor! I used 2/3 cup sugar, and added sweet chili sauce as others suggested. I might try adding some cornstarch next time, and maybe marinate it for a few hours.

I didn't like this dish as it turned out rather sweet and the smell of the vinegar was overpowering when it was cooking. My kids liked it a bit but didn't enthuse over it. I don't think I will make it again.

I didn't fry the chicken but I definitely will next time.  
I added some hot sauce and jalepeno sauce to the liquid portions. Gave some heat to all the sweetness!I also added honey and some cajun spice!
I think that there is too much liquid when it is baking so I drained the liquid into a non-stick pan and let the chicken crisp up on broil, turning the chicken often.  While the chicken was on broil, I let the remaining liquid in pan boil for a bit to thicken the sauce.  Amazing as a dip for the chicken on the side.  I had also made coconut shrimp and these were delicious in the spicy/sweet sauce!

This is very simple to make. I loved the sauce, although I was very skeptical about the smell while it was in the oven and almost stopped cooking it. Glad I let it finish. I loved it, but hubby didn't but he doesn't like sweet and sour anything. Thanks for sharing.

My husband and son LOVED this chicken but I thought it was way too sweet. The sauce did not thicken up in the oven and had to thicken it on the stove with some cornstarch and pour it back over the chicken. I will probably make it again for the boys but try less sugar.

I thought this was pretty tasty, but the boyfriend and his son only thought it was so-so. Unfortunately, since it's not the simplest dish (frying is a pain), I probably won't make again.

I had to split the difference in rating...I gave it a 0 and my husband gave it a 5.  He absolutely loved it and finished it all up..I, on the other hand, thought it was SO sweet that I couldn't eat any of it.

The sauce was delicious, I've always used brown sugar for my S&S sauce, but liked this much better.  Next time will use something to thicken the sauce just a wee bit.

absolutely wonderful, i used the sauce recipe for drumsticks and thighs instead of drumettes and they were delicious. i will have to spice it up next time with garlic and hot sauce, i think it'll be just as wonderful that way, too.

Man and child both love these sweet little drumettes.  I like them too, especially because they are so simple to make.  I add a little bit of cornstarch mixed with a tiny bit of water in the last 5 minutes of cooking to thicken the sauce up a bit.

These are good and exactly the same as the easy baked chicken wings on this site, I mean, EXACTLY, only difference is that this recipe doesn't have margarine or the msg, which I find you don't need, because when you eat it, you won't be able to tell you had butter in the oil or msg.  Good recipe, served this with rice and asparagus (hey, it's asparagus season, lol).

Turned out really good. We really liked the flavor of the sauce. I only used 3/4 cups of sugar thinking 1 full cup was too much, and we didn't miss the extra sweetness so that was good. Overall really nice.

My picky 4-year-old said, "I don't like this meal, I LOVE this meal!" 

Everyone in the family loved it! I did cut back on the sugar (used about 2/3 cup) and vinegar (1/4 cup) and omitted the water. The sauce was still very runny, so I thickened it up with some cornstarch after the chicken was done baking. I covered my dish with tin foil while baking to keep the chicken moist, but perhaps that kept the sauce from thickening. But I would do the same thing again next time, don't want to mess with success!

It did take about 10 minutes longer to bake than the recipe said.

I’m giving this recipe 3 stars as it is written.  But as we all have different pallets this can definitely be a 5 star for some.  I’m still trying alterations to get as a 5 star for me. But we do eat this regularly with chopped pork loin. I like garlic so guess what. A fair amount gets added as well as extra crushed red pepper. Coat the pork with egg and flour and quickly fry it ( my cubes are about 2 inch by 2inch so when frying then baking it does not over cook). The sauce is great; we will take the pork out and pour the sauce into sauce pan to reduce and thicken the sauce, when time is limited will take the pork out the sauce half way through cooking whisk cornstarch into the sauce and then pit the pork back in the sauce and finish cooking.

Great recipe as written! Due to personal preference, I added a bit of crushed garlic and a few dashes of pepper to the sauce. Also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown rather than all white. Once cooked, added about a cup of water to the sauce left in the pan and then thickened with a bit of cornstarch. Wonderful over rice. Everyone had seconds!

Not for us.  We didn't like the very sweet sauce or the flavor of it.  The sauce was very thin as others mentioned.  I'll pass on it next time.

Not for us. The "sauce" is very thin. I make a sweet and sour chicken bake and I think that sauce is far superior. I will not make this again.

This is very good--kid approved! The chicken was flavorful without needing to marinade and it only took a few minutes to put together, fry (with a little olive oil,) and get in the oven. We poured it over white rice.  Next time I will use less sugar...but definitely delicious as-is. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made the adjustments recommended by Beanie. My o my was this delicious!!! I added  1 level tbsp of chilli flakes a long with 3 tbsp of sweet chilli sauce. The extra heat gave this recipe an amazing kick. Next time I will double the sauce. I also made these with 8 drumsticks so left them in the oven for an extra 20 mins. They were so succulent and flavoursome. My husband LOVED it!!!

I made this tonight and we both loved it! I grabbed the apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar (and baked it longer) but this was the only change/difference in the recipe I made.  It was super easy and I served it on a bed of dirty red rice (Red rice with onion, mushrooms, carrots, celery, and peppers). I spooning some of this 'sauce' over the chicken which dripped on the rice bed and then topped the dish with broccoli florets. What a great tasting meal, thanks for sharing your recipe.

I am a beginner chef and am slowly learning my way around the kitchen. The egg wash/ flour coating/ frying part was a total fail. Tho I had plenty of flour on the chicken when it started cooking, I ended up with egg fried directly on the chicken. 
I rinsed the egg batter off the chicken, put it in the oven with the sauce, and baked it for 30 minutes. When I took it out, the chicken wasn't cooked all the way through. The sauce was pretty thin. 
I finished the chicken in the frying pan on the stovetop and added the sauce in the frying pan. The finished chicken was actually pretty tasty with a thicker sauce to go over the rice.

I made these the other night for my husband and son and they both really liked it. I did add a little cornstarch to make the sauce a little thicker and it turned out great. I no longer eat meat but my husband compared these to the soy garlic drumsticks from a popular chicken place we used to frequent, Bon Chon Chicken. I loved their chicken when I used to eat meat so that's saying a lot! My only problem is that although these looked great they didn't have as much crunch as my husband would've liked. Maybe it was something I did wrong?  Will be using this recipe again though! Thank you.

I made this, the only thing I did different was add some cornstarch to make the sweet and sour sauce a little thicker and didn't fry the chicken beforehand because I didn't have the time to do so, but my children and husband goobled it right up :) so thank you for this wonderful recipe!!! I have made it several times and each time it doesn't last long at all! :D

What a solid sweet and sour sauce!! LOVED it!!!  Went with one of the other suggested reviews and added cornstarch and also added a touch of sriracha  sauce in the mix, cut up some red onion, pineapple, and squash and cooked it on the bottom of the dish soaking in the sauce, the perfect amount of heat and sweetness. This recipe is definitely one I will save.

Very yummy sauce. Felt like there was an awful lot of sugar, but the taste was great. I cooked it longer than 30 minutes in the oven - more like 45.

It was good but when i poured the sauce in the pan it had a lot left over and become really thick like a goo surrounding the chicken.  Next time I'll leave some sauce to pour on the end. And brush the chicken with the sauce then midway cooking brush it again.

Excellent !!  I wasn't expecting much when I decided to try this recipe.  Prepared it exactly as written except that I reduced the sugar from 1 cup to 3/4 cup.  It was so simple and turned out GREAT.  It was a big hit with everyone -- definitely going to be making this again.

The sauce itself was very good and easy to make! But the inside of the chicken turned out kind of dry :/ So you have to fry it pretty much all the way through (and to make the coating better you need to dip the chicken into the flour first, then in the egg batter, and in the flour again. That way there will actually be some coating on the chicken.) and then when you roast it, it'll finish faster.

Loved this recipe.  Doubled the glaze and cooked 12 drumsticks covered in sauce.  I did not bother frying.  It is not necessary to double sauce. I added cornstarch and it was still thin but coated he wings perfectly and was just the right amount.  Not too overwhelming- just sweet enough.  I am glad I did not glob the sauce on.  Not as messy to eat as other wings, either!  I served with fried rice.  Delicious!  Will make again, with any kind of chicken. Thanks!

My hubby raved about this recipe. I use thighs which work just as well, I also found it easier to use a sweet &sour sauce, or homemade pepper jelly on top which gives it a nice heat. When making the sauce from scratch I also substituted honey to make it thicker.  A family favorite for sure!

This had good flavor and I liked the idea of frying the chicken a bit before baking.  Next time I would thicken the sauce and brush it on a few times while cooking the chicken in the oven.

Absolutely delicious. It takes some time to fry up the wings but the sauce is well worth it. My husband and 6-year-old daughter love the tangy sweetness. The recipe states 2 pieces per person...yeah right, impossible to only eat 2. The only thing I did different was cut the sugar in about half and it was just the right amount of sweetness for our taste. Definitely placing this recipe in heavy rotation.

First of all, there are no frying instructions. For those of us who don't fry food regularly this is a problem since it leaves out half of the cooking method. If I wanted to bake chicken there are a million other recipes for that, I was following this one for frying. I read through all the comments and couldn't find anyone who gave a tutorial on how to fry so I just came up with my own method, which was probably wrong. Second, the glaze is super thin and watery, I even followed suggestions from other users on ways to thicken it. I didn't taste it at all on the chicken afterwards which is a real shame. Overall I think the instructions are severely lacking in this recipe and the sauce is way too runny, making the outcome edible, but not very tasty.

Awesome! My husband made a point to tell me in between bites that he approved and I ate two instead of my usual one. I don't know which kind of vinegar most people use but I ended up with a combination of apple cider and white distilled, was just enough to finish off both bottles.

I used 1/3 C honey 1/3 C sugar 1/4 C vinegar 3 Tbsp cornstarch and 1 Tbsp of water. For some zing I added 1/2 Tsp of orange peel granules 1/8 Tsp of Chinese 5 spice and 1 Tbsp of chili garlic sauce to my sauce ingredients and simmered in a sauce pan. Not boiled just warmed up until all the sugar dissolved. I ended up Tripling the sauce said above since I used a whole bag of chicken drumettes and 1/2 a bag of chicken tenderloins...experimenting with boneless. It tastes so gooood! Its like dinner and dessert all in one! Like chicken waffles. I DIE!

I should give ths one star because I am a small eater and I ate two portions!  They are melt in your mouth good!!!!  Don't let the ingredients fool you!  When I read this recipe, I thought...what?  Made it exactly as written using white vinegar cuz it didn't state and served it with my own recipe for chinese noodles and mixed veggies and omg!!!!  Thank you Thank you Thank you for this fabulous recipe!  :) Oh, and I did as another suggested and turned them over half way into baking.  Myself, I wouldn't double sauce recipe unless perhaps you want to save it and use a third for this and have enough for two more dishes cuz I'm certainly making again. I had leftover sauce so if I doubled it, it would be enough for three dinners.

I absolutely love sweet and sour ...  Based on the suggestions of others I left out the water and added corn starch to thicken up the sauce.  I thought I put too much corn starch in, but obviously I didn't put enough.  The sauce is still watery and once poured over the chicken doesn't stick to it .. just burns in the bottom of the pyrex dish. 

The chicken itself has very minimal flavor from the sauce since none of it stayed on the chicken.

This is an awsome recipe!!! I wasn't to sure about the vinegar,but all the ingredients blended well together. I made the mistake of putting the sauce together first in the baking dish. So, I poured it out, but some of the sugar was still on the bottom of the baking dish. After 15mins of cooking time, I turned the chicken and then finished the cooking. 2 thumps up!!!!!!

Meh. Took twice as long to cook as it said, and the sauce wasn't anything special, and didn't taste homemade. Might as well have bought frozen orange chicken or something at TJ's and cooked it up. Dredging directions were good, though, i'll be using that technique again.

Yuuuuu-mmmmy! I added some garlic Asian chili pepper sauce I had left over from making PF Chang style lettuce wraps. Perfect!! Def add a little "heat." It makes a good balance. My husband and I don't like anything spicy, but the Asian sauce was perfect-o!

I guess I was expecting the Chinese sweet and sour taste, but it didn't quite taste like it. I'm not sure if it was because I used white wine vinegar instead of plain vinegar though. I also used drumsticks instead of drumettes. It took a lot longer to cook drumsticks... so I increased it to 400 degrees and baked for around 45 mins.

First time I always try these recipies exactly as written. This one was fantastic. I think the only change next time would be to add the cornstarch to the sauce as recommended by other reviewers so that more of that yummy sauce sticks right to the chicken. Thanks Ms. Chef for this easy yummy recipe. :)

This is a new fav! Did as others suggested and halved the sugar and added honey, red pepper flakes and cornstarch.Fried the chicken for 30 minutes and then baked with sauce at 400 for another 15 min turning once. They were a bit too sticky an runny so I popped them back in the sizzling frying pan for another 5 minutes. Thanks for this keeper!

This meal is going to be part of my regular rotation. I could not believe that such a short recipe yielded such an AMAZING meal! 

I doubled the recipe so I could use it for chicken drumsticks instead of drumettes. In the future I will turn the chicken halfway through cooking to make sure it is completely covered in the delicious sauce. It was a big hit with my children, ages 18 months through 9 years - my normally picky daughter asked for more, as did my toddler.

I used half sugar and half honey on other reviewers' suggestions.  I also used Panko (Japanese bread crumbs) instead of flour.

My biggest issue with this recipe was that the legs kept "bleeding."  (I made it for company and couldn't serve it the first time!)  The second time I made it, I even soaked the legs in ice water for quite some time, but still, when I cooked it, there was visible blood on half the pieces.

The taste is good, and I think I will make it again.  But I will use breasts (even though I know that will change the taste), and I will thicken the sauce with corn starch or flour and brush it on instead, as per another reviewer's suggestion.  By the recipe, it ended up nice and crispy where I had fried it, but then soggy at the bottom, where the sauce had accumulated in the bottom of the baking dish.

Very salty! If I made this again I'd cut down on the soy and add pineapple juice instead sugar. It's not that I won't try it again, but I am going to tweak it.

This was delicious...my kids love this dish.  I didn't use vinegar for my sauce, but added teriyaki, and  sweet & sour sauce. I've already made this twice and plan on making it again today.

This recipe was great. My fiance was not too open to trying this when he learned that I was pouring a mixture of soy sauce on fried chicken and insisted that I only fried his, with out the sauce. Once he tasted it he loved it. I did wish the sauce was a little thicker and this was very messy to eat and I think I will try it again with boneless chicken breast.
---------
I am editing this to say that I have made these with boneless chicken breast. I cut the chicken in cubes and fried them so they were like nuggets. The finished product was very similar to sesame chicken from a Chinese restaurant(w/o the seeds).  I definitely suggest adding cornstarch to thicken sauce.

Excellent flavor, the only slight change I did was add 1/2 tsp. Louisiana Hot Sauce.  I do question the terminology of drumettes versus drum sticks.

Excellent recipe! My picky eaters gobbled it up and asked for more. The first time I made it exactly as written but next time I added some asian sweet chili sauce and ground pepper/garlic mixture for added kick.As well I used 1/3 cup Apple Cider vinegar as we had run out of regular. It was fabulous - a very happy accident.

These were so delicious!  I have never made drumsticks before and wow!  I made drumsticks and thighs.  I didn't want to heat up the house with the oven so I wrapped them in foil and cooked on the grill.  YUM!  Only two drumsticks were left over and I put them in the toaster oven to heat up for a snack the next day.  Wish there had been more left over!  Sauce was a little thin, next time I'll add a little more flour or cornstarch.  There will be a next time.

Totally rocked the kitchen last night with this recipe.  I did as another reveiwer suggested and used half sugar/ half honey in place of the sugar.  I added a couple of pressed garlic cloves and a couple of shakes of red pepper; omitted the water and added one tablespoon of cornstarch.  Being as I was born and raised in Louisiana I deep fried my chicken until brown and then put it in the oven for 30 minutes; flipping chicken every ten minutes.  It was awesome!!!!  I served it with fried rice and oriental style veggies.

Even though I will make a couple of small changes next time I am still rating it with 5 stars because it truly is delicious. I did find it a bit too sweet (as some have mentioned) but my husband thought it was perfect. The sauce is very thin but by the next day it has thickened up a bit. I must say that the leftovers are very good. I heated them in the microwave on a low setting and they were still tender and juicy. Thanks for sharing your recipe. I will make it many more times with the sugar decreased and perhaps a little corn starch for thickening.

I used chicken breasts instead of the drumettes and it turned out delicious. My boyfriend liked the sweet and sour sauce so much that he asked me to make a chicken and veggie stir fry tonight using your sweet and sour sauce instead of a stir fry or teriyaki sauce!

We used thighs instead, which came out perfect. What we did was added two cloves of garlic, reduce the sugar to 2/3 cup, vinegar to 2/3 cup, added chili sauce 3tps. Bake the thighs for 40-45 minutes, then we put the thighs in to the toaster oven basting with the sauce for 10-15 minutes.  You can use the broiler instead, just keep an eye on it. Came out perfect and had enough sauce. We made just two thighs, so if you add more thighs just double the sauce.

Exceptional! Do as one reviewer noted, which is to add some of your favorite hot sauce to this (I used the srirrachi (sp?) sauce) to taste. YUM! And if you put in a little orange juice and/or orange zest, you will have something that tastes like a famous orange chicken......sooooo good!

I loved it.  I cooked drumsticks instead of drumettes, and it worked out great.  Next time I will try it on boneless wings.  I'd be eating more of it right now if fried chicken didn't have so many calories in it!

I tried this recipe last night and I loved it but my husband could not have enough of it.I only had 5 pieces of chicken so the sauce was perfect even had dipping sauce.I followed others suggestion of using 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 of honey.This worked out great because last time I tried to make a sweet and sour sause it came out too vinegar-y.Thanks Mrs.Chef this will be one of our usuals.

This is soooo crave-able!!  The next time I'm 'jonesin' for General Tso's I'm making this low budget goody!  I skinned the legs and like others, I added about a tsp of Asian Garlic Sauce to the sauce recipe as well as omitting the water.  To the flour for coating I added garlic powder, paprika, and ginger for extra kick.  It was so easy with the shake-in-a-bag method.  I found that the drumsticks reached 165 degrees internally after 20 minutes in the oven, so keep a good watch on yours!  Yum!

Wow!  This was wonderful!  I increased the receipe to 16 servings and used a value pack of chicken legs.  The family loved it!  My 15 year old very picky son couldn't even wait for his chicken to cool before eating it.  It was even great cold from the fridge this morning.  My picky family wants this again soon! Thanks!

We all really enjoyed this recipe - especially the sauce!  I took the advice to alter the recipe by using 1/2 sugar and 1/2 honey and thought that worked beautifully.  My son (who is incredibly picky) even said "the sauce is awesome".  I'm going to try and use this sauce on our next batch of chicken wings too!!

Wasn't that great as the recipe is written but next time I try it i will follow the other reviewers suggestions and somehow thicken the sauce, as it's written the sauce is like water and doesnt thicken up at all.

This was a big hit at my party! I added some pepper and garlic salt to the flour before dipping the chicken in. And I used egg beaters instead of regular eggs to save time. To the actual sauce I added a healthy dose of crushed red pepper. It certainly had a zing to it!

In looking for ways to save money, I purchased a package of chicken drumsticks and turned to Allrecipes for a way to make them special. This recipe did the trick! My family of 7 loved them. Thanks!!!

This recipe was delicious, the only thing my husband and I didn't like about it was that the sauce was way too runny, it was more like a marinade than anything. But overall great recipe I will be making it again!

This was a great and easy recipe. I put a little olive oil in the pan and only lightly dusted with flour. The sauce my fiance and I changed to 3TBS soy, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup honey, 3 TBS chili sauce (thai chili sauce). The sauce made by taste and not measure, so be creative. We didn't use vinegar or water. It was more of a sweet and spicy chicken. Overall, great recipe!

Really fantastic!  I will definitely be making this easy and cheap but scrumptious chicken often.  I decreased the sugar to 1/3c and added a bit of honey in its place, I also added a touch of sesame oil (to up the Asian appeal of the dish) along with a tsp or so of cayenne pepper for that extra kick.  It was just perfect.  I also cooked down the sauce with some corn starch to thicken it.  It was great on carrots and rolls- in fact I think it would be great on most anything- oh, I wonder what it would taste like on salmon??  Gonna try that next.  Thanks a lot for the recipe!

this was wonderful! I like to tweak things to my taste- I used honey and also a tad of seasame oil for more of that asian flavor.  I also took some advice and used 1 tsp ground red pepper; the heat was the last thing you tasted and a great finishing flavor to a bite! Some seasoned salt and black pepper with the flour and this became an instant favorite!

To make a lower fat version of this. I simmered the sauce and added a little corn starch to thicken and then used glaze to baste grilled chicken. My family loved it!!

Made this last night and it was awesome! I used breasts becuase that was all I had and I had to bake it longer because they werent fully thawed. The only thing I will do differently next time is to try to thicken the sauce a bit.

This is one of the better sweet and sour recipes. I made it with chicken breast because that is what I had I added some garlic!  The sauce was a bit runny but next time I will thicken with a little flour. Will make this again1

FANTABULOUS!!  Unbelieveable!!  I used the advice of another; 1/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup honey, 1 sprinkle of cayenne peppa and the soy sauce.  This blew my mind and I've only fried chix 2 times before.  AMAZING, I'll be talking about this for a long time!

I'm giving this a 4 only because it took a bit longer to cook than 30 minutes.  Which could be my fault since I doubled the recipe.  Other than that this recipe was great- even my kids liked it.  I served it with Fried rice and used the leftover gravy to put on top of the rice. It was really good. Next time I think I may lower the amount of sugar.  Mmm...good!

This recipe is a good change from my usual baked herb chicken.  I've never had baked chicken in sweet and sour sauce and this is surprisingly good.  However, I used brown sugar and honey instead of white sugar and added some chopped garlic and dried chilli flakes.  I also added a little salt and pepper to the chicken.  After I poured the sauce on the chicken, it was no longer crispy but I think the flour coating is supposed to absorb the tasty sauce while baking. Love it!

These were so good. I changed it a bit though. I added salt and pepper to the flour. I only had 1 3/4 tbsp of soy sauce. SO I added 1/2 tsp ginger and 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 sugar.

Was a little bit too sweet, will use less sugar next time. All in all, it was pretty good. A little bit too time consuming w/ frying and baking, but will make again.

These were pretty easy and cheap. I thought the sauce would be thicker-didn't want to take the time to thicken it up myself. Served with sticky white rice (sauce was great on rice). Like that  recipe used simple ingredients everyone has in their pantry! Cook time was right on.

My family is pretty picky when it comes to something "new", but they ate this up and asked for more.  I wouldn't change a thing... very good!

Amazing as is!  Tried and tested by my husband, our three picky eaters.  They loved it!  Served with white rice!  Extra sauce is great over rice!  So delicious and so easy!

Great recipe! Next time, I will probably skip the frying and marinate overnight in sauce.  It was the perfect combination of "sweet and sour" without being overpowering.  I also added some teriyaki, brown sugar, and ginger.

This was pretty good. I didn't think we would like it, but it turned out pretty tasty and my son loved it with his rice!(picky eater) The only thing I did differently was I added a couple tsp of Diana chicken sauce... mmmmm mmm

Sooo good!!! I used a chicken substitute (Quorn) and added steamed carrots, pineapple chunks and red onion and served it over jasmine rice.  Really easy, really good! :)

I did not make the chicken but I did make the sauce.  My boyfriend saw me pour the vinegar and saw me cook the vinegar and he said that is wayyyyy to much vinegar, but then I served it to him and he was like this stuff is so GOOD, and I ate it as well and it was awesome thank you for the recipe.

It is so satisfying when everyone at the table can't talk because they're slurping.  If you like your chicken just a little bit messy, this is the recipe for you!

I made this exactly as written and it is very good.  Really, really good :)
and it is now a favorite.  I served it with white rice, (the sauce is good over it) and broccoli with cheese sauce.

This came out pretty good - Hubbie liked it and wanted more sauce... I thought it was okay... chicken was kind of soggy.

More More More!!!!  As another reviewer said, MAKE LOTS!!!  I didn't have Soy sauce so used teriyaki sauce with a little salt and also used red wine vinagre.  I also baked it for 40 minutes.  Was really really good.  Will certainly make more sauce next time.  The sauce thickens on it's own when standing.

I used the sauce portion on chicken breasts and added it to Green Giant's Creat-A-Meal Sweet and Sour Kit.  I then poured both over uncooked chow mein noodles..yummy!
