I like to make these with extra sharp cheddar cheese instead of mozzerella. I also throw in a few spices (onion powder, garlic powder, fresh ground pepper, chopped chives, hot sauce and a little dijon mustard). This makes a great all-in-one casserole when you throw in cubed ham and a package of frozen broccoli. When I make this, there's never any leftovers.

I make my own version of these frequently with CHEDDAR cheese (and lots of added veg), so I was not sure we'd like this mozzarella cheese version.  I was pleasantly surprised when we all very much enjoyed these.  I used Kraft's shredded "Pizza Cheese" blend for the cheese and eliminated the black pepper per personal preference.  I chose to prep these the night before, store in the frig, and simply bake a touch longer (maybe 5-10 minutes more) at service.  THANKS for the nice twist, JulezinWI!

Too greasy, so I made again and  I cut the butter or margarine in half.  I also topped it with gluten free bread crumbs as I am gluten intolerant.  My husband loved the second batch.

Turned out great!  The only thing I did differently was use half mozzarella and half colby-jack cheese. Everyone loved it!

I made these with shredded frozen hash brown potatoes (I didn't have the diced on hand.) I also added some minced garlic. They turned out great and they were very easy to make. Thanks for the new family favorite!
