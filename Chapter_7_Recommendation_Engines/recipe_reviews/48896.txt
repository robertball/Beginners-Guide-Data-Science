I am giving this 4 stars only because I am used to eating frozen dinners in the microwave. My wife used to make liver for us and I loved it. Since I am alone now I am trying different things (easy things) to make instead of Hungry Man or Stouffers. My daughter suggested this site and I have to give Allrecipes 5 stars for their help. The most important thing I needed was what to use; a frying pan, oven bake or broil. But this recipe is something I think I can handle. I must also admit that when you sweat your a - - off making something fresh, it taste soooo good.

This has been a favorite since 1968, when I found it in a cookbook that came with the stunning set of pans I bought a few months after graduating h.s. (and still use!). My folks and I happen to like liver, but my mom quickly discovered that even people who "can't stand" it ask "What is this and may I have the recipe?"   It's important to NOT overcook the liver. Most people cook it till it's shoe leather, which is probably why people can't stand the stuff—shoe leather is never tasty.   Reduced fat sour cream works, but fat-free not so much. Don't let boil the sauce or it separates. Serve the sauce and onions over hot rice. Add brightly colored veggies—salad, broccoli, crisp fresh green beans—and oh my my what a delicious, and vitamin rich, banquet fit for your best guests!

I put a few twists on this recipe I cooked about 1 lb of liver.  I minced about 3 large cloves of garlic and sauted them with my onions.  I used butter but I think in the future I will use olive oil and save the calorites in butter for somtething when I cannot substitute butter. I quickly sauted the liver as it was not that thick and I did not want to overcook it.  I used a 4 oz can of button mushrooms along with the juice and about 1/3 cup light red wine.  I decided to use 1 can of mushroom soup (undiluted) and only about 3 large Tbs of sour cream.  I also added a few dashes of gravy bouquet for good flavor and browning color.  Only a few dashes of worcestershire sauce as I did not want to overwhelm the gravy bouquet flavor.  I felt my gravy was not thick enough and I had leftover mashed pots that I was going to put the liver over, but decided to add them to the liver mixture.  Hint: I could have used another large onion that would have improved the texture of  this dish plus more interest.  All in all I think it turned out very good and will fix it again and it is probably one of the best liver dishes I have ever had or made.  Very Good

I wish I could give this 6 stars. This is the best liver and onions recipe i'v tasted. I always wanted to find something close to what my mother made and this is it. Thank you for bringing back memories. My mom would be happy.

My husband and I wish that we could give half stars because we would have rather given this dish a 4 1/2 star rating.  My husband likes liver and I merely tolerate it, but this dish was absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe to a T and the liver was so tender and the sauce was great over brown rice.  This is a keeper!

Five +++ for this one, the only thing I didn't have was any mushrooms, so I added more onions and some red wine so it was rich. 
I'll be making this again, thank you for the recipe

This is a great recipe. I didn't have mushrooms or wine so I added about half a can of cream of mushroom soup to the sour cream before mixing with the liver and onions. I also soaked my liver for about an hour with water and salt to get some of the blood out and help tenderize it... I think it was just wonderful. Thanks for sharing

We omitted the sour cream, but added more mushrooms and onions.  Found the meal to be quite easy to prepare and very healthy.  Actually drove 75 miles to share the meal with a friend who was not feeling well.  It went over well…brought back lots of ole school memories.  We kept it simple…liver/mashed red potatoes/green beans/glass of wine…We made HAPPY PLATES…LOL…

At 28 I LOVE liver and onions but this recipe is the best I've ever had (and I thought I made a killer l&o).  I also added red wine (highly recommend!)

I'm always amazed how my palate has changed with age. I used to hate liver as a kid, but now I just love it and this recipe was a wonderful addition to my recipe box. Even my daughter loved the liver!!!! and that's saying something. A recipe that gets kids to eat liver. The addition of the sour cream and mushrooms were a plus!!! This really cut into the strong liver taste and made it more mild, but added some depth to the flavor. I did add 1/4 cup of dry red wine as suggested by another reviewer and this just enhanced the taste even more! I will definitely be making this again for my mother and mother-in-law I know they will love it. Thanks. YUMMY!

My husband loves liver but not with sour cream.  He ate it but did not like it. He said, "please make it the other way" with liver, onions, and a bit of beef broth simmered. I will leave the sour cream for the beef stroganoff!!

I usually cook liver and onions the traditional way but tried this as an alternative.  I lucked  up on some calf liver on sale recently so wasn't being so stingy with the meat.  My husband is an anomaly to me in that he adores sour cream and will eat it with a spoon out of the tub but he hates stroghanoff.  He devoured this in minutes and asked for more!  I liked it just fine but he really loved it and it was really easy to make.  I was worried that the longer cooking time would produce tough liver but it didn't.  Also, the sour cream seems to work the same way soaking the liver in milk prior to cooking does...that step is skipped here with good results.

I thought it delicious.  I have never used tin mushrooms in my life, but had a lovely mix of bolets, cepes and girolles which I used.  As they were fresh, I didn't have any liquid, so made that up with white wine.

This is exactly how i have always made liver and onions but i usually omit the mushrooms. Another key trick- soak your liver in milk or buttermilk overnight if you are using older liver, veal liver can be used without soaking. I garnish with fresh chopped dill and serve with mashed or roasted potatoes - this is a very popular Russian/Eastern European dish!.

We used chicken livers and about 10 oz sliced fresh crimini mushrooms instead of canned. 
Our housemate is on a very low carb diet for his diabetes, and this dish works well for him.  All of us liked it a lot.

I thought we might add a little bouillon and red wine, but we didn't, because the liquid level was already good even without mushroom liquid from a can.  We might try that another time.

I still couldn't get my family to eat liver.  It was good and not overly difficult but honestly would rather just make liver and onions with ketchup.

Very very tasty. A snap to make. Next time will try nonfat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream for a bit of tang.

I'm not a big fan of liver, my husband is.  This was a total winner.  I even enjoyed it.
7/19.   Today I made this with chicken.   My husband is in love with the sauce.  I took the advice of others and used the onion soup on mix.  This is a great find.  Thanks for sharing.

The only reason I am giving this recipe a 4, is because The Instructions for the Preparations of Liver Doesn't tell to DRY SLICES OF LIVER prior to Frying in hot fat. Otherwise it is very simple to make and delicious recipe.
