We loved this, but I did alter the cooking method...I couldn't see baking all of those ingredients on top of the raw chicken for 45 minutes, so I put the chicken in the oven for about 30 minutes, removed it, added the toppings and finished cooking about 10-15 minutes more. I am glad I did it that way b/c the cheese was already beginning to brown and it was not in there that long. I made my own honey mustard dressing ('Honey Mustard Dressing II' from this site), and that worked out great. Great combo of flavors...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

03/28/18: Didn't need olive oil; doubled the bacon and used it's drippings to saute a equal mix of small common onion, green onion bulbs and garlic cloves, adding spinach just as garlic began to brown; don't let garlic get dark.  Going through the chicken with a sharp fork really helped in absorbing the honey mustard marinade;  I'm considering an overnight  marinade next time. Smart idea to use non-stick cooking spray on glass baking pan, and lay marinaded chicken by itself in 350 degree oven for 45 minutes THEN top each piece with generous amounts of bacon and Provolone for about  12 more minutes ( just as cheese browns ).  Your toughest food critic will love this dish--and you'll feel proud discovering how tasty you made this dish!!

Thanks to reading Christinaâ€™s review first, I baked the chicken 15min, flipped. Baked another 15min, flipped, then added the toppings. I only had slices of provolone which worked fine. Fabulous recipe. Juicy chicken and very flavorful

Delicious and easy. I did not have shallots or provolone on hand, so I skipped the first and substituted sliced fontina for the second. The garlicky spinach -bacon-cheese topping was excellent and the chicken stayed juicy.  A keeper recipe.

I followed the suggestion of cooking the chicken for 30 minutes then adding the toppings. Turned out great! I also sauteed the noodles in the pan I previously made the spinach topping in.

Delicious. Did not have bacon, so just omitted that ingredient. It was excellent without it. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It was quick and easy, and a different way to fix chicken.

I'm always looking for New and Creative recipes for dinner. I have some chicken and spinach and want to use the spinach before it goes bad. Looking forward to the results. Thanks for posting.

If I could, I would give this 4.5.  I followed others' suggestions and cooked the chicken for 30 minutes then added the toppings.  With the spinach mixture I used the 1/2 of the bacon grease  and add a tbsp of butter.  I also minced 1/4 of an onion and cooked that with the spinach.  I kind of made up my own dressing with mayo, mustard, honey, apple cider vinegar, and lemon juice.  I used crumbled cooked bacon.

Excellent, quick and adaptable. I try to make a recipe as written the first time but I didn't  want to open a bottle of wine just for 1/4 cup so I used chicken stock and 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar for the marinade. I also chopped the bacon first so it would cook faster. Will make this again for sure.

Great! My chicken breasts were thick, so I sliced each in half to leave two thinner cutlets. Followed the recommendation of others and pre-cooked the chicken a bit.  Only change I would make next time would be to wait and put the cheese on closer to the end as mine ended up melting and running down into the pan.
