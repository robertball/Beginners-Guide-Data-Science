This is just to counter-balance the annoying New Yorker who insists that everything be judged by his or her New York standards.

If you judge this recipe by "italian taste" standards and not by NY pizza rules, it is a very tasty spin on a traditional pie.  We didn't really know what to expect, but enjoyed it alot more than we thought we would.  Added a few toppings, but other than that we follwed the recipe exactly.  give it a try !!

Variation and invention is what makes cooking and baking such a flavorfull art. This pizza was pretty good and original. Not for people who think Pizza originates in NY.

This tasted better than I thought it would;  I'm not a big fan of Alfredo sauce, but the quantity in this recipe doesn't overwhelm the other flavors, so it's not bad at all.  I made individual pizzas used garlic & herb flavored tortillas (oven baked for a few minutes to crisp them up), then topped them with Webber spicy sausage, store-brand lite Alfredo sauce, and finely shredded mozzarella.  The flavored tortillas were a little too much - plain would have been better.  But each mini-pizza, along with a simple side salad, made an unusual and very satisfying meal.  This recipe is definitely worth trying, especially since it's so versatile that you can make it to suit your taste.

This was really, really good!  The only thing I changed was I only used 1/2 pound of sausage because our family doesn't like a whole lot of it on a pizza.  Great flavor and really easy!

My hubby LOVED this pizza. I used 1 lb. of sage pork sausage instead of Italian and added a little fennel seed. I did embellish a little and added sliced fresh mushrooms, torn fresh sweet basil leaves, and feta cheese as well on half. A really nice change from the red sauced pizzas. The first time I made this one, I didn't have alfredo sauce, so I brushed on olive oil and minced garlic then added the toppings. My hubby really liked that one, and it was a hit, but said this was even better with the alfredo sauce! This one is def a do-over! (UPDATE: I've made this one for guests and they asked for the recipe before they left. That's the best compliment... : )

I used pita pockets to make this pizza (prebake pockets 3 min. at 425, top with ingredients then bake 10 min) We enjoyed the pizza however next time i will make a homemade alfredo. I bought the highest quality jar sauce i could find but still didnt care for its flavor. Homemade is so much better.

Not having made this I will not comment on the taste only on the name. Traditionally something called white pizza in NY and New England is olive oil and garlic sometimes without any cheese at all. New Haven is famous for white pizza and white clam pizza. I think the reviewer should not be rating the taste based on the name in this case. I think a better suited name would be White Sausage Pizza since it is misleading what I might find here. Originally I was not looking for the type of pizza as in the recipe when I did my search. However I do plan to try this eventually when I'm not watching my calories. Since it won't let me rate I will rerate when I try this but I'm assuming it will get a 4 star rating based on the description.

I had some Italian sausage I wanted to use, but I didn't want tomato sauce or pasta with it.  This fit the bill.  I actually thought there was enough topping for two small pizzas.  I used pie crust mix for my crust.  Both my husband and I really enjoyed it, especially since it was a nice change from the usual Italian meal.

Okay, I didn't use Italian sausage, but simple mild breakfast sausage.  My kids don't like Italian style sausage.  But, it was still pretty good.  Even my daughter, who normally won't even touch pizza.  The only thing I didn't like was the overly soft pizza crust.  But, I used a canned refrigerated dough, instead of a pre-baked one.

I wanted to make a special pizza for my boys, something different from what they usually have. I learned a while back that you can buy pizza dough from Papa Murphy's. The guy working was nice enough to sell me a large that was all ready to go for two bucks. I used the Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce from this site for the prepared alfredo sauce. I omitted the onion (my kids aren't too keen on onions) and used a package of Canadian bacon along with the cooked ground sausage. I sprinkled the top with a bit of Papa Murphy's Herb Cheese blend, too. All in all, the whole pizza took no longer than fifteen minutes to put together and my kids loved it. Sure, it's a little messy but
that's what makes it good! I'll try this again so that my husband could try it as well. It was super yummy and both the kids and I really enjoyed it.

I really enjoyed this new taste of pizza.  I will make again.  I used a Whole Wheat BOBOLI crust and only used 1/2 the sausage (what I had on hand)and 1/2 the onion just because I thought it would be enough for the amount of sausage used, but the same full 1/2 cup of Alfredo that it called for.  I used mozzarella shredded(what I had).  Nice change, look forward to it again. ***Made it again, still BOBOLI crust but this time the Reg. and again only half the onion and half the sausage and it is plenty.  This time I did add some sauteed mushrooms. That was a nice touch.

It is a easy and practical recipe.Alfredo Sauce makes a good combination with the sausages.But,I recognise,I changed a little the recipe,cause I used a little spicy sausages,and a mixture of cheeses,mozarella,edam and cheddar.Anyway,it is pleasant to eat a pizza,with a different sauce,not only with the red classical one.

This was pretty yummy.  I and I actually MADE the pizza (unlike another review posted here) before I posted my review which I think should be required when giving anything less than 5 stars on this site.  ANYWAY...I used a Boboli pizza crust that I sprayed with olive oil (using my Pampered Chef Kitchen Spritzer which I love) and popped it in the oven for a few minutes first to make sure the crust got crispy.  For the sausage I used one pound of reduced fat Jimmy Dean ground sausage and I used the store brand Alfredo sauce which was lower in fat and calories.  I added half a yellow onion, three small garlic cloves and four mushrooms sliced.  I thought it made a lot of topping so I reserved some for my scrambled eggs for tomorrow morning :-)  I still used the 1/2 cup Alfredo sauce and it was plenty to cover my pizza.  I topped with 5 or 6 oz of the Italian blend cheese and it was plenty cheesy.  I thought it turned out really well.  The only change I would make is to try a garlic Alfredo sauce next time and/or use more garlic cloves.  I love garlic!

This is really good, but super rich, IMO! I used "pizza crust I' from this site for the crust and 'quick and easy alfredo sauce' for the sauce. I had some sliced mushrooms to use up, so I threw them in to cook with the sausage and onion mixture. This pizza had great flavor and I will be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Oh my, Oh my! This was so cheesy and the alfredo sauce was perfect with the sausage. I used a jar of alfredo sauce to make it simple and used a quick box mix for the pizza crust.

Amazing pizza!! Our grocery store was out of Italian blended cheese cause it was on sale, so I had to improvise and use regular. Also added a little Italian seasoning to it as well and it turned out awesome! :D Great pizza:)

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  We tweaked it a bit...no onion and we used chorizo instead of Italian sausage.  We will definitely eat this again!  Very easy to make!

Awesome!  I just added a bunch of cheese I had in the frig and it turned out great!!  I also put it on a wheat pizza crust and used lean pork italian sausage for a slightly healthier option.  This pizza was so good!  We will be having this again!

prepared with refrigerated crust. Don't care for the sausages on white pizza. Maybe we'll try chicken if we do the recipe again.

This was really good. I enjoyed it but the family didn't like it as much. I used sweet Italian turkey sausage and added garlic, black pepper and crushed red pepper for kick. I also used a Boboli pizza crust and that was pretty good. The only thing I think would be better would be to use ground Italian Sausage. I though some of the sausage pieces were a little too big and I thought I broke them done pretty good. I would definately make this again for myself.

This was such an easy recipe.  I did alter it a bit with the addition of mushrooms, onions, and a few jalapenos.  It was well received by both my fiance and my best friend.  I did buy a pillsbury crust, spread a little garlic on it, and baked it about 10 minutes.  I then put the sausage mixture on, topped it with cheese, and baked about 10 more minutes.  I can see this being a very versatile recipe, as I used maple sausage, but cannot wait to try it again with hot sausage.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome versatile recipe.  I made my own herbed crust, carmelized the onions before putting them on the pizza, layered tomatoes on top of the sausages and onions,and sprinkled green onions, cilantro, and asiago cheese on top.  Yummm..

Made just a few changes: Used Italian style ground turkey and roasted red pepper alfredo, stirred in some chopped baby spinach before topping the crust. Used a thin crust and rubbed with olive oil and fresh ground black pepper. OMG! This is great! Thank you for sharing such a good recipe. We will definetly be adding this to our regular rotation.

This was so easy and good.  I couldn't find any Italian cheese blend at the grocery store, so I just used mozzerella.  I will definitely make this over and over again.

I gave it four stars because it needed a little more. When I was done it was the BEST pizza I've ever had! I use frozen/thawed fresh dough, rolled it out and spread a thin layer of pesto and then a think layer of Alfredo. I added pepper and a heaping Tbsp of minced garlic to the onion/sausage mixture. Once that was on my pizza I added olives, spinach and chopper up some precooked chicken strips. Covered with cheese and baked for about 15 minutes. The trick is not too out too much so that it doesn't under bake the dough. Mmmm Mmmm.

Hubby said “five stars, this is an all timer”.  I agree. Limited changes....I used turkey hot Italian sausage (about .75 pounds) and found some fairly low fat prepared Alfredo sauce. Used Boboli thin crust and did add a little olive oil and garlic salt and powder to the crust before I layered on sausage mixture.  Wonderful Sunday funday treat while watching football and having a nice glass of red wine!!

This was really good. I brown ground beef all the time, but the sausage was a lot harder, so the pieces ended being a little bigger than I would have liked. However, it seemed fine when I ate it. The only changes I made were leaving out the onion and doubling the amount of sauce. The one thing I didn't like was the crust I used (Mama Mary's), but other than that it is something I will probably make again.

I did not make any variations to the original recipe. It was pretty good. A little meaty for my personal taste. Next time I will cut back on the meat a little and add some veggies. Just a personal preference though! Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious.  I listened to the reviews and made sure to purchase the garlic alfredo sauce and add some garlic bits to the mixture.  I used whole wheat dough and I substituted the green peppers for roma tomato slices.  I also made sure to add a layer of mozzarella first so that the contents would melt together.  My husband and mother in law were skeptical at first and then they ate it and raved about it.  I loved it and I'm from Philly.

This was pretty good...Thanks for the basic recipe. I used a Pillsbury thin crust in the can cuz that's what I had, but it turned out great for a saturday afternoon watching movies. Will shuzz it up a little next time. And NO it is NOT New York pizza, but if you live in the middle of the country & cant get GREAT east coast pizza, this does help.

I used sweet Italian sausage but next time I’ll make it with hot Italian sausage for more flavor. The pizza was loaded with the toppings, so I might use two crusts next time.

this is one of those nice easy recipes for when you're in a hurry.  very good.  i have three kids so i am always looking for quick kid friendly recipes.  i've also made this with ranch dressing and instead of sausage used ham.  sure it's not "authentic" white pizza, but that doesn't mean it's not delish!
