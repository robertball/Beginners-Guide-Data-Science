Super quick and easy dish!  Loved it...used it as an additional entre to our Mexican dinner night and paired it with tamales.  The chicken was very well seasoned, and the rice was perfect.  It's hard to make a Spanish chicken and rice dish well, and I think this more than hit the mark.  Loved the use of the frozen sofrito...it was made w/fresh ingredients and I usually by the canned stuff.  This was SO MUCH BETTER.  Great job, Birds Eye, and thank you!!!
