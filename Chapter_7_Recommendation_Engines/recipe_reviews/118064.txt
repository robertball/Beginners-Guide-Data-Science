Great after they've sat for a day.  I might do cream cheese frosting instead of meringue next time.  The cupcake is good enough to skip the frosting if you want.

The cupcake is delicious but I used my Orange Buttercream frosting instead of the meringue.  Tasty. I wanted a cake that wasn't heavy like pumpkin (which I love) but Summer calls fro a lighter cake. :)

Great taste ... I left out the nuts and used a Coconut Buttercream Frosting for the waves.  Very tasty and baked wonderfully.
