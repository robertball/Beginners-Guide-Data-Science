While I would have liked to give this a higher rating, I just can't. While the flavor was O.K., the amount of time, preparation, steps and pans used were ridiculous considering the outcome. I think I could have used Velvetta mac and cheese, added the andoille, celery seed and onions to reap the same results. Won't be making this again.

This dish is wonderful.  Great for company but you'd better make extra because there will be no leftovers.

With a couple of changes, this turned out AMAZING. My only real problem was that it just wasn't cheesy enough - I  added a lot more Gruyere and Cheddar, and also a handful of shredded Swiss. I omitted the celery (not a fan), and simply sauteed the onions along with the Andouille. This ended up being a fantastically rich and tasty meal. Thanks, Craig!

After reading so many reviews about the taste, I decided to change the cheese to Smoked Fontina--delicious!  I would not use the bread crumbs next time.  They did not add to the flavor and they were too crunchy.

This was pretty dang good on a cold evening. I didn't use any celery, the sound of that didn't turn my crank, so I skipped it. I used Swiss cheese instead of Gruyere, because Gruyere is super expensive here. The other problem is, living in Washington, I can't find andouille that often, so I used kielbasa, instead. Great recipe and I'll use it again...thanks for submitting it!

Okay, liked it but...am I missing something? I could only account for 3T butter, but no big deal there.  also, directions don't say what to do with the onion and celery. I just added it in the end and mixed all together before baking. But liked the flavor. different than regular ole mac and cheese.

The flavor was just so-so for all the work that went into it.

Let a previous reviwer I would have liked to give this a higher rating. I concur the amount of time, preparation, steps and pans used were ridiculous. Forget the salt altogether and let the andouille provide the flavor. I will, however, keep working with this recipe. It has potential.

I think the onion and celery help make it that signature creole dish. I loved it. I substituted Panko for breadcrumbs and did 1/4 tsp. of cayenne instead of paprika also parmigiano reggiano instead of plain parmesan. Was perfect!

Good - also included small pieces of recent leftover asparagus, mushrooms, and both a base and topping of bran flakes for a bit of crunch.

A fair amount of prep & steps  go into this recipe, along with using a lot of dishes and pans, but the end result was good.  Didn't have gruyere cheese, so I used Swiss instead.  I will definitely make it again, although I might add more andouille sausage and cheese.

Very good and cheesy. My cheese sauce curdled, though. Also I mixed the sausage, breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese together instead of using it for a topping. Duh.

Just not good enough for the amount of time it took to make.
