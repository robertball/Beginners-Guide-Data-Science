This is "delicious" I only used 15oz pineapple and didn't have any nuts so I added raisins it was "scrumptious next time I'll add the nuts and keep the raisins and maybe use 20oz can of pineapple like some others did. It tastes like a cross between gingerbread and fruit cake.

Very good. I used a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple drained well because the store did not have a 15 oz. and I did not want to waste any. I used pecans in place of the walnuts and tossed in a little coconut as suggested in other reviews. Will be making this again easy and tasty.

I absolutely love this bread and so does everyone I've made it for. Normally I can not stand to eat bread plain with no butter on it or anything but this one is perfect alone. It is very crumbly though. I use pecans instead of walnuts and add 1/3C coconut and a 20oz can pineapple instead of a 15oz can.

I halved this recipe and baked in a mini loaf pan. I couldn't help but to throw in a handful of coconut. Glad I did cause it really made the loaf moist. I liked it better the next day. I also think it tastes best at room temperature. The Fruity Cream Cheese Spread recipe from this site goes great with it too!

The flavor in this bread was fantastic and it is so easy to put together. I added 2 tbsp. ground flax seed but other than that I stuck with the recipe. I didn't have any problems with dryness in fact I had to leave it in the oven for 10 minutes extra because it wasn't finished in the center. My mom and I enjoyed this bread on its own hot from the oven. I imagine it would be really good with some butter or cream cheese as other reviewers have mentioned. thanks for sharing this recipe!

The texture is good. I used a 20 oz can of pineapple (drained like I would for frozen spinach). It didn't have a strong pineapple flavor but I would make it again.

This was very good. It had a lot of flavor. It works as a good base for whatever you want to put in it instead of pineapple. It's nice because it's cheap to make and has few ingredients.

Easy and delish! I made this recipe into a vegan version (Ener-G for egg replacement and vegan butter) and it came out perfectly. Only word of advice is to let loaf cool completely before slicing because it is so moist.

I loved the way this turned out:) it was pretty much gone the same day I made out lol. I added vanilla and coconut flakes. I also mixed walnuts and pecans because I didn't have enough of either and didn't want to hop to the store. I put coconut flakes on top before I baked it and I love how it gave the bread little crunchies. I'll definitely make it again.

I've made this as written but I once made it with what I had on hand and I liked it way better: 15oz can of diced mango in place of pineapple and raw cashews in place of the walnuts. So good. The base recipe is so easy and simple that you can change the fruit and nuts for anything.

I put in a 20 oz. can of pineapple to make it more moist. I was given a loaf and found this recipe to make. It s really good. Also I added 1/2 cup of nuts which always makes anything better. This bread is fast and easy to make.
