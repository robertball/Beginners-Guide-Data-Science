SOOO GOOOOOD!! I was worried b/c I wasn't sure if my family is huge curry fans or not so I reduced the curry to 1/2 TBLS, 4 TBLS of lemon juice and added a dash of garlic/onion powders. Served inside warmed "Garlic and Herb Pita Bread" with lettuce, green bell peppers, and sliced onions. A raging hit! We all had seconds! Will make this easy and tasty dish again and again! (Next time, I'll try the full TBLS of curry to see if they like it that way too.) Thanks Dannon!!

I took a chance on this recipe and served it to my boyfriend and some guests who were over - everyone devoured these!! I too added some garlic and onion powder and served with a variety of veggies for our guests to load their pitas with their choice of fillings (onions, lettuce, shredded cheese, bell peppers, olives, etc...). Even the male guests thought this was awesome and ALL my guests left my home with the recipe in their hand. Thanks Dannon!!

We loved this recipe!  I reserved half of the sauce for dipping (it made plenty).  I didn't have yogurt so I substitued sour cream with a little buttermilk.  We like curry so I doubled that. Awesome over rice!

This was very easy to make and very good.  I made it as a pita sandwich and stuffed it with tomatoes and cucumbers.  Needs to have a dipping sauce.  Warning...you must really like curry to make this.  My entire house smelled like it for two days!

The whole family liked this one.  We enjoyed the flavor of the curry.  I suggest you use the the optional toppings it makes the sandwich great.  The next time I may kick it up with cayenne and add paprika.  Thank you for this one.

This was a quick and easy meal.  I think next time I make them I will decrease on the amount of yogurt and increase the curry (my husband and I are avid authentic Indian cuisine fans!)  I also made some extra yogurt sauce up for dipping or topping our pitas.  For all those who like curry or spicy foods, the recipie as is is a little bland, so adjust the yogurt/curry ratio as needed.  Thanks, Dannon, for a quick dinner idea!

Yummy and quick! I used a store brand fat free plain yogurt and had no problems. Also, since neither my husband or myself likes cilantro, I used dried parsley.

These tasted good, but the chicken took so long to make that the outside had burnt before it was cooked. Next time I will cook the chicken almost to completion before I put it in the skillet, then finish up with the sauce

So good and SO easy. Both my 2-year-old daughter and my husband loved it, too. I think next time, I will set aside some sauce before I put the chicken in it, and use it as a dip for the pita bread, or serve the chicken with rice and the extra sauce. It was definitely too good to go to waste!
