Couldn't get oysters on the half shell, only large sizes available, so I tried this out. I have to say that it was good and pretty popular. The guests left one or two but I had them when I came out of the kitchen so no leftovers, always a good sign.   It is very easy to make. I used 1/2 slides of bacon so there was less bacon per piece. I also found that baking took longer than anticipated. The moisture in the oysters slowed the cook time so I had to keep them in for quite a bit longer but they came out fine. NOTE: that means you could make a little ahead and keep them warm pretty easily.  Plan on using the larger round toothpicks. The small ones made it difficult to put it all together.   They were not the top choice hit of the party but they were popular. I definitely will make them again.

Wonderful! The oysters I bought were huge and I wrapped them in Applewood Smoked Bacon. Seasoned with Tony Chacheres and used Jezebel Sauce as a dip - delicious!

I don't eat oysters, so this review is based on my father, boyfriend and boyfriend's son reactions- they loved them!  A big success- they were gone as soon as the picture was taken.  I cooked the bacon on a griddle first, until it was a bit cooked, but still pliable (I was afraid the oysters would be over done or the bacon would be raw without precooking it a bit).  Also, I did not measure out the spices, I just sprinkled on what I thought was a good amount.  Some of the bigger oysters took longer to cook than the smaller ones, so they had to be put back in the oven for a couple more minutes.  Overall, everyone was happy and gave it two thumbs up!

I found that 10 minutes was not enough time for very thin bacon.mine took 15 minutes to get the topside done and another 10 for the bottom.

Yum! So easy to make too.  I used a jar of freshly shucked oysters and they were the perfect size to wrap.  I also skipped the spices and just used creole seasoning.
