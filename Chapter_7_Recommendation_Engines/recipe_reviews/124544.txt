Outstanding!  This was by far the best pot roast I have EVER made....  Wonderful does not even begin to describe it!!!  I was hesitant after reading the ingredients, but they came together beautifully.  NOTE:  If you do not like a sweet sauce/meat this is not the recipe for you....   HELPFUL HINTS:  This recipe works just as well in the crockpot as the oven.  Lightly brown the meat on all sides and though any chutney might do, USE a hot mango/peach chutney as it seems to be the key in pulling together the complexity of flavors.  I pureed the raisins and onions that did not cook "down", and added them back to the crock pot.  I then took some of the liquid from the pot and added corn starch for thickner.  As soon as it started thickening, I added cups of the remaining broth to make the gravy which absolutely enhanced the flavor.  I let it bubble for a minute or two, then added a small shake of cinammon to the gravy and continued to let it cook.  I have served this separately over noodles and jasmine rice and loved it both ways.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.  The aroma alone permeates the whole house.....  Wonderful!!!!

Very good and very easy.  I cooked in the crockpot. Threw in all ingredients and cooked on low for 7 hours.
GREAT GRAVY!

I enjoyed this very much.  The whole family did.  I didn't have chutney or raisins on hand (don't really care for raisins in cooked foods) and it was still very good.

Made this without the raisins, and per another reader' suggestion, used hot mango chutney.  It was really good.

I use a very similar recipe taken from a 1949 Woman's Home Companion Cookbook. MY recipe doesn't call for curry or chutney. It does use 1/2 c raisins,2 sliced onions, beef broth, 1 clove minced garlic and 2 bay leaves. I make pan gravy from the drippings. The gravy is dark and very rich. I made this last night and it was wonderful. I will use the leftovers tonight for enchiladas.

Didn't have nor have I ever used chutney before...and I used Craisins instead of raisins because that was what I had.
that said, this recipe was FANTASTIC! Why didn't I think of using the dutch oven sooner? I've been using the "bag method" and it's never turned out right. 
This was soooooooo tender.
I ended up turning the heat down to 300 and roasting it longer, as I read this was what you should do for the cheaper cuts to ensure more tenderness.

Excellent flavor and a nice change for a roast.  I made a few changes. Added 1/8 tsp paprika, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper and a couple dashes cinnamon.  After browning, placed in 13x9 pan with sauce,covered 2 directions with heavy duty foil and cooked at 300 for 4 1/2 hours.  Turned the oven off until I was ready for dinner.  Thickened sauce by adding 1 beef bouillin cube and flour over med heat.  This made for an excellent gravy with a spicey beef flavor.  This will be one of our favorites.

Not the same old spices and flavors, but still not too far out.  The house smelled wonderful and the roast disappeared.  Definitely one of the better recipes I've tried. Make it just as written, no changes needed.

The ingredients looked a little odd, but I figured all these five star reviews couldn't be wrong. I'm glad I tried it - it was delicious! I didn't have any chutney, so I added extra onions and about a teaspoon each of sugar and vinegar.

I added things at the wrong time, put in too much broth by accident, had to use a mixture of scallions and onion flakes and this was still one of the best roasts I have ever produced. Leftovers were gone by noon the next day.

I wasn't sure about this because of the raisins and I also have a very picky family...but...I got RAVE'S about this roast.  I used hot mango chutney as it didn't say which one to use.  No leftovers at my house.

This is an excellent recipe.  No changes made to this at all except the second time I added a little more beef stock because I was using a lot of vegetables & used peach/mango chutney instead of regular.   Thank you for submitting.

I wasn't so sure about this recipe when I read it because it has such different ingredients then I've encountered in a roast but this was really amazing.  My whole family loved it.  I didn't have chutney so I didn't use that but I am looking forward to making this again with the chutney.  Great flavor, tastes like indian food but without all the fussing around I equate with indian cooking.

Delish! I used hot mango chutney and omitted raisins. Didn't have ginger so I followed a previous reviewer's tip and added a dash of cinnamon. After browning, I threw it in the crock pot with potatoes and carrots, and doubled the sauce. I was so sick of my usual, boring pot roast, and this is the perfect antidote! Definitely the yummiest thing to come out of my crockpot in a while!

you have got to be kidding!!! This is such a delicious, and tasty pot roast I have EVER EVER tasted!!!! I didn't have regular chutney, but substituted it with mango chutney, you have got to make this.  It deserves a 5 star- this best is the best pot roast I have ever ever made.

This was wonderful!!!  I was a bit scared by the indredients.  But I went out and found chutney (after figuring out what it was!) and used the spicy mango flavor.  I followed the recipe as stated.  My two year old son loved it and so did my husband and I.  The only thing I would do differently is cook it slower and longer since I bought a cheaper cut of meat.  Overall GREAT!  Thanks!

I have made this many times and it is one of our favorites.  If you have a Wegman's grocery store (although Safeway often has it too), you can find a wonderful Hot Mango Chutney that just adds to the overall flavor.  I make it in a Le Crueset Doufeu (pot with lid) I bought for another allrecipes recipe - it is delicious and the aroma is great (assuming you like curry:-).

Really great flavor I used a mango chutney which gave it a sweet flavor. I was really surprised at how well this came out. The Honey roasted red potatoes worked great for a side for this dish

One of family's favorite roast to make.  I was a little hesitant the first time making this because of the unusual mix of flavors but it all works great together! I throw all the ingredients (minus the oil) in a crock pot with some carrots and potatoes and let it cook. Also as one reviewer suggested i use a hot mango chutney.

I have never made pot roast before it was my first time and i was cooking for 5 hungry guys...and myself the serving size was on point and the flavor was delish!! All the guys in the house LOVED it! The smell is awesome as one review read. I used mild mango chutney by kerala curry found at harris teeter for about $4. i didnt have the dutch oven i used a tinted glass dish lightly covered with foil...

All I can say is wow!  I made this for my book club and everyone raved about it.  My husband said he prefers my standard pot roast recipe, but he's nuts!  In my opinion this blows my regular recipe out of the water!  I'll definitely be making it again.

My husband and kids could not stop raving about this roast. Additionally, I am not a roast fan.  Never have been.  But I was sopping up ever but of the juice I could.  YUMMY!   I didn't have the chutney but it didn't matter.  I didn't add the raisins either.  I did what others suggested by browning the meat first and then placing the roast in a crockpot.  (I was  looking for a crockpot recipe in the first place.)  I also cooked the onions in oil before adding them to the crockpot.  Not sure if that ultimately made a difference.  Thank you Frances for sharing such a yummy dinner.  Everyone agrees that this is a definite do-over.

This roast is incredibly easy and unbelievably delish!  I made it for a group of friends one night and it was gone in an instant.  Half of our dinner discussion was about how good the roast was!!  I highly recommend it.  And it's ideal for beginner cooks to really wow their guests!

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  Made it exactly as written except I cooked it for 6 hrs on low in the crock pot.  Served it with rice pilaf the first night and with soft polenta a couple of days later.  It was wonderful.  Next time I'm going to make my own chutney as it is easy to make in the bread machine of all things.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Amazing! This was my first time making a pot roast and I decided to break in our new crock pot. (It was also my first time using one of those!) I don't like spicy foods, so I used a sweet mango chutney instead of hot. I also used Turmeric instead of curry powder and a pinch of Cheyenne pepper. Browned the meat on the stove and put everything in the crock pot. After 7 hours, I mixed corn starch with cool water and put it in the pot to thicken the gravy more. My boyfriend and neighbors could not get enough! Everyone went back for 2nds and 3rds. Not a morsel left! This one's a keeper!

Wow, I added the paprika and cayenne as another reviewer suggested and it was the best ever. I also tossed in some chopped carrots, parsnips and mushrooms. Sweet but not too much, heat but just the right amount. Perfect with mashed potato and green beans. A very rich gravy and tender beef. Will make again soon!

Outstanding! I dont give 5 stars generously on this site and this one really impressed me. Unusual ingredients come together to make a savory pot roast that melts in your mouth. I think it is only fair to rate a recipe that has been made as originally written and NOT with my modifications. I only omitted the chutney because I didnt have any and made NO substitutions and cooked as directed in a dutch oven. My roast was only 2 lbs and was falling apart, melt in your mouth tender after 2 hours in a Le Creuset dutch oven.
Dont skip the flour and browning step, it seals the juices in the meat and thickens the sauce as it cooks. ULTRA YUMMY as I say.... Try it.

After years of attempting to make the perfect pot roast, this one takes the cake!  It is the perfect blend of comfort food and curry.  I used apricot preserves instead of chutney, and tiit still turned out great.

This was awesome!!!  Easily the best roast I've ever had.  Even for leftovers, it was so moist I ate it plain on a hotdog bun and it tasted great - no sauce or anything!  I used a bone-in roast and spiced mango chutney from Walmart.

The family really enjoyed this pot roast. It was a bit sweet, but that sweetness, and the surprising combination of flavors suited a plate of rice perfectly.

I absolutely loved how beautifully this turned out! So tender! Glad I browned it first. I didn't care to thicken up the gravy too much. It was good somewhat loose. I'm sure I'll make this again. My whole family enjoyed and I felt proud. Thanks for this recipe!

AWESOME! This roast was a huge hit and even my husband ate it and he doesn't like "pot roast". He actually asked for me to make another one for a special occasion the same week! I had to alter the recipe slightly by using a homemade chutney since I had none on hand and cant find it in the grocery stores locally. I used Homemade strawberry preserves and heated them in a pot with 1/4 c onions, 2 TBSP balsamic vinegar, 2 TBSP lemon juice, and 1/8 c sugar. I simmered this while I was preparing the roast and then added the rest of the ingredients to the pot while the chutney was still simmering then poured it over the roast in the crock pot and cooked it for 6 hours. It was SO tender and SO yummy! Highly recommended and I don't do that often! :)

This was very good and moist.  I didn't have chutney so cut up a ripe mango and it was fine.  I liked the hint of curry without being overpowering.

I followed it exactly.  It was very good but a bit on the sweet side for our tastes.  Next time I'll not include the ginger, I think.  I crockpotted it and made gravy out of the sauce.  Served with roasted potatoes and carrots and freshly baked bread.  Yum!

Wow, this turned out fantastic!  The only changes I made was that I put it all in the crock pot and I used rice flour since we're gluten free.  I used a grass fed organic chuck roast and it came out very very tender.

Best Pot Roast I have ever had. The ingredients blended so well specially in the crock pot (7 hrs on low). The chutney made the sauce nice and thick. I used 2 cups broth for my 1.5 to 2 lbs chuck roast (just like more sauce specially when it's yummy - perfect over steamed rice).

Fantastic.  Followed recipe exaclty.  Used mango chutney.  Served with shallot mashed potatoes (brown thinly-sliced shallots in butter until brown, add cream, s&p, and warm, then mash with potatoes).  A recipe that takes little effort, but produces excellent results.  DELICIOUS!

Excellent recipe. My husband and son loved.  I did not use raisins but added mushrooms.  Placed carrotts into pot for last hour.   Oven roasted potatoes on side and placed in pot when I pulled from pen.  Let sit for 15 minutes and fantastic!!!!   Will definitely make this again

My husband is not a big fan of pot roast.  When he smelled it in the oven he called me and said, "If this tastes as good as it smells, it should be terrific".   Well it did.  It was terrific.  I did use fresh garlic since I do not keep garlic powder in my cupboard and the chutney I had on had was apple and cranberry.  It was served over penne pasta.

This is an absolutely delicious dish.  I am not a fan of "chuck" pot roast but had it in my freezer.   The flavors are exotic and rich; very balanced flavors.  Despite the fact that it is a cheap cut of meat it is definitely company worthy.  I will make again for sure.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

WOW.....WHAT A WONDERFUL RECIPE!!! So used to "boring" pot roast with onion mix and gravy. Decided to take a chance and try this exotic recipe out. SO GLAD I DID!!! This is a gourmet tasting meal.  Cooked in a dutch oven, meat came out fork tender. Plum chutney added amazing depth of flavor and the raisins were a subtly sweet touch. Served with red potatoes and carrots.  This is an elegant meal which will truly impress friends & family. BON APPETIT;)

This was soooo good and so easy to make. My two year old gobbled it up and so did we! The meat was very very tender. I used apple pear chutney and followed the recipe to a T. Definitely going into the rotation.

Best roast I have ever made, and it was just different enough than a traditional beef recipe that the family really noticed and loved it.  I made a stew with the leftovers the next night (including the gravey that I made,) and the family asked for it again.  They rarely do that.  I don't think I added much in the way of seasonings to the stew the next night.  I am now granting the request and preparing this again.

Let me begin by saying that, aside from the roast and the flour and oil, I had none of the ingredients for this recipe. I used French onion soup instead of beef broth, no onion, garlic cloves inserted in the roast instead of garlic powder, and a dash of cinnamon, thyme, paprika, and cumin. It turned out amazing! I added about 1/3 a cup of red cooking wine for the extra gravy and the taste was rich and delicious. This is a very forgiving recipe and easy to improvise with!

Very tasty dish and quite easy to prepare. The recipe called for chutney however it did not specify the type so I opted for tomato chutney. At prep time I discovered that I was out of curry powder and ground ginger.  I supbstituted fresh grated ginger and red thai curry paste. Delicious.

I have to say I was pretty disappointed with this recipe.  I followed it perfectly and it filled the house with such a great aroma that I was expecting a lot of flavor.  It turned out to be suprisingly tasteless.  It's not easy to make either...

I made this roast tonight in my slow cooker.  Although the ingredients were a little strange, it was excellent.  I love curries and was expecting the gravy to be more like a curry than traditional gravy, but it was more traditional than I expected.  I served it with a Persian rice and lentils from this site, but next time I would do mashed potatoes.  If you're using a slow cooker I would reduce the beef broth to one cup, but keep the spices the same.  Excellent--can't wait for leftovers.

My German boyfriend thought this was delicious. I used a chuck roast, and when done, took it out, shredded it, then added it back to the broth. I enjoyed the leftovers when the sauce had intensely flavored the meat. No changes necessary. Served it with sauteed cabbage. Great comfort meal.

This recipe was excellent!  Followed the instructions to a tee.  Added a little red cayenne pepper to the flour mixture.  After the baking was done, took the roast out of the dutch oven, put it on the stove at medium-high heat and added corn starch to make gravy.
The flavors in this dish knocked my socks off!!

This is a great new way to have roast.  I will definitly be making this again.  I think I will cut out the step of putting flour on the roast and browning it.  It just doesn't seem necessary and I want to cut the calories by not using flour.  I cooked it in the crock pot for about 6 hours.  Delicious.

I enjoyed this but my husband thought it was too sweet. My changes were no curry, adding craisins instead of raisins, adding 2 bay leaves and using peach preserves because I didn't have chutney. The slow cooker made it nice and tender.

This pot roast was delicious!  It was a flavorful, comforting meal for a chilly evening.  My husband ate his with rice and I enjoyed mine with garlic mashed potatoes.    I made a couple of modifications--I didn't have chutney on hand, nor the raisins, so I improvised and chopped up a large gala apple and added that to the mixture.  I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder (about 2 tablespoons).  I also added about 2 tablespoons of paprika.  I added extra onions for flavor (I put in about one and a half large onions).  Instead of using a dutch oven, I used my crockpot.  I added 32 oz of beef broth and let it "crock" on high for 6 hours.  The beef was fabulous that evening, and even better the next day when we cooked it again for another hour and-a-half on the stove in a large saucepan.

This is an excellent dish. My only change is that I use fresh garlic and fresh ginger. It's even better the next day. Plan on making it for a casual party and serving on rolls.

Very tasty, I put mine in the crock pot and let it cook on low 6-8 hours. About  2 hours before it's done I dump in a 16oz bag of baby carrots. I also use 4 cups of beef broth. I double the seasonings as well. Yummy with homemade mashed potatoes.

With all the rave reviews, I thought I would also try this despite the odd ingredients. We were not satisfied with it as a pot roast. The next day we ate it like pulled pork sandwiches and it worked since it was so sweet. But, we will not make this again.

Very good recipe.  I actually cooked this in my slow cooker all day.  I had a 4 lb. chuck roast which I salted and peppered, seared all sides in my pan and didn't bother to put flour on it at all.  I then put the meat in my crock pot and put the rest of the ingredients and cooked all day.  After 6 hours, I shredded the beef and put it back in the crock pot to absorb all the flavors.  When we had dinner around 7 PM, it was very juicy, moist and flavorful.  A keeper recipe.

Haven't made this in a while, so I made it today. I think that this is the BEST recipe for roast that we have ever made. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe, it's sooo yummy. The only things that we changed were that we didn't put in the beef broth, instead we used water just because we are trying to stay away from salt, and we use moose roast instead of beef roast. THANK-YOU!!

I, like others was skeptical when I read the ingredients, but the overwhelming number of great ratings made me give it a shot.  It was excellent.  The best pot roast I have had.  My husband agreed.  I made it per the recipe exactly.  Wouldn't change a thing!

Truthfully, I thought this recipe sounded disgusting. But the ratings were so high I decided to try it anyway.  I made the recipe exactly as described and oh my goodness was it delicious!!  I am so glad I tried this and will make it over and over.  I even made it for a large winter dinner party and it was a huge (and inexpensive!) hit.  Give it a try!

I'll never make pot roast in brown gravy again!!! This was SUPERB!   I made a few modifications- because I always like to get two meals out of one "cook."  I doubled all the sauce ingredients and the size of the roast. I will serve again tomorrow, but pull the remaining beef apart into the sauce and cook for another hour or so. I will serve this 'pulled beef' on crusty rolls with a tangy cole slaw on top.   Another very minor modification I made was to use currants instead of 75% of the raisins- they are smaller and blend in a bit better- for those with misgivings about raisins. :c)  This recipe is the best I've found on this site, bar-none!

Great recipe.  Very exotic flavors, almost Moroccan with the sweet (raisins) and spices (ginger, curry.)  I didn't have chutney, so I just added some vinegar and cranberries, turned out great!  I also added some baby carrots to get in some veggies.  My husband loved it, said it should be a Christmas/winter staple, a great comfort meal!

This an unusual and tasty way to make pot roast.  I've tried it with a couple of different types of chutney, but so far my favorite is with cranberry chutney.  Also highly recommend throwing some fresh carrots and potatoes into the pot for the last 1 1/2 hours of cooking.

This recipe is a winner!  I did make some changes.  I didn't have chutney or the raisins.  I chopped 3 small onions, used a can of french onion soup, added about a half can of water, and kept the seasonings the same.  I added baby carrots and new potatoes to the pan and baked about 3 hrs.  My husband said it was the best pot roast he had ever eaten!  This is our new favorite, and I will be definately be making this again soon.  Perfect for a fall dinner!

I was looking for a good recipe to use up a random bottle of pear chutney. This was delicious!  I made this using a chuck roast in the slow cooker and cooked for about 8 hours (adding potatoes and carrots halfway).  The beef was very tender and flavorful.

This is a delicious recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing it.  I made it with cranberries instead of raisins, and no chutney, and it still turned out amazing and so tender.  My whole family was raving about it and now they think I'm an awesome cook.  No knives were needed!

This recipe turned out excellently. Wonderful flavor, and looked nice. My wife was not a fan of the raisins that plumped as the roast cooked; however, she said that it was still really good and the kids loved it as well. Will make again with perhaps a substitute for the raisins.

First time I made this it was incredible.  My MIL who is an excellent cook raved (which doesn't always come easy!).    The second time I made it I didn't get the same flavor.  Not sure why and will attempt to make again tomorrow.  I follow the recipe to a tee but do cook in a crock pot as I love the roast to fall apart.  Don't omit the raisins.  The flavor of the chutney, raisins, curry and ginger is what makes this so wonderful.  It is such a balanced flavor.   I bet my problem the 2nd time was not adjusting the ingredients to a larger cut of meat.   That would be it.

Omitted raisins.  If you have trouble finding chutney, it is next to the BBQ sauce, at least in my grocery store.  I used a 4.25 lb. chuck roast that was trussed.  It took a little over four hours in the dutch oven.  Don't rush it if it is not tender enough- let it cook another half hour and try it again.  

Gravy was out of this world.  Only took a couple of minutes to thicken with some cornstarch.

Served with garlic mashed potatoes and some steamed asparagus.  Also threw some baby carrots in with the roast the last 45 min.  

Have tried a lot of ways to season a pot roast but this is my favorite and will not try any other recipes.

This was tender and tasty.  I was concerned about the ingredients, but had to try it because of all the five star ratings.  It was one of the best roasts I have made.
It is a sweet sauce, but works well with the meat.  I may try it with a different chutney, or without, for variation.
However, it is great as is.  My son even left off the ketchup!

Followed the directions as indicated, substituted pitted dates for raisins because that is what I had in the pantry. Yummy and easy - super flavourful - good gravy consistency with all the flour added.

I've made this several times now, each time in the crock pot.  Seven hours later, voila--one fantastic pot roast!  I use either chuck roast or rump roast, whichever's on sale at Whole foods.  In the slow cooker a chuck roast turns out nice and tender.  If you can spare the extra money, though, the rump roast is leaner and has a nice clean flavor.  I like to use two cloves of garlic and less garlic powder, but otherwise, this recipe is perfect as is (and I'm not much of a meat-eater)!

I left out the raisins and chutney as well.  I simply coated the roast with the seasoned flour, browned in a dutch oven all sides well in a hot pan.  Sprinkled the spices on (garlic, ginger, curry and 2 sachets of beef bouillon instead of broth) and then poured water overtop.  Cooked it in my convection toaster oven for 2-2 1/2 hours and it was very good.  Skipping the browning in the dutch oven will eliminate the yummy crust, which is kinda dumb.  ;)

This is my first review but I could not let this go by without telling you how much my family and I loved this.  Sounds strange and my family has strange eating likes and dislikes.  100% rave reviews.  Loved it and will make again.

This was wonderful! I just purchased a Le Creuset oval dutch oven and I used this recipe to break it in. I basically prepared as directed but I used "sweet ancho chili relish" instead of chutney and craisins instead of raisins.  I also added red potatoes and baby carrots the last hour of cooking.  Delicious!

After all of the positive reviews, I was really looking forward to making this pot roast.  And it was very good, but the depth of flavor I expected from the exotic ingredients wasn't quite there.  I would definitely make this again, but I think I'd use more of everything, and use a chunkier chutney than the Crosse & Blackwell Major Grey's mango chutney I had in the cupboard.  The combination of the fruit and beef was excellent.

Finally, a "pot roast" recipe my husband loves.  In fact, all of us, including my 3 young children loved it. Sadly, no leftovers.  I didn't have any chutney so I subbed sweet & sour sauce.  Did not use any flour (gluten free!) and did not brown the meat - just threw everything in the crock pot on low until tender - about 5 hours.  Served with rice.  Try it!

We loved this recipe.  I had my doubts, but wow.  So tender and flavorful.  I made my own chutney and it was good, but I used a little too much.  Also, we like spicy and I thought it could use a little more heat.  My dad who doesn't try anything different or ethnic at all (sushi, no way) loved this.

Great flavor!  I didn't have chutney, so used some sugar and vinegar as suggested by another reviewer.  It was fabulous, and made a wonderful gravy.  I'll definitely make this again.  The only thing I'll change next time is to take it out sooner.  It was a tad overdone at 3 hours, even though it was a large roast.

Fantastic and easy in a slow cooker!  I used leftover sirloin steaks, so I didn't brown the beef, and put all the ingredients together in the slow cooker.  I added carrots and red potato, substituted dried cranberries for the raisins, substituted 1/2 tsp sugar + 1/2 tsp vinegar for 1 tsp chutney, and added extra broth, salt, and spices to compensate for the potatoes.  I have no idea if this is as good as the original, but it was fantastic and worked with what I had (I LOVED the cranberries).  Note:  Curry powder includes tumeric, garlic, cayenne (red) pepper, coriander, celery, fenugreek

First time making this.  I used a 2.1 pound beef roast and followed the recipe exactly except I used a slow cooker for 7 hours.  I used an Indian mango, fruit and nut chutney which had a sweet (not hot) flavor and I also used golden raisins.  This is indeed a very nice beef roast.  Thanks!

Very tasty! Different then the usual standby pot roast recipe. I used Trader Joe's mango ginger chutney, that already had golden raisins in it. Went wonderful with the spices. I had to double everything since I used a 6lb chuck roast. Cooked on low for 8 hrs in my crock pot. YUM!

This is one amazing Roast.  AS it was cooking in the dutch oven, the aroma that was coming from my kitchen was soooo yummy, but it did not even compare the flavor that this roast gave.  I dont think I can ever go back to my same old roast again. Thanks!

Oh, this was soooooo good! Curried roast beef - yummm. Next time I will double the sauce because the roast dried a little by the end. This recipe is definitely a keeper - THANKS!

This recipe is amazing!  If you're tired of the same old pot roast with onion soup mix and cream of mushroom soup, then you have to try this! The only change I made was golden raisins instead of regular.  It was so easy, too. This is definitely a company-coming-over recipe!

A fantastic pot roast. I've never made a pot roast before and had people coming over. This was an easy one to make. I would consider myself an "open a can" or "follow the instructions on the box" kind of cook and even I could do this. All our guests loved this dish and have called to ask for the recipe. You can't go wrong with this pot roast.

Wonderful!  I used green tomato chutney I made last fall.  Didn't change any of the spices but added carrots and new potatoes after two hours.  Delicious!

This is a very good recipe with great flavor.  I added baby carrots and potatoes for the last hour and they were wonderful.  I used a rump roast & I think it really needed to be cooked longer, it wasn't as tender as I would have liked.  I don't have a dutch oven and used a glass bakind dish covered with foil so I don't know if this may have been the reason it wasn't as tender as I would have liked.  Other than that it was great!  Will definitely use this recipe again!

Pretty good...the spices are very suble.  I made the roast in the crock pot and left it on low for about 8 hours.  I increased the broth by one cup, decreased the raisins to a quarter cup and left out the chutney.  The gravy was very good!

I have made this pot roast several times, always using my slow cooker instead of baking in the oven.  I leave out the flour to make it gluten-free.  It's very good, and the leftovers are perfect for a beef curry dish.

Sooo amazing! I made this to show my mom that she does not make a good pot roast. Hers always comes out dry and lacking salt and seasonings. I made this for her and she said that was the best pot roast shes ever had. It is a favorite of mine too! Only thing is I hate rasins so I didnt add those. But still... absoulutely amazing!

Yum. I prepared the roast as the recipe stated, and threw some chopped sweet potatoes and kohlrabi on top of it for the final two hours of roasting. Phenomenal.

There is something that happens with this pot roast that makes it more tender than the "regular" pot roast we love. I used the same cut of beef I always use (3 lbs. Black Angus, london broil cut) cooked the same length of time, but it was so very tender and moist.
     I added no vegetables to the roasting pan, but served the roast with frozen petite peas sauteed in butter and mixed into boiled brown Basmati rice. Piled the rice and peas next to the meat and spooned the gorgeous brown sauce and raisins over. Sprinkled on some toasted almond slivers and served with a side of pureed winter squash. Made a meal to anticipate having again!
     Fantastic recipe. Next time I want to try making one of the mango chutneys from this site.

Sweet, but my family really liked it.  I cooked it for 2hours. Then I put the sauce through my fat separator and used wondra flour to thicken it a bit.

I followed the recipe exactly and the meat came out lovely and tender.  We like curry, but this sauce had a very strange taste. I ended up making some instant gravy to have the meat.  Would not make this again.

I was so dissapointed that it burned but it still tasted okay, I would love to try it agian since it had to many great reviews. But...what did I do wrong, thanks.

This was SO good--it really might be one of my favorite dishes ever.  I was a little nervous about it because of the curry and chutney, but the whole family LOVED it, even my non-raisin loving husband.  I made it as is in the crockpot  except that I added a little cayenne and put in some baby carrots toward the end, and served it with mashed potatoes.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This roast has a delightfully sweet, warm flavor! I pureed the raisins and added carrots and finglerling potatoes for the last hour. 

My husband had seconds and it's tough to get him to try anything with curry.

This is so yummy. Even my husband said it was good and he doesn't like pot roast. My sauce was very thick and gooey and stuck to the pan but I could fix that we some water or taking it out earlier. Will definitely make again.

soooo easy soooo yummy.  flouring and browning the meat on the outside really holds in the juices.  i did it in an iron skillet.  also, i could not find chutney so i left it out the first time.  the raisins or craisins are a MUST.  trying it w/ chutney tonight...i'm sure it will be even better.

I was weary about some of the ingredients, but needless to say it was really good. I didn't have any chutney or ginger, but it still came out really good and very tender. I will be adding this to my recipe box.

This was great! I didn't have any chutney but it was still good. I cooked it for 2 hrs and it was very well done, still moist though :)  My 3 yr old loved it and ate just the "gravy" when there wasn't any meat left.

Have to say that this was very bland for me and my family. Hardly any flavor at all and it didn't really soak in and flavor the meat like I am used to it doing in my slow cooker. I will never make this again.

What a great tasting roast!  I had to change a few ingredients, simply because I didn't have them all.  I used craisins and dried apricots instead of raisins, and I used pepper jelly instead of chutney becuase my local grocery stores don't carry chutney, and I threw in carrots, celery, and a potato for the last hour and a half of cooking.  Dutch oven cooking is the way to go, the roast was so tender and was falling apart- very good cold weather meal!

I did not have chutney but I used some of the remainder of the "Fruit Salsa" I had made up from another recipe with high marks (was a top 20) on this site. Great great great flavor! Turned out perfect, tender, delicious and I dont even like roast.

I didn't have chutney, so I just omitted.  Also, I am successful with a Chuck Shoulder roast, when using other roasts it is not as tender.

I know this has gotten many good reviews, but I made this exactly according to the recipe, except I cooked all day in a crock pot instead of putting it in the oven.  We have a family of 5 and we unanimously voted it a 1.  Didn't like the overly sweet taste at all.  Bummer, because I made enough to have leftovers!

My skeptical hubby actually loved this!  I didn't have chutney on hand either, but I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  I'm not going to do that next time, but rather, buy the chutney.  The smell in your house is wonderful, especially when it's raining outside.

My family went on and on.  My two little girls has 3rd helpings.  I simplified it a bit no chutney in my small town, used spices light on the salt and put large can cream mushroom soup, made perfect thick gravy right out of the pan

I try to rate recipes based on the original, but it must be noted that I have a huge tendency to eye-ball measurements.  With that being said, the only real changes I made was to use fresh mined garlic instead of powdered and olive oil instead of regular cooking oil.  Also, I ran out of raisins, so I substituted craisins. Ultimately, this turned out lovely.  The meat was tender and the "sauce" was full of flavor.  My roast was not quite 2lbs, so cook time was approx 2hrs (could have used a little less time, but no complaints).  I don't know if was supposed to do this, but the "sauce" was more like a sticky yummy topping - which I'm sure could have been thinned to make a delicious chunky gravy, but I didn't see any need.  My 14 yr old son, who can be annoyingly teenagerly picky, loved it.  Since my hubby was working late, our son and I made sandwiches with the meat.  I don't plan to make any changes to this recipe next time I make it.  The type of chutney may make a difference, though.

Great roast! I browned the roast in a pan, then placed in the slow cooker for 7 hours on low. I also didn't have any chutney, so I added extra onions. Perfect and pulled apart with a fork, thank you!

Everytime I make this it's gone the next day,use a cheap cut of meat, the longer you cook in a slow cooker, the more tender it is!

Fantastic! We omitted the raisins and used a slightly cinnamony peach chutney. Then we threw a few carrots into the pot as well. This recipe resulted in flavour we've never experienced before in a pot roast. Highly recommended!

This was delicious - I had to add more beef broth, however. Also, I added carrots 2 hours before completion and served on top of egg noodles. I ran out of ginger so substituted allspice. Very simple.

I have made this recipe several times over the years and it is always a big hit.  It has a wonderful sweet and spicy flavor and is a really nice dish and is perfect for Christmas Eve or holidays as it feeds a lot of hungry family members!  Really yummy!

My husband's favorite dish I make! 4 stars only because I think 3 hours is too long - it get's really dry after that long. 2 - 2.5 hours makes for a better, moister roast.

Great recipe, I made some changes, I omitted the chutney and raisins. I forgot to defrost the roast so I followed the instructions but I cooked the roast for 4 1/2 hours, and I added a bag of frozen brussel sprouts, the roast was so tender and the brussel sprouts roasted very nicely, paired together well.

Absolutely great! It looks a little weird from the ingredient list, but it's amazing. Leaves the meat with a subtle sweet taste and a lot of flavor. I add red wine to my stock, and as some others substitute more onions and vinegar for chutney.

2 Words...AH MAZING!! So much better than anything in the crockpot. I didn't use rasins or ginger and I used beef consume instead of beef broth. WOW!!! I will definately cook this again!
