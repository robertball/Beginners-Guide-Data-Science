I omitted the bell peppers and cilantro and Baked uncovered at 375 degrees for 23 minutes and it turned out perfect!

I made this last night.  It was very tasty.  I did make a few changes.  I used banana peppers instead of Jalapenos, only because that was what I had on hand.  When I make it again, I will make a point to get Jalapenos.  I mixed the fresh veggies with olive oil, lime juice and kosher salt, fresh pepper, then I put a splash of Louisiana Hot Sauce in the mixture. Topped the fillets with Cajun seasonings and cheddar blend of shredded cheese. It turned out really well, my husband and 12 year old son loved it!  Will definitely make again!  Thanks Cheri!

I used mini sweet peppers instead of green peppers, then added minced garlic and sliced zucchini to the vegetable mix. I didn't have the creole seasonings so I used lemon pepper. It was very good. We liked that the vegetables were crunchy we served it with cilantro lime rice.

This was really tasty. I cut the quantities in half since it was just for my husband and me. I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes  covered in aluminum foil then did 5 minutes with the foil off. I liked how the vegetables still had a crispness to them.

Liked the flavor but the cooking time didn't work... even did an additional 10 min at 350 and it still wasn't cooked all the way through.

I made this and we loved it!  I left out the jalapenos  because my husband doesn't like recipes too spicy,  used about half the cheese for caloric purposes.  I served it with Mexican rice.  Delish!

I omitted the cheese but this was a terrible dish. The fish was still cold and the veggies raw. I had to up the temperature to 350 and cook for 20 minutes more.

It was so easy and quick to prepare, had a lot of flavor. Next time I am going to try it with diced green Chile instead of jalapeno. Loved it!
