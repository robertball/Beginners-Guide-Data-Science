I thought that I could help with some of the problems that people are having with making these cookies.  My family has been making these at Christmas for generations.  We don't melt any chocolate chips for the cookie dough though.  The recipe that we use is very similar. The only other changes are twice as much butter, twice the flour, omitting the baking powder and adding 1 tsp. baking soda. The mini peppermint patties we leave whole.  Chilling the dough for two hours will help alot.  Wrap the dough around the patty and then put the shaped cookies in the refrigerator to chill again while the oven preheats.  Baking this on parchment lined baking sheets helps also.  I hope this helps others.  I know that there is alot of prep involved but the cookies are great.

This is a really great recipe.  I used Peppermint "Bites" for this but would also use Jr. Mints.  Instead of wrapping the dough around the mint, I just pushed one into the top of the dropped dough.  This way they came out perfect, no leaking and a great big mint-chocolate centre.  I do not use the icing sugar as it would be hard to roll this batter into a ball.  I drop by TBSP onto a cookie sheet so it makes about 18 cookies.  Really easy and very yummy. Try it!

I made these cookies twice because they didn't turn out too well the first time.  Tips:  1) Do not use Jr. Mints in place of Peppermint Patties.  Jr. Mints have a more liquid center and will leak out of the cookie dough, making a big mess and making the dough crunchy- almost candy like.  2) Prepare dough and chill it for a half hour to an hour before attempting to wrap it around the quartered peppermint pattie.  3) Use parchment paper when baking to keep cookies from sticking to cookie sheet.

Really good!  I used Jr. Mints instead of peppermint patty.  They tend to stick to pan, Silpat liner solved the problem!

This was a really good recipe except I had to add about a cup of extra flour. I also found out you have to roll the balls pretty large to avoid the peppermint from leaking out. I decided on a no go for the powdered sugar as it wouldn't last on the cookie more than a day or so. I used regular semi-sweet chocolate chips since the York patty was pepperminty enough for me. It's been a hit so far though, and I plan on keeping this cookie as part of my cookie tin.

I have used this recipe quite a few times now and I have tried making this a couple of different ways.  I also could not find mint chips so I used semi sweet and added peppermint extract until they were to my liking.  I have also found that if you don't want that minty mess all over your cookie sheets then you have to make your cookies bigger.  I only get about 2 dozen cookies, but I have not had the melted mess problem since I made them bigger. I also used spoons to get the peppermint patty in the center so that I didn't get completely messy.  I also do not roll them a second time in the powdered sugar, I sprinkle the powdered sugar on with a flour sifter after baking them. I love this recipe and will use it again, and I only gave it 4 stars because these cookies are a chore to make, but if you are up to it, they are really yummy!

I have made these a few times.  You need to refrigerate the dough for a few hours.  I used the big York candy bar and cut big pieces and froze them before putting them in the center of the cookies.  This will eliminate any spreading.  Also this is a 9 minute cookie this way. Make a bigger cookie and be sure to cover your mint completely.  I didn't have any leakage. I used regular semi sweet chips in the sugar mixture and mini semi sweet in the dough.  I just thought that there was way too much mint in this recipe for my tastes. Great holiday cookie!  Thanks!

I have made this many time. I have gone one step further in reducing my holiday stress though. Although it is wonderful to make it all from scratch if you have the time, if you don't, don't worry! It works great using pilbury(or another brand) premade dough. I make balls out of the dough and bury about a half of a peppermint patty in the center. Then I roll the top in colored sugar for the holiday cheer. It's a favorite among my family and friends. I have to make it every year!

These are great cookies.  I could not find mint chocolate chips so I used regular and then added peppermint extract.  I found it best to refrigerate the dough for at least an hour before trying to roll the dough around the peppermint patty quarter.  I also used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 margarine.  I find using half and half makes great cookies.  These will be a hit.

Easy to make, not so easy to eat. Mine came out drippy, and got dried out really quickly. I followed the recipe exactly and was just not impressed.

A great cookie!  I make them year after year at Christmas time.  I make them exactly as the recipe calls for...but I have ran out of the mint segments that you put in the middle.( I doubled the recipe, but didn't have enough mint patties) So I made the rest just like normal cookies, and they turned out awesome!  So either way I love this recipe!  Thanks

These cookies taste great and are a holiday favorite in my family. The only problem is that they're a little messy to make. The dough is always too sticky. I guess adding more flour would help, but I've never tried it. No matter what, temporarily messy hands are a small price to pay for a delicious cookie!

I agree with some of the reviews. I just remade the recipe, only I added another full cup of flour and these cookies(if you like mint) are delicious.  They do look like the chocolate crinkle cookies some more sugar.  The first time I had Junior Mints and I used them.  They leaked all over the sil pad.  The second tiime I bought the smalerr York Patties and cut them in quarters and they were perfect.   No leakage.  I would use this recipe again, but be sure to add more flour and perhaps a bit more sugar to compensate for the additiional flour.

I found these cookies to be an absolute disaster.  The mints leaked all over the tray and I practically needed a blowtorch to remove the mess from the tray.

The only reason I give this recipe 4 stars instead of five, is the fine tuning of the flour.  These cookies are DELICIOUS!  Though I find you have to add at least a half a cup of extra flour, as some of the first batches I made turned into runny, gooey messes on the cookie sheet, the extra flour solved that problem.  I usually roll the cookies in granulated sugar first instead of powdered suger, makes them look even yummier.

These are terrific and I'll make them again. Everyone loved them - except those who don't like peppermint! They were a bit messy to make - the dough sticking to my hands when trying to cover the mint. I found that rolling them around in the powedered sugar in a bowl helped them to take shape instead of trying to make them round in my hands. Next time I'll make them smaller too. They spread so adhere to 1-1/2" apart. Thanks for this wonderful recipe...I'll make them every year!

I made these cookies with a friend of mine and we both agree that the did not live up to our expectations.  The mint spilled out, they didn't hold  their shape, and they were just overall very minty.  I felt that the mint was overpowering to the little amount of chocolate in the cookie.  We were not very happy with how they turned out.  It took a lot of time and was not quite worth the effort.  It was a good experience to try something new and very different.  We must admit if you love mint enough you may just enjoy this creation.

This recipe turned out to be a disaster.  The cookies spread and the mints melted into a gooey mess on the cookie sheet.  Dough was extremely sticky.  Ended up throwing the remaining batter and the gooey mess on the cookie sheets away.  Wish I had read the reviews before I tried these cookies.

This cookie was really good--I'll tell you about my mistake: I accidentally bought MINI chips instead of MINT chips.  They turned out pleasantly minty, but I'm interested to see how much more minty they are with the mint chips!  Also, I did add 1/2 cup more flour so they were easier to roll into balls.  They did spread out into a typical cookie shape, so I dusted them with powdered sugar instead of rolling after baking.  Even thought they didn't hold a ball shape, they looked pretty.  I think next time I'll add even more flour; I'd like them to stay in the ball shape.  The Peppermint Patty kind of melted throughout the inside of the cookie and it was nice to bite into a minty part throughout the whole cookie.  Overall, a thumbs up, even though I made a mistake!  :)

These chewy, minty, yummy cookies are a huge hit whenever I make them.  They've nearly replaced cakes as the birthday treat of choice in our family.  They're a bit time consuming, since you have to shape the dough around the peppermint patty, but well worth the effort!!

These cookies taste great! Like previously mentioned, add 1/2 cup of flour and use semisweet chocolate chips instead of mint chocolate chips to cut down the minty flavor a little. Also, line the pan with parchment paper to prevent sticking. One suggestion, use the new white and dark chocolate swirled chips to give the cookies a neat look. Enjoy!

Loved these cookies! They were a PITA to make, but so worth it. I added the extra 1/2 c. of flour, and I couldn't find mint chocolate chips, so I used regular chips and melted a few peppermint patties in with them. Worked just as well...The outside of the cookie was crispier than I liked, but they were still yummy. My husband ate most of them!  
I gave this recipe 4 stars, only because of the work it is to make them, and the crispiness of the outside of the cookie.

I took advice from the other posts and added another cup of flour to the recipe and the cookie kept a good shape and the peppermint patty did not melt everywhere. I also greased the pan. I did not add the melted mint chips to the dough nor did I add any others to the dough, instead I melted extra peppermint patties, a few milk chocolate chips, and a little bit of milk in a double boiler and coated the tops with that. The mixture was about the consistency of honey and it hardened on the tops after it was completely cooled. That way you don't have to cover them all and those who don't like mint as much can just eat the ones without the extra on top!

I couldn't find mint chips at my grocery, so I bought mini semisweet chocolate chips and peppermint extract. I melted the chocolate in a double boiler and added 1/4 tsp of the extract while the chips were melting. As per other ratings, I let the dough refrigerate for 1/2 hour to 1 hour before rolling into balls. The dough was still a little sticky, but nothing that was a pain to deal with. I found that a whole tablespoon of dough was a little too much as they do spread when baking, so I used about half of that. I didn't roll them in powdered sugar again after baking. This recipe made wonderful, soft cookies. That yummy melted patty in the center is just great! I didn't have a problem with any "gooey mess" on my cookie sheet either. I did use York Peppermint Patties and not the cheaper brand like others suggested. Everyone LOVED these cookies!!!!!

These cookies are excellent.  However, when I baked mine, they didn't stay in a ball, they spread to look like a "chocolate crinkle" cookie.  Therefore, I couldn't roll them in the powdered sugar after baking, so I just sprinkled some on.  They took a while to make, but if you like chocolate mint, it is worth it!

Delicious!!  These chocolate-y mint-y cookies are a HUGE holiday hit around my house.  A little time consuming to put the peppermint patty in each cookie, but well worth the effort!!!
