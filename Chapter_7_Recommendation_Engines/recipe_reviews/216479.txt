It tasted great but didn't make nearly enough to fill an 8in pan even half way. If I were to attempt to make it again I would double the recipe.

We love this! Doubled the recipe and I used milk chocolate chips (instead of semi-sweet) and Holiday Rice Krispies, as well I added some quartered candied cherries on top to decorate to make it really festive. Brought to a couple of gatherings and it was a hit (so quick and easy to make too!)

I doubled the recipe, added an extra cup of rice krispies and put it in a 9X13 pan, they were a little thin, but had a great flavor.

Review update (10-2-14):  I increased the recipe by one-half (making for much thicker pieces) and lined the pan with waxed paper.  I also made it Mexican-style by adding a good pinch each of ground cinnamon and cayenne pepper.  Delicious! 


First review:
Since I was trying this recipe just prior to Easter, I decided to make it white chocolate instead of semi-sweet.  I also added 2 tsp. of multi-colored nonpareils to make it more festive.  This is delicious.

These are the easiest thing to make besides the spritz cookies. They are also extremely additive. Thank-god I got that elliptical last year. They taste like fudgey goodness.
