Used two whole eggs, and 100% whole wheat flour, no white flour at all. The brownies were VERY moist, really good, and the chocolate lovers in our house even enjoyed these! Bake time was about 45 mins. My favorite dessert ever.

Excellent brownies made with stuff you have around all the time. I used special dark cocoa powder instead of carob and 2 whole eggs (batter was too dry otherwise)Sure took care of the chocolate craving!

Delicious and addictive! I was thrilled to find this recipe with carob. I made some alterations: whole wheat flour vs. all-purpose, 2/3 cup brown sugar instead of white, and added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These brownies are easy to make and they bake in no time.  All my kids loved them and asked me to make them again. I used Earth balance instead of butter.  I have also made these brownies with coco powder and they are great, I prefer the carob.  Very chewy and will cure a chocolate craving.

The recipe as is, isn't worth making again ( original score of 3 stars) unless you have dietary restrictions. However, after implementing ideas left by other users such as; two whole eggs and I added specialty chocolate.  After that, I can say yes!!! It's the best!!! Its moist and substantial. I made double the recipe to help it fill the pan. Thanks everyone! final score 5 stars!!!

That was really good. I have had carob powder in my cupboard for years and never got the perfect recipe to use it in. Finally! Also, it was perfect, because I had 2 leftover eggwhites that I needed to use up. I did use 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup, and it still came out really sweet. I also used carob chips instead of walnuts, as I did not hav any. Came out sooo good! The only thing I would say, is that for some reason, I felt that the batter was too little and it did not rise at all, so I had a very thin brownie. I wonder if everyone got that result. They tasted perfect though! Rich, chewy and so easy to make. Baked 30 mins, as the recipe asks and that was enough.

Last Sunday, after an endless day grading papers, I was looking for something to satisfy my chocolate cravings and this was the cure! I always make box brownies because I have never had any luck making them from scratch. These were so much better!  I ate half the pan that night!

Wonderful brownies! We didnt have carob powder, so we used cocoa powder and 1 unsweetened chocolate baking sqaure, melted down the butter. Turned out wonderful!! I have got to get my hands on carob powder so I can try it out exactly as the recipe is written, but this was wonderful. We loved it.

Home-made, but taste like the box brownies! Easy to make. I did the same substitution as listed earlier, baking cocoa powder instead of carob (what is that anyway?) and 2 whole eggs instead of just whites (it's easier). Baked for less than 30 minutes. The brownies stuck to the pyrex dish, so may need to be floured as well.

completely changed this up to make triple dark chocolate walnut brownies.  no butter, 1/2 the sugar. whole wheat flour, whole eggs. but then i added a square of unsweeetned baking chocolate melted in the microwave in a tablespoon of applesauce, then topped off with more applesauce to make he mixture about 1/2 cup total, and added a generous squirt of special dark chcolate sauce. made these to use up the walnuts so i used all i had, didn't measure. waaay easy.

I liked these.  I used organic spelt flour, two whole eggs, creamed the butter and 1/2 cup +2 Tbls dark brown sugar.  I baked it at 325 for 1/2 hour.  Turned out great.  Moist.  Might be better with some mint or chocolate frosting.

I was really excited about these since I can no longer eat chocolate and also love walnuts, but these were too sweet for me. I might try them again with less sugar, I think carob is sweeter than cocoa so that might have been the issue. Also they were quite soft and sticky, the baking time could probably be increased.

Made this ones yesterday and the mix was great though when i baked them they were way too hard not chewy at all and i followed some advice and added some chocolate instead of the carob powder; i also used some cocoa powder - tasted good but next time i`d use double the butter it calls for and maybe half a cup of milk - thky

I was a little skeptical at first, but this may be the best home made brownie I have ever tasted!  I used cocoa powder instead of the carob, and I used 2 whole eggs.  The result was rich, delicious, chewy, and fantastic!!

I also modified with dark cocoa powder and two whole eggs because it was too dry to mix otherwise! The moisture was perfect, my only complaint is that they definitely were not chocolate-y enough. Next time I think I'm going to add less flour (1/3 cup?) and up the dark cocoa. That usually works in my other brownie recipes.

This brownie is so delicious and easy to make. I'm a beginner at baking and this is the only brownie recipe that turned out okay. I'm only giving it 4.8 stars because I tweaked the recipe a bit. I doubled the ingredients to fill the pan, and I used whole eggs, I also reduced the sugar and used unsweetened cocoa powder. I didn't increase the baking time and I let the brownie sit in the pan for an hour before cutting. It was still warm, moist and fudgy.YUM!

They were pretty good.  I doubled the recipe and used what I had on hand - cocoa powder, 2 whole eggs instead of egg whites, and a little whole-wheat flour in there for fiber.  Overall, really good, but it dried out a bit after it cooled down.  Best eaten 15 min. after removal from the oven.

Amazing! Very good base recipe! I substituted carob (don't know what that is) with 1 bar of dark chocolate (melted). I used 1 whole egg and 1 egg white. Added 25 g of flour (total of 85). I used less walnuts (115 g was too much!) and baked for 35 minutes at 180 Celcius. It is very moist, well baked and delicious!

I made these for my family, and they were a hit. I only used 2 eggs and added about half a cup of milk. They turned out great and had a great milk chocolate taste.

These carob brownies were the best ever. I've tried many other carob brownie recipes and I was dissapointed. These were so close to regular fudge brownies. I made a carob fudge frosting to top them and they were mmmm mmmm good!

Well I must say that with some minor changes, I made this dessert this evening and it was pretty good. I doubled the recipe, took out the nuts, white sugar, (I don't eat them). And exchanged the all-purpose for whole wheat flour, the carob for cocoa powder (will buy that another time to try later) and used brown sugar. I too used the whole egg and because I doubled the recipe, I had to bake it for an extra 25 minutes.

Oh, yeah, I also added 2 oz. semi-sweet baker's chocolate and 2 tbsp of chocolate syrup. Next time I'll omit the chocolate syrup and use chocolate chips instead of baker's chocolate. 

Other than that, I enjoyed it. I need to know what to do to keep it from crumbling up so much also.

Thanks for the recipe J.J. Waters.

I loved it!! I added 2 whole eggs instead of just the egg whites and I also was feeling like something really decadent so I added a quarter cup of carob chips and quarter cup of white chocolate chips. I also had to bake for 40 minutes instead of the 30 minutes is says.

Great recipe. First time carob user, and the brownies turned out great. It took us only 30-35 minutes with a 15 minute cool down. My husband and son loved them. I used 2 whole eggs and pecans. Will try with whole wheat flour next.

These were ok. I didnt really like the carrob powder however, and they were a bit dry, but i probably did something wrong because a friend made these and they were really chewy.

A great base recipe for sure. Very modifiable to your needs. As many reviewers did, I doubled the batch which made a nice 9x9" pan of brownies. I replaced 2c white sugar with 3/4c stevia in the raw & 3 tbsp brown sugar; instead of 4 egg whites I used 2 whole eggs & 2 egg whites; instead of 1/2c butter I used 1/4c butter & heaping 1/4c applesauce; used cocoa powder instead of carob powder; and used 1/2c pecans (all I had) instead of 2c walnuts. Turned out a nice, dense chewy brownie. Yum!

The BEST!!! Beautiful glaze on top, incredibly moist and decadent! I put them in a 9x9 stone pan and they barely covered the bottom. So I worried they would cook quicker. But they took the entire 30 minutes and were perfect! Love them!

The texture of this brownie leaves something to be desired. The flavor was good but the texture seemed a little grainy... I may look for some alternate solutions and see what I can do.

These are YUMMO!  I made these almost exactly like the recipe says except I used 1 whole egg.  They are chewy, flavorful.  All who tried them liked them, even one person who doesn't like carob.

I'm so glad I found this recipe because I was told I was newly allergic to caffeine about a year and a half ago and haven't been able to have chocolate since. I've experimented with a couple carob-recipes, but was always looking for a good brownie one...something that would REALLY feel like I was eating chocolate.

I followed this recipe ALMOST exactly and I am SO pleased with the results!!!! The only thing I changed were the eggs and the cooking time. I hate recipes that call for egg whites cuz the yolks are just wasted. I used a single "cup" of Egg Beaters, which I believe are just egg whites with yellow coloring. Anyway, those little cups come 3 to a pack and 1 of them is equal to 2 eggs.

I also had to increase the time. I wonder if 300 degrees is a misprint? Anyway, I had to cook closer to 45 minutes at the suggested temperature of 300 degrees.

I also had to make a minor change due to a missing ingredient. I didn't realize I only had about 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract left so I added a teaspoon of maple extract. It was the only similar flavored extract I had.

Super easy and satisfying "chocolate" fix! I used gluten free flour and two whole eggs (medium) and they turned out perfectly -- dense, rich, and fudgey.  I really don't think there's any reason to use just the whites. I press the walnuts lightly on top of the batter in the pan instead of mixing in. Also great without nuts.

Most of these reviews used either whole eggs, cocoa instead of carob and/or wheat flour, or even changed the cooking time. This recipe as written was not good.  Super sweet, yet has an aftertaste.

Good and flavourful. I used 2 whole eggs rather than  2 egg whites, wondering if this change made it a little dry?

I use coco powder.  My family really likes how chocolaty and moist they turn out . I usually double the recipe so they last longer.  Once I added a teaspoon of baking powder and it rose so much it turned into a cake,  but it was still delicious.

I did not have carob powder, so I used cocoa powder (and 2 whole eggs). I also added 2-3 squares of German baking chocolate, so they were extra gooey. Absolutely delicious and perfectly chewy!! I make these often!

I used 2T cornstarch and 4T water instead of eggs.  I also used 1C powdered sugar instead of white.  I melted 2 squares of bakers chocolate with the butter and put some honey in it while hot.  I did have to add a little more water and turn the oven up to about *350 and bake for longer, but they turned out really well.  Very chewy and soft.
