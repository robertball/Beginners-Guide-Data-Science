This was a great recipe!  I used it with fresh peaches and apples.  If you didn't like it, here's probably what went wrong- yes, the butter should be reduced by 2-3 tablespoons.  To keep the crust white/ golden brown, sprinkle the cinnamon on top of the peaches- putting it in the batter will make it too dark.  Finally, this recipe is best with FRESH peaches; canned peaches are so saturated with syrup and other stuff that they don't soak up the butter.  Additional juices/ syrup makes everything runny and the crust mushy, so if you have to used canned peaches, drain them really really well.

I loved this!!!  I added cinnamon to the peaches and doubled the batter as suggested for a 9 X 13. Also tried the exact recipe in a 8X8 pan and it was perfect!

I've never made Peach Cobbler until today and I used this recipe...it tasted WONDERFUL, I didn't change a thing in the recipe...I used 10 medium peaches that I got over at our local Farmers Market..to peal them easily drop peaches in boiling water for about a minute and then take them out of the boiling water with a opened spoon and put them in cold water. I'll definitely use this recipe again..IT'S A KEEPER.

We love this recipe! This is the best cobbler I ever had. We do double the dough though. The recipe here is just a little too little. I have used this recipe for other fruits as well. Just wonderful!

Yum!  I cut this recipe in half and tried to make it a bit healthier :)  I used 1T low fat margarine, reduced the sugar in the dry ingredients to half, and did not put any sugar on the peaches.  Cooked in an 8x8 square dish for 30 minutes - perfect!

So simple, yet so good! I cut the amount of butter in half and added an extra cup of peaches - you can never have too many peaches, right? I also used brown sugar vs. white to toss with the peaches and added a generous splash of vanilla.  I left everything else the same and it baked up beautifully! It smelled wonderful and tasted even better topped with vanilla ice cream!

This recipe contains way too much butter.  After it was baked the butter pooled up on top and it took five paper towels to soak it up!  What a shame to let all those fresh peaches swim in all that grease.  I'd reccmmend that others just butter the bottom of the baking dish or use a reasonable few tablespoons.  The topping was flavorful but didn't rise much.  It was more crunchy than cakey.  There is lots of room for improvement here.

I made this in an 8x8 pan and was a bit skeptical at first when all the butter was coming to the top, but as it cooks, the topping rises up.  Delicious!  My fiance, who wanted me to get his mom's recipe, actually approved of this one!

I tried this recipe two different ways. Once using peaches and the second time I used nectarines. Both of them turned out great and everyone liked both styles. Next time I plan to use a fifty-fifty split between peaches and nectarines.

Quick and very tasty. My apricot trees have started yielding their fruit a week ago, so I used them instead of peaches. It came out a little runny, though. Next time I think I will add some tapioca to the fruit before baking.

perfect.  9x13 glass.  No glass dish always equals baking problems.  Doubled everything except butter and sugar.  Added an extra 1/4 c flour.  Put cinnamon with peaches not dough.  Used 11 fresh juicy peaches off tree.  Don't know how many cups that was, just added as much as the dish could hold.  Always use glass dishes for cobblers, crisps, and dumplings.  I also made two extra for the freezer, put in uncooked.  I'm sure those will bake up fine too.  This recipe was not gooey--gooey people probably did not use glass.  A touch of nutmeg may be yummy next time.

I absolutely loved it!  I made a few changes from tips others commented in similar peach cobbler  recipe reviews. I used 1/4 lb butter and added 1/2 tsp of each almond extract and vanilla extract.  I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar. Came out perfect with all the flavors blended 
together! Thanks for sharing!

This was very good! Next time I would make it with half the butter - think it would be great. Used nectarines & berries.. Wouldn't recommend cutting the sugar down past 1/2 the amount. Used 9x9 square pan.

In my attempt to make this dessert more nutritious I did the following: doubled the dry ingredients, substituting 1/2 cup unbleached flour with whole wheat pastry flour.  I also used brown sugar instead of white but only 1 cup packed.  I threw in a handful of wheat germ too.  It was yummy!!  I used only 3/4 stick butter and melted it in 9 x 13 pan while preheating oven.  GREAT recipe!!

This recipe is excellent.  I've made it a couple of times already and everyone loves it.  I just made it with apples in place of the peaches and that went over just as well.

THis came out very good. It got great reviews tonight for dessert. I didn't think I had enough peaches to fill a 9x13 dish, so I put it in a one size down oval baker with the same amount of topping. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the peaches. I liked how crunchy the top was.

I reduced the btter by 2 TBsp and it turned out great. I doubled the batter and increased the peaches to 6 cups as suggested. I think it couldve been fine with the extra peaches and the reg amount of batter, but I only got one helping before the rest of the family devoured it to really rate it!

I thought this recipe was pretty good, I made it last night and it was my first time making a cobbler, I changed things a little, I used a 7x11 inch pan, I only put about 2 tbls of butter on the bottom of the pan, I put a splash of lemone juice in with the peached and I also added some frozen strawberries. I added about 1/8c more milk to the crust so it was easier to pour, and I sprinkled it with brown sugar. I served it with vanilla ice cream, I think it is a great easy recipe with ingrediants found right in your kitchen! My husband even had seconds! Thanks for sharing the recipe, I will use it again!

Oooo, this was good!  I used frozen peaches thawed.  I've only had cobbler made with a cake mix.  This was easy to make.  I didn't need to use all the topping since I didn't want it completely covered on top.  I was worried it wouldn't cook through.  The sides were my favorite where the topping crisped up, so if you have extra topping, I'd say leave off some rather than have too much.

This was rather tasty (with a side of vanilla ice cream), but it wasn't very pretty to look at.  I doubled the dry ingredients as suggested by others, which was good (I like extra topping) and I ended up using about 6 cups of sliced peaches because 4 cups didn't seem to even get one layer of peaches on the bottom of my 9x13 pan.  Also, for my own additions, I added about 1 Tbsp of brown sugar to the peaches, and 1/4 tsp ground cloves and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract to the dry ingredients, and it turned out with a good flavor.  Overall, I might make this again for family, but not for a holiday event or for friends, because it just looked like a brown cake on the top....

Made this for my family for the 4th of July and was sorry I wasted my time. It was not at all what we thought it would be. The "crust" of the pie was mushy undertneath and it really didn't give us the Peach cobbler taste we were hopping for.

This is a wonderful peach cobbler! We've tried many recipes, but so far, this is our favorite! We did change it to a 9x13 pan, used 6 cups of peaches, and doubled the topping part. Excellent!

This was easy to make but was just okay.  The topping was a little gooey rather than the crumbled kind of topping I was hoping for.

I thought this so easy and tasted great!  I used a smaller casserole dish 9x6 I believe.  And I added some extra brown sugar to the 2 T of white sugar because I used 5 cups of peaches.  Used 3 T of butter only.  It was perfect!

I used half and half instead of milk.  And I agree the topping was adequate but could easily be doubled for a 9 x 13.  I used frozen peaches and had no trouble and I think the butter and cinnamon were just right.  It was so easy and tasted far more complicated then it was.

Tasted ok, but too watery and thin for my tastes. No one else here liked it and we ended up tossing most of it out. I even cut down on the butter as others suggested and it still needed CPR. Sorry!

REFRESHINGLY WONDERFUL, SIMPLE AND EASY.  We truly enjoyed this cake topped cobbler.  Followed recipe as directed, except I sliced the peaches in large slices. Because of my past experience with cobbler, if the slices are to small they turn to mush.  I also doubled up the batter, that's just our preferance, because we like a good golden cake topping that absorbs some of the peach juices. As the other reviewer noted, and I agree, we had it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It really hits the taste buds nicely, anytime. This is "Recipe Box" keeper.  Thank You V. Monte

My family loved this recipe.  I used a 9X9 pan instead of the larger one.  The topping is different, but still tasty.  It is a good recipe to make with the kids because it's simple with just a few ingredients. It's great warm with vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for sharing it.

I use this recipe when camping in my dutch oven over charcole.  I prepare the peaches and the flour mixture in separate plastic containers at home prior to the camping trip.  Then when ready to bake the cobbler in camp all that's necessary is to put the peaches in the dutch oven, add liquid to the flour mixture and spoon over the peaches.

5 BIG stars.....this is my second time making this....I halved the recipe for 2 (leftovers are fabu!) and cut back on the butter by 1 T.  I used no sugar w/fresh peaches in season and used brown sugar instead of white AND added some almond extract or you could add vanilla.  Sorry for all the changes but I followed it to the letter first time and these changes are for my own personal tastes.  This is a wonderful, simple base recipe that can be used with many fruits....thank you SO MUCH for sharing this as my husband does not like any "oatmeal" in his cobblers/crisps.

Oh my, that was good!  I was looking for something similar to my mom's peach cobbler she made when I was a kid.  This wasn't it, but this was wonderful.  The only change I made to this recipes is, based on other reviews, cut the butter to 4 tablespoons.  This baked up warm and gooey with a slightly caramelized crust.  As long as you're not looking for more of a pie type crust, this cobbler is perfect!

This is a great recipe and very easy.  I didn't measure the peaches - I just sliced several and put them on the bottom of the pan - probably had way more than what this calls for. Sprinkled brown sugar over the peaches - about 6 tablespoons.   Doubled the dough - light on the white sugar to make up for the extra brown sugar on the peaches.  very simple and quick and loved the cinammon - night time i might use more of that.  I like a little nutmeg too so next time I might add that.  But this is a great recipe, fun and easy to make.  My husband said it was excellent.

I used 2 cans of sliced light peaches, drained well and did not add the additional 2T sugar.  The topping was a tan color because of the cinnamon.  Suggest draining all liquid from the peaches, put the butter in the topping and sprinkle the cinnamon over the peaches prior to covering with the topping.  Take the time to use a rubber spatula to spread the topping to cover the peaches if you are not satisfied with dropping by the spoonfuls on top of the peaches.  The flavor was delicious.  As you can see by the picture Mylove took, the topping bakes as spooned over the peaches.

as tasty as the reviewers have said.  i made mine with frozen (thawed) peaches and mangoes. due to posted comments i also doubled the dough for an 8x8 glass dish. i didn't need all of it but i wanted to have enough to cover the fruit mix.  also, to cut calories i used 2tbspns of butter and i used less sugar (turbinado sugar, less processed than white sugar that has a honey flavor). next time i will use whole wheat flour so i don't feel so guilty! served w/ vanilla frozen yougart.  my ice cream loving family didn't even notice the difference.

I found 4 cups of peaches to be enough, it took me 9 smaller ones to make that. I added an extra half cup of flour to make the batter cover the 9x13 (I like a lot of crust) but I don't think that is necessary. It isn't the best ever but I found it to be easy to put together and everyone really did enjoy it.  I will keep it.

I used frozen peaches instead and it turns out great. I have tried many cobbler recipes and they really vary in the consistency of the dough. I like this dough. YOu can cut down on the butter.

WOW!  I love this cobbler!  It has become my new standard, with VERY few adjustments.  I feel as though it needs more peaches, so I will increase them next time.  Also, I added extra cinnamon (our preference), and I sprinkled 2TSP lemon juice over the peaches before adding them to the baking dish, to help the fruit retain its color.  The only other change I made was to use whole wheat flour instead of regular bleached flour.  It gave the cobbler a wonderful, homestyle flavor.  Make sure to use real butter, as specified, for best results.  And THANK YOU, V. Monte, for an amazing recipe!

Wonderful!!!  After reading through the reviews, I did reduce the butter by half, added the cinnamon to the peaches & added vanilla to the topping mixture.  I used 6 very large peaches and this baked up perfectly.  Made it this morning and it is already gone!  Good thing I shared some, because I could have/would have eaten the whole thing by myself!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

I just made this and give it 10 stars! I thought that I did not really like cobbler but this is amazing! I only had 3 cups of peaches so I added 1 cup of strawberries and I mixed an additional teaspoon of cinnamon directly on the fruit with the 2 spoons of sugar. I also cut the butter back by 2 tablespoons after reading other reviews. Wow!

Delicious! I followed others' suggestions and reduced the butter to 3 tablespoons. I also added the cinnamon to the peaches instead of to the batter, just like making apple pie. And then, I sprinkled sliced almonds on top of the batter. Turned out perfect! I received compliments for this. People loved it!

This is a great recipe.  Definitely double the batter.  Don't skip the butter.  Put the cinnamon on top of the peaches, not in the batter. Don't double the cinnamon.  I added a 1/2 tsp of ginger to the peaches.  Usually I add a tsp or two of vanilla to the batter, but I forgot today and it was still fantastic.  Much better than other cobbler recipes that call for added water on this site.

I'm giving this 3 stars because I could eat it but I won't try this again. I doubled the cobbler part like most reviewers suggested but it was more like cake. And that made it mostly cake and not enough peaches! And the peaches weren't sweet enough but I think that's my personal taste preference. I'll keep looking for the "perfect" peach cobbler!

This was a VERY Good peach cobbler recipe. The only thing I didn't like, was the crust is really soft the next day- and I too added cinnamon to the peaches, instead of the dough. The first time the crust was ver dark, but I realized later the under layer wasn't thoroughly cooked. Omitted the cinnamon from the dough and added to peaches this 2nd time, and it was perfectly cooked thoroughly. I also did one straight peach, and one apple/peach cobbler. VERY Good and easy recipe! :)

I used this recipe to use up a bunch of peaches we had left from our tree in the back yard. Very yummy and smelled good as it baked. Only change I made was to add 1/4 more milk to the batter because it was a bit dry and thick when I mixed it. Needed the batter a bit thinner and runny to pour over the peaches. I also used wheat flour instead of white. Didn't make a difference!

This was not very good. We didn't care for the topping at ALL - it was gummy and pretty unappetizing.

I won't be making this again.

I have made this cobbler for my husband, but it ended up being eaten by many other family members as well.  I ended up making a second cobbler just for him.  Definitely a hit at our house.

Reduced butter to 4.5 Tbsp, put 1/2 tsp cinnamon in the peach mixture in addition to the 1 tsp in the batter, and baked in an 8x8 pan. Expected to need to increase baking time significantly due to the smaller pan but it was done in 50 min. PERFECT.

So easy! So good! At the advice of others  I reduced the butter to about 3-4 Tbsns and added vanilla and a little lemon juice to the peach mixture.  I also reduced the sugar to about 3/4 cup in the cake. I found the batter to be the perfect amount. I had started cooking up some very ripe peaches the night before with a little water and sugar and used this as the peach base. I will make this many times!

This rocks!!!  We had fresh peaches ready will and able to go into this recipe.  They were so happy waiting in all the buttery wonder.  This had a wonderful texture.  It was YUMMY.  I would cut back on the sugar by about 3 T.  I used the brown sugar with the peaches that others suggested along with the Almond extract-1tea after removing one tea from the milk.

I never review things but this was so unbelievable!!! I did tweak it a bit based on other reviews and used 2T of Brown sugar instead of the white mixed with the peaches. I also added a generous splash of vanilla and the cinnamon to the peaches. We loved the crunchy top but fabulous cakey topping. So so good and the leftovers reheated perfectly for dessert for a few days!

Love this simple recipe even though I'm used other recipes that had a crumbly topping. I'll probably use a little less butter next time but I followed it to a t this time with salt free butter.

Tastes wonderful! I think I would like it better with almost twice the crust. Mine turned out a little soupy, so maybe I will make it without as much butter next time. I had a craving and this hit the spot!

This turned out well.  I liked that the topping was crispy.  There's way too much cinnamon in this for my taste.  I may leave it out altogether next time or put a little in with the peaches.  I may try a little vanilla in the batter as others have suggested.

Tasty recipe and so easy to put together.  Hardest part is pealing and cutting up all the peaches. (got the hubby to do that part) I will add some vanilla to batter next time for added flavor and maybe use some H&H instead of plain milk. Definitely a keeper!

Like others have suggested, I used 1/2 the butter, and sugar. My peaches were super ripe so this came out very flavorful, both for filling and topping. However, even after 45min the topping came out still gooey not crispy or browned properly and the filling was too watery. I'll probably sprinkle some flour to the filling next time to thicken the filling.

I made this recipe as is and used a 9x13 pan. I divided the dough-like batter into thirds and put one on each end and one in the middle and as they baked they spread out to each other. I think the peaches needed more spices or it would've been 5*.

I made this exactly as is and it turned out wonderful! I had no issues or problems. I think the only thing I might do next time is maybe add some vanilla to the batter and/or some cinnamon to the peaches. But no complaints, it was great!! Thank you for the recipe!

Wow! I made this for my father's birthday and he ate most of it in one sitting! I added 1/2 tsp pure vanilla to the batter part and it REALLY tasted good. VERY good recipe!

I rate recipes according to how the recipe is written, among other things.  I must say this is a wonderful recipe.  I honestly don't know how anyone could mess this up.  I don't normally change things on the first attempt, but I had some blueberries and threw them in with four cups of fresh peaches.  YUM!

Very good cobbler.  I used an 8 x 8 baking dish, so I used less than 1/2 cup of butter - maybe 3/4 of a stick.  I also typically reduce the amount of sugar in my recipes, so I only added 1 tbsp sugar to the peaches, and about 2/3 cup sugar to the dough.  My husband and I loved it.  Great with ice cream, of course.  Will make it again, for sure.

This is the BEST cobbler recipe I have ever used...I did change one thing-instead of 1 cup sugar I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar...This is the only fruit cobbler I will use from now on....Thanks.

After reading some of the reviews I decided to try this peach cobbler recipe as I had never done one before. Of course I just knew I had everything on the panrty shelf but I didn't have enough white sugar.  So I mixed one cup of white and one cup of brown doubling batter.  It really was great and I'll make it again. Took to work and everone raved about it.

Very good, but also very sweet!  If I were to makes this again, I would cut the cinnamon to 1/2 t. (put in peaches and not batter), maybe less sugar and leave out the salt....just for personal preference because made as submitted (which I did) it is a a tasty recipe.  Thanks V. Monte!

This was a super easy meal and my friends loved it.  I used fresh peaches which was probably the most time consuming but you could probably use canned peaches and it would be just as good.

Very easy to make. We used white peaches that were a litlle on the firm side and it came out great! We had many requests from our guests for a copy of the recipe.

Tasted good.  Could have used a lot more "bread" topping.  The idea of doubling the topping sounds like a good idea.

This peach cobbler is very good.  I've never made peach cobbler before, but this was easy to follow.  I used half the amount of butter and it turned out fine.  I also used a mix of fresh donut peaches and regular yellow peaches since I had a surplus from my CSA.  I sprinkled the cinnamon on top as suggested.  I will definitely try this again!

I also made this with much less butter in the bottom and less sugar in the topping. It was very peachy which I enjoyed. Most cobbler recipes have fillings that taste almost like peach jelly. This recipe was fantastic!

This will probably be my go-to recipe for peach cobbler from now on. I don't know if I messed up somewhere, but I had to add more liquid to the batter and it still came out less moist then I would have preferred. I may add more peaches next time as well as we like a lot of peaches in our cobbler.

The name of this "cobbler" should be changed to peach bread pudding.  I doubled the batter part as other reviewers suggested, and the result was a half bread half cake covering the the peaches.  Even  if I hadn't doubled it, the batter was much too liquidy to be for a "cobbler".

I took the advice of another reviewer and used much less butter...it really doesn't need a whole stick of butter.  It turned out wonderfully and everyone at the 4th of July barbeque loved it.  When I make it again, I may make some adjustments to the topping.  I prefer the peach flavor and the cinnamon was a little overpowering for my tastes.

This is great, but I find that I didn't have enough batter to cover the entire pan, so I had to triple the batter part of the recipe.

The first time I ever tried making a cobbler, I used this recipe; I am so glad I did!  This was excellent and so easy to make. My boyfriend sat at the kitchen table with the pan and a fork and went at it!

Big hit at the 4th of July get together!  While everyone was starting to eat, I popped this cobbler in the oven and by the time everyone was finished, we had warm cobbler with vanilla ice cream.  So simple to put together and the ingredients, except for the fresh peaches, can be found in a baker's pantry.

I made this last night for our church pot luck (double recipe), and it was a total hit!

I followed a suggestion and sprinkled the cinnamon on top before baking. 

I read many reviews saying there was too much butter, so I had planned to follow their suggestions... and then forgot... After it finished I baking, I took a very small bite and got a mouthful of butter. Oh no!! Please tell me I did not just waste 8 cups of peaches!!  Oh well... I let it cool down a while and then stuck it in the fridge overnight (I made this in a 9x13 inch dish and had to put a cookie sheet under it to catch overflow). 
This morning, I got to church and promptly put it in the oven at 250 for about 2 hours (gotta eat cobbler hot!!!). I took it out when I could smell the peaches. 

The cobbler was absolutely perfect!!! It wasn't dried out from too much oven time - all the extra BUTTER made it absolutely perfect - the butter was no longer overpowering like it was last night. 

Moral of the story... You can make this the night before. Just make sure to use ALL the butter it calls for.

My husband liked this cobbler. He does not like really sweet desserts so he thought it was great. I certainly did not think it was too sweet as some other reviewers said. I thought the topping was weird, kind of crunchy. I would have made my sister's recipe for peach cobbler but couldn't find it so I thought I would try this one. No comparison!! The recipe my sister has (not sure where she got it) is the BEST peach cobbler ever. I will have to get it from her again. I feel like I wasted my peaches. :(

Came out great! Thankfully, I had the benefit of some of the previous reviewers' responses to be able to adjust and customize on the fly. Used frozen peach slices instead of fresh - quicker and easier and worked just fine. Doubled the batter/topping - would have been woefully inadequate for my 9X13 otherwise. Replaced the cinnamon with 1/2 tsp. of allspice and 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and mixed them into the peaches, while also replacing the white sugar in the peach mixture with light brown sugar. Lastly, added a tsp. of vanilla extract to the batter mixture. Next time, will try this with some frozen mango...

I cut the recipe back to 7 servings instead of 10 since I had a 7x11 instead of a 9x13 pan. Then I only cooked for 35mins instead of 45.  Works out great that way.  I'm not sure what people are talking about in cutting back on the sugar.  I'm not a real sweet loving person and I didn't cut back the sugar and thought it was perfect. I love using real peaches instead of canned ones.  Will make again!

This was very dry. Just peaches and crust.I had fresh peaches from the farmers market and thought I'd show my kids the difference between a pie and a cobbler. I love any kind of cobbler but will be looking for another recipe. I don't usually leave negative comments, but if you are looking for a good treat this is not the one. There was no 'sauce'. And I did not think there was too much butter as others have suggested. Maybe adding milk, vanilla? Bland and dry.

This was absolutely WONDERFUL and unlike other cobblers recipes I've used (didn't have oatmeal in it)!!  I doubled the dough for a 9x13, as others suggested, but we thought it was just a little too much.  I'll stick to a single batch next time.

I added cinnamon and some ginger to the peaches, and used brown sugar on the peaches. But my big "mistake" was adding too much milk. The dough was very runny! I threw it in there anyway, and it was still really good, but more a dump cake!

This was fantastic. I cut the butter in half as suggested by some and used a round cake pan to make it a little thicker but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The cinnamon in the topping does make it look dark like whole wheat flour was used so next time I might try putting the cinnamon in with the peaches but that's just appearance. The taste was wonderful.

I followed the recipe exactly how it is written, but doubled the dough mixture to cover the entire top of the cobbler.  I am not a baker and this was certainly a huge step for me...but OMG is this awesome!  I cannot wait to serve it for dessert tonight!  My husband is not going to believe I made this, let alone from fresh peaches.  Definitely easy and a keeper!

Needs 3/4 cup of sugar not a full cup.  And the breading needs to be 1/2 again the ingredients.  I also don't measure the cinnamon adding more than is called for by putting in what smells and looks good to me.

Very good recipe! Loved it, and followed recipe exactly. Just the right amount of sweetness, not too sweet, just right.

I think this turned out GREAT!!!  I did use less butter in the bottom of the pan.  I do think next time I will put more peaches in there and double the batter.  It is kind of thin and I like it to be a little deeper in the pan.  But I will certianly make this again!!!

This was a great recipe!!! I did double the topping and reduce the amount of butter and sugar like other review recommended and it turned out great. My family loved it so i will definately use this recipe again.

This is definately an easy recipe to bake up in a hurry & DELICIOUS!!!  The only thing I wish I would of done is gone ahead with the reviews first with not quite so much butter to the bottom of the pan- could of easily done with half a stick of butter, other than that- I LOVED IT & I know my fiance will too.  I did add the cinnamon to the batter for a darker crust-something different & is so yummy!!  THank you for posting  :)

This was so AWESOMLEY good that after I made it the first night I just had to make it again the next night. I could eat this everyday.  CAN'T GET ENOUGH!! My family loved it and that is hard to believe they are quite picky.  It hit the spot!

i didnt use any butter~maybe thats the reason this did not come out good.  It was doughy.  I hoped it would be a better topping.  The peaches were good (I cut the sugar in 1/2) but the topping was NOT good.

I didn't have enough dough when I tried this recipe.  What I had was too thick and I had to add more milk.  Nothing special about this one.

The peaches in this cobbler were very tasty. But as other reviewers have suggested, the topping was very runny.  Although, the outer layer of the crust had a cake consistency, the under layer reminded me of cooked oatmeal.  I will make it again as a family dessert but I can not recommend it as a holiday dessert or for special occasions.

I substituted 1/2 cup Peach Nectar for the 1/2 milk and it gave the crust a nice peachy taste.  I also left the salt out and used a low sodium baking powder because of my husbands low sodium diet.  My husband said it was the best cobbler he had ever tasted.

Great recipe, though I am still on the lookout for a softer (less chewy) crust.  I doubled the crust, because I love to have equal amounts of peaches and cobbler.  Great recipe, though!

Very good and easy! My mother in law freezes fresh peaches so I used those. Much better than canned so I didn't have to use sugar to sweeten them. I added alittle bit of lemon juice and sprinkled about 1/2 cup of sugar on top.

Very good, I expected more dough though- there isn't a lot of bread/cake part to it. The butter and sugar combine nicely while cooking for a yummy caramel-ish flavor.

Excellent traditional-style cobbler. I used a 10" square pan and got a nice deep cobbler. Very yummy, especially served warm with vanilla ice cream oozing over the top.

Can you say YUMMY??? This is the first thing I made when we got home from the peach orchard this year. It was a big hit. I like the large size it makes becase I can give some away to family and friends.(your recipe scale tool is great and has come in handing many times, however this large dessert was gone in no time)I have had many request to make this dish again. I am going to make it my once a year after we go to the orchard dessert which will make it even more special. THANKS FOR A GREAT NEW FAMILY DESSERT!

I was looking around for a pie recipe cause I had 3 leftover midsized peaches that I needed to use. Found this recipe and decided to try it. I made all of the batter(?) for my three little peaches and the result was a whole lot of dough but the result was great. Thank you so much for this recipe, it is a keeper.

Simple to put together, which is a big plus.  Tasted yummy!  My peaches were quite ripe, and I used a couple of nectarines to add a bit more texture and about 1/4 tsp. almond extract mixed with the fruit, though I don't know  whether it affected taste.  I would add a few more peaches next time as this recipe is using a 9x13 where many AR recipes are using the same amount of peaches for an 8x8 or 9x9 pan.  I did reduce the butter to 6 T. as some others have suggested, and that was plenty, as  I absorbed a bit of the butter around the edge with a paper towel after baking, even so.   I also  used both white sugar and  brown sugar for a total of 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup, and for ripe peaches that was very adequate for us.  We will make this again!

Topping was a bit crispier than I expected, but it was delicious. Made it in an 8”x8” dish and added about ½ cup of blueberries.

I made the following changes. Cut the butter by at least half, used 4 cups frozen peaches and added 1/4 cup flour so that the liquid makes a bubbly sauce, added cinnamon to the peach’s instead of the topping and doubled the crust topping. Perfection!

It's only GOOD THE NIGHT OF BAKING WARM out of oven when it's crispy, then it gets mushy and gooey. It tastes like dough....did not like. The topping has NO substance.

It needed a little more flavor.  But it's a good start make sure to use a big enough dish to cook it in as it ran over on our grill cooking it in a cast iron skillet.

I've used the recipe twice and will go back to it over and over again. Reduce butter and reduce sugar. Use whatever fruit you want. I made it GF with Garbanzo flour. It was great! I made it with 1/2 regular flour and 1/2 oats. It was great! I always throw in Chia seeds and flax meal to everything. It was great! Can't go wrong recipe.

Loved this recipe!  I cut the butter by 3T and used nutmeg vs cinnamon.  Also added a dash of almond extract.  Next time the only modification I would make is to use at least 5 cups of peaches.

I used peaches from farmers market. They produced too much juice for the topping.  Perhaps adding a little cornstarch to peach mixture would have solved that. I would have put cinnamon in peach mixture to keep  topping lighter in color. Biggest complaint is that there is way too much butter.  It floats on top of the peaches. Half the amount would probably be enough.

Didn't really like it all that much, as written way too much sugar, I used 1/2 cup and it was still really sweet. My peaches were really ripe tho, so maybe that was it.  Will keep looking for the perfect cobbler.

I went thru a bunch of recipes before settling on this one. First time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly.  Good results, the top is not too cakey.  Next time I around I added ground ginger in place of the cinnamon.  I have also gone with 1/2 tsp ginger  & 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I also add finely grated lemon peel to the peaches with good results.  We love this warm it a lil bit of vanilla ice cream.  Nice easy recipe, great treat in the summer with the abundance of peaches available.

I made double the crust as suggested and used canned peaches I had on hand in light syrup, well drained.   Since I like gluten free flour, I ground up 1/2 millet (or buy millet flour) and used 1/2 sweet sorghum flour.  Skipped the sugar on peaches as they were packed in syrup.  Used 1/4th the sugar called for in the rest of the recipe (sweet sorghum flour is sweet..) and cut back a bit on the butter. (2T less than called for on the recipe).   It was VERY good.

One of the key things that caused me to give this such a high rating is it's simplicity.  I made the entire cobbler with only a wire whisk.  The spices seem to be about right and I used 6 cups of peaches since 4 left it a little thin.  The crust was thin and not as fluffy as I like it which is the reason for 4 stars and not 5.  I will certainly make this one again.  I believe you can have it in the oven 5 minutes after you start once you have made it once,

I doubled everything except the butter which I kept at 1/2 cup.  It was perfect for a 9"x13" pan.  I substituted Splenda for 1/2 the sugar to cut back on calories.  Everyone loved it and I'll definitely make it again.

I listened to the advice: 3Tbs less butter, doubled the batter for a 9x13 tray, and added the cinnamon to the top of the peaches. It was a little too sweet, so I would like to next try it with 1/4 to 1/2 the sugar in the batter. 
Otherwise it was wonderful

This was a good recipe, I'd make it again. I used half the butter called for, did half brown sugar and half white sugar, and increased the sugar a little because my peaches were a little under-ripe. I also added some vanilla to the crust mixture and used a heaping tsp of cinnamon instead of a level tsp. It was excellent fresh out of the oven. Doesn't keep exceptionally well, but maybe that's the nature of cobbler? This was my first time actually making a cobbler. Still not exactly what I'm looking for, but a very tasty, simple dessert to make. :)

Not my favorite. I might try again following directions exactly.  I doubled the crust and lowered the amount of butter.  Many reviewers suggested this.  It did not turn out well at all.  Taste was fine but texture was awful.  Also the peaches at bottom were too runny and needed to be thickened.

This was the first peach cobbler that I made. I was concerned about the recipe at first because it was not close to the recipe that my family usually use. But it came out great. I added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, and a little extra sugar, and canned peaches. My intentions were to bake in a 9x13, that is the reason I did not use the regular recipe. Before combining the ingredients, I decided to transfer to a larger baking dish. (I don't know the size) Like a hotel pan. I did not want it to come out too thick. In the end the peach cobbler turned out great and everyone loves it. This is a must keep recipe.

This is a good and easy recipe. As suggested by other reviewers,  I doubled the batter, which was a good idea.  I used 6 Tbsp butter, which was plenty, and I also sprinkled the cinnamon directly onto the peaches.  The cobbler was a little too sweet, so I may try cutting back on the sugar next time.

This recipe was WONDERFUL!  I regularly make peach cobbler, but this was my first time using fresh peaches.  The recipe was flawless and needed no tweaking at all.  Cook time was right on target.  My family devoured it after supper!  No leftovers!  Thanks for sharing.

I used over 4 cups of peaches.  It ended up being six peaches of various sizes.  Delicious!!

This recipe was so easy!  I did make a couple of tweaks after reading other reviews though.  I used less butter (about 3 Tbs) and substituted the flour with a gluten-free blend (as I am celiac).  This didn't affect anything as it came out superb!  Also, I mixed the cinnamon in with the peaches and also used a little brown sugar in there too.  Such a wonderful summer dessert!

I used can peaches and poured off the juice reserving about 2 tbsp. Then I followed the recipe like normal.  I have made this several times now and once used apples instead of peaches.  Everytime it has been good.

I do not know why I did not have any success with this recipe like the others. I made the suggested alterations. Cut the butter back, used fresh peaches, and I even cut the sugar in half because the peaches were sweet to begin with. However, after half an hour in a 350 degree oven, the cobbler topping nearly burnt, it was waaaay too sweet even after using half a cup of sugar, and everything else was mushy and juicy and NOT cobbler-like at all. I will not use this recipe again.

I made this last night and it was really good. I substituted splenda for the sugar and added a little extra cinnamon since I didn't mind the brown breading. I also added equal amounts peaches and nectarines. Hubby and I loved it.

Peach Cobbler was fairly good. It had a good appearance and a very appealing smell. It wasnt bad tasting, although im sure if it was cooled down a bit more it would tast even better. But im glad we used peaches and not apples, its good to try new things. All In all , Me, Steve and sarah thought this wasnt bad.

the peaches were amazing! However the topping had a very unique and weird taste to it. In all the recipe was pretty good.

Have been looking for years for a good recipe for cobbler, and finally found it, better then a restaurant recipe! Family loves it too! Big Hit, can't wait to try it on other fruits as well.

Very good. I use a little more cinnamon in the batter and also sprinkle the whole thing with cinnamon and sugar before baking. A wonderful treat when served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Nice buttery flavor.  Some of the crust clumped up, however.  I'm not sure what I did wrong there.

This was so easy!  I had just come back from a N.C. beach with fresh peaches.  I needed an easy recipe and this was it!  It was even better the next day.

With fruit trees and lots of peaches we needed a recipe just like this one: quick, easy and tasty. Great results every time and works equally well (if not better) with apples. Depending on the apples the amount of sugar may need to be adjusted. Black raisins make it even better.
