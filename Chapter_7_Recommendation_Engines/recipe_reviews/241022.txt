I didn't have any fresh apricots on hand (seldom even see them in my stores), so I added 4 dried apricots.  I used plain vanilla Greek yogurt but would use vanilla Greek yogurt in the future or add some vanilla extract.   I used a frozen banana and added some crushed ice because we prefer our smoothies on the thicker side.  Enjoyed this for breakfast today.

Made this, but used Almond Milk (unsweetened-30 calories/serving).  It cuts the calories.

This was a nice, thick and fresh tasting smoothie. Thank you for the recipe.
