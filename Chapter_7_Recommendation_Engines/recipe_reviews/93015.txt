Great dish both in taste and presentation. Between the wine and the capers I didn't think the lemon was necessary, so I left it out and simply served the fish with lemon wedges on the side. Confident or experienced cooks needn't bother with measuring ingredients--just cook away and enjoy yourself! Pour in a glug or two of wine, reduce a bit, pour in a couple glugs of cream, then add herbs and capers to suit your taste.  Simply beautiful, and simply delicious.

This is fantastic! My 2 kids and hubby could not stop raving about it-definitely restaurant quality! I will make this again and again! Fairly simple (as long as you have all the ingredients on hand) and it makes for a beautiful presentation. I did not add the capers though. I served this dish with french bread (bread is a must for the yummy sauce), and garlic-parmesan green beans. I am not sure if the green bean recipe is from here or not-I got it somewhere online! You snap off both ends of the fresh green beans, blanch them in a pan in enough water to cover, strain & run under cold water, return to the pan and  stir fry them in some butter. Then sprinkle them with garlic salt, pepper, and a good amount of parmesan cheese.

I don't like it when recipes don't give specific measurements like "one lemon, juiced",  The amount of juice one lemon contains can vary greatly.  Mine must have been extra juicey because I thought this was way too lemony.  My husband raved about it though.  The halibut was very good after I scraped most of the sauce off of mine.  If I make this again, I will add the lemon juice one tablespoon at a time.

Halibut is so expensive and hard to get. I am on a low fat diet, so I left out the butter and cream. Also I am short on fresh herbs, so I used dry. Served it on a nice bed of greens with a light vinegrette. See photo.

My mother and I spent 15 minutes talking about how delicious this recipe was.  I didn't even add capers (forgot).  I used light butter, and used half the basil and parsley (for 2 halibut steaks), and 1/4 cup of the heavy cream, used one lemon, etc.  I thought the sauce would boil away but it didn't. My mother doesn't drink any alcohol so I added mine after I dished hers out.  I did not use salt, instead using a very light sprinkle of Cajun seasoning (I'm supposed to not use salt, so I cheat with Cajun seasoning, which has salt but it makes me feel like I'm not using salt).  I had leftover halibut from a seafood company that delivers, and swore I couldn't wait to never buy halibut again, but I've changed my mind.  This was EXCELLENT.  I am shocked at how good it was.  And I am no chef.  I usually don't follow directions well (hence, no capers). I ate salad with no dressing to go with the meal, as I'm trying to watch my weight.  Haven't added up the calories but it was as filling as eating 2 potatoes!

This is such a great recipe, both my husband and I love it - especially how easy it is to prepare. We've made it many times with different types of white fish and its always turned out great. Better to use fresh lemon then lemon juice. Its great when served with mashed potatoes or couscous since both absorb the sauce nicely.

The store was out of halibut, so I used the mild talipa instead and I think it worked great with the reduction sauce. I wouldn't suggest using salmon. My only other suggestion would be to try not to dawdle in making the sauce, and plate as quickly as possibe. Served with creamed spinach and parsley as decoration, and it looked great. Will definetly make again, maybe with halibut next time.

I've tried numerous great recipes from this site but this is the first one I've written a review for. I made this recipe over the weekend and it was amazing!!! I followed it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing! I've been craving the sauce ever since and can't wait to make it again.  Thanks Charter Guy!!!

Loved this. Super easy and fast. A delightful meal to prepare for company. Presentation is very nice when paired with yellow rice or parmesan noodles. I followed recipe exactly and the only thing I would do different next time is add half the fresh squeezed lemon. I think fresh squeezed lemon is more potent than lemon juice(?). This recipe is better than any halibut ordered from a restaurant. My dinner guests complimented the meal at least 5 different times. I will definitly make this again and try the sauce with chicken and bowtie pasta. Thank you!!!! I have made this 3 times within 2 weeks!!! Simply FABULOUS!

I loved this recipe! So so simple...the preparation time is minimal, and the end product looks and tastes amazing! The only change I would make next time is to double the sauce.

I made half this recipe using tilapia, but I did make the full amount of sauce, because after reducing I didn’t think there would be enough had I only made half.  There is no need for the amount of flour indicated in the recipe, just a couple of tablespoons worked for me.  I cut the butter in half and omitted the lemon juice.  FRESH parsley and basil are key to this recipe - using dried just wouldn’t produce the same excellent results.  And be sure to use a wine you would actually drink, not that horrid cooking wine – don’t even buy that stuff!!  We thoroughly enjoyed this and will definitely make it again.

This  dish was easy and very good - the directions allowed me to perfectly pan fry the fish - something that I have struggled with for some reason in the past. The sauce was very good, very lemony, as others mentioned. The cream wanted to curdle when I added it to the the lemon/butter/wine sauce, but I did it in a slower drizzle while wisking quickly and it eliminated the curdles. The sauce does taste like it is missing something, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. The lemon flaver dominiates over any other flavor in the sauce, so I will have to work to make it a little more complex of a flavor. Great over basmati rice.

This recipe boasts maximum flavor for minimum effort!  I used a combination of olive oil and butter to fry the halibut in and used light cream instead of heavy cream.  My lemon was huge so I used the juice of only half a lemon and it was perfect.  Not only was this a tasty dish but a pretty one, as well, served with a stir fry of fresh corn, zucchini, red onion and red bell pepper.

Very easy to make and extremely flavorful. Best halibut recipe I've ever made. Impressed the socks off of the Mrs. and I look forward to making it again for friends.

I was tired of the same boring way to make fish. I did not have capers or fresh herbs on hand. I also had white fish. So, I did without capers altogether and used dried herbs instead. I thought what the heck I will try this with the white fish and see what happens. This dish was still amazing! I will not be making plain white fish again!!! YAY! Thanks for the recipe! Thanks for All-Recipes.

This is a delicious dish. I used a 1/4 lemon juice and a reisling white wine. It was perfect. I only used one portion of halibut and adjusted ingredients accordingly.

This is so good that it has become my husband's meal of choice for his birthday.  I make a little extra sauce and toss it with angel hair pasta and serve the fish atop that.  Delicious!!

The recipe is wonderful, and can be customized if you want it to have less calories.  I used just a spray oil and a tablespoon of Olivio, I just brushed the fish with a tablespoon of flour, and I used skim milk instead of cream.  I had no fresh basil or parsley, so I used frozen basil and dried parsley.  It was still delicious!  Next time I will use fresh herbs and it will be even better.  A real company dish!

Incredible fish recipe. By far my favorite. Really brown the fish in butter till it is crispy. (I used thick tilapia fillets.) This makes the fish beautiful, and is the start of a wonderful presentation. I TRIPLED the sauce, and simmered it for a little over 30 minutes till it was reduced enough to be thick. This is key....do NOT rush the reduction time. Trust me, it is worth the wait. I squeezed half a lemon into my sauce, by the way, and had zero problems with curdling like some say they had. Do not leave the lemon out, it is essential to the sauce! After reducing sufficiently, pour sauce over your golden brown fillet. Heaven. Thanks charter guy!

With the exception of using chicken broth in place of wine and adding a tad more cream, this may have been one of the best fish dishes we have ever tasted.  I would order this over and over in a restaurant.

I made this as written, and i found it to be a great dish but other reviewers are right about the excessive lemon content. I think 1 Tbsp of lemon juice should be the maximum amount added.

We loved the sauce!  I think it would be great with most any fish.  You must, must, must use fresh herbs, however, to get the full benefit of these flavors.

Absolutely delicious!  I used halibut filets and left them cooking in the pan while adding the wine, lemon, etc...no need to measure, probably used only half a lemon, but more wine and cream- great recipe!

I was hesitant about this recipe, but I gotta tell ya - I added a little extra (a little extra cream and lemon juice to make more sauce and used sweet wine rather than dry) and it was comparable to a 5-star restaurant.  Phenomenal meal!  We will definitely be making this one again.

Yummy! It's easy and fast. You can use any type of fish. Recommend lightly rubbing a lemon over the fish to get rid of the extra strong fishy taste. My husband stated if he ordered this at a restaurant... he would be happy.

AHH!  This was so good!  I didn't use flour and used Mahi Mahi instead of Halibut...turned out just as awesome.  I think I want to cook this every night!

Excellent recipe. In a separate pan I sauted mushrooms & garlic in butter, then added that to the sauce before spooning it over the fish. Delicious.

VERY good!!  Wandered out to my herb garden and didn't have any basil but lots of parsley so  used  that and dry basil. Had fresh oregano but decided against that.  And half and half rather than heavy cream.

I left out the heavy cream and I don't think I missed the extra calories-this was an excellent way to prepare white fish and would probably even make tilapia taste pretty good.

this was too lemony. I had to add other spices to it and a 1/4 more wine to it. as the flavor was flat and for an expensive piece of meat that is hard to swollow,It is possible the taste was not even close to what it shouldhave been because I did not have capers.I am not even sure what capors are. so this may not be a very fair assessment. Thank you for sharig your recipe with us.  Always, Christine C.

This is the BEST and EASIEST recipe EVER and the taste is delicious!! I've used this recipe on several types of fish not just the halibut. I think the fresh herbs are the most important and I upped the capers since I love the taste with the cream sauce. I messed up the first time and burned the butter when I cooked the fish so I had to start over for the sauce and it lacked the extra flavor kick it needed so the second time around I was more careful and it ROCKED! I have company coming on Saturday night and I'm making it again.

The sauce was VERY lemony.  It overpowered every other flavor. I scrapped it and made a simple garlic white wine sauce and served it over wild rice.

Absolutely loved this halibut! I randomly picked up some halibut at the supermarket since it was on sale and was searching for a quick, easy, delicious recipe and this was it! My roommate and I devoured our meals and cannot wait to cook it again!

I was looking for a recipe for fish that had a sauce a little bit different than what you would expect to find.  This one caught my eye.  It was really, really good.  My husband and I both enjoyed it. I made the recipe as written and won't change a thing.

A quick and tasty dinner.  We enjoyed this.

I only had processed herbs on hand.  It did alter the taste a little I think, which is why I have only rated it 3 stars.  I cut the fat by using evaporated milk instead of cream.

I think this would work with any firm white fish.  I used ling as I did not have any halibut at hand.

Served with steamed broccoli.

This recipe was easy to prepare and was absolutely delicious! It was far tastier than many restaurant fish dishes I have had. I used flounder because that is what I had purchased and I think any white fish would due.
I would use about 1/2 of a lemon but other than that would not change a thing!
Incredible!!

I used tilapia and also did not add capers. Served it with mash potato and green beans. Great presentation but not very flavorful, I even added extra spices.

Had guests for dinner last night and was looking for something different to fix. YUM, YUM, YUM. I followed the directions exactly, except the fish monger did not have halibut so used red snapper. The flavors were spot on and we all loved this. It will become a regular. Thanks for the recipe Charter Guy.

I liked it quite a bit, my husband liked it much better without the capers. I made as written, except that I couldnt find halibut so used talapia like so many reviews suggested.  I would make again for sure, but we have other fish receipes that we like better, but this is still a keeper!

I think I messed this up by worrying that the sauce was too thin...when in fact is should have been.  I thickened with flour at the end..so my sauce was gloppy.  Also- I used lemon juice as I did not have a lemon...and I think I was too conservative with it.  Still- fish was perfectly cooked and sauce was great...I just think it would have been better had I followed the directions!  Be sure to double the sauce!

This was very good. I rated it a 5; my husband a 3.  Made some changes due to other reviews.  Used half olive oil half butter to fry the fish. Doubled the wine, used 1/2 cup of reg milk and a 1/4 cup sour cream.  Only used 1 T of capers. YUMMY!

Company Worthy!  I baked my halibut instead of pan frying it but otherwise, I followed the recipe to the "T".  Absolutely delicious.  Because it is winter here, I had to use dried parsley and basil but boy, I cannot wait until my herb garden to try the fresh herbs!  We poured the sauce over our steamed broccoli too - - it tasted wonderful.  Excellent recipe, please give it a try!

My family really liked this. It was easy, quick and attractive. The sauce was tasty but did not overpower the fish. My only change was to add a bit of garlic during the sauteeing of the fish. We will make this again!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I did leave out the capers because we just don't like them, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.
It was delicious and easy. Definitely a company type dish. My halibut was thick, about 1 inch or more, so it took longer to cook, but that was not a problem.
When done, the fish flaked so easily and wasn't dry at all.
I'll definitely be making this again. Don't skimp and use dried herbs. The fresh is delicious with the wine/cream sauce.

yummy, yummy, yummy. This is really good fish. It inspired me to make fish tacos. I just pulled the fish fillets apart and drizzled the sauce over the fish inside a lightly fried corn tortilla!

I really enjoyed this recipe and that says a lot 'cause I'm really not fond of fish. I think that it's as good as I've had anywhere. Next time I think I'll make a little more sauce. Thanks Charter Guy for a really good recipe.

You know what? This recipe is really good. I prepared this to recipe for my wife using two halibut steaks in place of the four called for in the recipe. The only change I made was to substitute dried basil for fresh. In addition, I grilled two salmon steaks on a grill using butter and dill.  I placed the salmon with halibut and poured the sauce over all.  It was absolutely delicious!  The salmon was as good as any I have had in fine restaurants. Try this, you won't be sorry.

This was just ok, i'm always looking for a sauce for fish.  this one happened to be a tad too salty and lemony due to the capers i think.  If I made this again, I would cut down on both the lemon juice and capers.  Plus, I don't like pan frying my fish, I like to bbq it.
Thanks anyhow

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve made this. With halibut or other white fish if halibut isn’t available. I’ve used it for chicken as well. This evening I added some Parmesan for a unique Alfredo sauce for chicken and it was fantastic. Great recipe, thanks!

Definitely would be better with ritz crackers added into the flour and then fried. My husband didn't seem so thrilled with this, but I love lemon flavored fish, but even for me despite my obsession with overwhelming my seafood with lemon this seemed to be a little too lemony, perhaps because the capers, so taper the lemon juice down a bit. Besides that it was really tasty.

I didn't make this exactly as-is due to availability of ingredients, but still loved it. I used haddock instead of halibut, milk instead of cream, broth instead of wine. I imagine this would be even better with the original ingredients, but this version was still great.

I made this with wahoo instead of halibut, and it was wonderful. The wahoo was very thick, so it took more time to cook, but had great flavor and a very meaty texture. Next time I'd use a little less lemon juice and more wine & cream (I used half & half.) Great recipe!

This was too lemony, but still good. I made it with shark meat instead. Next time (there probably won't be one), I would halve the amount of lemon.

The cooking method is very good and the halibut was very tasty and moist.  I found the sauce to be sour, added quite a bit of salt to counter the sour.  If I try it again, I'll substitute chicken broth for the wine (I used sherry).  That could be just my tastes, as I'm not a wine fan.

This recipes was very good.  I followed recipe exactly other than I seasoned with old bay seasoning.  Also, I usually like to double sauces, but on this one, do not, I did and had so much sauce leftover.

What a great recipe. Delicious.  My husband raved about how good this recipe turned out.  I thought it was out of this world.  Next time I make this recipe, I will leave out the flour dusting part.  I feel it doesn't really add anything to the fish.

The pan-fried fish (I used tilapia) was very good and quick and easy to make.  However, the sauce curdled and looked like sand sinking to the bottom of the pan, leaving the liquid on top (maybe because of the lemon, as someone else suggested?).  The flavor of the sauce I wasn't too crazy about, either.  I'd make the fish again, but definitely will NOT make the sauce again.

This recipe was simply amazing!  I am a begginer in cooking and I had no experience cooking fish, yet this recipe was easy and delicious!  When I first tasted the sauce I though it was too lemony, but it tasted great with the fish.  Because of my inexpierience, I used talpia (which is much less expensive than halibut) and I left out the capers because I don't have much of a taste for them.  My family loved it, and it was easy too.  Thank you so much!

This is a basic Piccata recipe (just omit the basil). True, not all cooks have the instinct for quantities with ingredients. I recommend 1-2 table spoons of Lemon and try  (substituting seasoned salt for regular salt)sifting salt, pepper, and flour together (adjusting to personal taste), reducing heat and returning fish or chicken to sauce and simmering in sauce for 2-3 additional minutes.

I really loved this recipe, although there was nothing "green" about the sauce. Halibut is off season right now and the price reflects it - $16.99 a pound! That is just unbelievable especially living in New England! Anyways...used swordfish instead. Came out delicious. To cut down on calories I used light cream instead of heavy. Use a light hand on the lemon juice - mine was a little too tart so I added a dash more cream. I highly recommend adding the capers. Gives it just the right zip in the end. This one is definitely a keeper!

I used orange roughy instead of halibut since halibut is out of season.  The pan-friend roughy was awesome, but we (my husband and I) did not care for the sauce much.  I'd rather eat the fish plain (seasoned w/ Old Bay) or with roumalade (sp?) sauce.

Loved this!  My husband and I are very picky when it comes to fish.  I tried this recipe with Alaskan Cod and it came out delicious!  I only used 2 fillets, so there was plenty of sauce, which was the best part.  I also don't like a strong lemon flavor, so I only used the juice of half a lemon as someone else suggested.  This recipe will be my new favorite fish recipe.

This is without a doubt the most flavorful pan seared halibut recipe  I've ever had .  It's so easy, a caveman could prepare this dish, and I'm from Alaska! Suggest wild rice and creamed spinach as sides

This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time! I forgot to buy the fresh herbs, so had to use the dried.  Next time I’ll get the fresh herbs.  It was still excellent with the dried.  I followed everything else as printed.  I had fresh Alaskan Halibut.   WOW!

I thought it was very good although a little too salty for me when made without "tweaking" some.  I did follow the reviews that said to only use half the lemon.  I would not salt the halibut before dusting with flour and cooking next time.  I would probably even use unsalted butter for cooking the halibut and I think it would be more to my taste then.

Very good! I used cornmeal instead of flour due to my husband’s gluten intolerance. Didn’t add capers and it was absolutely delicious.

Oh my heck-this is my new favorite sauce for seafood!
My rating is on the sauce only since I didn't make halibut (not halibut season so nothing available).  I did make the sauce as written and served it alongside pan seared sea scallops and grilled salmon.  It was phenomenal-very easy to prepare and tasted amazing on both the fish and the scallops.  I'm excited to try it on the halibut using the preparation method in the recipe once it becomes available.  Thanks for sharing:)

This recipe was super easy and delicious. Call out - moderate the amount of lemon juice. I would say start with 2 Tbs then adjust. The first time I used juice of whole lemon, the sauce was way too tart and i had to re-adjust other ingredients to temper it. I used dried herbs but still tasted amazing.

This is the second time I've made this recipe and my husband absolutely loves it..reduced the amount of basil in order to not overpower the taste. Don't skip the capers, they certainly add to the taste. We had two filets so I halved the recipe.
I'll make it again, next time to serve at a special dinner party it's that good. 
Thank you for the recipe!
Keeps getting better, made it again!

Fantastic dish! I had Halibut in freezer for a while now because i didn't like the fish and didn't know how to cook with it. This recipe made it awesome! I wish i would have found this months ago.  I didn't use capers (none on hand) and only spritzed lemon juice on as i read through the other reviews and halfed the recipe for seasonings as i almost forgot.

It used one lemon and the lemon overpowered the recipes. I would use half the lemon juice next time. Otherwise it was very good

Very good. I didn't use as much butter. I am also added an ear of corn to the cream sauce just because I had some. I used halibut for $24/lb yikes and some red snapper that was $18/ lb yikes to compare the two. The halibut tasted better.

If you like halibut this one is a winner! It is a recipe that tastes like much more time and effort was put into its preparation... but it was fast & simple. I did not have fresh basil on hand so I substituted dry - it was fine.  Really good recipe, I printed this one out and put it in my recipe box .

This was fantastic and I will be making it regularly from now on. My capers had expired, and I did not have the fresh herbs. Instead, I added a 1/2 t chopped dried chives and 1/2 cup freshly shredded parmesan. I served the lemon on the side. The sauce was wonderful and I think it will be even more wonderful when I follow the recipe exactly. The fish itself was to die for.

I followed this recipe to the letter.  Both my husband and I were somewhat disappointed.  We both thought that the frying time was a little much.  We may try this again, and if we do, we will steam the fish and use a little less lemon.  Each lemon produces a different amount of juice, maybe ours was extra juicy.  I wish this recipe had an exact amount of fresh lemon juice instead of an approximate that can vary by more than a tsp either way.

I used half and half because that is what I had on hand. I also didn't have fresh basil so I uses dried. It turned out very good but I think with fresh basil and cream it would have been even more flavorful.

Followed the recipe except didn't add the lemon juice and used 1/2 the amount of capers hubby's not a fan of either. Served with lemon wedges on the side next time I would use 1/2 butter 1/2 olive oil or grape seed oil and serve the basil on the side

OMG!! This dish was delicious!! I am not the best cook in the kitchen, but everyone was impressed and loved it. I only added about 2 table spoons of basil (that's all that was available in the yard) and I used a California Sauvignon Blanc (barefoot brand, $5). My filets were about 1.5-2 inches thick. I cooked it for 2 minutes on each side. Perfecto!

Fast & delicious!  Also added a small pinch of cayenne to the fish before dusting on the flower. Served with Sarah's Rice Pilaf from AR along with one bunch of sauteed asparagus in butter with a couple of tsp lemon zest.

Fast, easy, tangy. Used sauvignon blanc and freeze-dried herbs. I might put slightly less lemon juice next time though. It's like chicken piccata but with halibut!

Best fish dish I have ever made.  Used Orange Roughy,  (a very moist white fish). served with Sweet Potato Fries and a sweet Kale Salad.  I simmered the sauce longer than the recipe says to get it thicker.  Also didn't use a whole lemon, just a few squeezes, and added salt to taste.   And of course, served white wine!?? Delicious

Really good. This is the second time I'v made this and added some sauteed mushrooms to the sauce and only the juice of 1/2 a lemon. Good with or without capers. Serverd on a bed of rice with cold sides of asian style slaw for a crisp contrast. Pre measure everything before hand. Comes together quickly so it's a good recepe for entertaining.

I zeroed in on this recipe, for the complimentary sauce. And I say Wow. I served with a side of rice pilaf and a mild fish
of our choice. Thank You for Sharing. The sauce should be done as per the recipe, no exceptions.

I was disappointed. But i think it was my own fault. I'll probably be trying it again sometime and we'll see how it is. It was very lemony, too lemony for me. Maybe I didn't cook it down long enough, or put too much in. I'm not sure. Didn't include the capers and I'm glad I didn't, it would have been too much for me. I'll probably try the sauce again on some tilapia though just because of how expensive halibut is.

Easy to feel like a Real Chef while eating this until the plate was clean. My wife gave me a sexy look after every bite. She said it was the best she had ever eaten. This recipe will stay in the keep forever pile. Next, I will try a mustard base sauce.  And see where that takes us. Thanks!!

I substituted 1/2 & 1/2 for the cream and used Talapia instead of halibut, but otherwise made as is. Huge hit!  The sauce would be good on chicken too.   I would recommend doubling the sauce.

This came out really good, but I made a couple of small changes- baked the fish and replaced heavy cream with fat free half and half. The store didn't have Halibut, so I used flounder. Also, the lemon curdled the half and half, so I remade the sauce without it. I'll definitely be making it again.

Great recipe! I omitted lemon due to allergies. Halibut is expensive and not readily available everywhere. Try Cod if you are from New England. (Buy the previosly frozen. Cod can be prone to worms and if frozen the worms leave the fish flesh as it freezes.) Gross but true! When the men come in from fishing,k I always freeze the catch of the day for this reason.

Very tasty. I used 1/2 a lemon and still felt it was quite a bit tangy. I had to add more cream to have enough sauce as well. Still tasted delicious.

I'm preparing this recipe for the second time tonight, using Dover sole, again.  The sauce is lovely, and sole being so thin, the dish is very delicate and the fish melts in your mouth.  Thanks, Charter Guy!

After reading the reviews, I doubled the sauce.I used tilapia because the store did not have halibut. Like some one else said mine was way to lemony. My husband scraped most of the sauce off his. I let the kids taste the sauce before serving and they passed on the sauce and just ate the fish(but they thought the fish was really good).I might give this one more try but next time I won't double the sauce and will add less lemon.

As much as I wanted to like this recipe, it did not do anything for me.  I would rate it a 3, but I thought my fresh basil was still good to use after 4 days old, but it was not.  I had to use dried basil and it was not good.  It's not fair to entirely base a review when directions are not followed to a T.  But this stated, there was only enough sauce to cover one steak.
