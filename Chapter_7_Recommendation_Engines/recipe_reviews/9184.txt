YUM YUM YUM!  Very good and as easy as they come!  I thought it was going to be a little too sweet for a side dish, but it wasn't.  It was perfect! I used fresh baked pumpkin and instead of the 1/2c. self-rising flour, I used: 1/2c. all purpose flour plus 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1/8 tsp. baking soda as my Better Homes cookbook directed.  We will be enjoying this many times again!

This was completely fantastic! I followed the recipe completely except for the substitution of all purpose flour for self-rising flour since that's what I had on hand. I followed Shana4105's review directions & used: 1/2c. all purpose flour plus 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1/8 tsp. baking soda. Everyone had seconds & thirds, even my pickiest child. It is sweet & I could see how it's more of a dessert for many, but it added just the right balance of sweet with a spicy meal. All in all an easy, different & delicious way to use pumpkin.

I give very few 5 stars, and this dish was fabulous!  It is something different than traditional holiday fare, yet full of pumpkin yummi-ness.  It tasted a bit on the sweet side, so next time I'll try a little less sugar.  Served with rosemary and sage roasted chicken and broccoli.  Kids couldn't get enough--it was a great bribe to get them to eat their broccoli!  This will make a regular appearance on my dinner table, especially at holiday time.  Thanks for the recipe!

An excellent recipe. I cut the recipe in half. I used fresh pumpkin and substituted the following for the self-rising flour (1 c. self-rising flour=1 cup minus 2 T. regular flour, 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder and 1/8 tsp. salt). I will definitely make this again.

The fact that one reviewer made this as pumpkin pie and another served it with chicken and broccoli indicates a case of mistaken (or rather confused) identity.  The truth is that this recipe is quite versatile.  I was going for side dish rather than dessert, so I only used 1/4 c brown sugar.  I also replaced 1/4 c of the butter with 1/4 c applesauce to make it a bit healthier.  Then I popped it in the oven while I prepared the rest of dinner - very easy!  It came out moist and fluffy (warning: the fluffiness doesn't carry over to the next day), with just the right amount of sweetness to serve with dinner.  For more of a dessert feel, I might use up to 1/2 c sugar - the pumpkin puree is sweet in itself.  And you can top with marshmallows or whipped cream, yum!

This is darn good.  And lends itself well to substitutions.  I did not have evaporated milk so instead I used a can of sweetened condensed milk and just left out the sugar.  I didn't realize until just now that the recipe calls for self-rising flour.  I used regular ol' unbleached all purpose and it turned out great.  Didn't measure out my pumpkin, just used a 15 oz can.  I'm betting that you can even sub 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil for the butter and add some more of the traditional pumpkin pie spices if it suits you.  A word of advice, it is very delicious but a bit sweet for a side dish.  Might want to cut back on the sugar a bit for supper.  As is, it's great for breakfast.  All three of my kids loved it.

I tried this as written and my family thought it was "okay".  This is definitely something dessert-ish, though. Nothing that I would serve WITH dinner.   On a second thought, I tried it again, but with my own twist:    First I 86'd the canned pumpkin and opted (since it is Halloween) for a fresh, medium, pie pumpkin.  I sliced it in half, scooped out the seeds (of course reserving them for toasting later), put the 2 halves on a cookie sheet with just enough water to cover the bottom and baked them in the oven @ 350 for about 45 minutes (as if making squash...yanno, because it IS a squash).  Then, once it was fully cooked and cooled, I quickly peeled it and threw it in a bowl for the next step.  Second: I got rid of the evaporated milk.  I could distinctly taste it in the first dish and well, it tasted like tin. Instead I used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 skim milk.   I also used 1/2 c. sugar, omitted the salt, 1/2 the butter, and more cinnamon.    DELISH!  It was so light and airy and was like a mousse!  It was devine!  Still not savory, not too sweet but just right.    If you've never had fresh pumpkin before, this is a great recipe to try it in.  You'll never go back to the canned stuff!

This was a little too sweet for a side dish, so I serve it warm/room temp with a little whipped cream for dessert. It would probably work well baked in individual dishes/ramekins too. I've often made it with butternut squash and sometimes I use pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon. Its a keeper

This was great, but I modified it to make more healthy by cutting the sugar to 1/3 cup and cutting the butter to 1/4 cup.  I also doubled the flour since the other solids were reduced.

I decided to try this recipe as a "crustless" pumpkin pie. It was GREAT!! I used pumpkin pie mix, as that was all I had on hand. I added an extra 1/2 cup of evap. milk, and a tsp of pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon (I like a spicy pumpkin pie).  I baked it in a 9x13 baking dish for an hour and it is perfect!! This will definitely be the recipe I use for "crustless" pumpkin pie.

I wasn't entirely sure about making a pumpkin casserole.  I love pumpkin though so we gave it a try.  My husband whipped it up and it is FABULOUS!  We're going to make it for our Halloween dinner party.  It's creamy and melts in your mouth.

I LOVED THIS!!! Instead of the cinnamon, I added 2T of pumpkin pie spice, and it was out of this world! I served it warm and topped it with whipped cream, and it was SO GOOD!! I can't tell you enough how good this was! It's better than pumpkin pie!

Very, very good, and very easy.  I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup, but otherwise did not change recipe.  My kids all loved it, even my picky one, and they fought over the last little bit.  I will definitely make again.

This was a real hit! Very easy to make, and very tasty. This can be served as a side dish with the main meal, or as a dessert (because it is sweet). It tastes similar to a custard.

I served it for Christmas and my family loved. I will make this again. I used oakflour instead of self rising flour because of wheat allergies and it was very good.

Yum! Simple enough for a child to make, has a creamy velvety texture when done. Kinda melts in your mouth - but make sure you like pumpkin!

I made this tonight for a dinner party of 8 children and 4 adults.  This was a hit.  Everyone loved it, especially the children.  It went quick and needless to say, no leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used regular milk, cut the sugar and butter in half and used whole wheat flour and it was soooo good! I could have eaten the whole dish myself! Nice change from pumpkin pie.

You can't miss with this recipe! Be sure to use the self-rising flour (1/2 C flour, 1/2 t baking powder, 1/4 t salt, 1/8 t soda). I used one can fat free evaporataed milk, and for the sugar amounts I used 1/2 c white and 1/4 c briown. Instead of cinnamon I use 1 t pumpkin pie spice. I prepare this dish a day ahead and bake it the next. If you love pumpkin you'll love this!

This is great.  Tasty and easy.  The only thing I did differently was I used muffin tins instead of a casserole dish.  My kids will eat anything in muffin form.  It also make the cooking much fasted and I ended up with more of the tasty crusty part.  The "muffins" were easy to put into school lunches too.  :) Thank you for the recipe.

I use 1/2 c low fat bisquick and omit vanilla, add garlic and sage and reduce sugar.  Yummy savory side this way.

Easy and delicious! Here are the changes I made: -increased to 29 oz canned pumpkin. -fat free evaporated milk.  -Splenda instead of sugar. -all purpose flour instead of self-rising. -1/2 cup of Egg Beaters instead of eggs. -fat free margarine instead of butter. -replaced the pinches of cinnamon with 1 tbsp of pumpkin pie filling.  This is a make-again dish. Thanks, Lori!

Really nice flavor. Made a few adjustment since I am doing a diet program. I cut the sugar in half to 1/2 cup. I used 4 egg whites instead of 2 eggs. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 margerine. This was so good! Turned out beautiful. It was so good we ate some with our meal and then had some for dessert with ready wip on top.

I tried this last week to make sure it would be good for thanksgiving and we ate it in 2 sittings. So now I am making it for my mom who loves pumpkin and she is sure to love this. The only thing I did different is add some pumpkin spice in addition to cinnamon but other than that I followed it exactly. Very good indeed !!

I'm a pumpkin addict, and this pumpkin casserole recipe really hits the spot!  It's super simple since you just mix all the ingredients together and dump it into a casserole dish to make, and the taste is amazing.  It tastes like something inbetween a pumpkin pie and sweet potato casserole.

Yum!  I served this as a side dish with out Easter meal.  It definitely tastes like something that should be served at a holiday or special occasion.  It was 5 stars as it but next time I will decrease the sugar to make it less sweet and more savory and decrease the butter to make it healthier.

So, so, good!  I was looking for a way to use the fresh pumpkins I had cooked and pureed, and this was the ticket!  My husband loves it.  I didn't change a thing except added less sugar, only because of personal dietary concerns.  Otherwise, I'm sure the full amount is very good, as well.  A nice change from the typical sweet potato casseroles.

Very good, and so easy to make.  Next time I'll definetily cut down the sugar- It tastes more like a dessert than a side dish.  And I doubled the cinnamon and adden a pinch of nutmeg.

Very good stand by pie recipe sans the crust. We like it very well as a desert. I would chop the sugar in half though and use for a pork side dish in a heart beat (pork is the only time we can stand a little sweet with our meat) LOL

Yum! I made this because I love pumpkin pie and pumpkin bread. I was fearful that it would be just like one or the other but it wasn't! It was truly it's own dish. I served it as a side to dinner and as a treat with coffee and tea. Great! Thank you for sharing!

This is an amazing yummy dish! My husband would sit & eat an entire dish of it if I let him. So easy to whip together & a great alternative to holiday meals where something pumpkin is expected for those of us who don't like pumpkin pie. I always cut the sugar in half & it's still SO good! I also add in some fresh nutmeg but that's just a taste thing. Great Recipe, Thanks!

I had some sugar pumpkins that didn't cure right so I needed to cook them asap. This was easy, didn't require too many ingredients, and turned out great! Great base receipe to alter to suit your needs!  CHANGES: I had a butternut squash that needed to be used, so I made this with one small pumpkin and one butternut squash. Also used brown sugar instead of white, and added nutmeg and a dash of ground cloves.

My wife loved it. Great recipe. Followed the recipe pretty much verbatim however less sugar will be used in the future. I think cutting back on the full amount of butter wouldn't hurt as well as the dish is very rich. This was served as a dessert with a side of whipped cream.

Yummy!  Tastes like pumpkin pie without the shell, only a little thicker in consistency (sort of like bread pudding).  I used fresh pumpkin that was left over from Halloween - I baked and pureed it as recommended by this website and it worked great.

LOVE THIS! Got compliments from my husband, mom, and even mother in law. Way better than pumpkin pie!
I used 1/4 teaspoon salt  and 1/4 baking powder with all purpose flour in replace of self rising flour.

OMG this is delicious--used 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice instead of pinch of cinnamon.  Used 1/2 splenda 1/2 sugar, could have cut back on that, it is VERY sweet.  Used regular flour and added the salt, etc as anther post suggested. Keeper for sure!

This was really pretty good. It is more like crustless pumpkin pie. I used cinnamon, fresh nutmeg and some pumpkin pie spice and it turned out very tasty. Served with cool  whip on top.

I am rating on behalf of my husband who asked me to make more of this right when the first pan got cleaned off.  He loved it.  I made it for a Thanksgiving meal and also got rave reviews.  I actually like it even better cold, it's very much like a crustless pumpkin pie/custard.  It's a dish that gets people's attention, plus it's easy--two thumbs up!

This was really good- on par with sweet potato casserole.  I cut back on the sugar per other reviewers' comments, and added only 1/2c brown sugar instead of 1 c white.  I also didn't have self rising flour, so I just used regular flour plus baking soda and baking powder.  I was happily impressed at how this turned out.  Will make again at holiday time.

My husband used to hate pumpkin anything.  We couldn't have taken him directly to this recipe, or he'd have turned his nose up at it.  Instead, we did it the round about way:  a)  used a butternut squash recipe that had a gingersnap-crumbs and butter topping on it (which he agreed he could tolerate when his children loved it), b)  had that same casserole a few times until he loved it, c)  THEN we tried this one with the following substitutions:  used whole wheat flour combined with the appropriate amount of soda, salt, and b.powder, used a combination of sucanat and stevia for the sugar, and used half skim milk (as that is what we had on hand).  My biggest butternut squash fan still likes butternut squash better, but this squash can come from a can, which helps me on slower days, and what with pumpkin being soooo good for you.... mmmmm.  //  Oh, we used the large can, doubled the recipe, baked a small portion in the microwave for dinner, and the rest in a crockpot for dessert.  The casserole in the microwave was not as fluffy, but was done in less than five minutes.  The dessert in the crockpot was slower, so we were able to put the gingersnap-crumb topping on, and with its fluffy nature, was a real treat with herbal tea.  Yummmmm!

This is good but not great. It's easy to make & different but I don't think I'd make it again.  My husband suggested adding a streusel topping.  That would probably be good.

I made this casserole for both sides of our family and they both loved it!  It was great to have a new dish added to the normal family traditions.  I compared it to a sweet corn casserole type dish.  It is so delicious and almost like dessert.  I doubled the recipee to fill a normal 9x13 casserole dish. I'll be bringing this to Thanksgiving next year too!

I don't really know how to explain this except it is very good. I have never made anything like it. I made only a half a recipe, because I wanted to try it out. I accidentally though kept the flour the same. Since it was all mixed I decided to give it a try and bake it. I may make next time with double the flour also, since it appeared to be a good mistake. It may have actually been too sweet without the additional flour, I am not sure. Either way, it tasted like a mix between a pumpkin and sweet potato pie. And, the one I made had a semi-thick souffle like texture with a nice light sweetness.

This was so delicious. Hubs loved it , but my 6 year old didn't:( Anyway, I used the all-purpose flour substitution of the other reviewers and after one day in the refrigerator its taste and texture reminded me of cheesecake! I only wish I could figure out how to cut some calories out of it... I may try less butter next time and maybe brown sugar instead...

Downright delicious!!! I used 2% evaporated Milk, substituted half the butter with apple sauce, and Reduced the sugar to 6 tbsp. Came out wonderful. Best of all, I sprinkled the casserole with Glazed Pecans (this is a a great addition). We ate it for dessert and my two year old always asked for seconds! (PS If this altered one tasted this good, I can only imagine what the whole version tastes like!)

I loved this dish! I made it for Thanksgiving and although I was the only one who really tried it I plan on making it again for Christmas. I know my family will love it, a great alternative to making sweet potato casserole.

I only made half, using the extra pumpkin after a cake roll. My MIL took it to a potluck where it received wonderful reviews. My daughter loved the leftovers cold the next day. I did add a pinch of ginger and nutmeg, just to my preference.

Not exactly the taste I thought it was going to be. I think some of the comments stating it was a good substitute for pumpkin pie gave me the wrong idea. It smelled sooo delicious but came out really mushy.

I've made this recipe many times with a little more spice, and have always enjoyed it.  Just recently I've been skipping the flour and using 1 cup of whipped cottage cheese and using fat-free evaporated milk - it's healthier and I use it for my gluten-free friends.
Either way, it's a great way to use pumpkin!

After reading reviews I made the following changes.  Reduced sugar to about 2/3 cups, half white and half brown.  I served it as a crustless pie and it was plenty sweet, could probably cut to 1/2 cup.  Used butter and cut it a little but would only use about 2 TSPs next time.  Added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  Would add a little more spice next time b/c I like a little more flavor.  This was a great option for pumpkin pie without the crust.

I used pumpkin pie spice, 3 tsp, and poured mixture into muffin tins to make mini-souffles with this recipe.  Baked at 350 for about 20 minutes (until evenly browned on top).  I then topped them with some candied pecans (sugar, cinnamon, vanilla extract and a little butter) and a scotch infused whipped cream (whipping cream, splash of scotch and a touch of sugar- to taste).

Absolutely loved this just the way it was, very tasty, wonderful texture. My husband said he would like to make 2 batches the next time so he can put raisins and walnuts in the one. I think he's crazy but I don't like raisins or walnuts, lol

Wonderful, I altered it some from previous reviews, and what I had on hand.  Used 1/2c brown sugar & 1/2c applesauce instead of white sugar.  Only used 1/4c butter.  I used Half'n'Half instead of evaporated milk.  Sprinkled cinn & nutmeg on top.  I baked at 375, but still had to cook an extra 5 minutes.  A previous review commented that it didn't save well, so I told the kids to finish it tonight.  I left for a few minutes and when I came back, the bowl was empty.  That never happens - unless it's ice cream.

So easy and yummy! It comes out light and fluffy, I am going to make this all the time. I love pumpkin recipes! You can add extra sugar to make it taste more like a pumpkin pie or less if you want it to be more of a side dish. Either way it will be delicious!

This was a amazing. It is like a cross between a souffle, a cake and pumpkin pie. I VERY picky 13 year old eater went back for 3rds (and the child practically lives on mac and cheese).  I cut down the sugar and since my family loves cinnamon I added quite a bit. I served it with a spicy meat and it was very well accepted. If you love pumpkin pie, you will love this.

Holy smokes this is delicious!  I pooled some suggestions and used the all purpose flour/baking soda combo, plus subbed the butter for 1/4c each of applesauce and canola oil.  I also added extra nutmeg and cinnamon.  It turned out really well, especially when I topped it with some fat free cool whip. Very easy and VERY good!

This is good, but more like a dessert.  It reminds me of a pumpkin custard, not a casserole.  Next time I will cut the amount of butter in half, use 3/4 cup of sugar, and serve for dessert.

This was absolutely fantastic! Great for pumpkin lovers like myself. Although i would add more spice to it the cinnamon didn't come out enough so i put in a nice amount of cinnamon and 2 dashes of all spice in there and it came out great!!! I like the taste of fall in this dish but it needed a little more oomph so i added some fall seasonings and it was perfect! Happy Fall Ya'll!

I like the consistency of this and I did like one of the other reviewers did and made them in muffin cups.  Made for nice, individual servings.  However, I followed other reviewers advice and only used 1/4 cup of sugar.  I would probably try 1/2 cup the next time because they needed something.  Not sure if they are supposed to be a dessert or a side-dish but they were a little bland without more sweetness.

This turned out really good. Texture is less gelatinous than Pumpkin Pie. Everyone liked it except that they wanted the crust. Will make again, but larger batch, and add some Cinnamon, and Nutmeg next time.

Absolutely yummy.  Didn't have evporated milk so I used half whole milk and half vanilla flavored liquid coffee creamer instead and cut the sugar in half.  Used as a side dish for Paprika Pork Chops from this website.  Will be making this for company - thanks so much for the recipe.

my husband, who loves pumpkin pie, really loved this recipe.  I served it with a baked chicken and not during the holiday season (actually its July).  I cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup since everyone said it was too much sugar and my family loved it.

It was surprising how good this tasted!  I thought it might taste like pumpkin pie filling, but it is very creamy and smooth.

This was really good.  As other reviewers stated, it's just like pumpkin pie, without the crust.  It's a bit denser, due to the flour.  We had this for dessert, with a bit of whipping cream and dusting of freshly ground cinnamon.  I will be making this again!

This was INCREDIBLE! i used a 9x13 pan and at first i thought there wasn't enough mix, but it cooked perfectly and everyone loved it. i did use about half the sugar and used blond raw sugar instead (it's what i had) and i thought that made it just right. i think white would have been too sweet. but anyone who likes pumpkin pie should try this!

This was great and easy to make.  But it was a little to sweet for my taste, next time I think I will cut the sugar or subsitute honey for the sugar.

Excellent.  I reduced the sugar by half and served it for dessert with 2T half & half over each serving with a sprinkling of cinnamon/sugar on top.  My 9yo son went back for more, and no extra toppings.  Will definitely make again.

I made this with fresh pumpkin. While it was good, no one wanted to eat it as a side dish. It was just too sweet. But then, we never serve candied sweet potatoes as a side either.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. I used flour, baking soda & baking powder instead of rising flour and it was incredible. It was sort of like pumpkin pie w/out the crust...the best thing is that it was so easy to make.

Double the recipe for a 13x9.  It really only needs half the sugar it calls for.  It's still a bit sweet, but not overpowering.  Freezes well.

Easy, tasty.  A fairly healthy snack/dessert.  I changed proportions and lowered sugar using  two cans of pumpkin, 1 can of milk, 3/4 c flour, 3/4 c brown sugar, 3 eggs, stick and a half butter, more vanilla and cinnamon.   Used two casserole dishes.  I didn't want to have left over pumpkin or evap. milk.  Worked well.

Really good, I used all purposed flour and adjusted as recommended.  I also used 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  We really enjoyed this side dish.  My dish was 8 x 8 and greased.  I'll try a larger dish the next time.

When I made this recipe, it looks nothing like the photo. It looks like a dark cornbread, with a taste and consistency of a cross between pumkpin bread and pumpkin pie. I used this as a side dish, but it could also be a dessert, if you warm it up and put ice cream or whipped cream on top. The taste was very good and unique. I had people asking for the recipe, and it's so easy to make. Especially appropriate on Thanksgiving. I recommend serving it heated.

Fantastic! I used whole wheat flour and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup to make it healthier. My kids said it tasted just like pumpkin pie. We eat this every Halloween. :)

This is super yummy!  Only thing I did differently was use skim milk because I was out of canned and I also added a sprinkling of nutmeg.  Tasted like a pumpkin pie, but the texture was fluffier and lighter.  Very good, but I'll probably cut back on the sugar next time.

Wonderful recipe!! Even my 2 year old loved it! I did cut the butter down to 1 tbsp. and added half cup of apple sauce. I also put half cup of sugar not the full cup. It turned out yummy! Will definitely make again! Thanks for sharing!

This was really nice.  A light texture and wonderful taste without being too overpowering of pumpkin.  I like pumpkin and really liked this dish.  My husband isn't a fan of pumpkin, but said this dish "wasn't bad" and went back for some more.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

What a surprise ~ A little bit sweet but an excellent side dish with any meat. It would be excellent with BBQ. Puffed up like a souffle.

Fixed this for a church function. I forgot to use self-rising flour so I added the necessary ingredients at the last minute to the all-purpose flour I had poured in. It turned out nice but not as full as I think it would have. Everyone complimented me on the dish though. Super easy for a last-minute dish.

This was delicious!  I cut the recipe in half for four of us and baked in four custard cups.  I didn't have self rising flour so I used the substitute of other reviewers.  Also subbed applesauce for all the butter and used fat free evaporated milk and it turned out great and very healthy too!

We had this last night with dinner and it was so wonderful.  I cut back on the sugar to 3/4 C. and could have cut back a little more.  Can't wait to make this again soon.

I was looking for something fast and comforting and this was it! My husband and 2 year old loved it too!    I made this a second time and we think it turned out even better than the first time using the following changes. I used a large can of pumpkin, used half a cup of heavy cream and half cup of whole raw milk for the evaporated milk, used a half cup grade B pure maple syrup in place of the sugar, or 3/4 cup of rapadura, and added a good bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. My family gobbled it up at supper and finished it off for breakfast the next day. We love it!

Wow - so good!  I made a few changes to make it lighter ... I used 1 cup fat-free evaporated milk instead of the regular evaporated milk, 1 cup Splenda instead of sugar, 1 1/3 cups egg whites in the carton rather than the 2 eggs, and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice rather than just the cinnamon.  Everyone loved it!  Next time I think I'll cut down to 3/4 cup Splenda - and there definitely will be a next time!

We love this dish at our house!  I make it with brown sugar instead of white, and pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon due to our personal tastes, but it still gets rave reviews every time!  Plus, it's so easy, and it's an atypical side for a regular weekday dinner.  And you can't beat adding pumpkin to a meal in the fall!  Thanks for sharing this, Lori, it was just what I was looking for!  (I should also add that my kids, 2 and 4, think this is a dessert!)

Very yummy!!  Although, I would consider this a dessert, not a 'casserole' - more like a cross between pumpkin pie and cheesecake.

Very good recipe, it's easy and delicious.  I served it first with meat and thought it was a bit weird cause it tastes more like a dessert.  After that I've made it strictly for dessert.  I substituted the cinnamon for pumpkin pie spieces and I used Splenda instead of sugar.  I only put in about 1/2 c. of the Splenda.  It's a guiltless dessert.

I'd give this one 6 stars if I could!  This is definitely a holiday staple for our family now.  It's creamy, delicious, sweet, almost like pumpkin pie without the crust.  It goes great with chicken or turkey!  Thanks for sharing this beauty. I'm replacing my holiday yams with this!  It's way better!

Loved it loved it loved it!!! It was delicious! You got to try this! This pumpkin casserole was smooth and good. We used half the sugar of what the recipe called for and it was still sweet! We all loved it and it's great for the whole family.

This recipe is delicious! Basically like a pumpkin custard. I made it following another reviewer's substitution for the self-rising flower and only added a 1/4 cup of sugar, which was plenty! I definitely would not make it using any more sugar than this unless maybe I was going to make a pie out of it. Definitely a keeper!

My husband and I love this side dish. I used a few of the other reviewers suggestions. First, instead of using self-rising flour, I used 1/2c. all purpose flour plus 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/8 tsp. baking soda. I have found that whole wheat flour works just as well. I also cut the sugar in half, which is just right. A few other health-minded modifications that I have made were using fat-free or low-fat evaporated milk and using a healthy butter such as SmartBalance. I usually love pumpkin pie minus the crust, so for me - this recipe is perfect! I honestly could eat this every night and by making healthy substitutions, I wouldn't feel guilty at all.

This was pure pumpkin goodness!  Filled my first pumpkin craving of the season nicely.  I too cut the sugar in half and the sweetness was just right, didn't overpower the pumpkin at all.  Next time I'll try it with agave syrup instead of sugar since it has a lower glycemic index and is sweeter so you can use less.  This was the only menu item of which my 2 yr old ate all at dinner that night.  I even ate some of it cold for breakfast and it was still tasty... almost like guilt-free pumpkin pie for breakfast.

Fabulous recipe.  I don't like pumpkin pie but this was like having a crustless, tastier pie!  I loved this recipe as did my son who won't eat any fruit or veggies.  Great way to get the nutrition of pumpkin in them.  I didn't have evaporated milk so I used regular and just cut back a little and it was fine.  Almost souffle like. I also added a pinch of nutmeg and cloves.  Definitely a great recipe for Thanksgiving too.

Delicious and easy to make, though be aware that it's sweet enough to work as a dessert.  The consistency is fluffy, something like a pumpkin mousse.  It was great both hot and cold.

This recipe was delicious.  Just like pumpkin pie, but without the crust.  I got a ton of compliments.

Was more like a bread pudding. I liked it but will add more spices and cut down on the butter.

I used 2tbsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon and 3/4 cup sugar instead 1 cup and it turned out great! We ate it as a dessert and it's kind of like bread pudding! Great recipe!

My son prepared this recipe (he likes recipes with pumpkin), using organic cane sugar. Good as side dish or dessert. My daughter prepared Dawn's Candied Walnuts(Allrecipes) the same evening and we paired the two together..yummy!
Update....made this at Christmas myself, but substituted baked sweet potatoes in place of the pumpkin. Used a bit less sugar and on  a whim, used a 1/4 cup of coconut creamer and less evaporated milk for additional flavor.  Opted to use a mixer for a fluffier texture.  I didn't get to have seconds, it was the first empty dish on the table.  Next time I am going to combine the pumpkin with sweet potato and make extra! Great recipe, thanks bunches.

I've cooked this twice in as many weeks now. Probably going to be thrice next week. 
Some one mentioned using canned pumpkin but the oven roasted pumpkin is  absolutely delicious. 
I put it in my blender for a minute on puree.
 I, also, doubled the  ingredients then cooked it in a large rectangular glass dish. 
Serve with whipped cream. 
Saved to my favs. 
Thanks for sharing!

I don't know if I would call this "casserole."  We call it "Pumpkin Stuff" at my house now :).  It's more like a custard??  My healthier version:  I cut way down on the sugar (use agave syrup or a little brown sugar instead), use about 2 T. of butter, use whole wheat flour, regular 2% milk instead of evaporated.  Rating 4 instead of 5 not for taste but simply because it's not really a casserole and is very dessert-like.  Great way to serve a veggie to picky kids, though!  We enjoy this.

Great recipe!! a bit sweet - I cut the sugar in half.  I've used both fresh, roasted pumpkin (tastes much better) and canned puree (still very good!!)  I do not usually have self rising, so I use as others suggest - all purpose, with baking powder, salt and baking soda.

I thought this was really good. I cut back on the sugar as many reviewers recommended. It was still on the sweet side... I think I would go ahead and use the full amount of sugar and use this dish as an after dinner treat.

I made this for my family trying to expand the vegetable selection of our weekly menus.  I followed suit and reduced the sugar, plus I upped the savory seasoning a bit to make it less dessert-y.  We have a rating system in our house, based on how soon they would like to eat a dish again (tomorrow, next week, next month, next year) and this scored 'tomorrow' by everyone!  Huzzah!!  Thanks for a great new family favorite!

Amazing!  Made minor tweaks by using fat-free evap milk,  light brown instead of white sugar, and topped with a simple crumble with pecans.  My boyfriend loved every bite and this is now a sure addition for our Thanksgiving to come!

Very good indeed. I wanted to use my gargantuan Halloween pumpkin- so I found a recipe for fresh pumpkin puree-then made this casserole.
Because the evaporated milk comes in a 12 ounce can, I "one-and-a-halved" the recipe. I used 1/2 more of everything as written except the sugar. Based on other reviews- I left that at 1 cup. AND I added 3/4 of a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice (in lieu of the pinches of cinnamon.)I really like the consistency- it's smooth and creamy yet firm, sort of like a mousse. It's a little sweet- but not like a dessert. I made it today as a trial run for Thanksgiving- Going to put it in the line-up!

I made this for a party and everyone loved it. I am a HUGE pumpkin fan and bake pumpkin treats constantly. So I consider myself a very good judge of anything pumpkin related. It is not to much like a dessert. It is a great casserole that has more of a dinner taste rather then dessert taste. I highly reccomend trying it.

LOVE this recipe, but I do 1.5 times the recipe so the amounts are more even (i.e. 1 whole pumpkin, 1 can evaporated milk, etc) except I still do 1c sugar and 1/2c butter. The first time I used all-purpose flour with the extras to substitute (salt, baking powder, etc) but the next time I used self-rising flour and the texture was a little better (less runny).

I used 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the 2 pinches ground cinnamon.  This was perfect!  This is less sweet than sweet potato casserole, which is great when you want something that's more like a light side than a heavy dessert.

This was delish!  The only thing I did different was put mini marshmallows on top for the last 10 minutes of baking.  It reminds me of pumpkin pie without the crust! Will make again :)

This was like super easy pumpkin pie filling.  Fitting as a side dish or dessert and delicious hot or cold.  I substituted 2% milk for evaporated milk (forgot to buy it) and added 3/4 teaspoon baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt to AP flour instead of using self-rising - worked out fine.

This was awesome!  I took it as my contribution to my family's Thanksgiving.  My grandma (who is quite possibly the best cook in the world) asked for the recipe!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  It's a keeper!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I live in a country that doesn't have sweet potatoes, so I wanted to find a pumpkin-y recipe to use as a substitute this Thanksgiving.  Today I did a trial run to test this recipe out and allrecipes.com never fails me.  The flavor of this dish is out of this world--better than sweet potatoes!  I made several adaptations: 1) I used measurable Splenda instead of sugar, and I only used 1/2-2/3 C based on others' reviews of how sweet the dish is.  I found the sweetness level to be perfect.  2) One of our friends who will be having Thanksgiving with us is gluten-intolerant, so instead of normal self-rising flour, I used corn flour and a bit of baking powder.  This recipe calls for so little flour anyway that I don't think it made much of a difference in the flavor--it tastes great to me!  3) I can't get evaporated milk here, so I measured out 2 cups of milk and simmered it down to 1 cup.  This was my first attempt at making evaporated milk, but it worked out great in this recipe.  The casserole burned on the surfaces where it touched my glass dish (bottom and sides), but I'm not sure if this was due to the corn flour (I've had other corn flour-based things burn) or if it is due to my stupid oven that doesn't have a proper temperature gauge (just "level 1" and "level 2" Ugh.).  I'm pretty sure my oven was a bit too hot, but to overcome this problem on Thanksgiving Day, I will set the casserole dish in a pan of water while it is baking.  Thanks for such a fabulous recipe!

Took the advice and cut the sugar to 1/2.  My pumpkin loving son was in awe and the rest of the family liked it too!

This is heavenly! I made it to use up some leftover canned pumpkin. I made it early in the day and we snacked on it throughout a day until there was none left by dinnertime! Didn't matter, it could be eaten at anytime and any temperature. Sooo good!

Wow. I'm not usually a fan of casseroles but anything with pumpkin in it is always good. This is amazing. I made it for a Halloween party and everyone loved it. I don't know if I would serve it with just any meal. It's not really sweet enough to be a dessert but it probably wouldn't go well with just anything. I'd love to make it any time, though, it's so easy and it tastes great. I'll definitely make this again, probably for Thanksgiving or even Christmas.

This tastes really good.  Next time I'm going to cut down on the sugar though. One cup seemed like a lot, especially for something that wasn't supposed to be dessert. Great for the fall season.

This had a really great taste, but I'm not sure if it cooked up the right way?? I was expecting a little more of a cake-like texture, but it came out just like pumpkin pie, which was still terrific:-) I used canned pumpkin, so maybe that had something to do with it. The kids had mixed reviews--one loved it, the other one (who eats the heck out of pumpkin pie) didn't really go for it--but then again, he would say candy was yucky if I told him it tasted good--whatever! We grown-ups chowed down and I will definitely make this again.

This is delicous!!! But I thought it was going to be a side dish... it is not. It is a lovely dessert. If I make it again as a side dish, I will use only 1/4 or 1/2 cup of sugar.

My son and I couldn't get enough of it, but we are real pumpkin lovers.  We loved it with breakfast--it is so yummy/buttery/hot pumpkiny yum!!  My husband only thinks of pumpkin in pie, so he didn't really eat it.

My 5-year old kept saying, "Yuck, I don't like pumpkin" and was scrunching up her face refusing to try it.  I convinced her by reading the reviews to her, and after she tasted it, she said, "Mom I want to write a review like other people and say 'YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!!'"  I have to agree with her!!  And by the way, she is the 2nd pickiest eater in my house, after my 22 month old son, who is the PICKIEST eater - he just kept saying, "More!"  My entire family loved this recipe - absolutely delicious.  It is very light, yet still creamy, and kind of has a vanilla custard undertone in it.  I didn't use all the pumpkin it called for, because I used the smaller can of pumpkin which comes to slightly under 2 cups.  So I actually feel it could be a little more pumpkin-y, but that may be why.  If you are really into the pumpkin pie kind of thing, you can probably add some nutmeg and more cinnamon to spice it up a bit, as it is very mild.  I also cut down on the sugar a bit; I cut down in the sugar to 1/2 cup, which still is fine. I also didn't have the self-rising flour and made my own (1/2 c flour, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp baking soda). I'll be sure to make this again and also to serve it at parties/holidays.  TRY IT - I don't think you'll regret it! updated 3/2009 - Just a note that I first reviewed this long ago & continue to make this frequently, EVERYONE who tries it, loves it . . .

This recipe is awesome!! I was looking for an easy recipe for pumpkin, and this is exactly what I was looking for! Next time I think I'll use a bit less sugar, it did turn out pretty sweet. Not horribly sweet, I just like things a little less sweet. (I should've been born in Britain I think) I also used 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon. THANK YOU!

Yum! I used a 15 oz can of pumpkin and 1/8 tsp cinnamon, cooked it in a 9x9 greased pan. I LOVE this casserole, it was great as a side dish and could be used as a desert too. Don't wait for a holiday to enjoy this dish.

My husband loved this but I was disappointed.  I expected a 'pumpkin bread' but it's more like crust-less pumpkin pie.           
It's very easy to make!

Delicious!!  I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup, added 2tsp pumpkin pie spice and 2tsp cinnamon.  Served as a dessert with whipped cream.  Absolutely making this again and again!

This was really tasty! I don’t have self-rising flour, so threw in 1/4tsp of baking powder and a pinch of salt in with the regular all-purpose flour. I had a huge can of pumpkin, which was enough to make two batches. I like that it gets a little sugary crisp on the sides and top, while the center is more soft. It’s sweet, but too much. Honestly, I could cut the sugar in half and throw in a bit of sage or rosemary to make it a little more on the savory side, but it’s delicious as it is. Thank you!

Very tasty!  In fact, my family all thought it was tasty,  even those that claim to be non pumpkin lovers! We will definitely make this again. Oh, and I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar, it was plenty sweet enough.  Thanks for this delicious recipe.

Super delicious! Pumpkin pie flavor, but not as sweet. Surprisingly, it did make a great side dish!

My family asks for this and looks forward to each fall when I start making it again. One cup of sugar is too much for us. We reduce it to 3/4 cup for a dessert or 1/2 cup for a side dish.

This is my #1 go-to dish for all fall/holiday season parties! I have made it countless times and never bring home an ounce of leftovers. I get so many compliments and it's SO easy to make! I do cut back on the sugar slightly though, using 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup. Fits/rises nicely in a 3-quart casserole dish.

This was excellent.  I used purée left over from the pumpkin pies made from pie pumpkins. Might have been just a little sweeter than normal, but still was really tasty. Mine could have stayed in the oven another 15 minutes or so to finish baking the center.

Delicious recipe! This is basically pumpkin pie without the crust and when you're not a big fan of crust anyways, this is perfect. This is definitely more of a dessert than a side dish, though. Love by the whole family!

I used only a half cup of brown sugar and called it a crustless pumpkin pie. Still too sweet for a side dish in my opinion but delicious.

Very good!  I did cut the sugar to 1/2 cup white and 2 Tbs brown and cut the margarine to 1/4 cup and also used skim evaporated milk because that's what I had handy.  I did use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ginger and 1/8 tsp cloves.  I baked it in a 8 x 8 baking dish.  Yummy!  I also modified the flour to self rising by adding 1/2 tsp bkg pdr, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp soda.  I served it as a dessert rather than a side dish.

So good! I love pumpkin pie and this is nice and easy for a twist on it. I used 3/4 cup whole milk with 1/4 cup heavy cream instead of the evaporated milk. I also added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon and baked in a 9 x 13 cake pan. Both my kids (9 & 2) loved it! Definitely a keeper!

Very sweet!  I would make this again, but it's more a dessert instead of a side dish.  This tastes just like pumpkin pie without the crust. 
Would serve with whipped cream in a dessert dish next time.

We enjoyed this casserole. It's not as sweet as pumpkin pie, but still has a pleasing flavor and is a good way to have more vegetables in your diet. I will definitely make it again.

This is so amazing--better than pumpkin pie. Go ahead and use brown sugar instead of white! It's also great with rum extract.

This is one of my favorite recipes.   It is very good and I use a pie pan and bake it like a pie and you do not have to make the crust for it....yet it firms up fine and slices easily--just like a pie.

Came across this recipe and tried it and it was yummy.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, tried it with 1/2 and 1/2  milk/cream and topped it with chopped pecans.  Everyone loved it. Thank you for sharing.

delicious. And i did it gluten-free with all-purpose flour, just delicious. I also multiplied the portions by 3/2 to make good use of my 12 oz can of evap'd milk... and it filled up the casserole dish nicely.

This absolutely yummy. I did subsitute Truvia Baking Blend for the sugar  and used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 Olive Oil, instead of all butter.  This will be a must make for all future  holidays, in my house.

Love this recipe. Been using it for a couple years now and it's so delish and not too sweet like pies. It's the best part of pie without the crust. I always follow the top reviewer instructions with the flour and baking powder, etc. and I always add cinnamon, fresh nutmeg, and ginger. One time I used rum extract due to not having Vanilla, and that came out super yums as well!

I cut the sugar in half and used regular flour instead of self-rising and this came out perfectly. Not too sweet, dreamily fluffy. Will make again and again.

I like it, but only use half the sugar or less. Make sure the butter is very soft to help blend.

I don't recommend for diabetics or people sensitive to sweets. I cut out half the sugar (I used real sugar, not artificial sweetener) and added some extra pumpkin, but still found it too sweet.

This tastes awesome.  I combined about 1/2 tsp of All Spice, ground Cloves spices, about 1 Tbls sugar with 1/2 cup Walnuts.  And then ground the up to almost a powder and sprinkled on top while the casserole is still hot and "sticky" on top.   I don't like pumpkin pie but I love this recipe!

This is a good base recipe but not as a side dish. I make this dish for dessert by cutting out half the butter and adding heaps of marshmallows on top the last 10 minutes of baking. For more taste, I also mix in 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of ginger, 1/4 tsp of cloves, and a touch of fresh nutmeg. You could also make a streusel topping for it instead of using marshmallows. I've tried this recipe with fresh pumpkin but the canned taste just as good and is a lot less work.

Very yummy! Everyone at the table went back for seconds! The consistency was a bit runnier than I expected, but it tasted amazing. It is meant to be more like a casserole and less like a bread. The pumpkin purée that I had was already quite sweet naturally, so I only added a 1/4 cup sugar. I substituted margarine for the butter. One teaspoon of nutmeg also tastes wonderful in this. The recipe doesn't specify the size casserole dish, so I guessed the size. I used a square 8 inch Pyrex dish, and worked perfectly.

Delicious! I took the advice of other reviewers and halved the sugar as well as substituted 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup olive oil for the butter to make it a little bit healthier. I also used 1 tsp Pumpkin Pie Spice for the dashes of cinnamon and got many compliments at our family Christmas dinner. There wasn't a molecule left!

Loved it! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is that I had to alter the recipe. As instructed by others, we reduced the sugar by half. It was plenty sweet then. It was sweet, but good for a side dish. If we had kept the sugar the same, it would have been too sweet for a side dish, but not nice enough for a dessert.

Fantastic dish! When I think of casserole, I think of a conglomerate of vegetables mixed together in a baking dish. This however, is more like a pumpkin flavored custard. Very Dessert.

this would be an excellent side dish to ANY meal, but especially thanksgiving.  I followed the recipe without making any changes, one note, this IS a pudding, and not a cake, the finished texture as soft - I was expecting more of a "cake"

My son and I decreased the butter to 1/4 c. and the sugar to 1/2 c. after reading review of it being rich and sweet.  It was perfect!  He wanted to make some again right after dinner.  :)

After reading the other reviews I decided to cut the sugar in half.  Most of the recipes on here that call for sugar are way too sweet for us, so I thought this would be true of this recipe as well.  While I did like this, it could have used a little more sugar than I put in it, but definitely not the full amount the recipe calls for.

I don't like the typical sweet potato or yam casserole (with the nasty marshmallows on top), so I tried this with the leftover canned pumpkin I had on hand.  It was Delicious! Like someone else mentioned, not as sweet as I was expecting, which was great. It perfectly complemented the savory dishes we had on our Thanksgiving table, but this will definitely be made again throughout the year.  Similar to a mild, not too sweet or overly spiced pumpkin pie. Very good!

Terrific. I substituted 1/2 C applesauce for the butter (hint: the small individual cups of applesauce for kids are about a half cup and then nothing left over to go bad in the back of the fridge), whole wheat for the flour (adjusted to make it self rising),and cut the sugar by half. I also added a heavy pinch of the following: nutmeg, cloves, ground ginger. Turned out beautifully. As well, on later versions of this delicious casserole, bc I am always trying to find ways to make things even healthier, I added half a cup of puréed zucchini & cauliflower. It muted the flavors a bit, but still great!

Yummy!  I recommend using a dish smaller than a 9x13.  I used only 3/4 cup sugar.

This is really quite good. I made it according to directions and didn't find it too sweet at all, contrary to others' reviews. But I am southern so it takes a lot to reach sugar overload for me. My 2 year old loved it as did my husband. He said he would rather have this than sweet potato casserole for holidays. BTW - sweet potato casserole is sweeter than this is, for those looking for a sweet index.

I have celiac disease, no gluten or wheat allowed.  This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  No one in my family even missed the crust!  It is delicious as a side or dessert with topping.

My family loved this, especially my husband.  I used FF skimmed evaporated milk.  I don't keep self-rising flour around, so I used the recipe on this site and halved it to replace the self-rising flour in the recipe.  I felt that the this was a little too sweet and will cut the sugar next time.  We had some whipped topping in the house and that was great on top.  Kind of like a crustless pumpkin pie!  I also ended up having to cook this a good 10 minutes longer than the recipe stated.

Just finished making this and WOW!!!! It is Great!! The best.  Better than pumpkin pie in my opinion. Plus, no crust (safe from those extra calories). This is my new Favorite pumpkin recipe.  Also put just a dash of nutmeg in the batter and used olivio margarine instead of butter, brown sugar instead of white. Yum! Yum! To Good!!!!!!!! Thanks so Much for this fine recipe.

This is TERRIFIC.  I made it several times over the Thanksgiving/Christmas holidays, and each time at least one person asked for the recipe.  Delicious.  I have experimented with adding less sugar (or substituting Splenda) and used regular flour with a bit of baking powder instead of self-rising flour.  Every time it's been terrific!

This is the best recipe ever!!!  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner. It was so easy and you don't even miss the crust!  I added more sugar than the recipe called for because to me, pumpkin tends to be slightly bitter.  My very picky brothers and Father absolutely loved this and couldn't stop themselves from coming back for more.  They generally hate pumpkin pie.  This is a keeper.

I took everyone's advice and used 1/2 cup of sugar.  I served this with a roasted turkey breast, and green beans.  The kids asked for seconds! Our 11 yr old asked if we could have it all the time.  Wow!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe but put only half the sugar.  It was still very sweet.  Several people said it tastes like a dessert.  It was a hit.  I will make it again!

This recipe was delicious. Everyone loved it the other evening. I used fresh pumpkin since I prefer that to canned pumpkin. Very easy dish and it reminds me of my pumpkin custard pie from my great grandmother.

Made for Reese's 2015. They loved it! I used about 3/4c Splenda and 1/4c sugar. Instead of the 1/2c. self-rising flour, I used: 1/2c. all purpose flour plus 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1/8 tsp. baking soda
