I had intended to make this a Strawberry Pie, however, my Strawberry Kool Aid disappeared somewhere after checking out at the Super Market.  All I had at home was a package of Kool Aid Lemonade, so I thought what the heck, I'm going to give this a shot.  Let me tell you, not only is this pie super easy, and fool proof, it is also very tasty. Give it a try, you will be quite surprised.

This is slightly different from my childhood favorite, which was made with evaporated milk and frozen.  This one is much easier (which earned the 5 stars) and could be so much fun in the various Kool-Aid flavors/colors.

This is very similar to my mom's Kool-Aid pie, which her's entails different proportions, same ingredients. However, do try something less different when you use the unsweetened packages. What a great refresher when I used the Peach Mango flavored Kool-Aid (use the entire packet). Easy and excellent recipe...best recommendation, FREEZE it for a few hours to get a better handle of even slicing and serving, it will thaw slightly on the plate and still get that great creaminess. Besides, we like it best frozen!!!

I love making this pie but I also add one 8oz package of cream cheese and I use the extra creamy cool whip to make it stand higher in the graham cracker crust. Also try using two packs of orange kool-Aid and your pie will taste like a dreamsicle popsicle.  I made them for Thanksgiving this year and they were gone in the blink of an eye.

Super easy and a nice treat. We made grape which wasn't my favorite but it was what the hunny picked. He suggested next time to start with half a packet of koolaid and then add a little bit at a time as it was a little overwhelmingly grapey

I made this pie today and I must say it is absolutely wonderful, not to mention how simple it is to make. I used a package of lemonade kool-aid this time and can't wait to try other flavors. Thanks for sharing your recipe blue.

A friend of mine taught me this recipe in the military 28 years ago in the mini graham cracker cups when we lived in the barracks and could not have a lot of groceries and did not have cars to go anywhere :-).  I still make it today using the individual crusts (they come with little tops). An entire pie is too enticing, and I only use lemonade.  Glad to see this recipe on here, it brought back memories.....

The recipe above was so SWEET it made me squint!  For the next pie, I reduced the sweetened condensed milk by nearly half and substituted about 3 oz. of fat-free unsweetened condensed milk and about 4 oz. of additional whipped topping.  The result was a much better pie.  I recommend using the extra creamy topping and freezing the pie as well.  For both the strawberry and lemon versions, top with sliced strawberries which freeze well and draw sweetness from the filling.  This pie is a real surprise. The fruit flavors seem far more authentic thus than in the Kool-aid itself (which I don't much like).

This was by far the easiest dessert I have ever made.  My 7 year-old loved it so much, and because she heard me say how easy it was, she made one herself.  Her pie was just as delicious as mine.  If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would.  We both made lemonade pies.

Where has this recipe been all my life? Fabulous!  I only had chocolate graham crackers, so I tried raspberry KoolAid with a few fresh berries on top.  Off the charts good!  I'm going to make a couple to bring to the Labor Day picnic this weekend.

Very delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly as written.  Used lemonade Kool-Aid.  It was the first desert to go and I only got 1/2 piece.  I can't wait to try with different flavors.

This is so good, light and creamy and great for summer.  The recipe I first had also Included an 8 oz pkg of cream cheese so that’s how I’ve always made it.  The last time I made it I didn’t have any cool whip, so I made my own with heavy whipping cream. And it was even creamier!!

I made this pie a few days ago using pink lemonade flavor. It was really easy and yummy when wanting to have a dessert that's not too time consuming. I shared only a few slices with my coworkers; the rest is for me! Yay!

I love this especially with the lemon flavored drink mix.  I've used the graham cracker crust and also used Ginger Snaps as that was all I had at the time. Great either way.  Quick, easy, and oh so creamy and refreshing.

Tried the filling right after I mixed it all together and could not stand the pronounced aftertaste from the condensed milk.  However, after I froze the pie and tried it the next day, the flavors had mellowed and the filling had a wonderful, silky texture.  I used an entire packet of lemon flavor drink mix and did not think it overpowered the pie at all.

Made it with cherry and lemonade Koolaid.  Added a small amount of softened cream cheese to the lemonade pie for a more tart taste.  Both were excellent.  Gave the recipe to one of my coworkers.

It was very good but I made a few changes. Only use half a can of the condensed milk otherwise it would be sickening sweet. I also added 8 oz. of cream cheese.

Surprisingly delicious and so easy to make! My only changes were to use a half a packet of Kool-aid as the cook suggests and to use real cream instead of cool-whip. (I think I might be the only person on the planet who hates cool-whip.) Real whipped cream also cuts down on the sugar factor. Excellent recipe which I will definitely make again.

I cannot tell you how awesome this recipe is! Made this for Easter. I chose lemonade kool aid. Ended up dicing some fresh strawberries  & thin lemon slices. Folded some strawberries into the mix for a lil extra. Used yellow food coloring for effect. Also used the extra creamy Cool whip. This was easy, budget-friendly, and a real crowd pleaser. Will make again & again. In case anyone was wondering, you can make this in advance & freeze it. I made it the morning before Easter. Stuck it in a freezer ziploc, transferred it to the fridge that night about 11 PM. Took it out & ate it at room temp noon the next day. Everyone raved! Thanks, blue:)

Based on other reviews, we made this with 2 packets of orange and added cream cheese then froze the pie. It was all eaten, which doesn't always happen with pie in this house, and everyone really enjoyed it. I think you could use the filling for popsicles as it freezes smoothly and is very creamy. The cream cheese did add a tang, of course, so we may leave that out next time depending on what flavor we choose.

I'm my neighborhood candy lady, and I've been selling this pie for years. Its amazing and so foolproof! I recommended Ice Blue Raspberry Lemonade and Pink Lemonade Kool Aid. They're big hits. Don't be afraid to add a few drops of food color to boost their brightness. Kids love the wacky colors. Personal experience has shown me though, that generic condensed milk is not sweet enough and generic whipped topping will not result in a fluffy pie. Its so easy and with so few ingredients, pay the extra pennies and get Cool Whip and Eagle Brand. Or just go to Kroger's, they're just as good. It'll be so worth it.

This is my very first time trying this recipe.  I am not huge fan on making desserts but this one was quick, easy and very inexpensive.
I made my pie with the flavored kool aid mixes, black cherry and lemonade, that like together.  I love this and the prep time is right up my alley.  Guess who's making a couple of pies for Christmas?

Super easy to make but a little too sweet for my taste. Was nice and creamy. Just like other reviewers, I also recommend freezing.

Good stuff. We used a regular pastry crust, replaced the milk with the fat free version, and used watermelon drink powder, and topped the pie with another 8oz of whip cream. Very creamy cool and delicious for a nice summer treat

Easy and delicious. If you can find a pineapple flavored KoolAid, use that along with a can of crushed pineapple (drained) for a yummy dessert. It was a favorite among coworkers at my previous job.

This recipe was so easy and delicious. I made them for Christmas. I made lemon-lime and orange. Everyone was skeptical at first when I told them what they were. Once they tried them they were pleasantly surprised. I can't wait to try the other flavors.

Tasted a little to much  like Kool Aid for me.  Yes, I guess I should have expected that.  Just didn't quite have the taste I wanted.  That said, I did enjoy eating it, and I may try again with a different flavor someday

My husband really likes this and it is very easy.  I have used both grape and strawberry flavored kool-aid and we didn't like the grape at all.  I add fresh strawberries on top!
