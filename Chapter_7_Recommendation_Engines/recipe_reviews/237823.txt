In my experience frozen strawberries aren't very sweet (unless you freeze them yourself at the peak of ripeness) so I didn't have high hopes for a sweet smoothie since this called for no sweetener AND plain Greek yogurt but the vanilla whey protein powder had just enough in it to make it the perfect sweetness. I chose to replace the milk with water since it called for both yogurt and protein powder. I also cut the yogurt to 1/2 cup (I tend to think greek yogurt is quite tart). Milk, protein powder and yogurt seemed like protein overkill for me. I didn't have mint in my garden so I skipped that also. The smoothie is VERY thick from the frozen fruit. Even my Vitamix needed a little attention to get ingredients to blend but adding more liquid would help solve this problem. I chose to give it a little time and use the tamper to push the ingredients into the blades. This may be a problem with a regular blender so letting the fruit thaw a bit before blending would be helpful. This smoothie turned out very tasty. I enjoyed it!

My 10-year-old and I liked this recipe. I used fresh strawberries, vanilla Greek yogurt, and no protein powder. My daughter preferred it with a tsp of sugar. I liked it fine without. The mint was nice and gave it a light, refreshing taste.

This is a great recipe for beginners to the smoothie world. I omitted the whey, and added a tbsp of vanilla extract. I added black cherries & 1 banana, blueberries. And I added just over a tbsp of fresh honey. omitted sugar for a little healthier option. This was both sweet & tart, but perfect! Fills you up. Thanks for submitting!!

I added some bananas because I thought it needed more  flavor, which I think was a good call

This was good; though no mint but did add soft tofu, which made it smooth...a nice added touch
