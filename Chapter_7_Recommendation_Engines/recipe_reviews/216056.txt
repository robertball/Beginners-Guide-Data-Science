I found this dish had a lot of potential but really lacking in flavor.  It was quite bland and I figured out why.  Why simmer canned beans for 8 hours and then discard the onion and garlic?  This caused everything at this point to be way over done (8 hours cooking on LOW).  Why add garlic salt when you've added fresh garlic cloves and kosher salt?  Increase the garlic cloves and kosher salt.  Lastly, by adding the sausage only long enough to smell the sausage fails to infuse it's flavor into the beans.  Bottom line, cook the whole thing except for the kale for about 4 to 5 hours.  That said, I made it again, added 3 chopped serrano peppers, 1 with seeds, increased the garlic cloves 8 fold and added the kale half way through.  To me, the secret here is to infuse all of these wonderful flavors including the sausage into the beans and kale.

Have been cooking Green Soup for years (with almost same recipe).  Delicious. Don't understand need for 8 hour cooking of canned beans, or why you would discard onion and garlic. Kale would best be cut very finely.  I usually add a few potatoes.  Thing I'll make some right now.

I changed it up a little; chopped up the onion and garlic, threw it in the crockpot with the chicken/beef stock, beans, sausage, and carrots.  Don't add any extra salt, the sausage will take care of that!  Also added a few tablespoons of tomato paste and a splash of red wine.  let it cook on high for around 3 hours, then added the chopped up kale.  SOOOO delicious

The proportions are great, but I've made a few changes to the method. I start with the sausage, halved and sliced in the pot with some olive oil so it won't stick. I cook that for a little while, then remove the suasage and add the carrots, cook for about 3-5 min, then add the onion, celery and garlic (half a jalipeno, seeded deveined, sometimes) and cook until they are soft. I add all the the other ingredients, including sausage and simmer until done, about an hour-and-a-half. I make this every few weeks during the cold months and the whole family loves it.

I left out the garlic salt, and added a little more paprika [in addition to what's in the Andouille], and I added some marjoram and saffron.  I envision making this again and trying adding oregano, tarragon, chervil, or basil.  Also, I used Lingui√ßa Portuguese sausage, because I happened across it in a Latin market near me;  it's not usually readily available in my area.

This soup was tastey to me.  Some of my kids and husband really liked it and some kids thought it was just alright. 

 I do not think the serving amount is correct, or maybe I just serve big bowls of soup, but I think not. Thank goodness I used another quart of chicken stock for a total of 3 quarts of stock. 

I followed other suggestions and chopped the onion and minced the garlic, and added extra garlic. I substituted green chard for kale. I also added bit of red pepper flakes and tossed in about 3/4 cup of frozen okra to help thicken it up just a bit.

This was a GREAT soup but I gave it 4 stars because I had to modify a few things to get it to great. As other reviews suggested (and my slow-cooker intuition told me) I removed the sausage from casing and fried it with onions and put it in the very beginning. I didn't have broth, so u used 2 tbsp of beef bouillon and to make it lower cal, I used spicy turkey sausage. Also, I left the onions and garlic in and upped them both (as well as the carrots and celery). The soup came out SUPER hearty, healthy and flavorful despite being low-cal, low-fat, low-sodium. This was a great base for a recipe that I tweaked and fine-tuned.

Yummy! After reading all the reviews, and following Beatrice's time table, I started with a hot italian sausage, added 1 jalapeno, cut the recipe down to 10 servings (as dinner it was 4), and it was ready in 1 1/2 hours.
This will be a regular around here all winter!

Awesome concept! I got the non-veggie eaters in my family to eat KALE! I substituted zuchini and mushrooms instead of carrots and celery. I also took out the beans and added ground turkey. Because I was in a hurry I cooked the sausage and the turkey in broth on medium high on the stove, this brought out the juices and I could see oil floating on top. A few hours in the slow cooker and this was great broth. Did not throw out my precious garlic and onions. Added the meat vegetables and kale and as soon as the kale melted it was perfect!

Made this recipe last night. I recommend cooking it the way I did. I thought it was delicious. ( All of the ingredients were cooked well and not mushy) 

 Set Crockpot on low for 8 hours. 

1. Add beans, stock, half onion, carrots, * 1 can corn, * 1 potato chopped small

2. After 3 hours add sausage, celery 

3. For  the last hour remove onion, add kale and put crockpot on warm setting 


4. ENJOY!

My husband is from New Bedford, MA where Portuguese food is popular.  He loved this soup.  It was my first time making it and I wanted to surprise him.  He suggested add Brussels sprouts and substituting red beans for white.  I skipped the carrots because I didn't think he liked cooked carrots, but he missed them. We will definitely make it again.

The right sausage is critical- don't skimp on flavor. I actually browned the sausage, onion , carrot, celery with thyme first. Then add everything but kale and put on low for 4 or hi for 8. Add kale for 20-30 minutes with some orzo.

I had already made white beans, and I used ground sausage.  One liter of beef stock.  All this in a crockpot. When I came home it was a little bland. So I threw in a package of chicken gravey and pork gravey. ( just the powder). That did the trick.  Finally I chopped some fresh kale, put it in my bowl and poured the soup on top! !!  YUMMY

I used these ingredients but substituted a fresh chicken basil sausage. Added half quartered onion and crushed garlic to only chicken broth along with spices. Also added some crumbled left over bacon bits. When onion nearly cooked added sausage for 1 and a half hours. Removed solids from broth and skinned sausage and broke it and onions into smaller chunks. Put kale and carrots into broth for another 90 min. Added sausage and removed onions, bacon bits and crushed garlic. Added pinto beans (on hand) and a can of spicy pepper crushed tomato. Heated to temperature at YUM!
