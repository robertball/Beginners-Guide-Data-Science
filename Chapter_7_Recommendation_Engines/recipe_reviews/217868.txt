If you don't have curry paste you can use curry powder instead plus 3T ketchup of tomato paste.  

Also you don't need to add each thing and wait a minute.  You can just caramelize the onions and add the dry ingredients, then the wet, then add chicken and cook 10 minutes in the sauce and veggie mixture.  

The meat will absorb the sauce better if it's cooked in it.  It will come out more tender as well.  If you chop the chicken in strips or chunks you can cook it for 10 minutes and it will be perfect.

We liked this very much. I used thighs in place of breasts, sour cream in place of cream cheese, and 1T of curry powder in place of paste because that's what I had on hand. The flavors all blended very well.  I could see using coconut milk as well in this dish since it has a Thai flair to it.  After cooking the chicken in the sauce (why bother cooking it separately?) I removed it and added about 3-4 cups of cooked brown rice I had left over from another meal to the sauce.  Then I cooked them together until the sauce thickened slightly and the rice was heated through.  Excellent!  Adding this to our favorites list. Thank you!

Just right combo of sweet and spicy.  I will make this again and again.  I used an extra tablespoon of cream cheese as I did not have cream, otherwise made as written.

This is my first curry dish out of more than ten that has actually turned out edible.  I didn't have all the ingredients called for as this was an impromptu attempt to use of chicken.  Even without certain ingredients this was still really good.  Next time I will be certain to pick up some onion and peppers for this dish.  Since I also didn't have cream cheese, I used a bit of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce.

This was awesome. My whole family loved it. I have been looking for a recipe since trying it at a local restaurant. I replaced the cream with evaporated milk and some corn starch to thicken; cut back on the butter and oil and used light cream cheese. I also did not have paste so just used the curry powder. Even with all these changes, it was really very tasty. I served it on penne noodles with stir fried veggies ( the kids told me they wanted me to make it again. ) Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't have, nor could I find curry paste, so I used ketchup and curry powder to make my own, per a reviewer suggestion.  I had no idea the ratio, so I just  added what I thought, which I now forgoet, doh!  I feel bad rating it though this way...but it was good.  The maple syrup lent a very sweet flavor, but I do think the curry should have shown through more than it did.  I have to find that curry paste.

A little on the sweet side for my taste, but my kids absolutely adored it; they practically licked their bowls clean.  I served over brown rice, and next time will include additional veggies (squash, celery, spinach, whatever).

Used curry powder, whole yellow pepper, real maple syrup (less sweet), sriracha for heat and added cashews & basmati rice...next time I might include cauliflower. Yummy!

This was good. It definitely had a lot of flavor, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it "Maple" curry chicken. The maple flavor is really lost and really just acts as a sweetner. Heavy cream could probably be substituted for coconut milk. It's not stated in the recipe, but if you use curry paste, I recommend using red curry paste. I think if the maple flavor could have been more prominent it would have really stood out as a unique curry. However, it really was just like any other curry.

this is the closest I've gotten to my favourite restaurant chicken peanut curry. like others, I used sour cream and cornstarch instead of cream cheese. also did curry powder/ketchup instead of the curry paste. husband loved it! he hates my last couple of curry attempts with other recipes.

Simple and delicious. Many have complimented me on this one and have asked for the recipe. I do like the fact that you can change up a few things (as per other reviews) and still come out with a superb taste. I keep it on my monthly or semi-monthly rotation

I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream and curry powder instead of curry paste.  I used real maple syrup.  I did not want to change the flavor with ketchup or anything with tomatoes.  Tomatoes would make it more like Chicken Tikka Masala.  My kids loved it.  My wife said it was good but very sweet.  I love the maple flavor and the cream cheese.  I will definitely make it again.

I have made this recipe twice now. The second time around I used half the syrup, half and half instead of cream, and added a half teaspoon cayenne pepper to make it a little more spicy. Either way it's delicious. Thanks to the original chef!

My whole family love this including my very fussy 3 year old.... I whispered that there is maple syrup in it and his face lit up. I like to add carrots, sweet potato and some spinach for some veg. and didn't wait to cook the ingredients just threw them all together!

really wonderful recipe. I have been looking for something like this for  awhile. I added 1 more tbls of the curry paste for more heat.
