This was excellent! I did make a couple of changes based on what I had. I made a different but similar cucumber recipe and ended up with leftover cucumber and decided to give this one a try. This one had a lot more flavor and was definitely the better of the two. I did not have lemongrass so I just gave the finished dish a squeeze of lemon juice. Not the same but it worked nicely too. The other recipe called for toasted sesame seeds so I tossed them in this one too for some extra texture. I really liked this recipe and used it with teriyaki chicken tacos but it could be used for so many different things.
