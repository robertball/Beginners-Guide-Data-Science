WOW!!! You can't go wrong with this one.  I cooked the bacon and used Major Grey's Mango Chutney, which I found in the ketchup/mustard aisle of my grocery store.  I noticed that you can also purchase Major Grey's online, but I have seen it at several grocery stores.  I fed 15 people and had 10 requests for the recipe.  That's a hit!!

I was looking for a recipe with Indian flavor and this fit the bill nicely.  I cooked my bacon myself but otherwise made it as written using the "hot" variety of mango chutney.  The chutney was in my local grocery store with the condiments near the cocktail sauce.  The flavor of this recipe is so good.  Everyone commented on it and several asked for a copy.  Will definitely make again.

I couldn't find mango chutney at the store, so I made my own. Mango jam, white vinegar, raisins, onion, garlic, spices - turned out great. 

The cheese ball was a hit. Men at our party were all over the dish. :)

AWESOME!  The flavors work SOOO well together.  Couldn't find Mango Chutney so I used Smuckers Mango Jam.  Didn't have plastic wrap, so I lined a small round bowl with a plastic storage bag and pressed it into shape.  I made the bottom flat so that it would sit nicely on a plate.  The cheese gets pretty firm once refrigerated, so I recommend putting a spreading knife out with the dip and crackers to make it easier on your guests, otherwise you will end up with a cheeseball full of broken cracker parts. YUMMY!

I live in a small town and couldn't find mango chutney.  So, I subsituted mango salsa (strained) mixed with apple jelly.  It was FABULOUS!  I also didn't add the golden raisins, personal taste.  It has already been requested for Christmas Day;-)

This is a wonderful cheeseball recipe!  Very addictive, people couldn't seem to get enough of it!  Sweet Chutney and Spicy Chutney both work!

I used the spicy chutney and mixed it right in the cream cheese to make more of a spread.  People absolutely *raved* over this.  I sprinkled toasted almonds over the top.

Excellent recipe - everyone loved it and asked for the recipe - Christmas Party favorite. Many different flavors, I thought the raisens would be too much but everyone truly enjoyed this cheese ball.

I have made this so many times now to rave reviews!  I always get asked for the recipe!  One time I was in a hurry and didn't want to make a mess with bacon and used the pre-cooked bacon bits.  It was still delicious!

Gotta be honest. This looks disgusting but tastes delicious. I used Major Grey's Mango Chutney and it isn't a visually appetizing spread. Just be prepared for it to not be a traditionally pretty cheese ball.

I followed the recipe exactly, but like others have said, the brand of mango chutney you use could make a big difference.  Mine was very chunky and too sweet.  I think my idea of a "bunch" of green onions was too much.  Next time I would use less onions and I would cook the bacon until it was crunchy.  I had used pre-cooked bacon, and it just didn't give the ball enough flavor.  I felt this needed something a bit tangier, so maybe craisins instead of raisins, or lime juice mixed with the chutney?  I'm just not sure.

Wow - this recipe is so tasty and fun as an appetizer and was not hard at all to prepare.  It's definitely a new take on a classic cheeseball.  Its flavor probably depends in large part on how good the mango chutney you use is, so choose (or prepare) wisely!

Wow! Delicious! And a beautiful presentation too! I made this for an Indian dinner night with friends, and it sure was a winner. Its unique fruity flavor would make it a nice appetizer during the Christmas season as well. I used two 8-ounce packages of cream cheese, one bunch of green onions, the 2.1 oz. pkg. of pre-cooked bacon, and an extra 1/4 cup of golden raisins. For the crackers, I used plain pita chips. Serve this before your next dinner party, and your guests will rave!

I took this recipe to a cottage weekend with friends. I thought that the mango chutney was way to overpowering(too heavy on the ginger)for this excellent cheese ball. The second night I served it, I put raspberry preserves on one side and honey with pomegranite seeds on the other side to dip in after taking a section of the ball. It was a huge success. Thank you.

I ordinarily don't go for the cheese balls, preferring to use my calorie allotment elsewhere, but this version was especially delicious. I did make a few changes for my own palate. I used a whole pound of bacon (so much for the calories!!), cooking it until it was very crispy and then breaking it into small bits.  After mixing the cream cheese, 1/2 of the cooked bacon, raisins, green onions, and sour cream, I heated the mixture in the microwave until it was a creamy stirring consistency (approx 1 - 1 1/2 minutes).  I stirred the mixture well, put in into a covered bowl, and refrigerated it overnight.  This seemed to distribute the flavor of the onions and bacon throughout the cheese.  Shortly before serving , I removed the mixture from the refrigerator, reheated it slightly so I could stir it again, arranged it on a small plate, and sprinkled more bacon bits and thinly sliced green onion on the top along with a few chopped peanuts.  I served it with pita chips and the mango chutney on the side.  Mmmmm...

This cheese ball is phenomenal! I've made it twice already and it was a huge hit each time. Many people requested the recipe. It's very quick and easy to make. Just follow the recipe and it will come out fantastic but be sure to let it sit in the fridge overnight so the flavors meld. I used Major Grey's Mango Chutney which I found in Publix.

This cheese ball is my new favorite!  I followed the recipe to a "T" except instead of the chutney, I diced two ripe mangoes and tossed with a TBS or so of melted red jalepeno jelly.  I placed the cheese ball on a footed pedestal and pressed it down so it was shaped more like a disk instead of a ball, and placed the chopped mango mixture on top. I have taken this to several functions and no kidding, not a crumb left. (I now double the recipe)  I do want to say to some of the others that working with curry you must let the flavors develop, so patience, trust the recipe, refrigerate overnite and enjoy. Thanks PHROGGI for an outstanding recipe.

I bought a fancy jar of mango chutney, and it was not at all pretty. It made my cheese ball look nightmarish! Besides looking scary, the taste was not something everyone appreciated at the girls night out get together that I took this to. In fact, many didn't even taste it! I did like this and think it could have been really wonderful with different chutney.

I have made this and it is fantastic!  I used 1/2 cup each of bacon, green oinions and raisins along with a 1/2 cup of chopped peanuts. You will not have leftovers! I used light cream cheese and light sour cream.

Great! I only wanted to deal with one 8oz package of cream cheese, so I just adjusted the other ingredients to work with it. I made the cheese ball itself exactly as directed, and added some fresh mango and golden raisins to Major Grey's for the top. Excellent. Thanks for the recipe!

I feel like the bacon taste was barely there. I added the whole rest of the package and it didn't seem to make much of a difference. I didn't have the budget for mango chutney, so I chopped and mashed some mango and piled it on top like the main picture and it looked just great!

All my dinner guests just RAVED over this, which perplexed me simply because it was SO easy to make! 
Normally when using a new recipe, I follow it to the T - why rate something I have modified, right? But I went to FOUR grocery stores and a produce stand and could not find mango chutney. SO I used the cheese ball stand-by, red pepper jelly. The whole mixture was great. Sweetness from the raisins mixed well with the green onions and other ingredients. Thank you!

I really like this. I used 6 sliced of center cut bacon and would use more the next time. Don't be afraid to up the rest of the ingredients because the cream cheese is such a strong flavor.  Made my own mango chutney and served it on the side for those who were skeptical.  Everyone who tried it thought it was great.

A definite hit.  I made it the day before w/o pouring on the chutney.  Stored it in the fridge wrapped in plastic wrap until the day of the party.  Took it out the morning of the party to soften and the poured the chutney on just before the guests arrived.  Went over very well.  Leftovers are great!  Don't be scared of it, I know the ingredients sounds kind of odd, but all together they're a great flavor combination.

This has such unique flavor from the mango chutney.  The sweet and salty combo was very popular at our Post Thanksgiving party.

I’ve made this a couple times. The first time I learned a lot of people don’t care for the taste of chutney. So now I make it like a two part dip. One side the cheese ball and cheese knife and the other side the chutney and a small spoon so people who don’t like the chutney can still have the cheese part. I also increase the bacon just a bit. Overall people find it different but enjoy it.

Well liked by family! I made with cranberries instead of golden raisins. I added real bacon bits instead of cooking my own.

I followed the recipe, except could not find mango chutney at my grocery store, so substituted fig preserves.  Guests raved over it.  I think you could top it with many different things and it would still be delicious.

I used Patak's sweet mango chutney from Mariano's grocery store. I'm allergic to onions but I just omitted them and no one knew the difference; probably because the chutney is very nicely spiced. I got so many compliments and requests for this recipe at the church potluck!

I made changes, but I can't help it!  We beat together 8 oz. cream cheese, 8 oz. shredded cheddar and 9 oz. mango chutney, formed it into a ball and let it chill overnight.  I cooked and cooled a pound of bacon and chopped it with a bunch of green onions in the food processor, then rolled the ball in the bacon/onion mix to cover and served with crackers.  We dislike golden raisins, so left them out.  SOOOO GOOD!  Got rave reviews!

This is a real crowd pleaser! I served this for the "meat and potatoes" crowd and even though they were not keen on the chutney, I could not keep them away from 2nds, 3rds, 4ths. Worth a try!

The ingredients for this recipe seemed odd, but good.  I recently served this at a holiday cocktail party and it was a hit!  It was the first cheese ball I have ever made.  I served it with pretzels and crackers.  It was delicious and still yummy the next day.  I served it with chicken satay skewers, also from this site.

Fabulous. Made it for my aunt's wedding. Easy to make and everyone loved it, even my husband who is normally "grossed out" by cheese balls. Requested I make it for Thanksgiving. I'm thinking this would be extra yummy rolled in chopped pecans...
