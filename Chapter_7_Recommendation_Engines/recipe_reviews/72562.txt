I love mangoes & I love martinis & I really thought that I would love this drink but the mango nectar was kinda funky tasting. Not really bad...just weird. I had never had it before so I didn't know what to expect. I think JDVMD was dead on when she suggested adding pineapple juice. I'm going to use the rest of mango nectar in a Mangorita & see if the additional ingredients don't help tone down the mango nectar some. Thanks for letting me try this one though!

Pretty good drink. Didn't like it in the martini glass though. Next time, I will add some pineapple juice to make it a little more dimensional.
