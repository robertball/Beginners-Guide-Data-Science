Made this for a work potluck and it got rave reviews. The prep was easy and took about 1:30 to make including bake time. Mushroom slicing took the longest. I like a mix of darker mushrooms so I used crimini and shitake. Make sure to boil off all the mushroom liquid which will probably take longer than 5 minutes. I used extra mozz. on top. Very satisfying Fall flavored dish!

The taste was amazing but the pasta was raw. The few times I have made lasagna in the past the noodles were precooked. I watched the video to to confirm and they used raw as well. I will try this again but partially cook the noodles first. Otherwise the dish was perfect.

My dish did not look exactly like the photo but it was so delicious who cares! The only change I made was not to add the paramesan cheese to the top before cooking. I felt like I was eatting a seasonal dish at a fancy French restaurant!
