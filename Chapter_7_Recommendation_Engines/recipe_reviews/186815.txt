I give it a 4 for flavor but there are a couple of changes I suggest. First, cut the bread crumbs in HALF, there was more than enough to do a dozen chicken thighs. Second, cook these on a shallow rack in a baking dish, otherwise the bottom half of the chicken pieces get soggy.

Nothing fancy but good and moist.  You definitely only need about half of the bread crumbs.

This chicken was delecious and juicy. I had chicken tenderloins thawed out so I used that in place of the chicken thighs, but I think next time I will try it with the thighs just to see what that taste like! I liked that the egg and ranch were mixed together. I only use panko bread crumbs because it gives more of a crispy coating.

This is one of my boys' favorites. This works for chicken tenders as well (or chicken legs, if you'd rather use that). I use my own homemade dry ranch seasoning mix and I add Frank's hot sauce to the egg wash. Never fails to disappear.

So super easy and delicious! I ran out of my usual bread crumbs so I crushed some Ceasar croutons. The egg and ranch dressing mix was wonderful. Even my 23 month old ate it without a fight! My husband said, "Mmmm mmmm mmm! This one's a keeper!"

Maybe I did something wrong, but this did not turn out well at all.  The flavors didn't seem to meld well and the breadcrumbs overpowered the chicken.  I only ate 3 bites and gave up on it.  Joe ate one thigh, and said it was "OK, but not a 'make again'"

It is tender but other than that, it is plain old breaded chicken.  Aside from the little extra garlic flavor, nothing stood out.

We made this tonight and both my daughers took one bit and said "YUM". This was so simple and SOOO tender. I made the recipe exactly liked it was stated. I did put it on a rack on the pan so the juices would not make it soggy. It came out perfect and is something I would serve to guests. I might cut back a bit on the garlic power by 1 tsp.

Such an easy recipe for basic oven fried chicken.  Came out very crispy except on the bottom (which I guess is because thighs are pretty greasy).  I used panko.  One change - I used chipotle ranch dressing for a bit more flavor.  The whole family ate it all up.  Will definitely use this one again.

This was simple and super easy. It didn't say whether they meant the prepared Ranch dressing in the bottle or the dry mix so I used the dressing in the bottle. I used some plain panko bread crumbs that were unseasoned and since my bonless skinless chicken breasts were huge I butterflied them and then flattened them with a mallet and then my cooking time was only 30 minutes for this dish. I ran out of breading and had to make more for the last couple of pieces. I had just barely enough egg/ranch mix left for the last piece so the next time I fix this I will adjust and make more of both. I couldn't taste the ranch dressing and this really turned out well. My husband liked this. It isn't going to replace good old fashioned fried chicken, but it was good and I'll fix this again.

Simple yet delicious. My husband raved about it- I will definitely make again.  Next time I will only bake for 40 minutes- the chicken was a tad overdone.

Makes good moist but crunchy chicken. I followed the recipe but did add about a tablespoon of dry ranch dressing to the breadcrumbs since I had a packet of dry mix which was about to expire. Like another reviewer suggested I did bake these on a rack to make them crunchy.
I'll use the leftovers for a chicken sandwich for lunch.

This was a big hit with the adults and kids around our table. Neither my husband or I could taste the ranch dressing, but maybe it helped anyway, because the chicken was incredibly tender. 

The meat was finished about ten minutes before I was ready to serve it, so I put it back in the oven with the heat turned off. This may have caused it to get slightly overcooked (it was still hot in there), but the chicken didn't lose its tenderness or great taste. This recipe is definitely worth making again. Next time I'll cut the bread crumbs, as other reviewers suggested - I couldn't fit an entire 2 cups in the shallow bowl I was using so I had maybe 1 1/2, but I still had a lot left over after dredging 9 chicken thighs in it.

This was a very easy and delicious recipe. For an added shortcut I used Shake n Bake Ranch for the breading. A must try.

I had to rate it 5 stars but I didn't have ranch dressing which I'm sure would have been excellent. I did add some spices to try to replace what the ranch dressing would have given to the recipe. The chicken was very tender and juicy. We liked them quite a bit but will definitely buy some ranch and make it again.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. I used seasoning that we like on the chicken and in the bread crumbs. Spraying the chicken with crisco before it was baked helped make it a little more crispy.

Easy and tasty. I made 11 thighs because that's what I had on hand. I used the same amount of breadcrumbs as this six-piece recipe and it was plenty. I used worcestershire sauce because again, that's what I had, and it was great! Also substituted garlic power for garlic salt (but probably healthier sticking to the recipe.) All in all it's a nice n' easy recipe I'll be sure to use again.

I'll make it, but with changes:  1/2 the breadcrumbs. Line the baking sheet with foil. Decrease cooking time to 40 mins. at 350 degrees. Eliminate the ranch dressing (I couldn't taste it at all!)

Great Concept..de-boning chicken thighs took WAYYYY too long.  If you can buy boneless chicken thighs..who knew, Not Me!

I would have preferred a lot more flavor.  I toasted bread, ran out towards the end and finished by crushing croutons.

Cooked it on one of those pans with the slots so that the grease could drain vs. baking sheet.  I also prefer to cook low and slow so I baked at 350.  I WILL MAKE AGAIN, but this first go round did not impress the 5 yr old, newly picky eater.  I'd searched 'kid friendly recipes' which is why I made this. :-(

This reminded me of shake and bake I use to make years ago. It was a quick and easy main course. Served fried corn and mashed potatoes as my sides. I did as previous reviewers and cut the bread crumbs I should have also cut the egg wash mix.

So I'm going through my recipes saved and saw this. I made it before and we all loved it! Guess it kinda fell off the radar but not sure why I let it! Should definitely and will definitely be adding this into our meal plans much more often. It was def one of the better breaded chicken recipes on here!

4.5 stars.  I put the chicken on a baking rack as other's suggested to avoid soggy chicken on the bottom.  It was crispy all of the way around.  Used spicy ranch dressing as that was all I had on hand.  This dressing added even more spices/flavor.  The chicken was truly tender/juicy.

Unfortunately I really don't like white meat chicken but I'm still looking for a healthier eating plan.  I was happy to find this recipe for baked chicken thighs.  I didn't have spices to exactly match the recipe so I made do, but all other instructions were followed exactly. 

The only thing I might try next time would be to bake on a rack over a baking sheet so that the bottoms would crisp as well.  

Very tasty.  Thanks!

I made this exactly as the recipe read, except, I am a sucker for crispy chicken skin so left it on. It came out very nice. Tasty for sure, but just a tad dry to me. My wife raved over it.  Leftovers were made into super sandwiches with some of the cranberry/apple chutney from turkey day.  This probably would have been a five star chicken dish, but I use my Grandma Sheasley's chicken as a benchmark. Worth adding to your save list.

I usually use chicken thighs in the slow cooker, so I wanted to search for an oven recipe I could cook faster on a weeknight. I used a ranch "dip" I made from a seasoning packet, and based on reviews, about half the bread crumbs. I think I would have been better off using all of them, as I wasn't able to fully cover 6 thighs. However, it was still delicious. Mine seemed to be full of ranch flavor, likely due to the thicker consistency, so I would suggest people who want more ranch taste use the powder mix. The chicken was moist and delicious. We will definitely make this again and again!

My 9-year-old absolutely loved this recipe, in fact, asked that it be the only kind of chicken that I make from now on. For my own personal preference I used chicken breasts instead of thighs. It was very simple to prepare and well-received.   Personally I found it to be very tender and juicy. I've tried other breaded chicken recipes without the same results. The one is a keeper.

This was great easy and the chicken was juicy. I used Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs and Garlic Salt instead of powder and I used Ranch Dressing from the bottle with my egg batter. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe Isaac! :-)

Way too much dry mix for that amount of chicken.  I just made the recipe with 1.5kg of chicken thighs - I had to add an extra egg and an extra tablespoon of ranch dressing, but there was still a lot of breadcrumb/spice mixture left over.

Made this for Friday night dinner. Followed recipe except added a dash of Taxation to egg mixture and used two pouches of original shake n bake. Cooked for about 55 minutes. Came out good, everyone liked it and ate it but to me it could actually use more flavor so I'm going to try some other baked chicken recipes on here.

The chicken was very tender. I followed the recipe with these exceptions: used less bread crumbs as others stated (1/2 of what recipe calls for) and I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I was pleased with the taste. Will make again; my family enjoyed!

what a great simple chicken recipe!

i did follow some of the other suggestions like using panko, but when i baked the chicken, i baked it on a broiler pan to ensure the chicken got crispy on all sides. will be making this again!

Halfed the breadcrumbs, kept everything else the same. Was able to cover 12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Tender meat. Good but for us we will need to add a bit more "pizazz"

This was waaay better than I thought it would be  The only change I made was to sprinkle dry ranch dressing mix and garlic salt in with the eggs.  The thighs were rather small so took only 45 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe.

I am giving 5 stars even though I made changes. I forgot the paprika and I like paprika on chicken so I'm sure it would have been tastier with it. I also used what I had on hand. The thighs (4) were bone-in with skin. I removed the skin and rubbed s&p and garlic onto the thighs. I omitted the egg. I poured about 1 1/2 T spicy ranch dressing in a small bowl and stirred in a crushed chipotle. Guesstimated an amount of seasoned Panko with some extra seasoning added that I put on a paper plate. I brushed the dressing on the thighs one at a time, plopped onto the Panko, flipped over, brushed and flipped again. After they were all on the pan I sprayed them with a light coat of olive oil. I baked at 350 for 50 minutes. I used 350 because I also had a squash casserole to bake.
