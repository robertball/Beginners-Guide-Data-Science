This is a very good soup on a fall/winter day. Instead of using a blender, I just used my "old fashioned" potato masher right in the pot. It was easy to regulate how many chunked potatoes you want left in the soup. I topped mine with cheese, bacon and scallions.

If the soup seems too thin, just add a little bit of instant mashed potatoes to thicken.
A keeper recipe

WOW!!!! This was so UNBELIEVABLY good!!!!!!!!!! A HUGE hit with my entire family, who normally does not even comment on what they are served. Rave reviews from my husband and kids! Will definitely make again. Omitted the parsley (didn't have any) and used chicken boullion with water in place of the stock. It was quite exceptional!!!

This soup was wonderful -- I substituted 1 c. cream for 1 c. of the milk, and also added wild rice and buillion that had boiled separately for 40 minutes or so. When I blended 1/2 of the soup, this blended wild rice added some nice color, as well. Very yummy, very simple. I will try this as a base for clam chowder.

This was an easy soup to make from what I already had on hand. I used fat free milk, as that's all we keep around. My picky family (husband, 6 and 4-year olds) LOVED it. Thanks much!

Great soup! I used vegetarian boullion since we have an herbivore in the house, but cooked up some bacon for the meat-eaters to sprinkle in. I started by just mashing the potatoes as several other reviewers did, but the soup seemed really thin when I was done.  So almost all of it went in to the blender, which thickened it up beautifully.

Excellent potato soup base.  I added about 3 oz of cream cheese.  I also topped with bacon, cheese, and the fresh parsley.  Everyone gulped it up and asked for seconds.  I had a bunch left over the next day for lunch as well.  

Thanks!

My husband and I enjoyed this very much and will be making it regularly in the winter.  I made a few changes, though.  I didn't use a food processor for the potatoes; just mashed them some with a fork.  We liked the consistency better.  Also I didn't have fresh garlic, so I used garlic powder.  Used Swanson low sodium chicken broth.

I really enjoyed this soup! I used dried unions, and fat-free milk, and topped it with an aged cheddar and a chopped tomato-- delicious! I'll certainly be making it again!

This is the best potato soup recipe!  I only made one small change; I added one chopped shallot to the onion & garlic.  The soup was so rich and flavorful, and it had the perfect consistency.  I'm already looking forward to making this again!

Very good as is but for our tastes I added 3 ounces of Cream Cheese with chives which made a thick texture so no mashing or blending was needed~ a couple chicken boullen cubes and a few spinkles of cayenne and a packet of precooked bacon bits! Yummmmmmm!

Thyme is one of my favorite herb seasonings - so I used both dried and fresh in this soup and wasn't disappointed.  I added carrot for additional color and found that using a potato masher gave me the texture that I liked.. I followed the suggestion of the recipe poster and served with shredded cheese.  So good on a cool, rainy evening.

This turned out a really wonderful tasting low calorie soup! We sprinkled  grated american cheese and chives insead of parsley over... this is a great low cal recipe. I used 2% milk, the results were wonderful. I didn't even miss the bacon or sour cream. Served with a loaf of hot crusty french bread...Mmmmm.

Even though my husband gave it a four, I'm giving it a five, because I liked the addition of thyme, and I thought the flavors of chicken broth, potatoes, & herbs went very well together. I added a sweet potato and really liked the added depth and density. I also added 1/4 teaspoon fresh rosemary and about a teaspoon of onion powder. Very good recipe!

Great comfort food and perfect for the cold, wet weather we've been having.  I cooked a few strips of bacon to add to the soup and used the drippings to sauté the onion in.  Overall, and easy and delicious dinner.

This was a really good soup. The only thing I didn't like was that it didn't have much flavor - that was my fault. My chicken stock was not very salty, because I don't add bouillon or other salts to it - I didn't salt the soup much, but it would certainly have benefitted from some sour cream, chives or other such flavoring that doesn't add a ton of salt.

This is an excellent recipe.  I also added some onion powder, garlic salt (in place of any other salt) and some seasoned salt and a couple dashes of cayenne.  I added a couple strips of chopped up bacon for the meat eater in the family and topped it with grated cheddar cheese, green onions and parsley.  I also thickened it with some mashed potato flakes.  It was really good!

Really good soup! I used sweet potatoes and white potatoes--only putting the white ones in the food processor and then just stirred in the already cooked sweet potatoes.  It came out a bit thick..but I would definetly make this again!

Very, very good as written. I thought it had plenty of subtle flavoring - nothing overwhelming. Then we added a large chunk of Velveeta Queso and WHAM! Amazing!!!! (I did mashed it down a little in the pan as other users suggested to avoid having to clean the blender:) It was quick and easy, thank you for posting!

This was delicious!  I added cooked cubed chicken and crumbled bacon to make it a meal.  Also froze perfectly for leftovers.

Great recipe - definitely a keeper.  I added carrots and celery and 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2, but otherwise made it as is.  Mashed the potatoes instead of pureed them because it involved less cleanup.
Very tasty and easy.

We had this for dinner tonight and my husband and son just loved it.  I thought that it could use more flavour and put some crumpled bacon and shredded cheddar cheese on the table to accompany it.  The flavour was somewhat similar to a loaded baked potato.  I think that this is a great recipe for winter when you feel like comfort food.

My boyfriend loved this soup, and for how easy it is to make you can't really beat it.  I do think however, that it was missing just a little something... but will try again!  Thanks

It was a hit with the family. My husband and two teenager boys loved it. I made it exactly like the recipe. Will definitely make again.
