I threw in one large diced carrot with the rest of the ingredients (to add to what would be on the platter for a buffalo wings AND to make it stretch just a little further for more "filled out" sandwiches) and I used my own homemade lowfat ranch dressing. GREAT balance of ingredients. The boys made quick work of this sandwich stuffer--they LOVED it. My husband asked me why I hadn't made it before and please could I make it more often........and why aren't there leftovers? ;)

My husband and I LOVE chicken wings so I knew this had our names written all over it! Plus it was quick and easy to put together for lunch - not to mention a bit healthier than fried chicken wings! I used Kraft Reduced fat light dressing and of course Frank's Red Hot which is a staple in our house. I cut back on the celery a bit but it did give the chicken salad a nice crunch. I let it chill for about an hour before serving to let the flavors blend together. I made these into wrap sandwiches - perfect with crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes and of course some crumbled bleu cheese! Thanks for a great recipe Nikki!

Very good for a quick and easy meal when you don't have time to cook a huge dinner. The only thing I changed was I used 1/2 cup of Frank's Buffalo Hot.  I love mine spicy!

ok this recipe is good but what bothers me is the name I am from Buffalo and we would NEVER use ranch its blue cheese dressing all the way here with this types of recipe or anything chicken wing related yeah we actually just say chicken wing in Buffalo and not Buffalo wings like everywhere else which seems silly to us so I don't like my city name associated with something thats not even made the way we would make it but I agree about the franks hot sauce thats the best and what most people in Buffalo use.So if you're gonna make a true "Buffalo chicken salad" use bleu cheese

Very tasty! I did add about 1/2 cup of cream cheese just to thicken it up a bit and that really helped. I also threw some buffalo sauce in with the chicken while it was cooking to give it a little extra kick.

Excellent flavor, but WAY too much ranch! A 50-50 ratio of ranch to hot sauce works better otherwise all you taste is ranch.

We loved this I did make one change, instead of using the onions (which daughter won't eat) I added Feta Cheese.  About 1/4-1/2 cup.  Delish!!

Delicious.  I used more onion and some asiago peppercorn dressing rather than ranch and the result was pleasing.

Used 2c. of leftover rotisserie chicken, 1/2 c. ranch and 1/2 c. Franks RedHot Buffalo Sauce. I didn't have green onion so I used white onion. YUMMY! Will definitely make again. Served with Romaine Lettuce. Blue Cheese crumbles on top would make it worth 5 stars!

Delicious!  I used leftover fried chicken(all I had at the time) that I ground up in a food chopper and added a little fresh Rosemary, equal amounts of Frank's wing sauce and Ranch dressing, 2 boiled eggs, and some dill relish and sweet relish. I needed to stretch mine out.  I made the recipe as called for the first time I made it and loved it.  Just added a twist this time. It was great both ways!

Love this recipe!! Using some of the tips, 1/4 cup of ranch, buffalo sauce, chopped carrots & bit of bleu cheese crumbles and trading chunks of chicken for canned chicken, it was fantastic!! Make it weekly  thanks to all!

Great basic recipe. I added more hot sauce (Frank's of course!) but followed the recipe other than using garlic salt instead of regular salt. My favorite wing flavor is spicy garlic :o) DH loved this one, I added real bleu cheese crumbles to his sandwich. Yum!

Such an easy recipe the whole family loves! I pop chicken breasts under the broiler for 15 mins each side (depending on size) and then let cool. I use a an “Ulu” a type of chopper to quickly cube the chicken after it cools.  Minor chopping for the celery and scallions (good with shredded carrot as well!) - throw it all together and yum!! I eat mine on gluten free rolls and the sauce moistens the rolls up really well. Highly recommeded!!

This is now my go to recipe for buffalo chicken salad. The only change I made was the quantities, as it was only for me. I will definitely make this for my next book club. Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe.

What a fantastic idea. I love love hot wings so I was drawn to this recipe. I added one hard boiled egg (to make it more of a traditional chicken salad) and some finely chopped carrots for a little more crunch. I also added a little shredded cheddar. Kinda reminded me of crack dip :) it was very yummy will make it again. Thank you!y Oh and let it sit to let all the flavors merry!

We really liked this.  I did not add the onions to this because my husband doesn't like onions.  I think I might do as another suggested and add a little diced carrot next time.  We ate this as a sandwich but I think it would be great over some Romain lettuce too.

I used my leftover chicken for this super quick buffalo chicken salad. I whipped it up with some chopped salad and green onions and VOILA, instant chicken salad! This reminded me of buffalo wings with a side of ranch and celery. YUM!

I think the people mentioning blue cheese dressing as opposed to ranch were on track. The flavors in this just didn't meld.
