This recipe is fabulous!  Had a hard time finding frozed stuffed shells, substituted ricotta stuffed ravioli.  Had company over for dinner and it disappeared.  Definitely a keeper.

You could use frozen cheese raviolis instead of shells, or frozen Italian meatballs instead of sausage.  You can find a shredded 5-cheese blend of Italian cheese.  That is much easier and cost efficient than the provolone.

I found it to be very bland, despite the changes I made to it.  What it was definitely lacking in was pepper and garlic.

This turned out great, even my picky child loved it. I could not find shredded provolone cheese at the store, and being too lazy to shred myself, used an Italian mixed cheese blend instead,  which took a little longer to melt, but tasted fine.
The sauce was easy and tasty.
I will probably be cooking this one frequently.

Everyone really liked this.  I couldn't find stuffed shells, so I bought ricotta-asparagus cannelloni.  I also used fresh mushrooms (way more than the tin suggested).  I think this has a lot of potential to be customized by adding chopped bell peppers, different cheeses, or even turkey meatballs depending on what you feel like.

I changed several things, but the concept of Jumbo Shells stuffed with meatballs is wonderful!

I couldn't find frozen pasta so I just used some from the dairy case (where you buy ricotta cheese from).  Still worked great.  Makes a TON of food... don't forget to cover it with foil, I forgot so top was a cheese crust and it'll be better next time.
