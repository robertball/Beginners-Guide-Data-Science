I used a medium sized organic red potato (I did dice it before cooking, just to make it a little easier), a sweet onion, two free range egg whites/two full eggs, Romanita tomatoes and 2% sharp cheddar cheese. My kids didn't care for it but I reallu thought it was great. I had a little homemade salsa over the top and it was quite filling. YUM! NOTE: I did use just a touch of butter to "oil" my pan, but you can use non stick low-cal spray or EVOO, if you'd rather. Shoot, bacon grease would be good, too!

Great for an easy breakfast!  I had a leftover grilled potato that I wanted to use up and instead of the spinach I added some green pepper - very tasty.

A very good idea that fit with the random food items I had lying about the apartment. A way to give it slightly more flavor is, instead of boiling the potato, dice into very small pieces and brown along with the onions and a bit of salt before adding the garlic. I suppose it changes the texture slightly, but the browning on the potato and slight caramelization of the onion adds a lot.

It was awesome. Although I didn't have any potatoes so I used sweet potatoes instead. I also didn't have any spinach. I didn't use hot sauce and cayenne pepper because it would have been to spicy. I am 9 and this was a pretty hard recipe, but then again I don't have a lot of experience.

Salmon and eggs for Hubs this morning, but this for me!  I left out the potato, cooked up some diced bacon, then continued with the recipe, leaving out the cayenne. LOVED it - the combination of ingredients and flavors (garlic is great in this!) were right up my alley.  Being colorful and super-nutritious doesn't hurt either. I think the bacon, however, had a lot to do with the success of this for me!

I needed a quick and easy dinner for my daughter and this fitted the bill. I used red onion and added some red pepper which I sauteed with the onion and garlic. I put it in a warm tortilla and she loved it. I tasted a bit of it and thought it was good too. Thanks.

Really good. I would probably boil the potato for a bit longer next time I make it. The center pieces were a bit too firm for my tastes, but overall a great, easy recipe.

Had an overflow of bordeaux spinach in the garden and thought this recipe would be great to try. Very good & healthy. Only change made to recipe is chopping up potato & saut√©ing with onion before adding garlic.

YUMMY! I made enough veggies to refrigerate half so i could make this again later in the week. Quick and easy meal for a hungry vegetarian.  I used red onion and red-skinned potatoes(with skins on) to make it a little healthier. But I skipped out on the hot spices. Still turned out great esp with the saltiness from the fresh cheddar. 
I can't wait to make this again!

Didn't have any spinach so added some broccoli, califlower and green pepper, also some cummun seed and fresh licorice basil.  very yummy not 4 servings though more like two.  Cooked it in my cast iron skillet.  Didn't boil potatoes just diced them up.

Fantastic recipe - easy to make and tastes great. Like others I also added some bacon pieces which tasted good. I tripled the amount of spinach which went well, but as I like more greens, will be adding even more next time. Will definitely be making this again!

I have made a similar recipe (my own) many times.  Depending on what I have available, I use any and/or all the listed ingredients, and sometimes add sliced ripe olives, mushrooms, chopped bell pepper (any color).  I refer to it as a Garbaqe Fritatta.

Yummy!  I browned the potatoes in the pan with the onion and left out the cayenne and hot sauce.  I garnished the egg scramble with fresh chopped green onions (left them in larger chunks for some crunch).

This is really good and really healthy. I added some chopped yellow pepper because it was either add it to this or throw it away! I browned my potoatoes a little before adding the spinach and added my tomato in last - I hate mushy warm tomatoes in my eggs. I forgot to top this with cheese, but it was still good without.

Well, considering I had no cheese, no cayenne pepper, and no hot sauce, this turned out exceptionally well! I added some curry out of shame for the lack of ingredients and was surprised to find that it blended deliciously with the egg and spinach flavors.  Very good!

Very tasty recipe!  I diced two smaller organic red skin potatoes (with skins on) and sauteed them first in a little butter until browned and soft. I then added the onions, followed by some grated, fresh garlic.  I substituted some fresh, chopped swiss chard because that's what I had on hand.  A few dashes of cayenne pepper and a dash of hot sauce gave this dish a nice flavor without being too spicy.  I had some organic, raw cheddar cheese to top this off with, which was really the "icing on the cake".  

Can't wait to make this again!!

This made a great lunch for me today Noelle! I'm not a potato person so I left them out. I used egg beaters and bruschetta in lieu of the tomatoes. I then wrapped the eggs in a warmed tortilla. Yum!

Instead of cheddar, I make this with spicy pepper jack. Otherwise it would be a bit bland for me.

Delightful! Left out the potato, used red onion to add some extra colour, and used kale from my garden instead of spinach.
