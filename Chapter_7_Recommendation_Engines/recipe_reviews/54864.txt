This was a really neat dish. I really enjoyed it, and so did my husband who is a bit nervous about polenta (especially in the tube :) I did make some variations and changes. I added half a chopped red pepper and red onion for color. I used two zuchinni because I didn't have eggplant. I also used taco mix because I didn't have fajita. I didn't use the whole packet (to cut down on sodium). I also didn't put the salsa or olives on the casserole. I think the salsa could make it a bit watery, so I decided not to. Also, I sprinkled oregano, pepper and garlic powder over the polento circles before adding the bean mixture. I also think that you could cut down on the amount of beans (personal preference) as it seemed to overwhelm the vegetable mixture at times. I used 1 can of kidney beans and half a can each of garbonzo and cannellini beans.I also used a fiesta blend of cheese isntead of the mozzarella.  I served the casserole with salsa, olives and sour cream. The flavor was great. Will make again! Thanks Karen. :)

I haven't made this as a casserole yet, but threw black beans, polenta, corn, and a cooked salsa in a pan with some cheddar and garlic for a tasty meal.  I'll definitely be making this as a casserole, but will use a can of green chiles and can of drained diced tomatoes instead of the salsa.  It would also be good with crumbled burger or seasoned tofu to add some extra protein.  Easy, quick and yummy!

This was pretty good - not the best recipe ever, but made a good, hearty meal. I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh and only half of the fajita seasoning-which was very salty. Also, I left out the salsa because I dislike the flavor of bottled salsa in cooked recipes - overpowers the vegetables.  Would be good with salsa and sour cream on the side!

Certainly a keeper...I made this with very few changes. I omitted the kidney beans (did not have any); only used 3/4 pack of fajita seasoning and served the salsa on the side w/sour cream & guacamole. It could use something to hold the beans/corn together (serve with caution..LOL)...but NO ONE slowed down on eating it. Very tasty....try with Mexican Rice II, Sweet Corn Tomalito, Best Guacamole & of course some Margaritas! :) ENJOY!

This was delicious! I made my own seasoning mix instead of fajita seasoning.  Also used yellow squash instead of eggplant since it's what I had. Nice and healthy, I will definitely make this again!

This was too layered - there was nothing to really hold it all together.  I think it would be better with the beans, corn and salsa mixed with the sauteed veggies before topping the polenta.

Good easy recipe. Like other reviewers, I kept the salsa out to keep the dish from being too watery and served it on the side.  I added green chile peppers as well. Filling and nice flavor.

This was very tasty. I did make a few alterations but stuck to the spirit of the recipe.I left out the beans and instead added some roasted zucchini. I also roasted the eggplant. I also left off the salsa and used a very light dusting of a cheese blend. It was quite good, very healthy and reheats very well.

very good dinner, and enough to feed a large family for 2 full meals! i was very impressed with the combo of the eggplant, onion, mushrooms and seasoning, and would definitely use that part in other recipes. i did also cut back to 1/2 packet, and used taco seasoning instead. 5 stars!!

This dish single-handedly converted my mother out of the ideology that meat makes the meal.  It's a completely filling, satisfying, great-tasting main dish for vegetarians and omnivores alike; a good choice for large dinners.

doesnt hold well, but is excellent in tortillas.  i made it more mexican inspired with more peppers and pinto instead of kidney beans, and used taco/enchilada sauce instead of salsa.  cheap and easy.

This was a delicious and healthy dinner.  My 3 year old and 5 year old ate all of their serving.  I served it with some flax chips I get at Costco and some mandarin oranges.  Easy and great.  Was able to freeze some for another night.  I hope it freezes well.

I loved this casserole, It's totally healthy and my kids loved it.  Used all fresh vegetables from my farmer's market, even the corn.  Shredded fresh mozzarella was a nice topping.  Really a refreshing change for dinner.

I liked this recipe, however I think next time I will fry the slices of polenta or bake the polenta by itself before adding the other ingredients because I didn't like the consistency on the bottom of the casserole.  I liked the other ingredients but I ended up with a mushy flavorless layer at the bottom.  Next time, I might also add some extra spices to the polenta.

Along with others, I also used half packet of seasoning. Since we like polenta, we may add more next time, putting another layer in the middle. Thanks for sharing!

This was OK.  My son wouldn't eat it.  I probably should have baked the polenta a bit first because it was pretty soggy.  I used zucchini instead of eggplant.  Really enjoyed the olives on top.  Overall not something I'd make again though.

I had never used polenta before and was looking for a recipe.  After reading reviews I mastered it without it being soggy, like others complained about.  I first fried the polenta. Then fried the onion, eggplant and mushrooms. I drained the canned items well (I didn't have kidney beans so I used chili beans) but I also added fresh spinach before putting the cheese on. I just spooned some corn and bean salsa on top so there wasn't too much.  It was most excellent.  My healthy eating son loved it and so did my picky husband.  I was told I could make this again!

This was my very first time preparing or eating polenta.  I used a premade polenta tube and substituted zucchini for the eggplant.

Everything was good, except I get the feeling I was supposed to perhaps squeeze the polenta first of excess moisture.  This casserole was super-wet on the bottom even after cooking @ 365 degrees and adding 5 min. bake time.

This was my first time making anything with polenta and it seemed really simple so I went for it.
Along with a few other reviewers, I left out the salsa, and also the onions just because I'm not an onion fan. This was also my first time eating polenta. I tried it plain directly out of the tube and didn't think it was particularly tasty, and while it didn't add a whole lot of flavor to the dish, I really enjoyed the added texture of it.
I will definitely make this dish again but I think next time I will mix the fajita seasoning with the beans and corn as well as with the green peppers.

Was pretty runny & didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  Seemed to be better as leftovers the second day.  Will probably make again, but I need to play around with it some more...

I made this recipe for a party in which we had some guests who were vegetarian attending and it was a hit. I didnt have any eggplant but i substituted with more mushrooms and a whole can of olives. I also did not want to add salsa but i used prego instead and this gave the dish just the right tomato flavor without being too over powering. The dish was runny but everyone was still willing to dive right in. Everyone who ate it said it was fabulous!

this is a great mix of ingredients - and the great thing is that you could use any vegetables you like. i followed the recipe fairly closely, the only thing i added was coriander (because i add it to everything).  next time i will try it with squash and broccoli.

I saw polenta in the grocery store for the first time and looked for a recipe to use it in, and came across this.  Although it's not the usual recipe that my family gravitates towards, I am so glad I gave it a try!  It is so yummy!  And since it is loaded with healthy yummy things we don't feel the guilt along with our love for it.  I've made it for several friends who were trying to find healthier recipes and they all have raved about it.  We don't like olives so that is the only change we made - to omit them.  Give it a try and enjoy!

We just thought this was OK.  I omitted the kidney beans and eggplant due to personal dislike adn subbed red pepper for green and taco seasoning for fajita.  I fried the polenta and served the salsa on the side.  Seemed like too much trouble for something that didn't knock off our socks, but it was a good meatless meal to for us to try.

I loved this -- really healthy, great for lunch the next day, zippy and filling.  The kids didn't like it at all.  I made it exactly as described and will definitely make it again. Thanks!

I thought this recipe was fabulous! It was very yummy and tasteful. I think next time I will add some cheddar to polenta (I had not had it before and think it is just a tad bland) but otherwise was excellent!!

Pretty good.  LP says if there was a vegetarian rating it would rate 5 stars.  Personally, I wasn't fond of the pre-made polenta.  Next time I'll make my own.  Thank you for sharing and inspiring.

I've never cooked with polenta before, and I doubt I ever will again. The taste wasn't too bad but I really disliked the grainy mushy texture. Husband wasn't too keen either. The rest of the meal was ok. I added some red pepper flakes for a little heat. Thanks anyway.

I was just looking for something vegetarian.  This recipe really surprised me with the first bite.  It was delicious.  It's also very versatile because you can change the vegetables around to suit your own tastes.  Thank you so much for posting this winner!

So, while I really loved the flavor combinations of this dish, if I make it again, I will definitely pay attention to the water content of the vegetables I'm using- we had more of a polenta mush situation when I made it. 

But, easy enough to make and an interesting way to eat vegetables.

Delicious flavor. A little inconsistent in texture though--lots of loose whole beans floating in juice.  

I liked it.  My one year old ate it up.  My three year old wouldn't touch it and my dh ate it but wouldn't eat the left overs.

It was worth the try but don't know if I would make it again.

This is a quick and healthy meal that has great flavor. I didn't have eggplant or green peppers on hand so I left them out and didn't miss them. I also used cheddar instead of mozzarella and used less than the suggested amount. My only complaint is that alot of liquid pooled at the bottom of the pan (I think I can attribute it to the salsa).  All in all...very nice recipe to try and I will probably make again with some slight changes!

I love this. I used spinach and onion for veggies because that's all I had. And only black beans, because, again, that's what was in my cupboard. Wow. I was so surprised and how delicious this was.

Being on WW, I'm always on the lookout for new recipes to adapt to the program. This one is a winner! I have never tried polenta before, so I was apprehensive.  After reading all the reviews, I decided to pan fry the polenta for a few minutes before putting it in the casserole dish. Then I sautéed corn, black beans, jalapeno, red onion, red pepper and yellow squash seasoned with taco seasoning. Added the salsa and some salt & pepper. Put that all on top of the polenta and added a sprinkling of mozzarella.  Baked it for 15 min.  Delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty and very messy, I served the salsa on the side. Since it falls apart when scooping it out, I might try skipping the polenta next time and just wrapping the beans and veggies in a tortilla.

I am new to vegetarian meals, as is my husband, and we both loved it except too much sodium for us. Here is how I altered it for next time: I will use no added salt beans, corn and a small can of no added salt mushrooms( if I don't have fresh ones available again). I will double the polenta , with one having sundries tomatoes). I will continue to use a sweet onion and 8 ounces of jack's cantina- styled salsa( available in refrigerated section of Costco ). I will also use 6 cheese Italian shredded cheese. And no black olives.
Staying as true to the intended recipe as I can, at this time.
Great concept Karen, thanks! Five stars!

I didn't really care for this recipe, but my husband enjoyed it.  I thought it was too crumbly.  In the end we ate it in tortillas and that worked out pretty well.

We are not fans of bell pepper and have no eggplant, but used 2 zucchini and a small can of chopped ortega chili peppers.  We loved the flavor, first time polenta eaters, would make again and again!!

This was really good.  I followed the advice of making my own salsa instead of using bottled.  Delicious!  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Very easy!
