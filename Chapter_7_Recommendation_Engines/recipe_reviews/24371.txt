Very disappointed considering how high this salad rates with others. Needs to be sweeter so definitely add some honey. Also, I like very hot things but the cayenne, although a small amount, needs to really be cut down or left out altogether. Your mouth shouldn't be burning after eating a fruit salad. The dressing was a pretty color and maybe just allow people to people put it on the fruit if they desire. Otherwise too many flavors going on here. I have a big bowl of unappealing fruit now that no one will touch. Will not make again.

This fruit salad is delicious.  I ate it all myself in a few days.  The dressing is great and doesn't need any additional sugar.  I made use less banana next time because it has such a strong flavor.

After searching among many fruit salad recipes, I decided to make this one for a picnic.  Everyone thought it was delicious!  It was hard to find a recipe with no added refined sugar or fat.  The only change I made was to the dressing after putting it in the food processor.  I strained it to remove the raspberry seeds.  Excellent and will make again and again!

This was delicious - and got rave reviews from my Dad, who is a true gourmet.  If anything I would watch the amount of dressing, or better yet, add some more fruit!  Went well with the saltier seasame chicken and fried rice I served!

This is different, I thought it needed some additional sweetness.  Next time I will add some sugar or 1/4 cup of maple syrup.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm not a fruit salad fan at all so I didn't even taste this. But hubby loves fruit salad and he did like it, thus 4 star rating.

I thought this was absolutely excellent.  Blackberries also work well if you don't have raspberries.  Also, I do recommend adding about 1/2 cup sugar or so to the sauce mix.  I will definitely keep this recipe!

I love how the dressing is made of fruit itself and how versatile it is, you can use whatever fruit is handy.  But I don't like the cayenne pepper!  I thought it sounded strange, but I used it anyways.  It turns out I don't like it.  I like spicy food, but I don't like spicy fruit!  I might make this again, but without the cayenne.

yummy!  i used seasonal fruit consisting of white grapes, blueberries, mangoes, strawberries & of course bananas.  i didn't have raspberries for the sauce, so w/o thinking it through, i used marionberries.  i did not like having the seeds from these along w/ the poppy seeds.  that's not a good combo in a fruit salad.  if i make this again, i will definitely use raspberries.  i also could taste the salt, which i didn't care for.  i omitted the cayenne, b/c i was feeding other peoples toddlers, & didn't feel they would care for it.  one last thing, as others suggested, my strawberries were a slight bit sour, so i sprinkled sugar on them after washing & chopping.

I liked this recipe a lot! I made it for a picnic, and it was enjoyed by everyone. for the dressing, I used blackberries instead of raspberries; used only half a banana; used Simply Orange brand juice with mango; used red wine vinegar; and omitted the poppy seeds (they were expensive). I used what fruits were available at the store (blackberries, red grapes, apple, banana, kiwi, plum, and strawberries). it was great! it definitely had a kick to it, which I didn't mind, but if you are sensitive to spiciness, you may want to decrease the amount of cayenne pepper. in my opinion, it was sweet enough as is and doesn't need any added sugar.

I have now made this twice and it was a big hit both times.  I did change it up a little- I used strawberries, blueberries kiwi and mango for my fruit.  I left out the salt and cayenne pepper and added a little sugar.  the lime juice and vinegar give it just a nice little twang.  i used about 1/3 of a bag of frozen raspberries in the sauce.  It was delicious!  I will definitely keep this recipe and make it again.

I think I was just expecting way too much out of this.  I was looking for something sweeter and fruitier.  Served the dressing on the side so people could add as much as they wanted, and wound up throwing most of it away.

I used freshly ground black pepper instead of cayenne and it gave the fruit a nice kick; guests wondered how I got that punch in a fruit dish. I only used 1 Tbs. of poppy seeds. That seemed like enough to me.

This is very good. I didn't follow the recipe exactly however. Due to everyone's liking, we did blueberries, strawberries, grapes and kiwi for the fruit. Then for the dressing I didn't have raspberries so I used some frozen fruit (pineapple, mango, peach). I also added some Almond extract, flax seeds and about 1 Tablespoon of honey. Just enough to take the citrus pop down a level, but not make it sweet. I loved it and so did my daughter and husband. We have found a new fruit salad just in time for summer. I have a feeling we will be making this weekly.

I made this for a PTA luncheon and it disappeared - everyone really loved it.  I left out the watermelon because I don't like the way it holds up in fruit salads.  I substituted peaches instead because they were on sale.  The fruit looked so beautiful in the bowl though, I almost didn't want to add the dressing! The only substitution I made, besides the peaches for the watermelon, was the raspberry vinegar. I couldn't find it in the store so I used raspberry vinegrette instead (salad dressing).  Being I used that, I just left out the olive oil and salt (being it was included in the dressing anyway).  I also did not add the cayenne - just didn't seem right to me.  Nice recipe!

The Poppyseed Dressing was delicious!  It tasted sort of like a rainbow sherbert.  Great salad to bring to a family event.  I used half the banana and only half the dressing.  Added one kiwi and one mango, also.

Well I didn't have a banana or poppy seeds What I did have was marshmallow cream. I put about three large spoonfuls of it in the blender and let it blend until no little specks of marshmallow showed. It had an almost sherbet taste to it. Everyone enjoyed it.

Brilliant idea to dress a fruit salad with a fruit sauce!  I tried this with strawberries, mango, kiwi, and blueberries and loved it. I wasn't sure about the cayenne so I left it out.

I made the sauce as is, no changes. The only thing I didn't use was watermelon. I have been using this recipe for about a year and a half. The best part of this recipe is no sugar. Fruit already has naturally occurring sugar. A person with a healthy palette will appreciate the simplicity of this recipe while getting the health benefits. This recipe does not need artificial sugar it's already sweet. Also remember the quality of the fruit can affect the sweetness, including if it's in the right season.
