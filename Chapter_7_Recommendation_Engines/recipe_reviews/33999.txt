This was a good recipe. The first time I tried it, the biscuits came out dry. So this time, I doubled the butter (which is what i used instead of shortening), added an extra teaspoon of baking powder, I also eyed my milk as the recipe suggested only adding enough to make it into a ball. I also left my sweet potatoes a little undone so i had little flecks of sweet potatoe pieces cooked nicely in the biscuits and cooked them a little slower on 375 instead of 400. they came out very nice and tender. yummy

I'm giving these biscuits 5 stars because I thought the flavor was great. I also had 3 other approvals.  For some reason they didn't rise very much, maybe I didn't bake them quite long enough.  I used 2 med. sized yams (or sweet potatoes) and microwaved them until they were soft.  Let them cool a bit and then dug out the potato. I added 1 Tbs. of brown sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  I also used real butter in place of the shortening.  Next time I'll try with whole wheat flour.  Used honey, cinnamon butter on top. Served with beef stew and rice.

YUM!  Make these!  I made mine drop biscuits so I didn't have to make a mess on my countertop and they turned out great.  Served them with cinnamon honey butter.  FYI 3/4c is about two small sweet potatoes.

These are sooo delicious!!! I make em pretty often.  I use butter, not shortening - after cutting in small pieces with a knife, you just have to use your hands for several minutes and keep squeezing the dough to get the butter mixed in completely. Just keep going until the dough mixture crumbles are pea-sized or smaller. The biscuits are so much better if you add extra cinnamon, sugar and raisins.  Soak raisins in warm water for 8 min, drain, before mixing into the dough. I never cut the biscuits, just use my hands to make small balls and flatten them.

mmm, i'm eating it right now. i used margerine instead of shortening and added a little extra baking powder (to help it rise, after reading the reviews), about a half tablespoon of brown sugar, some cinnimon, allspice, and nutmeg. i microwaved the sweet potato for 10 minutes after poking holes in it and wrapping it in a damp paper towel to soften it. i give it 4 stars because the flavor is still not fantastic, and i don't think it would have been very good at all without the additions. note: make sure you add milk slowly. i didn't use the full 1/4 cup, and that's probably why some people have trouble getting their biscuits light and fluffy. add milk until everything just sticks together.

Delicious recipe and easy to follow. I used whole wheat flour and it made the biscuits a little heavy, but still perfect for a dinner compliment!

Amazing! So light and fluffy-- just the perfect texture. The flavor (per recipe without modifications) is well-suited to either serve as a sweet (with a glaze topping, cream cheese, or powdered sugar) or a savory dish (on the side with soup or chili). I doubled the batch and made one pan of thinly rolled dough cut with a leaf-shape cutter-- perfect size for snacking. The second pan I made the rolls as directed. Next time I will add some more spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves) and experiment with pumpkin as well. Thanks for the awesome recipe! I look forward to using it over and over again!!

We liked them extremely well. They'd be great with a chicken salad for a luncheon. They're just super hot from the oven. I bet kiddies would love to munch on these sweet and tender morsels!

I have made these biscuits again and again.  Even my husband who hates sweet potatoes loves them.  I use half whole wheat flour and they always turn out tall and fluffy.

I agree with others that the recipe calls for too much salt. I used a scant 1/2 teaspoon and it was still a little too much. Other than that, I really liked these and will make them again. I was out of sugar and used honey and used soy milk instead of dairy milk.

We really liked our adapted version of these.  They were quick, easy, and nutritious!  After reading several reviews, I cut back the salt to a scant 1/2 teaspoon and that was for a double batch!  I added 2 teaspoons of white sugar, 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and used 1/2 cup of butter instead of shortening.  It took just about 1/3 cup of milk to make the dough hold together.  We made them into drop biscuits to save time, and sprinkled brown sugar on top before baking.  Everyone loved them!

These were average at best. Maybe even a little below average. I could taste nothing but the salt in these biscuits. Did not taste the sweet potato in the biscuits at all. make sure you reduce the salt if you attempt to make these and make sure they are atleast 1/2 in.or more thick before baking because these do not rise very well, if at all.

Oh, lordy. Are these heaven! I used buttermilk, that was the only change I made. These were gone right off. No leftovers! I did my best to not overhandle the dough and used the top of a fat jelly jar to cut out my biscuits. Very, very good. I tried one bite and ended up inhaling a whole one before I made myself stop. This one's a keeper.

This recipe has been a staple since I discovered it a few years ago. I used it again tonight to put on top of a chicken pot pie. It got rave reviews!! I put a pecan praline glaze on the left overs and it was the perfect complement to this light fluffy biscuit. Thanks a gain for this great recipe.

My grand kids love these...there were so easy to prepare and were light and flaky..I added a little more butter in that No vegetable shortiening was available... I used 3/4 stick of butter chilled and cut into cubes..it make for a more flakier dough and also added a little more of the sweet potato to give it more flavor...thanks for the recipe!

SWEET POTATO SCONES  That would be the appopriate title, but maybe fewer people would try them.  But if the title was right, fewer would expect them to rise like Grands fluffy biscuits.   Okay, I really dont like when people change recipes then rate them on the 'new' recipe - but here goes.  I used 1 cp + a lil bit more of flour.  Used almost 1/2 stick of butter (no shortening) added 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder (per other reviews) and a lil baking soda.  I put a little vanilla in half the batch.  I also only used 2-3 teaspoons of milk.  I didnt go thru the final step, putting the dough on the flour.  I just mixed the dough with my hands and pinched out the 'biscuits' and molded them in my hands.

So good and so EASY!!!!! I had one piping hot right out of the oven. Oh jeez, these are evil! I slathered the second one with chili honey butter and almost died and went to heaven! These will definitely be added to my recipe repetoire. I'd like to experiment with freezing the dough.

Except for measuring the yams and milk ( I probably added a cup of yams and just enough milk to make drop biscuits) , I made these biscuits as listed and they were delicious. I would cook extra yams just to make this recipe a few days later!

Really yummy biscuit, but don't expect a huge sweet potato flavor. I used a fresh, mashed sweet potato and before I incorporated it into the flour mixture, I mixed in a little brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter to give it an extra bit of sweetness. Although the biscuits don't really taste sweet-potatoey, they are still really good and the sweet potato gives them a really nice texture. I slathered some store bought cinnamon butter (country crock) right on top and OH MY GOSH. AAMAZINGGG. I highly recommend doing this. It transformed the flavor. Made it a million times better.

I thought my sweet potatoes (cooked with cinnamon and brown sugar) would make these sweet enough, but I wish I had added more cinnamon and cut the salt in half. Still, these were good, and a great way to use leftovers. I rolled the dough into small balls and flattened them a bit with my hand, instead of rolling them out. Easier, I think.

What a surprise to have something turn out exactly as described.  After reading the reviews, I omitted the sugar and used sweet potato pie filling for the sweet potatoes.  Solved the spice issue.  I cut them out small and will use as appetizers with ham.  Thanks Cynthia B.

We had leftover Sweet Potato fries and made them into mashed potatoes (1st steaming to soften) with some milk, butter, nutmeg, cloves.  They worked excellently in the biscuits! We also added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the recipe to add some flavor.  These were delicious with honey.

My first time making biscuits, and these came out almost perfectly! Better than most store-bought ones I've had. My only problem was that these were too salty! Next time, I'll use either half or 2/3 the amount specified.

Tasted great but never rose. Next time, more baking powder, or possibly just rolling them to a 1 inch thickness.

these were light and fluffy, but the taste was not good.  They were too heavy on the salt and baking powder flavor wise.

I liked them, but I was the only one in the family who did.  I found that they worked well as drop biscuits.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and upped the amount of baking powder but they still wouldn't rise. AT ALL.  So they were flat and dense.  Flatter even than the posted recipe picture.  Having said that, the flavor was good, and everyone enjoyed them anyway.  I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk.

This is an excellent sweet potato biscuit recipe.  I made these for Thanksgiving 2012 and again for New Year's Eve dinner 2012.  I doubled the recipe the second go round because everyone loved them.  I did make one small change in the recipe:  I added about 1/4 cup brown sugar to the recipe to give it a little sweeter taste.  They seem to get better each time I make them.

Great recipe! Wish I had cut back on the salt, as recommended. I used coconut oil instead of shortening, half of the flour was whole wheat, and I laid them out on the pan with sides touching to keep them soft. The texture is marvelous and the flavor a fun change. Can't wait to enjoy them with syrup for breakfast. I made the batch multiplied by ten to use up potatoes, so it even works in bulk, and my six and four-year-old sons helped roll them out and they still were flaky and tender!

Tasty, tender, easy biscuit recipe with one minor flaw:  For my taste, this contains too much salt.  One half or 3/4 teaspoon would have been about right, as other members suggested; wish I'd noticed that in the reviews beforehand.  We love these with a thin slice of pan-fried turkey ham.  Served plain, they're a hit with the kids.

I thought these were great . . . and EASY!  Had some leftover mashed sweet potatoes from Thanksgiving and whipped them into these little gems.  My husband loves them with a little honey.  I made exactly according to recipe except cut the salt to 1/2 tsp as suggested by others.

This is a pretty good recipe. It's just not as sweet I would like for it to be. But I would definitely make it again adding more sugar and some brown sugar.

Delicious!  Thanks to all the reviews about cutting the salt and adding some flavor (brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla).  Softened butter worked great and I was glad to be able to use some of the leftover sweetpots, I even threw in the pecans.  Yum!

I have found that you don't want to overwork your biscuit dough it will make them dry and tough. These are great . Will make them again. Thanks for the recipe.

I love the nutrient value and overall great effect of using sweet potatoes. Thanks to the reviewer for the suggestions of using more baking soda, they'll need it. Mine didn't come out too salty, but I use natural sea salt, so maybe that made a difference.) I always use butter for cooking (no transfat margarine or shortening residing permenantly in my body).

My whole family loved these biscuits from me,my husband, to my 3 and 1 year old.  I did however use a little more potato and I didn't boil my potatoes I microwaved them like baked potatoes and just scooped out the meat.  Worked great and alot less hassle. I will be using this recipe again and again.

Yummy. Best if kneaded into a soft dough and cut into shape as directed.(Not a good "drop" biscuit) I used my cutter to cut little "rounds" of left over easter honey ham and added a little miracle whip and Voila! Yummy little hamwiches for our lunch bags on Monday. I got a good response from the brown baggers at my house!

Quick and easy to make. Excellent with melted butter. I didn't feel like rolling the dough on a floured surface, so I opted to drop the dough from a tablespoon on a baking sheet. Next time, I think I'll add some spices to the sweet potatoes before mixing them into the dough for a little zip.

These were easy to make vegan, I did not need any milk but was prepared to use soy milk. We found them to be tasty and pillow soft. Would be a nice addition for any meal. I kept all the ingredients in the refrigerator until I mixed per the directions. I have linked it on my site so other vegans can enjoy.

These came out great (as I finish my second)!! I followed other's suggestions such as using 4 tsp of brown sugar (I'll use 5 next time), not even 1/2 tsp of salt, just a pinch, 4 tsp of baking powder and 3 tbsp of butter. You won't really even need a 1/4 cup of milk. Pour slowly and a little at a time so that it doesn't become soupy. These came out fluffy and light. LOVE them!! Next time I'll add raisins, but not the extra tsp of brown sugar so they won't be overly sweet.

Pretty good but a bit bland.  Used butter i/o shortening and still needed to add butter when eating them.  Needs another ingredient to make it a five-star recipe.  Will try brown i/o white sugar next time.

This worked out ok. Nothing spectacular. My husband liked them. I subbed butter and margarine for the shortening. I only had about a half teaspoon of butter and the rest of the 2 tablespoons i used margarine. I dont bake often so this is out of my comfort level. Good enough.

I thought this was a good base recipe.  I did substitute Buttermilk for the milk and added some sharp cheddar cheese & chives to the mixture.  I also used butter and not shortening (just personal preference!)  They turned out fabulous.  I served them with thick cut ham slices and apple butter!  Yummy!

Delicious. I licked the dough off my fingers after mixing it! I patted out balls of the dough instead of rolling and cutting and that worked well for me.

Wish I had read the reviews before making these...I agree there is too much salt and I could taste the baking powder....texture was good though and they did raise well....probably won't make again....used a whole cup of fresh cooked sweet potato but still couldn't taste it very much.

Nice light biscuits, and easy to make. I used the food processor to bring it together, then dumped on the counter to finish.  I used butter instead of shortening and only needed about half the milk. Went great with turkey soup on a post-Thanksgiving clearout! I'll definitely make these again.

The recipe should call for fresh baked sweet potato instead of canned.  I used canned because that is what I had on hand and I believe that the water/liquid in the canned ones cause the biscuits not to rise properly.  I think that a fresh sweet potato would make a world of difference.  I will try it again.  I also added a bit of cinnamon and a little more sugar.  My husband and son loved them even with the mishap, they just didn't know what to call them!!!

These were good~~not fantastic, but good.  I added extra baking powder, and used brown sugar and cinnamon to up the flavor.  Served them hot with butter and drizzled honey on them as well.  The consensus was that by themselves they were pretty nondescript but that the butter and honey put them over the top.  I'll probably make these again....

This recipe might be the best I've found.  No matter who tries them, I end up walking away with requests.  No matter what the event I'm asked to bring these biscuits.  Lovely texture, I do add cayenne or paprika in lieu of cinnamon for dinner, but I love the original buscuit with a little lemon curd in the morning.

This was a pretty good recipe.  However, I added just a couple of things.  I used Cake Flour instead of all purpose flour.  (A pastry chef onnce told me to use cake flour and not all-purpose flour when baking.)  Also, I used canned sweet potato and added about a teasponn of vanilla extract and some cinnamon while mashing!)  Also, for shortening, I used butter-flavored crisco.  I will make again, but I think I might add a touch more baking powder.  They were a little flat, but good!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I made the recipe as-is and the result was a perfect, moist biscuit.  The sweet potato really adds a great flavor, but it doesn't outright taste like sweet potatoes.  I made this to use up sweet potatoes that were about to turn and knowing that made the mashed sweet potatoes pretty bland with no added ingredients like cinnamon, etc.  I would def make this again.  The only thing I did different was to drop the biscuits by spoon rather than cutting them because the batter was a little sticky, plus the rustic look is nice.  I like my baked goods to look homemade rather than from a Pillsbury can.

Good recipe, although I may add a little more sugar next time to make them a bit a sweeter. But great with some honey butter or just plain honey!

Am I the only one that thought these were too salty?  I'm a big fan of salt, but even I thought it was a bit much.  Otherwise, they were pretty yummy, and yes, a bit flat.  Mine only got about a quarter inch taller than the original dough cut-outs.  Overall - good, but I'll be trying other similar recipes before I make this one again...just seems to need a little "tweaking"!

Quite good.  My sister hates sweet potatoes and unfortunately she saw me mashing them and then saw the biscuits were orange - she wouldn't take one.  When everyone was going "mmm" though, she decided to try one, and even wanted seconds!  That tells you enough about these biscuits.  I wouldn't use for a sandwich; mine were quite small & puffy (only got 7) but tasty.  Bit like english muffin or scone.  Give 'em a go.  I boiled my potatoes quite long and stirred a fair bit of cinnamon and brown sugar into the flour.  Used full 1/4 c. milk.

Very mild sweet potato flavor--I would have liked more.  They're a lovely color, and were great plain, even without dinner.  My toddler gobbled them, making them a great sneaky way to get some veggies into him.

These biscuits are great tasting! I would add less salt and more butter next time. They didn't rise as well as I had expected but all in all its a great recipe that is easy to tweak to preference.

these turned out good...almost like a cookie. I did double the butter as one review had said, added 1 more tsp. baking powder, used half white flour and half whole wheat flour, splenda in place of white sugar, and I topped them with a little spinkle of brown sugar. I served with honey butter and my kids were fighting over them. I will make again!

I gave this recipe five stars because it is now a staple bread item for me.  I love sweet potatoes, and I am always looking for ways to cook with them.  I make up these bicuits on the weekend, and I use them in my lunch with a salad and some fruit for the rest of the week.  For me, the dough turns out a little more sticky than it may for others.  I add more flour to the dough after I have turned it onto the bread board until I get it to the consistancy I like.  The biscuits bake up very nicely, and they taste great.

These were a huge hit at our party! I tripled the recipe and made little drop biscuits. Then I sprinkled with sugar before baking and dusted with powdered sugar when they came out of the oven to give them a boost of 'sweet' and a nice presentation. I even accidentally added too much milk at the end which made them flatten out a bit (not ideal) but no one seemed to mind - they were that good!

These biscuits are really good.  And very pretty.  Nice consistancy.  I didnt give it a five because I didnt think they were fantastic.  I would take the other reviewers advice and add something to them.  Next time I will add more baking powder reduce the salt and add some spices and brown sugar. I made them to go with beef stew so they will be great. Easy to make, and all the ingredients are on hand....will make again.

These were ok but not great. My dough was a little hard to handle so I formed the biscuits by dropping a tablespoon full on my cookie sheet. I would not be in a rush to make these again.

It's okay.  I ended up spreading a lot of butter on top for more taste.  I had to bake it for at least 35 min.  Maybe the dough was too soft or they were placed on the baking sheet too thick?  I might try this again. I gave it 3 stars because it requires basic ingredients and my picky husband had seconds. I might try this again.

MMMM!  These were delicious home-style biscuits!  I used leftover mashed sweet potatoes and carrots from Christmas dinner and they turned out beautifully!  They had such a pretty golden orange color!

Flavor was good, but they definitely were not light and fluffy!  So disappointing!  They came out small, dense, and flat.  I may try again to see if I get better results.

These came out pretty good!  I'm actually really pleased because I had a TON of leftover Sweet Potatoes from Thanksgiving, and just didn't feel like eating anymore potatoes!  I used butter instead of shortening, and it was fine.  I wound up with 9 bisquets in total.

They were unbelievably quick to make.  I just ate some with cream cheese spread on top...mmmm!
