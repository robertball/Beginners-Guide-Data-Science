I liked this recipe because it was so simple, but did add a few things to give it a bit of extra flavor.  I made it as a side dish, so left out the chicken.  I added fresh basil and green onions, then sprinkled parmesan cheese on top.  We all enjoyed it, and I'm sure I'll make it again.  Nice on a hot day, and the leftovers make an easy lunch!

My family loved this meal.  I had to make a 2nd batch since the first one disappeared right away. I doubled the amount of vegetables and added 1 package of onion soup mix powder.

Loved using frozen veggies--so easy. Needs a lot of spices like seasoning salt. Best if it sits and marinates for awhile.

I seasoned the meat with several random spices before cooking which helped tremendously.  I put in 12 oz of mixed veggies, but I'd definitely add more next time.  I am hoping the flavors will meld together overnight and make some delicious left-overs.  The pasta still needed some flavor!

I've made this several times and its a great treat to take for lunch.   Using "fiesta style" frozen vegatables makes it even better!

This pasta salad is very tasty, and very easy to make.  I took a shortcut by cooking the chicken in the microwave.

A little bland.  1 halved the recipe for my family of four (two younger kids) with plenty left over, though I probably didn't need to halve the vegetables.  I'd adjust the portions and add some more seasoning if I make it again.

Now, this is my kind of pasta salad- simple and delicate but filling.  The nice thing is it isnâ€™t overly seasoned, so it tastes like the fresh ingredients it contains. I added more veggies than the amount written.  I roasted some baby zucchini  with the chicken. Thank you for the recipe.
