I made this recipe paired with the peanut butter/banana grilled sandwich.
I actually did cinnamon applesauce on one side and Adams crunchy peanut butter on the other side, then cooked it in a buttered pan. The kids LOVED it. I will make it again.

I used to eat these as a kid but with a little difference in the recipe.  I use cream cheese on one piece of honey wheat bread and then add the applesauce.  After lightly grilling, I sprinkle with cinnamon...makes it like an apple turnover...

Ooooooohhhohohohohohohoh.....
This was SO tasty...and not so unhealthy (and a WINNER of a bedtime snack).  I added a bit of cinnamon to the applesauce...it was sort of apple pie like.

I can't believe it, my 2-year-old ate a WHOLE sandwich!!!  She's so picky, but she thought this was GREAT!  I think it would be best to use a pretty sweet applesauce rather than unsweetened.  I also think this recipe would be great with ripe bananas or whole fruit preserves.  One note, you have to serve the sandwiches immediately, as they get soggy pretty fast.

Instead of apple sauce I use apple pie filling.I made these for a bridal shower brunch and cut each sandwich into 4 triangles. I arranged them all on a plate and dusted them with powdered sugar. They were a hit! Nice and simple to make without alot of fuss or clean-up.

Unfortunately I was not impressed with recipe.  It reminded me with toast with apple butter spread on it.  I thought it could have had more flavor...maybe a sprinkling of cinnamon or something.

I always used to make these for my lunches and they turned out fine, if they could make my lunch bag first. I started to make them because I could no longer have certain foods and was tired of sandwiches. These are awesome. They only get soggy when you use different types of bread that are flimsy. I use frozen spelt bread and it doesn't get soggy. Also try it with spice bread or Applesauce Bread to give it a nice kick.

Totally delicious.  Make sure that the bread is browed nicely .... otherwise the sandwich will be too soggy.  Once the bread was brown the sandwich stayed together and it was awesome!!!

I thought the idea of this recipe was pretty gross at first, but it turned out to be decent. I used cinnamon raisin bread with a little cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top, browned the bread beforehand and it was good. I will definitely throw this together for little ones that I will have in the future!

this was really good, but very mushy. The second time I made it i buttered both sides of the bread and toasted them a little bit before i added the applesauce.

I made it as written and was not overly enthused.  The next time I used a chunky applesauce and cheddar cheese.  Is now a keeper.

This is so simple and very satisfying.  I had low expectations because it seemed so darn simple.  But, I was pleasantly surprised.  I used cinnamon flavored applesauce, so that probably helped.  It is definitely a easy snack.

Made this the first time as is, and it was awesome. The second time, I put cream cheese on one side and a thin layer of honey on the other, then added the applesauce. It was even better, and less soggy. Also, instead of butter, I used cooking spray on the pan. This is a great sandwich, especially since I'm trying to eat healthier. It's a better option than grilled cheese.

I thought this was a great quick lunch idea.  My 2 year old enjoyed it and so did I.  I sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon on top of the applesauce.  I will keep this recipe in mind when making a quick lunch!

I added cinnamon and Splenda to the applesauce, and then drizzled honey on the "pie" and it still tasted like warm mush.  Maybe for kids, and maybe as a last resort on a diet - otherwise, I didn't like it.

This is awesome as a snack or for lunch - yes it does make the bread mushy on the inside, but it still tastes amazing. Really good on cinnamon raisin bread!

This recipe was a disappointment.  The bread got all soggy from the applesauce.  If I decide to make this again I guess I would use less applesauce.

My 1 year old loves this.  I didnt think it was so great but anything my picky son eats deserves 5 stars.  Ive made this twice already and I butter and toast both sides of the bread so its not as soggy.  The second time I added banana slices and my little one couldnt get enough.  I also sprinkled powder sugar on top.  Thanks for this.

A great quick and easy sweet breakfast treat so I gave it a 4 star. We added a dash of cin. to the applesauce and dredged the sandwich in an egg and milk mixture(like you make french toast) and then fried in a skillet lightly coated with butter and then dusted the finished product with powder sugar for a sweet tooth fix!

I did like someone else and put apple sauce  on one of the slices of bread, cream cheese with cinnamon sugar on the other slice, and then cooked it in a skillet like a grilled cheese sandwich.  I sprinkled more cinnamon sugar on top.  It wasn't my favorite thing ever, but quick and easy to make and fairly good tasting.  In a couple days I'm going to make one for my boyfriend for breakfast and see what he thinks!

Loved this recipe. I added a cinnamon, sugar, and a little nutmeg mixture on top of the applesauce. My 3 year old kept asking for more. It was a big hit!

Of course you can expect your bread to get pretty mushy, the recipe tells you the apple sauce soaks into the bread.  I thought this was pretty good.  It was something new that had a nice flavor.  I don't care for "mushy" much but these were tasty so they were fine.  I will probably make them again but try using the sandwich maker, and also try toasting some bread and buttering the inside to have a toasty apple sauce sandwich.  I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar all over the sandwich ~ yum! Thanks for the neat idea.

This was the perfect late night snack and just what I was craving! It did in a way taste like apple pie.

These were great!!  Kids loved them.  Instead of buttering the bread, I melted butter and mixed some cinnamon, then brushed that on.  Next time, I'm going to try cinnamon bread.

really weird texture, even the tittle of the sandwich had me thinking..hmm applesauce on bread? Seemed strange to me, but i gave it a try. Me and my 4 year old son sat down to eat it and yuck! We didnt like it, we ended up tossing it and grabbing a granola bar. But hey maybe its just us,its definatly intresting thats all i can say if your looking for something new.

this was really good, though i was worried it would be too mushy so i toasted the bread first and then buttered the one side and placed it in a hot pan. only put a thin spread of the applesauce on and then added some cinnamon, br. sugar a few raisins on one side. cooked it nice and crispy then stuck them together....yuuummmyyy! not too mushy at all, great idea for snack time!

I can't believe I actually tried this. The texture was terrible and (not surprisingly) tasted bland. Even if the bread is toasted properly, the sandwich sags and resembles eating pre-chewed food.

I just made this for myself, as a late-night snack too, but I'm a long way from my childhood days. This is a clever little idea - I've never heard of such a thing. I made it exactly as written, using quality Honey Wheat bread from a local bakery. I guess I expected the applesauce to be totally absorbed into the bread or something, but that didn't happen - maybe a little soaked in, though. All in all, this was a tasty treat, though I can't figure out the best kind of occasion for this - it doesn't seem like a breakfast or lunch thing, so I guess it's good for "I feel like having something", whenever that is. Thanks!

At first I wasnt sure how this would taste but I decided to make it with cinnamon applesauce rather than just adding cinnamon and it tasted amazing. My 2 1/2 daughter also loved this.
THANKS!

I was initially disappointed in this situation; I wanted a bit more substance.  It did grow on me as I ate the sandwich and have decided that I will make it again, but I'm going to experiment with ways to adjust it to feel a bit heartier - perhaps long banana slices.

Yummy!  I used homemade bread and sliced it thick to make sure it didn't get too soggy.  And I used Marionberry Applesauce from Trader Joe's.  Sprinkled some powdered sugar on top and viola!  Breakfast! Delicious.  I think tomorrow I am going to try a French Toast version and dip it in an egg before frying up and see how this turns out.  I never would have thought to put this recipe together - THANKS!

I told my friends how good this is and they didn't believe me until they tried it for themselves. It's so easy! I use low-cal bread, unsweetened applesauce, and just spray down the skillet with cooking spray. This is great with cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top!

Sara, I make my own applesauce which is full of cinnamon and at least 2 different kinds of apples. I would never have thought of using applesauce to make a sandwich until I spotted your recipe. This recipe is a winner. Thanks!

I thought this was pretty good. My toddler liked it. I only had regular applesauce, so I added cinnamon to it, and just grilled it like a grilled cheese sandwich. I'll keep making it for my little one since she likes it! Thanks!

The idea sounded good but the taste was off. Applesauce does not go well on bread.
