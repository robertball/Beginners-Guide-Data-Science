Did all of the prep work early in the day, so all that needed to be done this evening was to sauté the onions and garlic, add the salsa mixture, heat and then add the shrimp…my kind d of meal.  Used a red jalapeno instead of a red chile pepper (what I had on hand) which gave a lick kick of heat and added more lime juice.  Delicious, easy, full of fresh flavor and tender shrimp, thoroughly enjoyed.  Definitely will be made again.

I think I must have done something wrong because most of the reviews are positive for this dish. But for me, it was extremely acidic.  I tried to fix it by adding a little butter and sugar, but my family did not like this dish at all. :(

This a quick meal that had a great big taste. We served it over white rice with black beans in it and roasted asparagus. There was none left at the end of dinner.

Delicious over brown rice! Subbed a squirt of siracha for the chilli paste. Perfect amount of heat!

This is  great recipe. Not much I would change on it. I followed all the ingredients, I left out some of the lemon and lime juice (to taste, I like a little less of that what it said in the recipe) I used vegetable stock in place of the white wine, because the wine white tasted so much better drinking it as opposed cooking it out in this recipe.  I served it with rice, and it was so flavorful and delicious, I will make it again.

Great!!! Entire family loved it! Easy to make, my great 12 year old son make the masterpiece. My 9 year old daughter went back after she was done (she is a picky eater to). We agreed that maybe adding a little more spice to it might make it better. We substituted the red chili puree for a dried red pepper that i dehydrated in my sweet dehydrator. Overall 9/10

This was so good.  I made this in a pinch when I had some shrimp, but wasn't sure what to make with it.  Very flavorful.  Only wish I would have snapped a photo.  No leftovers, so I'll have to take one next time!

Served over rice. Is really good! Once sauce is prepped, which I did a day before, dinner is ready in just a few minutes!

My son and hubby liked this spicy dish because I used a medium salsa. If I make it again, I would probably get a milder version (or cut the heat with a cup of diced tomatoes instead of more salsa).  I also added diced celery in the beginning and served over white rice.

I forgot the red pepper, oops.  Not sure how it would have changed the taste.  Next time, I'll probably add a little more chili and the red peppers of course.

Excellent dish.  Hubby loved it too.  Used 2 lbs of shrimp and cooked a double batch of rice.  Basically increased the recipe a bit and had leftovers for a couple more meals and freezer lunches.

Fantastic recipe-- we loved it! I added a tablespoon of sugar to the sauce at the end to cut the acidity.

This was a big hit at our house especially with my 8 year old!  Used medium salsa which gave it nice heat with jalapeños and sriracha on the side for those who like it hot (omitted chili from recipe).  Can't wait to make it again!

Giving this 5 stars (which I normally don't do but I completely changed the recipe). I usually give 4 stars if it's good, three stars if it's okay, 2 stars if its alright and 1 star if it's not any of those things. Anyhoo...what was I talking about? Oh yeah, I'm reviewing this recipe. Well instead of shrimp I used scallops (that's all I had), instead of everything else I used pine nuts (all I had) salt (that's all I had) pepper (that's all I had) and a chopped pepper (all I had). It was GREAT! FIVE STARS but ONLY with these changes!

While there was a little bit too much prep work to get this recipe into my "quicker than delivery" file, it still came together fast and tasted great.

fantastic ! easy, fast, yummy.  I used a little more shrimp, there was still enough sauce.  had with rice...green beans, and a green salad.  I did leave out the pepper and used medium Tostito's salsa...because I had older people and kids eating....and it was  delicious.  Some of us added red pepper flakes for heat.  It's a keeper !!

Very good, nice and fresh taste, made the mistake of buying a thinner salsa, definitely should always use a thick and chunky salsa

All I can say is DELICIOUS!! Followed recipe for the most part. Didn't use white wine or red chili purée. Added a large chopped jalapeño for some heat and salt and pepper to taste. Loved this!

I made a few changes, so this may very well be 5 star if you follow it to a T. BTW, I am very stingy with 5 star ratings -- in my book, 4 means great and 5 means amazing. I used 2 lbs shrimp, threw a little bacon grease in with the oil for extra flavor, reduced salsa to 12 oz cuz that's all I had, only used 1/2 bell pepper cuz that's all I had, used chicken broth instead of wine, and omitted chili cuz I was afraid it would be too spicy for the kiddo. Served over rice. Will definitely make this again. Also, this is the second time I made this. The first time I followed the recipe more closely, however, I used a sweeter wine, which was a terrible mistake. Dry wine is a must for this recipe.
