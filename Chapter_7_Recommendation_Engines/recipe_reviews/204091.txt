Very good, I'm on weight watchers so I modified the recipe some to start. I cut out the olive oil completely! Sprayed my pan with some olive oil spray and fried the veggies, poured the dry quinoa on top and sprayed it then stirred, then added the juice/water. I had no walnuts so i toasted pecans instead, they were perfect! I used half the amount of raisins and still though they were a bit much. Next time I will cut back some more and add extra spice 1Tbsp was not enough for us. All in all, excellent!

I followed the advice in other reviews and omitted the cilantro (my husband hates), and halved the pumpkin pie spice.  It was a big hit at a church gathering, especially with the vegetarians in the group.  I didn't have walnuts, but would add them next time, it would take it up a notch.  Be prepared for your house to smell wonderful as an added bonus!

This recipe is very good.  Very flavorful!  I omitted the onion (because I'm breastfeeding) and the cilantro (I'm not a fan). It still was fabulous!

Very delicious dish. As you can see from my picture I served it with sauteed Brussels sprouts and loved every bite. I used parsley instead of cilantro because that's what I had.

I used craisins instead of raisins and cut the amount down to 3/4 C. also added more than 1/4 C of walnuts. It is definitely a keeper, very yummy

Mmmm...This is REALLY good! I liked all the raisins, even if my husband thought it was a bit heavy-handed with them. I used parsley, instead of cilantro. My only complaint was the lack of instruction whether or not to keep it covered. I ended up, towards the end, covering it and adding a few extra minutes to the cooking time. It was my first time using this grain, and I learned the little balls become clearish with a white center and then little "tail-like" sprouts appear. It's a keeper, and I'm so glad I used this recipe as my first with this new food.

Somewhat odd combination of flavors (onion and raisins) but I thought it was very tasty and fairly simple to make as well.

Did not really care for this even though I liked all the ingred. that went into it. The orange flavor was overpowering for my taste.

This is pretty good, but I would call it more sweet than spicy. If I make it again, I would cut down on the raisins (maybe 3/4 cup) and add more walnuts. They make it delicious! I added all the pumpkin pie spice, despite other reviews, and I wouldn't want to cut down on that at all.

This is a keeper. I omitted the cilantro because I don't care for it. The flavors were a little strong for my 3 year old so I will cut the pumpkin spice in half next time, but for grown ups it's great!

I loved this recipe. It was a tasty and alternative way to make quinoa. I followed it exactly and it came out delicious. I liked the combination of the raisins with the sublte taste of the orange juice. After bringing it to a boil, it took about 20minutes covered on low to be just right.

Didn't have any cilantro, used 1/2c less oj and 1/2c more water.  Raisin amount was combo raisins and dried cranberries because that's what I had.  Also, I don't keep Pumpkin Pie spice so I just made my own combo of it.  It was well received.

Not terrible, but not great either.  A little too sweet for our taste.  I think I'll stick with quinoa and veggies, which is what I usually make.

This was a great recipe.  I think the favorite quinoa recipe of my family so far (with kids age 5, 3 & 1).  The flavor was very good and I'm glad I followed the advice of several reviews add by halving the pumpkin spice and 3/4 cup raisins. I also added more carrots, along with celery and spinach.  It was great.  The more veggies the better for us.  We will be making this again. Thanks.

Very good!  Followed the recipe but added a few tablespoons of brown sugar and some salt.  I didn't think the cilantro either added to took away from the dish-- will omit next time.  I'll be making this dish again very soon.

I had leftover already made quinoa, so I made this dish in a wok more like a fried rice almost.   I was also lazy and didn't want to grate the carrots and just tried to chop them small - I would grate next time as I didn't get them cooked quite enough.  I added additional carrots too. I had cooked the quinoa with some red pepper flakes which added a nice smidge of heat.

I liked this a lot!  Easy to make and very tasty.  I didn't have any cilantro so I left that out.  I think the recipe calls for waaaaaay too many raisins; 3/4 cup seems about the right amount for me! Also, since my quinoa was damp from rinsing it, I dried and toasted it in a pan separately before adding to the onicn/carrot/raisin#spice mixture. ,Will definitely$make this again)

Love this recipe! Have made it numerous times and have to say it keeps tasting better and better even though I make it the same!   I bake butternut squash and then heap some of this into the middle and the only problem is, it tastes even better the next day! And there is never enough leftovers of it to use!

The hubby and I loved this. Didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so just used cinnamon. Still great. Also was short on raisins. Still very good, but we would have liked it better with the full amount. The raisins made the whole dish very sweet, even the onions. This will make great leftovers for breakfast. Almost like oatmeal. Good way to get veggies in for breakfast.

It was good. My husband hated it, but he doesn't like any of the ingredients.  :)
This dish was very easy to make and it makes a ton!  Next time, I'll half all the measurements (it's just me eating it). 

One hint, have all the ingredients measured and out before you begin the cooking process.

We thought this was OK.  I halved the OJ and used all the pumpkin spice.  The cilantro neither adds nor takes away from the dish.  I would recommend adding the nuts.  It needed salt.  Not dying to make it again.

I too made it without onions or cilantro.  I used a combo of raisins and craisins - mmmm!  It tasted delish, but the texture was dry.  I wonder if I need to add more liquid, to counteract the liquid absorbed by the dried fruit?
