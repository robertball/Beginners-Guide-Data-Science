I'm not a hard liquor girl at all, but it sounded so good I had to try it! I think it would also go well with club soda. It's a sweet hard drink that I think lots of ppl would like. I only gave it 4 stars cuz it did not convert me to hard liquor.

Ever wondered what a liquid banana runt would taste like?  This is it.  I would hazard to cut this with soda water, both for the over the top sweetness and to cut the alcohol a bit.
