I have used this recipe dozens of times and it is very simple and yummy! After creaming the butter and sugar together for 5 minutes, I use a kitchenaid mixer and beat each fresh, cold egg for 5 minutes. It has never turned out soupy for me. I also use regular sugar, and increase the cocoa to taste (6-8 TBS depending on where the pie is going). My suggestion is to add 6 tbs of cocoa, mix, then taste test - it should taste slightly stronger than you want the completed pie to taste. Even with regular sugar the pie has never been grainy, nor does it have a mousse like texture - it is very silky smooth. I prefer to top with store bought whipped cream piped on top, and chocolate shavings.

For those having trouble with the pie setting - when first mixing the butter and sugar together - MAKE SURE NOT TO OVER MIX the two!  The purpose of creaming is to just mix the two ingredients together.  If you use a power mixer to do this, it will overmix the two and your base will end up too runny.  You don't need to refrigerate the mixture in between, or wait too long when adding the eggs - just use a wire wisk and slowly and carefully whip the mixture together.

WONDERFUL PIE!!

My pie did not set up after beating for nearly 10 min. after each egg.  I tried the suggestion of placing the mixture in the freezer.  I left it there for 20 min. and then beat again.  It immediately set right up.  Great idea!  

Update: I tried the Bakers Sugar as suggested, it's perfect for this recipe!  

Finally, I added probably 3 tbs. more cocoa than this recepie called for.  Before adding the extra, it was more sweet than chocolaty and the extra cocoa seemed to balance it out nicely.

I had no idea that French Silk pie was so easy to make.  I would have made one long before now.  This recipe is very simple and elegant.  I added a few chocolate shavings on top. 

I think it's essential to have a large stand mixer (I use a Kitchenaid) as you MUST beat on high speed for at least 5 minutes after the addition of each egg.  I can't imagine doing this with a hand mixer.  

I also chose to cream the butter & sugar for 10 minutes prior to the addition of the eggs.  Using baker's sugar (easy to find in your grocery store) is also a help as it is more fine than regular sugar.  After adding the final egg I continued at high speed for another 10 minutes.  The filling was light and fluffy and absolutely delicious.  My husband licked the bowl.  It also set up very quickly and I was able to serve it within an hour.  

I'll be making this one again...soon!

This is an incredibly smooth and rich dessert--sinfully delicious. I started with room-temperature butter and creamed in ultra-fine baker's sugar for 5 minutes. Using egg beaters instead of eggs makes this a safer dessert because they are pasteurized. After beating 5 full minutes after each egg addition, I threw the filling in the freezer for 15 minutes, and then whipped it up for 2-3 final minutes. It set perfectly. I'm not much of a whipped cream fanatic, but I found that it was the perfect addition to this dessert, not only because it was a nice decorative touch, but it also countered some of the sweetness. A dusting of chocolate shavings, and its official: my pie was a beautiful masterpiece!

I was not very impressed with this dessert.  I read all the reviews and knew I was going to be beating eggs forever, which I did...  (5-8 min. after each egg).  I thought it was going to be ok since it wasn't soupy like others described, but yet it wasn't exactly set either.  I chilled it for an hour then put the whole thing in the freezer because I still wasn't too sure if it was setting or not?  An hour later I put it back to the refrigerator until it was time to eat and it was like eating chocolate mouse.  My guests said it was good but for me it was just "ok".  Not too sweet and not too chocolately either and I had added 6-7 Tbsp. cocoa likes others had suggested.  It was definately an easy dessert to prepare except the 30 minutes spent just beating eggs. The other dessert I made was "Better than sex cake" which took a lot less time to prepare and was so much more delightful and satisfying.  My vote is for the "other" dessert... pass on this hit or miss option.

Definitely easy to make.
Increased cocoa powder to 8 TB and dusted cocoa powder over the top and it was beautiful. 
It was too sweat for me though. I felt like I was eating a pie fully filled with chocolate icing. Will reduce amount of sugar if 
I have a chance to make it again.

Everyone had a hard time believing that I made this pie! It was so much like the Village Inn pie that my family always ordered for the holidays. I even added the perfect little chocolate curls on the top :)

It tasted great, but it never set. I'm guessing that I did something wrong so I'll try making this again.

WOW words do not do this pie justice.  I used a  9 inchdeep dish pie crust and 1.5-ed the ingredients.  I used the Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa.  I had no problem with the pie "setting". I creamed COLD butter and sugar for 10 minutes and anoter 5 minutes after each egg addition with my Kitchen Aid stand mixer. I topped the pie with fresh whipped Whipped Cream and Chocolate shavings and curls.  Next time I will use a graham cracker crust.

I read the reviews before attempting this and knew it involved a LOT of beating. I followed all of the suggestions (beat a lot and use extra cocoa powder) except that I didn't have baker's sugar, so I used regular cane sugar. 

The taste is to die for. It's so rich. I had no problem with it setting, but it is grainy! I'm a little upset that it isn't smoother, but I still think it'll be a hit. Next time I attempt this, I might pre-plan and get some baker's sugar. I'm sure that makes a difference considering how much I beat it.

As written, the pie is too rich for my tastes.  I have a very similar recipe which uses 2 squares unsweetened baking chocolate for 1/2 recipe. Directions are the same except after beating in the eggs, fold in 8 oz light whipped topping. So it is 1 stick butter, 3/4 c sugar, 2 melted sq. unsweetened chocolate, 2 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, and 8 oz light cool whip or other brand topping.  This makes my family's all time favorite pie.... the topping lightens it enough that it is not too rich.  This was the first time I tried a recipe with no topping, and using cocoa, and I will go back to my tried and true version.  Sorry.  Flavor is delicious, but we could only eat a few bites.

I've made this a few times and it really is a good recipe, but I'm giving it 4 stars because of one exception - too many eggs! The first time I made it, everything was going great until I added the fourth egg and then the whole thing turned to soup and wouldn't get fluffy again despite nearly 1/2 an hour of beating. My fix turned out to be increasing everything else by half to get it back to it's intended consistency. Now, whenever I make this pie I use my own measurements (1 and 1/2 cups butter, 2 and 1/4 cups sugar, 3/4 cup of cocoa and 3 tsp of vanilla with the 4 eggs) and it comes out rich and perfect with a great chocolate flavor. I pile the whole fluffy mixture high into my own 9" pie crust and top it with fresh whipped cream, chocolate curls and a slight dusting of cocoa powder, and it's always gone within a few minutes.
Thanks!

If your a chocolate LOVER, this is prob not going to be rich enough for you. It is quite light... and fluffy, It is pretty sweet, tastes.. okay? But If your looking for something rich & think.. not for you! To me, It tasted like chocolate coolwhip in a pie crust, but If your the person who likes lighter chocolate & deserts... GO FOR IT, you will love it!

Mmmmm! I wanted a chocolate silk pie that used cocoa powder. I upped the cocoa to 6 tbsp, but kept the rest of the recipe the same. I beat each egg on high for a few minutes, and this set up quite nicely. I used normal white sugar and had no problem with graininess.This was my first time making a chocolate pie of any type, and it came out perfectly! Oh, I also shredded some white and semisweet baker's chocolate on top before decorating with whipped cream and strawberries... mmmmmm!

This is a very good pie. I usually use 8 tablespoons of cocoa powder. And you can mix and match extracts. I made a peppermint french silk pie for christmas. It can tend to get grainy, depending on how you beat in the eggs. Though I haven't figured out what the best way to do that is yet.

yummy! I had never made french silk before.  I also didn't know that it had raw egg; i am not big on that idea so this is what i did instead.  In a double boiler combine eggs (as other suggested three) and suger whisk until sugar is disolved and heat for approx. 5 min. whis super well by hand until light and fluffy. alow to cool and ribbin into your butter and cocoa about 1/3 at a time.  Chill.

I am more a cook than a baker but I have made this numerous times and it gets better each time!  Beating is the key to success.  I only have a hand mixer so I used that on high for about 5 minutes for creaming butter and sugar and 5 minutes after each egg.  I don't know if there is a finer white sugar than just plain sugar, but if there is that would prbably be ideal.  Even after my arm fell off from mixing this there was a little bit of a grit from the sugar.  Serve it with some whipped cream and some chocolate curls - better than Bakers Square!

Have made this recipe for the holidays for the last couple of years and have added the extra cocoa; however, you cannot use a hand mixer to make this, you have to have a Kitchen-Aid or other high powered mixer in order to avoid the grainy texture.

This pie was VERY grainy because of the sugar.  I will not make this again.  You have to mix it a lot, but if you mix it too much it turns to liquid.

My first try at a French Silk pie and it turned out wonderful.  I read the reviews and increased the cocoa to 8 Tbsp which was just right for us.  I had no trouble getting it to set up.  I did have to beat it a long time to get the sugar to incorporate.  It was well worth the time.

This pie is GREAT!!! Very smooth, just chocolaty enough, just sweet enough. I didn't have ANY trouble getting it to set. It was perfectly fluffy and smooth. I can't have sugar or gluten, so I made a crust out of soy flour and almonds and used Splenda for baking instead of sugar. It turned out wonderfully. I highly recommend this recipe!

Made for Easter.  Rave reviews!  I followed the other suggestions and used 4 Eggbeaters, the baker's sugar and upped the cocoa to 7 Tbsp.  Also whipped after each egg for 6 minutes, and kept egg beaters in refrig. between beatings.  Between the 3rd and 4th egg was a bit soupy, so put in freezer for 10 minutes, whipped another 5, and turned out per-fect!  Served with Chocolate syrup drizzled on plate, and whip cream on top.  Wonderfully simple, but "showy".

This pie is sooo decadent, my family insists I make it every holiday.  Prepare it a day in advance to get the richest flavor and texture.

This is a favorite with my family!  They love it.  The first time I made this pie, I used regular sugar.  It is a whole different pie with the bakers sugar--much better.  You have to have patience to beat each egg in, it's worth the time spent.  (I even used a hand mixer)  I have found that this pie freezes well.  This was good at Christmas time, I made several in one day and froze them to take to later gatherings.

Excellent!  I accidentally used semisweet chocolate, but cut the sugar to 1/4 cup.  The consistency was perfect right off the bat and just got better with the five minute beatings.  I used 3 oz of chocolate, 3 eggs, and 3/4 c. butter since I had a 9 inch deep dish pie shell.  I should have doubled the recipe.  The only reason I can see that some didn't come out right was either the chocolate wasn't completely cooled, or they didn't follow the 5 minute between egg rule.  I finished with whipped, sweetened bakers cream and grated chocolate on top.  Everyone loved it.  Thank you!

I made this pie using Splenda, EggBeaters, and a reduced fat graham cracker crust.  I used real butter.  The pie turned out very thick and creamy, which was wonderful.  Unfortunately, it had a strong butter taste to it, even though I had taken JOSIE's suggestion and increased the cocoa by about 1.5 tbsp.  
I can see excellent potential in this pie though, and will definitely make it again, but reduce the butter to just 1/2 cup.  I can't wait to taste the next one!!

Remember to beat and beat and beat for best

I used unsweetened chocolate squares, melted.  A stand mixer helps, because of the long beating time.  I remember my mother making this recipe when I was young, so was delighted to re-discover it.  Actually serves 12, because a thin slice is all you need of this rich pie--unless you are a chocoholic like me :)

My husband - and who am I kidding? Me! - love French Silk pie, but I wanted a recipe that calls for cocoa. This fit the bill. First, I used pasteurized eggs, just for safety's sake. I liked that I didn't have to warm them to room temperature.  I also used 1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract,  plus a couple teaspoons extra cocoa (Did I mention my husband loves chocolate?). I have a KitchenAid so used the paddle to cream the butter, then used Baker's Sugar, which I added slowly to cream well with the butter, then creamed in the cocoa before adding the extracts. Then I switched to the whisk attachment and added one egg at a time, whipping well and scraping down the sides of the bowl before each addition of an egg. The result was a creamy, chocolatey dream. Right now our pie is cooling in the refrigerator, but I'm pretty positive it's going to be delicious once cooled and served with whipped cream because my husband liked the taste and texture as he "cleaned" the beaters and bowl. It's so nice to have a helper in the kitchen, I think! I write this now because the filling seemed plenty firm as I put it in the prepared crust. If the finished pie isn't chocolate-forward enough, I know it's an easy fix to add more cocoa. Thanks, and happy baking!

So I made it by hand, like arm and whisk, and had absolutely no grainy issues like many talked about (I did however have an incredibly toned/sore arm afterwards). Regardless, really simple recipe, looks and tastes great. I do agree with others that the amount of cocoa powder should be upped (I used 6 tablespoons myself)

I have made many French silk pies. This was my first with cocoa powder. It turned out perfectly.  I used an electric hand mixer - yes, it is possible to make a perfect french silk pie without a stand mixer. I mixed room temp butter and sugar for 2 mins. Added vanilla and cocoa - 6 Tbs, based on other reviews, and mixed for 2 mins. I mixed for 5 minutes after each egg.  After the second egg, the filling was turning lighter and starting to look silky. After the 4th egg, the filling was smooth and shiny, and a bit softer than after the 3rd egg. I think if I had mixed longer, the filling would start to get runny. It heats up during the mixing process - not sure how it would set up with extra long mixing time. I'm not interested in experimenting, because 5 minutes for each egg works great for me. I used regular sugar. It was the cocoa power, not the sugar, that made my filling grainy at first. Smoothed out nicely with the eggs. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I use evaporated cane sugar for everything and it is a wee bit grainy. To get around the grainy thing, I toss th sugar in the food processor for a whirl or 5 and that takes care of that!
I also doubled the amount of cocoa powder for this wonderful pie.  I totally disagree with the reviewer that claims this pie is not for chocolate lovers as it turns out smooth,,thick and tasty! Just what this chocolate fiend needs!

This recipe came together perfectly. I had no problems with the pie filling coming together as it should. Good texture but EXTREMELY sweet!
I will try this again with at least half the amount of sugar. :)

Super easy, and delicious! And I consider myself pretty picky about desserts like chocolate pie!   I used my kitchen mixer and beat the eggs on high speed (not by hand).  I didn't have any problems with the consistency.  It worked out perfectly for me!  (Butter was at room temp and eggs were right out of the fridge).   I served this at Thanksgiving dinner, with high expectations from everyone.  It did not disappoint!  In fact, two of my "foodie" uncles assumed we bought it from the local bakery!   I've added this to my book of tried and true, all-time-favorite recipes.

Made it for my employees for one of their birthdays and it was a big hit.  I made two pies and one came out a lot smoother than the other- I think it was because I beat the ingredients longer in between adding eggs.

i like this one.... i let the butter soften but not get liquidy and i used cold eggs adding one every 5 min. while beating. I reduced sugar by 1/4 c    and added 2  tbps more cocoa.   very nice- and easy.

Yummm!  I just made this with the following modifications to make (sugar free) Mint French silk pie :  I simply subbed the sugar for Splenda, and subbed the vanilla for mint extract.  Based on other reviewers recommendations I doubled the cocoa powder.  Also possibly due to using Splenda there was no need to beat for 5 minutes after each egg - I beat for no more than 2 minutes.  Turned out perfectly, smooth, fluffy, and delicious!  Thanks!  
additional note - used this with "Graham Cracker Crust I" from this site (also made w/Splenda) and simply put the crust in the bottom of a 8x8 pan for more like a bar - very easy!

this tasted good, but it was a bit grainy so maybe i just didn't mix it long enough? also, no one could eat more than a sliver at a time because it was so rich. if i make it again, it will be for a party so it doesn't go to waste in my fridge like it did this time :(

The taste was comparable to bakers Square cakes. I had some trouble with the sugar granuales not disolving (i used plain white sugar) but the longer it sat the better it was. By the time I served you could not take each granuale. I will make this over and over. I topped with just cool whip and then grated a hershey bar over the top with my cheese grater. Looked very nice and tasted even better!

I've made this twice with different crusts.  Be sure the crusts are cold before pouring chocolate in.  And chill before eating for the best set.
This is rich and WONDERFUL.

Update:  Tried adding 1 cup malt powder to the butter, sugar, cocoa mix before adding eggs....Yummy malted milk french silk!  Make sure you blend in the eggs for at least a few minutes with the wire wisk attachment on a stand mixer or a hand mixer on HIGH. Makes it smooth as silk and no need for fine or powdered sugar.  I used the paddle attachment the first time and it was soupy.  Doubled the chocolate, cut out 1/2 cup sugar-the pie flavor is fantastic and still  sweet.

This recipe was pretty good...I used powdered sugar instead of granulated, and a few extra spoons of cocoa. I'm not sure that I liked the flavor maybe due to the cocoa powder? It seems that most chocolate silk pies use melted chocolate squares instead. I think if I make this pie again I will try using squares. But, it was okay. Better after a full day in the fridge. Thanks for the recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years now... but recently moved, and lost my recipe card! I came across this on a search... thankfully!
The only thing I do differently, however, is that I use egg beaters. I have a hangup about eating raw eggs... and can't always find pasturized... so the eggbeaters work well as a substitute.

This was pretty good. Next time I will use about 1 cup of sugar as it was too sweet for me. The trick I find, as I kept tasting it, is to just keep blending it for as long as possible. It will turn out really creamy, I  promise!I will make this again as my husband devoured it!

Yummy Yummy!  Except I used a chocolate premade crust. Thye first time that I made it though, I didn't whip it long enough and it was runny.  BUT we froze it and it was a VERY rich, yummy desert pie.

My first French silk pie... to make OR eat!  It turned out very nice.  I took the advice of another reviewer about not overblending the butter and sugar.  It works just fine to use a hand mixer, and the filling set up just fine without any chilling.  The longer you mix the eggs, the airier the pie will be, so if you want a nice, dense pie, just mix them until they are fully incorporated.  Overall... very tasty!

This recipe did not work for me the first time.  I tried to hand whisk it and the result was chocolate soup.  I tried again with a blender and the difference was huge.  Not only did it work, but I had enough filling for 2 pies!  I blended 5 minutes per egg and used regular sugar as the stores no longer carry baker's sugar where I live.  End result was that my boyfriend just loved it.  Said it was just like grandma's.  Thanks.

This pie is delicious and easy to make. I used my Kitchenaid to mix each egg for five minutes as recommended in the reviews. I think it would be aweful to do it by hand and I wouldn't have attempted it. I used the superfine sugar and only used the white of the the last egg since I had a good consistancy and I was afraid of messing it up. It set pretty quickly and was creamy and smooth. I shaved milk chocolate curls on top and it was beautiful.

Great Pie! All that was heard in my kitchen between bites was "mmmm...good pie" I made it for a friend's birthday so to dress it up I piped cool whip on top and topped that off with shavings of chocolate (a chocolate bar and potato peeler worked well for the chocolate curls) Next time I will whip the ingredients a little longer or get bakers sugar as was suggested by someone else...it was a little gritty but still rich, creamy and delicious.

This is one of my favorite chocolate pie recipes.  I've made this twice using the exact amount of cocoa powder and the second time I upped it to about 6 or 7 Tbls.  I like it better with the extra cocoa powder...but I'm a chocolate lover.  Definitely beat each egg for at least 3 minutes if not more.  I've done both and it's come out perfect each time.  This is a gem Katie!

Take note! If you're mixing and mixing and your mix is still a bit soupy, put the bowl in the freezer for 10-15 minutes. Then take it out and start mixing again, and it will firm up fast! I found this out by accident and it saved the day. The pie was smooth and rich, a hit for any french silk fan!

It needs to be noted that each addtion of an egg needs to whipped, and whipped and whipped some more.  Basicallly you can't whip it enough.  If you don't take enough time to care for that the pie can sort of melt.  It ends up being so smooth, definately deserving of the title "French Silk".

This recipe is exactly what I've been looking for.  It tastes DIVINE!  I couldn't get it to set up, so mine turned out kind of runny.  I ended up adding whipping cream (already whipped to soft peaks) and it made it not so runny, but then it started to look like it was curdling (I guess the whipping cream was trying to turn to butter and maybe I should have added the whipping cream directly from the carton to the filling and it would have done better).  I remember making this approximate recipe before and I think that you have to beat the mixture for 5 minutes on high speed each time that you add a egg and that will allow it to set up appropriately (but don't be mad at me if that doesn't work).  Either way, mine this time did not turn out to look very good, but it is LUSCIOUS.  p.s. (the whipping cream ((I only used the small carton size)) did not change the taste of the French silk filling whatsoever when I added it)  I was really afraid it would, but it didn't.

I had a problem with this receipe, no matter what I tried I could not get the filling to set up properly.  Instead of a pie I ended up with pie soup.   I may have used substandard chocalate as this is not the first time or recipe this has happened with.  If you have the same problem try using a name brand chocalate or cocoa powder.

I did not make any changes and the recipe turned out silky and perfect.  I just made sure to scrape the bowl between the addition of each egg, so that everything was incorporated really well.  I think that helped with the graininess people are talking about as well.  Mine was not grainy after leaving it "set" in the refrigerator for an hour or two.

This pie was to die for!  It is so easy and so delicious!  I was worried about it being gritty as some of the reviewers said so I 'whirled' the sugar around in my Ninja first. When I licked the beaters it was gritty but after chilling a couple hours there was no more grittiness to it, all the sugar had dissolved and it was smooth as silk.  I did use 6 tablespoons of cocoa and thought it perfect.  I don't worry about raw eggs because I raise my own chickens and I know their eggs are clean.  I will make it again and again but will try a graham cracker or Oreo crust next time.  Yum!

This is a good chocolate pie. I did use 8Tbs cocoa powder, and because I was a bit short on butter I used about 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter and beat that into the mixture. It added a nice depth of flavor without overpowering the chocolate. I did notice the texture was gritty as other reviewers have said, but I think next time I will use bakers sugar as suggested which should help with texture.

I had read all the reviews and was nervous at first about the eggs not wanting to cooperate, and the filling being gritty. However, none of that happened! It was smooth and silky and was gobbled up by everyone within minutes. The only thing I changed in the recipe was the amount of cocoa. I didn't want the filling to be teeth-meltingly sweet, so I increased the cocoa powder up to 6 tablespoons. Otherwise, everything was perfect. What I may suggest to those having a problem, is to be sure that your butter is at room temperature. That may solve the egg problem. Anyhow, thanks for the recipe!!

This french silk pie is absolutely divine. I have been using this recipe for years and I haven't had any issues with regular sugar making the pie grainy. It may be grainy initially, but that will go away. This is always a hit everywhere I take it. Within minutes it's literally devoured. :) If you need a quick, delicious pie for any function... this is it! And, for those who don't like sweet desserts... even they love a small piece of this pie! :) Happy Making!

Loved it! I made a second one substituted with 1/4 tsp vanilla extract and 1/4 vanilla extract and it turned out fantastic!

As written, this is a solid 4-star recipe. It makes more than enough filling for a 9-inch pie if you follow the instructions (i.e. throughly cream the butter & sugar, then beat well between each egg addition). To bring it up to a 5-star chocolate lover's recipe, I added 4 more tablespoons of Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa.

I have made this several times & I still love it! I used 8 Tbsp of cocoa powder instead of 4. It's so yummy! I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

I took the advice of others on here and increased the cocoa to 6tbs but I think 7-8 would have made it even better! I also increased the vanilla to 1 full tbs. I was worried at first that the sugar was going to remain grainy but once you started adding the eggs, the graininess disappeared and you were left with a delicious smooth texture!  I snuck a taste before refrigerating and I can't wait to try it with the coolwhip on top!!

I used the French Silk Choc. pie recipe from this site & it was perfect!  However, this time I did not have the Baker's Chocolate, so I tried this one.  Read reviews before beginning.  Creamed butter & sugar only slightly with whisk & added other ingredients..mixed until blended.  Then, after the addition of each egg, breat with mixer for 8min.  I am VERY disappointed.  It did not set up like the other recipe I used last time.  The taste is good (added the extra, recommended cocoa), but it is flat.  Not rich & creamy.  Use the other recipe.  Don't waste your time.

I'm going to give this recipe 1 star as written. I made it this evening and it was entirely too sweet and was lacking in chocolate flavor. I would probably double the cocoa powder next time and cut the sugar in half. Otherwise, it was a beautiful pie and it set up nicely.

I followed the instructions, and it turned out to be a soupy mess.  It never set, even after being in the freezer for two hours. I eventually just served as was, and it was way too rich. None of my five dinner guests finished a whole slop. Will definitely not be trying this recipe again.

Really easy!  I ended up using 8 T. of cocoa powder, which made it very chocolaty and not too sweet.  I added the eggs whole, not split into yolks and whites.

I loved the outcome, but getting there was a challenge.  After adding each egg, I beat on high for 4-5 minutes and the end result was soup city and my high-powered food processor-cum-stand mixer was nearly overheated.  So, I put it in the freezer for 20 minutes and, as others have said, it shaped right up in a couple of minutes.  Silky texture, even w/regular sugar.  A big hit!

LOVE this pie...It's a big hit no matter where I take it.  And hey, don't sweat the raw egg thing...I use egg beaters instead of raw eggs and it always turns out just fine...BUT, be sure to use real butter and not those soft, spreadable margarine substitutes or the pie will never set up and will be very soupy.  As far as the "grainy" thing, as long as you beat the filling long enough per each egg/egg beater serving, it will be fine-- silky and smooth.  Happy Baking!

This is my dads favorite pie. I make it strictly for him. Very easy and quick to make. I do decrease the amount of sugar and up the cocoa powder, per other comments. I find it is better when let chill for at least 3 hrs.

Unfortunately, this recipe didn't turn out right at all.  I think it was probably my fault due to one of the substitutions I made, so I'm giving the recipe a good rating.  I used egg substitute instead of eggs and a 65% vegetable oil spread instead of butter.  The pie wasn't runny, but the texture was horrible and we had to throw it out.  (It still tasted good.)  I don't think I'll try making this again because of the huge amount of time it requires just to beat in the eggs.

Just didn't do it for me. The first time I followed the instructions exact, it was too soupy.2nd time I used a few suggestion on what to do differently, soupy again. The the third time I changed things a bit to my specifications and I manage to get a somewhat fluffy pie, but my husband still said it wasn't thick enough.I felt like I was gonna blow out my mixer. It was a bit too rich, a bit more than I can stand and kids didn't wanna touch it.

This turned out amazing.  I have made it 3 times and only once was it a little bit "soupy".  I put it in the freezer and that seemed to do the trick.  I wonder if anyone has tried this with some peppermint extract and crushed candycanes on the top?  That would be a great Christmas pie.  I love this recipe. Thanks so much for posting it!

I found this dessert to be too sweet. I know...Desserts are supposed to be sweet, but sugar is supposed to compliment the taste, not over power it. I also thought it was too light and airy. I like the more dense and I hate to say this, but store bought version of this dessert. For the time and ok taste, I will not be making again.

Don't worry about the raw eggs - use pasteurized eggs instead - buy them in cartons at the store.  I used them and they were great!  The amount to use for each egg will be on carton.  FYI:  Raw eggs in any recipe should make us think twice before licking the beater or the bowl!  That is why slice and bake type cookies use pasteurized -- and that makes it okay to eat all that kind of raw dough you want!! YUM!

I made this pie for my husband who can't eat refined sugars or white flours. I made it using a shortbread crust (1lb butter, 2/3C fructose, 3 C WW flour) and using Splenda in the filling instead of sugar. I also used eggbeaters instead of normal eggs to make it "safe" to eat. We loved it. It was the smoothest, fluffiest french silk pie I have ever had. I am making another for Thanksgiving.

this was absolutely wonderful - everyone raved about it even though it ended up a little too soupy for me.

I DID whip it for 5 minutes after each egg and I ended up with it turning to soup after the third egg.  I will try it again.

Wonderfully rich and creamy -- the whole family loved it.  Next time, I will use the whisk attachment on my Kitchenaid at the end to fluff it up a bit.

This was delicious and easy to make! I used everyone's advice and let each egg beat for about 5 minutes in my mixer. I did end up with more than enough filling for my pie crust, so I made a couple french silk pie puddings (why mess with a crust when it's the filling you want! HaHa!) I plan on making it a lot for family too since it passed the husband taste test.

I am not sure why anyone's would turn out soupy unless they melted their butter .  It was nice and stiff and tastes fantastic!!! I've already made 3 of them today for friends.  Thanks for a super easy recipe.  I also beat the ingredients for a long time.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving, and found it incredibly easy, fast and delicious.  I followed the recipe as stated, and it came out just perfect.  I served it with whipped cream and it was light, fluffy and wonderful.

i used the choc. instead of cocoa as advised and it was still runny. maybe i did something wrong.  :( oh well, it did taste good though.
