The cream taste similar to the inside of a cannolli but not as heavy. I didn't want to open a can of non-fat evaporated milk for just a tablespoon and used regular milk with no problems. Using the marsala wine gave it a taste like zabayon. I would think a dash of vanilla would be good if you don't have or want to use marsala wine. This cream isn't smooth like whipped cream and never will be but is still very very good. I liked it so much I had it with a berry topping and not berries with it topping them.

This came out a little too thick and too bland for me. I tripled the sugar and wine and was happy with how it came out. I made it with raspberries and blueberries (no good strawberries were available), but I use strawberries in the future. The blueberries weren't sweet enough to taste right with the cream.

I love fresh berries and "cream", meaning "whipped cream" so I thought I'd give this a try. And while the concept is good, I found I do like things a little sweeter and ended up folding in some homemade "whipped cream" into the mixture.

AMAZING!!!!  This was SO yummy!  I put this on top of many other desserts, and it works so well!  The only changes I make are that I add whipped cream to it and I add a little vanilla.  The vanilla makes such a big difference.  DELICIOUS!!

Toasted some macadamia nuts because the store didn't have hazelnuts, otherwise, followed the recipe.  This was OK, but I wasn't crazy about the ricotta cream.  Even after beating with a mixer, the texture was "grainy" for a lack of a better word, not creamy.

This was a nice new recipe (a "grown-up" treat), but since I have a big sweet tooth, I think I would prefer whipping cream to ricotta.  I used raspberries instead of blueberries.

I wasn't very thrilled with this recipe.  The ricotta flavor was strong even though I didn't use a full cup.  I had to use Sherry instead of Marsala b/c that's all I had, so that may have had something to do with it.  It was kind of thick and needed to be sweeter.

Or use 3/4 lb. fresh ricotta
1/4 cup heavy cream and 1 tsp. vanilla and whip about 1.5 mins.  Spread on a platter and top with the fruit.  Drizzle with honey and a sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper and garnish with mint.

It tastes very good, but the texture was more of a dressing than a cream

Not bad at all! I used vanilla sugar instead of the wine. A tasty treat!
