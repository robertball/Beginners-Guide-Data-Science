I agree with the title of this recipe, they turned out great!  I only changed one thing, I used half granulated white sugar, and half brown sugar...I also used a ice cream cookie scoop to form nice big, bakery style cookies!

Pretty good but a more cakey texture than we like.  They also tend to squish and stick together when put in cookie jar.

Smooth texture and a cloying mouthfeel, the flour seemed to bury the flavor and texture of the oatmeal and raisins. With a singular spice, the flavor was very monothematic. I thought they definitely needed more flavor complexity and less flour.

Bland.  Tastes more of flour than oatmeal or raisins.

They tasted just fine but I wasn't a huge fan of this recipe. They seemed almost like scones. Add some lemon curd and you got breakfast!

The dough was yummy, I did not have a cookie yet but my husband did & he said it was a very good cookie. He did say they were crunchy & I happen to like my cookies on the softer side. I had to alter a few things in the recipe so all in all, that's why I gave this recipe an average review.

They were okay, but that's about it.  They were dense and bland.  I used a cookie scoop and they stayed in the balled shape of the scoop, never flattened out, which would be fine, if I weren't a professional and looks didn't mean anything to me.  But on top of that, they had almost no flavor.  Definitely not something I'd add to my recipe book.

I liked this recipe however, with the sugar I did half brown sugar and half reg. sugar. I also used 1 cup of raisins and soaked them in 1cup water and 1tsp vanilla while i was mixing all ingredients. I also added more cinnamon. When putting them on the baking sheet I rolled a ball of dough in my hand than flatten it in my hand to make larger cookies.(kinda the size of subway cookies)

These were tasty cookies but mine came out more as cookie-cakey-scones.  Not a bad thing - but not quite what i was expecting.  Likely due to 'operator error' on my part. But my British friends loved them! :)
