We love this recipe.  You can use different spices in the dressing if you like.  It is a nice light meal.

It was very good but since I didn't mix the salad, chicken, and dressing in a big bowl, it got very, very vinegary

This was yummy, but i have had better. My husband loved it though. i added some mccomick seasoning, the new roasted garlic and red bell pepper, that added some flavor, but it was good. thank you.

This is by far the best salad I've ever eaten!  Wow!  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a semi-healthy chichen salad.

I am a really big fan of tangy dressings and this was a huge hit with me. I also whisked in a bit of crumbled gorgonzola cheese. Delicious!
