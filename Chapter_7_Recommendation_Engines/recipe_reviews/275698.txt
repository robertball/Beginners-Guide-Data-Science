I had to start again with a different recipe. The brown sugar completely ruined the texture and made it as dense as a brick. I whipped the brown sugar and butter until it was as light as possible but the use of only brown sugar is definitely to blame. The basic ermine frosting recipe is fine though, classic ratios!
