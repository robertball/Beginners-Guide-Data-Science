I've never reviewed a recipe although I have used and enjoyed many from this site. I felt compelled to make an exception for this one because it had so few reviews. This is just awesome and much better than store bought sauce. I only had plain chili sauce so I added a smidge of garlic powder. It had just the right amount of kick for me but was to hot for my mother (but she thinks mild salsa is a bit too hot!). You won't be disappointed with this one!

Forgot to pick up cocktail sauce for a party, so in a panic found this recipe.  It's just as good if not better than the jar.
Only thing I changed after tasting it, was to add a sprinkle of garlic powder.
Also I didn't have chili sauce so I just added some chili powder to the catsup and tasted great.

Nice and hot!  I didn't have chili-garlic sauce, so I just added some minced garlic.  Perfect for shrimp!

The perfect shrimp cocktail! Way better than the jar. I also didn't have the chili-garlic sauce so I just added a clove of garlic. Really good... I won't be buying my shrimp cocktail sauce anymore!

Delicious!  Taste & texture just like in the restaurant.  For the chile-garlic sauce, I used LaChoy Ginger Garlic paste (because it was what I had on hand) & it was perfect!  I think it gave it a very subtle exotic flare.  My husband said "this is awesome!" and that's high praise for him.  I made this to go along with perch, fresh from the Adirondacks.  So, I think this would nicely accompany any fish.  It was also great for dipping french fries in.  Definitely won't ever buy prepared again!

Fantastic! We are Americans living in the UK for the next year and they use mayo in EVERYTHING including their shrimp sauce.... When we couldn't find red shrimp sauce anywhere, I decided to make it myself. My husband raves about it and says when we return to the states we will never resort to store bought sauce again. Super easy and very tasty! Added some tabasco since we like the flavor in our shrimp sauce and used to add it back home, but aside from that followed recipe exactly.

I use a simular recipe without the ketchup. One bottle of chili sauce, lemon juice, garlic powder, and horseradish to taste. Much better than ketchup.

Just made this today and it's as good as any restaurant sauce I've had.  I left out the hot sauce as the chili garlic sauce made it warm enough.

Just so, so.  Really, really spicy and I didn't even use the hot sauce, just the chili garlic sauce recommended.  The spices overwhelmed the flavor of the horseradish which is the best part of cocktail sauce.

This is GREAT!   I made it as written except for the hot sauce - I was out of that, of all things!   Anyway it was fantastic without it, but plan on adding some next time!  When I think of what I would pay for my favorite brand of store bought spicy-cocktail sauce I shudder!   This is soooo good, so fast and cheap to make to boot!   Thanks, Tsubaki!

Yikes! This is hot and good. Depending on the type of chili-garlic sauce you have, you may need to tone it down a little. Mine is killer hot, so my cocktail sauce was a serious opponent - but amazingly good. Thanks for the recipe!

Had everything except the horseradish - so I used a 'cranberry wasabi' sauce I had in the cupboard. WOW THIS WAS GOOD! I will try the exact recipe at some point, but it might be more fun to keep experimenting!

The men in the house are the seafood eaters and enjoyed this sauce with their grilled shrimp.  Next time I will add a few more dashes of hot sauce.*

This is an Amazing Cocktail Sauce! As an American living in Brazil, Cocktail Sauce simply does not exist here.... that I know of.. so I made my own...Yeah! I made this recipe exactly the same except I used a pure Chile Sauce (without garlic), omitted the hot sauce, and used lime instead of lemon... It was perfect.

Excellent. I don't measure and probably was a bit light on the horseradish. I did not add hot sauce as my chile sauce was homemade and quite spicy already.

Siracha is a hot sauce so I added to taste, not the whole 2 tbsp. Otherwise this was delicious.

Now THIS is how I like cocktail sauce!  It's not too sweet and has a nice kick.  Most recipes seem to add a bunch of sugar, but ketchup is already plenty sweet enough for me.  My horseradish was not quite sharp enough (different brands are different), I should have added another TBS.  Next time I'll double check that.  No need to try another recipe, this is it for me!

Awesome! There's no reason to ever buy premade cocktail sauce again after trying this recipe :o) I didn't have the garlic hot sauce so I used regular hot sauce and added minced garlic. I also added worcestershire sauce since I saw that in another recipe and we love it! Even my hubby who hates horseradish enjoyed this recipe.

This is a great cocktail sauce recipe. A versatile staple for me. I prefer to double the radish and add a dash of Worcestershire. Salt & Pepper to taste, 
Super!

Yum love spicy foods so loved this. I had made this to use inside of a shrimp pasta salad recipe, but my shrimp were too dirty to use so I got more and used it for shrimp cocktail!! I won't use store bought, I will always use this!!

It's true, it is amazing.  I didn't have any chili sauce so I substituted chili powder.  Everyone loved it.  Thank you.

My version of this recipe was excellent!! I used 1 tbl of real chili garlic sauce, 2 tbl of horseradish and didn't add any extra hot sauce.

VERY good cocktail sauce, better than a lot of the jarred ones at the store wiuth a handful of tweaks.  I like mine slightly more mild than this (it is VERY spicy as made) so I upped the ketchup slightly, cut the horseradish to 1 tsp., cut the Sriracha just slightly and used a dash of African hot sauce.  PHENOMENAL!

I like it as it doesn't make gobs since I serve shrimp for two usually.  I can't afford to serve it a larger party.  I did add to it.  I added about a Tbsp off Worchestershire sauce and another Tbsp or so of rice vinegar.  Any vinegar you feel resonates with you would be fine.  I just saw it while I reached for the Worchestershire sauce and it called out to me saying, I can round these flavors out for you.  And it did.  Oh ,I used sriracha sauce, garlic paste, and sweet hot chili sauce.   This isn't exactly a hard science.  I don't ever just follow recipes blindly anymore.  I ask myself if the spice it calls for is the spice that I am hungry for and maybe what spice I am wanting there instead.  You can use soy or nut milk in place of dairy usually and if you find a vegan recipe that sounds great but you want milk in it, go for it.  Things like that don't matter.  I appreciate having this recipe as my master recipe for now what is my own recipe.  Thank you and Shalom.

Loved the sauce and so quick and easy. I didn’t add the last hot sauce and it was plenty spicy enough. A good sinus cleaner without it.

This combination makes a delicious cocktail sauce. Using what I had, exact measuring was not used. I say, do not go lightly on the Sriracha sauce. When testing for anything spicy here's a hint. Never put the item (including jalapenos) on the tip of your tongue, put it back farther and you'll get the flavor but not the burn. Mix it up, let it sit this sauce will get hotter. It's a winner!

The only thing I changed in this recipe is leaving out the last hot sauce ingredient. I felt that the Sriracha sauce would be hot enough, and I was right for my liking. I used this sauce over fresh crab and it was delicious!!

This was a really good recipe. Husband has raved about it and had to have shrimp again last nite so he could use it again!! Just a tad too spicy for me, but will definitely make again and again. Might cut back on the horseradish. Thanks!

Tried it, loved it!  We use it a lot with the addition of minced garlic.  You can change up the heat level by varying the hot sauce-we use tobasco and add chipotle for bbq shrimp.  Give it a try as it as the recipe doesn't make much.

I didn't use the chile-garlic sauce and only 5 drops of Tabasco (hot sauce)as I don't care for real spicy cocktail sauce as I was serving this with shrimp that had been cooked in old bay seasoning, which was already spicy.

I made this as written. It was okay for me. Something I might make now and then but I'm not a big fan.
