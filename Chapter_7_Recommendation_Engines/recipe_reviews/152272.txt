This is very good, my family loved it.  Traditionalists should be aware that it is not your standard "southern" cornbread...it is rich and a little sweet and almost cakelike rather than crumbly. I am sure I will make it again, it was such a hit, it is very moist and a 9X13 pan is a lot of cornbread so it would be great for a crowd.  Like another reviewer, I had to bake it another 15-20 minutes longer than called for.  30 minutes does not seem to be long enough for such a big pan and it was wet in the middle at 30 minutes.  It was perfect at 50 minutes but I would start watching it at 40 to be on the safe side.  I did not have any frozen corn but I had a can of creamed corn and I put that in, it worked great and gave some extra texture without having big kernals of corn.  I kept the rest of the recipe exactly as written. A winner.

I had good results when I cut the recipe in half, using 2 eggs and 1/2 cup milk. Cut all other ingredients exactly in half.  I made corn muffins using paper liners sprayed with cooking spray. Mix the wet ingredients, set aside.  Mix the dry ingredients.  Make a well, stir in wet ingredients along with corn.  Mix only until combined.  Over mixing will result in a crumbly muffin.  Bake at 350 for 15 minutes or until muffins are golden.  Let cool slightly before peeling off paper liner.

This is the best cornbread I've ever had. I decreased the milk by 1/4 cup and used creamed corn. It was moist and delicious. My 2 year old grandson and my husband have almost eaten the whole pan. I hope I have enough left for dressing. Awesome.

The cornbread was moist and delicious.  The family went back for seconds.  The only thing I found I would do the next time would be to thaw the corn before adding it to the batter.

The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly. Holy Moly yummy! For leftovers, cut into squares, freeze, and microwave for 30-45 sec per piece. Add more butter of course. Sooooo delicious.  The second time, I followed the modified version (1 cup milk + creamed corn)....amazing again.  The pieces are tall, thick, moist, cornmeal -buttery goodness. It IS the meal! This cornbread is better than some wedding cakes!  Ps.....For the reviewer who said it came out dry and crumbly...you did something wrong. I've made it twice. Easy recipe 
and perfect texture. I mixed with a handheld electric mixer (no idea if it matters) Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I followed another reviewer's suggestion of halving and making muffins, using 1/2 c milk, 2 eggs, and half of all other ingredients. I also replaced half of the sugar (1/4 c) with 1/4 c honey. Baked at 350 for ~15 mins. Yields 12 muffins when you fill the cups about halfway.

I don't know what happened!  Reading the reviews I thought for sure this would be it!  What a disappointment. First, I cut back the sugar to 3/4C..I'm glad I did, as it was STILL a bit too sweet for me. Also, it had an overly "butter" flavor.  Thats all I could taste, butter & sugar. Second, Mine crumbled away on me!  I had a hard time slicing this and keeping it into wedges.  It fell apart.  Will not make this again.

This is so moist! I followed the suggestion to add creamed corn instead of kernels - which was awesome. It did require another 20 minutes or so to cook through. I love this recipe. :-)

Finally, a cornbread that is moist and delicious!  I left out the corn, only because I have some picky eaters.  This is a keeper without a doubt!  Thanks for sharing your grandmother's recipe with us.

This recipe is almost identical to the only cornbread recipe I will use.  4 cups Bisquick, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup cornmeal, 2 teaspoons baking powder (mix together in bowl with spoon). In separate bowl beat together (with whisk) 3 eggs, 1 cube melted margarine & 2 cups of evaporated milk.  Add to dry ingredients and mix ONLY UNTIL moistened.  Pour into a 9 x 13 baking pan sprayed with cooking spray and bake in 350* preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes.  Very close to Marie Callendar's. Enjoy!!!!!  NOTE: Use a 12 oz. can of evaporated milk then enough regular milk to equal the 2 cups.  No need to open another can.  Also, I have never used corn kernels but I don't see why not.  Just make sure it is drained well as to not add additional moisture.

Delicious and moist!  I made it with a fairly spicy chili and I thought the sweetness of the bread was just right with the chili.

This was VERY good! I used sour milk instead of regular, and I did use the corn. My family raved about this. That was certainly a compliment since my hubby is a chef and was featured in a magazine for his own recipe of cornbread! Thank you for the awesome recipe!!

Liked the recipe ,but , I am not one to stick to a recipe so I did my southwest thing to it . Used cream style corn and added a small can of diced jalapenos 2 heaping Tblspn dry chopped onions , then I split the batter and poured it into two hot cast iron skillets with bacon grease in each . Corn bread was tall and the crust against pan was golden and crisp. ( Bacon Grease Rules)!!!!!!!!! JGT

WAYYYYYY too much sugar, WAAAAAAYYYYYYY too much butter...what are you doing people?  That is more of a corn cake than corn bread, and with so little cornmeal in it... needs a new name - Corny bread!    Take it easy on the sugar.  I made a allrecipes recipe of Sweet and Sour pork last week and we cut the sugar in half and left out the salt and it was terrific.

As others have said, this is almost sweet enough for a dessert. To take it that next step, add chocolate and other sweet toppings.

It tasted just like regular cornbread...I didn't get the 'cakey' cornbread I was looking for.

I was trying to find something similar to MariCallendar's cornbread which is basically just like a cake and oh so good.

I have made this several times as written. As others have noted 50 minutes in the oven is about right. Everyone who has tried this says that it is the best. Only person who wasn't thrilled with it was my wife. She likes the dried, crumbly cornbread (my words). I think that the next time I make this I will add some jalapenos to it. Thanks Maryanne for sharing this.

I love this recipe.  I have been making it for a while and it is always a hit at bake sales, pot lucks, and with family members.  I have made it both with and without the corn (I like it with, boyfriend prefers it without) and have noticed that without corn the 30 min baking time is perfect, whereas it might need an extra 15-20 if you add the corn kernals.  While I like it just as sweet as it is, I agree it could be considered more cakelike than traditional cornbread, but I bet you could cut back on the sugar and get something pretty close to tradition.  Will keep on making this!

I know that many people like a sweetened cornbread, but I felt this was really over the top on the sweetness end.  If I were to make it again, I would reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup or possibly even a bit less and I would go to, at max, 1/2 cup butter. I did not have frozen corn on hand, so I drained and rinsed a regular sized can of corn (I use the reduced salt type) and it was very good.

The taste of this cornbread was wonderful, with one modification. I used a scant 1/4 cup of sugar instead of the cup called for,  and that was perfect for us. The corn kernels were a lovely addition. The only issue I had with this cornbread was that it was quite crumbly. I might add a bit of buttermilk or sour cream next time to try to combat that issue. Perfect flavour served alongside black eyed pea gumbo for a hearty New Years Day dinner. Thanks!

I made this for chili night, plus took the extras into work the next day.  It was loved by all.  My only problem was that it didn't hold together the first night.  No problem because my family breaks their cornbread over their chili.

GREAT! Whole family loved it! Only change I made was to add a small can of Green Chili peppers (to add a little spice). Next time I might cut back on the sugar. This is now a household favorite.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was absolutely delicious! I served it with spicy chili and it was a huge hit with my family. It definitely needs an extra 20 minutes cooking time so plan on closer to 50 minutes. Great recipe!!!

My guests and I enjoyed this recipe. Unfortunately, its super moistness, cake-like texture, and great overall flavor did not compensate for the candy-sweetness. Next time I will reduce the sugar to half a cup.  Also, it bakes "pretty." lol

I think I may have whisked it a little too much as it had a very light consistency. I would prefer it a little more dense. Very easy to make and it tasted great. Try this, you won’t be sorry.

This is an awesome cornbread.  Light and airy texture.  The only thing I didn't care for was the whole kernels of corn in it.  Next time I make it, I think I will cut up the corn kernels a bit or even blend them a bit to get finer pieces.

I have used frozen corn, canned creamed corn, or omitted the corn too.  Either way, it is wonderful and I get raves about it every time I make it.  If I am feeding a crowd, I usually split between 2 pans.  Makes it a thinner bread but perfect size to put in a small bowl of chili.

This is a great recipe but not the typical cornbread most people are accustomed to.  It is very light, very tasty and almost like a cake.  I made only 1/2 recipe .   I used two eggs and flour in place of cornmeal, only  because I was out of it. I did not add any corn.   I baked it in an eight inch round pan for 30 minutes, which was perfect.  My whole family loved it so I will for sure make this again.

Sooooo GOOD!  Best cornbread ever. I added a little yogurt. Its so moist & cakelike. I halved the recipe & made 3 small loaves. They were baked in 22 mins. & I poured a little melted butter on top ,when they came out of the oven. One for use today & the others went into the freezer for another time.

My wife asked me to make cornbread "from the box" to have with the chili I made. The look of disappointment in her face was priceless when she found out I made this version. Then, she tried it and was overwhelmed by the awesome flavor and texture. It's my go-to cornbread recipe! I added a can of creamed corn and omitted 1/4 C of milk. Also, bake for 55 minutes to accommodate the extra moisture from the corn.
make sure to test with a toothpick because if its not done and you cut into it, you'll have a real mess on your hands.

I had to use flour instead of baking mix because I didn't have any at the time and I used canned corn instead of frozen. It was really moist and delicious. I will be making this again in the near future and will try to pick up some baking mix and frozen corn next time around! Thanks for sharing.

I too cut the recipe in half and used creamed corn. The smaller size in a 9x9 baking dish took 45 minutes. It was moist and sweet. My husband really liked it. I have been looking for a decent cornbread recipe for years. This is the first one my husband said he would eat again. Thank you for sharing! It went great with the chili we had for dinner. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow night!

This was good and had a perfect texture, but I could call it more of a sweet bread than actual cornbread. It had more of a cake-like texture, not a cornbread texture.  I halved the recipe and used 1/2 cup milk and 2 eggs as others suggested, the rest as written. Though tasty, not sure I'll make it again and it won't be my go to cornbread recipe. Not what I was looking for in a cornbread.

This is a very easy recipe for cornbread when you have not buttermilk. It is sweet and cake like but still fits the bill when cornbread is needed. My husband loves it with honey.

Hubby loves this recipe and brags to everyone about it! Our volunteer fire department requests this often on cold days.  I substitute the frozen corn with a can of Mexican corn to add a little something special to it!!  Of course, I love the recipe as well since I'm a Mary Anne as well!

Used 1/2 cup milk, 2 eggs, and 1/2 all other ingredients. It was very fluffy and moist, but I'm not sure about the flavor. Didn't really taste like cornbread, more like a fluffy sweet bread.

This was just ok for us. I like the idea of the baking mix being used, but I don't think it had nearly enough cornmeal, and it was very cakey. If I try it again, I think I'll up the cornmeal to a cup, and reduce the baking mix by half a cup. Thanks for the idea.

I really did like this recipe! It came out very light and airy. However I did put it in the convection oven at 3:25 degrees and it took more than 30 minutes still. However my box of Bisquick mix was only 20 ounces and I needed 24 ounces. My bread is still warm and falls  apart very easily but has a lovely flavor and texture. I also used skim milk as that is what I had on hand, and that may have been why as well. I am hoping when it is fully cooled it will not fall apart as easily.

I halved the recipe (and used a smaller baking pan), also omitted the frozen corn kernels.

It was WONDERFUL! Moist, sweet and now my boyfriends favorite!

This was very good! Not quite "corny" enough for me, as I like a bit crumblier of a texture, but it was delicious and I'd make it again. Very sweet and very moist.

Tried this recipe for fellowship hour after church today to go with the Ham Bone Soup I made.  Instead of the oil I added a 1/2 cups melted butter and frozen whole kernel corn, this recipe is definitely a keeper with my modifications...

Absolutely amazing cornbread! I make it exactly as stated, and it's a HUGE hit every time. Now, it is definitely sweeter and MUCH more moist than "traditional" cornbread, but soooo much better! I'm not much of a cook, but this recipe fooled our friends into thinking I know what I'm doing in a kitchen. :)

This is the first time I ever make cornbread, that my family ate!! I served to the grand kids and they loved it. I took a picture of it and posted it. I only used half of the ingredients and cooked it in 8 by 8. Thank you for posting oh I almost forgot I used a can of whole corn and drained it and it was perfect. It's a keeper!!

This was a hit even my wife's grandmother was going on and on about how moist and sweet it was!  Adding the corn to it makes it even better.

I followed this recipe exactly, using Jiffy baking mix.  My cornbread turned out delicious--moist and cake-like!  It did take 10 minutes longer in the oven than the recipe stated.  This is now my go-to cornbread recipe.

Great Cornbread, not "cakey" enough for me though. Still it was very much appreciated by the tribe (family).

I don't like cornbread but really liked this!  Maybe the texture was softer?  I will add this to my recipes that call for cornbread on the side!

I have been making this cornbread for a year now and my family absolutely loves it more then any other cornbread I have made.  It is also great in a stuffing recipe for the holidays. Only change is in a 13x9 pan it needs to be baked 45 minutes.

WOW!  This recipe is awesome!  Very good.  I only have a family of 5 so I cut the ingredients in 1/2 and poured the mix in a bread pan.  Came out perfect!  This is a keeper.

This is one of the best cornbread recipes I've found.  I stuck to the recipe and it turned out perfectly! I might try reducing the butter next time to make it a little healthier but I know I will make this over and over.

I made this cornbread as the foundation for my holiday stuffing.  I took my husband a taste and he told everyone it was the best cornbread I have ever made. We love cornbread and I've been making him cornbread for 36 years.  Thanks for a great recipe. Note...I had to cook this recipe a log longer than the instructions stated...about 15 or 20 minutes more.
