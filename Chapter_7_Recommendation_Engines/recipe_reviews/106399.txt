I thought that this was a refreshing treat to have on a hot summer day.  I was surprised how much flavor it had.  It was like a lemonade-styled refreshment.  I wouldn't serve it for dessert, however.

This is a really good recipe.  My entire family loved it.  In fact, it diappeared in one day.  It is so easy to make, I just learned from the first time I made it that you should not let it freeze all the way.  After about 1 to 1 1/2 hours in the freezer break up the ice, then break it up every so often so that it does not fully freeze.  This is the perfect recipe for a hot summer day!

Light and refreshing. All I tasted was fresh lemon with just a pleasing touch of sweetness. Nicely done. Loved the lemon zest.
