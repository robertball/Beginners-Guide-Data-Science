Oh wow, is this chipotle oil good! Well worth the week's wait after making it. The first thing I did was make popcorn with this and it made the perfect spicy popcorn. I can't wait to try this on other foods. Just two ingredients and so easy to make. I'll definitely keep some of this oil on hand.

I have not tried it yet but I can tell this is going to be my best friend oil.  I am growing habanero peppers which I hope will work as well. thanks for the tip. Eve

First time, other than using unflavored coconut oil instead of olive oil,  I made this exactly like the recipe,  Second, doubled it and let it sit for 2 weeks.  The smoked pepper taste was even better.  
I love this oil and cook with it all the time.

This was only OK for me.  I did wait the full week, followed the recipe as written, and my chipolte was fresh. However, the resulting oil is weak on flavor.  Next time I will try doubling the spice and see how that turns out.  Might also consider changing the pepper to cyan, adding some ginger, garlic, and toasted sesame seeds.  That sounds like it would be a good Asian flavored oil but I guess that would be a different recipe altogether and thus, not really relevant to this one...

I made this with Arbol Chile Pods and doubled recipe since I was making 3 gifts.  Because Arbols are so hot I used 1 1/2 tablespoons per 2 cups of oil.  Oil has not been used yet but I will update.  Thanks Chef John

Made this for my son in-laws, who love hot and spicy. I did a combination of red pepper flakes, chilli powder and chipotle powder (just using up the end of the bottles). It was definitely spicy, but not too spicy for me. I like it on fried potatoes and eggs. I'm sure the boys will use it for everything!

I made this oil weeks ago but finally got around to using it tonight as a popcorn oil.   This is so good with popcorn.    There is a zillion uses for this but it's BBQ season, so I'm immediately thinking marinade.  TY Chef John.

Thank-you Chef John! I'm allergic to corn and most processed food has corn in it! So I have to make most of my condiments by scratch if not all of it. So this came out wonderful and I love it. Please keep them coming you are definitely an inspiration:) Thank-You

Great gift for friends and family! I love this recipe and use my own dried peppers from my garden. Drying peppers can be a lengthy process and definitely requires protective gear. Fun and satisfying but not for the faint of heart.
