This recipe was very tasty. I think it was more of a sauce than a glaze, though. Which was fine with us. We had a thick cut center ham slice and I followed the directions on the ham package for the time and temp to bake the ham. The last 15 minutes of baking time, I added the "glaze" to the top of the ham, baked for the remaining time and the "glaze" hadn't "glazed". I then upped the temp and baked 15 minutes longer. It still was saucy on top. I halved the recipe and there was still at least a cup of sauce/glaze left. We just dipped our ham in it as a side sauce. The flavor was really good, just not what I expected. This sauce would be really good for dipping Chinese eggrolls in.  Thanks!   Erin

This was the first Christmas dinner i ever prepared on my own and it was a HUGE success!  it was surprsingly easy and inwxpersive.  I didn' have nutmeg on hand and i replaced in with a teaspoon of ginger and added orange slices for a citrus burst.  Fabulous and everyone wanted seconds and thirds.  I would definitly do it again!
