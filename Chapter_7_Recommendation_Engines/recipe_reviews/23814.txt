I made this for Christmas Eve dinner--just for two.  It was wonderful!  So quick, so easy and so tasty!  I did make a few changes:  based on one review, I switched the amounts of orange juice with the soy sauce.  I used currants rather than raisins (just because I had currants which I wanted to use up).  I also added slivers of the peel of one navel orange and 1/4 teaspoon ground hot red peppers.  I served it with white rice and garlic green beans.  I did have a bit of leftovers and the hot pepper taste was more pronounced.  I will definitely make this again--many times, I'm sure!  I think I will also make it with beef strips.

I liked this dish, and it was really easy to make. However, I think that the next time I make it, I will switch the amounts of soy sauce and orange juice, as I really couldn't taste that much orange flavor. Other than that, it was really good!

Pretty good. I took some posted suggestions and added 3/4 cup juice and 1/4 cup soy sauce and subst. honey for sugar. I also added 1/4 tsp of chili powder.  It could have used 1/2 tsp chili powder. Instead of plain OJ, I used pineapple orange juice. Yummy! It was very good.

I have to agree with another member that the amts for the orange juice and soy sauce was switched. Next time I will use 1/2 cup orange juice and 1/4 cup soy sauce. I love soy sauce, so even this first time wasn't bad. I enjoyed the raisins in the marinade too! I served this with rice and chinese veggies. Very good and easy recipe!

Delicious! Per other reviews, I switched the orange juice and soy sauce amounts and added a bit of chili powder.  The sauce was pretty liquidy which was great when served over rice, but maybe next time I'll try adding a tiny dash of cornstarch to help the sauce stick to the chicken better.

Just ok. I followed other reviews and swapped the oj and soy sauce measurments. I ended with a sauce that was too thin to spoon over the chicken.  It was really salty a well. I wont attempt this again

I have a question, are the amounts for the OJ and the soy sauce backwards, by any chance? The intro. says that it's supposed to be,"A classic, traditional orange flavored chicken dish with a kick!" but the predominate taste is the soy sauce. IF, I make it again, I'm going to switch the amounts.

This was good but at the same time the flavor of Orange juice was lost in the soy sauce.  I think next time I will add less soy and more orange juice.  Also I noticed that the juice started to dry up towards the end of cooking so I will use more of each too.

I thought this was great when I made it but my leftovers didn't seem to reheat as well the next day. It dried out. I would suggest to just make what you need and eat immediately. It had a nice flavor. I served mine with a side of buttered Butternut Squash, rolls, and rice.

5 stars, conditional on switching the measurements for the soy and OJ. I even added a bit more OJ. Used honey instead of sugar, and upped the amt of garlic and ginger. Used BONE-IN CHICKEN-- which I do believe makes a difference. Let it marinade for about 2 hours, and then cooked in slow cooker on high for 4 hours, low for 2 more. It was truly scrumptious! served with a side of rice. Happily eating the leftovers for lunch!

We really enjoyed this chicken. It is truly delish. Like many of the other reviewers I used 1/4 cup of soy sauce and 1/2 cup of orange juice. It was very yummy!! Also, I butterflied the chicken which resulted in a little longer prep time but a much shorter cooking time (about 20 minutes). Thanks for posting Amanda.

This recipe was pretty good, not sensational, but tasty none the less. I did switch the OJ and soy amounts, as many other reviewers suggested, definately a wise move. I was very glad that it didn't turn out looking like the picture!

This recipe was fantastic! Although I made a few adjustments. I increased the orange juice to 3/4 cup because we like a lot of sauce in our dishes. I added 1 garlic clove. I increased the ginger to 1 tsp. I increased the raisins to a couple of handfuls and I added the same amount of diced apricots. It was amazing and my hubby loved it! I will make this again and again. Thanks for posting it!

We really enjoyed this chicken! As others suggested, I reduced the soy sauce and increased the orange juice.  (Actually, I used orange/pinapple juice and it worked just fine.)  I also added a few drops of hot sauce to the marinade for extra flavor. I set the chicken up to marinate in the AM and turned it a few times during the day.. So, it probably marinated more like 6 - 7 hours.  Anyway, the chicken was very tender and tasty.  Thanks for the recipe, Amanda!

I used 1/4 cup soy sauce & 1/4 cup O.J. for the marinade, and it came out good, yet the soy sauce flavor was definitely more pronounced than the O.J.  I marinated about 5 hours and it was very flavorful.  I did add some red pepper flakes, and I think I'll add even more next time.

Very good!  I did what it seems everyone else did, swap the measurements for soy sauce and orange juice.  I also substituted honey for the sugar and used dried minced garlic.  I increased the ginger to about 1 teaspoon and used currants instead of raisins.  Instead of baking the chicken in the marinade, I baked it on a rack at 400* for about 25 minutes.  I made a slurry of cornstarch and orange juice, added it to the marinade in a saucepan and boiled until thick.  The chicken came out with the skinless surface a little "tight" looking, but the meat was tender and very juicy.  The sauce poured over the meat was excellent.  I served with steamed basmati rice (which went very well with the sauce) and the last of the fresh summer corn on the cob.  Will definitely make again...thanks!

I loved this simple chicken recipe.  I marinated the chicken for four hours and there was just the right amount of flavor.  I took the suggestion from another reviewer and switched the amounts of orange juice and soy sauce.  We then grilled it insted of baking and it turned out beautifully.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.  I will surely make this chicken again.

I took the advise of others and switched the orange juice and soy sauce amounts around and added 1/8 teaspoon of chili spice. My husband thought it was just ok.

This dish did not end up tasting how I hoped it would. It really tasted more like orange juice than the orange-soy-ginger-garlic flavour I anticipated, similar to a take-out dish. I will likely try this recipe again and add more ginger than I did(I used less than the recipe called for). But so far, not as impressed with the taste as I had hoped.

Let me start off by saying I made a few changes to the recipes per all the reviews saying the same thing, thats why its a 4 instead of a 5. Made the marinade in the morning when I had a momeny- so it got the chance to marinade for about 7 hours instead of only 2-3. Switched the soy sauce and OJ ammounts, added some orange zest and used honey instead of sugar.  Also used extra garlic ('cause I LOVE GARLIC!). I am not a big fan of raisins so I put them in the marinade but took them out before cooking. It came out delicious!!! Served over rice with green beans on the side! My PICKY boy ate it up! YUM!  Thanks!

Great for this season when fresh oranges are so plentiful. Like many others, I flip-flopped the oj and soy sauce. Also substituted honey for the white sugar the second time I made it. The sauce seemed to stand up better.

Perhaps I should have read the reviews first about changing the 1/2 cup soy - it was waaaaay too much soy! And the orange that I did taste tasted bitter. This one just didn't work for me - sorry :  (

I'm sorry but I really didn't like this.  The soy sauce overpowered all the other flavors.  I was hoping to taste the orange flavor but couldn't at all.

I wasn't too fond of this recipe, and I don't think I'll make it again anytime soon. Like others before me have said, the orange taste really didn't stand out well. I think I should've read the reviews before I made this.

Wonderful!  I didn't change a thing about the recipe.  Baste frequently during cooking.  Everyone really enjoyed it - this is a great way to jazz up chicken.

I also used 1/2 cup oj, 1/4 cup soy, leaving out the raisins, and grilled on Webber gas grill.  Very good.  Picky 11-yr old son also enjoyed.

Great taste and really easy!  My boyfriend was actually able to prepare it himself (no easy feat, I assure you).  I left out the raisins and it didn't sacrifice any flavor at all.

This recipe was delicious! I have made it several times and it is so good. Even my 5 yr old daughter loves it and she never likes the taste of chicken. I add a little extra soy sauce so there is some juice in the dish and I serve the chicken over rice. You will not be disappointed with this recipe!

Like others, I increase the OJ & reduced the soy sauce. I also omitted the raisins. My children loved it. My husband thought it was a little sweet. I will probaly make only whe we want something different.

I like so many others switched the oj and soy sauce amounts. I also added a little bit of garlic chili paste to spice it up a bit. I was really disappointed with the dish, had higher expectations...That being said, it wasn't terrible, but i do think it would have been much better if marinated and then grilled. (cooking it in the oven i think was the killer for me) the marinade tasted good and even smelled wonderful cooking, but the overall end result...disappointing.

This tasted really good!  I wasn't keen on the raisins when looking at the recipe, but really liked the taste and texture with each bite.  The kids liked it too.  Mine didn't get as dark as in the picture, but got darker the more I basted.

We enjoyed this chicken.  I switched the soy and orange juice amounts as recommended and found it to be quite orangey.  I will probably add some more garlic next time and use fresh ginger.  I might also mix in some cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I loved the flavor of the raisins though if you're not a raisin fan they can definitely be left out.  Also might be a good marinade for the grill (without the raisins).

Like the others, I switched the soysauce & orange juice amounts.  I also substituted honey for sugar and added a little red pepper.  Pretty tasty!  Easy to make and had all the ingredients on-hand.

Loved this marinade, Didn't use raisins and it still turned out great!!!  Only complaint is I would use a bone in chicken or increase the marinade volume next time. Thanks!

Very tasty, but a tad too salty. I excluded the raisins.  And instead of OJ, I pureed 2 whole oranges, zest and all.  It made the orange flavor intense!

I wish I had read the comments about the soy sauce and orange juie amounts being switched before I made this.  It was okay, but really salty due to the soy sauce.  I had oranges in the house so I used fresh-squeezed juice and also some orange zest which upped the orange flavor a bit.  I will try this again, but it needs some tinkering first.

I suggest sticking pretty close to the original recipe, unless you like a strong orange taste and after taste to your chicken.  I increased the orange juice to 1 cup and decreased soy sauce to 1/4 cup like some people suggest and left out the raisens.  it just tasted like orange juice with a strong after taste.  I poured out the sauce after baking and then sauted the chicken in a little olive oil and soy sauce.  the taste was much better and the after taste not so bad.

It was pretty good.. Not that spicey though.. I added a pinch or two of crushed red pepper flakes, but nothing.. I onl used 1/2 a cup of soy sauce, and a 1/2 a cup of orange juice, but it still seemed like more soy sauce than orange.. But it was really really yummy..

I ended up using 1 1/2 cups of OJ and 1/3 cup of soy sauce. I originally had only used about a half cup of OJ, and all I could taste was the soy sauce. I also added a few cloves while it was baking. Next time I'll probably add only 1/4 cup of soy sauce. It is a good recipe. I guess I just like mine more orangy.

Good but not great.  I left out the raisins.  The taste was good, but wasn't very strong.  Wished the orange flavor was more prominent!
