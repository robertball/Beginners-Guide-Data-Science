Highly recommened for the busy mom/dad!  What's better than a fast, easy to cook nutritious meal that the whole family loves?!  I made this for the first time tonight, and my husband and kids loved it and asked when I will be making it again.  I also made a gravey using the chicken bits in the pan and it turned out delicious (I think the gravey made the meal).  Topped the chicken and mashed potatoes with it and served with a side of steamed vegies.  Perfect fast, easy, delicious, healthy dinner for those nights when you get home from after school sports, etc.  Forget the run to McDonalds on the way home from baseball!***UPDATE***I still make this once a week and when my kids ask what's for dinner and I tell them this, they get very excited!  Be sure to try it with the gravey...After the chicken is done cooking add 3T butter and melt it, then add 3T flour and use a spatula or whisk to stir the flour and scrape up the chicken bits, the darker the rue the better, then whisk in about a cup and a half of chicken stock, more or less depending on how thick you like it.  YUM!

Love the recipe!  Here's a way to keep the flavor, but lose the saltiness that many reviewers mentioned.

Just dice about half an onion, and use fresh chopped garlic (to your taste).  That way the only salt product is the seasoning salt.  I also added some fresh ground black pepper.

Be careful with the cooking time if you use fresh onion and garlic.  I cook mine until it all browns up nicely (which makes a nice sauce in the pan...great, if serving with rice), but you need to make sure the chicken is cooked through, esp. if some of the breasts are very thick.

Even with these minor changes...it is still quick, easy, and a great recipe!

This recipe was wonderful. It smelled so good cooking, I could hardly wait to taste it. I did alter the recipe a little. I used lots of fresh garlic, and rubbed all the powdered seasonings on the chicken. I let the butter melt in some olive oil and added the garlic. After the chicken browned a little, I poured in a can of chicken broth let it simmer for a few until I stirred in 1/4 cup of flour. It made a great sauce! I served It over egg noodles. Loved every bit of it.

Loved the basic concept and then took some ideas from the other reviews.  I used olive oil, rather than butter.  Tossed in a big handful of chopped onion and a few teaspoons of already minced garlic from a jar while the chicken sauted.  After the chicken breasts were done, put in a can of chicken broth and let everything simmer while I finished the rest of the meal.  When the meal was ready, removed the chicken and made gravy out of what was left in the pan.  It was delicious and has become my favorite way to cook chicken.

Very good and so easy. I liked that I only had to use ingredients I had on hand. I Followed advice of another and used fresh chopped onion and garlic instead of powdered. I sauteed chicken until browned on both sides, then I added a 8.4 oz. box of low sodium chicken broth. I covered it and let cook over medium heat until chicken was done. This made the chicken very moist and tender. Then I removed chicken from the pan.  I added about 1 TBL. of corn starch mixed with about 1-1 1/2 c. cold water to the remaining butter and onion in the pan. I cooked this whisking the entire time until thick and bubbly. 
This made an excellent sauce to pour over the chicken. 
I served it with parmesan egg noodles on the side, but it would also be good with the chicken and sauce served over plain egg noodles or mashed potatoes.

I've been seasoning my chicken like this for more years than I can remember, even when I'm adding cooked chicken to other recipes.  One thing I do differently is to brown the chicken, both sides, on med-high heat, then reduce heat and simmer, adding a little water if necessary for a good 10-15 minutes.  Juicy and tender every time.

I have to agree with the reviewer who said this is only a good recipe if you don't know how to cook.  Personally, I wouldn't even call this a recipe.  If you want something just as easy with less calories, simply sprinkle the seasons on the chicken breasts and bake in the oven.  I wished I would have saved myself the calories.  It wasn't worth it.

I put the seasoning mixture on the chicken prior to cooking it. After it was nicely browned I added 1 cup of chicken broth. Tasted good. I'd have given it a 5 if it had mentioned adding water or broth to prevent burning...

Yum Yum Yum!!! I down scaled it to two servings and added some worcestershire sauce to the pan while frying. Also, to keep chicken from drying out, I lowered the heat to simmer and covered it for ten minutes after I browned them on both sides for 10 mins. This gave me plenty of time to make the rice and bake some rolls. Will make again!

I originally gave this recipe 4 stars.  Then I used a few usersâ€™ suggestions and I would give it 6 stars if I could!  These are the great suggestions I read: Add fresh onions and garlic instead of powder.  I didn't have fresh garlic, but the fresh onions I added made a world of difference! Next, add a can of chicken broth after it was brown on both sides and let it simmer until done. Last, after the chicken is done, mix in about 1/4 cup flour (more or less for thickness desire) to the broth and fresh onions.  This makes gravy that was so delicious; I was eating it alone after the chicken was gone!

One of the best and easiest recipes I have made for dinner in a long time. I decided to use extra virgin olive oil instead of the butter/margarine. I also added some fresh minced garlic and allowed it to brown in the heated oil before I placed the chicken in the skillet. I added the chicken to the olive oil/garlic mixture and placed half of the dry ingredients on top of the chicken. After allowing the chicken to brown for about 5 minutes I turned it over and added the other half of the dry ingredients to the other side of the chicken. It turned out absolutely marvelous. My boyfriend gave it rave reviews!! I served the chicken with a fresh grape tomato and mozzarella salad and French bread. Looking forward to making this again!!

After reading other readers' suggestions, I use fresh white onions and garlic and chicken broth.  I first coat the pan with olive oil and saute the onions and garlic just a a minute or so.  Then I add the chicken breast that has been seasoned with seasoning salt on both sides to the pan with the butter on top of breast.  Once both sides are browned nicely, I add a can of chicken broth, cover the pan, and let it simmer until the sauce gets to the desired gravey thickness.  This chicken is so juicy and the gravy is so good that there are hardly ever any leftovers.  This dish has become a staple for us.  I love to serve this with brown rice and asparagus.

My first negative comment is to the people who change the recipe, almost completely and then rate it................  anyway, very much enjoyed as written but would use Olive oil the next time and add some extra garlic. Thanks for such an easy dish to prepare in a hurry and with lovely tasty and moist results (minus the chicken broth).

I made this exactly as is because I wanted to taste it before I made modifications. It was excellent.
I would like to try it with olive oil and some fresh garlic. I did add a few cloves of garlic fried in with the butter....Awesome with rice.

Absolutely loved this!!  Used 1/2 tsp sea salt instead of seasoning salt and it was great.  As others suggested, I just browned both sides well in olive oil, removed from pan and made a gravy with a couple tsp. each of melted butter and flour and added 2 c. chicken stock.  I then returned the chicken to the pan with gravy and simmered uncovered till done.  Served over brown rice and veggies.  Loved it, sooo flavorful, thanks.

Great recipe! I put mine in a baking dish, covered it with tin foil, and baked it in the oven instead of cooking it on the stove top though. Turned out great! Very tasty :)

I love this recipe!  It's super yummy and easy!  I use chicken tenders.  Once the chicken is cooked, I add a can of roasted garlic chicken broth and let it simmer for a few minutes longer.  The gravy is incredible!  I always make enough that my husband and I can have leftovers later in the week.  I serve it with french rolls for dipping the sauce.

Delicious and easy! I melted 1 tbsp butter in some olive oil. I pounded the thawed chicken breasts thin and covered them in a mixture of minced garlic (8 cloves) and 1/4 onion, salt, and pepper. After sauteing for 10 minutes on each side, I added 1 cup chicken broth (half an extra large bullion cube dissolved in boiling water) and let the chicken simmer for >5 minutes. Then I removed the chicken and added 1 Tbsp cornstarch (dissolved in cold water) to the remaining juices in the pan for a delicious sauce to pour on top of the chicken. The resulting chicken was so moist and flavorful!

This is as promised an EASY, tasty way to make Chicken, and great to build on!

After reading 4 pages of reviews, I finally gave in and tried this recipe...with some helpful suggestions from earlier reviewers.

My 2 Cents:

Garlic Mashed Potatoes on the side -
[[Hybrid recipe: Microwave a Cup of fat free milk, 1/4 cup of low fat sour cream and 1 TBS butter until butter melts - about a minute.
Use in mashing whatever potatoes I have on hand. Grease a dish and put in Oven on lowest setting, then start work on Chicken. I used tenderloins]]

I simmered half a chopped RED onion and 1 TSP minced garlic in butter, added Chicken.
Spiced with Garlic, Onion Powder, AND Half a Maggi chicken cube. Removed chicken pieces from the skillet when they were done.
Added 2 TBS butter, 3 (yes 3)TBS Flour and stirred continuously over medium heat to make Roux for gravy- and I like really DARK Roux for unique flavor. Added a 14 oz can of low sodium Chicken broth to complete gravy. Then put the Chicken back in to coat it with gravy.

Served with mashed potatoes as above and steamed veggies.

Not bad for a first try at a recipe - for me, anyway. Not bad for 2 Cents!

My family gave me "2 Thumbs Up!!". Because I told them to so I could write it here. But they DID LOVE it!
Five stars for the recipe that made it possible to do above!

Hope this wasn't too long!

Needed a quick & easy recipe that is low sodium and tried this tonight. I was tired of multiple step recipes & time consuming meals due to health reasons and it was delicious ~ a real keeper!!! I did not measure the seasonings and just did it to our taste. I also replaced the seasoning salt with Goya Sazonador Total, also labeled as The Perfect Seasoning. For anyone needing to lower sodium intake, this is only 75 mg sodium as opposed to most seasoning mixes being quite high in sodium. I hope that I have written this review in a way that is not confusing and that it will help someone.

This dish didn't have much flavor until I added many more seasonings but I did like the garlic.  I tried this by sauteeing and baking and the baking was much better...chicken was juicier and healthier too!

Very easy to make & tastes great!  I added some fresh minced garlic to give it even more of a garlic kick.  If you are health conscious like me, you can omit the butter and cook this in some garlic flavored fat free cooking spray -- tastes just as good coked this way!

I made this recipe as stated and it was great!  My two year old loved it and even asked for more chicken which never happens!  I had very large chicken breasts so I did slice them in half so they would be thinner and cook better, but otherwise it was great as stated.

I get easily disgusted with reviewers that complain about how easy a recipe is while on this site.  Yes, this recipe is simple, but it gives everyone a base to start from, or a very quick easy recipe.  This site is not just for advanced cooks.  Even though I have been cooking for myself for years, I have never actually cooked... chicken...   before I tried this recipe.  And, it is because this was the simplest, most un-intimidating recipe that i choose this one.   I, of course, followed a couple of reviews advice and tweaked the recipe (mostly due to the fact that I just moved and cannot find my onion powder or my garlic powder!)  So, I added a medium sized handful of freshly chopped vidalia onions, a couple tablespoons of jarred minced garlic (mmmmm...) in with the 3 tablespoons of butter (and a little added olive oil)   I also added a cube of chicken bullion and extra water after browning the chicken on both sides and let the chicken simmer in the mixture for a probably around 15-20 minutes.    After removing the chicken, I added a little more water and flour (around 3 spoonfuls) to form a thick sauce.  I served over rice, and my mother loved it.  It also smelled remarkable while cooking, and my mother and my brother's girlfriend wouldn't stop telling me how good it smelled in the house.   I will have to try it out again!

This was a fabulous, easy and quick dish to make! My husband and toddler both gobbled it up--they are a picky crowd! I followed others suggestions and used fresh garlic and onion with the butter before I put the chicken in. I seasoned the chicken with Lawry's Seasoned Salt. At the end, after the chicken was out, I added some chicken broth to the pan and some more butter and flour to make a gravy, and served it over some mashed potatoes along side the chicken. YUMMY! Definately a repeater :)

Quick, easy, and yummy. I used olive oil instead of butter, and fresh garlic to give it a stronger flavor. I also used thin sliced chicken breast, and then tenderized them. I rubbed the onion powder into the breast. It was fantastic!

I'm soo disappointed in this recipe.  I used Chicken broth to cook the chicken in along with the recommended spices . I sprinkled oregano and Basile to try and give the chicken flavor.  The only good thing I can say about this recipe is that it was under 300 calories but it had no flavor.

VERY VERY good, and SUPER easy.  Even the pickiest eaters in my home LOVED this.  I prefer the sliced garlic, as well as onions, to all of the powders.  Everything else we kept the same, and it turned out DELICIOUS.  We also used someone else's suggestion of making a homemade gravy of chicken broth, flour, water, and drippings to put over the chicken, and served it with rice.  we WILL be having this again, and chances are... VERY soon!  Thanks!!!

My picky family loved this chicken!
I did do a little tweeking. Following some of the other suggestions, the spice measurements were cut in half and a can of chicken broth was added. I made four huge breasts and the four of us shared two. I use the chicken broth to make a gravy and cut up the left over pieces into it. We'll have that this week over rice. Thanks for a great recipe.

The name is fitting.  It is good and easy.  I cut my breasts into strips before cooking so I would get more flavor throughout the chicken.  I then put some pesto and sun dried tomatoes in with the chicken and tossed to heat through.

WOW Julia!  This was some delicious chicken.  We enjoyed this recipe so much, I made it 2 days in a row.  I did make a few adjustments, but they were very minor.  I used chicken tenderloins rather than the breasts and added some oregano in with the rest of the seasonings.  I did not measure them out, just sprinkled them on liberally until it looked right.  I pan fried them in a little olive oil until they were lightly browned and cut them into bite size peices.  One night I used this chicken in the Santa Fe Chicken Salad (also a very good recipe on this site) and the next time I used this chicken in a pasta dish.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks so much.

Very good chicken.  I actually forgot to add the garclic and it was still so good.  I used fresh onion instead of onion powder and made a gravy out of the drippings.  Just added about 2 tablespoons of flour and made a rue and then added about a cup to a cup and a hlaf of chicken stock.  Good simple recipe.

I live alone and I just defrost one chicken breast and use this recipe (lighter on the seasonings of course). It turns out wonderful each time. I always always scared to panfry chicken before this because I thought it'd dry out. Not with this recipe! Love it!!!

This is great.  Since there are only two of us, I cut one breast in half and just sprinkled it with the spices, then browned it in one Tbsp butter and a little oil, then added about 1/4 Cup chicken broth, covered and simmered 15 minutes.  I didn't thicken the sauce, but just poured it over the chicken to serve.  The sauce was also good on the brown rice I served with the meal.

This is a good basic recipe. I took suggestions from other reviews and used a broth to cook the chicken in after getting a good brown on both sides. I also seasoned the chicken before adding it to the pan. Unfortunately I didn't have my car today so I could not go get onion and garlic and had to use the seasoning. I made the broth from a bullion cube. The chicken was a bit on the salty side, but not intolerable. If I got to use a low sodium broth and fresh ingredients, I know it would take out the saltiness. I will def make this again.

This was especially good - I did take others advice and sauteed fresh chopped onions and garlic in the butter before adding the chicken which I seasoned as recipe indicates but added a light dusting of flour as well.  Once the chicken had browned I added white wine and chicken broth to simmer down a bit and then added a tblsp. of flour to thicken the gravy.  I served with Rice Pilaf, steamed broccoli and salad and it was perfect.  Thankyou for a really yummy simple recipe.

We all had seconds!  I made the gravy by adding flour to the butter then using chicken broth to make the gravy (make sure to scrape the bottom for more flavor!).  I then let the chicken cook in the gravy a while to make sure the chicken was cooked through.

I absolutely love you for posting this recipe. My boyfriend had found it awhile back because he was hungry and I wanted something easy to cook. The first time I made it, I did use a lot more than 3Tbs of butter and it did come out a little too dry. But after a few times of making it, I made a few changes. I use a little Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) instead, which is much less fattening than using all that butter. And also covering the pan while it cooks helps keep the moisture in.

My family loved it. When it was close to being done, I added a little College Inn Chicken Broth so that it gave it some juice.  I served over brown rice.  Will make again.

Not bad, but not spectacular either by any means. It came out good, but we weren't very impressed with it.

It was OK but a little bland. I used Emmeril's Italian Essence in place of the seasoning salt.

Very very good! As suggested in another review, I made the gravy after the chicken was done and it brought everything together. Was just a bit salty, but was still great tasting. So i will use slightly less of the seasoning salt and garlic powder. Chicken was juicy and yummy. Will definitely be making this more often. Thanks for this easy recipe!

This is great for beginners. It is really simple and is made extremely quickly. Plus it uses ingredients that you probably have in your cabinet! I do suggest cooking at a slower/lower speed, also pounding chicken if it is thick. Otherwise you will most certainly burn it!

Really, really good chicken. I used chopped onion and garlic from a jar. I browned the chicken breasts in a small amount of olive oil, added 1 cup of chicken broth, covered and simmered until done. I removed the chicken and moved to a warm oven. I added 1 T. cornstarch in 1 cup of water(would use less water next time) and added it to the pan of juice and brown bits, stirred until thick. Then served the chicken and gravy over brown rice. A flavorful and healthy chicken dish.

This was just an average chicken dinner. It did not taste great, it didn't really taste like anything. Maybe I should have used real minced garlic. or more seasoning.

This was a good and easy meal and wonderful after getting home from work.  It's a good change from bbq chicken but pretty salty.  Probably won't have it all the time but I'll have it when we need a change from the everyday. Thanks for sharing

Even if it is supposed to be a "quick" recipe, it's not that great and terribly unhealthy.  Too much salt.  Use olive oil for less calories and use fresh garlic and onion.  Also, use about a cup of chicken stock to help keep it moist.  Plus, butter tends to burn faster and if you are not careful, it can separate.  Use sea salt instead of just table salt.

I like garlic, but I don't love it, so I'm glad I mixed the seasonings in a bowl and sprinkled them on that way. I didn't use the entire thing, but it was plenty garlicky for us. I served it with pasta alfredo and it was delish. I probably wouldn't eat it by itself, but as a filler for the pasta it was very good.

Wowza!  This was incredible.  I put some minced garlic in with the butter while melting, practically doubled the garlic powder and minced onion but kept the seasoned salt the same.  (It is a little salty, so use sparingly.)  Sauteed the ultra thin breasts about 4 mins on each side, and then added 1.5c chicken broth and thickened with Wondra to make a fabulous gravy.  (Honestly - the chicken didn't even need it.. but you can never go wrong with gravy!)  Served it with mashed potatoes, steamed corn, and garlic knots!!

So simple and inexpensive... perfect for me!  I added some olive oil and fresh garlic as suggested by reviewers and it gave it a wonderful flavor! I also took the suggestion to cook it a bit longer on each side, which give it a nice crispy skin.  Will make again and again!

Loved this !!! I made a few additions and the outcome was great. I cooked a small minced onion and a lil minced garlic for a couple of minutes in the butter before adding the chicken. After adding the chicken I sprinkled Adobo seasoning, garlic pwder and onion powder. Cooked the chicken through then added 2 tablespoons of flour and then chicken broth (maybe 1/2 can - according to how thick/thin you like your gravy). Then I added a small can of mushrooms. Served with mashed potatoes. Yum ... my picky children gobbled the chicken and my husband had seconds!!

Easy recipe that is perfect when you want to serve a good meal but don't have a lot of time. I served with rice. Only thing I did in addition is, after removing the chicken from the pan, I deglazed the pan with a little red wine and let it reduce for a couple minutes, then poured the wine over the rice.

This chicken is great.  Very easy and very tasty.  My kids ages 4 and 8 even loved it.  I didn't have onion salt so I used onion flakes instead and it was still good.  We will definitely eat this again.

This is fantastic, and it doesn't get any easier or faster!  I cut the recipe in half, and the amount of garlic powder seemed like an awful lot (1 tsp), so I only used about 1/2 tsp, which worked out fine.  I used the recommended amount of margarine, but cooking spray (or less margarine) would have been OK too.

Very tasty, if a tad salty. Just go easy on the seasonings. This is great to make a few days ahead, and then cut up to toss on top of green salads. Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

This was recipe was great!! Tried it last night and my husband and I both loved it!! Followed other peoples recommendations, and used minced garlic with olive oil & butter, coated the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder & seasoned salt and sauteed until brown. Then added the chicken brother and covered and cooked an additional 10 minutes or so.  I then took the chicken out and added 1/4 cup flour to make a thicker sauce, which I poured over egg noodles. It was sooo delicious!! This will be a staple in our house now.

It was a little bland for my taste, so when we tried this recipe a second time, we added other seasonings to the mix, and it turned out well.

This was a definitely a good quick way to make chicken. I used olive oil instead of butter, so much better for you. When I need a quick meal to make on a hurried day, this is the one I'm going to reach for. I gave it 4 stars because it's not the most succulent chicken I've had, but given that it's a quick and easy recipe that doesn't require a lot of time and marinating, I thought it was good enough.

Like  other users suggested i added a can of chicken broth.  I took out some of the liquid from the pan added 2 tbsp. of cornstarch mixed it up and then returned to the pan until bubbly. 
The end result is a nice sause.  I also added olive oil to the butter for less fat as suggested by other people.

Hubby really liked this chicken.  So nice to have such an easy prep.  I took a few of the reviewers' recommendations- used fresh garlic, simmered in a bit of broth thickened with a teaspoon of flour for a few minutes and served as gravy.

I sub. olive oil for butter. Once the cooking is complete, I add some chicken stock to the pan and that gets it really juicy. My five year old keeps asking for this!

not amazing but a good starter recipe if youre new to making chicken on the stove. i listened to other reviews and used fresh onion and garlic. towards the end i added a bit of chicken broth and sprinkled in some flour to make a more gravy like sauce. i definitely suggest doing so to keep it more moist, especially if there will be leftovers.

One of my favorite easy chicken recipes.  I like to mix the spices in an empty spice shaker and sprinkle on the chicken to make sure the spices are added evenly.  Sometimes I do what another reviewer suggested and after the chicken is done I set it aside and add 3T butter to the pan, melt it, then add 3T flour and use a spatula or whisk to stir the flour and scrape up the chicken bits.  Make sure you use something that won't scratch your skillet!  Once you have a nice rue whisk in a cup or cup and a half of chicken stock.  I make it with or without the gravy and it is EASY, JUICY & VERY FLAVORFUL!

Good easy recipe! I followed other reviewers advice about adding the Chicken broth- only had bouillion tho- I was worried the breasts would burn if not. I think that added too much salt to the dish. I enjoyed it salt and all! Next time I will just cook as written. I think they will come out much better that way!

Why can't anyone actually review the recipe as written?? If your mods are so great, submit your own recipe and rate that. This dish was okay. I MADE AS WRITTEN. It is a good dish if you want something simple. Also, most people probably have all of the ingredients on hand.

Easy to cook, even for a new chef like me.  10-15 minutes per side was way too much.  It took me only a couple minutes.  As you see in my picture, bits of it even looked burnt

This was great! I carmalized some red onions, and then in the SAME pan, did this recipe, ommitting the onion salt.I took the advice of another poster, making sure the pan was hot enough to give the chicken a crunchy spice coating.  I layed the chicken on the bed of onions, and it was delicious, with tons of flavor.

This was really good.  I browned the breasts quickly, then added some chicken broth, covered and let simmer til done.  Then thickened the broth to make a gravy.  Family really liked it.  Not exactly a gourmet dish, but quick and easy.  Will make again.

I would just call this quick and messy.  To me, it was not very tasty or flavorful, and was extremely messy and covered my entire stove with oil splatter.  I would not make this again.

YUM!  Simply AND tasty.  Even my VERY picky 5 year old had seconds and thirds.  I love how quickly this cooked up.  My only suggestion, if you want to make the cooking time even faster...pound down the chicken breasts before adding them to the skillet.

Otherwise, this was a GREAT recipe!

This recipe was very quick and easy! The spices work well with chicken. I will make this again for my family when I need something quick and easy. This chicken also works well sliced and added to make a chicken salad. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a really easy recipe! I think, though, that I will use a little less butter next time.

The chicken was easy to cook. However it was a little bland and could have used more taste.

I didn't think my 10 yr old and 6 yr old would like this one, especially with the garlic flavor, but it wasn't strong at all and everyone loved it!!  I just sprayed the chicken with a buttery spray and put it on the George Foreman grill...excellent!!

I am a mom of 8 and being married to a man that is a foodie like myself,I am always looking for an amazing recipe that doesn't take all that extra time, "that I just don't have" that is AMAZINGLY GOOD and nutritious! This was it! I used garlic powder, Adolph's meat tenderizer "the yellow cap" and minced onion that you buy where the salt and pepper is sold and used the 2 tabs of margarine, and that minced onion browned up amazing! This was juicy, and so SO flavorful, my husband was "MmMmMmm" ing with every bite! What I do know is this, when I read by another reviewer that this was "a great recipe ONLY IF you don't know how to cook"....I was thinking, seriously?? I cook! And cook and cook and cook. Benn told loads of times how amazing of a cook I am. "I'm no high paid chef but in my home, i'm a star for sure ;)" That review is wrong. This is a great recipe if you want amazing tasting chicken, moist and tender and mouth watering with every bite, especially if you don't have the TIME to make a 5 course meal. :)Bon Appetite friends!

So my a little over 2 month old son was giving me a hard time lol putting him down for a nap. But finally I did and needeed to make something quick. I had some chicken thighs (my husband is a fan of thighs and I am of chicken breast) that I had freshly bought the night before. This was soooo easy to make and my husband really liked it. Actually he said "babe this is really good!" BUT I did tweak it a little.

I used half butter half olive oil. I sauteed mushrooms first because chicken alone is just icky and plus my hubby loves mushrooms.skipped the season salt and used fresh pepper and sea salt.I just kind of put a dash here and a dash there of the onion and garlic powder. And then right towards then end right out of the pan and onto the plate, I squeezed a fresh lemon on the chicken and mushrooms. And made a mini greek salad for him as well. Loved it. Def going to keep this recipe in mind wheather I am in a rush or not. A total winner and total no brainer. If you mess this recipe up.....*sigh* there is no excuse to mess this one up. 

Happy eating my fellow yelpies!

I made this even easier by reducing it to three ingredients.  I used four boneless/skinless chicken breasts, a premixed spice (I used McCormick's Grill Mates Garlic and Onion Medley) patted into the meat, and cooked in four tablespoons butter on stove top.  It was really good.  My husband thinks that it would be great as a foil dinner packet, along with some frozen veggies, cooked on the grill.

The name says it all...Good Easy Garlic Chicken, except I replace Good with Awesome!  For those that don't agree, I'm thinking either they are over seasoning or they are not seasoning the chicken enough.  I did use a bit more butter than the recipe calls for, but other than that, I didn't change a thing.

Great Recipe! Quick and tasty! Made the gravy with the bits left in the pan with some chicken stock. I made some packaged butter noodles and sauteed some string beans.  Dinner was finished in no time!

really good.  I followed some of the suggestions from others, added a little olive oil with the butter, added about a half of a chopped onion and fresh garlic, and added a can of chicken broth.  It was a little dry, but that was my fault for overcooking.  Will definitely make this often! Thanks so much Julia!

This recipe had a lot of good flavors and spices, but I think a note needs to be added that the chicken will burn very easily if you follow the instructions exactly. For people that know how to cook, that may not be an issue (chicken broth is a good idea), but for beginners that are looking for an "easy" recipe, it could be a problem.

I cooked this for the whole time it stated on recipe.  Unfortunately one of the chicken breasts was not as thick as the other one and so it dried out and was tough.  The thicker one was juicy and delicious.  So if you are going to cook this don't cook as long if the breasts aren't thick.

I've made this recipe about 4 or 5 times now with Olive Oil instead of butter. It was OK but not as good. Loved it this time! I made 3 breasts and made 1/2 the amount of seasoning. After I seasoned them and browned them in the hot butter I added about 1/2 a cup of water and simmered on the stove for 40 minutes or so on low/med. Then when the water was starting to disappear I turned the heat up to  medium high to brown them again. Best chicken ever! So tender and juicy and the butter made it very flavorful. Go for the extra fat and use the butter, you won't be sorry.

Really good! Used others suggestions: rubbed seasonings on chicken, sprinkled with flour and rubbed in right before putting in the pan, and used a tablespoon of butter with olive oil in the pan. I also added a little chicken stock to help it cook. Delicious!

Fabulous recipe! It's really easy to make. I didn't want my recipe to be plain chicken with no sauce.  As skd1983 suggested, I added chicken broth when the chicken started to brown. THEN, you gotta ADD cream cheese (philadelphia) to the chicken broth and melt them. I used 1 tablespoon. Served it on top of noodle pasta. It was great, the cream cheese definitely gives it a good tase. I also sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top of the dish.

Stumbled upon this looking for something quick to make for dinner. I took the advice of many others and made a pan sauce after cooking the chicken and it was outstanding. I made my pan sauce by removing the chicken from the pan, adding a few tablespoons of flour and whisking for 2-3 minutes to create a dark brown roux, then adding 1 cup of chicken stock and whisking until thick, then adding 1/2 cup heavy cream and whisking. Salt, pepper to taste.

This was absolutely delicious and so easy!  It smelled so good as it was cooking.  I chunked up the chicken and added it to the homemade Alfredo Sauce.  I served with salad and homemade Italian bread.  It was a great meal that made me feel like a gormet cook!  Thank you!  My mother-in-law was very impressed!

This is just about the best recipe for boneless chicken breasts that I've ever found!  I've gotten so tired of eating chicken and was running out of ideas, but I think I could eat this chicken every night!  It is definitely a recipe I'll cook many times!!!

this is a great recipe because it is so
easy, but a few yrs ago someone on a tv show said to always add a little oil to the pan if you are using butter to fry something.  It helps to keep the butter from burning.  I used some shortening
which in itself can make chicken tender and juicy.

This is one of the first recipes I made off of this site about three years ago. We still make it and my husband still loves it. My only alteration that I've made over the years is that I put a cover on the pan when I make it. It keeps the ckicken super moist and I never burn it if I'm distracted by kids.

This was absolutely delcious! The most flavorful chicken I've tasted, and very moist. I took others advice and added fresh minced garlic and white wine at the end. I will make this again, it was so quick, easy and tasty.

This is definitely easy and good!  I read some of the reviews and used a couple of suggestions.  I pounded the chicken breasts flat.  I just sprinkled a bit of seasoned salt and garlic powder over them, so it wouldn't be overly salty.  I didn't have onion powder.  I added a half a handful of frozen chopped onion and a teaspoon of minced garlic to the melted butter, per another reviewers suggestion.  It flavored the butter, which added extra flavor to the chicken.  I drizzled the flavored butter over the chicken when I served it and it was so good! I served with rice pilaf and veggies. My husband, daughter and I all loved it!

I don't know what everyone is fussing about. Just as the name of the recipe implies, it's a good, EASY chicken dish. A dish from a 5 star hotel it's not; however, if you need something tasty and in a jiff, this definitely hits the spot. Great recipe, use it many times when I'm on a tight schedule. Thanks!

I loved this recipe. I did use one of the variation that I got off another review by making it into a sauce and served over noodles. I also added some fresh ground pepper and some paprika to give it a little kick.

This was my 1st attempt at cooking chicken (EVER). It couldn't have been easier! I cooked it on an electric skillet (enough for a family of 9 doesn't fit in a pan) and everyone loved it. I served it with garlic bread and rice pilaf. Definitely a keeper.

I made this the other night and my husband loved it.  It actually came out kind of blackened, (which I'm not sure it was supposed to!) but he loves blackened stuff so he was thrilled.  Will make again.

It was really good, really easy and for once I had all the ingredients on hand. mine turned out a little tough but I think it was because I defrosted the chicken in the microwave. but we all ate it, even my super picky two year old asked for seconds!!!!!!

I love to cook, but as a mom of 3 simple is better most nights. I use this as the base of about 75% of my chicken dishes. Whether it's pasta, on top of salad, sandwiches, etc. or by itself with sides. This has so much flavor and goes with everything! And SO easy! So cook this, and add it to whatever recipe you're using that calls for chicken. Can't go wrong.

I love this recipe because it is quick, easy, and uses few ingredients.  Make sure the chicken has been patted dry before you add the seasonings.  Also get the pan nice and hot before you put the chicken in.  I am an average cook and even I can make this!

I wanted to grill last night and in order to make this recipe, I skipped the butter, coated my chicken with some EVOO and sprinkled it with the seasonings.  Iâ€™m not sure I would grill this next time.  In hindsight, the butter would have contributed to the flavor that our chicken lacked.  No fault of the recipe so I am still giving this five stars.  We ate it doused with a little barbeque sauce and it was good, maybe not great, but good!  UPDATE: 3/26/13:  I made this again last night.  This time I halved all the seasonings and  combined them in a plastic bag, threw in the chicken and shook it up to coat.  Then I sauteed it in butter and it was delicious - 5 stars!  I used it to make chicken sandwiches on everything bagels.  Great sammies!  Only change next time would  be to use half butter and half EVOO to help prevent the butter from burning.

Great base chicken recipe.  It can be used alone, or you can personalize it to your taste.

Omg this chicken recipe is DELICIOUS! I made it with the gravy the other review mentioned and it is my husbands FAVORITE meal. The only thing is I use 2 skinless breasts and add nature's seasoning... The gravy is really what makes it! So delicious, fast, and easy!!!

The whole family loved it! It was great that I had everything already in my cabinets. I try not to use a lot of salt since I am trying to lose weight so instead of butter I poured about half a cup of chicken broth and cooked the first side then about another half cup after turning the chicken over. Salt free chicken broth would have been better, but we were out of it currently.

Perfectly simple and delicious, especially using fresh onion and garlic and then making the gravy with the drippings (as a reviewer suggested). The kids loved it and asked for seconds. We had a side of red skin mash potatoes to use up even more gravy.

I did not have the season salt so I used cajun spice instead.  I also added thickened chicken broth for gravy knowing that my kids usually complain about dry meat and... My 17 yo son complained that the chicken was bland and dry.  I was also not very impressed with this recipe.  This might be okay for someone that is just starting to cook as a base but really needs a lot of work to be called a main course.

Very tasty, but the amount of butter needed to saute the chicken seemed like a huge amount.  Yes, the chicken was very tasty, but I think I'll stick to grilling or baking my chicken when I can.

A very good combination. I was using my oven anyway, so I just popped these in the oven instead of heating up the stove.

With so many great reviews, I figured how could I go wrong with this recipe?  I wasn't disappointed - it's great!  I read most of the reviews and here's what I did - coated the chicken with flour and the mixture of spices by shaking it in a plastic bag.  I browned it in butter and a little olive oil, then immediately added about 1 cup of chicken broth.   Lowered the heat and continued cooking (uncovered) until the broth had reduced almost completely.  At that point the chicken was perfectly cooked, moist and juicy.  I served over egg noodle dumplings and poured the pan juices over all.  I've also prepared this using freshly breaded pork loins.  I added the seasonings to 1 cup of chicken broth and poured over the browned pork, simmering uncovered until the sauce had reduced.  A delicious entree, also.

My husband and I agreed that this was probably the best chicken recipe ever! I followed this exactly and it was delicious!... I've also tried it with the "gravy" mixture that another review suggested and I thought it was good... but not as good as it is without it. This will be a fam fav!

This would have been good, had I not followed others reviews and made the yucky gravy.  I'm trying again WITHOUT the gravy and I bet it'll be better...I gave four stars because the chicken would be fine by itself.  UPDATE:  I cook this chicken all the time now without making the mistake of the gravy.  Its so easy, especially when you don't feel like cooking an extravagant meal.  And to those who said its only a good recipe if you don't know how to cook...some of us may not want to slave away in the kitchen ALL night after work and actually look for easy recipes like this!  THANKS!

Thought the recipe was very easy, but nothing spectacular.  Makes a good chicken , the taste is decent, but not worthy of five stars.  Pluses: few ingredients, easy to make, not time consuming.

If I could give this a 10 I would. Mostly because my  four PICKY children devoured it! They have been asking when I'll make it again. Tried it with the gravy from drippings, but it wasn't all that great. So we had it with out. I also used minced garlic & onions. This would be good with a butter garlic sauce over pasta...sorta like the Olive Gardens Chicken Scampi. ;) Thank You

I took from several of the different reviews.  First I sauted some fresh chopped onion and garlic.  I still coated the chicken in onion powder, garlic powder, and the seasoning salt.  I browned the chicken on both sides.  Then I added chicken broth and covered the pan until the chicken was done.  It was the most flavorful and juicy piece of chicken I have ever had.  I served it over egg noodles with the remaining suace on the side for those that wanted more.

This was really good and easy. I made roni and peas to go with it (pasta and peas cooked & drained, then add garlic salt, 3tbs butter 1/4 cup cream (or milk) and 1/3 cup parmesan cheese.) This is great stuff for picky kids. BOTH of my boys raved which is unheard of!

This was the easiest chicken I have ever made.  It was soooo good.  I added the fresh onions and garlic right along with the powders and my goodness was it good.  I also added the chicken broth and a bit of flour and butter to make the most fantastic gravy.  Went very good with my fried rice and veggies!  Thanks a million for the recipe!

This is one of the best recipes I've tasted so far.  My FI & I are avid chicken eaters too.  The only thing I added to this recipe is dilly seasoning & chicken broth to keep it from drying out.  It was delicious though, I will definetly be making this again!  Thanks Julia!

I give it 5 stars because of how quick and easy this is. I always have chicken on hand and when I haven't planned anything in advance I know I can always rely on this. Plus it tastes great!

Thanks, Ms. Green. As said before about this recipe, easy and moist. Variation: cooked in olive oil, then added minced garlic and white wine near the end of the cooking time.

What a great recipe, Julia! I tried it for the first time tonight and everyone loved it! Very easy and moist. I didn't have any problems with it being very messy as others have said. I cooked mine at a medium-low temperature and had very little splatter. Keep the recipes coming!!!

This was really yum! I melted 3 heaping tablespoons of a very light margarine type spread in a pan and put in fresh garlic, italian seasoning and a little garlic powder, then added chicken. I didn't have any onion powder. It was very moist and I just served with veggies, but would be wonderful with mashed potatoes and a salad of some sort. Husband loved it! Will definitely make again. Very quick easy!!!!

Great dish!  I changed the recipe a bit.  I used chopped garlic and onion and added Italian seasoning.  I let the chicken simmer in broth with a dash of hot sauce after it browned on both sides.  When the chicken was done I made a gravy with 1/4 cup of flour and 1 cup of water.  It tasted wonderful with mashed potatos.

This recipe was good. I followed a suggestion to add a can of chicken broth and 1/4 cup of flour to make a gravy. I served it over pasta. It is a real comfort food. It is a hearty chicken noodle soup kind of meal. I needed to add a little salt and pepper to my own plate for a little extra flavor.

This chicken dish is the greatest. It easy to make.Hardly any mess. You never have any left over laying around and everyone always has plenty. This recipe is also good to add a slice of cheese over the top of it right before it is done and let the cheese melt. YUM!YUM!YUM!

This recipe was incredibly easy to make and tasted very good. I will definitely make this again when I need a quick and easy meal. I followed the advice of another reviewer and sprinkled some black pepper on the chicken while it was cooking. The chicken wasn't at all salty. Thanks for the recipe.

Not only was this easy to make, but it was also very tasty. My husband loved it. Although I didn't have any garlic powder when I made it, I ended up using garlic & herb seasoning. It was really good. I would tell anyone reading this to try this.

I thought this recipe was good.  I love the flavor of garlic. I followed the recipe the first time and it didn't have enough garlic flavor for me. Next time, I replaced the garlic powder with garlic cloves. I also added a teaspoon of fresh gound pepper for a little extra flavor. Thanks!

That this recipe is so highly rated is just a testament to people's terribly low standards when it comes to the seasoning and texture of chicken.

Follow this recipe to the letter and you'll get a dry and overcooked, likely unevenly burnt piece of chicken that's too salty and otherwise bland.

(I created an account just to warn people off this recipe.  Wow.  I'm mad at the waste of meat.)

I made it and the instructions make it seem like it was written by someone who has never cooked anything before.  The garlic/onion powder seasonings barely hold any flavor to the chicken and using butter to start instead of olive oil doesn't make much sense to me.  I'm not sure how the original recipe creator was able to saute each side for 10 minutes in butter on "med/high heat" without burning or getting a fire alarm off.

My recommendation: Pan sear each side 3 minutes, oven 350 for 15-20 minutes. Use fond from pan to make a nice sauce to couple with chicken. Get some veggies and rice and you got yourself a complete meal

Very good and very easy! I am disappointed that some would give it poor ratings saying "it isn't a 'recipe', and anyone who would need this recipe isn't 'a cook'." That's quite condescending and unnecessary. Sometimes, even good cooks need a reminder of some easy and tasty dinner ideas. We all thought it was delicious. Thank you!

Just awesome. I used real garlic and a ton of it.  Also chopped an onion up and sautÃ©ed  it in butter with all the garlic before i pit the chicken in.  I rubbed the seasoning onto the chicken as well and it was delicious.  My man loved it.

Made this for dinner tonight exactly as written. I used thin cut chicken breasts to cut down on cooking time. When the chicken was almost done I tried a bite and did end up adding 2tsp of minced garlic (the kind in the jar) and I also had some garlic herb butter and threw a couple of pads in at the end. Swirled it around in the garlic chunks and herb butter right before serving. We loved it. Served with Rice So Nice recipe also from this site. Will make again!

This was so easy and delicious. After chicken was done, added 3tbsp of butter to pan, 3 tbsp of flour to make a roux, then slowly added a can of chicken broth to make gravy. use more or less of the broth to make the gravy as thick as you like it. Yummy

So easy and tasty!  Strange that something so simple would lead to such rave reviews, but my husband said it was the best chicken I've ever made!   This will definitely be added to our regulars.

Was this fancy? No. Would I make it for a dinner party? No. Was it super easy and tasty enough for a weeknight meal when the fridge and pantry were bare? YES! Didn't measure the spices, just sprinkled all over the chicken and had no problem with saltiness. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans. Dinner done!

Perfect. It's perfect. The only tiny changes I made were doubling the sauce so we had some "gravy" for mashed potatoes and using gf soy sauce since we're both celiacs. Amazing, fast, tasty - Perfect!

I am someone who wants to be in love with cooking. My obstacle is that I am horrible when it comes to cooking any type of chicken or fish dish.  This looked so easy until I HAD to try it.  It was so simple and so good.  I used olive oil in place of the butter, but my dish was succulent and juicy.  Thanks so much for helping me to fall in love with cooking.

This chicken was pretty bland -- and not in an, Oh, how refreshing to have some chicken that isn't super spicy! kind of way. It was just...bland. I'm generous with my seasonings, so I know it wasn't that. I even made the gravy by deglazing the pan that some of the previous reviewers mentioned, but that was bland as well. While I didn't have to run out and buy a pizza, it won't be going in the regular rotation.

My whole family loved this (and that never happens)!  I followed the suggestions to use fresh onion and simmered the chicken in broth after browning.  I made a gravy at the end and everyone just gobbled it up.

I found that there was not enough liquid in this for the chicken to cook in, it kept sticking to the pan. There was also not much flavor, as I even added minced garlic to try to pump it up. I agree with another reviewer that said this is an ok recipe for people just learning to cook. If I make this again it will be with many additions and alterations.

eh...You get what you "pay" for. The amount of time invested is gunna determine the amount of quality in the taste of your food apparently.  I really wanted to like this recipe to no avail  I couldve saved my self the calories (and the stentch and mess) and just tossed the chicken in a baking dish with chicken broth instead.  I don't believe in altering a recipe then rating it based on own changes, so i followed to a T. Too bland.

True to it's name in all respects.  Gets a 5 for that but also the flavor is there.  I had to debone my own chicken and I made stock from that at the same time, so double duty chicken, love that.  Looked like lots of yummy goodness that could be deglazed in the pan also, for a sauce or gravy although I didnt.  Thanks for sharing!

When you are short on time, this is a quick and very tasty recipe.  I went heavier on the spices and used jarred garlic, and garlic pepper instead of powder.

UPDATE:
Found this recipe again on 3/9/14.  This time I used real onion and real garlic, and it made a huge difference.  I also made a sauce out of the pan drippings and some chicken broth and a little butter, using heavy cream as my thickener to keep the dish low carb.  It was very, very good this time.

So fast and delicious! I did tweak it a little bit. Swapped out half of the butter for olive oil, and i didn't have any seasoning salt on hand so I used half a teaspoon of salt with 1/4 tsp of cajun seasoning and 1/4 tsp celery salt. I also added 1/2 an onion and 1 clove of garlic and some worcestershire sauce. Yummmm

Very good and very simple.  Nothing overpowering.  I served with a packaged gravy to which I added a tiny amount of white wine vinegar and mashed potatoes, along with corn.  

I have all the spices on hand all the time so this will be a good go to meal.

This was just that... a good easy chicken. This tasted exactly what I been making for years as the old plain chicken dinner except mine isn't as greasy since I use 2 Tbsp EVOO. In my dish, I always just used seasoning salt, only. In this dish, I barely noticed the garlic or onion powders. So, I would call this A Good Easy Chicken no garlic!

Excellent!  I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, added Mrs. Dash, seasoned pepper, black pepper, omitted the garlic salt and viola!  It was fab.  Made the gravy per Mamajudd's direction and it was a big hit with the family.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was a great dish! I wasn't sure that I would like the garlic but it came out perfect. I did not have onion salt but the rest was just enough.

Great Chicken! I added about two tablespoons of olive oil to the pan and melted the butter in the olive oil. I also added fresh garlic and onion. I took chicken out and set aside, and took another reviewers suggestions by then add 3T butter and melt it, add 3T flour and whisk to stir the flour and scrape up the chicken bits, the darker the rue the better, then whisk in about a cup and a half of chicken stock, more or less depending on how thick you like it.

So easy... so good!  I took some other reviewers advice and made a little gravy using chicken broth and instant flour with the pan drippings and I think that really made the dish.  I will certainly make this one again and again!

Just got done eating this.  Great, I rubbed the spices on before hand, dumped in some chicken broth and chopped up some garlic to saute with the chicken.  More or less just read the reviews and combined their suggestions and we found it really good.  I made gravy and thought it was a bit salty but oh well.

Super quick and easy and quite tasty. I sauteed some red peppers with this as well and had it with garlic mashed potatoes. Ate the cold chicken as leftovers the next day on a green salad with slivered almonds and apple pieces.

I liked the idea of this, but it was so ungodly salty, it was a good thing I had some rice to cut it. I wouldn't consider frying in butter a healthy option (baking in the oven takes the same amount of time and much less work), but the one thing I did like about the chicken was that it was very moist, despite having the saltiness of jerky.

Delish! I didn't use the seasoning salt, but instead just regular salt and pepper. I also added a little bit of worchestershire sauce as someone else suggested. Perfect combination!  Pounding the chicken first, also made it cook quick and it turned out wonderfully moist and tasty!

First of all, I can't believe this is really a 5 star recipe as simple as it looks, but low and behold, it surely is!!!!  I changed it just a bit as I had some leftovers I had to use up.  I fried up about 6 strips of bacon, removed them, crumbled them and added a bit of butter to the grease.  Combined the spices and rubbed them into the chicken and then fried in the butter/bacon grease.  The "guy" wanted gravy so I just added a can of chicken broth and a bit of flour; then stirred in the crumbled bacon bits.  Oh m'gosh - you MUST try this! Thank you SO much for an easy recipe.  I've made this 3 times in 3 weeks as I keep having a "craving"!

A great recipe for the busy cook.  Very basic, but very good!  I added just a little chopped garlic to the butter as it was melting.  Love the garlic in this house!

This was very good and easy to make.  I cooked the breasts on medium and noticed that the outside was forming a crust, which made me worry.  I used a thermometer and pulled the chicken out when it reached 170.  I might cook it a little lower next time.  As others suggested, I made a gravy using chicken broth and flour and served with mashed potatoes.  My teenage son raved about it!

This recipe can be described in 3 words: quick, easy, & tasty! I had some chicken tenders in the freezer and thought about deep frying them. I ran across this recipe and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did. This recipe is such a tasty alternative to deep frying. I did make one minor substitute. I cut the butter amount in half and added 2 tablespoons of olive oil to fry the chicken in. I will be using this recipe again and again.

This was fantastic! My family loved it & asked me to make it every week. I did use some reviewers suggestions: used real onion and garlic, simmered in chicken broth that I later thickened with cornstarch to make a sauce. I also cubed my chicken breasts before cooking. I mixed in cooked egg noodles with chicken and thickened sauce before serving.

This chicken was awsome!  I made it with fresh garlic and onion. I followed the advise of other reviewers and added chicken stock & let the chicken simmer until done.  Then I removed the chicken and made a rue.  It made the best gravy my whole family loved it. I will be making this a regular at my house.

This recipe is VERY good for the amount of time it takes to make.  Really good meal if you dont have time to make something and you still want a really good meal.  I added some flour to the sauce to thicken it and it tasted great with some mashed potatos!  Will make many more times to come.  Thanks!

Kinda dry, but that might have been my fault as the chicken I used was still half frozen. The spices were good - especially after I added paprika and italian seasonings :)

This chicken was fantastic and SO EASY!  This coming from a mom of 4 which includes a set of 5 yr old triplets who loved it as well.  I also listened and made the gravey with it which was wonderful as well.  I will definately be passing this recipe along and making it again and again.

I took the advice of another reviewer and browned the chicken, then added chicken broth and cooked over medium heat until done. I made a roux by mixing approximately 1 c. cold water with 1 T. flour, then stirred it into the remaining chicken broth. The chicken ended up being VERY moist. I served this over spaghetti noodles, but will try serving over mashed potatoes next time (just didnâ€™t feel like making them this time around :) ).

Very good recipe! I used much of the advice from other users though. I started out by rubbing the chicken down with the spices and letting it sit for 30 minutes prior to cooking. I also added a small amount of chicken stock after the chicken had cooked for about five minutes. When the chicken was done, I made the gravy suggested (2tbs butter, 3tbs flour, remaining can chicken stock) and it turned out great. I served the gravy over the chicken and mashed potatoes and added a side of green beans. A quick, easy, and wonderfl meal!

YUMMY, It was so flavorful and the house really smelled wonderful while it was cooking. I too used the pan drippings and made gravey to which I added a cup of mushrooms and put over rice for a side dish we loved it. It was a hit in my house and I will be making it again. Thanks.

I made this one evening when there was not much time to prepare dinner. It is a very quick meal and taste great. I also made the gravy as I saw others did in the reviews. It went wonderfully with mashed potatoes and I just opened up a can of peas to go with it. If you decide to make the gravy just take the chicken out of the pan leaving behind all the juices. Add 3Tbsp of flour and 3 Tbsp butter and make the rue. After your flour has browned add in some chicken stock.

This recipe by its self was just ok but I felt like it was missing something. However, I did give it 4 stars because I made the gravy like others suggested- It definitly made the chicken.  (for gravy: After chicken cooked I sauted mushrooms, onion and garlic and added it to the chicken dripping along with chicken broth and flour) Oh I also allowed for the seasonings to sit on the chicken for about 30 minutes before cooking.

A great basic recipe.  Followed reviewers tips and created a gravy.  My husband said it was the gravy that made it.

Thanks for the recipe. This was very good and so easy. I didn't have season salt, so I used a little Monterey Chicken seasoning and it turned out great. I will definitely be making this again, and again and again.

It was my first recipe from this site that I tried, and it came out great! I would probably adjust it a bit more to give myself a bit more freedom in playing with the recipe, but it's a great starter!

A family favorite for us-all seven of us agreed that we LOVE this recipe (and so do the kid's friends.) I always pound the chicken and cut up into bite size pieces-smells incredibl! I always serve butter noodles as the side dish-ONE OF THE BEST RECIPES ON THIS SITE.

This recipe sounds delicious. I had the idea that perhaps putting some fresh garlic cloves in olive oil and letting it flavor the oil and then removing it to sautee, but I've yet to try it, I'll get back to you.

Really good, next time I will use fresh onion and garlic and a little less season salt.  It was too salty for my taste and I like to have things a little fresher.  Very good!

I was worried about how flavorful it was going to be only have the spices sprinkled on one side of the chicken, but it turned out EXCELLENT.  My fiance couldn't get enough.  I will definitely be cooking this again.

A simple, yet delicious recipe!  I read previous reviews before making it, so I skipped the onion powder and used diced onions instead.  At first it seemed like too much butter, but after flipping the chicken once and adding the onions it worked out perfectly.  This makes a delicious meal when combined with rice and steam vegetables!

This was pretty tasty. The only things I did different were that I omitted the butter and I baked it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees and covered it with foil. Came out tender and juicy, and it was healthy too!

I just finished making this recipe..very simple..i used MOST of the same ingredients but with the butter i added minced garlic. and for the seasonings i used garlic salt and Mrs Dash's chicken rub and omitted the seasoned salt. I also made a gravy for it. I used cream of chicken and just a squeeze of lemon for zing. I served it over white rice and green beans for the side...YUMMY!!!!!!!! and so easy!!!!!!

This was very yummy and easy.  I also bought some seasoned bread crumbs and coated the chicken breasts with them in addition to the spices.  The bread crumbs soaked up the butter that I cooked the chicken in and gave it a yummy buttery flavor.  Will do this one again.

This chicken turned out way to dry for my liking. Also, the flavor was very bland. I ended up simmering the chicken in cream of mushroom soup, white wine, and milk. The taste was then very good.

I added real onions and some seasoned salt along with everything. THIS IS MY FAVORITE!

I cook the onions until they are see-through and then I add them at the end of my cooking time when the chicken is brown. Serve with rice. YUM!

I think I've cooked this several times already. A favorite for lunch or dinner:)

This is a fast, easy and tasty way to fix chicken.  I used boneless thighs and increased the cooking time until the chicken was nice and brown. I'll use this recipe again! Thanks Julia, for a good easy recipe.

A great way to prepare chicken for a quick dinner. I sprinkle a little paprika for an added taste and nice color and use olive oil instead of butter. Serve with rice pilaf and some veggies and you're golden.

OMGosh! This was wonderful. I used Garlic Garlic (a product from Tastefully Simple(R)) instead of garlic seasoning and we really enjoyed the flavor on this recipe and will definitely be making it again. YUM! Thanks for sharing!

Yummmm... I used one of those McCormick chicken seasonings instead of seasoning salt.  I served it with pasta alfredo.  No leftovers!

Easy and delicious but quite tricky because it can burn easily if the chicken breast is too thick!

I used these spices on 2 chicken breasts but didn't measure the amounts so I probably used more than it called for.  Also, I just used Pam spray instead of butter or olive oil and covered it while cooking.  My husband and I both thought this was AWESOME and will make again when we need something quick and tasty.

I just made this recipe and for a quick and simple meal...it works out great. In less than 15 minutes dinner is ready. 

I threw the chicken in once the butter started bubbling coved it immediately then waited a couple a minutes then flipped..once both sides were browning i lowered the heat added a few tablespoons water and covered it. I have made similar recipes before and this chicken goes well with an alfredo sauce :)It's not a gourmet meal but if its a quick meal you want go for it!

I really really liked this recipe.  Both for its ease in preparing and for its taste.  I seasoned the chicken on both sides before adding to pan.  I then removed the chicken after cooking and followed another suggestion and made gravy with chicken broth and flour to put on some egg noodles to go with the chicken.  It was great!

This chicken turned out great! I added another tablespoon of butter once I flipped the chicken to keep it from getting dry. It turned out much better than I had expected. My husband loves it and requests it often now, good thing its quick and easy. It does make a bit of a mess and you need to be care full not to burn your self on the butter that splatters when you turn the chicken. 
Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great quick and easy meal! The only thing I did different was 1 tsp. butter & 2 tsp. of olive oil. I didn't want to change to much in case it would really alter the flavor, I think next time i'll probaly just use 3 tsp of olive oil instead. I'll definitly keep this recipe handy.

I had never cooked anything but grilled cheese sandwiches before. This is the perfect starter recipe for chicken lovers. It is simple, requires common ingredients, and needs almost no prep time (even less than it says). Plus it is a basic recipe, so you can pair it with almost any side dish!

Just like it says - quick and easy.  Served with angel-hair pasta tossed w/olive oil, accompanied by a salad, it made a nice, fast dinner that we all loved!

To save time and calories, use George Forman grill.  That way you can leave out the butter & cut time.

Tasted great and very easy.  I mixed the seasonings together in a small bowl first so the flavor would be more even.

Wow!  What a simple recipe, with unlimited possibilities!  Tonight I was making Chicken Alfredo Pizza, but I wasnt sure how to make the chicken.  I wanted it to be quick and easy, and this recipe was my solution!  It turned out GREAT!  To me (and anyone with any sense!) the quick, easy, and delicious recipes are the keepers... and this one is definitely a keeper!  So simple yet delicious :) .

Wasn't to thrilled with this one overall-lacked flavor.  Think it would be better with olive oil and minced garlic.

I don't find this to be a recipe. It is more how to season and cook chicken in butter. I wish it made a sauce. My family wasn't impressed.

I know this may not be a fancy recipe but it is really good and so easy. I do make some more "in depth" recipes, but when I don't feel like doing much prepping I like to make this recipe. I did use a little EVOO along with the butter and added a bit of  black pepper, too. It was so good and juicy and I didn't have to do much after a tiring day. So "you go there" Julia. More power to ya.

Needed a recipe for some chicken breast that I had thawed out a day or two ago in refrigerator. This recipe came in handy, simple to make. My family was mad because I didn't cook enough chicken.  Thank you for the idea.

I love chicken, but I hate cooking it because it can be such a pain. This was so simple and sooooo tasty! My husband, who usually can't stand any kind of seasoning/spice on his food, ADORED this! He said that it was the best chicken he's ever had. Not to mention the fact that my house smelled amazing while I was cooking it! Thank you so much!!!

Good Easy Garlic Chicken Haiku: "Made it exactly - used all powders, nothing fresh. That made it 'easy.'" So many reviews used fresh garlic and onions rather than the dried powders, which really does make it a different recipe; I did as written, and it was entirely too salty. The timing was accurate, and I'm glad that I ate it w/ a green salad b/c the ranch dressing helped cut some of the saltiness. My 3-stars were for the no-fail easiness of the recipe, but it's unlikely that I'd make again.

Tried this recipe for dinner tonight and it was a huge hit! Easy to make and absolutely delicious, my families already demanding we make it again next week. I had a little extra butter and sauces left from making the chicken so we made an awesome gravy to pour over top of the chicken using just the left over ingredients. I highly recommend this dish for anyone whether your experienced in the kitchen or a beginner like me.

This was by far the best chicken I have EVER had in my life. . . Better than applebee's & red lobster!!! I did alter the recipe. What i did was is, i took my chicken and cut it down the side so the pieces would be slimmer. Then i took the Seasoned Salt & Garlic Powder (i did not measure it out, i coated it on the chicken from the container) and patted it onto the chicken. Then I chopped up an onion. I melted 3 tablespoons olive oil & 3 tablespoons of butter, then i threw in a spoonful of minced garlic (from the jar) & the onions then the chicken and it was cooked to perfection. This was so good, I could eat it over & over again!!!

Don't change a thing!  This recipe is great as is.  I recommend making a gravy from the drippings in the pan, otherwise it is a bit salty.  With the gravy it is SHEER HEAVEN and my family inhaled it!  This will be a weekly staple for me.

Made it  with fresh garlic and onion. Served it with mashed potatoes and a cous cous salad. The gravy on the potatoes and chicken was divine.

I tend to change this one up a lot.  It's really good for a basic back bone recipe but if you do what the instructions say, it comes out kind of bland.  I replaced the butter with vegetable oil so it was less greasy.  And I season the chicken before putting it in the oil.  I'm not sure that makes too much difference but I tend to change it every time I do it.

This was great.  Used olive oil instead of butter, and minced garlic/fresh onion instead of powder.  The kids loved it.  Will definitely make again.

The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is because I added gravy I already made after browning the chicken.  Also, used fresh onions and garlic as other reviewers did.  It was delicious and juicy.  We both loved it.

Good basic recipe.  Deglaze the pan with white wine add flour to thicken.  Add mushrooms if on hand. Gave it four stars because it is so easy and uses on hand ingredients.

This is truly one of the best recipes I've found on this site. I added some of my own caribbean flare to it and also did some of the other tips and tricks other posters advise on such as the chicken stock addition, and it came out beautifully. I chopped up some fresh garlic as I am a garlic lover and added it on top of my chicken when it was finished. I eat this almost every night, it's that good. One thing I would adjust is the cooking time of the meat. It really depends on how thick your chicken breasts are. If they are really thick, 10-15 minutes on each side isn't going to cut it.You need to let it cook for anywhere between 50-60 minutes for it to cook properly, and this also depends on your stove settings. Other than that, great recipe and good job on the post!

I too took ideas from other reviewers. I used fresh garlic, onions and chives. A bit of olive oil and 2 table spoons of butter. Once the chicken was cooked through, drained juice but was careful to keep onions. Added 2 cups/16 oz. of chicken broth. simmered another ten. Broth was easy to make into gravy with a bit of cornstarch. will make it again.

This was my first time cooking chicken.  EVER.  I was hoping it would turn out great because in the instructional video, as she was cutting it it was so moist, tender, and juicy.  The flavor was awesome but it just wasn't moist and juicy AT ALL.  I don't know if there's a certain technique to cooking it so that it becomes tender and juicy, but I even had a hard time cutting it! :(

Such a good recipe! I read through the comments and made my own modifications. I didn't have any flour to try the gravy idea, or onions for the recipe. However, I cooked thin chicken breast in a pan with extra virgin olive oil and fresh garlic. I cooked one side and flipped it, then put the stove on a low heat and covered the pan for about 20 minutes. This kept the chicken juicy and flavorful. I served it over brown rice and string beans! Yum!!

Yum! This was really good. I pounded my chicken flat so they would  cook quicker. This was a great quick weeknight meal. I used the leftover breasts in chicken alfredo, it worked great. Thanks!

My family raved over this very simple recipe.  I did add a cup of chicken broth while cooking the meat, then thickened it remaining juices with flour and added 1/2 cup sour cream and made a sauce that was perfect for pasta.  I will make this again!

A very good, basic recipe for seasoning chicken. I skipped the butter & grilled my chicken-delish! Update-I make this regularly now on the stovetop & def use the butter! Sooooo delish. Love the outer "crust" it develops. Thank you for a favorite chicken recipe!!

This recipe is exactly as the title states. It usually take me longer to make the sides than it does this main dish.

Very juicy and tender. Did use an extra tablespoon of butter. Being a woman who is constantly "on-the-go," I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was awesome.  Followed one suggestion to add more butter, some flour and broth and make a sauce.  My wife loved it.  So easy.

Really simple but REALLY good! I always have this stuff on hand and it was WAY YUMMY. I pounded my breast flat (well, the chicken's breast, technically) and  it cooked very quickly. I took the breast out of the pan and quickly seared some red bell pepper strips in the pan juices and had some noodles... awesome!

I made this last night, very easy and tasty. I used 2 cloves of freshly minced garlic in the melted butter before adding the chicken to the pan, (I also used chicken breast tenderloins - which was all the meat needed for just the hubby and I) then I made the gravy as MAMAJUDD suggested, served with rice and green beans. This will be my go to recipe when looking for a fast way to get chicken night dinner done!

Great fall back recipe when I can't figure out what to make for dinner. When my kids and I are back in the evenings from practice, I can make this in minutes and they are all happy...  I use this chicken for anything from last minute pastas tosses, to fajitas. Simply adjust the seasonings to suit the recipe calling for chicken.

Good, quick, and extremely easy! I am a beginner cook and even on the first try it turned out amazing. Make sure you get fresh chicken breast for a nice and tender chicken. I also served it with a little parsley, and took others' advice and made extra sauce. Amazing over basmati rice! Cooking them together smelled soo good I couldn't wait to try it. I will definitely do it again!

I just tried this recipe tonight and it was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!! I was worried because at first it didn't look to appetizing, but after the first bite it all changed!! I used all fresh ingredients. I used chopped garlic and a fresh onion and also some extra virgin olive oil to keep the chicken from becoming stuck to the bottom of the pan. I used the left over garlic and onion as a topping which was great also. This is such a quick and easy recipe but you do have to make sure the chicken is cooked through, that was my toughest time. I will deffinately make this a weekly dinner. I'm the pickiest eater ever so I can definately promise this is a "picker eater" friendly recipe! JULIA - TWO THUMBS UP! Thank You!!

This chicken was quite good, but I will cut down the seasoning salt next time. I am a salt lover, but this was even too salty for me. But the chicken turned out SO JUICY AND SO TENDER!!! My boyfriend rarely gives 5 stars, but he wanted me to give this an 8. I used the Balsamic Cream Sauce on this site on top of the chicken and on top of mashed potatoes. I'm sure I'll be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly. After the chicken was cooked, I removed it from the pan and used the same pan to make the "Balsamic Cream Sauce" from this site. Served over whole wheat noodles and asparagus. Fantastic recipe. This was recommended to me by MakeItEasy4Me. Thank you, great recipes. 3/8/10 Made this again tonight it is so easy and tasty. Made the Balsamic Cream Sauce again and Artichoke Mashed Potaotes and green beans. We really enjoyed this meal.

As a total beginner cook, this recipe was so helpful & simple! My bf & I just moved in to our own place so I am trying to find easy recipes to make for dinner every night. He loved the chicken. Instead of onion powder, I chopped up some real onion and threw it in the pan.

This is ok. It is a basic recipe, one similiar to what I've used for a long time, but needs a little more zing. Except that I don't pan fry much because of cals and added fats; I've always used water to keep chicken from burning. Took a tip and duh used chicken broth and worked much better.

Very easy. Not bad. I would use more garlic though next time. I baked mine in the oven and used non stick spray. I'm sure it would have tasted better in the skillet with loads of butter, but for how I fixed it it came out fine. The family liked this dish.

Mom Friendly + Kid Friendly= Yummy!  I have large family so I didn't bother measuring because we like all the ingredients anyway.  I just made sure I used more garlic powder than the rest of the spices.  Served the classic southern meal of mashed potatoes and fresh green beans for a comfort food kinda night!

I absolutely loved this recipe! I am not a big cook, so this recipe was perfect for me...very simple! I put garlic and onion powder on the chicken before cooking it, and used olive oil to cook it instead of butter, along with some garlic and chopped up onion. Then once the chicken was done cooking, I added some butter to the pan and scraped up the chicken scrapes, and added some flour to make a roux, like other viewers have suggested. Then added some chicken broth to make a gravy for the chicken! It turned out really good! I also made some mashed potatoes to go along with the chicken and gravy! Definitely will be makin this again!! Awesome recipe!!

Absolute perfect recipe that can be made with common ingredients found around the house.  Tastes delicious and flavorful, without a ton of work and effort.  Follow the suggestions of other reviewers and try to punch it up a little with gravy, or additional seasonings.  It's a great basic recipe that can be modified to suit individual tastes with the addition of a few ingredients.  This chicken is among my go to recipes for when I'm short on time and not sure what to make.

Awesome quick dinner.  I followed other reviewers advice and after browning I added a can of chicken stock and then thickened up the sauce with a little flour.  Served over egg noddles.

Instead of using garlic powder & onion powder I used 3 tbsp of minced garlic and I sauteed 1/2 onion slivers on the side. I didn't make a gravy like most of the other reviewers did, I just topped the chicken with the onions. I believe fresh is always better--- BUT the simplicity of this dish makes me give it 5 stars.

This is a really easy recipe to make...However I used minced garlic from the can and I sed fresh onions. (I also used onion salt b/c chicken needs salt for taste) After cooking it I put 1 cup of chick broth and let it simmer for almost 30 mins while my cheesy rice finished! I then used the juice and made gravy. THis was a great gravy. it was quick and this is a recipe if you tweak it!!! Will be using it again!

Used as directed except used Chicken Tenderloins and didn't cook as long on each side and sprinkled the seasoning on each one... Mmm was a perfect simple recipe for me and I'm a beginner cook! My boyfriend just loved this chicken!

So good. Definitely a keeper! Even my picky 5 year old brother liked it! I used one half chopped fresh onion instead of powder and took the advice of several other reviewers and added 8 oz. can chicken broth, 2 Tbsp. corn starch, and 1 1/4 c. cold water (all added after the chicken was done and removed from pan). This made an excellent gravy for the chicken and white rice.

I followed this recipe, and tossed in half a diced onion and some minced garlic, and it was really dry and bland.  I was really disappointed. I don't understand why this has gotten such high reviews!

I made this almost exactly as the directions said to (I added 1 cup of chicken broth and let it simmer in there, per someone else's comment) and my family LOVED it! I thought it was pretty good, my husband said, "this is the BEST chicken I have ever had!"... wow! I was happy that it was made with things that I had in my pantry already. VERY fast, easy, and handy- thanks!!!!

I made this for the first time yesterday and it was gobbled up. I took the advice of MAMAJUDD and made the gravy, she was definitely right when saying that the gravy just makes the chicken. How can you go wrong when you get up all the bits from the pan and make them into gravy to put over the chicken and mashed potatoes (in our case). This is definitely a keeper, so easy to make and absolutely delicious. My son did comment that "the spice was ok" but he refused to try it with the gravy.

My husband gave it a 3, 10 year old a 4.  I liked it.  I followed others suggestions and dusted with flour and used chicken broth.  At the end I add more broth and cooked down and added some corn start.  I served with no yolk egg noodles.  I will try it again.

This was delicious and smelled great while cooking. I sliced the breasts so they were pretty thin to eliminate the "too chickeny" taste. Definitely a keeper in this house.

As per other reviews, I used fresh garlic and onion. After browning the chicken on both sides, I poured some chicken broth and let it reduce on medium. Boyfriend seemed to like it a lot!

This was a huge hit in our house!  I started out the recipe as written, after browning the chicken on both sides I added some minced garlic and sauted that for a couple minutes, then I added a can of chicken broth and let it simmer for about 20 minutes.  After the chicken was cooked I added about an ounce of cream cheese and stirred until mixed and then let it simmer until thickened.  The sauce was full of the flavors of all the seasonings!  YUM!!!

Very tender...used fresh garlic and onion instead and added chicken broth and flour after chicken browned a little..might have actually had more flavor if I had used the powdered spices

I also changed this a bit following some of the other reviewers. I used a lot of minced garlic and chopped onion to saute with the chicken which I cut up in 1 X 4 inch pieces. I let it all get browned up (it took quite a while!) then added 1 cup chicken broth and 1/8 cup flour to thicken it up and cooked it all the way through. Next time hubby wants me to add some lemon juice for "zing" and brown the sauce a bit more. The longer the chicken sat in the sauce, the better it was. Seconds were even better!! Will try again with these modifications. Thanks!!

Outstanding!  I made this for the first time last night and I loved how simple it was. I had two large pieces of meat, so the only thing I will change next time is I will probably flatten my chicken with a mallet and use some olive oil with the butter to cut back on fat.  but the great thing about this is the efficency of the recipe, so for me, the powdered spices were just fine.  the garlic powder permeates the meat during cooking and I got a deep brown crust on the chicken.  Great!

I made this tonight and even though it was easy I didn't find it to be the big hit I was hoping it would be. Just so/so.  Sorry, I wont be making this again. I would rather make Jennys grilled chicken breasts from this site. Now, that is easy and DELISH!

I used garlic powder & herbs. I sauteed shallots & garlic in olive oil. Then browned chicken & grated pecorino cheese on chicken. Add 1/2 c. chicken broth & simmer. Once cooked down, add another 1/2 c. chicken broth & 1/4 c. white wine. When chicken is cooked, take off, grate more pecorino cheese on it & cover. Whisk ~2T corn starch in 1 c. chicken broth & add to pan to thicken sauce. Serve sauce over wide egg noodles & serve chicken on top. My husband loved this!

JUST GOT DONE WITH DINNER AND THE FAMILY LOVED THIS CHICKEN ! I ADDED CHCKEN LEGS TO THE RECIPE SINCE "I THINK BREAST IS A LITTLE DRY" ALSO I DID FOLLOW A FEW SUGGESTIONS FROM SOME OF THE REVIEWERS. INSTEAD OF GARLIC POWER, I USED REAL GARLIC AND CHOPPED IT UP REAL FINE POURED IT OVER THE CHICKEN WITH FINE CHOPPED YELLOW ONION.  IN A SEPERATE SMALL SAUCE PAN I ADDED SOME OF THE BUTTER JUICE THAT WAS COOKING WITH THE CHICKEN, AND 1/4 CUP OF FLOWER, (MORE SALT) WHISKED IT OVER A LOW FLAME UNTIL IT WAS LIKE GRAVY.  POURED IT OVER THE CHICKEN 10 MIN BEFORE IT WAS DONE. IT WAS SPECTACULAR !!! QUICK & EASY. I SERVED IT WITH BOILED CARROTS & GREEN BEANS, AND SCALLOPED POTATOES THAT I ALSO GOT A RECIPE FOR ON THIS SITE.
WA LA!! DINNER IS SERVED....

THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE WILL USE AGAIN!

I am not much of a cook at all but when i made this last night, my husband thought it was fantastic! i just made a few changes. i diced up some onions and jalapeno stuffed olives and sauteed that first in the skillet with olive oil and butter. while that was going on, i put adobo (all purpose seasoning), garlic powder, ground ginger, Italian seasoning, and lemon pepper seasoning on the chicken and then put it in with the onions and olives. i know it sounds like a lot but it came out so good!! and that's saying a lot coming from someone who has messed up hamburger helper!! thanks for the recipe.

I added some fresh chopped garlic & onions along with garlic salt, garlic powder, onion powder & pepper. I used 2 tbs of butter and some EVOO. I covered the pan and when the chicken was brown I added 1/2 a can of chicken broth. I uncovered for the last 10 minutes.

I thought this recipes was wonderful and a healthier choice than fastfood as another reveiwer pointed out. I would have given a 5 but my husband thought it was a 3 based on the fact that he likes high calorie unhealthy foods. I can't believe him. Anyway it will be a part of our menu. Thanks so much for sharing.

As suggested by other readers, I used real garlic.  Everyone loved it (except the four year old but he's uber picky).  Definitely in my dinner rotation!

Wow, I did this the other night. But I just thought it up on my own. Mine was just a little different. I added fresh garlic and onion, black pepper and added a tiny bit of honey.Put it over rice. IT was good. ^_^

I really enjoyed this. I followed SKD1983's  suggestions to rub the spices directly onto the chicken, use fresh garlic and olive oil in addition to the butter, and add chicken broth and flour to make delicious sauce. I also added mushrooms in the beginning and cooked them along with the chicken, then I removed the cooked chicken and stirred the sauce with the mushrooms. It was really yummy; I served it over some casarecce with a side of green beans.

I'm not sure what went wrong with this considering I followed the recipe exactly, but mine ended up being very unappetizing. It vaguely reminded me of high school cafeteria chicken. I had combined all the seasonings and rubbed it on the chicken and also followed other users' suggestions to make a gravy, which I served over mashed potatoes. Not sure what that problem was, but thanks anyway!

This was pretty good. I added extra spices to give it a little more kick. It tasted better on the second day. The only problem was it got a little dry and burned a bit in the pan. Next time I'll put some chicken broth in the pan when I flip them over.

This was quick, easy and delicious!  I did not measure the onion powder or garlic powder I just sprinkled generously on both sides.  The gravy was a nice bonus.  Both my kids loved too!

This recipe made me feel like a goof!  It's so simple, but at the end of the sauteing I had to scrape the blackened seasoning off the breasts.  My stove is very hot and I was cooking the chicken almost on low.  On the bright side, it still tasted good (great blend of spices) with the spices scraped off and it was quite juicy!  Next time I will try adding the spice blend almost at the end so it won't burn or else use chopped up chicken breast so it cooks faster.  After the chicken was done, I put it in the oven to stay warm, wiped out the skillet, sauted 2 T butter with a teaspoon and a half of the seasoning blend for about 30 seconds, then stirred in half a cup of milk, a cup of water and a chicken bouillon cube.  When it came to a boil, I stirred in 2 T corn starch mixed with 2 T cold water.  This made a very tasty gravy to go on the noodles and complimented the flavor of the chicken.  I will make this again with the changes so it will work on my stove. Thanks!

We make this ALL. THE. TIME. It is quick, easy, and very yummy. And it's easy to make a lot!  When the chicken is done we sautee onions in the pan juices, then add chicken broth and flour to make gravy.

Very tasty. I tossed in some onion, mushrooms, and yellow pepper and I loved it. Update: I tried another version of this including the sauce other users suggested. I added some pepper, onion flakes, onion salt instead of powder, and minced garlic, plus a sprinkle of grated parmesan on each side and didn't use any salt. My brother said, "! This is good." High praise from a brother!

This was easy and good just as the name says. Made gravy from a packaged gravy mix. Served with suddenly salad, a house salad, & toasted Italian bread slices.

This was absolutely fan-freakin-tastic! I used real chopped onions instead of powder and I followed the suggestions of others and made the gravy to go with it. I cooked the onions in butter for a couple mins before adding the chicken. And when making the gravy I used Wondra to thicken it. Delish!

I made this recipe, but with fresh onions/garlic and chicken broth that I made a gravy with. 

I served it with mashed potatoes, spinach and corn.

It was delicious, my husband had seconds!

This was a very flavorful chicken!  My husband has requested I make this more often. I am just thrilled it was so quick and easy. I served it with rice and steamed mixed veggies. Dinner in 20 minutes - can't beat that!

This is great for a quick fix. I used a thinnly sliced chicken and cooked for half the time. I didn't have onion powder so I used less onion salt.

(original review)This was just okay to me. It was really quick and easy, but it was very bland. Maybe I didn't use enough spices. I did make the gravy that other reviewers had suggested-that made it better. I will probably only make this when I dont have time or ingredients to make anything better. ***update*** This was so much better than the first time I made it. I must be more experienced! I didn't make any changes other than cutting the chicken into tender sized pieces (and adjusting the cooking time)and I still made the gravy (yummy!)

It was good. I did not have onion powder, so I used onion salt and did not use seasoning salt. I also added some chop garlic to it my husband loved that. It turned out a little dry. Other then that it was fine. I think I will make it again.

I couldn't believe how simple this was to make! Like others, I didn't measure out the spices, I just sprinkled them on as needed. I also didn't follow the time exactly. Some pieces took more/less time to cook, so I kept a close watch because they can burn easily if left unattended! All in all a great recipe! Thanks!

Exactly as it says, quick and easy!  I didn't actually measure the ingredients, I just coated the chicken and cooked it in the electric skillet until done.  I did use a yummy garlic butter (from this site) that I had handy in the refrigerator, in place of plain butter, and that added a nice zip to this as well, but I'm sure regular butter would be fine.

Didn't look like much but was really tasty and easy! I sort of abandoned the exact measurements of the seasoning and just sprinkled more over wherever I thought the seasoning hadn't covered before, but only the garlic powder and onion so it didn't come out overly salty at all. I'll probably make this again :)

Good chicken dish. Very simple. The different spices get really infused into the chicken. Watch out for too much seasoned salt as its easy to think there's not enough and you end up with really salty chicken. I served it with plain long grain white rice.

Thought this was good, and very easy.  Made as is and served with rice.  We seem to need to define "hot" because  mine burned very easily, and I agree that burned garlic is just not good.  I think I'd like to try turning down the temp and cooking the non-garlic side until almost done, then flip and cook the garlic side just enough to finish cooking and get a bit of crispness.

An excellent choice for a quick and tasty meal for the family - not necessarily something I would serve to guests.  Chicken appearance not great but very good flavor and good as leftovers.

Pretty good chicken recipe--very quick & easy, that's for sure! I would definitely make a side with it...maybe rice or pasta. I added 1/2 packet of onion soup mix to my spices which added a ton of flavor & and oniony pop!

I made this dish when we had friends over the other night and it was raved about by all!  So simple and tasty this dish can be a main course for dinner, an quick and easy lunch or even a snack (if you reduce the portions).  Thanks for this recipe which I will be making time and time again.

Yummy yummy! I needed a meal but didn't have too much in the cupboard, this was perfect! I had to substitute the seasoning salt and onion powder with onion salt, but it still did the trick.

This was very easy and tasty.  Just be careful not to burn the spices if your pan is too hot.  Nothing's worse than burnt garlic.  My fault though for not watching the pan carefully in the beginning.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe was really quick, easy, and yummy.  I used smaller pieces of chicken and it took half the time so be careful not to overcook the chicken!

What a great quick and tasty way to prepare chicken! Perfect for busy work days! I made it exactly as written. This one's gonna be a regular. Just a note: You may want to make sure your skillet is good and hot before you put the chicken in. That way you get a nice crispy crust on the outside. Yum. Next time, I think I'll try making the sauce suggested by a previous reviewer. Thanks Julia!

I realized at the last minute that I was out of garlic powder. I used 2t. onion powder, 1/2t. seasoned salt and 1/2t. garlic salt (which is less seasoning than the recipe calls for). My kids and I loved it, but still found it slightly salty. I would decrease the amount of salt next time I make this.

I used a lot less butter (and mixed it with a little oil) and used freh onion and garlic.  After blackening the garlic and onion on the chicken, I transferred the pan to finish off at 375 for about 20 minutes.  I served it with steamed rice and fresh veggies.  I can't believe how my man raved over this simple dish. I have never seen him more excited about a dish.

Very easy chicken dish!  I also used some chopped onion and garlic in addition to the powders.  After the chicken was cooked, I removed it from the pan, added flour to the butter in the pan and made a roux, then added about a cup of chicken broth to make a gravy - yummy!  I will definitely make this again.

very taste dish.  i did what others suggested and used real garlic and onion instead of the powders.  i added chicken broth and flour for gravy as suggested by someone as well.  turned out very well.  i chopped zucchini, red pepper and asparagus and steamed them to serve with the chicken.  i think next time i'll even make a little white rice to go along with the meal.

i always grab my "easy" recipies from this site and this one was EXTREMELY easy and very tasty. the only variatons that i made to it was that i put some flour in a deep dish and added my spices (i used garlic and onion powder and lowrys chicken rub) right in the flour and mixed all that together and then i coated each piece of chicken with that mixture...then sauteed the breasts in butter. Very tasty...i will definetly make this more often. Thanks for the recipe Julia  :o)

WONDERFUL AND EASY!  We love it!  Goes really well with GoodAsparagus, steamed squash, onion, and green pepper, and a cut up onion.  For leftovers, get tortillas and make steamed veggies and chicken wraps.

I did like some others and added chopped up onion instead of onion powder.  I also had to keep adding chicken broth.  But, this was amazingly tasty and EASY.  My children both commented on it which is RARE.

Very good.  I cooked mine for more like 20 minutes per side (on medium heat), added chicken broth to keep the meat moist, and threw in some fresh mushrooms.  This went over very well with my husband, thanks again Julia.

Pretty good if you need a fast, easy recipe.  I did rub the spices into both sides of the chicken.  I also needed more than just the 3 tablespoons of butter, so I added peanut oil.  My son that doesn't care for meat much liked it when it was hot.

this was really good and very easy. however, i wouldn't recommend keeping leftovers for more than 2 days in the fridge, as mine got kind of gross.

I would like to say that this recipe was good, quick and easy to make. They would taste good as chicken sandwiches. I would make this again if I were short on time.

We all loved it! It is very easy to make. For me being a mother of two little ones it was especially helpful. The chicken just fries slowly in the pan and meanwhile I can prepare side dishes or feed my 9 month old. Thank you for this easy to make recipe!!!

I cooked this in a little more than 3TBS butter in fear the chicken would be too dry.  Also, just shook on the garlic and season salt.  This was surprisingly very tasty!!!  It seemed to simple to be good.  Served with mac and cheese and a salad.  I cut some of the chicken up and added it to the salad and that was delish! I'll make this again!

Very easy to make - lots of flavoring (almost too much if not a fan of salty foods).  Used a little water to steam the chicken after they were sauteed (so they wouldn't dry out).  Otherwise very easy and yummy.

Excellent chicken.  Added chicken broth as some others have mentioned. Made gravy with the juices left over.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Gravy was great on chicken and potatoes.  Kids and husband ate it all!

Tried this recipe last night, and (though I was skeptical at first), it turned out great!  I used real chopped onion in place of onion powder (which I didn't have) and added some chicken broth toward the end because I was afraid it might be too dry.  Turned out really good.  And next time I think I'll substitute chicken broth for the butter entirely to cut down on fat. Great recipe!

Excellent!!!  I would love to try using some of this leftover chicken to make chicken salad or a casserole or something along those lines...but there is never any left!  A definite must for cooks who don't have a lot of time.

I made this recipe once for myself, with just one chicken breast, and it was very good.  My mom tried it and loved it and had me make it later for the whole family.  The second time I made it, I made about 5 or 6 breasts, and it was extremely messy!  I would make it again with just 1 or 2 breasts but never again a bunch of them.  Cleaning up took forever.

Pretty good recipe--I cut my chicken into smaller pieces so it didn't need to be sauteed for as long (more like 8 minutes each side).  Good flavor!

This was a quick, easy and delicious dinner.I only used the seasoned salt and the garlic powder. I was out of onion powder, but this came out good without it.  Will make again.

my head wasn't thinking straight tonight while i was preparing this dish. i accidentally defrosted chicken breast tenders instead of breast halves; added in 2 tablespoons of garlic from my jar of minced garlic instead of 2-4 teaspoons like i wanted in the first place... but, despite all of the mistakes this dish turned out fine. i added more of all the seasonings, and like mentioned, added in minced garlic. i cooked it all in the pan for about 10 minutes total, then sat it in a warm oven for about 10 more while i cooked some rice. the chicken was very tender, even for the chicken strips. this tastes just like any other garlic chicken i've prepared before, but i was pleased with the extreme quickness of the whole dish. will add this recipe to the collection!

This had to be the best and easiest recipe yet.  I cut the breasts into smaller pieces for easier eating.  The kids just couldn't get enough.  I will definitely make this one all the time.  Thanks for a recipe that saved me so much time on a very busy - no time to cook day !!

Quick and easy to make.  My 9 year old son and I loved it, but my husband wasn't that wild about it.  I will make it again, but add a bit more  garlic.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband uses Garlic Salt on EVERYTHING he eats (no joke) so I used about twice as much garlic salt as called for and also used a little pepper.  I found it very easy and quick to make.  He loved it!

We really liked the flavor and juicyness of this chicken. I doubled the ingredients to make it extra flavorful and used lots of butter so it would stay juicy and not burn in the pan. It was very quick to make.

I think this is a great recipe.  It is really good and easy to make.  Only took like five minutes.  The only reason "the kid friendly rating" got one star is because it is pretty spicy.  I LOVED it but I think it might be too much for kids.

This recipe was very tasty and so easy to make! I didn't have onion powder so I used paprika instead and it worked out. I also mixed all the ingredients and the chicken in a bowl first. This will become a meal I will make often. Thanks!

My entire family loved it...I admit I added less butter and a little more water and some minced garlic...it made a kid of gravy....my family fought over who had the last piece.....I would advise serving it with rice and garlic toast for the perfect family meal :-)

It's everything the title suggests: Good, easy, and garlic.  I was very happy to find this recipe.  It's the kind for a guy on the go.  (I didn't use the recommended measurements; I seasoned to my own taste.)

This stuff is so great! The tenderness and juiciness is great! I made this for a main dish at my friends's house the night before...to my surprise, it was PERFECTLY juicy the next day! :) (Even before I reheated in the oven)

I used extra amounts of seasoning to make it more flavorful, as well as some oregano.  I topped it with shredded mozarella cheese.  To speed up the cooking a bit, I butterfly-ed the chicken breasts halfway through cooking.

Used  fresh chopped onions and minced garlic instead of powder. Sautee onions and garlic until soft in butter and EVOO. Use sea salt and black pepper to season chicken, then cook until brown on both sides. Add 1/2 to 1 can of chicken broth and simmer until done, about 10 minutes.  Then add 1/4 tsp flour to thicken gravy. Will add mushrooms next time with onions and garlic. Excellent dish.

I used the suggstions to prepare it with a gravy using chicken broth and cornstarch. Brown the garlic and onion together in butter and olive oil, remove from the pan, brown the chicken on both sides, remove the chicken, add chicken broth and corn starch  and cook briefly, then add more chicken broth to get the desired thickness. Return the chicken and onion/garlic mixture to the pan and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. There is plenty of room for using your own ingredients or techniques. We are gluten free and low sodium, so the corn starch and low sodium chicken broth and a salt free chicken seasoning kept it diet friendly. I served with oven baked carrots, tiny new potatoes, and squash. Delicious, although not as quick as the original recipe. But then I wasn't in a hurry.

Used Adobo instead of seasoning salt and I never actually measure I just season the way I like and it turned out really well. Took longer to cook since I used bigger chicken breasts but Iâ€™ll definitely make this again.

I usually marinade chicken overnight to get flavor, but I did have the time. I found this recipe and tried it. It was perfect. The chicken was moist and flavorful.  This will definitely be a standby recipe.

My finished dish looks MUCH different than all the others in the photos. But that's because I changed it around a bit. I used fresh garlic and onions. Cooked them until soft then added chicken. Added the seasoning salt but it wasn't enough. I will double it next time. Cut chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces. I think I waited to long to add the chicken because the onions and garlic kind of cooked to nothing. You could taste them but not as much as it should have tasted. Added a can of cream of chicken soup and some chicken boullion granules...also a can of corn. Cooked til heated through then served over white rice. The finished meal was very tasty. We will make this again.

I did change it up after reading the reviews, using real onions and garlic as well as simmering the chicken in broth.  Came out tender and tasty.  Even my picky boyfriend enjoyed it.

It's so good and easy. I didn't make a sauce or anything like the other posters but I did pound the meat a little to make it thinner and I rubbed the seasoned salt and onion powder on the chicken. Instead of garlic powder I used minced garlic that I threw in with the butter. It's amazing over some buttered egg noodles!

Yum! I used chicken tenderloins and the cook time was about ten mins on the first side and about 4-5 minutes on the other side. I only used one tsp of garlic because my hubby doesnâ€™t like too much. My famously picky kids loved this!!

I wouldn't make any changes; for me, I used seasoning salt, minced onion and garlic salt and it turned out great so some of the seasoning is variable if you don't have on hand what the recipe asks for. Definitely will make again sometime!

Followed other suggestions, used olive oil and sautÃ©ed a little garlic and onion then also sprinkled the powder on the chicken.  Added a dab of butter and when the chicken was almost done added a little chicken broth.  Had very good flavor.

Amazing! I followed other reviewers on making gravy with it. Once chicken was cooked, I removed them from the skillet and added 1 cup of chicken broth to the butter, then 1/2 cup water mixed with 1/2 cornstarch. I then added a chopped sweet onion. I stirred until thickened and onion was cooked. Once the gravy was done, I added the chicken back in the gravy and coated the chicken in the gravy. Then served. It was amazing!!!

I rate it 4 stars as it really does need the liquid at the end as stated in many of the other reviews.  I used vegetable broth as that is all I had on hand.  But other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken tasted delicious.  I served it with saute'd veggies and hubby & college daughter loved it!

I made this at the start of my new low-calorie "no fast food diet"... and I loved it! It was super quick and easy - I'm a full time college student and my boyfriend works overnight so finding time to cook is pretty hard, but this took no time at all.

I did follow the advice of some other users, and tossed a handful of chopped onion into the pan when right after melting the butter. I also used a lot more of the seasonings the recipe called for, in addition to red pepper flakes for a little bit more of a kick.

All in all, I was super happy with how this recipe turned out and I'll definitely be making it again!

This is fast and easy and the chicken was fabulous. Everybody loved it. No complaints and it was a breeze to make. I made it exactly as described in the recipe.

This a great & forgiving recipe. The first time I made it I did not have onion powder or seasoned salt ( we had just moved) so I carmelized about 3large onions and substituted Old Bat seasoning for the seasoned salt. I made the gravy as another reviewer suggested and it was a big hit. Iâ€™ve also made it as indicated in the recipe-delicious and easier. Thank you so much for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe, but I did make a rue with the juices (broth, flour and very little butter) as others had suggested. Serving with rice pilaf and black beans. Tastes Fanta and very easy and quick to make! Exactly what this busy mama needed!

A new favorite dish. Very delicious, very easy. My halves were pretty thin so they didn't need the whole 10 minutes on each side. Will definitely make these again.

I chopped up onions to cook with the chicken instead of using onion powder as some recommended. I also added water a couple of times to help the chicken retain moisture. Simple recipe and delicious.

Great recipe for a beginner or someone with not much time on their hands. I used the advice from the comments - replaced the butter with olive oil, and added fresh onions and garlic. Removed the chicken once it was done and reduced the broth to make a pour over gravy. I can see this becoming a staple because of the speed, taste and ease you can make it with.

10 11 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/23998/a-good-easy-garlic-chicken/ ... For flavor, three stars.  It is good, but not great; a definite improvement over plain chicken.  I don't mean that to sound like an insult.  It isn't.  It's just a good start to add more.  Ease gives this one more star.  :)  I prepared the chicken & added it with this ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/231939/honey-glazed-chicken/ ... Thanks for the recipe.

Made it today for the first time and could not even believe how good it was! The only difference I made was I used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts and i added just a tiny bit of fresh garlic.  Served with asparagus and corn on the cob.  We will definitely be adding this easy recipe to the cookbook!

This has become a weekly staple in our house.  Everyone in my house loves it.  I don't even measure out the ingredients, just sprinkle on the chicken and cook in a little bit of butter.  It's really good on the grill too.  Recently, I tried it on chicken drumsticks cooked in olive oil and it was amazing.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and very good.  I followed others suggestions.  Rubbed the chicken with salt, pepper and onion powder.  Added onions and minced garlic to the pan after starting the chicken.  I used Grape seed oil along with the butter to brown the chicken.   Added chicken broth to the pan to keep the chicken moist and to make a gravy using corn starch.

As another reviewer said.. It is a great recipe for someone that doesn't know how to cook.  That would be me so it was perfect.  Nice, easy, quick, basic recipe.  The rest of the family didn't complain :)

I'm not a huge fan of chicken, and this recipe is nice because it is easy to make and is pretty good. I'm not going to rave about it, but I like eating chicken again. Also, the butter in the pan makes the smoke detector go off. But  what can you do?

This recipe is really quick and easy.  I didn't have Seasoned Salt, and some of the other ingredients, so I made a few substitutions.  First, I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of Butter, Sea Salt instead of Seasoned Salt, Minced Garlic instead of Garlic Powder, and instead of Onion Powder, I used Caramelized Onion  which I had frozen from a previous recipe.  I will definitely make this recipe again soon.

Really easy and really good. It did come out a bit too salty. Next time I'll probably go a little easier on the seasoning salt. I also served it with scallions on top (mostly cause I had some leftover scallions). It turned out great.

It was a good base recipe.  However, using fresh ingredients is a better idea.  I used one teaspoon of fresh onions along with one teaspoon of fried onions.  Then, I added two cloves of garlic, one teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of some chicken biriyani powder, a pinch of cumin, and two teaspoons of ginger paste.  I also think dicing the chicken into small pieces lets the flavor get in better.  Also, I think I will try using chicken broth, so there is more to eat with rice.  I think this recipe is a great place to start and springboard off of with adjustments based off of personal tastes.

I used boneless chicken thighs, sprinkled with garlic and onion powder. Used a little olive oil along with the butter and sautÃ©ed fresh onion before adding the chicken. Once the chicken was browned, I took the suggestion to add chicken broth, covered the pan and let the chicken finish cooking. The chicken was very moist and tastey. This is a great way to provide a quick and delicious main dish.

I'd go so far as to say that this is among the best chicken recipes I've tried! It's very easy, flavorful without being overpowering, and the ingredients are all things that you probably already have. One tip: Chunks of chicken seem to work just as well as larger pieces ( I used both). :)

I needed a quick recipe and this hit the spot,  I mixed olive oil and butter, added fresh mushrooms and onion.  We have been eating vegan and needed some protein so this hit the spot for us delightfully.  Had  sides of sweet potato and red pepper spaghetti and fresh spinach salad.

I added a few more spices and put them on before I put the chicken in the pan - husband said it was spicy the way he likes it and I will DEFINITELY make it again!  (Smoked paprika should be an ingredient in every recipe as far as I am concerned!)

This was great! I used Creole seasoning since I didn't have any seasoned salt. I also put a tsp of minced garlic in with the butter to give it extra flavor! So good!

So quick and easy. I added a little bit chicken broth and marsala wine to keep from burning. Also added Adobe, paprika and McCormick's Chicken Spices. Came out tender enough to not need a knife.

A very good easy recipe for all it's simplicity!  Personal taste issue, we found it a tad salty, so next time I make it, I will cut down on seasoned salt.  But this has very good flavor and very tender results.  Thank you!

I loved how this chicken was so easy to make. And the end result was  good! My younger sibling loved it and asked for more repeatedly! But the rest of my family said it was too salty... Good but salty. I loved it though! I guess bc I love salty things, but maybe we should tone down on the saltiness...

I am a stay-at-home mom of twin infants.  I am very new in the kitchen and this was incredibly easy and very good. I cut it up and added it to a Caesar Salad. Total time, including defrosting the frozen chicken, was 30 minutes. Time is a precious commodity in my household right now and this will definitely be made again. It would even be good as a stand-alone with sides but it was also good in the Caesar salad. My husband and I both loved it and like I said before I'm very new in the kitchen so that's pretty good.

Amazingly easy!  The whole family loved it including my toddler.  I made it with mashed potatoes and used the pan from the chicken to make some gravy as another reviewer suggested.  This will be a new staple in my house.

Will make it again. Though I actually season my chicken and put it in the fridge, just in case of a rush :-)

I really liked this! My kids ate it up but we found it a little salty so next time I think I will add salt free seasoning. But over all wonderful and my kids are picky and they loved it.

Really good, really quick. If you want a fast yummy dish (not everyone is into 3 hour gourmet meals for their 3 year old, you know) then this is perfect.  Thanks for the idea!  :-)

Omgosh! Amazing as is, Ty! Did the gravy, as one of the reviewers suggested and was the bomb. Before starting the gravy remove the cooked chicken breasts to a plate cover and gravy away!!

VERY GOOD.  Tried this again with 3/4 tsp season salt.  
Next time cut chicken in half lengthwise.  Center wasn't 
cook completely.  Also mixed all the seasoning together
and sprinkle it on the chicken.  Seasoning was enough for 
6 full breasts.  Try to make a gravy next side.

I really liked this!  Very easy, and hubby and child enjoyed it, too.  I rarely use butter, but I did for this, and it was worth it!!  The chicken breasts I had were really thick so this was not a super fast meal, but still very, very simple.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

It was much too dry and bland. Removing the skin was a bad idea! Needs more zip to it.

Great tasting for a very quick meal.  I jotted down the recipe incorrectly and used Kosher salt instead of seasoned salt.   Still loved it.   My preference is lightly salted so I'll modify that portion of it in the future.

Just like mom used to make, so good and easy as written.  For my hubby and I, he has heart and high blood pressure issues, so I used coconut oil in place of butter, used salt free seasoned salt and added black pepper.  After browning well, I put the chicken in the oven on baking rack on cookie sheet at 325 for about 15 minutes, while I finish the potatoes and gravy.

I made this yesterday!   The recipe is fantastic.   I went a little off the recipe and added much more garlic and some chicken broth.   It came out fantastic!   The meat was falling apart and the flavor was so intense!

I have made this recipe more times than I can count. The aroma is amazing and my entire family loves it. The chicken is juicy and delicious. Its my "go to" recipe when I don't have a lot of time. You will not regret making this.

This chicken was very moist, and overall good. It was a little plain for my husband and I, so I think we will double the spices next time. However, this is perfect for a family with kids that are  more sensitive to strong spices.

Excellent crowd pleaser, especially considering how easy it was. If you use thicker chicken breasts, it will take a really long time. I ended up cutting mine in thirds to speed it up as it was hitting the 30 min mark. We served with Alfredo Fettucini side from Knorr, and I added the leftover chicken to left over pasta for lunch tomorrow.

This really is very easy and quick to make. I suggest adding lemon somewhere in the mixture though - the first time I made it the garlic was a little strong, but the second time I squeezed some lemon juice into the pan on the chicken before I cooked it, and also left a slice of lemon on each chicken breast while they cooked. Also squeezed a bit more lemon on top afterward. The lemon really adds a nice flavor on top of the garlic.

Why change this easy recipe when you can have dinner on the table in less time then it takes you to pick up the ingredients at the store. This recipe is so easy. Make your own chicken sandwiches also with a toasted bun, lettuce, tomato and mayo, delish.

I did make a few changes, but nothing crazy. I browned some onion & used minced garlic (from a jar). Had it with knorr chicken rice& steamed corn. Came out pretty good& super easy.

Took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 Large yellow onion, 2 tsps. Minced garlic, 1 tspn lawry's seasoning salt.  Also made gravy as suggested by reviewers using 2/3 cups all purpose flower, 2 cups chicken broth.  Family really enjoyed results. Will definitely make again.

This is a basic recipe that can be really good with the tweaks suggested by many other posters here.  I brined the chicken before sauteeing, used fresh onion and garlic instead of the powders, and made gravy after the chicken was browned with chicken broth and flour.  Without these tweaks, I don't think this recipe would have been worth it.   I am a beginner cook so I do appreciate non-recipe "recipes", if that makes sense.

A bit salty for my taste but still very good.
I added about a teaspoon of basil for extra flavor.

Loved it even though I did not think I would - I have tried cooking chicken in the skillet before and didn't like it.  I followed the recipe but added olive oil to the butter and fresh onion and garlic.  I'll definitely be making again!

Not bad, but not stellar. We ended up putting barbecue sauce on it at the table because it wasn't particularly flavorful otherwise.

Truthfully, the lack of fresh ingredients is what makes this dish controversial. Just use fresh garlic and fresh onion instead, and use a bit of olive oil to keep from the butter browning to quickly and burning... with a bit of chicken broth (cause flavor and the cursed black burnt of bad food). I would also add a tidbit of fresh basil. And cayenne pepper for a kick.

The flavor of the chicken was good as the recipe was written, but I'm glad I followed the advice of others to make a gravy with chicken broth and cornstarch. It made it that much better.  This recipe came together easily and was quick enough for a busy week-night meal.

Super easy. I love cooking but sometimes when I get back home I am just dead tired. This is nothing fancy (like another reviewer said it is barely a recipe, haha) but it does the trick on those nights and doesn't taste half bad.

When it was cooking it smelled so good, but when i actually ate it, it was soo salty. Otherwise it would probably have been fine, but that saltiness was overwhelming. I couldn't even eat it.

Seemed over-spiced but, amazingly, didn't have a lot of flavor.  I followed the recipe as written and wish I had made some changes that some of the reviewers made. It was edible, but I won't be making it again.

Just made and ate this and it was edible but will be deleted from recipe file - i followed recommendations of others used fresh garlic and onion added chicken broth and made a gravy. There are leftovers i am not sure what i will do with maybe toss the chicken in salad, which would be fine and a good use for chicken made this way but not as the main dish.

I recommend making a gravy to go with this and some mashed potatoes and green beans. It's much better with fresh onion and garlic and recommend fresh produce (if time can be afforded) over the powders.

Definitely too salty if you follow the recipe the way it is. Husband said he only liked it because I followed other viewers suggestions about making gravy with it. I followed the recipe the way it was but half way through cooking I added 1 1/2 cup chicken broth and finished it that way. Took the chicken out, added another cup of water to help reduce the saltiness, and then added 2-3 TB cornstarch mixed with 2 TB cold water to the sauce to thicken it. Served gravy over unseasoned mashed potatoes, as the gravy was plenty seasoned to make up for the potatoes. Will definitely try again only next time using fresh garlic and onions to see if it's better.

Incredibly easy and extremely delicious, I made it with the gravy that Mamajudd suggested (pan drippings, 3T butter, 1.5T cornstrach [her recipe calls for 3T flour], and about a cup of chicken stock). It was a little on the salty side, next time I'll probably just omit salt altogether, otherwise it was perfect. Great for a quick dinner!

This was very good but I completely modified this recipe based on others reviews. I used a chicken rub and black pepper all over the chicken breast and rubbed it in. I then sauteed onion and garlic in evoo then added the chicken (cubed) and browned. I then added chicken broth, covered, and simmered until the chicken was cooked. Once cooked, I removed the chicken and added flour to the broth to create a gravy which was so flavorful!!

This chicken was very good and so easy to make. After the chicken was defrosted it took no time at all to cook so it would be great for a quick weeknight meal. Thank you for sharing, Julia!

This chicken is DELICIOUS. I served it with a side of broccoli and linguine with alfredo sauce. Needless to say, I found myself picking out the chicken to eat first. I've added this to my book of quick staple meals!

I chose to bake my chicken versus pan frying. I baked at 350 for 30 minutes. Next time I will cut back a bit on the Seasoned Salt but overall a nice dish. The kids really liked it as well.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe.  It was easy & quick to make.  I added a little parsley and used onion salt instead of onion powder & salt (because there wasn't any in the pantry).  We're making it again tonight and trying it out in a pita!

I'm giving this 5 stars for simplicity!  It tastes great, and is so easy to prepare.  I made it tonight for a chicken caesar salad and it was delicious!  The only thing I did differently was add a little bit of parsley with the garlic and onion powder.  I'll be making this again, for sure.

The texture of this chicken was great!  I thought the seasoning salt was too overpowering though. Next time I'll probably scale back on it.  Overall, very good and I will make again!

This is a very good, easy basic chicken recipe. I didn't have garlic powder, so I used garlic salt and backed off a little on the seasoning salt.

yummy and so easy!! alittle on the salty side though. Next time i'll add less garlic powder. Butter gave chicken a rich taste. And instead of adding the spices while the chicken was cooking, i mixed them together on a plate, and laid the chicken on the plate, and flippes over to season both sides, but nonetheless this recipe will be getting made again!

I thought this was pretty uninteresting.  It needs a little punch.  Making the gravy as some suggested helped, but it was still a boring dish.  :(

Quick and easy. I had chicken thighs and they came out great. I didn't have onion powder, so I added very little curry and garlic powder to the butter. Later as someone suggested I added some flour to the butter. I also included some Italian seasoning breadcumbs to the butter and flour since I didn't have seasoning salt. Then added about a cup of the chicken broth, I l put the chicken back in a cooked covered for a few minutes so it cooked in the juices.   Thanks. I hope I can find some quick, flavorful recipes again to make after work:) The fiance loves the chicken too.

I made this recipe just now and it was awesome. I used fresh garlic cause I didnt have any garlic powder. I browned the chicken with the garlic but forgot to lower the heat so I burnded the garlic. No biggie, I scraped it out and added 3T of butter/flour and poured in 1c of chicken broth. Served chicken with rice and gravy. Very good. I added salt and pepper to taste as always.

I used fresh ingrediants instead and made my own seasoning. I pored boiled hot water over the chicken before putting it in the skillet so that its already halfway cooked.

I have made this at least 20 times and it always turns out super yummy. However, it's only 5 stars because of the gravy I make with it. I double the spices and heavily coat the chicken. I also use a smoky seasoned salt which adds another level of flavor not in the base recipe. Make sure that you are allowing the chicken to totally brown...a nice deep dark brown. After it has browned I add 3 cups of chicken broth and allow the chicken to cook until it's 180. (About 20-30mins) I then remove the chicken and add my thickener (flour and water paste).....the gravy is always so rich and thick.....super with mashed potatoes but probably good with noodles too. We can't get past mashed potatoes though! It's a great meal that is very fast especially for on the weeknights!

The gravy turned out wonderful, which is the only reason it is getting this many stars. Was not impressed at all by the chicken - thank goodness the rest of the meal made up for it.

Very easy to make, used un-thawed chikn breasts cuz I was in a rush and though I couldnt get it cooked all the way through in the saucepan, I was able to get it done in the oven just as fast after practically caramelizing the surface of the chikn. Tasted amazing. Substituted garlic and onion powder with lemon pepper :)

This one is super easy and fast. I also use fresh onion and garlic. I make the gravy like some others have said as well. My pickiest child goes crazy over this one. I usually go for harder recipes because cooking is my passion but this one is perfect for those nights when everything is busy!

My mom and I made this chicken about a month ago, and we found that although fast and easy, this chicken was way to garlicky. I would add less garlic next time.

Pretty solid recipe. I didn't measure anything; just sprinkled with all the seasonings according to our tastes. Definitely nothing to jump for joy about but it is a quick and easy recipe that is good.

Wow! This was great! Usually when I saute chicken I get dry and rubbery, but this really DID come out very moist and tender (and quickly)! For the reviewer who said to use fresh onion and garlic to make the seasoned salt the only salt in the recipe, it IS! Garlic powder and onion powder don't have salt in them. I might cut down a little on the seasoned salt next time, especially if I use prepared chicken broth after I saute it. Homemade (non-salted) broth would be great, and then I added cornstarch and mushrooms and made a sauce. GREAT!

Should be called "A Great Easy Garlic Chicken"! Ingredients are inexpensive and some of what I keep in the pantry at all times. Even my impossibly-picky-eater 8-yr-old went back for 2nds! I added some chopped onion and some minced fresh garlic to the butter in the pan as some others suggested, and rubbed the powdered ingredients onto both sides of the chicken Delish! Just be sure to use garlic and onion *powders* and not *salts*. This will be in the regular rotation at our house!

It was good but probably would have been better with the gravy.  I give the chicken 3 stars but my picky 5 year old gives it 5 stars.

Very simple and quick. I make this all the time to add to different pastas, rice or sides. I rub the spices in, sometimes make a gravy out of the chicken bits like others said, and sometimes I cut the chicken up into small pieces before cooking in the skillet, make the gravy, and serve over rice. Yum.

I have cooked my chicken very simelar to this for years. Except I always cut chicken into chunks (Size depending on the recipe i put chicken into). I have never had to add anying liquids. My family's favorite way is to after chicken is cooked through, add 1 can of Cream of Mushroom and 1 can of Cream of Chicken, simmer, serve with mashed potatoes, pasta or rice.

I give this a 4.5!  It's very good, fast, and easy.  The only thing I will change next time is to reduce the seasoning salt (by at least 1/2).  I served this with the "Balsamic Cream Sauce" over fettucine.  A definite keeper!

As a relative novice on a college student budget, this is a wonderful start recipe. It's cheap, easy, and I actually had the ingredients on hand. Next time, I'm totally making that gravy.

I made this tonight exactly by the recipe and everyone loved it.  I had to cook the chicken much longer than 15 minutes though (I had thick chicken breasts) and it still was tender and juicy.  It didn't dry out at all like some other reviewers were saying, had plenty of the butter left and the chickens own juices were enough.  Will definitely make again when I want to make something fast, affordable and yummy!!

If you like salt, and we do, this was easy and very tasty!  Instead of butter, I used canola oil and covered while frying.  Tender and juicy!!

Very simple and tasty. But, just like others have said, the chicken will burn if you don't add some water or chicken stock to it after browning. After putting in some chicken stock, I added mixed veggies and cooked them alongside the chicken - FAB!

Yummy! I went ahead and took some user suggestions and added fresh garlic in addition to the seasonings. After dousing the chicken breasts in the melted butter I coated them in the seasonings and minced garlic, and then put them back in the pan to saute. I also took the advice from previous reviews and used chicken broth and flour to make gravy. It was great! Served it with sauteed mushrooms, spinach and broccoli. I'll make this again.

Very fast dinner.  I used garlic salt and it worked out just fine.  The key is to go slowly with the gravy, mixing in the liquids a little at a time.

I make this all the time....but we are trying to eliminate salt in our diet so for seasoning I use a little red pepper and I use an olive oil spray in the pan.....The pepper spices it up bit too

This was great!!! I have two picky eaters in the house and they just gobbled it up. I only made two changes, I used chicken tenderloins because that is what I had on hand. the second change I made was I added just a small amount of vegetable oil to the butter so it wouldn't burn quickly. Even my husband who usually only likes his chicken breaded and fried liked it and believe me he can be hard to please. This one is a keeper so quick and so good.

This chicken was amazing!  My hubby who usually bickers about eating chicken even liked it.  I made the gravy as one review suggested, in the same pan and it was the best gravy I've ever made. (I'm not very good at gravy, but this was easy and delicious!)

This is great and so easy and fast. I did use an entire stick of butter though, and I liked it better because soaking in the butter made it so juicy! Good for when you need to throw something together for the family quickly!

I took suggestions from other reviewers and used 1/4 onion and 2 teaspoons minced garlic, sauteed them for a little before setting the chicken in, and it came out great!  We loved this recipe and will be making it again and again!

This recipe is simple and excellent.  The butter and garlic powder blend very nicely and your chicken comes out looking tastey slightly golden.  Super simple and effective.  I make this very often now.

Very good flavor but a bit too salty. I used real onions but stuck with the garlic powder.  Next time I will use less salt seasoning.

My husband and sons loved it! I followed the advice simmer it. I simmered it in white wine and chicken broth for 30 min. I made a  gravy to go with it. I added minced onion and garlic to the gravy and everyone asked for seconds. Too easy

I decided to try this out and found that the seasonings were ok, but just using salt and pepper ONLY on a boneless skinless chicken thigh (taking out the excess fat w/ knife) and using butter on the pan makes the skin nice and crisp,JUICY inside, and the BEST CHICKEN EVER.  No need for other seasonings...but to make gravy, scraped bits w/ flour, butter and REAL garlic, now THAT's what makes a good seasoning!  Never tried butter to fry the chicken before, thanx for the idea!

Only modification I did to this recipe was using 1 Tblsp of minced garlic with 1 tsp of garlic powder.

It tasted great.

delicious!
I put the seasoning with a touch of flour in a plastic bag (as recommended by another reviewer) & shook.  First I cooked some chopped onion in the butter.  After browning the chicken I added a cup of chicken broth and let it simmer.  When done, I removed the chicken, added another cup of chicken broth, cornstarch & water to make a gravy.  Came out great!  Thanks!

Chicken came out good. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the gravy though. You MUST follow MAMAJUDD's directions for making the gravy after pulling the chicken out. It totally made this meal. So easy it was ridiculous. Made mashed potatoes on the side and covered them and the chicken in the gravy and it was just awesome. Thx for the great recipe.

This was edible, at best.  The seasonings were a little strong on some parts of the chicken, but the center of the chicken was exceptionally bland.  My husband tried dipping his in BBQ, which was a HORRIBLE combination.  We probably won't make this again.

I'll admit this recipe is very basic but its easy and tastes great.  A recipe doesn't need to be all fancy to be good and this one is perfect.  My kids only like meat grilled (no sauce or anything) and in winter its not always possible, this recipe is a way to cook on the stove without a lot of goop and still have it taste good.  I usuallyl serve over pasta and its really yummy.

Sprayed pan and added a small amount of butter.  Simply sprinkled with spices and cooked chicken tenders.  Amazing!

I was amazed at how well this turned out considering it was so easy!  My son wanted something that wasn't fried and everyone in my house loves garlic.  I too used fresh garlic & onions.  Next time I make this I'm going to add even more to give it more of a kick.  Great recipe!

Easy, fast, delicious. I followed other reviewers suggestions of making a gravy by adding broth and flour/water thickener after cooking the chicken. I also pounded my chicken to make it cook more evenly in the skillet. Great for weeknight.

This was FANTASTIC.  My husband is the pickiest eater alive and he loves this recipe.  It is so easy but can be presented to look so fancy.  I followed the advice of other members and cooked it in chicken broth and it made it so much easier.  I find myself having company over just so I can make this because I can't get enough of the rave reviews!

I am not a great cook so the brown crust that I got around the chicken surprised me-I thought I burned it. But when me and my roomate tasted it we were extremely impressed! So juicey! Even my 6 year old son loved it and usually dinner time is a battle, this time he ate it all up, no complaining!!

I chose to make this recipe in my cooking lab at school.  We didn't have the seasoning salt so we just used regular salt.  The chicken turned out moist and yummy.  I made it at home also, but I used a couple of fresh garlic cloves which made it even better.

Oh my goodness, this was good!  This is definitely going to be a staple in our home.  Also, I used the recipe for D's Skillet Gravy (I didn't have any chicken stock and wanted a recipe calling for water).  Yummy!

This is a very good and easy chicken recipe.  It's perfect for those evenings when i need something easy for dinner.  I took the advice of other reviews and made a gravy from what's left in the pan and served it over noodles! YUM!

This is a good, safe recipe.  The chicken stayed pretty moist.  The only thing I did different was I added a bit of garlic salt to the mix.  I added all the ingredients together and then sprinkled on the chicken each time I turned it.  This is delicious and quick.

Made it at my moms house last night for the 1st time- very tasty. A little too pale for the family, but it was gone in a heartbeat! Would definetely make it again. Paired it w/some yellow rice & sausage and green salad. Suggest seasoning the chicken prior to cooking it & slicing the chicken to make it thinner, but cooked in a flash- no burned meat here LOL!

Talk about a lot of butter! This was a good recipe but the two problems were way to much butter and it burned. Next time I will try non fat italian dressing instead of butter and simmering in chicken broth after browning. This was extremely greasy.

I made this tonight for my family. I didn't have any onion powder on hand so I used onion salt. It turned out really good and my 2.5 year old and 5 year old ate it up. My only suggestion is to cook it longer on lower heat. I cooked it on #4 on the stove and it still burned a bit. I cooked the breasts for 10 mins on each side.

This is quite good, especially considering how easy it is.  I kept the lid on the pan, so the juices didn't boil off, and I think this helped keep it tender.

Very good! Reminds me a lot of "Chicken on the Barbie" from Outback Steakhouse. I didn't have garlic powder so I just smashed a clove of garlic with the back of my knife and let it warm up along with a butter/olive oil combination in the pan. Then when they got kinda soft and oil was hot I took them out so they wouldn't burn and ruin the flavor. 

I did make a pan gravy from flour, milk, and added pepper. Wasn't entirely necessary though, the chicken was so flavorful. 

Next time I will probably serve with BBQ sauce on the side and probably won't do a pan sauce. I'll probably add some cayenne to the salt/powder mix to spice it up a bit.

My husband and I are trying to reduce are carbs and he is a very picky eater.  I made this for him with the gravy of chicken broth and cream cheese and he loved it.  Will definitely make again.

Easy, quick and with so few ingredients I am sure to have everything to make this dish.  My kids and husband thought it was good but none of us were wowed by it.  I think I will try it again and make the sauce that so many other people have tried.

The best recipe ever!  The family sucked down and asked for more.  So much for leftovers for lunch.  I added chicken broth and flour to make a sauce to pour over the chicken and our mashed potatoes.
This tasted like it came from an upscale restaurant.

This was excellent!!!!!!!  I did not have onion powder so I diced an onion and added it to the butter.  When the chicken was done I turned the burner on high and browned each side.  Wonderful!!!

Very good, very simple, very easy - and I didn't have to run out to the store to buy anything special. I followed the directions but added a bit as I used 6 breasts instead. Couldn't ask for a more simpler recipe! Thanks!

What a simple but GREAT idea!  I did however alter this recipe a bit.  I left the seasoning salt out and used sea salt and cayenne pepper instead. Also in a separate bowl I added chopped bacon, shredded colby jack cheese and diced vidalia onion. While the chicken was still in the pan I put my cheese mixture atop. It was wonderful!!

Kids & Hubby loved this recipe.  Will be making it again.  Next time I will slice the breast in half to spead up the cooking time.  I did as others had  suggested and used fresh garlic & onion.  I also made sauce afterwards with water and cornstarch and served over noodles.  The sauce was runny.  I will work on that.  Definitly resteraunt worthy.

Man!  This was great.  I pounded out the breast first.  Did evoo instead of butter, added a splash of lemon juice and fresh parsley at the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Sometimes the best things are the simplest!

Good flavor - problem was, I may have overcooked it. The breasts were quite thick yet the cook time seemed to be too much. Definitely cooked, and the breast surface was quite hard. Next time, less time per side.

My family really enjoyed this. I followed other reviewers' advice and sauteed onions and garlic in olive oil and butter. Then I pounded the chicken a little flatter, rubbed in the seasonings, and browned it in the olive oil mixture. After browning I simmered it in chicken broth until done, then made gravy. The gravy really does make this dish. It's not one of my personal favorites, but I'd definitely consider making it again.

It was good but not great.  I did as other reviewers did and added fresh garlic and chicken broth and thickened it with flour before serving.  I liked that the recipe was easy and made with things that I had around the house and had good flavor but it wasn't anything exceptional.  This will not be on our regular rotation but when looking for something quick and easy that my kids will eat I will make it again.

Just an additional note:  This recipe works really well with boneless pork chops.  If I have time to marinate I use the Garlic Lemon Herb Pork Chop recipe from this site.  If I have no time this recipe works well for the chops.  I add a splash of lemon juice along with the butter-just personal preference.

This was delicious.  I followed the recipe and did as other reviewers did by rubbing salt/powder mixture into chicken breasts and browning each side a couple min. in butter.  Then added can chicken broth and cooked the chicken the rest of the way in the broth.  Removed chicken when done and whisked in 1/4 c. flour and cooked until thickened, which only took a few min.  Added cooked egg noodles to sauce and served with chicken.  So easy and good.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very yummy.. both me and my husband had seconds, it wasnt divine, but a Great comfort food. I used fresh onions and garlic and cooked the chicken in 1/2 cup of chicken broth, then added the rest of the can at the end and made a sauce adding 1 1/2 tbsp of cornstach. I served in over mashed potatoes.. will make again!

Quick and easy, just be sure to pound out the chicken before it goes in the skillet and after you've given it a good rinse. This helps it to cook more evenly. We make this just as written.

I followed the recomondations for the gravy, but I added the 1/2 can chicken broth, cummin, and some cinnamon. I diced the chicken up and added it back to the broth and let it cook another 15 min. I served mine onver wiled rice. Delicious!

I cooked this, as suggested, by frying first, then adding broth.  I thought it was very moist, but definitely lacking flavor.

This was a good recipe. I added about two tablespoons of olive oil to the pan and melted the butter in the olive oil. I also added fresh garlic and onion. I took chicken out and set aside, and then took one other reviewr's suggestion and added 1/4 cup of flour and browned the flour and then added two small cans of chicken broth and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Mixed well, then added the chicken back to the pan, until the gravy mixture was thickened. My family liked it and so did picky 6 year old daughter. Will definately make this again.

Nice and easy something you can make really quick. i really like onions and garlic so i add extra and use a chicken broth so as not to add any kind of fat into it.

The chicken turned out pretty good.  It was moist.   used 2 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp EVOO  because I knew my pan was already pretty hot.  I made it with brown 'boil-in-bag' rice which I cooked in chicken stock.  So I made a pan gravy with about 3 Tbsp flour, cook for a couple minutes, then added a few ladels full of chicken stock from the rice pot, salt & pepper to taste, and served that over the chicken and rice.  My kids loved dipping the chicken in the gravy, and it just added a little extra to the meal.

I thought this chicken had incredible flavor! I did as others suggested & made a gravy & it was really nice on the mashed potatoes I also made. I also put the seasoning on my chicken & let sit a bit before putting in the pan, used more butter than it called for, melted small amount of minced garlic in that butter & sprinkled some seasoning salt on my chicken as it cookeed b/c I did cut the amount that I put on the chicken in the bowl.  I cut up my chicken so it would cook faster & I think next time I will leave as full breasts as I think it makes the meat more moist.  I find that when I cut up my chicken I tend to overcook a bit.  This was so good though & I will be making again FOR SURE!

GREAT MEAL! It was so quick to cook! I had to shorten the cooking time from the original recipe. My husband said it was the best chicken we've ever made at home and it was better than any he's ever had before (and his mom is a great cook). We're young college students, so we will definitely be making this recipe again.

I love how quick this recipe was to put together. I followed the recipe exactly, but if I were to make this again I would follow other reviewers' advice and add chicken broth and a few other variations. The recipe by itself allowed for a quick meal, but satisfaction was not at its utmost.

I grew up w/ a variation of the recipe that calls for soaking the chicken in lite soy sauce (regular tends to be a little too salty) for only a little longer than it takes to heat up the pan. Just adding soy sauce as you cook it works as well. Turns out like a very light, but tasty, glaze.

Following the suggestion of others, I made a gravy in the saucepan after the chicken was done, and put the gravy over the chicken and some steamed vegetables. Really tasty!

This is so good and easy!  I've used this spice combination many times before on chicken, but I made a sauce with flour and broth for the first time, and it is so good!  I've also had this before with broth added to the pan along with a broccoli, cauliflower, and carrot mixture.  It's very good like that too.

I was looking for something that would take me no more than 40 min. or so to make.  This was both very good and very easy.  I also made a gravy out of the butter and drippings, adding a can of chicken broth and flour to thicken and it was great over homemade mashed potatoes with a side of corn.  Will make again!

I was skeptical when I read this recipe was great "even the pickiest eater."  My picky 6 year old gobbled it up and declared it delicious!  I also took others' idea to use fresh garlic, then made a gravy with Marsala and flour.  Wonderful!

We liked this recipe but we'll tweak it when I make it again.  I used the gravy recipe per GIAMOM's review and that helped.  I'll probably do 1.5 or maybe 2x the amt. of spices next time.  And/or rub the spices on the chicken earlier in the day so it can season up.

The chicken in this recipe is just OK. The spices make it good, but nothing special. I followed other reviewers' advice and made gravy with the drippings, which was fantastic!  I served it with mashed potatoes and peas, and the hubby gave it two thumbs up. I think that without the gravy, the chicken would  have been kind of blah... so do make the gravy!

A good, easy to make chicken for pasta or sandwiches.  I use fresh garlic instead of the salt.

GOOD and EASY is just like the title reads! I followed recipe exactly and chicken well received at our family table.  I'll probably saute garlic and onion next time, but was pleased with the results of short cut version.  Thank you for sharing!

This was a very good recipe, but a little salty. I followed it exactly. I think it might have been just a little better if I had used some fresh garlic and onions. But my family really liked it. It was very easy.

This was good.  What I really liked about it was that it was inexpensive to make.  I also enjoyed the flavor of the fresh onion and garlic I used as opposed to the salts.  And instead of the butter the recipe called for I made it with olive oil.  I did make the gravy that several other users commented on, but did not care for it.

I picked this meal as the first thing to cook for my boyfriend.  I was very surprised at how great it tasted and how simple it was to cook.  I've cooked it a few more times since and I love it! I'm picky with chicken because sometimes when I cook it, I feel like it has no flavor but this is one I could eat all by itself and be happy.

I am only giving this 2 stars because it was too salty. It was easy to make and it did smell very good while cooking, but all it tasted like was salt-coated chicken. Thank you anyway.

I am my own worst critic, and VERY picky about food, but when I made this recipe, I actually said, " Oh my God, this is delicious!"  And so easy!!!  We are making it again this week, with extra so we can use the leftovers in our salad for lunch the next day!

The seasoning "crust" on mine ended up scorching.  It was still edible, but it was hard for me to tell how "good" the seasonings were because of it.  Seemed to me there was way more than necessary, though.  I think I'll probably bake in the oven next time.  Was certainly quick and easy, and I think it will probably be pretty good if not burnt.

This was a very nice, simple recipe. Like other reviewers suggested this would probably be best as an add in to another dish but I had no problem with it on it's own either. I may try to make this in the crockpot with a little chicken broth next time.

I have used this seasoning combination for many years. I love it on other chicken parts (legs, etc) baked in the oven. Soo simple, and so yummy!

This recipe is great! I made extra so I could use the leftovers for sandwiches and salads over the next few days. I used about a 1/4 teaspoon extra light virgin olive oil instead of butter and didn't use any seasoning salt (it really doesn't need the extra salt). I will take some of the other reviwers' recommendations and try real onion and garlic next time I make this.

Very good.  I cut the chicken into cubes, used actual onion and garlic.  I added cheese and veggies and put it in a pita.  This chicken would taste great in a variety of dishes.

This was such an easy recipe.  I didn't have any onion powder so I used chopped onions.  I sauteed the onions first then added the seasoned chicken.  It is very versatile and can be changed easily by using different spices.  My picky husband and 4 yr old loved it.  No leftovers!!  Always nice to find a recipe that's easy to fix after you've worked all day.

This was such an easy quick meal to make. My boyfriend loved it, and so did I. We both love garlic, so I knew it would be a big hit. I do like to use olive oil instead of butter. And sometimes I'll use the garlic and herb or onion and herb seasonings from Mrs. Dash. They work great!

This chicken is amazing!! It's so different and has such a great flavor. My family ate the whole thing in one night. I will definitely be fixing this again. PS I added it to a recipe in here called Easy Breezy Casserole that calls for chicken breast. Wow, what a great dish.

I love it and get several requests for it.  I passed the recipe on to a friend of mine, and she said that she has to make it for her husband at least once a week (and she doesn't mind, because it's so easy).  I even used it once with some stir fry chicken, added a little teriyaki sauce and stir fry vegetables, and served it with rice.  WONDERFUL!!!!!!

This recipe was easy. I did'nt have onion powder on hand so I used some dried parsley. It came out great. I also subsituted the butter for Olive oil. It came out great. Yum

very easy basic recipe just like the title suggests.  I decided to use a splatter screen over the pan after reading the reviews....thanks for that tip!  I prepared just as the recipe stated cooking about 10 minutes per side. The chicken was moist and delicious.  Definitely a keeper for those nights were easy is key.

This had a great flavor and everyone loved it, from grandma to my 2 year old.  I cut the breasts in halves and made "strips" for quicker cooking.

Good chicken...had to use onion salt instead of onion powder. Still good but a bit too salty. I would recommend this recipe to anyone. So fast and easy!

Fast and super easy.  I used the chicken strips I cooked in an Alfredo sauce.  The chicken was juicy and tasty.  Great way to quickly cook up chicken to serve on it's own, or in other dishes.  Thank you!!

Tasted great, even though I burned it a little.  Chalk that one up to my not paying attention though!  A nice, simple recipe that tasted ...well, great!  Thanks!
