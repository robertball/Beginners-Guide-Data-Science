There is a lot of prep work involved in this and it is rather pricey to make however the end result is great and worth it. I chose to leave my mushrooms and radishes whole. Partly for presentation but mostly because I was tired of chopping for so long. The oil needs doubled if you want the mixture to coat all of the veggies but other than this is perfect as written.
