Hey ya'll! Thanks for all the great reviews--I am so flattered! Thanks, also, for not making the recipe completely different than written and then stating how you don't like it. I don't understand that. Thanks again. Don't forget to use EXTRA-SHARP cheddar cheese! **UPDATE 6/24/2011** Thanks to Yakaty for suggesting the addition of worchestershire and mustard. It makes this even better IMO! Thanks again to all for the reviews! PS If it ain't Duke's, it ain't mayo! ;)

This was without a doubt the best pimento cheese I've ever had!  I omitted the jalapenos, and bumped up the cayenne a bit since I like my pimento cheese with a bit of a bite to it.  Other than that, this recipe is flawless.  Thank you so much for sharing!

This is exactly the way I've always made Pimento Cheese (minus the jalepeno).  I took some to work once and 4 people told me it was the best they've ever had.  Yum!

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. This is phenomenal! After eating the store bought all my life, I knew there had to be something better than that . I found a guy at a farmer's market who sells it homemade but he was charging $8 for a tiny container. After much griping from the hubby about spending that much on pimento cheese every week, I finally decided to try it myself & I am so glad I did. This blows farmer's market guy out of the water. The 1 tiny change I made was that I just used a hand mixer to mix the cream cheese, Mayo & spices. I folded in the grated cheese, jalapeno, & pimentos so it would maintain a chunky texture.

First time trying this and I liked the concept.  True to form, I increased the cayenne just a little for a longer finish, added a tad of dry mustard, and some worcestershire sauce in the spirit of Beer Cheese soup.  This recipe didn't need it from my tasting but it fit my taste.  Time to give it to the troops to try.

This is a favorite at our house. I always make my own pimento as well, since the jarred stuff is so expensive. Just broil or roast a red pepper until the skin is black, stick in a plastic bag to cool, then peel off the skin and clean out the seeds. Fresh pimento!

All pimento cheese recipes apparently aren't equal.  I definitely didn't like the cream cheese in it at all.  The garlic was out of place as well.  I'll keep trying other recipes, this is not what I was hoping for.

This is really good. A gourmet grocery store by my house used to sell pimento cheese in a jar that was expensive. They used to sample it and it was so good. I had been looking for a recipe to duplicate it and this is very close. I left out the optional ingredients and I didn't have pimentos but I had some small diced red peppers and used that. I made 1/2 recipe and it made about a cup and a half. The only thing that seemed to be missing was the sharper taste of the spread the store sampled and then I realized that the recipe suggested "extra-sharp cheddar" so I would use that specifically. The cheese should also not be pre-shredded, both are important for the flavor and texture. This will be great with crackers or to make grilled cheese out of this week. Thank you!

Jalapeno is optional although it is good to make a double batch of this and add Jalapeno to the second batch. Make a grilled cheese from the Jalapeno batch using raisin bread, top burgers with it or add it to grits! There are countless ways to use Pimento cheese. And for heavens sake don't use Miracle Whip! The BEST mayo for pimento cheese is Duke's!! Hope you enjoy is as much as we do.

When I was a boy, my mother was the only person in our area code that made Pimento Cheese.  All of the other kids would laugh because I ate such strange cheese sandwiches.  This truly takes me back more than 50 years.  I don't think Mom every thought to include "hollerpenoes," but I might try it next time.  Everyone in the house turned up their noses when I mentioned this Southern Delicacy, but loved it when I made it.  The Best Sandwich in the Universe is a Grilled Pimento Cheese or two...

I was raised in the south and just moved to Vegas four years ago. I had no idea that pimento cheese was unheard of out here, so I had to make my own! As is, the recipe is pretty good. I'm gonna' mess with it later to try and get a bigger kick into it. I put it in the fridge over night, dumped it on a cheese platter, and served with Triscuits. Was great!

Started making this POSITIVE I had a jar of pimentos in the pantry...sadly, no.  This was fabulous w/out them...family gobbled it up...so can only imagine how great it will be when made w/pimentos!  Great recipe.

UPDATE:  Made this for friends visiting from Georgia...they said it was better than anything their moms ever made!

My husband was raised in the south but never liked his mothers Pimento Cheese. My sons however asked for it every time we visited. I saw this recipe with the extra added kick and thought I might get my husbands approval for an easy appetizer. He loved it. It is just an easy dish to go along with the southern flair. We stuffed celery and had it with wheat thin wafers. Thanks for the recipe.

This stuff is fabulous! I have had people at work bring the ingredients to me and ask me to make it for them. No fewer than half a dozen have asked for the recipe. Once I took some in (had about half of it left from making it at home) and one of the other ladies ate the rest of the bowl by herself before the shift was over! It goes fast because it's delicious!  Thanks for sharing with us!

Delicious!  Made exactly according to the recipe, including the addition of worcestershire and dry mustard that the OP added to the recipe. Next time I will beat it a little less because it was a little too smooth...I like my pimento cheese slightly chunky.

Well, I tried to go back and edit my review AGAIN, but couldn't so I will rewrite here.  Followed the recipe except for jalapeno peppers AND included the cook's later recommended worcestershire sauce.  Loved the recipe the first time.  SEcond time I used SOUR CREAM instead of mayo, and liked it even better.  THIRD TIME, I increased the pimento to a 7 oz jar but did not add mayo or sour cream, and this has turned out to be our favorite version--and lower in fat!  I was afraid that once it rechilled that it would be hard and unspreadable, but it wasn't.  AND, warmed and melted makes a WONDERFUL dip.  This is the only way I will make pimento cheese in the future.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.

I always hate reviews where the food cooked had nothing to do with the recipe. Here, I followed the recipe exactly, and all I can say is sweet Southern perfection! It is better the second day - if you can make it last that long - and it makes delicious grilled cheese sandwiches. The cheese-to-mayo ratio is spot on, and the slight bite from the cayenne makes the flavor wonderful as a dip, a sandwich spread, or just by the spoonful! Using the stand mixer to make it makes it so so so easy. Try this version of the snack food to the Gods next time you have company, or just to enchant the family!

Want to change it up some? I think using Miracle Whip instead of Hellmans Mayo (or even Dukes, if you can find it) might make this even better. Also, consider a sprinkle more cayenne to brighten the flavors. Otherwise - why mess with perfect?

Fantastic! I've never been a fan of PC, since all we had when I grew up was the premade stuff from the grocery store. As a result, I never bothered to make it from scratch, and my husband always doctored up the store-bought stuff with jalapenos & green olives, they way his Mama always made it from scratch.  So after 20 years of marriage, I decided to give it a shot! This recipe is wonderful! So easy--I didn't bother using the mixer, it was just as easy to mix it up with a spoon and a bowl.  I try to avoid pre-shredded cheese as much as possible, so made this with a combo of Black Diamond Aged Cheddar and Cabot Classic Vermont White Cheddar, shredded on the smallish holes of a box grater, as well as the cream cheese. I always keep pickled jalapenos on hand, and usually have sliced and minced versions. So I added about a couple teaspoons of the minced to the cheese, along with about 5 finely minced green olives.  Definitely a keeper. I will be making this on a regular basis. No more of that fakey orange stuff in this house! Thanks!

FANTASTIC recipe!!! I followed most of the directions, leaving out the optional jalapeno and black pepper and using garlic salt instead of powder since I was out. It turned out wonderfully. Great as a grilled cheese sandwich! I reduced the calorie count by using mayo made with olive oil.

Oh this was fabulous!  Did put the cayanne in but left the jalopenio pepper and it did give it quite a kick!  Might leave out next time as i can't eat and drink at the same time ;)  It made quite a bit too!  I subbed with greek yogurt cream cheese for some added protein and it tasted just like regular cream cheese :)  After doubling this recipe and making wraps with most of it, i had some left over so stuffed some chicken breasts with it, coated the breasts with honey mustard and then "shake and bake" prezel topping and baked chicken for 60min on 400 and it was SOOOOO good!!  Will deffinatly make again!!

Hands down, the best pimento cheese recipe this Southern girl has ever eaten (much less made!).  Made it exactly according to directions, and I'm eating a sandwich made from the mixing bowl!  I can't wait to see how good it is after it is in the fridge for a couple of hours.  Thanks!

Now why do you put this heavenly recipe here when I am supposed to be on a diet? I stuffed hamburgers with this (kinda like a juicy lucy) ...probably the best "cheeseburger" we have ever had...whatever was left over the kids fought over with spoons and crackers....I will make again and again! Made no changes at all except doubled it since i feed so many teenagers!

After 10 years of requesting pimento cheese from my mom and mother-in-law, I finally broke down and looked for a recipe to make on my own.  I never thought I'd say it, but this recipe puts their old Southern recipe to shame!  It was absolutely delicious with just the right amount of kick.  I followed the recipe exactly but with half the ingredients since my husband claims he doesn't like pimento cheese.  Well, I got 3 crackers full of this and he ate the rest and asked for more.
I served with Ritz crackers for a Saturday afternoon snack and I will be making this again - soon!   Thanks for sharing.

Okay, only gonna say this once. "I HATE YOU" There I said it, I admit defeat. I thought MY homemade pimento cheese was the best BUT I made this tonight and you win hands down. The ONLY thing I did differently was added a bit more cayenne pepper. We like that extra little kick. Thank you for sharing. I guess now I have a NEW recipe. Will retire mine sadly, but it's okay. I will be fine and thank you again.

5 stars X 2. This recipe is amazing good. The only thing I changed was I used ground chipotle pepper instead of cayenne. Best eaten with a spoon. LOL

Fantastic!  My kids (17, 13, and 12) love this and often request it. I omit the jalapeño because I don't usually have one on hand.  I use fire roasted red peppers that come in a huge jar from Costco - they're cheaper and then I have plenty for other things. This spread is so much better than store-bought.  I highly recommend it!

Great cheese spread with a kick.  I love, love, love pimento cheese spread and I think this southern recipe has just become my favorite!  I did add the cayenne pepper and a small jalapeno pepper to give this spread just the right amount of zip.  Thanks Queenreyney for submitting this awesome recipe.

This is the BEST pimento cheese recipe ever! Each time I make this recipe, people offer to pay me to make it for them. I always double the recipe and never add to or take away from it...You can't improve on perfection. It is so "rich" that it goes a long way. This will be the only pimento cheese recipe I will use for the rest of my life.  Thanks!

Fabulous recipe!  I have had so many compliments when serving this.  I love to use it to make grilled cheese sandwiches.  I add a slice of fresh tomato on top of the pimento cheese when grilling...delicious!

This recipe quickly became a family favorite!  I chop the pimento, and I like it a little hotter, so I add an extra jalapeno pepper (I have also used Hungarian hot wax peppers).  If I don't have any hot peppers on hand, I substitute ~ 1/2 tsp. Tabasco sauce.  The one change I made is to add 1-1 1/2 Tbs. Worchestershire sauce, because we like the additional flavor.  We eat it on Triscuit, on celery, as a sandwich spread (it's great on thick slices of Italian bread), and instead of regular cheese on hamburgers.

This stuff is great! I've made it several times, and have learned the hard way that you must use extra sharp cheddar, or else it is a bit bland.  I chopped up some stuffed green olives, and it added a little twist, which I liked.  Thank you.

I had already been making this dip with one difference.  In the past, I've made it with bacon so when I saw this recipe, I thought it was funny how similar it was to my dip.  So, I followed your measurements and made it your way plus added chopped bacon for my bunko group this passed weekend.  It was a huge hit!  Thanks!

This did not taste like the traditional pimento cheese so I was somewhat disappointed.  Maybe it was the cream cheese or the garlic powder that gave it an off taste.  Sorry but I will not make this one again.

This is a great recipe as-is.  The extra-sharp cheddar makes a difference.  My preference is to add a splash or two of Worcestershire sauce or sriracha.  A variation of the recipe (with a little kick) is to replace one cup of cheddar cheese with pepper jack cheese. Have you ever made grilled pimiento cheese sandwiches? Sooo good!

I have made this recipe several times.  The first time I only used 1/2 a jalapeno because  I was worried about the heat.  However, after the first batch, given the amount of cream cheese, cheese and mayo it could really handle the whole jalapeno.  I eventually added the worcestershire sauce and a little dried mustard which really enhances the dish.  I have used it in a tortilla and made a quesadilla with it.  It was fabulous.  Its great on an English muffin.  We like to eat them with lightly salted tortilla chips.

6.11.17  I added the jalapenos and the cayenne and really liked what they brought to this pimento cheese spread. I didn’t have a jar of diced pimento on hand, but I did have some roasted red bell pepper in the fridge, so I just chopped that up.  For my own personal taste, think I’ll cut back the cream cheese and add a little bit of dry mustard next time, but this definitely is a good recipe.  And to keep in totally true to its name, I did use Duke’s, THE Mayonnaise of the South!! *****UPDATE 6.13.17*****  I've updated my review from 4 to 5 stars because this tastes just about perfect to me after it sat in the fridge overnight!

My husband asked for Pimento Cheese and since it is so expensive to buy pre-made I decided to find a recipe for it. I made no substitutions to this recipe but did add dried mustard and Worcestershire sauce as another reviewer suggested and found it to be pretty good. For me, only 4 stars is based on the jalapeno. While fresh jalapenos are good in this recipe, I think pickled would be better. I will definitely make this again

I wasn't crazy about this. I think it was too much cream cheese. I ended up adding more cheese, pimentos, and mayo to try to make it more to my taste. I liked it best as grilled cheese, but won't make it again.

This was my first attempt at pimento cheese and it turned out very good. I used extra sharp 2% cheddar, fat free cream cheese, and light mayo, and minced garlic rather than powder. Proportions were good. I did use extra cayenne. Can't wait to try it again. Planning to add gouda next time, as a restaurant here makes it that way and it is great. Great recipe.

This was so good. It makes a great sandwich and I will not buy store bought again. I made as directed, but was surprised there was not really a bite from the jalapeno or cayenne so I amped up the spice a bit!

I made half this recipe for us to snack on while watching the football game.  It was good but I do think it needed just a pinch of salt.  I also thought it could have used a little more mayonnaise.  I did add some extra pimentos and some of the liquid from the pimento jar trying to achieve the consistency I was after.  I would make this again, but would bump up the mayo next time.

a bit strong for our taste buds. If I make in the future I am going to leave out the cayenne, and jalapeno pepper. I'm either going to lessen garlic to 1/8 tsp or completely omit the garlic and onion. use sharp cheddar, 3/4 cup mayo, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper.

I've never made my own pimento cheese before this recipe and now I'll never buy it pre-made again.  Based on what I had at home I substituted 6 ounces of non-fat Greek yogurt and 2 ounces of jalapeno cream cheese for the 8 oz. plain cream cheese.  I didn't have a fresh jalapeno but substituted 2.5T of chopped jalapeno from a jar.  Finally, 2 cups of cheese didn't seem enough.  I ended up using 1 C of shredded pepper jack and 4 C of shredded sharp cheddar.  All other proportions remained the same.  The end result is fantastic. The only problem is that it has an addictive quality that forces us to use our will power to make it last.

Yummy!!!!!! This is truly brilliant Pimento Spread!! Sooo Delish! I feel tweaking it slightly with 1/2 tsp onion pwdr and 1/4 tsp white sugar plays up the sweetness of the pimento and,  using white pepper, lets the cayenne ring true.

Made this according to the instructions.  Good recipe but too much cream cheese.  I will definitely make this again using half the cream cheese.  Thanks for the recipe.

YUM! My husband and I are on a low carb diet and this works great with celery or romaine leaves for a crunchy replacement for other snacks that we can't have. I didn't have pimientos but had some frozen chopped red chili pepper that gave it some color and spice. I am going to submit it on Spark People as a low carb recipe and will give you credit for it QUEENRENEY!

I made only two changes to the recipe.  One, I did not use a jalapeño pepper.  Two, I have no onion powder so just grated a fresh onion using the finest side, more onion juice and mush than onion

I made this last night, and HOLY MOLEY, this is good! It took a lot of restraint to stop eating it. My only tweak to this recipe was that I added BACON. (Because bacon makes everything better!) It is great on its own just as the recipe is written, but if you like bacon, add some and that will just really take it over the top. Thanks for the recipe! I'll be making this over and over!

I was concerned that this might be too hot with the cayenne and jalapeño but it wasn't. Totally love this recipe. I use it for grilled cheese sandwiches.

I made this as directed and found that we do not like cream cheese in our pimento spread.  Also we like it a little on the sweet side.  I added more cheese, doubled the pimento and added a touch of sugar and it was salvageable.  Thanks for the post as there are many favorable reviews.

Made this a little lighter by using Neufchatel cheese and 1/4 cup Greek yogurt with 1/4 mayo.  It makes an awesome gooey grilled cheese sandwich.

Outstanding! I love spicy pimento cheese spread and this recipe is a keeper. I just pulsed everything in the food processor being careful not to over mix it so that it had some texture and it took seconds. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I am Southern thru and thru but have never had pimento cheese that wasn't a little sweet.  I missed that, so I added about 1 1/2 tbsp of sugar and mixed it well and it was better.  I wasn't overly impressed.  I have had better pimento cheese and will keep searching for the perfect one.

People from the south came over and ate this, and took the leftovers home.  The only thing I might change next time is to add more cayenne and jalapeno because I like it hot.  When I ate it, I put on some sriracha (a red vietnamese hot sauce) and it was marvelous on hawaiian rolls.

Made this for New Years Eve as is (omitted optional jalapeño) and it was raved bout by everyone at 2 different parties.  If you have it, be sure to use Duke's for the mayo.  I'll be making this again just for myself.

I only had 1/2 the cream cheese so I made up the difference with Greek yogurt.  Used a couple of pinches of Cajun seasoning as it was close to the front and didn't require the chair climb the cayenne did (lazy!)  Otherwise I made it as written and all I can say is THANK YOU!  True to the traditional southern style with a delicious, spicy twist.  A keeper!

This recipe is the bomb! We made this for guests dropping by over the holidays.  My husband and I decided to make half the recipe with jalapenos and half without.  I have to say that the jalapeno version went very quickly!  It really only adds a little heat, but it is so flavorful! Easy, delicious and popular with guests...sounds good to me!  A definite keeper - thanks!

All I can say WOW! I tried the recipe exactly as written only difference is I used 2oz of pimentos because of preference. Don't tell my mother but I think it was better then hers. With the extra sharp cheese and the spices blanketed in a creamy goodness, it was like a party in my mouth. Went great with club crackers.

Very Good.  I used the cayenne pepper and a jalapeno and it wasn't hot at all.  Very pleasant flavor.  Grocery store was out of pimento, so I chopped up jarred roasted red peppers as a substitute.

Love love love love. I made this for the second time tonight. I have always loved good pim cheese, but unfortunately so much is not at all good. I like it chunky (vs the "cooked" style that uses processed cheese. I actually love processed cheese, but not for pimento cheese!) and I'd never had it with jalepenos before making it myself with this recipe, even though I've lived in the South my whole life! The only real change I made was to only put about half the amount of cream cheese the recipe calls for, 4 oz. But I'm not the biggest cream cheese fan--I'm sure it's great as is. THANK YOU for this recipe!! It will be a family staple from now on, that's for sure.

LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this!!!!! Great combo of flavors. I did omit the jalapeno, but that was my only change. The cayenne provided just the right amount of heat, and I did not need to use any salt, so taste it first before you add any just in case. I'm glad I decided to make the whole recipe as the family will not quit eating it! :) I will def be making this again and again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Crazy, crazy good. When I first made this, my dinner party swarmed on this like locusts. Anyone that I make this for swears I put crack in it. It makes amazing grilled cheese sandwiches too. I don't alter a thing.  It is one of my favorite indulgences, thank you so much for this recipe!

I always grew up eating Mrs Grissom's pimento cheese and used to love it. I hadn't had it in years and tried it recently and it was so gross! This was the first recipe I came across and I tried it. OMG, this is amazing and what pimento cheese should be. Not a fan of jalapeños so I didn't add them, but I did add the dry mustard and worstershire the first time and haven't changed it. I've made it numerous times and everyone always raves about it. It is better if it sits overnight, but usually doesn't last that long. I will make sandwiches with it, but love spreading it on crackers. Thank you for a delicious recipe!

Family favorite for parties. To keep this authentic one must of course use Dukes mayo.

I have made this several times and the only thing I have modified is that I put less pimentos and cayenne pepper than it calls for because my children are not big fans.  However, my co-workers like it hot and begged me for the recipe.   Great on top of burgers and with crackers for tail-gating too!

Left out the jalapeño (my hubby is a weenie when it comes to spicy stuff) but added a little ancho chili powder. This was AMAZING and so simple!  Can't wait to try it as s grilled cheese!!

This is the only version of pimento cheese I make. It's so good. Once when I didn't have any pimientos I substituted piquillo peppers (peppers plus the oil they were packed in--which had a spin through a mini food processor/chopper until they were small enough to easily blend) and that worked well. Sometimes I add dried chopped onions if I don't have onion powder.  Mostly, I just follow this delicious recipe!

Made this today because of how many stars the recipe recieved, and couldn't figure out  why it just tasted ok. Started reading through reviews to see suggested tweaks to the recipe and realized I forgot to add cayenne!! Added it, and suddenly became the most amazing pimento cheese spread ever. Give it a couple shots of crystal hot sauce for extra oomph. Great recipe, thank you!

I make this often for church events, making sandwiches with the spread and they always go fast.  I recieve compliments on these all the time.  I double the recipe. When I have time, I roast my own red peppers and onions, instead of using pimento and onion powder.  I sometimes use cream cheese with jalapeno already in it and always add a dash of Worcester sauce.  I like to refrigerate it over night so that the flavors can marry. Using extra sharp chedder cheese is a must.

Need good a Low Carb recipe and this works perfect. Did not have jalapeno on hand but I did have Pepper Jack cheese so took out a little of the reg cheddar and added it in for a little flavor. Nothing wrong with the recipe, I'm just a weirdo and want eat anything with Mayo in it so used a little sour cream and plain greek yogurt. So glad to have found the information on the mustard powder and Worcestershire Sauce truly think that is what sets this apart. Made a large batch and using it for sandwiches, dips, toppings for meat and casseroles, added bacon to some and made an Redneck Chicken Cordon Blue, possibilities are endless......

I never made pimento cheese before, but I always wanted to. I followed the recipe fairly closely with a few variations. I didn't have extra sharp cheddar, so I used regular cheddar. I didn't have a jalapeño, so I used jalapeño flakes. I eyeballed the garlic and onion powders. I used 4 large pimentos. When I tasted it, it really wasn't spicy enough for me, so I added a bit of sirracha. Perfect!

Ok so this receipt is amazing on any cracker, or a nice tart green apple slice. But most of all I made some grilled cheese sandwiches using potato bread, a slice of mild cheddar cheese, bacon, a few crumbles of feta and then a health smear of this pimento cheese spread.  Absolutely amazing. Thank you sharing this receipt.

Perfect recipe! I made it as written but left out the optional peppers. I also added 1 tsp of the pimento liquid back in for the extra flavor. I use the whipped cream cheese since it is more spreadable. Is now a regular item in my fridge! No way I could ever eat store bought again.

I used Chef Paul's Redfish Magic instead of cayenne, salt and pepper. I didn't have jalapeños either! But it's still amazing! Especially with cracked pepper and olive oil triscuits!

Anytime I've ever had this spread, it's always been in a jar from the store, and it's SSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO expensive! This recipe was even better than store-bought, and it's quick, easy, and moderately priced. It's so great to have a taste of the south again since I moved to New York! Thanks for a great recipe, this one's a keeper!

Absolutely LOVED this.  The only thing I did a little different was use about half a jar of pickled jalapeños diced.  This is definitely added to my regime of "go to" recipes!!

I like this recipes as is, but I have tweaked it as I have made it again & again with these touches...Reduce the amount of Garlic powder slightly. Add 1/4 teaspoon of hot smoked paprika, a pinch of dry mustard powder, omit the jalapeno (because I never have on hand) and I used roasted red peppers instead of pimentos...Cheaper & I think better...can keep in the freezer. Sometimes I throw in a hand full of walnuts for fun. Addictive!!

It's perfect for a tennis match if you draw the substantial/main dish.  Easy to make the night before.  Hardy enough to feel like you've eaten something but you don't need a napkin and a plate to shove it, with a cracker or a celery stick, in your mouth and get back on the court between the 2nd and the 3rd.  I've taken it 3X now and gotten plenty of compliments - even from the opponents.

I have made this three times now.... the third time just now.  I kept the recipe exactly how it's written and everyone LOVES this spread!!  You need to use the really sharp cheddar (white not orange) and dice the pimentos really well for better distribution. I do add the cayenne pepper and the jalapeno pepper because that's what makes this southern pimento cheese spread rise above the others. One more thing - I make this the day before because the flavors meld wonderfully in the time period.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This is a very flavorful recipe. Perfect for a cheese spread or a cheese ball. Just roll in pecans. For great pimento cheese, I suggest doubling the mayo and cutting the cream cheese in half. Perfect!

Delicious and easy! I followed the recipe EXACTLY the first time (minus the optional jalapeno). Next time I will likely add a little more cayenne or maybe a dab of mustard. But this recipe deserves 5 stars.

This is a great recipe.  I made it just as it was written and went together quickly...the hardest part was finding something to pry the pimento jar open with...Have tried it and it really is good. So much better and fresher than what you can buy...thank you!

Excellent recipe!  I used two 4-ounce jars of pimiento as well as an additional two ounces of sharp cheddar cheese.  We loved the addition of jalapeno peppers and cayenne.

My husband loved it.  he said it was cheekily it was like wine - had more complex flavors than he was expecting.  My teenage daughter gave it a thumbs up and said it was nothing like the stuff we buy in a tub at the store.  The only change I made was necessary - I shredded some colby jack into it to have enough cheese.  Maybe 3 oz.  Other than that no changes.  did not see the need.  It was awesome.

Made this with the optional jalapeno (FRESH) and cayanne and added 1/4 tsp dried mustard and 1/4 tsp Worcestershire as others who have rated this recipe had recommended.    As someone who has never tasted pimento cheese, I can say that I enjoyed it on wheat thin crackers, but it was nothing spectacular as everyone has raved.  
I think it needs MORE KICK. I let it refrigerate overnight before eating it...
I will experiment next time.    UPDATE: This time I used soft cream cheese and it didn't harden so much in the refrigerator and remained spreadable.  I also added a couple dashes of Franks pepper sauce and added in 2 more oz pimentos.   You can never have too many pimentos.    This recipe is VERY FLEXIBLE served cool/cold on crackers.  5 stars with your own touches!!   UPDATE: 2 days later, I used some of this to make a grilled cheese sandwich as so many have recommended.   YUCK!!!   The cream cheese melts to a drippy mess, I would never serve this as a grilled cheese sandwich.  This is strictly an unformed cheese ball people!!!!!!

Very good, though I only had 6 ounces of cream cheese and used more shredded cheese.  However, I found that the cream cheese made the spread slightly too thick and rich when served cold.  It did melt to a beautiful texture warm.  When making this again I would cut the cream cheese more if I were planning on serving it cold and keep it at 6oz for hot.

thanks for supplying your recipe.  Yes I tweaked  this recipe a bit, but I almost ate the whole bowl so it worked.  first off if you use the whipped cream cheese than you don't have to wait for room temp block and you can make the spread using a fork to mix.  Also pimentos that come in a jar don't have much flavor so if you like it sweet then add your favorite sweet relish .    I used the red Thai chili sauce that all supermarkets have.  it comes in a bottle and has diced red chilis and garlic.  its sweet from the rice vinegar.  In stead of fresh jalapeño, I used my favorite pickled diced hot peppers from the jar.  Salt and pepper are important and I used onion powder and cayenne.  it all worded well and I used mayo and sharp cheddar and just eyeballed what I wanted.  Can't stress how well the whipped cream cheese was for texture here.  Merry Christmas, and happy holidays to all.

I love this recipe with yakaty's suggestions. I am doing the Atkins diet so I use this to stuff celery. An even better idea is omitting the jalapenos and stuffing blanched jalapenos with this. Yum!

I just made this. I did leave out the jalapenos and reduced the mayo to 1/3 cup. It was very good but...for me, I thought it was just too much cream cheese. Almost every recipe that I came across said to add the same amount (8 oz.). I will definitely make again and not use all of the cream cheese and keep the mayo at 1/2 cup and see if I like it better.

As directed, I give this 4 stars. 2nd time around, my modifications took it to 5 stars according to my family. Following is what I did: absolutely essential to use a GOOD quality extra sharp cheddar - regular grocery store type doesn't have much flavor; and the careful addition of Worcestershire sauce is a must, as well. I kicked up the onion powder and cayenne a bit, to taste. Also added some onion salt and garlic salt, to taste, instead of salt and pepper. My husband doesn't like it with jalapenos, but my sons do; so I make it without for him. The boys and I like it both ways; so either way is fine for us:-).

My husband and I have eaten Batch after Batch f this stuff. It is by far the BEST recipe for Pimento cheese. It's great in sandwiches, on Hamburgers, Quesidillas, and our favorite is with Townhouse Flipsides crackers and pepperoni slices.

Very Good lots of flavor.  Do not use pre-grated packaged cheese...It makes a difference.  I did follow reviews and add 1-2 drops of worcestershire sauce and  I used my own put up roasted red peppers as that is what I had on hand.  Worked just as well.  Agree that the extra sharp cheese is best.  The only thing I would change for next time is to back off the garlic powder just a bit as it lingers in the aftertaste.  I wouldn't omit it totally though.  Even better after sitting overnight.

This is the best pimento cheese I have ever had. It is so easy to make! So much better than the store bought stuff. It does not have all the chemicals in it and I know it is made with fresh, wholesome ingredients! Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I'm not southern but this cheese might inspire me to move!  Made this exactly as written when the kids were in town and couldn't keep even my calorie-conscious daughter away from it.  It's even better the longer it sits and I ended up making sandwiches with it for a quick snack on game night.  Wouldn't change anything about this recipe.

I added extra pimentos and some pimento juice because I really enjoy a prominent pimento flavor in my cheese. Also added a bit more cayenne. Great texture and flavor! Makes the best grilled cheese!!

Fabulous!!! I put this on a piece of toast to try it, and wow! I was totally blown away. I did add the jalapeno (jarred variety), and omitted the salt and pepper at the end. The bf LOVED it. Thanks, Queenreyney, it's a keeper!

I was looking for a good pimento cheese recipe and this certainly had a good flavor.  I did not add the jalapeno or the cayenne but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My only criticism is that I thought it had too much of a garlic powder aftertaste (and I love garlic).  Next time I will probably leave the garlic powder out or use fresh garlic instead.  Otherwise it was very good.

I love this recipe.  I do add a little more seasonings and some finely chopped jalapenos and serrano peppers for heat- but it is awesome as is.  Makes celery pop and for a great treat try it as a grilled pimento cheese sandwich on wheat bread with fresh tomato!  A+ addition

This was ok. Don't like the cream cheese in it,  but wanted to try it.

I had some leftover pimento peppers I needed to finish off and this was a perfect fit. This seems like it will be great on bagels, sandwiches, crackers ...  Tonight we had it on bread with smoked salmon on top.

Excellent!  Made this to take on camping trip to Denali Nat'l Park and so glad I did!  There was so much sightseeing going on, who wanted to stop and fix and bunch of food...not me!  This spread was awesome and super easy to travel with.  The jalapeno gave it just enough oomph, but not overwhelming whatsoever.  It makes for a yummy sandwich too.  Made mine following ingredients exactly; finely shredded cheese with a kitchenaid fine grater, added all the stuff to the bowl, and then beat everything together on high with a handheld mixer.  Perfect.

This was pretty good overall, but a bit bland even though it was spicy hot.  Think I will use only half as much cream cheese next time for more cheddar flavor.

While this is said to be a Southern staple, neither I nor my friends (in Maryland) had had it. We all vaguely remember our mothers buying a spread that came in a little jar. This was totally different and everypne really enjoyed it. will be making it again, soon!

I love this spread. It’s assembled quickly and tastes marvelous. I added half of the jalapeño and doubled the spices. This gave it a more intense flavor that paired well with Ritz crackers. My Cajun boyfriend wanted more jalapeño, of course. Make it a day ahead, refrigerate, and then let it come back to room temp. This will loosen it up and make it perfect for dipping. A solid win on this one.

Made this and wish I had doubled it! I didn’t use the jalapeño but added a little extra cayenne pepper. I like that flavor much better than jalapeño. It truly is a southern style, which I like since I’m from Alabama.

It's good, but I'm hoping the flavors combine better in the fridge overnight. I added a tad of smoked paprika, and will definitely be adding the dry mustard per the tips in the comments.

Thanks to QueenReyNey for the great recipe! And thanks to Yakaty for the suggestion of mustard powder & Worcester Sauce. I also took Boxermom's suggestion & folded in the cheese, pimentos & jalapenos. And I followed V's advice & fire roasted my own sweet peppers. It turned out beautifully!

This was awesome, tasted so much better than store bought and healthier! I just added a little extra onion and garlic powder because I like a stronger taste but really didn't have to do this because it was perfect just the way recipe reads!!

We love this recipe! I don’t like mine real hot, but a little bite, so I skip the jalapeño. I do use the Worcester sauce and I add a little banana pepper juice. It’s the best we’ve had. :)

After reading so many people saying they ate it right out of the bowl immediately after making it, I was so darn disappointed in the taste. Yuck. I decided to leave it in the fridge overnight and see if I could salvage it in the morning. Woah!! It was amazing the next day. I guess it gave the flavors time to meld. I served it on triscuits, cucumber slices, and with slices of red bell peppers and celery. Excellent. 

Only change I made was to use pickled jalapeños.

We love this southern classic! I use Duke's  Mayo and Sargento extra sharp cheddar cheese. In the summer I use jalapeno's from my garden. I eat it on crackers, grilled cheese, burger's etc. It is a staple in the south and much more cost effective (and tastier) when you make it yourself.

This is such a wonderful and flavorful recipe.  I purchased Duke's Mayonnaise as some reviewers suggested and grated the extra-sharp cheddar cheese myself, I also left out the jalapenos as I'm not much on "hot" anymore.  This is a wonderful recipe!  I took it to a pot luck at church with rye bread and it was gone in a flash! I'm making it again using a soft spreadable cream cheese because I want to see if it will be spreadable just out of the refrigerator. I hate to have to wait for it to soften a bit before eating it!  As other reviewers commented, I'm going to add some Worcestershire sauce and ground mustard to see what that's all about too.  Hoping it will turn out but if not the original recipe is amazing.  Thank you for sharing it!

Felt like it needed more shredded cheese and less cream cheese.  But overall taste/texture was wonderful and creamy. Added sl more cayenne and the bite was perfect!

Absolutely delicious. I made the exact recipe as described and it was truly fantastic. I will say, if making this in your kitchen aid mixer, it will come out extremely smooth, which makes a great spread. If you like more consistency, I think the same thing could be done with using a spoon, given the cheese and cream cheese are well softened. Definitely a five-star recipe, and one I will be looking forward to making in the future.

This is a Fantastic pimento cheese its not your "typical" southern recipe but its like southern gravy each to their own!! I did adjust 3 things on this i cut the cream cheese in HALF b/c the other way is more dip like and i scaled back just a smidge on the onion powder and left out the jalapenos b/c kiddos were eating it! I will be making this again!

This was wonderful as you outlined.  Most pimento recipes are nearly exactly the same. All hAve garlic and all have cream cheese.  You took this to another level with the extra kick you suggested.  I'm going to try it with black olives and red hot peppers of choice along with the pimentos  (I grow several types annually). I'm glad I clicked on this recipe.

Absolutely awesome! And I always give a jar to my Dad and every time it's empty, he brings it back to me for a refill! I definitely add the jalapeño and I do bump up the cayenne because we love a kick! Next time I might try the Worcestershire, but as is it's fantastic!!

OMG delicious. I added a little more garlic powder, onion powder and doubled the pimentos.

This is the worst pimento cheese recipe I have ever made.  I am a long time southerner and no southerner would ever claim this recipe.  It has too much cream cheese, to the point you loose the taste of the cheddar cheese.  Even though increased the amount of jalapeno, it was tasteless.

You may want to hold back the cheese and mix other ingredients, then fold into the grated cheese. Be sure to grate cheese from a block, pre-grated has a cellulose coating to keep it from clumping.  I did tweek ingredients to just 1/2 the cream cheese and used dijon mustard, not regular mustard.  A bit of chopped chives makes the spread colorful. I don't care for hot peppers but did add a Tbs of Adobo Sauce from a can of Chipotles (gives a smokey flavor).  Thank you for a great recipe :-)

The BEST pimento cheese I have EVER eaten!! I reduce the cayenne pepper and leave out the jalapeno for my own personal taste. However, do not omit the cayenne as it really makes a difference. My husband much prefers it with the jalapeno. I also prefer roasted red pepper in place of pimento. Easy to make. I will never purchase pimento cheese spread again!

This is my first time making pimento cheese.  I made it exactly as directed and tasted it.  Apparently there are differing styles of pimento cheese.  The kind I'm used to in Kentucky has a sweetness to it.  Which, as you can see from the ingredients, this will not really have. This is most likely due to the fact that pimento cheese around here is typically made with Miracle Whip as apposed to plain mayo.  I added some apple sauce and a smidge of sugar to bring it to close to what people expect from pimento cheese around here (had to add a bit more cheese to balance out the consistancy).  It has a pretty significant bite to it.  I will likely make it next time with a mix of regular sharp (instead if extra sharp) and mild cheddar.  I may even add some Velveeta *gasp*. However, pretty good place to start for building your own recipe.

I made this today and WOW! Delicious!  I made it exactly as written but without the jalapeño and I cut the cayenne by half, so just the perfect kick for me. My husband has never liked pimento cheese from the grocery but really likes this.

I had been wanting a good homemade pimento cheese sandwich, so I googled it online. I went through many recipes trying to find one that sounded like what I remember eating when I was younger, when I came upon this recipe that seemed the closest. I made it as written, except that I did not measure the spices, and probably put more garlic and onion powders and cayenne that it called for. I didn't have a jalapeno on hand, so that was omitted. It turned out really comparable to what I remembered. I will make it again sometime and probably add actual chopped onion and a clove or two of garlic instead of the powders, and a jalapeno.

Nicely done! This recipe has all the ingredients one of my favorite store-bought pimento cheese spreads has (the company is from Pawley's Island, SC, close to this recipe's author). This recipe is even better than that high-end store-bought brand. I made mine with two-year aged cheddar and made sandwiches (I added a couple of slices of bacon to each sandwich). Fabulous!

Like any southerner, I grew up on pimiento cheese sandwiches, and I love them. This pimiento cheese recipe is incredible. The only change I made was that I put in green olives instead of jalapenos, and it was wonderful! Thank you so much for sharing with us!

I love it, my husband is still looking for a bit more...  His father made the best, but no recipe.  Our adult children and their families love it, toooo.
I used but more of the grated sharp cheddar, added a small block of the new Velvetta Sharp, and added some leftover cheese from my fridge - Swiss, Provolone and some Colby Jack. (The sliced was shredded in my food processor).  I also added a touch of Rice Wine Vinegar.

I didn't have garlic powder, so I substituted roasted garlic powder. I loved it. The roasted garlic and jalapeno made it awesome. Great recipe. My first time making pimento cheese and it turned out so good it even surprised me. Being a beginner cook makes each recipe an adventure.

I went to college in the south and ever since I've had something of an obsession with pimento cheese. My roommates and I always would buy the store bought kind, and it never occurred to me that I could make my own. Well, having moved across the country I quickly found that I would either learn how to make it on my own- or go hungry! I've tried my fair share of recipes and this one is by far my favorite. I tweaked it slightly and substituted a dried heirloom pepper from our garden for the jalapeño and I am over the moon with how it turned out. The addition of cream cheese gives it a great mouth feel and the kick of hot peppers balances the sweetness of the pimentos perfectly.

I used Frank's RedHot Original Sauce (it is a cayenne pepper  sauce) instead of cayenne pepper, but stayed true to the recipe other than that. It tastes very much like our favorite cheese ball,  so it is a hit! Thanks for the recipe!

This was very similar to a version at the store. Very tasty. I don't know how this happened, but I am out of cayenne pepper. GASP! So, to give it more kick, I added diced green chilies bc that is what I had....plus the jalapeno.

This is - by far - the best pimento cheese recipe! I love pimento cheese, but the store brands are always so mushy! I like being able to adjust the mayo and cream cheese ratios to make a heartier version. Worcestershire and dry mustard give it an extra tang that makes it so delectable!

Have eaten this all over the south when traveling. It's a hotel staple when I am on business in the southern states...but we don't have any grocery stores that carry it in Phoenix, so this was helpful to make my own.  So bad for you, but so delicious as a treat.  I leave out the Cream cheese and Jalapenos.  Too crunchy and hot a bite. and not authentic to any of the ones I have in the south.

I didn't have any onion powder but this pimento cheese is still delicious!  I did use Worcestershire sauce and added a splash of lemon juice.   I read lemon juice in the ingredients of a locally made pimento cheese and decided to throw some in.  I confess I don't do a lot of measuring except in baking so the only ingredient I used exactly as instructed is cream cheese.  This is good stuff!

I did try it and I really like it. I do think for the tame at heart it would be a bit much Cayenne, however I use home grown and ground so it has a bit "fresher" Kick to it. I just happen to be one of those "Chili Heads" that love the punch it added.

This is my hubby's favorite!! We omit the pimentos and load up with jalapenos - about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of chopped jalapenos gives it a great kick.

Fantastic! I grew up on the stuff from the grocerie store then I lived in NC for a year and discovered REAL pimento cheese. Now living in NM there is no trace of it and mine just never blew me away until now. I followed the recipe exactly; which is rare, and added the worcheshire. Perfect! Thank you.

Incredible! I've made this twice. First time I pretty much followed the instructions to the tee.  It was outstanding. Second time I used Kraft "Triple Cheese with a Touch of Cream Cheese", 8 ounce bag in place of the cheeses listed. Whoa... it got seriously good. The Kraft cheese includes Vermont White Cheddar, Sharp Cheddar, and Mild Cheddar and of course a Touch of Cream Cheese. I'm not big on hot so I left the peppers out.

Lately I've been craving something along the lines of pimento cheese spread but like so many I've only had premade versions until now...Oh my this was heavenly! I used the base recipe then split a few portions off to play with some of the modifications others had made. In my final batch I used a tablespoon of dijon mustard and and increased the cayenne and a dash of curry powder. I also added  a squirt or two of siracha in place of jalepeno's which unfortunately gives me heartburn. If I had any changes of my own to include I would actually get a larger jar of pimento's but that's because I like the contrast.

Finally...this is the version I have made for a long time but lost due to a fire...my memory would not recall it and I was going nuts looking for it since it has cream cheese.  Unfortunately, Duke's is up to nearly six bucks a jar here so it will have to do with Hellmans...almost as good.  The only thing I do differently is to only add one of the spicy elements, either the cayenne or the jalapeno but not both.  Thanks for posting this!

I have made this many times for my family! I have used the optional amount of cayenne instead of the jalapeño. This time there was no cayenne in the pantry. I used a 1/2 tsp. of sugar instead! It came out DELICIOUS! It tastes like many Southern pimento cheeses I have had! Try it! : )

My pimento cheese was similar and my granddaughter calls it "hot cheese", however, this recipe really kicked it up a notch and without a doubt the best I have ever eaten.

Great!  I made this for the first time last Christmas.  Now it is what everyone calls and counts on me to bring to the events.  Love it! Made it almost exact but only used 1/4 of the jalapeno!  I am a wimp when comes to peppers!

Except for the cayenne, this is my mum's recipe and it's delicious, especially if it is allowed to sit overnight. I find that creaming the mayo and cream cheese first with the spices gives a much smoother and more even flavor. Thanks, Queen!

This has become a staple in our refrigerator, I've probably made this recipe at least 100x. Everyone LOVES it!! It's not the goopy, sloppy store bought pimento cheese, this is delicious. I tweak the basic recipe very little, and it's only for personal preference not to improve. My husband prefers dried chopped onions rather than onion powder. It gives a slight crunch. I use Cracker Barrel 2% milk extra sharp cheddar cheese and Harris Teeter brand Neufachel instead of cream cheese. It saves a bit on the fat and calories and gives a really creamy pimento cheese. I get more raves and compliments using the 2% Cracker Barrel and Neufachel. I've substituted low fat Mayo and olive oil mayo- just not the same taste. Hellman's real Mayo with the navy blue lid is the way to go.

Eating this on celery fresh out of the bowl as I type. Great easy recipe. I did add the Worcestershire, spicy brown mustard and pickled jalapenos. I also used chipotle powder as I prefer that flavor. I made half a recipe and only measured the cheese. I also used a mix of salad dressing and sour cream. Not a big fan of mayo.

Without a doubt the best pimento cheese spread I have ever had or made!  I even spread it on a burger and had the best cheese burger ever!  Made it just like the recipe but without the jalapeno (didn't have one on hand) and I don't think it could be any better.

Wonderful recipe!! I followed the directions, minus the jalapeño and it turned out wonderful. Next time I'll try adding the mustard and worchestershire . Hope I can keep my hands of it until tomorrow while we watch the Masters.i grew up in Georgia and ate pimento cheese on and off, I'm originally from New Jersey and my mom just never made it. But I tried some from publix and was amazed at how fantastic it was and felt likei had been missing out on it. I also figured I'd make it myself since it was pretty simple ingredients. This recipe is fantastic. Can't wait to make again.

Really really good. I didn't have super sharp I just had regular sharp so I subbed about 3/4 of a cup cheddar for shredded queso blanco velveeta so it would have the sharp it needed. I'm not a pimento cheese lover by any means but this stuff is pretty darn good.

My husband mentioned that his family had pimento cheese every Christmas eve.  This year I surprised him and made this.  He said, "wow, I didn't know you could make it, we always bought a tub of it."  This recipe won hands down over the store bought tub.  It was yummy as a grilled cheese.

This recipe was a huge hit with family and friends.  I have made it multiple times and like to play with the cheeses to get a mix-and-match style and to remove the "sharpness" for those that prefer a more mild flavored cheese.  As for me, I use serano and sometimes habanero to kick up the heat.  This recipe was a great base...we love it!

This is perfect just the way it is.  It's sooooo good.  I love how it doesn't have that strong mayonnaise taste.  I can have this whipped up QUICK!  Delicious!

Growing up we never put cream cheese into our pimiento cheese, but it makes it so creamy and delish!  I used roasted red peppers and an extra cup of shredded cheddar since it wasn't extra sharp.  Serving it in celery and in heart shaped sandwiches for a Valentines themed brunch.

Definitely use the jalapenos, seeded completely if you don't want it spicy, but the flavor and texture really add a nice touch.  For those who think it needed something and they weren't sure, Sriracha is the answer.  It is delicious, use as much or little as you want.  Frank's makes it taste like buffalo wings.

YUM!! Very easy and tasty!  Used small jar (2 oz.) pimentos because that is what I had and added a small can of green chilies.  Served with Crackers and red pepper slices.  So many possible uses for this!!  Will definitely make again!!

This is good, but it tastes more like cheese ball than pimento cheese to me. Next time I will use less cream cheese and mayo and more cheddar.

This is some of the best pimento cheese I've ever eaten...and so easy to make! I've taken it to several functions and it always gets rave reviews and people ask me for the recipe. The only adjustment I make is to substitute jalapenos from a jar for the fresh one called for, simply because I always have the jarred ones on-hand.

Making this for a Halloween neighborhood get together.  So easy to make and very tasty.  I'm going to serve the cheese spread with crackers.  Can't believe I didn't have any jalapenos on hand despite living in the SW US.  Instead I seasoned it with a dash of dry mustard, white pepper and salt.  Next time I'll make it with the diced jalapenos or at least diced green peppers.

This is it!  This is hands down the best pimento cheese ever.  I prefer to use Sargento extra sharp cheddar cheese.  I would also recommend regular cream cheese. I made it once with Neufchâtel or low-fat cream cheese, and it was not as good. I prefer the minced jalapeño in mine.  Minced red onion makes a great addition too.

I made this to have with fried green tomatoes (by Diana Swenson).  My daughter in law hates tomatoes...she loved the fried green tomatoes with this cheese.  I've made this cheese a number of times now.  Always a hit.   I just add a touch more cayenne.  Spice is nice.

I loved this, I tried it just as written except for the jalepenos and thought it was super.   Next time I tried it with one cup extra sharp cheddar and 1 cup pepper jack cheese and lots of chili powder.   In my estimation it was even better and I will do it that way from now on.   Pimento cheese is one of my favorites, thank you so much.

Loved this and it was a hit at our tailgate.  I lightened it up a little by using 3rd less fat philly, light mayonnaise, then gave it lots of flavor with Cabot's Vermont Sharp Cheddar and doubled the Cayenne.  I put it with a platter of veggies rather than the usual ranch dip, AWESOME!

Great recipe. I was hesitant to use extra sharp cheese because its so strong by itself. But once I made it, I was glad I had. The extra sharp cheese adds zing. It would've been bland without it. I didn't change a thing, made as directed. Will make grilled sandwiches and tea sandwiches with it.

This was really good! I left out the jalapeño and the pepper, as I was sharing it with the Grandkids. (They loved it, by the way!) I did not add any salt, either. When I was preparing it, it tasted plenty salty. When I got it out to fix sandwiches, I thought it could use a little salt. Next time, a little salt and a little cayenne pepper! So much better than the stuff I get in the supermarket! Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe with one big change - I doubled the cheese to make it more cheese and less dip like. I used 4 tbsp minced onion instead of the powder and a little more cayenne.

VERY GOOD

The flavor is great!  My only problem, when following the directions was the amount of cheese to use.  I bought an 8oz. bag of shredded cheese and on the bag it said that 8oz. is equivalent to 2 cups.  When I mixed everything together, it seemed like the result was rather white from the cream cheese and mayo.  I added another entire 8 oz. bag of shredded cheese and now it's yellow and delicious.  I'd say a pound of cheese (16oz) makes this look yellow like pimento cheese you're accustomed to seeing.  Otherwise, it's mainly cream cheese and mayo.

I have made this a few times (with the optional cayenne and jalapeno-- got to have that mild kick!). It is very good as written, but I found that using 1/4 cup sour cream + 1/4 cup mayonnaise in place of the 1/2 cup mayo was more to my taste. Thanks for the recipe!

Great stuff, esp. with a little Cayenne/Jalapeno bite.  Other interesting options, chop up Green Olives and/or Sundried Tomatoes.

So easy and tasty! I used fat-free cream cheese and left out the salt, otherwise made it just as described in the recipe. The extra spices made it much more interesting than the usual pimento cheese recipes you see out there. I can't wait to try it with jalapeno!

The best pimento cheese, ever! The only thing we added was fresh chopped jalapeno peppers. I've also made a healthier version of it by using fat-free cottage cheese instead of mayo, and it's still really good!

Best recipe ever!!  I didn't realize I was out of cayenne pepper until it was too late, so, I substituted Tabasco sauce, about 12 drops.  This was the only change to the recipe I made.  I did NOT use the optional jalapenos, either.  May be a permanent staple in my fridge from here on out.

I thought I had pimentos in my hot little hands but what I went home with was roasted bell pepper and chipolte sauce.  No matter.  MY 3 teenagers went crazy as well as my husband.  AWESOME.

VERY close to the South Carolina pimento cheese that I love, but half the price! I used 3 cups shredded cheese instead of 2 since I like my p chz a little chunky. I used fat free cream cheese and Duke's light mayo. Overall, just 1 Weight Watcher's point per tablespoon. Thanks for a delicious recipe.

I'm editing my review to say I did taste mine after letting it sit for a couple days and it's absolutely amazing. The only problem, which was my fault, was using bagged shredded cheddar cheese. It tends to make the texture a bit grainy, so next time I'll grate it myself.

We had eaten all the Pimento Cheese that we bought in SC so I thought I would give this recipe a shot. Didn't have the fresh jalapeño but used ground jalapeño instead. SO GOOD! Thank you for the info! Even made it with low fat cheese and it was still great! (Don't tell my husband tho.)

I only had mild cheddar cheese and am not sure how much of a difference that made.  This was simple to make, but seemed like it needed something else to boost the taste.  Maybe the sharp cheddar??

Great recipe; I added a tbsp of Durkee sauce (will probably add a little more next time) and used 1 3/4 cups sharp cheddar and 1/4 cup Monterey Jack cheese.  I will not be buying Pimento cheese when this is better than anything you can get premade!

I ended up adding more than the 2 cups of shredded cheese just because it didn't seem cheesy enough for me and also about 1 t of Worcestershire.  I did not add the jalapeno although I did make jalapeno poppers using this pimento cheese.  This stuff is very good.

followed the author's suggestions of worchestershire and mustard and used ground chipotle and frank's red hot sauce since i was too lazy to get the jalapenos from the basement. it had a nice smoky hotness and this is by far the best pimento cheese i've ever had. thanks!

Hey Queenreyney, this is true southern 'minner cheese!" I'm lazy so I grate and blend in the food processor. It's fabulous with a hot bowl of chili in the winter and grilled with the fried green tomatoe in the sandwich. Awesome!

Delicious!   I didn't make any changes or substitutions.  The jalapeno and cayenne pepper give the cheese a nice subtle heat.  Perfect.  Thanks queenreyney!

So good! Do not hesitate to try this. My tweaks: I didnt have onion powder so use minced shallots; diced a 12 oz jar of roatsed red peppers for the pimientos; use a hand mixer and beat the cream cheese/mayo/seasonings and then folded the rest in. My guests last night called it "addictive" and ate every morsel (I served it as a dip w veggies).

We love pimento cheese spread but prepackaged brands very frequently are ho-hum, at best. Finally (why this took so long to occur to me I haven't the foggiest) I decided to look for a recipe to try. I made this exactly as described and My OH My ..... let's just say I will never buy pimento cheese spread again. This is absolutely scrumptious and is loved by the whole Fam! Thank you soooooo much!

This is the best pimento cheese recipe! Very easy to make. I DO NOT add any salt to the recipe and I use pickled jalapeños instead of a fresh one. Just adjust the jalapeños to how much heat you like! I also use the cayenne pepper.

Terrific Southern Pimiento Cheese recipe.  I love the pimiento taste so added an additional 2 oz.  Definitely use SHARP cheddar cheese.  Easy to spread on bread.  Many compliments on sandwiches.

Super recipe, but a little too creamy and not spicy enough.  I use 8oz shredded cheddar, 2 diced jalapenos, and 1/2 tsp cayenne. Perfect!

This is so good! I also added the Worcheshire just to see if it added anything. I tasted before I added it and I liked it just as well. I didn't really measure my spices though just added until I thought it tasted right.

OMG this is delish.  I have always paid a premium at a specialty store for a similar product and now I can make it myself.  I made exactly as stated (using low fat cream cheese) and would not change a thing.  Thank You Thank You Thank You!!!

I just made this for the teachers at Bible School tomorrow.  I went right by the recipe but had to leave out the jalapeno as some cannot tolerate spicy foods.  Also, sorry, couldn't find extra sharp cheddar, used sharp and it is still wonderful.  Best I have had!  Not a bit of bitterness which I have found in so many recipes for pimento cheese.  In the morning I will spread on the new wheat bread rounds that I love and take them to church.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  Can't wait to make it with the right cheese and jalapeno..I am a Texan and love hot peppers!

Love it as is. Just as an experiment, I added three shakes of worchestershire and 3 shakes of dill weed. Nice added touch if you like dill. Otherwise, excellent as is!!!

This is the only pimento cheese recipe to make. Definitely put the jalapeño in it too, I've made it both ways and the jalapeño makes it even better.  I get rave reviews when I make this.  It fits perfectly in a 26oz Bonne Maman jar after you finish the jelly, it looks great in those jars especially as a gift.

I have been on such a pimento cheese kick lately, so I am so thrilled to run across this recipe! The store I go to is a bit of an upscale grocery and charges $8 a container for it, so this will be much much better. Thanks! I’m sure it will turn out great

I love this recipe!!! I did make some alterations. I added 3oz of bacon bits, left out the salt(because of the saltiness of the bacon bits and jalapeños. This recipe is a big hit every time I make it. Thanks so much for sharing with us!!!

Perfect just the way the recipe is written! I have a 12,7 and 4 year old and they went crazy over it even though they are picky eaters. They ate it with crackers! Woke up this morning to find my husband eating it for breakfast! So now I just made another batch since the first one didn't even last a full day!

Great as is.  Our house likes it HOT so we add a lot of jalapeño peppers, as well as a bit of juice the juice from the jar! Yum. If we have company and I don't make this they are disappointed, that is how good this! Thanks so much for sharing!!

Made it by the recipe, with Duke's Mayo (the best!), which we can now buy in Michigan. I used to bring it home with me from my visits to Atlanta to see my son and his family, 6 jars at a time. The only change is I add 1/4 t dry mustard and 1/4c shredded parmesan. Love it!

Very good ! Something my grandma made in her Indiana farm kitchen. I did use a  teaspoon of Trader Joe’s Jalepeno Green Sauce & about a half Teaspoon of Trader Joe’s South African Smoke Blend Seasoning instead of the cayenne & chopped jalepeno..

I didn't add the pimentos or jalapeno peppers because of children eating it. I adjusted the recipe for 100 people. And mixed just the cream cheese, mayo and seasonings in the mixing bowl then added it to the cheese in a large roasting pan.  Really delicious!  Going to serve a lot of it on Kings Hawaiian Rolls.

Love that pimento flavor! I added another half a jar. I used 1/2 extra sharp cheddar 1/2 pepper Jack cheese and omitted the Cayenne entirely. Those are the only changes I made.  It didn't specify but I used a larger grate, next time I will use medium. Wonderful flavor!

This is delicious and super easy to make!  Followed the recipe exact.  However, next time, I plan to add chopped green onion, another jar of pimentos and substitute sour cream for the mayo, just to see how it tastes.

Awesome dip recipe, and so much cheaper than store bought.
  I had to buy blocks of extra sharp cheese and grate it myself.  I couldn't find the little jars of pimento so i followed another reviewer's suggestion and bought a jar of roasted peppers and chopped those myself.  
The dip is now 4 hours old and the flavors are better. 
I can't wait to make a grilled cheese with it.

made exactly like recipe except added 4 cups shredded extra-sharp cheese and worstershire like another reviewer. It was excellent!  Jalepeno give it a great unexpected kick.  I'm going to make again this week.

It turned out perfect and it was the easy thing that I ever made in my life and I am taking this to the Community Thanksgiving Service dinner or finger foods and I am trilled. The smell of the spread brings water to my mouth and I want to dig in it.

Made as directed without the jalapeño will be using to stuff into belly bell peppers. It tastes great!! I’m a New Englander that moved to the south about 10 years ago this is the first time I’ve actually made this. I’ve had it at a few places and there’s only one restaurant I’ve liked it so I decided to make it myself and this recipe is very close to my favorite restaurant’s, it’s actually a bit better thanks for sharing.

I have made this a number of times.   This last batch, I omitted the mayo all together but I added (from Trader's Joes) a "dollop of Creme Fraiche". I know that sounds so fancy, but it's was just the right texture to make the batch "smooth" without adding that strong mayo flavor.     I also also add hatch chilis along with the pimentos.   And when I am lucky enough to have my sis's famous "cowboy candy" (sweet and spicy jalapeños, I top it off with those as well.

I made the recipe more or less as written. I used Neufchâtel cheese rather than full-fat cream cheese.  I eschew onion and garlic powders, preferring fresh ingredients. I substituted a finely diced shallot for the onion powder and simply left out the garlic powder. I did include the quarter teaspoon cayenne, and it was hardly noticeable. I omitted the optional jalapeño. I also left out the black pepper, because I didn't want black specks in my cheese.

The cheese is great served with Trader Joe's round multigrain crackers. I plan to give the cheese to neighbors, friends, and postal workers for Christmas. I'll put the cheese in a crock and put a ribbon around the crock, including the recipe, and put a matching ribbon around a box of crackers.

A single batch makes about 2 cups. I figure that I'll make quadruple batches in my KitchenAid mixer and be able to fill six crocks each time.

It was very heavy.  I will try to lighten it up next time.  I felt like I needed to bake it .  Might be good as a Mac & Cheese dish.

Awesome recipe. I followed the cook’s suggestion to add Worcestershire sauce and powdered mustard, but because I grated too much cheese, perhaps a cup more, I added 1/3 cup of full fat Greek yogurt to make it creamy. Also used heaping for measurements with ingredients. So good! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Great version of a Southern Classic. I doubled the cheese and the spices my second time. Took a great thing to another level. Extra cheese makes even cardboard and a flip flop taste better.  Thanks!!

I love pimento cheese and made this recipe two ways:  following recipe exactly and the result while tasty was just too much mayo for me.
Revised recipe to 1/4 cup mayo and an additional cup of shredded cheddar.
We preferred the less mayo, more cheese version.
I will say that the addition of cream cheese is brilliant allowing the ingredients to bind together more effectively.  And the addition of jalapeño deliciously adds some crunch. And the use of the mixer with a paddle really effectively combines the ingredients.  We’ll done!

I can honestly say that this is the best Pimento cheese I can remember ever having.  Just the right touch of cayenne pepper that has a creep up effect and isn't over powering.  I've made it twice and will definitely be doing it again soon.

Way, way too much cream cheese.  Garlic and onion powder flavor are distracting.  Minced garlic and onion would be better.  The cayenne adds a nice kick.

I added the "whatsthishere" sauce and dried mustard and made a large batch for a function, nervously, but all was well and it was received with rave review! That's a great thing since a local shop sells a version that's supposed to be the end all of pimento cheese!  THANKS for a great recipe.

This is a terrific recipe for Pimento cheese! I use some worcestershire sauce and/or occasionally olive juice.

I made an assumption. I assumed that the shredded cheese amount at 2 cups was meant to equal 16 ounces rather than a 2 cup measure or 8 ounces.

I live in an area of the country where I can rarely find pimento cheese. Born and raised in the southern US, pimento cheese was always my favorite snack. I’ve tried other homemade recipes, but they were disappointing. Your recipe takes me back home in my mind and taste buds. I’m so glad I found your recipe. It’s perfectly yummy ??

This is the best recipe! I have made it many times and already planning to take it to holiday get togethers. And, in all honesty, I have created holidays. It’s so good for weekend (and weeknight) plans. 

I followed the recipe and a few suggestions from earlier reviews: I mixed soft ingredients first, I also added 1/8 teaspoon dried mustard and a dash of Worcestershire, I also use 1/3 less fat cream cheese because it is softer. 

Love this recipe!

This is soooo delicious! I made it the night ahead and stuck it in the fridge, knowing that it would be even better the next day. I can’t  give this recipe enough stars!! It deserves every great review it got! I did make it as originally posted, plus the Worcestershire sauce and mustard powder. I did add a bit of the optional jalapeño pepper, but also added 1 Tbsp of sweet Chile sauce. Excellent!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! Will definitely make on a regular basis!

I have to admit that I did not make as given. The cheeses, mayo, spices, chilis, were all the same. I added extra cayenne and leftover hot dogs, chopped fine. But alas, no pimento (didn't have any). I don't measure unless I'm baking so it was approximate. We loved it! Best 'pimento cheese' I've ever had! I'm glad people review when experimenting. I've had too many flavorless dishes (not only from Allrecipes, of course) that I'd rather know what others have found to be flavorful and unique, if needed.

I made this with no jalapeño so it would be kid friendly and it was fantastic. My husband requests it all the time. It will be a staple recipe in my home.

This is the best pimiento cheese I have ever had! You will never buy one again, because nothing you can buy will match up to this. I did add Worcestershire, dry mustard, and napom horseradish instead of jalapeno. I made it in a bowl by hand, not mix in a mixer, mostly because I like mine chunky versus smooth. I read some posters saying ot makes great grilled pimiento cheese sandwiches, but that's a no for me, since it a mess with it squishing out the sides when taking bites. I'm eating it with crackers or celery.  There is no need to look for another recipe.

I  used extra sharp Cheddar cheese that I grated myself and found the recipe to be a little too heavy and If I use it as a spread or dip it needs to be at room temperature other wise it won't spread easily. Otherwise it is good.

When I find recipes like this I always want to try them.  However I can't handle black pepper, so I sub  dried basil.  In place of the powder garlic and onion, I use the real stuff, minced as fine as I can get it, and forget the red pepper.  It is still a very good dip.  It seems to get better after setting for a couple of hours too.

When I was a kid, the drugstore in town had a soda fountain where my sisters and I got pimento cheese sandwiches as a special afternoon treat. The taste of this recipe is so similar to that one; it brought back great memories. One thing, though: I made it in the evening and had a sandwich then, and wasn't overwhelmed by the taste. But when I got it out for lunch the next day, wow! The flavors had really melded. DH really likes it, too. I can't wait to serve to my pimento-cheese-loving brother-in-law.

This is so good! I grew up on this when we  moved to Utah all I can find is so spicy I can’t eat it. I don’t have my mom’s recipe as she didn’t use one for most things she made. I left out the jalapeño and found the taste of home. My favorite, Tennessee way of eating it is to spread it on celery sticks. Crunchy, tasty, and satisfying. I’m so glad to have this recipe!

1st time making pimiento cheese, but I have tasted many versions.  This was the best by far!  I didn’t have a jalapeño, so added a little extra cayenne.  The spiciness was what made this taste so good; the ingredient that all of the others I have tasted lacked.  My guests loved it too!  Served with veggies and crackers.  A must have on Derby day.

I made this so many times now  with super sharp 2-year white cheddar, Duke’s mayo (the BEST if you can get it where you live),  and used half a small white onion grated and a couple crushed garlic cloves instead of the garlic and onion powder. It is so amazing. Such a hit with everyone that tries it. I usually double or triple the recipe.

Based on what my old boss told me when he used to bring homemade pimento cheese to work; I used half Cheddar and half Swiss.

Other than that, I followed exactly except for the optional stuff.  I'm sure it's great, I just wanted to try it the less spicy way before I kick it up a notch next time.

BTW, Duke's or nothing, and full fat everything!

This is absolutely delicious pimento cheese! My husband is a huge fan of pimento cheese, even going to far as to make double-decker sandwiches. I myself don’t take it that far, but he’s a true southerner, and I’m not. Anyway, he was super excited when I was mixing this up for the first time. I didn’t add the jalapeños as I’m a spice lightweight. I did add the cayenne pepper, though. My husband did the official taste test and exclaimed, ‘Lady, you NAILED IT!’ I followed the advice of the OP in the comments and added a Tbsp Worcestershire and 1/2 tsp of dry mustard to my doubled recipe. Those two additions definitely took it to the next level. This will be my go-to recipe from now on! Who knew it could be so easy (and cheap) to make?! Thanks so much for the delicious recipe!

This is a perfectly balanced classic pimento cheese. If you want to adjust this recipe than please don’t try Julia Child’s recipes. This is exactly what the spread should be- it gives you the spicy option and has the foundation ingredients in exact proportion to produce what this speed is famous for. Thank you for this recipe- nothing beats a classic.

Very good, thanks from a gal in TN.   Hubby loves Miracle Whip so used that, also rather than the jalepeno peppers, I put in a very generous half tablespoon of sweet chili paste (Sambal Olek brand). Made a double batch (using only one 8 oz of cream cheese) and it will be gone in a few days...

This stuff is great and lends itself well to adjustment. I made mine without the jalapeños this time, but I’m looking forward to trying it. When i made my first batch 2 cups of cheese looked a little Creamy for my taste so i added half a cup more sharp cheddar. A  couple tablespoons of Texas Pete hot sauce is nice too. (I didn’t have Jalapeños so i added the hot sauce)

This is a great base. Made exactly to the recipe and for us it had way too much cream cheese but other proportions were great. So second time added at least twice the extra sharp cheddar -I did not measure- just threw a chunk in my processor. After additional cheese we loved it. We like to taste more of the cheddar instead of the cream cheese. We also love the addition of about 1/4 t dry mustard and 1/2-1 T Worcestershire sauce. Thank you for a great starting recipe easily modified for our tastes

I diced a tablespoon or two of pickled jalapeno slices to add to this recipe in place of the recommended fresh jalapeno pepper, only because I had a jar of the pickled on hand.
Quite excellent in a sandwich or on crackers in front of the TV.

Made this for Super Bowl and we really liked it.  I left out the jalapeno and used just a generous pinch of cayenne instead of 1/4 tsp. because that is way too much heat for me!!!  Has a great flavor and I think I'd like to try a grilled cheese sandwich with it too.

This turned out GREAT and was super simple. I omitted the Jalapenos (didn't realize I was out and didn't have time to go back to the store).  Will be serving at today's Super Bowl party down the street. 

Thanks for the recipe!

Made as written except for adding dry mustard and Worcestershire Sauce as suggested by several reviewers. Next time, I would cut back to 4-6 ounces cream cheese in trying to create a creamier dip. Otherwise, the flavor is very good. Will make again. Thank you QUEENREYNEY.

This had just a touch too much cream cheese for us. The addition of the jalapeño and other spices were really good, but somewhat overpowered by the amount of cream cheese. A solid recipe.

So, I did change just little, but not enough to kill the original recipe. I used chopped onion cause that's what I had, and I put about a TBS of Frank's in. That being said, OMG!!! This was better than the stuff from the store! My husband was licking the bowl with his fingers lol. This is going to be my go to recipe for pimento cheese from here on out. OMG soooo good!

I followed the recipe as much as I could.  I only had 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar cheese, so I used what cheeses I had  left over from the holidays. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. Next time I make this I will use less mayo.

This is the best pimento cheese. Make it and never by store bought again. The only notes I have is to buy sharp cheddar cheese by the block and shred it yourself, the cheese has a better texture this way. I also use my stand mixer to mix the cream cheese, mayo, and spices. I have made this several times and always get rave reviews. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Thought  i would give it a try. I dont like store bought. This is by far the best I have ever tasted.  We made grilled cheese  sandwiches  with what was left the next day and it actually  was better the next day.  Never  do store bought  again.

This was definitely not my Mother's recipe who made it with Cheddar, Swiss, Longhorn,  mayo, pimiento and worcestershire sauce. But, I LOVED this! I loved the addition of the cream cheese! I did make some changes though. Instead of the jalapeno, I thinly sliced green olives and green onions and omitting the cayenne pepper and onion  powder. I did have to add more mayo.
I am making this again, its a keeper!

This came out FANTASTIC!!!!  BF approved!!  He says it's the best he's ever had. We can not stop eating it! Going to have to make more!! I could not find the diced pimentos near me but I found a jar of large pieces, drained them and ran them through the food processor - worked great! I used 1/4 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp pepper - it was perfect for us. I recommend refrigerating for 24 hrs (if you can hold out) so the flavors can meld. Served with the thin wheat crackers.....YUM!!!!

I followed the recipe exactly.  After mixing, I tasted and thought there was way too much mayonnaise, as that was the main flavor, and vowed to use less when I made it again.  However, when chilled overnight, it tasted quite different and mayo was no longer the main taste.  In fact, I might not have even guessed there was mayo in it.  Served it at a Christmas party, along with a variety of Milton's crackers, and the guests wolfed it down.  Had to promise recipes to several.

We don't care for the cayenne pepper, so we changed it to 1/4 tsp. of Old Bay!

I have been missing my favorite brand of pimento cheese (Palmetto Cheese) here in California.  In fact, there's none here but a jar of Kraft, ugh.  This recipe is fantastic, but I think maybe I'll add more mayo and less cream cheese so it doesn't  stiffen so much in the fridge.  DEElicious though!!!!!

Made with blue cheese dressing instead of mayo and some sriracha instead of cayenne. Very tasty as a toast topper, going to try it as the cheese component of a Philly cheese steak sub.

Took it to a church brunch and didn’t bring one spoonful home!  I did find it to be a bit thick and I wanted a little tang so added approximately 3TBS of Miracle Whip.  Since it was for a Sunday School function I did not add the jalapeño and I used just  pinch of cayenne.

Perfect!  Just as the recipe shows.  Love the jalapeno which you normally don't find in the off-the-shelf variety.  My go-to gathering favorite.  Thanks for sharing! :)

Wonderful. The only thing I do differently is add a little more sharp cheddar at the end lightly mixed,for more texture.

Great flavor, visual appeal and so many uses for it! But, when you don't have a jalapeno and use 2 tsps. of Chipotle peppers
in Adobo sauce that had been patiently awaiting the next great recipe.....well some things are just meant to be!

I can see why this recipe has such a high rating. I didn't read the reviews before starting off because it already had a good rating and I wanted to try it as written before tweaking things. I couldn't find my box grater, so I had to use a small handheld one, which shreds the cheese very finely. When I make this again, I'll defintely use the box grater, just because I like the cheese a little more chunky.

The flavor was fantastic! I started with about half the cayenne since I have some folks who need it mild. A quick taste test told me more would be fine, so I bumped it up and it was perfect.  I had to mix mine by hand, so I beat the other ingredients together a little first and then dumped in the cheddar. 

I know pimento cheese always tastes better when the indgredients have a chance to  mingle, but I couldn't resist scraping the bowl and making a grilled pimento cheese sandwich. It was delicious! Next time I will probably add a bit of worcestershire and dry mustard like my grandmother always used to do, but this recipe is great as it stands. I'm glad I came across it.

For some reason I was wanting to have some Pimiento and Cheese Spread.  Haven't had it in years, used to get it at the grocery store.  I decided I wanted to make my own as their's is only "kind of " good.  I did a lot of looking around before I read the reviews on this one and decided, this was THE ONE.  DEEEElicious!!!!  I'm a real sissy with spicy hot foods, so I did not have a jalapeno, but did add the red pepper.  This is SO delicious and I know the gal I'm sending over some to will love it, as well!  Thank you SO much for sharing a good recipe!!!

This is a delicious base to start from but I found the cream cheese to overpower the cheddar cheese too much.  Cut the cream cheese in half and it is great.  5 stars with half the amount of cream cheese.  Of course this is subjective so just adjust according to your own taste.  Some smoked paprika sprinkled in makes it even better.  Otherwise I kept all proportions the same.

Absolutely loooove this recipe! I didn't change the recipe, except I skipped the jalapenos this time (for the sake of my semi-spicy sensitive partner) other than that it is hands down the best pimento cheese I have tasted or made!! Thank you for the recipe!!

Thanks for a great recipe! I've made this several times using the recipe as written. I did add the Worcestershire sauce and ground mustard like suggested. We have an Amish store close that sells deli cheese ends and pieces that are all mixed up. It may have cheddar, pepper jack, etc in the container....never know what you'll get but it is good and cheap. I used that cheese once and it gave it a complete different taste. There were probably 5 different types of cheese in it.

Fabulous flavor. It's in the fridge so the flavors can blend. Mixed it by hand because it was easy and saved a bit on washing up. Can't wait to try it on baked potatoes...

Another wonderful dip/spread to have on hand and one with a kick and plenty of cheese in it. Put less jalapeños in if you if you want less of a kick in it.

Really good pimento cheese!  I did add 1/2 tsp cayenne, instead of 1/4 tsp and 1/2 tsp ground black pepper, which is for my love of pepper taste!  Also I put in 4 cups of shredded cheese instead of 2 cups.

This is the first time I've ever made pimiento and cheese and it was easy and delicious! I was asked to bring p&c sandwiches to a reception, and I doubled the recipe, because I didn't know how many sandwiches it would make.  I didn't need to double it. A doubled recipe was enough to make sandwiches of two  Sunbeam Giant sandwich loaves, with LOTS left over for sandwiches for me for lunch.

This was fantastic! I didn’t add the jalapeño and it had a bit of a kick from the cayenne. But I like it! Can’t wait to make this for my sister, it’s her fave!

I did like this recipe but I added some Siracha for a kick  and smokey flavor and some green onions, not much tho.  I have read a lot of Pimento Cheese recipes and the real  Southern ones  and even the one from Whole foods just add the whole small jar of chopped pimentos  liquid and all and also chopped them some more,  which I did for the flavor, mayo and the cheese. That's it.  I did add 1/2 block of cream cheese  also and liked it   I did not add any salt as it was salty enough for me...No garlic either. . I can see where you could leave it out if you want.  This is an "as you like it recipe" and to your own taste..IMO.

I made this recipe the first time, using sharp cheddar cheese (without reading the reviews). It wasn't BAD, by any means---just didn't taste quite like the pimento cheese I'm used to. 

Tonight, though, I used extra-sharp cheddar cheese and whooooo that was the secret right there! The result was so full of flavor that I ended up using NO salt--none. I halved the garlic powder & onion powder on a hunch---1/8 tsp instead of 1/4 tsp---glad I did, b/c it would've been overwhelming at full dosage.

Only substitutions I made were Neufchatel cheese instead of regular, and lite mayo instead of regular. It's in the fridge chilling now....I CAN. NOT. WAIT. to dig in tomorrow!!! This recipe is a keeper!

I'm southern and I just made this, only substituting  red pepper flakes because I didn't have cayenne pepper and it was one of, if not  the best I've ever eaten.  The garlic powder and pepper really jazzed it up. Thanks

Thanks for the recipe.  Loved the addition of the spices, especially the jalapeño.  
Too much cream cheese by half for me.  I added lots of cheddar to overcome it.  I'll use half cream cheese next time.
I didn't beat it, but mixed it by hand to keep the lumpiness.
I topped fried green tomatoes with this.  It was so tasty that way.
Again, thank you.

Just like Nanny used to make for family every holiday. I loved it then and still love it now,  the only change I made was leaving out the jalapeño. I serve it with fresh veggies and wheat  thins. Good recipe if you aren’t being careful of your fat or cheese consumption.

I followed the recipe as written. It's really good but I felt that the cream cheese overpowered the Cheddar, even using extra sharp. This reminded me more of a cheese ball than a sandwich spread. That said we still enjoyed it at our picnic. I bought a 12" French loaf and sliced the top off about a 1/2" in,  hollowed out the top and bottom,  stuffed it with this full recipe, topped it with a spinach and kale mix (I love using that because if it wilts it's still delicious and no one's the wiser) then put the top back on and wrapped it with plastic wrap. I even made it the day before and it was still fresh at the picnic. This recipe is very dense (hence the cheese ball) so we sliced it thinly whenever we wanted to eat some. Everyone loved it but didn't recognize it as pimento cheese. Next time I'm going to add some Chipotle chile powder and liquid smoke, for a more smoky flavor.

I love this recipe.  When my 32 year old son was in the hospital 31 years ago with croup, I ate most of his supper because he didn't feel like eating that much.  Anyway, Morrison Cafeteria provided the hospital meals.  On his plate was the most magnificent pimento cheese I have ever eaten .  Morrison Cafeteria made that sandwich from scratch but was never available for their regular menu.  I have looked for anything like this for years.  This recipe is the closest I have found. I may tweak it a bit in the future, but it is perfect as is.

Great recipe! I omitted the jalapeno because I didn't have it. Added more cheddar until the mixture was more cheesy than creamy mayo consistency. Also grated my cheese on the smaller holes of the grater. Also added more cayenne pepper and a dash of Worcestershire. It so good. I will definitely make it again.

This is exactly like my Nana's pimento cheese!    Like many other reviewers, I simply added a bit of Worcestershire and a bit of dry mustard.  Incredible spread: tasty and so easy to make!

This was very easy to make and delicious!! I shredded the cheddar cheese per another review. Also used roasted red pepper from a jar. Diced up about one and a half peppers in lieu of the pimentos. Gave great flavor! Will make it again for sure!!

I really liked it and it was easy and quick to make.  I thought at first that I tasted too much mayo, but after it sat a little, it tasted much better.  I added a little Worcester sauce, more onion powder, and left out the jalepeno but kept in the cayenne pepper.  It was really tasty!

This was an excellent version of Pimento Cheese Spread.  It was a nice addition to my New Year's Eve 2018 celebration... delicious!  Question:  Has anyone ever seen a recipe for Pimento Cheese Spread using cottage cheese, rather than cream cheese?  An elderly Aunt used to make it that way and it, too, was delicious.

Fantastic with the cream cheese as a dip or spread for crackers, but if you want to make a sandwich use a recipe that does not have cream cheese.

It is delicious and easy. Just made some up for sandwiches/work lunches this week. Ky KitchenAid makes light work of it, all I have to do is measure, pour and scrape into a storage container.

This Pimento Cheese is really delicious! I've used a similar recipe for years, but include swiss cheese along with the sharp cheddar (about 1/3 to 1/2 swiss to 1/2 to 2/3 cheddar).  Also, I don't care for pimentos so leave them out...but still call it Pimento Cheese, LOL.

Very nice!  . I didn't have extra sharp cheddar and used sharp.  Sorry, I cut the cream cheese by half since not using extra sharp cheddar. I was afraid the 8 ounces of cream cheese would overwhelm  the cheddar flavor.   Will  make again  using extra sharp cheddar and 8 ounces cream cheese per written.

Ok made exactly per recipe.  As suspected. too much cream cheese for me.  And extra sharp cheddar bit strong.  Both cheeses overwhelmed sweet pimento flavor.  I like it better simply cut  the cream cheese by 1/2 and just sharp cheddar. Sweeter. 

 THANKS

Great pimento cheese!  I'm trying to duplicate a recipe my mother inlaw made.  Did a few things different. Omitted the cayenne and the jalapeno's and I mixed it by hand instead of using the stand mixer.  I wanted to see the pieces of cheddar instead of having a complete blend.  Tasted it as this point and really liked it. 

After it was well mixed I added toasted, chopped pecans.  Didn't measure them...but somewhere between a 1/3 and a 1/4 of a cup.  Next time I'll add a bit more cheddar...but it's really good as is.

This has become my go to recipe for Pimiento Cheese!  I love it!  I do add a bit more red pepper, but otherwise I make it as directed.  Usually I have to double or triple the recipe, due to people wanting bowls to take home!

Brought this to our holiday party and it received so my compliments! I made some slight tweaks to the recipe—added more cayenne, didn’t include the garlic powder and jalapeño. I also added a dash of sugar to round out the flavor. :)

Made the recipe as stated but opted to process mine into a smoother spread. Great recipe but perhaps a little horseradish or smokey paprika next time.

Was really craving some good pimento cheese spread.   Found this one and sent the hubs to the store and he couldn’t find pimentos.  I had to wait an extra day so I could go to the store.   Well worth the wait.   LOVED this!   Way better than any store bought.  You HAVE to use extra sharp cheese as that is where all the flavor comes from.   My fav is Tillamook.  Love the kick of the cayenne too!  Thanks for sharing, I will be making this again.

I have now made this 4 Times. It has become a staple in my fridge!  I only added a splash of hot sauce, Sriracha and Worcestershire sauces, and a minced Serrano pepper along with the jalapeño ( for a touch more spice)!  It’s just YUMMY!  THANK YOU!

The five stars would be for the recipe as it is written.
My wife and I LOVE this recipe!  We took some to a neighborhood party on a tray as a dip recently. Everyone loved it!  
I did follow advice from an earlier comment from Boxermom (I think) by using "a hand mixer to mix the cream cheese, Mayo & spices" and folding "in the grated cheese, jalapeno, & pimentos so it would maintain a chunky texture." And, I followed another recommendation to add the dry mustard and Worcestershire sauce.
Update 2018-03: I've shared this magical stuff with several friends and they like it so well that I find myself making this rather often for my family and for others!  A winner!

This beats store bought hands down. I like a lot of heat so I will add more pepper next time, but if you prefer mild it's perfect.

I followed the recipe, added the ground mustard and Worcestershire as someone recommended. I also added more cayenne and jalapeños. It was great! I took it to work and had a table full of friends wanting more! And that weekend, we had an abundance of jalapeños so I made poppers and stuffed the jalapeños with the pimento cheese and wrapped in partially cooked bacon. Baked at 350 for 10-15 minutes. Best poppers we ever made! Thanks for this delicious recipe!

I moved from the south to Canada and made a double batch of  this for a social gathering, as I was sure no one had had it before. I threw it away and didn't go to the social gathering I was so upset by how flavorless it was. Will never use this recipe again.

Very good as it is. My only substitution was green onions for the red, using the whites and greens. I'll dabble with the next batch, like adding crab.

Almost True Southern Style Pimento Cheese - the trick to making it true southern is to use Dukes Mayonaise which uses Apple cider vinegar for a tangier taste.

I've made this recipe a ton of times because it is so. Darned. Good! I have to confess, the first time I made it, I didn't have onion powder, so I substituted 2 TBS of shredded vidalia onion and it was even better than the original recipe. Now I also add a little worchestershire and mustard powder for a deeper flavor.

This is definitely the best pimento cheese recipe! Made it as written, added the suggested Dijon mustard (about 1 tsp) and a tsp of Worcestershire sauce. Great addition! Used reduced fat cream cheese and the flavor and texture were still great. I had jarred fire roasted yellow peppers on hand instead of pimentos and it tasted wonderful!! I didn't have jalapeño so added about 1 tsp of sriracha and it was a nice kick without being overpowering. I used the "Whole Egg Mayonnaise" recipe to make homemade mayo and it was terrific. Will be using this again!

I made this with hatch chile and white cheddar and it is delicious! Once hatch season is over, I'll use what's called for because it just has to be good. I beat the cream cheese. mayo and seasonings before adding the cheese so I could get an idea what the base "sauce" tasted like. Yep, it's a keeper!

Yummy! I did not have extra sharp cheddar, had to use sharp. Other than that I fixed this recipe as written. Absolutely delicious! I am not a Duke's mayo fan but it is the right mayo for this recipe. Hellman's would have been too sweet. Jalapeno is a must have in this recipe. 
I have always enjoyed pimento cheese. The family not so much. This recipe changed a few minds in my house.

I lived in the Midwest all my life.  I recently moved to the South and both my husband and I immediately fell in love with pimento cheese.   PC is a fixed condiment here!  This recipe is the only aside from the ma and pa grocer that I've found worthy thus far!  I am against trying a recipe, changing it and rating it, but I did fold in all the heavier ingredients instead of creaming them all together.  Only reason is that we use it more for an appetizer rather than a spread in case you're wondering why.  Double it if you're headed to a party or function.  Trust me, you'll want a mess of it for yourself!  Served it with crusty bread, pickled onions and a pinch of salt.  Oh my goodness!

I used the food processor, but reserved some of the shredded cheddar to stir in the more creamy mixture & added a fresh diced jalapeño. It was delicious! I will make it again!

Being a pimento cheese junkie, I have tried a lot of versions over the years searching for the perfect one.  After making this a few times now and tweaking to suit my own desire for lots of flavor, my search is over.  To the original recipe I ended up doubling the called for amounts of cayenne, garlic powder, and onion powder, and added a dash of Worcestershire sauce and 1/2 tsp. dry mustard.  However, I kick up the spice in everything I cook, so that shouldn't take away from the rating I give the original recipe which is far and away better than anything I've ever made or bought in the past.  The cream cheese gives this the perfect consistency and I love the little kick the jalapeno adds to the bite.

This is quite good pimento cheese. I didn’t add the optional jalapeño and it was really good.

absolutely loved this. I've only had store bought since I grew up in the northwestern US and this is not a common item. this is SO much better than store bought and cheaper. I did as a comment suggested and added a bit of Worcestershire and dry mustard. It was excellent before but I liked the added flavor.

Oh my gosh, I am 63 years old and this totally brought back memories of my grandmother who grew up in Kentucky. Would not change a thing! My grandchildren loved it! Thanks so much! We made a pimento cheese sandwich with fresh tomato and bacon - nothing better!

Was a big hit at the Independence day gathering with our friends.  Some unhappy friends when they went back to get seconds.  I am going to make again this week for a different pitch-in.  But I am going to make a double batch this time.

This recipe made incredibly wet pimento cheese and I prefer mine dry. I ended up doubling the shredded cheese in the recipe. I also added a little juice from jarred jalapeños, more cayenne pepper, and added a Serrano pepper in addition to the jalapeno. The flavor is great and I love the cream cheese in it. As written the recipe was just too wet for me.

I like this recipe.  It has a nice (adjustable) kick with the cayenne pepper and jalapeño.  We like spicy foods, and plain pimento cheese just makes me think of elementary school.  This elevates it and makes a great dip for celery, carrots or crackers.

I've probably made this recipe 6 or 8 times, but just realized I never rated it, probably because I made some modifications.  I've gotta say--its fabulous!  I used to make a pimiento cheese spread about 25 years ago but the recipe was all in my head.  I'd never written it down.  When I went to make it recently, I wasn't sure if I was leaving anything out so I cruised Allrecipes and checked out several recipes to come up with my own.  This recipe is basically it, but I make it with a few modifications.  I reduce the garlic and onion powder to 1/8 tsp. and the mayo to 1/4 c.  You can add a little more if you need to loosen up the mixture.  I also add 8 oz. of Velvetta cheese, 1/4 tsp. each of paprika and dry mustard, and 1 tsp. of vinegar; and leave out the salt and pepper.  This makes a little more than 2 cups of pimiento cheese spread.  Love it!  Thank you Queenreney for the wonderful recipe.  It's delicious!

Thanks for submitted dip.  This is wonderful!!!  I do not care for jalapenos so I omitted them, but for a jalapeno lover, please add them.  I bumped up the Onion and Garlic powder a bit and added about 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire Sauce.  It turned out great!!!  Will definitely have this as one of my main appetizers from now on.

I'm not a fan of putting cream cheese in pimento cheese UNLESS you are using it melted.   This works great if you are going to put pimento cheese on a burger or use it in a grilled cheese sandwich.  The cream cheese tastes good, but it makes it too stiff if it is going to be used on a sandwich, cracker, celery stick, or stuffed jalapeno.  But this of course is still so much better than that store bought stuff.

After a trip to Charleston And eating this everywhere... I wanted to make it and found this recipe.  I made it exactly as written the first time and everyone loved it.  The second time I added a spoonful of capers and fish roe just for fun and they loved that too.  It is now my go to dip.  Most frequent comment is "I think this is possibly the best dip ever."  I always refer people back to here and the original recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

We loved it as is, but made a couple minor changes second time.  Used only 4oz cream cheese, more grated sharp cheddar, and 2 jalapeños!  We like it spicy.

I've been looking for a pimento cheese I really like ever since my Granny's recipe went with her. Almost 50 yrs and I finally found it! I made this by the recipe-no jalapeños, but a little extra cayenne. Also used homemade mayo so it had a little extra zip. I think next time I'll pack the 2 C of cheese a little tighter (maybe 10 oz. instead of the 8 I used, but other than that-pure perfection!  Thanks Queen Reyney!

I made this last weekend for a baby shower and it was a hit!  I have already made a second batch for my sister.  It's one of her favorite spreads.  It looked like a lot of pimento's so I did add 1 Tbsp Mayo and an extra cup of cheddar cheese.  And I left out the jalapeno pepper altogether.  It was absolutely delicious.  This one is definitely a keeper.

This is now a staple in our house for snacking.  Great exactly as written. Even better with red or green onion instead of onion powder.   I  have made this at least 6 times since finding this recipe.

This recipe is similar enough to my own that I now use instead.  As others have mentioned, you can kick up the heat in various ways.  I used crushed red pepper instead of cayenne, just my preference, and added a touch of horseradish.
Thanks for sharing!
By the way, I used my food, and was a bit concerned it would turn out too smooth, but it was fine.

This was wonderful! Don't think I'll ever be able to eat the store bought stuff again. I roasted my jalapeño before chopping and adding. Was worried it might be too spicy but the roasting mellowed it. Just make sure to scrape the seeds out first. 
Awsome on pita bread!!!

Delicious. I made it exactly like the recipe says. I did add the optional jalapeno, but not the optional cayenne.  I would definitely recommend a try.

Do not know how many times I have made this delicious pimento cheese, but always get raves.  Have been volunteered to bring for many church events.  No one has ever noticed the jalapeño.  Mince it very fine so there will not be a large piece of green in the spread.  I use Tillamook extra sharp cheddar and Duke's mayo.  Made the recipe exactly as written.

Made as written.  Very good but too cream cheesy for my taste. I will cut it in half next time and cut the mayo down to 1/3 cup. I guess I like my cheese a little bit drier.

I grew up in the Pacific NORTHWEST and had never heard of pimento cheese until I moved here to Ohio. After hearing all the hype, decided I needed to see (taste) what all the hoopla was about. I have never eaten pimento cheese before I made this recipe so have no frame of reference as to what it was to actually taste like. That being said, this is fantastic! I didn't include the jalapeños as I don't like them. I will definitely be making this again and again!

I shredded my own cheddar and added the remaining ingredients after blending together so the cheese was still chunky. I also used homemade roasted mixed peppers rather than pimento and it was outstanding. Since the pepper mix had an assortment I had grown including hot it was a bit more spicy but delicious since we like spicy.

It's much better heated. You actually get the flavor from the pimento & it's much better with the cheese melted. Otherwise I loved it!

As a Southern girl who has had homemade pimento and cheese all my life and know the "real deal" , I must say this recipe is amazing!! I love spicy foods; I am from Texas, so the addition of the jalapenos just put the icing on the cake. Oh my gosh, it is too good.  Wish it wasn't so bad for you. :(
Oh well, I am still going to enjoy it in moderation!! Thank you for the awesome recipe.

I've made this many times and everyone raves about it. I usually add in more cheddar cheese and lately have grated some sweet onion along with the onion powder. A great addition is some pickled jalapenos, but it is great with just the pimentos. Of course the mayo must be Duke's.

The only change is increased the garlic powder by 1/2 tsp.  This is an amazing recipe, haven't Nader grilled cheese yet, but I use it for cheese on my pulled pork sliders. I make this cheese on a regular basis.

This is the total bomb. The key is to leave it covered in the fridge for 24 hours before eating; the change in flavor after sitting for a day is very pronounced.

With the Worcestershire sauce and ground mustard, this was phenomenal. Used roasted peppers (instead of jarred pimientos) and minced green onion instead of onion powder (what I had on hand). Definitely a keeper!

This was amazing!  Made and  served both as a dip and then baked in oven on crostini. Wanted to try on a grilled cheese but my husband and son ate it all before I could! This will be a staple in our house!

Absolutely HORRIBLE! My husband loves pimento cheese so I wanted to surprise him and made a double batch of this due to the great reviews. I don't know who reviewed this recipe so highly, but it was awful!

I like this, I might make it again without the mayo though. I think it would be good without it.I do like the jalapeno in it, it adds a little zing. I made sure to get all of the seeds out and to get rid of all the membrane so I got the flavor without too much heat.

Thank you so much for your wonderful Pimento Cheese. I had never made PC before and it was delicious. My family and most friends are vegetarian or vegan, therefore we had not had PC in many years. Because of our diet, I changed the mayo to vegennaise, used Daiya shredded cheese, substituted Tofutti vegan cream cheese and vegetarian black pepper and everyone thought it was excellent, the bowl was clean quick.

I have made this recipe exactly as written for numerous parties and it is always a big hit.  In fact for one party I was outside and the hostess came out and told me that they were licking the bowl!  I almost always buy a block of good extra sharp cheddar  and shred it in the food processor but in a pinch I have also used the shredded cheese and it is still good.  I was worried the first time I made it that it might be too hot (I don't like things so hot that you can't eat it) but I seed and rib the jalapeno and it is not overly spicy.  Even the kids like it.  This is a recipe I now have in my memory.

This one is too much work for results that fall SO far short taste-wise of my Nana's. Won't try this one again. It will do for those who are not aficionados of pimento cheese.

Can't buy this in Maine...well I can't find it anyway, after almost 30 years.  It was close to my memories and will make it again.Left out the onion seasoning since my boyfriend doesn't like onion or onion flavor.

I found that mixing the mayo with the seasonings first, and then dumping in the cream cheese and then shredded cheese took away any possible grittiness and the flavor seemed more blended. I tried with dashes of Worcestershire and mustard and without, and my husband like it better with. I personally couldn't tell much difference. Everyone loves this recipe!

I left out the spicy stuff, since we don't like it.  Added a little worcestershire sauce and dry mustard at Yakety's suggestion.  I took it to a birthday party, and people really liked it.  I tried to blend it with a hand mixer first, which didn't really work.  So I dumped it in a food processor with the cutting blade, since I have no paddle attachment, and that did it.  

It is good, but I'm looking for the pimento cheese I'm used to from eastern NC, and it was a bit blander than that, even though I used extra sharp cheddar.  I would make it again, but would probably cut the cream cheese in half  or eliminate it completely and up the mayonnaise a little.  It could have used a little more pimento too.  I would put in another four ounces if I made this exact recipe again, as I could only taste it a little.  Still a solid cheese dip.

QUEENREYNEY, Your recipe for this Southern staple. Pinento Cheese is absolutely fantastic! Thanks for the share!
I just finished making it and it will definitely be my go to, and will be sure to keep a jar of it in the refrigerator. Out of necessity, I had to make a couple edits, please allow me to share.
One - 8 oz. bar of Cracker Barrel Extra Sharp Chedder (grated)
1 package Cream Cheese
1/2 cup Best Foods Mayonnaise (known as Hellman's east of the Mississippi, and not exactly Southern; I know Miracle Whip is preferred by proper Southetners, buts it's what I had on hand, however, I'll try it with MW another time)
One - 4oz. jar Sliced Pimentos (strained)
6 slices (1-1/2 tablespoon) of deli style Jalapeño Peppers (minced) (the type used as a nacho topping)
1-1/2 tablespoon freshly Grated White Onion (with the juice) (was out of onion powder)
1/4 teaspoon Cayenne Pepper 
1/4 teaspoon Kosher Salt
1/4 teaspoon Granulated Garlic (was out of the powder variety)
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground Black Pepper
In a Food Processor, using the Pulse function, process with stop & go pulses until chunky, scraping down sides with rubber spatula in between. Process until semi-smooth. This recipe is incredible, a breeze to make, and multi uses as dip, spread, pasta sauce, and grilled cheese sandwiches! Love it!

Love this recipe!  I had to substitute the  Jalopeno since I didn't have a fresh one, used pickled kind instead, it was great.  Next time I will try it just as written.  I have already shared this recipe, others love it too!  Great with pita chips.  I love it on dark rye bread.  What about a grilled sandwich?   Yummmmm!!

Followed the directions exactly. I left out the jalapeño pepper and still enjoyed the perfect little kick from the cayenne pepper. This pimento cheese is amazing and family approved! Will definitely make again...in double batches!

Made no changes in the recipe, and it was wonderful.  The jalapeno gives it just a little spark of heat, and I'll definitely be making it again.

Super good and really great base to  tweak with your own flavor twist. 

I cut back the cream cheese a bit and did more mayo. Doubled the cayenne. I smoked a pablano and a jalapeño ahead of time. Deseeded and took the skin off the peppers. Minced them and added some of both based on how hot the peppers were. 

I suggest leaving this in the fridge a week before eating. The flavor so take a while to really marry up. 

Great for sandwiches or for snack crackers (especially if you like it on the spicy side).

So easy to keep these ingredients in your pantry/frig for a quick and easy appetizer.  The only addition I made was to add a little Worcestershire sauce to the recipe.  Be careful though, you might be tempted to nibble on it when no one is looking ??

Loved it! I left out the cayenne and added the Worcestershire and mustard as recommended. I asked my husband what he thought; he said it would be better with bacon...so I added freshly crumbled bacon. It was off the charts amazing! (I mean really, what isn't better with bacon??) Thank you for a great recipe!

Love it! My go-to recipe! I use a 16 oz block of extra sharp cheddar. When I first read the recipe I wasn't sure if it meant 2 cups - shredded or 2 shredded cups, so I went with 2 cups shredded. Also you can use cream cheese or Neufchâtel cheese (accidentally picked that up once) and it tastes just the same. I use a whole 8oz jar or pimentos, drained, because I'm too lazy to measure after I drain them! I don't put in the jalapeños!

I made the recipe exactly as stated and though it was great.  I thought it was a tad heavy with the cream cheese.  I will try the mustard and Worcestershire next time as original poster stated but ease up on the cream cheese or add more cheddar.  I did the optional jalapeno and thought it gave it great color and a little heat too.  Best recipe I’ve found so far.

Excellent pimento cheese. As previous reviewers have said the Extra Sharp cheddar cheese makes a big difference in how this turns out. I think the next time I make this recipe I will cut back on the mayonnaise a little,  I would like it a little less creamy.

This is perfect on toast, in a tomato sandwich, in grilled cheese. I'm sure there are much more uses. It's so good, I imagine I'll always have some made, ready for a snack. 
I only had sharp cheese on hand but will try it with extra sharp. I didn't use a jalapeño, but I did use 1/8 tsp of paprika.

This is a great recipe that I like to mix up sometimes with diced bacon bits instead of the jalapeño. Growing up in Atlanta, pimento cheese is a staple and not cheap to by at stores. This is a quick and easy recipe that everyone will love and enjoy, whether your in the low country or the  Rocky Mountains.

Made this for a social function,, everyone loved it asking for the recipe.  Only change I made was no jalapeño only because I didn't have one. No flavor was lost.

I was thrilled to find this recipe - my Southern mother-in-law used to make it and since I never paid attention to kitchen stuff back in those days I didn't have her recipe.  I can't eat spicy things so I left out the jalapeno but for me, it did not hurt the recipe.  Loved it!  Thanks

I liked this better than the Palmetto pimento cheese. I used it to make biscuits which came out better than I'd imagined using the recipe on the side of the Rumford baking powder can substituting this pimento spread for half the shortening.

I am a  southern girl through and through, and a little picky about my Pimento Cheese....but this one is top notch!  I have tried it both with and without the Worcestershire Sauce/Dry Mustard suggestion and loved it both ways! I am surprised any of it even made it's way into the fridge...because I was eating right out of the bowl!

The OP commented that the addition of worcestershire and mustard was an improvement, so that's the way I made it to begin with.  Not knowing how it would have tasted before, I will say this is very good, but I'm going to make it per the original recipe and see which way I like better.  Here in the Carolina's pimento cheese is a popular appetizer at restaurants, so I know what good pimento cheese tastes like, and I'm saying this is a strong 4 out of 5.  Thanks!
