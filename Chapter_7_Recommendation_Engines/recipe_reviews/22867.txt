I did not use a pie plate I made several smaller versions in 5x5 pans so I could freeze them. Worked out great. This really does taste good, maybe a tad runny so maybe a few more crackers needed. Nice warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I've read recipes for Mock Apple Pie for years and finally decided I wanted to try it.  If you don't tell anyone they will think it's apple pie, but when I make real apple pie there is texture.  There are discernable apple pieces.  This comes out more like thick applesauce. I do appreciate being able to try the recipe once.

I've used this recipe for years and no one believes it doesn't contain apples. Everyone loves it!
