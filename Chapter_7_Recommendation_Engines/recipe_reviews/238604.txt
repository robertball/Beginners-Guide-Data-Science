I cut this to half the recipe and pretty much followed the recipe.  I used scallions rather than chives, and I probably got a little heavy-handed with the butter.  I think the next time I would just use my garlic press rather than roasting the garlic and so cut down the amount of garlic in it.  I might try just using a little more of the Classico Alfredo sauce rather than the milk, too.  Be sure that you are generous with the panko and butter on the top---you need to judge that by the size of the surface of the dish you are using.  I would definitely make this again!  Thanks, Arich01!

Needed a side to go with my meatloaf and this filled the bill. I like to salt my water when I boil potatoes, so with the addition of the Alfredo sauce, this is a good solid alternative potato dish. I did top it with the Panco crumbs & French's fried onion. Thank you ARich01,  good job;;)

This sound like a great recipe, would like to know if this could be made-ahead the day before and baked just before your dinner party?
Thanks

I didn't peel my potatoes. I also didn't used bread crumbs. It turned out great. This is a good recipe with a little tweak to it.
