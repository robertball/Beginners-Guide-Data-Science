Really good, especially after fiddling.  Stay with me here!: instead of ground beef, I used pork sausage and added an egg, italian-style seasoning and bread crumbs.  Make Tbsp-size meatballs and brown in a large pan with some diced onion. When brown, drain the fat, add the sauce ** and a can of diced tomatoes with the juice ** then ignore it for awhile to let it simmer together, then continue with the recipe as above.  Sounds like a lot more work, but it's really not - you can even prepare the meatballs in the morning and put them on a plate in the fridge or freezer until you're ready to start dinner (put a long piece of plastic wrap sprayed with Pam on the plate first, then fold it over the meatballs to cover). Besides, you feel so Martha!!  Really good with a giant caesar salad and a big hunk of crusty bread.

Made this last night for 20 people.  Everyone raved about it but I would next time add more sauce.  I don't like when it gets too dry.  Otherwise, it was tasty and it was a crowd please...and it was super easy!  I'll make again for sure.

I have never made before...and wanted something easy.  It was good.  I do think that you need to add more spices.  I used 2 garlic cloves and added some oregano as well.  Great as a basic for anyone to play around with.  Thanks for the post.

My kids actually thanked me for such a yummy dinner! You know you have a hit when kids actually thank you! (Husband liked it too!) I added more sauce too but I like it more saucy. I also used Parmesan because I didn't have any Romano and that worked just fine. Will definitely make it again.

This is a perfect quick & easy weeknight meal that my family loves.  I use ground turkey, add fresh sliced mushrooms and omit the ramono cheese (just double the mozzarella cheese).  The leftovers are even better!

Overall, this recipe was tasty, but a little dry.  Next time I will add more sauce.

I did a mix of sausage and ground beef to help the seasonings concern - and it was awesome.  May add a bit more sauce next time - but no one had anything but rave reviews.  Thanks.

This is great-I usually leave out the ground beef, since I do not care for it in my pasta, and serve this with a side of meatballs.

This is an easy recipe, I would suggest using Italian Sausage instead of ground beef and make sure you use a sauce with a lot of flavor.

This isn't an awe inspiring recipe, but it is quick, easy, and very kid friendly.  My mother makes basically the same thing using Italian sausage.  I find I like that better.  I used Newman's Own Marinara, which has a lot of flavor, if you use cheap or bland sauce make sure you doctor it.  I couldn't find Mastaccioli so I used whole wheat Penne.  Turns out 4 cups is about half a box.  Also, I added about half a jar of water to keep it from drying out.  
I assembled the night before and baked at 350 for about 45 minutes.

This is great with modifications.  Very easy to prepare.  I used spicy italian sausage (sweet would be good too) and mixed in extra sauce because it seemed too dry otherwise.  What I like about this recipe is that you can separate the recipe into two dishes and freeze one for later....just hold the cheese till you are ready to bake the 2nd one.

This is your basic Italian-American dish.. red sauce, pasta, & cheese baked on top. I would add a more sauce as it was a dry, but otherwise good. Will make again for comfort food!!

An easy to make recipe, but with very little taste.  As printed, it is well suited as a quick family recipe that is easy to make in bulk and sure to please a finicky child's palate.  To make the dish healthier and more interesting, I added garlic, eggplant, basil, oregano, salt and pepper, and replaced the ground beef with ground turkey.

Wow! I followed a few tips from some other reviewers and this turned out to be quite possibly the best thing I have made from this site. Everyone loved it! Definitely mix 1/2 hamburger and 1/2 Italian sausage, saute an onion with the meat, and add more sauce. Great recipe!

I freelance with this one a bit.  I double the Mozzarella.  For cheese lovers, do this.  Put 8 oz in with the pasta and sauce and the other 8 on top of the dish.  I also, sprinkle a bit of extra Romano on top.
Sautee a little onion and garlic in olive oil, before browning your meat in with it.  If that is to your taste.  This is a fabulous dish!

Great recipe!  I used extra sauce and extra shredded cheese.  Also, used grated parmesan cheese instead of Romano as well as a mix of sausage and hamburger. Threw in some basil, garlic and oregano for some extra flavor.  All in all, a great base recipe that is EASY to make and fun to play with!

I used italian sausage instead of hamburger, seasoned with italian seasoning & garlic. I used a few more ounces of sauce too. Very easy to make, very simple. Next time I will probably use a tastier sauce. There wasn't enough flavor but next time Ill change that!

We love pasta at my house! This recipe was delish!! I added fresh green bell peppers and onions in the mix and then poured it into the pan and cooked it all together with cheese on top. It add more texture and flavor. My 1 year old even ate a bowl and a half!!! We will have this one again and again!!!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  Not only was it YUMMY, it was soooo easy! Thanks to fellow reviews suggestions I made the following changes:  used turkey instead of beef  and while browning the meat added italian seasoning, garlic salt and a crushed galic clove.    I also used penne pasta andparmesan cheese because that is what I had on hand:)

I too used Parmesan instead of Romano and it turned out delicious!  I didn't put any meat into it, but I think it would be good with either Italiean Sausage or Beef in it! 

Great as leftovers too!

The kids love this.  I speed up the process by cooking up ground beef in one pound packages and keep in the freezer until ready to use.  Makes this a quick and easy dinner after work.

Made this tonight and got rave reviews. I took advise from a few reviews I read.  The recipe calls for one pound of ground beef, I used 1/2 pound of ground beef and 1/2 pound of ground sausage.  I used about 3 ounces more of sauce and I added an Italian seasoning 'cause one of the reviews said this needed more seasoning.   I got great reviews and I loved it myself.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I had to add ingredients or it would have been bland. I added more sauce, black olives, onions, green peppers, mushrooms, garlic, pepperoni, and a few dashes of Frank's Red Hotsauce. With additions to your liking this is really easy and good. Will make this again.

This was pretty good and fast.  I cooked ground beef with Chicken Italian Sausage taken out of casings.  Two and a half jars of spaghetti sauce with peppers, onion, garlic etc.  I also split the sauce and mixed half of the noodles with sauce and meat and poured into pan, layered with provolone cheese then added rest of noodles and sauce and put mozzerella on top.  We love cheese. Served with a green salad and rolls.  Turned out great.  Thanks for the post.

This recipe is delicious and soooo easy to make for a big family! I found that it needs to be cooked for about twice the time listed in the recipe but that could be my oven.

I made this for our Mother's Day dinner for 10 people and everyone loved it!  The only comment made was that it needed a little more sauce.  I doubled the recipe and put some of the noodles, sauce and cheese in an 8 x 8 pan and did not add meat (for the vegetarians and the picky kids!).  The remaining ingredients did fit in the 9 x 13 pan, but it was very full!  Great recipe and very easy!!

This was really good!!  My girls 1 & 3 cleaned their plates.  I would definitely recommend adding a can of Tomato Sauce.  I did not use the ground beef, I used a pound of hot italian sausage and browned it with a few teaspoon of italian seasoning.  I will make this again most definitely!!!!!

I'm knocking off a star cos cos it's a good idea to add things to this recipe. I added onion, garlic powder and plenty of Italian seasoning to the sauce. I used parmesan cheese instead of romano. Other than that, this is a good dish and very, very easy. I have also used ground turkey in place of the beef, and it was great.

Very pleasing meal!  I followed previous ratings and added italion sausage & pepperoni.  I also added mushrooms.  I added a can of tomato sauce to keep it from drying out too much.  Became an instant favorite!

This is now a regular at our house.  I usually use Italian sausage since it adds more flavor but it's pretty good with ground beef as well. I've also used pepperoni slices. Also, it's an easy recipe to play with. I haven't tried a cheese (asiago makes it special) or vegetable (green peppers, onion, or mushroom)add-in that didn't turn out great.  It's so easy to make and freezes well too.

Wonderful recipe, I have made this several times and eveyone loves it. I doubled it and made it for my bunco group, everyone asked for the recipe before they left. Good with the ground beef but better with Italian Sausage.

My husband really likes this meal. But he does demand that I add more than double the cheese and I prefer to add a little basil, oregano, and garlic to the sauce. Not a very healthy meal when all the extra cheese is added but definitely a very good one. Also very easy!

Pretty good.  Fiance asked if it took a lot of preparation, and when I told him I prepared and cooked it in less than an hour he seemed surprise.  After reading reviews, I did use some extra sauce so my pasta wasn't so dry.  I will probably make this again.

this is an excellent recipe!!!  my boyfriend also said that it wasn't saucy enough.  i also used grated parm, but stirred it all into the sauce (i think that was why it ended up kinda dry).  also, the kind of sauce we get only comes in 26oz jars, so i added an extra 8oz can of sauce.  we also eat A LOT of burritos here, so i added the extra tomatoes and black olives....YUM!!  i've made this a bunch of times and it only gets better!!

I didn't have any romano so I subbed dried parm.  It tasted great.  My only complaint is that it wasn't saucy enough.  I think that is due in part to the dried parm.  I will try it again with romano instead.

Excellent recipe! I used Penne because it holds the sauce better. I had planned to make my family's favorite 5-star baked ziti recipe but was missing a key ingredient to I decided to try this. It was so quick and easy and my family absolutely loved it. Will definitely make again!

Excellent!! Delicious, fast and easy!I too used parmesan cheese, and penne pasta that I already had on hand. I also sauteed some garlic, onion and italian seasoning with the beef. When I went to preheat the oven, I found that it wasn't working... so I combined the beef, pasta, sauce and part of the parmesan, heated it through, placed it in the baking dish, topped with remaining cheese, and microwaved on high for just 5 minutes. It turned out perfect-- YUM. This will be a regular on our table

Didn't have Romano but was great with Parmesan instead. Sprinkle a little extra Parmesan on just before serving to kick it up a notch. Great reheated the next day. Truely a quick and easy recipe. Thanks Kraft!

Great quick and easy meal that had my husband asking for more!  I seasoned everything with garlic salt and minced onions, plus for added garlic flavor I cut up 2 small garlic cloves and of course salt and pepper to taste!
Made that dish PERFECT!

I had planned to make this when I found out my sister-in-law who is celiac was coming over so instead of mostaccioli I used gluten-free penne. I added sauteed onions and garlic per the other reviewers suggestions. I forogt the meat (oops) and used parmesean instead of romano (it was all I had on hand). Everyone - including my two-year old - loved it. We will definitely make this often!

This is a good base recipe but I think it needs some alterations.  Make sure you use a really tasty sauce!  I added peppers, mushrooms and onions as well as lots of garlic and some basil.

This was good but I did follow everyone's advice and add more sauce.  I used 1/2 mild italian sausage and 1/2 ground beef - cooked it with an onion, garlic and green pepper and added plenty of seasoning (italian, oregano, basil).  I didn't have Romano cheese so I stuck with Motz. only and used parm lightly on top.  I doubled it and froze half, hopefully it freezes well!

It was good, needed a bit more sauce.  Nothing really spectacular about it.

GREAT!  Quick and easy... gotta love that :)  I didn't use the ground beef.  I used half spicy sausage and half meatballs instead.

i thought this recipe tasted good but my boyfriend loved it! being it was just us, i used between 3 - 3 1/2 cups of pasta in lieu of adding extra sauce as advised by several reviewers. fyi: mostaccioli looks like ziti with ridges. the italian translation is "little mustaches". thanks kraft foods!

this was hugely successful at our rehearsal dinner! We added a bit more sauce and Italian spices to keep it moist as we made it a lot larger amount! Will use this recipe again.

Quick, easy, delicious dinner. I used ground turkey, penne pasta, Ragu Sundried Tomato & Basil Pasta Sauce, and Kraft's Parmesan & Romano Blend Grated Cheese, and regular shredded mozzarella. I wanted to add some sliced Italian sausage for a little meaty kick, but didn't have any on hand. I'll have to add that next time!

I added garlic (an "of course" in my world) and some italian seasonings and due to some missing spaghetti sauce big jars, I used 3 different flavors of sauce and it still turned out great.  Yum!

I just made this for dinner tonight and the whole family loved it.  Very simple and yet yummy. A nice change from the usual spaghetti.  I added some oregeno, basil & garlic to the mixture to add some extra taste. We will definately make it again.
