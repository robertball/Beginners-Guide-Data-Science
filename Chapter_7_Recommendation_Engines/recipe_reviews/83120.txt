This glaze was really, really good - and although I used a regular bone-in shank (gotta have that pea soup after wards!) it still came out beautifully.  Our shanks in Canada are already whittled down to remove the fatty layer so no extra work there. I also used the usual inserted whole cloves rather than add the spice to the marinade, It was a great Fall dish with scallop potatoes (the cheater kind) and garlicey green beans. Nancy

Very good.  I made this in an electric roaster, while our Thanksgiving turkey cooked in the oven.  It turned out great, but there should be "Orange" somewhere in the title, as I found the orange juice concentrate a promonent flavour. I'd recomend it, and make it again. Thanks!

I love this recipe. The citrus flavors and the fruity apricot with the tangy soy sauce and the sweet honey all combine beautifully as they bake into the ham.

I have never baked a ham before, and all I can say is WOW! I followed the recipe exactly and this glaze is amazing, and everyone loved it. I will definitely use this recipe again.
