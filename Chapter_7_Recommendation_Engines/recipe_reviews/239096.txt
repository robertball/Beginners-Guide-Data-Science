This recipe has been added to our regular rotation. It's the first time I've added Cajun seasoning to a dish and we LOVE it!  That, with the sausage, makes for an amazing flavor combination. I do add the peas for color and because they go so well with the dish. I usually do just 1 cup of heavy cream, and then 1 cup of half & half or milk, to cut calories (though I've read that half & half can become lumpy if overheated, I've never had that issue...yet).  Do try this easy dinner tonight!**Update 12/14** I just realized that the recipe above does not list peas as an optional ingredient. On the Hilshire Farms website, where I originally discovered this recipe, it mentions adding a cup of frozen peas to the pasta during the last minute of boiling.  And, as I said before, it is good with the peas!

This recipe was so good! I made it last night & have already given it out to at least 4 different people! I started by sautéing an onion and 4 cloves of minced garlic. I only used 1.5 tablespoons of Cajun seasoning because I didn't want it to be too hot for my little eaters. I did add defrosted frozen peas to it as another reviewer suggested. Would also be good with Spanish. Everyone loved it in my house!! Will keep recommending this recipe! Mmm!!!

I substituted campanelle pasta for penne.  I sauteed the kielbasa in 1 Tbls of butter and once browned, stirred in 1 Tbls of flour to make a quick roux of sorts.  This helped to thicken the sauce once I stirred in only 1 1/2 cups heavy cream.  I used 1 tsp Cajun seasoning as I was feeding 4 little boys and used fresh shredded Parmesan.  I also added peas to the pasta as it cooked.  Everyone devoured it and told me I definitely need to make this again!

I liked how simple it was to prepare and how quickly it was ready. I used spicy sausage which was a great complement to the sauce. I also sauteed some onion along with the sausage. It made a good amount for 2 people with 3 or 4 servings for left overs. I will add peas in it the next time I prepare it to give it a little color (and I love peas in Alfredo dishes). You can add almost any of your favorite spices or vegetables to suit your taste.

Make the alfredo sauce in a separate pan and incorporate all the ingredients when they're done- since sausage tends to be greasy.

The sauce on this recipe never really thickened.  I think too much whipping cream was called for and next time I am going to use half the suggested amount as it was soupy to say the least.  However, my family did love the taste and we used a slotted spoon for serving.  The recipe also calls for a 14 oz. package of sausage, but Hillshire Farms sausage is now a 12 oz. package so know that in advance.  I will make this again but will most definitely use less cream.

I used Andouille sausage and added some sliced onions, served over penne. This was surprisingly good and SUPER fast. The next time I make this, I'm adding some veggies - peas and mushrooms would make this KILLER.

I used bow tie pasta and Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning, with Hillshire Farms Smoked Turkey Sausage.  My family loved it!  While it might be a little on the spicy side for a few people, those who don't like spicy should just use a little less of the seasoning.  I would highly recommend this for an easy, but elegant dinner!

This was SO easy to make! But that's not even the best part, my 2 year old is an extremely picky eater and he loved it! This will definitely be a regular week-night meal :) Oh, and I followed the recipe exactly. No additions and no subtractions.

Followed this recipe according to directions but added a little dried onion (because I hate chopping onion!) and cut up red pepper and it was great. I can be a wimp when it comes to spice and I didn't think the cajun seasoning added any heat to the recipe. I did use hot smoked sausage and that added a great flavor and just enough heat. Will definitely be making this again!

I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, however I used more pasta so that it was not so soupy.  I probably used 12 oz of pasta, instead of 8 oz.   I loved this meal and my three kids had multiple helpings. Great recipe!

I modify the sauce... First I cook minced garlic with a little butter on med heat. Then add the cream, cajun seasoning, parsley flakes and cook for about 5 min.  And then I mix it all up in a pot with the already cooked pasta and the already browned sausage. 6 out of 6 people in the family LOVE it. I also add shrimp to it if I have it.

I don't have a lot of time to prepare elaborate dinners during the week, so I thought this recipe was fantastic. I also sauteed onions and peppers after browning the sausage (I used slightly more sausage).   Sausage can be oily, so after I sauteed it, I took it out, and drained it very well, patting it down with paper towels; wiped out the skillet, and continued with  the recipe.  I added peas and mushrooms to mine, and will add sundried tomatoes next time.  Great recipe!

Loved this recipe. Made it tonight for dinner. Next time I will have to double the recipe to make sure to have enough to feed my army. I'll be adding more cajun spice the 2tsp was not enough and I'll be adding some fresh spinach for a veggie and color.

We used tricolor rotini which made a nicer presentation, added the peas as suggested, and cut down on the cajun seasoning for my one picky eater who doesn't like too spicy. I also substituted half and half for 1/2 of the heavy cream. You could do a variety of spice and vegetable combinations to suit your taste. This was easy and super fast and made a great supper. Will definitely be adding this to the rotation!

Very tasty and super easy to make. Will definitely make again. I used some "Emeril's Essense" I had already mixed up from a previous recipe as the cajun seasoning. I never knew an alfredo type sauce was so easy to make. I don't get why so many places serve such dreadful alfredos.

This was so yummy! We all ate too much of it, it was that good! And it was very, very easy to throw together. (Note: I didn't have Cajun spice, I used Paprika, which I love - and it was very rich and delicious with the cream sauce)

Fyi dont mix up teaspoons and tablespoons....big flavor difference....I was about to chalk it up to a new flavor recipe but it was my fault for reading incorrectly. Also did angel hair pasta turned out great other than too salty from too much seasoning.

I thought it was delicious.  Based on what another reviewer said, I only used 1.5 cups of cream and that was perfect.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Would definitely make again.

5 stars with my additions.  I removed the browned sausage and added onions, minced garlic, frozen peas, and fresh mushrooms to the pan drippings and cooked the vegetables through.  Then made the sauce as directed and added the sausage and pasta.  I don't buy special spices like Cajun spice, mainly due to the excessive salt in them.  I used the Cajun spice mix recipe on this site and scaled it down to yield the 2 t. needed for this recipe.  My husband and I love things hot and spicy so I added a bit more cayenne.  I used bow tie pasta...cute and tasty!

This recipe was easy and delicious! I used wide egg noodles instead of fettuccine noodles. It was a little bit watery, though, so I need to either scale back on the heavy cream or tweak something else in my next attempt.

Easy and tasty dish. I didn't change a thing (other than adding peas), and it was delicious. I was a little nervous about the Cajun seasoning since I'm not a huge lover of spicy foods, but the seasoning just added great flavor. Not too much heat.

Oh my gosh....soooooo good! I made it just like the recipe with nothing added and it was a hit! I did have to use 1 cup of heavy cream and one cup of half-and-half because I ran out of heavy cream. I just let it simmer longer to thicken. Delicious!

My family loved this recipe. I did double the sauce.  I garnished this recipe with fresh Roma tomatoes and chopped green onions.  I doubled the sauce because my family loves sauce. I used 2 cups of heavy cream and 2 cups of milk. I did have to add 2 T.  flour to make the sauce the consistency my family likes. I used Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning because that is what I had on hand. I only added 1 Tsp.  of Creole seasoning as it is very spicy.

came up as the "recipe of the day" - had not thought about using cajun seasoning.  I'm bad about using recipes as a "suggestion for a place to start"  ;).   Very flexible for using what you have on hand (I had smoked sausage, broccoli, tomato, onion and peas) - nice alternative to chicken alfredo or spaghetti.  Adjusted quantities by sight for a family of 3.  VERY QUICK and it will make me look for other sausage recipes, I forget that we like them!

The amount of pasta in the recipe is only 8 ounces which is only enough pasta for 2 people. I added a lot more pasta and substituted smoke sausage for Hillshire Polish Kielbasa sausage. The dish turned out really yummy. More than enough for a family of 3!

I’ve made this 3 times. After the first time it quickly went into our weekly rotation. 6 picky kids, busy sports schedules. This was easy, fast and delicious. Lots of flavor. I did add a bit of minced garlic, but changed nothing else.

I have made this quite a few times for my family and it is always a hit, even the second day. One of the best quick and easy recipes I have tried on this site. I would not change a thing. I did use a homemade Cajun seasoning recipe from this site as well.

I wanted to do something different with this. Used a beef sausage and used whole milk instead of heavy cream. I browned meat, added flour to the grease and let it thicken. I put the milk and Cajun seasoning in and let it cook and combine. I let it cool some then added about a cup of fire roasted tomatoes and a tablespoon of tomato paste (the cooling was to prevent curdling). I added shredded parmesan and it was delicious!

Would have given it a five star but I change it do to time. With my husband and get back before me after a 14 hours work shift I knew it had to be ready when he walked in. I premade the noodles but them in the refrigerator,  but a jar of sauce plus everything else in a 2 quart slow cooker and had it on low for four hours. It came out great.

The whole family really liked this. I followed the suggestion from other reviews and added a cup of frozen peas when I added the cream and spices to the mixture. I also added 1 clove of minced garlic as well to help round out and enhance the flavor. Definitely will make this again.

This was a super easy. Even with adding broccoli, red, yellow, orange peppers, chicken and shrimp it was quick. I also added chicken and shrimp for some added variety. This will be a household meal. My family loved it!

Great recipe exactly as is written. I have added it to my repertoire. Nice heat without going overboard.
I really like spice so I also tried making it with hot Italian sausage which turned out well.

The sauce isn’t quite as thick as I would like it, but I think I can thicken it up next time I make this dish. It’s quick, easy and tastes delicious. I’ll definitely be making this dish more again. I think I’ll try adding some bacon bits in with it next time too.

This was fantastic. I did change up a few things. I added fresh onions and peppers to the pan before cooking the sausage. I also put this all to the side before I made the sauce in the pan. In addition to the cream I added half a cup of milk. It was a huge hit with the whole family.  This will definitely be added to the request list!

The only problem that I had with this recipe is that there wasn't enough for my family.  I'll have to double it next time.  One other problem was that it was really salty.

One of my favorite recipes! We are not big spicy food lovers so I used garlic and a little bit of black pepper instead. The whole family loved it! :))

It was easy to make. I think I might try this with shrimp or chicken. I only had spiral pasta, which I loved instead of the penne.

This was amazing. Couple things I did differently. Used a turkey sausage not Jenny o brand. Less sodium not using Jenny o. Added shrimp cooked. And at the end when mixing the cheese I had a 2 teaspoons of crushed red pepper because I like a little more kick. Mixed in the ingredients, let it rest for 3-4 mins and put on the organic green onion and diced tomatoes to finish for color and flavor. Wife and I love it. We will probably do it again.

I doubled the recipe to feed our family and everybody really liked it.  I didn't have Cajun seasoning - so I used Tony Chackere's Creole seasoning. I would have liked more liquid... but the pasta inhaled it.

Made this for my family of 6 tonight and we loved it! As a mom of four, quick and easy dinners is a must and this was definitely both of those. I did cut back the Cajun seasoning a bit due to my kids not liking a lot of heat. This is definitely a dish I will be making again and again.

I didn’t have Cajun seasoning so I used 1/2 tsp cayenne and 1/2 tsp paprika. Just enough heat but not too spicy for the kids. Amazing meal. Will definitely make again.

I couldn't quite find the recipe I was looking for, but thought this one had promise to use as a base recipe for the ingredients I wanted to use. I added a small amount of oil (less than 1 Tbsp) to the skillet and put in a chopped pepper along with the sausage slices so those could cook together. After those were ready I turned the heat down and added broccoli, put on the lid and let it heat (I used frozen because I didn't have time to use the fresh I had on hand - either one would work.) Instead of just plain pasta, I used 1 1/2 containers of cheese tortellini that I cooked separately. After the broccoli was heated. I added the tortellini to the skillet. I made the sauce as stated and added that to the skillet with all the other ingredients and mixed it well. My family and I really enjoyed it.

I also used a little beef or chicken broth with the heavy cream and parmesan cheese.  It is good with Julian style red, green, and yellow peppers sautéed in it too!

This was the easiest, yummiest recipe EVER! I used a different type of sausage, added tomatoes, bell peppers and garlic but still followed the directions as listed. I’ll be making this twice a month lol. Thank you!

My family loves this!  I actually made a little more pasta and added cut fresh asparagus to the pasta when it was boiling.  I also added a little more parmesan cheese to thicken the sauce a bit more.  Delish!   Will definitely be making this again!

I made this for the family. They ate it and our teen thought it tasted like "pepperoni pizza noodles." Which apparently was a compliment because she ate it.
My fiance and his daughter ate the leftovers. I gave it four stars because my family ate it but I didn't think it had much flavor. 

*Note I had to add a little flour to the sauce to get it to thicken up.

We love this dish. I used half and half and a couple of added handfuls of grated mozzarella cheese, which thickened it up plus added added a wonderful cheesy taste.

I loved this. I did add more sausage and probably didn't follow all the directions as clearly as I could. I read a few things about the sauce not thickening like it was supposed to. So I did add a little bit of flour. I did the 2 cups of heavy cream with 1 1/2 cups of parmesan. And I also doubled the amount of sausage cooking it first with mushrooms and using the drippings to flavor the sauce.

My son LOVED this so much! As I was cooking, he kept walking into the kitchen to see what smelled so good. He was very happy with the end result! Easy to make too! I didn't have Cajun seasoning, so I used Italian and it worked well. I also added a handful of broccoli florets. I'll remake this with Cajun in the future. 
Any dish that gets this much praise from my son is definitely worth making again. Thanks for sharing :)

This was just okay for me.  It’s a decent base recipe, but it definitely could be jazzed up a bit... perhaps with peppers and maybe even a second meat, (shrimp or chicken?) to give it a jambalaya feel, keeping with the Cajun seasoning.  It had good flavor but was really nothing more than a Parmesan mac and cheese with sausage.

This is too good to be so simple!  And, I love the twist of the sausage.  It adds an awesome flavor.  Can't go wrong with the family, sausage is one of my husband and son's most favorite food!

This is delicious & one of the simplest meals ever. Dropped to 4 stars only because it's not all that healthy. I used Tony Chachere's  Creole Seasoning & eyeballed about 1 tsp. Much more would have been way too much. If recommend starting at half the recommendation for seasoning & than add to taste. My picky kids even love this!

I did make alter this recipe slightly. In a sauce pan, I melted two tablespoon of butter and added about two to three tablespoons of flour. I added the heavy cream to this and added it to the sausage. I proceeded with the rest of the recipe. It turned out amazing!!! This will be added to our regular dinner rotation!! (Note: I have some VERY picky eaters in our house, and this got wonderful reviews from them.)

I am actually making this again for dinner tonight.  I do cut the heavy cream with half and half some.  I usually make extra pasta also.  My husband doesn't like peas but it does need something extra so once I added edamame and another asparagus. Of course I don't have either one in the house so may just throw in some spinach I need to use up.

This is so good. I saute garlic, chopped onion and yellow pepper with the sausage and then add fresh spinach and chopped tomatoes with the parmesan cheese at the end. Yummy!!! I've also substituted coconut cream for the heavy cream. Still yummy!

Loved it, and so easy and quick.  I did substitute the heavy cream for light cream, and added the frozen peas for color.  I also could not find Cajun spice so I bought Emeril's spice  instead...I mean, it looked Cajun. At first, I was a bit hesitant about adding the spice, so I started with only 1 tsp, but the taste was so good that I added the other teaspoon and then some more,  Delicious! Will definetely make it again.

Based on other reviews I did the following and it was very tasty.
Sauteed onion and garlic in butter, when soft added 1 tbsp of flour. whisked until smooth.  added cream, cheese.  Just before finished added 1 cup of peas.  Will make again!  Quick and easy.

My family loves this.  I've made this dish several times.  I use 12 ounces of pasta instead of 8 then thicken the sauce by adding either flour to the sausage after cooking it in the pan (about a tablespoon) or  mixing some cornstarch into the liquid--both seem to work equally well.  Instead of cream I use can milk, it works great and flavor is practically the same.  I used the cajun seasoning recipe also on allrecipes.com --it adds a great pizazz to the dish.

Super easy dinner solution that my kids love (even the picky one). Amount of Cajun seasoning in recipe is great - kicky but not too spicy. Yum.

With only 5 ingredients, very simple recipe with lots of flavor.  I used elbow macaroni instead since there was so much in the cabinet, and all ingredients together were amazing!  Adding this to our "must make on a regular basis" category.

I had jalapeño smoked sausage on hand so needless to say it was very spicy...it took me about 25 minutes from start to finish but it was very good.  Will definitely make it again!

THE BEST THE BEST THE.... BEST! Talk about quick and easy and delicious! Nothing was changed to the recipe just added some diced green peppers after the first time of making ONLY because it was on hand and going bad. I've kept it in the recipe ever since. My best at hand I used 4C parmesan cheese (haven in a jar).

This was surprisingly good, although I did make some changes.  I made it even easier with a jar of Prego Alfredo sauce.  Used only 1 tsp of Cajun seasoning because I thought it might be a bit too spicy for us.  Added peas like others suggested.  Both of us really liked it for what it was.  No gourmet here, just a simple weeknight meal.  There was some leftover and I added some leftover kidney beans to it and a little more seasoning.  Even better with the beans.  I will make this again sometime, but will add kidney beans and the other tsp of Cajun.  Yes, it ends up being a new recipe, but if you are going to make this, you might try some of my suggestions if they sound like something your family would like

Flavor wise this pasta dish was very good. But it's the kind of food, I can't serve to my family without feeling some guilt.  Processed meat is already bad for you without having to add heavy cream to it.. I had to tweak it a little bit to at least cut down on the fat and calorie content. So for that, I cooked the sliced sausage and removed from the pan and wiped off all the fat rendered, using some paper towels. Then I sauteed some mushrooms in the same pan and put aside with the sausage. I used half and half for the cream. For the Cajun seasoning , I only used half the amount because of the kids. When the sauce thickened up a bit, I added back the sausage and mushrooms to the pan. Last, but not least, I used whole wheat pasta.

Wow what as recipe.  I did not use hillshire farm sausage I used another brand but boy was it good.  I have to double or triple all the recipes  I make because if have three teenage boys. They usually have seconds but this time they had thirds.  I used grape tomatoes because that is what I had  but I think  they went over better that a diced tomato would have.

This is simple, fast and delicious! Of course you can substitute other sausages like chicken or turkey if you prefer, and you can add some veggies as suggested in the cook's notes, or make it exactly as per the recipe. It's just good! The whole family enjoyed this and I will making it many times in the future.

Added garlic to the dish. It turned out ok my wife and I liked it but the kids not so much. We will eat it again, the sausage adds a unique layer of flavoring to what we usually have grilled chicken in.

This was simple enough for me to throw together on a weeknight and we happened to already have everything. I sauteed onions with the sausage in about 2 Tbsp of butter and added flour to make a roux, as suggested by another reviewer. I also microwaved and "drained" about 1 cup of spinach leaves I had frozen and added it just before the cream. I only used 1 tsp of creole seasoning (I don't have cajun, but it is basically the same) so as to reduce the heat a bit for my 2 and 4 year olds. Turned out fantastic!!

So good.  I used smoked turkey sausage and I made Cajun seasoning from a recipe from this site.  The next time I'd like to add some julienned zucchini.  This can only be a once-in-a-while dish because it must have vast amounts of fat but boy does it taste good.

This turned out so good! We used veggie sausage and vanilla almond milk instead of meat/cream. Also added a little bit of Worcester sauce, jerk seasoning and garlic, yum! I'll totally make it again!

I'm not big on sausage at all and what sent me here was actually seeing a dish from a Hillshire Farm sausage commercial. I'm still not too into the sausage itself but the flavor mixed with the Alfredo is great. I think I'll try adding some broccoli next time. Not bad though! I also recommend using shredded parmesan as well for a topping.

Delicious! Made it using fat free 1/2 & 1/2 (it's what I had), so did make a roux using 1 tbsp. melted butter and 1 tbsp. flour after I removed the browned sausage from the skillet. I also added chopped onion, fresh garlic, and sliced a red bell pepper and added it to the dish, too. Served with rotini pasta and we loved it! Took it easy on the cajun seasoning since my youngest doesn't like a lot of heat so I used Emeril's Essence as another reviewer mentioned (nice tip).

Good but the recipe doesn't call for any veggies, the pic appears to have some. IMO this needs some greens to help with the texture and color.

What a full-flavored but easy dish to make on a weekday after work!  I think I actually prefer this sausage alfredo to a chicken alfredo.  After reading others' reviews, I did the following:  used half & half instead of cream, used about 1.5 cups instead of 2 Cups of the half & half so it would not be soup-y, mixed in 1 Tbsp. of flour to make a bit thicker, and did add some green peas.  For my meat-loving husband and son, I also increased the amount of sausage.  None of these alterations changed the dish radically from the original.  Find what YOU like best to make it your own!  Keeping this one in my "Favorites" and using it when time is short.

This was so very yummy! When I was putting away the left overs, I was smelling it again and wanted to eat more, but I was so stuffed! We did add about a cup extra of the cream to make sure it had enough sauce. That was the perfect amount.

I have made something similar to this and I added grape tomatoes and fresh spinish to the sauce which I fixed separately... when frying the sausage I also added in some chopped onion... it is really good... be sure to drain sausage well before adding to sauce.

This was really good! I used chorizo and Italian bread cheese cause that's all I had.  It was a little soupy but I added my cheese which solved that little issue. Also I only used 1tsp of Cajun seasoning cause I wasn't sure how spicy it would be since I used chorizo instead of regular sausage. Overall very good and will make again ?

I'm glad this came out tasty and it was easy and quick!  Also, my 8 year old son ate it all up so that was great! I made the Cajun seasoning from a recipe I found on this same website.  I only omitted the red pepper flakes because the sausage was kinda spicy.  I used Farmer Johns Hot Louisiana Smoked Sausage. I added chopped fresh parsley and sliced cherry tomatoes. Good stuff :)

Instead of using plain smoked sausage, I used the new uncured Italian herb smoked sausage that Oscar myer came out with and it really added a lot of flavor. I also added sautéed onion and minced garlic.  It was delicious and even my picky husband loved it.

Super quick and easy and delicious too.  I only had 1 cup of heavy cream so I added just a little milk to stretch it and the amount of liquid was just right, not too soupy.  Will add to our rotation.

I loved making this recipe for a few years- it's quick, filling,  and the family likes it. I've always made it with chicken parmesan sausage  that my local market makes fresh and my own cajun seasoning.
However, since it's now necessary to go gluten-free, I haven't been able to find a gluten-free pasta that doesn't overpower the dish.

I made this and followed the almost exact directions (I didn't have smoked sausage, I only had Italian). As written, to me, it is a just bit rich and heavy. But a delicious recipe nonetheless! Next time I will half the heavy cream and sub milk, add more fresh garlic, add some shredded Swiss (too much Parmesan really doesn't melt well) or white sharp cheddar and a bit of salt. Oh and more peas. I added a slight bunch of frozen peas to the pasta at the last minute of cooking, next time I will add more. Took about 15 minutes for the sauce to thicken for me. Served this with a salad and garlic bread.
And it re-heated great to me by the way. Not heavy. Thank you for the recipe!

Sooo delicious. Smelled amazing and my boyfriend and I loved it. I added onions and cooked it with red pepper and onion sausage until caramelized, and I also used only 1 cup of cream and added butter and flour before putting in the cream to thicken the sauce. Also don't forget to add a teaspoon or so of salt! Quick easy and inexpensive will definitely make again

I have made this twice. I added baby Portobello mushrooms and some green onion for color. If you have a Fry's in your town, get yourself some of the Private selection graded parmesan cheese and use that. The smoked sausage gives it an awesome flavor. I cut it up an tossed it with chopped green onion and about 5 clovea of garlic and sautéed it all together. Cooked the noodles to all most done. Put it all together in a big deep skillet,poor the alfredo sauce which input in a small amount of oregano and basil along with the Cajun seasoning. And let it simmer for bout 5 minutes so all flavors marry together. Then some homemade garlic bread. Mmmm good. Going back for a 2nd helping!! Enjoy!!!

I added garlic and peas with the cream. I doubled the meat and plan to use left over chicken next time. It was excellent and super easy! Quick work night meal.

This will definitely be added to the dinner rotation. I added the peas like the suggestion and added the cajum seasoning to taste. The amount in the recipe was not enough for my taste buds and I added some garlic salt at the end. Yummy

This recipe is delicious, easy to make, and leaves plenty of leftovers for later(Cooking for two). We tried it both as the recipe directed (the best way in our opinion), and also with some kielbasa sausage we happened to have.  The kielbasa sausage didn't blend as well with the flavors but it was still alright. We will be continuing to try variations however the original recipe has thus far been the best. The only thing that I might suggest for sausage lovers is to add more sausage. Also, for those complaining of the grease, simply use paper towels to drain the grease from the sausage before you make the sauce. Cooking it all together in the seasoned pan enhances the flavor.

Not bad. We enjoyed this recipe and I'll probably make it again. I didn't have any heavy cream so I ended up making a white roux sauce and added some extra cheese to it.

This was very good! But, I did make some changes.  I sauteed 1 onion with pork brats, added broccoli floretes and diced tomato.  Only used 1/2 of the heavy cream.  Will make it again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I couldn't stop eating it. The family enjoyed it as well. As for those saying the sauce never thickened, I ran into the same problem, but its an easy fix. Just add some cornstarch to a very small amount of cool water, stir until it's combined, then add it to the sauce. If it's still not thickening, do it again. Remember that it will continue to thicken after you take it off the heat, so be careful. But other than that, this recipe is really good.

Easy and fantastic meal!  We have tried it with lite and turkey sausage as well as using heavy and half n half cream. The trick is to cook down the cream then add cheese till it is the consistency you like. Try different pastas as well.

Added chopped onion and chopped yellow pepper,  and couldn't find Cajun seasoning, but found Creole seasoning.  Used 1 tsp of that, excellent! !  Will make again, and might try shrimp or chicken.

my whole family loved this! I used 16oz penne pasta instead of 8oz and there was still plenty of sauce.  next time I may double the sausage too.  also, used half & half to reduce calories (slightly!)...may try lite sausage next time.

Surprisingly delicious.  Added saute'd garlic cloves like another person suggested and used gluten-free pasta.  12 oz. of GF pasta soaked up the sauce to perfection.  Also added some blackening seasoning and at the end added 1/2 a bag of steamfresh peas already cooked.  My husband and very picky 2 year daughter loved it too.  A recipe worth trying for sure.

This is my husband's favorite dish. The only thing I do differently than just following the recipe is I use shredded Parmesan instead of grated. I like the texture with shredded much better. But both ways are still yummy!

Amazing, I made this twice and added grilled chicken once, and I always make more sauce than it calls for. Always microwave left-overs with a wet paper towel over the dish.

this was good and I'm sure id have given five stars if id have used chicken, i felt like it was overly salty. next time i will try one tsp cajun and one tsp minced garlic, and i will go ahead and use chicken in place of sausage for less salty taste. overall we liked it

Came out a little greasy and not much flavor. Might be better with the hot Hillshire Farm sausage.

Quick, easy meal that the family liked. Next time I will add peas like others mentioned and i think that will make it perfect. I did add sautéed onions and garlic and that did help spice it ip slightly. I will definitely make this again!

We liked this recipe. I used chipotle seasoning because I grabbed the wrong thing but it worked just fine. If anything it was a little bland. I think I'd use spicy sausage next time and maybe some pepper and an onion as someone else suggested. It was very quick to make which I really liked.
