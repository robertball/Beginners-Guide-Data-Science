I AM THE OP. I made these recently and have some notes for you all. (1) The recipe was changed from original for some reason when posted here by AR. You only need one large skillet. Use half the butter, cook half the caps, removing those that are done, adding more butter and cooking the rest. Do not overcook or they become mushy. Keep them somewhat firm. (2) Neufchatel is a type of cream cheese with a milder flavor and sold right next to the regular c.c. in the store. (3) To make a thicker filling, add a tbsp. or two of plain breadcrumbs, not egg white. (4) Do not overlook the step of adding the finely chopped raw stems to the filling! This gives it more body and a bit of texture, and helps to thicken it up a little. (5) I used a cookie press and a very large star-type tip to fill the caps. Much faster, easier, and nicer looking. (6) I tried something new--After cooking and draining all the 'shrooms ("cup" down in the colander, by the way) I put the drained juice back into the hot pan along with whatever juices were still in the pan from cooking. I lowered the heat and simmered and reduced it until dark and slightly thick, about 5 minutes, stirring constantly. I added 2 tbsp. of butter and the garlic and continued with the recipe. It made them very savory with a concentrated mushroom flavor. Try it both ways and see which you like better! Enjoy!

No complaints here!  I changed a few things to suit my family's taste.  Instead of goat cheese, I used feta and subbed green onions for the white onion.  I also used much less butter when sauteeing the caps.  This is a recipe that I would make for company.

These were a big hit - I was kind of surprised b/c mushrooms are usually not popular in my circle.  But I had to use up some goat cheese so I thought I'd give it a try.  WOW!   Here is what I did: 1. cooked the sauteed the minced onion and stem pieces in a little butter 2. added some fresh spinach (for color) & a clove of garlic 3. let the onions & mushrooms cool 4. them mixed mushroom mixture with mozzarella cheese and goat cheese added some bread crumbs 5. broiled for 10 minutes until golden color 6. I omitted the butter drizzling thing  They went really fast!

I have made these twice now and my boyfriend loves them- he doesn't even like mushrooms! I like to add half a cup of italian breadcrumbs to my stuffing and sprinkle parmesan cheese on top as well. Yummy! :)

I made these for a football party and they were a big hit. Everyone loved them. The recipe made a lot of filling and I used some of the leftover for a dip, but it was better as a stuffing. Also I skipped the last step where you drizzle the garlic butter over everything, because I thought they were buttery enough. Great recipe!

They were a little too "cheesy" for me, but my friend liked them a lot! Like some other reviews, I changed the goat cheese to feta & the onion to green onion. (Although I do love goat cheese!) I also changed the butter to olive oil & used much less. I think the only other thing I might do differently is to maybe up the time under the broiler to 10 minutes--I added 2 more minutes after the 5 minutes & I still thought they needed more time.

Cooked this for Christmas.  I skipped the last drizzle step and instead, sauteed the stems and garlic in the pan after cooking the mushrooms and just added that to the filling.  Plus, I wasn't sure if the recipe called for Neufchatel or cream cheese and since I don't like blue cheeses anyway, I substituted the Neufchatel for fresh mozzarella.  Great!

This recipe is so delicious. My friend always made a mushroom appetizer that I loved, and I have been trying to find a recipe that recreates it. This is it!!!! I took these to a dinner party with friends and they were gone in 5 minutes! I made a few changes by not adding the garlic butter at the end and using finely chopped green onion instead of regular onion. I mixed the garlic into the cheese mixture. SOOO YUMMY!!!

These were very good.  I couldn't find goat cheese so I used blue cheese. I added a little more onion.  They were very tasty.

I've made these on three different occasions now, and every time I'm caught off guard by how delicious they are!  The only change I make is to add minced garlic to the stuffing mixture, but these are scrumptious even without it!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I was looking for a stuffed mushroom that I didnt need breadcrumbs for (low carb) and tried these.  Since I didnt have any goat cheese I used shredded cheddar instead and they were excellent!  I will make these again.  Easy, fast and tasty!

I made two pounds of these, and they were absolutely gone within 10 minutes! They are so delicious, creamy with great flavor.  For sure a new staple with our family, I will be making them for two Christmas functions.

With this recipe, my girlfriend has now announced me the chef of the house - and is "forcing" me, to make this over and over again - and I couldn't agree more - this was amazing, thanks for sharing!

Good, but my family found them WAY too rich. The filling was too creamy as well. I like a stiffer filling in my mushrooms. I will not make this again.

these were great but I found the garlic burned under the broiler, I think next time I'll drizzle it over after I pull them out of the oven.

These were pretty good. I added some chives on the top for color and they looked pretty. After reading the raving reviews I expected a little more. I may make these again.

This is the foundation for a delicious appetizer! The tang of the goat cheese is excellent and mixes wonderfully with the mushroom.  However, in my opinion, there needs to be a little acid and/or crunch to balance the creaminess of all the cheese in this dish.  Otherwise, the richness quickly becomes overwhelming.  So, when made the dish a second time, I increased the amount of onion and added a few finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes to the cheese mixture. I also sauted the mushrooms, onion, garlic and tomatoes for just a few minutes, then I mixed them with the cheeses and a little fresh ground Italian seasoning.  To give the mushrooms a little crunch, I mixed breadcrumbs with some melted butter and topped the stuffed mushrooms.  I cooked the mushrooms as indicated in the original recipe, and everything was done through very nicely.  Delicious!!

The store didn't have Neufchatel so I used tub Philadelphia cream cheese instead. I made it for company, but my husband and I ended up eating most of it - with guilty pleasure. It may have been too high fat for my health-conscious guests. I'd love to make this again, but with less fat calories?

This was an unbelievable appetizer.  I served this at a Valentines Day dinner.  They were a huge hit.  I made almost 10 lbs of mushrooms for 25 people.  They finished these suckers off and still ate all their dinner!

We loved these mushrooms! We probably added more goat cheese than the recipe called for, but we froze the excess. We don't cook with butter, so we sautéed the mushrooms in olive oil and we drizzled olive oil with garlic over them before putting them in the oven. We topped the mushrooms with an aged 4 cheese blend. Definitely will make them again.

I LOVED this recipe and so did everyone I made them for. They taste so wonderful and I can't wait to make them again!! The only thing I did was use cream cheese instead of the Nuefchatel. They tasted amazing and I had to hold people back from taking more than their fare share.
