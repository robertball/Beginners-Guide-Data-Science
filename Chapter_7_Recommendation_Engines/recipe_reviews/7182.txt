I used "soured" milk in this recipe, I made no other changes. Baked at 350*, these were done in just under 20 minutes. These muffins have a scone/biscuit kind of flavor. I split them in half and spread butter, then homemade blackberry jam in the middle. The boys ate almost all of them in one sitting. They loved them.

Good flavor, more biscuit-like than cake-like muffins but still very good.  I would make them again but maybe add flavoring such as almond or lemon extract.

I'm glad I added raspberry jam in the middle and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top when I made this muffin coz it lacks of flavor. You might wanna try adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla essence in the batter.

I have several recipes for variations of Sally Lunn bread. I never thought to make them into muffins. Thanks for the post, these were delicious!

I love these bready-cakey muffins. They are good with jam baked inside and there are so many flavoring possibilities...I will try almond extract next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This is very bland shortcake, even when I added the tablespoon of vanilla and a little extra sugar.  I won't be making this one again.

A deliciously simple recipe. Adding 1 tbsp of vanilla extract adds just the right amount of sweetness to the dough. I added a tbsp of fruit preserves add they turned out perfect and delicious.
