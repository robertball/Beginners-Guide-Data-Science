So far, I tried 2 recipes containing only 'CORN MEAL', and no All purpose flour and I also get the same result. Soft, pudding-like texture, which is nothing like a regular bread. I guess cornbread recipes without 'All Purpose Flour' does not give good results.

Good flavor, but the texture was too much like a corn pudding and not the corn "bread" I was looking for.

I liked this a lot! contrary to the earlier reviews.I guess I just expected it to be the way it turned out.Forgot to add corn, so just sauted it and served it on the side.I am glad this had no cheese cause wasn't in the mood yesterday. Thank you for the recipe.

I added another 1/2 cup of cornmeal and 1 cup of biscuit mix, and it turned out DELICIOUS. otherwise was soupy going into the oven. The next morning, toasted it and served with homemade jelly or honey.Wonderful!
