Just one word - delicious!  I read through all these reviews prior to making these muffins - I thought it would be a novel way to use up our squash!  I baked the squash for an hour, then cooled it.  I used half wheat, half white flour.  And since I doubled the recipe (too much squash), I ended up using 4 cups of squash and doubled everything else.  Since my muffins were bigger, it took between 20 and 25 minutes to finish cooking the muffins.
They're moist and slightly sweet - perfect for me since I'm not a huge fan of really sweet muffins.  I'm not sure what went wrong for the person who wrote the negative review, but I think baking the squash definitely helped, and realize that for 12 muffins, use 1 cup of squash.

I made changes to these muffins just like I would my pumpkin muffins to make them healthier.  Flour: 1 c all purpose, 1/4 c whole wheat and 1/4 c wheat germ.  I don't keep pumpkin pie spice on hand so I did for spices: 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/8 tsp allspice, 1/8 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I also substituted 1/4 cup applesauce for the butter.  It's easier just to make pumpkin muffins, but this gives a nice change.

This turned out awful! I followed the recipe precisely, with no substitutes, and ended up with quite a mess.
I had serious misgivings when the recipe listed a 1/2 pound of cooked squash, but I followed it anyway.
A 1/2 pound is ALOT of squash!! There is no way that you could have weighed the squash.  Did it just LOOK
like a 1/2 pound to you? How about converting it to cups? I used a dietary scale and ended up with so much
of the mixture it looked like I could have baked two or more pies, not muffins!!  I ended up actually doubling the
flour/sugar mixture and adding it to what was leftover and even then I baked 24 muffins.  I wanted to take
them to my parents for a weekend brunch, but there is no way I would serve these to anyone.  I make alot of
recipes that I find on Allrecipes.com, but have never rated them.  This is the first time I have done this because
of how poorly they turned out.  Never again.

Mmmmmmuffins!  Yummy!  My husband, who is not a "weird muffin" kinda guy, devoured three of these after they came out of the oven, and thanked me for the nice change from our typical squash soup recipe.  This is a dense, moist muffin recipe, and the result will disappear quickly from your table!  My 8-month old son also loved them ... they're not too strong tasting, and very healthy.  The tip for 1/2 lb of squash = 1 cup  from one of the reviewers was very helpful - thanks!  I also substituted half of the white flour with whole wheat (which likely contributed to the density of the muffins), and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla.

I made these for Thanksgiving this year, and they are really yummy! The only problem was that they were really doughy... I think maybe if I would have really only filled the cups half full and baked them for about 5 minutes longer they would have been great. Watch out when you're making them though, they may look done but they're probably still really doughy on the inside.

These muffins were a tasty way to use up some baked leftover squash.  I just mashed it instead of pureeing it.  The recipe made 30 mini muffins, which took 12 minutes to bake.

This was a great recipe. My first grade food science students made it. Due to what i had on hand we made a few substitutions. We used acorn instead of butternut squash. also i mixed cinnimon, ginger, and nutmeg instead of pumpkin pie spice. Next time I make it i will bake instead of boil squash. The skins come off easier and you retain a higher nutritional value.

These are a wonderful way to use up leftover baked squash!  Thanks to the reviewer who suggested 1 cup of squash.  I sprinkled some brown sugar on top of a few muffins before baking.  They were good with or without.  I also substituted olive oil for the melted butter with success. I might add a bit of cinnamon or a little more pumpkin pie spice next time because the first bite or two were a little too squashy for me.  Still, a nice addition to my collection of muffin recipes and it was a winner with my kids.

I made these muffins and both myself and my huband loved them. I used nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger instead of a pumpkin pie spice mix. Also, I think I may have had more squash, so the baking time needed to be a bit longer than 20 minutes because they were still mushy inside.
But, I really like these muffins, and I would definitely make them again.

These muffins were delicious! Very moist and flavorful. I roasted my squash and pureed it and used 1 cup of puree and it turned out great!

Only rated 4 stars as it is written but turned out 5 stars with the changes I made. I was looking for something different to do with my leftover butternut squash and decided to give these a try despite some of the mixed reviews of people saying these didn't cook through. I already had the cooked squash and pureed that to make 1 cup. I also added 1/2 tsp. baking soda and 1 tsp. vanilla extract to the mix. I also made the change of doing 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup all purpose and added 1/4 cup brown sugar (for added sweetness) on top of the 1/2 cup white sugar called for. I use silicone muffin liners sprayed with Pam and these popped right out when finished baking. They don't rise very much and they are a dense muffin but they are nicely spiced and you would never know that they are made with squash! By only filling liners 1/2 full they did cook in the amount of time called for, flavors come through more the next day. Will make these again!

These are so good.  They have a cake like consistency and bake up soft and high.  I used a cup of squash that I baked in the oven, but the muffins didn't come out that sweet or squash tasting, very subtle.  The average person probably couldn't guess there is squash in them.  I thought it tasted more like carrot cake.  I mixed in some chocolate chips.  I followed the recipe, except used whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of butter and added some flax. The baking time and temp were perfect, makes 12 large muffins, perfect texture, doesn't really paper baking cups.

VERY yummy. I added 1/4 cup brown sugar because someone said they weren't very sweet.  I also used leftover squash I had baked for dinner the night before and some apple juice for part of the milk.  I was worried about not getting them done in the middle, but when I tested with a toothpick it came out clean. When we ate them warm they seemed doughy, but once cooled they were moist and fully baked.  I will certainly make these again.

I just made these and I think they're awesome!  I followed the proportions almost exactly (I weighed my pre boiled squash, it was 1/2 lb).  I did make one tiny mistake and only use 1/4 cup milk instead of 3/4.  Otherwise, all the same.  I didn't food process my squash, I just drained it, added it to the egg/milk/butter and mashed it with a fork.  I added a crumble topping made form 1/2 oz pecans (9 halves), 3 tbsp brown sugar, 1 1/2 tbsp flour, and 1 tbsp butter.  This was just enough not to add too many calories to each muffin, but gave it that sweet flavor boost.  Also, I think mashing the squash instead of pureeing left more of the squashy flavor intact.  All in all, I think they're awesome this way.  Oh, also, I made 15 instead of 12, which I calculated from my ingredients to mean they're only 100 calories a muffin with 3 grams of fat!  Hooray for muffins!  Oh, and since they were a little smaller, I didn't bake 20 minutes.

Please help! I followed the instructions and I  measured 1 cup of squash for 12 muffins, but the inside of my muffins would not finish baking. The outside was great, but the inside was  very mushy. What did I do wrong?

The flavor was very good, but I wish I'd been able to get a smoother puree.

I added chocolate chips on top. Yum!

However, the muffins stuck to the papers very badly. It seemed like about half of the muffin was permanently adhered to the paper.

(I used a kitchen scale for my muffins, too, and half a pound was about 2 cups of cubes, 3/4 c puree.)

I'm working on a small food budget this week and I used a cup of cooked squash in my freezer that I cooked and froze a month or so ago so this recipe was perfect for me. I used whole wheat white flour, homemade pumpkin pie spice, lowfat buttermilk and at the last minute, I threw in half a bag of Hershey's cinnamon chips that I found in my freezer. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. This came together quickly and used up ingredients I had on hand to come up with snacks/breakfasts for the next couple days which I appreciated......plus they're quite tasty!

These are yummy.

-I used a whole butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cubed, tossed with olive oil and a little salt, and roasted at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes.  This brought out the flavor of the squash better than boiling would.
-I substituted 3/4 c oatmeal for 1/2 c flour for some more nutritional value and bite.
-I added 1T grated ginger to the squash.
-I sprinkled slivered almonds on top before baking.
-I only used cinnamon in the absence of the other spices.

Next time I make these I will:
-make a ginger cream cheese icing (though not a very sweet one)
-spray my muffin cups with baking spray before baking
-think about including raisins and nuts in the batter

I had way too much squash to know what to do with until I stumbled upon this fantastic recipe!! I followed the recipe to a T until the very last second! After I put the batter into the muffin pan, I feared that these muffins would not do anything for me unless I added a sprinkle of brown sugar on top! I'm glad I did!! It gave just a little tiny crunch to every bite and made them a tad bit sweeter! Next time I think I'll add a chopped apple just for fun :-) Thanks for sharing this DELICIOUS recipe!! I look forward to having extra squash the next time!!

Measured 8oz of squash - worked out to be 1/2 of my squash.  Made them as mini-muffins and left out the tbs of butter.  Delicious!

well this was extremely interesting.  First I'd like to say my family LOVED the outcome.  I used coconut milk and almond flour because we are trying to go into the SCD/GAPS diet... anyway it cooked for MUCH longer than 20 min...probably like a little more than an hour... I had the oven on 350 then turned down to 300 for the last 20min.  It just seemed like it would never get bread like (it was still liquidy).  Anyway, the result was still more like a mashed potato consistency.  But I'm telling you my boys and hub ate it quick!  They all loved it and 2 had seconds.  And they did not like the butternut soup I had made yesterday so I was more than surprised.  I will be making this again.

I read the earlier reviews and, based on those, baked the squash for an hour first then used a little over a cup of squash (someone else said a cup equals 1/2 pound). I also wanted to make them a bit healthier so for the flours I did: 1/2 cup all purpose, 1/2 cup whole wheat and 1/2 cup wheat germ). These were yummy and very fresh tasting. My 1 year old loves them!

Yummy! I baked my squash for an hour, scooped out the innards, and pureed it. I used a cup of it for this recipe. I followed the recipe to a T, except for adding a little extra cloves and nutmeg! Oh, and I also added mini chocolate chips! =] I mixed slightly too much the first time and they were kind of tough, but the second time I mixed 'em til just barely moistened and they came out perfect! Will be making these all winter. Thanks for the great recipe!

Tasty!  Great way to use butternut squash from CSA box.  Ended up doing as loaf so it was a little scant in the standard loaf pan, but was fine - just not "tall" in the pan.  Sprayed pan with PAM and baked about 50min instead.  Not too sweet, but nice flavor.  Will try with actual pumpkin pie spice next time... didn't have any so made my own mix.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  Good stuff.

I'm lazy and just used a can of pureed butternut squash so maybe that made a difference but these muffins turned out PERFECT.  I even subbed whole wheat flour for the white flour and the texture was still great.  Love these!  Thank you!

Yum!  These were great!  Similar to pumpkin muffins, but not the same.  As for the reviewer who claimed that a half pound of squash was "a lot," I'm not really sure what happened because a whole butternut squash is only about three pounds anyway.  My only problem with these was that after I took them out of the oven, most of their domes sunk back down.  I'm not sure what happened, so I will have to try it again and see if I can improve them!  Nonetheless, they tasted wonderful.

Made these to use up some butternut puree.  They tasted okay, but were quite sticky.  I couldn't get them to peel out of the papers very well, which might have been my fault.  I just feel like too much was wasted due to the this.

Although these muffins do have a good flavor, there is something wrong with the texture.  No matter how long I baked them, they were "doughy," as other reviewers mentioned.

I used frozen squash instead of fresh which is super easy and tasty! I would add more sugar if u want a sweeter taste. What I like the most about the recipe is that it is not nearly a fattening as most muffins and u would never know :).

I found this recipe to be the best of any other squash muffin recipe I've tried but they still looked a little doughy on the inside but tasted great.  I added 2/3 cups of raisins and a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  Everyone who tried them said they were delicious.

Delicious! Had too much butternut squash to know what to do with and stumbled across this recipe.  I used applesauce instead of butter, and 2 tsp vanilla extract and a healthy sprinkle (or dump) of cinnamon.  I baked in paper cups sprayed with cooking spray, and they stuck somewhat less. Very fluffy, will definitely make again.

Like some other reviewers, I had issues with them sticking to the cupcake liners.  The flavor was okay, but the texture was somewhat tough.  I know better than to overmix muffin batter, so it wasn't that.  I was disappointed and no one is eating them.

A good use for leftover squash after the holiday meal.  I doubled the ingredients and used 4 cups of cubed butternut squash. I didn't have enough flour on hand, so 1 cup was actually flax seed meal...which surprisingly resulted in a pretty tasty muffin!

These are so delicious! My sister thinks it's as good as pumpkin bread, and the little 3 year-old next door can't eat them fast enough! A little time consuming, but next time I'm making a triple batch.

DELICIOUS. 1 cup=1/2 pound butternut squash. Used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, 3/4 all-purpose flour (instead of 1 1/2 cups all-purpose per recipe) and used 1/4 cup applesauce in place of butter. DELICIOUS. Will be making more later in the week. Husband loved them, too!

Pretty good. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used 1c previously baked squash. I also healthified it by adding 1/3c roasted punpkin seeds, 1/3c chopped walnuts and 1/3c rasins. I swapped out 1 cup of white flour for 3/4c whole wheat flour and 1/4c flaxseed meal. I used half the sugar and added 1/3c honey. I MEANT to use oil instead of butter but wound up forgetting to put it in alltogether, although it still turned out pretty well. I think it would have come out of the papers better with the oil though, so next time I'll try not to forget. Like my new recipe? LOL! I love the oops review of the SOUP! HAHAHA!

made these, this morning & they're good but as a personal preference,they need to have more spice to them,but gave them 5 stars,because I'd never have thought to use butternut squash in a muffin.

These were great! I had some butternut squash leftover from Thanksgiving, so I decided to try this recipe, and I'm so glad I did! I followed the directions exactly, but I did drizzle a very easy icing over the tops once they were cool (1 cup of confectioners sugar mixed with 2 tablespoons of milk and 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla). The icing was perfect with them, since the muffins aren't overly sweet. My whole family really enjoyed them! Thanks for a great recipe!

We thoroughly enjoyed the muffins. Ate them all before they had a chance to cool. I went at it this way . . . 8 oz. equals a half pound so I used 1 cup of blended squash and they were just perfect.

Butternut just doesn't stand up to baking. The flavor is totally lost. I made these with half white and half whole wheat flour, as I normally do for muffins and quick breads. The spice was at a good level for a muffin, but that's all they tasted like were spiced muffins. The centers also were still kind of gummy, even though the edges were starting to blacken.

I used the base of this recipe with many reommendations of the reviewers.  Thank you for the 1 cup squash per dozen muffins.  I also added 1/3 cup walnuts to the batter.  I liked how that broke up the texture of the muffin. I also added a crumb topping that made the muffin- it would have gotten less stars without it!  Per dozen muffins: 1/4c flour, 1/4c brown sugar, 2T butter, and I added a few walnuts to the topping as well.  I did use up my frozen suash which was a bonus!

These are really good if you cut them in half, toast, and lightly butter. Then they are better than donuts and way healthier! I made them in paper muffin-cups and they stuck to the paper, so use metal muffin-tins. If you remove the muffins from their papers directly after removing them from the oven, the papers might not stick so much. Good for Thanksgiving dinner, but even more delectable as leftovers!

These are fairly good--however, lacking pumpkin pie spice, I decided to get creative and use cinnamon, nutmeg, a bit of clove, and a bit of allspice. The clove and allspice did not work well in the recipe, but thankfully I didn't put very much in. Learn from my mistake and refrain from attempting to add these spices. These are excellent with a bit of butter.

If this was not a low-fat, relatively healthy muffin, it would be getting a lower rating.  But all things considered, the muffins are very moist and pretty tasty, if a little bland and low-fat tasting.  I wouldn't serve these to anyone, but they're perfect to snack on around the house!

Yummy!! How easy to make! They are very sweet. Mine came out extremely moist-- I think I used closer to 1 lb of squash (twice the amt.). I also did half and half whole wheat flour and all-purpose b/c I love whole wheat recipes. I baked the squash instead of boiling it. My 18-mo-old LOVES them!! He shrieks over them--I'm afraid he's reacting to the sugar. (The most he gets at one time is in graham crackers). I'm looking forward to trying acorn squash next time.

These turned out very moist and delicious. They are a bit dense but that could have been from the couple changes I had to make. I followed the recipe but found out I had 1 1/2 cups squash purée and hoped it wouldn’t ruin the recipe. Then I found out I didn’t have a full teaspoons baking powder-more like 1 1/2 teaspoons. THEN I found out the milk had gone sour a few days shy of it’s expiration date! So I used 1/2 & 1/2. I also only have white whole wheat flour. So, any of those issues could contribute to its densness. But they were still delicious! We had them right out of the oven with melted butter. I will be making them again and hopefully have the right amount of ingredients!

I made these with leftover roasted acorn squash I puréed. I had just under 3/4 cup only, but I went ahead with the recipe as is, except I used brown sugar which  I whisked with the wet ingredients. 
They turned out nicely, not doughy like my regular recipe can be. I think too much squash will do that. I think the directions could be better as to the amount of squash and I also think roasting it will yield a better product.

Toss in 1/4 cup of chocolate chips, that's yummy too!

Update: everyone loves these so much, I have to make them all the time! I use about a cup of leftover squash, which I puree with my hand blender. 

OK one more edit: I have made these with as little as 1/2 cup squash if that's all I have leftover and they still love them.

These were good, even though I forgot to add the butter!  Next time, I will take the advice of another reviewer and add a bit of vanilla and perhaps a handful of raisins to give it a little variety.  I made 6 large muffins and it took 25 minutes for them to be baked through.

I loved them! This was my first time a butternut squash and i ended up with 3 cups of squash and took advice of another review and doubled everything else. I did add about 3 tbs of brown sugar. Cooked for 20 minutes. This made 24 muffins.

This is a good recipe (except for the problem with how the amount of squash is listed--after reading reviews and a few other squash muffin recipes I used 3/4 cup of cooked, pureed acorn squash).  I did tweak it for my family's tastes.  I used Eggbeaters in place of the egg which worked fine.  I also added a chopped Granny Smith apple.  I think it would have been too strong of a squash taste for me without that but I really liked the apple and squash combo. That's a personal preference but if you really like the taste of squash--the recipe is good (nice texture in my opinion). I also used a half and half combination of cinnamon and nutmeg instead of the pumpkin pie spice (just wanted a different spice since we had a pumpkin pie recently).  I made a glaze using apple juice and powdered sugar which was very good with the muffins and will likely entice my child to try them. :) I'm not sure "squash muffins" sounds good even to me....but I needed to use some and this turned out really yummy.

Tasted great!  But were doughy and a little dense, but we still finished them off.  Will keep trying to figure out a way to make them less doughy, maybe mini muffins like someone suggested.

My kids and I loved these muffins! I got a ton of butternut squash from my co-op this fall, cooked and froze it. None of us liked it in the traditional squash soup, so this was a great way to use up our squash and make healthy muffins. I used 1 c. squash and 100% whole wheat flour, and they turned out great. I added raisins to one batch and that was fantastic as well.

The recipe was good but I added brown sugar instead of white, Vanilla extract and applesauce to add moisture. The squash really needs to be blended well because it can be stringy in the muffins. For a added treat add just a few dark chocolate chips to the top, yum!

This was my first time using butternut squash. Not sure how I would like the flavor, this seemed like a fairly safe and easy recipe to undertake.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using a mixture of cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and ginger instead of the pumpkin pie spices.    My Dad ended up loving them! The flavor was fantastic.  The end product didn't turn out quite as I had expected (the muffin got a little firm/tough on the outside).  I will definitely try this recipe again, and try to add more squash (as I think it may have needed it to make it more moist.)   Also, a word to the wise, my squash cooked extremely fast so be sure to keep a close eye on it. And the muffins take a little longer to cook than suggested, so be sure to check them.    Thanks!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I had some roasted butternut squash and just used that instead of the chopping and boiling method.  The muffins are incredibly moist, full of flavor and everyone loves them.  Brought them to my daughters elementary school and they were gone in a flash.  A real child and adult pleaser!

These are very good muffins.  I followed the directions exactly using a little over 1 cup fresh cooked butternut squash.  They are a little gummy as the review say but they are still very flavorful.  I used a mix of paper cups and foil cups.  The foil baking cups did not stick at all.  The paper cups stuck at first but then came off perfectly after they had sat for a day.  I will make these again.

I followed the advice of one of the reviewers and used a cup of squash (because I had a bunch left over in the fridge!).  I got a lot of batter, enough to fill the muffin cups about 3/4th full, but the muffins turned out really nice.  I may have baked them 5 or 10 minutes longer, though, because they really collapsed when I got them out of the oven.  Nevertheless, they were delicious and I love that they use little oil or sugar!

This is an excellent recipe. I used 1 cup butternut squash (frozen cooked squash is quick and easy - just heat it up and mix it in). I used 3/4 c. white flour and 3/4 c. whole wheat graham flour; 1/4 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar. I used the previous suggestion to bake in the metal muffin pan not paper cups. I baked them in a 350 degree oven for about 17 min. They turned out beautiful: lightly browned and a little crisp on the bottom outside and nice and light and fluffy on the inside. Great texture. Will definitely make these again.

DO NOT USE PAPER CUPS!  So I made this exactly to the recipe (except for the cups..oops) and they didn't turn out very good. They were not very sweet and were doughy in the middle.. So I modified my second batch and added a little more sugar (maybe about 1/4 cup) and about 1/4 teaspoon baking soda to make them more fluffy. I also used a greased pan instead :-)  Much better the second go-around.  I will probably look for a different recipe the next time I want butternut muffins. Thanks!

Good muffin! Made a half batch to go with the southwest beef stew & apple cider that my bf and I had for dinner. I liked the muffins more than the stew : ) My bf didn't care for these, but he doesn't like muffins very much (or squash, pumpkin, etc.). Well, at least he tried one.... I had no problems with my muffins being "mushy" and they stuck just a little to my greased muffin liners. I baked a peeled butternut squash (cut in half lengthwise, seeds and fibers removed) in the microwave for about 4 min. cut side down, then 5.5 min. turned over. Mashed with a fork and added a 1/2 c. to the batter. Because I had some egg substitute I needed to use up, I ended up subbing 1/8 c (= to 1/2 large egg) for the egg called for. Perfect!!! I can't wait to have the two remaining muffins (slathered with butter of course!) for breakfast! Thanks for sharing. I LOVE fall foods :)

I was very excited about this recipe.  What a let down.  First, a 1/2 Lb isn't very clear because it's the amount you get out of it when your done & I'm sure it varies depending on the cook & the squash.  Second, this made 24 servings.  Third, the batter was like soup.  Fourth,  even cooking 10 min. longer than the first 12, the muffins are super sticky & don't have a nice done fluffy finish, they are heavy & wet.  Fifth,  they have hardly any flavor to speak of! I was expecting a spicy Fall muffin.  The only nice thing was my house smelled wonderful!  Go figure!

This was my first experience ever with butternut squash.  These were much better than I expected.  They had the taste and, somewhat, the texture of pumpkin pie.  I made a crumble topping using brown sugar, butter and flour and it really added some nice flavor.

Myself, my husband and the 3 kids all enjoyed these muffins.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I felt they could use a little more flavor.  I will definitely try adding more next time I bake them.  I love that they are low in fat and calories, too!

I've made almost the exact recipe before and it's really excellent! You can mix some light brown sugar, margarine, and crushed pecans, and place it on top of the muffin before baking. It's delicious!

I wouldn't say "filled with flavor" exactly, as they were a little bland.  But a good way to sneak squash into a different kind of dish.  We baked our squash like other reviewers recommended.

Very good. I prefer a slightly richer muffin, but I suppose it's healthier without too much fat. Also, I found the squash flavor to be subtle and I may put in a little extra next time to make it "squash-ier". This recipe would be good with pumpkin too. To the reviewer who thought the recipe calls for too much squash: 1/2 lb is only 1 cup which shouldn't be too much..?

I did make changes base upon my research and didn't boil the squash but baked it for an hour at 400 deg.  I wished I had used more spices  though.  They were ok when I ate them hot but seemed to taste better cold. Alot of my muffins stuck to the paper.   Thank you to the reviewer who confirmed how much squash to use in cups vs pounds and who confirmed baking the squash vs boiling.

Horrible! I made several dozen and not one was presentable for the event I made them for, a graduation. A waste of good ingredients. I have never had a recipe turn out so bad. It seems it does not have enough oil/butter. The outside gets hard and sticks to the liners, the inside never gets cooked. Awful.

Only small changes: vegetable oil instead of butter, only 3/4 cup of honey nut squash - leftover from dinner, and a bit more sugar. These rose beautifully, rolled easily out of muffin "tin" (I used ceramic 6-muffin one, lightly greased) and were unbelievably delicious. Will add some cut up apple next time. We love them!

These taste great.  Easy to make.  I also used the recipe for pumpkin pie spice.  Very good.

I made this exactly per the recipe except using canned pumpkin instead of squash, using  8 oz (= 1/2 lb.). It was awful - wet, sticky even though it was cooked.  It stuck horribly to the muffin paper wrapper.  It was so bad that it is the only baked item I've ever made that no one in the house would eat, and we threw out all the remaining muffins.

I tried this recipe and will not try it again. 1/2 lb. os squash is very difficult to measure and I tried to weigh it but was unable to do it. As a result there was too much liquid.

I made these just as the recipe called for, using another user suggestion of 1 cup squash for a half pound. I also didn’t have pumpkin pie spice, so I used cinnamon and ginger but next time I’ll try to at least have nutmeg on hand also. I also did a double batch since I had so much squash. I thought they came out great! The first batch was a bit dry, but I was attending to my toddler when the timer went off, so I think that’s why. The second batch I did mini muffins for 12 minutes and they were perfect. I also took another users suggestion and put a bit of brown sugar on top, which I thought was a really nice touch. I’ll definitely be making these again.

This recipe uses white sugar, milk and all-purpose flour, all of which I no longer use.  Instead I use alternative sweeteners (depending on the main ingredients), non-dairy milk and various gluten-free flours, so to use this recipe I would have to make too many adjustments.  I'm happy for anyone who doesn't need to make these types of substitutions, though.

The flavor was fantastic and the texture was soft but not mushy like some muffins made with pumpkin can be.  I used my own mixture of pumpkin pie spice--allspice, cinnamon, clove, ginger and nutmeg, rather than the premixed kind. I would recommend that the recipe be updated to include a conversion for the squash measure from (raw) pounds to (cooked) ounces/cups.

Maybe I didn't puree the squash enough, because muffins were very dense and tough.  Flavorful, though.

They are so good. Wasn’t sure if I make again cause of all the prep work of the squash, cutting in half, and peeling not fun but they were so worth it.

Very Very tasty but because the ratings were 4 I modified at the suggestion of several reviewers which made it 5 stars.  I did bake cubed squash drizzled with a little olive oil and let it cool before making.  I also used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  I replaced 1 of the teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice with fresh grated nutmeg, a pinch of cloves and a pinch of cardamom, I added chopped pecans and chopped candied ginger and sprinkled a small amount of sparking sugar on top.

I made the following substitutions:  1/3 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 c. white sugar.  Measured 1 cup cooked butternut squash and baked in mini cupcake tin (baked only about 20 minutes).  Turned out great.

This recipe was very easy and delicious.  I’m not a fan of muffins but these were very moist and flavorful.  I followed the recipe as is.  The only change was the oven I put it on 400 degrees convection.  I baked them for 15 minutes turned off the oven and let them rest in the oven for the next 5 minutes.  I will definitely make them again.

Followed reviewers recs and added 1 tsp vanilla to the recipe. Came out good, but next time I'll cook additional 5 minutes. Used large muffin pan so got 6 muffins filled 3/4. Good taste and not too mushy in the middle. Will definitely make again as it's a good recipe for leftover squash.

These are delicious!  They have an excellent, soft texture, and a wonderful flavor.  This is a great way to get butternut squash into a meal that no one could possibly object to!  (I substituted whole wheat flour for some of the white flour, which made them even more nutritious, and the WW flour wasn't noticeable at all)

These are excellent as written. Only changes I made was I baked the squash whole and once it was cool scooped out about 1 cup for the recipe. I also used brown sugar instead of white, and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup white flour. Great recipe with not too much sugar, which I appreciate.

I'd definitely make these again. I'm always looking for ways to incorporate (sneak) healthy veggies into foods for a teenager with autism who won't touch a single vegetable. These baked up nicely, and they were tasty and a hit with the unsuspecting boy. 

I made some changes based upon previous reviews: I roasted the squash for an hour in the oven then scraped out 1 cup of the soft squash and mashed it by hand (Thanks to the reviewer who said 1/2 pound = 1 cup! Very helpful). I used 1 cup of white flour and 1/2 cup of wheat flour (the consistency was a little denser as a result).  I used half white sugar and half brown sugar; I added one teaspoon of vanilla; and I used apple pie spice instead of pumpkin pie spice because it's what I had on hand. And I added 1/4 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips to up the yummy factor and ensure they'd be eaten. :) 

I love silicone baking cups, but mine are slightly smaller than 12-cup muffin tins, so it made 20 muffins filled 3/4 full. Baking time was 15 minutes as a result. 

Thanks for a yummy recipe!

These muffins turned out really well with a few adjustments. Thanks to the person who recommended using less than 2cups of butternut squash! I used 1.5 cups squash and I still ended up not pouring all the liquids into the flour mixture before pouring into the muffin cups. If I had used all the liquid it would have made the batter way too watery. I also used walnuts which was a great contrast to the sweet squash. Great way to use up extra butternut squash!

Most of my family does not care for squash, but we were looking for a way to use some squash that was given to us.  We did not have butternut squash, but we tried this recipe with a couple kinds mixed together.  Everybody loved the muffins.  When we added chocolate chips, they liked them even more.

I made this twice. The first time, I admit I eyeballed the cooked squash because I had already cooked it. Would have been useful if the author had also included the amount of cooked squash. The inside basically never cooked. The second time, I used 1 cup cooked squash as per the other reviewers tips, and although it cooked through and the taste was good, I had to cook it almost double the time to get the insides cooked. So the outsides were really hard and brown. I'll eat these myself warmed up but wouldn't serve to guests and it's not a recipe I would trust to work every time.

This was great! I had enough butternut squash left over that I wanted a different  recipe for. This one tasted very good, easy to make, simple and with everyday items that I already had. The only change I made was to substute coconut oit for the butter and it worked perfectly.

I followed all the instructions exactly as specified and this turned out horribly. The ratio of wet to dry ingredients was way off, so the muffins came out like hockey pucks on top and still raw in the middle. After 30+ minutes in the oven, I had to take them out, and the toothpicks never came out clean. So disappointed I wasted a half pound of perfectly good butternut squash on this recipe. Will never make this again.

I am still a fan of the recipe but wanted to try to make them a little more moist.  This time I added 1/2 cup chunky applesauce & a sprinkling of dried berries.  They were much better with these additions.

These are really good and seem pretty healthy. I had some leftover baked squash that I used (about 3/4 of a squash) and just mashed it in with everything else. I followed the recipe exactly except added a teaspoon of vanilla and a diced green apple. I think it would be good without the apple too; I might add some more nuts than are called for next time because I like the crunch. This recipe made 25 muffins for me.

A bit disappointing. They taste good... but I don't like the texture. They're heavy and dry. And they stick to the muffin liners. I think 400F is too high. I cooked a pound of squash (I doubled the recipe) in a steamer so the puree was not too much liquid. I should have double the amount of butter and cut down on the milk. I added a spoon of honey and one cup of nuts. 
Next time for a 9'' bread form, I'll rather start with 3 spoons of butter + 2 eggs + 1c sugar. Then add squash puree(500g uncooked) and nuts and honey. And alternately add mixed dry ingredients and 1 cup of milk. Bake at 350°c for 50 minutes.

I thought these were really good!  I substituted whole wheat flour for white (to make them a bit healthier) and brown sugar for the white (just my preference).  I had to use 1/4 cup of the milk while pureeing the squash (I just added the remaining 1/2 cup to the mixture when it called for it).  The muffins turned out really good, and are not overly sweet.  I frosted them with some homemade cream cheese frosting to make cupcakes for my daughter's kindergarten class.  I hope they all like them, so I can tell them afterward that they were made with a vegetable!!! :)

I tried this recipe.  Only one reviewer talked about the doughy turn out of muffins.  I ended up baking them about 45 minutes and muffin insides stayed like the inside of a churro but a little more moist.

The flavors are good, I'd make it again but without the milk.  I used mashed squash, and it was plenty moist without using the milk or only 1/4 cup milk.  3/4 is TOO MUCH. 

I realized cooking with butternut squash is very much like cooking with sweet potatoes, you really don't need any additional liquids, the vegetable alone is fine.

Pretty good.  The current ingredients need to be doubled and use 4 cups squash (whole butternut).  I did half brown & half white sugar and added extra nutmeg.  This would also taste yummy as a dessert with cream cheese frosting, or plain with chocolate chips and/or nuts.

I totally veganized this recipe....and I had started making it when I began ro read reviews and then promptly doubled my recipe when I realized that the whole butternut squash I had boiling was gonna be way too much for the recipe as is, I also added some vanilla extract, used vanilla flavored almond milk, cornstarch to replace eggs, and unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil or was it butter that the recipe called for...anyway baked them for about twenty five minutes or so on 400 degrees and some of them were still a little mushy and chewy on the inside, even though I had tested and they seemed done. 

I made a dozen and a half and still have alot of batter left over, to it I will add a little more sugar and a little more pumpkin pie spice and I don't have any on hand right now but in the future I will use a little butter flavor extract along with the vanilla extract....they are okay, but there is just a little bit of ummph!!! Missing. 

But I will make again for sure, I think it's worth it to get it just right.

These are a great comfort food straight out of the oven. My husband doesn't care for squash soup so I used up the leftovers this way. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice, plus about 1/4 cup of lowfat sour cream to keep them moist. This added about 5 minutes to the baking time, but they ended up very tasty.

I made these twice, because I really wanted them to work, but both times they were  spongy and gluey in the center.  The flavor is wonderful, enough so you want to eat them even tho the texture is not right.  I weighed and measured very carefully the second time so I don't knowwhat went wrong.

These came out really good, but doughy in the center even after I baked them for a few extra minutes. They're just the right amount of sweetness and adding some extra cinnamon makes them even better.

Awesome! My husband doesn't even like squash and he loves these! Next time I have to take muffins somewhere, I am going to make these. I may try them with pumpkin instead of squash though just because my husband loves pumpkin so much. Thanks for posting this!!

Great and creative way to use up extra squash!! I did use 1 cup whole wheat and 1/2 cup AP flour and about 1/4 cup white sugar.  Since I had a lot of squash, I had closer to 1 1/4 cups.  Went great with my veggie soup, but the true sign of approval came from my picky-eater friend who had 3 of these!

I thought the flavor of these was great. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I used the combination of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, allspice and clove that another reviewer suggested and that worked well. I replaced the sugar with agave syrup and the flour with almond flour. Taste wise, that worked well, but the middle stayed a little mushy. I'll try that combo again, and tweak the amounts. Oh, I also decreased the oven temp a little and baked longer so that they wouldn't burn with the changes I made. Will definitely try again- really tasty.

I always spray the INSIDE of my paper muffin liners before putting the batter in them. Since I started doing this I have never had a problem with the muffin sticking to the liner. These have decent flavour, but they are quite gummy in the center, even though they are baked through. If I make again I will try using whole wheat flour since it makes things drier.

These are such a nice treat!  I wanted to use up some a squash that has been sitting around taunting and remembered squash muffins my mom used to make.  My mom would be proud.  I followed the recipe for the muffins and added cinnamon sugar and chopped walnuts on top before cooking.  I will make these again!

I think I did something wrong. First I doubled the recipe and I definately cooked them too long. The muffins were very compact and doughy. However, I gave this recipe 3 stars because even though they were doughy they had a really good flavor. I will probably try this recipe again just to make sure I didn't screw it up.

I just made these muffins and found out they do have a tendency to be a litle too moist inside and you need to bake them a little longer.  BUT I tried using my mimi muffin pans and they worked out great.  Baked them for 20 minutes and totally done. They are bite sized, if the bigger ones are just a little too much. My husband even thought they would be better smaller.  If you really like them, then you can have two or 3. They are great a great size for the kids too. I added raisins to mine and a teaspoon of nutmeg to give it a little zing!

Very good recipe. I have to admit to eyeballing the amount of squash, used about one and three quarter cup of squash, slightly less sugar than asked for and added a banana to sweeten the deal. Also didn't have pumpkin spice but added clove, nutmeg, allspice and cinnamon, all in varying amounts. I don't tend to stick to recipes and at the moment couldn't find measuring spoon so eyeballed all of it. Muffins were moist and outside of wanting to add a little texture was pleased.

I used left over acorn squash. This was a GREAT and delicious recipe with a little change added. I used 1/2c sugar and 1/4c of brown sugar, added 1/4t of baking soda. I did not have the spices available, so I used Chinese 5-Spice. Lo n' behold, IT WORKED! I had baked the muffins at 375 degrees for 30 minutes. This is not a light and fluffy muffin. It is mushy on the inside when it comes right out of the oven, but when it cools it becomes dense and regular type muffin inside. When I make and have left over squash, I will make this again.

My kids *love* these muffins!  I use 1 cup of squash per 12 muffins and carefully monitor cooking time.  I needed to add 5 minutes for my oven.  I always test with a toothpick.  The first batch was gummy but then I adjusted the cooking time and voila! perfection!

This recipe is excellent! I have a new love for squash! I also left half of the muffins plain, while the others I made a homemade cream cheese frosting. Yummy!

These are fantastic!!  I had half a roasted butternut squash sitting in my fridge for a week and I wanted to use it before it went bad, so I made these, and I'm so glad I did.  They are delicious!  Moist and flavorful.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used a heaping 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves, 1/2 teaspoon allspice, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.   I will be making these alot this winter!

These were tasty but didn't turn out exactly as I thought. They were nice and brown on the outside by gummy and dense on the inside which made them seem kinda uncooked in the middle. I'm not much of a baker but I *think* I followed the recipe to the letter. This recipe is worth a try if you have Butternut Squash hanging around that needs to be used up.

This recipe didn't work out for me either, I had a full pound of squash guts from jack o'lanterns, not so much cubed flesh, but calculated the necessary conversions.  The result turned out too moist, dense and stuck to muffin cup papers.  A bit too bitter too, in my opinion.  Possibly trouble with the amount of squash and/or baking times.

I took another reviewers advice and used applesauce instead of butter. I should have stuck with the butter. It only calls for 1 tbs anyways. The taste was just ok though. I think a topping would help.

My whole family liked these muffins. I used one reviewer's suggestion and added some nuts (toasted pecans) and a pinch of brown sugar. Thanks for a new way to use up our butternut squash this year!

I used 1 cup of squash, and since I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, I used cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, and allspice, as other reviewers mentioned.  Very good!  The kids loved them, too.
