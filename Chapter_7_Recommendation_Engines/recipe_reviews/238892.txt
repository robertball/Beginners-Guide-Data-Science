I followed the recipe exactly and it was really, really good.  The components taste great, very complimentary to each other.

Very nice!  Lovely on the plate with the different colours. The sweet of the squash and the salty of the bacon was a really great combo.  I used half the brown sugar and it was sweet enough for us.  I also steamed chopped onions with the squash rather than using onion powder. Chops are a bit tough when pan-fried. I may try the same concept but using pork roast done in the slow cooker, or maybe even using pan-fried duck breast with balsamic vinaigrette glaze for the meat on the bottom. Thank you for this great recipe.

I cooked the parsley with the pork instead of with the bacon. I cooked the pork until it was cooked through and then some, but there was still quite a bit of liquid in the pan. I baked the butternut squash rather than boiled -- a million times easier to cut, peel and mash! All in all, it was really good. I wish I had salted the pork prior to cooking, and next time, I will cook the pork in the bacon grease or clarified butter instead of plain veggie oil. The different flavors really blended surprisingly well.

I didn't have white wine so substituted beef broth. Fantastic blend of flavours. Everyone gave it rave reviews. This will definitely be a repeat recipe in our household.
