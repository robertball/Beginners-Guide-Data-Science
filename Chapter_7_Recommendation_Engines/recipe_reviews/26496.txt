This was delicious.  It was almost like having pumpkin pie.  Friends and family have asked me for this recipe because they loved it so much.

I added a shake or two more of cinnamon than the recipe called for. Instead of doing on the stove, I brought to boil and put in a crock pot on high for 4 hours. Worked wonderfully.

Not too sweet (which some may dislike).  Simple to make, and pumpkin lovers will enjoy it.

If you use the standard 
"halloween" pumpkin, use LOTS of spice! It's pretty bland....

I did not have very good luck with this recipe.  I thought the apple overpowered the pumpkin.  I kept adding spices and pumpkin until it didn't taste as much like applesauce.  If I attempt pumpkin butter again, I will try a recipe that doesn't call for as much applesause/apple juice.

What made this recipe different from the others was the use of BROWN sugar instead of white.  I did it in a slow cooker on low overnight.  So good.

Great recipe. I had about 2.5 cups of fresh "pie pumpkin" and used that with the applesauce.  I liked it a little more pumpkin-y than the original recipe.  The other change I made was that I did not add the spice.  My son has some food allergies and the pumpkin butter was for him.  We used the final product in smoothies, on toast, and in pumpkin muffins.

This turned out very good - but wish it was a little more pumpkin tasting -- I agree with the apple taste overpowering the pumpkin -- I doubled the entire recipe -but only added 3/4 C of Apple Juice and 3/4 C water -and extra pumpkin pie spice.  Next time I will substitue all of the apple juice with water -- WARNING - watch out -- this stuff "erupts" like Mt. Vesuvius -even when on the lowest my stove's burner will go! - it is like it is sending hot pumpkin lava into the air one burp at a time -- I think I will try the crock pot method next time! - Can't wait to serve it on our Christmas Brunch buffet!

This is an easy and delicious recipe.  I agreed with Cindy that the apple taste was a bit overpowering; the second time I made it I used water instead of apple juice.  This minor change allowed the pumpkin flavor to shine a little brighter!

Delicious! I used freshly roasted pumpkin, 2 cups of it pureed in the food processor.  According to other reviews I used water instead of apple juice.  I also used 1/2t cinnamon and 1/4t nutmeg instead of pumpkin pie spice.

Great Recipe!  I love this stuff and put it on everything, toast, bread, waffles, crackers... Next time I think I'll cut out the apple juice and cut down the brown sugar to save a few calories.

As others said, a little too much apple flavor. Also, cooking it in a crock pot would prevent the splattering all over my stove top.

I wish I'd read the review about the slow cooker earlier! That is a great idea! I used fresh pumpkin puree but still had some bigger chunks. I used my immersion blender to eliminate remaining chunks of pumpkin. Yummy recipe!

My teenage daughters love this with pie crust cookies. Simply brush  pie crust cutouts with honey butter and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.

Used food processor as my cream cheese had been frozen, broke it up real good, very creamy.  This could be adapted for a fat free cream cheese and use splenda and serve with apple slices.
