Incredibly bland!
It's been simmering for two hours now, and tastes like... well, tomatoes! Gonna have to try to rescue the pork by spicing the whole thing up as best I know how...

I seared the pork first and added half the tomatoes and added diced potatoes and spring onions and fresh baby spinach the last few minutes of cooking. Delicious.

This soup was delicious!  I made it with my daughter and since I have an onion allergy, I substituted some basil and sage and a dash of crushed red pepper for the onion.  Yum!

More tasty tips... used 'Alymers Accents' canned tomatoes - one was Italian seasoned and one was chili seasoned. Threw in my leftover roasted potatoes & added frozen corn (husband asked for even more corn to be added) - lots of flavor!
