This is very good. I usually cut the ingredients in half and make it in a 7" spring form. Bake at 325 for 45 minutes. I've also done this in a prepared oreo crust when I'm pressed for time. Always a crowd pleaser.

Sooo good! Definitely a keeper.  I recommend using non-stick spray on the foil and not letting the melted chocolate cool too much... it became a little too gooey to swirl.

It was ok and can be improved.  I found the sides abit on the dry side while the centre is creamier.  Maybe adding 1-2 tsp of milk or baking it bain-marie will help improve the texture on the sides.  Flavour was good.  Thank you.

Okay, so I botched this one and changed this one, but it still turned out to be one the creamiest cheesecakes we have ever had.  I tried to make this from memory, having looked at the recipe this morning.  After making it and not remembering how long I was supposed to bake it, I reviewed the recipe to find that I had left out the sour cream.  I also had divided the batter in 1/2 and added the chocolate to one portion.  I made a gluten free crust using Rice Chex, cocoa powder, sugar and butter.  That actually turned out quite well, held together wonderfully, and everyone really liked it.  I had a hard time swirling the batters, probably because I had the same amount of both, so it turned out more like a layered chocolate vanilla cheesecake.  Overall, no one cared about the looks and it was a wonderful dessert tonight topped with whipped cream and chocolate syrup!

Wow. I made this cheesecake in a springform pan, and it was a bit too much batter - I should've cut it back a bit. But it tasted phenomenal.

I was sorta unsure about making this recipe becuase my dad was bugging me about making him a cheesecake and right when i started making it he told me he didnt like cheesecake you had to bake, but i finished it anyways and he loved it! im not a fan of cheesecake but i took a small bite and it was rich, creamy, and wonderful! i would not change a thing and my dad already told me that i would be making this again :)

This turned out really well... I was a bit wary of the temperature, because most cheesecakes I've made are baked at 275 or 300, but it worked. The batter itself is very tasty, and the "plain" version (before the melted chocolate goes in) would no doubt taste great in a graham crust. Great recipe to play around with!

This was the best cheesecake ever! As much as I love cakes and cookies cheesecake is NOT my thing. In could not stop eating this one! I made this for my BF's birthday who is a cheesecake freak, and this was my first cheesecake ever to make and wow nelly! He said this may be better than his step moms cheesecake! Now you got to understand, when I cook, he will run to a fast food place to eat first so he can be sure he is not hungry after he "eats" my cooking lol so if I can make this cake! Anyone can! The only thing is 20 oreo cookies were not enough to line the 9x13 cake pan so I had to use the full pack of cookies and 6 tablespoons of i cant believe its not butter. So glad this was 9x13 and not the small cheesecake size because this was so good! It came to about $30 for me to make.

The cheesecake was very chocolaty and when you make the crust 1 package was not enough for a 13x9 pan .When you cut it take the tin foil and flatten the tin foil out so it is flat . I was best cheesecake I ever made it was awesome.

This is a 5 star cheesecake, but it does fail to mention one important step. I've made this twice already and the taste is awesome.  The first time I made this was for Thanksgiving and everybody said that it needed to be made for our Christmas party, which is tomorrow.  The first time I made this I had put it in a larger baking pan with water when baking and it came out perfect.  This time I forgot to do this and it cracked.  I'm kicking myself, but I'm thankful that the taste is great and I'm just going to cut it into bite size, so the cracks aren't that noticeable.  Remember to bake it bain marie and you'll absolutely love this.

AWESOME! I have tried many different cheesecake recipes and this is the first one that has ever came out tasting just like the best restaurant cheesecakes. Perfect consistency and texture. Sooo good! I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't like my 13x9 clear glass pan with foil, I just sprayed it with Pam. I also didn't use Bakers square chocolate, I used chocolate chips the equivalent was 18 tablespoons of chips and I melted them in the microwave. I first baked it for 35 minutes and it needed the extra 5 minutes.

Every time I make this I have people who talk to me about buying cheesecakes from me.  Everyone states this is better than Cheesecake Factory or other high end bakeries.  
One time I switched up the cup full of batter and put chocolate in that and then kept the rest in normal form.  If you do that make sure you use 2-3 squares of chocolate (I also did a 1 1/2 cup batter) so that you have the chocolate taste you want.

Are these the 1 ounce squares of chocolate or the newer 1/4 oz square? Is it the 3 oz packages of cream cheese or the 8 oz packages?

This is the first baked cheesecake I made, and it was a full success. The foil in the pan worked wonderfully, which was a relief. The only thing I changed was to make a half recipe (just in case it was a flop, it'll be full size next time!), and I wanted most of it plain with the swirl of chocolate- so the melted chocolate went in the reserved 1 cup of batter instead. It seemed like it took forever to bake, even half-sized, and I was unsure when to take it out, but apparently I got it just right. Just when it stops being jiggly except a bit in the very middle. Great cheesecake, thanks!

I'm a huge fan of cheesecake, especially chocolate, and I love how this turned out. My only issue was not finding 20 Oreos enough to cover the whole pan. I used an entire package! I also added two extra squares of chocolate to the batter. I'm undecided as to whether or not I'll pre-bake the crust again. Other than that, I thought this was excellent!

First time making it and it turned out beautifully. Slightly dry at the sides though. Mayne just a dash more of milk will do the trick.

Added extra chocolate (nearly double the recipe's amount), a little bit of dutch cocoa powder, baked bain-marie for about 30 min (used two 8x8 square tins) > let it cool in closed oven for 1 hour > propped open oven with wooden spoon for another hour > removed from water > removed tinfoil > wrapped cake pan with clingfilm > refrigerated 2 hours.

First time baking a cheesecake and already friends are asking if I'm willing to bake and sell! Thanks for the recipe!

My husband requested a chocolate swirl cheesecake for his birthday so I made this. Everyone loved it but me. I think I just don't care for chocolate cheesecake. To me, the chocolate covers up all the delicious cheesiness! But, it was for my husband and he thought it was wonderful.

I made this for the first time a couple of years ago.  It was definitely a hit, even those who were not cheesecake lovers, ate it and were very impressed with my culinary skills.  It is now a yearly request for every family and friends get together.

I've been making this easy cheesecake for my daughters' high school club pitch ins and family dinners for over a decade.  It's perfect to make the day before. I will say I do not foil line as I tend to serve from the pan. Also, I do not use margarine, only real butter.  Aside from those two things, I follow directions as written and have had nothing but great results.

This cheesecake looked awesome and tasted way below average.  I made it for my staff and only 1 out of 10 liked it.  I would not even serve the extras to other co-worker as to spare my reputation the embarrassment of saying I made this!  
I'll never make this again.

Cut the recipe in half and used a 7 inch spring pan, added some fresh strawberries. Did not have semi sweet chocolate, used 4 squares of bakers dark chocolate and turned out great. Great reviews from the table, will definitely do this one again.

Very good cheesecake! I have made it several times now and I always half all the filling ingredients and bake it in a 9" pie pan with a graham cracker crust. (I could just as easily use chocolate wafers or vanilla wafers for the crust and it would be equally delicious! I just happen to love graham cracker crusts with my cheesecake.)

I should also note that I do not do a bain marie with this recipe  (though it would not hurt to do so). I just find that it is not really necessary.

This is  a great recipe. It's creamy and delicious.  My daughter also had made it many times . We love putting mini chocolate chips on top.

My family loves this cheesecake with mocha icing ( whipped cream with  a tad bit of instant coffee) its delicious!!  I usually have to leave it in at least 10 minutes longer than recipe calls for.
