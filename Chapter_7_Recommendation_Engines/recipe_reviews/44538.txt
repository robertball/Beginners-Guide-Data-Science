Because I coupon, I always have refrigerated biscuits on hand. This was an excellent way to use them! I made only two small changes--instead of jalapeno peppers and roasted green chili peppers (because I do not have either), I used one 4 oz. can mild diced chilies. I just wisked it into the eggs before I added them to the skillet. I also sauteed a mess of fresh minced garlic in with the onion. The boys loved this. NOTE: What I did to make the eggs a little easier to handle inside the biscuits, I basically cooked the eggs into a thick.......circle? Think omelette but not folded. Once it got firm, I turned it and cooked the other side, sprinkling the cheese over the top. This way, I just had to slide it from the skillet, cool it a bit, then cut it into triangles with a pizza cutter. Wa-la, egg that won't fall out of your biscuit!

Very good. Better way is to place filling into a tortilla and add some salsa and/or chopped tomatoes. The little can of chopped green chili peppers, drained, works well. You can also sub petite diced ham for the bacon. I use butter instead of olive oil. MMMmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!

Delicious!! I saw this recipe and made it without making a trip to the store. I cut down the fat grams by making my own biscuits with lower fat Bisquick and used turkey bacon. I used Pam spray olive oil and omitted the jalepenos. I used the canned diced green chilies, as was also suggested.

I put this concoction in a flour tortilla, rolled up like a Chimichangas and grilled it on the griddle to melt the cheese.  It was so good.  Hubby dipped his in salsa.

I made this on Christmas morning for my fiance.  I didn't have bacon on hand, so I used cooked crumbled sausage; I also couldn't find extra large biscuit dough, so I bought a container of regular Pillsbury biscuit dough.  After sauteeing the vegetables, I added the cooked sausage to the pan before pouring the eggs; the end result was a nicely set scrambled egg mixture that had just the right amount of kick.  These made great mini sandwiches! Will make again.

This was pretty good, when made using other reviewers advice.  Guess what? In case you are confused, bacon is NOT ham! Same animal, different cut.

You'll have "death breath" for days, but it's worth it.  Used veggie bacon instead of the real thing.

A friend of mine that I use to work with, His wife made this for his lunch and she always made extra for us gringos. She used flour tortillas and also added diced potatoes.  I can still taste them today and everytime I go visit them in Arizonia I still request that Mary makes them for me.

I used homemade biscuits since I didn't have any canned. I also crumbled the bacon into the eggs while scrambling and used fresh roasted chilis in them rather than putting it on top. Only cheese I had on hand was cheddar so thats what I used. These are super good and nice hearty breakfast.

Please disregard that last review. It was for another recipe. My bad! This one is great, especially for a Dr. Suess party food.

This worked out beautifully for brunch today.  A friend won't eat unless it's spicy and this suited him just fine.  Filling, delicious, and not difficult to prepare.
