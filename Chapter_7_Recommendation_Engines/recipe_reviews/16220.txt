This was great, extremely delicious. As per earlier reviews I dipped the chicken into egg before coating with the flour mixture.  Reminds me somewhat of Chicken Francaise, but with much more flavor.  Definitely a keeper recipie. A+

This recipe ROCKS!  The first time that I made it, I followed the directions completely and it was SUPREME!  Then the second time I made it, I made some changes...

I added:

1.  A large basket of sliced fresh mushrooms and added it to the broth mixture BEFORE pouring it over the chicken (tastes good if you let the mushrooms soak in the broth mixture for about 30 minutes)
2.  I scraped out the remaining pulp from the lemon that I juiced and added it to the broth mixture.
3.  I added 2 tablespoons of Lemon Pepper to the broth mixture
4.  I dipped the chicken in 2 raw eggs (beaten) before dipping the chicken in the flour mixture

OMG!!! This was wonderful! I was so impressed that I could make something so easy, taste and look so elegant! I can't wait to make for guests! Per other reviewers, added 1 1/2 TBLS of lemon pepper seasoning to the broth/soup mix, only used 3/4 cup flour and 6 chicken breasts (first dipped in an egg and butter mixture before dipping into flour so it would stick to chicken better).  I served over rice (Uncle Ben's chicken and wild rice) and spooned the excees "sauce" over all.  Absolutley devine! The praise I received for making this dish made me blush.  Thanks Valerie for sharing this one!

10 star recipe.  The best of the best.  I make this for company all the time and people go crazy over it.  

Some changes when I make it- all optional obviously:

1. after I dip the chicken in flour and begin to saute it, I then dip it back in the flour mixure-otherwise the "breading" is minimal and there is a lot of flour and herbs left over.

2. Never/rarely have fresh lemon (please!) so I just throw in lemon juice- prob 1/4 to 1/3 cup.  

3. Never used the capers or lemon zest.

4. ALWAYS pound the chicken to within a centimeter of its life.  Its so tender- amazing.

5. I use whatever in terms of the soup, mushroom, chicken, chicken and garlic, full fat, reduced fat, etc.  Doesnt seem to make any difference to me.

6. I havent felt like leaving out spices if youre out is a big deal.  Ive been out of parsley and basil and it made no difference- I just ignored them.

7. I always make extra sauce and a vat or rice b/c the family wants to eat it for leftovers for days.

Im really surpised at those who dont like this.  Ive made it probably 25 times and every time (except for one when I made a HUGE mistake on salt- tired due to having a newborn!) Ive been hailed a hero.

Whoever came up with this recipe knows what they are doing.  Enjoy!

I don't go by reviews much anymore but I took a chance on this one and thought how bad could this be - I thought this was going to be okay - but nope - it was amazing - this is a new standard.  I added some fresh mushrooms as well.  Very good. The other thing about this recipe is that it is REALLY EASY to do.

5 stars?  Heck, make that 5000 stars for this most fascinating and mouth-watering recipe!!  I have had my share of wonderful chicken recipes but this recipe definitely takes the cake; it is definitely on the top of my list! Fine dining / restaurant quality for sure!  There is nothing to change about this most exceptional recipe other than the fact that I added lemon pepper to the chicken broth mixture as suggested in some of the reviews.  I also added extra flour coating on the chicken breasts as it was cooking in the skillet to increase the 'thickness' of the coating and it turned out great.  May I suggest the addition of chopped fresh mushrooms to the chicken broth mixture.  But again, it's only a suggestion since the recipe is perfectly fine as it is.  Cudos to the creator of this stunning recipe!  Safe to say, I will definitely make this dish again but this time, it will be for friends and family.

Wow!  Ever after all the substitution I made, this still turned out awesome and I recieved raved reviews.  I didn't have lemon so I had to use lime and substituted more chicken broth for the wine.  I suggest to make only 1/2 of the flour mixture because there was more than 1/2 left after dredging them.  I also added a tblsp of the flour mixture to the soup for added flavor.  It had a nice, subtle taste.  I can't wait to try it with lemon.  Thank you!

This was amazing.  I couldn't believe that a recipe that I already had all the ingredients for could be so wonderful!  I added 1/4 c. of the flour mixture to the broth before pouring it over the chicken so that it would thicken a bit while the chicken simmered... to create more of a gravy consistency.  I swear, my husband actually LICKED his plate clean! *haha*

Wow, this was awesome.  Tastes gourmet, but quick and easy.  I didn't do the exact recipe because I was missing some things, but it turned out great.  I didn't have basil or capers and I forgot the paprika.  Didn't add the lemon zest either.  Frankly, it had the perfect amount of lemon flavor.  I also only used 1/4 cup of butter, 1/2c. seemed too much and I used the healty request cream of mushroom to cut back on calories.  I had a lot of flour mixture left over, as well. The sauce thickened perfectly.  Next time I will make according to recipe to see if there is any difference in flavor. But even without a few ingredients it was still delicious.

This was delicious.  I did have a ton of the flour mixture left over, I wonder if maybe the recipe was supposed to read 4 breasts "halved", rather than "halves".  Nonetheless an easy, fast, very tasty "restauranty" dish.

This tasted good, but there are a few things I will do differently the next time I prepare it. I followed the advice of another reviewer and dumped my leftover flour/herb mixture (of which there was quite a bit) into the sauce to thicken it and add flavor. It turned out TOO thick, with a gross globby texture, which is my fault for adding too much. So the next time I make this, I will only make half of the flour mixture called for, and then only add a little bit of what's left over to the sauce. I also didn't taste much lemon in this. I didn't use the lemon zest, because I didn't have any, so I will add that next time, and also plan to add mushrooms to the sauce next time, because we love mushrooms. The taste was great, though - I made this over egg noodles. Oh, and one more thing - I only used half the amount of butter called for, and it wasn't enough. I will use the full amount next time. In other words, next time I will do a better job of sticking to the recipe.

Really good chicken recipe.  I used tenderloins rather than breasts and dipped them in an egg/buttermilk mixture before dredging them in flour.  Like DREGINEK, I added some lemon pepper seasoning to the soup mixture and didn't use quite the full amount of chicken broth...maybe a couple of tbls shy.  I didn't add the capers or parsley (forgot) and hubby picked off the breading..but I fully enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing.

Loved the flavor, but what I don't understand is why my sauce was so liquidy.  It did not thicken at all.  Whole family said, "Great flavor, sauce should be thicker."  Will definately try this one again.

This was just okay for me. I think the spices were a little strong, and the breading was gummy. Its worth another try, so next time i will make some changes. I will add a little less thyme in the flour mixture, and brown the chicken more using olive oil instead of butter. I'll then remove the chicken and keep it warm while i add the soup mixture to the pan without the chicken and then when its ready add the chicken again just to coat it.  My chicken needed to be crispier before the sauce was added. All in all, it was a decent recipe, i just expected more after reading all the reviews. I'll try again!

This was very good, especially served over angel hair pasta.  There was entirely too much flour mixture and most was thrown away.  When I make it again, I will reduce that by half. I used olive oil instead of butter and I had regular chicken broth, not condensed.  All in all, a good dish.

I'm giving this one 4 stars for flavor. I followed the recipe as written and added a package of fresh mushrooms, sliced. I dont know if it was because I used regular broth instead of condensed but my sauce was way too runny. Next time I may omit the broth or use much less,I like a thicker sauce like gravy. Otherwise it turned out good. I definately liked the flour seasoning (coating).

Pretty good chicken.  I would definitely recommend using only 1/2 the flour mixture - that's plenty for only 4 chicken breasts.  I also only used 1/4 cup butter (next time I would use olive oil).  I used a recipe for cream of mushroom soup from scratch (recipe is in my box if you are interested).  Instead of the condensed chicken broth, I used 1/2 cup organic chicken broth.  Served it over rice and it was a satisfying meal.

This is soooo good and easy to make.  I added some sauteed mushrooms also.  Adjust the lemon to your taste.  Served over egg noodles with proscuitto wrapped asparagus from this site.  I only give 5 stars to recipes that blow me away.  This is one of them along with the asparagus.  One Great Meal !!

This was pretty good.  I took some of the other suggestions and did the following: 1.) I increased the wine to 1/2 cup;  2.) I whisked the soup with the broth before adding it to the chicken;  3.) I took 2 heaping tablespoons of the flour mixture, added some of the broth to it, and then mixed it in with the sauce; 4.) I didn't have lemon pepper so I added 1 tablespoon of dried lemon peel to the sauce.  

I made it with bowtie pasta, but found that the sauce was more like a gravy and would probably be better over rice.  I'm making rice to go with the leftover chicken.

Although the sauce was very tasty, the chicken came out a little dry.  Based on other reviews, I whisked a couple tablespoons of the seasoned flour into the soup mixture before pouring it over the chicken; this made the cooked sauce thick and gravy-like.  I might tinker with this recipe and try it again.  Maybe dipping the chicken in beaten egg before flouring and browning, or pounding the chicken first, would result in more tender chicken.

Overall, this chicken is very good.  After reading that the flour fell off during cooking for some people, I dipped the chicken in the flour mix, milk, then more flour mix and it all stayed on just fine.  I added a little more lemon juice and garlic salt.  I served the chicken over rice and peas.  My husband raved about the sauce.  Great recipe, and so easy!

So good and so easy!  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of chicken.  I also didn't have a lemon, so used three tablespoons of lemon juice instead (and skipped the zest as garnish).  I added some fresh mushrooms to the sauce and let them simmer with the chicken for the 20 minutes.  Absoluely delicious!

I simplified this by breading the chicken (dredge in flour, dip in egg, dip in seasoned breadcrumbs) then followed the rest of the instructions. Used lime instead of lemon since that is what I had. Family loved this over rice.

Very good. I made a few minor changes.used half the butter and used sherry for the wine.I also sauteed some extra mushrooms with the chicken. .I served over egg noodles. I agree with previous posters that there is a lot of wasted flour dredge...probably only needs half. I also tried this in the crock pot..it does quite will there.

Delicious.  I agree with other reviewers who suggest too much flour mixture and sauce for four breasts.  The recipe is best for eight chicken breasts. It is problematic to cut the recipe in half for four breasts.  Do not omit the fresh lemon juice, the lemon zest, and the capers.  They make the dish.  We really enjoyed it with brown basmati rice and fresh green beans. This dish is restaurant quality.

Delicious!  So tender and flavorful.  Got a rave review from the hubby.  Will definitely make this again.  I did not have any parsley, but can't imagine that would have made it all that much better.  I also added lemon pepper to the sauce and dredged the chicken in egg before the flour mix, as suggested by others.  YUMMY!

The Lemon Mushroom Herb Chicken was very easy to make, although i did destroy the kitchen.  The taste was amazing, however it was very rich... this could be a once every 3 month recipe. this is not a weekly dish.

Great recipe. Very versatile, you can tailor it to your own taste. I used cream of chicken soup, and mixed the herbs (modified amounts) in with the sauce. Didn't use the flour at all. I'm sure that it would be great as written also. Thanks for sharing Valerie!

This recipe is quite good.  Makes a very moist chicken and sauce.  I add fresh mushrooms and always wind up with a lot of sauce.  The only issue I have is that once I put the chicken that has been dipped in the herb mixture into the mushrooms, the breading comes off the chicken.  Don't know quite how to keep the herbs on the chicken once the chicken is in the mushroom sauce.  But definitely tasty!

This was so easy and delicous to whip up with ingredients I had on hand.  My only suggestion is to pound the chicken breast to an even 1/2 inch to ensure they cook quickly before they toughen up.  Garnished with lemon slices and served over wild rice pilaf and a tossed green salad.

My family loved this dish! I added fresh mushrooms--sauteed with the chicken.  Even my picky 9 year old ate this up.  Super easy meal to get on the table on a weeknight.  I served with steamed broccoli and rice--awesome meal.

I made this recipe and served it over noodles instead of rice.  My husband and I loved it.  My son did not care for it, however, he hates anything that even hints of lemon.  So we don't really listen to him!  I would absolutely make this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fabulous!!!  I was afraid I would be one of the few people who didn't like this recipe, but it was really wonderful!  I can't imagine anyone finding this bland.  I served over brown rice.  I did make some of the suggestions of other reviewers, such as sauteeing some sliced mushrooms with the chicken, adding the flour mix to the soup mix to make it thinker, dipping the chicken in egg before the flour mix and some lemon pepper seasoning in the sauce, and I was very impressed with the taste and ease.  My boyfriend ate more than I thought humanly possible. Thanks!!!

This recipe was great - I took a little advice from both "Mr. Monty" and "Dreginek" to make this mouth-watering wonderful! Served over rice pilaf and w/ a tossed salad, your dinner table looks like your sitting at a restaurant without the expensive dinner bill at the end of the evening.  Would be a great way to impress your guests! Also, it was much easier to make than I originally thought! Thanks Valerie & All Recipes!

I have been making this for years-a sure fire crowd pleaser. I simplify by omitting flour, browning ck first and drizzling lemon juice over each., then adding soups and remainder of ingredients. Simmer on low about 20/30 minutes. I cook minute rice in chicken broth and ladle chicken breast with plenty of gravy over rice. Use fresh mushrooms cooked with the chicken gravy, serve w/a side salad or green veggie and you've got a great well rounded meal that no ones ever turned down at my house!  Great reheated as well.

This was absolutely fabulous!  Restaurant quality!  I used chicken tenderloins instead of breast halves, as they always seem to turn out more moist for me - and they were!  I had some fresh rosemary to use up, so I chopped 2 Tbl. of it and used it in place of the thyme.  Awesome flavor!  I used an egg wash (1 beaten egg + 1 Tbl. water) to dip the chicken in before dredging in flour.  I made my dish lower in fat by using 2 Tbl. margarine instead of 1/2 cup butter.  Wasn't even missed!  Thanks for the recipe!

easy.  Fantastic.  What more could you want.  You do need a fairly large frying pan to fit all the chicken and all the sauce. My husband went crazy over this.

The only part we liked was the flour mixture. I don't know, maybe my taste buds are off, but I didn't find this dish to be anything worth raving about. I added mushrooms and garlic, my favorite, but it just didn't do it for us.

Just made this dish for dinner tonight.  My family absolutely loved it.  I pounded the chicken to about 1/4 inch, omitted the parsley (my family doesn't like it) used golden mushroom soup (gave GREAT flavor and color) and used Pinot Grigio white wine.  This will definitely be on my list of favorite chicken recipes!

This recipe is simple and delicious. I dipped the chicken in beaten egg and then into flour mixture.
I am allergic to lemon juice so I only used the zest of the rind. Will be serving this one over and over again.

I told myself I'd grown out of using soup as an ingrediant but this was so easy and very good.  Enjoyed by all.  I will most likely add fresh mushrooms next time to add more texture.  Wild rice as a nice side for this.

Very easy to make, contains ingredients that you typically have around and not only did my picky eater son ask for seconds, but my 'foodie' husband said he thought it was really good. My only comment was that it seemed salty to my taste so would use low salt soups in the future. I also used egg white to dip the chicken in before putting them in the flour.

YUM!  This was delicious served over egg noodles with green beans.  I took previous reviewers' advice and dipped the chicken in beaten egg before breading.  Very good meal!

My family thought this was OK but they wouldn't request it again. I could not taste it as I have a cold so can only go by their word!

I liked this, but my lemon must have been huge, as it was way too tart (and I love lemon). I added a little sugar to the sauce and that helped.  The chicken itself was very tender. I made it as directed, dredged in the herbs and flour. I don't think you'd want to do an egg-wash bound breading with this recipe, as some have suggested, since it would get too soggy. Also, the sauce needs the flour from the sauteed chicken to thicken.   BF said it was "restaurant food" and a "definite have again" but I will measure the lemon next time and just not squeeze a whole one into the mix.

My husband and I really enjoyed this simple, delicious recipe.  The only change I made was to add some sliced and sauteed fresh mushrooms.  Yum!

This was ok.  I didn't use the capers and used regular chicken broth.  Although we normally like lemon quite a bit, we thought that the lemon flavor wasn't to our liking in this dish.

I LOVE this!  I couldn't get enough of the lemony sauce, so I doubled it and served the chicken and sauce over egg noodles.  I also make it with chicken tenderloins, which is a bit faster.  Be sure to brown the coated chicken before adding the liquids.  This is my new favorite recipe!  (And all I ever make is chicken!)

This is FANTASTIC.  The only change I made was to substitute half of the butter with some olive oil - just for the health benefits.  This is an excellent recipe, and one of our favorite weeknight fallbacks.  My husband loves making this - it's so easy!

I had such high hopes for this recipe!  It sounded so good, and got such rave reviews. I can only guess, but I think that the condensed soups are what ruined it for us.  My family of four agreed that this recipe, unfortunately, was not a keeper.  We really liked how it started out with all of the herbs and the sauteed chicken, maybe next time, I'll just stick with the lemon and white wine and add a bit of cream to thicken it up.  It has so much flavor going on also, it really does not need the additional punch of the capers.  I added sliced fresh mushrooms which I sauteed up with the chicken which was good.  We voted to either stick with a chicken marsala or picatta, and not try to do both at the same time in a creamy sauce again.  Thanks anyway, but IOHO, we just didn't like this.

YUMMO.  This stuff is great.  I did omit the capers...because I didn't have any and used roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup.  Everything else I followed to a "T".  Delicious.  I served this with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and corn.  This will be made many times more.  Thanks for the post.

We loved this recipe.  I omitted the salt, and used 98% fat free soup to cut back on the fat and salt intake.  The broth has enough salt in it for this recipe.  Very Very Good.  Thank you for the post.

Wonderful recipe. I cut the boneless- skinless chicken breasts into large chunks before putting through the flour mixture instead of leaving them whole. They turned out great! Served over angel hair pasta. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I too have never seen/heard of condensed chicken broth.  I used condensed cream of chicken soup.  It was a little heavy on the chicken flavor but was nice an creamy (1/2 a can of the Chicken soup would have been enough).  Added fresh sliced mushrooms as I was browning the chicken.  Will definately make again.

This is delicious. I usually omit the butter (I use a tablespoon of olive oil instead) and leave out the capers. I also find that the juice is plenty of lemon flavor for me, so I don't use any lemon zest. I serve with garlic rice and a salad. Very good.

very very good - superb with rice!!! best was the ease of turning out something that tasted so professional!! suggestion : a little (or a LOT of!) extra thyme in the sauce adds to the aroma and taste tremendously!!

Made this a couple nights ago to rave reviews, so much so that my husband wanted it again the next night but we were all out of chicken! Served it over rice so that we could enjoy all of the great sauce it made. Some tips to improve it would be to ensure that you pound the chicken breasts...that always makes them fork-tender. Maybe a bit more lemon juice in the sauce, as I found most of the lemon taste came just from the zest. The capers gave it great zing. If you're so inclined, you could make it a little healthier by using low-fat cream of mushroom soup and less butter. Since it was my first time making it, I used what was called for, but don't think it really needs that much. Thanks, Valerie!

This was a very rich and tasty dish. I diden't have the cream of mushroom soup so, I used cream of chicken and a can of mushrooms. I served it on egg noodles. I don't know if I want to make it with the correct soup next time or repeat my subistute. It was also better the next day as leftovers.

Tried this recipe and thought it was very good.  Took the advice of others and increased the white wine content to 12c. and added 2T. of the flour mixture to the sauce so it would be thicker in consistency.  Served with rice.  Will definately make this in the future.

Very, very good!  I searched all over the place to find capers (I didn't even know what they were,) and after making this recipe, I don't even think they're neccesary at all.  The lemon-mushroom flavor is outstanding!  Made this for company and they loved it.

Absolutely scrumptious; perhaps the best recipe I've tried yet on this site. I used lemon concentrate instead of fresh, and I don't think anyone could tell the difference. Next time, I'll mix the soup with hot broth before adding other liquids, as it tends to remain "chunky" if not well mixed.

This is an easy, tasty way to prepare chicken.  And the chicken was so tender!  The sauce is a bit on the runny side, though.

Excellent!!, it was better than expected. Sometimes your just not sure how things might turn out. I was going to make another baked lemon chicken mushroom recipe, but glad I went with this one because others said the other recipe was bland. I followed recipe but added a small can of mushrooms for my husband. Served over white rice and made broccoli as a side dish. I am the taste tester of recipes and if they turn out good I pass recipe along. I will do.

This was a great recipe, will definitely make this again. I did add fresh mushrooms, garlic, onion and string beans to the soup, wine, lemon mixture. I also seasoned the chicken, browned it on both sides, removed from pan, cooked the veggies, added the mixture and chicken back into the same pan and simmer for 30 mins. Easy one dish cooking on the stove top. Served over white rice.

My mistake was using 2 pieces of chicken and cutting it in half. Next time I'll use 4 and halve, it otherwise 1cup is to much flour. Otherwise super delicious with baked potato and veggie.

Was really hesitant when I saw the mixture of soups, lemon, and wine (it looks weird) but after you boil it down it comes out nice and thick. Tasted great and goes awesome with pasta

This recipe was really good. It was quite easy to make. I also dipped my chicken into egg white before coating with the flour mixture. I did make a few changes: I put half the amount of salt, didn't add the wine, and used a McCormick herb chicken spice pack to speed up preparation. Overall, very tasty and will definitely make it in the future.

This is delicious and a favorite "go-to" dish. I usually use tenderloins cut into bite-sized pieces, mix the dry ingredients in a gallon ziplock and toss in the chicken pieces to coat. Sometime I may try with chicken cutlets.

This is was good, and easy. However-it was not quite as over the moon amazing as some of the reviewers made it out to be, in my opinion.

I only give it a 4 cause my hubby didn't like it although i did change much of the recipe, but if I could have made changes I would. First, I used whole chicken breasts & so i couldn't cook it in the pan with the sauce under the allotted time, so i seared off the breast & transferred to a baking dish, I then made the sauce by itself & poured the sauce over the chicken & continued cooking it, my biggest problem was that I should have reduced the sauce more before adding it, besides that I enjoyed it.

This was quick and easy with a lot of flavor.  I also added a can of mushrooms and used the Cream of mushroom soup with garlic and herbs.  Served it over brown rice and green beans on the side.

I thought this recipe turned out really great! I didn't use the wine in the sauce and I used just a couple of squirts of lemon juice from the container not a fresh lemon.  It was delicious! I also used just the chicken breast strips instead of full chicken breasts, they're a little cheaper and and it allows for sort of choosing how much chicken you get in the dish.  I also made jasmine rice and just laid two or three cooked chicken strips and then spooned sauce over the top! It was wonderful!!

Excellent!  I hardly changed it.  only because I didn't have basil!  I would have also added fresh mushrooms, but only if I had them on hand,  Everything else I have, and only have one recipe that calls for capers, so wonderful change of pace.  Hubby loved it!  Thank you

So easy with all the ingredients already in my cupboard.  As other reviews suggested - I used lemon juice and dipped in egg first.  This will be a new "Go to" recipe for chicken breasts ...

Hands down one of the best chicken recipes I've ever tried!  We put everything in except for the capers (I knew I was forgetting something when I went grocery shopping!)  We served this with rice and it was so delicious, even my picky 5 year old ate it.  I honestly wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.  Thanks so much!

This was easy and a great week night meal.  I pounded the chicken, dipped it in egg, then flour, used fresh basil and parsley, and doubled the amount of these spices and all others listed, except salt and pepper, where I just increased amounts slightly.  Right before serving I removed the chicken to a warmed platter, added a little flour and whisked it into the gravy, and it was perfect consistency.  Great recipe!  Will put it in the regular rotation for weeknights!

This was wonderful! I ended up making it for myself on a night when I didn't feel like cooking, and I'm so glad I decided not to get take out! I made only two chicken breasts, so I reduced the amount of flour to 1/2 cup (still more than enough) and the butter to 1/4 cup (plenty). I also used canned "regular" chicken broth because I didn't have condensed on hand. I skipped the lemon zest, parsley, and capers because I didn't have those, either. I served the chicken with leftover rice, which was great for soaking up the yummy sauce! Will definitely be making this again...and next time, for people other than myself!

This had a great flavor.  You can taste the lemon but it wasn't overpowering.  I did not use the lemon zest, capers or the whole cup of flour.  Just dusted the chicken with the flour and added all the seasonings to the soup mixture and poured over the chicken.  Served over brown rice.  Next time will cut chicken into strips because I don't like "big bulky bites" of chicken breast.

Great taste! Loved it. I'd suggest cutting down the ingredients to coat the chicken in half, since almost 90% of it doesn't stick and is wasted.

A terrific recipe as is.  This recipe also works well with fish (snapper or halibut), pork chops, and veal. Serve with a buttered pasta or rice and a nice California Chardonnay.

This was fabulous! Followed recipe exactly and added mushrooms. Easy to make! Lots of delicious sauce, so I served this with homemade spaetzle (German egg noodles) and together they were divine. Will definitely add to the regular rotation. Significant Other said he doesn't like capers, but I do, so I told him to pick them out ... in the end, he got over it, ate the whole thing, and said he loved it.

Five stars because the recipe uses common pantry items and taste so good!  I wanted to follow the recipe exactly, but I couldn't ignore previous comments.  I am CERTAIN it would rate 5 stars with or w/out the adjustments.  First thing I did was change servings to 2 and printed the recipe.  My alterations(1) one large breast cut in half and pounded to uniform size and thickness (2) Mixed full amounts of flour and herbs then split mixture in half, reserving the other half for another day. (3) Used 2 Tblsp butter and 2 Tblsp canola oil. Heat fats in pan until bubbling subsides. (4) Dipped chicken and sauteed 2 minutes each side.  Dipped again and sauteed until nice dark golden brown and removed to a plate and kept warm.  (5) Sliced 4 mushrooms and added to the hot butter pan and sauteed for a little bit. (6) dumped in last of flour from the dipping dish and browned the flour. (7) Added the recipe's liquid ingredients and let all that simmer on low while I prepared side veggie. (8) When serving, I put 1/2 cup rice and pushed it around to cover a lot of plate, chicken breast on top, then a generous amount of sauce over chicken and rice.  Loved the crust of the chicken. This was a perfect dinner for two.  There is sauce left over (for potatoes tomorrow).  On a final note, I had made herbed long grain and wild rice, but plain rice would have been better.  I omitted capers cuz I didn't have any capers and zest just wasn't needed. This was a really nice dinner for two!

I'm only giving this 4 stars because I felt the lemon in the dish was overpowering for the sauce itself.  I think a little would've been ok.  Next time I wouldn't add citrus instead I would add more wine.  The great thing about the sauce is it's very versatile.  You can substitute the wine with Marsala and add sauteed mushrooms and have a creamy Chicken Marsala dish.  I recommend only dusting the chicken with flour.  Others suggested an egg and flour bath....I say no!  I think the batter would just peel off the chicken when you are simmering it and create a mess.

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for posting this recipe! I loved the flavors together. I cooked mine differently from all others in that I did not saute the chicken, but instead baked the chicken at 350 for 45 min. with all the ingredients mixed together in a baking dish minus the flour, capers, and  butter. I accidentally used cayenne pepper instead of paprika which made this dish very spicy, with a Thai-like flavor, which was very tasty. I also used 1/3 c. vermouth and lemon/pepper combo and cream of chicken soup instead of broth because they were what I had on hand. Stirred in lemon extract with the cooked rice before adding the rice to the chicken and sauce. I may try it with coconut milk next time to add a little more to the Thai-like flavor. Very delicious! Will definitely make over and over again, Thanks!

Very, very good. I didn't use parsley or the garnish (capers, lemon zest), but this was still delicious. Not a calorie-conscious everyday meal, that's for sure!

This is such a easy and yummy dinner. I tried it out on my husband and a friend of ours and it was a big hit. I then made it again and it was a big hit. Reheats great for lunches too. However I think the next time i make it I will cut down the amount of the herbs and add some mushrooms.

We loved this recipe.  The chicken could even be made with out the mushroom sauce and still be great.  I added carmelized onions and mushrooms into the soup mix.  Also, as mentioned by others, I added almost 1/4 cup of the flour mixture into the soup mix before adding it to the chicken to thicken the gravy.  I will definitely make this again.

I wish I could give this recipe more stars than just 5.  Everytime I make this recipe I add garlic and mushrooms to the sauce.  My family always licks the plates.  This sauce is awesome.  ooooo I just thought about pork chops.  I be they will rock with this sauce too!!

I read reviews that the breading tended to fall off, so I skip that all together. Instead I just rubbed the spices on the chicken and cooked it like that, I also rubbed lemon pepper seasoning with the lemon zest on the chicken breast. I omited the capers, we normally do not keep those in stock here at the house. This was a good recipe, not at all time consuming or complicated. I will make it agian the exact same way. I will not try it with the breading, it just does not make sense for this recipe. And even if I was i would definatly do it like i usually do with milk or eggs. I also took a meat mallet to the chicken and pounded it a bit to tenderize. very tasty, family ate it all. I served with rice and green beans.

awesome flavor - husband loved it!  need to make sure to coat chicken in enough flour to thicken the sauce or cut back a little on the butter.  added flour to compensate and the gravy got a little too thick...

I think maybe I used too much lemon juice because the lemon I used was very good.  But, this was still delicious.  I liked it very much.  I had some fresh mushrooms so I sauteed them and threw them in also.  Serve over pasta with a green salad and you're set.

As others have stated, this is one of the best recipes around. You can vary it in so many different ways depending on what you have on hand and yet it still comes out wonderful. My kids love this dish with rice. I keep ziplock bags of the flour mixture in my freezer and do not dip chicken in egg to save time. I typically use chicken tenderloins because they're tender and conveniently sized pieces.

This was so yummy.  I bought a rotesserie chicken from the grocery store, cut it up, sauted the chicken and herbs in half the butter the recipe called for.  I made the sauce as recipe stated.  I added lemon pepper salt to the broth mixture and served over rice.  This was so yummy.

This was so great! I pounded the chicken out first and added lemon pepper seasoning to the flour.  I used olive oil instead of butter and I served it over angel hair pasta. I omited the parsley and capers. Has to be one of the best things I have ever made. Will make again! Thanks for the recipe!

When I first read this recipe I wasn't sure if the mixture of ingredients would come out well, but they did!  This is an amazing dish with lots of flavor.  I usually leave off the parsley and the capers though, cuts down on cost and time, but the rest is great!

This recipe is one of my favorites.  I usually just cut the chicken breast in half instead of into cubes, and I only use a tablespoon of butter.  I also usually don't use the parsley, capers or lemon zest as this is a great meal I can make with things I normally have in my pantry (and I don't like capers).  My husband likes this over noodles, but I like rice.

This was delicious.  I prepared it in a Nesco roaster and made a few changes: I used 8 small bone-in chicken pieces; 1/4 cup butter was plenty; 1/2 can of the condensed chicken broth.  This was for a family get together and both my sister and daughter wanted the recipe.  It also 'held' very well as I turned it down to low heat when finished.  
Campbell's makes chicken broth which is in the soup aisle - do not dilute it and it is very rich and perfect for this recipe.  Thanks.

Campbell's sell a chicken broth. I would recommend the low-sodium version or your meal will come out very salty. That's what the submitter meant!

Someone needs to help me. I have never seen condensed chicken broth. I made this with chicken broth and it was soupy. We loved the taste, but wonder if I made a big mistake. I wish that I had served some type of rice or starch to use the juice of the sauce. Still the chicken was excellent and very tasty.

I made this and yes way too much flour, I used 3/4 and I still had some leftover but as recommended by others, I put some in the sauce at the end to thicken.  My hubby thought the sauce looked heavy but when he tasted it he said I'll take some for lunch too.  I will make this again.  I added fresh mushrooms too, for eye appeal besides that, kept everything the same.

I thought this recipe was very good and easy.  I think I would probably cut down on the amt of butter, it seemed a bit much.  I also added some fresh mushrooms to this dish which went over very well.

A sure "do-over" recipe. Easy to make with great results.After cooking the chicken and before adding the sauce, I sauted fresh mushrooms in the leftover butter and added a little wine.

This was a great combination of ingriedients! I do think the sauce was a little thin so it would probably be even better if you add flour or cornstarch to your liquid portion while cooking. I had cream of chicken on hand so I used that instead and just added fresh cooked mushrooms to the sauce. I'm sure it is even better with the cream of mushroom.

Very good but I know it would have been better if I would have drained the pan before adding the soup mixture to it.  I think this was forgotten in the recipe because the butter that was in the pan just sat on top of the soup mix and made it look greasy.  Tasted delicious though - will be better when drained though.

Great recipe.  Lot's of flavor and pretty easy.  I would suggest using less butter, 1/4 cup is plenty.  Also, I used less chicken stock and more wine and it turned out well.  It made a lot of extra sauce so you could even cut the sauce recipe back a bit.  I had to discard some of mine.  I also thickened the sauce by mixing in some of the flour mixture.  Oh, and I used chicken tenders instead of breasts which it made it more fun to entertain with.  Serve with rice, roasted carrots and garlic bread, yum!

Wow, this is a wonderful dish...never tried capers before, what a pungent explosion of flavor these give with the rest of the ingredients. If you've never tried capers, the flavor reminds me somewhat of dijon mustard. Instead of adding the 2 tblsps, I put them in a small dish so we could take as many as we felt brave enough to try. So glad I opted not to omit them. I sauteed 8 ounces of sliced fresh mushrooms just before the sauce was added to the pan. Toward the end, I uncovered the pan, letting the sauce simmer and reduce somewhat so it was a little thicker. Served over brown rice along with sides of sugar snap peas and cottage cheese.
Thanks much for sharing this recipe!

Great easy recipe.  I made some extra flour mixture and am keeping it in a tupperware in the fridge so it saves me some time next time I make this recipe.  My husband is not a big mushroom fan, but he really enjoyed this meal.  My kids loved it, too!

First, I read the reviews before making this recipe so I knew there would be too much flour, it might be a bit runny and sometimes the sauce is chunky. So I didn't use all the flour at once, and saved enough for two more times. That cuts down on prep for next time. I also added long grain rice cooked in half as much water as needed when there was about 15 minutes before I was serving. The rice soaked up a lot of the fluid and flavor - tasted great! I also mixed all the liquid in a bowl beforehand and nuked it for about 5 minutes, stirring throughout, so the sauce wouldn't be chunky. The result - excellent! Tasty and smells great!

This was excellent, but a little thin.  Next time we will add another can of cream of musroom soup.  We enjoyed it, though, and will definitely make it again!  Thanks for sharing!

I agree that this is one of the best chicken recipes I have made.  I recommend using a whisk to stir together the soup and broth mixture -- it will elimanate the clumps from the mushroom soup.  This makes a wonderful company dish.  Very pretty with the lemon zest and parsley garnishes.  Thank you for sharing this!

This was awesome!  I couldn't stop eating it.  I used low fat cream of mushroom and no wine and it was still extremely tasty.  Can't wait for the leftovers...

Wonderful!  Next time I'll just use 1/2 to 3/4 cup flour.  Way too much left over and it diluted the other seasonings.

To die for, my absolute favorite so far!  I used whole chicken breasts for an elegant presentation.  The herbs pack the chicken full of flavor and the wine makes it moist!  Good for kids too, my 6 year old loves it.

Lemon adds just the most delightful aromatic to this recipe.  Yet very light flavor to the sauce, addictive my husband said! ;)
I added a can of Veg-All and some fresh mushrooms, used Healthy Choice cream of mushroom, and served over brown rice. Not only was it fast, easy and tastes awesome, it was a nice healthy dinner.  Normally cream sauces are a killer for the diet.  Thanks so much, we'll be eating this often.

Loved it! If you don't like the taste of lemon, definitely not a recipe for you. I cut the chicken breasts thin, watch your cooking time on the chicken breasts, the butter cooks them beautifully. Husband and 15 year old liked it, 10 year old wasn't quite sure about the caper taste. I would definitely make again. Lots of gravy, so perfect with rice, couscous, or fettuccine.

Soo good!! Followed the tips and added a bunch of extra mushrooms cause I love them, I also recommend adding A bit more lemon juice if you are a fan of the taste. This recipe makes so much more than the four breasts it mentions. I had five very large breasts and there was still tons of coating and juice that could have been used for more. Also helpful tip- use an egg wash before dredging the chicken.

I myself made a few edits to this recipe used: italian seasoning rather than basil, eliminated capers, parsley & thyme. I couldn't taste the paprika at all. Used 6 chicken tenders rather than breast. I did dice the chicken.  To the sauce added mushrooms. I served over bow tie pasta & broccoli. From what I taste of the sauce it was flavorful and delicious. this made a lot.

I just made this tonight, and it was a HUGE hit!! It is so flavorful, and absolutely my favorite chicken dish now!! I didn't have a fresh lemon, so I used a fresh lime instead. I didn't have white wine, so I used apple cider vinegar. I used a can of drained portabella mushrooms too. Superb flavor from from first bite to last bite! Can't wait to try it with lemon. This is a must try!! Excellent and easy!

4 star base but 5 star with others suggestions.  After reading a good bit of reviews heres a summary and this is MUCH better than I anticipated.  Even my husband who complains with "too much lemon" raved about this recipe ~ the lemon, wine, mushroom, capers are a wonderful combination I've never tried before this recipe.  So here's how to make this a 5 star from other's suggestions: (1) add mushrooms and soak in chicken broth ~ 30 min.  I only had organic dried mushrooms so I soaked in heated broth for 30 min.  Really brings out a richness to the broth that can't be mimicked in the cooking process. (2) Sub cooking sherry or masala wine for white wine ~ goes better with mushrooms.  (3) don't worry if you don't have all dried herbs - I didn't have basil ~ subbed poultry seasoning the herb amounts are great but any combo works per others and my change worked fine. (4) Many 1/2 the flour and herb ingred. for 4 chx breast - I was a little short for the 4th breast but definitely the full 1c. would be too much.  Probably due to my rather large 4 chx breasts.  (5) Definitely keep the capers if you have them ~ adds a bit of spicyness but the fresh parsley doesn't do much if you don't have it.  (6) the lemon sounds like a lot especially for my sensitive hubby but it was a perfect balance.  Hope this is helpfull and saves you time reading.

My husband declared this the best chicken I've ever made. I had no lemons so had to use lemon juice, and also (per review suggestion) added some lemon pepper to the dredge. Note: It makes the lemon flavor VERY strong. Not recommended if you like a mild lemon flavor. Next time, I think I'll add sliced mushrooms too.

This was easy and wonderful! My chicken was frozen and I was in a hurry so I boiled it til it was cooked then dredged it through the spices and flour. I then put in in the pan with melted butter to make it golden on both sides and then added the liquid. I let it simmer for about ten minutes then served it over rice. The kids loved it! I used extra broth instead of wine and I didn't have lemon so used some lime juice that I had in the frig. This is definitely a keeper! Thank you for sharing it Valerie.

I loved this recipe!  All my favorite flavors in one great dish.  I cut the butter in half and added a little olive oil, added fresh baby bella mushrooms, and bought cream of mushroom with roasted garlic.  Delicious! I could bottle the sauce.

Funny story: I accidentally threw in the lemon juice right after I read: [For the sauce...] "In a mixing bowl, mix together cream of mushroom, chicken broth, & lemon juice." Doh! I wasn't planning on throwing away this batter, especially since that was the only lemon I had in the fridge. I continued. Served over rice, the breading on the chicken was tangy & tasty from the lemon and herbs. The sauce was very creamy & delicious.

I made this as a change of pace from a traditional chicken picatta that I usually make.  This was extremely easy and tasted wonderful.  I served it over pasta and kinda liked it more than my picatta.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, only I used a 98% fat free cream of mushroom and bottled lemon juice since I did not have fresh lemon.  I will definitely make this again.

I thought this recipe was extremely bland... I don't understand the rave reviews for this dish. I followed the recipe to a tee and didn't think the soup + wine + lemon was a good match. Too many alterations would be needed to give it a higher rating. Won't make this one again.

I followed other reviews. Dipped the chicken in egg before the flour mixture. Added 1 TBSP Lemon Pepper Seasoning to the flour mixture. And I sliced fresh mushrooms, soaked them in the broth and added them. It was so good! Thanks Valerie.

Excellent!  My 2 picky eaters told me to make this again...no problem!  I used what I had on hand and left out what I didn't have (used bottled lemon juice and dried parsley; had no wine, no capers or lemon zest) and it was still fantastic.  I cut the chicken into thin cutlets and pounded them between sheets of plastic wrap before cooking.  They cooked so quickly and stayed VERY tender and delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I used half the butter and didn't have the dried parsley, so used fresh. Had flour mixture left over, so I will cut in half next time. Lots of great sauce for the accompanying white rice to 'sop' up. So good! Lovely blend of flavors, be sure to use the zest with the capers and parsley at the end.

Nice, reasonably quick recipe.  I decided to make it at 5 and everything was on the table for 5:45 ready to eat.  Picky husband liked it as well as the little ones.  Didn't bother with the zest at the end.

This was definately not for us! I made the receipe exactly as it said, I used 10 chicken tenderloins instead of 4 chicken breasts. There is way too much flour for one thing, I highly suggest only using 1/2 a cup. Also, most of the herbs get thrown into the trash with the extra flour, very little actually stick to the chicken. So I would also suggest cutting th herbs in 1/2 an adding them into the stock/soup mixture. 1/2 a cup of butter would be too much, but you will need more than 1/4 like some other have posted. I would try maybe 1/3 and go from there. The sauce does come out very thing and there simply isn't enough meat to warrant that much sauce. I served it over corkscrew noodles. The thing that ruined it for us was the lemon juice. It simply did not mix well with the mushroom and wine flavors. Even my husband who likes just about everything, did not care for this dish. We will definately not be making it again.

This was SO good!  It is very similar to a chicken piccata meal I make and well, dare I say I like this one BETTER!!  As with the piccata and this meal, I leave out the capers and it still tasted FABULOUS!!  Thanks Valerie!

Dont really understand why this has such a high rating. Husband and I thought it was just ok, nothing to write a rave review about and dont think we will be making it again. We both thought it had too much lemon. Chicken was nice and moist.

This was just so-so.  However, I am going to try it one more time and brine the chicken breasts first.  They just tasted too dry to me.  Our company thought it was fine.

I enjoyed this because it was quick, easy and delicious!  I'm not crazy about thick or cheesy sauces on chicken so this was perfect!  The consistency was not to thick nor thin and it went deliciously over rice.  No side items were necessary - this was filling!  As recommended, I used a little lemon-pepper seasoning and added mushrooms.

I have been making this recipe for years.  I cut the flour mixture in half and never use the capers or parsley.  I like this over rice, my husband over noodles.  The chicken always turns out juicy and tender.  Try this one - it is yummy and easy!

This was soooo good!  I've served this to company a few times now and my husband's friends are under the impression that I'm an amazing cook...thank you!  I did make a couple of changes.  I omitted the capers (didn't have any and didn't feel like it was missing anything, so I've omitted them every time since), and I added the leftover flour mixture to the sauce, which adds a lot of flavour plus it thickens the sauce nicely.

When I told my boyfriend what we were having for supper he told me it "sounds weird", then he practically licked his plate clean! I followed the recipe as is but left out the wine ( I didn't have any) and forgot to put in the capers and lemon zest. It was awesome!

Wonderful base for a flexible recipe ... like a lot of reviewers I left out the capers and the lemon zest (used them in other things and found them to be too much for our taste).  I also followed the suggestions and used an egg coating to help the flour mixture a bit.  Overall it was fairly quick and definitely wonderful, and my husband now requests it at least once a week.

Made just as the recipe stated and it was AMAZING.  I made a pot of noodles to pour the leftover sauce on just so I wouldn't waste it.  the only suggestion I have is to halve the flour mixture.  I had about half left over.  Thanks Valerie for the great recipe.

Big wow in taste and for serving to guests I'd say. The only difference I did was slice the chicken into thin strips instead of leaving them whole, and I added fresh diced mushrooms, diced red peppers and 1Tbsp of capers to the sauce while it was simmering.Chicken was tender and super tasty.Thanks for a great recipe

Great dish!  I followed the recipe exactly and the only I will do next time is add fresh mushrooms.  I accompanied this dish with the "new potatoes and caper sauce" recipe from this site which was awesome as well.  However, since there's so much yummy sauce from the chicken, next time I'll do rice or cous cous to soak up the sauce.  This ones a keeper!

I made several adjustments for what I had on hand, and this was still fantastic! You can vary the flavors, and it doesn't matter- it will still be fantastic! I used Cream of Chicken & Mushroom, white zinfandel wine, and lime juice instead of lemon. The sauce it made resulted in the best mashed potatoes & gravy I've ever had! Next time I won't do the flour mixture- the breading was falling off as it was cooking- and that gravy is all you need!

This was a great dish!!! I've been looking for a great lemon herb sauce and this was excellent!!! Everyone in my family loved it! I used a bit more herbs than it called for and through in a sprig of fresh rosemary during the last five minutes of cooking. This will certainly be used often. I'm even going to try the sauce poured over fish. Thanks!!

I omitted the wine and capers and used bottled lemon juice, it turnd out great.Instead of frying the battered chicken in butter, I sauteed it in a little low fat butter spray, then battered and sauteed them again. I added a container of mushroom, next time Ill add lemon pepper. Because of the comment that there is a lot of seasoning left over I mixed it then seperated out two thirds of it and left the other third in the bowl. That way if there was left overs it wasn't tainted by raw chicken. Sure enough, one third was all I needed, and now I have the seasoning all ready to go for next time! and there will be a next time!

This was excellent and very easy. My husband especially enjoyed it. I didn't have any chicken broth so I just used water and it was fine. I also didn't have capers or fresh parsley. I did add the lemon zest and was especially glad for it. I think it added a lot. The flavors were very nice in my mouth for a long time after dinner.

I served this over egg noodles, and my family loved it.  Even the kids!  My youngest even choked down her veggies so that she could have seconds!  :)

I didn't have any wine in the house, so I'm looking forward to making the recipe as written.

This recipe is amazing! Definitely cut the breading mix in half. I ommited the thyme because I don't like it. The butter could probably be cut by half too. I doubled the sauce mix as suggested by some reviewers, used cooking white wine and omitted the fresh parsley, capers and lemon zest. I also thickened the sauce with corn starch and served it on a bed of rice. Definitely making this recipe again! It's a keeper!

Just average.  Kind of had a sogginess to it after breading it and then adding all that liquid afterward.  Overall flavor was just okay... kind of reminded me of Chicken Helper.

This is a really yummy recipe! I served it over angel hair pasta. I made  few minor changes: I used less butter, used non-condensed soup & broth, added fresh mushrooms, only made 1/2 the flour mixture and used some of THAT to thicken the sauce up. Very good recipe. I would give it a 4.5 if they let me.

OK. I don't know why I even tried this. I HATE mushrooms. I like green bean casserole (which is made with cream of muhsroom soup) and like that, so I guess it just depends on the dish. I made two servings (my bf was out of town) and omitted the parsley/caper/lemon zest garnish. Served over herbed noodles (i.e. Lipton mix). It was OK, but not something I'd make again. This would be a fine recipe for anyone who likes the combination of mushrooms and lemon together (which tasted odd to me). Thanks anyways!

Quick and easy, top restaurant-quality meal.  We added a can of mushrooms to the sauce and some shredded romano cheese to top it after.  Great meal with a salad and bread.

The sauce was VERY good, however after I cooked the chicken and added the sauce ingredients the breading started to fall off the chicken so there were peices of breading floating around in the sauce. It did taste good, but I would have preferred the breading to stay on the chicken.

This was pretty good.  It was a little tart for me though, however that may be because I didn't have capers so I used more lemon rind.

My husband really liked this one! I thought it was pretty tasty, but it was lacking a little something for me. Perhaps next time I'll add a little more spices and use less flour. I also may add some fresh mushrooms to add some more mushroom flavor. Cooking time is pretty accurate... not quite long enough (or maybe I had the heat too low?). Overall it was good.

I've had your recipe since Oct. of 2001.  I'm very sorry that I didn't review it before that.  It has a smiley face on it, but the smile is crooked so I think it was worth 4 stars then, but I'll gladly try it again.  Thanks for your time in posting this recipe, I really appreciate it.

Made a few changes.  Eliminated the cream of mushroom soup and wine.  Used just chicken stock.  Also added a 4oz can of sliced mushrooms.  Delicious!  The chicken was very tender!

I usually agree with the majority of people posting reviews on this site but not with this one.  I found the sauce/gravy to be rather mediocre (I must say though, I used 6 oz of chicken broth instead of 10.5 oz of "condensed chicken broth."  I didn't know what that was; maybe it's another type of soup).  I pounded out the chicken first, to cook evenly, and really liked the taste of the breading.  I think it would be very good with a simple lemon-butter sauce tossed with capers.  Much cheaper than buying all of the ingredients for this recipe.  Like another viewer posted, by putting the crispy chicken in the sauce for 20 minutes, it just ends up soggy and that beautiful crust is ruined.  I served this with egg noodles.  I will not make this again.  Not terrible, just certainly not something I can't live without.

OMG!  I loved this recipe!  This is an excellent weekday treat.  Try it, you won't regret it!  The first time I made it I didn't have thyme and used rosemary.  It was just as good...I didn't use the lemon zest either time and it was awesome.

We thought this dish was good, but it didn't really stand out as anything special for me. I agree about the flour as well, using half of the recommended flour mixture for dredging is MORE than enough. I may make this again, and play around with the sauce, maybe adding a bit of cream to make the sauce a bit more substantial.

This recipe was just ok for me.  It smelled so good when I was cooking it!  But unfortunately the taste after it was finished wasn't the same..  I don't know if I'll make it again.

VERY tasty! I modified my flour dredging spices a bit and used rosemary instead of thyme. Was a little salty but adjustable. Next time I will use half olive oil/half butter and use more wine/less stock for a little more tang. I don't do capers, so I ommitted those.  I added sliced fresh mushrooms at end of the saute process before adding the liquids. Hubby raved!

This was a wonderful blend of flavors.  I was working with what I had around and found this recipe.  I served it with rice and we ate every last bit of chicken and sauce.  So flavorful!  I like capers and added them to mine at the end - Make sure to only use 1/2 cup of flour....I still had leftover flour mixture.

Wow - really, really good!  I thought the chicken was great - I loved the coating, although 1 cup of flour was more than you need.  I thought the sauce was very good, although the lemon was a little overpowering.  (I used a juicer, so I might have ended up with more juice from one lemon than was intended) I think next time I will use half the amount of lemon juice, with a little less chicken stock and more wine.  My husband LOVED it - he didn't think it was too lemony.  He even mentioned it the next day, which is very unusual for him.  Will absolutely make again - thanks!!

This was great, after following other reviews and cutting down half on the lemon juice.  I had frozen breaded chicken cutlets...so I mixed the seasoning and added it to the thawed chicken. I also added mushrooms. Good enough for Company anytime!

I really expected to be wowed with this recipe, but it was very much like chicken piccata like another reviewer said.  The breading and sauce were tasty, but I didn't find the dish extraordinary.

Wow!  This was really wonderful, and very easy!  If you just glance at the recipe it looks like it might be harder just because of the long ingredient list.  It's just all the spices though, the recipe couldn't be easier.  My husband enjoyed it also.  I think I will use this recipe next time we have company over.  Here is what I did just to use what I had on hand...I had no basil so I had to leave it out, I used margarine instead of butter just to reduce the fat content a little, I used a can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic instead of regular, bottled lemon juice, no fresh parsley, capers, or lemon zest just because I didn't have them.  I'm sure they would really top it off.  I served it over egg noodles.  Thanks for a winner!  Carol

This was wonderful.  In a group of 8, a few thought the lemon was a bit strong but the rest of us loved it!!  Very easy to make.  I doubled the recipe, except for the flour mixture and it was porportioned perfect.  I also dipped the chicken in egg first and that worked great. GREAT RECIPE!

This recipe was awesome.  I do agree that there is too much flour mixture and split it in half before dipping the chicken into it.  I saved it for another time.

Wow! This is great! Served over angel hair pasta with sugar snap peas. I would reduce flour/herb mixture by half, use non-stick skillet and less butter. I skipped garnish and used reduced fat soups. I rarely review, this is a keeper!!!

I thought this had way too much basil in it.  It was very overpowering.  The breading was a bit thick too.  If I make it again I will decrease the basil to at least half.  Well I made it again not realizing I had made it before and I thought it was great.  Maybe I did something wrong the first time.  I did cut some of the basil out though and I used chardonney.

This was very very good!  As the other readers said, there was waaaaay to much flour mixture.  I would cut in half next time.  I served it over fettuccini noodles, which I started when I added  the liquid ingredients over the chicken.  Everything came together at the same time!  Don't cook to long though, the time for cooking the chicken was just right.  You could cut the chicken breast with a fork!

Great recipe!  Didn't have any capers on hand but it still came out delish.  Wish I had read previous reviews about cutting down the amount of flour mixture b/c I had lots left over.  A definite keeper and big hit in my house.

This recipe sounded really good, but it was just okay.  My husband liked it more than I did, but I wasn't quite sold on the mixture of flavors... strong lemon flavor and strong herb flavor.  Probably won't make it again, but it was worth a try.

This is an excellent recipe but it is so much like chicken piccata that I only gave it 4 stars.  The lemon overpowers any of the herbs that the chicken is cooked in, and although I love lemon, I would have liked to have tasted the thyme, basil, and garlic because it smelled heavenly as it was cooking.  I will make this again but will cut down on the lemon and add more spices.

Didn't have any capers, but substituted with fresh mushrooms lightly sauted in the chicken butter.  Also, skipped the wine.  But, this was delicious.  A great cold night comfort food. (Makes lots of delicious gravy).

This one is a real keeper.  Simple to prepare, with ingredients most people would have on hand, except for possibly the capers, which I did not have.  I followed earlier hints and cut the amount of butter in half, as well as the amount of flour and herbs/seasonings.  I still had flour left over.  I also added more white wine and lemon juice than the recipe calls for. This was a bit hit at my house, and I will definitely prepare it again and again. Thank you, Valerie.

My family and I loved it!  I've decided to pick the recipes that have a large amount of reviews that are positive and this sure is delicious.  I've never had a caper so I tasted it when I got home.  Yuck!  But when mixed in this recipe  I savored the taste with  the ingredients mixed in, truly a great blend.  I surely don't like lemon peel alone either but it added such a great taste with this recpe.  I'll do it over and over and over and.... again! My kids are sweet freaks and I've been trying to broaden their horizon's so to speak, they loved it!  I am glad I have found another recipe for my family to enjoy. Great submition and definite keeper.

This was definitely a HIT in our house!  I used chicken thighs as they were much cheaper and also added some fresh mushrooms to the skillet near the end of cooking.

My family loved this recipe.  I used 7 chicken tenderloins and shouldn't have doubled the sauce because there must so much left over.  It is wonderful and a great recipe for guests who will think you're a real chef!

This recipe overall was ok.  The flour ends up falling off the chicken after it is done cooking.  I would also use less chicken broth next time because it was really runny and I think I may have cooked it too long because the chicken turned out to be a little tough.  I will try it again.

I found the chicken to be good but I think a little too much seasoning.  The sauce was terrific.  Maybe next time I will try just using Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs to coat the chicken.
Thanks.

I don't really cook much and I made this recipe for my boyfriend for dinner the other night.  It was surprisingly easy to do and it was excellent!  The sauce was AMAZING!  There were no leftovers.  The only thing I would do differently next time is use a little less flour and possibly some egg to make the coating stick to the chicken.  YUMMY!

I served this entree' with wild rice and steamed vegetables at my parent's wedding anniversary reception, and all the guests loved it! As a matter of fact, people keep asking how I made it. It was very delicious. Next time, I'll use less flour as I had a lot left over. It took me a while to make as I converted the recipe for 100 guests. I'm sure it will go much quicker next time.

When I made this the first time my family went crazy for it. Now when I make it i double the recipe so we have some left overs for lunch the next day. We serve it over bow tie pasta or egg noodles. Both my kids love it and always ask for seconds or thirds. This one is a real keeper!!!

I took this to work and hardly got a bite of it.  This is just so quick and easy, and I used fat free mushroom soup and extra mushrooms.  It's a winner at our house.

Fantastic recipes! Great for family as well as company, Love the intense flavor that the lemon brings to this dish. It is a basuc recipe that can be added upon and would also be good with sour cream added just before serving to make it into a Chicken Stroganoff.

Recipe very good but I suggest that you do not cut up chicken breasts.  Good idea to keep half of flour mixture aside for the next time.  Never will use it all for 4 breasts.  Very good and easy.
