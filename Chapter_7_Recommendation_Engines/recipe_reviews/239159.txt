I found it hard to detect the garlic and ginger flavors in the couscous, even though I followed the recipe precisely. Sorry, but I was not a fan, and won't make this again.

I thought this recipe was delicious and super simple!  I did add some chopped turkey meat and leftover veggies  from the fridge to make it a one pot meal.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent!  I was hesitant to make at first, because of other reviews, but so glad I did. If the recipe only added "salt to taste", nobody could ever review this recipe as "bland". It is so packed with flavor, and so simple! Do yourself a favor and try this recipe (with a little Himalayan salt)!

I didn't do ginger but added onion and mushrooms. I need a nice strong garlic flavor and what it called for wasn't enough. Definitely add more next time. Great base to do just about any flavors though. Next time I will try adding shaved Parmesan when serving.

This was great, but, of course, I modified the recipe. I added about a half teaspoon of salt; doubled the garlic, ginger and olive oil; then finally adding toasted pine nuts with the couscous.

This was the first time I ever had couscous and I was so pleasantly surprised.  I can't eat garlic so I substituted the two cloves with 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder.  I didn't have fresh ginger so I used 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger.  The flavor was present but not overpowering and went perfectly with the pork chops I made.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

This needs a bit more flavoring in order to get more stars.  I recommend using vegetable broth instead of chicken and adding some onion or shallot to fill in the flavor.  The cooking method was great and the texture of the couscous was perfect.

Simple but a tiny bit bland. Added Soy-sauce to liven it up and was quite tasty!

The first time I tried this recipe, I didn't have couscous on hand, so I used jasmine rice instead. I just upped the chicken broth to 2 cups and cook time to 15-20 minutes, and it was delicious! This has become my go-to side many nights a week (I *love* garlic and ginger!). Well done!
