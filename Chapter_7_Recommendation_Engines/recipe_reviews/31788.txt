These are wonderful! Reminded me of a recipe my grandmother used to serve before the football games.  I made no changes, however suspect grandma added extra brown sugar and ketchup. I thought this recipe was simply perfect as is.

I just made this tonight and it was great! I followed the recipe exactly.  I did steam some green beans as I felt the dinner needed more veggies, and my husband ended up mixing them in with this.  I tried it and it was great!  Next time it will just be a one-pan meal!

great dish.

Today I made this dish the second time, and it didn't taste as great as the first time.  Maybe it's the chili seasoning, but one thing I always remember is that it's spicy for kids.

I'm not into sweets so it didn't appeal to me personally, but I had a few bites and it wasn't bad. Reminded me alot of sloppy joes.  Hubby loved it and said he'd give it a six, and he hasn't given a five to anything on this website so far.  If you like baked beans and/or sweet meats, I think this will be a definate do over for you.  I have to say the chili gave it some kick for me and the meat/beans for my old cowboy.  I don't see it, but hubby says next time to try and make some hash browns to pour it over.  I'll give an update in a few weeks.    It will go into the rotation per his request.

My husband still loves this recipe, though I definitely kick it up a notch with a touch of some red and white pepper, a little mustard powder and touch of molasses. I like this meal since I watch closely what I eat now (diabetes) and let the hubby eat the biscuits. The beans fill me up without triggering my sugar. That touch of molasses doesn't even register for me. I do substitute a nice smoked turkey bacon and use lean ground beef - organic beans, to keep it healthier. Most recipes can still be good, even when done healthier, and I think this is a classic.

Great basic recipe that can be tweaked to personal taste. I browned some diced yellow onion with the ground beef. Also, I thought it was missing something, so I added some spicy yellow mustard and a little barbecue sauce. Husband had to fend for himself for a couple of days, and he had it over steamed white rice one day, and in hoagie rolls sloppy Joe-style the next. Thanks, Cat!

I was not a big fan of this recipe.  I thought that it was too spicy and would have been better with more substance.  My boyfriend really liked it though so I could just be picky.

Tasty!  The baked beans given them a slightly sweet taste with the spice of the chili seasonings.  Definitely not a low fat recipe with all that bacon, but very good for once in awhile.

This recipe is great. I am a Junior in High school and my Culinary Arts Class had a chili cook-off in January and this recipe tasted really great. We addded a few extra ingredients though, garlic basil and oregano. This recipe landed us a second place prize and our judges said it had the best aroma out of the 10 other entries. Thanks so much for the recipe!

As many have said, this is a sweet chili. I just couldn't get over the strange combination of flavors that didn't really work for us. The young kids didn't like it either. I thought it was weird and won't make it again.

Really liked this one.  Because I know how much spice we like, I just used enough to our tast.  I used bacon that I made myself and my own beans.  Very yummy!!! Thanks for the great recipe

I made this with the frozen bagged veggie burger and turkey bacon and my whole family loved it, including my husband who doesn't even like chili!

This is definitely a keeper.  The second time around, to make this a bit more heart-healthy, I poured off about half of the bacon grease before adding the ground beef and followed the directions from there.  I also used the low-sodium chili powder to reduce the amount of salt in this recipe.  This goes into my personal collection -- many thanks to the author!

This was great. It’s almost like a mix of chili and baked beans! I used a mix of 4 different beans and did season it a bit with molasses and brown sugar plus added some more hot spices. This sort of recipe is the kind that has a great foundation to build on. Even my fussy adult daughter liked this.

01-13-16 ~ A very filling meal, especially when you add biscuits, or in my case, I broiled some buns I found in the freezer with a little seasoning.  The flavors blend together and I can see where this would be a hit made over an open campfire.  I used yellow pepper instead of green pepper as that is what I had on hand.  I had a little extra bacon, so I sprinkled it on top, before serving.
