Hello, I am the creator of this recipe. The goal was to create delicious recipes using Avocados from Mexico. I hope you like it. To lighten the calories serve 1/2 sandwich with a lite bowl of soup for a satisfying and filling lunch.  Make sure to look for the creamy jack cheese, if possible. It makes all the difference in texture, with this sandwich, due to its melting qualities. TY

I'm lactose intolerant so i did not eat this. I made it for my sister in law and she loved it. She went home from lunch very satisfied and with the recipe, so this gets 5 stars from her. Thank you Holiday Baker for the recipe.

I didn't have any jam on hand, so I used a bit of key lime honey to coat the avocado and onion. I didn't use any lemon juice. Also added some cooked turkey breast for a bit of protein. Will definitely make this again!
