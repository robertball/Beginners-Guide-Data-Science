Finally!  I've been searching for a 100% rye bread recipe that didn't turn out like a brick, and this is it!  Very moist and tender.  I didn't have lecithin, so I just used an extra egg white.  Turned out GREAT!

Tried the recipes in my bread machine but was very sceptical that it would work. When it was finished it was only half way up the side of the pan and figured that my first assumption was right and that this was another loaf for relegated as fit only for making breadcrumbs. But when I had sliced the loaf to make crumbs the texture was similar to other store bought 100% rye bread, and it surprisingly turned out to a very tasty loaf, particularly toasted. I will make it again as that my wife prefers to eat gluten free and this loaf is tasty and economical.

This is a wonderful bread... that tastes like real bread. I didn't have lecithin so I substituted extra vegetable oil in its place.. therefore I used 2 2/3 tbs. It turned out perfectly. This is going to become a staple in my wheat-free home!
Also this was my first time using my new breadmaker so I found the cook time of 31 minutes as listed a little confusing. I however followed my breadmaker's setting for a 1.5lb loaf on Normal cycle (with a bake time of just under three hours).

Very good bread. Contains no wheat flour, which
my husband is allergic to.  Easy to make in bread machine.

Excellent recipe, will definitely make again. I doubled the recipe, mixed it in my Bosch machine, baked it in a long rye bread loaf pan at 350 for about 50 minutes. Turned out great!  Yummy and great for my wheat-allergic family :)

My DD said, "This is like cornbread, only rye flavored!"  It isn't a light and fluffy bread, but not a brick either!   I baked this for about 35 minutes at 375.

Very heavy 100% rye bread.  It did not raise and my yeast was good. We could not eat it. I hated to throw it away but crumbled it up and put it in the freezer for bread crumbs. I will go back to my other bread recipe with some flour in it as you need some gluten to make it raise.

Excellent, excellent bread. It has a distinct sour taste of 100% rye that impossible to get in a store. I ended up substituting one extra egg white for lecitin and using 3 cups of rye flour because the dough turned up runny otherwise

It came out flat but cut it and texture was perfect and taste was great!!! Will make it again. 

Not sure if the flat shape look is because I replaced the licithin with one egge yolk.  It anyway came out great!

This loaf came out well except crust top wasn't smooth. Baked on the Gluten-free setting of the breadmaker.  I substituted potato flour instead of cornflour just because it's what I had in the pantry, and an extra egg white instead of lecithin as a previous maker suggested (thanks Bethany!).

You can substitute 2 teaspoons of lecithin with  2 teaspoons of oil.  This would  be in addition to the oil in the recipe.
