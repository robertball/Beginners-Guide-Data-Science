This recipe had a few blunders in it, but after making the adjustments I list here, they were scrumptious.  I upped the amount of pumpkin to a 15 oz. can (who wants to only use a cup?)  I also adjusted the white sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and evened out the baking powder and baking soda to 2 tsp. and 1 tsp. respectively.  I also added 4 tbsp. of veg. oil because otherwise they would have been awfully dry.  For those who don't have buttermilk handy do you know you can make your own using the right amount of milk and adding a tsp. or so of vinegar?  You NEVER taste the vinegar.  Just let it sit for a minute or two before adding.  I also added an extra egg to help with the binding.  I upped the amounts of all the spices to 2 tbsp each of nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon.  After that we enjoyed these very much!

I only had a half cup of margerine so used some apple sauce to make up the difference...and they were plenty moist. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly and found them to be a very nice muffin.  I have made many different pumpkin muffins and i found these refreshingly different in that they don't use as much pumpkin...allows them to be very light in texture as opposed to the usual heavy pumpkin muffin.

YUM!!!  I used 1/4 cup canola oil and 1/4 cup applesauce instead of the butter, and slightly reduced the white sugar.  I think I could further reduce it without much negative effect.  Great recipe!

Followed all of LAURA DIECUTQUEEN's Suggestions, but I forgot to add the butter!  Even with that error, these are fantastic! Kept pouring in Pumpkin Pie spice until I felt it was enough, and added more cinnamon as well.  Added chocolate chips to the last half of the batter.  The 4 year olds tore these up!  And decided to skip their Pancake and bacon "breakfast for dinner" and just eat the muffins (several muffins, I might add)!  (Yield:  24 Full size muffins and 12 mini's)

This is absolutely the best recipe ever for pumpkin muffins.  I started with just making the standard 12, well they were gone before they were cooled off.  So i went back and upped the recipe to 72 and ended up making two batches of 72 in less than a week.  Everyone that got them thought they were wonderful.  It was also an inexpensive thanksgiving gift for work and school.  I included a copy of the recipe (reduced back to 12) and several people have thanked me also.

These turned out perfect!  My five kids and husband devoured them.  I didn't have buttermilk on hand so used regular 2% milk and they were fine.  Oh, and I decreased the baking powder to 2 tsp. as others suggested.  I made more today but used mashed banana as I was out of pumpkin.  Just took them out of the oven and they look great and smell great too!  This is a keeper!!

These were just okay.  I was excited to find this recipe since I had a 1/2 cup of pumpkin sitting in the fridge and most recipes called for far more.  I made this almost as written except that I attempted to enhance the pumpkin flavor based on other's comments and to lighten the recipe.  I substituted pumpkin butter for the butter, tweaked the amount of baking powder and soda as another reviewer suggested, and used a mix of whole wheat and all purpose flour.  I would have liked a bigger pumpkin flavor as it is very subtle in this muffin.  However, viewers are right in that they are quite light, even with whole wheat flour so if you are looking for something more light than pumpkin bread you may like this recipe.  I, however, think I'm going to keep looking for a better pumpkin muffin recipe.

I didn't like this recipe.  It was not sweet enough for me.  My husband thought it was OK though.

Made these for an autumn snack for my daughter's 1st grade class.  Wasn't sure if the kids that age would appreciate pumpkin muffins, but they loved them.  Served with apple cider.

Reduce baking powder to 1 TEASPOON.  I thought these were very good, mild pumpkin taste but plenty of flavor due to the additional spices.

I loved these, though after reading reviews I added more pumpkin and and spices than the recipe calls for. I didn't have nutmeg, so I put in about a teaspoon and a half of allspice, and I doubled the cinnamon. They came out tasting like pumpkin pie in muffin form. I loved them, and I don't even like pumpkin pie!

These are 5 star for sure.  I have made them two days in a row and my kids can't get enough of them.  The only change I made to the recipe was using 1 cup pumpkin and regular milk instead of buttermilk.  I will be making lots of these.  They are great for breakfast.

These were delicous.  I doubled the recipe and made  12 muffins and 1 loaf.  I plan on making these for my daughters Pre-K Halloween party.

I made them with a little extra pumpkin than called for, and i think next time i will follow a few of the suggestions here and up the pumpkin a little more, plus add a little more spice. other than that, i felt they turned out great! they are very light and fluffy made as directed.
