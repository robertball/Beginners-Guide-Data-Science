I thought this was a really good mash-up! Only change I made was adding cheddar cheese inside the tortilla to make it more like a quesadilla.

I liked both dishes individually. Maybe heavy on the carbs together and the cabbage & garbanzos needed a chutney to pull the dish together. The main problem with both recipes as written is the usual danger with Indian food—the spices went in raw and stayed that way. They needed a gentle browning to really meld and permeate the dishes, especially the potatoes and peas. And I’m not sure where you could’ve done that as the instructions are written. I used milk because I was not trying for vegan.
