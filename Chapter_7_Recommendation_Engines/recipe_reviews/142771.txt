Okay I really hate to give a recipe a bad review espically if we just didn't care for the "outcome" of a recipe. This dressing is very thick, and very strong. It really over powers the flavors of the salad. Not what I expected from a vinaigrette. But with that being said I am going to give it a higher rating because it is awesome on grilled chicken and pasta. I didn't want to throw it away so I mixed it in with some left over pasta, grilled chicken, and parmeasean cheese. It tasted almost like pesto but lower in calories and fat. So give it a try on your pasta and skip in it as a salad dressing.

This is VERY thick as written.  You have to play with the ingredients as stated.  I had to keep adding vinegar and oil to this plus a bit of sugar to get the desired taste and consistency.

Everyone loved this! Had with a simple salad of romaine lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, and celery. Did not make any changes. :)

Since I scaled this down to just two servings, I was unable to prepare this using a blender as there wasn't enough there to work with!  So I chopped up everything real fine, then put Hubs to work with a mortar and pestle, which did the trick nicely.  As I slowly drizzled in the olive oil it came together into a nice, rich emulsion.  This was really good - both the fresh basil and garlic are evident, but neither overpowers.  It is thicker than the typical vinaigrette as some reviewers commented, but I had no problem lightly dressing the salad with it.

This is an EXCELLENT salad dressing, but it IS very thick. As I was pouring it into a 'Good Seasons' bottle, I took a cue from that tried and true recipe and added a bit of water. Just 2T was enough to make it smoother, but still hearty enough to cling to the greens. I look forward to trying it on pasta. Also, taste before salting. I opted to completely leave it out.

As a salad dressing, way too thick...as a spread for grilled chicken, roasted peppers, fresh mozzarella and baby spinach on whole wheat hoagie rolls, absolutely delicious!!

Incredible fresh flavor, but I do grow my own basil. I used that, sea salt and fresh cracked pepper corns. I found it  is awesome on chicken too, especially if you add two tablespoons each of minced onion and red sweet pepper.

Very good, I added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar, to cut the vinegar a bit.

Great if you LOVE a strong garlic and basil flavor.  Only takes a small amount on the salad because of the strong flavor too.  No store brand compares to the freshness of this.

I liked this dressing a lot but I agree that it has too much flavor for salad.  I put it over chicken breast and some wild rice.  It was excellent!  I am just experimenting with growing my own basil and was looking for something to make with it.  This was a great choice!  Thanks!

I made this per the directions but I only had the cheap kind of parmesan--it still came out wonderful and so fragrant!  I took it to a potluck and my salad was the only thing wiped out in minutes.  Thank you so much.

My husband loved this dressing. It does have a strong flavor and would be best on salads with meat.  I was making a salad that would have garlic chicken on top so I wanted something that might that some similar flavors. I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried. I also didn't bother chopping fresh garlic and instead used garlic powder. I didn't like the taste of it so I added sugar and lemon juice. After these additions, it was better. I will try it again.

This was fabulous.  I had a ton of leftover basil, so I doubled this recipe and I added a handful of arugula as well.  I dumped all of the ingredients in my food processor, rather than a blender.   I have tossed this dressing with pasta and quinoa for  quick salads.  I'm sure I will continue to make this/versions of this for years to come!

Excellent! I used on a cheese tortellini and was so delicious. I did mix 3 vinagers though.. Little rice wine, apple cider and balsamic vinegar.

Great flavor! I added it to a peach caprese salad and loved it. I did not realize that rigorous blending would make the dressing too thick so I ended up having to add some olive oil and water to get the right consistency. Next time, I will be sure to only blend on low until mixed, about 20-30 seconds.

It was a wonderful change from the other dressings I've made from this sight, which tend to be a little sweeter. I'm not much for exact measurements, so I more eyeballed it, but it's a simple recipe, so there isn't much room for error. Did use all ingredients, as stated, no substitutes. Will def add to my regular dressing recipes. It was simple and full of flavor.

OMG! This was fabulous.  One of the best vinaigrette I've made in a long time. I think I will try using it as spread as someone mentioned previous.
