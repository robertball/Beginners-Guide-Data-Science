I love this lemon soup recipe. I've made it a few times, and never had Orzo pasta on hand. Instead, I substituted rice. (I've used brown rice and jasmine rice -- both are good.) If you're substituting rice, I recommend cooking it first since it takes a while. Then, heat your broth, add the rice, and then add the lemon/egg mixture. Other substitutions: I've used veggie broth and "no chicken" broth to make this a vegetarian recipe. I also really like lemon, so I add the juice of 2 lemons instead of one. This is a relatively uncommon soup, but if you like lemon, I highly recommend trying it out!

Great flavor!! I was in a pinch since my hubby was on his way home and NOTHING was even remotely close to being ready for dinner. I looked up this recipe and was very pleased with the results minus the foamy texture. I substituted lemon juice for the fresh lemon and it was still great. I took it off of the stove  about 2 minutes after the egg/lemon mixture was added. Rather than serving it immediately as the directions state I let it sit for about 10 minutes and stirred it a couple of times. That decreased the foamy texture so that the rich flavor came through without all of the "fluff". I also added soy chicken strips which I cooked first then added into the soup. My husband LOVED it and is taking the leftovers to work for lunch. I will definitely make this again, even if I'm not in a rush!!!

This was 'frothier' than I was expecting, and quite tart. I would make it again, but whip the egg whites less, and use less lemon juice.

Love this recipe! Its a family favorite that Ive made for years.  Just a tip, to add some more flavor I garnish with fresh chopped parsley and love the little burst of flavor it gives!

I have made this multiple times but I don't think it really qualifies as 'soup', especially when I ate the leftovers which had dried out enough to just be a delicious pasta.  I've never had the energy to properly whip the whites but I do what I can by hand and have never had a problem with any frothiness. I highly suggest adding rosemary, it complements the soup perfectly. I also added one carrot, shredded which doesn't change the flavor much but gives the soup a wonderful, warm color.

Good recipe. I didn't whip the eggs at all, or separate the whites. It worked fine!

I recommend letting the soup sit for a bit before serving so that the orzo can fully puff up.

I gave this 5 stars because it's a great start. I made this and when I tested it, I liked it but I thought I could add to it. I started with adding cooked rice as some other reviewers did. I then added a few Tbs of butter,another lemon, cooked shredded chicken, and fresh spinach that I just tore apart and cooked into the soup. If you don't like the froth then just let the soup sit on low for a while and a lot of the froth will go away, I liked it both ways. This soup can be as simple or as complicated as you wish. This will be a great addition to my recipe box! Thanks!

I really want to give this 5 stars for the taste.  I gave it 4 because my entire family was put off by the frothy texture.  I put that aside and ate 3 bowls.  The second day the froth was for the most gone, and it had thinkened considerably and I really loved it that way.  Perhaps then I could get my family to eat it that way.  Thanks for a great flavored soup

Delicious and simple, but I would definitely say serve immediately because it boils down otherwise. And make sure the egg whites are really true stiff peaks; it adds the texture to the soup.

Great quick soup. I guess I don't know what beating the egg whites to medium stiff peaks means, b/c I whipped too long. Soup was still delicious!

Really liked the flavor of the soup but thought that the orzo was too slippery.  I like this exact soup with rice instead of orzo.  Yum!

I made this soup for the first time a few nights ago, and was blown away by how delicious it was. Creamy, full flavored, and light enough to eat as an appetizer, this soup was amazing.   I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and added a cup of white wine to add some extra flavor. I can't wait to feed my friends and family with this!

Super easy & delicious. I usually end up adding more lemon & lots and lots of black pepper. Very good.

My husband's grandmother used to make this for us and it is one of my favorites.  I think the only thing I would do differently is make my own chicken stock (the store bought one was a little salty for me) and perhaps add a touch more lemon juice.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good it did turn out though!!  Perfect for the cool evenings of fall that have begun!

Made this with rice instead of orzo. I added baked halibut and roasted asparagus I had leftover from the night before.  SO GOOD, and so much healthier than a cream-based lemon soup I've used in the past...

This was absolutely delicious.  I had to run off copies of the recipes for my guests before they left! Only changes I made:  I beat 3 large eggs (not separated)and added lemon juice to that; and used 1 pkg. of Success boil in a bag white rice opened and dumped to cook right in the broth.  This is so easy and tasty.  I'll defiitely be making it again and again.

I like this soup because it uses so few ingredients, takes very little time and tastes good. HOWEVER, I don't know if it is because I halfed the recipe or my soup got too hot (?) but the egg mixture broke and it didn't really thicken the soup at all. Also, I opted not to beat the white and yolk seperate, I frothed them together very well as I have seen in other recipes for this soup. Either way it was a great quickie soup!  I added parsley for color.

******EDIT: All of the below, in my opinion was true... but the leftovers were simply DELICIOUS! I'll just make this recipe a day beforehand from now on. The egg-y taste had diminished and the dish tasted well-balanced in flavors.
--------------------------------
I was really excited for this soup... I've had Souplantation's Lemon Orzo soup and was hoping I could re-create something along those lines. However, this recipe, personally I think the egg overpowers the dish. And the combination of the egg and chicken gives it a semi-gamey taste. I did try to counterbalance this by adding some cheese (aged Parmesan and Mozzarella). I also added shredded chicken once it was done (just because Souplantation's version had this included in their soup and I love chicken). If you like eggs and lemon though, I'm sure you'll like this recipe.

Not what I was expecting. The chicken broth was competing with the lemon flavor. Probably won't make this again.

Its a simple soup, you need to add more, like chicken and veggies.  Otherwise its just pasta in lemony broth.  Dont froth the egg whites, just use the yolk or slowly add in the whole eggs.

My last review posted before I was finished! I think of these recipes as guidelines, so I’m happy if they work out for my eyeballing ways! It turned out light and delicious, and my littlest who has the flu loved it. I used 2 cans water in addition to the broth so it wouldn’t have a strong chicken flavor. I also use a couple tablespoons butter and a whole package of orzo. We like leftovers. For flavor I added a few tablespoons of my favorite lemon seasoning and for vegetables I added some chopped kale. I followed the instructions with the eggs and didn’t have any problems with it being too frothy or the eggs curdling. I did only whip the whites until they were frothy- I’m sure that helped. And I added in some precooked, chopped chicken. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was a great base for lemon soup and can be easily modified to fit your tastes. We prefer more of a lemon punch so I just added more lemon. We also prefer less froth so I whipped my egg whites a little less. You can use the orzo or plain ol' white rice. Add cooked chicken or leave it out. Either way this is a good recipe to play with. Thanks for submitting it!!!

My husband gagged at the texture. My kids said it was too sour.  Even after a day, when the texture had gotten less frothy, it still tasted like lemon and raw eggs. I had to toss it in the garbage.

Great flavor!  I wasn't sure how this would turn out but I'm glad I gave it a shot.  I would say this soup is definitely worth trying if you're unsure.

This was pretty good, if a bit bland.  I added some zesty lemon seasoning, garlic, rosemary, and an extra lemon to give it some zip. The egg mixture made it nice and creamy, and worked well with the diced chicken I added at the end.

Just really yummy.  Super quick and easy and so creamy, even without milk.  I toasted a combination of orzo and jasmine rice in butter before adding it to the broth.  I did have a couple bits of cooked egg white, but I just didn't temper the egg mixture quite enough.  Totally my fault.  Will definitely make this again.  :)

From the first time me and the girlfriend made this soup we have been hooked. We make it a little more decadent by adding some fresh crumbled bacon right before serving.

I have been buying a soup exactly like this and was unable to fully replicate it - but whisking the egg whites first then adding the yolk and lemon did the trick!  I absolutely love this soup, it sounds unusual but it is deliciously addicting and yet sosimple.  I also added a little fresh parsley.  I make a batch and keep it in the fridge for the week - I would not recommend freezing it as the egg seperates when you defrost and/or re-heat it.

Very good quick alternative to avgolemono soup (greek lemon soup) which normally takes much longer than this.  This was quick, easy and tasty.  Next time I will probably add bits of carrots or maybe pieces of chicken but this was a great quick fix for me tonight since tomorrow is food shopping day and the pantry is a bit empty!

This is so good!  I've never made anything like this before, so I was a little nervous about it, but it turned out to be really easy and so tasty!  It seems too rich and flavorful to be made so simply!  Don't be scared of this one, it's a real winner!

I used tomato and chicken bouillon cubes and water for the broth and it gave the soup a pleasant pumpkin color and rich flavor. This is a great inexpensive soup you can make with items most people have in their kitchen at all times. I was running out of groceries and was able to prepare this easy recipe with warm baked bread for a wonderful family dinner.

Delicious!  I added a chopped chicken breast.  Next time, I will use more chicken broth, but the taste was superb.

I'm a vegetarian, so used vegetable broth instead of chicken stock. The flavor is great, and the consistency gets even better/thicker for leftovers the next day. I think next time I may try adding some cut up asparagus or a little spinach to round it out a bit.

I had a craving for this soup, which I have had at a Greek friend's home on Christmas.  I was slightly disappointed, only in that it was not frothy and thick as I expected.  However, the taste was light and surprisingly addictive.  This is a healthy soup (I used sodium-free broth) and very filling.  Thank you, Phambabe!

I wanted something light, zesty, and brothy to go with chicken salad and cucumber salad sandwiches.  This was just the ticket!  It is so easy!! I used chicken bullion to make the broth and did not add any salt.  Thank you for sharing!
