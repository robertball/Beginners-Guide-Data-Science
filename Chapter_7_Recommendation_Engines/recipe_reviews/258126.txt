I made these crackers with spelt flour and they turned out really well. I made them with my pasta maker instead of rolling them out, which I found faster and less messy. I  brushed the tops with olive oil then sprinkled on some onion powder and sesame seeds. I didn't bother cutting them into cracker size servings, but left them as long lasagna type lengths to be broken to size as they were eaten. They disappeared in a flash!!

These crackers are very bland, perfect if you are looking for a base for a flavorful topping.  However, it’s very easy to add additional flavors, as I added minced fresh rosemary to half the batch.  I docked the crackers just as a precaution of them puffing up.  Also, I made the crackers very thin and they didn’t need more than 10 minutes of baking, so I recommend checking them often when baking.

i'm rating this a four star even though i tossed them. it's my fault and can't blame the recipe. i feel it has potential, as i have made similar crackers and they were great. i  forgot to add the olive oil, so these crackers were dry and very very brittle. Crack your teeth brittle. i will certainly try them again with ALL of the ingredients and update  my rating.
