So good!!! My fianc√© took one bite and shouted an expletive that I won't repeat here ;) I used much more cheese, and subbed in canned green chiles for the Anaheims, and I will admit that I only drained the meat, skipping the "rinsing" step that seemed to me like it would wash off all of the flavor. I can't wait to make these again!

This recipe is exquisite.  The sauce is absolutely divine.  My family fell in love with this recipe.  I used all 4 colors of bell peppers and my family hates cooked peppers.  Not a bite was left on anyone's plate!

Great kicked up (spiced up) version of an old tried and true!  Never was a big fan of stuffed peppers until now!  Chorizo and roasted peppers made it so much better!

Great recipe! I used vegan chorizo and could have made it all vegan with vegan queso and vegan sour cream!  I did add one 15 ounce can of black beans. The sour cream addition did not make sense. 1/3...16 ounce sour cream? I did not add sour cream to the enchilada sauce but just added it to the peppers before the sauce. Did not add the bacon... Good recipe for stuffed peppers!

Excellent recipe.  I did make a couple of adjustments.  I omitted the bacon (not missed), used a mix of cheddar and pepper jack cheeses and increased the overall cheese quantity to 1 1/2 cups, and used 2 cans of chopped green chiles (mostly drained) rather than the fresh Anaheims.  I also didn't bother to rinse the chorizo and onions - just drained them.  It all turned out great.  I had six good-sized peppers and still had stuffing left over (enough for one more large pepper), so I baked that separately in a small dish and it turned out well and was delicious just by itself.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This was different and tasty and I really enjoyed the enchilada sauce mixture. My only complaint is that the bacon got completely lost in the dish and I felt it was a waste of bacon. The next time I make this I will cook the bacon separately until it is nice and crisp, drain it on paper towels, and crumble it over the finished peppers.
