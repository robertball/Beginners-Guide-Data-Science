This is a great recipe...It's also good with any number of fresh vegies -- asparagus, leeks, and even fresh brussel sprouts cut in half....Make sure the stock you use is warmed before adding it to the rice...This can also be made with vegetable stock...You can also add a little chopped, seeded tomato on top just before service.

This is one of the best risotto's I've ever had, and my partner really liked it as well.  I made a couple of changes according to what I had on hand.  I omitted the chives and parmesan cheese, and also didnt use any butter, just a small spray of cooking oil to saute the vege's in.  I also doubled the mushrooms and garlic.  I ended up not needing all the broth that was stated, maybe 1 or 2 cups less than said.  Also this makes main meals size servings, not just side dish ones :)

This was GREAT! I did make some changed. I boiled the rice in a different pan and I used 2 1/3 c chicken broth and 1 c water. I also sauteed chicken, onions and garlic and added it to the dish. I sauteed the veggies last minute then mixed it all together. WOW!  The hubby loved it.

Delicious. Made the risotto in the pressure cooker to save time and energy (toast the rice in a bit of oil, lock lid, raise temp and bring to pressure, then lower heat to keep just at high pressure, cook 6 minutes, quick release). Also used vegetarian chicken broth and dried rather than fresh herbs since it's winter. I used a dash of tarragon, about a T of parsley, and maybe a half teaspoon of thyme. Tastes fantastic - good recipe, thanks!

An average recipe which is quite easy to make. I would recommend to use non-stick pan, as risotto rice gets burned and sticky easily if you're not stirring it constantly!

This had great flavor...I suggest adding more veggies than it suggests though.
