I donâ€™t like tilapia. However, this recipe changed my mind for sure! I used broccoli slaw instead of the cabbage and onions but beyond that, I kept the recipe as is. For any non fish lover, this recipe will for sure change your mind! This is such a super yummy recipe that it will definitely be made quite often in my house!
