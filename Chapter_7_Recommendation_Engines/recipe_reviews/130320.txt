Wonderful!!! This is also known as "ginataang kalabasa".  I am Filipino, and my mother and I recently made this together. Instead of acorn squash, we used kalabasa (Philippine squash) from my parents' yard.

 A fantastic substitute for the squash is sweet potatoes (peeled and cubed). I browned the tofu before I added the coconut milk. Don't worry if the tofu tastes bland, as it will absorb the flavor of the spices and coconut milk, esp. if you eat the leftovers the next day. I've made this with and without tofu, and I prefer it without. Also, I omit butter and sugar.   

**If you don't have shrimp, you can use chicken breast sliced into thin strips (stir-fry style). Saute the chicken with the garlic, onion, and ginger, then add the coconut milk. **

Yum! I suggest DITCHING the SUGAR and instead slicing an apple and adding at the same time as the squash--was perfectly sweet that way I found. Also instead of tofu and shrimp I modified by slicing my an already seared salmon steak up and adding just before serving (suggest one steak per serving for a filling meal). Was DELICIOUS. Tofu and shrimp would be good too but was fabulous with salmon.

The whole family enjoyed this including the 3 year old and the baby. We did tweak it a bit based on what was in the pantry and for our dairy-free house. Used butternut squash for acorn olive oil for butter and omitted shrimp (just didn't have any). Kept the spices the same. Served over brown rice. I appreciated how easy it was how quickly it came together and how adaptable it was for our needs. Would make again!

This was okay. If I were to make it again I would probably add more coconut milk (or some whipping cream?) to make it creamier. It was pretty thick. Also I added some curry powder and chili paste to this. Without it it would have been pretty bland. Lastly I recommend pan searing the tofu and throwing it later--it was pretty bizarre when just tossed in.

This was lovely. My small children loved it. Great quick low fat family dinner in the week. Used reduced fat coconut milk from Trader Joes to lower calories. It was still creamy and very delicious. Add salt gradually and taste frequently. Also used less sugar than recommended. Flavors are subtle so season carefully. I will make this again. Used silken tofu and it was creamy and added protein. (Peel squash with potato peeler as it is too time consuming with a knife.) Thanks for the recipe!

Different but quiet tasty. I made as directed but I had to substitute sweet potatoes for the acorn squash because that's what I had on hand and I left out the shrimp as I don't eat meat. I had never had anything like this so I wasn't sure what to expect. It tasted nice but when you put it over sticky rice...much better. It has a very mild flavor only slightly sweet and is very creamy and soft tasting. I enjoyed it and will make again. Thanks for sharing!

This turned out fantastic! Perfect to warm you up on a cold day. I tend to skip tofu so instead I cooked up 3 pieces of chicken. I sauted it up with the ginger & onion then let it finish cooking with the squash.

This was okay. I would eat it again but not make it again myself. We did prefer it a bit soupy and served it over rice. We don't eat tofu so I omitted that. My young children ate it because it was not heavily spiced.

I've made this several times now it's so comforting and delicious. I've used light coconut milk as well as half regular coconut milk mixed with half skim milk and both turned out well (though light coco milk was a bit on the soupy side). I don't think that the sugar is needed also I omit the tofu and add some cut up pieces of fish filet (like tilapia or salmon) during the last 10 minutes. I've also used butternut instead of acorn squash and it tasted pretty similar. This is one of the few dishes I've found where coconut milk is not used to make a curry. So delicious!

Liked the recipe quite a bit. Very different but good. Used pumpkin as I did not have acorn squash. Pumpkin also made the dish less stringy:). Thank you for a delicious & different recipe.

Tricky one to review. I don't care for really sweet dishes so left out the sugar but the dish turned out really bland. I added some curry powder and that helped some. I hate to give an average review because it's my fault for choosing a recipe I probably wouldn't care for. Must be a meal for those who like sweet dishes.

I am a vegetarian so i didn't add shrimp and i used fresh coconut milk instead of the can coconut milk i used fresh coconut milk. I love using fresh ingredients the fresh coconut milk gives a very rich taste to this recipe.

I'm on an anti-inflammatory vegetarian diet with no nightshades (arthritis). Wow this recipe tastes great and is versatile. You can make your favorite modifications. Mine: as another reviewer suggested replace sugar with apple slices. I added 1/8c chopped apple to onion saut√©. Added cubed sweet potato and bok choy. I'm looking forward to trying basil or cilantro and some vegetable broth to make a soup.

I made as directed except for an additional can of coconut milk to make it more soupy. My family generally liked it and I thought it was great with the addition of a little sri ra cha chili sauce in my bowl.

Like many other users I browned my tofu before proceeding with the recipe and added salt plus soy sauce and chili paste at the table. Served it with jasmine rice and peanuts. (Frozen French-cut green beans works.) The whole family enjoyed.

Pretty tasty! I omitted the sugar and put in a diced apple--tastes just fine. I also left out the tofu and used a pound of seafood mix (calamari shrimp octopus etc). I was worried about there not being enough coconut milk at first so I added a few glugs of chicken broth (less than 1/4 cup). The squash really breaks down into a nice stew-like consistency if you simmer it long enough--not stringy at all.

I really enjoy this recipe - the first time I made it using yellow squash as an alternative since it was summer and in abundance in my garden. It came out GREAT...so flavorful and was more like a soup. Even my mother who is an amazing cook (dinner parties galore and what not) said "you made this? It's great...you will have to give me the recipe." Another time I made it I followed the ingredients using the acorn squash and it was thicker and more like a stew. I preferred it with the yellow squash instead...was more flavorful! Also I added extra coconut milk. Highly recommend!

I made in my crock pot and it turned out great. I used precooked chicken in place of tofu & added it with frozen shrimp 15minutes before serving. My daughter even went back for a 2nd bowl.

Fast and tasty dish! I used chicken which I put in with the onions and due to my two younger kids cut the ginger in half. I also squeezed some lime in at the end to balance the thick coconut milk taste- it was delicious! I would have loved it more if I could have added all the ginger- next time!

I would give this 5 stars but I made a few modifications that in my opinion improved the flavor. I curried my shrimp when cooking it. I also used green onions instead of regular used roasted garlic and substituted bamboo shoots for the tofu (no way I could get the hubby to eat tofu). I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little kick. We both really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing.
