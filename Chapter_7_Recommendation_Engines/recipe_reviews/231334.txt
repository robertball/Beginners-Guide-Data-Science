This is a very tasty way to make mashed potatoes. I like to use Helluva Good french onion dip and use a little more milk than what's called for. Warming the milk before using it makes for a fluffier potato, imo.

This was a great idea!   It added so much more flavor than using just regular sour cream.   I used Dean's French onion dip and used a little more more milk than listed just to make it creamy.   Also a little tip...I always just throw a large peeled garlic clove in my raw potatoes while they boil.  It fully cooks and mashes perfectly in the potatoes. It gives you a nice mild garlic flavor when you don't have the extra time to roast garlic in the oven.

This was a great twist on mashed potatoes! I wouldn't change a thing. Nice to have a change on regular mashed potatoes.

A nice way to change up the usual mashed potatoes. The adults loved these but the kids weren't crazy about them but certainly worth having again. Thanks for sharing.

This was great! Used red potatoes and left the skins on. The addition of the onion dip really made a difference,

These are great!  This is the first time I've ever used my old school potato masher (and I was a bit wary!), but it worked.  They were smooth and delicious.  I increased the garlic because I always do and I also added some sea salt.  I can't see that I'll ever intentionally make these again, but I would make them if I had some dip I needed to get rid of (when does that happen?!).  Thanks for the recipe (and for the excuse to buy Helluvagood French Onion Dip...)!
