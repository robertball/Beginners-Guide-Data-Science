Excellent, easy, and delicious.  I did use the leeks - and three large leeks measured out to the 6 cups.  I was worried about the large amount of leeks in the recipe, but they were an excellent addition to the recipe and cooked down considerably.  I did use turkey sausage as the recipe submittor suggested.  I also used dried cherries instead of cranberries.  About 3/4s of a 1-pound loaf of white bread produced 12 cups of bread cubes called for in the recipe, which I toasted briefly in my oven as it preheated.  This looked elegant on the table - very impressive.  I baked it alone, rather than stuffing my bird, so I used just a bit extra chicken broth.

Really 4.5 stars because of my "liquid dilemma"...see below.

This is the best stuffing/dressing I have ever eaten. I've never been one to put sausage in my dressing...it just seemed too "unhealthy," but is it ever great! Because I like the convenience, I substitute Pepperidge Farm Seasoned Bread Cubes (any type or combination...white/wheat/cornbread) for the do-it-yourself white bread cubes. Therefore, I don't add any poultry seasoning...but don't leave out the rosemary! 

Here's the one problem I've had with this recipe each time...how much chicken stock to use? Since I make it as dressing (not stuffing, which goes inside the bird), it comes out VERY dry with only 1 and 1/3 cans. This time I went to three cans, but I can't seem to get the amount quite right...it was still somewhat dry. 

Despite my "liquid dilemma," this has been the most complimented on and most requested holiday recipe I've ever used...other than my Bourbon Cranberries!

I got lots of great feedback on this stuffing.  I made it to take to my daughter's Thanksgiving feast at school this week.  I used 4 cups of onions instead of the leeks.  It seemed like an awful lot of onion, but once it was cooked it tasted great.  Because the feast was at lunch time, I made this the night before and heated it the next day.  If anything, I think it improved the flavor because it all had time to meld together.  Just remember to factor in extra baking time if you do this.  It really took quite a while for all that cold stuffing to heat up.  However, it would be nice to be able to make this the night before Thanksgiving and just heat it up on Thanksgiving, leaving more time for all those other dishes that need your attention.

We have served this several years in a row and LOVE it. I do alter it a smidge by adding a little more chicken broth at the end (which I believe the directions forgot to tell you to add in the first place but it is in the ingredient list.) Instead of 1 1/3 cups I add 2 cups. This year I made it with sourdough bread and it turned out divine.

This stuffing was a hit with my skeptical family.  We've been having the same stuffing for so many years, they reluctantly agreed for me to make it in addition to the usual one, and now they are requesting that I make it every time we have turkey.  This makes a big quantity, so I froze half and used it later with turkey leftovers and just needed to remoisten it with water.

Excellent change of pace from the traditional stuffing.  Slightly sweet, yet with a great flavor, I am going to make this one every year!  Note: The stuffing is better if made outside of the Turkey!

I have been using this recipe for 2 years now.....I now have to make 2 pans of it just so everyone can have some. I don't stuff the turkey with it just bake it in the oven. I put it together the night before and add a little extra broth before baking. I use 3-4 cups of leeks and an extra apple sometimes I go to the butcher shop and get orange sausage to mix flavors up. I don't just make it for Christmas Thanksgiving and Easter. I also make it for my kids and they take it for lunch. Thanks for Sharing

This is wonderful, I made it for Christmas Eve and everyone loved it, the only thing is it wasn't moist enough, I would add more chicken stock next time.

This was a great stuffing for our Thanksgiving dinner, very easy to make and delicious! I did use a bag of stuffing bread cubes instead of toasting my own bread which may make it taste even better.

I made this today and only did a few substitutions.  First, I am vegetarian so I substituted pears for the sausage and veggie broth for the chicken broth. I was making a Maple Dijon glazed Quorn brand Turk'y roast to go with it.  After cooking the Turk'y roast for 20 minutes on 425F, I added the stuffing mix and placed the turk'y on top and brushed on the glaze.  I let it all bake for 15 minutes at 400F, added more glaze, then baked it for another 15 minutes.  This made the turk'y and stuffing perfect!  Even the ladies at church were shocked to have a vegetarian turk'y and stuffing there, but it was definitely a hit!

This stuffing had good flavor, but it was crumblier than the stuffing I usually make.  I think next time I would leave out either the apples or the cranberries (not both).

Great starter (and catchall) recipe for dressing.  Not sure why, but most recipes I see insist on the white bread.  Any variety of whole grain or dark bread gives wonderful additional flavor.  The measurement for the onions equals about two large onions.  I used a large wok for the sauteeing, since no large frying pan I owned was going to hold all of those ingredients (and made for far easing stirring).  Also, the poultry seasoning I used included rosemary already so I omitted the additional spice (4t is PLENTY for seasoning).  The recipe also did not indicate when to add the broth which, while obvious to the expert chef, makes amateurs like me a little stagnant with my second guessing.  The sausage could also be omitted for a just-as-tasty vegetarian broth.  Kosher salt makes it all tops.  Delicious!

This was very good. I used fresh turkey stock and mixed orange flavored dried cranberries with regular flavored dried cranberries. I will make this again for sure.

This stuffing hit a home run at the supper table.  The only other item I added was a half cup of chopped carrots for color.  Everyone loved it, even my wife who said it was "very good honey," and when she says that about a dish I prepared, I know it was great.  I will continue using that recipe.  Oh, one more thing, I added another cup of chicken broth to the mix.

It was FANTASTIC! I made this for the family on thanksgiving and everyone keeps talking about it. I double up on the recipe since I had to serve 17 mouths. Plus, I didn't change a single thing in this recipe and it came out great. The only thing I did differently was I didn't stuff the turkey. I baked the entire dish in a casserole pan and it turned out fantastic. I can't wait to make this for Christmas and new years!

I just made this today for us to take to the in-laws tomorrow...  OMG is it delicious!!!  I used the Bob Evans Sage sausage & it is a tasty edition.  I also used onions instead of leeks.  Other than that, I used the rest of the ingrediants as listed...  I cooked it outside of the turkey, so I ended up using 2 cups of chicken broth.  I highly recommend this recipe.  It is easy & like I said, delicious!

This recipe is a crowd pleaser. Your kitchen is likely to be a miss when all is said, but it is worth it. My husband had doubts the first time I made it, but he ate his words. The only changes I make are; 1. I use the pepperidge farm bread cumbs instead of cutting up loaf bread. 2. I use onions instead of leeks. 3. I add a little sage and thyme.

This is the best stuffing you will ever eat! I make mine in a baking dish. I substituted 1 box of Mrs. Cubbison's Herb Cube Stuffing, instead of making my own bread crumbs, and I substituted 1 bunch of chopped green onions for the leeks. I also use 2cups (1 can) of low sodium chicken broth. I've made this 3 times and everyone loves it and wants the recipe! I would caution that the prep time is longer than stated. If you are pressed for time cook the sausage, and do some of the chopping the day before. You will never go back to regular "box" stuffing again!

This is our favorite stuffing recipe, and my husband requests it every year!  I've made a few changes to suit my family's taste -- I use about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of FRESH cranberries, instead of dried ones, and cook them up with the apples & leeks.  I also use whole wheat bread instead od white, and I leave out the celery.  EXCELLENT!

Yum!  I've tried a lot of stuffing recipes, and they never seem to turn out well, but this was a huge hit! I substituted raisins for cranberries, which was great, and used one onion instead of the leeks. Cooked in a casserole dish instead of a turkey, which meant I added at least twice the amount of chicken broth. Worked very well!

Absolutely devine.  I used this recipe at Christmas and plan to make it part of our turkey tradition from now on.  It's a hit with adults and kids alike.

Easy to make. I made this along with the Rosemary turkey and the table raved! It made for an interesting stuffing, as opposed to those more plain. I'm not a dried fruit fan, but this recipe didn't make me turn my nose up; I loved it! I particularly enjoyed the sausage as well -- great flavor!

We had a traditional Turkey Day dinner this year with a twist.  Each item on the menu was prepared from a recipe never used before.  THIS ONE was *AMAZING*.  I'll make this every year forever... I followed the directions exactly and it was a crowd pleaser!!

This stuffing is INCREDIBLE! I didn't stuff my turkey, I just did this in the oven. I cooked for 20 people, doubled the recipe (ish), and used sour dough bread. Even though I made what I felt like was way too much, every bite was eaten that day! The rosemary is absolutely essential.

I left out the sausage and poultry seasoning. It went very well with the roast chicken I made. The cranberries added a lovely burst of sweetness. Will probably use on Xmas Day with turkey.

I made this with our turkey last year and it will be made again this year. My kids do not normally eat cranberries but they loved this stuffing. PS.. I did cook it inside the turkey and used a meat thermometer to make sure it was done.

I give this recipe 4 stars. It wasnt perfect, but was quite tasty. I did not bake it in the turkey which is why it may have turned out a bit dry. I melted butter and chicken broth to pour over the top. I think it would be much better if baked in the turkey.

This was okay. I found it kind of bland in spite of all the different ingredients and herbs.  Plus, it was kind of dry.  I probably won't make this again.

This was the best stuffing I have ever made, because it is delicious and beautiful.  Use it to stuff the Maple Roast Turkey.  What a treat!  I put a portion in the bird, and I used a little bit of the maple butter from Ibby's turkey recipe to butter a casserole dish that I used to bake the remainder. YUM!  My family was delighted! Thanks Ibby!

Very good!  The only thing I would do is cut the amount of bread used in half, and place that in the dish first.  Then cover with the rest of the mixture.  Otherwise, much gracy is needed to soften the bread.  EXCELLENT.  Try her Maple turkey with this recipe, also worth 5 stars.

I have made this recipe three or four times now, and it has come out well every time. I suggest adding more broth tho, to make it extra moist if you bake it in a pan instead of using it to stuff a bird. Even then, make it moist inside the bird so it helps keep the bird moist. I added golden raisins and the cranberrys, mushrooms, and used a yellow onion instead of a leek.

We enjoyed this stuffing,  I added 4 eggs to the mix because I always add egg to my stuffing,  Other that that I followed the recipe.

I guess I just love my dad's recipe for stuffing the best.  I made this recipe last night.  I had high hopes and I was disappointed.  I thought it was a little flat tasting and I know I won't be making it again.

I substituted onions for leeks, and I actually forgot to buy cranberries, but this was still one of the best stuffings I've had. This will be made again and again in my house!

This has become my favorite Thanksgiving dish. Everyone in my family couldn't stop talking about how good it was. I was asked to make it again for Christmas.

I thought that this stuffing was good but that the cranberries really overwhelmed the overall flavor.  Maybe less of them, or subsitute them with mushrooms instead.  I'll definitely give it a try again.  I baked mine in a pan outside of the turkey.

I used this in a roated chicken and a roasted turkey and baked the leftover in a buttery covered dish.  What a hit!  I've made it 5 times and everyone loves it!  I wouldn't change a thing!

I halved the recipe and since I ran out of cranberries, I used dried cherries. I used a local grocery store's european hearth style white bread. Left it out to dry out a bit. The whole thing was delicious. Might have added a bit more broth in my dressing.

Leftovers are a dream!

Overall, this recipe is a keeper!
