I made this for an office potluck and it was a huge hit.  I added a couple minced garlic cloves and used fresh chopped jalepenos instead of canned jalepenos.  Outstanding.  Will be a staple at potlucks and family get togethers.

This recipe is truly perfect as is, but if you like things a little spicier, double the amount of chopped jalapenos (1/2 cup total).

This recipe was delicious! I made some variations to it, however. I did not use the spinach. I used feta instead of parmesan, and I used half sour cream/ half mayonnaise. I added more green chillies then recipe said, but I love green chillies.

This is a must make recipe! Everyone loved it. I took the advice of another review, exchanged mayo for sour cream. I only had mozzerella so I used it instead of parmesan and used 2 cans of artichoke hearts (not marinated) and chopped them. I added a cup a cup of chopped baby shrimp. Added 1 tsp of garlic salt. Baked 45 minutes in a 13x9 pan, served with white tortilla chips. I would never thought of making a recipe with all these ingredients together but it was the best artichoke dip recipe I have ever had.

I forgot to review this the first time I made it, and it was really good that time.  I made it again last night, but I realized I was out of spinach.  While rooting around the freezer I did find some fake crab, so I decided to use that instead.  It was SOOOOO GOOD!  My new favorite dip I think!  I also added a couple tablespoons of sour cream this time, becaus I did find it a little thick the first time.  A 5 star recipe as written, a 10 star my new way of making it!  Thanks for a great one!

Very very good recipe! I added 1/2 cup sourcream along with the mayo to thin it out a bit. I'm going to try adding some sauted onions and red pepper to it next time as well.

This is good. It was a little salty for my taste. I didn't add any salt. I might try rinsing the artichokes next time after draining them. I will make it again.

I used reduced fat cream cheese/mayonnaise and doubled the artichoke hearts. At the last minute, I threw in fresh ground pepper and onion/garlic powder. Huge hit at the christmas party I attended, even a frozen spinach hater LOVED it. I have to say I was skeptical of the green chilies but it was awesome.

I liked this even more than the "Artichoke & Spinach Dip Restaurant Style" recipe. Next time I'll add a few cloves of garlic!

My husband and I loved this! It is essential that you not only drain the artichoke heart can but you squeeze out each artichoke heart to get the liquid out. Also drain the spinach the best you can. Provided this has been done, you will not be dissapointed!

OMIGOSH - so good and was a great hit at a party.  The green chiles gave a nice spice - I didn't even add the peppers - and was a wonderful dish.

All I have to say is YUM!!! I was searching for this type of dip appetizer with a zesty kick to test out before taking to an event and my boyfriend ate 1/2 of it all by himself in one sitting!! I did follow the note below to add some sour cream (1/2 c) to smooth it out and as my own touch, I also added diced onions to the mixture (about 1/2 of large size). I let bake for 30 min, took it out, gave it a good stir and cooked for another 10 min. THEN I placed on top shredded Monterrey Pepper Jack cheese for extra kick and a good layer of Italian bread crumbs for added crunch under the broiler for a final 7-8 min. My boyfriend couldnt' stop raving about this dip! If this is what you're looking for, look no further, you won't be disappointed by this one!

This dip is INCREDIBLE.  I have made it for 2 showers I have thrown recently for friends, and it was a huge hit at both. Everyone loves how the jalapenos give it a spicy kick and set it apart from other hot spinach artichoke dips.  My friend and I are both expecting, and we crave this hot and spicy dip!  The combination of creamy, cheesy, and spicy is delicious!  I make it just as the recipe says, except for one change: I use a shredded Italian cheese blend instead of the parmesan, and use it both mixed in the dip and also sprinkle some on top.  YUM.  I have served it with both tortilla chips and french bread.  It is great with both!

I took this to a gathering last night, and - I hate to toot my own horn - but I had the BEST dish there! Hand down, everyone was grubbing on this dip. I craved it all day at work today, YUM! I made it in a crockpot - on high for 2 hours. Stir every 15 minutes. 
Only changes I made: used 1/2 cup sour cream in place of mayo, and threw in a few extra jalapenos (and a tbsp of the jal juice from the jar). 
This dip is delicious, and will likely be my new Go-To recipe for potlucks.

Pretty good!  These definitely have a kick, which is a nice change.  Too much mayo though...

Amazing dip.  Did as others suggested adding garlic and onion powder, substituting most of the mayo with sour cream and using one fat free cream cheese and doubling the jalapenos.  
It's silly cause it's not the same recipe anymore and I apologize because I don't like it when someone rates a recipe but they changed it.   But you can cut out some fat and lose no flavor.  
I made the whole amount and froze a lot of it for later use and it was still delicious.   
Do not use canned spinach.  It gives it an ugly color and doesn't taste as good.

Delicious!  I added garlic and feta cheese and didn't have green chiles.  I also used fresh spinach.  Next time I will add another can of artichoke hearts and more spinach.

Great dip, I took others suggestion of adding 1/3 cup mayonnaise and 1/3 cup sour cream.  Also added 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp garlic and 2 tsp onion powder just to jazz it up a bit.  Was the hit at the office pot luck, thank you for making me look good!

I made this for a superbowl party we hosted at our house. I thought it was delicious, but the amount eaten wasn't nearly as much as other dishes I put on the table. Maybe it was the texture?

This was so delicious. It has been requested many times since the first time I made it. I use different types of hot peppers, depending on what looks good at the market.

I made this during the holidays for my in-laws and they raved about it. It's super creamy and cheesy and just a little spicy. I would definitely make it again.

Served this at my daughter's recent baby shower and it was #1 delicious, #2 well liked by people who hated either spinach, artichokes, or spicy things. My daughter made me bring home the scraped from the bottom remnants so she could have it later--even though it was the tiniest tupper ware container I've ever seen! Did all of this in the crockpot and it turned out delightfully. Next time I may try it in the oven just to see the difference, but again, maybe not since it's perfect the way I made it!

I liked the addition of the peppers but I think next time I will use only 1 pkg cream cheese and add 8 oz. sour cream in place of it to give it a smoother consistency.

LOVE this recipe!!! I have used low-fat mayo and cream cheese, so I don't completely hate myself the next day, and it's turned out wonderfully every time! If you haven't tried it with green chile, do it! Soooo good!

I found this recipe while searching for a good spinach artichoke dip to make and I loved the idea of giving it some heat.  I did make some variations and additions to it, but the base of the recipe was great.  I did use a combo of mayo and sour cream as seen in other reviews.  I substitued a fresh chopped serrano pepper for the canned chopped jalapenos and fresh chopped baby spinach instead of the frozen kind (which I hate).  I also added a minced shallot and two minced garlic cloves.  This dip was a huge hit and I will definitely be making it again!

Awesome! Better than what we order at resturants!! We sub'ed the mayo for sour cream as other suggested and omitted the green chili's (bc the hubby doesnt like them) and added about a tbsp of minced garlic! Turned out great!! Will definately make this again and again!

I brought this to a friend's party and actually felt guilty that it got the best response of everything served... People wouldn't shut up about it! Added 1/2 cup sour cream; doubled the spinach; used two cans of artichokes (one hearts, one bottoms) because I couldn't find it in a jar; added a few cloves of garlic. Also used mozzarella. Baked about 45 minutes in smaller rectangular pans. You WILL be tempted to eat at least half of it right out of the oven.

I made this dip for a baby shower I was hosting. Needless to say, the dip was the hit of the party. Someone if stole the recipe off my counter. I added shredded mozzarella to the top and baked. I also tore up pieces of King Hawaiian bread to eat with the dip!

It is no lie that this is better than restaurant quality. I followed the recipe pretty well, but couldn't find the green chilies in a can/jar here in Iceland so I upped the jalapeno amount.....but these jalapenos were pretty spicy so it came out fiery! Didn't mind a bit. Actually, this recipe makes a lot but it's so good that it's all gone less than 24 hrs later. One thing I did change was putting only a little mayo and the rest sour cream. Not a big mayo person. Thank you for a great recipe!

Spinach and artichoke dip is a wonderful recipe! My family loves the combination of the spice. They have requested (more like begged) me to make it multiple times. :) I melt everything on the stove top, use unsalted butter, and no mayo.

This is the best spinich and artichoke dip I have ever eaten.  I took it to trivia night at church and everyone loved it.  I changed the recipe and put 1/4 cup mayo and 1/4 sour cream.  I changed the cheese as well using 1/2 cup parmesan cheese and 1/2 cup pizza cheese.  I will make it again!

Excellent! Everyone loved this dip....I used lower fat options in the cream cheese and mayo and it made no difference. I also used a pecorino romano cheese instead of parm and used a homemade pickeled jalalpeno. So very good and really not too spicy although you can def tasted the chilies in this. Great twist. Thanks!

Absolutely love this! Used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo since I ran out of mayo. Rave reviews and lots of requests for the recipe. I made it the first time as written and it was excellent, the second time I made it I added some garlic powder and onion salt to put a little bit more flavor in it.

I made this for Thanksgiving with my enormous family and everyone was RAVING about it. It's definitely got a kick to it which we all loved. My uncle loved it so much that when there was a little bit left over that my mom was going to throw out, he scooped it up, put it in a tupperware dish and took it home :) I've never seen someone want to save dip, so that spoke volumes!!

This dip is great!  I modified the instructions and made the a double recipe of the dip in a crock pot instead of baking.  About two to three hours on low does the trick.  My husband swears he will never want restaraunt spinach artichoke dip ever again!

Perfect for my party!  I used to make a simple, hot spinach dip but was looking for something different and am so glad I found this recipe!  Normally, I spice things up a bit with cajun seasoning.  I forgot this step while making this dip - and am so glad I did.  The recipe was perfect, as is, and everyone loved it.

This was a BIG HIT at tonight's party.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I wanted a larger quantity so I  used 3 (8 oz) packages of cream cheese, an extra 3/4 cup of sour cream, 1 1/2 cups Parmesan cheese,  a 14 oz. can of artichoke hearts, 2 cloves of minced garlic and garlic salt to taste and the same amount of spinach squeezed "dry".  I didn't have Jalapeno peppers, so can't vouch for that part.  I'll definitely be making this again!!

This is BY FAR my most favorite recipe on ALLRECIPES! The only changes I ever make are to leave out the spinach all together and DOUBLE the artichokes. I also add a hand full of feta with the parmesan (...you can't have too much cheese, right?!) It’s a hit at every party. And for Super Bowl? Double the recipe! All the boys will stand around it until it’s gone!! Serve with torn fresh bread or pita chips.

This had some good ingredients, but it didn't come together as I thought it would in texture and taste. I did leave out the green chiles and used small, hot red peppers instead of the jalapenos. We had a ton leftover, and I tried to play around with it yet once again it sits on the table destined for the garbage. Even the spinach lovers who tasted it only had a few bites of it and left alone. :( Guess I'll have to find another recipe, thanks though.

VERY GOOD!!!  I used fresh jalapeno and spicy artichokes.  I cooked it in the oven for about 20 minutes then put the dip in a bread bowl and cooked an additional 15 minutes.  Also served with baby carrots.  Huge hit with the whole crowd!

Good, used 16 oz fresh spinach, cooke-drained-chopped. Used only chilis. Would make again. Made homemade chips to go along with using whole wheat tortillas, spray with olive oil pam, use lawrys seasonings, chili powder, and cajun pepper from watkins. Bake at 400,flip, and cut with pizza cutter. Will try with peppers next time also I think. Maybe even, crumbled bacon in there also.

My picky husband (who hates jalapeños) said it was the best spinach artichoke dip he has ever had! I may have thrown in a little extra seasonings I like (Lawry's , parsley & onion salt), 2 tsps. of garlic paste & more sour cream but with or without those additions this is a five star delicious recipe.  Can't wait to make it again (drooling). Before I baked mine, I topped it with a mixture of cheeses & then a layer of bread crumbs (Panko & Italian) mixed with margarine to give it a nice little crunch at the top. You can see in the pic. it came out looking like a casserole. Thank you so much!!!!

Excellent!  Great bit of heat with the jalapeño was just perfect to spice up a rather typical and yummy spinach and artichoke dip.

I used this recipe for a cooking challenge at work and won first place. Everyone loved it! I followed the recommendation of some other people and replaced the mayo with sour cream. I also sprinkled a healthy portion of parmesan cheese on top.

The chiles and jalapeno add a lot of flavor and the baking seems to make them a little less intense.

Loved this recipe and will make it again. I did make some changes per others comments. Here they are... used an extra 1/2 c. of parm. cheese and added 1/2 c. sour cream. Also, I used 3 large, fresh jalapenos instead of canned. May add more next time b/c I like more kick. I mixed everything the night before then baked it about 45 minutes the next day. YUM! Thanks for sharing.

I loved it! If you love hot dip make this recipe.  Not a good recipe for whimpy people that don't like it hot.  I heated up in the crockpot to take to a party and served it with gluten free crackers....delicious (I do think that next time I will add some sourcream to make less thick).

Made this for pre-thanksgiving snacking and received rave reviews from many people. I suggest using a bit more spinach/artichoke (or less mayo/cream cheese)...I think a bit more substance and a less creamy-base-items would have made it even better.

I added garlic to mine and put a thin layer of Parmesan and italian cheese blend to cover the top... My husband took it to a company pot-luck and he said it was gone within the hour! And... I had doubled the recipe!

The best! I took it to a tailgate party. I had never made it before but I went on the great reviews that it had gotten, I doubled the recipe. People could not get enough of it. This one is going in my recipe box.

I made a double batch for my housewarming party and it was a huge hit!  I opted for fresh farmer's market peppers though.  Turned out great!  I highly recommend this!

Very, very good.  I did make a couple of adjustments.  I substituted miracle whip for the mayo because I didn't have any on hand and I omitted the jalapeno peppers.  Everyone loved it.

this was very good, only different thing i did was add 1\2 c chopped fresh jalapeno in stead of 1\4 c. but it does need to stay hot, makes dipping more easier and tastier

Great recipe! Brought it to dinner at a friend's house and it was a bit hit! Only thing is I thought it was a little thick. Next time I may take the advice of previous reviews and take out some of the cream cheese and replace with sour cream.

I'm a big fan of spinach and artichoke dip, and I've tried my fair share, but this is hands down the best one I've ever had! I made it for a small dinner party, and they gulped it down and asked for the recipe to make for their next dinner party. I made it the day before (without baking it) and left in in the fridge, so all I had to do was put it in the oven. I didn't realize that the jar of artichokes I bought only contained 6oz. To ensure balance I also halved the spinach. Based on the other reviews, I used 1 1/2 times the jalapenos called for to add some extra kick. I used fresh shredded Parmesan cheese and sprinkled some on top before baking it as well. Considering how good this was, I plan to make it exactly like that again next time.

I made this for our superbowl sunday party, everyone loved it!! I didn't have to change anything about it. Next time I might make it a little spicier just because I love spicy food, but there is no other reason to change this recipe up!! awesome!!

I got a little over excited with the hot peppers and it came out too spicy for the party (it was perfect for me).  This recipe makes a lot.

This was unbelieveable!  I have made many different types of spinach artichoke and this was by far the best.  I used fresh jalapenos and added chopped water chestnuts cause my family loves those too.  I also subbed sour cream for the mayo and it was fab!  I also added a cup of Mozz chesse and it made it even creamier!  THanks for a great recipe!

This dip is fantastic!  I wasn't sure if it would be as spicy as we like it but it's was a nice blend.   We had some extra and i stuffed chicken breasts the next day.  Unbelievably good- thanks!

I usually make an artichoke dip for parties and I loved that this one called for jalapenos.  It was delicious and a nice twist on a classic recipe.

I haven now made this half dozen times.  Everyone loves it.  You can make it as spicy or as mild as you want.  I'm not sure the mayo is actually necessary and I have used 1 box cream cheese and 1 box of neufestel (sp?) cheese for a slightly less rich taste.

I cooked this in a 9 inch round pan, which worked well. I used 1 8-oz package of fat free and 1 8-oz package of Neufatchel cream cheese. I also used fat free mayo and 1/2 cup fresh jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced. It was fabulous! Didn't really look browned at all when it was done, though... and I left it in the oven for more like 40 minutes.... everyone still loved it, though!

This is a fantastic appetizer and similar to a recipe passed on to me.  The variation between this recipe and the one I have is the addition of 1/2 tsp of garlic, 1 small onion finely chopped, and 1/2 c sharp cheddar is added.  For an extra kick, 1/8 tsp Cayenne is used instead of doubling the jalepenos.

I loved this dip.  The addition of green chilis and jalapenos give the dish a taste of spiciness with out the burn.  It was great for a group of different people.   I baked the dip in a 9" pie plate.  It needed to cook for 40 minutes in the pie plate.

This was super good!! I doubled the Jalapenos and had to added shredded colby cheese to the mixture about 1 cup.  I didn't realize that we were nearly out of Parmesan. I also subbed a drained can of spinach for the frozen.  THIS WAS SO tasty and SO EASY! Printing off copies of the recipe to give to friends the requested it. Oh by the way, my husband loved it and he won't touch spinach or artichokes! go figure

Followed the recipe exactly except used about a 1/3 cup of fresh chopped jalepenos.  Excellent!  The superbowl party goers loved it.  Next time I'll try adding even more jalepenos for more zip!

Got many rave reviews over this recipe - For my notes for next time as I cannot find a place to add notes once you save the recipe - I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 cream cheese -  I used jalapeno sweet and hot peppers and diced them up in a manual food chopper vs the chiles - I also added garlic powder and onion flakes..  I made half what the recipe called for and it was perfect for a party of six.  I did, however, use 3/4 of the 8 oz box of spinach - My guests told me the dip was restaurant quality. Next time I think I will try adding fresh crab meat.

This was amazing! I did as other reviewers 1/3 c mayo 1/3 c sour cream. Could have used a bit more spinach but overall delicious. Has so much more flavor than traditional spinach dip. I did not think this was spicy-it's good for the masses. I would add more jalapeños next time because I like things spicy. This will be my go to spinach dip!

This dip is ALWAYS requested every year for Christmas and it doesn't last long.  I've made this dip more times than I can remember and I've always gotten rave reviews.  This is one recipe that I've never changed, it is PERFECT as it.  

 One tip that I might be able to provide is that over time I've figured out that it tastes best when served with pita chips or warm baguette slices.

I could tell just by reading the ingredients that I was going to love this recipe - what I did not expect was how much it was loved by party guests when I made it as an appetizer. This dip was the highlight of the night, and there was absolutely none left over. I served it in sough dough bread bowls and there wasn't even a piece of crust left.

I also used Romano instead of Parmesan, but that's simply a personal preference.

This is good but not my favorite.  I like dip with more of a pronounced flavor.  This one is very mild.  It would be very easy to spice it up to anyone's flavor buds.

I think this is one of the best artichoke dips I've  ever tasted. It's  rich and creamy  and nice and thick, the way I like it. I made the recipe exactly as written with one exception. I used only jalapeños due to the fact that the can of chilies I bought turned out to only contain brine. Total bummer, but it was still delicious!

I am serving it tomorrow for Super Bowl Sunday. I'm going to say right off before serving it tomorrow that if its anything as good as it is right now BEFORE heating, I'm going to make this once a month. Or at least for any reason and event I can think of!! I chopped in my ninja fresh spinach, fresh jalapeño, the artichoke, all separately. I sautéed the spinach and roasted the diced jalapeño. Threw in the remainder of my shredded Manchego cheese, and of course all other ingredients from the recipe. Topped with a handful of chopped green onion. All ready to go into the oven tomorrow
!! Very excited!

I used half cream cheese and half neufchatel cheese.  I used half maynonaise and half sour cream.  I also topped it with Panko bread crunbs and parmesian cheese.  It was excellant but a bit thick, will add a bit of liquid next time.

This dip was amazing! I will  be making it again and again. I added another bunch or spinach ( two FRESH bunches) and one fresh jalapeño without seeds ( not a fan of the frozen and canned stuff) and it was amazing, i couldn't stop eating it. It's great with celery sticks if you are doing a low carb diet too!

This is a really great dip!  I made it exactly as written, and my husband I devoured the entire dish while watch football.  I mixed it up the night before, refrigerated it covererd overnight, an heated it up when football was starting up.  We both enjoyed it very much.  It would be good a lot spicier too :). Thanks.  Will use his recipe a lot!

I made this yesterday and my boyfriend and I thought it was way too thick! So today, we collaborated and came up with some changes. We puréed the dip with chicken broth until the consistency was more to our liking. Now, we're about to eat our second helping! Sooooo good!

I made this for football Sunday & everyone loved it! I didn't have chiles or jalapenos, so I substituted a small jar of diced pimentos (drained). I threw it in my mini crock pot and let it cook on high for a couple hours & then turned it down to low. Everyone loved it! We ate it with pita chips & tortilla scoop chips.

Took to a party and it was GONE!  FAST!!  We used 1 pkg cream cheese and 1 tube goat cheese, 1/4 c. mayo and 1/4 c. sour cream, no jalapenos (as the hosts don't like spicy food), fresh chopped spinach, and 6 cloves garlic chopped.  Obviously this is one of those recipes that you can take liberties with and it still turns out absolutely Delish!

Had a couple other mommies over for an afternoon of wine and appetizers and decided at the last minute to make this instead of the other recipe I usually use on this site. They LOVED it! One said she wasn't a fan of artichokes, the other said she didn't care for spinach...both couldn't stop eating it.  I sent them home with the leftovers and they polished it off that evening.  I used one block of reduced fat cream cheese, one container of chive and onion cream cheese, added garlic, opted for light sour cream instead of mayo, and sprinkled a little extra parmesan on top to give it a bit of a golden crust...it was delicious!  The jalapenos I used were angry little things, so they gave it quite a bit more bite than I expected, but it didn't slow anyone down. (Be mindful of the amount of seeds in your jalapenos...the seedier, the angrier!)   I've been asked to make this again for our next get together.

Delicious! I took this to Christmas dinner and it was devoured.  For the past several years, the Cougar Gold cheese and crackers was the first appetizer to disappear from the table at holiday meals, but this time they went virtually untouched until this dip was gone.  I chopped up two fresh jalapenos instead of using canned and chopped a bunch of fresh spinach instead of using frozen.

This was pretty good.  I added garlic, because I love it.  Made in slow cooker - cooked on low ~3.5 hrs then on warm for the party.  People wanted to take leftovers home so I guess that's a good sign!

This was great! I'll never buy a frozen spinach dip again. I did add garlic. And added 1/2 cup sour cream and reduced the mayo to 1/4 cup. Used reg. canned jalapenos. Next time I think I will use the hot ones.

Outstanding spinach and artichoke dip!  I think it had to do with the addition of the chopped green chilies and the jalapeño peppers.  I took this to card club, and it was a hit.  Also took some to school where they gobbled it up.  There was some “heat” due to the chilies and I used a fresh jalapeño rather than jarred.  You can control the heat by using as little or as many jalapeños as you like.  I used 1 small jalapeño and the dip had some zip without making it too hot.  My other change was using fresh spinach rather than frozen.  I cooked the spinach in the microwave and drained and squeezed until I got the water out of it.  This will now be my go-to recipe for spinach artichoke dip.

I made this for my daughter's baby shower.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe.  It was a huge hit.  I served it with sliced baguette bread and when we ran out of that we added Bruschetta flavored pita chips to the tray.  It was all good!

Amazing!  I used a 14oz can of artichoke hearts instead of a 12oz jar of marinated ones.  Next time, I wouldn't add the green chiles and just increase the jalapeños as we like it SPICY!  I don't like dips that become really dry once cooled so I added 1/2 cup of sour cream and it was perfect with Tostitos Scoops chips.  Can't wait to make it again for the SUPERBOWL!

Really delicious. Used light cream cheese (neufchatel) and it was fine. The rest of the recipe I did as written. It's delicious hot with pita chips, and it's spectacular the next day, too, cold out of the fridge as a spread for a sandwich or on rice cakes. I think I might top some baked chicken breasts with it for dinner. Very tasty and versatile.

I made this recipe a couple of nights ago, and my husband and I thought it was great! I love regular spinach artichoke dip, but with the green chilies and jalopenos, it was even better. I was a little afraid the jalapenos would make it too spicy, but it was just the right amount of heat for me. Since there wasn't a lot of jalapenos or chilies it was a nice surprise of spice when you got a bite of them. I'm sure I will be making this again soon. Thank you for sharing the recipe, Wrightwood Girl!

Big hit at our party.  I heated this for about 20 minutes in the oven as directed, then put it in a small crockpot to serve at our party. It was devoured and I received several compliments.  I followed the directions but did add garlic powder and some onion salt.

Made a 1/2 recipe with extra spinach and artichoke packed in oil, not water. Omitted canned green chiles and canned jalapeno and used 1 SPICY homegrown jalapeno, very finely chopped, instead, but I couldn't taste the heat unfortunately. I also think my pan was too big for a 1/2 recipe and it was dried out a bit. Next time, I'll try a full recipe in the same small blue glass pan or find an even smaller pan.

Great dip for a lot of on-hand ingredients.  To make it richer, next time I think I'll mix in a half cup of mozarella in addition to the parmesan.

Super easy Delicious. . Used half parmesan and half pecorino romano. You can add garlic if you like .Adjust cheeses to personal preference. Recipe easily doubles. I froze some for later was perfect. Hubby and adult kids loved it. Had to go back to store for  more baguettes! Going to try adding Shrimp in the next batch.

Well, let me just say this about the recipe: it was the best spinach, artichoke, chile dip I have ever tasted. With just the right amount of spice and the amazing flavors you can end up with a dish that is unforgettable. Make it, try it, don't forget to drain the juices, and it makes a great amount with fantastic flavor. It is in my fridge, just not for long.

Yum! I made this for a class potluck, and the class LOVED it! I served it with chips and would have been all gone had I not run out of chips. I followed some other recommendations and used mostly sour cream instead of mayo and added some minced garlic.

I also tried adding some bread crumbs and shredded parmesan on top for some crunch! It was a nice texture addition, but I think I needed to leave it under the broiler a little longer at the end to get the cheese topping to melt. Yum! Will definitely make this again! :)

I made this recipe as directed and overall, it was good. Next time around, though, I would add some milk along with perhaps some monterey jack shredded cheese. The dryness of the recipe as it stands made me think of spackling. But very good flavor! Just needs some work on the consistency.

SO good!  Just made for football Sunday and my boyfriend devoured it.  He's obsessed with jalepenos!  I did top with a little mozzarella and creole seasoning, and it was delicious, definitely adding to my football snack rotation!  Thanks!

I couldn't have asked for a more flavorful spinach/artichoke dip. My family absolutely couldn't get enough of it. Like some of the other reviewers, I substituted sour cream for the mayonnaise. In the future, I will likely add more hot peppers to the recipe. We love spicy food and eat it frequently, so our tolerances are quite high.

This dip is fantastic!  I altered the recipe just slightly, since I didn't have jalapenos around the house I substituted 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper, and used sour cream instead of mayo.  This will be a staple at parties from now on!

I made 3 dips for a backyard BBQ party.  All 3 were hot dips kept in a 3-tier crock pot/warmer.  This one was GONE before the other two were at the 1/2 way level.  So many raved over this!  Didn't change the original ingredients - and made as shown except transferred to crock pot and then kept on warm.  Wonderful!

I changed this a lot based on what I had on hand, but think it would be great no matter what.  I only used 1 package of cream cheese, used 1/4 c. mayo and 1/4 c. sour cream, added a teaspoon of minced garlic, used less than half the green chiles, fresh jalapenos, extra artichokes, 2/3 a small can of crab, and some extra parmesan sprinkled on top.  Very yummy!

This was great! I will add the full 7 oz of jalapenos next time to make it spicier. I used the sprinkle parmesan one uses for spaghetti and was fine. I also added a generous layer of mozzerella cheese after it was finished cooking and put it on broil til golden brown. SO GOOD! SO EASY! Everyone loved it. Thanks!!!

By far the best spinach/artichoke dip I've made. I like things a bit spicier, so I doubled the amount of jalapenos. Used artichokes in water instead of marinated and fresh Parmesan is a must!

amzing, amzinag, amazing!!  Loved this dip!  A spicy twist to the traditional dip!  I added some Parmesan cheese and garlic to the mix and served with sourdough french bread and tortilla chips on NYE and it was a huge hit!

Excellent dip - I also followed the advice of others and used mayo and sour cream and I also added more jalapenos for a little more heat.  I was asked for this recipe from many at the party.

This dip is SO good!  Followed the recipe exactly, it doesn't need any changes (if you want a lower fat/cal version you can use fat free sour cream instead of mayo).  I made this with sour cream for someone who doesn't like mayo and it tasted the same so may use sour cream from now on to save on the calories.  Topped with a little extra cheese and broiled after baking.  Also, was out of canned jalapenos once and used fresh instead, it added a nice crunch.  This is requested at every party!  I serve it with homemade pita chips - so good!

LOVE it! Hard to screw this one up and absolutely delicious. This would be fine in the crockpot although i baked mine in a 9X9, I let it bake about 15 minutes longer because of the depth and I like the golden crust of cheese - as I said though, pan size, temp, cooking time are pretty flexible on this one, all you are really doing is melting the cheese so it all blends together. I used mostly mayo (not miracle whip!) with a few tablespoons of sour cream based on suggestions. I may or may not want to make sure your jalepenos and marinaded artichokes are not 'pickled'. I read the ingredients and picked ones that did not contain the vinegar. The non-pickled jalapenos have a lot more kick so just add them to taste. you also may want to chop the spinach a little more after you ring it out so you don't end up with long strings (just depends on the brand). Everyone loved the dip, great with white corn tortilla chips or ritz flips (pretzel/cracker combo).

Made this weekend for a potluck.  I didn't have a chance to taste it unfortunately, but since it went quickly I assume it was good..added 1/2 cup sour cream as another reviewer suggested as well as 3/4 cup of grated asiago cheese and about 4 cloves of garlic minced and reduced the jalapenos by half (4 guests who won't eat spicy food).  Will make this again since it went over very well.

This recipe was a huge success with my friends.  The jalapeno peppers really give it that extra kick.  If you are only making this for a few people, you might want to cut the recipe in half, as it makes enough for a very large group.

I constantly get this is better than restaurant complements. I double the green chilies and add a cup extra fresh parm. I also double the marinated artichokes. Just be sure to get ride of extra oil or the whole this will come out oily.

I love this dip!!!! I prepared a double batch in the morning before a barbecue I hosted, refrigerated it and then popped it into the oven later in the afternoon. Served with whole grain tortilla chips, it was gobbled up in a very short time. I will definitely be saving this recipe!

this was so good! not as thick as i wanted it to be at first but after refrigerating it and reheating when I wanted some it thickened up nicely. I love the slight spiceness. The only thing I di different was use reduced fat cream cheese and mayo.

This is wonderful! I made it for a Super Bowl party last night and it was the only thing that was completely eaten! Such a hit! I have used another similar recipe over the years, but this is much better. The proportions are just right. This will be a staple in my recipe box from now on. Thanks!!

Impress with this dish!  After reading over the suggestions, I made the following changes - Instead of two blocks of cream cheese, I used one and about a 1/2 cup of low-fat sour cream.  This dish was super tasty!  I even had a friend tell me she could never eat another artichoke dip again because it just wouldn't be as good.  Try this one for sure - you will not be let down!

Perfect! I was tempted to put in the entire 4 oz. can of chopped jalapenos, I'm glad I didn't. We like spicy, but it was just right to appease everyone's tastebuds as-is. I used reduced-fat cream cheese & mayo, and a regular 14 oz. can of artichoke hearts, not marinated. I also used a three-cheese blend, parmesan-romano-asiago. Yummy!

I took this to a party this past halloween and everyone loved it, I even had to pass the recipe along.  I substituted the cream cheese and mayo for fat free and it didn't sacrifice the taste.  It was a spicy, so if you don't like spicy this is not the recipe for you, a great alternative to the same old dip.

I used canned chipotle chiles instead of jalapenos, and didn't use any mayonaise. It was the BIG hit at our open house - I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Very very good!  I, also, added garlic.  Next time I will bake it with some tortilla chips on top.  It was SOOOO YUMMY!

edited 11/18/13: I have made this recipe at least 50 times and am now under strict orders to make it at EVERY single gathering. We've tried different things and found that we prefer tortilla chips the best. The added salt is just YUM! I usually double the recipe which adds to the cooking time. It makes good leftovers, too. A staple in my house.

Definitely cured my spinach dip craving. This is even better with the added kick from the jalapenos and chilis! I used reduced fat cream cheese and light mayo. I also used one whole jalapeno, chopped along with the jarred. Delish! Thanks for the recipe! I will make this again and again:)

So good! Loved the zip that the chilis and jalepenos added. I make spinach and artichoke dip all the time, but loved the addition of the peppers. I did add some chopped garlic, and instead of the second block of cream cheese, used extra mayo and sour cream for an additional zip! Wonderful!

I hate to review this considering the changes I made, but the basic dish is excellent. Sometimes, depending on the crowd and/or simply what you have on hand, recipes don't always get followed to the letter...so here goes....

I made this for my daughter who at 43 years old still hasn't managed to get over her childhood hate of spinach! That said, I left it out, but doubled the artichokes instead, using bottoms rather than hearts as this is what was in the cupboard. And not being a fan of mayonnaise, I substituted the same amount of sour cream as a replacement.  

The dip was a huge hit at her party and was gobbled up fast! For "crackers," I thinly sliced a fresh baguette, brushed each piece with olive oil, and baked for about 10 minutes. YUM!

Perfect amount of spice! I threw it all in a crockpot and it turned out great. Definitely a keeper.

I have made this many, many times. I sup chopped green chilis for the jalapeno (for guests) and add garlic. This stuff is addictive and always the first app to go.

What A Hit!!! This dish was the biggest winner and first to go at our potluck. Everyone kept going back for more!
I added some crushed red chili pepper to add additional dimension. Also, I added an extra 15min of bake time to create a crunchier top.

I used only jalapeños in this and everyone loved it. It is good at room temperature too. I took it to a pot luck party and not a single drop was left.

I wasn't sure which Chili peppers to use, so I just deleted the Chili peppers, but used the green chili's.  People told me it was the best spinach artichoke dip they had ever had.  Otherwise, exactly as written.

Everyone loved it. I didn't change any aspect of the recipe. The only change I would consider for  the next go around would be to add sour cream to thin it down just a little bit. It was a definite crowd pleaser though for all who ate it-a definite make again.

Favorite dip so far.  It has a little zing which makes it that more yummy.  I also added a can of water chestnuts for some crunch.

This recipe was great!  I took it to a Christmas party and I got so many compliments on it.  They were also asking me for the recipe.  I didn't add the jalepeno peppers, and I added 2 cloves of garlic.

I made this and it was delish but I did make changes.  
Instead of Jarred artichokes, I used 2 cans artichokes, drained, rinsed and chopped
Added 2 or 3 cloves garlic, pressed
Added 5 ounces or so pepper jack cheese, shredded
Added 2 fresh jalapenas, seeded and chopped.
Everyone loved it!

Excellent recipe - it had great flavor.  I halved the recipe since there were only 2 of us, and chose not to add jalapenos, but did use the green chiles.   I thought the addition of the green chiles  really gave it great flavor.   I live in New Mexico, so I had Hatch green chiles I got freshly roasted, then froze, during chile harvest season in August.

Everything about this recipe is right... the cream cheese, the mayo, and especially - the jalapeños.  I like to serve this dip on sliced sour dough baguette. It’s a family fav, and an over-eaters delight! I don’t know who you are Veronica, but “thank you, girl”... you’re my kinda chick ;)

This recipe + modifications from other reviews + modifications for what I had in my kitchen resulted in: 2 packs of cream cheese, 3 packs of frozen spinach, 2 drained jars of artichoke hearts, a little salt and fresh pepper, 3 fresh jalapenos - seeded and soaked in water to reduce the heat, 3 cloves of garlic, and Greek yogurt instead of mayo, 1 5oz tub of parmesan cheese, and about 3 oz of feta cheese.  I'm making some bread in the bread maker to go with it!

pretty good, but there is way too much spinach in this recipe, so it turned out hard and dry. theres not enough creaminess and too much spinach. I will use this recipe again but with half the amount of spinach.

I'm not much of a cook and this made me look really good.  I added a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice and subbed 1 can of Rotel for the peppers. I mixed it all in a bowl and let it sit for a couple of hours in the frig.  Baked it in a crockery pan for an hour at 350.  Very easy.

Love this recipe! My family and I agree, very tasty! The only tweak we make is less mayo, only like a few tablespoons, and use sour cream in its place.

Made as directed. It was good, but bland. The only real flavor was the heat from all the peppers. I was hoping for something more restaurant-style and this, while OK, was not it.

Wow.  This is really great.  I don't like to use frozen spinach so I wilted my own.  I chopped 2 pounds of baby spinach and wilted in 1 tablespoon of olive oil with a pinch of salt.  Then drain in a colander while I prepared everything else.  I substituted 1/2 of the mayo for sour cream.  also added a tablespoon or so of chopped garlic.  Once I had it in the baking dish, I sprinkled the top with parmesan so that it would get a nice brown crust.  Served with French bread slices that I toasted with oil.

I've made this a few times for various occasions and every time it's a hit. The recipe is forgiving so don't worry about exact amounts - you can adapt based on how spicy you like it. People constantly ask me for the recipe. Definitely a favourite!

Served hot at church coffee hour with "scoops" multigrain Toastida chips.  A smash hit.  Everyone came back for more.
Great dish.  I used 2 Tbsp instead of 4 Tbsp of jalapeno just because of the mixed ages in the group. 
 
So easy, so delicious, so flavorful.    Classic!!! Thank you.

I get requests for this dip to bring to parties constantly. I add extra jalapeños because I prefer more heat, but this dip is amazing as is! Thank you for sharing! I also add imitation crab meat on occasion and sprinkle mozzarella cheese on the top the last 5-8 minutes of baking.

Love it. I left out the spinach, added 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, and sprinkled smoked paprika on top before baking.  Used both the green chilis and jalapenos.

I made this tonight for my brother in laws 50th birthday party. It was a crowd pleaser! The only things I changed was halving the amount of mayonnaise and substituting it with sour cream. I also added 1 additional (6.5 oz) jar of artichokes per my preference. I forgot to take my cream cheese out to soften so I put it in the microwave for about 30 seconds and then added the mayo and sour cream, folding it over until it was smooth. Hands down the best Spinach Artichoke dip I have ever tasted, and I am quite the connoisseur of this dip. I also put this in a slow cooker on high for 1 hour and then turned it down low for another 2 before the party. I will definitely be making this again.

Turned out great!!! I added a few dashes of hot sauce, pepper, and garlic salt to give it more flavor... Added freshly shredded pepper jack cheese to melt on top... Next time I might use hot chiles and hot jalapeños to zest it up!

I made it exactly as written. I worried that the jalapeños might make it TOO spicy, but they give it just the kick that had been lacking in standard artichoke dip. This dip was gobbled up by both kids and adults! It's a winner!

This recipe was great! I did add some garlic but otherwise I was true to the recipe and it went over very well! Next time I make it I will consider adding some liquid as it did harden quite a bit as it cooled.

This was sooooo good! I made it for a party and it was devoured. I didn't think I'd be able to handle the spice of the jalapenos (I used canned this time and I normally make sure to get all the seeds and membrane out - I'm a wuss) but it was delicious! The cream cheese cut down on the spice nicely. I added a few cloves of minced garlic, half a cup of sour cream and a little bit of onion powder. Also a little extra spinach, and mozza cheese (just because my parmesan was expired). This is my new favourite dip! It has a nice kick without being too spicy. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!!

Excellent dip.  Substituted some of the mayo for sour cream and used fresh peppers and added fresh garlic. Thumbs up from my family!

Excellent. It would be difficult to come across another spinach/artichoke/jalapeno recipe that was better than this. A couple of changes I made, just because I didn't feel like grating fresh cheese, I just bought a bag of generic walmart shredded parmesan cheese. Still melted in all nicely, and made it easier. Also, I like a little more "hot" jalapeno dices, so I put a little more in mine. I also used half mayo half sour cream, and sprinkled some garlic powder in it. The overall change, I'm sure, was negligible. Easy and very very tasty. It made more than I expected, and me and the 3 kids ate every last bite. Thanks.

I make this all the time especially for the upcoming holidays!

However I tweaked the recipe with removing the mayo can add Greek yogurt in its place for added protein.  Use extra jalapenos with a touch of the juice & artichokes in ours.  Can sub canned spinach which is quicker to remove liquids.  We are garlic fanatics so we add either dried or fresh depending on what is at hand.  Also use shredded Italian blend cheese if no yogurt to add flavor .

I like the kick with this one.  Instead of jalapenos from the can/jar I used a fresh one and next time will be adding two!  I made for a few guests and everyone enjoyed it.

The first time I made this, I made it as-is, and it was excellent! The second time, though, based on other reviewer's suggestions and my own personal preferences I did switch it up a bit. I used half mayo, and half sour cream. I used fresh diced jalapeños because I love them, and threw in some real lump crab. Because of the lack of vinegar from the pickled jalapeños, I added some garlic salt and Old Bay seasoning to taste for a little extra kick. Let me just say that with my changes this dip was PHENOMENAL!!! Easily a new favorite. :)

I made this recipe for the first time for a family get together. I added some fresh onion and jalapeño (I dislike canned and jarred jalapeño) and a little extra spinach than it called for. It has become a big hit and have already been asked to make more by my husband who turns his nose up to artichoke and spinach.

I make this dip for almost every party I host of get invited to and every time I get asked for my recipe! This is THE BEST spinach dip around! Better than any restaurant I've tried. Only thing I do differently is use a fresh, seeded jalapeño pepper. Try it with homemade artisan bread or Xochitl tortilla chips.

This was delicious. To keep it egg free (a person at the party has allergies) I used sour creme instead of mayo.  I also sauteed some garlic, though I honestly don't know if that added much.  Used fresh spinach and jalapenos.

I modified the recipe a bit right away so maybe this rating is a bit high - I used only one pack of cream cheese, the written amount of mayo and added 1/3 cup of sour cream. I also used only a 1/2 pack of frozen spinach (chopped fine) and a 1/2 can of artichokes also chopped fine. I didn't use any canned chilies but, I did usea 1/2 tsp of cayenne powder and 1/2 fresh jalapeno. Finish with mozzarella on the top and serve with warm naan bread...yummy!!!

this was the best artichoke dip i have ever had! i don't like it when people make this kind of dip very mayonnaise-y, so this was perfect! and the jalapenos add a nice kick.  This one is a keeper.  Easy to make and delicious! thank you!

This is my favorite dip recipe.  Like everyone else, I changed it a bit.  I use Neufchatel instead of full fat cream cheese and increased it to 3 packages.  I also increased the mayo to 3/4 cups.  I make it for every event I attend.

I had such high hopes and made this for company based on all the rave reviews.  What a disappointment.  I followed directions as stated except I did add 1/4 cup sour cream as others suggested.  This was just not good!  Maybe it was the kind of parm cheese I used?  Will not try again.  Sorry, really really wanted to love this.

Fantastic! Easy to make. I used fresh jalapeños instead of canned and next time I'm going to try with fresh spinach and extra jalapeños to make more spicy.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because its so thick and not easy to dip up with chips.  Taste was great though.  If I can just find some way to make it more creamy it would be a five star for me.  I did substitute 1/4 c. Mayo and 1/4 chip sour cream for the 1/2 cup mayo.  Put it in a 9x13 pan covered with foil.  You essentially just need to get it warm throughout.  Don't cook it too long or else it dries out even more and becomes thicker.  Next time I might just put it in a 2 qt. foil covered casserole dish and cook it for 45 minutes.
Thanks for the recipe!

omg, SO GOOD. Made beer-bread to go with it. They were perfect for each other! Half way through the recipe, I realized I was looking at the wrong one, therefore I had some extra ingredients by mistake. Onion and garlic sauteed in olive oil, along with the spinach. Turned out to be a great mistake though. I'll probably keep the onion and garlic in it when I make it again :-)

This was good, but kind of bland.  To add more flavor, I added two cloves of minced garlic, garlic salt and red pepper powder.  

I used one package of low-fat cream cheese and one of non-fat cream cheese, and it still tasted as rich as needed.

This was very tasty. The only change I made was to use 1 fresh jalapeno. I probably could have used 2, but I was worried that my book club ladies wouldn't like the extra heat. We ate it warm with Tostitos scoops chips.

I did omit jalapeno pepper, and used low fat cream cheese. Delicious! The classic spinach-artichoke dip is always a hit wherever I take it.

This is great!  I added 2 small cans of water chestnuts and 1 small can of mushrooms.  I also topped with Mozzarella cheese.

Fantastic artichoke dip with just a little spiciness to make it great!   Easy to make it more or less spicy depending on your likes.

Outstanding!  I omitted the jalepenos since some of us do not like that much heat and it was still to die for!!!!

Very good.  I didn't add the green chilies and felt the jalapeno peppers added just the right amount of spice.  My husband really liked this recipe.  I served it with bread and chips.

I made a small amount of the recipe as described and stuffed chicken breasts with the dip. It was pretty good but it had a pickled taste even though I rinsed and drained the artichoke hearts. Next time I will probably use fresh jalapeños and rinse the artichoke hearts more. Overall a good recipe!

Yummy! This was great! I think next time I will add garlic and another pepper. I added crab the first time I made it- I think that was a mistake, the flavor is better when made as directed. Great recipe!

Good used fresh spinach as others have, have to squeeze the life out of the spinach no moisture is needed.  I used Brined artichoke heats as marinated are to strong for this dish.  Really good with fresh veggies and chips.  I used lowfat Cream cheese, still tasted great.

Fantastic recipe!  Used low-fat cream cheese and mayonnaise and still tasted amazing.  Also added 1/3 cup low-fat sour cream.  Definitely 5 star recipe!

This is very good! We had raw veggies, tortilla chips, and french bread on the side, and it went well with all of them. I'd like to try making it with fresh rather than canned/frozen ingredients next time and see how that turns out. I think I'll add a little more spinach, as well.
