These go by many names and I’ve tried a number of different recipes and variations. Every time I make them they are well-received; not only delicious, but conversation pieces as well!  They make plain old scrambled eggs a little more special and a little more festive.  (In fact, I’m thinking these just may be part of my Christmas breakfast menu when my whole gang comes home for Christmas) There are as many variations as there are ingredients you can think of to put in them!  Chopped zucchini, broccoli, mushrooms, shredded cheese, bacon – all would be delicious.  I adjusted the ingredients in this recipe to suit my tastes – for half a recipe, 4 eggs, I used 1/ 2 cup ham, about 2 T. each of finely diced red pepper and red onion, fresh minced chives, and about 2/3 shredded cheddar cheese.  I also added a splash of milk. What’s important, I think, is to finely chop your vegetables to make sure they cook through in this brief cooking time and to make sure the muffin cups are filled almost to the top.  I used silicone cups sprayed with Pam, and filled them with a 1/4 cup measuring cup.  A four egg recipe, given the additions and proportions of ingredients I chose to use, made six muffins.  I baked them just till set and not wet looking, about 22 minutes.  A teeny dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of minced red pepper and fresh chives dressed them up real pretty.

These are great for big and little hands.  I like to add chopped mushrooms and then saute' them lightly with veggies in a bit of butter before adding to egg mixture.  This ensures that the veggies are not crunchy when muffins are done.  My grand kids love to grab one and eat it on the way to the bus stop, daughter either eats one on the way to work or saves it for mid morning snack.  I love them cold.  Good stuff and my Sunday Morning Brunch Bunch requests them when brunch is at my house!

Easy fast and pretty tasty too.  I had to use yellow peppers, didn't have red. I scaled this back to 2 servings but still ended up with 7 egg muffins.  I used a standard sized cupcake pan which I sprayed well with cooking spray.  If you make the full recipe plan on getting more than 8 egg muffins.  Thanks for a good breakfast, Becki.

These were a hit, even for the pickiest eater in my house, my 50-year-old "child" (lol). I was looking for a healthy grab-and-go breakfast that I could eat on my hour commute to work. These did the trick. I change out the ingredients to keep them from seeming like the same old thing. I've tried diced ham, bacon, different cheeses, onion, peppers, tomatoes, olives, chicken, spinach, and the list goes on... On the weekends, I bake them, slide them into single serve freezer bags, and HIDE them in the back of the freezer or they are gone before the week starts. Thanks for a great recipe.

I LOVE these muffins, and even my very picky daughter would eat them (that's a major score in my book!!!). Great to reheat in the morning for a quick and healthy breakfast.. Followed the recipes modifications outlined in Naples 34102 review (you clan NEVER go wrong following her feedback!). Added a little more than 1/3 cup each of finely chopped red pepper and onion, along with a Cup of finely chopped ham and roughly one cup shredded cheese to the 8 eggs.  Added a splash of milk, filled using a 1/4 measuring cup. It made 17 reasonably-sized muffins using lightly greased (using non-stick spray) silicone muffin cups (these things are awesome, easy to clean & nothing sticks).   The possibilities are endless with this recipe...thanks for sharing Becki!!!

This recipe is really good but I can say that it's NOT Paleo because we don't use bacon, sausage or ham in Paleo because of the salt & sugar contents. But I use chicken instead and it is great

Parchment cup liners are the answer if you are having trouble with these delicious egg muffins sticking.

Cute and yummy!! I made this using bacon, breakfast ham, and cheese based on my kids' omelet preferences. My only issue was that the omelette muffins stuck to my muffin liners a fair amount so next time I will either use better muffin liners or spray the liners with non-stick cooking spray. Thanks for a great recipe this is one of my new breakfast favorites!

I made exactly as stated.   The taste was great.   I had an issue with them sticking in my pan sprayed with olive oil Pam but that was probably because they needed cooked a couple minutes more.   My oven always cooks a little under-done.   I actually got 10 muffins and I had filled the cups full.   The leftovers are going to get frozen and then reheated in microwave with a bit of cheese sprinkled on them.

Made this recipe this morning, it was good.  Made as written although I used milk instead of water.  I have a larger muffin tin pan therefore using 4 eggs it made 3 larger servings.  My husband ate 2 with toast, I had 1 with a slice of toast and we found the portion sizes to be just enough.  I found the baking times to be accurate  with this recipe.  Will make again in the future, thank you for submitting this recipe.

These were so good and easy and adaptable. My husband is such a brat when it comes to leftovers...I made these with 2 cups of leftover chili (drained) and about 3/4 cup of mexican cheese and they were so good! I froze them to use for breakfasts. I can see using any meat/cheese/veggie combo...even possibly rice or potato. I'll be able to hide leftovers without him knowing it ;0).

I followed the recipe exactly, and they came out great. My son loves eggs, and this is another exciting way for me to give him eggs in the lunch box. I some times add bacon or sausage instead of ham, only because thats what I have on hand that day. I also experimented with other veggies and it seemed to work every time. Thanks for a great recipe.

I love this recipe. i used 12 eggs, and 1/2 red pepper, 1/2 orange pepper, 3 green onions, and ham. I also added some hot mustard powder, about a tsp, and some Gruyere cheese, some Parmesan and sprinkled with grated old cheddar before baking. I also whipped the eggs before any additions and they rose up like Yorkshire Puddings. Light and fluffy on the inside, so delicious. I got 12 medium muffins. Going to freeze for my son while I'm on holiday. Thanks for the recipe

As a naples34102 believer, I tried this recipe.  I added my own favorites, using diced green chiles, onions, ham, a bit of diced diced roasted red peppers, sautéed mushrooms chopped, everything we like.  I did all that the night before, and put in fridge until breakfast this morning.  This morning, I used five eggs, a splash of water, and a palm full of shredded Colby Jack cheese, mixed it all up, tossed in last nights goodies with some salt and pepper, used 1/4 measuring cup to fill muffins papers, sprayed a bit first.  It made six DELICIOUS little omelets !!  My husband asked when I could make more.  He wants them daily. Lol. They are super easy, and as good as the ingredients you use.  Use what YOU like.  You can make each one different, if your making for picky people, or a crowd.  Just put the egg in each cup and a little bit of what your people want in them, spinach and cheese only, just bacon and onion, all meats, ham bacon, sausage, three kinds of peppers... There are as many possibilities as there appetites.  We will have them often.  Great way to use up some veggies!  Thank you Becki, and thank you Naples. :)

Good recipe-- I only have mini muffin tins so this recipe yielded 28 little mini muffins. I cooked at 450 only because I misread the directions, but it worked well. THey were done in about 10 minutes. This seems like a pretty healthy recipe as is, but I would like to add a wee bit of cheese next time.  I think there is a lot you can do with this.  It's a nice alternative to quiche, which is really not something you can eat everyday. I plan to make with cheddar and broccoli next time, and maybe something with mushrooms.
Thanks for this nice recipe-- I do feel like it was missing a little something, but I am totally going to play with this and add stuff to it.

This recipe is really good, but I changed it up for my needs. I do NOT follow a Paleo diet, but liked the idea of these muffins. I substituted the ham with chicken sausage w/dried tomato and basil. I skipped the onion (only because I didn't have any) and used a green pepper instead of red. I also added a half cup of sharp cheddar cheese. Even my husband liked it and he'll hardly eat anything with peppers in it. Next time I make it, I will add the onions and may add a few mushrooms or chopped tomatoes to the mix.  We loved it with the chicken sausage so we'll keep it in there. FYI...I learned they became soggy after  storing them in plastic so I wrapped them in foil and they kept much better.

These turned out pretty well, but I made the mistake of not using cupcake paper liners in my muffin pan and it was a nightmare to get clean, so don't forget to do that! I liked having them on hand each morning, ready to just pop in the microwave for about a minute and enjoy.

Very good. I'm going to play with the vegetables and meat additions to suit my family, but the concept alone deserves 5 stars. Take&Go breakfasts that taste great are hard to come up with, and this one is perfect for all of us and has endless possibilities. Thank you!

Delicious. Have made this several times with bacon and once with sausage. Very versatile recipe. Have added shredded carrots, mushrooms, etc, whatever I have on hand. Can add whatever spices you like.  Very nice paired with a slice of cantaloupe or watermelon and rye toast

I love this recipe!!  I put quite a bit more vegetables in though.  I have used broccoli, peppers, spinach, kale, carrots, zucchini, squash sweet potatoes not much you could not use.

I first saw your recipe when our oldest was about to start kindergarten this fall. I made these then and have been making them since! I make a huge batch (16 eggs) and we store them in the fridge all week.  These are perfect for my 2 year old to eat (dairy allergy) and so tasty. I even add chopped kale and spinach. I've seen some reviews saying to cook the veggies first or chop then super fine. I disagree, but I like my veggies crunchy and barely cooked, to retain more nutritional value.
I will warn against not using baking cups. Even when sprayed really well, my muffin pan was a nightmare to clean.

These were pretty good. I topped with salsa to serve. They also did well freezing and reheating.

Excellent recipe with lots of possibilities. I added a dollop of sour cream to the egg mixture, makes the eggs fluffier, my taste. Thanks for sharing.

Should definitely have read comments! Only fill about 1/4 the way, or you'll have a mess. Delicious but I overfilled the cups and had a bit of a mess in the bottom of my oven. Used what we liked and had on hand.

I loved this! And it's so convenient because it comes in a muffin. I added mushrooms (I like larger pieces) and spinach and I think I'll make them a cup each next time. I also used New York Style Sausage Company ground sausages and almond milk instead of water.

These were delicious. I used onions, tomatoes and ham. The only bummer was that the cup liners I used stuck to the muffins and were difficult to peel off. The second time I made them I sprayed with Pam and used a higher quality foil liner.

I make these on Sunday and freeze them for the week. I use whatever leftover veggies that I have in the fridge. I work full-time and my husband is retired.  I take a couple out of the freezer each day and he microwaves them for one minute and makes a couple of slices of toast and has a complete breakfast!

I thought they were very good.  Since they could be frozen and eaten later, it was even better.  When I searched the paleo menu or diet, it called for fish, lean meat, shrimp or other sea food, this I'm not into. I'm glad to be able to add what I like and still have my tasty breakfast.

Great easy fix for a quick breakfast or pretty on a buffet table. Very tasty and lits of pissible variables for ingredients. I used a T. of sour cream on the eggs to give more flavor and stability.

I used 5 eggs, broccoli (which I precooked in the microwave), red pepper, and celery.  Because of all the veges, I got 9 muffins out of it.  I sprinkled feta cheese on top before baking.  Delicious and easy!

It did not taste like it looked.  My muffins stuck to the pan except for the 9th muffin that I used a silicon muffin cup. I used 1 cup of onions, too much onion, it added liquid to the muffin and made the muffin mushy even after cooking it 10 minutes extra.  I microwaved 4 Jimmy Dean frozen sausage patties and broke them up.  I did not use any cheese but if I make this recipe again I will definitely add cheese.

I followed this exactly. It filled 12 muffin cups not 8. It took 38 minutes to cook through. The filling adhered completely to muffin liners and the only way to eat it was with a spoon.

Had to try these.  They were even better than expected and sooo pleasing to look at.  I did saute the onion and green pepper (I didn't have a red) and added chopped mushrooms and Mexican blend cheese.  I will make again and again.  Especially when we have company for breakfast. My husband put some salsa on his. I didn't need anything extra. I sprayed the muffin pan with Pam and didn't have any problem with them sticking. I did run a table knife around the outside edge before taking out of pan.

I cook breakfast for my girlfriend's friends when they come to town. These were a quick, delicious hit with them. I only used peppers, onion, and cheese. This is a really easy recipe to tailor to your own liking, which I see myself doing in the future because I'll definitely be cooking these again!

I don't know WHAT I was thinking.  These looked cool, so I got all excited and made them.  I really do not like my scrambled eggs mixed up with anything at all.  Why could I not see that this was just an "omelet in muffin form?" LOL!  It even says omelet in the recipe title!  

So, if, like me, you like your eggs unadulterated, pass this by.  Plus, it was watery, tough chewing, and way over top on the onion!  And I LOVE onion.

Putting these into paper liners does not work. The wet egg adheres & cooks to paper, therefore, can not peel off to eat.  Suggest using silicone muffin cups or grease your muffin tin. Taste is good, but I excluded any salt, as the ham (or bacon) added enough salt for the portion size.

The concept is really great and they tasted good.  But they just didn't hold together very well.  I used muffin wrappers....they were very hard to peel off.

Love these!  I make a double batch on Sunday and my family and I eat them all week for breakfast- microwave for 1 min. to reheat.  Super easy & healthy way to start the day.  I use precooked chicken sausage w/ bell pepers and add a little salsa on top.  My kids like to put them on a corn tortilla will a little cheese.  I had issues with them sticking to the muffin liners and it was difficult to clean the egg out of the pans when I did not use the liners.  I couldn't find parchment cup liners, so I now tear small squares of parchment paper to line each cup and it works perfectly!

I cut this recipe down for two and wound up with six portions. When I first took them out of the oven, they looked beautiful, about thirty seconds they had completely deflated! They were difficult to remove from the muffin tins, and they were bland.

I did not care for these. The texture was watery and I thought they lacked flavor. Followed the recipe exactly and it took 35 minutes before even going in the oven.

What an awesome idea! I love making omelettes but never once thought to try baking them in muffin cups.
I'm not technically doing Paleo, just looking for healthier ideas and tips and this certainly qualifies.
However, I had to add just a little feta cheese, herbs (you have to have tarragon with eggs), used chicken instead of ham as that's what I had on hand, and added some diced mushrooms. This is ultra versatile and you can use any omelette recipe and alter it for this baking technique. It's sort of like an omelette meets fritatta in a muffin cup.

I added chopped fresh spinach and made them in a mini-muffin pan. Delish!

I found these a bit dry - added caramelized onions and were much better. Took about 30 minutes to cook (even without the onions).

Wonderful! I didn't measure the ingredients (except the eggs). I bought a Kentucky sliced ham and cut up 5 medium/small slices then cut up a medium sized red bell pepper.  I made sure to really blend the eggs with a mixer so they fluffed up then stirred in the rest of the ingredients.  I didn't use muffin liners, just sprayed a muffin pan with PAM (liberally) and poured in the mix.  The chunks of ham and pepper don't pour out so use a spoon to scoop it all in to each muffin pan.  This made 10 muffins for me. I filled the batter up to just below the line.

These are very good but I would NOT bake them in paper muffin cups. I made these for a fundraiser and the eggs stuck to paper so I couldn't use them. :(

I love this recipe. I make them on Sunday for the rest of the week. I like to add mushrooms and saute the veggies before I add them. I also like to add some chives to the beaten eggs. This recipe is easy to make substitutions and changes to keep it fresh.

This recipe has great potential! I think I'll saute the onion and bell pepper a bit before adding to the eggs next time; even diced small these veggies were a bit too crunchy for my taste. I baked the muffins for 18  minutes, and they came out a bit dry. Apparently my oven runs hot, so I'll watch more closely next time and remove as soon as middle is set to prevent over-baking. I greased the muffin cups with a spray, but they still stuck to the bottom. I'll use liners next time. My husband and I loved the flavor, so I will definitely try these again!

I make a dozen of these on Sundays, keep them in the fridge and heat them up every day for breakfast. I substitute Egg Beaters for a lower cholesterol and use whatever veggies we are in the mood for. A bit of cheese crumbles are delicious in the mix as well.

These were very tasty, but I think I would leave out the water next time. Next time I would add cheese and Cheyenne pepper for some spiciness. These made 12 muffins, not just 8, but that's a good thing :-D

Delish. Very good flavor, and nice and fluffy. I will definitely use muffin cups next time though, cuz it still stuck pretty badly to the pan even after spraying it like my bangs in 1985.

Easy recipe, did half whole eggs and half egg whites. Also substituted sweet Italian sausage for the ham. Great for that quick morning grab and go.

I was looking for a quick breakfast to go that was low on carbs and this recipe fit the bill! I don't eat pork, so I cut up some Cajun deli chicken slices into small pieces and for the onion I did 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. green. Definitely glad I chopped the veggies on the small side so they were cooked through. I only wish I had greased a muffin tin rather than using paper liners . . . they really stuck to the liners. Will be making these again . . . looking forward to some variations, next I'm thinking spinach and Feta!

My daughter and I made these on a whim and they were delicious! Added bacon...everything tastes good with bacon...and garlic to a bag of frozen onions and peppers. Cooked for 15 min in mini muffin tins and had the best snack for the  whole day! We couldn't stop popping these when I walked past them on the counter!

The first time I made these they were good, but I felt like they were lacking a little flavor. The second time I made them, I first sautéed the onion and veggies  in a pan to bring out the flavor, then added them to the egg mixture and baked it. Much better! I highly recommend doing this. Great low carb on the go breakfast!

My husband rated this an 11!  Because of his heart disease, I used a mixture of eggbeaters and egg whites and cooked it for 24 minutes.  We loved the sour cream idea on top.  I served with some sliced avocado and halo orange sections on the side.  It made a beautiful presentation and very heart healthy.  So easy.  I know I will make these in the future when we have overnight guests.

I line the muffin cups with sliced deli meat......usually chicken.
We serve these at a nutrition breakfast  program for school children.  Make them with cheese and a little paprika sprinkled on top for colour and flavour, to die for.

This was recipe was as smooth as described.  Since some of my family is meat free, I went all veggie which worked well.  The one thing mistake I made is that without the ham (or bacon), I probably needed to add more salt/seasoning to the mix.  Definitely will be experimenting more with this recipe.

Great healthy recipe. I do not make it paleo as I add low-fat cheddar cheese. Great for a quick grab and go breakfast. I package them in Ziploc bags ready to go for work. I have made these for a group breakfast and received rave reviews. I have also frozen them but they lose some moisture. Better to just refrigerate and reheat in the microwave.  Great base if you want to add other vegetables or types of cheese. I have put them in paper muffin cups which did not work very well. However I would like to try the foil muffin cups to see if that works better.

Followed the instructions exactly this first time. Know your muffin tin/liner size - and do not fill more than 2/3 full. Mine leaked all over the oven filled with 3/4 full. Delicious but if I make again, I won't fill as full. I may partially cook the veggies. Great idea and lends itself to many variations.

I liked these muffins quite a bit and found them very useful for some ready made protein. To increase the protein, I added cottage cheese to the batter (mixed in a blender the cheese was undetectable and resulted in a very creamy like batter).  Finally, some prep issues I encountered:  the batter bled through the paper cupcake holder and once baked, the muffins stuck to to the paper a bit.  Next time I will use at least 2 cupcake holders and spray them with Pam prior to filling (I did not use the tin holders because I wanted to be able to warm the muffins in the microwave).   Finally, I. found that the muffins took at least 5 minutes longer to bake. This may be unique to me because I live in a high altitude area.

Tasty, but I cut the amount of onions by half and subbed cooked bacon for the ham. I also don't think I'm a Paleo person. I want to stir in grated Parm and half 'n half next time.

I followed the exact recipe. The only difference was that I didn't have muffin tins, I only had cupcake tins and so the recipe made 12 cupcakes instead. These did not finish baking within 18-20 minutes; it was still very running at that point. I think it took me about 30-35 minutes to cook. I didn't taste them until the morning after, and it was pretty good. It exceeded my expectations. Calculating all of the ingredients and the portioning, two cupcakes came out to be 152 calories. Very healthy, filling, and delicious breakfast.

I made these with 6 eggs, jalapeño cheese and lots of veggies- sautéed spinach, onion, and halved cherry tomatoes. I baked them for 18 minutes and they were great. A fairly quick, homemade, healthy breakfast everyone enjoyed on a Saturday before heading out. I am limiting my carbs so I will be making these little babies again.

Great recipe! Quick and easy and you can mix in whatever you have around the house. I always add about 1/3 cup of salsa and cheddar cheese along with some type of meat (bacon, salami, kabase.)  These are great hot or cold too. This recipe was instantly a family favorite. Thank you!  I am going to consider buying some of the silicon baking cups (other reviewers suggested) specifically for this recipe though so I do have the problem with sticking to the paper baking cups.

Fantastic. I made a few changes and used: 7 eggs; half each of a whole green pepper, red pepper, and yellow onion; and 6 baby portabello mushrooms. I kept the ham the same. Lots of pepper, just a dash of salt. Diced the veggies. Sauteed all the veggies + ham beforehand to ensure they were cooked. Used Pam to coat a nonstick muffin pan. Put the veggies + ham in the pan, then poured in the beat eggs (this ensured all the ingredients were evenly distributed). This approach yielded 9 omelet muffins.

Of course, if yours are runny after cooking for 20 minutes, cook them longer! Mine took 30 minutes.

Only had 6 eggs so I made the serving size 3 instead of 4. Used bacon instead of ham, and spinach instead of onions. Saw a review that the recipe was runny/watery so I only used 1 tablespoon of water, and then did 1.5 teaspoons of milk. Didn't use any seasonings until we ate, I left that for my family to decide for themselves. Batter filled 2 (twelve) mini muffin pans (so 24 mini omelette muffins were made). Bite sized, big hit! Stick a toothpick in them, and you've got yourself a charming hors d'oeuvres!

Taste good,just as expected. They will get rubbery/dry if cooked too long. I put a bit of cheddar cheese on top half way through cooking. Leaving out onion works well too. I think its less mess than traditional scrambled eggs and great for cold mornings to use the oven!

I made these so that they are Paleo, I used all natural Mexican chorizo (no additives or preservatives) and I baked them for 25 minutes instead of 20. I had to improvise on how I made them as I didn't have onion or red pepper so I added garlic salt (omits the other salt) and used green pepper, also added some chopped fresh Jalepeño. ( had to use what I have) They are delicious!!

This is an easy and very tasty breakfast recipe! I use whatever veggies and meat (sausage, bacon or ham) I have on hand. I do freeze any extras so that my hubby and I can warm them up later in the microwave and have a hearty breakfast-on-the-go.

I would suggest NOT using paper liners.  The egg stuck to them terribly, and when I peeled them off, I lost a lot of egg - such a waste.  I followed the recipe exactly, and they were mushy on the inside. Only good part was the top.

These are good, easy and great on-the-go breakfast food. The recipe is actually one of the first (and I mean, really first--literally 40 years old) Weight Watchers recipes. There weren't many back then. I was in high school and this was one of my favorite things I was "allowed" to eat for breakfast. It omitted the ham, and added just a very small amount of shredded cheese. They were called Breakfast Muffins or some such thing. Anyway, thanks for bringing it back. I've thought about them several times over the years.

Just made these, my 3 year old daughter helped. I love them.  I like the presentation in the muffin pan and so many variations you can make. I used turkey sausage crumbled out of the casings and I added mushrooms and shredded cheese.  Next time I will line my muffin tins because they did stick a bit (I had used butter to grease the cups).

These are great for a special breakfast instead of just plain eggs. Next time I will spray the paper baking cups, the muffins stuck to the paper. I used the full recipe , added fresh chopped spinach,and ended up with 10 muffins. Will definitely make them again.

Great recipe but I changed the serving from 8 (shown) to 12 and it gives me 24 eggs? I think the original serving size must be set for 4...maybe needs to be fixed?

This is a great recipe.  Followed it to the "T" but very versatile, add the veggies you like.  Convenient for the " on the go" person.

Turned out delicious, however we doubled the eggs and kept everything else the same. And I will use baking cups next time! My husband was not happy with the cleaning process of the muffin pans. Oops. Oh and I added chives also.

Pretty good muffins to make ahead, freeze and microwave on busy morning. Followed recipe as written, except added 1/2 c Queso Frezco cheese and about tsp of sriracha for some added zip!

Be careful when using muffin cups because they got stuck even after spraying them (we used regular sized muffin tins and tiny tins). The taste was great, we would recommend using less veggies because they were sort of overwhelming even after doubling the amount of eggs.

These were good. I put a little cheese on top like some others did.  I didn't have any  paper liners so I just sprayed the muffin pan - BIG mistake! These stuck so badly, I was scrubbing the muffin pan for an hour (at least!) afterward. Next time I will use liners. These are great for low carb diet!

I enjoyed this when it was fresh from the oven but by the next morning the onions had had a chance to permeate & overpower the muffin.  I enjoy onions but prefer that not be the main flavor.

Family enjoyed this as a different way to serve eggs.  I have a meat eater clan so I used 4 eggs, 2 strips cooked bacon crumbled, 1 cooked sausage patty very small dice, 2/3 cup shredded cheese.  Made 6 muffins. Cooked about 20 minutes.  I used the seasoning amounts as indicated in the recipe but because of the cheese and the bacon, next time I will cut back on the salt a small bit.  They were still tasty, just SLIGHTLY too salty for my taste.

a different way to scramble eggs or make an omelet.  Great novelty for children.  I read many people had a sticking issue with these.  Try using silicone baking muffin cups, coated with your choice of oils.  They come out easily.

The flavor was great, it was a bit too watery and paper muffin liners were a horrible idea. I'm not sure I can get them out of my silicone muffin tin without them though.

I'll try buttering the muffin pan and cooking them a little longer next time. Also adding cheese into the mixture seems like a good idea, at least to my husband.

I used 7 eggs and added some heavy cream along with the water. I sautéed the onions, peppers and ham first and added grated cheddar to the egg mixture and atop the muffins. My only "complaint" is that you have to scoop out the meat/veggie mixture when filling the cups, otherwise it will sink to the bottom of the egg mixture and Will not distribute evenly throughout your muffins.

These were good although they stuck to the pan even with cooking spray. Substituted peppers with spinach due to food restrictions but I'm sure they would be even better with the peppers which would have changed the flavor.

I just made these muffins and had no problem with them sticking to the pan.  I didn't have any liners so I just sprayed my nonstick pan with cooking spray before putting the egg mixture in.  They muffins popped right out!  If you prefer to use liners just spray the liners with cooking spray before filling.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Just started a 30 day paleo challenge and these are fantastic.  Making these on Sunday helps me start off each morning on the right track.  I put the ingredients in the cups first and then poured the egg mixture over and that worked great.  You can add anything.  I did spinach, bacon and onions once and ham, peppers and spinach another time!

This is a pretty versatile recipe, great for on-the-go breakfast and/or even suitable for impressing family as a Sunday brunch item. I made the recipe as written, but next time I think I'll whip the eggs first, then add the fillings (prosciutto, broccoli, cheese, or whatever other meat/veggie you can think of) AFTER filling the muffin tin halfway with the egg. That way you'll be certain an equal amount of filling is being distributed throughout each muffin cup :)

I started with the basic recipe and enjoyed it so much I ran with it and have made it my own.  Usually use chorizo, add sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms.  This has become my go-to breakfast.  Normally top them off with home-made guacamole.

So quick and easy! I have always skipped breakfast, bad I know, because I just didn't have time to sit down and eat before leaving the house. Now I can make these ahead of time and grab 2 out of the fridge, heat for 1 minute, and go. : )

The muffins are flavorful and easy to make.  They freeze well for breakfasts on the go.  I make two batches at a time to freeze for my kids.  The recipe as is makes 12 muffins, plus four additional muffins.  I use traditional size cupcake pans.  We love these!

I did make a few changes.
1.  I used Jimmy Dean sage sausage
2.  I started with tater tots - spray muffin pan, press tater tots into the bottom of each.  Bake until golden brown. Then add all the ingredients (change as you want)  then bake until golden brown.
3.  I turned into a casserole (more tater tots and ingredients needed) when my family arrived.  Breakfast for all in one dish.

Great recipe! It'll be a great to grab & go option for my husband's shift work. I used ham, shredded cheddar cheese, red pepper and a bit of onion powder in place of onions as I didn't have one. Just be sure to use a non stick muffin pan!!! Even with lots of cooking spray it stuck like crazy. That muffin pan was the worst dish I ever washed!! But this is about the recipe, right?!

I made 18 of these for a potluck get together for 10 people. After it was all over, only 2 were left! people were getting seconds.

I did 6 with just veggies (red pepper, onion, diced tomato) and topped with mozzarella cheese. The other 12 I also added cooked sliced mushrooms and diced ham. I'll be making these again for sure!

I made this with the 1/2 water & 1/2 wine. Cooked thin pork chops for 25 minutes. They were good & moist when out of the oven! But got dry as I was eating them.    Should I have put the broth over the pork chops? Rice ( jasmine ) was awesome !!!  Will try again

the muffin tins were hard to clean but next time I'll do them in foil cup liners.  I used breakfast sausage and broccoli and dehydrated onions; I would use fresh or green onion next time.  Delish and I didn't miss the cheese.

Yum!  I tried another reviewers suggestions (naples34102) and used a dash of milk for water. It definitely helps to spray paper muffin cups with cooking spray so they don't stick too much. Also added a lot of cheese and cooked for 22 minutes.  My first recipe used sautéed sweet onions, chorizo and cheddar cheese with a dash of garlic and onion powder. Taking leftovers to work tomorrow for breakfast.  Will use this recipe again.

l made a couple of changes/additions. First, l made the half recipe because it is just my husband, a 3 years old son and me. l used 4 large eggs, and l also added egg whites, half teaspoon of salt, garlic powder, pepper, red pepper, turkey breast (instead of ham), onion, and gouda little pieces. For my husband's muffins, l added slivers of jalapeño pepper! Also, my muffins did not cook in 20 minutes, they took 30 which is ok. Once out of the oven, sour cream at the top and ready! MMMMMMMM A successful breakfast today. Thanks thanks for the recipe

I only made a few quantity changes, did half a green pepper since that's all I had, about 1/3 cup yellow onions, and Turkey bacon bits instead of the ham. I cooked them in 6 greased ramekins and they turned out perfect! So good! And so easy  too! I will definitely make them again and probably add a few other veggies like dried tomatoes and maybe green onion instead of yellow onions.

Yummy. Super easy and quick. Freezes well. Just pop 'em in the toaster and you're good to go. I made sure to mince the onion and bell pepper for thorough cooking in that short time frame. This is a keeper.

These were excellent!  I made as written except ommitted the red pepper because I didn't have any and added some cheese.  My picky 2 year old even loved them because he could just pick them up and eat them easily.  We will definitely make again!

It was very good and easy to make. I added some green onions and bell peppers to make it more colorful. It took longer to cook than advised though. Closer to 30 min.

5 stars for the flavor. They were a little watery so I will cook it longer next time. I used liners and they worked out well.

This was a 4+ rating but after using naples34102 review using the changes for a half recipe posted 12/9/2012 it worked perfect for my hubby and I. I liked the cheese addition and these little guys even warmed up nicely, served with a salad.

It needed to bake longer than 20 minutes, more like 25. I used muffin wrappers. Bad idea! Stuck to the paper. I added mushrooms & cheese. Absolutely delicious.

This recipe gives you the basics to create any sort of breakfast muffin you want -- 2 cups veggies, 1 cup protein, 8 eggs.  I don't know why this recipe includes water - completely unnecessary when I made them.  I like chopped spinach in mine.  Next time, I'm going to put fresh spinace in the paper liners, and then pour in the muffin mix instead of mixing the spinach in with everything else...

Living at higher elevation, we cooked it longer but still a great result. Good breakfast option.

Great! I sautéed green pepper, onion, mushroom and yellow squash and left out meat and salt. Baked in mini muffin tins for 15 minutes.

I made mine using crumbled bacon, onions, and cooked and crumbled tater tots. My family loved them! If there are leftovers, they are great chilled! I love that you can adjust the recipe so the next time I make them I'll make extra!

I thought this was pretty good for a quick on the go breakfast. I used the muffin liners but it did stick so suggest spraying them as well. I agree that the addition of some cheddar cheese is a good one. I like that it is so versitle (will try bacon next time as I am not a fan of ham and egg). I followed directions as is.

I tried this recipe over the weekend and the muffins were delicious. I made a few modifications. I used green peppers instead of red, used about half of the amount of onion it called for and added cheddar cheese. It yielded 12 regular size muffins. I did make one mistake though, I used paper liners and the egg stuck to the paper. Next time I will spray with Pam since I plan on making this recipe over and over again. Thanks for sharing it.

Fantastic. These ARE paleo if you can find nitrate free ham and/or bacon.

Great recipe...the possibilities are endless.  I reheated mine in the mornings for breakfast and sprinkled a little grated cheese on them.  I might briefly saute the veggies prior to adding them to the eggs.  My only major difficulty was once they were cooled, I had an extremely difficult time getting the parchment muffin cup liners off.  Next time, will just bake them in well greased muffin tins...or will try removing them from the liners when they are just cooled. Yummy yummy...will make again.

Tried them and loved them.  I am a weight watcher and this is a perfect recipe for on the go eating.  3 pts.+ not including cheese.  Only change to recipe was using low fat buttermilk instead of water.  Will keep these in the frig to take along with me when I don't have time for a full breakfast.

These were very easy to make. I used 9 eggs and was able to fill 12 muffin tins. There are so many possibilities but this is a great start. I added shredded chedder cheese on top prior to cooking. I also sauteed the bell pepper and onion prior to cooking, as another user suggested. They turned out great!

Nice idea,and especially pleasing to children. If I were to make them again, I would saute the filling ingredients first, especially the red pepper, and I would top them with some grated cheese. I like another reviewer's idea of topping with sour cream and maybe minced chives when done.  By the way, mine also stuck even though I used non-stick pans and buttered them well. Although I rarely use it, I would spray next time.

I had a problem with them sticking to my muffin liners, and had to cook them for an extra 10 minutes to get them fully cooked.  Some also had large  air bubble? They tasted great and the kids liked them.

Just an omelet in the form if a muffin. Used ham glazed in brown sugar, onions, bell pepper, and cheese. Only thing I wish it didn't sink when I took it out the oven. I also forgot to add the water.

Great! We left out the ham and these still had plenty of flavor. My kids gobbled them up! Will be making these again for sure!
