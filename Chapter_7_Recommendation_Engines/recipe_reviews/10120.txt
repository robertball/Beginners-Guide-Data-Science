I have not made this recipe BUT i do make chocolate covered pretzels - the trick is to use CHOCOLATE BARK COATING.  It adheres to the pretzels VERY well (better than chips and cream).  I melt the chocolate bark over a double boiler so it doesn't burn and then dip the pretzel rod or round in the chocolate, lay them all on wax paper and put in freezer.  Then after hard, I redip again, roll in crushed candy (peanuts, sprinkles, M&Ms, rieces peanuts, or drizzle  melted white chocolate) and freeze until hard again.  DELICIOUS and beautiful.

I used 1 1/2 bags of milk chocolate chips that I melted in a double boiler over medium heat.  This was enough to cover half of each pretzel in a 200g bag. The chocolate melted quickly without chunks and the pretzels dipped perfectly.  (skip the cream!)

Using the whipping cream I could not get the chocolate to thin enough. I substituted shortening and then the recipe worked fine.

I like this treat...but this recipe seems a little too complicated.  Have any of you ever tried Candiquik? It comes in chocoalte and vanilla and it is SO easy to use.  Pop it in your microwave for a minute, stir, and use to cover pretzels, fruit, make barks, etc. Love it!

This did not work.  The chocolate turned into a big, unusable lump.  We tried adding shortening but it didn't help.  We added some wax and it turned out ok, but by then the chocolate was gritty.  I'll try something else.

I did NOT use the heavy cream. I just added a tsp. of shortening instead, like I would if I was making my peanut butter cracker sandwiches dipped in chocolate. After we finished dipping the pretzles, we sprinkled crushed candy canes over the top. Huge hit. NOTE: We didn't even get half of a bag of mini pretzels covered with the chocolate that was called for in this recipe. It wasn't a big deal for us because we were just monkeying around in the kitchen. If you want a whole bag to actually be done in this recipe, you'll want to use double or triple the amount of chocolate chips called for in this recipe.

I added tsp of shortening instead of cream. Silly to add heavy cream, you don't need it! Buy a bag of crushed toffee and dip in after you dip in the chocolate. Amazing!!! Trust me.

This worked perfectly. I'm not sure why others are having trouble with it. I tossed the pretzels into a large bowl with the chocolate and used a chopstick to pull them out. I spread them out on parchment to dry. Easy-peasey.

C'mon people. The recipe simply states to heat the chocolate and the cream together. If you do this, the chocolate will NOT seize.

If you read the directions correctly, you will melt the chocolate and cream TOGETHER.  Do not add the cream to the melted chocolate.  That seems to be what most of the reviewers have done and why the chocolate seized.

I was melting the chocolate chips before I added the cream. The chocolate was melting nicely (should maybe have stopped there?), and then I added the cream and heated that. Once I started to stir, it hardened up. Save your chocolate chips and find a different recipe!

How can you mess up chocolate covered pretzels? My two recommendations would be 1) you don't really need the heavy cream. 2) try milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet, it tastes so much better. DO NOT use the cream, both times I tried this the chocolate seized and I used expensive chocolate those times. Chocolate chips or Bakers chocolate is all you need.

I made this with baking chocolate and skipped the cream. If you use chocolate chips - you will need some cream or margarine or butter when melting because chocolate chips have an additive agent to them that helps keep it shape when exposed to heat as opposed to baking chocolate or chocolate bark. the kids loved these!!!

Well, after I tried to add more whipping cream, it just became more like a ganache, so I started adding milk, and then the chocolate turned out ok.  But the recipe was a waste.

I ended up trading the whipping cream for white chocolate chips and it worked better for me. I melted semi-sweet chocolate squares and white chocolate chips in my double broiler. I dipped pretzel sticks instead of the traditional pretzels. Made 100s of these for cookie trays and it was a lot of work but got lots of compliments...

What's not to love about chocolate and pretzels!? I do NOT add the whipping cream, but instead add a little shortening or parafin, depending on what I have on hand to thin the chips out slightly and to insure they will set up properly when dry. These are great for a quick sweet snack or even for gifts! :)

This didn't work for me - never thinned out enough and started to ball - I used shortning.  I need to find a microwave recipe I used a year ago - it was perfect.  for now, the choc's in a ball on the counter waiting for a new recipe.

I used 1/4 cup milk instead of the cream and a tablespoon or so of NaVan (vanilla liqueur). I tossed all the pretzels in and picked them out with chopsticks, as another reviewer did. I believe the cream is supposed to give it a richer taste. Very good, and I will use this recipe again.

I used this recipe as a base, but i added a little chocolate and whipping cream here and there to make it the right consistency. I used my fondue pot instead of a double boiler and it worked great. I melted some white chocolate chips and drizzled that over the top of the pretzels and they looked and tasted great. They were a big hit at the party I went to. tastes much better than almond bark and candiquick, take the time to make the real thing

Super easy! I used large pretzel sticks broken in half. Once covered in chocolate, I quickly sprinkled them with festive holiday sprinkles.

I use the baking chocolate without the cream too.  But if I have to use chocolate chips or even Hershey bars, I use some peanut butter and that seems to help thin the chocolate and it sticks well to the pretzels.  It also tastes yummy with all the flavors together. Hope this helps!

Chocolate would not get to a good consistncy and did not want to stick to pretzel. Will not try this recipe again. I am going to try chocolate bark like all the other reviewers have suggested. Don't waste your time or your chocolate!

I first melted the chocolate on it's own and slowly added the whipping cream.  The chocolate had a great consistency until I put in the cream and then it turned into a hard lump.  It wouldn't even stick to my finger, let alone a pretzel.  I added A LOT of butter and finally was able to get it to a dipping consistancy, bu tit still had lumps.  Skip the whipping cream and just use butter or shortening.  Also, if you are like me and read the reviews after trying the recipe and have your own chocolate lump, I crushed up some pretzels and peanuts and squished them into little chocolate lumps.  The result did not look pretty but they tasted just as good as my end product.  I also tried this recipe with white chocolate and ended up with a mess.  I couldn't save that one.

The whipping cream ruins the chocolate.  Do not follow it unless you want hard chocolate!

i skipped the heavy whipping cream, but this recipe was wonderful anyway. I even went so far as to coat some in peanut butter and then chocolate and they were fantastic!

Love the sweet and salty combo. After the chocolate set a little I dipped mine in chopped nuts.

My mom, sister and I tried to use this recipe.  Twice.  The second time we melted the chocolate by itself first and it looked fine.  So we firgured we just had the heat up too high.  So we added the cream and it instantly hardened up into a ball.  I highly recommend not using this recipe.

Tried it this way, did not work out well. I will sticking to using melting wafers. They are so much easier to use. Pop in microwave, melt and dip. Done!

I had the same lumping and not sticking problems as a lot of people.  I think the amount of liquid is off.  I ended  adding a lot more cream, and finally got something sort of reasonable, but still really thick.  I ended up just 'scooping' the chocolate onto one side of the pretzels.  

Still searching for a great recipe for my favorite treat!

I didn't really use this recipe. I read the review about the chocolate bark and used that. It worked wonderfully. The pretzel rods turned out beautiful! I did the same thing she talked about using...the double boiler and spread it on the pretzel and then on wax paper. After they hardened I dipped them again and then put on sprinkles! When I was done I put them in a cleaned out peanut butter jar, covered them with saran wrap and tied it with a bow! What a beautiful gift!

The EASIEST way to make these pretzels is to go to A.C.Moore or Michaels craft store & buy wafers in bags[milk chocolate, dark chocolate, white chocolate, white mint & colored wafers].Using DEFROST in microwave each bag 3 mins.STIR well... defrost again 3 mins. again stir till smooth. Do not let it burn! Dip pretzels & lay on parchment paper [taped to whole kitchen table]. Then melt white or colored wafers & swish on all tops of chocolate covered pretzels after they harden.[If using chopped nuts, perils etc. shake on pretzels BEFORE they harden].Let pretzels harden & set completely before storing. To store I layer them in large shoe boxes & place in a cool place. Do not freeze! Easy clean-up too!

I tried this recipe because I wanted to make chocolate covered pretzels for a gift and one of my recipients is allergic to nuts so almond bark was not an option. I didn't use semi-sweet chocolate chips so this could be the problem I had.  I tried both white chocolate & milk chocolate chips and both of them I ended up adding a lot more heavy whipping cream than this recipe called for.  I continued adding a little bit at a time until I could get the right consistency for dipping and the chocolate came together instead of being oily and broken looking.  For the milk chocolate chips I finally ended up getting out my hand mixer to get it to come together properly. Even then after dipping a handful of pretzels I remixed to keep the consistency right.

If your chocolate turns lumpy, its because the chocolate you are using is of poor quality and has a low cacao butter content(candy bar chocolates, regular chocolate chips). Believe me, i've tried making ganaches and chocolate products with these before.. Use dark chocolate or good quality dark chocolate. I always use Lindt Excellence 70% cacao dark chocolate; it suits my taste perfectly. You can also use 65% cacao, and maybe try 50%? Also, if you can't find heavy cream, it is also called whipping cream in other places. Any cream product with a 30-35% fat content. You can also use double cream, which has an even higher fat content.

I used heavy whipping cream and the chocolate was not usable. The mixture clumped into a ball, no longer useful for dipping. This recipe is a waste of time and ingredients.

This recipe did not work for me. I melted the chips and cream together and got a solid mess of chocolate.  Tried again melting chips first and then added cream - again a solid mess. You can't dip pretzels in a solid mess.

I found that this recipe did need a bit more whipping cream than called for-I just added a little at a time until it was the desired consistancy. It worked great otherwise.

This recipe was not a success. I combined the chocolate and cream and tried to melt them as directed, but the chocolate formed hard chunks and did not melt. The chocolate did not melt until I added 1/4 cup butter per 2 cups of chocolate. The chocolate formed a creamy sauce after the butter was added and the pretzels tasted delicious, but I would not follow this recipe again.

I dip my pretzels just like marieted's recipe, but I also make a batch of melted chocolate and add a splash of peppermint extract and dip my pretzels in the mixture. They taste just like girl scout cookies thin mints.

Here is a variation..with just the chocolate..Melt the chocolate either in the microwave or doubleboiler..if you overcook it will clump...add a  few drops of peppermint oil (not extract) and dip and coat Ritz crackers.. I use a fork to lift out of bowl..scrape bottom of fork and give it a shake...put on wax paper to harden..coila..you have a perfect copy of Mint Chocolate Girl Scout wafers....

Great recipe. As one commenter said, the cream wasn't necessary. I used one bag of chocolate chips, heat over a double boiler, and was able to dip 2 bags of pretzels. Then topped them with sprinkles. They were a hit this Christmas!
