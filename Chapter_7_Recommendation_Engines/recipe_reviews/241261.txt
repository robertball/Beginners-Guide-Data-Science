Truly a healthy creamy omelet that I would make again however I will try parmigiano reggiano next time in place of the mozzarella cheese.

Squash Zoodler Omelet: "I was quite surprised, that cilantro worked with this. Zoodles are so fun!" I've never done anything w/ zoodles other than eat them w/ spaghetti sauce and meatballs, so this was a fun departure from my dinner norm, as it was entirely different, and I had it for lunch, and I was skeptical of how cilantro would taste in it. I followed the recipe except tossing in maybe a couple TBs of diced onions w/ the zoodles. With a squirt of Sriracha this was a really tasty omelet; if only I could think of a way to incorporate a protein into it so I could make double it for my husband and I, but I'm at a loss as to whether ham, bacon, sausage or some other form of meat would complement squash and cilantro... Still, YUMMY as written!

I was quiet impressed with this recipe. I do not eat squash very often but with this recipe, I do and I are a lot of it.

This was delicious!  I was out of mozzarella cheese so used goat cheese, but, other than that I stuck to the recipe.  I have a lot of yellow zucchini growing in my garden, so I will be making this quite often!

I changed this up a little bit, just to lower the Weight Watchers point total. I only used 1 tsp of butter, one egg and two egg whites. I also used low fat cheddar, mozzarella just didn't appeal to me. I'm sure it's delicious as is, my changes were minor. My way I got to eat the whole thing. It sounded so good and was way better than I hoped for.
