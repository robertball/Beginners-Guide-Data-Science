I was going to try baking the fritters instead of frying them, to reduce the fat, but the mixture was too runny to make a patty.  Instead, I poured the mixture into a muffin tin and baked it at 350 (175C) for about half an hour.  It came out great and I would definitely make it again.  I also added celery salt and some dill.  I'm giving the recipe four stars because it was a great idea and a good base.

I was really excited to try this recipe as I need more iron in my diet but I don't like spinach all that much.  Well, I'd eat these spinach pancakes any day!  Though I did make a couple of mistakes, accidentally leaving out one of the eggs and using baking powder.  I wouldn't advise either of these changes as my patties were a bit too fat and never really got crispy, and my husband said they were too floury.  I will try them again and update my rating then!Update:Well, I tried these again, this time following the recipe (except that I added a little grated parmesan!), and they were much better.  They never really got crispy, maybe because I didn't flatten them enough, but I really liked them the way they were.

I was so surprised this hadn't been reviewed yet!  I would give it 6 stars if I could, because it's SPINACH and it's so GOOD!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Even my toddler son ate them, which is unusual with them being green and all.  Make sure to keep them warm in a 200 degree oven if not serving right away, although they are best eaten immediately!  This can even satisfy a craving for something fried, although much healthier than most fried foods!  I will make this again and again!

For a little variation, I used fresh spinach and I sauted it in Italian dressing.  After the pancakes were done, I topped it off with a squeeze of lemon.

If you find they're not crispy enough, it's because you didn't drain the spinach well. I enjoyed mine very much. I seasoned with celery salt and garlic powder, in addition to the salt, pepper, and paprika already called for. I ate them with tzatziki sauce.

I thought these were a little bland, despite added garlic powder as others suggested. Next time I will add fresh green onions to the batter.

I decided to put garlic powder in these instead of the paprika and I really, really liked them.  My hubby and my two-year-old also liked them.  My 7 year old liked them only if they were dipped in Ranch dressing (which was delicious) but my 14-year-old didn't care for them at all.  Oh well, can't please all of the people all of the time!!  :)

My husband, 14 month old daughter and I really enjoyed these.  I'm VERY excited about having found something my girl will eat because she does not eat much, and getting food into her little belly is normally quite a struggle!

Very good!  Took someone's advice and poured into mini muffin tins and added some mild cheddar and garlic powder. Left out nutmeg cause I didn't have any. Awesome. Had them with a little extra salt. Makes about 2 meal-size servings I wanna make this again with onions and feta :D

These are a huge favorite at my house. I've added everything from poultry seasoning to onion & garlic powder and it always comes out tasting great. My only gripe (and why it doesn't get 5 stars) is that they don't come out crispy enough to justify all the oil.

We found these pleasant, if a little boring.  I added garlic and parmesan cheese and put sour cream on top.  They could still use a little jazzing up and next time I may try the feta tip or else make them spicy.

A good, basic recipe, thanks! It requires so few ingredients that I decided to give it a try yesterday (I had almost nothing in my fridge!):) However I altered the recipe as such which, in my opinion, makes it 4 stars worth: 1 cup drained spinach mixed with 1 Tbsp mustard, 1 cup steamed & mashed potatoes, a bit of fresh parsley, a grating of nutmeg, 1/4 cup shredded cheese. Overwise I followed the directions ;) It was really good and easy.

I agree that this is a good "base" for spinach pancakes. I made some changes to this recipe, first I increased the eggs to 6 and increased the flour to 3/4 cup because when I mixed according to these directions, it seemed way too much spinach for the amount of eggs.  I would definitely add cheddar the next time and maybe a few tablespoons of diced tomatoes.  This was good fix for a fried craving, but I think it may have a better texture if it were baked.  I was hoping that the thought and appearance of pancakes would persuade my picky 5 year old to try it, but I ended up mixing up a batch of real pancakes anyhow.  I'll make this again, just with my changes.

I love spinach but not this version.  This was bland despite my addition of lots of fresh garlic and lemon pepper.  The texture was weird.  I will stick to a simple saute.

I loved these pancakes.  My kids didn't, which actually surprised me, because the flavor is really mild and with salt they are quite tasty.  But I ate almost the whole batch as my meal and was quite satisfied.  A couple of things I did:  substituted 3 cups of fresh, chopped spinach for frozen, plus added a little bit of water to moisten it up.  I also seasoned it with some parmesan cheese and added some chopped bacon to the last few I made, which was really tasty.  Loved the recipe!

I made these last night and my entire family loved them!  I omitted the paprika and only added 1 egg and added some grated onion, 1tsp of pepper and 1stp of garlic powder, as many reviews stated they lacked flavor.  I browned them in a non-stick pan, then served them with lite sour cream as I would do to potato pancakes. Making these again! YUM!

Frozen Spinach is a staple in our house, convenient and healthy. I would have never thought to make something like this until I saw this recipe. They were so easy to make, used basic ingredients that we always have on hand and quite tasty.

This recipe is a good way to do spinach. I would have liked it to be a little more doughy, and a little less spinachy, so next time I will add more flour and maybe another egg. I served mine with goat cheese, which was pretty tasty. :)

These were plain, but good. You have to add some sauce. I tried tzatziki sauce and that was good and I tried scheshwaan (sp?) sauce and that was even better. When I eat the rest, I'll try pasta sauce. Good way to eat spinach.

This recipe was great!  I made a few revisions to suit my dietary restrictions and personal taste.  To make it gluten free, I used 2 tbsp of coconut flour instead of all purpose and added an additional egg.  I also added 1 tbsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp of cumin, 1 tsp of hot chili powder and a splash of vinegar.  I baked mine at 350 for about 30 minutes instead of pan frying. I'll definitely be making these again!

Eh...there are better recipes for something like this out there, even after adding onions, garlic powder, and parmesan.
I thought it was a much more flavorful veggie pancake. I know everyone serves these with a cream-based dipping sauce like sour cream, ranch, etc, but it's very similar to a Korean snack, so I eat mine with soy sauce on the side.

I used egg whites to eliminate a lot of fat and cholesterol and added a few tablespoons of nutritional yeast to the mix for flavor. These didn't really get crispy but were more like potato pancakes, which was fine. The flavor was good, but would have been pretty bland without the nutritional yeast.

Somewhat edible. I made these because I count calories and wanted to try a new recipe for frozen spinach... Per other reviews, I added garlic and onion powder, plenty of black pepper, Parmesan, and even a little 1/2&1/2. But by the time you still have to add a dollop of sour cream on top to make them palatable, I want my ingredients back! I have half the batter left in the fridge so I'll call it lunch tomorrow, but just because I don't want to be wasteful. Don't bother with this one... just keep searching for better ways to use that frozen spinach ;-)

These were just okay for me, as-is.  Really bland and so heavy on the spinach that I couldn't get a crust.  After the first small batch (made as directed), we figured out it just didn't work for us.  I modified the recipe, which made it something we might actually make again.  Added an additional 2 tbsp flour, 1/4 cup parmesan, 1 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and some pepper flakes.  My daughter ate it plain after my modifications, but I still needed ketchup.  I love the use of spinach, so I'm sorry to say this didn't work for us as well as I'd hoped.

Awesome, and 1 drop per bite of sesame seed oil... heaven! Popeye, why did you eat spinach from the can?  (I have also used this recipe with collards, kale, mustard greens, etc....)

As others have said, this is a great base recipe, but it lacks a little in flavor.  I even tried to add a little extra spice, and it still didn't quite make it for me.  I'll make it again, but try to spice it up in a different way.  It was a very easy recipe.

Turned out pretty good.  Took the advice of others that it was a little bland.  So i added garlic powder, cayenne, and a lot of cumin jsut cause i love it.  I didn't have any flour either so i used bread crumbs.  Came out great, definetly going to make again so i can experiment some more :)  Great way to use frozen spinach.

I made these more for my toddler to get him to eat veggies.  They turned out great and he ate them up like a champ!  I would highly recommend it for you moms/dads out there who want to get your kids to eat their greens.  A few changes.  I made a 1/2 batch first to try.  I added Parmesan cheese and garlic powder like others had recommended.  For a 1/2 batch, I used 2 eggs with 2 tablespoons of flour.  I also added about 2-3 tablespoons of heavy cream.  The batter was a little thinner than a pancake batter.  Fried them up in olive oil and they turned out great.  I would definitely make them again.

these were just "OK" - kind of bland (even with a thai chilli sauce for dipping) and not as crispy as i would've liked them to be.  i used fresh  spinach, which i steamed first before adding to the egg mixture. it's a good base, but it definitely needs to be played around with.  will try again when i have leftover spinach.

We thought this was a good BASE for spinach pancakes. They need more flavor. Maybe some garlic and another strong spice/flavor. We will definately try these again with modifications.

I tried this recipe but changed it a bit by adding low-fat grated cheese and french fried onions(from a can)and some mango marinade (just about a tbls) and fried them in canola oil.  They turned out so well that my husband wants them all the time now!  Really delicious - goes with anything!

Finally - a spinach recipe that doesn't call for cheese! I was interested in baking these, so Missus Wife's review was helpful - big spoonfuls into a well-greased muffin pan and baked at 350* for 25 minutes. I doubled the recipe and eyeballed some seasonings - almost a tsp salt, almost 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, onion powder and dill and about 1/4 pepper. With 20 oz of spinach I got eight muffins. This is so easy I want to quintuple the recipe and keep them in the fridge at all times!

I though these were very bland. I even added garlic salt and feta cheese per other reviews. I'd rather just eat sauted spinach, but I might try them again with more seasoning.

I didn't have any paprika, so I just used Lowry's seasoning, pepper and garlic powder instead.  I also added parmesan cheese.  They were pretty good, but really salty tasting.  I think the combo of cheese and Lowry's was too much.  We will try these again....I will omit any salty seasoning, stick with the cheese and add some minced garlic.  I will update if we try these again.

I've made these twice - once as per recipe & once with the added parm & garlic as others suggested.  Both times I found them completely inedible.  My 5 year old gagged on them.

It needed a bit more flavor otherwise all you taste was the spinach, but all around a very easy recipe.  It went over well with my family.

This was great!  I added a few more eggs and mixed in some parmesan and feta cheese for flavor. The feta really made the recipe for me.  My husband and vegetarian friends loved them.  I want to make them again soon!

I'm gluten and chili sensitive so used gluten free flour and Indian-style spices instead of the paprika. It was easy and quick to make, but was dry and needed a sauce to wake it up.

Will be working to perfect this recipe for my taste.  Overall a sensible recipe.  I used fresh spinach.  It needed to sweat longer and drained more before Introducing other ingredients. Taste was nice.

I made this recipe as written. I fried half the batter and tried it. My first thought was needed more salt and something else. Of course my first thought was bacon. I didn't have any bacon so I used "real" bacon bits from a store bought packet. Much better! After reading the reviews and about adding cheese, I decided to do that with the last spinach and bacon pancake I had left. The reviews I read never specified which kind of  "shredded" cheese. I only had cheddar on hand. So, I used that. That was better but not necessary. So "as written" I can only give this 3 stars, with the changes 4 to 5 stars. Thanks!

I made it according to the instructions, and they came out great!  I squeezed as much liquid as I could from the thawed spinach, and proceeded from there.  I got good colour to them, and they were pretty hearty and tasty!  Even my husband who does not really eat frozen spinach took a bite!  Sadly, I had eaten them all before I even thought to take a picture, yet there will be plenty of opportunities since I plan on making these again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

If you want the pancakes to brown nicely, use a non-stick pan and make sure the bottom is coated in the olive oil.  I love my expensive stainless steel frying pans, and they're great for most things, but these brown much better in my fifteen-dollar non-stick pan.

I add garlic, onion, and parmesan cheese to the original ingredients, and I add two more eggs.  With the changes, these are FANTASTIC!  All of the picky vegetable-eaters in my home love them.

Nice way to finish off leftover spinach... I added some cheddar cheese to the pancakes as they were cooking to make it slightly saltier.
