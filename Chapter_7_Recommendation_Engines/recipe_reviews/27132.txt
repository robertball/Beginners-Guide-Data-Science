Quick, simple, easy version of Creme Anglaise - and a tasty one too.  I made a double batch in barely more time than it took to seperate the eggs.  

If you want a pale creme, whip the yolks very well or use an electic mixer or egg beater.  To avoid glops - Be sure to use a heavy saucepan and don't turn the heat up too much.  On my stove it was about a 3.5 or 4 of 10 (electric) or else the egg will cook and congeal.  Temper the egg well and cook it slowly and you will have a rich, smooth, delicious simple version of a real creme.  And if it does get lumps, strain through a mesh sieve - no harm done, it's still yummy!

Excellent recipe. My mother owned a french restaurant when I was a child and this recipe is as good as I remember. To the reviewers that had "lumpy, or gloppy" problems....
I believe that you "boiled" your egg yolks. Try waiting and letting the cream temper before adding the yolk mixure, then bring it back up to a boil. HTH

Excellent recipe!!! I also added about 2 tsp almond extract, which was the perfect touch!!! I used this recipe to accompany a chewiest brownie recipe off this site and it turned out fabulous! I also made a raspberry syrup in addition to the creme anglais and served the brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Absolutely amazing! If your creme is turning out grainy, it means that your yolk is cooking - in this case you must use a heavier pan, and during cooking stir constantly and vigorously. You may also take your pan temporarily off the heat to stir the yolk back into smooth consistency. If all else fails, the creme can be strained before serving to eliminate the curds. Enjoy!!!

This is an excellent recipe: tastes great and extremely easy and fast to whip up at the last minute. I added some bourbon at the end of cooking it - AppleJack or Calvados works well, too, to give it some kick for my pumpkin bread pudding. It's fantastic and foolproof. If you screw up this recipe you obviously didn't add your hot cream to the egg mixture slow enough. I add at least half of the cream to the egg mixture slowly before adding the agg mixture back into the saucepan and it never fails. Try this!

I actually found this creme anglaise to be a bit too sweet and too "eggy" for my taste. (yes, I do realize that creme anglaise is a custard, which = eggs!!) I am a very seasoned cook and have made creme anglaise numerous times. I know I didn't do anything wrong - it's just the recipe. I have liked other recipes better. Definitely edible, though - how can you really go wrong with cream, eggs and sugar? :) As for the vanilla, you should never add this at the boiling stage. Always add it at the end. The only other modification I made was to add some dark rum at the end to cut some of the sweet/egg richness. Overall, this was an average creme anglaise, and thus my rating.

Made as instructed (except used milk instead of cream).  Tastes delicious, but is gloopy looking as others have mentioned.  It certainly doesn't look pretty!.

Mmmm! Pour over pieces of pound cake and fresh fruit.  I had this dessert at a local restaurant and the creme anglaise was very runny, too.  Mine was just as good!

This was delicious.  Very decedent, creamy and sweet.  I paired it with some chocolate crepes that were chocolately, but not overly sweet, and bananas and fresh fruit so it was a great combination.  I also substituted fresh vanilla bean (scooped out seeds into the milk mixture and also let the bean seep in the milk) for part of the extract.  I think this added a more complex vanilla flavor and you also get the bonus of the seeds dotting the creme so it looks more elegant and gives you a hint as to what is in it.  Everyone loved it.  I will definitely make it again.  I also tempered very slowly and had absolutely no problems with the egg, although I did strain through a fine mesh sieve just incase but there were no solids.

Good flavor, but it was yellow.  That kinda grossed me out for some reason.  I should have read reviews prior to making, because it didn't specify what level of heat or how long it should take to thicken.  No harm though.  I cooked it on medium and after mixing the egg mixture back into the cream, it took about 3 minutes to thicken.  It turned out a perfect consistency.

I made this to accompany warm Gingerbread Cake.  So wonderful and simple.  I didn't have any vanilla beans in the house, so this recipe was more convenient than most others.

First time making Creme Anglaise. Used this recipe exactly(I used a true vanilla bean in the cream) and it turned out amazing. Was sweet but the asian pear cake I put in on wasn't too sweet so it worked out well.

Grreat sauce for bread pudding. Get your ingredients organized ahead of time and the actual cooking time is very short. Everyone loved it. I did double the vanilla because we love vanilla

Awesome!  This is a terrific recipe.  I didn't have heavy cream so I had to use whole milk and I added too much vanilla because that's what I like and it was still great.

Good basic recipe, but I think you can probably cut back on the sugar since the heavy cream adds a lot of sweetness on its own.  I used less than half the amount of sugar it was more that fine.  Avoid the temptation to use too much heat, and be patient as it can take 10-15 minutes to thicken.  As mentioned in other posts, if you use too much heat and get some curdling, just filter through a china cap.  Can be prepared in advance and saved for a day or two.

This is now my go to dessert. I've made this twice and it is really easy as long as you are patient and let the cream heat slowly. 15 minutes start to finish. The first time I made this I followed the directions and it was great!  I'm diabetic so this time I substituted granulated sucralose sweetener and was very pleasantly surprised with the results. Just as creamy as real sugar and guilt free. I also added a little fresh ground nutmeg and the vanilla at the end so none of the vanilla flavor is cooked out. Served over fresh raspberries. Yum!

Delicious!! I didn't have a problem with lumps because, after I stopped stirring when the sauce was removed from the heat, my wife sent me back to stirring.  "Just because the heat's turned off doesn't mean it stops cooking."  Well, DUH!!  I should have thought of that!

So good and so easy to make. However, cut down on the sugar unless you have a real sweet tooth. I think next time I'm only going to add 1/4 c. of sugar. But good all the same! I had mine with a baked apple...delicious!

Used a vanilla bean instead of extract, one whole egg instead of four egg yolks, and 1/4 cup of sugar. It was rich, creamy, and not overly sweet. Served it on steamed carrot pudding. It would be awesome on bread pudding or a bowl of fresh berries.

I had to add another egg yolk to thicken the sauce - it just wouldn't happen without that extra yolk.

Great flavor, but lack of clear direction as to heat level when finishing caused me to start with too high a temp.  Immediately reduced the heat when it didn't look right and managed to salvage it.  To anyone reading this, recommend you use medium heat only.

This is a great Creme Anglaise recipe. It is a very good base for adding any flavor changes you might like. I blended strawberries in sweet sauce you buy frozen and added about 4 or 5 tablespoons to give it a very nice Strawberry Creme Anglaise taste. Drizzled over cheese cake. Yum.

Decadent! I made this EXACTLY as recipe says and it came out perfect!  I poured this on bread pudding, sooo yummy. I was always afraid to make this type of sauce but this recipe is so easy, came out silky smooth, no lumps, i drizzeld egg mixture slowly in while constantly whisking. Will definitely make again and will use on cakes and fruit.

SO easy to prepare! Love the smooth texture and rich taste. Substituted vanilla extract with vanilla pod seeds instead. Reduced the sugar a little and added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg to enhance the taste...

good recipe.  I doubled it using 1/2 milk and 1/2 heavy cream.  It was pretty sweet.  next time I'll use 1/2 C. sugar for the double batch.

Once I tempered the eggs & finished the sauce, I removed it from the saucepan into a small bowl. Place the bowl in an ice bath & continued stirring till cooled. I noticed this reduced any egg clumping. Also I didn't scrape the saucepan clean to keep clumps out of finished sauce. Very easy recipe...quality outcome!!

This is a lovely crème anglaise.  I made a double batch to serve with homemade angel food cake, and it was a perfect way to use up 8 of the 12 egg yolks leftover from the angel food.  I served the angel food with poached pears and crème anglaise... heavenly, and a definite crowd pleaser.
Oh, the other thing that I did was I used one vanilla bean, split lengthwise and scraped out, instead of the vanilla extract.  I cooked it with the cream in the beginning to release the flavor.

DIVINE!!! Made this yesterday afternoon exactly as mentioned (except I doubled it) and served it chilled over a crumbled vanilla pound cake with chopped strawberries and apples for dessert. The hubby polished off a big bowl of it AND took some today to the office!

Easy and excellent. You don't have to cook this over low heat; I cooked it over medium-high and was careful to whisk all of the pot's surface and it was fine.

This recipe is not something you should use if you are impatient, the whole thing took me over a half hour to do well. Keep the heat very low and don't stop mixing once you add the egg mixture in until it gets nice and thick.  Everyone LOVED this in our house, we had it over angel food cake with sliced strawberries and blue berries. mmmmmmm ^_^ we almost ate ourselves sick on it. Also the angel food cake tastes delicious just ripped up and dipped into the sauce.  Simply wonderful and something that will definitely be making many more appearances in my cooking.

I think I cooked mine a little too long as it turned yellow and became a little lumpy but if I con't to stir it, the lumps worked themselves out.  Tasted great and very simple to make!

I made this to go with this site's "Deep Dark Chocolate Souffle" and it tasted great...but is it supposed to be so yellow and gloopy? Well regardless of its funny appearance, it tasted yummy so thanks! ^^
