With all due respect to the submitter, I wouldn't describe the flavor of this dish "robust."  I would, however, call the flavors subtle, balanced, and incredibly delicious. This doesn't make a whole lot of sauce, and while it was perfect for hubby and me, if you serve this with pasta and like LOTS of sauce, you might want to double the sauce ingredients. I prepared this nearly exactly as written, finding only that I needed to add a little extra wine to the pan to deglaze once it came out of the oven. Also, I did not use jarred green olives, but a fresh, deli olive mix which gave this a truly unique and authentic "Napoli" flavor. In addition, this is a dish to impress, perfect for company, that pleases the eye as well as the palate. Hubby is a man of few words, but I know what "make this again" means!

Very nice recipe - great flavor and easy to prepare. I doubled the sauce ingredients and added some slivered sun-dried tomatoes. I took the pork out when it reached 150 degrees, sliced it into thick medallions and added the meat to the sauce to finish cooking. This kept the pork very juicy and allowed it to absorb the flavors. Served it on a bed of angel hair pasta (which is why the extra sauce was needed). I arranged the pork medallions on the pasta and poured the sauce on top. Will make this again.

WOW - if I could give this 20 stars, I would.  I substituted evaporated milk for the cream and it was plenty rich.  We served this over a small amount of whole wheat angel hair, and the flavor was amazing -- seriously tasted like something from a restaurant!  I did find that I had to add quite a bit more wine as the pork cooked, as the pan really dried out.   I could see even skipping the pork and using the sauce over pasta as a main dish for my vegetarian guests.  THANK YOU!!

5 star plus - soooo easy and delicious.  I followed recipe "almost" exactly!  I had to substitute canned diced tomatoes which I drained a bit (it is winter and tomatoes in NJ are horrid!).  Since there were only two of us I only used 1 tenderloin but used the ingredients for two.  I am glad we did - there was nothing left!  I served it with a butter and herb rice from Rice Roni.  I will make this again, (quick and great for company).  I now know to double the sauce ingredients when I cook two tenderloins.  Thanks so much submitter!!!

Sensational!!!!  After reading some reviews I was expecting this to be good but it was far better than I anticipated.  The pork was incredibly tender, probably the most tender I have ever had.  I followed the recipe, but made a few adjustments according to what I had on hand.  Tinned tomato, added some mushrooms and used light evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and it was great.  Will be making this many more times, oh and I will be atleast doubling the sauce as it is sublime.  Try this recipe its great.  Many thanks to the submitter!

Great, great, great recipe! My husband and I loved this. So simple but the end result was fantastic. And I am not a green olive fan! I used canned tomatoes and half and half because I didn't have any heavy cream. I can only imagine how that would have tasted. Ymmmmm. We ate everything. Presentation was perfect. It was simple to create and the taste was gourmet. I would give this 100 stars if I could. Again, very, very good.

awesome recipe!  I add sliced onion and capers and mushrooms to the mix.  160 degrees was perfect for a medium to medium rare tenderloin.  Very flavorful and easy to tailer to personal preferences.

I browned some nice thick Butterfly Pork Chops in an iron skillet. I then added all the remaining ingredients except I didn’t have any heavy cream.  Substitution: I ended up substituting the heavy-cream with ¾ Cup of 2% milk, 1 Tbls of sour cream, and a few pinches of corn starch to thicken the sauce a little.  This recipe was delicious, and very tender!!!!!  I served with side of elbow noodles, and spooned a little Napoli sauce over the noodles (any pasta will do.) A LITTLE SAUCE GOES A LONG WAY – VERY FLAVORFUL!!  My husband loved this dish too; he said it tasted like a recipe straight out of Europe.

This came out so good that my family couldn't believe that it was homemade (at first they thought I had ordered in from a restaurant what a compliment!)I fell in love with the tomato sauce. I used canned tomatos and some roasted bell pepper.

This was soooooooo delicious.  I tried it out as a family dinner, and even my 12 year old loved it, but certainly an awesome idea for a company dinner.  Does well served over a bed of risotto.  I used canned roma tomatoes, green olives with pimentos, and threw them in with the rosemary and garlic in the minichop to shorten chopping time.  I also added the cream at the end to taste, and think I almost doubled it and cooked it a tad longer, but definitely do it by taste!

I'd give this one a dozen stars if I could!

Made this recipe for dinner.  The sauce is very good but the pork was bland, for my taste anyway.

Absolutely delicious!  I took other reviewers' suggestions and doubled the sauce.  I'm really glad I did because I served this over pasta.  Didn't have fresh rosemary so I used dried.  Also, it didn't look like 2 romas were enough so I added in an additional to beef it up a bit.  Next time I'm going to add onion and capers along with a bit more garlic along with capers.  I should also mention that this reheats beautifully!

I liked the flavor of the sauce in this recipe.  I will say that my pork tenderloin came out undercooked after 1/2 an hour in the oven.  I recommend cooking it for 45 minutes to avoid getting pink pork.

This was WONDERFUL!!  I used one 14+ oz. tenderloin but the full amounts of all the other ingredients.  I used a nice hot Greek olive blend from the deli that we like.  Using a remote thermometer, we roasted this to a temp of 155, then tented for 10 minutes, which we both thought was just a little bit too well done.  We like a little blush of pink, so next time I might roast to 150 and then tent.  I do think the roasting time in the recipe is excessive.  Pork tenderloin is a very tender cut of meat and you don't want to cook it to death!  Also the 3/4 pound tenderloins called for in this recipe are what I would consider small and roasting them for 30 minutes will surely dry them out.  My best advice is to USE A MEAT THERMOMETER!!

I had to make a few substitutions based on the ingredients I had: for every 1 cup of heavy cream substitute 3/4 cup milk+ 1/4 cup butter+ 1 tsp. flour.  Also I wanted to double the sauce but only had 2 tomatoes so I used 1/2 small jar of pimentos for some extra flavour. Used chicken broth in place of wine as well.   All in all the recipe turned out fantastic.  I'm not a huge fan of pork, so I think from now on I'll be making this as a vegetarian pasta sauce!  My hubby even loved this, and he doesn't like olives!

WOW!  This recipe was fantastic.  I made only three slight changes.  Besides doubling the sauce portion, I rinsed the olives ever so quickly to help eliminate the possibility of too much salt, and I added about one cup of artichoke hearts (not marinated) to the sauce.   I used a nice, dry chardonnay and served the pork and sauce over linguine.  Soooo good! I will definitely be making this again--and soon! We had a zucchini saute on the side and a loaf of pugilese bread.  I felt like a fancy chef!  Thank you, Deltaqueen50!

This was very good, I followed the recipe almost exactly. I sprinkled the salt and pepper instead of measuring it since a few people mentioned it was salty. I doubled the sauce for one tenderloin and we almost ran out so next time I'll triple it. Thanks!

This dish is absolutely fantastic!! I have served it multiple times with larger groups and everyone raves about this dish. The only issue I have with it is the sauce. There simply isn't enough for everyone. I double and sometimes triple the sauce quantities, and if there is too much, it makes a great post-dinner bread dip. Make it tonight, and you will have smiling faces at your table and fat bellies on your couch afterward.

Perfect! I made this exactly as written except I doubled the pork and quadrupled the sauce. I didn't have a skillet big enough to fit all 4 tenderloins, so I browned them one by one and then laid them on a deep baking sheet. I threw the tomato/olive mixture in the skillet to deglaze it and then dumped the whole thing over the tenderloins. Worked wonderfully. We tossed 1/2 the sauce with linguine and used the rest on the tenderloin. YUM. Thanks for the recipe!

I would make this again.  I had to sub I don't like green olives as much.  I used Greek and some capers.  I forgot tomatos so I have to use some roasted cherry toms I have from summer.  I soaked them in the wine.  The sauce was great I ran out with it doubled.  The problem I had was at the cook time my pork was close to overcooked it was 190 degrees.   My oven is hot maybe but that was my only complaint.  I will reduce and cover for part next try to reduce.

This was so good.  My pickier than ever 10 year old daughter even ate it and she' not much for tomatoes.  I thought the olives would be a little overpowering, but it was perfect.

This is good!  I seared the pork tenderloin on the grill, then put in a foil pan, covered with the sauce (no cream added yet)and heavy foil, moved to indirect heat for 30 minutes.  I used canned tomatoes (only had Rotel), doubled the sauce and served over egg noodles.

This is my favorite recipe on this site ever! Instead of fresh tomatoes, used 14 oz. drained canned diced  tomatoes with the olive oil & garlic already in.   pinch of dried rosemary,crushed in my palm & the 1/2 cup white wine, pour over meat--- add 1 cup heavy whipping cream later, as stated. Drizzle a little finished sauce on sliced tenderloin and the rest served in a bowl!  No olives!       "Sterlingcook"

Delicious!  Tastes like a dish from Olive Garden. We used extra cream in the sauce and poured it over boneless pork loin chops. Next time we will also double the wine for the sauce. Be careful of grabbing the skillet handle after pulling it out of the oven to stir the cream in! Make sure to put a oven mitt over the handle to avoid getting burned like we did.

I am not sure what happened.  The flavor was very good except it was too salty!  I followed the recipe as written.  I used 1/2 t of salt.  My husband & I enjoyed it, but I won't make it again until I can figure out what made it so salty

I thought this was wonderful.  The pork came out so tender, probably the most tender I've ever had pork tenderloin come out.    Unfortunately, there wasn't enough sauce (and I doubled the sauce recipe based on other reviews)... so TRIPLE or QUADRUPLE the sauce if you like a lot of sauce especially if you're serving with pasta.  But, it was absolutely amazing.  My husband and a co-worker of his thought it was great.

Everyone will think that I am crazy but here are my substitutions.  First, I used a tsp of dried rosemary since I didn't have fresh.  I also substituted evaporated skim milk for the cream.  Finally I didn't have the olives so I substituted diced kosher pickles.  I know it sounds crazy but even my fussy son ate it and liked it.  My husband couldn't get past the look of the gravy with the milk and the chopped tomatoes and pickles so he would try it but I thought it was excellent.  The pork was tender and moist too.

I made this for dinner last night. My husband & I absolutely LOVED it. I used a can of drained diced tomatoes (next time will use fresh) & I also threw in 1/2 of a chopped yellow bell pepper and a minced shallot. This is one of the best recipes I have gotten from this website!

This has become a favorite in our home. I have made it several times, as requested and it keeps getting rave reviews. This is so simple and elegant at the same time. It would make a great main course for a special dinner, etc. and everyone would think you were a gourmet cook. I do have fresh rosemary and have cut back a little on the amount as it can be overpowering and some people aren't big fans of that taste. I also add more of the olives as we love them. This is a must-try.

I followed the recipe (no substitutions) and I thought it was great!  I'd definitely make it again.  I found after 30 minutes in the oven the tenderloin only registered 150 degrees.  But I left it to rest, covered with foil while I finished the sauce.  It was tender and moist.

This was quite good and easily prepared.  Wanted to share how we used the leftovers for a completely different and equally tasty main dish.  Let me start by stating that, I at least doubled the sauce ingred. and used a can of diced tomatoes. Tonight, I diced the remaining pork and sauce with a 1/4Cup of broth over med-high heat until sauce reduces and covers the hot meat.  Place on prepared tostada shells, w/ layer of refried beans, rice, shred cheese (we broiled pepper jack/cheddar over meat/shell before adding...)...fine shred lettuce or cabbage, avocado, tomato, black olive and topped with a sweet wine vinegar dressing and salsa.    Thank you for sharing original recipe.

Excellent. My boyfriend of 11 years said it tasted like dinner from a restaurant (which made me wonder if he looked at other reviews). The flavors are amazing (and I don't like green olives).  Simple and easy to make. I also doubled the sauce which is a great thing to do! Make this, you won't be unhappy.

OH MY GOD!  I doubled the sauce recipe, and put it over egg noodles just like others had suggested.  I accidently put the creamn in it when I put it in the oven, it still turned out fantastic.  This recipe is pretty much idiot proof if you follow it, and even turns out great when you dont read it correctly, like I did!

I have made this twice now, and it is AWESOME!  I use low-fat milk instead of cream, and it makes a lovely sauce.

I made this recipe for two, using not the tenderloin, but center cut boneless chops.  I did not have green olives and didn't want to buy the size jars available in our neighborhood grocery. I used capers instead.  Served over couscous  or baked polenta rounds.  Served with green beans with onions and prociutto.  Will serve again!

This was very good -- the meat is incredibly tender and it's a nice change from regular tenderloin recipes.  I, too, doubled the sauce and I used canned diced tomatoes and evaporated milk.  Very tasty and will serve again, trying the original ingredients (though the substitutions I made worked well).  A keeper!

Absolutely a keeper!  I was looking for a recipe I could make in my newly purchased cast iron pan. I did not have green olives but did chop whole pitted Kalamata greek olives, which I would prefer with pork anyway.  I'm not sure the sauce for this recipe would be enough for two 3/4 lb tenderloins, but for one it was perfect!  I had an unopened pint of heavy whipping cream so slowly stirred in the entire pint.  Since it's only a bit more than the recipe calls for, and because my girlfriend loves a lot of sauce, it turned out perfect.  It only took 20 minutes for my tenderloin to reach temperature.  This is now one of my top five recipes.  It's that good.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

Yum! I doubled the sauce as some suggested. Don't be afraid of the olives. I rinsed them before chopping. They add a richness to the sauce with out over flavoring. I also used half & half. Served it over angel hair pasta. I think next time I 'll add some Italian seasoning.

Easy and incredibly delicious.  The only thing I would do differently next time is double the ingredients except the pork.  Will make again soon. **I made this again last night (and I don't make many things twice) when I was short on time.  Cut the pork into bite sized pieces and sauteed in the olive oil.  Added the rest of the ingredients and simmered for a few minutes until the tomatoes cooked.  Forgot the cream altogether and it was still fabulous.

Love it!  My husband did not have the same feelings though.  He's not an olive fan and it definitely had an olive taste to it.  If you're an olive fan though, definitely give this one a try!

Fantastic recipe!!! I had to make do with ingredients that were available in my pantry, such as canned Italian tomatos and some left over bruschetta from Costco. (No balsamic vinegar in it.)  I added a few Italian spices and baked it in a 9x13 in. glass dish because I had too much sauce.  After it finished baking, I added 1/2 and 1/2 to reduce the fat content, cut up carrots for sweetness and used my hand blender to disguise the fact that this had olives in it from my kids.  Put the sauce on the sliced pork and over spaghetti.  Really wonderful! Thanks for the original recipe.

I have made this several times for guests and it is always a big hit! I double the sauce and use canned diced tomatoes.  I don't have green olives on hand, so will try this tonight with kalamata olives.  I serve with mashed potatos and green beans.

Thought this was very good. I did some things different. For example, the grocery store did not have fresh rosemary so I used a suggestion on here and used oregano (and some extra garlic powder). Next time I will make sure to use the rosemary, it needed it. I also added capers and I used canned tomatoes (Italian style, very good). I would not recommend capers.

I made extra sauce because everyone suggested it. The sauce was incredible. The olives, tomatoes, and cream blended perfect together. I also put more salt and pepper in than it called for - couldn't taste it really. 

I used light cream to save a few calories and thought it was very good. Can only imagine how good heavy cream would be in it.

I would make this sauce again even without the pork, just for pasta. I actually put whole wheat spaghetti here. What I did was put the spaghetti in a big dish (like a lasagna pan), put the pork on top, and covered with the sauce. The pork was a little tough, I cooked it longer than suggested. This meal would be good with a soft steak or chicken as well. I don't eat shrimp but would imagine people would love baby shrimp in here as well.

One thing I would suggest besides a pasta is some hot pepper, probably jalapenos in the sauce. And I would cook the garlic in the pan as I'm browning the pork so the garlic is more tender. I loved the garlic but not everyone loves it not fully cooked.

Very easy to make also.

This recipe smelled and tasted great! I followed other suggestions to double the recipe's sauce, and I don't think that was enough sauce either! I will make this again, but be generous with the sauce.

I am not a big fan of olives but thought I would try anyhow as my husband loves them. I did not have fresh tomatoes so I used about 2/3 cup of canned tomatoes. I also used whole milk instead of cream and a bit of flour to thicken. Make sure you brown the p.t. in a cast iron or stainless steel skillet. Don't use non-stick. It really does make a difference. Will double the sauce next time. ***Delicious!!**

Absolutely perfect! The cream mellowed the saltiness of the olives, and fresh tomatoes gave the dish color and balance. And it's so easy to make! This goes straight into my recipe box. Thanks for a gorgeous meal.

This was very flavorful even though I had to substitute black olives for the green, which I did not have on hand.  My husband asked me to make it again about a week or two later, which really says something!  I had to search for the recipe!  Won't lose it again!

As soon as I read this recipe I knew what I was having for dinner that night! I went out right away to get the ingredients. And this recipe was as good as I anticipated! I added whole mushrooms to the pan before putting it in the oven, and I also added about 2 TB capers. This is DEFINATELY a repeater! Thank you so much for sharing this gem!!!

my family couldn't get enough; we substituted cherub tomato, which gave a nice subtle sweetness, and added kalamata olives mixed w/ the green.  Everyone loved it, even my 7 y/o; it's easy, but looks and tastes good enough for a dinner party.

I agree with other reviewers that this is a restaurant quality dish!  I doubled the sauce ingredients for one tenderloin, and used an olive muffulata (a little more than double the amount)instead of just green olives for a little more variety.  It was fabulous even though I do not have a cast iron skillet.  Browning the pork on the stove, baking in glass pyrex, and then transferring sauce ingredients back to the pan to add the cream worked great. An outstanding and easy recipe!

This was okay, the olives made it quite salty.  I think it would be better with chicken prehaps. Or as a bread topping...like a bruchetta-type appetizer. Something just seemed a little off about this whole dish.  I don't think I'll be making it again.

I'll give this one five stars, and I don't like green olives!  Something in the simmering process really mellows the olives and gives the sauce a unique taste.  The five star rating hinges on tripling the sauce...I can't imagine serving it with only the amount of sauce in the original recipe.  I added a medium onion (diced) and used a full can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes (but am itching to try it again with a really good in-season tomato).  I served over the smallest, thinnest egg noodles I could find.  Delicious!

THIS RECIPE WAS AMAZING!!!!!! It is by far the best recipe I have made from this site!!! I did alter it a bit though. 

I marinated the pork in buttermilk for 15 minutes before cooking. I forgot to brown the pork in oil, and browned it without it. When I made the sauce I used the heavy cream and a little bit of buttermilk. THAT MADE THE SAUCE SOOOOOOOO AMAZING!! I RECOMMEND ADDING THE BUTTERMILK IN THIS RECIPE!!!!!!!

Thank you and will make always!!!

Everyone loved it, even the kids. My husband thought this was the best pork tenderloin recipe I've ever made and trust me, I've cooked lots of varieties. We kept out the olives because none of us like them and it was still awesome.  I doubled the tomatoes and sauce -- it's very easy to make.    We cooked and baked in a Wolfgang Puck steel skillet/pan.  Looking forward to trying it in a cast iron skillet for even added flavor!

A little intense in flavour - use less rosemary, fresh tomatoes if possible, and add a bit of sugar to cut the acidity.

LOTS of flavor with little effort.  The only change that I made was adding a bit more wine during the cooking process.  I used an iron skillet and served it on a bed of egg noodles.  A KEEPER!

I fixed this for my family of "men" tonight and they all LOVED it.  I was worried about using olives because they do not like them and they ate them without complaining.  I had to use canned tomatoes & half 'n half, but it was delicious!  They told me to definately save this recipe and make it again!  Thanks for sharing.

I made this for my parents, mom is still raving about it.  I finally got to use my mega cast iron pan.  Do remember that when it comes out of the oven, it too is 400* and don't touch it without a mitt.
I did make extra sauce as suggested.

I did use my cast iron skillet, but cooked it on top of the stove.  I didn't like the rosemary seasoning so I added a little oregano and some tomato sauce and it was much better.  With my modifications it is an excellent way to cook pork tenderloin.

This was simple and great.  Maybe I will use premium green olives next time.  I really liked the sauce and served the pork with egg noodles.

My husband and I were hesitant about this because of the green olives but we loved it! I used center cut boneless porkchops and served them over egb noodlesIand the sauce. I will definitely cook it again it was a nice change from the way we always cook pok chops.

Funny, both my husband and I love pork tenderloin, olives and tomatoes, but the end result of this recipe was rather underwhelming (is that a word?) for us. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't something I'd make again, because there are way too many recipes out there to try, and this one didn't tickle our tastebuds the way we thought it would. Thanks for the recipe though, Deltaqueen!

This was ok. We did not find it flavorful enough. It looked better than it tasted. I substituted diced tomatoes for plum tomatoes -- not sure if explains it. We just prefer pork tenderloin recipes that are marinated. (There is a great one in the Foster's Market cookbook!) If I make this again, I will follow another user's suggestion to slice the tenderloin after cooking and let the slices sit in the simmmering sauce, so that it soaks up more. I would also add more rosemary and wine at the end. Sorry to be the naysayer here.

Delicious!  The pork was very tender and the sauce gave it a great flavor.   I didn't have any rosemary so I used italian seasoning instead and the sauce didn't seam to thicken so I used a little cornstarch and water.  I will definitely make this again.

I thought the taste of this dish was absolutely excellent!  I used ingredients that I had on hand because this was a last minute find.  I used Pimento olives and omitted the Rosemary (because I didn't have any).  Otherwise I followed the recipe and it really was delicious.

Excellent recipe! I used rather more wine (1/2 cup) then boiled of the excess to thicken the sauce.

This recipe is easy and delicious.  My whole family devoured it.  I omitted the olives, and pureed the tomatoe mixture before I added the cream.  It was smooth and made a nice sauce to pour over the pork. This would be a nice dish to serve at a dinner party too.

This was a great recipe. My husband couldn't get enough and he would have given it 10 stars. The only thing I changed was that I used a whole can of diced tomato instead of the real thing which I think worked out great. Yum!

I liked this recipe as it was written, so I decided to try it...and then I got distracted with kids. And phone calls. And, well, life.  Yet it still turned out great!  I'd be glad to try it again when I can concentrate more, but I was happy with my "mistake version" as well.  
I ended up quadrupling the sauce because my two tenderloins weighed almost a pound more than the recipe called for, and I wanted more to dress some pasta on the side.  I intended to use rosemary from my garden, but didn't get a chance to run out and cut a sprig, so I used Italian seasoning.  Also, I can't use wine so I used chicken stock...and I accidentally added the cream to the rest of the ingredients before you pour it over the tenderloins and bake them, instead of adding it at the end. I removed the tenderloins and reduced the sauce on the stove as directed when it came out of the oven, though.
And guess what?  My family survived, my husband who normally hates pork actually ate a few slices of the tenderloin, and we all agreed to try the recipe again.  If that's not a good, versatile, keeper of a recipe, I don't know what is!

Very flavorful.  Used sautéed mushrooms instead of olives.  I think the olives will over power the pork

This was great! I loved it. It looks like it might get dry with the small amount of wine, but it's fine. I think i probably added a liberal 1/4 cup, but it reduced quickly and made a great thick cream sauce because of the limited amount of fluid after cooking. This isn't a pasta recipe, so don't expect enough sauce to make a fettucine dish. The sauce is enough to dress the sliced pork or add to your rice on your plate. Don't over cook it! Follow the instructions and it'll be great.

Like many other reviewers, I served this with pasta.  Don't.  The sauce is best over the pork.  The flavors of the sauce are subtle (and very good) and get lost in the pasta and don't leave much sauce left for the pork.

I thought this was outstanding. I added more wine after cooking for 30 minutes because my tenderloin was very large and the liquid was almost gone, then cooked an additional 20 minutes until done. My kids devoured it, but picked out the olives. Which is fine--more for me!

YUM...loved this one!  I personally love green olives, hubby not so much, but loved the sounds of this recipe, so wanted to give it a try!  Didn't change a thing with the exception of only using one of the tenderloins, but based on some other comments, decided to leave the 'sauce' ingredients as called for with 2 tenderloins.  Glad I did!  Oh, I also used 5% light cream instead of heavy cream to save on some fat/calories, thought it turned out great.  Served this alongside some simple steamed green beans as I didn't think anything too heavy needed to go with it!  Thanks Deltaqueen!!

Fabulous! Wouldn't change a thing.  My family couldn't tell there were green olives in there.  Great with egg noodles.

I made this tonight and it was FABULOUS! Now, I must say that my husband did not like it, but he's not a fan of olives. I followed the recipe exactly but doubled the sauce.  I loved it completely!

This dish is simple and very yummy! I omited the olives (don't care for them) and added some oregano ... We ate it with Linguine...definitely a keeper!

The sauce makes the meal - makes it so it isn't dry.  I made 3X the sauce.  I used both a 2 lb pork tenderloin and 2 lbs of boneless pork chops (I had a big group to feed and used what I already had).  I browned the chops first, and took them out.  Then I browned the tenderloin and put 1/2 the sauce on.  After 15 minutes, I put the chops and remaining sauce on.  Served with angel hair pasta covered with some of the sauce.  The meal fed 8 adults with leftovers.  Very yummy.

Fantastic recipe. I've done it twice so far, and wouldn't change a thing! Passed it along to my sister too, who does it with pork loin chops instead. Absolutely made me look like a star with my guests. Thank you so much for this one!!

Fabulous!!  My husband and 25 year old daughter RAVED about this and I enjoyed it too.  Only change I made was to double the sauce.  Was worried about the green olives (not my favorite) but it was delicious with them.   Served with angel hair pasta (sauce over) and steamed green beans.  This is a keeper - the flavors were heavenly and the meat was so tender! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe deltaqueen!

I usually just dump some jarred sauce over pasta and call it dinner but this time I had a pork tenderloin to use and found this recipe.  I added a little extra half and half to the cream and served it over spaghetti.  It is so easy and impressive enough for a special company meal.  If you like green olives you will love this.

This was fantastic. The olives added a nice amount of salt - but not overpowering. The sauce was delicious. Loved this dish. I would even make the sauce for chicken or beef.

Excellent dish. I doubled the sauce as others suggested. Added a little corn starch to thicken the sauce and served it over angel hair pasta. Delicious, hubby loved it as well.

Love the combination of the olives with tomatoes. I like the sauce so I usually add more heavy cream.

Pretty good- the only thing that I had trouble with is that I didn't have an iron skillet- It probably would have been a 5 if I had...

The whole family enjoyed.  Followed directions to a "T" but I did take the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce which I served over Angel Hair pasta. I also made in a cast iron skillet and it worked quite well and the meat was very tender and juicy.  Thank you

I was a little unsure of how this was going to taste but I made it last night and it was amazing. I did make a few changes: I used a 1 pound tenderloin, substituted broth for the wine, used green olives with pimentos, and substituted ff half and half for the heavy cream. I also cooked the whole thing on the stove top- too hot to turn on the stove. I will definitely be making this again!

Great flavors.  I wanted something different ( I get bored with the normal choices) and this did the trick.  I added capers because I'm trying to use them up, but otherwise made as directed.  This is delicious.  I served with spinach fettuccine.

This was so good! My daughter’s boyfriend is a chef at an Italian restaurant. He liked it! I didn’t have fresh tomatoes or green olives, so I substituted a can of Italian style diced tomatoes and black olives. I also subbed some cream cheese for the heavy cream. I’m definitely making this again.

The recipe says to bake it for 30 mins, but my chops were overcooked by then. So, watch the temperature of the meat. But it was very good. :)

I’m a foodie and a cook.  I really wasn’t fond of the flavors. The rosemary with the olives and tomatoes just gave a taste I didn’t care for.  But on a positive note I made Mushroom Risotto (from Allrecipes) and it was fabulous.

Flavorful dish. I made 	a little change by using both green and black olives. The rosemary seemed to be the spice that put things over the top.

I didn't have any wine so I used chicken broth and a tablespoon of apple juice. I served it over spaghetti squash and sprinkled Parmesan on top. We declared it a new favorite.

I did double the amount of tomatoes  and olives and added quartered baby Yukon gold potatoes.  Had to cook longer than stated but no big deal.  Will definitely make again.

My family loved the flavor of the sauce.  However, we would have liked more sauce.  Next time, I will make extra sauce.  I would also season the pork prior to browning it in the skillet.  Otherwise, this was moist and delicious!  We will definitely make it again.

Excellent recipe.  I used a pre-marinaded pork tenderloin for more flavor, and I used red instead of white wine (because that's what I had on hand).  It came out perfectly -- juicy and flavorful. The sauce is outstanding and makes a big difference in turning a good recipe into a great one.  Even my husband, who insists he "doesn't like gravy" liked this sauce and kept ladling more on his plate.  That's a winner in my book.

Really enjoyed this dish.  I made the full amount of the sauce and cooked one tenderloin.  This was the right amount for two adults.  I served it with some rigatoni and pan roasted asparagus with lemon juice, toasted sliced garlic, and grated parmesan on top.  That recipe can be found from America's Test Kitchen cookbook, which can be checked out at the library.  I would definitely serve this to company.

I look and look and can never find a pork loin that is .75lb. I only see ones that are over 3lbs, which is fine, because this recipe is awesome. I make it every chance I get. I cant wait to make this for someone other than family, lol.

I made this for dinner this evening and loved it!  I substituted chicken broth for the wine but left everything else the same. The cook time was spot on and I served it over pasta. Tasted like something on a restaurant menu!

Really nice flavor. I agree with the other reviews, if you prefer sauce on your pasta, definitely increase the ingredients for the sauce. As is, the sauce is minimal (but still flavorful).

Really excellent!  For two of us, I had one large tenderloin and I also used a can of diced tomatoes as there are no decent fresh tomatoes here in April.  Came out awesome!  I roasted the pork for 25 minutes and it was perfect - it actually could have come out of the oven 3 or 4 minutes earlier.  Cream at the end made it so delicious.  Thank you so much for a recipe we will come back to again and again!!

This is so good and I've made in many times. I've even let it cook for much longer than called for while waiting for guests a few times and it still came out perfect. The flavors are robust and taste so well together.  It's a regular around our house.

I was a little hesitant considering I'm not a green olive fan, but this turned out delicious.  Used it on a 3 lb pork tenderloin that I presliced so when I smothered it everything could soak up the flavor.  I cooked covered at 350 for 30 minutes, and then smothered and cooked uncovered at 400 for 30 minutes.  I doubled the recipe and the extra sauce went with noodles.  My changes were (on a doubled recipe) I forgot the tomato, I used half of the called for dried rosemary, added two extra cloves of garlic, sliced up 4 oz of mushrooms, and used red wine since I had no white.  The sauce is sort of bland looking, so doesn't look too delicious, but it tasted great.  And the tenderloin was very tender.

Very nice recipe. I substituted a tablespoon or two of tomato paste, and half cream, half milk. Tasted great, I can imagine the original recipe being even better. Loved the olive flavour.

This was pretty good! I doubled the recipe like many suggested and it was perfect for the two large tenderloins I had. Don't have a cast iron skillet and I'm sure that would provide a bit more flavor when browning. I didn't think it was "robust" in any way... I could've maybe used a bit more salt and pepper. I added about 6 chopped fresh mushrooms and 1/2 red pepper because I had them and it was good to have extra veggies in the very creamy sauce. I didn't have pasta to put this over so I whipped up some instant potatoes really quickly and it worked out great. My husband is excited about the leftovers for work tomorrow!

Delicious!!! I recommend doubling all of the sauce components from the beginning, so you have enough for two loins. I love a lot of sauce & veg! We added onion & mushrooms to ours, and subbed half & half for heavy cream. Fantastic!!

I'm not one for a ton of spices and flavors. This however, was a little less than I was expecting. For my family and I, the sauce was nowhere near enough.Instead of using green olives, I used Kalamata olives since that is what we all like. I do have plans on making this again in the future though. All in all, an excellent base to start with.

I enjoyed this recipe very much!  I, too, only used one tenderloin, but kept the proportions the same for the sauce.  Also, it's good to watch the internal temperature of the meat as 30 minutes was a little too long for the baking time.  I followed the recipe as written, but I added capers, mushrooms and marinated artichoke hearts to the sauce.  It was a hit at our house!  Thank you!

Served this for Easter-FABULOUS! I asked the owner for a wine selection at the store and he asked all the ingredients before suggesting Smythe & Renfield Sauvignon Blanc Marlborough from New Zealand.  It was perfect and had a touch of a taste of lemon to it which gave the dish a little extra zing, besides giving the cook a great drink while cooking. This dish is a winner AS IS but do make quadruple the sauce.  You will want it for dinner and left overs.   I tore up Spinach in the sauce for the leftovers which was delish too.

This is delish.  So good that Grandpa didn't need to pull out the ketchup.  Son thinks the sauce would make a great beverage.  We served it with roast cauliflower, which goes well with the sauce.  It was pretty simple to prepare, too.

Great recipe and because I didn't have green olives I used black and it was equally as good.  Nice change from usual pork tenderloin recipes.  Quinoa is a nice side with this dish.  Thanks to submitter.

Most excellent!  I couldn't find fresh rosemary in my supermarket so I used dried/crushed instead and substituted half-n-half for heavy cream.  Neither mattered in my opinion.  I served this with whole wheat ravioli (SouthBeachers) and it was fabulous.  I didn't find the taste "olive-y" at all.  It gave it such a nice flavor.

The olive flavor really overpowered this dish for us.  I used evaporated milk, close to a full cup, and the sauce was still very olive-y. Another thing, 160F was pretty pink on the inside (I used a digital thermometer).

This recipe was EXCELLENT and super simple!!  I probably would never have tried it b/c I'm not a big fan of the green olive.  A friend tried it and raved about it, so I gave in.  So glad I did.  I didn't change a thing, but I will double the sauce next time b/c I served it this evening with angel hair pasta and would have just enjoyed having more of it.  My kids are ages three and 14, and they liked it, too, which is saying quite a bit!  It's oftentimes quite difficult pleasing both of them.  Thanks for the terrific recipe!

I think this recipe is great!!  The only thing I did differently was exclude the cream and the rosemary was dried not fresh.  Believe me you don't miss it, and it helps cut down on calories.  Absolutely wonderful.

I cooked this for Mother's Day, and found this recipe to be absolutely excellent.  It's very easy to make, and everyone loved it.  I'm a 27 year old guy, and if I can make this meal anyone can.  I would recommend making a little more of the sauce, it's what makes it so good.

Great taste but I think next time I would leave out the olives as I think it overpowers the flavours of the sauce and the pork.  Will definitely make it again.

Absolutely delicious.  I used a small can of chopped black olives as the only substitute.  I can't imagine anyone not loving this recipe.  Very moist and creamy taste.

this was excellent.  I doubled the sauce and I'm glad I did.  I served the sauce with pasta and and everyone loved it.  I might add sundried tomatoes the next time.  Great recipe Delta Queen.

This recipe was okay.  A nice change from marinading.  I followed other suggestions and doubled the amount of sauce.  I'm glad I did this and frankly, would probably make even more sauce next time.  Much of the white wine, etc. evaporates in the oven, so I added to it after cooking.

I made this receipe last night for my family, and the platter was clean at the end of the meal!  Everyone was bragging on what a great dish this happens to be.  I give it a five star rating and did not change anything.  The only thing I will change next, is to turn up the oven about 15 degrees and let it bake a few minutes longer.  It was just a tad too "rare" for us, but it was really good.  Thank you so much Deltqueen!!

This is one of the best.  I made it the first time, making extra sauce as some others have suggested,,,,, and it's a real winner.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and it worked great.

Wonderful!  I used canned diced tomatoes, drained completely.  Next time I will increase the sauce and serve with buttered noodles.  Thanks to the DeltaQueen.
