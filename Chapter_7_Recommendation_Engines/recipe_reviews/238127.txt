This is really good! Just the right balance of sweet and sour. I use vegetable broth to make it vegetarian, but other than that, I don't change a thing. It's great as a sauce for fried tofu.

Super easy.... super quick. Added it to homemade meatballs in slow cooker. Delish. This will be my new go to meatball sauce. No more store bought for us.

The change I made was to use Splenda rather than sugar, so that someone who'd had bariatric surgery could eat it without dumping.  It was delicious, tasted just right, and we both feel great afterwards!

So much better than the restaurant sickly sweet stuff.  This is more sour than sweet, for me just sweet enough as I like the vinegary bite this has. Will remake, would be great on chicken or tofu.

Made it as is. Maybe next time is all a little less sugar, but really good and went well with ground pork patties recipe I found here. I made meatballs and put them in the sauce. Delish!

I used 1/2 cup coconut palm sugar and it was a little tart. I loved it anyway and froze portions.   Next time I'll try 3/4c. palm sugar and sambal oelek or sriracha to spice it up.

It’s great and easy, I don’t cook it long after adding the corn starch.
