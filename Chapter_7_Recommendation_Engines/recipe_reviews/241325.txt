I substituted Big Cheddar CHEEZ-ITZ for them. I loved this and will surely make it again.

Next time I won't add the crumbs. They were good but kind overpowered the delicate cheese flavor.

I made this tonight. It had a nice texture and looked beautiful. Very souffle-like. Next time I might add a little salt however. I eliminated the crumbled cracker crust as we follow a low carb diet so I just generously buttered the baking dish. No problem with sticking. I could see experimenting with different cheeses such as goat cheese. Maybe sprinkle some parmesan in the bottom of the dish. Will definately make this again!
