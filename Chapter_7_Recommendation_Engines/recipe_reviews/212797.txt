Good, but I guess I expected a bit more. Kind of bland, but I could have spiced it up a little myself.  You couldn't really taste the cole slaw dressing (plus it was $5.50 for the jar), I'd probably substitute sour cream or ranch. But all in all a good receipe, just might meed a little tweaking for your own style.

Extremely disappointing would be a severe understatement.

W@W I was very surprised at how good this recipe was. I did use cream of chicken instead of mushroom, I even accidently added a whole cup of slaw dressing instead of 1/2 c. My Family of six loved it and that is something..... To please everyone is my family is a miracle. So thank you for this delicious chicken enchilada recipe. :)

I made these last weekend for a family reunion and they were gone. I was skeptical about the slaw dressing in there, but they were wonderful. I made one pan for the reunion and froze one.
