Maria this was very easy and delish, thank you for Sharing!
I didn't have celery seed so I used celery flakes  and doubled the amount.  I also cut the amount of peas, carrots and chicken in half and still made 2 Pies that were filled to the top, I used my grandma's Pyrex Pies dishes so that may be the reason it seemed I had so much.
I added a little over 1/2 cup of Ora Ida  steamer potatoes to the bottom of the pie before the cooked ingredients because I love potatoes.
My family loved it and we all had seconds.  
There's no doubt l will make this for many years to come.
Thanks again for sharing.

OMG this is the BEST chicken potpie ever!!  I asked my husband if he wanted to try a different recipe after this and he said, why mess with perfection?!  This is the one!!  The only thing I did different was I didn't add celery but next time I will!  Love it!!!

VERY GOOD. USED CAMBELL'S SOUP.  ADDED MUSHROOMS AND PEARL ONIONS.  USED ROLL-OUT Pillsbury Pie Crusts from the refrigerator section.   A little light on salt and added more pepper.

I made slightly less filling than suggested and less chicken stock for a creamier texture. Used fresh herbs while sauteing the veggies - turned out delicious!

Great comfort food recipe! I had a package of refrigerated pie dough that needed to be used so I cut a few corners and bought a rotisserie chicken at a local Club store and a steam in the bag package of mixed frozen veggies. I used to chicken breast only, cutting into bite-size pieces and steaming the vegetables according to the package directions. I followed the recipe for the gravy as directed although I did not have celery seed and used some dried thyme. As directed, I put the chicken and veggies into the crust that was placed in a deep dish pie pan then poured the gravy over it which created overflow in the pan. next time  I'll mix the gravy and chicken together before pouring into the pie shell. this recipe is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is so good. It's basic, without added seasoning to change how a pot pie is supposed to taste! Delicious!
