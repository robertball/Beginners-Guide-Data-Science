This a pretty good crust recipe.  It is basic, as the title suggests, so all the "it's bland" comments made me roll my eyes.  Unlike other reviewers, I had to use less flour, just about 2 cups.  I tested the water with a candy thermometer so that it was perfect for the yeast, mixed the ingredients with my old hand mixer, and added another half cup of flour with my hands.  That seemed to be plenty.  Then, I let it rest while the oven heated, and plopped it down on my pizza pan, and spread it out with my hands.  No need to roll, really.  It spread really easily and I had no problem getting the edges a little higher than the rest.  I pre-baked as the recipe suggests, added some basic toppings, and finished baking.  My aunt loved it.  I thought it was a little bready, but nice and crunchy.  I will DEFINITELY make this again.  If you have problems with it rising, check the temperature of your water.  If it's too cold, the yeast won't react.  If it's too hot, it will kill the yeast.  If it's too bland, add some spices.  If it's too sticky, I'm not sure what you've done, because this was one of the least sticky, easy to handle doughs I've ever used.  Hope this helps.

Very easy and quick pizza crust. This made 1 large (15") pizza. I did not prebake mine and just cooked it on the top rack for 16 minutes. My son really enjoyed this pizza. Not crispy and crunchy, this was foldable just like my son likes. This worked out great for our needs. I will keep this handy for future reference when I need a fast crust without a rise time. Thanks Beverly, this was just what I needed. The second time I did this one I used a 14 inch perforated pan and prebaked it on the lowest oven rack and the crust came out crispy and crunchy which hubby and I both loved.

It was great. I used regular all-purpose flour instead of cornmill since that was alll I had.  I had to use more than 2 1/2 cups of flour though b/c the dough was too sticky.

This was a good crust recipe. The dough didn't want to come together in the mixer so I added more oil - unfortunately, this made it more sticky and harder to work with - my fault. But the outcome was amazing. I love the thinner crust pizza and this turned out just right for me. I would make again and highly reccommend!

Easy, idiot-proof, basic. There is no reason this recipe should not have 5 stars. It is what it says. If you're looking to add wheat or more flavor, experiment, but this recipe is good as is.

I really like this recipe. It's very basic. I added a little cornmeal to the all purpose flour. I like it that way. I perfur to make my pizza crust by putting the yeast, sugar, and warm water in a bowl, and letting it get foamy looking. I then mix the flour in it, and kneed the dough. I let it rise in a bowl, covered. And then I proceede to make the pizza.

Very easy to make and turned out great!  I followed the directions exactly.  Next time I might add some garlic powder or something to make it a little less bland, but it had great texture and form.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I've made this twice and will be making it more often.  I'm a bit intimidated by yeast, but it turned out pizzaria style without the fuss of rising, punching, kneading etc...  Next time I'll up the salt, as it was a bit bland.  Also, I forgot to pre-bake the crust before adding toppings, but it still baked up just fine (took 15-20 mins).

Really good, easy to make dough. Dissolve sugar in the warm water prior to adding yeast. For more flavorful dough, add more salt and spices like onion powder, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, thyme. I also kneaded the dough for a few minutes prior to resting it. Turned out very good. Will use recipe again.

Eveything is great about this basic recipe. I always end up using 3 and 1/2 cups of flour and adding garlic powder.  Yum! Best part is making a bunch of pizzas and freezing them for later, they heat up so well! Bake the crust for 7-8 minutes, let cool, add sauce, cheese and toppings, then seal in a freezer bag and freeze for later!

We follow this recipe, except use semolina flour.  The crust is absolutely wonderful.  (I docked 1 point b/c it is not as good with all-purpose flour as the recipe calls for).  Very easy recipe too.

This worked well for me - and I'm pretty new at yeast doughs, so I appreciated how simple it was. Not quite as crispy as I like, but still very good. Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome! As a poor college student this was a great easy way to make dinner with plenty of leftovers for the rest of the week. I dont have a pizza pan but a regular cookie sheet worked just fine. I added some onion powder and garlic powder to give it some more flavor. My roommate, who is a very picky eater, loved it.

Excellent!  The texture is what we have been looking for.  The top rated pizza crusts from this website can't beat it.  It cooks perfectly - crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle.  I find the other recipes stay "doughy" in the middle and I can't cook it more because the top would burn.  I used garlic salt instead of regular salt and doubled the amount based on the "bland" comments.  It was perfect!

After making this a few times, I wanted to add that after baking and right before serving, we like to brush the crust with melted butter mixed with a little garlic salt.  My family likes this pizza better than take out!

This was incredibly easy to make. I used my food processor to mix the ingredients together. Crust was crunchy. We topped it wth penne ala vodka and mozzarella and it was yum.

This was a solid pizza crust recipe.  My bf really enjoyed it.  It was a bit thick for my taste, but that's just personal preference.  I felt the dough cooked well and handled well enough.

I have tried several crusts lately and this one was great!  I DID sub 1c of whole wheat flour for part of the flour total and I also rolled the crust out to fit a jelly roll pan (it made a great thin crust that still had substance).  I will make this from now on!

This is the dough I'll be making from now on, very easy, you do need more flour, up to a full cup more.  I also like to add pepper and italian seasoning to the dough, but it is great plain as well.  Thanks.

I swapped out half of the oil with olive oil, and added a tsp., or so of oregano. They both helped with blandness of the crust

I looked every where for a good pizza crust recipe, but i didn't have any luck. Others that I tried were too much like bread. Then I found this recipe, and it is by far the best pizza crust that I've had! It's so simple and basic, yet it's like something you would get from a pizzaria! One of my favorites!

Simple and delicious.  I've never made pizza crust before (I avoid making dough at all cost) and this recipe was a perfect intro.  I used whole wheat flour, and changed nothing else at all.  Thanks for the recipe!

I use this recipe all the time (got it from a friend)!  In my friend's version of the recipe it doesn't need to be precooked.  However, I found the crust seemed to turn out better when I precooked it for just a little while (less than the 12-15 minute recommended time).

Jeez this was easy. Turned on the oven, made the dough, kneaded for a few minutes, cut my toppings, rolled the crust, baked the crust 10 minutes, topped it and baked it another 10 minutes. It was fabulous. Thanks Beverly it could only be better and easier if I convinced my wife to do it for me.

this crust was perfect. I used it to make 4 mini individual pizzas. 
white pizza...brush uncooked crust with olive oil and pressed fresh garlic. sprinkle with mozzarella and a shake of parmesean. sprinkle a little dryed oregano on top and bake at 500 on a heated pizza  stone or heated cast iron pan for maybe 5 minutes for the mini size.

This was outstanding!  The only thing I did differently is I let the dough rise, as I had to run grab the kiddos from school.  I doubled the recipe and it made enough crusts for 2 18" pizza crusts.  OUTSTANDING and soooooo easy!

Im only giving 3 stars.I would love to give it 5 but the crust after backing was light yet crispy just as I like it.but it lacked taste...like really when I order pizza I eat the whole thing crust and all but this crust needed something.even after the fact I followed recipe to the letter other then i let the dough rise longer and rolled it out (fun with the kids.)and brushed garlic olive oil on the crust it needed something.I will make soon but will add my own touches to this.thank you for the recipe

This is a great quick and easy recipe.  The first time I make it, I used all of the dough for a single pizza and it was a little too much bread for us so the next time I used half the recipe for a single crust and it made a great thin crust.  Topped with sauce, pepperoni and pizza cheese.  Just as good as delivery.

I made pizza tonight with this recipe. It was AWESOME. This has to be the best home made pizza crust I've ever had. My family devoured the two large pizza's I made. We will defiantly be making this again.

A basic crust it is, but a very good one at that. I found that this makes a very large thick crust. We enjoy thinner ones so I scaled down the measurements and very happy with the outcome. I added some fine herbs to the dough which gave a very nice flavor. I have used this several times and the results are always the same.

Added a bit more salt and some granulated garlic--worked very well! It ended up very crispy on the bottom-the way my family prefers it. I did the mixing part in my breadmaker to see if it would work, and it was so fast, we'll be doing it often!

This pizza crust is extremely easy to make and tastes great.  As the recipe says, it's a basic recipe so you can add to it what you want to make it your own.

The only thing about this is now the family wants this every Friday night for movie night instead of ordering take out pizza which means I don't get a break from cooking .      ;>)

I've been using a recipe almost identical to this and always turns out great. Only difference is that I put in 1tsp. salt, my own additions are about 1/2 tsp. each of basil, oregano, and italian seasoning. I just put everything in the food processor and process for a few minutes and since we like a soft crust I just take the blade out, put the lid back on and let it rise right in the processer,once its risen about 1/2 hour, roll it out cover and let rise again and then prebake for 5 min. in a 350% oven. Then proceed to put on whatever I want.

Love this recipe! I got this from a recipe book my M-I-L gave us at our wedding. It was in their church book published when my husband was only a couple of years old! I use 1/4c oil and no cornmeal (but it does sound good with it!) I don't beat or let it rest at all, just dissolve the yeast in the warm water then add everything else and mix a little then pour it on the counter and work the flour in and shape. I usually sprinkle a little garlic powder just for fun! I make three mini pizzas for the kids and a 16in for us. Delicious!

Absolutely love it!!!  It's the ONLY crust we use.  I even use it to make bread sticks, I top with Parm cheese and serve with pizza sauce to dip in.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe

I love love love this recipe! I make pizza using this recipe at least once a week! My husband, who usually hates homemade pizza crust because it's too "cakey" loves this one! I usually double the recipe and freeze one crust after baking for quick meal another day.

This was quick and easy with all the ingredients I have on hand.  I pre-baked ours for 13 minutes the baked again for 10 minutes after the toppings went on.   It was crunchy on the outside and a little soggy in the very middle.  This is a good one to play around with like less sauce in the middle.

great simple pizza crust. i've made my bases many times using this recipe and they always turn out the way i like my pizza, with a soft, "original style" crust. i've never tried it with the cornmeal though; i always skip that step. definitely pre-bake a little before adding the toppings, it will be too soft otherwise.

This was a great dough; super easy and tasty. I like to add a combination of herbs to my dough depending on what the toppings will be. With this recipe I made a grilled chicken and roasted garlic pizza and added the Pampered Chef rosemary & Herb seasoning mix. There were so many great layers of flavor. Absolutely delicious!

This was a wonderful dough, crispy on the edges but soft and yummy inside. I made this recipe out of necessity. I wanted a dough which I could put together right away and I have to say I am a bit surprised at how good it came out. I used it to make a calzone type recipe today and will definitely use it in the future when I want pizza on the spot! Thanks.

I made this for the guys in our family last night while they watched the football game. I made 2 rectangular shaped pizzas on my cookie sheets, and they came out so good!! I used a little extra salt than specified (not much though), I also used extra virgin olive oil in place of vegetable oil, and I added some sage, garlic salt with parsley, and onion powder to the crust mix before adding the rest of the flour, and toppings were spagetti sauce with meat, mozzerella cheese (extra), pepperoni, hamburger ( I had some cooked left over from the night before), sweet onion slices and green pepper slices and mushrooms. All loved it! And I cooked it on 375 degrees.

This made a decent pizza crust. I used a packet of pizza crust yeast though, and I don't think it was designed for a recipe like this. If I try this crust again, I'll try regular yeast and see if that yields different results.

My family loves this recipe. We did add oregano and garlic powder for taste. We also divided into smaller pizzas so the kids could make their own!

Added a little garlic powder and dried oregano and didn't pre-bake. But did add cornmeal to the base of the pizza pan. Still came out crispy enough at the bottom and was absolutely delicious. Cannot wait to make again. Also 5 stars for being so forgiving to my additions.

This is a great basic crust. Didn't turn out too sweet, thought a little doughier than I thought it would be - made it a little difficult to work with. Besides that, it was one of the better crust recipes I tried.

Rather crispy. Not a soft pizza crust. Very good otherwise, but not fabulous.

This dough took almost no work to make. I made it in my stand mixer and tried it both with the kneading hooks and the regular beaters and both worked perfectly fine. The dough was a bit sticky so I needed to add in a bit more flour, but otherwise it came out great. I made an extra one, baked it for the first bake of 10 mins or so, then cooled and froze it; we used it the next day (I let it sit at room temp for 10 mins) and it came out wonderful. My kids loved it, as did I!

I had a tough time with this recipe even though I followed the directions very precisely.  The dough was very flat and did not rise at all. (need more yeast?) I'd like to try it again but I'm open to suggestions on how to make it better!

I was looking for a quick lunch for my son and decided to try making a pizza. I've tried different crust recipes before but they never turned out like this one. It was so quick and easy and both me and my son absolutely loved it. I used to manage a pizza shop and I would take this pizza crust over the one from our store any day. I will definately make this again.

I'll probably keep shopping on a standard pizza dough recipe but this was really easy and pretty quick. It's good enough to try again with some changes. Most being personal preferences but I for sure recommend more seasoning. It is a bit bland but the good news is you can custom make it :-)

very good.  I love how simple and easy it is to make.  I did have to add a little more flour than called for to get it firm enough to roll out. I thought the first time I made it it was a bit bland, so the second time I added some basil and garlic powder, and brushed some olive oil and parm. cheese on it before baking.  yum!

I have to say that this recipe wasn't easy at all.  The ingredients were quite simple, but getting the dough to the right texture was extremely tough.  Not to mention, its flavor when it was finished was very bland.  You might try adding some herbs/spices to give it flavor.  I won't be making it again.  Sorry.

I loved this crust, very easy and chewy. I did add a lot of garlic powder and Parmesan cheese to the dough before baking. 
The only problem I had was rolling it, and this may have been my fault. I didn't know  whether to roll it in the pan or not. I didn't and had a bit of a hard time transferring it to my pan, resulting in a slightly awkward-looking crust. But once I got all my toppings on, it was fine and tasted delicious. I put barbecue sauce, red onion, cilantro, cubed chicken and cheddar cheese. Yum!!! I'm making this for a second time tonight for my husband's birthday and I can't wait to eat it!

So so, at best... Not enough flavor for my tastes, takes an awful lot of yeast for the yield... But the big thing for my family is it just doesn't produce the nice, crispy/chewy crust we like - this is too bread-like.
