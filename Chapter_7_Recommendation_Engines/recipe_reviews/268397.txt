10.28.18  This took no time at all to make, and if you’re looking at the photo, don’t even think vanilla pudding.  There’s no comparison, this is just so rich and creamy.  With its neutral flavor, you can do all sorts of variations by using different extracts and toppings.  Today, I kept it simple with a single fresh strawberry, and we enjoyed it for Sunday dessert.  Perhaps a little bit too sweet for us, so I’ll cut back on the sugar next time, but that’s just personal taste  It did get just a bit soupy after being in the fridge for a number of hours, so I’m thinking thicken even more next time.  It’s simple to make, different, and well worth your time.
