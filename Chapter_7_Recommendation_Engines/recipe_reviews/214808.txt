Im moroccan and we call it felfel in the chark region of Morocco... Its a recipe with a lot of trial and error until you find the best balance between everything in the dish... Fire roast the peppers and place them in a clear plastic bag to let them steam so the skin will be easier to take off. Once the skin is off try not to rinse them because you will lose flavor.  Chop them up the same size as tomatoes.Mince as much garlic as you want and cook in about 3 tblspns of cooking oil with 2-3 tomatoes if you are using 5 peppers. Salt,pepper, paprika and let all ingredients simmer for about 20 min.( You can add spice by roasting a hot pepper and chopping it up as well)

I had high hopes for this recipe. It has all the ingredients we love. It just didn't measure up. To begin with we ended up cooking it way longer than 2 hours to get the extra liquid to evaporate. Then when we served it the next day as a side it was not well liked.

Small variation to this recipe. Put 2 tbsp of oil, peel and chop 1 whole garlic head finely, Place garlic in pan and start cooking, add salt, pepper, in the meantime take 2 large cans of diced tomatoes and drain them as much as possible in a colander, squeeze to get the most water out of it. Add tomatoes to the garlic on low fire, Add 3 or 4 grilled and peeled green bell peppers. Once the water is evaporated, it may take 2 to 3 hours Add the secret ingredient that is powdered dried red bell pepper, hard to find but can be found online, put the powder in about 4 tablespoon of Virgin Olive oil and pour into the casserole. Put fire on high for about 3 minutes stirring constantly. Take it off the stove and let it cool. It turned out great and made a whole batch which can be frozen.

I did not care for this. Not the recipe I grew up with. It's far too acidic.
