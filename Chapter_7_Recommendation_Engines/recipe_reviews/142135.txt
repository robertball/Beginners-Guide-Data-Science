This was very tasty! The only thing i did different, was use tomato juice instead of ketchup. I had some left over tomato juice that needed to use up. Because ketchup is a lot sweeter and thicker, I just double the brown sugar(or sweeten to your taste), then thickened it with some corn starch. It worked out great!! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  A finicky 13 yr old biy picked this Sloppy Joe recipe for me, likely because it had NO green peppers.  I thought the amount of celery would taste/look weird but it didn't. It was a great addition,the celery retains a crunch but was there mostly as texture as the flavor is either masked with the spice mix or gone because of cooking time.  I made the celery into dice so that it would resemble the same chop of the onion, figuring that is better looking than half moons. I also sauteed, onion and celery and garlic first in a little olive oil (I like my onion wilted) and browned inexpensive frozen ground turley (comes in a frozen roll)on top of that.  I did not drain since it was turkey and just omitted the water.  YUM! and thank you!

Awesome recipe.  Recommend using jus a dash of cumin as it is a very strong spice and was a little overwhelming.  Try using buffalo meat...you won't believe it.

WOW! This was fantastic!  I will never eat a sloppy joe from a season packet again... We made this in a pinch and was by far the best sloppy joes we've ever had!  Thank you for this recipe.

The best Sloppy Joes I have ever made! I will finely chop the celery and onion when I take them to work for those who hate vegetables and they will never know!  Thank you Jill! A keeper for sure.

Good recipe, though I like mine better (my recipe makes way too much for one family dinner and I can't really lessen it easily). For a different texture try using shredded beef instead. I had some Venison roast left-over from Sunday dinner, shredded it and used that instead of ground meat. It saved on cook time too as I didn't have to thaw, then brown any burger.

Very Good! Liked the addition off all the different spices that are usually not in a sloppy joe.  So EASY & had all the ingredients on hand made it even easier.

My family loved this recipe.  They were tired of my old recipe and all raved over this.  I have to say the only change I made was to reduce the celery by about half and finely chop it because my kids would not like to bite into pieces of celery.  It would be a huge turnoff if they knew there were veggies in it!!!  Otherwise followed recipe as written and they are still asking for the leftovers even though they have finished it!  Will definately add this to my recipe box.

Rating my own spin due to following: I started with a different recipe but felt it was blah. So, I already used 1 8oz can tomato sauce (garlic flavor) & approx 1/2 cup ketchup. I had the minced celery & onion & everthing else (no water) in the sauce but the cumin/paprika/chili powder. I had to scale this to 4 servings as I had 1 lb of grnd turkey thawed. So, I added the cumin & paprika but cut way down on the chili powder cuz mine is super strong. I did simmer everything but the meat in a pot for about an hour...refrigerated that overnight, then added browned grnd turkey the next day and let that simmer till thick. The only item I added (not on the list) was a tsp of poupon style mustard & needed a little more brn sugar due to using tomato sauce. End results were super delish but next time I think I'll add 1/4 C finely diced grn pepper as I was missing that flavor. I didn't make this exactly as written but close enough for me! The cumin/paprika/chili powder made this a much better Joe. : )

These are great. Very tangy with some zip and a little spice. I scaled this down to 1 lb. of beef and used dried minced onion (1 small handful, about 2 T) and half cumin powder half cumin seeds and tossed a pinch of celery seed in too. I let this simmer for an hour since it was for hubby's lunch and that's how much time I had. This was a really great sandwich. I served this on toasted buns. We liked this and would definitely fix this again although it didn't make our favorites, it's still a winner.

When I was a kid I loved Manwich sloppy Joes.  As an adult not so much. This is a great recipe which blows Manwich's away. Like I said; I am no longer fond of that stuff you get in a can & neither is my wife but both of us as well as my son really liked it.

I do not know who Jill is so for the recipe file on my computer I re-named it Sloppy Joe Montana's.  A little humor PLUS good food, what else does someone need?

Yum yum yum! I used wheat buns to serve them and they turned out great. I always have made sloppy Joe's out of the seasonings or cans, but this tops them all!

This was a spicy sloppy joe, good, but not the taste I remember from church suppers of the mid 60's. I will keep looking.

I have used this recipe as a guide several times now.  It is great.  There is a lot of sodium and sugar (or corn syrup) in this recipe, though.  I have been tweaking to cut down on these two things.  When I last made this, I used 28 oz of other tomato products - tomato sauce, some paste, a pureed can of no-salt-added diced tomatoes, and a can of tomato soup.  The soup also has a lot of salt.  I may try low sodium soup next time or just more sauce or paste.  The brown sugar was all the sugar the recipe needed.  And I would rather add a pinch more brown sugar than use ketchup.  I did not add the 2 tsp of salt because there is plenty of salt in the other ingredients used.  I did add some Mrs. Dash seasoning to add a touch more flavor (on top of the other seasonings I had already used).  Oh, also, I only used one tbsp of chili powder because in the past the kids complained of it being too spicy.  I liked it with the full 2 tbsp, but I like things more spicy than the rest of the family.  I may add some more natural sweetness next time by adding diced red or orange pepper.  I don't like green peppers, but the red, orange, and yellow peppers are good.  The kids all gobbled it up and said it was better than the canned sloppy joe.  I like this recipe so much because it is different than the rest.  I decided to give it a try the first time because of the interesting blend of ingredients.  I will keep using this recipe as my guide.

I substituted Ray's Buffalo Sauce for the Worcestershire sauce since I had trouble finding it gluten free. Best sloppy joes ever.

I made this pretty much as is except I added the chili powder incrementally to taste and was south of the 2 TBSP mentioned in the recipe.  In addition, I added apple cider vinegar rather than the 1/4 water.  I have made this 2 times now and taken for a potluck at work.  It has been well received each time and has stimulated requests for the recipe as well.  I recommend using a soft bun--potato or Hawaiian for the bread as well.

Tastes great and easy to make. I added celery as well. Did not use any sugar and was plenty sweet enough. Thanks Jill

I did not change a single thing, Jill - and it was excellent. I needed to feed a group from a two year old through a sixty-four year old, and every one of them loved it. Thanks for the recipe - it's a keeper for sure!

It was so good but way too sweet for our taste. Next time I will use just one tbsp. of brown sugar and see how we like it that way.

ran out of the can stuff and thought how different can it be? ALOT  The old cliche, I'll never go back to the can is true! This was a great recipe. I did use garlic and onion powder because of time constraints. My family has a new favorite sloppy joe! Thanks Jill.

I've tried a few sloppy joe recipes on this site and this one is the best.  Adjusted it a little eliminating the brown sugar, adding 1 TBSP spicy BBQ sauce, used pureed tomatoes instead of ketchup, and added fresh roasted garlic.  It's REALLY good.  My friends absolutely love it.  I am going to try making sloppy joe pockets with Pillsbury dough using this recipe.  I think it will be amazing.

I thought this was a great recipe, very tasty and I had many compliments from my coworkers when I took it for a pot luck luncheon. I chopped the onion and celery in the food processor to camouflage it in the meat, but the flavor was present. While I initially cooked it on the stove, I transferred it to the crock pot for serving it warm. Like one of the other readers, I picked the recipe because there were no peppers recommended as I don't care for their overpowering taste. I would recommend this recipe and have. Thanks for sharing it.

Jill, thanks for the recipe! Did you used to have another sloppy joe recipe on A/R? If you did, it was also very good. I had saved it and used it multiple times. Would love to see you repost it!
