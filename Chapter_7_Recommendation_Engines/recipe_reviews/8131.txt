I'm rating these 4 stars because of the way the recipe is written.  I've been making these with the same ingredients in different amounts for years with excellent results.  The bottom layer should only have 1 egg and end with a very thick consistency.  You should not be able to pour it.  It has to be spread into the pan.  The top layer should have no butter in it, which is probably contributing to the burning.  Bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes, then start checking it.  Depending on your oven, it will only take 25-30 minutes and will not look "done" when you take it out.  These set up considerably after sitting!  If you let them bake until they appear done, then you've probably already ruined them.

I tried this recipe twice and both times it was a dark brown by 20 minutes into the 40 minute cooking time. After the full 40 minutes it was burnt and still raw inside.  I know that my oven temperature was correct, so the temperature given in the recipe (375) must be too high.  I would be interested to see if anyone else had this problem.

have done this recipe twice, I read the reviews so first time cooked it in a fan forced oven at 180dg, covering it with tin foil, removing it at the last ten minutes  second time in a water bath at the same temperature but added a extra 10 minutes, still covered it with tin foil, removing the tin foil ten minutes or so before the end, it is a custard based cake so burning is easy, in the water bath no hassles, base & side were golden brown, no charring

I cooked this at 350 degrees instead of 375 and it did not burn. Next time I am going to try this with a chocolate cake mix instead of the yellow.

I made this on the spur of the moment for a family dinner.  These were very good. They almost have the consistancy of a brownie.  Will definately make again.

Yes i also had that problem with the timing thank goodness i kept checking on it or else mine would of been burnt also. Their good after being in the fridge but the outside gets too hard and just have to keep checking on them if your not wanting to burn them.

Always use a non coated pan when making this.
Grease the pan with Crisco shortening.
This is a wonderful recipe and serves a lot of people.

I used a strawberry cake mix. I  forgot to add the butter to the top layer. I baked at 375 dg for 25 minutes and it was already starting to brown on top when I pulled it out. Looks good, but I gave it 3 stars based on how it was written. By the way the bottom was spreadable, but not pourable.
