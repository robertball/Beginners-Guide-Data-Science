I love cucumber sandwiches.  A tip for the onions:  Use very finely sliced red onion that has been soaked in cold water for at least a half hour.  Gently squeeze out excess water with your hands, pat dry well and proceed with the sandwich making.  Soaking the onion makes for an incredible sweetness minus the sharpness.  Thanks for the recipe.

I was concerned the onion slices would overpower the cucumbers so I did not add them.  I added additional thin slices of cucumber (which needs salt and pepper to taste).  The combination of mayo and softened cream cheese was bland so I added 1 teaspoon of powdered ranch dressing mix.  This gave the sandwiches a nice flavor!

Went over well at my impromptu gathering.  I had all the ingredients in the house, so I whipped them together and got great praises!

Optional Method that we love:
1) Use Mini sourdough bread instead of Rye.
2) Sprinkle top of cucumber with Lemon Pepper (Give it a try)
These do not last long when we make them!

Oh I love these!!!  I mixed the cream cheese with mayo and spread on the rye, used one thicker slice of cucumber that basically took up the entire slice of rye, omitted the onion, and sprinkled with lemon pepper. I die!

Very easy to make.  I made it for a party and got compliments all night long.  If you don't like rye bread, you can also use french bread.

Yum!  I used potato bread for this.  Was worried the onion would be overpowering, but when sliced thin it really added a nice zing - I would not recommend omitting the onion from this recipe!

I made these sandwiches, with a few changes for a Royal Wedding party. Here's a tip: salt the cucumber slices, and water will rise to the top.  Then blot the slices with a paper towel.  This way they won't make the bread soggy.  I used skinny buns instead of the party rye. They're the perfect size for a sandwich with four slices of cuke on each. I seasoned the cukes with lemon pepper (I used Penzy's Florida Spice), and a sprinkling of dill.  I used light mayo on the top of the bun and regular cream cheese on the bottom, and Vidalia Onion.  Very Yummy!

These were a BIG hit .... we all loved them; so easy and refreshing. Thanks for sharing!

Instead of putting everything on party rye, I simply spread the cheese on the cuke and topped with the onion -- very YUMMY.

I really wanted to like this, but it just was not what I expected.  I liked the filling and the cucumbers, but hated it on the cocktail bread.  If I try this again, I think I will use a softer rye bread cut into rounds.

I make these for holiday tea and they are always a hit! I stripe peel the cucumbers as fully peeled tend to get really mushy. I don't bother with onion, I add onion powder and garlic powder to the mayo/cream cheese mixture. I blot the cucumber on paper towels before assembling and they keep really well.

Very tasty & fresh.  Serve very cold, sliced diagonaly they are finger-food size.  2nd time I made these open faced, no mayo, with a sprinkle of dill, next time I'll add a small slice of smoked salmon.

This was a really simply, healthy, and quick snack. We loved them, but we think that a little fillet of salmon would really make this. Will try again for sure.

I had something like this at a baby shower before and thought I'd try it out.  It wasn't exactly like what I had before, but it was pretty good.
