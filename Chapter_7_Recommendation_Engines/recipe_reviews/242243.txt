I've made it twice now and my family loves it! It tastes as good or better than non-vegan bread.

Halved the recipe and made these into 12 muffins, had to substitute walnuts for pecans because that's what I had on hand. Baked for about 25 minutes, turned out moist and delicious.

No drastic changes just added walnuts with the pecans and usd only two large bananas only because I do not like an over powering flavor of banana. :) 
Yes I will be making it again

Best banana bread ever!!  Substituted vegetable oil for the coconut oil, used one pkg of 70% dark chocolate chips in the bread instead of pecans and topped the bread with chopped pecans and cinnamon. The combination of dark chocolate and sea salt is absolutely delicious!
