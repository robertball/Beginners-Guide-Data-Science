Nice change from regular buttered carrots - I used a steam in bag of carrots to save on time and used dill weed instead of dill seed. Overall, very good.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe. I would suggest that one start checking the carrots at 20 minutes so there is just a slight bit of crunch to the carrots. Otherwise it is easy to overcook them.

We loved these! They are similar to "Buttery Cooked Carrots," also found on this site but with a twist (thanks to the dill). I used dillweed as it was all I had on hand and I had to uncover towards the end as the water didn't seem to be evaporating but the carrots were done. My daughter, who ate the most of all of us, asked me to make more when they were gone!! Will keep this easy sidedish around! Thanks Michele!

wow!  this was really yummy.  i never even thought to use dill with carrots, it was such a refreshing taste.  i used 'fresh' dill weed(i had some frozen) instead of the dill seed.  im not sure if that changes the taste, but it was excellent and i will prob. be making this on a regular basis.  thank you!

This was sooo good.  I love carrots and I cook them a lot. I have never tried the dill, but I have used sweet basil a lot.  I cook the carrots till tender, but not mushy, drain them, and then put about 2 tablespoons of butter and a pinch or two of dried sweet basil crumbled over the butter.  That also is a unique taste. Now I have another way of cooking my carrots.  Thank you for the recipe!

These carrots are divine!  Special enough for company, easy enough for everyday.  My 21 month old child couldn't get enough of them.  Perfect!

Yum!  This dish was delicious!  Used dill weed, came out fine.  Also used a little less water and half the sugar, as advised by other reviewers, sauce was fine.  Can't wait to make for company :)

We all liked these, except for my son who doesn't like anything vegetable.  My oldest daughter had seconds (she loves veggies).  I think the cooking time is way too long, unless you like your carrots really soft. We like ours tender-firm so I cooked them accordingly.  This was a nice change from the cinnamon and brown sugar carrots I usually make.

Nice! Make sure you are using dill SEED and not dill weed. The flavors are similar, but they don't sub measure for measure, so if you do go with dill weed, you may want to reduce the amount. My liquid never really 'absorbed,' so I would probably cut down on the water next time. Still, these are really good. Thanks for the recipe!

This is such an easy recipe! I use whatever baby carrots we have left in the fridge and dill weed instead of seed. I also found that there was a lot of liquid left in the pot, but it didn't affect the taste or flavor at all. This recipe goes well with seafood and rice.

This dish went over really big at our house. I rarely make carrots as a side because most recipes call for all the sweet stuff, which my gang does not care for. The kids love raw carrots so I made them tender crisp and used dill weed in lieu of the seed. Very good Michele!

I was surprised with this recipe, It seemed strange to add the sugar and dill to the pan at the start, but I did follow the recipe exactly and was so pleased with the results.  Pretty sure I will be making these again.

Very tasty... I'm not usually a fan of cooked carrots, but the butter+dill really meshed perfectly. Not all of the water was absorbed by the time the carrots were done, but it didn't seem to affect the taste.

Awesome easy and quick side dish!  Used unsalted butter and added green beans and corn in addition to the carrots. Also added a dash of garlic salt (season to your taste). Main A+ seasoning that made this dish was definitely the Dill.

I loved the flavor on these. My husband wouldn't try them though, too bad for him, he missed out on a great dish. I used baby carrots and didn't have dill seed so I used dill weed instead. I microwaved them per steam-in package directions instead of boiling and just added the rest after they were cooked. This is an excellent way to fix carrots, thanks!

This is a good recipe bucause dill and carrots go very well together but slicing the carrits diagonally and then stirfrying them in a little oil and dill and then adding a little water till they are cooked is also delicious.

I have made this recipe MANY times since adding it to my recipe box. I no longer need to do the measurements I've made it so many times. It is amazing, there's never any leftovers with this recipe. 
I usually use a bag of frozen crinkle cut carrots to save time and it works just fine.

I do carrots like this all the time, but find the sugar completely unnecessary if you have organic or garden-grown carrots.  Try it without!

We all enjoyed this recipe. It is a nice change from boiled carrots. Instead of dill seed, I used the fresh dill I had on hand, just a little. I followed the cooking directions to the "T". Once I brought the carrots to a boil and added the ingredients, I reduce the heat and let it sit in the sauce until it was ready to serve.  The butter was just the right amount and helped to marinate the carrots with dill, sugar and salt. Nothing overpowering, just a nice sweetness. I made sure that I did not overcook the carrots and I am glad that I didn't because there was a slight firmness to them. A very good side dish to accompany the salmon and shrimp menu tonight.

Wow! Easy and very, very delicious.  The carrots come out tender but not squishy, and the dill is delightfully present without being overpowering.  This is my new favorite carrot dish!

Used this recipe for carrot hot dogs.  Huge response from the vegan and meat eaters alike.  Put peeled whole carrots in pot with just enough water to cover.  When cooked put into hot dog buns.

This is a great little recipe.  I made a couple of changes - brown sugar instead of white plus a good splash of orange juice in with the water. These were simple and lovely - a very nice side.

These were good but next time I will use less water... pretty much all the water was left at the end of the cooking time but the carrots were tender. Good nonetheless.

We steamed the carrots; then mixed up the butter, sugar, salt and dill (we used dill weed instead of seeds) in a little bowl and poured it over the carrots in the serving bowl. Even my kids liked them. This is a keeper.

I'm generally not a fan of cooked carrots, but I love dill (and who doesn't love butter?!) so I thought I'd give these a whirl.  They were super simple, though I did have to sub dill WEED for dill SEED.  I thought they were *good* (you're probably not going to get more enthusiasm from me for cooked carrots) and while the rest of the band (our dinner guests) ate them, no one ooohed & ahhhed about them.

These were an excellent change from our normal veggie side dish but cooking them longer than 20 minutes is not recommended, unless you like extremely soft (almost mushy) carrots.  We used dill weed for a slightly milder flavor.  I will definitely make these again.

I doubled the recipe and used a large amount of fresh dill weed (couldn't find dill seed) - but it still didn't have a very distinct dill flavor; kind of disappointing. I also did not add sugar; it doesn't need it. Used Earth Balance instead of butter and stuck to only two tablespoons despite doubling the carrots and dill. I'm not a huge cooked carrot fan but these were pleasant.

I definitely did like the dill with the carrots. I used baby carrots instead of whole ones and I used dill weed instead of see. I think next time I will try without the sugar though. Just didnt need any extra sweetness for my personal taste. Perhaps I will also use extra dill. Good recipe!

I made these before using dill weed instead of dill seed and like it much better with weed. The seeds were too strong tasting for my family. Love the recipe, though. It's fast, easy and a little fancier than regular carrots.

Oh my gosh! Never thought I would LOOOOVE carrots, but I just couldn't get enough of these! Yum Yum Yum! The other reviews were right, though, about the cooking time. I checked at 15 minutes and they were done--I will cook them at 12 minutes from now on since the real tiny ones (I used baby carrots) were mushy at 15. I will make these all the time! Thanks!

I made this a little differently than the recipe directs.  I omitted the sugar & used dried dill weed instead of dill seed.  Carrots & dill are a good combo - I am curious how the dill seed would taste so maybe I'll buy some & try it.

This was a great, easy recipe.  I would be careful not to cook the carrots for the full 25 min.  Mine came out VERY mushy.  I like a little mine a little more firm (like steamed carrots).  I'd try cooking for about 10-12 min.

I steamed the organic carrots in the microwave for 3 minutes, and then stirred in the rest of the ingredients.  I didn't have dill seed, so I used dill weed.  Peeled, cooked, and on the table in about 7 minutes.  Love the nutritional breakdown on this recipe, and loved the taste, too!

So simple I didn't think it would make a difference. 
It was great! I'll always make my carrots this way. I sliced mine on a mandolin for even slices and quicker cooking. I did as other review suggested and added a pinch fresh dill.

Excellent!  I removed lid after a while because liquid wasn't disappearing and I didn't want the carrots to be mush.  Once liquid was almost gone I removed and served with fresh some fresh dill as garnish.

Very easy to make. Enjoyed by the family!!! I've eliminated the salt from the recipe and only use a pinch of sugar - my men are none the wiser.

So yummy and easy!  Just found a way to get everyone in my family to eat carrots!  Nice, subtle flavor from the dill.  I followed directions exactly and it was super easy and good.

I used a freshly opened bottle of dill seed. Because I couldn't taste it I tripled dill seed. It was very bland and my family asked that it not be made again. Too bad as I love dilled carrots. Disappointed in the extreme.

A nice change from sweeter carrots.  I used a pound of baby carrots, halved, and they were well-cooked by our standards within 8 minutes; I will check them at 6 minutes next time. I used dill weed rather than dill seed and used a teaspoon of brown sugar.  A quick, colorful, not-too-sweet side dish.

I used baby carrots instead of cutting up big ones. I cooked them for 30-35 minutes but the liquid was all still there and I had to drain them. Everyone thought that they were cooked just right but the flavor wasn't there. wouldn't make again.

These carrots are not only easy, but they are delicious as well.  Who can ask for more than that? I made these while at home alone to test them prior to serving them to my family.  They were SO tasty, I ate 2/3 of the full recipe as my lunch!  I did use honey (1/2 tsp.), instead of sugar, since I am on a special diet that does not allow sugar.  I also used dried dill weed, did not have seed. Normally, I would not rate something that I've made changes on; however, I don't believe the substitutions I made changed the flavor much, if at all. I highly recommend trying this!

This gets a 3 of 5 from my family using the dill weed I subbed b/c I did not have dill seed.  The 2 are very different, so I'd like to try this once I have the seed.

This was delicious and it cooked faster than I expected but it was probably because I cut the carrots into bite size pieces. Good side dish.

These are very good. I didn't add the sugar because I usually find that carrots are sweet on their own without adding to it. I made no other changes.

This is a nice quick way to make carrots.  I used baby carrots, as this is what I had in the house, and cut them in half.  I also used dill weed instead of dill seed, for the same reason.  I omitted the sugar, and used unsalted butter.  Next time, I will increase the salt slightly.  One more thing... it cooked in 15 minutes instead of the 30 I allowed.

This is very good.  I eliminated the sugar completely as carrots are sweet enough, in my opinion.  I served this with lamb braised in tomato, served over egg noodles, and they were excellent together.  I was specifically looking for a non-sweet carrot recipe and this fits the bill.  Thanks.

I fallowed this recipe exact-except for the carrots-I used a 1 pound bag of baby carrots.brought to a boil,covered dropped to simmer set timer for 15 minutes and they were purfect.Carrots ranged to completely tender to just a slight bite.Great.4 stars only because they don't blow you away but are still fantastic and I will make again-would be great with a roasted chicken.

These were awesome!!  We have never liked cooked carrots, but this recipe changed our minds.  I don't think I will make cooked carrots any other way again.  Very good recipe, and simple too, this is the first time I have used a recipe from this site and not have to alter it in some way.
Thanks for the submission!

This is pretty good... not nearly as 'dilly' as I was expecting though - it's more of a dill after-taste... but pleasant. I reduced the amount of water I used (a little over 1/3 of a cup) and that seemed to work for me. Next time I may try adding some dill weed as well.

I used fresh dill and cut the recipe in half. These carrots had a nice subtle flavor. I cooked them for 20 minutes because I like my vegetables to be slightly crisp. I found that the liquid didn't dissolve very much which was probably because I didn't cook them for as long as I was supposed to. I will make these again with less water.

What a pleasant surprise. This goes great with any fish or seafood, I used fresh dill rather than dill seeds and it was great. I also used'maroon carrots' just to be different,  a product I found in the produce section. A product of Texas, it has a dark outside similar to beets, orange inside very nice with the dill.

My favorite cooked carrot recipe by far. I like that it isn't overly sweet. Even my husband, who doesn't like cooked carrots, said these were really good. Will definitely make again. Thank you!

Great flavor! I did not have dill seed, but I did have dill weed, and it came out great. Sweet, rich flavor, and the carrots were not overpowered by the dill. A definate make again.

These were a good, easy side dish.  I followed the recipe exactly (except for using dill weed instead of seed)and the combo of carrots and dill is great.  I'm not entirely convinced that the sugar is needed, so I will probably leave that out next time.

Super easy and tasty.  I also used dillweed.  I just happened to have exactly 8 carrots left but I know next time I will use 1# baby carrots.  I also agree to start testing the carrots at 20 minutes.  Thanks!

I loved this, but because of dieting, i changed it up a bit, I used I cant Believe its not butter (and less that what was said) and instead of sugar I used 2 packets of Sweet & Low.  Also in order to save time and another dish, I added in frozed green beans to the pot when after it boiled...Yummy!

I really liked this recipe and will make again. The only thing I have to say is not to leave them warming in the pan for too long because mine started to burn because of the butter. Next time I will plan for these to finish cooking right on time, not early.

I don't like carrots so this review is not from me. My husband and daughter said these were the worst carrots I ever made. My husband said they were way to salty. My family would not finish these. Sorry to be the bad reviwer.

I don't really like cooked carrots, but I liked these! I made a mistake and thought the recipe said dill "weed" instead of dill "seed", so next time I make them I'll use the seed and see which I prefer. A perfect accompaniment to baked salmon!

I'm not a carrot eater, but my husband thought these were fantastic.  We used baby carrots, and only cooked them for about 10-15 minutes to maintain some crispness.  They made a colorful and healthy sidedish that took almost no time to prepare - that's my kind of recipe!

I gave these 3 stars because two out of the four people eating them gave them an "OK" rating. I myself did not care for them at all, nor did my 2 y.o. daughter, who normally inhales carrots. I found myself wishing I'd made "the usual." Thanks anyway, but this was just not to our tastes.

This is also delicious with grilled steaks. I use dill seed or weed in both rubs and marinades for beef, as it adds sweetness, without being sweet.This dish is easy and lovely, especially if you enjoy dill pickles or other dilled vegetables. This is in my permanent list of recipes!

My kids will FINALLY eat carrots! They love them cooked this way, even my picky eater, and this is such an easy recipe. Thanks for sharing this one!
