Very good recipe!  Thanks for submitting it.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I found the sauce "as-is" was too bland for us--I had to add more oyster sauce and soy sauce to give it flavor, so next time I will just use a little less water and reduce the cornstarch accordingly.   I didn't have shrimp, so I used leftover pork chops cut into bite-sized chunks.  We also left out the bell pepper (just a preference) and added some cut baby carrots for color and flavor.  Delicious!  I doubled the recipe for our family of 8, and it made generous portions, so everyone was satisfied, but there were no leftovers!

Very tasty! I doubled the sauce ingredients, tripled the garlic, added scallions, used snow pea pods instead of snap peas and red bell peppers as opposed to green. Served over 2 pckg. Yakisoba noodles (tossed with sesame oil) and spring rolls. Would make again!

This is a very easy meal to prepare and delicious. The only thing I do different is sub the sesame oil with evoo. Just a personal preference. Good directions. You can also make this with any meat of your choice.

This was simple to follow and allowed for additions or substitutions- added 1/4 c prepared stir fry sauce, (instead of doubling as others suggested )garlic butter (was out of minced), and crushed walnuts as a topping- didn't have cabbage or snap peas on hand. I also added a dash of worsetshire in place of oyster sauce. 
Great lo mien!

This was blander than I was expecting.   Like the other reviews mentioned, make much more of the sauce than called for.   I am going to continue my search for authentic lo mein

had veggies in the fridge to use up so I decided to make a stirfry. The sauce to this one sounded good so I decided to give it a try. I used tofu instead of shrimp and bean sprouts instead of snap peas. The amount of cornstarch called for was too much in comparison to the amount of liquid. The sauce immediately seized up when it hit the hot pan. I had to add another 1/2 cup or so of water to loosen it back up again. This watered down the flavor a little but it was still tasty. I will make this again but adjust the sauce ingredients.

I really liked this recipie, i added hoision sauce and sugar per another recipe, prepared it with green onion, yellow onion, garlic, sugar snap peas and mushrooms. very satisfying and filling. there was nothing I didn't like, but something a little off, could have been the things I added. (reading the other reviews, i added more oyster sauce) the flavors all fade into one another, i think red pepper or some kind of hot sauce would have been a nice addition.

Made this tonight for dinner and it was delicious! I followed the sauce recipe as written except for the fact that I eyeballed the measurements and substituted organic coco amino (healthy alternative) for the soy sauce. I cooked a 16 ounce package of linguine (it seemed more fitting for a stir fry dish than angel hair but that's just my preference) and had to add about 1/3 cup of water at the end to deglaze the pan because my sauce seemed to stick to the bottom of my nonstick pan (weird). Due to what I had on hand, I used about 5 cloves of garlic, one red bell pepper, two carrots, half an onion, two stalks of celery, 2 cups of broccoli florets, half of a bunch of green onion (just the green part), and one pound of shrimp. I did season the veggies while they were cooking with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and an extra splash of the coco amino.  This recipe was easy to prep and quick to cook. Perfect for a week night!! I'd definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

First time making a chinese type dish and we loved it! Husband said was better than what we get from chinese restaurant. Only thing I did diff was no oyster sauce because I couldn't find it in my grocery store and no snap peas because my kids don't like them. I also used a bag of frozen cooked shrimp to be a little quicker. Still came out fabulous and WILL make it again with the egg roll recipe I also found here that was great. Thanks!

I thought this was a tasty dish.  The sauce tasted differently from what I was expecting, but I still really enjoyed it.  I did doubled the sauce although I am not sure if I really needed too.  The amount written in the recipe may actually be enough.  I wasn't able to find snap peas so I substituted shredded carrots in its place.  In the future I will use less celery and less green peppers and instead add more onions and broccoli and maybe even the snap peas if I can find them.  I used lo mein noodles  from an Asian grocery store.  They added the perfect touch.

I liked this recipe and I have made it so many different ways with and without different meats. I didn't think it had enough sauce so I doubled it. I love Chinese food and making it at home is sooo worth it.

I liked it very much. I didn't give 5 stars because I did have to add more flavor to the sauce. I used Lo Mein noodles instead of pasta and it came out great! I will definitely make it again!!

This recipe was ok for me due to the fact that because sugar was omitted it made the meal a bit on the salty side. I suggest adding 1-2 teaspoons of brown sugar to even it out.

This tasted like "real" Chinese food, minus the MSG taste. We subbed chicken for the shrimp, and added whatever veggies we had on hand... (Green and orange peppers, broccoli, carrots, and onion.) My husband likes thing spicy, so he added a tiny bit of sriracha on top and it was awesome!

I used chicken, snap peas, onions, fresh minced garlic, Napa cabbage and shredded carrots instead of shrimp, broccoli, celery, and green peppers. So I made chicken lo mein. I didn't like the other recipes sauce. This sauce is really good.

I only added onions (No Peas or Cabbage) and I doubled the ingredients to make twice as much but otherwise stuck right to recipe. I'm heavy handed when it comes to oyster and soy sauce anyway.

Very yummy and practical here in Thailand. You can adjust veggies and it's still amazing. I'm planning to double the sauce, add a couple extra garlic cloves and use carrot and cauliflower instead of peas. A family favorite for sure!!

This is so much better than take out!  I did use fresh grated ginger and more like 4 cloves of garlic and some scallions.  I didn't have any shredded cabbage so I added in some bean sprouts!  I thought the flavor was wonderful with shrimp, I would not have wanted something overpowering.

I am a vegetarian so left out the shrimp and oyster sauce.  I made the full sauce amount but only made half the pasta called for as there was only two of us - the sauce is a keeper and I would suggest doubling the sauce if you make the full pasta amount because the ratio for us was good.  It is a keeper!

I made this at the request of my 6 year old daughter and it was awesome. I followed the recipe almost to the T, but I doubled the sauce and I'm glad I did; It would have been too dry if not. The flavor is authentic and I actually liked it much better than take out! I have added this to my 'make again' list!

This is delicious!   I did not change the sauce at all except used less ssodium soy sauce and added crushed garlic.  I used onions, carrots, mushrooms, pea pods, broccoli and coleslaw.  The whole family loved it!

It wasn't bad... it just didn't taste like lo mein.  Not sure what it was missing but it didn't have that "tang" that lo mein has.

Very good and simple.  I like this better with thicker noodles so I use linguine.  Put a shaker of red pepper on the table for those who like theirs more spicy.

I made this without shrimp as I was looking to make a veggie lo mein that didn't call for hoison or fish sauce.  This was really good except that I eyeballed the oyster sauce and added too much.  I cut some of the water and used a little rice vinegar and it was a nice addition.  Skipped the cabbage as I didn't have any and added shredded carrot.  Will make again! (and properly measure the oyster sauce so it doesn't come out so strong).
