I made this recipe exactly as written. (Well, to be precise, the package of ground beef I used was 2.01 lb.)
The beef used was 90% lean, the beans were light red kidney beans, and the black pepper was freshly ground.
I also opted for the habanero and the sugar. I cooked the chili for only 45 minutes (the low end of the range given in the recipe) because I was really hungry.
This was also the first time I'd ever cooked with both masa harina flour, and a fresh habanero.
I thought this chili was okay, but I guess I'll only give it a 3-star rating because the competition is fierce in the chili-recipe world. Corn is not a common ingredient in chili, and though I like corn in general, I would've rather it hadn't been in this chili. On the other hand, the masa harina made the chili somewhat thick, which is a plus in my book, since I hate watery chili. The chili had a somewhat undesirable sweetness to it, so if I make this again, I wouldn't add the "2 tsp. white sugar" after all.
Lastly, I used my new electric chopper (not quite a full-fledged food processor) for the first time, and with only a few "pulse"s, the vegetables were pretty finely chopped. Next time I would chop or mince the veggies by hand, since I prefer chili to have a little chunkiness to it, vegetable-wise.
In summary, this chili was decent, pretty meaty, and fairly hot with the added habanero.
I think I will make another batch of this, since I have the other half of the red onion left, and with the changes mentioned

I scaled this recipe to 8 servings.  Used 1/2 lb ground sausage in place of 1/2 pound of ground beef.  I followed the recipe as stated except for the jalapeno or habanero peppers.  I was concerned to would be too spicy for some of the kids eating dinner with us.  I did serve the peppers on the side for those to add to their bowls.  I felt the chili was very thick.  I kept adding water every 15 minutes to try and thin the sauce some.  Next time I may add an additional can of tomato sauce.  It definitely had some heat even without the peppers.

This was delicious! I had to tweak it a bit for the ingredients I had on hand. I used 1 can kidney beans and 1 can black beans. I only used 3 tbsp of chili powder. I used a yellow onion instead of red. I cut out the flour and peppers. I used garlic powder instead of whole garlic and frozen corn instead of canned. Also, I added 1 can of stewed tomatoes because I am a tomato freak. It turned out so perfect! This is my new go to chili recipe.

This Chili was good but SUPER SPICY! Everyone's lips at my dinner party were burning, lol! Next time I will use 1 tablespoon of Cayanne pepper instead of three! It was hard to taste the flovors over the spicyness.

Chili with a reasonable kick but still tolerable. If you don't like spicy foods you may want to omit the habenero or find a different recipe.   I didn't have any masa harina so I used half a cup less water, also used a little less meat  and did half pink beans-- I think the sugar is a fine addition.  Also the recipe is beyond easy to do and pretty much impossible to mess up (like most chilis) so if you can't cook, impress people with this!  My only word of a advice for novices (like me), however, is be careful with the peppers! They will leave your hands burning if you don't take necessary precautions. (i.e don't touch them with your hands (and God forbid youch your hands to your eyes...)

I just signed up on the website and this is the first recipe I made.  I couldn't find a habanero at the store I went to so I didn't put one in it.  Instead of a fresh jalapeno I used a jar of "sweet and hot" jalapenos which worked out awesome.  It still gave the heat, but also added to the sweetness of the chili.  This chili is awesome, I just wish I had the habanero because I love it as spicy and hot as possible.

This chili is fabulous! We love the combo of the masa harina flour with the heat of the peppers. It gives just the right balance to both flavors. We've used serrano peppers as well to add more of a smoky flavor. Always a crowd pleaser!

This recipe was awesome.  I used turkey instead of ground beef and added extra kidney beans.  I used hot peppers from the farmers market.  i know at least one of them was a habanero.  The others Im not sure of.  I made this EXTRA spicy and it still had great flavor.  I seasoned the meat witht the chili powder and some sea salt.  It's  a keeper.

This chili is great! I guess the only thing is my husband can't handle really spicy food, so I wish I hadn't added the Habanero. But other than that its great. I added quite a bit of water. It was a little too thick for me to stir good

I made this the first time I ever made chili and followed the recipe completely (omitting the habanero).  It was so good I won a chili cookoff at work with it.  Since then I've made it twice more, substituting in 1 lb of Italian Sausage and it's been fabulous every time.  It could probably be renamed "Quick and Easy Spicy Chili.  My thanks to Emily H. for posting it.

This chili is really good. I have never done chili before and Hubby liked it. I did not add the habanero peppers because they are toooo hot and I did not have flour but added cornstarch later realizing it that I shouldn't of have used it because it was so thick so i ended putting another cup  of water to it. Besides that Thanks for this recipes it's a keeper.

Yummmm, this is the best Chili recipe I've ever come across, delicious if you like it a little spicy.  I left out the corn, but still tasted great.  My husband couldn't stop eating it for a week.  We love spice so I put in 1.5 habanero chilis and it was just right.

I forgot to add the cayenne pepper, it was slightly dull.  I enjoyed the corn, made a fun texture.  I also omitted one can of kidney beans and added a can of pinto beans.  It was super easy!

this chili is fantastic. for the past 3 years, i have tried a new chili recipe every sunday during football season.

this one wins hands down.

one jalapeno = meduim heat

two = pretty hot

i have not added a habenero yet. i expect that would be VERY hot.

I make this probably 10 times a year. I line the pan with pepperoni while the pan is heating to get the juices mixed with the oil. After meat is browned I put a handful of pepperoni in a food processor and mash it in with the browned beef.  Instead of two cans of kidney beans, I use one can and one can of black beans. For peppers I usually use 3 jalapeños and 2-3 habaneros. Awesome recipe

Great spicy comfort-food chili! I did not use the habanero because I like spicy, not mind numbing hot and I did not add the corn because it does not belong in chili. Otherwise, this is a great easy chili that I have already made 4 times! I used the leftovers for chili cheese burgers with tangy slaw and they were great!

This is a great recipe for chili.  I made it and my roommates love it and so do I.  I don't use the cayenne or the habanero.  I do throw in some green peppers and mushrooms though.

That was my review above (wasn't signed in, I guess!). My boyfriend declared, "That chili is dynamite" which is his highest rating.

This was a great tasting recipe. I used antelope meat instead but thats because I had it in the freezer. I also didn't want to spend money on that flour so I substituted corn meal. I added cilantro, shallots, white onion, and used pinto beans in place of corn. The spice is the perfect amount of heat. Thanks it was wonderful and a crowd pleaser!

Perfect proportions of all the ingredients with plenty of opportunity to spice it up/spice it down "al gusto". I really liked the addition of canned corn, and my husband pronounced this the best chili he's ever had. I food-processed the jalapenos and garlic with the addition of a whole onion, but the onion is the only "custom" ingredient I added.

I have spent a lot of money on other recipes that don't even compare.  This is an absolutely rock solid chili!  I left out the sugar, and only used two jalapenos.  My wife loved it, but it was a little too spicy for my five year old.  He likes spicy, but it was a little too hot for him.  I served it over brown rice, and it was fantastic!

I made this the other day, except i doubled up on the Habanero and added Serrano peppers too.  I must really want to burn a hole in my stomach. I also added more garlic and diced Olives.  I love this recipe, it's easy and the flavor is great.  Thanks for the great Recipe!

I love this recipe!  It is very dense and meaty.  I used serano peppers instead of jalapeno so it was very spicy, but I love that!

I used 1 pound of turkey and 1 pound of ground beef because that was what I had, I seasoned the beef because whenever I don't it doesn't taste quite right to me and I never like the dish. I used a bit too much chili powder and so I eliminated the cayenne. I minced the jalapeno and red onion because I choked on a jalapeno recently and DO NOT want that same experience! used the 2 cans kidney beans and one can corn and added brown sugar instead of white. Knowing my boyfriend loves diced tomatoes, added a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.


This is the first chili I have ever made and I and my boyfriend really like it, I think its a simple chili that can be versatile for anyone and that it has the right amount of kick and sweet!

SPICY is the RIGHT word for this one.
Hubby LOVED it and son did too, but said I need to next time cut the red pepper in 1/2, that is why I gave it 4 stars.
I also cut out the masa flour as I didn't have any and used jalepenos with tomatoes, 1 can each of light and dark kidney beans and left out the corn.
We topped it with cheese and Fritos.
VERY GOOD!!

The chili was AMAZING! I thought that the chili was just the right amount of heat, Lindsey likes a little less, so she thought it was pretty hot. We added 3/4 oz. hot chili powder and 1/2 oz. mild chili powder. We also added a whole red onion, instead of just a half. It didn't seem like too much onion. We mixed everything together, and it seemed a little thick. We then decided to add a little more water, as well as another can of tomato sauce. This made it the perfect consistency. We followed the rest of the recipe and it made enough for 8-10 servings.

Too hot, too many beans, too thick, too much corn....all of those are easy to fix by adjusting quantities of ingredients.  However, this combination of ingredients do create an excellent chili flavor as a base line.  It is my 'go to' basic chili recipe which I tweak depending on the mood I'm in when I make up a pot.

I made this without the meat as a Vegan, and my personal alterations are: added a third can of  kidney beans, along with a teaspoon of cumin, about twice as much corn masa, & extra water, along with two cans of chili-ready tomato sauce. I always use this or a similar recipe for chili, an easy 5 stars.

This is our favorite chili recipe. We love the spice level in it and follow the recipe exactly. We do cut the veggies by hand because we like it chunky! Thanks so much for the yummy recipe.

It was flavorful and spicy just as we like it.  I replaced the corn with more beans and the water with beef broth.  It was good without any extra ingredients but I wanted to use up some items.  Thus, I added celery, the rest of the onion, and a can of medium Rotel tomatoes.  As the recipe simmered in the crock pot, it seemed a bit less spicy as the ingredients had time to combine.

This recipe was delicious. I did however cut the recipe in half and made it in a slow cooker along with a few changes. I browned one pound of ground beef on the stove first and added the tomato paste, sauce, red onion, garlic, jalapeño etc. into the slow cooker. I decided to omit the habenero and the flour and made sure to only put a little over one cup of water to keep the chili to the consistency I like. I'm not sure how I feel about the corn, maybe will add a little less next time. I also used chili beans instead of kidney beans but that's just a personal preference. We like things super spicy in our house and this chili was perfect even without the habenero pepper. I added a bit of cheese on top before serving. I will definitely be making this again!

I made this on a whim, never having made chili before. I wasn't sure what to expect. I omitted the corn and beans per boyfriends request and used 2lbs of ground country sausage and 2 lbs. of tenderized beef stew meat! I only browned the stew meat about half way because I was afraid it would be too rough. It turned out perfect. I didn't have cayanne so I used a ancho chile. I only used 1 tbs of chile powder and 1 tbs of ancho and that was PLENTY of spice!! My lips are burning but I like that it's so spicy!!!

This is absolutely DELICIOUS!!  I did add more water than they called for and didn't put in the mass as it was thick enough and we didn't want it quite so spicy.  Added crumbled corn tortilla chips, A dollop of sour cream and a bit of shredded cheese.  YUM!!

I love the chili and it has the perfect amount of spice if you like spice but don't want it to be too overwhelming.

This recipe is mine and my husbands favorite chili recipe! Its seriously so good. I use ground chuck and I use 1 jalapeno and 1 habanero, cut back on the cayenne to 1 tsp and use mexican style corn.  I also use 1 can black beans and 1 can red beans and add 4 cloves of garlic. I use a slow cooker too and let it cook on low for about 3 hrs which allows all the ingredients to come together. tastes better in my opinion. Everything else the same and it turns out so amazing! Love it!

I made a couple changes to this recipe, but the base was great. I did half ground beef, half chorizo. I only added the can of tomato sauce, not the tomato paste- but I did add 2 cans of spicy diced tomatoes undrained for extra flavor. For the spices I used the recommended amounts of cayenne and chili powder, but also added paprika, cumin and a dash of cinnamon. Was great for Monday night football :)

I got roped into a chili cook off fundraiser at work. I've never made a pot of chilli in my life, so I though I would try this one. Very bold chilli, has a nice kick to it, but not overwhelming. Out of ten entries, this recipe won! I'll be making this recipe often in the upcoming winter. Nice job, thanks for sharing it!

I made this for a Super Bowl party and it is outstanding. There is a fairly good bite of heat with this chili but anyone who likes even just a little spice will be ok with  it. For me, I will add some Blair's sudden death sauce to my bowl to heat it up more? I've always been looking for that perfect chili dog chili recipe and this will be perfect. Nice and thick which is perfect for a chili dog. Great recipe, thanks for sharing it on here.

I love this recipe!! Though, I made a delicious mistake the first time I made it. I used a whole bulb of garlic instead of one clove!! But I will now always use this "mistake". It smells so good while cooking and then tastes even better!! Try it and see what you think!!

I took this exact recipe (with habanero) and added 1lb of bacon to it. I've been told by more than a few friends its the best chili they've ever had.

I have tried many chili recipes over the years and this one is the BEST!!  I finally got it right with this one.  My husband raves about this everytime I make it and tells me NOT to change a thing. I have little girls who this is a bit spicy if I put in ALL the hot items, so sometimes I omit the jalepenos and cayenne.....We can add this in to our individual bowls at the end if we like.  Thanks so much for posting this.....It is delicious and quick. I will add that the one thing I change is I do 1 pound of gr. chuck and 1lb of gr sausage (Bob Evans) instead of all gr. beef.

I made this chili for the superbowl this past Sunday and I should have made 2 servings of this recipe. Everyone loved it, but the fellas at the party ate it all. So now I have to make some for my household.

I can NOT believe how good this turned out. I thought the best chilis were cooked for at least 8 to 12 hours, left overnight etc etc. NOPE. This is not only ridiculously easy and quick, it's delicious. The only thing I did different was change 2 jalapenos to 2 serano peppers because my family loves it spicy. I was supposed to make Shepherd's pie for a Christmas dinner party but due to popular demand I will be making this, which is great, less work for me! Thanks for the recipe! :D
