Easy and tasty sandwiches. A little sweet and a mild barbecue sauce. I scaled this down to 2 servings and it was really good. I made the sauce and simmered it for about five minutes then added in mesquite shaved ham from the deli and let this simmer on low for almost an hour. The sauce was thin and watery though and I would have preferred a thicker stick to your ribs type sauce. This was simple and delicious and I would serve this to company. I'm not sure what sweet chili sauce is as I don't think they mean the asian type so I used plain ol' Heinz chili sauce it wasn't premium or anything just the original standard one. Very good! This is one of the better recipes I've tried for this. Thanks for posting I will use this again.

The basic process is OK; although we found the sauce to be way too sweet. The problem is that the vinegar and mustard are completely overwhelmed by the sugary jelly, brown sugar, and chili sauce. It really needed more tang, heat, or smokey flavor to turn back the candied flavor of the BBQ sauce.
