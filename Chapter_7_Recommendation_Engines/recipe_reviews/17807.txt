We loved this recipe.  I added a little extra cottage cheese and a little garlic.  Instead of rolling the chicken, I just butterflied and filled them. It took much longer to cook than recipe stated.  I ended up baking it at 400 degrees for about 50 minutes.

Yum!!! delicious and good for you!  My boyfriend said that this was absolutely gourmet and couldn't believe that it was actually healthy.  The cottage cheese gives it a creamy moist texture without being overpowering.  I do think it would work better to butterfly the breasts first, or at least pound them to flatten them a bit so you can put more of the yummy filling in.  I covered the breasts with whatever filling was left over, and it was fantastic.

This turned out really delicious...my picky husband even liked it a lot.  Will definitely make again.  I sauteed the spinach and onion with a dab of butter and garlic, salt and pepper before adding to the cottage cheese.  I also added about 2 tbsp of cream cheese to the mixture.  I recommend pounding out the chicken before seasoning (I rubbed chicken with about 1 tbsp of cajun seasoning and 1 tbsp of MAGIC seasoning) because this makes it easy to roll the chicken up.  I baked at 400 for about 30 min and added some mozzarella for the last 10 min.

This dish was awful. I had to cook it for twice as long as the recipe called for, and it tasted bad. The cajun seasoning does not mix well with the spinach/cottage cheese stuffing. I definitely wouldn't recommend it.

This was an ok recipe.  I added garlic because of what other reviewers wrote, if I hadn't added garlic it probably would've been a "2".  I did use fat free cottage cheese so really to me it was a "3", but since the recipe asked for regular I know it would've tasted more like a "4".  I'll probably make it again, it's easy and healthy.  Thanks.

This chicken was okay, but I was really expecting something a lot better.  We love chicken, spinach and cottage cheese, so I thought we would just love this dish but it wasn't too impressive.  Even though I sauteed the spinach onions with some garlic and added other spices, this dish was still bland.  I though the folding and toothpicks was a silly idea, so I cut a big slit in the side of the chicken and stuffed each breast with as much of the mixture as it could hold, then spread the rest out on top of the breasts.  It was good and I'm glad I didn't try the toothpicks and the folding, but it just didnt' have enough spice.

I like that this recipe is a balance of easy and fancy. I did make some alterations though. Cajun didn't sound right to me so I skipped it and just did salt and pepper. I also added a minced garlic clove to the stuffing as well as the juice of half a lemon. I also butterflied the fillets and stuffed them instead of rolling. Next time I think I'll try adding thin slices of gouda, diced bacon, and maybe chopped walnuts. Maybe it wants a sauce over the top. A basic Italian tomato sauce, for example, would be great.

This recipe was great!  My husband complained the whole time I was making because he saw I was cooking with spinach, but he totally cleaned his plate!!!  Like other reviewers, I added a large clove of garlic to the onion and sauted in a mixture of butter and olive oil with a little salt and pepper.  I then added the spinach (be sure to drain completely - I wrung it in a paper towel), and cooked for a few minutes more.  I didn't have quite enough cottage cheese , so I added parmesan and mozzarella cheese and a couple of tsp. of sour cream.  I sliced my chicken into thin layers, added filling and rolled like a jelly roll.  I then pan seared to brown on both sides and finished cooking in the oven (only took a few minutes).  See picture submission (the one that's sliced).

ok, thanks everyone for suggestions.
I sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil, once tender I added the spinach and about 3/4 can of artichoke hearts and sauteed a bit more. Once cooled I added that to the cottage cheese, to which I added 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup grated parm cheese and a bit of garlic powder. I butterflied the breasts and stuffed then closed with tooth picks. Half way through baking I added remaining stuffing. Once everything is cooked through, I served the left over stuffing I had placed in the baking dish over bow tie pasta. My family LOVED it.
Warning: cooking time is much longer than stated in recipe.

AWESOME! I have been using this recipe left and right since I found it a year or so ago. It's been the quick-and-easy yet impressive dish I pull out for company. I always end up with extra filling, so I usually add it to the pan halfway through cooktime so it gets nice and melty and a little brown. I use it as a finishing touch, and have also used the extra filling mixture over noodles. Thanks for this recipe, sorry I didn't say it sooner!

Absolutely delicious. I used thinly sliced chicken breast instead and was able to make 8 stuffed chicken rolls.  I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I sauteed the spinach with 1 small onion, 1 clove of garlic, freshly ground pepper and sea salt. When cooled mixed with the cottage cheese and added a little mozzarella and baked for 25 mins.  I will definitely make this again.

I make this all the time, my family and guests love it! I do change it a little...I add a 'vegetable' spice with a little pepper right into the spinach/cottage cheese mixture. I also use red onions. I then mix in some more spice in the butter before pouring on. I tend to make too much of the spinach mixture which I have used the next night. I have added an 'italian' spice to it and stuffed it in canneloni and used it as a layer in lasagna. Makes a couple of great meals!

This was absolutely delicious! I had a hard time finding a cajun seasoning, but used a mild monterey seasoning and it was still great! The whole family loved it and several people have requested the recipe! Very easy and will definately use again! Thanks!

Pretty good, but the cottage cheese really had no taste.  Next time I'm going to make three changes when I make this.  I'm going to add garlic bread the chicken and substitute ricotta.  I think that will be just the fix this needs.

I searched "cottage cheese" and "chicken" and found this so forgive the following substitions:

Left out the onion
added some softened cream cheese
added a large clove of garlic
created makeshift cajun seasoning with a blend of salt, freshly ground pepper, garlic powder, paprika, chili powder, crushed red pepper, McCormick's Fiery 5 Pepper 
totally forgot the butter

HOWEVER with all these mediocre subs the chicken came out fanTAStic.

My only recommendation is that you blend the cottage cheese, onion, and w/e else you added, then FOLD in spinach - better appearance.

Served with plain white rice.

If I could rate this recipe higher than five stars, I would. This was hands down an awesome dish. I usually make all recipes according to the directions the first try and then adjust to my family's tastes however I added some chopped fresh baby portabella mushrooms to the spinach/cottage cheese mixture. It was fabulous, not only was this dish extremely tasty it looked gorgeous on the plate as well.

This turned out really well! The only difference I made was I seasoned the cheese mixture with salt, garlic powder, paprika, and dried parsley. Full of flavor and low in fat. Yummy!

This was pretty good for a low-cal chicken meal.  I did not use the cajun spice, but sprinkled on garlic salt & pepper.  I also baked it for an hour because my meat was pretty thick.  I would suggest pounding out the chicken breasts before filling & wrapping them.  I also used fresh spinach rather than frozen--that was good.

Made this dish last night & my boyfriend & I both really liked it. I took some of the suggestions from the reviews. I sauteed spinach, onions, 2 cloves of garlic & then added that to cottage cheese & 2T of cream cheese mixture. I didn't have cajun seasoning so just put Seasoning Salt on the chicken. I also just cut chicken in 1/2 & filled them that way. Put extra on top & topped with shredded mozzerella at the end. Also baked for about 40 min. at 350. Its very easy & a definate keeper!

I took a lot of recommendations from these reviews, and it turned out wonderfully.  I added a minced clove of garlic, and sauteed the veggies before mixing them with the cottage cheese.  I added some cream cheese to the mixture as well (about 2 tsp).  I cut the breasts and stuffed them that way, instead of flattening and folding.  Used extra filling ontop, and used 4T of butter.  All in all, a great recipe that both my husband, my picky toddler, and I love!

This recipe was pretty good. You definetly have to add garlic. I also pounded out the chicken and folded in half to put in the filling. I substitued ricotta for the the cottage cheese. Next time I think I will throw some artichokes into the mix and it will be great!

This dish was delicious!  I added garlic to the spinach mixture and sauted the veggies before stuffing the chicken. I used about 4tbsp of butter and topped the chicken off with some fiesta blend cheese.  Highly recommended.

Not a winner on our table. The spinach flavor just didn't work for us.

I cooked this last night for dinner along with a salad and a loaded baked potato. everyone loved it, now they're begging me to cook on a regular basis. i used 4tb of butter instead...which i think gave it good flavor, and kept the chicken moist. i baked it longer than it recomended(40 mins?), but it was well worth the wait.

Wonderful dish!  Because we read the reviews prior to making it, we made some slight adjustments and it was delicious!  Instead of spinach, I used greens, which in my opinion are more flavorful and added garlic and Penzi's pasta sprinkle to the mix.  I also slit the breasts to form pockets rather than roll them and liberally sprinkled red pepper and seasoning salt on them.  I then topped the breasts with the remaining mixture and it was bliss.  The cottage cheese offset the red pepper quite nicely. Our tummies thank you.

I followed some of the other reviews. Because I was pressed for time, I seasoned my breasts with cayenne and threw them on the Foreman grill for 3 mins per side. I sautéed my spinach and onion in a tiny bit of EVOO and added the 2tbsp butter at the end. Then I mixed in the cottage cheese, salt and pepper and just placed it on top of the chicken. I butterflied the breast but just end up making 2 pieces out of one. It was incredibly delicious!

I used boneless thighs because that's what I had on hand.  Obviously breasts would be better because not much filling would fit inside smaller chicken pieces.  Layered the extra filling on top of everything.  I used a 6 oz. package of fresh baby spinach and reduced it along with the onion and some garlic.  Cooked at 375 degrees for around 40 minutes.  It was superb!  I served it with rice pilaf.

Great chicken recipe! I almost didn't make this dish tonight because we got home kind of late from running errands, and I thought this recipe would take a while to make since it's kind of "fancy". It is so simple and doesn't take much time at all. I think the prep time only took about 15 minutes or so and then popped it in the oven. I am so glad that I decided to make this recipe because it was loved by all. The only thing I changed was the baking temperature and time because I have found that this works perfect for getting a nice, juicy chicken without overbaking - 375 for 35 minutes. Works with every baked chicken dish I have ever made! I have seen a lot of reviewers say that they didn't use the Cajun spice mix because they thought it didn't go with the spinach/cottage cheese mixture, but it gives it a little kick along with the creaminess. Thank you for this wonderful dish that will be made again and again!

Delicious!  The only problem I had was evenly flattening the chicken.  But the results were so outstanding I will be making it again.  Used Kickin Chicken seasoning and added 1/3 c. cream cheese to the cottage cheese.   Yum, yum.  Thanks, Beth

Really tasty and quick.  I used fresh spinach and added a bit of garlic as others recommended.  I also halved the chicken breasts and stuffed them in--I didn't quite understand the concept with the toothpick.  The result was a fresh tasting supermoist chicken!

Very easy & quick to make, specially when you are running late in preparing dinner and you have 100 other things to do. Just prep and bake. The even better thing is it is so delicious! All the ingredients compliment each other.

My husband loves this chicken and I love it because it is SO easy to throw together. I did some minor alterations: added garlic, cayenne pepper and white pepper to the spinach/cottage cheese mix. Instead of using cajun style seasoning I used Greek seasoning mix and I used olive oil instead of butter over the chicken.

This was an enjoyable dish. I did make a few changes. I flattened the chicken breast and then sprinkled the Cajun seasoning on the piece of meat, after that I pan fried it. Once I took the breast of chicken out of the pan I let it cool before placing the cottage cheese mixture onto it and placed it in the oven for thirty minutes. One final addition was the pine nuts to the cottage cheese mixture. Absolutely divine.

This was okay.  Other than the overpowering amount of cajun seasoning, it seemed kind of bland.  If I make this again, I would reduce the amount of cajun seasoning by half, if not more, and then reduce the amount of spinach.

Although this had a good flavor, the chicken was not cooked all the way through, even after baking it longer than the recipe called for. I ended up putting it back in the oven for an additional 20 minutes, while the rest of my dinner got cold. I would recommend baking at least 45 minutes, if not longer.

This recipoe was wonde4rful and SO simple.  I made it for my boyfriend and he was speechless, i drizzled the butter over the chicken breasts, and used a bit if creole seasoning all over.  I did have to bake it for a while longer than directed... maybe pierce the breast a few place for more even distribution of heat, but other wise VERY tasty, not bland at all, will make again and again

I was very disappointed. This is not very flavorful, and the onions didn't have time to soften. Maybe if you sauteed the spinach and onions with butter it might have been better.

I had to bake this at a higher temperature for much longer than the recipe states.  350 degrees for fifty minutes.  I would suggest making slits at the top each breast to distribute heat more evenly. My husband really liked it and he's picky. He thought the onion really brought out the flavor in everything.  My guests said, "Mmm, good flavor."

This was a great base recipe. I opted to use chicken thighs instead because I like the dark meat much better. I removed the skin first. I added garlic and shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture and substituted with fresh spinach. I used Mccormick's Jerk seasoning, garlic pepper,ginger powder & poultry season on my chicken. I omitted the butter & wrapped the chicken with bacon! It did cook a little longer than the original recipe called for, but it turned out a lil more fattening but a Lot more delicious.

I add a little more cottage cheese and butterflies the chicken,  cut them apart and flattened them a bit to cut the cooking time to 25 minutes.  My kids 6 years and 1year loved them!

This dish is just plain weird. I'm a fan of all the ingredients, but they don't work together. After reading the other reviews, I first sauteed the spinach and onion in butter, plus added extra cayenne for zip. There's something about hot cottage cheese that doesn't do it for me, and as much as I like cajun spice, to my palate, it doesn't belong here. I won't be making this again.

Great blend of flavors and can be done low-cal.  We sauteed fresh spinach in olive oil and pounded the chicken flat as it's easier to fold over that way.  No need to drizzle with butter, as the dish has plently of flavor with the seasonings and cottage cheese.

This is delicious!  I did not have any spinach so I used roasted brussel sprouts and it turned out so good.  I think broccoli could also be substituted.  I cooked it for about 40mins @ 400 degrees F.  The cottage cheese is a nice light alternative to the usual cream cheese used in stuffed chicken dishes, and it does melt out that much.

"Its a Keeper" thats what my husband and I both said after trying it. I read alot of the reviews and made a few changes...  subsitute half of the cottage cheese with low fat cream cheese, add garlic, add onion powder(didnt put yellow onion in), add italian seasoning, and instead of cajun seasoning I used a spicy montery seasoning we had...   baked on 400 for 30 min, and for the last 10 I sprinkled swiss cheese on top. A+++, next time will try with fresh spinach

Wow!  These chicken breasts were awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly, and my husband and I both loved it.  The cajun seasoning added just the right amount of kick, perfect with the creamy spinach stuffing.  This would be a great company dish for spinach-loving friends :)

I found this recipe to be rather bland.  My husband who eats everything didn't eat the leftovers like he usually does.  I would definately kich it up a little bit with some swiss cheese or some dijon mustard.

Great Recipe !! I changed things up a bit. I used 8 chicken breasts and cut them sideways (like a taco) and stuffed that way. I pretty much doubled everything. I seasoned the chicken with Tony Sasserie's Seasoning. I sauteed fresh cut garlic/butter/pepper/onion/alittle more seasoning in olive oil then added the spinach and cottage cheese. I let it cool and baked at 400 for 50 min. You will have tons of filling - about half way thru the baking I added more stuffing mix to the chicken. TASTED GREAT. My friends LOVED it.

Husbands comments say it all "That chicken was the bomb" The chicken was so moist, even after 2 days. The only suggestion he made was next time to add a little mozarella because he would like them even more cheesier! Very easy to make too.

I deviated a little bit.  I butterflied, then pounded the breast before filling.  I also replaced the cajun seasoning with a garlic italian seasoning.  Cook time is longer than it says.  Everybody loved this dish.

I LOVE this recipe.  The only change I added is to use dry curd cottage cheese instead of the liquid kind. I liked it better that way. I also added some garlic powder to the cottage cheese mixture.  but its a great healthy recipe!

Easy enough for dinner parties, the stuffing is enough for 8 chicken breasts. But then I also used twice the cottage cheese, and put the seasoning on the top, bottom and inside the butterfly cut.... yummm yummm

This meal was fast and easy!  I was a little bland... So I think next time I am going to add some parmesean cheese to the mix and than top with Mozzarella in the last 10 minutes... The receipe said to bake it for 25 minutes... We had to add an additional 15 minutes... Overall it was very good.... Even my 12 year old son liked it, who doesn't like cottage chesse or spinach... He said it was really good....

Nice appearance! I didn't have toothpicks and they held just fine. Very easy, but a tad bland. I would add some garlic to the onion and something more spicy to kick it up a notch!

Love this recipe for its ease, flavor, and healthiness.  Agree that it takes a bit longer to cook than recipe indicates. However, it's minimum prep work and well worth the wait!  We use no-fat cottage cheese and drizzle no-fat liquid butter to make it more healthy.  Definitely worth trying!

WONDERFULL & EASY!  Loved it & soo did my boyfriend.  I might add more cottage cheese next time but that's just because I love the stuff.  The chicken's flavor was great and the cajun seasoning added the just needed kick.  Definite keeper!

This recipe was great. You can make it really healthy if you are looking for a low-fat dinner.  Just use fat-free cottage cheese.

We loved this Chicken Recipe. I did add fresh garlic and used fresh spinach instead of frozen. Also, I didn't roll the chicken. I simply made a "pouch" and added the stuffing mix. I took the advise of another and baked at 375 degrees for 40 minutes.  It remained juicy! I will make over and over again. Thank you!

Three stars because I felt I had to modify the recipe a fair amount. I sautéed the onion and spinach and added a couple cloves of garlic, also sautéed. Then, I threw in a palm-full of bacon bits (real bacon). Baking time is more like an hour. Husband declared it delicious, so all’s well that ends well.

I doubled the recipe so I could use a whole container of cottage cheese and an entire bag of family size spinach . I plan to freeze a batch. I used onion powder (hubby won’t eat onion) & fresh garlic to sauté the spinach as recommended by another commenter. I also substituted olive oil for butter- turned out great!

I've been meal prepping for about 6 weeks now, and eat a lot of chicken breast. I've been growing tired of eating breast and was looking for new healthy, fun and tasty way to cook it. I stumbled upon this recipe and was too excited! Not only if it completely different from how I normally  make chicken, but it's entirely healthy! I made a few changes to the recipe:

Awesome dish!  I added the Cajun spices to the mixture and seasoned my chicken (both sides) and drizzled with Cajun & lemon juice when I stuffed them.  I highly recommend pounding out breast. I also broiled on high the last few minutes for extra crispy browning. It did cook about 50 minutes when finished. Will make again maybe add some sour cream to mixture when not counting calories ;).

Amazing recipe! 
Made this but instead of pouring butter on top I made extra filling and put it on top.  In addition to that I added some balsamic viniger to the filling to  give it extra taste.

We really liked the concept and healthfulness of this dish. I will admit that I substituted Italian seasoning and garlic for the cajun seasoning and onion, respectively. I also omitted the butter to make it a bit lighter, and the chicken was still moist and very flavorful. Unlike other reviewers, I had no problem securing the breasts with the toothpicks. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

This was an ok meal but it does have potential to be something. Like some of the reviewers said and are right this is very bland, even after I altered it just a tad. I will make this another time but alter even more. Look out for a repost.

This recipe was pretty good.  I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter and took up a few of the suggestions about adding garlic cloves, more seasoning (I like things well seasoned) and sprinkling parmesan cheese on top. It took a bit longer to cook than recipe states, but chicken was pretty moist.  It still felt like it was missing something though; however, I will cook again perhaps with some variations.  On the plus side, my DH and picky sister cleaned their plates.

This was pretty good chicken!  My stove didn't work so I made it on a skillet w/ the butter and covered it for about 10min on the first side and 7 on the other.  It was a very juicy.  I can see what people mean about the bland flavor.  The chicken was really good (because I covered it in cajun seasoning) but the filling could use just a little kick.  Next time I will try peoples suggestion of garlic to see if that helps.  A bit of parmesan cheese could be tasty too.

Worked out great. According to my husband, it's just as good leftover. And, INCREDIBLY filling. We were surprised.

Oh so good! I added about 1/2 cup of light cream cheese to the spinach mixture. I didn't have any cajun seasoning, so I left that part out. I was too lazy to butterfly the breasts and stuff them. So, instead, I just put the spinach in a baking dish, layed the breasts on top, and them sprinkled them with some grated cheddar. Really juicy and nice flavour! YUM :)
