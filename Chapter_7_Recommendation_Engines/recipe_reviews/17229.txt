I'm giving this 5 stars because the peanut butter filling was wonderful. I didn't have whole graham crackers, so I used some graham cracker crumbs, sugar and butter to make a baked graham cracker crust. When that cooled, I prepared and spread the peanut butter mixture over it. I followed THAT part of the recipe exactly, and was very very impressed with the texture and taste of the final product - tasted very much like "real" peanut butter cup peanut butter. I really liked the crust underneath the peanut butter and chocolate, and will make it again exactly as I did before. It's an extra step, but well worth it, in my opinion.

Mmm!  This has a very smooth center, making it different from all of the other peanut butter bars.  I made a graham cracker crust with g.c. crumbs and butter, only because I didn't have graham crackers on hand--it is delicious!  I stuck it in the freezer after putting it together, and it was set and ready to eat in minutes!

Certainly not low in calories, but EXCELLENT and EASY.   I don't understand the 50 hr. wait time in the recipe....I served them the next day and they got rave reviews.  I know I will make these again and again....NO baking required! I added some extra baking chocolate and 1/2 cup rice krispies to the chocolate.....

These are delicious and very easy to make.  My problem was the chocolate layer cracked on every piece when cut, so they didn't look too pretty.  Next time I may add a tablespoon of peanut butter to the chocolate while melting it, this should make a softer texture thus easier to cut.

wow wow wee wow! I didn't have any graham crackers so I just left the whole crust part out. Maybe next time I'll try a layer of crackers, chocolate, then peanut butter and chocolate on top.

This recipe was SO good, but it has to much chocolate my options are to drizzle the chocolate on and do not spread it or to do half the chocolate and spread thinly

These are VERY good and easy. The whole graham crackers make the topchocolate layer crack after they have set because they still shift underneath while cutting. Will make it with crushed grhams and butter as crust next time.

This recipie is so good and super easy.  I served it to a group of teenage boys and they all said they were incredible.  I think that next time I make them (and I'll be making them often!) I'm going to make a crust out of chocolate graham gracker crumbs and butter instead of the plain graham crackers.  These are a must try!

Have been making these yummy bars for years. If your chocolate shatters or cracks during cutting, try heating your knife with hot water (and drying the blade)before cutting the bars. Use the tip of the knife to score the bars before cutting straight through.

Wow, these are great, and sooo sweet.  I usually don't like it when people modify recipes, but I did it this time myself, by making a chocolate graham cracker crust, instead of using regular graham crackers (really because when my sons and I went to the grocery store, my sons were asking for so many things and I kept saying no, no ,no, because they had gotten things earlier in the week, so I was trying to get out of there as quickly as possible-thus no crackers) but I did have the chocolate ones at home.  Well anyway, all the peanut butter lovers I had try this, loved it!  A real winner.  I also used loe fat peanut butter, but after everything else that we put in these I thought, hummm....?

These are so simple and so yummy. I had to add a little more powdered sugar because the peanut butter mixture was too creamy and I was afraid it wouldn't set up on the graham crackers. I ended up adding an addition 1/2 cup and it worked great. They were a huge hit and so simple!

These are excellent bars.  They take more than 10 graham crackers to cover the bottom of the pan, and I would suggest using a pizza wheel to cut them.  I didn't have any of the problems other reviews mentioned.  They took next to no time to make and were FANTASTIC.  I used only organic ingredients.

I made these years ago, but had forgotten! They're excellent! I had no problems whatsoever, but for those who had trouble 'cuz the peanut butter didn't spread easily, you could use creamy p-butter and grind up a few salted peanuts and sprinkle over the top of the whole thing..problem solved!

Very easy, quick & delicious.  I know it's probably not worth it, but I did mix ground flax seed into the peanut butter, giving it just a wee bit of healthy stuff.  It mixed in perfectly, kids can't even tell it's there.

These are the BEST bars I have ever had!  Can I give these 100 stars? The peanut butter filling is really the show stopper.  I used creamy instead of chunky peanut butter and it had a fabulous texture.  Very sweet, very rich, and very peanuty.  It seems lots of similar recipes lose one of those features but this had all three.  I also liked the semisweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate used in many chocolate/peanut butter recipes, it was a richer taste and had better contrast with the peanut butter.  Lastly, I really liked the crunch of the whole graham crackers for the crust -- it reminded me a little of Peanut Butter Twix.  You'd lose that if you used the graham cracker crumb crust mentioned by many reviewers.  When cutting it might help to cut while the chocolate is warm and also cut along the cracker divisions if possible.
Also, I increased the recipe by 50% and it fit perfectly on a cookie sheet with 15 whole crackers (didn't have the jelly roll pan mentioned). Plus more bars for me!

These were awesome! I even had to improvise when I didn't have enough graham crackers and had to use part crushed up Vanilla wafers. It must have worked, because they turned out great & tasted great. I will us all Graham next time to see the difference if any... but it worked! They freeze well and were a hit at our housewarming party! YUM! Can't wait to make them for the holidays!

Fabulous! A little bit of a pain to spread on the gram crackers but the end result is worth it. Very rich so cut in small squares.I put them in the freezer before and after the chocolate topping. made it easy to cut and quick to serve. Crackers stay nice and crisp even though they are kept in the fridge after you cut them. I like that!

I made this for a casual dinner party I had.  These literally taste like peanut butter cups (only better) and everyone loved them.  I don't like the chunky peanut butter, so I used smooth.  Very easy to make. The most time consuming part was you had to refrigerate each step.

I didn't have graham crackers so I doubled the recipe and made 2 peanut butter pies using two graham cracker crusts that I already had instead. I covered the top of one with white chocolate and the other with chocolate. The whole family really liked this, and I love the easiness of it!

I really like this recipe.  I like the crunch of the graham cracker bottom which was incredibly simple to do, especially since I always have graham crackers on hand, but not graham cracker crumbs.  I took the advice of a couple of reviewers since it was a repeating concern that they cracked while cutting: #1 I stirred in about 3-4 T of peanut butter into the chocolate to melt together in the microwave which made the crust not so brittle, and #2 I cut it with a pizza cutter which worked famously.

This is a VERY quick and TASTY treat.  I used smooth peanut butter (as this was all I had on hand) so my creamed mixture spread quite easily. I also used graham crumbs as other users suggeted. YUM, YUM.  Was ready to eat in under an hour.

So easy!   But too sweet for me, next time will try it with half the sugar.  Also adding a tablespoon of butter to the chocolate when melting it in the microwave (30 sec intervals on high) is the way to go !  Easy least

Taste was awesome but they were a lot thinner than I anticipated- they looked more like cookies than bars. Next time will make in a smaller container so they'll be thicker

I used creamy peanut butter and added 2 tbsp of peanut butter to the chocolate. My kids and husband devoured them. These are now a staple in my house. I'm making them again now with dark chocolate mixed in.

Spreading the peanut butter mixture over shifting crackers was a major pain!

Probably would be better if you crushed the crackers up or did this in a graham pie crust. They fell apart when cutting them up.

If you heat your knife in hot water before attempting to cut these into bars, the chocolate layer will not break

I made this and after reading some of the reviews made some changes. Graham Crackers cracked... someone suggested a graham cracker crumb crust... well after making the crust I "painted" it with melted milk chocolate mixed with a tablespoon of melted peanut butter. I let it set up (harden) and then did the filling part using only 1/3 c + 1 tablespoon of melted butter and only used 1-1/2 c of the confectioner sugar.  Not too sweet.  After that set up, I topped it with more melted milk chocolate and melted peanut butter. They did not crack when I cut them with a warmed knife. I took them to the office and the pan disappeared in minutes.  The reviews were "great", "can really taste the peanut butter", "not too sweet". Will make again this weekend to take to the other office I work in.
