This is an amazingly easy dish for potlucks.  I simply increase or decrease the amount of Jalapeno depending on where I'm bringing it.  People appreciate the fact that there is no meat, dairy, or oil.

This recipe is wonderful.  It takes a little time to cut everything up, but once it's made you'll be glad you did. Let it sit for an hour or two before you eat it to let the salt and cumin get absorbed into the ingredients.  I was a little skeptical about the combination of hominy and black beans because my family can be really picky, but they loved it. Serve it with some chips and enjoy!!!  I used Pace MEDIUM hot sauce, but I think next time I will use the HOT sauce to give it a little extra bite.  My kids liked it like I made it this time, it was pretty mild.

Wow, this makes a big batch. This recipe was great. I will use a little less salt next time. I did add an extra can of black beans and will add more hominy next time. Made this for a side with fajitas, ended up putting on the fajitas with cheese and sour cream,,,was wonderful! Took the extra to work and the gals couldn't leave it alone. Thanks, I plan on using this many more times.

I really liked this.  The only change I will make next time is to reduce the salt to 1 teaspoon.  Delicious with tortilla chips as a snack.

This recipe is wonderful. I let it sit in the icebox while I finished preparing the rest of our meal. It was very good as a side relish with our brown beans and ham but the next day I took the leftovers to work and it was even better with chips. The guys in the office loved it. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you.

Fantastic and easy to prepare. I halved the amount of salt and I think I'll half the amount of sugar next time though.

This is a fun, refreshing, different type of salad.  I LOVED it.  However, I would not add the sugar and definitely not as much salt as it calls for.  I threw in some diced avocado and a splash of lime juice and it added a good flavor to it.

I really loved this and my kids did too! My husband likes the cowboy caviar I usually make. I used a can of corn for hominy(what is this?) because I couldn't find hominy. I put an extra jalapeno in per my taste. This really had alot of flavor, but was a bit too salty so I will cut back on that next time. Thanks for recipe!

Awesome!  My family loved this recipe.  I did leave out the picante and the jalapenos because my 4 year old doesn't like anything too spicy.  We used it on soft tacos with refried beans.  A very healthy option and it was so tasty we didn't need cheese!  Will add tomatoes next time if we do it as an entree again!  Thanks for the awesome recipe, never knew what to do with hominy!

My husband didn't measure anything exactly, and we were out of cilantro, but despite that, this salad was fabulous!  It would only be even better with the cilantro, I'm sure.  He used canned jalapenos because the fresh ones we had were incredibly hot and we wanted our kids to eat the salad.:-)

WAY too much salt! I wish I had read more of the reviews.  I'm not alone. It was good otherwise. I did add some lime juice, it needed that acidity,  I think.

This was shockingly delicious! I thought it was going to be too simple to be good but it was incredible! This will definitely become a staple at future family get-togethers, parties, and carry-ins!!! Even better the second day....could not stop snacking on it!
