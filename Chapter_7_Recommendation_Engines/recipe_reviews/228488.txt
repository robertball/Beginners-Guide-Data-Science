I made this yesterday and it was wonderful.  I used butter (instead of oil)to brown 8 chicken thighs (instead of cutting up a whole chicken).  When I make this recipe again, I will skin the thighs and drain most of the drippings before cooking the onion mixture in them.  I ended up with a lot of grease in the bottom of my dutch oven.  I'd make this dish for guests.  It was tasty and colorful!

Made this last night for dinner.  Simple easy recipe that taste wonderful.  Made a full recipe (for 8 servings) and my wife and I finished about half last night and had the left overs for lunch.  Tastes just like the Arroz con Pollo I used to get in Panama City and Colon.

I made this for a fathers day dinner for my family.
I didn't use raisins only because I and my father do not like them.
Im sure it would have given it a sweet bite so I was thinking it was going to taste a bit bland without them but it was absolutely excellent! Definitly going to make again.

OUTSTANDING! I used 5 extra-large chicken thighs (4 lbs.) and the result was heavenly. I used 2 14-oz. cans of chicken broth and 1/4 oil for browning. In the future, I plan to use less broth and 2 tablespoons oil since the browned chicken adds fat. You may want to bake it initially for only 1 hour for firmer chicken. I baked it for 1 1/2 hours as called for so that the meat would be falling off the bone which is how I like it.

I have made this twice in the past 2 weeks. My husband is very picky and also on a health kick, and I feel this recipe fit the bill for him. I used chicken breasts and brown rice and cut the salt and oil for browning. I also added a generous spoonful of cumin because we love that flavor. Don't skip the raisins! I thought they sounded a little odd but they added a wonderful sweet kick.

This was quite good. I made 1/2 the recipe for just my husband and I. I used 1/2 a chicken bouillon cube with 1.5 c water to make the broth. I added 1/2 tsp ground cumin to the spices, which I know made it taste even better. I'm saving this recipe.

An absolutely delicious recipe!  Such a comforting and hearty winter dish, and loaded with sweet/salty/garlicy flavor.  I just used 1 1/2 lb boneless/skinless thighs, and the other ingredients as listed.  I added two tablespoons of sofrito as well.  I also added the peas, raisins, olives (green) and pimentos with the rice and other ingredients to make cooking this a breeze.  I baked for an hour, covered, since I was using less meat, and boneless thighs.  A definite do-over, thanks for sharing this yummy recipe with AR.

Good recipe. I think next time I will just add the chicken and stock to the pot and let that cook for an hour, then add the rice for the last half hour. 
Came out too mushy following current instructions.

Yum! This was great! So tasty, and I loved the olives (I used green olives) and raisins in it so much the next time I make I think I will use more! My Peruvian mother-in-law was visiting when I served this, and she really liked this dish very much! Thank you for the recipe! Oh! I used chicken breasts as I did not have a whole chicken on hand.

Using cooked cubed rotisserie chicken, I cooked this in the instant pot for 3 min high pressure. 11 minutes natural release.   Cooking rice in an instant pot is only a 1:1 ratio of liquid to grain. So I reduced the chicken broth in this recipe to 1 cup for the 1 cup of rice.  
I made 6 batches like this for international day at school. Turned out great!

I’ve made this twice now and both times the rice came out mushy. I use jasmine rice and my rice is never mushy but I think this recipe has too much liquid or something. The second time I made it I bought boneless chicken thighs and cooked it all on the stove hoping with the shorter cook time it would t come out mushy but it did anyway. Flavor was pretty good but nothing great. I will not make this again.

Made as is, just minus the raisins and peas. And only had minced garlic instead of cloves. Was a bit salty so next time I'll use 1 1/2 tsp of salt instead but it was so good. Will definitely make it this way from now on

Super delicious!!! I made a few adjustments: canned pimentos instead of fresh, legs/thighs instead of a whole chicken, used significantly less oil than indicated, and I added carrots. The recipe says to put the chicken back in before the rice but I found that the flavor of the rice was even better if you sautéed it for a second with the onions, etc. before adding in the chicken and other ingredients.

This was amazing! The only changes I made were extra cup of rice and doubled the tomatoes. Was very hesitant on the pimentos and raisins but decided to stick with the recipe, so happy I did! Yum. Will be making this again.

This is as close to a Cuban dish i learned and loved from a chain of great family Cuban restsurants in Miami called Los Carretas. There are a few differences to make it authentic Cuban family style. Green olives not black, capers not raisins, a pinch of saffron in the broth so that has time to slow cook into the rice and chicken. This is what colors the rice, so do not use yellow rice, long grain white rice, or if health conscious long grain organic brown rice is yummy in this too.

Delicious! made according to the recipe except used chicken breast and thighs and omitted the pimento because I used chopped sweet red bell pepper in the sauce instead of green. A wonderful change from my usual. Will certainly make again. Judi David

I made this as written, only without the pimientos and raisins. Even without them, it was delish. Thanks!

This recipe is very good. Just like what my mom used to make. The only negatives are that it's a bit salty and there's not enough rice. Next time I will cut the salt in half and double the rice.

I was excited about this dish but the rice went to mush.  I think it would have been better with brown rice perhaps.

Made this dish last night following the recipe exactly as written. The whole family loved it. They were suprised by some of the ingredients and un-expected flavor. I would definately cook this dish again. Already added to my keeper cook book. I would add more liquid to the dutch oven as the rice sucked up all the chicken broth but added some nice carmelization to the ingredients. Added 2-3 cups of broth when adding final ingredients.

Used 4 lbs of boneless skinless chicken thighs. Was a little leery of the raisins but it turned out great! The raisins gave it just a little hint of sweetness.

Made it the way it was described, including raisins. I omitted raisins the first time, and it was good, but with the raisins there's minor sweetness that rounds out the dish. I added peas to the rice

We loved it. I used green chilies instead of green peppers because that is what I had. It was great. Also I had chicken breast instead of whole chicken.

I've made this twice so far and both times came out excellent. I used chicken thighs both times but The second time I skinned the chicken and it cut down on the grease in the dish. Definitely a keeper. Very unique flavors.

This was great. I don't like raisins at all but like to stick to the recipe the first time.They made the dish!  Next time I might use a little less liquid. Was done after an hour n the oven

Fantastic!  Will be making this again and again.  Don't skip any of the ingredients,  they are all essential.  The photo shows green olives but the recipe calls for black which I used.  Next time I think I will use half black and half.green .

This turned out amazing. I used chicken breasts and forgot the green pepper but added 2 jalapeño peppers for some bite. I used about a can and a 1/3 of chicken stock. Easy to prep and worth the time.

Surprisingly delicious.  Simple ingredients made for a flavorful dish.  A few small changes I made - increase the broth by 1/2 cup.  Replaced peas with 1/2 cup cooked broccoli (daughter is allergic).  Reduced pimentos and olives by 1/2.

Absolutely delicious! I'm not a fan of olives so I omitted them, but all around excellent dish. I doubled the recipe and had left overs for lunch the next day. My family loved it!

I like this recipe but mine needed 2 cups of rice vs 1. Maybe it was because I used brown rice, but it was way too soupy and not enough rice with just one cup. I also added tumeric to give it a nice color and to enhance the flavor. All and all, delicious!

Years ago I went to a Hispanic festival and one of the booths had something similar to this. I tried before to mimic what I had that day but this recipe just took the cake. I changed a few things (rendered the chicken fat off the thighs and browned the chicken in that for increased flavor, seasoned the chicken before browning, and used a packaged saffron rice). I normally try a recipe exactly for the first time but I was looking for a base to cook around the package of rice I used and the chicken. This is a winner for sure. Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is amazing, I made it for my family tonight and didn't change anything. I followed the recipe and directions exactly and it turned out amazing. I didn't use a Dutch oven, however, I cooked everything in one large steel pan that also went in the oven. This was soooo good, I will definitely cook this again and add it to my repertoire.
