I thought these were pretty good.  I did add a TBL of sugar as other suggested, and did notice a slight aftertaste, though.  For those of you who had trouble with the thickness...keep this in mind... measuring flour for baking requires proper technique. If you scoop your measuring cup in the flour you will pack it in and get too much flour.  The proper way to measure flour is to spoon it into a dry measuring cup then tap the cup on the side so that the flour will gently settle.

this is my new favorite recipe!
two thumbs up for simplicity, versatility, and taste. for one thing, these pancakes (and *cough, cough* the batter) are just like the ones i had as a child.  i thought that ALL pancakes had sugar in them... no wonder i couldn't find any that tasted like "the good old days!"
i've always been a fan of baking powder;  you just can't beat that flavor and fluffiness.  the pancakes were super thick, and fantastic.  i don't like my pancakes thin and floppy... that's what crepes are for.
anyway... i got to thinking... "hey, i could do a lot with this recipe."  so since the first batch of pancakes, i've made a giant oven pancake/biscuit (just plopped it on a cookie sheet & put a few pats of butter on top) this was super tasty (& exceptionally easy), because of its crisp, clean exterior, and magically fluffy interior. but my favorite variation yet is the pancake super muffin!  i'd say A+ for presentation and variety!  i used 1.5c flour for this one, and the muffin tops looked amazing!  but you could probably still do it with the same old 1c recipe.  remember to put a pat of butter on top; this may be the key to teir lovely color.  oh, and i just always bake this stuff (muffins & biscuit) at 400 degrees for 10 minutes (my muffins needed about 12 though, remember to watch when you bake)
next idea... use as batter for frying??  (probably remove the oil from the recipe for that one)

Surley the submitted had intended for the baking powder to be 2 tsp - not 2 TBLS..which would be a ridiculous amt in almost ANY baked good. But - due to earlier suggestions, I added a TBLS sugar, a tsp of vanilla, and a dash of cinnamon. Great pancakes that were enjoyed by all. Thanks for this basic recipe!

The pancakes were very Good!!! I did decrease the baking powder as suggested I used 1 1/2 tablespoon and added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1 teaspoons sugar.  Excellent I will NEVER buy a boxed mix again.

These were good pancakes.  I must agree with those who recommend cutting the baking powder down a bit, I didn't because I don't like fooling with a recipe until I give it a shot first. Make sure your griddle is hot enough.  Mine wasn't at first and they did not fluff up nicely.  Got fluffier as the griddle got hotter.

These were great, fluffy pancakes! I substituted applesauce in place of oil- I always do in pancake recipes. I also added a little bit of vanilla to the milk mixture. This made exactly 10 pancakes using 1/4 c of batter for each. Thanks I'm definitely making these again!

Excellent pancakes! I am not really a pancake person, but my family loves them. I wanted to try something new, other than our usual Bisquick mix. These were just as easy and much, much better! I tried the suggestion to use 1T sugar, 1t vanilla, and cinnamon. The baking powder WAS 2 tablespoons, not teaspoons.

I've been making this recipe for a while and every time they turn out wonderful.  However, I found the exact recipe on the back of my baking powder can, minus the 1/4 cup sugar.  From reading the reviews, it sounds like some people prefer the sugar and some people don't miss it.

These are some of the fluffiest pancakes ever!  I added 2 tsp. of sugar and 1 tsp. of vanilla to the batter.  I might cut the baking powder down to 1 1/2 Tbsp. next time because I could taste it a bit, but other than that these were great!

I made these exactly as written (I love Clark Gable) as I wanted to see what happened with this much baking powder.  Could not stand the very strong baking powder taste and even spit it out! So I diluted the rest of the batter with another round of ingredients, but no more baking powder (so now double the recipe).  Result:  GREAT PANCAKES! And they were plenty fluffy.  Recommend half as much baking powder as recipes states, but see for yourself!  (also, you can use half soda and half powder to cut the baking pdr flavor even more).  (Perhaps an error got perpetuated in this recipe?)

I only used two tablespoons baking powder (I make A LOT of pancakes and have learned you don't want too much baking powder to overpower the taste of the pancakes) FOR A DOUBLE RECIPE and I used whole wheat flour instead of AP flour. Because I used whole wheat flour, I knew to increase the milk to a cup and a quarter, only because whole wheat flour likes to suck up liquid. I let the batter for this sit for about ten minutes before using. This recipe turned out well for me and the kids seemed to like it. Next time, I'd like to try this recipe with buttermilk and melted butter. I think that would make this pancake recipe out of this world.

These were good.  I really wanted pancakes this morning, but was out of mix.  I admit this was every bit as easy.  I added about a tablespoon of sugar, a dash of vanilla and about a cup of frozen blueberries.  The pancakes are a little thin, but very tender and tasty.

This is only the second time I've made pancakes and the first time trying this recipe--I've found my new standard!  I made some adjustments based on other reviews:  1 1/2 tbsp baking powder, 1/4 c sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract.  With these adjustments, there was no aftertaste and they were still fluffy, light, and delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Awesome pancakes.  I took the advice of others and added 1T of sugar I also substituted applesauce for the veg oil and used 2t of baking powder instead of 2T as recommended by a friend and these are great!  Store bought mix has so much sodium and sugar and Ive been searching with many trials and errors for a great pancake recipe and I believe this is it!

these pancakes were a little strange...they cooked to a crisp on the outside but were uncooked on the inside. once I got them mostly fully cooked, my husband still didn't love the texture. and good thing I didn't half the recipe-I only got 5 normal-sized pancakes out of the recipe! I can't imagine how small you'd have to make them to get 10 pancakes. the taste was pretty good, though-I used 1.5 Tbsp baking powder, used 1/4 cup whole wheat flour, and added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 Tbsp sugar, and some cinnamon.

I was out of mix, so I found this recipe...I had everything on hand, so I went for it.  My 12 year old daughter and I made them together.  They were beautiful..so light and fluffy.  My daughter took the first bite, said "Ewwww" and spit them out! She said they tasted like rubber bands.  I then tasted them and they were HORRIBLE.  Two tbs. of baking powder is why!  It made them so bitter.  Inedible.  My two year old son gobbled his up.  Go figure.

Finally!  A simple delicious pancake that's light and fluffy.  Yum!  I added 2 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla and I thought that was too much baking powder for so little batter, so I reduced that to 1 1/2 tsp and they came out perfect for me.  I read somewhere that the "baking powder taste" that everyone dislikes so much comes from the aluminum in baking powder.  Get the aluminum free and it helps with that bitter taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe.  I cut the baking powder just a tad, added 1 T sugar and 1/2 t vanilla.  So easy.  I will make bags of the dry mix and keep in the cupboard so I only have to add the wet ing.  Try adding a couple shakes of cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry and 1/2 ripe banana mashed to the wet.  These are some awesome banana pancakes.

Super easy, fast and tasty. My only negative comment would be the amount of baking powder. Although the author swears it's correct, I will cut it down next time - just a touch bitter IMO, but still really good overall. Servied with "smashed" sweetened strawberries and whipped cream - yum yum.

i used 1 1/2tbs because i was a bit scared of using 2tbs of baking powder lol. the most i've ever seen used was 4tsps. but these pancakes had a really nice "fluff" to them. If you like sweeter pancakes i'd suggest to add 1-2tbs of sugar. my bf prefers pancakes without so he really liked these and i've tried so many pancakes recipes on him. he's extremely picky when it comes to pancakes too. Maybe next time i'll be brave and try the 2tbs of baking powder.

Excellent!  Just what I was looking for.  I'd been using mixes, but they just didn't hit it.  I tried this out of curiosity and gave them to my wife this a.m.  She loved them and remarked how much more "fluffy" they were than the standard box mix!

I thought I used the ingredient list as written, with added cinnamon, vanilla, and a touch of nutmeg, but now after we have eaten them and my husband really enjoyed them, I realize I didnt add the vegetable oil.  I also omitted the salt on purpose, not sure what it's role is, but I try not to use much salt when I cook.  So I am not sure what the veg. oil does, but these were very good without it.  Just the right amount of fluff for us.  Sometimes pancakes get so fluffy that it is hard for them to cook.  These were perfect.  I used a 1/3 cup to measure out ingredients, so I used that to pour out the pancakes also and I got about 8 4inch pancakes.  I was drawn to this recipe by the name.  I enjoy reading the reviews but I also would enjoy to learn more about the origination of the recipe and why so named.  Maybe Clark Gable accidentally added 2TBL of baking powder and decided to keep it?  Anyways, thank you for sharing.  DH really enjoyed them this morning.

These were light and fluffy but a little flavorless.  I'll add some sugar and vanilla next time.

I don't understand what's so great about these pancakes. It makes me wonder if I really was spoiled as a child, eating good homemade pancakes. I added raspberries to the batter, which wasn't such a good choice for pancakes that are not very sweet to begin with. Then I added sugar to the batter, and they were a little better, but not much. Yes, they are light and fluffy, but the flavor is NOT GOOD.

This recipe needs to REDUCE the amount of baking powder. Try using just 2 teaspoons of it instead. Otherwise, it's wonderful!

These are fairly nice. I don't eat pancakes all that often, and I'm not much of a judge of them, but I found this recipe as I was looking to use up some baking powder. It certainly is easy to make, and I like "from scratch" better than buying boxed mixes, so I've already made this a couple of times, exactly as written. I don't know what would make a fantastic pancake, but I'll give this recipe a 4-star "Liked It" rating.

This is my go to recipe, just how it is.  It's nice and easy to make and reliable standard.  These pancakes also make a good base for adding to as well.  Favorites include pie spice, bananas, chocolate chips, or apples.

Hands down the best pancake I have ever had, I misread the recipe and only put in 2 teaspoon of baking powder and they hold up well to making sausage pancake sandwiches for those mornings everyone is on the run.

What an easy delicious recipe, I've been making these for two years now and they never, ever fail.  Best homemade pancakes out there and it takes no longer than a mix. I do not add the salt as the bp makes it plenty salty, Also you may want to avoid aluminum baking powder if you're sensitive to taste.

Needed a pancake recipe that didn't require baking soda...loved this!!  I took reviewer advice and cut baking powder to 1.5 TBS, added 1 TBS sugar and loads of cinnamon.  Pancakes were the lightest, fluffiest I have ever had.  Added fresh blueberries to some and mini chocolate chips to others, all were great!  Definitely my new recipe of choice for pancakes.

I use this recipe all the time as my go-to pancake recipe! However, I always add about 3 tsp of sugar and 2 tsp of cinnamon. It gives it that little extra something it needs and the family loves them! I also like the fact that you can easily turn these into fruity pancakes by just adding a cup of blueberries, strawberries, etc.

Excellent, fluffy pancakes. I stirred this up with a fork and thhe batter is so smooth, it's almost like cream. As a result the pancakes have no flour lumps. They are really terrific if cooked in bacon grease (but then again isn't everything?!?!) Seems to keep well in the fridge for a few days for quick pour pancakes!

Loved these pancakes! They are so fluffy and yummy! Also, they were very easy to make :) BTW- the 2 TBS of baking powder was the right amount, that's what made the batter so fluffy!

Made these for the kids and they loved them. I turned around to clean up the counter and the kids finished them up before I could get even one! Easy to make and everyone was happy. Well maybe not the cook because I did get even one:)

Try this recipe AS IT IS written... it is the best. I served these at other's houses and in each family it is now their pancake recipe.  Truly.  I call them on weekends and they say they are having my Clark Gables!  If you haven't ever put in 2 TBL of baking powder then you don't know that is works very well. I tried the sugar/vanilla idea and it ruined the result.  I am a pancake connoisseur...

was out of bisquick pancake mix, but the fiancee wanted pancakes for breakfast. Jumped on here, found this recipe, liked how it was simple (despite my shock at how much baking powder) and came to find that these pancakes are even better than the bisquick mix. the only thing i changed was i added about 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract to help give it a little extra flavor. also, had to double the recipe, only because my fiancee and i LOVE pancakes. so thank you Clark Gable Pancakes! you've helped satisfy our cravings for pancakes on a day when we weren't sure if we could have any.

These were good. My picky eaters ate them all. There were no rave reviews, but no complaints either. I scaled this to 15 servings, which called for 1 1/2 eggs, so I only used 1 egg. I also used 2 tbps. baking powder and added 1 tsp. vanilla extract. Will probably fix this again. Thanks

There's something about the way these pancakes made my mouth feel after eating them. Dried out. Maybe it was the 2 T baking pwd. They tasted good going down, but I won't make them again.

Delectable.  I add a bit of sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and a dollop of sour cream.  The texture of these pancakes can't be beat--crispy on the surface, light and fluffy and thick!  Thank you!

These taste fantastic if you use old-fashioned baking powder. You can make your own if you mix two parts cream of tartar, one part baking soda, and one part cornstarch.

Yep, baking powder is correct, and the recipe is good as is but...Next time I think I will try changing the butter for the oil and adding about 1-2 tbls of sugar. Otherwise they fluff up properly adn taste good. Plus all I am really looking for is a good vehicle for the syrup!

I love this recipe.  It's simple and delicious.  The pancakes turned out really fluffy.  Someone suggested adding a bit of vanilla extract and cinnonmon to it and that makes it even better.

I really like these pancakes, I added a little bit more milk, because the batter seemed really thick. I also added some cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla for a little flavor.

fell apart when trying to turn them,
(first time making this recipe, however)

suspect excessive baking soda caused this. 
I will try them again another time

Great recipe.. but it does need some minor adjustments.. only 1tbsp of baking powder, 1tbsp of vanilla extract, and a little more milk to loosen the batter.. and you get perfect pancakes..

What a great base receipe! I love to cook and experiment with different flavors.  With this receipe, I used 1/2 cup of skim milk and 1/2 cup of canned milk and I added some blueberries into  the mix.  The pancakes were so good.  Thanks for sharing....Karen I give it 5 stars

This has been my staple recipe for pancakes!  I love this recipe - it is simple and I can add to it as much as I like and it still makes great pancakes.  I've added strawberries, bananas, applesauce...and everytime they have been phenomenal.  This morning, we're doing bananas and blueberries and I don't change a thing about the recipe.  Thank you Betty!

These are some of the absolute best from-scratch pancakes I've ever made. I've tried buttermilk recipes, and these are actually more tender & fluffier. Didn't notice an aftertaste from the 2 tbsp. baking powder at all. I did add a little vanilla extract & a tbsp sugar, plus a dash of nutmeg. Those were the only changes I made, other than mixing the flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and nutmeg together before adding the milk and egg mixture to the flour mixture...as with anything, the less you mix the more tender the result.

we have been making this recipe for years!!  we absolutely love it.  i always use melted butter instead of the oil to make the pancakes even fluffier and butter in the pan to make the surface crispy.  and i always double the recipe or my family would eat it all up and there wouldn't be any left for me!

Yummy! I was a little skeptical, but these were great. I tripled the recipe,used whole wheat flour, added about 3/4 cup of milk, and used half applesauce half oil. We have a family of five and there were only a few leftover. My husband said these were the best pancakes ever! A trick I learned when making lots of pancakes is to break out your wire cooling racks and put the pancakes on those so they don't get soggy, works like a charm.

These were wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly and there was a bit too much bite from the baking powder than I like in my pancakes - Next time I'll try 1 1/2 tablespoons, but my husband enjoyed them as is. 

They were picture perfect and light and fluffy.

I made this recipe, using the 2 Tbsp. of baking powder. I can not understand how anyone could find them edible that way. I made the recipe again a few weeks later using only one Tbsp. of baking powder, and they were much better. If you try it with the full 2 Tbsp., beware. (I am giving one star for the recipe as written. Using only one Tbsp. would get a 4 star from me, since they were a little too  runny for my taste.)

I thought these pancakes were awesome! I grew up with pancakes from scratch. My dad always made them, but he didn't really go by any recipe. He's old school, measures with his hands and has no real use for written recipes...so, I came here to find a recipe. This one was it! I never had fluffier pancakes. :) Unfortunately, my husband's still a die hard fan of pancake mix from a box, but I figure it's his loss. This recipe's a keeper.

I make this recipe allll the time and never have time to comment!! Some mornings we add 1 chopped apple and a dash of cinnamon and sugar or like this morning a half cup of chocolate chips! A big ole' mashed banana is my mothers favorite added into the mix, but I prefer the mornings where we add a cup of blueberries or strawberries for htat early morning brain boost! So simple to make and so many variations I have made- I give this five stars as I NEVER buy pre-made pancake mix EVER after finding this awesome recipe that my ENTIRE family LOVES!!!

I maded these exactly as stated in the recipe and they came out great.  Much better than my ususal Aunt Jemima Mix.  This is now a weekend ususal. I think some people are mistaking baking soda for baking powder since there are referrals to salty and base pH problems.  Don't use baking soda.

I've had this recipe for so long and have been making these again and again but I always forgot to leave a comment. My family just love these pancakes. They are just so easy to make. These babies will turn out thick but fluffy.

I've been using this recipe for years. It's the most delicious pancakes I've ever eaten. 

I add 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and sometimes I leave out the sugar depending on what I feel like. I also fry them up in butter or margarine. They always come out tender and yummy!

Blueberry pancakes:
If you try the recipe exactly adding the lemon juice, a dash of vanilla, cinnamon AND a cup of fresh blueberries, they are out of this world.

You can also add chocolate chips to them. Add a dash of cinnamon and vanilla.

The baking powder amount is CORRECT! It affects the taste and texture a bit when you use less, I've tried it.

I quadrupled the recipe since I have a large family - and it was more than plenty! The only thing I did differently wsa to add lemon to the milk for a homemade version of buttermilk pancakes. My batter was so thick I had to add extra milk or I would have had biscuits! I eat my pancakes with butter only and they were definitely less sweet without the sugar added, but that was just fine with me. These were a hit at my house and for the slumber party girls from last night. Thanks Betty - I didn't find my Mom's recipe like I was looking for - but this will now be our main pancake recipe!

Because half of the reviewers seemed to like the recipe as-is while half seemed to call for a reduction in the baking powder, I decided to be optimistic and try the recipe as-is.  But---the baking powder definitely needs to be reduced.  I tried one of the pancakes plain and all I could taste was the baking powder; however, I added syrup and that helped to mask a lot of the taste.  I think that this is a good recipe, but it just needs to be tweaked a bit.

This was one of my first recipes to try on this site, I think the bite of baking pwdr takes a little getting used to! Also, use a very sweet syrup to off-set the baking pdwr taste (I used Smucker's Strawberry in the pic). BTW, does anyone know why they are named after Clark Gable? Just curious. (:

I originally gave these pancakes 5/5 - they are light, not eggy, and very easy to make. However, I find the baking powder a bit overwhelming. It leaves a nasty aftertaste and makes my mouth feel very dry/weird.

These were really good and easy. I followed other suggestions and reduced the baking powder to 1 tbsp, added 1 tsp vanilla and 3 pkgs Splenda. I mixed all the dry ingred, mixed the wet ingred, then when griddle was hot, whisked them together just to mix. They puffed up nice and fluffy and my 11 year old grandaughter said they were GREAT -- coming from her, that's a huge compliment!! Thanks

These are very basic pancakes so I added a few more things to spruce them up.  I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tablespoon sugar.  They were very easy to make.  But our favorate recipe still is Good old fashioned pancakes also from this site.

OK, these pancakes were GREAT, but here is the deal:  I made some modifications.  (SOME is actually an understatement!)  Here is the recipe I used:  1 1/4 c. flour, 1 Tb. baking powder, 1/4 ts. salt, 1 egg (beaten), 1 c. milk, 2 Tb. veg oil, 1 1/2 c. shredded apple, 1 ts. cinnamon, 1 ts. vanilla, and 2 Tb. brown sugar.  Unlike other results, these pancakes were great!  The batter was a little runny, but I liked it better that way because the pancakes weren't too fluffy and floury tasting.  Hope this helps...enjoy!

The cakes were very easy to make, came out nice and fluffy. 1 problem though, they lack flavor, anyone who does not use a lot of syrup will not enjoy them.... I suggest adding a tablespoon of sugar, teaspoon of vanilla, using less baking powder.

Good quick recipe
I replaced the 2 tbsp. of oil with 2 and a half of melted butter, and I think next time I will use a little less baking powder, but not much less.

These were really good.  I did add extra milk to thin the batter.  I modified them by using chocolate milk and added chocolate chips.  My kids really liked them!  I liked that they were light and fluffy and not a dense pancake.

I made this recipe for my family on Sunday and didn't like them at all. Very bad aftertaste. I think it has too much baking powder.  Even after putting the sugar, still was awful.

I hate to say this but the pancakes left a bad after taste.  My kids wouldn't touch them with a ten foot pole.  I thought I could disguise the flavor by drowning them in syrup but it failed.  Only after reducing the amount of baking powder and adding sugar we were able to consume them and they were quite good but the original recipe has got to go.  Besides the taste they were really easy to prepare and I will continue to make them my way.

This had a weird reaction when I added the baking powder, the bowl overflowed with the batter! These were a little dry I had to keep adding milk to thin the batter.

I was looking for quick, tasty, and easy, and that's what this is. They are fluffy when thick and chewy when thin (more or less milk, that is). Delicious. Thanks Clark Gable!

A lot of people are saying that they get a bitter aftertaste with all the baking powder. All I can say is that I've made this recipe plenty of times and a couple of times I did get a bitter aftertaste but it's because I didn't follow the recipe to the letter, exactly that much baking powder and that much salt. Also make sure your baking powder is fresh (if it's not they are going to taste horrible).  After mixing the batter let it rest for a few minutes for a thicker pancake. I've also recently stopped eating eggs and the recipe works well without them.

The pancakes were light, fluffy, and delicious.  I added some sugar and cinnamon to the recipe.  To reduce the fat content, I substituted French vanilla yogurt for the oil.

Super easy to make and delicious!  No more box mixes for me. Substituted melted Crisco for the vegetable oil and it worked fine (out of oil).  These are fluffy thick pancakes and are absolutely delicious.  I have this recipe memorized!

This is a really really good base recipe.  Awesome as is and the ingredient list is correct as listed.  To make even better, add at least 1 tsp vanilla.  I also added 1 tbsp sugar.  Awesome!

Very quick and easy to make. I love the way they fluff up, and my kids gobbled them right up. However, I agree with some others that the baking powder makes a bitter aftertaste. Next time I will decrease the baking powder, add some vanilla, and maybe try some fruit like banana or blueberry. Overall, a great simple recipe for a quick breakfast!

Ahhh, I'm a novice so I follow instructions step by step, word by word. It only occurred to me when trying the first pancake: The baking powder should not be 2 tablespoons, but two teaspoons! What a waste, inedible.

Really good recipe!!  I love size the batch makes, perfect for a smaller morning, double it for when there are more than 3-4 children.  Tastes really great without adding any sugar or vanilla.  (they don't hurt, just don't want the extra sugar, there is enough in the syrup :)  My new all purpose recipe.  REALLY TERRRIFIC!!

This is a perfect, easy pancake recipe. It's fast, they're completely fluffy, and they melt in your mouth! Thanks for such a simple recipe. Please note that the amount of baking powder is correct. There was no bitterness due to the amount suggested, so I say go for it- these pancakes fluffed up like none I'd ever seen!

These were great! The whole family loved them. Please do not listen to the other reviewers. The amount of baking powder IS CORRECT. It is what makes these pancakes so fluffy and tasty. All I want to know is why are they Clark Gable Pancakes?...

Delicious, fluffy pancakes!I doubled the flour and milk, added 2 heaping tablespoons sugar and some vanilla and followed the recipe exactly besides that, including the 2 Tablespoons of baking powder. This is going to be my new pancake recipe, thank you!

Good basic recipe-I loved how they were light and had crisp edges. On the downside, I thought they lacked flavor. I will make them again, but substitute melted butter for the oil, and maybe add cinnamon.

We have been trying different pancake recipes every weekend and these ones are really good! They are nice and light. I used a smidge less baking powder but stuck pretty close to the exact recipe. The recipe makes enough for 4 people but no leftovers, so if you want to have some to heat up the next day for the kids breakfast then you might want to double the recipe. Yum!

These were so good.  I was out of milk so I used half a cup of cream and half a cup of water and they still turned out beautifully.  I used the 2 TBS of baking powder and they rose up to 2 inches while on the griddle.  The outside was crunchy and the inside was bready.  No need to buy mix from the store.  These are delicious, easy and fast.

Two Tablespoons is exactly right!  Those of you who have aftertaste may need to try Aluminum Free Baking Powder....  the aluminum is bad for you anyway.   These pancakes were great!  I walked away from the batter for a couple of minutes and when I came back the batter had doubled!  Light, fluffy, delicious pancakes.  They were thick enough that they weren't perfect circles, but that is just fine by me.

I'm not a pancake connoisseur, but these were good.  They puffed up very thick.  The only change I made was to use 1/3 whole wheat flour.  When I tasted the pancake plain, it was a little salty and strange not to have any sweetness, but there's not really any point to adding sugar if you're going to cover it in syrup anyways!

Very good recipe.  I made them exactly as written and now I'm going to try some of the other reviewer suggestions, except for vanilla which I believe makes pancakes taste too much like "cake". I'm gald to have found a good from-scratch recipe.

These turned out very light and fluffy!  I usually make pancakes in a dry nonstick pan, but I did these in a lightly oiled cast iron skillet and they came out with very light crispy outside layer.  The texture reminded me of buttermilk pancakes I've had at Cracker Barrel.  I wouldn't eat them plain, but they taste very good when they soak up some syrup.

This is a great recipe!  It really does have the traditional taste I was looking for.  I also loved how quick and easy it was to make.  The only thing I would do is cut back on the baking powder.  I didn't like the after-taste of baking powder in my mouth.  Thanks for posting!

This is the only pancake recipe I've used for the past 5 years.  I do add 1 Tbsp of sugar and 1 Tsp vanilla though ;)  

It's also easy to to vary this recipe - I've used equal parts white, wheat, and soy flour, sprinkled in wheat germ, flax seed meal, added mashed bananas, applesauce....fun to play around with this one and good as written!

I did a little experimentation with this recipe. I poured too much batter in for the first one because I am used to making thick pancakes. I devided the batter into fourths and added something different for each one. I left the first division alone and cooked it according to directions. They turned out a lot better than you would think. I really liked them! The 2nd quarter I added some sugar (powdered and white) as well as some vanilla. They turned out pretty good. Sweeter than the other (obviously) but I liked the 1st batch better because the contrast between the pancakes and the syrup was amazing. For the 3rd batch, I added some peach yogurt. They were good. The yogurt was very subtle but gave them a wonderful aftertaste! I added oats, brown sugar, and pecans for the last one. They did not taste bad but were not very pretty. The batter is too thin to be able to handle these ingredients which results in it not being very aesthetically pleasing. 


So...great recipe...with or without additions!!!!

I made these pancakes a couple of weeks ago, and plan on making them again today for lunch. They are the best pancakes ever. Light and fluffy. A breeze to mix together and they cook quickly. If you are expecting these pancakes to taste like BisQuick pancakes, they don't. They've got that wonderful baking powder bite and aren't sweet at all. Love 'em!!

Thick and bland, wonderful.  I love that they aren't sweet, and they're just right for tearing and dipping into syrup.  

I substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil, but I don't think it really made a difference in the taste.

I suppose the butter added may help, but the recipe makes basic (as in pH-basic) pancakes that make my stomach slightly unsettled. Lots of butter and jam on top just wouldn't cut it, though they helped a bit. I am looking for an excellent pancake recipe made at my house before. THIS wasn't anything like it!

Awesome! These were so light and fluffy! I added a couple Tablespoons of sugar and I cut back on the Baking Powder to a little over a Tablespoon. I also used butter instead of oil. My husband is very picky about his pancakes and he loved them! This is a keeper, better than my favorite boxed mix!!

Made these exactly to specification and they tasted very cakey to me.  Maybe more eggs?  Also, maybe substitute butter for the oil to give more flavor?  Probably won't make again - sorry.

These were the flimsiest pancakes I ever made.  My batter was so thin!!!  Would've made great crepes.  I added a little vanilla, and a about 3 tbs of sugar to my batter(really don't think the additions caused the batter to be thin) to sweeten them up a bit.  Overall they tasted fine, but not the fluffy kind of pancakes I enjoy.  I won't be making these again.  Sorry. :(

This was my first time making pancakes from scratch.  They turned out wonderful!  Thanks.  I did add a bit of sugar to the mix to give a little bit of sweetness.  I will never go back to pancake mixes again.

We love this recipe.  I don't add sugar or cinnamon like some readers suggest, but I do add fruit - bananas, blueberries, peaches, anything.
I add the fruit to the pancake after I have poured the batter on the griddle instead of stirring it into the batter.  We don't feed leftovers to our dog, although she would probably like it if we did.  We freeze them and enjoy them as microwave pancakes as a quick breakfast on a school morning.

A premix could'nt be easier!  I have made homemade pancakes before but it was such an arduous process that it hardly seemed worth it. Slapped this together in no time.  Easy to remember, too! The next time I get a hankering for flapjacks this will be the recipe I use.  My husband said they tasted better than the premix!  He was off to work the Saturday I made these and only had time for a couple. Sunday, he insisted that I do it again!  The whole family was happy (including MOM who was not haggard and worn out from the cooking process)  Isn't that what cooking should be about, afterall? Thanks, Betty!  A follow up:  I believe it was in the early 2000's when I first had the good fortune of finding this little gem and could not count the times I have made them since-- always with excellent results-- barring the one occasion that I did not check the expiration on the baking powder. So that cooking fail is all on me. Love this still.

My husband and I tried this pancake recipe tonight for dinner, and they turned out beautifully! They were light, fluffy and extra tasty with the addition of a bit of sugar and cinnamon. They were everything an easy-to-make pancake should be. Mmmm Mmmm!

These weren't that great.  I added 1 T. sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla and only used 2 tsp. baking soda, but they were just ok.  I made them for just me, I ate a stack of 3 and fed the rest to the dog.  He loved them, but he's been known to eat some pretty funky things.  They weren't terrible, but I won't make again

For me, the recipe as written produced pancakes that were very pretty and fluffy, but virtually tasteless. I reduced the amount of baking powder and, per other reviews, added healthy amounts of vanilla and cinnamon, and we were able to enjoy these somewhat.

This has got to be the best and easiest recipe you could possibly find.  When I make these pancakes, I have to triple the recipe.  The grandkids are absolutely crazy about this great find. Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!

I loved these pancakes so much I will use it now, instead of a store bought mix.  They were very light tasting, not heavy like some pancakes are.  I wouldn't change anything about them.  I don't understand how anybody could have given this any less than a 5 star rating.

I didn't like these nearly as much as the other pancake recipe that I usually make, but my son and mother loved them. I guess it's just a matter of taste. They're easier than the others, and I was in a pinch for time. I added a teaspoon of vanilla to them and also some chopped pecans. Next time I may try adding a little bit of sugar, and I think I may of over stirred the batter. My mother wanted me to rate them a five, but due to my pickiness, I rated them a three.

My kids loved these pancakes. I however thought they could have had a little more flavor. The next time I make them I'm going to try less baking powder, and maybe even some homemade applesauce.

My husband stumbled upon this recipe and we find it to be the best pancakes ever.  We also substituted butter for the oil.  Our son loves them. They are fantastic!

Great big, fluffy pancakes.  Really great!  Could use a bit of sugar to make them a tad sweeter.

This is the worst recipe for pancakes I have ever used.  No sugar?  TWO tablespoons of baking powder?  They wouldn't stay together!!  And I hate to say it, but they tasted horrible.

This recipe is great with a lot of syrup but if you add a little cinnamon to the batter it's even better.

This recipe was great. My kids loved watching it rise.  I also liked that I could double it without harming the out come of the pancake.  The pancake was light and fluffy.

Not so good. I'm pretty sure that should be 2 *teaspoons* of baking powder, not 2 *tablespoons*.
