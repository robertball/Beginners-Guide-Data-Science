I made this because one of the reviewers was from massachusetts and said it was just how she remembered them. I'm from massachusetts, lived in 2 different towns 2 cities and these are not how I remembered them at all. These were not as flavorful/spice-filled as I remembered also the the texture was off and hermits were bars not cookies. These were ok, but they weren't hermits to me.

Thanks, Dawn.  Just baked the cookies and they are just what I was looking for as part of a gift for my son-in-law. I had a recipe for Hermits years ago but was unable to find it.  I am very pleased with the results that I got with these cookies.

I made these for a school project. I thought these were really good, but I had to cook them for a minute or two longer than the recipe said, or else they were undercooked.

just baked these cookies and they came out pretty good. The only thing I would change if I made them again i the amount of raisins. There just didnt seem to be enough, but other than that they were very good!

This may be the best batch of Hermit cookies I have ever made, and I have made several different recipes.  
 I did change a couple of things.  I didnâ€™t have allspice so I used 2tsp of apple pie spice instead of the listed spices and I added a handful of chopped dates, and a hand full of sweetened coconut, Just because I had them on hand.

The first time I ever heard of Hermit Cookies was in Grade 7 Home Economics. Everyone loved them, especially my mom. I didn't change a thing in this recipe - these cookies turned out perfect, just as old-fashioned and wholesome tasting as I remember. Thank you, Dawn, for posting this recipe and sending me down memory lane, in a delicious way!
