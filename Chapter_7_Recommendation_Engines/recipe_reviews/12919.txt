My whole family loves this soup.
It's great if your on a diet with the low fat and low calore content it's perfect.
It tastes rich and smooth.

I made as directed and felt it had no flavor. I then added saute chopped onion, celery & mushrooms. It was better, but not great. I will keep serching for an Asparagus soup recipe, this is not the one.

This soup is delicious and very easy to make! However, next time I would mash the potatoes by hand rather than puree them in the blender. That was the only difficulty I encountered. 
This is wonderful with homemade crusty french bread!

I thought it was pretty good but the asparagus I bought was out
of season. I wanted fresh asparagus instead of canned.  To make it taste more like the sweeter more tender asparagus I added a few tablespoons of honey, & it seemed to do it for me.  I also tried leaving out the potatoes -- I like a more condensed asparagus flavor.  I also added a handful of fresh mint leaves (shredded) with the asparagus in the broth to
be cooked & blended.  This gave it a very cool, lite flavor.
This soup tastes great chilled --especially a day later when
made like this.

Tasty soup! I adapted this slightly to use up some leftovers in my fridge. We had a dinner party for my daughter, and I had roasted some asparagus in the oven. Opened the oven the next day, and realized that we never served it! Ugh! I also had some seasoned mashed potatoes left from her party, so I used those up as well. I cut back the fennel seed to about 1 tsp, and skipped the fronds (because I didn't have any). Pureed with my immersion blender and garnished with a bit of sour cream and parsley. Yum!
