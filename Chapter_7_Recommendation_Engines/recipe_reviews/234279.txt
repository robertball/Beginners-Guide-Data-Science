This tasted good on grilled pork chops. I put olive oil on the pork chops, sprinkled the rub on both sides  and let them sit for about 15-20 minutes. I made some without the red pepper for my kids and then added the red pepper in for the rest.

I used it on chicken thighs let the rub sit on the chicken while my oven preheated it was so good especially with the nice crispy skin!

Tasty enough, but very basic.  Didn't quite hit all the notes I was looking for in a spice rub

Easy, tasty, big hit with the family.  I grilled the chicken breasts and some peppers and put it all on salad greens.  Should have added more peppers. I cut back on the crushed pepper for the kids but otherwise no chnages.

I did the recipe as is, with a little less crushed red pepper and it is exquisite on grilled chicken breast. Yum. Yum. Yum.
