I live in Europe (have for 15 years) in a country next door to Italy where they use mascarpone cheese and phyllo dough all the time.  Maybe I can help everyone with the leakages problem.  I have never seen anyone try and make separate triangles or squares with phyllo dough.  It is always used in a pan and then cut later.  Even though I haven't tried this recipe yet, when I do, I will layer the bottom of a pan (15x11" or 9x13") with 3-4 sheets of phyllo (brushing the butter in between each layer).  Then spread the filling over the layers and finishing with 3-4 more sheets of phyllo brushing the butter on the top, as well.  The baking time will probably vary.  Once it's baked, let it cool completely then cut in squares or, as they like to do here, cut diagonally to the right and then the left making diamond shapes.  Hopefully, this will work.  If anyone tries this before I do, let me know how it works.  Hope this help!
I finally tried this recipe and made it the way I suggested above (keeping the filling exactly as written).  It turned out just fine as far as the consistency and everything holding together.  But next time I will NOT add honey, but will, instead, add brown sugar and cinnamon.  One other thing, make sure you beat the mascarpone REALLY well so that it's nice and fluffy.  That will make the consistency much better.

Despite reading all the reviews and ensuring that the mascarpone filling I made was a very thick paste, the filling spilt out everywhere within the first 10 minutes of cooking.  I think the oven temperature is too high as well as after 15 minutes my pastry was almost at a burnt stage.  I threw everything out which was a very costly exercise, given the price of mascarpone.  I won't be trying this out again, I'm afraid.

This was great!!  Next time, I'd serve the phyllo dough with some of the mascarpone-chocolate mix and some mascarpone with a little sugar and vanilla mixed in as a little break from the delicious, rich "chocolatey-ness" of the recipe.  Mine weren't bitter at all and they didn't leak very much.   Yummm!!!
The trick is to make the chocolate mix pretty thick, like a paste.  Then it really shouldn't leak too badly.  If you need to add more sweetening, add confectioner's sugar and you should be all set!  Serve with a drizzle of dark chocolate syrup and powdered sugar.  :)

I love these triangles! Phyllo dough is easy and fun to work with, and this recipe is delightfully lite and not too sweet. Thanks, Mary!

KEY to avoiding leaking-- cut your phyllo into strips and wrap around a spoon of filling in a triangle shape just like folding a flag-- then you will have many more layers of phyllo to contain the filling, and not so much of a seam.  (I wonder if the author intended this? but not very clear from the instructions..)

I halved the recipe because I've never worked with phyllo.  They were a complete mess (mostly my fault), but SO good!  I added a tablespoon of sugar and increased the vanilla because of reviews of bitterness.  Definitely decrease the amount of filling in each triangle, or you'll be cleaning the bottom of your oven just like me!

Next time, I'll try the mascarpone substitute on this site because the real thing is hard to find and VERY expensive where I live.

I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings & I added a couple of tbp of sugar to the filling. (it was a bit bitter before & I didn't want to add more honey for fear of making the filling runny). Like Princess Antz, most of the filling leaked out while baking (I baked @ 375 for 20 minutes & they were a perfect golden brown). Although there was enough left to be able to enjoy the dessert still....hence the 4 stars. (It would have gotten five if the filling was sweeter & most of the filling hadn't been lost). Next time I think I will try not putting so much filling in but I don't think there is anyway to seal phyllo dough so I'm thinking this recipe might be better suited in phyllo cups. The taste was excellent...there is just some issues w/ the logistics of the recipe. I drizzled each w/ a little honey & garnished w/ chocolate curls. Thansk Mary Bayramian...despite the problems w/ the recipe, it was delicious!

Made this into a layered dish after reading reviews about oozing, and while the filling was amazing, the phyllo was overtaken by it. Next time I will keep the phyllo all on top and bottom , without doing layers. The filling tasted like really good chocolate croissant filling. Yum yum!

Phyllo is very delicate. When making your triangles only use 1 tblespoon of mixture. then take some eggwash toseal the edges before baking. Also instead of cocoa use semi sweet baking chocolate. This will give it better flavor.

This was one of the best-tasting dessert disasters I have ever made! I used puff pastry instead of philo dough, and I replaced the pecans with almonds. The puff pastry did not hold together and the filling ended up all over the cookie sheet and some burning on the bottom of my oven. Once it cooled, we scraped the filling up and put it on top of the pastry. Mmmm mmmm good.

I have made this several times now b/c I love it, BUT I cannot keep the filling from seeping out no matter what I try (less filling, wrap it extra, bake all up against each other). Will keep trying, but that's why it's not a 5.

This was terrible. The filling wasn't sweet enough. It was actually a little bitter.  Also the filling completely oozed out of the pastry onto my baking tray which made a huge mess. Won't be trying again.

Wow! What a treat here! I made this using pastry shells instead of stuffing the triangles to serve at a get together. This way was easier to serve to a crowd and less messy. I just popped them in a warm oven and let them heat up and get gooey. One-third of the original recipe filled 10 pastry shells each approx. 2 inches in diameter and 1.5 inches high. Creamy and delicious. Thank you Mary Bayramian for your recipe.

Don't know if I should even rate this recipe, as I changed so many things.  Used cream cheese instead of mascarpone, brown sugar instead of honey, coconut instead of nuts and only 1 heaping teaspoon instead of what the recipe called for.  With this mix, I had almost no leakage and I did love the flavor of this.  Lovely, light and tasty!!

Delicious!  I folded in triangles like folding a flag - no issues with filling leaking.

What a mess! I followed the directions exactly, and still had all my filling leak out all over my cookie sheet! The taste was good, but the triangles were not a good idea. If I try this again I think I will make the phyllo into little cups (cupcake tin).

eh. after making this i realized i only like savory phyllo dough recipes. i made the recipe to specs, then in a few i added some cherry pie filling (omitting the honey in the chocolate filling). the cherry pie ones were actually better. i personally don't like working with phyllo dough, so maybe that's another reason i didn't like this recipe. the best thing i've made with phyllo dough is stromboli, and that's the only thing i'll ever make with phyllo dough!

as good as mascarpone, chocolate, nuts and phyllo pastry can be.
i use less ingrendients, i use best choc spread mixed with mascarpone and walnuts and wrap it in the phyllo pastry. not sure how  to make a triangle so i just fold it in  square, and still leaking. im ight have to use more phyllo to avoid leaking...maybe, dunno.
