I am 15 years old and this was my first time making cheesecake and it turned out excellent.  I served it to my neighbours, family and friends and it was a hit.  No one could tell that it was light cheesecake either, which made it even better.  I presented the cheesecake with drizzels of cherry topping and it looked amazing.  One more detail is that I used a 10inch springform pan for this recipe, and in order to get away with this, is to double the crust recipe :).  Also to make the cheesecake have a "kick" to it I added the rind of a lemon (grated) with the flour. I recommend this recipe because it was easy to make and it turned out great!!!!!

Each time I have served this, I have gotten rave reviews, especially when I say it came from Cooking Light. It is so light and delicate for a cheesecake. Everyone doesn't like a regular dense cheesecake, This one is great.

This was so incredible, I can't believe it's light!  You MUST make it 1 day ahead; the texture is so much better.  I topped it with strawberries and MMMMM!  I'm going to make it for Easter.

This is an amazing recipe. At 1200 calories a slice, I usually don't let myself enjoy cheesecake, so this recipe is a godsend. It is light and fluffy, which I find is a nice break from regular "New York" style cheesecake - you can actully eat a whole slice (and just try to stop there). I served it for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.

This is a great low-fat cheesecake!  If you crave a cheesecake but don't want all the fat, you must give this one a try!  I made it twice and just love it!

This is the BEST cheesecake ever!!  I loved the fluffy texture and tender crust.  I had to make more of the crust mix to cover the pan, though.  I was going to take it to work, but I ended up keeping it in the fridge and eating it at home.

Great taste! This will be my new recipe for cheesecake. It was light but it still had lots of flavor.
My family loved it!

Too good to be low fat!!  I don't care for cherries so I left the filling part off, and it was still great!! I also added a dash of cinnamon. I will be using this recipe for every cheesecake I make!!

This is a good recipe.  If you're in a hurry and don't mind the extra calories, it provides enough filling for two pies -- just omit the graham crust and springform pan and use pre-made graham crusts purchased at the store.

Have many diabetic/dieting co-workers myself included and so the values being so much lower on this was great! There was NO sacrifice in flavor or texture. Correct that making 1 day ahead of time is better. Everyone was able to enjoy it and was in love with the recipe. Highly recommend for all occassions. Next time will try with other pie filling and fruits on top. Bon Appetite!

This was one of the best cheesecakes I have ever eaten! We made this for dessert for Easter dinner and everyone has been talking about it ever since! We had to double the recipe to make the graham crust, but everything else worked out great! A must make again recipe!

This was an excellent recipe!  My dad (who never likes alternative, lowfat recipes) LOVED it. It tasted exactly the same as normal cheesecake- but didn't leave you with that really full feeling.  Endulge in this treat! This is now my favorite sweet delight!

Very good light version of the original. I had some trouble knowing when it was set, but I believe a little adjusting on the baking time will cure that.

This cheesecake was perfect! I did not use cooking spray or graham cracker crumbs or margarine.   For the crust, I made a sponge cake crust (found in cookbook by Junior's NYC), to avoid partially hydrogenated oil and food dyes.  I used butter vs. margarine and cooking spray.  I had to bake it 20+ minutes longer but I also put it in a water bath (Junior's suggestion).  I covered the springform pan with foil to prevent water seeping in and placed the cheesecake in the springform pan in a jelly roll pan and filled with water.  Texture was rich, taste was superb, no cracking on top and guests loved it.  I missed the graham cracker crust taste but the sponge cake crust complemented the light recipe!  Highly recommend this one.

this recipe was amazing. i brought it to a party and my entire family raved about it- even my grandfather who hates anything with the words low calorie in it. there was also an amish cheesecake there that someone else had bought but everyone ate mine instead! it was honestly better than the amish one and it was about 100 times healthier too! you would never guess that this cheesecake is low-cal. thank you!

This was FANTASTIC!!!  Even my husband, who does not care for cheesecake, LOVED this - he said it did not have the bitter taste that cheesecake normally has.  It was so delicious, and tasted like the real thing.  Thank you!

Delicious flavor with a lighter texture than the usual heavy, dense cheesecake.  Everyone enjoyed this.  I think I beat my egg whites a little too stiff, however, because it was difficult to fold them into the cheese mixture and not have it "lump" up.  My cheesecake cracked quite a bit on top, so if appearance is important, you might definitely plan on using the cherry (or your favorite) topping.

I made some substitutions in this one... I used what I had home, which was 1/3 less fat cream cheese and only lite sour cream, but i used splenda and egg subtitute to compensate this. :) great!!
