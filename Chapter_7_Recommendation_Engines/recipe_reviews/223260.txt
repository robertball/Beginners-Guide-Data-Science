This was very good. The video, in addition to showing the authenticity of this recipe, was also helpful as part of step 4 is missing: adding the cooked tomatoes and tomatillos to the blender and blending with the chile mixture. I followed the recipe exactly with two exceptions that I also recommend: 4 cups chicken broth was way too much for simmering the chicken in step 1. I used 2 cups and it was still too much. Next time I will use just enough to cover the chicken. Next, instead of adding 2 cups broth to the mole in step 6, I added a little at a time until the mole was the right consistency, tasting as I went. It ended up being only 1 cup. Finally, as a note: this recipe will make about a quart of mole -- roughly twice as much as you will need. Personally, I will be making more chicken rather than waste the mole!

Just finished making this for dinner tonight. Luckily I did not have to work - the time involved is lengthy but well worth it. My husband and I gobbled it up! The recipe as written makes a lot of extra mole sauce, so I froze the leftovers. Probably could have done with only half the amount. And as another reviewer noted, I cut back on the chicken broth in the mole sauce (used about 1/2 the amount). We will make this again, on another day when we have a lot of time. Would recommend chopping everything up beforehand, rather than as you go like I did! It would probably save a lot of time in prep.

This was my first shot at mole sauce, and it was terrific. Don't be afraid to tweak the salt and sugar, but do so slowly and with patience. The recipe doesn't specify whether you should use unsweetened chocolate, but that's what I had. So I added several heapened teaspoons of sugar, but ONE AT A TIME. The sauce moved from chocolate bitter bite to deep, smooth mole, not sweet. It never fails to amaze me how both salt and sugar balance acidity without adding a salty or sweet flavor. It just came together beautifully. 

Also, I've worked with jalape√±os plenty, and I know to wear gloves. But I wasn't that familiar with these chilis, and just... didn't.  Don't do that. Hit Target for a box of basic latex gloves and suit up. My fingertips implore  you! :-)

I selected this recipe to make because I had leftover mole (Rick Bayless version) to use and poblanos and Anaheim peppers in the garden.  So, I only made the chicken filling for enchiladas which has a very good flavor.  The amount of meat to broth seems off.  I had to reduce the liquid for a long time.  I'd add more meat - say 2#, or reduce the chicken broth by 1 cup next time.

This is amazing!  Chicken enchiladas with Mole is one of my favorite dishes.  I've had it at multiple restaurants in the US and in Mexico and have tried multiple recipes to make at home.  This is hands down the best recipe and rivals some of my best restaurant experiences.   I usual use half the chicken and sauce for one meal and freeze half for another meal.  When I have time, I buy fresh corn tortillas to make the enchiladas  which while not a necessity, definitely cranks up the quality points

The mole came out way too tamato-y. The chicken filling for the enchiladas was especially good, though.

I have made the chicken alone many times to go with fajitas or as a side.  I do not reduce the amount of broth but I use a little more chicken (how does 4 thighs make 12 enchiladas? ? They must be large ones) . You need to let the chicken simmer for a while and using that much broth makes the chicken and peppers/onions extremely flavourful and tender. Don't be fooled by the lack of ingredients in the chicken... just be patient and let the liquid boil off and you will be left with tons of flavor.

I doubled the amount of chicken and onion, plus I used the same stock I cooked the chicken in to complete the mole sauce. Also I put in more chocolate than it called for and made corn on the cob and black beans as side dishes. I bet guacamole salad would complete it!

This was my first time trying to make mole.  Some corrections may be needed for this recipe:

* After cooking the tomatoes and tomatillas the recipe doesn't say what to do with them. I checked another mole recipe to find out that they go in the blender with the other ingredients.
* I think adding 2 more cups of chicken broth to the puree after putting it in the saucepan was not necessary. With only using 1 corn tortilla in the puree that was too much liquid if a thick sauce is wanted.  Another mole recipe calls for 2 cups chicken broth total, 2 corn tortillas and a dinner roll for thickening.

I added scallions and yellow straight neck squash, mushrooms and zucchini. It was awesome! Next time I will double the sauce, so when you reheat the left overs you with have the sauce to pore over it. My husband said it liked it even better the next day! Thanks this is a keeper.

My wife and I were addicted to mole when we lived in San Antonio, we have been on a constant search since we moved out of the area.  This is far better than any local options.

wow!! winner winner!  i compared a lot & this recipe hands down is fabulous.  first---it lays everything out perfectly.  real mole is a big deal & lots of recipes that deal with making mole the hard way rather than cutting corners make an already painstaking process even more difficult by giving you stupid, unnecessary steps.  this recipe has everything down to a science---it works simply follow the steps & it all works like a charm.  where others have you starting the night before, this saves you time & steps every step of the way.  priceless hints & process.  the meal is out of this world delicious.  so because i know i won't be making this very often i wanted to make it as good as i could.  all my produce, ingredients were organic & as good as i could find (which hot peppers in victoria canada are a challenge to find).  i went to our great butcher got real lard, organic chicken thighs & a leg.  started the chicken, since i knew i was going to be cooking it down the entire time i was doing the mole, with a bed of diced carrots, celery, parsley, a tlbs of cumin seeds, blk pepper, turmeric, a red onion, a huge onion, a head of garlic, 2 sweet red peppers, a squirt of tomato paste, a jalape√±o & the  called for mexican peppers,  & a box of pacific chicken broth.  then began the mole...i combined a few ingredients from frieda's in beverly hills.  the process they suggested is so convoluted  it makes your eyes cross but some of the ingredients are interesting so i added some of t

This was as good as any I've had in a restaurant! I doubled the recipe, but not the fresh peppers and tomatoes, but yes on the dried chiles. It took a lot longer than 2 hours, and used every pan I had in the house, but it was well worth it!
