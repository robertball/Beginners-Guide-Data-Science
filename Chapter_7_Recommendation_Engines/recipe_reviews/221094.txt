Excellent dip! One thing I did differently was to use real bacon crisped and chopped. A word of caution here if you choose to use real bacon is that it WILL get soggy and wimpy if it sits for more than a few hours. Make your bacon up ahead and store in a separate air tight container until ready to serve, then just stir it in.

I used reduced fat sour cream and reduced fat Hellman's (we don't use Miracle Whip). After mixing the ingredients, I did throw in more of the cheese, tomatoes, bacon and onion as well as some fresh ground pepper. This makes a great cracker spread--we all enjoyed it. If you can stand waiting, make this as early as you can before you want to eat it. The more it sits, the better it is.

I love BLT dip!! I've been making this for years and only things different are using mayo instead of miricle whip ( and I eat my actual BLT's with miricle whip) and using real bacon. I also don't add cheese but thats cause I don't eat cheese on my BLT's. When I was introduced to this the girl that brought this dip used toasted bread triangles, which was the best way to serve this dip but who wants to sit there and toast a whole loaf of bread, crackers is what I always serve it with.

This came together quickly and was tasty, but I didn't LOVE it.  It wasn't that dip that I just can't stay out of, but it was a very nice dip.  I liked the tomatoes and the smokiness of the bacon.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, Suzanne.

It was a nice change for a dip but not a WOW for me.  I had some people say they liked it but had a good amount left over.  It was not a dip that I could not say out of.  It is worth making to see if you like it.  It is a quick dip with things you may have just laying around your house.

I had to adapt this to fit what was in my fridge and some things i needed to use up. I used reduced fat sour cream and the tail end of some whipped cream cheese. I used super sweet baby tomatoes and I fried my own bacon ( 5 slices). I added the green onion into the dip. I made home made crostini to go with this for a movie later tonight. I tasted it and its very good. Note I did use Dukes mayo because I dont have miracle whip.
