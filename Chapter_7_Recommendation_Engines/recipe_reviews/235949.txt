I think this is my new all time favorite soup! I have made so many different variations of this recipe by using what I had on hand. Instead of olive oil I use coconut oil and add about 4 cloves of fresh garlic...I've added cabbage, zucchini, crushed red pepper, you name it. It gets better every time I make it!

I added 1 clove of garlic after frying onion then added 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp turmeric and a dash of cayenne pepper at the end - it was delicious I will use it again

Didn't change a thing.  Couldn't be much simpler.  And for sure delicious.  I've made this many times.  Usually use cannellini beans.  They come out so creamy.

This recipe was fabulous, and so simple yet so tasty!!  I had no cannelloni beans but had some red potatoes from the garden.  I boiled 5 medium sized red potatoes that were cubed in a vegetarian chicken broth.  In a separate pan I sauteed a full onion and about 6 cloves of garlic that I minced in a food processor.  I took a host of tomatoes from the garden and pulsed them in the food processor and added it to the onions and garlic and reduced this mixture.  This I added to the potatoes and kale.  I always de-stem kale (the main stem), I think it reduces the bitterness - I also chopped it finely.  I used no other spices other than extra salt and pepper.  It really needs nothing.  So impressive and simple.  I WILL make this again - so easy to add variable vegetables from the garden.  Thanks so much for posting!

Delicious and wholesome, for lunch or a light supper.  I added a cup more broth and used cannelloni beans as suggested by an other reviewer and added some hot sauce and grated Parmesan before serving.

I'm always surprised how easy and delicious this is. I get tons of Kale from my CSA so this is one way to get it eaten while fresh! I usually add whatever needs to go, I affectionately call this 'kitchen sink soup'. Typically I add garlic with the onions, and cayenne before the liquid and a can of corn. I have added green beans, chard, zucchini...you name it! You can't really go wrong. It's a canvas waiting for your touch.

This was a nice change from the other kale soups that I make like (Olive Garden's which I prefer), but welcomed the change of flavors this one gave. I pretty much kept to the recipe but did use some cherry tomatoes for the small tomato (what I had on hand) and I did add a clove of garlic while sauteing the onion. I did cook a little longer at the end, just because I wanted the kale cooked a bit more.***Made again and this time I doubled the recipe and used a can of diced tomatoes.  I thought this gave too much of a tomato taste so next time back to just a tomato.  Did add some garlic again to the onion while sauteing.***Made again and used Roma tomatoes instead of can and it was good. Forgot the garlic this time and I could taste the difference.

This soup was so simple to make and absolutely delicious.  I used my homemade chicken broth and a full can of white beans.  It was perfect, healthy and tasty.

Wow!  So easy & quick & delicious!   I had left over rotisserie chicken, kale, zucchini and homemade chicken broth that I needed to hurry and use before they went bad.   I sauteed some red onions and red bell peppers, and as one recommendation suggested, I also add potatoes and red pepper flakes.  After tasting it, I realized I also had some cheese tortillini in the freezer & added those right at the end - it made this recipe absolutely perfect!  I also added grated parmesan on top just before serving.  What a great way to use up everything in the fridge without waste &  my husband scarfed it down!

Very tasty soup! I doubled the recipe since it was for two grownups and one toddler and there was plenty! I'm looking forward to eating it for left overs tomorrow for lunch! Based on other reviews I added 1tsp of turmeric and cumin since I doubled the recipe. I also added garlic while I cooked the onion. We are this with Annie's cheddar bunnies. Yummy!

Surprisingly delicious. Added a few things though - package of vegetable flavored quinoa (don't remember the brand), two tablespoons of crushed garlic, 1/2 tsp cumin and an additional cup (at least) of broth. The quinoa thickens it up and adds a bit of protein to the dish.

great easy fast recepie. I used ready cut kale in a bag and reduced sodium broth. Because of that, I did have to add s/p and some salt free spice from costco to give more flavor. I used yellow tomatoes since that is what i had on hand but look forward to using red tomatoes next time. I would double the recepie to have enough for a family of 4. Might even add more broth, more beans.

I give it 4 stars as is. I've made exact recipe over the years and feel it's 5 stars with the addition of a few things. A teaspoon of cinnamon  (trust me, it's magic!) And 2 tablespoons of sourcream to give it a creamier texture, without adding loads of calories.

I used cannelloni beans also, adding 1/2 tsp of turmeric and 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, and some salt towards the end. Also, before i added in the kale, i massaged it with salt.

I have made this recipe now about 5 times and have loved the original and several of the substitutions I’ve tried, so felt I was ready to rate it! My favorite thing is to add a few cloves of garlic when sautéing the onions, use zucchini instead of tomatoes, and add 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and white pepper, and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. Then a little additional seasoning as needed, but this is a DELICIOUS soup I could eat everyday!

This is soo good! I did make two modifications of using a can of diced tomatoes in tomato juice, instead of dicing a tomato. I also used veggie broth instead of chicken broth. Delicious!

I was given a ton of fresh from the garden kale - 3 different kinds- from a farmer I helped out. I really wanted to use all of this fresh kale so I made this easy, simple basic soup recipe. I hadn't made kale soup in 15 years and forgot how really good it is! I added Kielbasa because I love Portuguese soup - Caldo Verde- and didn't have access to the usual linguica or chourico sausage. I also suggest bite sized potato pieces, wax beans, cannelloni beans (canned is easier) The soup freezes well after cooking, and it tastes even better the day after cooking.
