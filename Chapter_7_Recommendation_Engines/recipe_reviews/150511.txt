Very good.  However, it needs a little "doctoring up".  I used frozen broccoli and cauliflower mix (I didn't thaw first as recipe suggests).  I also used instant brown rice instead of white.  I like the texture of brown rice better, but I think a cup was too much.  The dressing mix give the soup a very nice flavor but I still had to add salt and I added a few shakes of McCormick's Garlic Pepper.  Very easy to make.  I had it done and on my way out the door in 1/2 hr.

This was a yummy filling quick soup for a busy day. I do think there is too much rice:liquid in the ratio, I ended up using 6 cups total of liquid and it was none too thin. The seasoning pack gave a nice hint of flavor but I do agree with other reviewers that you'll probably want to add in some of your favorite seasonings. A great base recipe I look forward to playing off of in the future, thanks for sharing.

my kids were sick and of course I was out of chicken noodle soup.  I decided to try this recipe but just used things I already had.  I didn't have italian dressing mix so I improvised with a garlic and herb seasoning mix.  I used frozen vegetables, didn't thaw them first.  Also I used some ready made chicken and just reheated/browned it to get the flavor in the saucepan.  It turned out pretty good!  My kids didn't have much of an appetite but they seemed to like it.  It's not something I would make for guests but as a last minute soup to help them feel better it worked for us.

The original is good.. However this time around I decided to change the vegetables to squash and zucchini with carrots... It was well accepted by my 8 yr old grandson who doesn't really like squash...

It was pretty good, but it definitely needed something else.
