If you like a thiner soup this is it but I prefer a thicker soup so I added an equal amount of drained whole kernel corn and left out 2 cans of evap milk. I crumbled the bacon and added it as a garnish with a bit of shredded cheese. This recipe is as easy as falling off a log and has a delicous flavor,,,I use it in my restaurant and recomend it.  Lois

I work at a lodge in the mountains of Idaho. I had some guest coming in for lunch. I needed a quick tasty lunch idea. I cooked this soup up and it was a great hit. It was sweet and creamy and very easy to make. I didn't have any celery so I used celery seed and added a couple of potatoes.  Thanks so much.

I made this recipe a week ago and it was really good.  But I must admit that it was rather thin making it less of a chowder and more so a vegetable soup.  I made the recipe again, though this time I added a tablespoon and a half of flour after sauteing the vegetables to make a sort of roux.  This came out to a much better consistency then before.

The consistancy of this recipe is really too thin. I would cut back the water and maybe subtract a can of the cond milk. Like the other reviewer, I also added potatoes to make it a little chunkier. Good and easy recipe!

This was as good as corn chowder can be, really easy and tasted wonderful.  I just added a bit more salt and pepper to taste.  This is a great recipe, thank you for posting it!

Very delicious recipe. I made this for Christmas day.  I left out the bacon, as I dont eat pork ( its not available at my organic farm ). I also only used 1 can of evaporated milk, and I added 3 red skinned potatoes chopped up to give it more substance. Will definitely make this again!

this was pretty good. i halved the recipe but left the full amount of bacon.  :)  substituted red pepper.  used whole corn, taking half and running through food processor.  would use 1/4 - 1/2 of the amount of water recommended.  we added cayenne pepper for a nice kick. :)

Very nice. I used celery instead of celery leaves, because I could not find any celery leaves. My family loved it. It has a bit of a thin consistency, but other than that, it's great!

I read a few of the reviews and how other users found this to be too thin. I decided to not add the water at all. It was too sweet for me. If I make it again I think I will add cooked potatoes.
