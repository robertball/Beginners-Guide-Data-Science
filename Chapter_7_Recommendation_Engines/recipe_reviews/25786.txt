I've been making these for years and they are   
always a huge hit.  DO NOT boil longer than 3 minutes or it will turn into a crumbly mess that won't roll together.

These are a really nice holiday treat although you can enjoy it any time you choose.  I've made this recipe for years, but the difference is that I use 1 cup sugar, 1 cup chopped dates, 1 egg, 1 stick of margarine, 1 tsp vanilla, 2 1/2 cups rice krispies, and 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  As I form the balls I roll it in coconut.  If the mixture is too hot, the balls will not form correctly and if it is too cool the coconut won't stick like it should.  The mixture should be cool enough to handle.

I loved these as a child but I have hated making them as an adult because of the sticky mess when rolling them into balls. So last year, instead of rolling them, I pressed the mixture into a greased baking dish. I then sprinkled the top with coconut and pressed it lightly into the mixture. I let it cool and then cut into bars. Much easier and just as tasty!

Love these!  I make these every holiday season to add to my cookie platters.  A few times I have "saved" a batch that was over-boiled and became crumbly by stirring in a couple teaspoons of very hot water to reconstitute the mixture.  As long as it has not burned that might make it easier to handle.

a really classy take on a rice crispie treat!  Loved these.  I found that I was not making any headway with the double boiler so just poured the mixture into a teflon coated pan and heated on low til it boiled, stirring constantly with a wire whisk.  Nice and soft and found that you don't have to work quickly with these when attempting to roll, as the mixture stays nice and soft and pliable.  Rolled in toasted coconut/chopped pecan mixture.  I used mahjool dates and hand chopped into large bits.  I found that the dates blended into the egg mixture and were not whole chopped in the cookie.  That is a great thing for those that stick up their noses at dates.  It more or less added a bit of a nutty taste to the mixture.  Presents beautifully for the holiday trays, as well. thanks for this wonderful non-chocolate addition to a holiday tray!

I've made SIX batches of these for various friends/family/functions so far this winter, and they've been a huge hit!  They're a little sweet for my taste, but I tried making them with less sugar and they didn't hold together as well.

I made one batch sans-coconut and just pressed them into a casserole dish like a batch of rice crispies, and my brothers liked them even better that way, which is nice because forming the little balls and rolling them in coconut is really the only time consuming part of this delicious treat.  :)

These are exactly like what my mom used to make when I was a child.  We mixed it up and rolled some in powdered sugar and chocolate coated some as well.  I crave these every year.

Very, very sweet!  Also very messy to roll into balls.  If you cook the mixture on high heat, you'll scramble the eggs, so make sure you watch it and stir constantly.  Very tasty treat, especially with toasted pecans.

My mom has been making a recipe similar to this for years at X-mas time. Only real difference is she adds ground pecans to the recipe when you add the rice krispies. The only thing I hate about making these is when you need to form the balls it's easy to burn your fingers--I would recommend using a cookie scoop if you have one!

My mother made this recipe for years and I have done the same for over 20 years.  This is an excellent recipe!  I agree with the comment regarding cooking it too long - I did this myself one year and had very hard, not chewy Date Balls.  I realized my error immediately.  Someone had suggested cooking to a "firm" stage - that makes sense to me.

I remember these from when I was little.  My gramma would make them around the holidays.  I had forgotten about them until I went through her recipe book.  I was so excited to find this recipe; especially the reviews.  I made a batch and they did not stick together after reading reviews I know I cooked the mixture too long.  Thanks for sharing.  Oh, we make them in a log form rolled in coconut and then slice once they have been refrigerated.

These tasted good but they were extemely crunchy --- not at all what I expected. Extra crunch was not from the krispie cereal, either; I thought of that already :) I'll make these again but I will not boil as long, I think the mixture overcooked. Still enjoyed the flavor though.

These came together quickly and easily and they are DELICIOUS! I made a few alterations: cut sugar down to 3/4 cup, added 1/4tsp salt, and stirred in 1/2cup walnuts in the place of 1/2 cup of the cereal. They turn out absolutely beautiful and are so good, I've eaten 10 myself already! Notes: I didn't time the stove-top, but I think the burner was on at medium heat for about 5 minutes, did NOT boil for the whole 5 minutes. Also, you don't need that much coconut, I didn't measure mine out, just threw some in a bowl for rolling.

These were the best date balls.  My family had lost my grandmother's recipe, but these were spot on.  I did follow other reviewers and did not boil for longer than 3 minutes and brought to a boil over medium-low heat. I also rolled in powdered sugar instead of  coconut because that's what grandma always did.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

What a mess to make! But pretty good! I used 2 spoons to make balls and dropped into coconut. I found that to be a bit easier. It took me a long time to get it boiling because I was very cautious about burning. But it worked out great!

These are a holiday tradition in my family. Our recipe calls for only 1 egg and we add chopped nuts and chopped Maraschino (or candied)cherry. The cherry makes them look more Christmasy and adds a nice flavor. It is always time consuming rolling them out so this year I tried what another reviewer suggested and pressed them in a pan. I put shredded coconut in the bottom of the pan first, pressed in the cookie, and then pressed more coconut on the top. If I get around to it I might cut them into squares and then see if I can roll the edges in coconut too. Glad to see others like this date recipe.

My mom and I used to make these at Christmas time and they were a family favorit.  She has passed and lost the recipe.  This is the exact one and it tastes amazing....I challenege anyone who things they may not like dates to try this!!!  I agree with the others though...Boil for only 3 minutes.

Please change "stir occasionally" to stir constantly once it reaches the boil stage...I ruined a good pan!  I also found it helpful to rinse and butter my hands between forming the balls.  Once completed, these are tasty!

My mom always made these for Christmas. My sister isn't a date fan so I also make a cherry version as well; I use drained maraschino cherries instead of dates, pressed the mixture into a buttered pan because it takes a lot less time (I'm lazy sometimes ; ) and put melted white chocolate on top with a little sprinkle of red colored sugar. They were very good.

This is a very good cookie!  I loved it as a kid, and still love it 40 years later.   As for this recipe - ingredients are correct.  The instructions on how to roll balls are way too difficult.  Instead, place a bed of coconut on wax paper, and drop the final mixture a few spoonfuls at a time on to the coconut.  Then roll with coconut in your hands.   That way you don't have to deal with too much stickiness.

Love this recipe! My mom and I made these when I was a child. The only difference is that we always put about 1/2 c. of fresh chopped pecans. It helps to cut the sweetness a bit. Thanks for sharing!

I have been making this recipe at Christmas for my family for 30 years. It was given to me by my MIL who had been making it since my husband was a boy.  Needless to say it's not Christmas in our house until these are done!

My spouse requests these every Christmas. I reduce the rice cereal by half and roll in fine coconut.  I also use 2 spoons to roll the balls. They taste best when refrigerated.

These are a delicious, light dessert that present beautifully! I chopped the dates in a food processor, which is way easier than chopping them by hand. As suggested by other reviewers, I pressed the mixture into a coconut-covered pan and then sprinkled coconut on top. I also omitted the egg and replaced the butter with a margarine/coconut blend, as suggested by another reviewer. I donât think those little changes had a affect on the taste. Every guest at dinner took a few home. Thanks for this delicious and simple recipe!

The hardest part is rolling the cookies. Use lots of coconut and drop by teaspoonful. Cover with coconut, then use hands to roll. Reviews were very helpful. These treasures donât last. Favorite since I was a kid. (60âs)

I was looking through my moms old recipes, and found this exact recipe she made when I was little! I was so excited to find it. I made these last year during the holidays, and I plan on making them every year from here on out! Everyone loves them, and I think theyâre pretty easy to make considering you donât have to bake anything. Give them a try, you wonât be disappointed!

these are not bad but would rather go egg free as there is no need for the egg if you add butter.  Proper date balls as they are knows don't have rice krispys in them this is the proper recipe below. Plain and simple! I know we all have a recipe that we prefer  and mine is, one pkt of coconut biscuits ground up, half a cup butter melted,  about half a cup desiccated coconut and two slabs of pitted dates.  Add to blender and grind up.  When done make into balls and roll in coconut and put in fridge.  If too dry just add more butter.  After a few hrs in the fridge they are nice and hard.  there is no way that you can go wrong, Just wing it

Addicting! I could only find already sweetened dates in the baking aisle. It was a 6 oz (3/4) package. I skipped the sugar therefore. I also used unsweetened coconut. I added 1/2 c toasted, chopped pecans and 2 1/2 c Krispies. I made these with a group of kids so it worked great to spread them into an 8 x 8 instead of balls. The kids loved them!

These are always a favorite when I make them. Sometimes I add chopped nuts. Extremely easy, I generally boil the dates, sugar, and eggs for 3-4 minutes, not 5. Even my teenagers (who are not big coconut fans) love these!

I made these as written, and as I suspected, they were way too sweet for my taste. So now I make them with a few minor changes that make a big difference. I replace the 1 cup of sugar with 1/2 cup of honey. The dates are very sweet all on their own and in my opinion do not need as much added sugar as called for in the recipe. The honey, in a lower amount, seems perfect to me. I also usually omit the rice Krispies. They are good enough in there, but I like this recipe better without. I also add 1/4 teaspoon sea salt. Salt is a great addition to sweet recipes (think chocolate covered pretzels - the salty and sweet are soooo good together!). I incorporate the coconut into the mixture rather than just around the outside. And lastly, instead of rolling into balls, I place the mixture between two sheets of wax paper and roll it into a log about 1" in diameter and then cut into 2" logs. Neat and easy and so super delicious!!!

I really like these, and I'm not a big cookie fan.  I found it was easier to roll by adding coconut to the mixture--then it would get formed and stay together.  I also found that it makes a difference if you buy brand name shredded coconut vs store brand.  The store brand coconut is dryer, making it harder to roll and stay together. Edit:  I froze these.  When I want a few, I pop in the micro for couple of seconds, and they are still wonderful

These are amazing-I now have a new favorite recipe!  My daughter came home from school asking for date balls, and I looked them up and found this recipe, which is lacking the nuts that other recipes have.  I read the reviews and decided to try it out, heeding the advice from comments to a. boil only 3 minutes, and b. using only 2 cups of rice crisps, based on comments that they are too crunchy.

Result was PERFECT!  Nice, gooey yet slightly crunchy texture.  Butter on the fingers is a must for rolling.  I will be making these for every holiday, birthday and anniversary celebration from now on.  They were a huge hit! :)

I have always made date balls with marshmallows, brown sugar, and rolled them in powdered sugar.  I found I didn't have any marshmallows and I had coco krispies instead of Rice Crispies. So I made this recipe just as it asked, put in 3 cups of the Coco Crispies, and rolled them in the coconut.  Came out absolutely amazing!  Family loved them!  Will have to make these again.  Fantastic!
