I hate to give low ratings but I just had a hard time enjoying this.  The sweetness from the cranberry sauce overpowered everything else.  I didn't have havarti so I used white cheddar.  I really liked idea of this sandwich and it sounded so good, but I just could not enjoy the sweetness.  Glad I gave it a shot but I won't be making it again.

I love turkey and cranberry sauce on a sandwich! Whole berry is definitely better than jellied for this, it is a bit less sweet. I like to spread a little cream cheese on the bread too before the cranberry sauce.
