It is even tastier and creamier if you add 1 egg yolk, whipped separately in a cup with some sugar until it turns fluffy and light-yellow in color.  Then add to the egg mixture, 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1 tsp. of cinnamon, mixing well.  Add some of the milk (can also use evaporated milk instead of whole milk) to the egg mixture, mixing well.  To the egg and milk mixture, add your cornstarch mixing well and making sure all lumps are dissolved before pouring into your sauce pan.  Then pour the remaining milk and sugar into your sauce pan stirring constantly. Salt is not necessary and should be optional.

We (Chicagoans from Puerto Rico) call this Maizena.  Really good breakfast; like eating hot cereal.

This is sooo good.  I added 3 eggs and enough milk to make the 2 cups of liquid.  Took less time to thicken also.  I had day old cornbread which I popped in the micro with butter and served with the custard.  Wonderful!

Glad I found this recipe - I was clearly adding too much cornstarch to mine.  This recipe is really good and almost exactly what I grew up with in my Puerto Rican household.  A couple of additions/substitutions that makes this Maizena (as my family calls it) exactly what I remember - about a tablespoon of butter which will add to the creaminess, and instead of 2 cups of milk, add 1 1/2 cups of milk and 1/2 cup of coconut milk. The light taste of the coconut milk really puts this over the top and exactly as I remember growing up! Delicious!!!

I'm not Puerto Rican, but this is the same recipe I grew up on from my grandmother in Nebraska. The only difference is after thickening, we would add a little butter to make it a little richer, then serve it over toast and sprinkle with the cinnamon. The best breakfast in all the world!! Talk about your "comfort food".

Tasty & different. Yummy with equal parts white & brown sugar too.  Will share recipe with others / make it again.  I'd consider adding: 1 egg or 2 to increase protein, and perhaps some cut up seasonal fruit before or after cooking.

My 4 year old daughter just loved this recipe, she couldn't get enough. We added raisins once the custard was served to add a little more texture. This was a very easy  dish to make, and will be used again and again!

Just like Abuelita used to make!  The secret is to make sure you have it over the heat until it's thick, otherwise you'll have a soupy result!

I'm from PR and I make this all the time, especially now for my little munchkin and he loves it! The only difference is that I've always used evaporated milk and add vanilla extract.

Great Recipe! In order to make sure you don't have lumpy custard when putting your cornstarch in, put your cornstarch in a separate little bowl, add some milk in it, and whisk with a fork until combined and no lumps... Makes perfect smooth custard every time. 
I added cut up Granny Apples and some oatmeal... very good!

This
is a tasty custard. I didn't use egg yolks, as some reviewers
suggested, made a recipe as is, just used less sugar. Simple and tasty
breakfast idea.

This tasted like my grandmother used to make. I don’t like avena so she tried this and I’m 45 now and still can’t get enough. I’ve been searching for years and I finally found it. Thank you!

The recipe turned out great it only took about 10 minutes or so for it to thicken. This recipe reminded me of when my grandma use to make this for my brother and I; which in Puerto Rico we call it Maizena.

Everytime my grandmother comes to visit us from P.R., she makes this for us.  Funny how I never bothered to ask her for the recipe, but this one is just like it.  Delicious!!  Simple.  Will make again.

This is really tasty as a dessert too! I've made it as is, with extra cornstarch, with cocoa, and adding butter to the end product, and I loved every version.

Note to those who, like me, don't have the attention span to stir for half an hour: you can make this in the microwave. I used the method from the Hasty Chocolate Pudding recipe on this site. It takes me only 5min 30sec to make it that way which is way more realistic for me as I'm not a morning person. at all.

My grandmother used to make this for me when I was little girl.  I remember eating it on hot summer mornings in her covered portch with my father when we visited Puerto Rico.  My father died when I was a teenager so I never got a chance to get his recipes.  I've thought about this custard on and off for years and was delighted when I found it on allrecipes.  I just made it with my 5-year-old daughter and we both loved it!  I enjoy hot cereals but she turns her nose up to them so I was pleasantly surprised when she asked if we can make it tomorrow morning.  Recipe is perfect!  I wouldn't recommend changing a thing.

This is a wonderful recipe. I followed the directions exactly and it turned out great with a smooth, creamy texture and delicious flavor. I've tried adding a little vanilla extract sometimes (about 1/8 tsp) and I like it that way too.

This didn't take anywhere near the half-hour cooking time as the poster stated. I turned my heat down down 5 minutes into cooking and then another five and it was off the heat.
Added a couple shakes of vanilla to it since I found the taste to subtle.

But growing up in FL I got to try this whenever my PR classmates brought some in for a school function.

Definitely goes great over oatmeal too.

This is a great recipe but, I did 1 1/2 cups of milk and half cup of coconut milk and wow,  it was delish!  You may want to cut down on the sugar by 1 tablespoon otherwise, it will be really sweet. . Enjoy. .

This recipe was so simple and easy to follow. I grew up on this and haven't had it in such a long time. Was happy to find it here n for it to turn out just like mom's was even better!

I was craving this that my puertorican mom used to make me when I was little and I found it! This was my favorite hot cereal. As I was making it, I could smell my mom cooking it. It brought back memories. Gave it four starts because it was too sweet to taste. Next time I will make it with less sugar and it will be perfect for me.

Doing it the way they called for over 30 minutes resulted in inedible burnt char.  Never again.

I make this exactly as the recipe calls and it tastes amazing every time! My mom says that  it is the perfect combination of ingredients which makes me proud to serve this to my children as this is something we grew up with. Because it does take a while to cook (and I hate to stand there stirring the whole time) I don't make it very frequently in my household. I guess that just makes it more special when I DO make it. All in all it is a great recipe and a very nice change for breakfast. Especially in winter!

Almost perfect! A little sweet though and it thickened up quicker than I anticipated (fluke?) I think next time I will use just a small amount of sweetened condensed milk instead.

I will make it again. Did not stir for 25 minutes. Boiled milk first then whisked in cornstarch until thick few minutes. Used cinnamon water ( cinnamon boiled in water for a few minutes) replaced one cup milk with a cup of coconut creme/milk. Grandma recipe. So gooood!!! No sugar used.

This was my favorite dish my grandmother used to make for me, but I never knew the actual name because she called it "Superman". She said it would make you as strong as superman. She taught me how to make it and I used to make it for my kids, but I forgot how. This is the recipe except we added the egg yellow. I thought it was egg white, but people here are saying egg yellow. I also used canned milk because you get a higher concentration of calcium for kids that don't like to drink milk.  I'm so glad I found this recipe. Gonna make it tomorrow. Can't wait! Thanks

It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. Came out perfect, however, I used a little less sugar. Thank you so much! My husband and I had been craving this for a very long time, now we introduced our kids to it and they love it.

This was interesting to me. Pretty good, but maybe to really love it you have to grow up eating it. I did add an egg, tempered with some of the hot custard toward the beginning of cooking. It tasted a little flavorless so I added more cinnamon and some vanilla extract. Reminds me a little of cream of wheat. It was a comforting way to use up some milk.

First time making it and it was a hit!  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I don't usually have whole milk on hand so I made it with skim (1 1/2 cup) and heavy whipping cream (1/2 cup).  Served with buttered toast and it was gone when I turned around.  I did add a dash of vanilla as well.  Will make it again!

Soooo happy I found this recipe ! As I was trying to fix a vanilla custard gone wrong it was reminding me of breakfast with my Puerto Rican Abuelita. My other grandmother was Cuban and didn't know about it.Or maybe it was" Grandma War Competition" LOL. One thing I can't do is use a real coconut like Abuela included. She had a arm like Derrick Jetter. Thanks  Lu and the rest of you for bringing back a little bit of my childhood-
G.

I did it exactly as recipe stated the first time. It tasted great, but who has the time to wait 20-30 minutes. Second time did as some suggested and I added the egg and done in about 15. I could live with that. The taste was not that far off from the original. Thank you. It reminded my husband and brother-in-law of when their mother used to make it for them as children on the Island (PR).

This was like eatable velvet!  It was soooooooo creamy. I did make some minor changes: I used baker's sugar instead of regular, lactose free milk, and added a pat of butter to the custard when I served it.  Thanks Lu!

Made the recipe with the ingredients you suggested, no eggs required! I grew up in a Puerto Rican household and my newly-wed hubby is white boy who loves spanish food! I'm a terrible cook, but this site has helped me improve! We both enjoyed your Maizena recipe! I only had to whisk it for about 5 minutes and it came out to the consistency that I remembered as a kid. Thanks again

four and a half star recipe. added 1 egg yolk, 1 tblsp. butter, and some vanilla. would add either more vanilla or more cinnamon.it set much earlier than 25 minutes that i thought i burned it! it was semi flavorless so add some more vanilla or more cinnamon, but overall a good breakfast recipe. make sure you do not use a nonstick pan or you will wreck the nonstick coating when you are whisking it. may make this again (50% chance).

It was okay. I cooked it as long as it said, but I think it was a little too long. If I try to make this again, I will either reduce the heat a bit or shorten the cooking time. The flavor was okay, but the consistency was a little odd. It congealed and was almost a bit more like gelatin than a pudding.

I ate this as a child growing up and loved it. I added an egg and vanilla extract like others suggested and it was delicious. My kids love it aswell. I also refrigerated the leftovers in small plastic cups and enjoyed it as a cold custard treat.

This came out amazing! My husband said it reminded him of his mom. For my taste a little sweet but for him it was perfect! This will be a weekend staple.
