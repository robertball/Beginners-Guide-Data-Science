No strawberry liqueur I used Raspberry Pucker instead. The lemonade I used was homemade. Sweet but delicious and refreshing.

dddddddeeeeeeelicus. Instead of strawberry schnapps (or liquer try Stoli strawberry (smirnoff is too sweet) and add a shot of sprite for the fizz and to thin up the liqours blue and lemonade tend to be very acidy i found (as a bartender) adding a quick shot of ginge or sprite tends to a huge differencein drinks. i even add it to my margaritas

I didn't have strawberry so I used raspberry liqueur. It was sweet but very refreshing. Adult koolaid at it's finest.
