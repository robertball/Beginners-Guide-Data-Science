After a few changes this was wonderful. I made a lime cilatro marinade for the chicken(olive oil,lime juice,cilantro, and garlic) and let it marinade for a few hours, then when i cooked it i put a couple of sprigs of cilatro on it then the tomato and cheese and i took some canned black olives chopped them up and added them on top. The family loved it.

Absolutley mouth-watering! I took the advice of other reviewers and marinated the chicken in olive oil, garlic and lime juice before cooking in the skillet. I used the marinade to brown the chicken in the skillet instead of using additional olive oil. The only addition I will add next time will be to place cooked bacon on top of the chicken before baking in the oven. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I served it with rice pilaf and a fresh salad.

I adored this recipe!  I definitely recommend making it as soon as you can!  It is quick and easy and will certainly be added to my list of favorites.  I did marinate the chicken in olive oil and a little lemon juice as recommended and I added a clove of minced garlic to the marinade.  I then sauteed it in the marinade and also added 1/2 of a sweet onion sliced.  I used pre-shredded mexican cheese as well and loved how the flavors all mixed together. Don't leave out the avocado!  I wasn't too sure about it but did it anyway and now I am excited about trying more things with avocado.  It was the crowning touch. Yum!

This tastes great and is so simple to prepare.   I changed it a tiny bit and grilled the chicken after marinating it in olive oil, lemon juice and lemon pepper.   I then popped it in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese.   After it was put together I added a few sprigs of cilantro.   YUM.

I only made two changes to this recipe (but I'm sure it's great the way it is). I added just a little garlic to the chicken (we love garlic) and I grilled the chicken instead of sauteing. I agree with others that it may be easier to dice the tomato (and even the avocado) to make sure you have all the ingredients in one bite. Excellent and easy recipe!

This dish was fantastic with several varying flavors. I took past suggestions and marinated the chicken in olive oil, lime juice, black pepper and onion powder. Instead of adding a slice of tomatoe and avocado, I made guacamole with avocado, salsa, cilantro and a little bit of salt to taste. I garnished it with some cilantro. It had an excellent flavor.

This was an awesome and unique way to prepare chicken. A good way to mix things up a bit when you tend to make chicken the same way all the time. This was a great meal! The avacados started turning black once I cut them so I would recommend cutting them RIGHT BEFORE you serve the chicken.

I love tomato and avocado, and when mixed with the cheese and tender chicken the flavors of this recipe were delicious!  I did't cook the chicken all the way through in the pan since cooking it in the oven would finish it off...I like my chicen to be very tender...and my guests were able to cut it with a fork.  I served this dish with corn on the cob and home-made stuffing.  Everybody raved!

I LOVE this recipe!  The previous reviews were helpful too--it defnitely needed the added flavor of the cilantro/lime.  My kids love it, too.  They even eat the avacado, something they're not "used to"!

This was yummy. Squeezed lime juice onto chicken and fresh cilantro before tomato and cheese. Very simple :)

Recipe is good but I like my version of California chicken better, which is marinated in Lawrys Hawaiian marinade, then topped with swiss or jack cheese and avocados or guac.

Made this dish as is and it was a little too bland for us.  I like the concept though, especially with the fresh veggies.  Next time I'll add a little garlic seasoning to the chicken and spice it up by using pepper jack cheese.

We really enjoyed this dish...The key to making this dish really good is to marinate the chicken breast in olive oil, cilantro, lime juice and some garlic (as suggested by other reviewers)... over night is best but marinate at least 4-6 hours.  We made this both ways and a long marinate really makes this dish! We marinated the first set of chicken 2 hours and it was ok....didn't use all the chicken and kept in marinate overnight and the chicken was moist with a wonderful lime/cilantro favor through out.  Didn't use onion powder We carmalized some sliced onion and put the avocado's on top of the onions..... YUMM!  Cut the avocado right before serving... if necessary and sprinkle some lime or lemon juice on the slices to keep from turning brown so fast. All the flavors really go well together. Thank you Ingrid for sharing with us.

Great recipe and easy.  I too, marinated the chicken in lime and olive oil.  I cooked some onions in olive oil along with southwest seasonings I had and cooked it with the chicken.  It caramelized well and added some great flavor.  Just had the leftovers for lunch today and it tasted as good as it did last night.  This one is a keeper.  Easy and delicious!

I tasted really good but I think next time I might make a montery jack cheese sauce to drizzle over the chicken and rice. Everyone liked it though and its really really easy

Admittedly, I did not follow the recipe as written...I did marinate the chicken in cilantro-garlic-lime-etc...I wish I'd have just grilled the chicken after marinating all day cause that part was great! I cannot imagine how bland this would have been without. Just the toppings were a bit too bland for our tastes. IF I try it again I'll marinate the chicken longer & possibly reserve some marinade to dress the tomatoes & avocados. Needs  a sauce of some sort, like hollandaise or even chicken gravy would be nice, but way too bland as written.

love this recipe, except I use a can of Rotel diced tomatoes, instead of the fresh tomatoes.  Then place the chicken breast with toppings on a bed of Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice...

This dish ia amazing!!!! So easy to make.. yet sophisticated. I did make a few changes. i simmered the chicken breast in a mixture of shallots, lime juice and cilantro until cooked. I also use one full avocado for each chicken breast. The rest of the recipe was the same. Will be cooking this again.

I marinated the chicken for a couple of hours in tequila,lime juice,rice vinegar and minced onion but didn't otherwise change any ingredients. To save on the mess and heat I added the cheese and tomato to the chicken in the skillet and covered on low until the cheese melted. This was very good and a simple meal with some Lime Cilantro Rice.

I really loved this dish but made a few minor adjustments. First I did as a lot of others did and marinated the chicken (breasts sliced in half) in evoo, onion powder, garlic salt, pepper and lime juice. I then pan seared it all in the oil mix. Next i placed in oven with slices of (cooked) bacon on them then the tomato and then the cheese. Plated and topped them off with avocado. NOTE: do not use Florida avocados!! they are horribly tough and lacking flavor. I served with white rice, also did try chopped tomatoes and avocados in with the rice as an alternative and it worked out nicely. Great flavors in this dish.. will definitely be making this again. Thank you Ingrid!!

I really loved this recipe!  My husband has asked me to make this at least once a week.  It is so fast and easy to make. The only thing different I did was used lots of garlic while grilling the chicken.  Other than that it was amazing, served with green beans and yellow rice on the side. Delicious!

My husband adored this! I kicked the spice up a notch by seasoning my chicken breasts with a generous supply of cumin, chili pepper, and a few drops of Texas Pete....then wrapped them in foil and baked for 60 minutes at 350. Then proceeded with the cheese/avo/tomato stack and broiled until bubbly. Delish!

YUMMY! I took a few of the reviews, and marinated it in lemon(didn't have lime), oil, cilantro, and 3 tablespoons of salt(brine) for about 2 hours. Then browned(not cooked) it(not adding oil) with a slice of bacon for each breast. Once browned, placed in a baking dish, topping with the bacon, tomato, and cheese....covered then baked for 20 minutes. The chicken breast was juicy, and had tons of flavor.

I made a marinade out of lime juice, cilantro, olive oil and some chili powder as someone else suggested and then we cooked it on the grill. It was super tasty-made cilantro lime rice(had a lot of limes around) and black beans to go with it, great meal!

Marinated in olive oil, minced garlic and lemon juice. Saute chicken in marinate. Chopped tomato and avocado instead of topping as slices

This was good.  I did make a couple of changes just based on preference.  I marinated the chicken in olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic and rosemary for a while.  I omitted the onion powder since we don't like onion.

This was very good a keeper. Used the lime, olive oil and ciilatro marinade as someone else suggested I let it marinade about 4 hours but could have done it longer maybe overnight and all day. cooked it on the grill for 35 minutes and topped it with cilantro, tomato then 2 slices of cheese. Then after taking off the grill right before eating added black olives and avacado

Added some garlic and onion powder to the chicken. I definitely add tomatoes, bacon, avocado and either monterey jack or mozzarella cheese.

This was simple and delicious!  Marinated the chicken as others suggested in lime, olive oil, and garlic. Did not come out dry at all!  Maybe I'll add cilantro next time.  Do not skip the avocado!  This would also make a delicous chicken sandwich!  Husband and 6yo son approved. Will make again!

Oh my goodness, this recipe is so simple and so good that I've already made it twice this week. I subbed the chicken breast for the meatless kind and used mozzarella cheese because that's what I had on hand. The second time I made it, I added a light layer of hot sauce beneath the tomato for some extra zip. A new favourite!

Awesome.  Another add-on is to top it all off with a bit of hollandaise sauce.  I had a friend who used to do that and it was amazing.

This is a really good recipe.  However, it is SO much better if you marinate the chicken in lime/cilantro/garlic first.

Five stars hands down! I marinated the chicken in the cilantro, minced garlic, lime juice, olive oil and sliced up some onions.  Then I sauteed the everything but the chicken, but the mixture into a glass baking dish, seared the chicken and threw it on top of the onions/sauce mixture. I didn't have the cheese it called for so I used cheddar.  Layered thinly sliced tomatoes & cheese, baked for 15 minutes and then threw chopped up avocado on top.  I mixed the chopped avocado in lime juice to keep it from oxidizing, or whatever it is called when it turns brown. My husband and son loved it and we will eat it again.

LOVED IT! Even my son who hates cooked tomato loved it.  I had to use shredded Montery Jack cheese which worked out just as well.  Next time I think I'll try marinating the chicken but it was great just as it was.

I've made this multiple times, and my latest made me remember why I love this dish so much. Instead of cooking in a skillet, I grilled the chicken. Also, instead of monterey jack, I used scamorza, and I used piccadilly tomato slices. Also, instead of cutting the avocado slices length wise to keep uniformity, I opted for smaller slices and cut through the width. Using the smaller tomatoes and having smaller bits of avocado let you get everything in each bite. I still have yet to add bacon to the recipe, which would instantly make this god-like.

This recipe was very easy to prepare but lacked a little in flavor, however,  I loved the avocado and tomato topping on top of the chicken. I made this recipe exactly as written except I diced up my tomatoes instead of leaving them while. I also cooked the chicken in a cast iron skillet instead of using a skillet and baking dish to make clean up easier.

I changed up the seasoning to suit our tastes, and only used one avocado, since there really wasn't "room" for both on top of 4 chicken breasts. I cooked my chicken on the stove in my cast iron skillet, and then just left them in there, topped them with the tomatoes and cheese, and put in the oven that way. Less steps and easier clean up than transferring them to a cookie sheet.

We enjoyed this recipe with a few modifications.  I marinated chicken cutlets in lemon juice, garlic, olive oil & salt & Pepper.  Then I used my favorite grill pan to grill the chicken and also flash grilled the tomatoes.  I stacked the chicken in the grill pan and put the pan in the oven until the cheese melted.  It was juicy & delicious, but because of the modifications I didn't think I could give the recipe as it stands 5 stars.  I may experiment with cheeses as I would like a bit more flavor.  Maybe goat cheese?

Wow! This is one of the best chicken recipes I've ever had. I did make two changes to this recipe that added a ton of flavor. I basted the chicken with lime juice before I cooked it. I also added fresh basil on top of the completed chicken when done. Super yummy recipe that I would highly recommend!

Really good. Quick and easy. Great base recipe. Also tasty as is. Lots of ways to be innovative from this base. I took the suggestions to marinate in lemon juice etc. and also added bacon, as was suggested. Family really liked it and the leftovers made great chicken sandwiches.

This was a really good recipe.  My boyfriend loved it as he does not usually enjoy chicken breast because it is too dry for him.  He loved it!!!  Will def make again!

Delicious and easy to prepare. I added a little bit of cajun spice mix to the chicken before I browned them and it added just a perfect spicy flavour that was complimented by the vegetables and cheese. Huge hit.

Super easy, tasty recipe. I marinated the chicken in olive oil, lime juice, onion powder adding garlic, cayenne, oregano, parsley and paprika for flavor, otherwise it would've been too bland for me (I'm Jamaican). I sauteed the chicken in the marinade instead of adding more oil. Sprinkle some cilantro on top and served over cilantro lime rice. Yummy. Clean up was easy, too. Perfect weeknight meal.

Loved it! I love avocado and this was an awesome way to change up chicken. I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing for about an hour before hand. My husband isn't an avocado fan, so I put some bacon on his instead. He enjoyed that equally well. I didn't bother putting it in the oven, just assembled and covered the pan for a few minutes to let the cheese melt. Turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out great.  I used about a tbsp of onion powder.  This would also be great on the grill or with basil mozzerella and tomatoes.

So delicious and so easy to prepare! This is my first review on allrecipes.com. The chicken came out so moist (it was not fully cooked through while on the pan) and I've opted for Emmental cheese since I haven't found any Monterey Jack after moving to Sweden. So healthy and so delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

If you are using large/thick chicken breasts then you may have to filet them so they cook all the way through.  Other than that, it was very good.

very good taste. Somehow I wanted to add garlic but didn't and glad too. I love fresh avacado, so the taste went well with the chicken, tomato and monterey jack cheese. Thanks for posting, My husband loved it

Good basis for a great recipe. I marinated the chicken breasts in lime juice, a little soy sauce and some ginger before grilling. The grill and marinade makes it taste wonderful. Its also good served with fresh pea pods and a light pasta salad

This was very good. I didn't have a tomato so I just had the cheese and avacado, and it was still wonderful. I did it a little differently: I used fat free Swiss cheese, and I marinated the chicken in olive oil, crushed garlic, lemons, and lemon pepper seasoning for about 4 hours . Very healthy and very tasty! Can't wait to try it with tomatoes!

Very quick, easy, and a true husband pleaser!! I also used the canned tomatoes and had pleanty of sauce. I  used thin spaghetti as I didn't have any angel hair, and parmesan instead of feta. Also made my own blackened seasoning and used 1 1/2 Tbs. Just the
right amount of spice for us.

I made this recipe without changing anything.  I believe you have to do that to right an honest review.  The technique is good and I will use it again.  However, the chicken has no flavor to it, just the veggies.  This has the potential for being a very good recipe with tweeks to the ingredients.  I do love the technique.

I'd give this 5 stars but it's not quite fancy enough for all 5.  As far as taste and presentation, it's absolutely a 5 at the weekday dinner table.  I  made it without the cheese and still it was delicious.

The only reason I couldn't give this five stars is because the chicken was bland.  I agree with the other comments, marinate the chicken first and you'd have a five star recipe for sure! It was a hit, even with my picky 10 year old son!

This is one of those all-round good recipes that holds up well to substitutions. You could even make this as a sandwich! I subbed gouda slices for the monterey jack and jazzed up my tomatoes by broiling them with a little parmesan cheese and Italian dressing before topping the chicken with them. I also sprinkled a few bacon bits on for good measure. I assembled the finished pieces atop a bed of raw spinach, added a few sliced strawberries, a drizzle of Italian dressing, and it was so good! Definitely on the make-again list!

This was a great recipe and easy to make.  I of course had to make it a little harder, knowing that my family likes spicy food.  I dredged the chicken breasts in a mixture of panko crumbs, taco seasoning mix, cumin, garlic and dried cilantro, then browned it and followed rest of recipe.  The avocado was wonderful when put with it.

I used Havarti because i didn't have Monterey Jack. It added a very nice flavour. I read a lot of people marinated their chicken, all i did was add a little seasoning that I like.
It was fantastic, the avocado was the perfect touch. thank you, this will be made again... and again

I only gave it 4 stars because I feel the marinade that other reviewers have recommended is really important -- it gives the chicken itself some flavor, rather than just relying on the toppings. I made a mistake by serving this chicken with another recipe from this site that we love, Quinoa and Black Beans. I thought the flavors would complement one another, but as it turned out, the quinoa's flavor (has a good dose of cumin and cayenne) was too strong for the milder chicken. Next time, I'd serve it with fresh sweet corn and maybe a cucumber salad.

I love this recipe! Its one of those recipes that I always have the ingredients for, so I make it quite often, each time a little different. I sometimes add cayenne pepper or marinade it with lime juice, and I use a different cheese just about every time (Swiss is excellent with this). The best tip I can give is instead of slicing the cheese, tomato, and avocado, dice it and make a salsa out of it (it makes it easy to eat). I find that people shy away from the avocado or the tomato and eat around it, which is a mistake because these ingredients compliment each other so well, dicing everything makes it harder for people to "skip" on something. Be creative and play with different flavor combos, cooking should be fun not a step by step procedure.

YUM!!! I added some pesto to the chicken before topping with the tomato, and used shredded cheese as that was what I had.

This dish was okay. I used some friends as guinea pigs for dinner one evening and it turned out too dry. It could be my oven, but I doubt it. It wasn't a bad dish but I won't be cooking it again... :(

Yummy!!  We didn't marinate the chicken.   I guess we just followed the recipe word for word and it was delicious!  This will definitely be something we make again.

Ok I totally modified this.. I marinated my chicken in Pineapple, and Terriaki , over night, added minced garlic, let it sit.. Then tossed in on the grill, I used jalepeno jack cheese, garnished with cold pineapple chuncks, avacado.. as pictured, with a quick dash of worstesher sauce, and a dipping cup put in fresh ranch dressing.. AMAZING!

Loved This !  2 hrs before cooking marinate chicken  with EVOO, garlic, lemon juice, S&P. Grill Chicken on grill pan for 1-2 minute per side (do not fully cook through).
Then proceed to top with ingredients and bake until cheese melts.  (Cooking time varies with thickness but make sure not to over cook the chicken)

Great recipe! I think next time though, I'm going to use a different cheese. The Monterey Jack was a little too subtle for my tastbuds. I need something like pepper jack to give it a little kick.

This dish tastes so fresh and yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing (except next time I will just cook the chicken on the Foreman grill to up the healthy factor then follow the recipe from there).

Amazing!!!!!!!  I used cheddar cheese because I didn't have any montery Jack, but I thought that it added a lot to the flavor just the same. I also added a little garlic powder while cooking the chicken. Other than that I followed the recipe the way that it was written and it was excellent.  the avocado made this meal a five star for me.  This meal would be great as a wrap or even a sandwich.  I will make this over and over again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Marinated chicken all night in seasoning and vinegar then followed recipe as written. the only difference was I used lemon pepper seasoning with a little bit of garlic and  Herbs of Provence. Served with couscous and salad. Boyfriend took one bite, got up and walked over to me and kissed me....he gave it more than 5 stars... :)

Having read the other reviews, we cooked the chicken the way we normally would spice-wise, then just followed with the tomato, cheese and avocado.  Not sure what it is about those three, but the flavors really do blend together well.  Definitely will repeat often, or as long as I can get ripe avocados! Very very easy.

I rated this 4 stars because of the beautiful presentation, ease to prepare and the taste.  I marinated for a few hours in a cilantro based sauce (love cilantro!!)  I added much more garlic, salt and pepper than was called for just because we like our food well seasoned.  Great little dish and it really does look pretty.  Served over our favorite white rice.

Fast and easy! I was going to just put my skillet in the oven instead of dirtying up a cookie sheet but the breasts were thick so I covered the pan to speed them up after browning. It occured to me that I didn't need the oven but just put the cheese on and covered it back up while I plated mashed potatoes and veg. It worked great and coated the chicken nicely. The cheese pooled in the skillet I drizzled over the potatoes. I forgot to put the tomatoes on so they went on cold with the avocado. I had drizzled the avocado with a little lemon juice to keep it from turning brown while I made the chicken and that added a nice tang too.

This recipe is great and very easy!  We made a marinade with lime juice, cilantro, pepper, and olive oil as suggested by other users.  We baked the chicken with pepperjack cheese on top of the sliced tomato.  We topped the dish with avacado and green onions.  Yum!!

This was very good. My husband couldn't stop raving about it. We used munster cheese instead of Monterey Jack.  Also, like other posters, I thought this needed bacon. If I make this again, I'll definitely add some.

Marinated first, in the Mojito Grilling Marinade.  Not sure why the photo and some comments show apples.

This chicken is so wonderful! it is light and flavorful and seems really healthy! i didn't add cheese, some of the family can't have cheese, but it was so great still! i also marinaded the chicken. my marinade(white wine, olive oil, garlic powder, and cilantro.) it was so easy and super tasty. you need to try this, you will love it!

Good dish, very clean tasting, surprising good flavors.  I marinated in eeoo, lime juice and garlic salt and browned the chicken filets in the marinade... would be better to put cooked bacon on the chicken before cheese to add super flavor... that would make this a 5 star.

Followed recipe - would have been more flavorful if I had marinated the chicken. Otherwise it was ok but noting to write home about.

My family thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I used cherry tomatoes which seem to sit on the breasts easier. So easy to make as well!

I marinated the chicken in lemon juice, olive oil & various seasonings. Instead of Monterey Jack, I used Muenster. Instead of tomatoes, I used Granny Smith Apples. I also added a few bacon slices on top. A little messy to eat, but everything tasted so delicious together! The apples added a tart, refreshing contrast to all the other flavors and went great with the cheese. If I had cheddar on hand, I would have used that. Yum!

From a fellow Ingrid, great recipe! I'm a vegetarian, so I subbed some tofu with a chili-lime marinade for the chicken, but the topping is terrific!

My husband made this recipe one evening. The presentation was very nice with the tomato and avacado toppings. He had extra tomato slices left over and roasted them with slices of cheese on top. They made for a yummy appetizer.

I took some of the tips from others and marinated the chicken in a lime, olive oil, garlic & cilantro marinade. The chicken was then grilled with the onion powder & season salt. I added both olives and green chiles to the tomato and cheese topping before baking. We put the chicken over rice and I agree with one of the others that making the cheese into a sauce would make it even better. Great flavors...but I'm afraid that if made exactly as written it might be a bit bland.

Love it! The flavors go really good together. I have also made it by marinating it in lime juice/cilantro/olive oil and it was great that way too.

Very good.  The trick is having enough avocado & tomato for every bite.  I sliced up extra to eat with it and it was quite good.

We really enjoyed this!  I used a shredded colby/jack mixture for the cheese and instead of avocado slices I made some guacomole.  It really gave it a nice kick.  I also served it with sour cream and olives.  Great meal with great flavors.

Loved it! Had nothing left, my husband ate it all!! I followed the tips of the other useres and Marinated the chicken in lime juice. Seasoned it with salt, pepper and fajita seasoning. Used pico de gallo for the tomato top and loaded on the cheese.  Served with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.. MMM MMM... sure to be a crowd pleaser..

Though this wasn't terrible, I wasn't impressed.  There wasn't any flavor in this much, and I even tried to use Adobo to kick things up as bit.  It didn
t help.  I'd call this just OK.  My hubby and I LOVE avocados, and this recipe just didn't do them justice.  That and there's nothing to make the tomato stick to the chicken, so I'd advise putting the cheese on the chicken and then on the tomato unless you like messy eating.

Fast, simple and good! While not particularly exciting, it is a good starter recipe for adapting to your kitchen. Also great because most ingredients are on hand, except for avacados. I didn't use them, but used fried onions on top of chicken & baked as stated. Great!

This was tasty, but I think I would have liked it much better if I had used chicken breasts as the recipe indicated, rather than the chicken thigh meat I had on hand. My favorite part was definitely the avocado and tomato and cheese. I used reduced fat jalapeno cheddar, and layered the cheese on top of the chicken, and between each slice of tomato.

Very easy and tasty.  I marinated the chicken in lemon juice, olive oil, onion powder, a bit of garlic, and cilantro.  I also didn't put the tomato in the oven, I prefer the contrast of cool tomato on top of the warm chicken and cheese.  I'll definitely make it again.

This chicken was so wonderful! Its the best chicken my friends and I have EVER had! The recipe calls for a few too many avocados, tomatoes, and cheese however. With all thse leftovers you can chop them up and add them together along with some basil and a little red onion topped with lime juice and serve on the side. DELICIOUS! 

love always,

Very tasty!  I followed other reviews and marinated the chicken in olive oil and lemon juice (I was out of lime).  I added some minced garlic and onions to the marinade and cooked the chicken in the marinade.  I topped the chicken with some diced green chili under the tomato and substituted a mexican blend of shredded cheese for the monterey jack.  This will definitely be added to my list of favorite recipes!

This was so absolutely delicious!!!  I couldn't believe how good it was.  It looked like it belonged in a restaurant and tasted like it Too!
Everything was great, I wouldn't change a thing and I will definetly be making this again -- probably for company.  It would make a great dinner party dish!  Thanks for sharing -- THIS IS A KEEPER!

Great starting point.  I added whole canned green chile, used pepper jack cheese, and added bacon.  Next time will also try with finely diced onion and finely diced olives.

Very good!  Especially with fresh
veggies.  For a little extra kick
we added some lime juice and cilantro
before baking.

I marinaded the chicken in a mixture of olive oil, lime juice, and garlic.  I cut the chicken in to bite size pieces and cooked everything on the stove top.  I added black olives.  Cooking it this way created a sauce which would be good over rice.

I absolutely loved this recipe.It was a big hit.The only thing I would do different next time is try putting it into a baking dish because when I went to take it out the oven the cheese and tomato had slid off onto cookie sheet.I just took a spatula and stuck it back on top.Delicious I will be making it again!

Good dish. I prepared it the way the recipe said to. Next time I may add some type of sauce to the chicken before I top it with the other ingredients.

This dish was only meh.  I even added 1/2 diced Serrano pepper w/ seeds and 1/4 diced red onion while sautéing the chicken to spice it up a bit, but still the dish was only ok.  Not bad, mind you, as everyone at ate their portions, but I will not make this again.

Hahahaha!!! Wow. This recipe is a throw back from the 80’s !  It was so innovative back then with the avocado/tomato combo.   All the So Ca restaurants were serving it as “Cali Cuisine “!

Marinated as other reviewers suggested.  I had very thick chicken breasts, I should have sliced them in half length wise.  The dish would have cooked faster.   I used a grill pan, and popped it in the oven, no need for a baking sheet.   Also, cut back on the cheese.  1 slice was enough in my opinion.   .  We liked it and will make again

Pretty easy and the family loved it! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs which take a little less time to cook (about 5-6 minutes each side and 7 minutes in the oven).

This was amazing!  I highly recommend. The only change I made was adding 2 strips of precooked bacon before baking in the oven. This recipe is very worthy of a five star rating. Yum!!!

Very tasty. I took the advice from previous reviews and marinated the chicken in lime juice, olive oil, garlic and seasonings.  Only thing I would have don't differently is I would have pounded the chicken breasts so they weren't so thick

We LOVE this dish! I substitute the cheese with provolone and use FlavorGod Garlic Seasoning. It is a staple in our household and a go-to weeknight dish. Super simple and super quick, full of flavor!!!

I loved this, but I'm not giving 5 stars because I made a few changes that I think the chicken would have been bland without. I seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt, pepper, and onion powder and then marinated it for about an hour in olive oil, lemon juice (lime would probably be even better), and minced garlic.  The chicken came out so tender, juicy, and delicious!

Delicious! Very moist. I would recommend butterflying the chicken first to make it cool more quickly. Very easy and amazingly tasty for the amount of effort.

This one is a keeper! I also marinated the chicken in lime juice and cilantro for 2-3 hours. Then I pretty much followed the recipe as is. I served it with a half piece of corn on the cob and a small spinach salad with fat free vidalia onion/summer tomato dressing. An interesting way to use veggies fresh from the farm stand for a delicious summer dinner!

This was pretty good, but probably would not make it again. It was easy, but cook time was way off  for me, but maybe that was because it did did not specify what temp to heat the pan at.

We loved it!  I marinated as suggested by others, then sauteed a sliced, sweet onion in the pan before adding the chicken.  After it baked, I added the avocado diced and soaked in lime juice.  It was all eaten!  Went very nicely with grilled asparagus.

This recipe was fantastic and so easy to prepare! I followed the advice of others and marinated the chicken breast in a cilantro-lime mixture I made myself. The chicken was juicy and quite yummy :) I will be adding this to my recipe box!

I made this for my family. My daughter who claims to not like avocado ate this and love it. I served it over a salad and it tasted great! It is so healthy and easy to make! Thank you so much!

6-15-11:  Had an excellent taste but next time cut the chicken pieces longitudinally so that they're less than 1/2nch thick, then just one thick tomato slice each.

This was really awesome! Some changes I made: I marinated the chicken in kraft signature italian tuscan (extra virgin olive oil) dressing, added garlic powder instead of onion, and fresh chopped coriander. YUM!

Instead of Monterey Jack cheese I used Gruyere because I had some left over from another recipe.  Perhaps the Monterey Jack would have been a better choice for this.  The chicken was very juicy and tender, but I thought the flavor was lacking something.  My husband loved it, though.

Delicious. Like others, I made a few modifications, including simmering in 505 green chili sauce for about 20 minutes and throwing in some orange pepper slices. Then topped with Jack cheese and avocado. Muy delicioso!

I'm giving this four star because the recipe was great in theory and very pretty, but needed something.  We too decided to marinade the chicken in lime juice, garlic, olive oil and S&P.  I think next time, I'd skip the cheese, make a cream cheese guac and wait until the end to top with tomatoes.  Also, would marinate the chicken for longer.  Really great idea though.  This recipe I think can have potential to be Great with some tweaks.

Interesting recipe, but I found it to be a bit bland, chicken also got rubbery from being sauteed and then baked. Easy to make though.

I marinated mine in a cuban garlic and lime marinade then grilled it on "the george" to reduce the "bad" fat in it. Used lower fat cheese. We all liked it. Will make again, probably marinading in lime and cilantro marinade next time!

I slathered the chicken breasts in olive oil then dusted with onion powder, salt and pepper and left overnight in the fridge.  When ready to cook I put them on the grill (no added oil or seasonings) and they were seasoned perfectly!  Tried sliced tomatoes and diced; found the breast with the diced tomatoes easier to eat.  But delicious either way.

This was a great recipe.  Made just as recipe specified, but added bacon bits to the cheese before topping with avocado.  Hubby is not a big chicken fan, but said that it was something different and didn't hear a word else out of him at the table until his plate was clean.  For sides, I had black beans and a side salad, he had corn on the cob, since he doesn't like black beans.

We enjoy many of the Recipes and always the reviews that go with them. But this recipe for California Chicken was SO good I just had to write. Following the advice of several reviewers, I marinated the breasts. My favorite marinade for any dense white meat is  Goya's MoJo Criolio marinade for chicken, pork & beef. But instead of the sliced tomato, I used ChiChi's Mild Salsa and sprinkled that, during the last  15 minutes of baking with Hormel's Bacon Bits. We skipped the avocado but it's easy enough to add for those who fancy them. Thanks Ingrid for a GREAT recipe.

Yum!!!  Definitely marinate the chicken, overnite if possible, like the first reviewer suggested.  And when you put chicken on the cookie sheet, cover each piece with more cilantro before topping with tomato and cheese.  The avocado is the best!!

We needed more flavor - recommend marinating as some previous reviewers did, or adding more seasoning to chicken.  We did really like the fresh avocado on top.

Grilled the chicken first with the onion powder.  Did not add the salt and pepper, but I think it needed it.  Next time, either marinate or add more seasoning.  Overall, it was good.  Would be better as a chicken sandwich.

This looked beautiful and was good but nothing too special. I used garlic salt instead of onion powder because I didn't have any.

Mostly good, but I always make chicken too dry.  Loved the veggies on top.  It was even good with cheddar cheese!

Very good!  I used fresh chopped onions and some garlic powder while saute-ing my chicken.  Very nice dinner with roasted carrots and squash.

We found it to be fairly bland as well as clunky to eat. Very colorful, though.

it was ok, first bite very good, but lost its appeal by the end of the meal, more spice is needed somewhere

AMAZING!  I sauteed in olive oil as suggested, but I also added lemon juice for some more flavor!  I had to use Monterey Pepper Jack cheese, witch I was dissapointed about, but ended up LOVING it!  The tomato added SOOOO much flavor and avacado's are alwasy yummy!  This will definately become a favorite!

This is delicious!  The chicken comes out juicy every time and my family loves the cheese/tomato/avocado combo.  And it's so easy to make, a definite winner where I'm concerned!

Not great.  Presentation was nice, but the avacado had the most flavor out of anything on the plate.  I even sauteed the chicken with a diced onion.  No thanks.

Very good!  I marinated the chicken in a lime/garlic/olive oil mixture and used American cheese (which is all I had).  Tasted great, company was impressed!  Served with a little bit of salsa for an extra kick.

Tasty, but could definitely use some improvements.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and marinated the chicken first (using the lemon/lime marinade from the "Chicken Tacos" recipe on this site).  I also prefer smaller chunks of chicken, so next time I might consider turning it into a more casserole-y dish.
