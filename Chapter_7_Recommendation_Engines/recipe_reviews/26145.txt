I found it! This is the recipe my mother used during WWII to send to my uncle overseas.  The secret is no shortening!  They stay fresh for a long time if wraped well with no rancid flavor from fat!

Very good. They taste a bit like fruit cake. I would prefer to make as a drop cookie because they tend to stick in the pan. Would consider making them again if my coworkers and family like them! (taking them to work tomorrow)
