I've been making this all week in individual portions.  Just eyeballing all ingredients- typically half an avocado (a little mashed), red onion as that is what I have, splash of rice vinegar (plain, again- what I have).  I had to sub zucchini for the cucumber when I ran out, also tried basil in place of cilantro when I ran out, and added a splash of lime juice.  I mix it all up and then put it on top of a plate of spinach leaves (even better to put in a bowl with tight lid and shake).  Easy, healthy and delicious.  I can't stop making it!!

It would be nigh on impossible not to love this salad--not with these ingredients!  I cut it to 2 servings, and because I didn't have seasoned rice vinegar I made my own (1 tablespoon rice vinegar with 1/2-3/4 teaspoon sugar and 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt).  I didn't need to add any extra salt, and the tomatoes I had weren't cherry tomatoes but rather the slightly larger pearl tomatoes.  Excellent!  Thanks, Kristen!  My lunch was delicious!

8-1-2016  ~This salad sounded awesome good to me and in spite of the fact I didn’t think Hubs would go for it I was hell bent on making it anyway.  And what a hit it was, with both of us! Creamy, crunchy, fresh and juicy all at the same time - and so full of flavor!  I have to admit tho,’ it’s the bacon that is indispensable to take it over the top! Just a great recipe – haven’t enjoyed a new salad recipe this much in a long time.

Looking for something to make with the 4 avocados lingering on the counter before they passed their prime and came across this recipe.  I thought to myself, what's not to love; bacon, avocado, tomato, cilantro, and green onion.  All ingredients I love...  and boy was it ever so good together.  In fact, the hubster kept sneaking bites as I was pulling it together as he just couldn't wait.  And neither could I; we finished it together while the steaks were grilling.  Thanks for sharing this delight Kristin as it's found a permanent home in my recipe collection.

I could probably eat this everyday. Have made this a handful of times and I make it as directed, but I have substituted apple cider & balsamic vinegar combo as well, as well as substituted red onion when I was out of green onion. Very light, yet super filling. Tastes great freshly made AND just as good after it has sat. Anyway as u make it...u cannot make this wrong.

I loved the light dressing - just rice vinegar, salt & pepper!  The changes I made were from necessity or convenience.  I was only preparing for two so I used only one avocado but only halved the other ingredients.  I had leftover undressed salad from last evening's dinner which I used instead of plain lettuce so there were a few more vegetables in the salad - peppers, radish.  And, finally, because this was the meal, I topped each serving with a sliced hard boiled egg and added a slice of garlic bread.  I will make this again, and probably without the changes next time - either way is just fine, I am sure!

This was so good!  It was the hit of the party.  I followed the recipe exactly, did not add or change anything.  I served this on top of spring mix green salad. Everybody loved it.  One guest then put it on her hamburger and the rest of us followed suit.  Delicious!  I will definitely be making this many more times.

I am on a pretty strict paleo / whole 30 diet due to gluten and dairy allergies. Its not often I find a recipe that is pure paleo and doesn't need a lot of changes. This was awesome as is! I agree adding a little chicken makes it more filling. Great for lunch or dinner, Thanks

10 star recipe. Followed to the letter - only difference was I used balsamic vinegar instead of rice vinegar. Husband devoured it and so did I! Cilantro gave it a wonderfully fresh kick.

This is sooo good!! I made one small change...I found I was out of the rice vinegar and used apple cider vinegar instead. Absolutely delicious! I  have made it several times and served it with several types of meals and got rave reviews each time. My guests always want the recipe.

I love this salad! My only change was I added a romaine heart to the salad because I was only able to use half an avocado because my avocados were still not ripe. I love the light taste of the rice vinegar dressing paired with all the tastes in the salad.

I used Sweet Rice Wine, in place of vinegar. It has a balsamic vinaigrette taste to it. OMG, it was fabulous!

This is a great KETO recipe.   I would leave out tomatos, to much starch and replace it with something else.  Also rice vinegar replace with apple cider vinegar.

If you like avocados, then you must give this a try.  It's really good.  Made it exactly to recipe which is unusual for me as I like to change things a bit to my own taste...but...this was perfect as written!

This was a very nice salad, the bacon made the flavor really pop.  I created seasoned rice vinegar as others did with salt and sugar.  Used sweet onion because I didn't have the other type and large diced a tomato in place of the cherry tomatoes.  Made 1/2 of the recipe for 2 and had enough left over for the next day for lunch.  I would make this tasty, healthy salad again.  My husband really liked it...so, it's a keeper.

My new favorite salad! Creamy and crunchy textures. did not add cilantro to my husbands portion as he is not a fan and he loved it. I love everything about this salad.Served on a bed of greens. Maybe next time will add hard boiled egg. Will definitely be making again.

Great salad!!!  Disappeared quickly when I served it to guests.  I added the bacon right before serving so it would stay crisp and the contrasting texture was good.

Made it just as the recipe says and it was wonderful. I even topped a nice juicy hamburger with it in lieu of lettuce, tomato, onion and condiments, and It added another dimension to the burger, a total blend.

DELICIOUS!  I halved the cilantro, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  We had it by itself, with tortilla chips as a dip, on toast the next morning and with some cubed chicken for lunch the next day.  ALL WAYS WERE AMAZING!  Definitely making this over and over again.

We loved this salad! I made it exact to the recipe. Very refreshing summer salad, but you have to like cilantro to really enjoy it.  Save the bacon to top last or it will become soggy!

This is an excellent summer (or anytime) salad or entrée.  If you don't have seasoned rice vinegar, look up a recipe to make your own with regular rice vinegar.  Seasoned mostly has sugar and salt added, but it cuts the sour taste of the vinegar and makes your salad a little sweeter.  Love this recipe!

This salad was delicious, I didn’t have rice vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar. It was delicious.  I took the rest for lunch next day.

I made this for a party and it was met with rave reviews! I did change it a bit based on what I had. I used a red pepper, 2 celery stalks, 2 avocados, and some English cucumber. I also do not like cilantro so I used basil per someone else’s recommendations and it was fantastic! This will be a regular staple at my house from here on out. Thank you for this deliciousness!

I’ve taken to keeping these ingredients on hand for hot summer days. So easy to make into an entree salad. Except for cooking bacon there’s no heat in the kitchen needed. We visited an Asian market this weekend and I found sesame seeds that are already roasted. They put this salad over the top.  It doesn’t call for salt so I just scatter a fancy salt flake over top of each plate of salad. Definitely a keeper recipe!

I will make this salad again, but I won't chop the cucumber. I'll slice it thickly.  And I will give the cucumber time to get rid of some of it's water.  you can't let this salad sit  as you prepare the rest of meal.  Gets too watery. Next time I will get the ingredients together and right be we sit down I will add the mixture to the salad greens.  And maybe a little less bacon.

Really good. Already gave recipe to a friend who loves avocado's. We did take others suggestion & used balsamic dressing because we didn't think we'd like the seasoned rice vinegar. We're also going to use this in wraps with & without cooked chicken.

Made as directed except for cilantro (I'm a hater). So very good and a light alternative for any meal. With all those mostly wholesome ingredients, I can have dessert with a clear conscience.

This would make a great summer salad.  Super easy and delicious.  The only thing that needs to be cooked is the bacon so no hot oven!  I am a vegetarian so I used veggie bacon and used chipotle olive oil and balsamic vinegar instead of the rice vinegar.  The bacon is a nice flavor and texture to the veggies!!

Except for adding cilantro (which husband hates), I made the recipe exactly as written.  My husband went back for 2 more helpings after his first one and Son gave himself a huge portion as well!  I'm keeping this recipe for sure.  It would be great to take to a potluck gathering or serve to guests at home.  It's also a low-carb option for those who watch carbs.  So yummy!

We did not like the rice vinegar.  Perhaps with a different dressing it be much more palatable.  Loved the combination of vegetables though.

Salads do not get a four star, but this one did. I want the stars to attract your attention to rice vinegar.   I’m now using it for other dishes. Such as, Italian dressing with Thime, crushed red pepper,  a soak of jaopeno

My husband and I are on a low carb diet and this seemed like a good option to bring to a family cookout to be sure we had something to eat. I subbed apple cider vinegar for the rice wine vinegar to save on carbs. I also didn't use cilantro since a couple family members have a strong dislike for it . It was a hit. I'll definitely make it again but will add the cilantro next time because I think that will make it even better.

This is so good.  Think of an extra delicious BLT sandwich and add the avocado!!! Yum!!  I followed the recipe exactly and used the rice vinegar.  After the initial taste, we added some chicken.  That, combined with the French bread made a meal on a hot evening.  I've made it twice more since then.

I followed the recipe except for the seasoned rice vinegar.  I made my own with rice vinegar, a dash of sugar and a dash of salt.  I also added a splash of lime juice to keep the avocados from turning brown.  This is an excellent recipe thanks for sharing!!

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this salad!  I have made it a couple of times.  I only had regular rice vinegar, so I added a little sugar, salt, and soy sauce (to taste) and it turned out PERFECT!   I will definitely make it again, and again!

Huge favorite of my big, extended family.  I was told to definitely keep this recipe & add to the top of the list for our frequent family functions.  Excellent for my gluten and dairy intolerant family members as an added plus.  But, all others loved it too.  HOME RUN FOR SURE!!!

Wife and i loved it, only change is i substituted the seasons with parsley and instead of rice oil i used apple cider vinegar.
Only Con : salad does ot last very well, avocados turned brown and wiltered while the rest stayed fresh and good.
But overall i will make again.
And recommend for others.

I loved this recipe! It was so delicious! I made one change. I found a no carb no sugar version of Nakano Rice Wine Vinegar. It’s called Nakano Natural Rice Wine Vinegar. It did not affect the taste but to use the original version I had already purchased I used 1 TBSP of regular & added 1 to 1/2 of Natural Rice Wine Vinegar to it. This absolutely one of the best salads I’ve ever had. I’ve made it at least 3 times so far & will make it again soon. Thanks for a great low carb recipe! Keep em coming!

The rice vinegar was a little overwhelming. I think if less was used it would have been fine, or perhaps lemon juice which I'm going to try next time. Also, 4 avocados would have been sufficient; 5 was overdoing I thought. Regardless, my family liked this salad and I will definitely make it again.

Can't go wrong with bacon and avocado! I left out the cucumbers (don't like) and was going to add some zucchini, but tasted good as it was. After having it would be good to have a little crunch?  My taco chip took care of that!!!

Delish.  I didn't have rice vinegar and used balsamic vinegar.  If anything, I'd use less avocado and more tomatoes and cucumbers.

too much bacon lol; but the rest was good.  Added a bit more vinegar to recipe to keep avocados from turning brown.  I would omit the cilantro as it tended to dominate.

It was a family pleaser on a warm summer evening.  Was out of rice vinegar so I used white wine vinegar and added a teaspoon of EVOO to the dressing.  Still delicious.

We left the cilantro out, and used a favorite seasoning salt in the dressing.  Very good! Nice in the summer... could even leave the bacon out for more of a side dish...(did I just say that?)

I followed the recipe to a T.  It is very light and refreshing...took it to a picnic to share at church today.  The recipe says it makes 5 servings, probably because there are 5 avocados but I would say that if this is used as a side dish you could plan to get 8-10 servings out of the dish.

This is soooo good!!  One of our favorites.  I add it to spinach and make it exactly as in recipe, except add extra rice vinegar.   Sometimes I add hard boiled eggs to make it more filling.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Very good salad! Fresh and everything you want to accompany avocados. I made the recipe exactly but i did add a few extra splashes of the seasoned rice wine vinegar to my helping.

Great low carb salad those of us who have to watch our sugar intake. I used regular rice vinegar instead of seasoned.

We made this salad as directed and it was delicious. We loved it on a bed of greens and as a stand alone side. The simple "dressing" of seasoned rice vinegar is perfect.  We will definitely have it again and will try making it with "fake bacon" for our vegetarian daughter.

This is delicious! I don't like cilantro, so I used fresh basil. I just eyeballed ingredients. Ended up using 3 avocados, half a cucumber and half a pint of grape tomatoes. I didn't feel like cooking bacon, so I tossed in some bacon bits (about a tablespoon). It was delicious with just the rice vinegar (I didn't have seasoned vinegar). It was so tasty I didn't even put it over lettuce!

Made this for a Fourth of July picnic exactly to the recipe. Delicious! I learned a trick how to get my avocados to ripen more quickly. Wrap them in foil and put them in a 200 oven for 10 to 20 minutes. It worked well and they were ripe enough to be tasty but firm enough to hold their shape in the salad. I used a high-quality, thick bacon with a nice smoky flavor which worked very well.

Followed the recipe without making any changes other than I halved the recipes for two. I thought it was rather bland as did my hubby. Not sure how I would spice it up.

I made this dish exactly as the recipe ordered. It was perfect. A light summer dish for those "too hot to eat" nights. But I couldn't resist the urge to add just a little diced fresh mozzarella. It worked :). Thank you!

I have a grandson who is picky about vegetables, but happens to like avocados and cucumber, and LOVES bacon.  The whole family flipped over this salad.  I left out the tomatoes because several family members won't eat them and it was great.  I think it would be even better with the tomatoes.  My only complaint is that it doesn't hold over very well to the next day, so don't plan on leftovers.

I made this recipe exactly and it was a huge hit with my Mahjongg girlfriends.  I put one of the avocado pits in with the salad while storing it in the refrigerator for 6 hours before serving and it, along with the rice vinegar, kept the avocado from getting discolored.  It was beautiful and delicious.  I served on romaine lettuce with deviled eggs on the side--excellent!  Definitely a "keeper"!

Yes will definitely make it again. 
As avocado taste rather flat on its own, I added a drizzle of sesame oil for extra fragrance and a dash of black pepper as well. Perfect !!

I made this just as the recipe stated - no substitutions.  My only complaint is, of course, the avocados turned dark making the salad not look so appetizing.  Next time, and yes, there will be a next time, I will add lime juice to the avocados.

While I loved the combo of avocado, bacon and all that this dish talked about, mine did not come out exactly 5-star, despite following the recipe to the letter, and I really wanted it to. Don't know if I should have added more tomatoes or added salt (I left it out because of the bacon) or maybe let it marinate longer. I halved the recipe with the idea to have it as a dinner salad for the two of us. My husband thought it was okay, but we both agreed it would be better to have it as a side dish, rather than the main event. All that said, it is a good salad and great side dish.

Perfect summer salad that constitutes a whole meal (the bacon effect). My local Kroger did not have rice vinegar so I went with Golden Balsamic. Will make often - and will take next time I am invited to  a pitch-in.

I made this with aged balsamic vinegar & no bacon.  It was much better than I expected.   Very fresh dish.  I had mine on arugula.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing!

Nice easy salad. The flavour of the chopped crispy bacon goes great with the creamy avocados. I added a few hard boiled eggs for some extra protein. Thanks for sharing this

This was good but a little heavy for me as a salad. I also cut the vinegar just a bit. I'll try this again and serve it over baby spinach or arugula. I think that would lighten it up. Thanks Kristen

Very tasty salad just don't add the rice vinegar too early it becomes a bit soggy. I added some fresh spinach and made a meal outta it. Thanks for the recipe
