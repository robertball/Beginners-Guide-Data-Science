For chili lovers in the mood to try something different, this recipe is just the thing. It cooks up nice and thick, and I liked that the meat didn't upstage the beans. Becuase the only spice (apart from salt & pepper) is the cumin, all the meats were enhanced without being overpowered -- nice! And the habanero provided just the right amount of kick. This dish was very popular when I served it tonight, and went great with the garlic bread I made to sop up the broth. This recipe's definitely a keeper for me. Thanks!

Great chili recipe. Giving 4 stars only because it needed a lot more kick - I used a whole habenero plus a jalepeno, and will add additional hot peppers next time. I also upped the garlic to 6 cloves, used 1 tbsp cumin, and added a dash of cayenne.

Absolutely the best chili I've ever had.  You can taste the different beans and meats instead of everything tasting the same.  This is our new chili recipe; all others are out!  Thanks for an excellent recipe!

Great chili. Very unique. Every bite was a surprise with what kind of meat you'll get. The blend of beans this chili uses really sets it apart. I thought it could have used a little more spices though.

I made this for a family get together and it was a HUGE hit! My husband liked it so much he took it to a work party and everyone was asking for the recipe! I love that you can taste all the different ingredients. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious! And very colorful! I made this for my husband (who makes two of the best chilies ever), and he loved it! I did cook it for 4 hours to make sure the stew meat was tender. It's an easy recipe, even for a 'not so good cook' as myself! I made it on Fri and we had it for dinner on Sat. Great recipe!

I made this and it was quite tasty. I did change up some things I added carrots and pork sausage (link). I also didn't have habanero so I added 5 regular jalapenos. Yum!

This chili was a hit! I had to add an extra can of tomato sauce because it was a little dry. I also spiced it up a little more with a chili seasoning mix from Lawry's. This was my first attempt at making chili and I will be using this recipe again!

Ok but a little bland. I added a chili seasoning packet to fix the problem. I used canned tomatoes with jalapenos. I used pinto, great northern and kidney beans (can't stand butter beans). I omitted the chicken only because we are on a tight budget right now and I saved the chicken for another meal. Overall, this is pretty good, but definitely nothing to write home about.

There is no seasoning in this chili? Very bland as written. I have never seen a chili recipe without at least chili powder in it?

This was delicious! Didn't even have 12 people over and every last bit of it got eaten up. I used a whole habanero plus some Franks Red Hot but next time I'm upping the # of habaneros. I also nixed the chicken, used a whole package of bacon, and switched out 2 types of beans (I think you can pretty much choose whatever kind of beans you like and throw them in there). Will definitely be making this again!

Made this for the second time (omitting chicken & adding 3 habeneros making it kicking!) It was freakin' AWESOME!!!
Made a double batch for the Packers vs Bears game & it was the rave they devoured it! I also put a chili rub on the steak & grilled it then cut it up & added it along with a couple of Anaheim peppers from the garden which I roasted on the grill since it was fired up & already going.

Best chili ever. I have made this 2 times and each time it is a Winner! I add Jalapeno peppers because my husband really likes it spicy. Other than that no need to add anything! I am thinking about using this for the next chili cook-off at work. Wish me Luck!

Very good. A little too much meat. Many opportunities to go one way or another for preference.

The family really liked it.  I highly recommend this.  It's not your standard chili recipe.  Great recipe.
