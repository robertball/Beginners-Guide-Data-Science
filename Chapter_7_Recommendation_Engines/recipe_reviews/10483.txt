not a big fan of making things out of boxes i put the coating over home made brownie batter. The coating trickled down the sides of my pan and through the batter causing a layer of syrup underneath the brownies. It made them a gooey mess after it was baked. It solidified into a candy like thing which was ok but not supposed to be in brownies. . I really liked how the top looked like the store bought ones and next time i would bake the brownies for a while before putting the coating on. Great addition to an old recipe but needs to be perfected

I think you should make recipies from scratch, not from the box, because almost everyone can make brownies from the box.

I modified this slightly after reading some of the reviews.  I added approximately 4 tablespoons of peanut butter to the whipped egg whites and brown sugar.  This thickened the mixture up quite a bit and we love peanut butter at my house.  I had to bake for 45 mins before it was done.  Very moist and very yummy!

These were fine... just not as "delight"-ful as I'd wished. I used them for an open house/picnic (my Aunt and Uncle's 50th Anniversary) and a lot of people enjoyed them. The top is pretty crumbly, making them a little messier than I'd expected. On first examination, everyone thought the topping was peanut butter... though they still liked it after they found out that wasn't the case. Two people asked for the recipe, so it must be decent! Seems like it needs a little something extra... though I'm not quite sure what.

I did not like this recipe at all. I found nothing special about it and I followed directions for the topping exactly and it still didin't turn out right. Maybe some one else will have better luck with this recipe.
