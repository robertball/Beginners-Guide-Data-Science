This was wonderful for guests.  It seemed like a little too much pasta for the amount of veggies, so I might cut that back a bit next time.  Lacking champagne vinegar I used balsamic, which was tasty too.  It was great the next day for leftovers.

I was asked to make this recipe for a party by the hostess.  I was a little leary, but one taste and it is now a favorite of all of ours.  The dressing ingredients are great.

This was pretty bland. Lacking something. There was too much pasta for the amount of veggies, and I doubled the amount of peppers. And it was a boring dish. But if you put some blue cheese dressing in it, it gives it that extra something and it tastes so much better. With the blue cheese dressing I would change my vote from a two to a four.

Delicious! Added two thinly sliced shallots, used ex.vir.olive oil instead of canola, and goat cheese rather than gorgonzola, as was on hand, a dash of white wine, and topped w/fresh cracked black pepper..YUM!

This recipe is excellent as is, but I added sliced ripe olives. Serves a lot of people. I served to 300 guests last night & had rave reviews!!

This was a solid pasta salad! Both the hubs and I liked it a lot. I made a few tiny modifications - added minced garlic and sweet onion, salt and pepper. Also cut way down on ratio of pasta to veggies based on other reviewers comments. My noodles were a tiny bit warm when I mixed them with the veggies, dressing, and cheese, and I liked that this helped the gorgonzola crumbles melt a bit and cover the pasta. I think adding crumbled bacon would take this salad to the next level as a main dish. Yum!
