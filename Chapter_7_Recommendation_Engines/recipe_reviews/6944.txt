I've used this site many times for finding recipes but this is the first time I have ever wrote a "review"  Even when substituting fat-free cream cheese and light margarine this bread remained moist, rich and delicious.  This is a bread I will feel confident and proud to give as gifts this holiday season.  Thanks Carol!!!!

This bread got me great reviews at work.  I served with a spread I whipped up using 3/4 c. margerine, 2 Tbsp honey, 1/2 tsp cinnimon and a dash of grated orange rind.  It was gone in a half hour!

Let me first start out by saying YUM!
This is the very best pumpkin bread I have ever made.  The cream cheese truly adds another depth of flavor that is very pleasing to the palate.
I did not have the spices that it called for (cloves) so I replaced them with 3t of pumpkin pie spice.  Great recipe!

I followed all directions, except I added a little extra cinnamon and overbaked it by just a couple of minutes. I find this bread to be VERY BLAND. The nuts are nearly the only taste you'll find in this loaf. I had such high hopes for this one, too.. I was going to enter it into my work's bake-off.. but I don't think I'm going to, now...

I have made this three times now--- and I think I have it down.  I only gave it 4 stars but think a few minor adjustments make it 5.  I followed a few other suggestions and added about 1/3 cup applesauce and did one whole egg/one egg yolk in order to really make this super moist and dense...less cake-like.  I also added a little more sugar, more cinnamon and added a kick of nutmeg.  De-lish--- My husband, 3 year old and I polished it off in less than 24 hours :)

This is an excellent pumpkin bread recipe, with just a bit of tweaking.  Like previous reviewers, I also doubled the cinnamon and added a touch of nutmeg.  I added around 6 oz of cream cheese, I believe the recipe calls for 4 oz (I love cream cheese).  I also used 1 c. wheat flour and .75 cup white flour, for health reasons (you can't taste the difference at all, and you get more fiber that way).

The bread turned out delicious - very moist, a wonderful texture and taste!  I love it.  I can tell it will be a staple for fall cooking in my house!

Delicious! My fiance was so impressed he took some to the office and all they could do is sing praise over it! Easy to make, came out moist and flavorful. I did add a little more spice to it because I like a lot of spice with my pumpkin foods.

THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!! I used 3 whole eggs and 6 oz of cream cheese.  SUPER moist and melted in my mouth!! I baked this and brought this with us to our mountain cabin and enjoyed in the cool morning air while sipping coffee on the front porch swing!  Something out of a Norman Rockwell painting for sure!  YEP...IT WAS THAT GOOD! :-)

My loaf turned out very very heavy, but I think this is probably my error, as so many others have made great loaves.  Re-reading the recipe, I believe I may have beaten the mixture too much - I did quite a bit more than 'stir enough just to moisten'.

Delicious.  In order to make these lower carb/glycemic index I used xylitol (GI of 0 and its natural!) and almond flour instead of the sugar and flour.  All eight of the kids and the adults loved them.

I liked it, but am still on a multi-year quest to find the perfect pumpkin loaf.  I made some changes:  swapped in 1 TBSP of pumpkin pie spice in place of the spices listed, next time I would use 1.5 TBSP of pumpkin pie spice.  I used butter in place of margarine and in place of the white sugar, I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 dark brown sugar for a flavor boost.  ...I also increased the pumpkin to approx. 1.5 cups of canned pumpkin to try to make the loaf more pumpkin-y....

This is quick and easy - having a slice now.  I read the reviews, so added extra cream cheese, extra spice and used maple syrup for more flavour.  It was moist, came out of the oven perfect in the recommended time. Next time, I will add even more cream cheese.  Thanks for the recipe!

The loaf came out moist, healthful, and rich in taste, though I customized the recipe: I used 6 instead of 4 oz cream cheese (use low fat for lower fat content), substituted brown sugar for regular, pumpkin seeds (a quarter cup) and golden raisins (half a cup) for the nuts. I also used half-and-half whole wheat and all purpose flour, doubled the amount cinamon and added a little nutmeg, following the advice from preceeding reviews. This loaf is a keeper!

This bread turned out FABULOUS. I am not very good at baking...but this recipe was easy to follow and it turned out incredible. I substituted butter for margarine and I used 1 cup of pecans instead of the walnuts (I had pecans on hand). It was moist and delicious, perfect!! I did double the cinnomon and I didn't have any ground cloves...I didn't mind a bit! This is such a wonderful recipe! Thank you!

This is FABULOUS! I accidentally misread how much pumpkin to put in and just used the entire can and everything worked out fine and gave me enough batter to make 3 mini loafs that I baked for 33 min. This bread isn't a "spice" bread, but you can easily make it suitable to your palate by adding more cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, etc. I personally love the bread and comes out moist and delish! Don't make the mistake of overbaking!!! If toothpick comes out with just a few crumbs pull it out. Bread will continue to cook some when cooling down.

This is wonderful, not only easy but very good!  Not sure what some of the other reviews said about it being bland as I did not find that to be true.  In fact it was perfect!  I will make this again, and again, and again!

I had some left over pumpkin from making cookies, so I decided to try this recipe.  It was great, moist and very tasty.  The cream cheese really does make this pumkin loaf stand out from the rest.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I was able to make it gluten-free too (substituting All-Purpose GF flour mix cup for cup & adding 3/4 tsp Xanthan Gum)! I've tried it as a loaf and as muffins as well. I like to add 1 cup of dried cranberries to the mix, adds a hint of tartness to balance out the sweet. It's divine!

Though I have a general inquiry - EVERY time I've made this (loaf and muffins), it just will NOT cook all the way through! I've tried everything I can but for some reason it just will not! Any suggestions?

I had yogurt cheese that I used in place of the cream cheese & I replaced 1/2 C of the white sugar with dark brown & added more spice, including allspice. And I subbed chocolate chips for the nuts. I'm taking it to a meeting tonight. I think it will go over well.

Very nice.  It came out of the pan great too which can be a challenge w/nut breads.  Based on other comments, I increased the spice.  I used a whole tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice blend.

GORGEOUS!  Every time I make this it is eaten to NOTHING!  Work peeps request it all the time.  If you want to make it even better....  Vanilla Cream Cheese Frosting on the top makes it TO DIE FOR!  Do yourself a favour.... make this for the ones you love TONIGHT!  PS:  Your home will smell amazing for hours after its done :)  Tell me what you thought!

Very moist. I made this for one of our desserts for Christmas dinner. Very Fancy looking, frosted with cream cheese frosting, super good and sooo moist. One is currently in my oven at this very minute! I think the suggestions for some vanilla and extra cream cheese as well as extra spices are great suggestions!..No walnuts in the pantry so tonites loaf will sport chocolate chips

I give it a 5 simply because my bread was a 5 - but i did it ALL WRONG.  First off, I didn't have any margarine, so I used butter.  Then, I didn't have any baking powder, so I just left it as the soda.  Didn't have any pumkin, but I put pumpkin pie filling in and it made aperfect sub. Of course I didn't put any spices in because the pie filling had enough. I also didn't have any salt.  Believe it of not - it turned out AMAZING. I'll be using my version every year I think :)

I substituted chocolate chips for the nuts and a bit more cinnamon and it went over very well.  Three co-workers asked for the recipe.  Definitely worth a try!

Very good bread!  I used about 6 oz. of cream cheese and added a half tsp. of pumpkin pie spice.  The bread turned out moist and is great warm with a little butter.

This is a splendid recipe! I love anything pumpkin so this of course sounded good (especially with cream cheese.) Even though the baking time is like an hour, its totally worth it. My dads girlfriend and I just watched a show and talked and it was done by the time we were! Even my sister, who doesn't care too much for pumpkin, loved it. I added extra pumpkin to it because i love it so much, and it still came out moist and soft. Great recipe! Staying in my recipe box!  :)

I love this bread I can't stop eating it!  Next time I will use bread flour instead of all-purpose flour because the bread seemed cake-y.  I like my bread fluffier and lighter.

This is by far the best pumpkin bread recipe I have come across. It's a fool proof recipe. I have made this bread at least a dozen times and it never fails. I usually make it without walnuts but it tastes great with or without.

I made this exactly as indicted except I threw in 1 banana I had that was overripe. My family loved it and my husband said it was like the bread I used to make that I lost the recipe for. Very good for fall/winter, moist and tastes amazing!

I made this just as written except I used butter and added more cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp nutmeg and it came out great!  I took it to work and everyone loved it.  It was super moist and very tasty.  I'm making more for family this weekend.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My first loaf I have ever made and it couldn't have come out better. My family ate it in one day and now that's it's baking season, I've made it once a week. It never lasts for more than a day. Love this! I use pumpkin pie spice instead of cloves.

As is the case for many of us, Halloween just passed and I had several uncarved pumpkins staring me down. I couldn't part with them that easily, so I cracked 'em open with the intentions of toasting the seeds. Seeing all that pumpkiny goodness go to waste just didn't suit me. I decided that it shall live on in the form of a loaf. I felt a little nervous having never used real pumpkin for anything, so I hopped on the ol' laptop and found this recipe. I altered it a little for the sake of flavor. The 1 1/4 cups white sugar sounded boring so I used 1/2c white sugar, 1/2c brown sugar, and a 1/4c MAPLE SYRUP. Also... didn't have cinnamon so instead of the cloves and cinnamon I used 1 &1/2t pumpkin pie spice. Other than that I followed it to a T and have only tried the batter [loaf is in the oven] and it is PHENOMENAL!!

The recipe is a pretty good base recipe. However is turned out really bland. Next time I think a pumpkin cheesecake is better or pumpkin cheescake minis. I have another recipe that is way more flavorful and more moist. I do like this for a base recipe though. And some people don't like alot of spices and this may be good for someone that preffered a blander recipe. Some of my relatives may prefer it since they like calmer & blander recipes. I will use this for a base I think. So, I thank Carol for sharing it. :) I think some people may adore it.

This recipe is going in my permanent additions box!  I followed the directions exactly (which is rare for me) and it came out of the oven perfect.  I stored it on the counter wrapped in plastic wrap and it stayed moist and tender until it was gone.  I even sliced it up and took it with on a shopping trip for something to snack on!  Yum!  Give this recipe a try...its wonderful!

This is okay but if you want a pumpkin loaf that will knock your socks off, try the Downeast Maine pumpkin bread.  I will be going back to that recipe I got on the site and never stray again!

this was great! Easy enough to make, although my sister and I did get a little antsy waiting for it to be done. I recommend using an electric mixer and/or melting the butter a bit first. It was really hard to stir by hand. Still, turned out great!

This was great, I used fresh pumpkin puree instead of canned. The bread was moist and perfectly spiced.

very good, moist loaf - took the shape of my decorate pan well though in retrospect, I'd tamp out the air bubbles.  Overall, delicious and even better the next day with a shmeer of *ahem* cream cheese!

This is one of the best pumpkinnloaf recipes that I have tried.  This recipe is a tiny bit bland but if you add a teaspoon of pumpkin spice it comes out great.

Delicious!  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I also used whole wheat flour, reduced by 1/8 cup. My kids loved it and my family of four ate this whole thing in 1.5 days.  Will definitely make it again!

I am famous for my pumpkin loaf, thanks to this recipe. The cream cheese really makes it moist and brilliant. I won a work bake-off with this recipe, and I still have people coming up to me to let me know how good it was. Thanks!!

I was actually a bit disappointed in this pumpkin loaf recipe.  First of all, it wasn't very moist, secondly you could not taste any of the cream cheese flavor and finally it was actually pretty bland.  I will continue to search for the perfect pumpkin/cream cheese loaf recipe...

The bread was very moist and had a nice texture but I thought the flavor was lacking. I made the recipe as listed except I swapped a cup of flour with wheat flour.

Easy and good. Very similar to what Starbucks is selling just now. Am glad I had some left over pumpkin to spur me to find this recipe. I lowered flour to 1.5 cups and added .5 cups of quick oats because everything tastes better with oats in it. The result is a slightly less cakey version, which I prefer. Better for me too! Next time I will sneak in a Tbsp or two of bran as well.

I've made this pumpkin bread dozens of times and my whole family loves it.  I like to make it extra healthy by reducing the amount of sugar by 1/2 cup, substituting 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for some of the white flour, and adding a couple tablespoons gluten flour (which makes the bread lighter and fluffier).  These sell especially well in my house when I make them as muffins.  I made my healthy version as mini-muffins for snack at my sons pre-school and the kids gobbled them up!  Thank you for this unique recipe!

The preparation is quick and easy; it only took about 15 minutes.  The recipe was easy to follow and most ingredients, beside the pumpkin, is something you’d find in your kitchen.  The cook time was accurate, but we were unsatisfied with the outcome.  The bread was very bland, and its appearance was unappetizing.  The walnuts became black on the edges when cooking, which caused a large contrast with the light colored bread.

Everyone loved this loaf. I made 2 changes. I substituted about 1/3 of the flour with whole wheat flour rather than using all white flour. I also used chocolate chips instead of nuts so my kids could have it at school. Fantastic loaf.... super moist!!

I used more cream cheese, and used all spice instead of cloves. I also doubled the recipe. (to which I added extra cinnamon, and allspice b/c of a comment of the loaves being bland)  I found it wonderfully moist, and very flavorful.  Not to mention, so easy, my 6 year old can practically do it himself. Would I make it again? Yes, but with some apple sauce like I usually do. I really enjoy it. My house also smells incredibly delicious right now. :)

I skipped the cinnamon and walnuts because I hate them, and used nutmeg and a tsp of fresh ginger. It was terrific.

How funny that at 65 I am developing a taste for pumpkin, and this  recipe certainly made a believer out of me. It is a fast & simple goto that I will make frequently. It has just the right balance of sweetness  & spice.  The cream cheese adds a delightful tang and maintains a solid, but moist, loaf. I followed this recipe as is...no fiddling needed. Used a 9 inch loaf pan, 350 for about 45 min in my sometimes unpredictable oven.  Delightful!

I made it with a few modifications and family loved it.  I used freshly roasted pumpkin, substituted dried cranberries for the walnuts, and changed up the spices to suite my family's preference for cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger - with just a splash of cloves.

Turned out great! I only spread the walnuts over the top crust instead of throughout the whole loaf since I'm not a huge fan of nutty bread, and added slightly more cloves than the recipe called for but followed the rest of the recipe pretty closely. Eating it the next day might even be better than right out of the oven...delicious!

I made this recipe last year & my husband asked me to make several loaves this year.  The  recipe makes a very good sized pumpkin loaf that is very dense & moist!  The only changes I make are using butter instead of margarine, I  use more pumpkin so that I don't have to refrigerate or toss what's left in the can, & I don't always put nuts in.   Word of caution though - always make 2 or more loaves at a time.  These get devoured quickly!

Excellent! Very moist and delicious. I didn't change a thing except the cook time. It needed about an hour and 45 minutes at 350. The center was still raw at 50 minutes. Highly recommend this recipe!

Moist and dense, this is a winner. But the spices could be more pronounced. I will make this again, for sure, but next time, I think I will add powdered ginger and more cinnamon.

The first time I made this I found it to be so easy I made two loaves. My family loves it. I didn't have any clove but I used all spice in its place and no nuts. I have made it several times since then and I make the recipe and bake them in a mini muffin pan for about 12 minutes and no one can get enough of them. I usually have to make a double recipe, which gives me about 100 mini muffins and they still seem to gobble them up right away.

I have made this recipe many times and I love it. My kids go crazy for it. The only substitute I make is I add 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin. It adds so much extra moisture and makes it so much better!

Like several others have suggested, I modified this a bit.  Added 6 oz of cream cheese and a 1cup 1/4 of pumpkin, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of all spice, substituted 1 1/4 cup of sugar (1/2 cup of white sugar, 1/2 cup of brown, 1/8 maple syrup, 1/8 of molasses)...absolutely amazing!!!  Will make this many more times over the fall.

his recipe was very tasty, I did change a few things, I used fresh pumpkin and I added about 2 extra tbps of pumpkin to give it some extra flavor and I added 1 tsp of allspice instead of the individual spices and about 1/8 tsp ginger powder. My husband still thought it could have been a little spicier so i think next time  I will add more cinnamon. I didn't think it was super heavy though as some of the other commentators have said.

It was so good. I read some of the reviews before making it. I doubled the recipe so I ended up using a 29oz Libby's Pumpkin can. I also added 1/2 cup dark brown sugar for a double batch on top of the sugar listed in recipe, and I doubled the cinnamon. It turned out great!!

Turns out nice and moist and tastes great.  Adding chocolate chips makes it great too.  I think I would like more walnuts than the recipe calls for.  I am not a baker, so this easy recipe works great!

This loaf is AMAZING! I recommend to any pumpkin lovers. The only change I made was that I added a bit of Allspice to the dry ingredients.

I think this is a great recipe!  I am not a big baker, but this was simple.  I was just trying to get rid of some extra pumpkin puree & this worked marvelously!  I did add 1 tsp of vanilla & I think that helped.  I might up the measurements of the spices for my next batch, but otherwise, it is delightful!  A good tip:  The top of my loaves were a bit hard when I took them out of the oven, but I let them cool & then, while they were still warm, I put them into ziplocks & they softened up & were super moist when we ate them!  Delicious & easy!

Turned out beautifully!  I left out the cloves, but did everything else.  The whole thing was gone in less than 24 hours!

This is the first time I have made a pumpkin bread and I think it turned out great! I did not use the clove and just added a little more cinnamon. I am going to use this recipe to make mini loaves for gifts!

This was an uber moist and delicious pumpkin loaf. I even cut a little bit of the fats and sugars and it was still amazing.

This turned out very good. I made two loaves and froze one. It froze very well and was still good after defrosting. My husband keeps asking me to make this again.

Very tastey and moist!  Turns crumbly if you don't eat it up right away though.

Mmmm, so good.  I make this quite a bit and I agree with the PP about the nuts and flour.  I too add them after the rest of the ingredients are mixed and then sprinkle extra on top after it's in the pan.    I also double the cinnamon and omit the cloves.  Delicious!

This recipe turned out not quite as I expected. Although it was very moist and had good flavor, I am not sure why the nuts were added with the dry ingredients. I had a hard time getting the flour that was stuck in the crevices to blend with the wet ingredients when I mixed the two. Next time I will add the nuts after mixing the rest of the components like I normally do. Otherwise, very tasty.

I got some pie pumpkins from a local farm and needed to do something with them quick. This recipe came to the rescue! The cream cheese really adds great flavor and texture. I'll definitely be making this again in the fall! It also freezes very well!

This recipe was very good.  The bread turned out excellent - moist and delicious.  I doubled the recipe to make two loaves.  As another reviewer suggested, I doubled the cinnamon and added a little nutmeg and vanilla.

I thought the bread was simple to make, and turned out nicely. I read some of the other reviews before making it and did double the cinnamon plus added nutmeg and golden raisins. Can't wait to share it with the family tomorrow :)

Moist bread that doesn't crumble when you cut it.  This is the recipe I'll be using from now on!

This loaf came out light, moist, and delicious. I had 3/4 cup leftover pumpkin from a pie I made and decided to add 1/4 cup mashed mandarin orange slices to make up the volume. Also, I used neufchatel lower-fat cream cheese. It was a big hit with everyone.

Not my favorite recipe. Not a lot of pumpkin flavor and my family complained it was too dry. I hate giving bad reviews, but this I won't make again. Thank you, though.

Really good.  Double the cinnamon and add a quarter tsp. nutmeg though.  Everyone said it was moist but mine wasn't *that* moist, even though I only baked it 53 minutes.  So watch the time.

I searched for a spur of the moment recipe for pumpkin bread and made this one because I had everything at home anyways. It is great!!! I'm taking half to the office tomorrow! I added one egg, but I think it would have been just as good.
