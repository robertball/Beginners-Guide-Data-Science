I gave this recipe a 5 star rating because of quite a few modifications.  Without modifications, it gets a 2. First, this makes a ton so half the recipe.  From there, add a teaspoon of paprika along with listed ingredients.  Add at least 1 tablespoon of honey, more if you like.  Add about 1 teaspoon of yellow mustard, and instead of almonds, add a Tablespoon of poppy seeds. Oh yeah, double the curry.  I did not add pinapple, but i've had chicken salad that way and really liked it.  With these changes it will be yummy, but it is even better the next day as it says in the recipe.  The curry flavor is more pronounced the next day.

I made this for a baby shower and everyone absolutely raved about it.  I did not change a single ingredient (except for using red grapes instead of green) and think this is the way I will make curried chicken salad from now on.  I make curried chicken salad every summer and have tried many different recipes but this is by far my favorite!

This recipe makes a TON - I halved everything, and it still made a lot.  Not sure why I didn't just love it - I love each and every ingredient in it, but they just didn't seem to go together well.  Maybe it was the dressing.  I love curried chicken salad at restaurants, too, but this wasn't quite the recipe I thought it would be.  I even used fresh pineapple to make it extra special.  I let it sit overnight, and the chicken ended up 'pasty' - the problem got even worse the day after that.  Maybe the soy sauce and mayonnaise caused the chicken to break down?? I think I will keep looking.

Incredible! My kids devoured this quicker than a candy bar! I used fresh pineapple and used the shell as a serving dish (fancy presentation & easy clean up!)  I used walnuts as I did not have almonds on hand and it was awesome! I served it with fresh crescent rolls from the bakery so everyone could make their own sandwich. Can't wait to make this for a party! I am addicted! THANK YOU FOR A GREAT RECIPE!!!

I really wanted to like this, because I like curry and chicken together, but it was just average and a little bland.  It was missing something - salt or some additional spice.  I didn't include the celery or pineapple because I don't like them in salads.

Excellent recipe.  Did add a bit of honey as suggested.  Used red, green and black grapes and bedded it on greens in a trifle bowl.  Looked very pretty. cookiegirl

I thought that this was very good. I think it needs more curry and pineapple though.

I halved this recipe, then I made this without the water chestnuts, with red instead of green grapes, and sliced instead of slivered almonds.  I loved it, and so did my coworkers!  It was perfect for an office luncheon- served with saltines! :)

I personally didn't love this (I was excited to try it, but just didn't love the curry flavour as much as I thought I would!), but I think it's a great recipe.  give it a shot for a different chicken salad!

I love this recipe. Whenever I make it, it's a hit. My only changes are to omit water chestnuts (I usually don't have them on hand) and baking rather than poaching the chicken. It's easily scaled for a smaller group.

This is going to be my new favorite salad. So easy to make. I added just a few things: added more paprika about half teaspoon to the dressing and added diced apples. We love the crunchyness and flavor it adds.

Oh Yes!! This is the best chicken salad recipe Ever! All the flavors work beautifully together, and it comes together fairly quickly.  Everyone asks for the recipe when you make this chicken salad recipe.

I really liked the addition of pineapple in this salad. I also love curry but found it was too overpowering in this.  Next time I would use a lot less.
