There were mixed reviews on this. I thought it was okay, but some guests raved! (I have to admit I did not use the brandy, though, per some guests' dietary needs). The comments I would note are: the water makes a very soupy sauce- would omit next time. The butter browns the chicken better than oil (I tried both), but in the end you could OMIT either as it make little difference in taste. Also, bone-in breasts are tastier than boneless, and were preferred over the drumstick-thighs I also used. I added a 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, 1 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper.

Made this this evening - I did not care for this. I love cherries, I love chicken - but this was just awful. If you are considering making this -- I would strongly recommend 1/4 or 1/2 the recipe.
