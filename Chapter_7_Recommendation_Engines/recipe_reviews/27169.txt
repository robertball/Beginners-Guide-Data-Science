I love making eggs benedict and this was no exception. This was delicious and a great recipe for those who are on a low carb diet. I used the Blender hollandaise from AR using one extra egg yolk and subbing white balsamic vinegar for the lemon juice. I cooked the artichokes in boiling seasoned water, cooled and then pulled off all the leaves to use as appetizers and then cleaned the bottom of the choke and this became a twofer recipe:) The artichokes could be done a day or two in advance to make this even easier to assemble. Love this!Thanks so much for sharing this terrific recipe Babs Hanna!

For expediency I used artichoke hearts from a can and a Hollandaise mix packet.  I really loved the way the earthy flavors from the artichoke hearts, black olives and scallions came together!

Yum this was a good recipe, I bought marinated artichoke hearts that came in a jar so I just rinsed them off and warmed them up a little, I also didnâ€™t serve it on a hot plate like suggested in the recipe. Other than that I followed the recipe as written and it turned out great. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe

or 1 can artichoke bottoms, 1 recipe hollandaise or 1 container prepared Hollandaise from T. Joe's, 3 eggs, sliced black olives, chopped chives. Sooo easy and soooooo good.
