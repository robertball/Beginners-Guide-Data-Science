I followed the recipe exactly. It seemed thick enough to me after blending it, but I followed the cook's note and continued cooking for another 30 minutes. The cauliflower taste was not as strong after cooking it the extra time. Next time I make this, I will decrease the white pepper for my own preference to 1/2 teaspoon and then add more if needed. I love that this soup has only 58 calories per serving!

I followed the recipe exactly - except for adding a tad of heavy cream and a tad of cayenne. The soup was very smooth and light and we enjoyed it the next day as well. Definitely a keeper - Thank you, Lee!

Excellent!  I have never made cauliflower soup, so I have nothing to compare it to, but this tastes wonderful!  I ended up making a double batch and I don't have an immersion blender, so instead of trying to put everything in the blender, I used my large Kitchen-Aid to cream the soup.  It wasn't 100% creamy, but close enough and it was way easier than a blender!

Really, really tasty--you'd swear there was cream in this. Two suggestions: I thought 10 cloves of garlic would be too much, so I added 7, and that was PLENTY; it has a strong garlic bite to it. Also, use a good-quality stock here. In some soups, you can get away with some cheap bouillon broth,  but because there are so few ingredients here, each one needs to be good on its own.

I like this recipe a lot. It was easy to prepare and it's very tasty. I added a little bit crushed red pepper to mine for a little kick. I thought this was a little garlicky for my taste. So, next time I will use a little less garlic. I'm really wondering about the calorie count. If it's accurate, this is very good and nutritious for those of us who are trying to watch our daily calorie count.

Increased cubed potatoes to 4 cups. Used immersion blender then added a cup of milk and 1/2 cup half and half. No one would believe this soup's top ingredient was actually cauliflower :)

Reduced cauliflower to 3 cups. Reduced garlic and pepper. Added 1 cup celery, 
Stirred in 1/2 C low fat sour cream and 2 slices cooked,crumbled well drained bacon just before serving.
Diced ham instead of bacon might a be nice alternative.

Very good soup but I did not add as much garlic as written. I used romanesco cauliflower, which gave it a beautiful green hue. Thank you for the recipe.

Incredibly rich and filling - and no dairy!! Thought the garlic might be overpowering, but I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Wouldn't change a thing ...  This is my new cold weather go-to soup!

This recipe was very good with modifications.  I reduced the garlic by a third, and cut back on the white pepper as well as the salt.  I did add a sprinkling of red pepper flakes, as well as about a 1 tablespoon  of both white wine and dried parsley flakes.  I also added about 1/2 cup of shredded co-jack cheese which added a bit to the creaminess after using my immersion blender.   The only problem was that it was very peppery, even thought I'd cut back on the white pepper.  Next time, I'll omit the red pepper flakes, but will make this again.

Very tasty.  I made this a couple of weeks ago and pulled some out of the freezer today for lunch. I stirred in a little Parmesan cheese and wow!  It was even better than I remembered.

I have been trying to convert some of my roux soups to non-roux so that I can cut the butter out.  This recipe was perfect for that. I like my soup thicker so I subbed half the water for milk late in cooking and added a couple tbsp of cornstarch just to thicken it up a bit. It is very good. Half the garlic and the thyme as it would be too strong as written. Very yummy thank you!!

This was surprisingly very delicious! I love that it is so healthy. I added some whole grain bread on the side. One of my kids felt it needed real cheese so she added some shredded to her bowl. This made 16 cups worth!!

Pretty good...a little bland but seasoning bumped it up.
