Other than some issues with the instructions, this recipe tasted terrific! I only used 2 large bone in pork chops and one egg and just enough flour to coat the chops. No mention of what to do with onion, which I sautéed with mushrooms. Also incomplete instructions for potatoes. I used small “new potato” sized, so I boiled them whole. I had enough sauce for 3 or 4 pork chops which wasn’t a problem since we love sauce so I just doubled up. I was unsure about the lemon juice in the cream sauce but it worked well. Some might say sauce on chop and saucy potatoes equals too much sauce on a plate. But I loved it and my husband also gave the meal high marks!
