I can't believe I'm the first to try this recipe! It was good but next time I'm going to sprinkle the bread with some cinnamon/Splenda & then sprinkle some more on top of the apples. I used a refrigerated butter spray instead of butter. I'd say I had enough apple for 2 slices of bread, not 4. Great, quick snack & thank you!

I tried this last night and LOVED it! I toasted the bread first and that helped it to not get too soggy.

I used WAY less than a tbsp of cinnamon for four slices of toast. This is delicious as is, but is even better with a drizzle of honey or even a little brown sugar. Thanks!

This is great for an easy, quick and delicious snack. I used whole grain bread that I toasted first and light butter.  I also used cinnamon sugar vs. just cinnamon. I love apples and this really hit the spot!

What a wonderful healthy after school snack.  My daughter loves apples, but since she got her braces, she has not been able to eat them.  She also loves cinnomon toast....this combination was just what we were looking for.  The broiler gently toasted the bread, while the apples were, "oh, so tender".  I would suggest using an apple peeler/corer/slicer to achieve the very thin slices needed for this recipe.

Made this for the kids today for after school snack. It was alright. It tasted much better when dipped in hot cocoa. I think it needs a little extra sugar. Also I baked mine at 450 for 10 min. It came out perfectly toasted and the apples were softened just right too. Thanks!

My husband and I loved this on fresh french bread from our bread machine.  We added brown sugar and used granny smith apples.  My kids just loved eating the bread plain with sliced plain apples on top!

This even makes a great breakfast! I sauteed the apples for just a bit due to the fact that my daughter and I are allergic to raw apples. I then followed the recipe and it was delicious! Thanks so much Natalie!

This was a simple lunch I could make for my son and I out of minimal ingredients. I used Dave's Killer bread, crunchy peanut butter instead of just butter, granny smith apples and I used homemade apple pie spice instead of regular cinnamon. Next time, I might just toast the bread in the toaster just because it's quicker.

Oh  Yum...I'm not a big apple eater, but this will make me one.  This is delish. I put a thin layer of brown sugar on top of the butter(toasted bread) then the apple, then a bit of brown sugar and apple pie spice. Excellent.  Try it.

Used cinnamon sugar and toasted both sides. Toast one side then flip and put on the apple slices and toast the 2nd side. Yum!

This was not good; it was soggy until I first toasted the bread. Then the kids enjoyed it.

My kids loved the Apple Toast! I did not think it would be such a hit for something so simple. The only thing I did differently to add some protein is spread peanut butter or almond butter instead of the butter.

This was a huge hit with my kids.  I did add a little bit of sugar as well, which I know makes it not as healthy but it sure tastes delicious.  You don't have to add much either.  Overall, BIG hit!

As another reviewer mentioned, I think subbing the butter out for almond butter (or peanut butter) would be just as tasty and you'd get the extra "oomph" of protein and good fats. Yum!

I make this for a quick breakfast with tea. I also toast bread first then butter bread, add cinnamon sugar, golden delicious apples, more sugar, and bake in oven for 10 min @ 400 degrees. Taste better this way.

I didn't have to add sugar, like other people suggested, but different kinds of apples have different sugar levels. I used Gala apples. I didn't measure the cinnamon, just kind of sprinkled it on for a dusting. I'm going to try toasting the bread lightly first, then doing everything else. The bread under the apples was a bit soggy. Overall it was enjoyable, easy and fast, which is great for when you're really hungry.

This recipe was a hit with my family. I did take the suggestions to add a touch of brown sugar to the bread before adding the apples but I think it would have been fine without it since I used raisin cinnamon bread which was sweet enough!

I gave this only 4 stars because I liked it, but the kids weren't as excited.  I followed someone's idea and toasted the bread first, then spread the butter and cinnamon & sugar, then baked it on a cookie sheet for 10 minutes at 450.

I made this as a nutrition project for the kids in my preschool class. We used whole wheat bread and did not add any glaze. The kids all loved it and they each made their own so it was a great experience for them! Thanks for this!

I liked these very much. I took advice of reviewers and added brown sugar and cinnamon to the bottom and on top of the apples. When they were done, I folded the bread over, and my kids loved these "apple-pockets".

To get it to my liking I precooked the apples in the microwave and drizzled the finished product with honey. Yum!

It was not as good as I thought. It was probably my fault but I wanted the apples to be really soft so I kept it in the oven for a while and the bread was so toasted it was hard .

Used two slices of wheat bread, light butter, less than half a granny smith apple (thinly sliced), and cinnamon sugar. Broiled for about a minute or two. Came out really yummy. My five year old loved it :)

A fun treat!  I surprised the family with these one afternoon.  They loved having this quick appley-cinnamony snack.  Not as good as apple pie but a great way to quickly satisfy a craving for apple pie.  I did mix the cinnamon with some brown sugar.  My husband loved it, but he did offer the suggestion of toasting the bread a bit first (as other reviewers have suggested) so I might try that next time.

I used dried apples, reconstituted, instead of fresh.  Delicious with a bit of caramel sauce for a nice dessert.

This was a nice simple treat.  I tried it out for myself before making it for my kids.  I had it for breakfast and it makes a nice change for the morning. I used less butter and had a cinnamon/sugar mix already made up so I used that.

I made this for a snack today and lightened it up by using light butter and splenda w/ the cinnamon. I drizzled it w/ maple syrup (just a smidge...not enough to add any major calories). All in all it was good. I could have sliced my apples thinner though as mine didn't get as soft as I would have liked.

Next time I would peel the apple first as I seemed to get whole slices of apple and empty bread. Added a bit of sugar and sprinkled cinnamon on bread too.

A delicious concept; however, I burnt the first two pieces I tried to make because I left them in for about 3 minutes. So, I tried again. This time I took the toast out after only 2 minutes, and the apples were still crisp, not cooked through. I want to try  what lynnb did and bake this at 400 degrees for 10 minutes. I'll report back how that works.

My first bite I wasn't sure this was going to have any flavor.  Be careful cause my bread was tough to handle from the middle being a little soggy.  I did use cinnamon-sugar instead of just cinnamon.  Next time I will use a thin layer of peanut butter instead of the butter to see if there is more flavor and stability.  I did eat the rest of the toast so that says something!

Easy and Quick! My kids thought it was yummy. I plan to use this to cook with my daughtes class at school. They'll be able to do almost every step alone. They'll love that! I would definatley add some cinnamon and sugar to the toast before adding the apples.

This was a nice snack and a creative idea. I loved the crunchy toast and chewy apples. Make sure to sprinkle the cinnamon evenly. With an electric oven that has two broil settings, level High is the way to go. Awesome recipe!

I tried it and I realized I was just doing it cause I was hungry. I didn't keep the recipe in mind there for I didn't out the oven on broil. Haha... So note to self people! It has to be put on broil! Or you will just get mushy bread but good apples.

I toasted the bread first as another reviewer suggested, and I'm glad I did. It would have been too soggy without doing that. I had to leave them in the oven longer for the apples to soften just a little bit. This tasted good. But, honestly, I have had applesauce on toast, and I think that's much easier and tastes better. I liked this, but I probably won't do it again.

Wow what a great idea. My daughter loved this. I used sourdough and added a little sugar to the cinnamon. Also drizzled it with honey. Toasted the bread first for some crunch.

hmmmm was a little disappointed with this recipe, I did read the reviews and toasted bread first as well as adding a sprinkle of brown sugar, my kids picked the apple off and scraped all the cinnamon off with a knife before eating the slices, I probably won't make this again for my kids (they are not huge fans of sugery snacks) but I thought they's love love love it - oh well guess not. I gave it 3 stars because even though my kids didn't really like it I thought it was a great easy snack idea!!
