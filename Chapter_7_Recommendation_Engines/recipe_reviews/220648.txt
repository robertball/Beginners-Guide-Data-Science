I cut this back to ONE pie by just using one container of whipped topping and one homemade graham cracker crust.I kept all the other ingredients the same. It was just enough without slopping over. I made a pretty pattern on the edges of the pie with sliced strawberries. My family LOVED this pie. I did not try it myself but they ate over half for dessert last night and they said it was delicious.

I didn't realize it was for two pies until I got going but I had the 2nd crust so decided to half the strawberries and make the 2nd with blueberries.  The strawberries have more flavor when frozen.  Both were good but will have to tweak the blueberry idea.  Thanks!

Update:  Puree a cup of strawberries and boil them down to about 1/2 cup.  Let them cool and add them along with 1/2 cup of diced strawberries.  Makes it pretty stawberrylicious.  I've had several people tell me this was their favorite pie ever.  Thank you for this recipe!

Original:  Pretty tasty and very easy to make!  We added about a cup of strawberry and I might add more next time.  We also did not find it necessary to use an entire 8oz cool whip to frost the top.  We just used some to decorate.  I'd be afraid using the whole second tub of cool whip would make it basically a cool whip pie, not a strawberry pie.  It did taste just like a strawberry shake!
