These were amazingly good tacos for not having meat in them. Hubby and I are big meat eaters and not big on eggplant but we both enjoyed them very much. The seasonings used are a great way to dress up eggplant. Give this one a try for something fun and unique!

Very good recipe and a great option for using eggplant!  I topped with pico de gallo and avacado and used two jalapeños and cherry pepers for some added heat.  I reduced all the spices to just a couple shakes maybe 1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon and didn't have cumin so used cayenne powder.

The concept for these tacos was good, and the flavor was there.  The recipe was not well conceived, however. 
It wasn't clear how much eggplant to use. It would have been better to specify what kind of eggplant (European, Italian, Japanese) and what size (small, medium, large). Even better would have been to specify the weight. Also, should it be peeled or not? What size cubes should it be cut into? For the four taco shells it called for, we used seven medium-sized Japanese eggplants, peeled. 
The amount of lemon juice and spice mix called for was way out of proportion. We used only one quarter of the amount called for and it was plenty. 
The order of adding ingredients to the pan wasn't smart either. The garlic will burn before the eggplant is cooked. We added the onion and the eggplant to the pan together first. Then we added the spice mix and the garlic and jalapeño. Finally, after the eggplant was cooked, we added the lemon juice. 
The consistency, as expected, was mushy. We didn't care for this consistency. It might have been better inside a flour tortilla and rolled like a burrito.
The author states that you won't miss the meat. But, unless you pair this recipe with some beans (or other protein), your body will miss the protein. We served beans and rice on the side.

This tasted amazing and was so quick and simple!  I used flour tortillas instead and topped it with cheese and salvodorean sour cream.

Very good. We topped it with cheese, fresh diced tomato, diced red onion, boiled sweet potato and a squeeze of lime. Next time we may add a little sour cream and cilantro also.

I made the eggplant filing exactly as written but then.....forget the taco shell.....we put it in warm pita bread, added some hummus and topped it with yogurt sauce (plain yogurt, lime juice, cilantro) and BAM amazing.

This wasn't the clearest recipe on the planet, however it did turn out very tasty! Made as a vegetarian option for a Cinco de Mayo party and it was a big hit! I'll probably tweak the recipe a bit and keep. Wanted to get a photo, but it was mostly gone before I got a chance!

Absolutely Fantastic!  I love eggplant but don't always want it as an Italian dish.  This was perfect!  I did add one small chicken breast cut into fajita style strips in case the kids didn't like the eggplant.  They ended up liking the eggplant.  And I don't keep seasoned salt on hand so I used Chef Prudhomme's Fajita magic seasoning instead.

None of my family cared for this.  I love eggplant, but the flavor combinations didn't work for me.  It is a good recipe, though, and I'm glad I tried it, even though it was a personal taste issue.  I feel bad about giving the recipe only 3 stars, but it didn't turn out to be something we loved.

These were pretty good. I added some chopped tomato and red bell pepper. Only 4 out of 5 stars because it gave me terrible heartburn.

This is an easy recipe which I made during our Mexican night for our vegetarian friend and even the non vegetarians liked it. Perhaps using the taco seasoning next time will convince my children to try it too.

It's wonderful!  I doubled it for freezing extra. I added a can of black beans for protein. Will def make again.  I plan to eat in lettuce wraps, tortillas and even a cracker topper for a quick snack.

I loved this recipe. I doubled the garlic and the jalapeno. Also, I only used maybe 5 tablespoons of oil to cut down on calories. I highly recommend this recipe. Even if you are not vegetarian. Loads of flavor!

It was a better flavor the next day. It was super great. I truly love the seasonings with the taco shell.

Made these tonight!! Delicious! I have to admit, I cheated on the seasonings. I used a taco seasoning packet that I needed to use up that was in the cabinet, I also forgot to add lemon juice until after I added the eggplant. Even with a few substitutions and mistakes this recipe was awesome! Will make again!!!

Delicious! I’ll def make it again with less chilli powder. We ate it in hard taco shells with our favourite additions : cheese, sour cream, guacamole, salsa, scallions ... It was good over salad greens too. This recipe is a keeper .

I just added a can of kidney beans for the protein, kale (cooked both in with the eggplant for the last few mins) and maybe 2 T brown sugar.

Love this recipe! I don't usually like eggplant. This recipe is the best eggplant dish I've had and it is now on my list of favorites when eggplants come in our co op farm basket!

This was really good. The only thing I had to do was add little bit of water so that the eggplant can get steamed and soft.

Made this last night, i added a zuchini and a dash of curry powder because i didn't hv enough cumin.  Served with pico de gallo. Was very nice, will definitely make it again one day.
