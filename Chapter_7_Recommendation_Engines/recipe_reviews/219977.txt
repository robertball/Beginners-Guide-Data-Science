The first time I made these they were odd, like fried cream cheese.  I thought I did something wrong but I read the recipe over and over and didn't see any error on my part.  We ended up throwing them out.  I tried making them a second time and they came out REALLY GOOD! This is what I did for 2 servings:  Whipped a batter of 4 oz softened cream cheese, 1/2 CUP FLOUR, 1 teaspoon BAKING POWDER, 2 teaspoons confectioners sugar, , TWO EGGS, 2 teaspoons softened butter, the juice of 1 lemon, 2 teaspoons fine fresh lemon zest, and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract.  They had more of a pancake consistency and the flavor was way better too!

I rate this 5 stars because of its uniqueness as I have never made pancakes using cream cheese. I used my hand mixer to blend the ingredients. I misread the instructions  and added fresh squeezed lemon juice into the actual batter and as a result, the cream cheese batter had a nice lemon zing to it very much like lemon cheesecake.  I made these into silver-dollar sized pancakes and the only problem I had with using butter on the griddle was they browned really quickly around the outer edges. I did not dust with confectioner's sugar instead I added 3 teaspoons of granulated sugar to the batter. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I will defintely make again to serve at brunch.

I really enjoyed these. I thought they were light and tasted delectable. I tried as recipe calls and adding some zest as reviewer suggested. Adding zest changed the flavor only somewhat. Silver dollar size from googling is 1.75" or approx. a good teaspoon. I had griddle at 325 degrees and thought it was appropriate. I am going to make lots of these for Easter Sunrise Service Potluck Breakfast.

Made this for Recipe Group and I have to say that these were not my favorite...hubby didn't like them at all and I felt they lacked majorly in the flavor department. I think these would benefit from having some lemon zest and juice added to them and not just some juice squirted on top. I had no problem w/ the cream cheese flavor (I LOVE cream cheese), but these hardly even tasted like that. These fell very flat for us...I did end up topping them w/ 'Microwave Lemon Curd', which I used a mix of lemons and limes, and that, along w/ some whipped cream livened these up for me (hubby still wasn't a fan). I most likely will not be make these again, sorry, but they were interesting enough to try.

The texture of these pancakes was not to my liking as it was scrambled egg-ish. Tasteless even with the lemon. The name implies cheesecake. The taste, not so much. The batter was difficult for me to work with. Sorry didn't like this pancake recipe.

Made these for RECIPE GROUP was sadly disappointed. Made and served them exactly as directed, they don't taste very cheesecake-y, and since there's no leavener they don't rise. Won't be making these again.

Served with lemon curd and whipped cream.....delicious! I doubled the amount of flour and lemon juice, and added 2 teaspoons of lemon zest.

These were pretty good.  The pancake itself could use some fine lemon zest or some lemon juice.  The squeeze of lemon on top is essential.  I don't think these would hold very well and are best eaten hot off the griddle.  Next time I think I would thin the batter a bit with lemon juice - add a little bit a zest.  Thanks for a different and interesting recipe.

These pancakes are delicious and delicate! A lovely light breakfast. I recommend using one of those plastic syringes you get from the pharmacy to administer kids medicine to drizzle the lemon juice on the pancakes. This recipe doesn't make many pancakes. I recommend doubling the recipe so you have plenty. I'd show a photo, but the pancakes were eaten up too fast!

Recipe Group selection of 2/25/12.  We were split on these, the men gave them total thumbs down, the ladies were kinder.  The cream cheese was the overwhelming flavor, I wonder if ricotta would be a better cheese.  The lemon flavor was minimal, I think zest in the pancakes would be a big help or perhaps a tsp of lemon extract.  I really thought we would love these, but I doubt I'll make them again.  Thanks for the opportunity to try something new.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were delicious! Tasted like lemon cheesecake! I topped them with fresh raspberries.

This recipe was easy, tasty, different & our Valentine's Day breakfast. I substituted nonfat cream cheese to lighten them up. I posted the pic on Facebook & got several requests to share the recipe!

They sound so delicious that I might try some of the modifications that others have left in their reviews, but as the recipe stands...we did not care for the texture of these at all.

I am making them as I type this and I think they're okay.  I added lemon juice to the batter and 2T of sugar to try and get the batter to taste more like cheesecake...and it worked.  I tried cooking them over "medium" heat but for me, it was too hot and so the first few got really dark before they cooked all the way through.  I lowered the temperature and now they are coming out okay. As one rater stated, they don't rise - they are flat circles, which is odd for me.  I made a lemon glaze to drizzle over the top and the flavor is quite nice - my VERY picky 14 year old really likes them although I'm having a tough time with their texture.  Overall an okay recipe - unique and different, nice flavor but with a different texture...like flat, fried cheesecake.  

Thanks for such a unique recipe!

I thought that adding 1 teaspoon of lemon extract to the batter would be more tasty than a squirt of fresh lemon juice on top. So that's what I did and my family thought they were amazing.
Topped with butter and maple syrup and they were a winner for breakfast .
