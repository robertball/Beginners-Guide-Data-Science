This recipe is loved by our family.  We make it for holiday supper.  People are generally hesitant to try it, but once they do, they are hooked.  I always keep my toasted pecans on the side and let people add them on top.  That way they stay crispy.

Excellent!  good as a sandwich or wrap filler, too.  Try dried carnberries instead of grapes.

This was only OK.  The kiwi and grape added nice flavor, but I could not taste the dressing at all.  If I make it again, I will try to add some zip to the dressing with garlic or paprika or ginger.

I thought that the lemon with the rice was a very odd flavor.  I had to add some onion, garlic and ginger to dress it up before I even considered serving it.  It was much better with the additional flavors. I also added more olive oil.  I won't make this salad again in it's original form.

I took a reviewer's advice and added a little garlic and ginger to the dressing. I thought it was really good- my husband loved it. I left out the kiwis because they didn't look fresh in the store. Served it with grilled chicken breast. Great for a light and refreshing meal. We'll likely fix this a lot during warm weather.

My husband and I have made this recipe numerous times for guests, and each time at least one person asks for the recipe.  Great summer side dish in lieu of potatoes!  We use more pecans than the recipe calls for.
Thanks Christine!

I served the sauce on the side. Everyone tried it, but chose to not add it to their entire portion. Fun way to serve rice and kiwi, though. Used a "wild blend of gourmet brown rice," so it was kind of sticky. Guessing that's not the case with regular wild rice, but we like brown rice. This has opened my eyes to serving rice with fruit! Pecans were great as a topping. Will not make the sauce again.  Will also try the dried canberries another reviewer suggested.

Really good. I did however make a double batch of the dressing for my family's preference. If you sub Vegetable stock instead of chicken this can also be Daniel fast approved

Make more dressing than recommended.  Doesn't flavor the salad as is.  Extra dressing helps to increase the flavor.  Made with dried cranberries and mandarin oranges.

Excellent, easy salad. I added a little fresh lemon zest too.
I added the honey and lemon while the rice was warm so really absorbed the flavors nicely.
