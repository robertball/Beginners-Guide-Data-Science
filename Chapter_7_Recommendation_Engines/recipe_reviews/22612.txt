UPDATE:  4 years ago I gave this recipe a so-so review.  My skills have improved over the last few years so I decided to try them again last night.  Fantastic results!! I used Hong Kong style Wonton wrappers bought at a local Asian market and a mixture of water and cornstarch brushed on the edge to seal.  I think the cornstarch and water was really the key in keeping these suckers closed.  Also filled each with only a level teaspoon of filling.  Made about 30 total.   Be warned, they are a bit time consuming.  But worth it!

Awesome!  These have great flavor, and take very little time.  I use fresh jalapenos, (quite a few because I like them spicy), and dip them in jalapeno jelly.  Be sure your oil is at a good temperature, (I fry a couple empty wrappers prior to the real thing and make certain they brown up in 5-10 seconds), and seal the wontons with a paste made of cornstarch and water, otherwise they may explode.

These were good everybody loved themâ€¦ I actually baked these and folded them into little envelopes. I lightly sprayed Pam on both sides. And I baked them at 350 for 5 to 8 minutes on both sides. And they came out delicious.

Delicious!  The only alteration I made was to leave out the green onions due to personal preference.  I know these will be a big hit every time I make them.  Edit to original review:  We now bake these instead of frying them.  I cut a large egg roll wrapper into four squares using a pizza cutter and then tuck the squares into mini muffin cups and fill them with the cream cheese mixture.  I put them in the oven at 350 until the corners of the wrappers start to brown.  They are delicious that way.  Fried is still good, but doing it this way eliminates 80% of the work and it's worth it!

These are a litte too cream cheesey for us, so next time I would cut back on that. I had a hard time finding wonton wrappers so I found some mini fillo shells in my grocer's freezer section. They are already pre-baked so all I had to do was scoop a little filling in each, reheat in oven for about five minutes and done. Saved ALOT of time by 1)Not having to wrap all those wontons and 2)Not having to fry them. Would suggest this as an alternative if you don't want to take the time or if you can't find the wrappers. Overall, these are good.

We made these without the monterey jack, just the cream cheese and jalapeno, served it with sweet n sour sauce, or red pepper jelly for dipping.  Everyone loved them!  an easier, tastier version of a jalapeno popper!  They were a huge hit!

These were delicious!  I made these as appetizers for my Asian-themed Thanksgiving dinner and everyone gobbled them up!  I made them exactly as written and the only thing I noticed was that the wontons took a while to fold and seal, so give yourself plenty of time.  I stuffed the wontons the day before Thanksgiving and fried them on the day of.  It made approximately 50 wontons, stuffed with approximately one teaspoon each of filling.

These are fabulous! I'm not a big cream cheese eater, but I enjoyed every bite! I took the advice of others and baked them. Before baking, i sprayed with cooking spray and the puffs turned out very crispy!

These are the best!  My family is going nuts for them, and I'm having quite a time keeping them around.  I find making a double batch works best, then freezing the puffs in freezer bags.  12 minutes at 350 degrees warms them perfectly.  Considerably cheaper than buying ready made poppers - and tastes better too.

These are delicious!  We made them for Superbowl and they were a hit!  Another reviewed mentioned using the won ton wrappers to make "dessert" and we tried that too.  A slice of banana and a couple of chocolate chips were tasty way to finish off our Superbowl feast.  Thanks for the recipe and the tips.

This was just 'okay'.  I prefer the simpler, more basic recipe for the filling... cream cheese should be the only cheese; the jalapenos and garlic should be replaced with water chestnuts, and add your choice of seasons and spices.  A bit too much for a 'basic' recipe.  Less is better in this already rich appetizer.

I dont like jalepeno's, but my dad loves Poppers, so I tried this recipe for him for his birthday and WOW was it a success!!  My mom and dad BOTH devoured these and I made a double batch!  I used previous reviewers suggestion and helped to seal the won-ton wrappers with corn starch and water.  That was a HUGE help!  Time consuming to make, but worth it based on the reactions.  Made as listed.

Yum! Just like a restaurant appetizer! This was my first time using wonton wrappers. Word of advice - Use lots of water and a fork to seal or else they will pop open in the oil and create a mess. I halved the recipe and made more than enough for two people. Used reduced fat cream cheese, poppers from the garden, and cheddar instead of jack cheese.

HUGE success at New Year's Eve party the other night!  One guy kept saying that they were so "addicting".  His wife looked at me and said "Thanks.  Now I have to cook."  I'll take that as a compliment.  All I did different from the original recipe was that I used egg roll wrappers cut into fourths, fresh jalapenos processed in processor, and used a blend of Mexican shredded cheese instead of just Monterey Jack.  Am making these again for holiday party this weekend.

I thought these were just ok...they certainly do not taste "just like jalapeno poppers" as described by other reviews, although a heck of a lot easier to prepare!!

I don't know if anyone knows where to buy milder canned jalapeno's, but the one's I found (I believe they were either Ortego or Macayo's brand) were too spicy for me!!  I like the flavor of them, so I wouldn't cut back the amount...just the intensity, if possible!

Delicious!!! These came out awesome! I grow Jalapeno's and am always looking for an easier way to make poppers and this was it!  I used a package of Eggroll wrappers instead... get more appetizers out of the package if you cut the sheets into forths.  I also used this idea for pizza puffs and banana/choc. desserts.  A slice of banana, a piece of chocolate - wrap in wrapper, fry, and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar!  Very good idea!

These were easy to make. I notice when I used water to seal the edges. The cheese came out when I fried them. So I switch it up to a egg and it worked out better. Next time I'll probably put some baccon in them...

We loved these and there are just endless possibilities.  Next time I will sub green chili for the jalapenos and also want to try them with crab.  Be sure to moisten the edges and seal well.

These were really good.  I used a small deep fryer and kept the temp at 375 and none of them burst open.  It was time consuming to make them but they turned out great!           

**Note: I tried to make these again after my initial review and I reused the same oil, and the leftover wonton wrappers that I had kept in the freezer, and they came out terrible.  They all broke open and were chewy.  Definitely use fresh wonton wrappers and fresh oil.**

These were fantastic.  We couldn't get enough of them.  I made a few changes to try and speed up the process. I didn't have any green onions, so I omitted them from the recipe.  I stuffed the wontons with about 3/4 teaspoon of filling, too much and they tended to explode and the filling ouzed out when I cooked them.  I moistened the inside with a wet finger and then scrunched up the top, just like regular wontons in soup, creating a ball of filling.  I then stuck them in my deep fryer for 25-30 seconds which was at 170.  The outside turned nice and crispy which was a nice contrast the cream spicy filling.  My husband loved them and has become addicted to them.

I made these for New Year's Eve, they were great!  I used longhorn cheese instead of monterey jack and it was fine.  I couldn't find any cans of diced peppers so if you have to dice them, I suggest using a food chopper so you don't burn your fingers from the jalepeno juices.  Thanks for the recipe!

Everything about these were good except they were way too spicy from the jalepeno.  And we love jalepeno, but we had a hard time eating them.  Next time, I will use a cook quality canned jalepeno with some fresh minced jalepeno.  Thanks for the recipe!

We added bacon and baked them at 350 for 20 mins. They are awesome. I can see how they would be amazing fried though.

What a great recipe and idea. Other ingredients can be used as well. I will be trying chopped up cooked shrimp in a cream cheese mixture very soon. I obtained a package of 150 won ton wrappers for only $2 at a small local grocery store. Very crispy, tasty and yes...addictive.

AMAZING We used sharp cheddar and substituted two mince fresh jalapeÃ±os and sharp cheddar for the canned and the cheese.  Other than that we followed this recipe and are eating them again for the second time tonight.  We are also going to try freezing them to see how they do.

I made the recipe as listed, except I took a tip from another review and used a mini muffin pan. Just push the wonton wrapper down into the cup and fill. Bake at 350 until browned on the edges. My family loved them!

This was a very good easy snack! I tweaked it slightly. I didn't have green onions and I baked these instead of frying. I just VERY lightly brushed them with corn oil and baked them for 12 minutes at 350 degrees.

These were delicious! Like many others, I varied the recipe to make it what I wanted. I omitted the onions and garlic, used pepperjack cheese instead of monterey jack and I used 4 fresh jalapenos (sauteed in butter first) rather than the jarred jalapenos. The favor was phenomenal! Cheesy and slightly spicy and the perfect amount of jalapeno flavor! I followed the recommendations of others and used a water/cornstarch mixture to seal the wrappers and I didn't have any issue with them bursting in the oil like others did. The only flaw in the recipe that I could find is that 1 tsp of filling seemed like way too LITTLE! The fried wrappers seemed rather empty! That's easy to remedy and I'll definitely be making these again and again!

Very good! They are very addicting.  I used a mix of pepperjack and cheddar cheese. Also, instead of canned peppers we used 2 jalepenos which gave it a nice heat.

These are fabulous. I used cheddar cheese instead of the Monterey jack.

I could not fry 4 at a time, 3 of them would burn while I was removing the first 1. (but maybe that's just my ineptness at frying) 

Make sure you serve these right away, they get soggy (from the grease) when left to sit.

Didn't have jalepenos or onions so I used, imitation crab meat, cream cheese, fresh garlic, ground pepper, and a shake of seasoning salt.  My first batch set the smoke detector off!!!  My stove cooks a little on the hot side, so medium high was too high for me :)  Anyways, other than the first batch they were DELICIOUS!  I only had a little bit of filling but wish I had more!  Very yummy!

My family loved these. But I am only rating these 4 stars because I forgot the Monterey Jack Cheese. I also did not have fresh Jolapeno's on hand, so I used 4 ounces of jarred Mezzetta jolapeno's. 
I will try again with all the ingredients, and re-rate.

Whoo! Hot! I love them! Used 355 degree oil. Will increase temp to 375 per another reviewer.  Held well in low temp oven so I could make before guests came. My 10 yr old daughter (who doesn't like to cook) had a blast helping fill and seal them. Great time together and not a single one burst.  Per another review, DO NOT use old/frozen wraps. Too soggy.  Made 48 total.  Oh, and we called them Chinese Jalapeno Poppers so the guys at the poker game would eat them.  "Puffs" was too foofy for them.  :)

MMMM... these are really good. Tip: if you can't find these wonton wrappers go to your local chinese restaurant. They sold me 25 wonton skins for $1.50! I couldn't find them in the stores. Really easy to make!

THE BEST!  Made this for the superbowl so I doubled the recipe.  I reheated the leftovers the next day on a Pampered Chef stone and they crisped right up.  These are a very easy but very addicting snack!

I've made these a couple of times now.  I think they are just OK, but everyone else seems to love them, so I guess I will continue to make them for my guests.

These were yummy! My husband loves Poppers so these were a close second. I wish they didn't get so soggy the next day, though. They required reheating in the oven for a few minutes. An easy, tasty snack!

These were fantastic! I did have to moisten the outside edge of the wonton wrapper in order to get them to stay together. A "moistened fork" was not enough. I used cheddar-monterey jack because that was all I could find, but the flavors seemed perfectly balanced and everyone in the family liked them, no matter what level of spice they preferred. They weren't as brown as they were in the picture when they were done, but the toasty flavor of the fried wontons goes really well with the rest of the ingredients. I will definitely make them again - probably tomorrow! Lol! And for a long time to come!

Great little appetizer. Prepared them for a family football gathering at our daughters home. Too much food there and ran out of time so I froze them uncooked on a couple plates while there.  Tossed them in a ziplock bag as I left.  I cooked them up this last Sunday and they were delicious, perfect, and disappeared in minutes.  I made just a few changes, as other reviewers suggested, I used fresh JalapeÃ±os that I had on hand, added 3 strips cooked chopped bacon and also used a shredded blend of Mexican cheeses.  Going to a Super Bowl party this Sunday, making them up and freezing them today!  FYI, wonton wraps are usually always found in the produce cooler section for those new to using them. An excellent easy recipe, thanks for sharing it!

I am looking forward to trying this recipe. I loved Poppers, but my mouth has gotten sensitive to "hot" foods. This way I can make a batch using just a little mince Jalapenos and more for the rest of the family.

Just made these and they were very good. I added crumbled bacon to the stuffing mixture. I did start out using fresh tam jalapenos then, added some pickled to more flavor. I did add crab meat to halve of the batch. Next time, will use the pickled to get more jalapeno flavor throughout the cream cheese mixture.  Made about 30 with this recipe.

This was definately a hit. Next time I will however make a few changes. I will add real bacon bits as well as red pepper to the mixture.
I did bake them instead of frying and they were delicious.

This would have been a great recipe, but like another reviewer, I couldn't get the wontons to cook correctly--they broke and spilled the contents to make a greasy mess in the pan!  The filling smelled so good, but this was a large waste of time for my results.  I guess I may need more practice working with wonton wrappers???

These were delicious!  So crispy and fun to eat!  However, it took a lot longer to assemble them than I had planned.  I did a shallow fry to conserve oil, and set them on paper towel to crisp.  Keeping warm in the oven is great, but put them on a rack to keep them crisp.

I used two fresh jalapeÃ±os, left out the other cheese and just used cream cheese, garlic and green onions. I baked them at 375 for 8 mins per side. They were good, spicy just the way I like them :)

These turned out very well.  I do not recommend trying to be efficient by making the filling in advance though.  The stuff turned very hard sitting in the fridge and it was difficult to get it out of the bowl.  I ended up using the microwave to soften it before I could stuff my wrappers.

I made these for a work get together and they were the first to go. A little time consuming but worth it.  I will definitely make them again.

These fry up very quickly so I recommend you have them all assembled and ready to go before you begin frying.  I made them in advanced and into envelopes so I stored them seam side down.  They sealed wonderfully and never split.  If you make them into envelopes, start by frying them on the un-seamed side for about a minute before flipping them over.  I used fresh jalapeno and wish I had added more, but they made a great little appetizer.

Success. I ont like spicy but everyone else in my household and friends do. I made these and they were a huge success. I made a dipping sauce with hidden valley ranch mixed with sour cream and a touch of milk to get the consistency and added chili powder to get the kick. Makes tons and highly recommend.

This recipe is the awsome!  Instead of the Monterey Jack cheese I use Sharp Cheedar.  Using the corn starch to seal them worked great.  I made them the night be for the second time and although they were good I find there just a little better made same day.
