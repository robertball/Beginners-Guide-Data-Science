Without question, the negative reviews for this recipe can be explained by people not being familiar with the techniques that are used. I subtracted a star because this *is* a more complicated project than a box cake mix, and additional instructions would probably have been helpful. Things that are important to know about this recipe: 1) the vinegar-baking soda mixture is what makes it rise. This is a delicate leavening method because it does not last long. Get the vinegar mixture into the batter quickly and gently and get it in the oven FAST, or you will have a heavy cake. 2) Cakes from scratch have to be timed carefully in the oven because they're not "failproof" like box mixes. Start checking it with a toothpick 10 minutes before the given time and after that every 3 to 5 minutes until the toothpick comes out mostly clean. 3) The flour paste for the frosting must be cooked until it forms a mound that stays in the middle of the pan, and it must be cooled to room temperature but never chilled. The butter and sugar must be beaten for at least 10 minutes before adding the flour paste, to eliminate sugar grit. 4) You must frost a COMPLETELY cool cake; beating warm frosting or frosting a warm cake will produce a runny, oily frosting. Follow these instructions and the recipe *will* turn out. It is a good recipe with no errors.

When making this cake, substitute shortening for 1 cup of oil and double the cocoa for a perfect cake. The cake was dry. Icing was creamy and buttery without being too sweet.  The icing perfect.  My 87 year old mother was here and said it was very close to the original red velvet cake recipe.  Be sure to let the milk and flour cool completely before mixing with the sugar mixture for the icing.  It also needs to be mixed for about 15 minutes to be perfect.

My grandmother used to make red velvet cake, and after she passed, I've made probably 5 different recipes to replicate her cake. This came the absolute closest. It's delicious, and wows the crowds every time I make it for class (I'm in college) and even the teachers are impressed. It CAN BE DRY. So make sure you check it in the oven before it's done. Pull it out right when you think it's not quite ready. Then, LET IT SIT!! It will continue cooking as it cools, just like cookies. Do not cut it or frost it before it's done cooling. You'll thank yourself when you have an amazing, moist, incredible cake. Marriage proposals from this one!

I bake ALL the time, and this has got to be the BEST cake I have ever baked in my life.  It's better than the one my husband buys at the gourmet bakery downtown.  The cake is delicious, and the icing is heavenly.  I took this cake and two pies to Christmas dinner, and 7 people devoured the entire cake within 2 hours.

I am puzzled by the negative reviews for this recipe. I have made this cake at least six times, all with good results.  I even made it in a 9X13 pan (I had to increase the baking time of course) and made it into a "spaceship" cake for my 5 year old son who loves this cake.  I have found that this cake tastes better after refrigeration for some reason.  And, I have found it very important to chill the milk and flour combination for the icing - if the butter melts then the icing consistancy becomes runny.  The only "modification" I make to this recipe is that I use Dutch Process Cocoa instead of the regular cocoa, it has a stronger flavor.  I think this cake is better than any I've had in a restaurant.

I also have this recipe, which is our all-time family favorite.  It is absolutely the best cake I've ever eaten.  At family reunions, everyone knows to get their piece of this cake as they go through the dinner line, or there won't be any left at dessert time!  One thing I do differently is cutting the layers with a string or very sharp knife, making 4 layers.  When you frost in between the layers, and leave the sides unfrosted, it is such a festive looking dessert.  This is definately a "must have" recipe.

This cake turned out so good! I baked it in 2 8 inch heart shaped pans and had just a little bit of batter left. I recommend using paste food color (find at a hobby shop) bc liquid affects the flavor. Also, to those complaining about grainy frosting, mix it a little longer (I use a kitchenaid). The directions are so precise (does anyone else feel they're being scolded when reading this?) but not about how long to whip the frosting in the last step. It takes a little while. Keep beating until the frosting gets smooth. It will. Excellent flavor, loved it!

I haven't had Red Velvet Cake since I was a child growing up in South Carolina.  I may not remember exactly how it tasted back then, but I do know that this cake was incredibly moist and delicious!  My parents loved it so much they took a few slices home and ate them as a midnight snack.  To top it off, this cake was easy to make.  I will definitely make this again!

My grandma has used this recipe for as long as I can remember, and its amazing.  I've never found it too dry, although red velvet cake as I know it is not a moist cake.  I always watch it very carefully during baking and make sure to never over-cook it.  That can definately make it dry.  After the cake has cooled, I cut the two cakes in half for a total of 4 thin layeres.  Also, I just frost in between the layers and not on the sides.  I always pick this cake for my birthday.

I made this cake for the first time a couple weeks ago. It was just ok. I followed the suggestion of several reviews and used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe instead of the one here, because so many people disliked the recommended frosting. 
Overall, the first try was ok. I cooked the cake for the full 30 minutes. Not a good idea. It came out dry, crumbling and bland. The cream cheese frosting is what gave the cake some flavor.
I'm giving this recipe five stars because the second time I made it, it was AMAZING! I followed the recipe to a T, but used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder, and baked the cake for 20 minutes. Perfect!
I also used the original frosting recipe. I  followed the directions exactly, and was VERY dissapointed that it came out looking like curdled milk, even though it tasted good. I decided to stick to it and whipped the frosting with my beaters on high speed while I turned the bowl by hand. It took a good fifteen minutes of mixing, but when I was done, it was the lightest, fluffiest, smoothest, richest frosting I've ever made. Such a unique, but delightful cake! I do wish that the author would have added important details like the mixing necessary for the frosting, considering he/she was SO strict about every OTHER little detail. ;-)

I made this in to cupcakes for my wedding 4yrs ago and (before Kristin posted her tips, which are helpful to novices) and it turned out AMAZING, and so did the frosting, I had droves of people asking for the recipe.  :D  Now, since I've found out I am allergic to milk, I make it with non-dairy milk and and it still turns out amazing.  :D  The only thing I do a little differently is that I occasionally add an extra tablespoon or two of cocoa powder, but that's because I like it just a little more of a stronger cocoa flavor.  :)

God Bless ~Amy

I was going to submit this recipe.  It's the same one my Mom always made for birthday's.  I love it.  Be careful not to over cook the cake,  and while making the frosting keep whisking the milk and flour mixture it's to easy to get clumpy frosting if you don't.   P.S.  I use this frosting for my Whoopie pie recipe too.

I have made this cake twice now, once as a cake and once as cupcakes, and both times it came out brilliantly. Both times I used oil instead of butter, doubled the cocoa powder and got the batter in the oven asap as suggested by previous poster once soda mix added.

I think the main things to avoid issues with this cake is the following:
1. I only baked in oven for 20 mins for full cake and 15 mins for cupcakes. Any longer and would have come out very dry.
2. If you have a fan oven you need to reduce the temp by 20 degrees to 155.
3. Icing - when cooking the milk/ flour mixture you need to constantly stir this and once it has thickened you need to continue cooking this for at least a further 5 mins on a low heat and continue to constantly stir with a whisk to cook out the taste of the flour. Then transfer the mixture straight away from the pan to a plate and cover with cling film so it touches the mixture to avoid forming a skin. Then leave to completely cool. When combining the butter and sugar whisk with an electric whisk for at least 5 mins before adding the milk/ flour mix until it has a mousse like texture. Then whisk in the flour mixture but not until completed cooled and cold to touch. Whisk for a good 5 mins or longer until silky. 

The icing is definitely more effort than the regular buttercream but much, much lighter and not as sickly sweet. Of all the icings I have used on my cakes everyone always comments on this one!

This Red Velvet cake was definitely not what I expected. It could be that I have no experience with Red Velvet cake, but with this recipe the cake was much to heavy. The Icing was bland and honestly tasted like flour. Overall the cake was nothing special. However, I am willing to try it again just to make sure it was not my own fault.

This came out 100% fantastic for me, except that the frosting recipe needed to be doubled or even tripled for my purposes. I didn't modify the recipe except to add a few more TBs of shortening and 1 more TB of cocoa. Actually sifting your flour makes a HUUUUUUGE impact on old recipes like these - you cannot just stick your scoop in the bag and manhandle the ingredients like that in old recipes, because you wind up adding a ton more flour and making a dry cake. My cake remained moist in the fridge for 3 days between when I baked it and when I served it. Thanks, Eleanor Johnson, for a fantastic recipe!

This cake was really good!! I don't like red velvet cake but my daughter insisted that I would like it and she was right. She made the exact recipe -no changes. I did notice that some of the reviews said the cake was too dry... Which makes me think that some might be measuring the flour before it's sifted instead of after.

I have to give this cake a 5 star rating because it is my all time favorite!  My family recipe is just a bit different... the most noted difference being that I use 2 1/2 c CAKE flour not all purpose.  If you do not decrease your AP flour, you will surely get a dry cake.  Other modifications in the recipe 2 tsp of cocoa and just 3 TBSP flour in the frosting, and I always use butter.  When making the frosting, you Must cool the milk/flour mixture and the cake or the butter in the frosting will melt.  One word of warning, do not let your thickend milk develop a skin as it cools... you will get small lumps of it in your frosting, even if you beat it to death.  ALso, the frosting should resemble whipped cream when it is done (it takes a long time).  Store this cake in the refrigerator (especially if it is hot!)  The frosting will protect the cake from drying, but when it is cut into, cover with plastic wrap.

This cake was fantastic. This was my first try at making a Red Velvet from scratch. And I had never heard of this type of frosting before. However, a co-worker requested Red Velvet cake for her birthday, so AR to the rescue. When I found this recipe, I mentioned the different frosting, and a friend told me that it was exactly what her mother always used to make for her birthday cake every year. Her only word of caution to me was to double the frosting because she said that from her personal experience in trying to duplicate her mother's recipe, it would not go far enough. So, the cake part of the recipe went fairly easily. In making the frosting, I put the flour/milk mixture in the refrigerature to cool completely until it was needed. That seemed to do the trick, as the frosting - which I DID DOUBLE - turned out perfectly. I am amazed by how wonderful this frosting is and that I had never heard of it before now! At any rate, I cut both cake layers in half, so that I would have 4 thin layers. True to my friend's warning, even though I doubled the recipe, I still ran slim on frosting - perhaps because of so many layers. All in all, the cake was well received. My co-worker was very happy and complimentary!

I was very pleased with this recipe. I had never made a red velvet cake from scratch before and needless to say, I was quite nervous. It was very easy to make (though a bit time consuming), and it was a big hit on Mother's day. Side note: I thought 4 tablespoons of red food coloring was a bit much. I understand it is needed to make the classic red of a velvet cake, but I found that adding a bit of vegetable oil to the cocoa "paste" as you gradually mix in drops of food coloring, really alleviates the need to add so much food coloring. And you still get that nice, dark red color!

I have tried many recipes off of this site and have never been disappointed...Until this one. The coloring is great, but that's it. If I could give it less that one star I would because the cake was hard and dry as well as bland. I followed the recipe exactly and I can't believe the result I got.

This was wonderful, especially the frosting.  It was light and buttery and scrumptious.  After reading other reviews, I used my stand mixer and made sure I whipped it for a long time--probably more than 15 minutes.  It was perfect!!!

I suggested to my grandson that we could make his birthday cake this year instead of buying one (He is 11 years old, 2010).  For reasons unknown to me, he chose Red Velvet Cake, and I chose this recipe because of the nice picture and because he didn't want a cream cheese icing.  Other than using only 2 tablespoons of food coloring (that is all I had) instead of 4 tablespoons, we followed the directions EXACTLY.  He and his cousin (same age,11) who helped make this cake absolutely swooned when they tasted it.  I agree.  This was so much better than a store bought cake.  Thank you, Eleanor.  The cake was awesome.  This will be a lasting memory.

I made cupcakes and they were amazing!  This is perfect red velvet cake.  I am somewhat confused about the negative ratings.  I followed the directions exactly and they came out perfectly.  I would like to try and 'tweek' the recipe a bit for my own preferences, like butter instead of shortening and maybe less red food coloring....maybe a little healthier (if thats possible!) But as written, the recipe turned out to make perfect Red Velvet cupcakes.  Thanks for the outstanding recipe!

This cake was a HUGE success for Valentine's Day. I am so glad I tried it. 

I did use 1 cup oil instead of shortening in the cake (because I didn't have shortening), and I doubled the cocoa powder to 4 T as others have suggested. I also used "no taste red" gel food coloring, (about 1 tsp.) and it worked just fine. The cake turned out moist and soft with just the right amount of flavor and color.

The best part, however, was the icing! Be patient, cook the flour/milk slowly, whisking regularly, until it's the consistency of yogurt.  You must cook it long enough to get rid of the flour taste. And make sure it is completely cooled before adding it to the butter/sugar (whisk it occasionally as it is cooling to prevent a crusty layer on top). Your patience will be rewarded!

I doubled the recipe here to frost a 9" layer cake with thick icing, which was perfect. My family declared it their new "favorite frosting," and my son has already requested it for his birthday (9 months from now!) Thank you so much for this recipe!

It had been a long time since i had Red Velvet Cake and decided i would make one for my family during the holidays.  This particualar cake had a good rating and seemed to fit in with my baking skills. I followed the instructions to the tee and much to my disspointment and everyone else's this cake was way too dry.  The cake itself was very crumbly and dry and seemed to lack the flavor of the Red Velvet Cakes of my childhood.  I tried to make the icing according to the recipe and it was a major disaster; I ended up making a cream cheese frosting for the cake.  The icing in the recipe had a "floury" taste and was runny.  I cooked the milk and the flour until thick and added the butter and sugar after the mixture had cooled (about 2 hours) but the mixture was very runny and i ended up trashing it.  I will be looking for another Red Velvet Cake to try again next year.

I'm not sure what I did wrong (if anything), but this turned out terrible!  It could be that I'm a newbie at this type of baking, but this simply did not work.  It turned out way too heavy and tough and just tasted weird...

I tried this recipe the other day and it seems to be a good recipe but I guess I am not a very big fan of red velvet cake regardless of the quality of the recipe.
One obvious suggestion that some new cooks may miss: when making the frosting, add the flour little by little to the milk and not all at once so that 
there are no clumps!

finicky recipe! the first time I made it, it came out great. I cant remember if I subbed the shortening for butter. maybe that's why. the second time I made it, it was good but not as good as I remembered the first time. third time I tried it, I cut the recipe in half and it came out horribly, literally had to toss it in the trash! 

all I can say is that I'd rather try a recipe that is more reliable and a little less dependent on the steps. 
 
also the 1st time I tried it, I tried to follow the icing recipe and it was a disaster!

this recipe isn't exactly healthy either.
it's better to stay away and try a different recipe instead.

This cake was moist, but boring. It had very little flavor and lacked the richness of traditional red velvet cakes. The frosting was also quite odd. The flour made it almost paste-like.

I just made this cake. The cake along is good. The icing is good but if you find that it may be to thin once the icing and cake is cool. Icing the cake and let set in frig about 20-30 minutes or the icing by itself. For some reason the icing gets thicker. The icing was good before I tried thicking it up a little. And I did add marshmellows to the milk mixture. I followed the recipe but added a little more oil and a half of stick of butter for flavor. The cake was moist oh and I only allowed it to cook for 21 minutes and it almost over cooked so keep a watch and check after 15 then every min or 2 after. So try it its good and listen to kristen review on the first page its very helpful!!!! Will be making again asap! Oh I'm rating this on how mines tasted so if I did the icing right or knew to let it set in the frig it would even better.

Great texture and flavour!  I didn't have a chance to make the icing, but they didn't really need it.  Followed the directions to a "t" and didn't encounter problems.  I did have a few cocoa bits that didn't get turned red, so I might try harder to make the paste is formed properly.

BEST Red Velvet Cake EVER!  I have made a LOT of different versions trying to find "the one" and this is it.  The perfect (as long as you follow the instructions to the letter) traditional Red Velvet icing recipe follows. Thanks Eleanor!

In our family, this is the recipe known as the Waldorf Astoria Red Cake.  It is handwritten in my mother's hand-made cookbook she started compiling as a girl.  It is the only red cake we have ever eaten and is always the birthday cake of choice each year for me and my sister (and our children, who are now grown).  It was just about 10 years ago that I learned there were 'other red cakes' out there (with no cocoa and with cream cheese frosting)(I led a sheltered life, obviously), but they cannot hold a candle to this one.  In our little corner of the world, this is the only one!

This is my son & granddaughters favorite cake.  I made this cake for Valentines and they loved the cake!!  I do add 1/4 c more buttermilk & 1/4 c oil to the recipe to add extra moisture since a Red Velvet is a bit dry anyway.  I only had 3 Tbls of red food coloring but the cake was still the perfect color.  I made into 4 layers by separating the batter into 4-9" pans.  They rose beautifully and I did not need to cut the layers.  I took the cake out of the oven when it seemed a little undone in the middle (outside would spring back when touched but middle did not) to prevent the cake from getting too dry. Moistness was perfect. I doubled the frosting recipe and just put mounds of frosting between the layers & on top leaving the sides unfrosted.  Beautiful cake.  I did have a small problem with the frosting wanting to whip up.  I think I did not let my milk cool as much as needed.  I just beat the daylights out of it until it whipped up into shape.  My granddaughter requested this cake again this weekend for a gathering.  My son wants a cream cheese frosting so I will make the roux frosting for the inside & frost the outside with the cream cheese.  Great cake. Note:  I made the roux for the frosting in the microwave.  Whisk flour & milk together & zap in 60 second intervals, whipping in between to keep smooth.  Microwaves vary so follow your own instincts in the thickness of your roux.  This is how I make the filling for my cream pies.

My cake did not rise properly in the middle, It would have still been usable but then it didn't come out of the pan right, it broke in half! I generously greased so I suggest greasing and flouring the pan! The cake had good flavor but a little on the drier side.

I HAVE TRIED TO BAKE THIS. BUT I AM NOT TO HAPPY WITH THE WAY IT TURNED OUT :-( I HAVE USED SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWS SUGGESTION AND THE TASTE WAS GREAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE CAKE STARTS TO BURN AROUND THE EDGES AND THEN THE MIDDLE WAS NOT COOKED. BUT THE OUTER PARTS WERE GETTING OVER COOK. I EVEN LOWERED TEMPERATURE BUT THEN WHEN I WAS CHECKING WITH THE TOOTHPICK THE MIDDLE OF THE CAKE SUNK IN... DISAPPOINTED

My granddaughter asked for a red velvet cake for her birthday, and this was the recipe I chose.  Big mistake.  It was the driest cake I ever made, and had no taste.   I've been baking for 40 years and never had this experience before. I followed the recipe exactly.

We made this cake for the first time ever... it was a complete success! We followed the directions exactly. It came out so moist that you didn't need a cup of milk when you ate it. The only altercation that we made was a cream cheese frosting instead of the one for this recipe.  I will definetly make this cake again!!!

Not sure why this is so well reviewed. My expectation was moist and rich. This was neither. Better the second day. Frosting was very good but the cake was just not exciting. If making, be sure to read reviews for helpful comments.

omg. what a DISASTER !!! i don't know what happened. everything was going great till the part where I had to mix the flower with the buttermilk.... it became all lumpy and ended up like dough. i didnt know if that was right or not so i continued with the rest ..... it ended up taking an hour in the oven and still it wasn't cooked well... so I gave up. when i actually cut a piece, the dough lumps where still everywhere. grrrrrrr. I really had high expectations for this recipe. I dont know where I went wrong.   maybe with the buttermilk? do you guys buy it ready-made? i found a recipe for it and made it myself.

Cake is gorgeous and tastes great!  I followed the recipe exceptly except I substituted lemon juice for vinegar- no issues.  The cake is moist which can be a challenge sometimes with red velvet cakes.  I would suggest taking about 5 monutes off the cook time (obviously depending on your oven) as the tops of my cupcakes were a bit hard.  I used a different simpler cream cheese recipe...worked like a charm :)

I did not have time to search for my regular red velvet cake recipe, so I printed this one off and tried to make it.  It was a disaster -- the cake did not rise, the icing was running (it ran off the cake plate onto the cabinet).

I did not make the cake -- my 10 year-old nephew did, and it is_absolutely_delicious. It was made yesterday but I just tasted it today. My nephew said it was too dry the first day, but after eating a piece of the day-old cake I can tell you it is dense and moist and delicious and crumbles in that perfect way that great chocolate cake does. Really, really good stuff. I can't comment on how easy it was to make, however, because even though my nephew is only 10 he's a genius at everything he does.

2 Suggestions: Been making this for decades, and instead of two 1-oz. bottles of coloring, I use one bottle, then fill it up again with milk and you won't even notice the difference. (And only 2-1/4 cups flour.) Second: To very nicely frost a 9-inch three-layer, use these amounts for the icing. 6-1/3 tablespoons flour; 1-1/4 cups *each* of milk, soft butter, and sugar; and 1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla. Just right! Oh, and the instructions on the icing are NONnegotiable (but easy), to turn out! I microwave the flour and milk in 1-min. intervals to a very thick paste whisking WELL after each, and it will thicken more when cooling.

I've made this cake for Christmas every year for 10 years now, and it's always a huge hit! Some notes I've made over the years:
*For the frosting, do not use a whisk for the flour and milk mixture. Stir it until the texture is a thick paste, like the consistency of mashed potatoes - about 10 minutes. Do let it cool completely before continuing with the frosting.
*The frosting may not seem like a lot, but it is! I use some for a crumb layer and some for decorating.
*This recipe makes approximately 22-24 cupcakes. For cupcakes, baking time = about 25 minutes.
*For two 8" pans baking time = about 35 minutes.
*For a bundt baking time = about 45 minutes.

The cake part was super easy and delicious.  I'm addicted to the Cream Cheese Frosting II, so I used that instead of the frosting in this recipe.  This is the second recipe for Red Velvet that I've tried, and this is much better than the first...no lumps.

Have never had red velvet cake before, so I have nothing to compare it to but it tasted fantastic!!! Very moist and flavourful. Like many others, I doubled the cocoa and used canola oil instead of shortening. Couldn't find round pans so had to use a rectangular, took 10 extra minutes to cook. Wonderful cake!!

It's a good cake. I liked the taste. However, I could not even pick the cake back up to put it on my cake safe. It obviously needed more liquid, and honestly, I do not recommend this recipe whatsoever. Made my kitchen a mess, and made me mad.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cake was pretty dry. The frosting was also very sweet, i would have preferred a cream cheese frosting.

I gave this 5 stars but I followed the extremely helpful suggestions from "Kristin" who reviewed this recipe on Oct 19 2009. Her review is on the first page. Without her suggestions, I don't think this would have turned out very good at all. This cake turned out wonderful. The frosting was not easy to make but it was well worth it. I made this for my Mom's birthday and she said it was the best cake she'd ever had (and she is a baker herself, and very blunt person--would have told me if it wasn't so great without blinking twice, lol) I was VERY PROUD of myself. But like I said, follow "Kristin" the reviewers tips to the T. She must know what she is talking about.

I used 1c margerine and 2 cups of sugar and just a little bit less than the called upon flour and my cake turned out very good.  I creamed and creamed and creamed the marg and sugar together (with the frosting too) but I missed the step about mixing as little as possible with the flour.  I baked for 30 minutes.  Cake was most, maybe a little dense.  Will add extra cocoa next time for more flavor.  Frosting was grainy, but I refridgerated it  and mixed it more and it turned out good.

I'm sitting here exhausted after trying to make this cake. I did everything to the letter. I even watched Alton Brown's episode on cake so I could cream the butter and sugar correctly. I meticulously sifted everything.  The cake crumbled horribly as I tried to put it on the cooling rack. At first I thought this was my fault, but I went to clean it I saw completely uncooked batter underneath. However the top is dry and crumbly. I baked some good sourdough bread three days ago, so it's not my oven. I've also successfully made carrot cake just recently. Now, I'm stuck because tomorrow is a New Year's Party that I promised I would bring cake for.

Awesome!  The only minor changes I made was to double the cocoa, based on other reviews, but may try it next time with the suggested amount, and only 3 T of red coloring, which is a 1 oz bottle and was plenty of color.  (At $3 a bottle, didn't want to buy two!)  The directions are exactly right.  The baking soda and vinegar form a reaction that help the cake rise ... be prepared for foaming as you add them, and bake the layers immediately after folding in.  I checked layers after 20 minutes, but mine did take the full 30, and cake was wonderfully moist.  Did have one layer stick a little, in spite of careful greasing and flour, so may line with a circle of parchment paper next time.  Was a little leary of a frosting with flour in it, but it was wonderful!  Taste seemed almost too buttery at first, but after 24 hours, it was perfect.  A great recipe, and I'll be making this one again before the holiday season is over!

I have this exact same recipefrom my mom from the sixties,   I don't know where it originated but this recipe is the best!  The icing in the old newspaper clipping is referred to as "Ermin Icing". I was going to pass this on, but now I don't have to.  Kudos to you Eleanor,  people will love this.

this cake is the best i've made...love the creamy addictive icing; texture of cake is soft and highly delightful and enjoyable to the taste. i add another 1/2 cup of cooking oil to the shortening(as recommended by many). i baked this cake and friend's of mine said i could open a bakery shop!

This cake is quite simply amazing!  I chose this recipe back around Christmas when I needed a red velvet cake recipe to make cupcakes for a party and not a single one made it home!  It came out moist and dense and delicious, it's become a family favorite.  My brother now says I have to make him one for his birthday every year.

This is fabulous cake.  The cooks who have problems with the icing separating:  be sure to use BUTTER (not margerine) in the icing.  I used margerine once and the icing separated.  I actually use this recipe with GREEN food coloring for St. Pat's Day and it tastes just as delicious.

This cake was dry and went flat when I baked it. It was very expensive to make, and I wasted so much time and money. I also tried adding oil as others did, and obviously that was not a good idea!! Two thumbs down!!

I have made this recipe several time with success...it is moist and flavorful.  I have recently started using almond milk as a milk replacement with everything for good health and this has also worked well (using about an additional 1/4th cup).  Remember, overall scratch cakes are heavier and more dense than a box cake.  I think lots of people try scratch expecting a box cake result...will not happen.

If you follow directions there is no reason this cake won't turn out. I would however watch the video to ensure you have the steps down. Also, there are few other steps I followed reading another reviewer, Kristin's comments:check the cake after 20 mins and then check it every 3 or 5 minutes until its done; don't wait too long to bake after adding in the vinegar & baking soda mixture. 
The icing is to die for!! I haven't tasted such amazing icing in a long time. I will use this on all my other cakes. My co-workers told me, if i got to tired of making a cake, just bring in a trough of this icing! 
I also accidently used baking powder instead of baking soda, it turned out fine. I will try making it again with baking soda and see what the difference is 
Everyone at the office loved this! Will definitely make again!

I followed another reviewers advice w/ the following:
A) Get the vinegar mixture into the batter quickly and gently and get it in the oven FAST. B) Start checking it with a toothpick 10 minutes before the given time and after that every 3 to 5 minutes until the toothpick comes out mostly clean. C) The flour paste for the frosting must be cooked until it forms a mound that stays in the middle of the pan, and it must be cooled to room temperature but never chilled. The butter and sugar must be beaten for at least 10 minutes before adding the flour paste, to eliminate sugar grit.  

Even after following all of these tips, it was still quite dry.  Next time I will add a bit of oil and reduced the oven time.  Oh, for the Superbowl, I dyed the top half red and the bottom half blue in honor of the Giants.

I have never made a Red Velvet cake before trying this one. The cake turned out ok. The icing is just plain awful, it is pure butter and grease. If you are going to make this cake depending on the color you want you do not need that much food coloring, and for the icing 1/2 cup would be plenty or better yet just make a butter cream frosting and put on it. I will try making another Red Velvet cake with another recipe and definitely another icing recipe.

Great recipe! I omit the red dye to make it a plain chocolate cake. I know it kind of defeats the purpose, since it's RED velvet cake, but my husband loves this cake and is allergic to red dye. Now he can enjoy as much as he likes!

Classic red velvet cake! I tried out a couple of other recipes before making this one and it is by far the closest to what I remember my grandmother making years and years ago! Thanks Eleanor!

i've made this recipe before and when it came out of the oven, it had the same texture as playdoh which i know red velvet cake is not supposed to have. it tasted decent but it was very dry and doughy.

I was a bit disappointed with this cake. I think it most definitely needs to be tweaked. I think it called for way too much food coloring, and too little cocoa. And making a paste out of the two I felt was an unneeded step. As it turned out, my box of food coloring came with two blue dyes, no red, so I used both blues trying to get close to 4 tbls, not even close. So, it turned into a Black Velvet Cake haha. 
It was also on the dry side. Not a terrible cake, but I won't be making it again. 

And I used my own cream cheese frosting instead of what the recipe called for, and it's the best part of the cake.

I've tried several Red Velvet Cake recipes on AR and this is without a doubt the best one, but it still isn't quite worthy of five stars- so close, though! The taste is spot-on which is where every other recipe on here lacks. The consistency is what is off. The cake crumbled and wasn't dense. I even added 1/4 cup of sour cream. I will definitely make this again and play around with the ingredients to achieve the right texture. This is a keeper!

This is a great recipe.  I made cupcakes for my daughters birthday and everyone loved it.  I had looked at several recipes some called for 1c. and some called for 1/2 c. shorting so I split the difference and used 3/4c. I also only used 2oz red food coloring(no flavor red from wilton) and it was plenty red.  I baked them for abt. 20 min.  I am not an expierenced baker.  I have done this recipe 2 times the first time they sank in the middle but were still moist and delicious, the second time they rose properly but I believe I over mixed once i added the flour. They were a little crumbly but delicious.  I would definetly make this again!

I've been making this for a while now and everyone always LOVES it. I don't use the frosting here but i keep the cake recipe exact. 
This past time however I was in a pinch and didn't have shortening so I decided to use the oil substitution listed here in the reviews. It came out horrible. It tasted like a straight oil cake with a terrible slick aftertaste. There was no way I was going to give this to someone. I had to make the cake all over again.

This recipe for red velvet cake is absolutely PERFECT! I had my own recipe for red velvet cake however, was devastated that I lost it over the years. So I perused this website and reviewed every single red velvet cake recipe for one that came close to the one I had. This one was chosen above all the others - and I, my family (especially my son since this was made for his birthday), and guests were COMPLETELY & CONTENTLY SATISFIED with the outcome of this recipe for incredibly moist delicious cake!!! I followed the directions for the cake exactly (I used a whipped cream frosting recipe from this site instead - because I prefer a lighter frosting) Definitely CHOOSE THIS RECIPE if you are looking for the perfect red velvet cake. You will not be disappointed. YUM!!!!!!!!!

The cake looked beautiful and everyone seemed to enjoy it. I found it to be dry, although it had a nice flavor. I picked this recipe because it seemed to have less butter/shortening than most of the other red velvet cakes I looked at, but next time I will go with a red velvet cake that seems to promise a much more rich and moist end result.

I paired this cake with the white chocolate cream cheese frosting that came with another red velvet cake and it was wonderful.

This cake was a lot of work, but well worth it. It's so good and so rich! Don't be shy with the food coloring. The more you use, the deeper the red. I  use 1 stick of butter, instead of shortening. I also use 1/2 stick cream cheese.

Excellent cake! I didn't have any trouble with dryness as others had said.  I also split the layers so there was 4.  If you do this, I would suggest making another 1/2 batch of the frosting, which was AMAZING by the way, not too sweet and very creamy!  The amount of frosting in the recipe would have been perfect for just the 2 layers....

I've made this cake twice and both times it has come out nice. Not great, a little dry, but I'm sure if my timing would get better on the soda/vinegar part the cake will get better too. I've tried to make the frosting twice and haven't gotten good results. I wish I had someone to show me once and then I'm sure I could make it right. For my second cake I just made up a batch of cream cheese frosting and that was delicious w/ the cake. But I sure wish I could get that frosting right! It might also have something to do with my environment (in Hawaii and no central air). Maybe a little too hot in the kitchen after the oven has been on?

Followed the recipe and Kristin's suggestions from 1st page of reviews. Not really thrilled with this cake. A little dry and not much flavor. I made a cream cheese frosting using mascarpone and cream cheese, powdered sugar, heavy whipping cream and vanilla extract that was very good for the frosting.

I followed the recipe exactly, however the cake came out dry, it was a light cake, but dry. Also for some reason I can always taste when baking soda is used in a recipe (even in small amounts) and I'm not to crazy about that taste. I had Red Velvet before and honestly this cake did not taste like the cake I had, it tasted more like a chocolate cake that happens to be red. However I will try this recipe again. May substitute the shortening for oil, use less cocoa and less baking time (my oven temp is a bit off).

Loved the icing will make again.  The cake was not a favorite of mine, but my husband liked it.  So I guess I will be making it again.  I mixed the dye with the cocoa,  I would not do that again.  It made it clumpy in the cake.

This is a cake that should be made the day before eating.  Allowing the frosting and the flavors of the cake to mix and mingle for a day makes for a better cake.  This is my husband's favorite cake, and we always think it tastes best on day 2 or 3.

This is the first time I've made a red velvet cake. I do a lot of baking and figured this seemed fairly easy. I found the batter to be very thick and hard to spread into the pans. The cakes hardly rose. So, I made it a 2nd time thinking that I'd done something wrong. Same results. Because the reviews are so great for this recipe, I'll try it one more time.

This was my first time making the red velvet cake and I must it came out really well. However, instead of the shortening I used 1 cup of oil and you could use a little more sugar. Making the icing took a lot more effort then making the cake. Next time I will make the cream cheese frosting.

I made the cake for a birthday party and it got great reviews. I find the frosting too "gooey". I found it difficult to spread.  Made it twice thinking I may have not done it correctly but it turned out the same each time. If you are looking to decorate the cake with the frosting you should use a different frosting recipe as you cannot pipe it without it "melting".

Even after reading reviews and following the tips, I still ended up with a dry, metallic-tasting cake.  Perhaps I should have used oil instead of shortening.  Also, the quantity of food coloring recommended was way to much for the gel-type of coloring I had.  Too bad.

This is a great recipe. I looked at all the reviews and used some of peoples suggestions! Intead of shortening I used 1 cup oil, I also doubled the cocoa. It cam out amazing!! Everyone loved it!! I have never done red velvet before and I never thought it was this easy to make!! there were alot of steps but so worth it in the end!! Also I used homemade cream cheese frosting instead of the one given!!!

Pretty Good.  I followed the first reviewers suggestions: 1 cup of oil instead of the 1/2 c shortening, double the cocoa and took it out right before I thought it should be finished baking.  The frosting is quite buttery tasting if you like that sorta thing.  Will likely use this recipe again just maybe try out different frostings :)

This cake turned out pretty good but I would change a couple things in the procedure. I think it would be better to add the food colouring to the creamed mixture directly and mix the cocoa with the flour rather than make the paste. I don't think I had enough food colouring to begin with but the cocoa did not create a paste and I ended up with lumps of bitter cocoa in the final product. This was my first time even tasting red velvet cake so I'm not sure what it is supposed to taste like but this was delicious! I will definately try to make this cake again. I iced it with store-bought vanilla icing and it tastes fine. Maybe next time I will try the icing too! EDIT: I made this cake again and tried the icing...absolutely delicious! Made enough to cover a double layer 8x8 cake with some leftover...just spread it extra thick! Yummy!

I have made this cake twice now, and both times it has been delicious! I add 2 T extra cocoa, because I think it should have a noticeable chocolate flavor. Also, I use the Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting from this site, because that is just the best frosting in the world, and much easier than this one. Unlike some reviewers, I don't find it dry at all, you just have to watch it carefully while it bakes. YUM!

I thought this cake was perfect!  A very traditional Red Velvet cake with the traditional icing.  I made it just as the recipe calls for and didn't have any issues.  I did start checking for doneness at 25 mins, and pulled out at 27, but that is to be expected as no oven is the same.  The icing is the very best part, but I do think it would be difficult to make without a stand mixer.  I creamed my butter and sugar for at least 5 minutes, if not longer.

This was a great recipe.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  The only change I made was using butter in place of shortening.  The cake was not dry.  Just be sure to keep your eye on it and check for doneness.  My mom made a similar recipe.  I would never put cream cheese frosting on a red velvet cake.  This frosting was very close to what my mother made.  I think next time I will try it with 3/4 c. sugar instead of a whole cup in the frosting.  It is still very good as is.

This was my first attempt at red velvet cake. I must admit some feedback was helpful..i agree the vinegar and baking soda must be immediately put into the batter or else the cake will not rise so much. I stuck to the measurements and it turned out yummy.    Things i would do differently to the cake:- less flour as it made the cake a bit dry or add more butter!  Things i would add to this cake: either pecans on the outside or raspberries in the middle layer to break the sweetness!!

Wonderful Cake...stole the show at my Christmas Dinner.  The color was wonderful and with that white contrast it looked great....and it also tasted great :)  I was worried about bitter aftertaste due to the amount of food color, but there was none.   I was out of cocoa powder so I used milk chocolate instead....didn't seem to matter much.  Will make it again.

OMG, I can't believe this cake...outstanding!  My biggest surprise was the icing.  I have never made the "cooked" icing, and figured I would probably mess it up...overcook, or something.  It turned out beautiful!!  Amazing how it all went together.  I debated whether or not to double the icing because I hate to be shorted on it, but decided for my first time, I would stay with the recipe.  I had PLENTY of icing (2-layer) by following the recipe as written.  I did use the mixer for about 10 min. so it came out really smooth and heavenly.  Try this, you won't be sorry.

What a great cake! My first time cooking a Red Velvet Cake. After looking at so many other reviews, I choose this one, because of the better rating. I made this cake on Veteran's Day and it was so good, everyone loved it.    I use one stick of butter, instead of using 1/2 cup shortening. Also I use 4 tablespoons cocoa. This made the cake more tastes and so goooooood!

I tried this recipe last night and was very pleased! The 1st time I made Red Velvet Cake, I tried a box of Duncan Hines Red Velvet Cake mix and wasn't too impressed. Nevertheless, my brother likes Red Velvet so I decided to make it from scratch w/ this recipe.  It was very good. Disclaimer: I followed other reviewers' suggestions of using 1 cup of oil (instead of the shortening), increasing the sugar to 2 cups and increasing the cocoa to 4 tablespoons.  I made the frosting and it tasted very good (and was not too sweet).

This cake was a lot of fun to make, but it did turn out a little try for me. I followed the directions exactly-- I should have listened to others and checked on it a little earlier.   The icing was AMAZING and I will use it for other cakes. It spreads easily and is easy to make. It wasn't grainy for me at all either. I used my mixer. It's a 5 star icing.

Recipe is fine,except for the shortening--will do much better to use up to one cup of veg oil for this cake. The icing may be difficult for some to get right, and/or just not for everyone's taste--it is not a quick frosting, it is a cooked icing and needs some patience and time or it WILL NOT WORK (that is why I don't generally use cooked icings LOL).  I will say that the amount of food coloring you need will depend on whether you are using liquid or paste form of food coloring.  Will require more with liquid and much less with gel or paste form.  I just eyeball it until the milk starts looking bloody.  Sounds gross, I know.....The cook time will vary by several minutes depending on lots of factors--start checking after 25 minutes, as the recipe gives a guideline, not a law.  It is worth it to get a nice RV cake if you really like cake!!

inedible. followed recipe exactly and it came out bright nuclear red, spongy and tasting like flour. had to make another batch, this time used only 2 cups of flour and double the amount of cocoa which made it decent.

Came out perfect! My husband requested a red velvet cake as his birthday cake this year so I gave this recipe a shot. I took the advice of another reviewer and took the cake out of the oven just before it was completely cooked and let it sit in the pans for a while. It came out moist and absolutely perfect! I'll definitely be adding it to my cake repertoire!

Great recipe also really follow the advice they give you such as cooling the flour milk mixture etc..     My advice make 3x's the frosting part to be able to frost the entire cake.

so good. I can't take credit--my better half made it, but it's so rich, but light at the same time. Made it twice and was a hit at our holiday gathering. Tips! Make sure the milk/ flour mixture is cold, and that you whip the life out of the frosting, otherwise the butter isn't fully incorporated and it looks bad (still tastes great though)

Well, I'm going to be in the minority here. I will say that I never bake and its possible that the oven is the problem, but... I followed the directions exactly. Baked for 30 minutes and it was overdone. It didn't taste good really either. Somewhat tasted like corn bread. I might try again using more cocoa and cook for 20 minutes instead of 30 as instructed.

My boyfriend loves red velvet cake, and bragged about his grandmother's, but he he truly enjoyed this one and said it was very comparable. This was delicious and very easy to make.  I agree with the reviews that it was a little dry, so I would definitely take it out a little early.

I made this cake with butter instead of shortening, lemon juice instead of vinegar,and 2.5 tablespoons of red food coloring.  It makes 18 perfect cupcakes (for cupcakes I baked it 22-23 minutes). With the cream cheese icing recipe I got from this site it was a huge hit.  We have several fancy bakeries in the neighborhood, and everybody was asking which one I got them from.

I do not know what happened but these turned out beautiful with great consistency, but the flavor was non-existant.  I rarely have problems with recipes from this site, but something went very wrong here - there was just no flavor, sorry!

I made cupcakes out of this. They turned out very well-- a four or four and a half star result, but I found myself a little bit frustrated with the structure of the recipe. I think the different steps (ie mixing the different ingredients seperately before adding them to the batter) should be denoted to avoid any fast-reading errors, and I found it ridiculous that the instructions go from "DO NOT BEAT OR MIX NOW" to "Bake 30 minutes." That having been said, the resulting cupcakes were pretty good. This recipe is very rich in texture, though it doesn't have a lot of unique flavor. You do have to watch it very, very carefully as it bakes-- I baked my first batch for 20 minutes and my second for only 19 and there was a noticable difference. Overcooking ruins the richness of this cake, which is pretty much the basis of its appeal.

This is by far the best red velvet cake that my family and I have ever had!! It's so delicious and moist!! The one reviewer noted to take it out when you think the cake isn't quite done and I totally agree. The best by far!!

Forgot to add a couple of things to my previous review.  Oddly, I don't think the original poster mentions that this cake needs to be REFRIGERATED.  The frosting will go bad otherwise.  This cake is actually better the day after you make it--moister and more flavorful.  So making a day ahead is a great option.  Anyone who says this cake is dry has done something wrong.  When properly cooked and not overbeaten, it is one of the moistest cakes out there.  I use 8" pans instead of 9" and cook for 28 minutes.  Results in a perfect cake.  This cake can be prone to sticking, so either use parchment paper or (what I do), Pam with flour in non-stick pans.

This was different. My local baker does a GREAT red velvet cake for my birthday every year!  She won't give away any of her "secrets" so I'm always trying red velvet cake recipes to find one that tastes similar.  This was not it.  I did not use this icing, but did use Cream Cheese Frosting I recipe from this site. I will keep trying!

I have been using this very same recipe for about 40 years. It was given to me by my aunt, and is my husband's favorite. I have made it in heart shaped pans, christmas tree pan,9x13 pan and double layers. No matter how you make it, IT is wonderful!!! The frosting is also wonderful on chocolate sheet cake.. you know, the one with cinnamon in it. Those who did'nt like it either did'nt follow the recipe correctly, ot just don't like Red Velvet Cake. TRY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT !

Great cake.  If anybody thinks the taste is bad they may have too much vineger or baking soda in it.

I will agree with the previous reviewer. I followed the recipe to the letter, and it was dense and flat. Later on I tried a different red velvet cake that had more eggs in it. It worked perfectly. so I would have to say that this recipe is not really good.

I just recently had this at a resturant, and i was expecting something different. I probably did something wrong, but it just tasted like bread with icing. It is not bad, it is just not what i was expecting. 3 stars

Hands down, this was one of the worst recipes I have made in my life! Honestly, I couldn't decide if it tasted more like a piece of paper or cardboard. I would never recommend this to anyone, and I definitely won't be making it again. I followed the recipe exactly, adding nothing special. I think it would have tasted better if I didn't use shortening and substituted it for butter instead. The cake itself may have looked good, but it sure as hell did not taste it.

Best cake ever! It was moist and a combination of moist and dense. The only thing I would change is to bake it for 20 minutes not 25.

I took some of the other reviewers advice and reduced the cooking time. But even baking for 20 minutes the cake was still dry. Also I think that the recipe needs to be specific as to what kind of white sugar is needed.....granulated or powdered sugar. Most icings specifically say powdered/confectioners sugar but I used granulated sugar and it did not taste like frosting at all, more like the sweetness of cool whip. So I ended up adding powdered sugar to give it more of a frosting taste.

I made this for my son's birthday today. I prepared the cake yesterday, and finished off today with the frosting and decorating. It is a very easy to follow recipe! Moist, great texture, & a fantastic icing recipe as well. All I can say to the people who had problems is take time time,  organization is the key to cooking success.

Had this recipe for years and recently lost the cookbook in a flood.  Everyone around here thinks Red Velvet Cake should be frosted with cream cheese frosting--shudder.  So very glad I found the "right" frosting recipe again.  Many thanks.

Good solid recipe. Made it here in Brazil where the quality of ingredients can vary quite a bit and it still came out great. For what it's worth, I used a small container of Gel food coloring because it is difficult to locate 1 oz. bottles. Came out a nice bright red and good consistency.

This was my first time trying to bake a red velvet cake from scratch at home. I followed the recipe for the cake, but decided to do a cream cheese frosting for the cake. I did not like the cake itself. It came out dry, and if it weren't for the frosting, I couldn't eat it. Plus, the taste it self was sub par. Maybe I did something wrong...I am not sure, but I will be trying a different recipe next time.

Fantastic recipe. I personally add additional cocoa powder, and when I make my frosting, I cook the sugar in with the flour as it is completely smooth and light that way. Phenomenal recipe. Thank you!

Loved this recipe! I bet it'd be better if I got the baking soda & vinegar mix in faster. That and if I had used buttermilk instead of regular milk. And if it hadn't been teal. Ran out of red coloring. Anyway it was a great recipe and despite my own faults it was fantastic, 10/10 would bake again.

I have been searching for an authentic red velvet cake recipe for the longest time, and this one is the closest I've found. The cake came out SO moist, and I used one of the reviewer's suggestion to mix the baking soda and vinegar right at the end, and put it in the oven ASAP. It worked like a charm. The cake came out soft, delicious and melted in my mouth. The only alteration I made was, I used a cream cheese frosting instead of the one provided. It tastes amazing. Red velvet is my favourite kind of cake!

Thank you to everyone who posted their additions and changes to this recipe.  I read reviews on each red velvet cake recipe stuck with this one. I actually used 1 cup of veg oil and used 3 1/2 tablespoons of cocoa. I did check the cake every three minutes for the last 10 minutes. The middle of the cake still wasn't done all the way, so next time I will leave it in a little longer. The cake was very moist and oohhh so yummy. I love to bake and for my very first time making this, it was beyond good. Can't wait for the holidays

This cake was great; I would just make sure to make three layers, not two.  The rise is wonderful, but it domes more in two pans, and trimming wastes cake.  Moist and delicious!

First, I want every one to know I'm a novice baker.  I made this last night and I'm suprised it came out so well.  The reason I say this is after the negativity I have read.  I followed the suggestions of a reviewer.  Let the rue, (if you will) cool before adding to the frosting and frost on a cool cake.  It turned out okay.  No runny or grit in my frosting.  I also mixed the frosting mixture for at least 10 minutes before adding the rue.  On the cake batter I made sure to fold the soda mixture and get it into the oven quickly.  The cake was not dry.  Made sure to not over cook by checking before time requirement.  Will try again!!!

This was my 1st red velvet cake. It turned out really good but just a little dry. Just knowing how your oven is going to cook your cake is the key to the cake being moist. I didn't use the same icing because it didn't turn out very well, instead I used a crem cheese frosting. Everyone said it was really good but next time I plan to check the cake at least half way through the said time. But u can't expect it to come out perfect every time or on your 1st try.

This recipe is great. Although I'm a little confused on why it says to use white sugar instead of icing sugar for the frosting. While the taste for the frosting is amazing, I still have a litle grainy texture to it. I do beat it with a mixer for ten minutes. Could I use powerded sugar instead? And how much would I use? Again, great cake, just need a little help on the frosting.

This cake was a lot more complicated than I originally thought it would be. I did make a few mistakes, which is probably why I was a bit disappointed. However, the cake just didn't have the flavor I was expecting. It was moist, and sweet, but it wasn't what I thought red velvet cake should be. And to be honest, the frosting I used was really what sold me on the cake. I think I'll try a different recipe next time, but I did like the cake, and my family enjoyed it too.

I followed the recipe exactly and even used the extra help tips provided by Kristin.  The cake was not moist at all.  I would not used this recipe again for that reason as well as tedious in preparation.

This cake is awsome! Thank you Eleanor. This is the 1st time I've ever made a scratch cake, and it's for someone else! I made it in a cross pan, so a little extra cooking time was required. I read all reviews,Kristin's being the most helpful, thank you. I used Ghirardelli's cocoa which has a fuller flavor. When I leveled the cake and ate the pieces that were cut, WOW! My husband and Grandson also tried them. Now, it's 12:45am. I'm getting ready to decorate the one cake and have another in the oven for us! The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because it is some what complicated, and without help from Kristin, I probley never would of succeded at it. But I did follow the recipe exactly. Thanks again!

My only complaint against this recipe is the same as a few prior to me - the cake lacks flavour.  As far as the cake structure goes I give it 5 stars it was moist and fluffy.  I am new to the baking world and I found the recipe to be easy and well worded.

Made recipe exactly as stated and got a beautiful, and deliciously moist cake and cupcakes. The cakes rose beautifully also.
I also made the frosting and it was so yummy. I am just sad that it won't hold up to hot temps.
Beautiful and delicious cake. Thank You!

I think this is my first review on allrecipes, even though I've been using it for years (since it started out as all[dessert] websites).  I just wanted to say that this is a great cake and you do not need to double the fats in it like most people seem to be doing.  I used just the half a stick of butter (I avoid shortening) plus 1 oz of additional buttermilk and 1 oz of oil (since I didn't use the 2 oz of food coloring, to replace the lost liquid).  Otherwise I followed the recipe pretty faithfully and the cake came out nice and fluffy and moist with a nice crumb and even a hint of red (from the cocoa and acid reaction).  It was, however, done at an earlier time than indicated by the recipe, so check it earlier to avoid a dry cake!

The frosting was interesting and my first time coming in contact with it; I had to cut the sugar down, but this is a personal taste.  While maybe not traditional, I would flavor it in the future with a mixture of vanilla and almond extract.  By the way, this is my first contact with RVC so I'm not a purist about it.

While I wasn't thoroughly impressed with the cake, for some reason I kept wanting to eat it more and more.  So for that reason, and the really lovely texture of the cake using basically the original amount of fat called for (and NOT the 1 full cup of oil suggested by most of the other reviews), 5 start.  Thanks Eleanor!!

This cake is very moist and delicious.  I used (3) 8" pans. I did not add shortening and I only added 1tsp baking soda, 1 tsp vinegar.  Also, I used a can of beet juice instead of red food coloring (it's not as red but it was cheaper and is better for you) I made a cream cheese icing which I do NOT enjoy with this cake I wish I would have made the one the recipe called for. Baked for 45-49 minutes.

I personally do not like red velvet cake but every year my son's best friend request that I make him one. I can honestly say that this is the perfect recipe! Not only did my son's friend love it but my boyfriend devoured the one that I made for him. I even made one to take to a friend's house for a gathering and received rave reviews. This cake came out perfect, it was moist, the perfect shade of red, not too heavy and the consistency was just right. I may not care for the cake myself but I will definitly be using this recipe when I make it again.

First time I have made a red velvet cake from scratch.  Read a good many of the reviews and choose to try this one.  Kristen's helpful comments were followed exactly and I think that helped to make this cake a success.  My only comment was it was very hard to tell when the cake was "almost done"  I think poking it with a toothpick made one 9" cake pan to deflate a bit in the middle.  I cooked the full 30 minutes and it was very moist.  I didn't split the layers.. icing middle layer and on top and sides and I just had enough. Icing is a good buttery taste and quite different and fun to make.  I will use icing recipe again.  I served this at a bridge party and everyone gave it rave reviews.  Makes a very pretty presentation on the plate.

I made this cake for my husband's/best friend's joint birthday party. It was moist and delicious. The icing was good, but for some reason the flour paste left the icing with tiny little lumps in it. I'm not sure what I did wrong (and as it was my first attempt, I'm sure it was my error), but I still loved this. Will definitely make this again! (And again, and again....)

I am not sure what everyone is complaining about. I made this cake without even reading the reviews. I just did what the recipe called for. ** i did not frosting from this recipe i used a cream cheese butter cream. But either way....the cake was light and fluffy. You must be careful not to over bake.

My grandpa used to have red velvet cake every year for his birthday, and I've been searching for the best recipe for it. I think this is it! The cake is nice and moist and the icing is delicious and smooth. The recipe is a little more hardcore than others, but the result is well worth the extra care. I made it into cupcakes (baked @ 350 for 20 minutes) and took them to a family gathering. They were a hit!

Taking into consideration the reviews for adding oil rather than shortening and extra cocoa and vanilla...it turned out excellent. I don't care much for the icing.  I also found that if you use half of the required amount of food coloring and a teaspoon of the burgandy food color gel, you get a very nice deep red color.

This recipe is simply wonderful!! You must be absolutely careful about taking it out just before the toothpick comes out clean, maybe a little crumbs still left on. My cake came out beautiful, but I could see that it was starting to dry out so it's definitely the kind of cake you must be careful with. And the Frosting.. GORGEOUS! I beat it for at least 10 minutes before adding the milk/flour mixture and it's so smooth and delicious, not to sweet. Best when put in the fridge and then taken out 30 minutes before serving so the frosting is soft, but just as good if eaten directly out of the fridge. Basically a great cake, one I'll make again for sure.

I should have taken it out just before the tooth pick came out totally clean:)
[that was 2010, but since I've made this cake countless time and it always impresses] We do alternate frosting depending on whose birthday and their request we do sometime use a cream cheese frosting, but this frosting is INCREDIBLE and worth the work done correctly. 
Cake:  Sub. 1 c. oil for shortening and mix that until well blended before adding eggs.  After adding eggs we mix very well too until sugar is smooth. Food coloring paste in place of food coloring (it's thick so we mix with a little of the oil mixture). Mix this well too or you will have chocolate swirls. Sift flour BEFORE measuring.  Use parchment paper on the bottom of pan. 
FROSTING: 
The flour paste must be cooked until it forms a mound in pan, and it must be cooled to room temperature (if you put in fridge do not let chill - take it out when room temp). The butter and sugar must be beaten for at least 10-15 minutes before adding the flour paste, to eliminate sugar grit. You must frost a COMPLETELY cool cake; beating warm frosting or frosting a warm cake will produce a runny, oily frosting :(. 
Follow the other directions closely.  Best cake ever!!! When I send an invite people ask if I'm making this cake ;) Yum.

I made this cake last night for a friends birthday. I've never made a homemade cake before and this was SO good! Very easy to make, I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems. I would definatly recommend this recipe to someone. I did not use the icing for time purposes, I used pre-made cream cheese icing and garnished with coconut and strawberries.

Completely satisfied from this recipe results. The icing is the classic icing served on red velvet cake and is very hard to come by from anyone who makes it. Great results! Tip-- as others have said DO NOT refrigerate the flour/milk boiled mixture and it must be totally cool before using as well as the cake being totally cool before icing.

I used 3 eggs and used the whole bottle of red food coloring, plus a little in another bottle.  Excellent.  And I might add, I don't think it's Red Velvet Cake unless you use this frosting!! Superb!

I made this cake with my children, hoping for not only a lesson in math (due to the large list of ingredients) but a stunning red dessert, as the picture displays. We used beet juice instead of food coloring, left over from dinner. This substitution is not recommended. Not only was our cake brown, but I was sadly disappointed with the dry texture, and flavor. It tasted very similar to a chocolate bran muffin. If I attept this recipe again I think that 1c of oil would be better suited for textural purposes. and of course... red food coloring!

I am giving this four stars because it was a bit dry.  I would like to try this recipe again, maybe adding a bit of sour cream.  The cake baked and assembled beautifully.

I was so excited to make this, but disappointed with the results. We made cupcakes the night before our party and stored them in airtight plastic bags. Sadly, they were so dry the next day and the taste was just average.

This is THE red velvet cake recipe.   My husband requests this every year for his birthday, it's what his mother made growing up.  I had never made it before meeting him, but have made it every year for the 8 years since we were married.  I use this recipe because the icing is the traditional one that goes with Red Velvet cake, and also because he doesn't like cream cheese anyway.  I can't imagine this cake without the traditional icing!  Making the cake come out moist is tricky, this is not a beginner cake.  Using this recipe, though, I have now made Red Velvet my 'signature' dessert and bring it to parties and such.  The icing MUST be cooled and must be whipped for several minutes to get the sugar to dissolve.  If you don't use it right away, you must re-whip it before using.  That fixes the "cottage cheese" consistency some reviewers have had.  The cake (or cupcakes, which have become my favorite way to make this) should be chilled for optimal flavor. The icing is really best when cold and firm.

this needed alot of changes. i made it following recipe the first time, VERY DRY and non uniform color. the second time, i used 1 cup oil instead of shortening. 4 tablespoons cocoa. when making the paste, i also added a tbsp of buttermilk to it, it made it much easier to get the color right. no brown swirls. i used 2 cups sugar. beat the frosting TO DEATH or it wont come out right. all in all, my hubby was happy with his birthday cake! it was what he requested. i thought it could have been better.

I did not care for this, no one would eat it. And I make cakes all the time, even wedding cakes. This cake didn't taste good. I think it was too much flour and not enough sugar. I used another recipe for my cake and it turned out fine.

I really didn't like it; I think it had too much baking powder and wasn't nearly what I had hoped for. It's moist but maybe I just don't like red velvet cakes.

My Mom made this cake and close to this same recipe when I was growing up. I make this every year for Christmas and it is my oldest sons Birthday cake of choice. It is by far my favorite cake and the frosting is the best part!

I just made this, and it came out pretty decent. Instead of making my own icing I chose to use the store bought cream cheese icing, and it came out good. I'm overall satisfied..just not as rich as I'm use to it being...I'll have to experiment with it a little more. Thanks for the recipe though! It's a great place for me to start!

This cake is so phenomenal, I actually created an account just to comment on it. I added an extra teaspoon or so of cocoa to add more flavor. Be careful with the red dye though! Wear an apron and keep washing your hands.

Two thumbs way up!! This cake was absolutely delicious. I did substitute oil for shortening but other than that this recipe was easy to follow and the results were great. It was really moist and light the key I think is to not over bake. The icing was also amazing...I used unsalted butter. I made this cake for my sister's birthday and everyone loved it especially the icing, no one scraped off the icing.(this was the first time ever) Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!

A new favorite for us.  Unfortunately, it didn't start out that way.  On my first attempt the cakes wouldn't release from the pans, and I ended up with a broken mess.  Whipped up another batch with greased AND flowered pans and it turned out amazing.  The only changes I made (based on others suggestions) were:  added an extra 1/4 cup oil with the shortening; added an additional tbs. cocoa; and, only baked for 22 minutes.  The cake was a hit with the whole family.  I will definitely be making this one again.

This recipe is absolutely perfect.  It has the most wonderful taste and is worth the effort.  I am not good at layers so I just put the batter in a 9x13 pan and baked it for the 30 minutes.  It was perfect.  Thanks for sharing this.

I made this cake for my husbands birthday.  I layered cheesecake between to layers of red velvet.  I knew the minute i took them out of the oven i had over cooked them.  They turned out very dry.  So my only advice would be DON'T OVER BAKE THEM.  All in all it turned out pretty good.

I just made the cake not the icing, and the cake was horrible.  I bake fequently, and have made Red Velvet Cake before, but this recipe was very dissapointing.  It was very dense and dry.  It took way longer to bake than the time specified.  When I took the cakes out of the pans to cool the outside hardend so hard that it was difficult to cut into layers.  This has never happend to ANY cake I have ever baked and if I could I would give this cake recipe no star at all.

This is great.  Although, I did substitute the shortening to 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of shortening. I also added an additional teaspoon of red food coloring to the chocolate paste. I also used a cream cheese frosting. I used 3 1/2 cups of confectioner sugar, 1/2 cup of butter, 1 tablespoon of milk, 1 pk. of cream cheese and 2 teaspoons of vanilla whipped together. With these changes to the original recipes, I have never had a greater piece of red velvet cake!

I grew up with this cake and it was my mother's favorite cake!  The icing especially is my favorite! When my grandmother made the icing she did one thing different...she used water instead of milk.  I tried the milk and didn't do as my grandma did and now i know why she used the water instead.  The milk will take you TWICE as long to thicken. She also said you might need to use an extra tbls. of flour.  I just made both types and the tried and true one is flour and water for the icing base!

I Love, Love, Love this cake.  It's simple and delicious.  Just make sure when it says beat well, you really beat it for a long, long time. 

The Cooked Frosting is one I lost many years ago, and was trying to find it again.  I'm so happy to have found it here.  

Thanks for the great recipes.

Okay, so this is a really, really good recipe....BUT I don't know why my cake kept falling. I baked it twice (in one day) making sure I followed the directions to a "T" (with the exception of  adding 2 cups of sure instead of one and 3 tbs of cocoa) and each time I took it out when I thought it was done (cooking 23-26 minutes) and it still fell & sunk....maybe I should have used self-rising flour??? but each recipe calls for all purpose....hummm

I had really high expectations after all the excellent reviews, but this was a huge disappointment. It wasn't *awful* but the cake was doughy and chewy, and it tasted mysteriously like cornbread. It also was not as sweet as I would have liked. Definitely will not make these again!

i made this for my mother-in-law's birthday.  I also cut it in to 4 layers and put the icing in between them.  It was pretty.  
I thought the flavor was pretty good.  It was a bit dry on the edges but i wonder if that was because i didn't ice the sides to show off the layers?  Anyway, Pretty good. The icing was light and fluffy.. yummy.

I've never made (nor ate) red velvet cake before but I've always been intrigued.  This turned out real yummy and pretty easy. I could only find gel food coloring so mixing it with the cocoa didn't really accomplish anything.  I did end up with a lovely shade of red - perfect for Valentine's Day. I made cupcakes and some may have baked a little too long and were drier than they should have been.  The icing is amazing!  I'll be using that part of this recipe the most!

I made cupcakes, and used butter instead of shortening and added a bit more cocoa. However I used "natural" red food colouring, so mine didn't turn out very red...more like a deep purple!! I have not frosted them yet, but I must say, the overal texture of the cupcakes is lovely and velvety.....very very nice and unique.

The cake wasn't moist and the frosting was lumpy. Both were kind of bland. I may have messed it up by using cake flour...but I don't think that should have mattered.

This is the very first time that I ever made a homemade Red Velvet Cake. I wanted to suprise my mother for her birthday with her favorite cake. After reading the reviews for this recipe I decided to try this one. I was so worried about it being tasteless or dry like some reviews said, BOY was they WRONG!  This is the BEST cake recipe! It was not dry or tasteless.  The recipe says to cook it for 30 minutes, mine was done in 20 minutes. My mother just went on & on about how great the cake was. I used the Cream Cheese Icing recipe from cake II, did not put in the nuts & I doubled it & cut my 2 layers into 4 with dental floss. Man, was she impressed! haha! Even my husband who doesn't like RVC Loved it! Great recipe, don't overcook it.

This was fantastic. I have always been "afraid" to make red velvet cake because everyone said how hard it was. I followed this recipe to the very last detail and it came out perfect. In fact I also made cupcakes with it and they turned out great too. The frosting is so wonderful you could use it on other cakes as well. Thanks for the recipe.

This is my first red velvet cake and it came out wonderfully.  Red velvet is my boyfriend's favorite and I made this for him.  I used the white chocolate icing recipe from Red Velvet IV and the cake and frosting are so good.  My came out moist too, not dry.  Maybe because I took the advice of other reviewers and took it out a few  minutes before it was done and I also used three eggs instead of two.  Definitely will be using this recipe again if my family enjoys it (which I'm sure they will!)

I found this recipe to be very dry.  I made it exactly by the directions and it was a very dry cake.  Didn't like it at all!

This is just how I remember.  A classic.  If you can feel the sugar in your icing, you need to beat it longer and it will combine better.  I use only one 1 oz bottle of food coloring and then an additonal ounce of water, it turns out plenty red and doesn't dye your insides as much!

Maybe I just don't like red velvet cake, but like some others said, mine tasted like flour.  I followed the recipie as written, and was disappointed too.  (But maybe this is just the way red velvet cake tastes.)  My frosting also turned out wierd.  It didn't look at all like frosting and separated while I was mixing.  I tried to thicken it up with some more sugar, which helped but made it very grainy.  Not my favorite cake.

I read so many reviews for this cake because there were definitely some mixed results for bakers and I was using this recipe to make both cupcakes and a cake for my dads birthday party. I can gladly (and with relief ;) say it turned out really good overall! A few tips that I followed based on other reviews: 1. Mix your butter and sugar for longer than you’d expect (10-15 minutes). I did this for the icing, but failed to do so when making the batter. Cakes turned out fine but I think they would have been even fluffier if I’d been more patient w the batter. 2. Pull out of the oven at 20 minutes if not sooner. Check constantly starting at the 15 minute mark. 3. Act VERY quickly once you combine the baking soda and vinegar. I would mix and immediately fold into batter and stick in the oven in under 30 seconds. 4. The icing was nothing special IMO. I mixed it for 20 minutes as other reviewers said, but I prefer classic cream cheese frosting for a red velvet cake. Good standard recipe overall.

I made this cake for Christmas. I followed the   directions using the  tips by Kristin and everyone loved it. It was light and moist and the frosting was divine! Thank you Kristin for your tips! I forgot to mention that this was my 1st time making a red velvet cake and everyone said it was the best one they ever had! Maybe just beginners luck but I will be making this recipe more often now!

I followed your recipe but I used cake flower and Dutch process chocolate which I recommend for a better depth of chocolate flavor. . I usually don't bother with sifting but I did with this. I mixed the vinegar and soda and let it bubble up, then folded it gently into the batter just enough to mix it but didn't over-mix it or I would have lost the effect they provide. I thought about substituting butter for the shortening but I read elsewhere that this cake needs the properties of the shortening. I brushed a heavy layer of shortening in the two pans and added parchment paper on the sides and bottoms and then brushed on a little more shortening. The cake tops didn't sink. They came out of the pans easily. I make cream cheese frosting and a raspberry seedless jam filling. The cake was moist and delicious and everybody ate some because it was so beautiful when sliced. None left, darn it! Happy 60th Pat.

This recipe is good- even  though I didn't alternate between the buttermilk and flour when adding. It tasted moist and when I doubled the recipe I got 2 10 inch round pans which was good. I recommend trying this recipe.

This is an excellent and easy cake to bake. You have to be careful to FOLD in the soda and vinegar. The only concern I have is how long to cook the milk and flour for the frosting: til it's as thick as mayonnaise? as thick as peanut butter? as thick as fudge? I do it by guess and by golly and it works, but it would be good to know a specific thickness.  A good substitute for buttermilk: 1 tablespoon of white vinegar into a one cup liquid measure. Add milk to the one cup line. Wait for five minutes. And with that little substitution I have everything I need without special trips to the grocery store.

I made this cake and it tasted great, but I found out it would have been better had I used CAKE FLOUR instead of All-Purpose flour. Also, I used almost a whole bottle (the little plastic kind) of red food coloring and it was nowhere near "4 TBSP" and the cake was definitely "red." I don't know what further benefit would have come of using the full 4 TBSP. If anyone knows, I'd love to hear it!

I think I might have messed up with this cake. It was dry. I followed all of the directions and some of the reviewers suggestions trying to do everything correctly, but failed to check my cake for doneness before the 30 minutes. I took the cake out at exactly 30 minutes (was so scared that if I checked and it wasn't done - my checking would result in a fallen cake as I read about somewhere else)! Anyway, my cake was dry. :-( The flavor was good and the icing was great (had to mix 15 minutes as others stated). I think I might try again, only next time I will 1) spoon my flour into measuring cup rather than scooping as not to get too much 2) will bake 20 - 25 minutes as I think 30 was too long.

I did this recipe twice, baking one cake right after the other. As another reviewer noted, you have to beat the icing well (I used a hand mixer for nearly 15 minutes before adding the flour mixture and for 3-5 minutes after), so that you don't have a gritty icing. The icing isn't too sweet, and worked well with the cake. As for making the  flour mixture, keep stirring constantly, and the mix will get nice and thick. Cool it completely before adding it to the sugar mix. The vinegar mix is kind of crazy, because on the first cake I did, I worked quickly, and the cake came out a bit more dense than cake #2 (where I practically threw it in the oven, I worked so fast). One last note: food coloring. I used a gel food color (about a teaspoon), but if I had to do it again, I'd try the liquid. Mainly, because my batter seemed a bit thicker than on the video shown for this recipe. Either way, the cake was a hit. Good luck!

I absolutely love this recipe! Followed the directions exactly. Turned out perfect! I made mine for Valentines Day for my boyfriend. He proposed to me that day! When he finally tried the cake he wouldn't stop eating how freaking good it was. I have never made a red velvet cake before. This recipe is definitely a keeper! The frosting is devine! Wouldn't change anything! Just make sure you keep an eye on it while it's baking. My cake was done earlier than the actual bake time. This recipe was actually featured on the "Better" show. I was sold on making it after I saw how beautiful and delicious it looked on TV!

I baked the cake too long and cooked the roux not long enough, so the cake had a crust and the icing was a bit soft, but the recipe is excellent, you just have to *follow* it. Also I don't think the color is important (has nothing to do with the flavor or anything) so I used vanilla-infused rum instead of food coloring to make the cocoa paste.

I ate a lot of batter and frosting while making this cake, so now I feel sick, but happy...

The cake came out dry after baking the required amount of time, and the frosting didn't come out FLUFFY! I had to add additional powdered sugar to even get it to the right consistency. I don't know what I did wrong, but I cooked the flour and milk to a 'thick' consistency. I want to find a different recipe to use in the future. One that isn't so dry and the frosting comes out better.

Definitely the best recipe I've found.  Just like my grandmother used to make.  It is a complicated recipe... you really want to be ready to take the cake from vinegar and baking soda to oven in as little time as possible.  Also with the icing don't use any kind of spreadable butter.  I had an issue where I didn't have enough butter and had to do a small substitution with spreadable butter and the icing came out lumpy.

I have now made this recipe multiple times with slight variations (to follow), and this cake is a universal success. It never lasts more than 48 hours at my house, and is requested by family and friends alike. It has become known as "that special chocolate cake you make" (I can't get it to go red with the food colouring available where I live, so it usually comes out light brown). My teenage son's friends even ask if I've baked one when they come over. Yes, it is that good, and thank-you, Eleanor Johnson!
Tips: Double the frosting (or icing or butter cream). Do not try to shorten the sugar-dissolving time by cooking it with the milk/flour step, as it will fail. Add the cooled "pudding" a tablespoon at a time, and beat, beat, beat. 1/2 cup of oil as opposed to shortening is sufficient for tenderness. I find that the full cup suggested elsewhere results in an excessively oily consistency. The shortening in the original recipe is fine too though. The vinegar/ baking soda as a leavening agent results in a uniform surface, which is really nice, as opposed to the doming from baking powder cakes.

I tried to make the icing three times before I decided not to waste any more materials. The cake tasted bland and it was nothing special. Don't waste your time.

I 2 USED BUTTER AND MAYBE ABOUT A 1/3 CUP OF OIL. 3 TBSP OF COCOA AND USED WILTONS NO TASTE RED GEL (2 BOTTLES) TASTE WAS GREAT, BUT WAS STILL ON DRY SIDE. MY BF THOUGHT IT WAS FAB BUT I THOUGHT IT COULDA BEEN BETTER BUT IM A HUGE PERFECTIONIST WHEN BAKING. I USED CREAM CHEESE FROSTING. WILL USE ALL OIL NEXT TIME I THINK

I used butter for the shortening and gel dye. I made two batches (separately) and stacked it into  4 round layer cakes. it was wonderful, fancy and delicious! I also doubled the frosting and was sure to whip it well.  It too was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

this  recipe is wonderful. I did some  modifications such as add up  1 tablespoon of cocoa powder and  1/2 cup of shortening,  and the result was awesome.. it's darker and more moist..

This cake is AWESOME! I had never made red velvet from scratch before and it was absolutely delicious. My husband is not a big fan of cakes but this rocked his world. The icing sounded like too much work so I used Cream cheese frosting II instead and served it  after a few hours in the fridge. Before serving I added shaved white chocolate and everyone loved it.

I have never made a red velvet cake before, so I was going in blind. It turned out bad. I used the suggestions of the other reviewers and used oil instead of shortening. It made the cake cook soooo uneven. The bottom was perfect, the sides were over cooked, and the top was dough with an oil film on top. So I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I would love any suggestions. I would love to make this cake! :)

It tasted fine, but was really dry.  I did everything according to the recipe (even used a brand new can of baking soda).  I tested it 5 minutes before the time was up and it was very wet (stuck to toothpick like crazy). But after the last 5 minutes it was too well done.  We ate it, and my boyfriend said he liked it, but I thought it was way too dry and dense. Will try another recipe next time.

First time I've ever made a red velvet cake & it was delicious!  Since it's my friend's favorite cake & she came in from California tonight, I wanted to make it for her.  She said it was just like hers that she makes every Christmas & she loved it.   We ALL loved it!  I used the original recipe with no changes.

I made cupcakes with this recipe and I have to say that intially I was very worried because the batter was SO thick, I thought there was no way they would turn out. So while they were baking I sat here and read ALL the reviews (only 1 other mentioned the thickness of batter)  waiting nervously and here is what I think: The texture of this cake is probably the best I have ever baked. It was fluffy and moist like you would expect a cake to be. So I was very excited about that, but the taste I was not so excited about... I still rated this cake high because I loved how nice it turned out the color was very nice also..I think next time I will increase the amount of sugar and cocoa I put in and maybe decrease the salt and flour just a little bit...

Made this last night for my roommate's birthday and it was a big hit.  Everyone raved about it all night and it was even better for breakfast the next day ;)  Definitely a winner and the very first recipe I have ever saved to my recipe box.  Will be making this again for the next birthday!

I followed recipe to a T. First time ever making a cake from scratch!!! This one was not to bad,maybe a little too much flour. In certain bites I almost taste flour, maybe my fault. Would have loved some cream cheese in my icing.Almost tasted like a whipped topping.The cake is very moist. I will make this cake again!!!

My cake came out with a strong baking soda flavor.  It was inedible.  However I am going to give this recipe 4 stars, because I'm pretty sure that it was more my fault than the recipe.  The whole baking soda/vinegar thing I didn't really understand. I would say this is definitely not a cake for beginners.  Or at least try baking it once before you make your real cake.

This is the best recipe that I have found with a few changes. I did follow the reviews and used 1 cup of vegetable oil and 2 cups of sugar. The cake was very moist and delicious. Next time I will use maybe 3 tablespoons of cocoa for more flavor. I didn't love the frosting, although is was good, I just prefer cream cheese icing with red velvet cake.

This was pretty bland, fairly dry and not really worth the effort. I made it twice (just to make sure it wasn't something I did wrong) and it came out dry both times. I won't be making this version of Red Velvet Cake again. I did NOT make the icing in this version, I used a cream cheese icing recipe I have at home.

My rating if for the icing - it is EXCELLENT!  Used it on cupcake.  Next time will make a double batch.  It was best after we put it on the cupcakes then put them in the refrigerator.

i did almost everything in my power to mess up this recipe.  no buttermilk - used skim milk and vinegar; not even close to enough red food coloring; subbed butter for shortening; of course didn't sift flour...  i made cupcakes and they turned out delicious!!  i frosted them with my own recipe for cream cheese icing and they were fantastic.  thanks!

My guests liked the cake but I made the mistake of trying to bake this in a 9x13 pan which left the middle of the cake dangerously undercooked (since I was obviously overcompensating for my fear of overbaking it). I ended up making 2 cakes and then forming a much smaller cake from the cooked portions of the 2 9x13 cakes and then icing the whole thing to keep it together. I was disappointed that it didn't have more flavor even after I added 2 more tbsp of cocoa powder. The poor thing nearly shattered when I cut into it. Probably won't be making this one again.

A wonderful cake recipe.  Admittedly, a bit dry, but that's nothing a glass of milk didn't help.  My only problem was that chunks of the bottom of the cake stuck to the cake pans, but that was my own fault for being an airhead and not greasing them enough.  I will definitely be making this cake more often, probably for my dad's birthday every year since he loves chocolate cake and his favorite color is red.

Yum! I am a relatively new baker. This cake was pretty easy, I just made sure to get it out of the oven pretty quick since the overwhelming concern about it possibly being dry. Icing was simple and very good! One alteration- I doubled the amount of cocoa and used the dark version.

This cake was great! I cut the recipe in half and got 12 perfect cupcakes. Now lets talk about the icing....It took FOREVER to cream the sugar and butter. The grainy sugar took a long time to get smooth. And then by the time it was ready to add the cooked mixture, that must have cooled too much and got clumpy. No amount of beating/whipping woulg get those clumps out. I served them anyway - to  some friends, who said the taste was amazing and I could call it tapioca icing. I will definately make the cake again, but that icing needs work.

I have never made a red velvet cake before. I read all the reviews and have always wanted to give this pretty cake a try. I cook from scratch so following the ingredients was not a problem. It turned out moist, and looked beautiful. The roux based frosting was just "ok", but I always follow the recipe the first time. so moist cake, very pretty I think I'm just not a fan of red velvet. So not a horrible cake, just not my favorite.

I don't care for the flavor of this cake. It seems like a lot of work with only mediocre results. I believe I followed the recipe correctly but maybe a more experienced baker could have made this better. However the icing turned out pretty good. I won't be making this agin but thanks anyway.

This was my first velvet cake and it came out perfectly!  I did not use any vinegar because that sounded gross (hehe), I used 1 cup of butter instead of 1/2 cup of shortening, I used half the food coloring and I also used baking powder instead of baking soda since I didn't have any baking soda.  I made all of these changes and it turned out moist and fluffy.  I did not use the icing.  Great cake!

My Family loved this cake! I follow the cake recipe and it came out great!I didn't however use the icing recipe, I found a great buttercreme recipe from another viewer on the site and its much easier to make and goes well with the cake.I did take the cake out a little early(still not early enough) my oven cooks a little fast, but over all it came out great!

This recipe got such a great reaction from everyone who tried it--so much so that I had to make it TWICE in one weekend! I made it into 20 cupcakes was grateful for following reviewers' suggestions to double the cocoa powder because the flavor was just perfect for a red velvet. Two qualms: wish it was a tad more moist (although no one else seemed too concerned about that) and, more importantly, the icing had some problems. The white sugar the recipe called for came out tasty, but grainy. Not to mention it looked more like cottage cheese than buttercream. I'll use confectioner's sugar next time for sure! One last tip: you'll need two of those large red food coloring bottles to meet the 4 tbs requirement. I learned that the hard way.

This was my first attempt at Red Velvet Cake and it turned out...pretty good.  The cake was good but the frosting was not so much.  It turned into a goopy, seperating, mess of sugar and butter.  So I recommend the cake and not the frosting!

I tried following the recipe exactly, and the cake turned out heavy and extremely dry...gross!  Then I followed some of the other suggestions and used 1C oil instead of shortening and an extra egg.  It was so much better and yum!

This was disappointing, it didn't have the fluffy texture I was expecting and wasn't as chocolate-y as I wanted. Next time I will: add an egg, add tsp of baking powder and an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa OR 1/4 cup melted chocolate.

I've never eaten red velvet cake, but I've heard that is one of the most delicious cakes in the world.  So, I decided to bake this one and well, ti was a disaster.  I had to do something wrong, although I cannot figure out what it was.  I followed the advice of other reviewers to remove the cake early and it was still overdone.  The cake came out a pinkish color (not a chocolately-red color) and was a little bland. The icing really needs to be whipped longer to fully dissolve all of the sugar into the frosting.

This was my very first homemade cake. I made this for my Mom for Mother's day. The cake turned out pretty good, other then it didn't want to come out of the pans, so it was sorta crumbly. The icing was A joke. Later I realized I didn't use enough butter, this was my fault. Can someone tell me what the trick is to getting Smooooth icing, instead of lumpy cottage cheese like frosting??  The cake was dense, somewhat moist, and a Pretty deep red!

The only thing that saved this cake was the icing.  It was dry as toast and just about as flavorful.

This cake was delicious! I made mock petite fours with it. Like otheres, I used the cream cheese frosting II. On my second try with this cake, I threw in a bunch of ingrediants of my own and the cake was even better! My new boyfriend says it is the best Red Velvet cake he had ever tasted! I am making surprise cupcakes with it for this weekend. I'm going to WOW is friends for my first time meeting them!

Even though I had to substitute apple cider vinegar for white vinegar, my cake came out well.  I topped the cake with a cream cheese frosting from this site.  My family enjoyed the cake.  Great result. Thank you.

This cake was awesome! I am a big red velvet cake fan and this did not let me down. I left out the vanilla and added an additional 1/2 teaspoon of cocoa. I took the advise of other reviews and took the cake out after 20 min and the texture was perfect. I also had a bit of swirl, not sure why I mixed the crud out of it. I used a cream cheese frosting and not the one listed with the cake. Aside from the alterations listed above I followed the recipe to a t. Will make this again for sure!!

I tried this twice and was disappointed both times. The first time it took forever for it too cook on the inside but the outside was hard as a brick, the same thing happened the 2nd time even thou i put i flower nail in the centre to make sure it baked even.  I followed the suggestion of 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of oil to make it moist but i don't think that helped. The taste was blah. Red Velvet cake is just chocolate cake with Red food coloring, so i think i`ll just stick to plain old chocolate cake.

Ihave tried this recipe a few time because it had such great reviews. This just must not be my recipe. the first time I made it the cake was dry and a little bland. The second time I made it I got swirling. the third time I tried the suggested changes others made and it stuck to the pan. Not a sure fire cake I have to say it is being booted from my recipe box.

Made cupcakes from this recipe. They were gone so fast I didn't even get one. Had one person come up to me and say "this is the best thing I've ever had in my mouth" - and an uncle of mine (who's favorite cake is red velvet apparently) said they were absolutely fantastic. The frosting is so worth the effort - just melts in your mouth, perfect topper to the cake.

I baked this cake for Valentine's Day and I first baked a tester batch and halved the recipe and it was PERFECT. But when I went to bake it for reals something went very wrong and they had such an odd taste. The only thing I can imagine going wrong was mixing it incorrectly. But the frosting was great. I thought it was kinda odd at first but it was so different and complimented the cake well (when I baked it correctly anyways)

Terrible.  I followed the directions exactly and the cake didn't come out as pictured.  The outside was somewhat crusty and hardened, and because the author incorrectly instructed to add the flour/milk mixture to the creamed mixture, the batter came out lumpy and showed after I cut into the cake.  The icing was grainy and watery no matter how much I mixed it, and I let everything cool completely before doing all that, as instructed.  The icing called for granulated white sugar which is not ideal for icing.  I knew that, but I stupidly followed the instructions anyway.  You should use confectioner's/powdered sugar for icing, not granulated sugar.  The cake was also dry and held little flavor.  I do not recommend this recipe.

I thought this cake was awful.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if that's just the way "real" red velvet cake should taste.  I had only made a mix and loved it.  I will continue to use the mix when I crave red velvet whether it is the "real" red velvet or not.  I had never heard of this icing recipe before and it was good but very rich.  The icing is the only reason I gave this 2 stars.

Great recipe, but a little trouble with it. I've made red velvet cake before, the same recipe. I couldn't find mine and the only difference that i could tell was that this one had more red food coloring and coaco. The problem was that it took nearly an hour, 57 minutes, till the cake was done. I used 9 inch heart shaped silicone pans that maybe had to do with it. Surprisingly even after an hour, it was the moistest RVC that i have ever had it, but it was SO dense! LOVED IT!!!!

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  The cake was inconsistent; one cake fell apart when I removed it from the pan, the other came out fine.  The color was great, the texture was smooth but very dry and the taste was obsolete.  I wouldn’t make this recipe again.

I've never made a Red Velvet Cake before, this was my first.  The directions are very precise, and I thought the results were pretty darn good.  It was a little dry, but that could be because I made cupcakes and they might have been a little over baked.  I skipped ahead in the directions and had already added 1 tsp of baking soda to the flour when I realized it should have been added to the vinegar.  I ended up mixing 1/2 tsp of baking soda with the vinegar instead.  I baked the cupcakes for 20 minutes, and next time I will check them earlier.  Also, I didn't have any liquid food coloring, just the paste food coloring, so I just added that to the batter until the color looked good.  Haven't frosted them yet, but the cakes alone are pretty good!

This cake had an excellent flavor, although I would have like it to be a little more moist, it is still a keeper.   I did not make the frosting suggested, instead I made cream cheese frosting...it was perfect.  It went well with my daughters "clifford the big red dog" birthday.

The cake was delicious. This icing didn't turm our at all it was runny and really lumpy and looked like baby pablum. It did taste good though. Next time I make this cake I will probably buy icing instead.

i'm only rating the icing. i don't know what happened but my icing turned out terrible.  it was more like a glaze, and i was hoping for something stiffer to dollop on cupcakes.  this was not it.  i left it in the pot and my husband threw it out while he was cleaning.
--UPDATE--  i tried the icing again, this time with granulated sugar.  i could feel the grains of the sugar and it wasn't very nice.  the taste wasn't either.  it was too much like eating soften butter.

I've made a lot of cakes, pies, and main dishes off of AllRecipes, and this was my first disappointment.  The cake was flavorless, the icing was runny, with a butter/sugar taste.  Try a different Red Velvet recipe first.

Never had Red Velvet Cake and thought I would like it. Unfortunately, I/we definitely didn't like this recipe. Not the cake or the frosting.

I made cupcakes, and they turned out great, at least according to my co-workers. Moist with good chocolate flavor. I did double the vanilla and increase dutch coco to 2 & 1/2 tablespoons, as suggested by other reviewers.  I also undercooked them a bit. The red food coloring only came in gel form at my grocery, and once I got it home, the tube only measured out to 1&1/2 tbls!  But it was plenty to make the cake red, thank goodness!  A great novelity dessert.

This cake was a disappointment.  the frosting was flavorless - just butter and gritty sugar.  The cake was flavorless as well.  Made it for my daughter's birthday and no one at the table finished their piece of cake. Oh well, on to another cake recipe.

This is an excellent recipe.  The frosting is very good.  I followed the suggestion of another review and took this out when it was almost done.  (Toothpick still had a little goo) I took it out and let it set. When we ate this it was perfectly cooked and I might even say dry. (typical for red velvet)   I will definitely make this again if not make the frosting for another cake!

This came out bad for me.  I subbed butter for the shortening and might have overbaked by 3 or 4 minutes, but neither of those explain the dry tastelessness that was the result.  I can't get them out of the (well-greased) silicone mini muffin tin.

I personally thought this cake was just OK. I'm glad I tried the recipe before making the person birthday cake with it.I followed the recipe, but maybe I messed something up. I made half of it with cream cheese icing and the other with the butter cream icing. I have to say that I noticed that the next day the half made with cream cheese icing was more moist than the buttercream icing. Overall this cake was very dry to me and I ended up using the Wilton red velvet recipe. I never throw any sweets away, but this went in the trash after a couple of days.

This was okay, but definitely not my grandma's red velvet cake.  Mine turned out very dry, but I know so much goes into play with moisture - weather, ingredient temps, etc.  Thanks for the recipe, but I think I'll just keep working on grandma to get her to write down her recipe.

This cake was DELICIOUS! If you make it exactly like the recipe says it should come out just perfect. I found that the original recipe amount doesn't make 2 9" pans but only 1.

The cake was dry and lacking in flavor.  The frosting was DELICIOUS!!!  I loved it and will make this frosting over and over.  I will never make the cake again.

Followed the recipe exactly, and I even waited until the next day to try it. It was dry...definitely needed to be followed by something to drink. The icing wasn't great either, it tasted a lot like butter with sugar in it. I added 1/2c sour cream to improve the flavor and that helped some.

I make alot of cakes from scratch so this was an interesting one for me to try as I only had red velvet cake once and that was about 20 years ago so I don't remember what it is suppose to taste like. First, I couldn't find liquid red food coloring in my area. I had the paste kind and that was impossible to make a paste with the cocoa so I ended up just dropping the red coloring paste into the creamed mixture. No problem there. So why even bother with making the paste with cocoa?  Since I'm not sure what this is suppose to taste like, it does not taste like a chocolate cake but there is a hint of chocolate. It had its own taste which I am having a hard time describing and slightly dry and that might be because of the vinegar/bak.soda being folded into the batter?? Its dryness was actually not a bad thing in this case. Regardless, i guess because it has its own taste that it is actually good and I plan to make this more often in the future. I made my own white frosting.Being that I don't know what it's suppose to taste like is why I'm giving it a 4 star. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made this cake for valentines day. It turned out very well. I was the first cake that I made completely from scratch. I was actually really suprised about the amount of coloring that is in this cake. Anyway, It turned out to be a hit with my boyfriend and with my parents :) Thanks for a good recipe!

The cake was wonderful.  I had a hard time with the icing, but that might just be my inexperience with these kinds of things, it tasted great, but the texture wasn't like it should have been.  I took it to a super bowl party and had none left to bring home!

I would make this cake again, absolutely. It is rich and moist. I would add more sugar because the cake was not really sweet enough with just 1 1/2 cups of sugar, so perhaps as another cup of sugar.

I used Betty Crocker cream cheese icing with crushed pecans because I could not get with adding flour into my icing. Other than that, love it!

it was made for the birthday celebration of one particular family member who isn't a fan of the bold rich dark chocolate cake she likes the delicate essence of the chocolate so that's was the recipe that I polled thank you it was a success the first time around and with it being paired with a delicate buttercream orange flavored frosting it makes for the perfect bite the flavor of the red velvet cake is very delicate just a hint of a whisper of the chocolate works perfectly with the buttercream orange frosting. That is one custom made cake for my beloved 82 year old mother. thank you for making her birthday celebration of success.

This cake was very phenomenal and turned out way better than I expected. It was my first time ever baking a cake from scratch so I was pretty nervous knowing that this wasn’t as simple as a vanilla or chocolate cake. I did one adjustment that other users suggested which was substituting shortening for a cup of vegetable oil. To make sure that my cake was moist I added about a fourth of a cup extra butter milk. Scared by other reviews, I wasn’t sure that my cake would come out moist, but it sure did! I baked it 10 minutes less then suggested and turned out perfect. Thank you for this amazing recipe, will be my go to from now on.

Great Red Velvet recipe, but the icing recipe ends up being basically just butter, leading me to believe the recipe erroneously calls for one cup when it should be one stick. Using two sticks gives you not a frosting, but a sweet butter-like substance you can perhaps spread on toast

I made this cake for the first time for a church bake sale. Not only was it pretty, but it tasted fabulous! I intended to use cake flour, but I didn't have enough in my cabinet, so I ended up using half cake flour & half all-purpose flour (sifted).  This was also the first time I baked a cake using shortening, not butter. Thank you to all those reviewers who insisted on checking the cake early! I baked four pans (for 2 two-layer cakes). I set the timer to alarm 10 minutes before the recipe cook time, and sure enough, some of the pans finished sooner than others. I frosted it with a delicious cream cheese frosting. My cake slices sold out at the bake sale! Luckily, I saved a few slices for myself. The only advice I will give is to be patient; this is a batter that can't be rushed, except for getting it into the oven after incorporating the baking soda/vinegar mixture.

I have made this cake for years, but, lost my recipe awhile back, and a grandson is celebrating his 16th birthday and requested it for his cake. I was so happy to find the real red velvet recipe like mine that uses the cooked icing. Not the cream cheese icing offered so much anymore that takes something away from it for me. Thank you.

Just got into baking and this was my 2nd ever cake. It turned out awesome.  Cut the bake time by about 5 min for my gas oven. It was very moist and delicious!

This is a true red velvet cake recipe. I particularly like that it uses the butter roux frosting, which is traditional for this cake. Only 4 stars, though, because the recipe fails to mention that a very important part of this cake is getting it into the oven IMMEDIATELY after adding the baking soda and vinegar. The reaction is what causes the cake to rise and have that lovely, red velvet texture. The heat of the oven causes the reaction to continue. If you wait until the reaction stops before you get the cake in the oven,  you won't get the best texture.

This is hands down the best old fashioned red velvet cake! My MIL requests that I make one every year for her birthday. It is not like box cake, so don't expect those results. This cake has a slightly crumbly texture.   The vinegar/ baking soda is the rising agent. Once you've combined the two you want to move quickly to mix it into the cake batter and get the cake into the oven. 
This cake takes patience, but it's definitely worth it!!

I have made this cake 4 times now and I have absolutely LOVED it every time. It also continues to get easier the more I make it. 10/10 would recommend this recipe to anyone, especially people who are not frosting fans (like myself and my family) because they cannot get enough of it!

Oh my gosh!!! I am so happy and very surprised!!! This recipe has been in our family for many generations. As the story goes, my grandmother, who was from Baltimore, Md., said that her father (my great grandfather) somehow managed to get this ORIGINAL Red Velvet Cake from a chef at one of the most famous restaurants (at that time) in Baltimore. He made my grandmother promise to ONLY share the recipe with very close friends and family! Though generations, we RARELY share this recipe... And you are correct, it's a 5+ STAR and difficult to make. But NEVER, have I ever seen the recipe in the public eye until today!!! I have had well known chefs taste it and beg me for the recipe.

instead of the buttermilk as we are lactose intolerant I used 2 tbs of vinegar and the rest was soy/almond milk to make a cup. and cut the flour by 1/2 c. this turned out moist and fluffy. Never had red velvet until this recipe glad we tried it.

The cake came out light and fluffy nor was it dry. My one bit of advice is when you mix in the baking soda and vinegar to the cake mix put it in the oven as fast as possible so you won't have a heavey or flat cake. I also didn't try the frosting I just used one from the store so I'm not sure how good that is.

I love this recipe!  It was just as good as any I have had.  I love the shortening and sugar, granted it takes longer to make then most cakes but well worth it.
The frosting is a recipe I have been looking for for over 30 years.  My mom used to make it all the time but the recipe was lost.
My family loved both the cake and frosting.
I have since experimented with different colors to make a yellow velvet cake with purple and green food coloring.  My family likes that it is unusual and has the velvet texture.

I am an experienced baker, I have made hundreds of cakes and rarely have ones that don't turn out. I have only tried red velvet cake a couple of times, so maybe I just don't know how it's supposed to be. I really liked the flavour of the cake, I did add a little more vanilla, . I was very careful with timing, but it still came out dry. After they cooled, I brushed them with simple syrup and cut each cake to add an extra layer of icing to each. Everyone loved it, but I am going to try another recipe.

Great recipe but does take a little time to make. Only used 2oz of food color.  For the icing I made 1 1/2 times the recipe but next time will double. Used confectioner sugar instead of granulated sugar. This cake is better cold and freezes well. Also split cake layers to help moisten up cake.

Just like it should be. You can add an extra egg to help with the dryness. It’s a dense cake. The icing is perfect. Do not overbake!

Amazing cake, my new favorite recipe.  Instead of liquid food coloring, I used AmeriColor gel paste, which is very concentrated.  It didn't take many squirts, so I added water to get to the required amount of liquid.  I didn't make the frosting recipe though; once I used cream cheese frosting and once buttercream.  

Start checking the cake long before it should be done.  Once I made half the recipe in a 9" pan, and it only took 22 minutes to bake.

Awesome! I've always like Red Velvet Cake but I really love this recipe! Cake was moist, not too chocolatey and the icing wasn't too sweet. Everything worked together well. I didn't think it was complicated at all. It did take some time to get the sugar to blend and get rid of the grainy texture in the icing. But the time spent was well worth it. This is my favorite new cake recipe!

I made the cake only from this recipe. Thankfully someone posted additional information about the recipe which made my cake amazing. It is the most moist delicious red velvet cake I've ever eaten. We wanted a cream cheese frosting which is why we didn't make the icing recipe included here.

I haven't tried the cake yet, but I have to rate the frosting! Wow, that is the most amazing frosting I have ever made! Not too sweet, spreads like a dream, can't wait until afternoon tea to try the cake and frosting together!

I’m a pretty good baker so it’s not like I have no idea what I’m doing. The cake was too heavy and I attempted the icing twice and even had my grandmothers help, she’s baked for all her life, and both times it turned out very runny, even if the milk was thick enough. I don’t plan on using this recipe again.

This cake recipe is absolutely delicious and beautiful! My sister in law’s aunt had this recipe back in the 20’s. She carried the tradition of making this cake only during the fall and early winter. Mainly because of the icing.

I do not know what I did wrong. but the cakes stuck to the bottom of the pan even though I greased the the pans really well. When I went to cool the cakes, the cakes stuck to the cooling rack so my cakes are pretty beat up. The only thing I can think of is that I bake the cakes for too long. I baked them for 25 mins.  Going to try again but turning the cakes I made into truffles, cause I can't recuse the cakes to make a 2 layer cake.

i have been trying recepies from AllRecepies for a long time and the recepies have been good. However, i am dissappointed with this recepy my son wanted a red velvet cake and it didnt taste good and i followed the recepy. The icing tasted like flour making the cake state like it was uncooked and the as for the cake itself the cake tasted bland. My family did not like it and they always like my cakes. Ill try a different recepy for red velvet in hopes that i have better luck.

I followed the directions for the cake exactly.  I used a cream cheese frosting instead of the one in the recipe.  The cake was very crumbly.  It baked up beautifully but when I cut it, the cake just fell apart and it tasted very dry.  I will definitely not make this cake again.

Rate 1 star because the recipe is well written, easy to follow.  I did not make any changes.  The top of the cake was hard, it had no flavor, and was not moist.  I love red velvet cake, but this was inedible.  My family and I tasted the cake and threw the whole thing away.  I did not make the icing.  I would not make this again and would not recommend it to anyone.

The cake portion of this recipe is really good! However, my hubby and son prefers my homemade butter cream cheese frosting over the one that accompanies this recipe. I gave the recipe five stars although the frosting wasn't that good. I didn't want to subtract a star for mere personal preference of frosting taste.

A great cake...easy and straightforward...I made this along with my 9 year old Grandson..I don't like using food colouring therefore substituted beet juice... The colour was a dark brown with a reddish hue, small price for skipping the artificial colour.  The icing was very interesting, sort of a cross between regular frosting and pudding.  This cake was a hit with my family and will definitely make it again

Pretty good. I made changes as suggested by other reviewers (i.e. Additional cocoa and vegetable oil instead of shortening). My cake kept burning just a bit on the outside (I tried twice) - I believe it's an oven issue. Ended up just cutting the outer perimeter off and serving. Great reviews from my family. :-) Thanks!

This cake was absolutely awful. I felt like I should throw it right in the garbage. I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't have any issues baking it and the texture of it came out fine. I did substitute the icing for my own cream cheese frosting because any good red velvet cake should have cream cheese frosting. The issue was the flavor. It was so bland and disgusting. This is nowhere near the level of other red velvet cakes I have tried or baked. It should've been a red flag to me when I saw the type of icing that came along with this cake. Yuck! I'll be throwing this recipe in the trash along with the cake.

FROSTING suggestions ONLY--Use unsalted butter, regular sugar.                                    
This is the frosting I was raised eating then making--I heard my mother refer to it once as--what I thought was--"Aramine" frosting and about broke the internet and several search engines looking for it.  However a chance encounter with the word ERMINE steered me in the right direction.  This recipe is a variation of the buttercream, probably actually  predating the one that appear on confectioner sugar boxes.  That is why you must follow these easy suggestions exactly--or you will wonder what all the fuss is about.  If you do--you will have the lightest frosting that is sweet but not cloyingly sweet (it is after all, FROSTING).  
1)  Stirring the flour mixture while it is thickening is not optional--you aren't making white sauce--it only takes a bit and if you want something really unique--do the work.  2) Allow it to cool on the countertop--IF YOU CHILL IT

Added 3 TBSP of cocoa, used only 2 TBSP of food coloring which was plenty (cake color was perfect), used 1 stick + 1 TBSP of unsalted butter and 2 TBSP of vegetable oil, instead of shortening.  Made a cream cheese frosting instead of the one listed with this recipe.  Cake was moist and tasted great.

I followed the recipe for the cake exactly but used the cream cheese frosting recipe from the site and added pecans to the outside to decorate it. It was amazingly delicious! I was a bit worried because the batter wasn't especially sweet but the combination of the cake and cream cheese frosting was fantastic. I'm not a huge fan of chocolate cake so I was happy that a minimal amount of cocoa was in the recipe. I had my nephew and sister in law taste it and they both gave it 2 thumbs up and requested I make it for Christmas dinner.

This cake turned very well after a few minor modifications. First, we mixed all ingredients at once. It is quicker and easier. For the icing, we added the secret ingredient of Gatorade powder. Only one tablespoon, don't overdo it. Also put all of the icing ingredients in at once, and put it in the freezer when mixed. Leave it in for around 15 minutes and then add to the cake. it's  called the earthquake cake

Made this a couple weeks ago. This happens to be the exact same recipe my mom used to make that she got from her grandma. Came out perfect. I used cool whip instead of icing so as not to be so rich, and covered in chocolate chips, just like my mom used to do. Highly recommended!!!

I did exactly what I was told. The cocoa Colour was more prevalent  and the cake was very clumsy and condensed. Disappointed

Yes definitely a technique to this cake  . . . now i understand why it was such a big labor of love when Grandma Great Made it for her children, grand children and great grandchildren.  This recipe was just about perfect to hers.  It is a read the recipe recipe, meaning no short cuts .

So delicious moist and light. Only thing I'd change is to add 1/2 cup extra of flour as batter was extremely thin. Tasted gourmet all the way definite crowd pleaser

This was a great cake, and I got a lot of compliments on it! I stuck with the icing in the recipe, though most red velvet cakes I've had have used cream cheese icing. I may find a different icing recipe next time. 

I followed the instructions exactly (including those so graciously provided by Kristin) and the cake turned out well. BUT, as others have noted, the 30 minute bake time is too long. I checked the cake at 20 minutes, and the toothpick came out coated in batter. At 25 minutes, it was bone dry, and parts of the cake were just a hair on the dry side (but perfect with ice cream). Next time I'll shoot for 22-23 minutes. It finishes FAST.

As far as the icing, I again followed Kristin's instructions, and beat the butter and sugar FOREVER. I never got the grittiness of the sugar to go away. However, once it was all combined, it made a nice creamy icing, sweet, but not overpowering. 10 minutes is probably sufficient.

Definitely a crowd pleaser!

I didn't have enough food coloring, so I just used 2 Tbsp. color, plus 1 Tbsp. water, and it came out great.   Perfect recipe.  Work quickly with your baking soda & vinegar and this will turn out wonderfully!

This cake is amazing! I doubled the cocoa, but that was the only change I made. The cake was so moist, and stayed fresh  for a week. I only had 2 tbsp food colouring, but that was enough. Lots of flavour without being too sweet.

I used this as the base of a Red Velevet cheesecake. (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/217390/red-velvet-center-cheesecake/#recipe-toolbar) The texture is dense enough to use as the base of the cheesecake, but was still light and fluffy.

When someone says Red Velvet, this is my go to recipe. The frosting is the original frosting. Not the overly rich cream cheese. The frosting is called Ermine frosting.

The only reason I am giving 3 stars is the icing. I cannot for the life of me figure out how this recipe makes icing like what is pictured. I made it TWICE! exactly like it says and it is yellow, gritty and runny. Now, that being said, I am using a hand held mixer because I simply don't have a stand mixer (really wish I did)! That will come after I get out of nursing school. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but the icing is horrible! The cake is pretty decent. I bake things all the time and use this website as my main source. I like to think I know what I'm doing. My family loves the things I cook and bake, so I don't know what went awry this time, but I suppose I will try it again. I will be looking for a different icing, however. I don't understand why it's so yellow and gross looking when the picture of this recipe looks so beautiful. Any suggestions? And please don't cuss at me or be rude. I am simply stating what I did and what I think. I hate it when people put me down for saying what's on my mind. If you don't have something positive to say, please keep it to yourself.

This is how to make a true red velvet cake and FROSTING.  My family has had this exact recipe for years.  This is especially good served cold, but certainly not necessary. Takes time to make because it is worth it!

I made it and it doesn't look anything like the photo. Is it possible for a cake to look sad?  Hope it tastes better than it looks, as I'm risking a bout of poisoning otherwise.

Honestly, the recipe was good. The cake didn't turn out too red like a normal red velvet cake would be like but that's alright. We followed the directions exactly and we got a might fine looking cake. After putting our own homemade icing, we cut the cake and ate it. It tasted and smelled a lot liked flour but that was our mistake, not sifting it before adding it. I'd make it again, this time sifting the flour.

Followed the directions but switched out the shortening for butter. Cake was moist but had no flavor.... not sure if the shortening is what gives it flavor. 
Did not like.

Yes, this cake is complicated but if you follow the instructions of others before you, it will be the best Red Velvet Cake you have ever made. 

 I would make the milk/flour first. It MUST be totally cooled before you can use it for the frosting.  I made my frosting in the Kitchenmaid, turned it on and let it beat for about 20-30 minutes.  Its the creamiest frosting ever. 

The vinegar and soda tip is crucial, therefore your pans must be ready and your oven pre-heated. Once vinegar and soda are combined your are on a timer. Get in the the oven!

Really wish I'd read the tips in helpful reviews first. I think I made a few "rookie" errors. 
I let the cake bake too long, and it came out dry and tough.  I also didn't beat the frosting long enough.  I will admit to not being a fan of the frosting. It tastes like sweet butter, not frosting. At least to me. My Mother would probably love it! 
My family really likes it, but I think I could do a better job. 
Because it is a more complicated recipe, I do think the extra directions in the recipe itself (not just in the comments) would be extremely beneficial.

I actually got this recipe several years ago from a friend, after a discussion about a restaurant nearby who had the best red velvet cake.  As it turned out, this was it!  I am curious about why the food color and cocoa needs to be mixed this way.  Some recipes mix all dry ingredients, all wet, and then mix together.  That would make this an easier procedure but I've never tried it because...  I love this cake the way it is!

This is probably the most historically accurate red velvet cake recipe on the site... but that doesn't mean that it will suit every palate. The recipe dates from the Great Depression, when luxury foodstuffs like sugar, butter, and eggs were expensive. That's why the ermine icing with its measly 1 cup of sugar and that's why there's only 2 Tablespoons of cocoa in the recipe.  But that economy makes for a bland cake, and I find that I prefer more modern recipes that double the cocoa and use cream cheese frosting instead.

Seriously follow the instructions carefully. If you use gel colouring make the cocoa paste with warm water and stir the gel colouring into that.  Rave reviews every time i make it. So freaking delicious. I use a different icing but this on looks yummy enough.

This was my first time to try and make or even eat a red velvet cake. Everyone loved it now people are giving me requests to get one on birthdays. Personally I think red velvet is not my kind of a cake but maybe if I make one or two adjustment to the recipe like adding more cocoa. I read many reviews before hand and so I was careful not to let the cakes over bake so they were still moist. The one area I did have a problem was the icing which is why I put 4 stars, it still took on a slightly curdled appearance even after doing all the beating that was recommended. I figure that it could have been the type of butter I used (it was salted coz thats all I had available so the icing was a bit too salty for me next time will make sure it is unsalted). Also I think the colder the icing mixture when beating the better the consistency that comes out. Will keep giving it a go and as with any recipe you always make adjustments to your own preferences. Happy baking!!!

Adjustments for high altitude... My boyfriend requested this specific cake and recipe for his birthday. He was very specific that he wanted the buttercream, not a crea. Cheese frosting.  I had never made it before and we live at high altitude, so I had to make some adjustments. 

First, I followed the advice on this site... Made sure everything was well cooled... Made sure the flour paste was very thick before taking it off the stove, whipped the buttercream for about 15 minutes, worked quickly and only baked the cake for 20 min instead of 30. It all made a difference. 

In addition, I made high altitude  adjustments...  Cut the sugar in the cake mix by 2 T... Cut the baking soda in half... Added and extra yolk to the mix for moisture. 

The cake turned out very moist and had an even, nice rise. 

For the frosting, I recommend using bakers sugar (aka: superfine sugar). It blends better and does not leave any graininess. 

Overall, turned out exactly as it should have (reason 4 stars instead of 5 is because personally, I'm just not a fan of red velvet cake... But it wasn't my birthday, so it didn't really matter :-)

It was difficult to get right and you need to follow things correctly  I made a huge mess of the cake when I tried to put it on the cooling rack, yet it still tasted awesome. Such good flavor.  Will make again.

It was already 60 mins and I took it out. Inserted a cake tester and a goo cake out sticking to the pin. I threw it back to the oven and my God it came out well! it just needed a longer baking time (my oven). It's fantastic!

I tried this recepie as red velvet is my granddaughters favorite. It was delicious! However, it came a little dry. Not sure what I did? I still gave 5 stars because my cake rose and did not fall! Icing was by far the best home made I ever made. So worth the extra effort. The freshness was appreciated by all!

It was a bit dry, and crumbled a lot, but that could have been baker error. The frosting was delicious and easy; I'll definitely make it again, for different cakes too!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out great. It is some work but the comments of the other cooks helped.  I will reiterate the most important ones.  Don't overcook the cake, if in doubt, take it out.  The flour and milk must be heated to at least 185 degrees but it doesn't hurt to bring it to a simmer and, if you don't want a flour taste, it should be cooked for 20 minutes.  Everything absolutely needs to be at room temperature before the icing is made and the cake iced. I used organic sugar and Irish butter and the icing was a little grainy and yellow.  OK since I was making green velvet cake but I would recommend white superfine sugar for the icing.

I've just made this cake for Valentine's Day. I did struggle with the icing which hasn't turned out as I had hoped.  I let the flour-milk combo cool thoroughly, but my icing tastes like plastic and isn't stiff and fluffy.  I added some powdered sugar to stiffen it but it still has that look of butter separating.  I've popped it in the fridge to see if that helps.

Yummm! The only red velvet cake I'd made before was from a box, so I was not looking forward to making another red velvet cake when our Thanksgiving guest requested one. This cake was DIVINE! He, and everyone else, LOVES it! It's the next morning as I'm writing this and I've already had 3 slices of it. It won't last through the night ;) I followed top reviewer Kristen's suggestions and that really helped me out. The frosting definitely reminds me and my husband of cool whip, just a smidge bit more dense. I want to try a cream cheese frosting next, but this is really great as is. I will make this again and recommend the recipe to others!

This cake was good. This was my first time cooking a cake from scratch and it turned out ok. The cake tasted great but my cake  fell and it came apart when i took it out the pans to dry. The icing was ok also but I think next time I will try cream cheese. The overall appearance of my cake was not good but the taste of the cake was good.

I did not make the cake just the frosting.  It was great.  Make sure you mix it long enough. The flour mixture did not look tasty, but once added to the butter mixture it makes a wonderful frosting.

I didn't use the cake recipe, only the icing. Excellent! Didn't change a thing and would not change a thing. However, even having read the most useful comment, I still managed to under beat the sugar and butter. I didn't check before I added in the milk mixture and only realized as I started icing the cake that the sugar particles were still not dissolved. No problem, put the icing back in the stand mixer and beat it for an additional 5 minutes. It became even fluffier than before. First time making this type of frosting but will definitely make this again.

I have made this cake many times and with great success.  I do not change one thing about it, make it just as written.  I was requested to make it for a fundraiser, and the people bidding on it knew about it.  It raised $54.00!  I was pleased and so were the ones who got to eat it.  I iced it with cream cheese icing, placed fresh raspberries around the diameter and drizzled loganberry syrup around the edge to drip down.

This recipe is great. I make it exactly as written and it wows people every time. Some tips: Start checking cake at 20 minutes and take out of oven when toothpick comes out ALMOST clean. When it comes out clean it's already a tad too dry. Let your eggs and buttermilk reach room temp before starting. Once you mix you baking soda and vinegar move fast but still gently. I made with this frosting and w/cream cheese and liked it both ways. I prefer cream cheese though =)

Today (11/3/2013) is the third time I've made this cake. This is the third time it's been absolutely delicious and PERFECT.

Great texture, great crumb, great flavor, great look.

However... I used gel food coloring instead of liquid. Used about 1.5 tablespoons of the gel coloring and the color is just great. Your mileage may vary, however.

People giving negatives: Try again. You may just be doing a step too quick or not right or maybe even missing something. I am a completely novice baker (only started baking about 2 months ago) and this cake is a hit with everyone so far.

I am the baker for a resort restaurant and am extremely familiar with the baking techniques used in this recipe. 
I've been getting requests for red velvet cake and decided to try this one since it had good ratings, and I will continue to look for a recipe.
I followed the recipe EXACTLY and my cake just crumbled. Completely non-salvageable.

I have to give the crumbles a 5 star, they were very tasty and moist.

This is the best red velvet cake recipe I have ever tried. The only "issue" was the baking soda/vinegar folding. The cake rose perfectly though.

Thank you for this recipe!  This cake and icing recipe is THE BOMB.  The icing, oh my God, the icing.....  It reminds me of an old fashioned cooked icing recipe like my great aunts and grandma used to make.  Spectacular!  It takes a little more time but it is SOOOOO worth it!  I followed directions exactly, except I doubled the icing recipe so I could make sure I had a really nice thick middle filling layer and enough to convert the icing for detailed decorating.  For those who are new to the art of from-scratch cake-baking, I would suggest reading some of the high rated comments to get more detailed direction.  If I could rate it a 10 I would.  Best cake ever!

I've made this recipe for many functions. People always tell me this is the best cake they've ever had. The frosting is not too sweet and very different. It was even a request for a wedding cake.

The cake turned out perfectly!!! The frosting recipe is not right!!! I think I made it with the wrong butter or it says to put to much in. Awesome recipe but I reccomend a different one for the frosting.

This was great, subtituted milk and lemon for buttermilk. I have made it  twice now, but each time I make it!, the cocoa is always seperated from the red food colour, what am I doing wrong can anybody help me? Used veg oil instead of crisco.

Wonderful, authentic recipe with amazing results. It just takes a LONG time to cook the icing, the only reason I rated it four stars instead of five. But, boy, was this a hit! It's especially fitting as a Christmas desert with some green sugar sprinkles on top.

I have not tried this cake, but I have used the frosting many times and LOVE it!  This is so worth the effort, (it is alittle more time consuming as you have to make a white sauce and chill it, and then beat it for what feels like hours) but it turns out to be the best frosting!  Great for chocolate cake or when you are looking for something less sweet than your typical buttercream frosting, and I am sure it would be great on red velvet cake which always seems to be made with cream cheese frosting (which I do like, but prefer on carrot cake!

I made this cake Sunday. I have to say it is very good, the whole cake is gone. I did just a few changes. I used 1 cup of oil instead of the shortening and I did a cream cheese frosting with pecans on top. Next time instead of baking for the full 30 minutes i will take it out 3 to 5 minutes before time to see if it will be a little more moist.This cake for some reason a day or two after making it, it tasted even better. I will be making this one again for sure.

This was my first time using food coloring when baking and BEWARE.  It's pretty hard to find traditional water-based food coloring these days so I had to use gel (or icing) food coloring.  I didn't think there would be much of a difference, but I was quite wrong. Food coloring in general isn't tasteless and using too much will make it noticeable, but gel has an even more intense... off-putting flavor.  The cake baked very well, had a good consistency and you could tell there was deliciousness to be had, but lightly masking that was the taste of the coloring.  I still give it four stars because it was my own lack of info that had it turn out the way it did, but this is a pretty difficult recipe.

My son has always raved about red velvet cake, so he is my measure of excellence on this.  I made this for valentines day and he said it was the best he's had!  I found the recipe easy to follow and worth the few extra steps to achieve such a beautiful and tasty result.  I did make cupcakes and I baked them for 18 minutes.  I gave some out to friends everyone raved about them.  Thanks

This is almost the exact recipe that has been part of our family holidays since 1945.  we used a little less cocoa in ours.  Our family cuts each cake to make 4 layers instead of 2 and the sides are not to be frosted.  The frosting is very important.  Please, Do Not Substitute Cream Cheese Frosting-- for this butter roux frosting. The cake tastes best if refrigerated a few hours before serving.  It seems the frosting sets up better.  Careful with the vinegar and soda, too.

I got this recipe from my mother in law several years ago, way b4 the red velvet craze of the past couple of years. It is a Christmas tradtion in the whole family...and a birthday tradition now too. My kids always ask for this as their birthday cake, I just change the color to match their favorite color. Speaking for myself I make it better now then I did the first few times I made it. Yes, it requires following instructions that you are not familar with, but it's worth it and it sure beats a baked red velvet cake...which is bland and tasteless!

I made this recipe for my daughter's 13th birthday. It was an instant hit with my family. I did double the icing recipe as recommended by others. I also made the cake on the weekend previous, sliced the layers and froze the cake, then I took it out of the freezer, prepared the icing and iced the cake the night before.  She wants this again for her sleepover with some friends, but wants to try purple this time.

The taste was very good. I was a little disappointed that it used food coloring because I'm always looking for red velvet cakes that obtain their color from the cocoa. I had problems getting it to rise using the method described, and probably over folded it before baking.

Delicious.  I served this at a cook-out and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly after reading the reviews.  It was not too dense and tasted great.  I will make it again with some applesauce or I'll take it out just a whisker earlier - I prefer very moist cake. The frosting was unusual to me, but tasted very good. I plan to try a vanilla buttercream for comparison.  Thanks for sharing this-it's a keeper!

I made the some minor adjustments as recommended.  The frosting was okay but I guess I'm more of a cream cheese frosting type of gal.  The cake came out perfect.  I used two bottles of the red food coloring (out of curiosity) and it cames out to a gorgeous deep red color.  The cake looked like Christmas red against white frosting.  I will definitely make this cake again!

Soo wonderful.  The cake was light and fluffy and absolutely delicious! I used water and beet juice instead of food coloring- it wasn't red but everyone still enjoyed it.  The frosting was absolutely amazing.  So light and buttery  this is going to be my go-to red velvet cake recipe for sure!

I followed a few reviews and added a bit more cocoa powder. But that made this a chocolate cake. It was tasty and very moist. Flavors were much better the next day. I used the highest rated Cream Cheese frosting from this site & it was a good mix. Still hunting for the perfect Red Velvet Recipe...

This cake is decent, but not amazing. It is definitely dry, perhaps if I try this again I will add a package of chocolate pudding. I would've given it four stars for taste alone, but the frosting killed it. It tastes like flour, and it comes out really yellow in color. The texture is also wrong. I would definitely use a whipped cream frosting, or cream cheese. I know it's not "traditional", but the cake really needs something other than what it calls for.

Everyone I know is still raving about the cake, I however felt that it was not chocolate-y enough, and will definitely be add more cocoa next time.

Rich and chocolaty (and really fun to put green frosting on at christmas) The only reason I give this recipe 4 stars is that I cannot seem to keep the cake together when getting it out of the pan. It sticks no matter what I try and the bottom of one of the cakes always sticks and I end up gluing it back together with icing. But it tastes so good that nobody ever notices my little surgery.

I double checked to see if I followed this recipe correctly...I did but it turned out extremely dry and tough.  I see that someone else recommended using oil instead of shortening and I think that would have made a huge difference.  I wouldn't try this particular recipe again.

This cake was alright. I read many of the reviews before baking, so I adjusted it. First, DON'T bake it for the suggested time. My cake was in the oven for about 23 minutes and that was definitely enough time. Second, I used a cream cheese frosting from Paula Deen. (Basically, it's just a pound of cream cheese, 2 sticks butter, 4 cups sifted confectioners sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla blended together) I also didn't cut the cakes, I just did cake, frosting, cake, frosting. I think the cake layers would have been too thin otherwise. But that's just my preference.   The cake was pretty good though with these changes. I'll probably make it again.

So it turns out that I don't really like red velvet cake.  That being said, the people to whom I fed this cake that do like red velvet cake thought it was divine!  Followed the recipe for the cake and the frosting exactly.  Did not have any trouble at all with the frosting separating or being grainy.  I will use this recipe again for sure! (SIL has a birthday coming up...)

This was delicious!  I was in a hurry and didn't read the instructions carefully and it still turned out very yummy.  I also doubled the cocoa powder, I thought it was just the right amount of chocolate flavor. I ended up not making it with this recipe's frosting and a made a cream cheese frosting.  Very good, will keep this in my recipe box.
