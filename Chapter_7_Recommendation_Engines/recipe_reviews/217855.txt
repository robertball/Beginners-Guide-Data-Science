This was wonderful! I have some pretty fantastic posole soup makers in my family and this recipe could give them a run for their money. Very, very flavorful. I made it EXACTLY as the recipe instructed. Good & authentic tasting. This recipe has made it into the soup rotation file.

Followed it exactly with the exception of using chicken stock versus broth. - the Hormel Always Tender adds great flavor and IS tender.  Garnished with shredded red cabbage, sliced radishes, onion, fresh jalapeno, cilantro, shreded cheese and fried corn tortilla strips.  My teenage son really does not like soup and he had 2 bowls and wanted a 3rd.  Hubby said outstanding and a "keeper."  I love it because it is super easy.  I do highly recommend the garnishes it just makes it extra special.

I used 2lb pork loin and browned it with garlic salt and pepper before putting it in the cooker.  My family loved it!

Omitted the chicken and doubled the pork. We had this for Christmas Eve and LOVED it!  The pork was just a regular one from the store's butcher shop, but was amazingly tender still.  Will definitely be making again!!

I live in Mexico and I had another recipe for pozole and it was terrible, the hominy was to tough to chew. I tried this version and it was delicious and tasted like the restaurant around the corner besides. Used a mixture of pork and chicken, but went heavier on the chicken and lighter on the pork.

This turned out great.  I took the advice from one of the posts to brown the pork first.  I also used only pork...two pounds.  Served with sour cream on the side for people who don't like things spicey.  My two year old ate it with the sour cream and said "MMM".

I thought I would try this recipe based on the reviews and I was pleasantly surprised how wonderful this was. I made exactly the way the recipe stated and topped with avocado slices and crushed tortilla chips.  I will be making this again perfect for a crowd.

We did not care for this.  Not only was it very bland when served, the meat was dry and it was visually unappealing.  Only the addition of lots of hot sauce when drained made it editable.  I followed the recipe and only cooked on low for 7 hrs.  I should have known better than to cube pork and chicken and then cook for so long.  Perhaps if the meat was left whole, it would have been juicy.  Thanks for the recipe but we'll not make this again.

Excellent!  I made this on the stove and used only pork (1 1/2 lbs).  I sauteed the pork and onions and hten added everything to the pot and simmered for an hour.  It came out delicious and just enough spice.

I have made this twice and it has been a hit both times.  I substituted the chili with a chopped chili in adobo sauce and the chicken with two cans of pinto beans (14.5 oz).  When I made this recipe with the chicken the first time it came out rather dry in the slow cooker, and I also wanted to reduce the amount of meat in the recipe.  The pinto beans were a good substitution.

This was a hit!!  I didn't use chicken since my bf insisted it should be all pork.  Everyone loved it!!!  I left out the bay leaf since I didn't have any and used Italian seasoning and chili in the recipe.

This was delicious! I made it with some left over pork carnitas that we had and didn't use any chicken. It was a little heavy on onion but I had a really big onion. I will definitely make it again!

We cook Mexican food all the time and my family is extremely picky. While this isn't quite like abuelita's pozole, it is extremely delicious. Will definitely make again.

This turned out really nice. I omitted the dry chili because I didn't have it but otherwise followed the recipe. Silly me went a little heavy on the  green sauce. I was eyeballing 1 cup and ended up with about one and a half. It turned out very spicy but delicious.

This is my favorite recipe for Pozole!  I did brown the pork and chicken in butter and garlic first.  Just to give it a little color.  Also used chicken thighs instead of breasts. The first time I made this, I left out the dried chile pepper.  That was a mistake.  It added great flavor! I used thinly sliced cabbage, cilantro and radishes for toppings. Yum!

My husband and son LOVED this. It was a little on the spicy side for me,  but I'm kind of a spice wimp - so I will give it 5 stars based on their review. It was my first time using a dried chile. I think next time I will not only remove the stem, but also slice it down the middle and remove some of the seeds inside. The only change I made was that I used all pork. It was a very tasty, satisfying dinner. When I make it again, and I will, I will cut back on the amount of meat. 2 lbs was a lot of meat compared to the rest of the ingredients.

This is quite similar to the recipe on the back of the "Maiz para Pozole" that you can buy here in Mexico City.  Seeing as the recipe is by Herdez, that doesn't surprise me.  The big difference in the two recipes is that the Maiz recipe uses several chiles (two different types) and this one uses only one.  This is perfect for our family because my kids, while they are adapting, are still not huge fans of spicy food, and this Herdez recipe does a great job of toning it down a bit.  We use this recipe often (it's a fairly easy tasty meal, with the slow cooker) and substitute chicken for all the pork as my husband doesn't eat pork (although I made it with all pork when we had guests, because traditionally in Mexico City, pozole is made with pork).  I serve it with cilantro and Mexican cheese for our family.

My family totally loved this!  I didn't use the pasilla or the green chiles as my family doesn't like their food too spicy.  I used only chicken breast and added more hominy as we love our hominy.  Will be making this all the time as it is much much easier than the traditional red pozole and by using chicken it is better for us.  I think next time I will use chicken thighs as the breast does seem to be dry for this recipe.

It came out delicious. I'm a fireman and made this for 11 guys, most of whom have never tried pozole, they loved it. If it can pass a firehouse test you know it's good. I browned the meat before and had to quadruple everything to feed the number I did.

There's not much I don't like but unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed with this recipe. Followed the instructions but the meat was dry. It seemed like it just needed more to it feeling like I was eating a bowl of meat and liquid. I probably won't make this again.

I have been a pozole lover for many years. Although not Mexican by heritage, I lived in Mexico for a year and enjoy real Mexican food. My wife and I were very pleased with how this recipe came out. Like others, I used only pork tenderloin. I also dredged the cut-up tenderloin pieces in flour and then browned them in a skillet with olive oil. I deglazed the skillet with some of the chicken broth and added the "drippings" to the slow cooker. The only other change I made was to substitute taco seasoning for the cumin; I was out of cumin but had a package of taco seasoning. It worked fine. I look forward to making this again.

I had some left over pork loin from the night before and made this Pozole over the stove without using the chicken. It was AMAZING. It didn't need to cook very long for all the flavors to meld - I had maybe 20 mins of simmer time. All of my children loved it- that rarely happens! :) I used tortilla strips, avocado, shredded red cabbage, cilantro, sour cream and cheese as optional garnishes, but truthfully, I don't think it needed more than the cilantro!

I've never had posole before, but I really liked it. For the salsa verde I used Mexina Salsa Verde, a green tomato salsa on this site. Couldn't find a dried pasilla chile so I used a dried New Mexico Hatch chile, which wasn't at all hot, so also added a jalapeno. I cut the meat 1/2" pieces, but did not brown it. The pork was fairly tough. Still, it was a very flavorful soup. I will definitely make it again.

This is a good pozole.  Slight twist on what I would consider standard.  For my personal tastes...it didn't have enough heat/spice.

Great soup. Could not find pasilla chile so substituted with another mild dried chile.Other than that followed recipe exactly. Had bowls of shredded cabbage, cheese, sliced radishes, tortilla strips, sliced avocado, and onion. People just helped themselves to the toppings. Thanks so much

after starting to put the ingredients into my crock pot, i found these ingredients didn't fit. so i had to pour everything into a big pot and brought to a boil,covered, and simmered on low for 2 hours. it turned out pretty good. i did add 2 extra cans of chicken broth just so i had more broth.

i will make again in my crock pot just to taste the difference.

Didn't have a pasilla chile available to I let that our of the recipes, and didn't have Mexican oregano so used regular oregano, otherwise followed the ingredients exactly. I ended up having to meet my Mother-in-Law in the Emergency Department and so the soup cooked on low for 12 hours. The meet was definitely dry but the flavors were still delicious. I have no doubt that if I made it again with the appropriate cook time that I would beg my hubby to let me cook this at least once a month (we only repeat recipes every 4-6 months usually).
