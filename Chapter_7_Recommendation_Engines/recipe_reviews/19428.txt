Easy and delicious!  I followed the other reviewer's suggestion and added a teaspoon of salt.  I transfered it to my own glass baking dish and sprinkled crushed Ritz crackers on top for that homemade touch.  I'll make this again.

This was yummy. It didn't have that custard consistency that so many mac and cheese casseroles have. I personally like that consistency, but my boys (4 and 6) won't touch it. This was perfect. I calculated the ingredients to feed a family of 5. Usually 4 is perfect, but sometimes my kids surprise me and I like having the leftovers anyway. I couldn't find 20 oz packages of frozen mac and cheese, so I used two 6 oz ones (all I could find). I actually wonder if that was a misprint, but a 20 oz package would be pretty big. that would feed quite a bit of people without the extra macaroni suggested in the recipe. I forgot to microwave it after mixing the two macaronis together, and really don't think that part was necessary as mine turned out just fine. I wanted the cheese to be throughout the casserole and not just on top, so I mixed mine in. I used Monterey Jack because that's what I had. I broiled it for 5 minutes and it was wonderfully melty, and cheesy. The only other suggestion I will make is that I really thought it needed some salt. Maybe a tablespoon mixed in with the pepper. My family really enjoyed this recipe and I will for sure be making this again. Thanks!

I was excited to be able to make macaroni and cheese for my family. They are big fans of such. However, i was a little dissapointed that it had a mix in it. i was hoping for something more homemade. i give this 3 and a half star rating.
