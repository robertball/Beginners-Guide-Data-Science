I LOVED the soup, and assumed this person wouldn't have included the ingredients unless they were necessary for flavor. I followed the recipe as written and thought it was awesome, as far as lentil soups go.   I added the finely minced carrot that was suggested by the submitter, and tossed a handful of fresh parsley on top before serving.

Yum!  Lentils + wine = delicious.  I've made a ton of good lentil soup recipes from this website ("Apricot Lentil Soup", "Lentil Soup", "Moroccan Lentil Soup" to name a few) and this one is just as good as the others.  Only a couple of minor changes:  I didn't add the dried onion and dried parsley, I added fresh.  I also added two finely chopped carrots and celery stalks to the soup.  I couldn't figure out 1/2 lb, so I just added 1 1/2 cups of dried lentils.   I also added about 3 tbsp of tomato paste. It turned out more soupy because I added an extra couple of cups of broth.  The wine added a ton of unexpected flavor.  It tasted almost lemony.  Excellent soup and I'll definitely add it to my lentil soup rotation!

This soup was good but nothing spectacular. I didn't add the garlic powder or dried onion since I had already added fresh earlier. I like the flavor of the wine but it needs something else, still a little too bland. I may add carrots next time.

I made this with a couple modifications. I used pre cooked lentils that were vacuum packed from my health food store. I had some left over Sauvignon Blanc (about 1 cup) and I let it cook for about 20 minutes with the onions, carrots, and some powdered chicken broth, some water, and salt and pepper. Then I added the lentils, and cooked for a few minutes until warm. Finally, I chopped up some fresh spinach and stirred it in and served. Yummmmmmmy! So much fiber, too!

Delicious and super easy.  All I had on hand was pinot grigio, and it gave a wonderfully sweet flavor to the soup.  I let this simmer for about 4 hours and served with homemade french baguettes.

Pretty good. It has an interesting flavor. I did add carrots, and I think I would add potatoes and/or some other vegetables next time. There are other lentil soups I like a bit more but this one is certainly good enough to keep on the list.

LOVED this soup.  So simple and so yummy.  Only a few minor changes, mostly due to what I had on-hand: I didn't have dried minced onion, so that got left out; I had fresh parsley, so I doubled the amount and used that; I liked the carrot and cilantro idea, so I added those (shredded carrot in with the onions, cilantro added to the finished soup); I cooked it for only an hour once all the ingredients were in-- the lentils were well soft by then.  Such a wonderful, light, fall soup.  I'm so glad I have leftovers!
