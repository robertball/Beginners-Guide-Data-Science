When I try a new recipe I follow the instructions to the letter.  I would have liked it a tad spicier and will add some additional seasoning the next time.  Also I had to discard half of  ketchup and worcester sauce and will only prepare half of it next time.  With all that in mind it is still one of the best stuffed peppers I've tried and will definitely do it again.

I made no real changes other than not roasting the peppers first, used yellow and orange peppers as they were on sale and adding some fresh tomatoes I had already cut up to the canned tomatoes (fire roasted) in the blender. It was delicious and a definite keeper, in fact, I'm going to make it again tomorrow night. Thanks for this recipe, I truley enjoyed it!

I like the way the filling tasted. and I don't generally like stuffed peppers I did however, do a few things differently. I didn't half the peppers I just hollowed them out and I used tomato sauce instead of ketchup. but still tasted amazing

This was a amazing recipe, thank you for sharing it! I did change one thing, I don't care for the ketchup taste so I used 1 can of tomato soup and 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce in place of it. Turned out so good! Thank you for sharing this!

This was a fantastic recipe.  Next time I make them, I will skip the step of putting the peppers under the broiler.  They lost their firmness too much and flattened out.  But, oh did they taste yummy!

My DH has been asking for stuffed peppers for over a year.  It was time that I finally made them.  I tried two different recipes.  This fantastic one and 'Mexican-Greek Stuffed Green Peppers' from AR.  I made this recipe, only cutting it back to two peppers.  The flavors work really well with this recipe and I liked the part of roasting the peppers before starting.  I think it added another dimension to the flavors.  We also enjoyed the ketchup/Worcestershire added to the peppers.  We ate two of the halves and I froze the other two for my in-laws.  I know they will love it.  Along with the other type of pepper, I served 'Feta Mashed Potatoes' from AR and sliced cucumbers.  DH was so excited that we had half of each pepper left for his lunch.  Thanks Procrastigirl, for sharing your recipe.  It is a keeper!

My family loved this recipe! The only change I made was using Ro-tel tomatoes. I did not have any of the sauce left over, used it all. My son said he could eat this every day. These are the best stuffed peppers I’ve ever made. Thanks for the recipe!

Followed recipe exactly, except forgot the Parmesan so I added it at the table, and they were excellent!  Followed it exactly because I’ve never made these before.  In the future, I’ll add more rice because I like it and use crushed tomatoes to  add saucy richness through out.

I omitted the rice to keep it low carb. Still very tasty!! I drizzled the ketchup mixture underneath the cheese for the final layer. They were amazing!!!

I’m not a huge fun of stuffed peppers, I make them because my hubby loves them, but these were sooooo good!! About to make them a third time so I figured I would leave a review. I make as is. Perfect. If you like them spinach maybe add a little cayenne because they aren’t spicy.

These were tasty. The ketchup/Worcestershire sauce is fantastic. I didn’t roast the peppers before assembling. I also baked them for 30 minutes

Found these to be fairly dismal. More flavor the next day,but something wouldn't make again. Found it too tomato-ey and worcheshire was too much.  Havent found a good stuffed pepper idea yet. Caution, TUrn your exhuast fan on high when you do peppers. The oil makes them smoke mightily and you will have a kitchen full of smoke.

Excellent recipe! Time consuming - yes but well worth the  trouble! The only substitution I made was ground turkey instead of ground beef. It was delicious!

these were absolutely amazing...I made it exactly the way the recipe says with the exception of swapping the rice for cauliflower rice and I actually forgot the parm but it still turned out perfect (also omitted broiling the peppers) this recipe is slightly time consuming with multiple dirty dishes @ the end...but we'll worth it!!!

I liked this recipe and will make it again. I added paprika for a little more kick. I added tomato paste to the hamburger mix and then the Worcestershire sauce instead of layering the ketchup and sauce mix separately.

Very good, Based on the  previous reviews I added a little extra spice and was very generous with the ketchup/ Worcestershire mixture (I did not add the extra water.)   I will make this one again. Only thing I might do differently would be to wait about ten minutes before topping the peppers with the cheddar cheese because the cheese was too over cooked for my taste.

Thank you Procrastigirl for doing the work for me with this one, I am also one who takes  (what I think is the best of many recipes or adding my own to it) to make it my own. I made your stuffed pepper recipe just the way you have it written and it is a definite keeper, I was unsure on how much a spoonful of the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce to use (teaspoon or tablespoon ext...) but I know I can use a little more next time I make them. I want to add the flavor of the sauce, not cover the flavor of the rest of the peppers. Everything in balance as they say, everyone has different taste. More or less of any one of the ingredients can change the outcome of any recipe to make it a 1 or 10 on the scale of WOW. You have all the right ingredients with this one, (10) Thank you again

This is the best recipe I've tried for stuffed bell peppers.  So great!  I have been hoarding the leftovers and eating them for breakfast lunch and dinner.  So good.

Cooking method is all that I changed.  I cut the tops off peppers and cleaned inside.  I diced the pepper tops and added to the ground beef.  I did not roast peppers but par-boiled them for 4 min. to soften them up.

I made this recipe pretty much word for word, but added about double the oregano, garlic powder, and onion powder. It was soooooo yummy. Others said to cut Worcestershire/ketchup half mix in half but I didn’t have a lot left over. Will definitely make this again.

I made this following the recipe exactly.  It was good but we didn't care for the sauce - we found the ketchup to be very overwhelming.  I think you could eliminate the sauce altogether and this would be a 5 star recipe.

I wasn't a fan of the Worcestershire tang. Taco seasoning I probably would have liked better and that would reduced the amount of dirty dishes...

OMG, I've been searching for a good Stuff Bell Pepper Recipe and I FOUND IT!  The only change I made was to omit the cheese and after reading the reviews used 1/4 cup of Ketchup and 1/4 cup Worcestershire Sauce!   Other than the above, went by the Recipe as stated!   Soooooo, Sooooo Good!  The flavor is Amazing, the Ketchup and Worcestershire Sauce was just awesome!  After I got the meat mixture and Rice cooked, I though it was a little bla, but once added the ketchup mixture, really added the flavor!  Thank you so much for this recipe Procrastigirl  I will definitely be making these again real soon!

I tried using different colored peppers and prefer the orange and yellow. Everything else I followed and it was a hit with the family.

This recipe is a real keeper!  The filling for the peppers is excellent, and I made it as the recipe stated.  The only change I mad was at the very end I skipped the cheese on half of the peppers because I am trying to cut my calories.  I am trying to switch to more ground turkey, so I may try it that way next time, but this recipe is going into my rotation.

I too halved the ketchup & worcestershire sauce – it made plenty that way. Loved this recipe & my partner did too! They actually ate some veggies for once!

Delicious!  I made 2 changes- did not have beef broth so used seasoned salt and I used Rotel tomatoes with green chili.  Family of 6 all love it!

Love it!  So does my husband!  This is a keeper.  I never thought to roast the peppers a bit before stuffing them.  Delish!
