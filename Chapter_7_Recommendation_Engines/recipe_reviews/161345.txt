I tried this recipe today and it was good. I did use regular yogurt instead of vanilla and it still came out good.  I also omitted the wheat germ because I didn't have that either and I also added fat free milk to make it a little thinner. I used fresh strawberries and bananas.

Delicious and great for breakfast! I love finding ways to use wheat germ so this was perfect. To cut down on the fat and calories but not on the taste I used fat free vanilla yogurt and a bit of skim milk- YUM!

I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen. I also used an organic yogurt which was something new for me, but delicious nonetheless. I didn't have any wheat germ so I put in a little flax seed instead. This was great and I'm definitely thinking about making it for breakfasts.

I found this very thick, so much so that it was impossible to blend without adding some liquid. It is also very sweet, although the flavor is great. I would not add the honey next time.

Loved it. I was a bit short on strawberries but I paid no attention to that. Also, I didn`t have any wheat germ so I used oatmeal instead. I had just plain yogurt (1%, which also decreases the fat) so I upped the honey a little bit and added quite a dash of vanilla extract. Fabulous.

I used fresh strawberries, 1 banana, oats (instead of wheat germ), plain yogurt & a small amount of vanilla.  Also added a little ice just to thicken it.  It was decent...not my favorite smoothie, but ok.  I don't know if it was the plain yogurt or the honey that made it taste a little different.  I would make again but with a few changes.  Very easy to make!

I instead used fat-free Greek yogurt and fresh strawberries.  I halved all but the strawberries, and it was very tasty and filling for both me and my husband.  Next time I will add some OJ or skim milk to cut down the thickness.

We love this! Simple and good - the proportions make it not too thick or chunky. I would also add 1/4 c or so of orange juice to give it some zing.

Love.  I added a few glugs of Vanilla soy milk and some ground flax seed.  I put it all in a quart mason jar and used my immersion blender.  Tasty!

Great creamy smoothie.  I had frozen bananas to use and they worked great in this recipe.  Also liked that it had wheat germ in it.  I will be making this one again as I always have the ingredients on hand.  Thanks Tommy H. for sharing your recipe.

This was really good and quick!  I did not use wheat germ simply because I did not have any.  I used one large banana and fresh strawberries.  My 9 year old actually made it and drank it right up!  Great healthy snack for the day.  I might start making these as a healthy start to the day in the mornings.

Great and it uses wheat germ!! I did have to add a bit of milk for my 81 year old mother, she has straw issues. I will use this as a base for all kinds of smoothies for Mom!

I also emitted the wheat germ (because I didn't have it), and it came out great. I also used plain, fat free yogurt.

I'm really sick today, and I found that the smoothie is helping me to feel better, well cooler at least. Though, I made a lot of changes:  I used less yogurt and added some milk, opted out on the wheat germ, used less honey, and added ice. I feel like I've made a totally different smoothie, but I really appreciate your recipe! thanks.

I used non-fat yogurt and frozen banana/fresh strawberries instead of vice versa.   I usually use flax meal in my smoothies, but the wheat germ was a nice change.  The strawberries were very sweet so I probably cut back on the honey by half. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good! I had to make some alterations though, based on ingredients I had on hand. I used one rounded cup of fresh, cut strawberries, not frozen, and 1 banana, 1 cup of vanilla yogurt,and instead of wheat germ and honey I added a small handful of coconut.

Really good smoothie! I recently went vegetarian, and have been trying out a lot of smoothies to add protein powder and wheat germ to. This is defintely high on the list so far. I did change it a little, using fresh strawberries, 6 ice cubes, and a little protein-supplement powder. Defintely a keeper!

My recipe calls for orange juice and crushed ice, but less yogurt. I've even added kale to it and celery. I would say strawberries and bananas are the "basics" to this recipe.

Instead of using frozen strawberries, I used a couple handfuls of ice. It was a great smoothie and I will definitely make it again!!!!

My mom has osteoporosis, so I tried this recipe to see if she'd like it since it has so much yogurt in it. I don't know how to explain it...it tasted...really off. I think there was too much yogurt and it threw off the taste. I used Dannon light and fit vanilla yogurt, great frozen strawberries (it's strawberry season here), and nice, ripe bananas. :( It just tasted bad. We prefer the Strawberry Oatmeal breakfast smoothie instead - MUCH tastier and the oatmeal gives it a really good texture.

used plain organic yogurt, added a little vanilla soy milk. It isn't jamba juice but it satisfied my craving :)
