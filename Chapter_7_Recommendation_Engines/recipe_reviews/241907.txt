I opted out of the cream cheese and used more spinach, as I wanted to make this as healthy as possible. I used marinated artichokes and (as I like it) used some of the marinade as seasoning overall. I don't usually use Panko but they really made the fantastic texture of this dish! I'll definitely be making this again!

Wanted to try something different with Mac & Cheese.
this was it. the whole family liked it. Nothing left.
the only change I made was to add a little fresh bacon crumbles in the mix with some Swiss cheese to bring out  the Artichoke
