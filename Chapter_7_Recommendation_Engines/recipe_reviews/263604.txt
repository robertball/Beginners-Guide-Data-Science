I like this recipe a lot, but I agree with what someone said below to add some herbs. I added dried oregano, dried parsley & dried basil, which added a lot!

I cut the oil down to 1 T. And the lemon juice to 3 T.   But everything else the same. The dish was absolutely delicious

Really yummy & easy. But thereâ€™s Way too much oil. I made 1/2 the recipe and probably a teaspoon would have been enough.
