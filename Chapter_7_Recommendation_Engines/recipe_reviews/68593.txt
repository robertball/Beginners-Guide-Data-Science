Very good.  The brie is mild and lets the garlic and mushroom flavor shine.  I used french bread because it would be easier to slice.  It worked well.  Definitely making this again.

this is really good, but, how the heck are you suppose to eat it. I cut it up and the mushrooms fell out, so, we just spooned it onto a plate and ate it with our fingers. It was good, just very hard to eat.

I have made this a couple of times and love the flavor.  This time however, I botched it by adding a little cream cheese to make it strech further --completely changed the result.  Do not do it!!!!

Really easy to make and absolutely yummy!  I put a little bit of white wine in with the mushrooms and garlic while I sauteed.  Sauce came out more like a fondue, which is also lovely.  Used the extra bread for dipping.  The bottom of the bread was the best!

This was awesome! I made this today to test it for a supper club I belong to and need to bring an appetizer.  I love Brie and this really fit the bill.  I used Cibatta rolls and it was a great bread for soaking up all the juice.  Next time, I will drain the mushroom/garlic mixture before adding the Brie.  I don't think it needed all that liquid.  My supper club is going to love it!

I made this recipe at a halloween party and everyone raved about it.  I used Sheepherders bread bowl instead of the sourdough and it was very good.  I also added a little bit of whitewine to the mushrooms and garlic as well as 2 different kinds of brie.  I have already been asked to make this recipe again.

This turned out perfectly, was easy to make, and tasted great. I used too big a loaf of bread, though, and I think next time I might try a smaller round, if I can find one. 
I also buttered the top and sprinkled it with garlic salt and parmesan and baked it at the same time. It also was very well received.

Nice sauce, but overall still really rich.  I was hoping the mushrooms would tame the brie, but not so.  I made a half batch and put it in a split mini baguette.  And voila!  Dinner!

I love brie, and the mushroom mixture was great with it, but the bread wrecks it.  I guess all I wanted was the cheese, and there is too much bread for such a mild cheese.  Next time I'll make the cheese 'sauce' and just dip apples in it!

This is a very simple recipe with few ingredients and not much flavor.  Of course the garlic and mushrooms are fantastic together but it was still missing something.  Also I didnâ€™t like the pizza look this would be much more elegant and dainty if  this appetizer was served on crostinis or simply baguette rounds.

I had made a loaf of sourdough and needed to make an appetizer (actually the "loaf" was more the shape of a foccacio, about 3" in center, 12" round).  Found this recipe, got the brie and mushrooms, everything else on hand.  Time was an element so I nuked the mushrooms for 7 minutes, added to the garlic and butter while over heated up.  Cut the bottom off, about 1", and used that as a base, like a big pizza.  Spread the cheese mixture on top, broiled about 10 minutes.  It went FAST and was GREAT...soon to appear again at a party near me!

This was very tasty, I will be making this again, but next time, I think more Brie is needed.

It was a big hit but I added 4 oz of cream cheese because it looked kind of lumpy with just the Brie.

Absolutely WONDERFUL! No one could stop eating it. Very easy to make and very flavorful. Will definitely have this as a "regular" when having guests or by myself!

This was awesome. I baked my own round loaf of sourdough with white flour, and the guests at my Hobbit Party ate it all!  It was a total hit.

Made this again with store-bought sourdough, and it was just as good! You literally can't leave any leftovers, it's that good!

I've made this several times to take to parties and it is always a hit.  I use French break which makes it easy to slice.  The mushrooms do spill out a bit but no one seems to mind.  They scoop them back up with the bread.
