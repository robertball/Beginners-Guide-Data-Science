Yum - loved the saltiness of the feta with the beets. I made a small batch of these as DH doesn't eat beets. He doesn't know what he's missing with this recipe. I will be having this one again.

Wow what a great recipe. I do not cook with salt so did not use. I used golden beats but next time will try the red beats. Thanks LWILCOX45 for sharing this recipe.
