This is a really fun dish! In keeping with most allrecipe reviewers, I made a few changes. I didn't have jalepenos, so I substituted a half cup of salsa and I used a can of tomatoes with green chiles because I didn't have Italian style (and the chiles seemed more in keeping with the dish. In future, I will add onion,and more salsa and I'll cut back on the cream cheese (due to calories). Also, some cilantro would increase the Mexican yumminess. This was very tasty and might even be fun as a chip dip. The family enjoyed it very much and we will have it again.

I made this when my Brother and his family were visiting. It went well with the Carnitas that we also had. I made it just like the recipe and everyone loved it. It also works for a dip for tortilla chips.

Wow, this was fantastic.  I made it for a group of my friends for mexican dinner night.  It was creamy and yummy, with a hint of a kick at the end.  Since, then, I've made it 3 times.  It's wonderful.

Instead of adding jalapeños to the top (too hot), I added a small can of chopped mild green chilies to the bean mixture.  It added lots of flavor without the heat.  Great recipe. A+

Try this one!!! It was soooo delicious! I made it for a Mexican potluck, and it was the perfect side dish. The only changes I made were double-the-cheese, and double-the-jalapenos! I'll definitely be making this again, and soon! :)

Wonderful! So tasty! I used corn straight off the cob (4 cobbs) instead of canned and used light cream cheese with 1/2 the butter called for. I also didn’t use the jalapeños but did add some red pepper flakes to the corn mixture for spice. Works great as a side or dip!

My husband and I both liked this recipe. I cook the jalapenos in the dish and add chicken.  This twist to it makes it a bit spicier and great for a potluck main dish.

I made this for Christmas (Mexican) dinner & it looked revolting. Not yellow like the picture, mostly white (lumpy cream cheese) I had to convince everyone to try it. While it was hot it had a sour taste. Later while putting away leftovers I tried it & it reminded me of that dip where you put a cube of cream cheese on a plate & pour salsa over it. I wont make it again.

I omitted the black beans, but otherwise used all the listed ingredients.

I used 1 can each:
Fire roasted corn,
White corn,
Fiesta corn.

I added 1/2 cup Mrs Renfro's Jalepeno's, chopped up.  I added these to the mixture before stirring it all together instead of putting them on top at the end.

This was DELICIOUS!!!  I took it to a Potluck Dinner, and everyone loved it!

Turned out great. I used corn from our garden & found it creamy enough without the cheddar.

My family isn't fond of beans so I omitted them. We don't use canned goods so I used frozen corn and fresh green and red peppers. I used a jar of HOT salsa because we like spicy foods. I used cojack cheese and baked it as directed. Our family loved it and will make it again.

Made this as a side to accompany an Easter dinner with baked ham. Had to use peaches and cream frozen corn as the corn mentioned in the recipe was not available in our local grocery store. (small town Canada). Couldn't find the tomatoes with the peppers so just added fresh. 
In the end I only put 1/2 cup of the cheddar on the  top.
It was a colorful, tasty side .
Just an added note - tomorrow the leftover ham and corn casserole with a few other ingredients are going to be served as a chowder.

This recipe was delicious!! I did make changes, but only because I had so many fresh vegetables.  I used fresh/frozen sweet corn & added my own green & red peppers,  fresh tomatoes that I cooked some with more green peppers and fresh jalapenos.

Definitely flavorful.  Recipe is self described as a side dish, but reviewers (myself included) feel it makes a great dip.  If it is to be a side dish then you would need to cut the butter and cheese in half.  As it was I added an extra can of beens and corn and it was still too cheesey (if there is such a thing)

Enjoyed this dish. Easy to fix. Omitted jalapeno and it still was a bit spicy - just right. It would also be good as a warm dip.
