Excellent taste and easy to make.  It doesn't "need" a sauce, but when I entertained using this recipe, I made a creamy (Fresh) horseradish sauce and a Tzatziki sauce/dip.  Would definitely make again.  Very low effort and time needed for an elegant appetizer.

This was very good and easy to make.  Don't be afraid to follow the recipe and only cook the fish for 12 minutes.  It can overcook quickly. I made it a day ahead, sliced small pieces and served it over a bed of couscous on a large platter. I made a side of dill sauce for anyone who wanted the extra creaminess. Everyone raved and it makes for a very elegant presentation.  I would definitely let the salmon come up to room temperature before serving.  The flavors are more pronounced that way.

This is amazing.. Had it hot out of the oven and I had forgotton to add the lime juice.. still GREAT. Very important as the author said to take it out while not fully cooked and let it sit for 5 mins or so.

I was looking for something different from the usual chix wings, dips, etc. to serve at a small football party this past Sunday and found this easy and absolutely delicious recipe - I highly recommend it!  Everyone raved about it!  I also made this for dinner and served hot from the oven (prepared it with skin off) and MY GOODNESS!  It was SPECTACULAR.  I agree with a previous reviewer:  Why serve this cold when it's so delish straight from the oven!

excellent. I prepared a whole fillet of salmon, using the entire amounts listed and following instructions to the letter. Our guests really enjoyed it.   The recipe contributor is quite right in that the heavy load of spices is lost when served cold. It was part of a cold buffet dinner. I've been requested to provide the recipe to a number of people.  I will make this again.

This has become my favorite way of preparing salmon. I skip the lime (since I almost never have limes on hand), and the high-temp cooking method works wonders on the texture. If my filets are thick I cook it for a minute or two more than it says, and the result is a salmon that almost MELTS in the mouth. I've had it hot, cold and room temperature. My favorite is room temp. Great do-ahead recipe for guests.

I made this for a dinner party.I made it exactly as written and served it cold. My guests loved it! It is so simple to make. After I took it out of the oven, I let it sit for the recommended time. Then I cut off a piece to try it warm. It was tasty that way as well, but a bit sweeter than it wound up tasting when I had it cold. The rub actually becomes like a glaze on the top after sitting in the fridge. If you are serving this to people who like their salmon well done, you might want to keep it in the oven a bit longer. My salmon was 1 inch thick and I let it sit after coming out of the oven but it was still a bit more pink in the middle than some people might like. It was exceptionally moist though. I will make this again.

Very tasty fish. I served it hot and didn't have any mustard-it was a tiny bit too sweet, so next time I'll use a pinch less cinnamon and sugar. My husband is Moroccan and he enjoyed it-and he's not much of a fan of fish.

Very good and couldn't be easier.  I ate it hot from the oven and thought it was wonderful.  Today I'll try the leftovers cold.  I love knowing that such an easy dish can be prepared in advance--great for a party dish!

I followed the directions exactly and was disappointed that the salmon was not nearly as spicy as I expected. This is not a "real" Middle Eastern dish. In my opinion there is too much cumin and nutmeg and not enough cayenne pepper or paprika.

Wow!  Coming out of the oven, the salmon fillet looked scrumptious but I didn't know how it would taste, this being the first time making the recipe and I'm pretty picky about my fish.  First bite - I was speechless. I used a wild alaskan salmon fillet and followed the recipe as-is, except for reduced portions to 2 servings and serving right away with another allrecipes.com recipe as a side dish (rice with summer squash).  Check the type of salmon you're using though - if it's coho or a leaner type of salmon, reduce the roasting time as it will have less fat and cook quicker.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe!  It appeared like the spices would be overpowering like a kick in the mouth, but they were subtle and complex. Went nice with quinoa and peas and carrots. Would definitely make again!

This was very tasty. I had one piece hot from the oven and the other cold the next day in a salad. It was very good both ways. I wanted a different type of side that would complement the flavors in this dish. I found 'Couscous with Dried Cherries' from this site. They were fantastic together!

My Dad LOVED this fish - he's been really looking for flavorful dishes after being spoiled eating at Boma in Disney World.  This fish was very flavorful, the cumin was the predominant flavor and I love cumin, but it was a little much for me.

I agree with others that this is easy, and as good or better served hot. However, it needs a squeeze of lime or lemon after cooking to balance out the spiciness.  And/or a hollandaise or aioli-type sauce would really make this a fabulous dish.  Also, I made this earlier in the day and refrigerated it before baking.

I really liked this dish. It was wonderfully flavorful. I followed the recipe, except I substituted maple sugar for the cane sugar. I also ate it warm, but will be eating the leftovers cold. Next time I will use a little less cinnamon and add a bit more cumin, but that is just my personal preference.

Best rub ever, made a double amount to have on hand since
we eat Salmon and other fish often.  I also forgot the lime juice
and used lemon....still delicious.  Also, I think it would compliment
chicken Need to try that...Always nice when the husband raves about a meal!!!

Amazing!  First try, we ate it "warm".   But the leftovers were fantastic the next day.  We make this often - it's just that good!

Great new twist on baked salmon in our household!  We enjoyed it hot from the oven but I am sure it would also be delicious served cold over a salad.

Have made this for guests on more than one occasion. It tastes great and even the kids ate it up. Bonus points that it can be made ahead!

Excellent - would absolutely make again. Great for entertaining.  I squeezed a lemon on top instead of a lime (didn't have a lime in the fridge) and used a big 2 lb skinless salmon slab and it worked perfectly.

I have to say, I really didt' enjoy the flavor, but I guess that's just a matter of personal preference. The taste of cumin, in particular, didn't seem to fit with the salmon for me. My husband, o the other hand, absolutely loved it. He'd definitely have it again. I'd make something similar in th future, but I'd use differenc spices, maybe dill, onion powder and paprika, cayenne and maybe soem garlic, then drizzle with lemon or lime juice.

This was just so-so.  I don't understand why we sprinkle the skin with the rub.  It seems like a waste. I found the taste to be a bit too subtle for my taste.  The family hated it.

I found that the people whom I made this for either really liked this or didn't care for the spice blend. I, myself, thought it was spiced just right and made it with the Couscous Salad with Dried Cherries recipe from this site as another reviewer did. If nothing else, this was good for a change.

I followed the instructions exactly as they were written, except I used skinless salmon, and this was absolutely out of this world, especially on a hot day.

This had a unique flavor and was very easy to make. I didn't have ground ginger, so I grated fresh and brushed it on the salmon before adding the seasonings. I served it at room temp the next day, but I thought it tasted just as good straight from the oven.

I like the idea, and I might make cold spiced salmon again sometime, but I will cook it just a bit less (I like my salmon less well done), and for my family this had too much cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar.  It was good with a simple horseradish sauce, as suggested by another reviewer.

I keep this wonderful spice blend on hand at all times. I quadruple the serving size. It fits easily into an 8 oz. sealed plastic container. Keep it right on our back-of-the-door spice shelves.

This is one of my favorite salmon recipes.  I found this an easy salmon recipe that tastes great served hot or cold.  It doesn't require a lot of clean up, which I love because my apartment doesn't have a dish washer.  
Like the fact that most of the work is done ahead of time.  Then it needs to chill for 2 hours giving you time to prepare other dishes and relax  before you eat. You can also make it the day before.
I make a simple fat free yogurt or mayo to go with it.  Yet tastes great without it.

i was intrigued by the spice list and wanted to try something different with salmon.. this was okay but not as bold as i was hoping for.. if i were to make this again i'd up the salt and cayenne.. i'm curious if making this into a marinade would bring out more flavor.. this wasn't bad by any stretch.. it just wasn't anything outstanding

This was outstanding and just what I was hoping for when looking for a great cold salmon recipe that I could serve with a couple of salads on a hot day!   I followed this recipe exactly except that I prefer to cook the salmon wrapped in foil on the barbecue, especially on a hot day when I don't want to use the oven.  So, in the morning I cooked a 4 lb, 1 1/2 inch thick, skinless Costco Atlantic salmon (serves 8) for 9 minutes on each side on the BBQ and then refrigerated it until our dinner party at 6 PM.  After appetizers and drinks on the deck, I gently took off the foil and served it on a big platter, along with the two salads, buffet style.  Although there was a table on the deck, people preferred to eat it on their laps and continue chatting, easy with this type of dinner.  This was so relaxing compared to other dinner parties we've hosted where we're scrambling to finish cooking while entertaining and enjoying the company of our guests.  I will definitely prepare this again!

This is an easy item to make and has a unique / different flavor. Not being a big cold fish fan, we ate it right out of the oven.

This salmon was consumed quickly! Halved the sugar (next time I'll probably take it out) and didn't have any mustard powder, but it was still delish. I served it at room temp. The cooking times seemed perfect.

Really loved this recipe! While it takes some advance time to prepare, the preparation is easy as is the clean-up. Since there were varying opinions on whether best served chilled or at room temp, I chilled the salmon for only about an hour before serving it. The flavors were balanced and pronounced. Served it with chilled tabouli salad.

This salmon is amazingly delicious! I cannot eat sugar of any kind or artificial sweeteners; instead I used stevia. I also lessened the amount of salt as I found 1/2 a teaspoon too much...just a pinch does the trick as there are so many wonderful flavours in this dish that extra seasoning takes away from it.

I make this at least once I week; I have eaten it for breakfast, lunch and dinner...mash it up with some homemade mayo and wrap in a lettuce leaf...WOW!

Thanks for this great and well rounded dish :)

Just made this recipe for my husband and I for lunch and it was amazing.  He told me I missed my calling in life.  He was so complimentary he said this dish (served it with a couscous salad) should be on the menu at a restaurant.   Planning on making this for supper next week when he have family over.  Unfortunately, I was out of nutmeg and had no allspice so I added ground cloves instead and I added about 1/4 tsp of curry because I love curry.  Totally forgot to squirt with lime but it was perfect anyhow.

Oh so good. The seasonings are a different way to serve salmon and don't overpower this flavorful fish. I served it still warm and it was fantastic! Definitely making it again.

This is great hot or cold, and I'm not much of a Salmon eater.
