This recipe is pretty quick and easy, and adds some much-needed additional taste to the traditional almond macaroons.  I think I'm going to try adding toasted sesame seeds to a coconut macaroon recipe next time!

This recipe was alright. There were a little too much sesame seeds for my taste, and I didn't even use the full amount the recipe called for.
