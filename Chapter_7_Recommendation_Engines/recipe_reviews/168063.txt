The pecans and rice krispies ingredients tempted me to try this veggie burger. I added 1/2 cup of lentils to the rice, an extra dash of cayenne pepper and an extra egg white to keep it together. They are delicious although a little on the dry side. The flavor of the pecans nor the rice krispies stand out, but are delicious none the less.

Does not in any way shape or form make patties. Taste is great but it stuck to the pan after broiling and only got hardened on the top side (mush in the middle). I have extra, I'll be trying to fry them in a skillet as broiling does not work!
