Will definitely make this again!  I loved it.  Put it on rice.  YUM!!!
I used the peanutbutter I had on hand (Kraft Extra Creamy) so as I was about to add the brown sugar, I stopped (I did drop a little in there, though), thinking the peanut butter had enough sugar in it already.  Next time, I will leave out the brown sugar altogether. 
The red curry paste, as called for, did not add any heat, so I added more halfway through.  Next time, I will actually at least double it from the beginning, maybe even triple.
There was a lot of chopping and it took some work, but was well worth it.

DELICIOUS. We are putting this into our regular rotation now. We served it over spaghetti squash.

One tip - I first cooked the chicken until it was still a little pink in the center as it would continue cooking when I set it aside & then when it was all mixed together. Doing that made the chicken extremely tender.

Thanks for the yummy recipe!
