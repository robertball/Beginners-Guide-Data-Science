I don't know how but I've lived 60yrs. and have never heard of, seen or tasted Halushki. Boy have I been missing out. I basically used this as my base and went from there. I browned my diced bacon with my onions then added some diced bell peppers, 2 cloves minced garlic, salt and pepper. Once my veggies were tender I added my cabbage and 1/4 cut of water and didn't bother draining my cooked bacon and veggies first. Covered my large flat bottomed wok and turned the heat down and let simmer until the cabbage was done. I didn't have any egg noodles so I used what I had Linguine which I broke into thirds before boiling. In a separate small skillet I browned my bite size polish sausage. Once the Linguine was tender I drained and put back in stew pot and added about 2 tablespoons butter, salt and pepper to taste and sprinkled with powdered garlic and stirred. When my cabbage was tender I added everything together. This makes a lot of Haluski so you'll either want to half the recipe or get out the biggest bowl you own. OMG this is so good. We ate until we were both miserable but can't wait to warm it up tomorrow. Who knew pasta and cabbage would be so good together. I'll be making this often from now on. Thanks Nana for this wonderful recipe.

I tried this using a reviewers suggestion to add some bacon, garlic, red pepper and honestly I could not stop eating it.  Easy, quick and delicious.  These are three essentials in my book for a five star review.

This was great and left overs for another meal which was great. Lots of food for two people.  I used a 1/2 ring of Mundare ham sausage which you will not find except in  Alberta Canada. 5 strips of pre cooked bacon crumbled  plus 1 tsp minced garlic and 1/2 a green pepper chopped. I will make this again for sure. My noodle package was slightly larger at 16 ounce . I did use the butter !

I gave this 4 stars! It is a super quick, easy and pretty inexpensive meal to prepare! I did not give it 5 stars because I feel like if I had not made the adjustments I did, it would have not had much flavor.

 I cooked about 5 strips of bacon, and used that oil to saute my onion (added garlic and some red bell peppers) then I added the sausage and then cabbage. I added a bit too much water so before I added the cooked noodles I took some broth and added 3TBS butter and about 1/8 cup corn starch and then added the noodles to the mixture. This made it have somewhat of a sauce. 

 I also added some tony chacharies season blend! YUM!

Polksa Kielbasa w/ Cabbage & Egg Noodles Haiku: "Darn good comfort chow. I made small substitutions. Thanks Baking Nana!" I used a bag of coleslaw mix from the produce department to make this even more fast. Definitely use the optional 1-2 TB of butter - forget keeping Halushki remotely healthy, although I do like that this recipe didn't include bacon/bacon grease as others do. Made me feel slightly less guilty about having seconds, but also sharing my seconds w/ the baby b/c she ended up loving it too.

Perfect the way it is. Simple, yet so satisfying!

If you get uncooked sausages, boil them for 10 minutes & then slice them prior to frying.

This recipe has been voted a keeper by a teenager who doesn't like cabbage. I admit that I incorporated the suggestions of adding green pepper,  garlic and a bit of bacon.  Additionally I spiced it with a tablespoon of light brown sugar and a few shakes of cayenne pepper powder. It may have moved away from the original recipe but it sure was  tasty.  So delicious the boy packed up some to take for lunch tomorrow. (shocker!) Thanks and blessings for sharing this recipe and all the suggestions made by other reviewers.

This is such an easy and tasty meal. My whole family loves it! The only slight change I made was added a little garlic when cooking the meat and onion. I made this recipe twice, the first time I used minced garlic and the second all I had was garlic powder on hand. Both times were yummy.

Followed other recommendations  and added bacon, bell pepper and garlic.  Mixed undrained diced tomatoes in when adding the cabbage.  This even pleased my very picky 9-year old daughter!  Will definitely make again.

Like another reviewer, I've walked this earth for over 60 years and had never heard of this dish. I've also never liked cooked cabbage until trying this. And yes I made changes! Some suggested bacon and I tried that first time. However, I thought that the combination of kielbasa and bacon was a bit of overkill and prefer only one or the other. Also, the only cabbage I ever use is Savoy, which is so much more colorful, tender, mild, and nutritious than regular green cabbage. If you haven't tried it before I highly recommend it! For mine I also added 3 diced apples, mustard, caraway seed, apple juice, and parsley, along with the optional butter. This stuff is so good that I've already made it several times since trying it a couple of months ago. And it makes great leftovers!

I have made this dish many times everytime it turns out great.  I do add a little garlic and steam the cabbage a bit and then put it with the onions and sausage.  It seems to get more tender in a shorter time. I never liked cabbage before but with this recipe I really do.  Thanks

My family loved this dish! It's excellent! I added bacon and extra garlic, plus cut back the cabbage a bit. the cabbage is a lot to cook once cut up and was overtaking the pot.
Quick and delicious - I highly recommend

Very easy recipe for a quick weeknight dinner.  I had most things on hand--a plus. I did not have flat egg noodles, so I had to use rotini--worked just fine.  I recommend that you use your creativity with the seasoning.  I added caraway seeds, white pepper, and minced garlic.  The sausage gives it most of the flavor, and then the onions, then the seasonings...and it is a light meal if eaten on its own. We had no sides, and we were ok....

I grew up in the Greater Pittsburgh area, where we have a large Polish-American community. Haluski wasn't just a staple meal, it was its own food group. You can go crazy with it and add bacon or cook the egg noodles in beer - but I prefer the simplicity of the original method.
I didn't change a thing about this, because it's perfect.

I made this just like it was written. It is good but the recipe could use more flavors. My hubby liked it, so that is all that matters really. LOL
I love it for a base. Next time I am going to try the other suggestions, such as the bacon, red peppers and garlic. I love garlic so lots of garlic.

A good base of a meal. I added Italian dressing to give it more flavor.
