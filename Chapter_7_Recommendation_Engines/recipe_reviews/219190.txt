As others have said, this is a simple basic recipe, but made it because store-bought is so full of sugar. Threw everything in a blender. I substituted 2 Cups of whipping cream for 2 cups of the quart of milk, used twice the vanilla, and added a teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves. I also used regular unsweetened lowfat canned milk and added 1/4 Cup Splenda. I also used pasturized liquid eggs (Egg Beaters) instead of eggs for safety. Yummy nog and can be easily spiked, I'm sure.

This is a terrific and simple base recipe! A big thanks to the poster. I made eggnog a long time ago from another recipe and hated it. I went back to the store bought stuff until today. It's Particularly nice if you don't want to make a lot. I did modify it some. 

I used 1/2 whipping cream and 1/2 milk because I wanted it to be creamy. I added cloves and nutmeg to taste (for me that ended up being 1 1/2 t nutmeg and 1 t cloves. I also increased the vanilla. I increase the vanilla on any recipe I try that contains it though.

Make sure the eggs are THOROUGHLY beaten before adding to any milk.  I use a small food processor/food chopper.  And I eat them to a light yellow color so all the white is well blended.

This was a super simple recipe.  The egg nog came out tasting very good.  I had to improvise slightly.  I used fat free sweetened condensed milk and almond milk in stead of whole milk.  I will also add a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg next time.

Fantastic recipe.  But me and my wife like to add a fifth of Traveler's Club vodka to the batch.  Cheers!

This was AMAZINGLY GOOD!! I did 4 egg yolks, instead of 2 whole eggs and it was exactly like the store bought in thickness. I also omitted the vanilla, as there are some in our family who don’t like it. We prefer to drink ours hot, with a little whipped cream on top!

I missed out this year on traditional store-bought dairy Egg Nog, which I love without the alcohol – Thank you!  So, I thought I would give this recipe a try, due to its simplicity.  Like all, I did make modifications to suit my needs.

I deleted the salt from the recipe as I try to hold down sodium content in my food.  Also, for even more simplicity, I substituted ½ cup of Original Egg Beaters for the eggs.

I was very happy with the result.  It was very fresh and very cold and now I can have "egg nog" whenever I want.

You can add salt, nutmeg and booze to taste.  Enjoy!

I would say for a quick nog this was pretty good. I think next time I will replace part of the milk with cream for that truly decadent holiday treat.

Although it’s not as thick as “store bought” egg nog, the flavor is rich, satisfying, and delicious!!  It reminds me of the egg nog my mom made when I was a child.

My Husband made this today! It is DELICIOUS! He made it as written, but then added a few things....He added HALF milk and half heavy whipping cream (to replace the milk) and added an extra egg! Also, if you add a little RUM Extract, this gives it a nice flavor. This made a huge difference. We served it with a dash of nutmeg.

I made this on Thanksgiving, and this was my favorite of the two recipes I made.  I added a heavy sprinkle of nutmeg - because why not? - and I tossed the other recipe to keep this one.  Perfect thickness, delicious and creamy, just perfect!  This will be at my holiday dinners, every time!

This is really easy to make and tastes really great! I used Trader Joe’s vanilla flavored almond drink (milk) unsweetened and my husband who is not a fan of almond drink (milk) still liked it. I added a little bit of nutmeg into the blend and it really elevated the flavor.

Make this every year for our Christmas party and it's always a hit! Tastes like the best vanilla ice cream you've ever had in liquid form. My only advice is to make sure and whisk the eggs until they're foamy before adding the other ingredients (and if you bottle any for later use be sure to re-whisk before serving).

I recommend adding some Nutmeg to taste. Start off small and add as needed. Also, more sweetened condensed milk makes it thicker and sweeter.

I made this exactly as written and it was excellent and super easy. I would have liked it to be slightly thicker, but it's not worth dropping the rating to 4 stars.

1/04/17: Update - didn't realize I already reviewed this so was going to submit the same comments again with one addition - I also made this with 1 tbsp of vanilla instead of the 1 tsp (we are serious vanilla lovers) and it was awesome! (still a little thinner than I would like, but nearly perfect)

I added more milk and three more egg yolks, that made it more creamy. This recipe is one of the best I've tried.

This was very good and simple.  My family loves egg nog, but I have always been a bit scared to make it.  It definately needed a bit of nutmeg to get the traditional taste, but was a very good starter.  I made two seperate batches one for the kids, and one with a bit of "cheer" for the adults!
