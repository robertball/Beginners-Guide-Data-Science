I didn't have cream of mushroom so used cream of chicken instead.  I also ground up the croutons from the box of stuffing.  I found that using 1 tsp salt was a little too much; next time I'd err on the side of caution & use maybe Â½ tsp salt or even omit it altogether.

Best on hamburger buns. I had to substitute the seasoning mix with bread crumbs, and use less amount of salt & pepper. Makes great cheeseburgers!

There are a couple of very important things that need mentioned here. First is that cans of tuna are 5 ounces and not 6. Secondly, you really have to run the stuffing mix through a processor so that it turns to crumb or its not going to work either. Lastly, this is extremely wet and takes more than 10 minutes to set up in the fridge. These turned out okay but you really have to allow more time and effort than the recipe states. If I make these again I will leave out the milk altogether. Great concept but these need some tweaking.
