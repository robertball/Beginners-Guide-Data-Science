We tried this recipe several years ago when it first was published in Southern Living.  We made it for a super bowl party and it was definitely a hit.  It takes a while to make and for all the flavors to blend, but it is well worth the wait.  My husband LOVES to make it.

I didn't like this recipe.  After all of the preparation, I was expecting something amazing.  Unfortunately it was just the opposite. I would rather eat canned chili than this.

This was really good, had great flavor.  The only thing I didn't like was that it took a long time to cut up the meat.  Husband loved it.

SOOO DELICIOUS!!! My hubby keeps begging me to make it over and over again.  I also put in 1 pound of ground hamburger, cooked and drained, because my family prefers a really meaty chili.  It was CHILICIOUS!!

A great tasting, hearty chili.  Lots of ingredients, but well worth the trouble.

This is a really great recipe. I've made it several times, and almost always have had to substitute something (there are SO MANY ingredients). It's a winner! I have recommended to several people that they make this for chili cook-off's.

I cut back on the jalapeno's as my husband can only handle so much "hot" but this recipe was, thick and tasty. Rated big at home! a nice change
with the chickpeas.

Wasn't very good, had to add my own extra ingredients for everyone to want to eat it.

this is a time consuming recipe the ingredients make it flavorful it was the first time I made used chocolate not in a dessert.  I made this for a superbowel party however everyone ate it seconds however did not go over well it was very different flavors than what we are used to in chili.  The chocolate made it very very dark.  Probably will not make again

Wonderful!  Sure it is time consuming to measure and chop but well worth the effort.  Served it to a group and they raved about it!

This was a big hit at a recent NFL playoff party. Recipe was not overly complicated and had big rewards! I would recommend it to any chili lover.
