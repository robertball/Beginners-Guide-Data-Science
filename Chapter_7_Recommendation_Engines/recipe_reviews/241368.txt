It was great but you have to use heavy cream to get the right consistency. I also added capers with the artichoke hearts. Yummy

This dish has amazing flavor. The only change I made, was adding sliced mushrooms and only because I needed to use them up. I can't wait to make this again for company.

I made this with tilapia instead of salmon. It was delicious!

Nice recipe, didn't use artichokes and it was still good.  I will definitely make again.

This was delicious! I made it with hot smoked salmon (as opposed to cold smoked salmon lox) for extra flavour.  Perfect amount of heat from the red pepper flakes. Next time I make it, I think I'll use 1-1/2 cup of cream.

Very good!! Need to use heavy cream.  I always use this when I have leftover salmon. Use your eye to determine the sauce cooking time.  Capers work when out of artichoke hearts.

I made this for my husbandâ€™s birthday and he loved it. He just finished up the leftovers for lunch today.

I made this tonight and it was a huge home run! The only thing I changed was that I added about 2 Tbsp drained capers when I added the cream and Parmesan. I served it with pappardelle pasta. Everyone loved it and this will definitely be added to my Tried and True Giles to make again. Thank you for an amazing recipe!

The wine/chicken broth sauce never thickened so I took a lot of it out. Otherwise the recipe is great. Super tasty. A little spicy with the red pepper flakes. Definitely a fun get out of a rut recipe.

I substituted half and half for the whipping cream and used marinated artichokes and roasted red peppers.  It did take a while to simmer out the liquid, but eventually it became saucy and thick. I would definitely make this again!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some cream I had left....came across this and it was just what I was looking for as a "base".  I used all the main ingredients except for the salmon and wine, and added some sun dried tomatoes.  I used grilled chicken as that is what I had on hand and as we were eating it I realized I forgot the parmesan! My family really liked it and asked me to make it again.

Very good flavor. The only thing is that the smoked salmon tends to congeal with the parmesean, making a tuna blob type consistency. Not sure how this can be avoided?

Used half and half instead of heavy cream, otherwise as recipe directed.  VERY soupy.  Will not make again.

I actually didn't have all the exact ingredients. But I used what I had and it turned out great! I can see where using heavy cream instead of milk (which was all I had) would make a difference with the thickness of the sauce.  I had left over salmon and trout from the night before and used that.  Thank you for the idea for this recipe.
