Obviously, it's a meringue and not a macaroon recipe, but beyond that, it's pretty tasty! My husband is a type I diabetic with high cholesterol, and this is so low-carb he doesn't have to take extra insulin AND it is good for his cholesterol count. He's very happy with the counts and the taste. I usually don't like the splenda recipes I make for him, but I had a few of these and they were really good!   I made them twice the size of normal meringues and cooked them ten minutes longer. They were too soft and getting brown on the outsides, so I wouldn't recommend this.  I will make them the right size next time.   btw: 1/2 Cup Splenda = 8 Tbsp = 24 tsp = 12 packets

These aren't awful for sugar free cookie, but I can definitely taste the artificial sweetener in this. I had hoped to be able to pipe these like the ones I found in the store but it was too soft . I put mine in for an hour and left them in for a bit longer with oven off. The consistency was nice. Since I don't have health issue that require me to go sugar free, I think I'll try this again, perhaps with 1/3 sugar and 2/3 of the artificial sweetner.

I just couldn't get this to work. I was using a different brand of sucralose, and a liquid one at that. It just wouldn't, wouldn't work. Cookies came out like lumps of styrofoam that crumbled into ashes. Not so appealing. Maybe it was me, but I will try another recipe next.

I used half the amount of Simply Right stevia packets.  It was so bitter it was inedible.  Didn't bake like a macaroon either...

I used swerve and loved these. They are very sweet.
