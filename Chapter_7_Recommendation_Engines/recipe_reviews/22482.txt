I've made two different recipes using the Reese's chips and they don't seem to cook very well. They dry up (even if you take them out of the oven early) and have a funny taste. But if you eat them by themselves, they taste great!

These bars weren't chewy or gooey, and the peanut butter chips didn't even melt! Thought it would be better.

I usually don't bother trying recipes with less that 4 stars, but how could a recipe with all these good ingredients be bad?  I liked these quite a bit, but truthfully prefer plain scratch brownies.  I reduced the butter in the brownie layer from 2 sticks to 1 1/2.  The brownie layer was exceptionally good so you could probably reduce the butter down even more. I ran out of oatmeal for the cookie layer and made up the difference with a combination of whole wheat flour and toasted wheat germ.  With all the PB chips, you couldn't tell oats from wheat germ anyway.  There was a lot more cookie layer that brownie layer - I think I would have preferred the layers to be a little more equal.
