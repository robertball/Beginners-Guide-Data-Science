These are GREAT!!!  I love them w/ the Fiesta Ranch Dip, too!!!  Also, to prevent flour tortilla's from tearing, either let them set to room temp, or microwave them -- when they are warm, they will roll up easily.

I am shocked at the reviews some people gave.  I have made these things for the last year, because after the first time, people FREAKED out, I have not had ANYONE not like them.  Not sure what people are talking about them being too salty, someone's not doing something right, these things are DIVINE!  I use about 20 small "taco size" tortillas thought and use orange bell pepper, found the taste of orange is the best.  
This has been the BEST recipe on this site!

Absolutely fantastic!!  I made them for a party of fifty with ages ranging from 8-55.  I was scared that nobody would eat them...but they were ooed and awed about all night.  I made them with half the amount of ranch mix.  I also used three different kinds of tortillas...MISSION spinach, sun dried tomatoes and zesty.  It was such a beautiful way to display these little beauties!  I am also happy to say that I ran out before the party was over (I doubled the recipe).  Enjoy!!

These are fabulous! Everytime I make them my family goes crazy.  Instead of using the sliced black olives I use a can of the diced olives - that way you still get the flavor but not the awkwardness of the sliced olives sliding out while biting into them - and it is easier to spread onto the tortillas!  I also use 34 of the ranch dip packet.  DELICIOUS!

This is my favorite quick appetizer to make. I had problems at first trying to keep them from unrolling after I sliced them. Then, I figured out that if you spread cream cheese all the way to the end of the tortilla, leaving the last quarter inch or so with only cream cheese spread and no veggies, the cream cheese acts like a glue and the tortilla will stick together. Aha!

I love this recipe, I have used this several times.  If you think it sounds good but don't want the hassle buy spreadable graden vegtable cream cheese instead.  Excellent recipe!

I halved the recipe because of all the "too salty" complaints and before I ruined an entire batch, I thought I'd try half first. It IS a tad on the salty side but they were delicious (which means, when I make the "full" version, I will just use half a pkg of dry ranch dressing). As another reviewer stated, the veggie combinations are endless...although I followed the recipe to the letter the first time. Thanks to my handy-dandy chopper, I was able to mince all my veggies, which made it even better. Thanks Linda!!

These appetizers made a big hit at a dinner party I gave last week (the guests even asked to take home the leftovers I had!)  I used sun-dried tomato tortillas - made the appetizer look really festive.  A definite party pleaser - highly recommended if you want to get lots of compliments!

These were so good. You could really put anything in them. I decreased the amount of ranch dressing. I thought it was getting too salty. I will make this again.

These are very good and super easy to make.  I will take them to potlucks all the time.  I didn't add the celery to mine because I didn't have any, but really you can add just about any colorful vegetable that you like.  I have made with roasted peppers before and that is really good too.

I loved these. Thank you so much to the reviewer who suggested using the spreadable veggie cream cheese, it saved time, cost, and tasted great! I added some chopped green olives to this since I love them with everything and added just a touch more than half a packet of ranch dressing. Perfect amount of saltiness. They were very well received at a birthday party and I could not quit eating them. I will definitely make them during the holidays. I did use half of the spread on sun dried tomato tortillas and I did not think those tasted very good, they were also the last to be eaten so I would just stick to regular tortillas in the future.

I've made this recipe several times for various occasions and it has always been a hit.  In earlier reviews it was suggested that you use half the amount of ranch dressing mix to cut the salt content.  That's all you have to change from the original to have success.  To make the process easier I mix all ingredients together then spread onto the tortillas.  It saves a lot of time and makes less of a mess but it tastes the same.  I think people that didn't like it should try again using less of the dressing mix.  I'm sure it'll work for you then.

Very very good.  I made it for husband's work pot luck. I added extra block of cream cheese (based on what was said regarding saltiness) to cut salt and to have extras.  I nuked the tortillas for 10 secs. first to help with pliability, because you can't be shy about rolling these babies up tight!

I used the chive and onion soft cream cheese after reading that this needed more flavor.  Instead of celery, used green pepper and sharp cheddar cheese.  We like things with strong flavor so I might throw in a can of green chilis or jalapenos next time.  It just seems like it's missing (to us) a dominant spice of some sort.  Worth playing with as it's so easy to pick up and eat and looks so attractive on the buffet table.  I just need to kick the flavor into gear some for our taste.  Thank you!

I made these for a party and they went fast. I did taste them first and felt the ranch mix made the cream cheese mix too salty. You could use other non-salty powder flavors in the cream cheese for a different taste.

So I honestly can't say I tasted them but I took them to a baby shower and 1/2 were gone, the other three went home borrito style with some ladies.     Changes: I used tomato(orange) and spinach (green) tortillas. I also used chopped olives (as suggested) and 1/2 of the ranch mix. I added water chestnuts (crunch!), green onions, grated carrots and celery. I didn't "sprinkle" as I figured this would make it uneaven, so I just finely diced everything and mixed it all together then spread it on. Finally, I topped it off with some spinach to make it healthier and rolled it up.

These were great. I made them for a bachelorette party and my friends raved about them, and they're easy! The only trouble I ran into is that if they are not kept cold they sort of fall apart. I would suggest securing each on with a toothpick.

I used reduced fat cream cheese, one batch of SD's dry ranch dressing mix, omitted the celery (my kids don't care for celery) and I used 2% sharp cheddar cheese. I did need a couple more tortillas than what was stated in the recipe. I did what my father in law always did and layered a couple slices of good deli sliced roast beef before rolling it up. As always, we loved this. NOTE: If you do what I did and use a homemade ranch mix, you won't have an issue with salty pinwheels.

These are a great crowd pleaser.  You can add thin sliced turkey, ham or what ever you choose.  I make a variety...something for everyone. I have also add grilled leftover veggies  (peppers, onions, mushrooms, pineapples and diced chicken)  excellent!  Thanks for a keeper!

These turned out great!  I added a slice of deli ham to the top of the cream cheese mixture before rolling to make them a bit more substantial.  I made them for my, my husbands, and my daughter's office parties as well as a party my mother had at her senior living apartment complex........HUGE hit every single time!!!

These were very good.  I think they were a touch salty...next time, instead of lessening the ranch mix, I'm going to add one more block of cream cheese (and increase the other ingredients accordingly).  I did not use celery.  I combined all the ingredients together and spread once instead of sprinkling the toppings over the cream cheese mixture.  These are VERY pretty looking appetizers.  I will surely make these again.  This made eight pinwheels using 10-inch tortillas.

I took these to a cookout a couple weeks ago, and talk about a hit!  Even I was pretty impressed!  I made a little change though.  I put everything in the food processor, including 3/4 package of imitation crab meat.  I thought it made the recipe go a little farther while still keeping it moist. I had no problems adding the entire package of ranch mix as other people have said.  I didn't think it was too salty at all.  I've already been asked to take these to the next cookout we're going to this weekend!

We really loved these. I did use half an envelope of ranch, red and orange bell pepper and I used fresh white corn (raw) cut from the cobb instead of celery. I also added fresh parsley for some green color. The corn made this pinwheel over the top good!!!

I made this with some alterations:

I used garden vegetable cream cheese, and added some Sriracha for a bit of spice.  I used chopped green onion, red pepper, spinach, carrots, dill pickle, and sharp cheddar.  I made four different types by making some veggie, and adding deli roast beef and/or bacon bits to some.  I also used tomato basil wraps.

Everyone loved these!  Thankfully I kept the ends that I cut off as leftovers, because they were gone right away!  Delicious and flavorful!

I've made these a few times and I think they are wonderful.  The combination of flavor and different textures is what makes this dis unique.  I used the Fiesta Ranch seasoning packet instead and it really added so much more flavor.

These are so good!  I increased the cheddar cheese and used pimentos instead of bell pepper.  I also left out the olives since it was for a party and not everyone likes olives.  I served it with salsa and it was big hit.

Great EASY recipe. I used the pre-chopped olives that another reviewer suggested. I substituted carrots for the celery, and used a food processor on a low setting to chop the peppers, and carrots to save time. By only spreading the cream cheese mixture from top to bottom, but leaving the 2 inches from each side bare (the ends you will cut off anyway), I was able to make 8 (12 inch) rolls instead of 4.

I followed a previous posters advice and only used 1/2 the package of ranch mix. I also eliminated the olives. I had to leave the festivities to get mochas for the crowd before the food was served but when I returned there were only a few left! I had at least 3 people ask me for the recipe and many more telling me how great it was! The best part about this recipe is that you get to cut off the ends during the preparation and sample it! I was able to spread the mixture over 6 tortillas. I also followed another posters advice and used different flavored tortillas for a nice visual presentation. 
This is a recipe deserving of the 5 stars it got!

Everyone loved these.  I used sundried tortillas, 1/2 pkg soup mix, skipped the olives and celery, and used roasted red peppers. I tried different cheeses on each tortilla: cheddar, monterey jack, mexican blend, and a combination; all were hits.

These were delicious! Will be making these on a regular basis. Used a green (spinach?) tortilla, the color made these look great. Everyone who ate them told me how good they were. After reading the reviews, I used the entire ranch packet but used an extra package of cream cheese. When rolling these up, be sure to roll them as tight as possible, thats's what holds them together and helps them keep their shape. Oh, also added bacon bits at my husband's request, it was a nice addition.

I made these for a party on Saturday and they were a hit! All of the appetizers took a while to dwindle down but mine...was the first to go. Everyone kept telling me how wonderful they were. I used the garden vegetable tortilla's and with those...the red pepper....shredded cheese...green onion and diced up pea pods....they were as appealing to the eye as they were to the taste. I will definietly be making these again and again. Thank you for making my appetizer a hit!

The ranch was very overpowering in these and I didn't care for it.  Others recommended using 1/2 packet of ranch and that might make a big difference but I did not like the recipe as is.  It was a quick, easy, and attractive enough recipe that I would try it again using the modification. 

I used tomato basil tortillas and they made for a nice, colorful presentation.  A little tip when making pinwheels is to spread the filling to within about 1/4" of the edge of the tortilla but not all the way to the edge.  This will keep the cream cheese from oozing out when you wrap them.  Also, leave just a small margin of cream cheese without toppings on it at the edge to "seal" the tortilla against itself.

Excellent! I doubled the recipe and made the rolls the night before. A big hit at my party and they were fun to make. I will try to roll the pinwheels a little tighter next time, but they still stayed together and looked great!

I really enjoyed these, though I did find that the amount of ranch seasoning that the recipe calls for to be a little too much, so next time I will probably use less or omit it all together.  And also besides being good they were also fun to make and they look good when you plate them.

These were really good. I forgot to put the cheddar cheese in, but still delicious. I do think that the amount of cream cheese was too much for four large tortillas -- I would have preferred it spread a little more thinly on maybe five.

I brought these for a work function and everyone was very impressed.  They didn't believe that I made them, they thought I had bought them!  The whole envelope of ranch mix is too much.  I started by putting a little over a tablespoon and it was still too salty and I had to add more cream cheese to tame it down.  Add a little at a time to prevent them from getting too salty.

These pinwheels were delicious and a hit at my party!  I made the first batch as listed in the recipe, but for the second batch, I used Hidden Valley Ranch's Fiesta Ranch mix with the cream cheese.  This gave them a more southwest/salsa taste.  It also made the cream cheese a pink color which made for a nice display when I had them on the tray with the others that just had the white filling.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this recipe. I make some changes occasionally.  Instead of ranch dressing, I add some taco seasoning and a little taco sauce. I mince up the veggies and stir them in the cream cheese mix along with some shredded cheese. I spread it all on the tortilla. Yum!

EXCELLENT!! I used made this for a party last night where I only knew one person (the person who invited me!)  They were the first things to disappear!  I didn't use olives or red pepper but instead substituted some red pepper and onion relish.  Delicious, easy, and vegetarian which always helps when going blind to a party!  5 stars, I will definitely make these again!

I made these for a staff party and they were super good. Chilled them overnight and they weren't soggy like others said. I had them individually wrapped in saran wrap and cut them right before serving. Also, I'm not the biggest ranch fan so I didn't use it. It tastes fine without it. I also made mine without celery. Personal taste again. And I added chopped green chilies from a can. Two thumbs up! Use different coloured wraps for a nice presentation!

This got rave reviews at the potluck and not one was left!  My husband loved them as well.  You can really do alot with these.  I ran out of red bells and used chopped tomatoes for the rest, used lite cream cheese and 3/4 pkg of ranch dressing (which worked perfect).  Added different deli meats (ham and turkey were favored).  Also to some of them, I added a little dijon mustard on top of the cream cheese mixture - which was also good!  Some got green leaf lettuce too... all worked well!  Just make sure the liquid is out of the more wet ingredients (like the lettuce, olives, tomatoes).

Excellent! My husband doesn't like onions so I eliminated the green onions and used a Hidden Valley Ranch Fiesta salad dressing powder to give it some kick. I then used a food processor on the red pepper, celery and black olives. They were a hit!

These were amazing.  I decreased the amount of ranch dressing mix to about 3/4 of 1 oz., but they probably would've tasted just as good with 1 full oz.  I also made a second batch and added some chopped chipotle peppers with adobo to the cream cheese mixture.  Those were the first to go!

These are easy, pretty and very popular.  I used about half poblano pepper instead of half the bell pepper to give it a Christmas-y look and a little more zip. An amount based on a pound of cream cheese filled 4 10-inch tortillas and made about 48 slices.   I like to roll them in wax paper and store the rolls in a gallon food bag.  The wax paper seems easier to handle.  You can save time by slicing them as soon as they're chilled and then rolling them back up for later.

These were delicious! Because of the “too salty” complaints, I used half a packet of Ranch Dressing mix, added cooked shredded chicken (3 breasts), and about a half cup of sour cream to the cream cheese mixture. They were a hit at my party. (I just didn't like how the spinach wraps that I used were soggy and slimy after being overnight in the fridge.)

I love this recipe!  I made these for a party and they were a huge hit. I modified the recipe slighly based on earlier reviews. I mixed 1 1/2 T of ranch dip and 1/2 T of mild taco seasoning in with the cream cheese, I omited the celery, and added red and yellow peppers and turkey. They were great! I also used thin white wraps instead of tortillas - they rolled up perfectly with no tearing.

These are great!  I have made them twice now, however the second time I made them at about 9 p.m. and refridgerated them over night for the next day, at about noon, and they were soggy.  The first time I had them in the refridgerator for about 6 hours and they were perfect.

Wonderful!  I rough-chopped the olives (I used Greek kalamatas) and the other veggies in the food processor first, then blended with the cream cheese mixture to which I had added a little mayo for a smoother consistency.
We had about 25 guests so I doubled the recipe and made the cheese mixture a couple of days ahead to meld the flavors and blended the chopped vegetables just before assembling.

I had to make a ton of these for a big Birthday party this weekend, so I multiplied the recipe by 3. It told me to use 3 packages of ranch dressing mix...but after reading some reviews about it being pretty salty I decided to use two. I also substituted roasted red peppers instead of just plain bell peppers, and added a layer of thin deli-cut salami after spreading the cream cheese mix. All I have to say is...WOW! These are so addicting! Everyone loved them and I kept getting requests for the recipe! They are a little time consuming if you have to do a lot of them, but it is well worth it! If I could give these 10 stars I would. I will be making these for every party from now on.

I made this exactly as the recipe states and they were delicious! I had them at a party and we ran out and people were asking for more! The only thing I would do different is roll them tighter. I didn't roll them tight enough so when I cut them they were unrolling some!

I made this for a small wedding. They turned out great. I used orange bell pepper instead of red, and I used 1/2 pkg of Fiesta Ranch Dip mix instead (per batch). I used chopped olives instead of sliced and a mexican shredded cheese mix. I used spinach and tomato tortilla wraps to add color.

I thought this was really good. I used jalepeno cheddar tortillas instead of regular ones, because I hate the taste of plain tortillas and I think they look tastier with different colored tortillas. It did however seem to make way too much of the cream cheese mixture, but that's okay because i used it as a veggie dip for the next couple of days. I also omitted the cheese just to save on calories. Really good!

These were yummy! I halved the cream cheese and the ranch mix and omitted the celery, but kept everything else the same. I used WW tortillas and chopped black olives and just mixed everything together to make it easier to roll. I did make them the night before, and the tortilla got a little softer than I would've liked, but next time, I'll just make them the same day. I will be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Perfect party snacks! Devoured in mintues! Wrapping tightly the night before in foil definately helped cut and look nice on the serving plate. The more the cream cheese mix, the better!

These just have WAY too much cream cheese filling, so I would suggest adding more vegetables or maybe some meat or lettuce to even out the excessive cream cheese explosion..Other than that, these are very easy to make and they do taste good!

Awesome recipe for simple, summery appetizer! We used tortillas we had in the fridge and cut everything in half since and still got about 27 pinwheels. We used white tortillas (that's what was home), very thing deli turkey, reduced fat cream cheese, regular onions instead of green onions, and

Delicious and easy to make! Made these for a Golden anniversary party for some dear friends- and these disappeared! Use a sturdy tortilla- I used an authentic locally made tortilla which tasted good but was very flaky and when I rolled them the tortillas weren't quite "tough" enough and began to flake. Next time I will use a national brand type tortilla because I find them not to be as tender- a little easier to roll. Thanks for the great recipe!

these were great and very easy to make!  I would suggest cutting them right out of the fridge but let them sit at room temp for 30 mins before serving--- they taste much better when they aren't cold!  Also, get the can with diced olives... it's a pain to dice them yourself.

These are my favorite pinwheels, so addicting! Instead of using a Ranch packet, I use the same amount of seasonings used in the Ranch Dressing II from this site (just omit the mayo and sour cream).

A wonderful party appetizer. I made these for a party last week and everyone loved them. I followed the advice of other reviewers and put only half of the seasoning packet, and that was perfect. When I ran low on celery, I made some with finely shredded carrot. What I loved about this recipe is that the pinwheels are good and firm, especially after being well-chilled. This means they are easy to slice and arrange on a platter. Most importantly, this also makes them easy to eat, too. (I hate sloppy, messy appetizers!) Finally, I love that they can be made in advance. One note: these are pretty easy to make, but do allow plenty of time for prep. All the washing and chopping of vegetables, then the actual spreading and rolling, all takes a while. Thanks!

Mmmm! My boyfriend commented that I made way too many of these for our football party today, but they were all gone a few hours later! I used 10 flour tortillas and had a large serving plate full of pinwheels. I omitted the onions since my boyfriend hates them. I added sliced ham to a few of them, used green pepper and black olives together, and made some with just one or the other. Used a 'fiesta blend' of cheeses on some and just plain cheddar on others. Very good, thank you so much!

I made these for a party which about 50 people attended.  By the end of the night the plate looked like it had been licked clean!  I omitted the celery, used fiesta ranch mix instead of regular ranch, added yellow bell peppers, mixed the shredded cheddar in with the cream cheese instead of on top, and used sun-dried tomato and spinach flavored sandwich wraps instead of tortillas.  Arranged on a platter they looked festive and were delicious.  The only thing I would do different next time is maybe use a little less fiesta ranch mix.  It was a little on the salty side.  Besides that these were delicious and I can't wait to make them again.

These were delicious!  The only change I made was instead of using celery, I used some yellow bell pepper.  I also used diced black olives rather than sliced.  I spread the mixture on sun dried tomato tortillas and spinach tortillas.  My guests loved these.  The flavor was great - not too salty to me once it was all mixed together and spread on the tortillas.  And all the crunch inside was very good.  Will save this in my recipe box to make again and again.

These are so tasty!  I made them twice to make sure I made them right for a party.  The first time I didn't think I used enough pepper or celery, so the second time I added in much more (maybe close to 1 - 1 & 1/2 cups each?) which gave a much better crunch.  I also added in more green onion the second time - three "stalks" instead of two.  I left out the olives due to personal preferences of the guests.  I also used the fiesta ranch mix as another reviewer suggested... not sure how it would compare to original ranch, but I loved it!  I used low fat cream cheese both times.  Also, I mixed everything except the shredded cheese together before spreading it.  Just make sure the cream cheese is soft to make it easier to spread.  Wonderful recipe, I'll definitely be making this for other events!

Sorry, this recipe did nothing for me, beside waste a bunch of ingrediants.  Too salty (perhaps using fresh olives would help, the canned ones are really, really salty), not enough flavor of the ingrediants, and the prep time is WAY underestimated (perhaps I'm really slow, but spreading the cream cheese slowly enough to not wrip the tortillas and rolling them took me forever).  

I would definitely recommend adding sandwich meat or spices... or just trying something else!

WONDERFUL! Colorful, tasty and a big hit at my party. I doubled the recipe and used 4 8oz pkgs of cream cheese, 1oz of dry ranch, 1 diced red pepper, 1 small can of chopped olives, 2 large diced stalks of celery, and 3 sliced green onions. I blotted the chopped veggies to removed moisture then mixed into the cream cheese and ranch. Spread a pretty thick layer over a 12" tortilla wrap, then sprinkled a little sharp cheddar/jack blend on top before rolling up. Chilled for 4 hours before slicing into 1/2" thick rounds. I had enough mixture for 6 wraps.

I have taken these to several parties and everyone loves them!!!  They are always asking for the recipe.  Of course, most of them don't even make it out the door... I tend to snack on them to make sure they taste just right!  :)

I added turkey and some fresh spinach but eliminated the olives and celery. They were delicious, however, they are a little rich, in my opinion- but they are a real hit at parties!

Assuming you do not want to read through all 700-plus reviews, here is a quick synopsis. A great many reviewers redeuced ranch dressing to half or slightly less., b/c too salty issuse abounded . Some subbed in fiesta ranch ( half amout OR  to taste)) Consider skipping olives for large crowds as some people do not care for them .Avoid getting veggies to outer 1 inch as chunks can make them harder to stay wrapped.  OR have tooth picks on hand to secure. Wrap tightly Seam side down on foil then wrap tight in foil.
VARIATIONS ABOUND.  TRY things like good  deli roast beef and a little horse radish  sauce. 
Mexican Version : Sub ranch seasoning for Taco Seasoning,  Add in chopped Cilantro,jalapenos. Try Pepper Jack for a heat kick

I certainly haven't read every review, but it seems like no one has considered including deli meats in these pinwheels. Someone said it lacked a bold flavor, well it won't with salami or capicola. Molto buono!

I was very skeptical about this recipe, but the glowing reviews convinced me to give it a shot for a party.  I skipped the celery and onion and just used the bell pepper and 12 diced olives and about 1/2 a block of smoked cheddar, shredded.  I mixed the ranch, cheese and diced pepper all together with the cream cheese.  Then I sprinkled with the diced olives (I used Kalamatas so I didn't want it to be overpoweringly olive-y).  Rolled them up in the foil and actually left them in the fridge for 2 days before I used them.  Sliced them up about 1/2 hour before serving.  Got lots of compliments on these.  I was afraid of soggy tortillas, but that was a nonissue.  I will use these for parties again.  They are popular and easy.

I've been using this exact recipe for over 7 years. We've never found it too salty and I've never changed or added anything to the recipe. The longer you leave the rolls in the fridge before serving the better they taste. They are delicious and people go nuts at our parties for these, so I always include em.

Maybe one packet can be too salty, but if you add in enough other ingredients it really mellows it out.  I added all the ingredients directly into the blender to create one cohesive, spreadable "dip" (it is, by the way, fantastic as a dip, too).  By blending it so smoothly it covered more than only four tortillas.  I added a whole can of drained corn, a whole can of rinsed/drained black beans, and a teaspoon or more of cumin to warm up the flavor (not enough to make it spicy, though).  These things disappeared and I was asked multiple times for the recipe.  Really, though, stir in whatever you like, and don't be afraid to blend it on medium speed.  It really distributed all the flavors well.

Yuck.  These were like eating a container of cream cheese on a soggy flour tortilla, and I even made homemade ranch seasoning.  I made them for a party and they weren't touched.  I was embarrassed my name was on them.

I have made this recipe many times and it is always a huge hit. You can change the veggies, add some spice, throw in some sliced turkey...there is so much you can do with this recipe! My only tip is to make more, I always end up with an empty patter before the party is over. The cream cheese will taste really salty at first but after they refrigerate overnight they will be fine.

Made these last minute for a Christmas party and they were great. I don't like ranch dressing mix, so I just chopped up a couple of tablespoons of chives, parsley and dill and added a dash of garlic powder and some lemon juice. Used a mix of red and green bell peppers, finely diced zucchini instead of celery and subbed low-fat mayo and sour cream for four ounces of cream cheese to lighten it up a bit.

I made these as written and took them to our Easter gathering.  Even though all but 4 were consumed, I wasn’t all that thrilled with them.  They were ok, but not something I would make again.  As you roll the tortilla the filling wants to ooze out as you finish the roll.   But I found that if I left about 1 1/2" of the tortilla bare, there was far less oozing.

I really liked this recipe!  The filling firms up nicely in the refrigerator which allows for perfect slicing once removed and they held their shape nicely.  I followed several suggestions of reviewers and tried these with the ranch dressing mix but also with Italian dressing mix.  I preferred the ranch, however my taste testers preferred the Italian.  I used red, orange and yellow peppers, finely diced and added a little mayo to make the filling more spreadable.  I also microwaved the tortillas for 10 seconds before spreading the filling, as suggested, to help roll them tighter, easier and it worked beautifully.  I tried the filling on red pepper basil tortillas, spinach vegetable tortillas, and plain flour tortillas.  The flavored tortillas were delicious!!

I have had this recipe in my box for a Long time. I finally made them and WOW am I glad I did!! These were really good!  I made these with both ham and roast beef. They are perfect for a crowd. I even sprinkled  a  couple of the rolls with blue cheese crumbles. Took em to a pot luck and the Ladiez loved them. Use any kind of veggie you like as long as you chop them up pretty small. Once you cut them into slices, the rolls are so festive, it's easy to see why they disapear when you make them. Thank you MM.

I used turkey in some of mine for a little extra bulk and flavor, and even though the crowd loved them I think next time a little shredded cheese and more veggies (brocolli, cauliflower, cucumber...) will be even better.Very good- chilling them is a must!

These are de-licious!  I served this at a wine night/party with a bunch of women and had to print out the recipe for all of them.  I used an orange bell pepper, spinach tortillas and sun-dried tomato tortillas to add color.

I personally don't think these are anything special,  but I am giving them five stars any way because they are always a hit at parties.  I like that they are simple and look really cute.  From time to time I switch up what I put it them depending what I have on hand.  I usually leave the celergy out as well.  Adding some crumbled bacon really perks them up too.  I did slightly reduce the ranch as other said it was too salty.  I just season to taste.  I like to use whole wheat tortillas as well.

I made these and everyone loved them!  The only things I changed were that I mixed it all together instead of topping the mixture with the peppers and olives (we didn't add celery).  It was too tedious to top it all and easier to just spread it all on.  I used orange bell pepper and it added sweetness and toned down the dip a bit.  I think using the red pepper is why some may have found it a bit salty, but the orange pepper helped that!

I made these with orange peppers instead of red and everyone loved them. I thought they were too cream cheesy tasting myself. If i make them again I would buy a fun kind of tortilla, they looked kind of plain with just the normal flour.

Fantastic recipe, my kids even loved them.  My suggestion would be to cut down on the Ranch mix just a bit to take out some of the saltiness.  We also added ham or turkey to ours.  Definately a party hit.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this for a Superbowl party yesterday.  Everyone loved it!  I wasn't sure about the celery, but I put it in anyway and it added a very nice texture to the food.  Countered the creamy cheese with some crunch!  Good stuff!

I have been making these pinwheels for a couple years now and they are always a huge hit. I always have people asking for the recipe. I usually mix the veggies in with the cream cheese mixture to make the process a little quicker.

Very easy.  I recommend chopping the veggies very small to make rolling easier and the presentation better.  I made these for a potluck and they were the first things to go...and that was with a roasted turkey and spiral ham right next to them!

Excellent app and very easy to make   The only draw back was the tortilla got soggy by the next day. I was so looking for eating the leftovers but couldn't.

I have used this recipe and included a cup of cooked white rice and some sour cream.  I don't believe I used the celery instead I used chopped water chestnuts.  It's very good, goes further and keeps your guest wondering what ?????  Try  it sometime

This is a big hit every time I make it. It's really easy to make and it's a fun way to eat some veggies. I switch up the veggie ingredients for some variety. I've found that matchstick carrots work well. Also, I use less cream cheese and use Ranch salad dressing instead of the dressing mix.

I have made these for just about every gather I attend and they are always a hit. I did use 3 packages of cream cheese to help cut down on the saltiness and omitted the olives. I also love the crunch of the veggies so I add a lot.

After reading the reviews, I only used half a package of the ranch dressing mix. These were amazing.  I used different flavors of tortillas so that my platter was filled with 3 different colors.  Everyone raved about them and asked for the recipe. It was fast and easy and a great hit at parties.

These were easy to make and a hit at my party! Don't make the mistake I did of mixing the peppers into the cream cheese before spreading, it makes spreading pretty difficult.

Way too salty!  They made a beautiful presentation though.  I'd definitely recommend using wraps instead of tortillas.  They don't tear as easily.

OMG!!!  These are so good!!  I used different flavors/colors of tortillas and doubled the recipe.  I made three types...veggie, ham/veggie, and turkey/veggie.  For the double recipe, I used about 1.5 pkgs of ranch seasoning.  I have a bad feeling that I didn't make nearly enough for the party!!

I guess  I did it wrong.  Nowhere did it say to put a LOT of creamcheese filling in the middle, so I had the cheese/etc falling out of it.

Delicious!  I omitted the olives just because I don't like them.  I used all the ranch packet and didn't find them too salty at all.  But by omitting the olives that could have cut down on the saltiness that others have mentioned.  I used 5 tortillas instead of 4 and feel like I could have even used 6.  Instead of sprinkling on the celery, red peppers and cheddar cheese onto the cream cheese mixture I combined all ingredients and then spread it onto the tortillas.  I made sure the tortillas were room temp or slightly warmed in the microwave before spreading the mixture on to avoid the tortillas cracking when rolling.  Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing!

I have made several different types of these in the past and this is my least favorite recipe by far.  They were finished by the end of the evening but I will not be making them again.  I even lowered the amount of the ranch seasoning but I thought they were lacking in taste.

Made mine with a packet of Fiesta Ranch because they were out of regular. It made it orange and AWESOME.  Seriously good stuff. I also used the tomato wraps as well because of color and I don't think they get as dried out.  These are better than the pepperoni version I've usually made in the past. Tasty! Oh - I also used an orange pepper but I don't it would have made much difference. Just colorful all around.

Excellent.  I tried freezing these and they came out wonderful.  Another do ahead recipe for the busy holiday season.  I used a dried tomato and basil wrap.  They looked so pretty and were gone in about 15 min.

Really good and really simple for me. Was a huge hit at the Push America function for people with Intellectual Disabilities. It is good to make as it cuts into quite a few pieces so it is actually pretty economical to make for a crowd.

I am surprised this is rated so highly. The Ranch dressing mix was way too strong of flavor & salt. I should have used less or none at all. I just didn't care for the combination of vegetables. This would be better with turkey& slices of cheese than this mixture. Won't be making again.

I had to break out the 5 star here, this recipe was terrific.  I followed almost exactly, I used spinach tortillas instead of plain for colour but the rest was exactly as written.  I took them to a baby shower and was glad I doubled the recipe, because they only lasted about 10 minutes as it was.  Just about everyone went home with the recipe, they were that good.

There is no way to mess this recipe up!
I run a catering business and people ask for these over and over again. Try laying green, red, or yellow peppers(one or all)in long thin slices as you roll them up. Or lay ham, or turkey, or roast beef on the cream cheese. Add bacon slices or salsa to the cream cheese. The possibilities are endless.

These were not phenomenal by any means.  I thought they would be great because of the reviews but I was not impressed.  The prep time alone, I was surprised by, especially when it only ended up making 5 rolled up tortillas and then I refridgerated them over night and when I served them the next day they were just not all that great.  The tortillas were slightly soggy and doughy, probably from the moisture in the veggies.  And the flavor was just not that great.  BBQ meatballs would have tasted much better and been much easier as well.  I think I will keep searching for a crowd pleasing appetizer.

Love this recipe! Have made this several times and it is always a huge hit! I use red, orange and yellow peppers to add color! I also use flavored tortillas. My favorites are tomato/basil and garlic! I also cut back on the ranch dressing mix as suggested to cut back on the salty flavor! Great recipe! Will make many times again in the future! Thanks!

With a few changes, these were great! I used the whole packet of ranch mix but added a 3 oz. pack of cream cheese as well. I used Mexican shredded cheese, added bacon bits, and used a whole red bell pepper instead of just 1/2 cup. This recipe covered 6 tortillas for me. I also chilled them for a few hours before slicing them.

Excellent!  I made these for a Christmas party I went to with my boyfriend where I hardly new anyone.  These were the hit of the party!  Nothing left to take home (and I am the only one who can say that)!  I made a few minor changes.... I used sun-dried tomato tortillas and chile-jalapeno tortillas to get into the holiday spirit (3 of each, although the green ones were the fajita size).  I also used 1 8 oz lite plain cream cheese and 1 8 oz vegetable cream cheese.  I took the other reviewers advise and used not quite all of the ranch mix (I meant to use 3/4 but used a little more than that).I used my handy dandy chopper for the peppers and celery.  Simple, easy, and delicious!

Yum!  I did do things a bit differently though...all I had around the house was a green pepper and a cucumber, so those were my veggies.  I also added some shredded sharp cheddar cheese, a bit of low fat mayo and a bit of turkey to the mix.  The cheddar cheese is a must! To help you roll them better, I suggest you leave the veggies out when mixing the cream cheese and ranch together (and cheese if you add it)...spread it over your tortillas and then do a row of veggies on one end of it.  This helps you to get a nice, tight roll up.  I wrapped them in saran wrap and let them sit overnight in the fridge...they sliced up beautifully the next day for a shower I was throwing.  Nice and light...

These are delicious.  I took them to a graduation party/picnic over the weekend, and they were the hit of the party.  I added sliced ham to them for a little extra flavor.  Everyone LOVED them.  I read other reviewers that had problems with the tortillas splitting.  I used the whipped cream cheese, and it spread like butter!

These are very delicious!  The key is to wrap them tightly and refrigerate them for ca. 24 hours before slicing and serving.  I left out the celery and bell peppers and added finely chopped jalepeno peppers and used taco seasoning instead of the ranch dressing mix.

So here's a much faster way to make these delicious pinwheels...
Use the vegetable cream cheese from Philadelphia and then add a little hot sauce and small pieces of red pepper and zuchinni.  Spread VERY thinly and DEFINITELY refrigerate overnight.  Delicious, easy, and a huge party hit!

ENJOY!

I am in Austria, so I am always looking for recipes that I can doctor up with the ingredients here. You can use basically and dry salad dressing mix for the cream cheese base. Everyone loved these. (By everyone I mean over 30 students) I make them for every party now. Thanks

These are delicious!  I didn't roll them tight enough, but they still tasted so good!  you really do have to roll VERY tightly so that when you cut them, they don't fall apart.  At any rate, my guests thought they were fantastic!

These were incredibly tasty.  I made these for a dinner party and everyone wanted the recipe.  I added the shredded cheese but it was not necessary as the cream cheese made it rich enough.  The crunchy vegetables were a nice contrast to the rich salty cheese spread.

These were awesome!  Very easy to make, but a little time consuming.  I like that you can make them a day ahead to save time.  They tasted great and looked nice on the buffet table.  Will definitely make again and again.

Made exactly as directed and I was worried because the filling tasted salty at first. However, the flavors melded perfectly after sitting overnight. I recommend making the night before. Perfect and everyone loved them!

These were a huge hit. The recipe does not call out for Turkey but the picture shows Turkey in the wrap. The key is to put the cream cheese down, add the toppings and layer the Turkey on last. This keeps all the toppings in place so they don't spill out. I did not add olives to mine. Will definitely make again!

I have a very picky family, who are all good cooks. So it is hard to find something new for a family get together that everyone will like. I made these last year for Christmas Eve and everyone loved them. In fact, my Aunt (who is the most particular of them all) even asked me to make them again this year. I made these as is and they are delicious!! I love pinwheels and these are the best I have ever had!

What a tasty recipe!!  Easy and fun to make.  I traded out plain flour tortillas with spinich, very good.  The only thing I would change next time....my tortilla wrapping skills need help.  You have to wrap tighter than you would think!!

I threw a party months ago and people still bring these up to me!! I made meatballs and other finger food stuff too but my bff is a vegetarian so I made these used Jalapeno and Roasted Tomato wraps. The Jalapeno wraps give it a great kick of flavor. Some people don't like olives so I made a few without but then my guests said they taste complete with the olives even though they don't like them so don't leave them out! My next party I have to make mountains or else I "have some splaining to do" lol

Made these to take to a trivia night.  Had to leave some home for husband and sons to enjoy.  They were a hit.  Actually get better and less salty tasting the longer they sit, so I recommend making the night before or at least chilling them even longer than it calls for.  Will definitely make again.

So good!! I only used 1/2 to 3/4 of the ranch mix like others suggested. This recipe will be one I make from now on for get togethers. Did use orange bell pepper instead of red and chopped black olives. PERFECT.

These are super little snacks that everyone always loves!  I have made these on a few occasions and the combinations are endless in terms of veggies, grated cheese and the tortillas themselves.  I like using orange or yellow pepper and usually add some of my own dried seasonings to the cream cheese.  YUMMY :)

I hate to give a negative review on such a highly rated recipe, but we did not enjoy these. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used a mix of yellow and green bell pepper (what I had on hand). I thought they were very salty. The ranch is flavor is a bit overpowering, in my opinion. I will not make these again.

I switched out some of the veggies for others, (used celery/radishes/sun-dried tomatoes), and we liked these very much. We served with salads and veggies with dip. Thanks for sharing!

Very versatile recipe, always a crowd favorite! So easy too, perfect for a cookout or get-together. I used green (spinach flavored) tortillas for more color, subbed neufchatel for cream cheese and sprinkled crumbled bacon, diced roasted red peppers and a mexican cheese blend for more flavor. Brought them to a "jewelry party" and they were devoured!

The only change I made was using chopped olives instead of sliced, and I accidentally bought the 8" tortillas, but I just had 6 then, instead of 4.  These were SO good, and they went so fast, I didn't even get one.  I got to eat the ends though, so it's OK.  I will make these many more times, probably upon request, because they were RAVED about!  Also plan on doubling them, it made way less than I would've figured, and most people wanted more than one.

WOW! These were great and I had no leftovers! I suggest dicing the veggies small as its easier to roll up. I only had italian seasoning on hand but I tend to interchange the two in recipies a lot. Follow the recipie before you modify! I plan to add more/different veggies or meat to have some variety next time.

Delicious recipe...everyone loved them, but be careful with the ranch, the amount the recipe calls for is too much; way to salty.

I made these for New Years Eve and everyone loved them.  They were one of the first apps to go.  THe only thing I eliminated was the black olives because I don't like them.  I also added bacon bits.  Will make these again

I look at all recipes as a foundation..which is why I don't bake because you have to follow the directions pretty precisly. I have been making a version of these for years. My suggestion is, look at the recipe, amounts, key ingrediets, and make it your own! If I had never seen this recipe I wouldn't have come up with my perfect wraps!

These are very good! I made them for a birthday party and most people really liked them. My son didn't care for them, and he usually likes everything but you can't win them all. I followed the recipe exact - I'd make these again - they were well worth the effort and they looked really good too.

Love this recipe. I take these to parties when requested to bring something because they are sooo easy to make Gluten Free.  I make 1 batch exactly as written for "regular" guests and then 1 batch of GF rollups for my sons and me (the regular guests love them too).  For the GF batch instead of flour tortillas I use thick cut deli ham or Turkey to roll the the ingredients up in.  When I use the ham, I skip the ranch dressing mix. Everything else stays the same.

I make these for many work/family functions.  Instead of celery I dice jalapeno peppers with or without the seeds, depending on the heat level I want to achieve.  They are awesome.  Either the too salty comes from not mixing the dressing mix thoroughly and biting into a chunk of it.  I am definitely not a salt person and this is definitely not too salty.

I still gave these a good rating because I believe they WOULD have been good, but I just wanted to issue a warning.  Do NOT make them with fat free cream cheese, even if it is the only thing available the night before the Super Bowl.  My new mantra, "It is better to go without cream cheese than to use fat-free."

I think they would have been great with real cream cheese.  Maybe next year?

These pinwheels were a big hit at our Super Bowl part. I personally thought they were pretty salty and never time I'd add less ranch mix, maybe 1/2 a pack. The only changes I made to the recipe was I used Fiesta Ranch mix and add bacon bits to some of the tortillas.

I thought these were OK but not great by any means. Followed the recipe exactly except used an orange bell pepper instead of red. I know a lot of people like these, but it was not my favorite taste. Nonetheless, I will probably make these next time I have a informal gathering as they are an easy finger food that people seem to enjoy.

We didn't find this recipe to be salty (used 2 packs cream cheese per 1 pack ranch dressing mix) and even added sliced ham. the recipe was enough for 6 large Mission spinach tortillas

I have had something similar to this and thought they were good.Would be great for a party.This might sound weird but the liquid that the olives are canned in are salty and thought it you rinse the olives before using them,would that cut down the salty taste some reviewers are talking about?

This was good and easy to do but it was definitely high in the sodium count. I'm not sure what made it so salty tasting but if I could reduce that in half it would have been perfect.  I did Calculate it down to only 8 servings so maybe that's where the trouble was.  Either way, it was still pretty good.

These are always the first to go! so simple yet sooo delicious! a whole pack of ranch is def to much, way to salty but no one ever complains! I mix everything together then spread onto tortilla in one swoop.  i bet this would be good with taco seasoning in place of ranch too!

I thought these were pretty good.  They were fairly easy to make but I did have a slight problem with a few of mine starting to unroll so I just stuck a toothpick through them and that solved the problem.  I followed the recipe exactly this time around but I like another reviewer's suggestion about cutting down on labor by buying veggie cream cheese.  If I make these again I will probably give that a try.  Not only will it be easier, but will make less of a mess too!

Used recipe just as a general guideline.  Instead of ranch dressing mix, used celery salt and a pinch of cayenne.  Also reduced the amount of cream cheese.  Used bell pepper, olives and yellow summer squash instead of celery.  YUM YUM

This is my new favorite appetizer recipe. I needed a make ahead snack for an office meeting and a birthday dinner. This turned out to be the perfect recipe. I used 3 packages of creamed cheese, about 1/2 a package of ranch dressing, 4 onions, some red bell pepper, part of a can of olives, bacon bits and shredded sharp cheddar. I used 5 sun dried tomato wraps. I wrapped them in plastic wrap and refrigerated overnight. I sliced 2 of them for the meeting then went to the birthday dinner straight from work and sliced the other 3. Everybody raved about them and there were none left over. I will definitely be making these again.

I used the entire package of Ranch against the suggestion of several reviewers and wished I had listened! They were very salty, but still pretty delicious. I added jalapeno which the party guests seemed to like. Next time I will definitely halve the ranch mix!

These are excellent.  I omitted the celery as it is high in sodium and I found that I did not miss it. To cut corners I also substituted chopped pimiento for the diced red bell pepper.  I also used chopped black olives as they fit more neatly when rolled up.    I noticed that some others used red (sun-dried tomato) and green (spinach) tortillas.  These would look very festive for the holidays.

I loved these! So did everyone else at my sister's baby shower. I used Mission tortilla wraps in cheddar jalapeno and since it came with 6, I was able to make 6 and not only 4 as this recipe calls for. I used half of the ranch mix, omitted the celery, mixed the all the veggies into the cream cheese, spread the mix on the tortillas, sprinkled cheese and topped with pastrami slices. Came out perfect...yum!

A lot of people are mentioning how salty these can be...You might be using the wrong kind of ranch mix. The ranch dips package has double the sodium content of the regular dressing mix. Hope this helps! I have also made a taco version of these using taco mix. Yummy

I'd give this 3.5 stars, but I served them at a dinner party and people loved them.  I do think they have a bit too much cream cheese, would reduce it a bit next time.  You can rinse the olives to get rid of some of the salt as these can be a bit salty.

To be fair I rarely add salt to anything I make and don't eat very much salty food so perhaps I am more sensitive to the taste of salt. Anyone else like me will definitely find this unpalatably salty. It literally tasted like I had added 4 tablespoons of salt to the cream cheese. In my attempt to salvage the double batch I had started I added sour cream. It toned down the salt but left the mixture too wet for the wraps. I quit while I was ahead and used a vegetable garden cheese spread and invented my own wrap instead.   Thank you for the inspiration though :-)

Made these for a Happy Hour.  Used Spinach tortillas and low-fat cream cheese and the rest of the ingredients as is.   Easy to prepare but feel I did not allow enough time in the refrigerator - only 2 hours.  Next time, I will make them the night before so they really stick well together and are easier to slice.  Otherwise, a delicious appetizer!

AWESOME...I just made these the night before last for a Christening brunch yesterday.  Well...I set them out and went back to the kitchen to gather a few more things and by the time I got back to the room with the food THEY WERE ALL GONE!!!  Everybody thought I bought them somewhere and wanted the recipe =)

These were fantastic! A nice crunch makes them different from most others that are usually mushy, soft and all the same.

I made these for a quick lunch. Husband really liked them but I wasn't a big fan. Maybe with the addition of some kind of meat in the pinwheels, I could up the score for taste.

I made these for a work potluck.  Even though there were two other plates of rollups, these were gone in a matter of mins!  Everyone loved them.  I used light cream cheese, Fiesta Ranch mix(the entire packet), Mexican shredded cheese, red peppers, green onions, sliced black olives and used regular 12 inch tortilas.  There was no issues with saltiness(maybe the Fiesta Ranch helped with that).  I made them and let them sit overnight in the fridge, cut the next morning.  I wanted to add yellow and orange peppers as well but the store was out.  This will be my new dish to bring!

Excellent!  I made these for a party and had several requests for the recipe.  I followed others' suggestions and only used about half the pkg of ranch dressing.  I also added some cut up smoked turkey slices.  I would advice you to save a little bit of the cream cheese mixture to "glue" together any of the tortilla sections that may come apart when you start slicing.

Way too ranchy/salty.. I couldn't even eat them. Would probably be better with way less ranch and maybe some tomatoes or jalapenos.

These are fun and easy and everyone enjoys them. I made two changes ~ used only 1/2 ranch dressing mix (too salty otherwise) and diced olives as the first time I made them I felt the need to chop the sliced olives a bit. Definately use the sun-dried tomato/basil and/or the spinach tortillas. Makes the presentation!

Very yummy! I left out the celery and did not add all of the dressing mix. I think it would have been a little too salty.

These were great! Like others have mentioned, the ranch is a bit salty. I would suggest adding about 3/4 of the 1 ounce bag instead of the whole thing. Still tastes great though!  ***ETA: I am changing my 4 star rating to 5 stars because I have made these several times and everyone always loves them and there are never any leftovers. The ONLY change I make is I add only 3/4 of the package of ranch dressing. Its PERFECT that way!

I used this idea in conjunction with the cold veggie pizza recipe.I added mayonaise to the cream cheese and dip mix and used the veggies that would go on the pizza.It was a hit!Much better in the middle of summer to make the pinwheels instead of baking up a crust.Less messy as well.

These were not that good.  Something was wrong about the taste and too much cream cheese. As the one review said... "the least eaten appetizers"  Well remember that!  Need another combination to make them better.  Must of been the only appetizers available at the party?????

I was a little dissapointed in these. They tasted okay, not great, and were the least eaten appetizers out of the three appetizers that I brought to a party (the spinach dip that I made by combining a few different recipes and tips from this site was a hit). Also, when I combined banana peppers, and cucumbers as part of the filling they ended up tasting like pickles. I guess I should have drained the peppers better. I might make these again, but only one or two tortilla rolls.

Yummy and SO easy! I put these in the freezer for a few minutes before I sliced them so they'd hold their shape better. Even my boyfriend, who thinks he hates black olives, loved these (I didn't tell him they were in there until later). Good party fare because you can add different colors of peppers or flavored tortillas to brighten up the palette.

I used this recipe for baby shower appetizers.  I omitted the bell pepper, celery and black olives.  Instead, used the ranch base, added some deli sliced turkey and cucumber/carrot slivers.  THEY were a hit!  I found a hubby trying to eat a "log" that hadn't been cut up yet!  HA!

These were good with modifications.  Like other reviewers, I halved the ranch dressing mixed.  Still thought it was too salty so next time will put less.  I replaced the celery with yellow peppers.  And also added bacon instead of black olives.

these were a hit at the party. the only thin i thought it was missing something. i think these would be better with thinly sliced ham or panchetta.  i layered the tortilla then the ham then the scream cheese and toppings. i didn't added the celery the taste or celery is over powering to me also.

Yummy and easy and usually one of the first things to go. Trying to be helpful, husband bought red (tomato) and green (spinach) tortillas in addition to regular flour. ("Look, it's Christmas-y!") Don't do it; stick with the white flour tortillas. Flavored tortillas give them a funky taste. And not in a good way.

Brought them to a Halloween party and they were gone in five minutes!! I used Fiesta Ranch Mix and it gave a lot more flavor.  I also used orange and yellow bell peppers and tomato basil tortillas and omitted the black olives.  I will definately makes these again!

Fairly blah.  I used flavored tortillas and substituted garden veggie alouette for the cream cheese/ranch dip combo.  I LOVE alouette and it tasted good on its own, but once in the rollups, there just wasn't much flavor.  Skipped the olives because so many people don't like them.  I did make one with ham on it, and that one was better, but the ham prevented the rollup from sticking together (it blocked the cream cheese which is sort of like the glue), so if you want to do ham you probably need to chop it finely first.  I don't think I'll make these again.

I made these for a party and thought they were pretty good.  I made them about four hours before the party and they seemed to be a good texture at that time (tortilla not soggy). I reduced the amount of ranch to 3/4, since other reviewers said they were too salty, and I didn't feel that they were TOO salty, but they could have also mellowed a little longer for less saltiness. (Does that make sense?)  The flavor was pretty good and the colors were attractive.  I liked the crunchy vegetables inside.  I think more can be added, if desired.  I received some compliments on them, and would consider making again.

I loved these.  I tweaked them a bit.  I added 1/3 cup of mayo to make it more spreadable.  I also fried bacon and chopped it in a food processor and added to the cream cheese mixture.  I used smoked turkey and cheddar cheese.  I didn't use the veggies.  My company loved them so much that is all they want me to bring to every function

With regard to the saltiness, I too had the same grimace when I initially test-tasted the cream cheese mixture sans vegetables.  However, when the vegetables are added, it seems as though they assume some of the salt, and the mixture is not the least bit overwhelming.  I minced carrots, which vegetable certainly seemed to take away some of the saltiness.  (I looked at the reviews post-facto.  When made again, I would cut down on the ranch dressing mix.)

A very easy to make appetizer. I omitted the celery and olives, adding 1/2 cup of chopped green onion instead. Can make a few days ahead and slice as you need them (which is terrific over holiday seasons). Thanks for the recipe, Linda.

Very good flavor--took the advice of some of the other people & used fajita seasoning & ranch dressing deasoning since I couldn't find the zesty ranch.  Works great to make up ahead of time.  I made up two days before needed and they were still great!

Yum!  Brought these to a party & they were gone in the first 15 minutes!

I did take some others advice- I used vegetable cream cheese & about 3/4 of the ranch mix. 

Thanks for the recipe!!

This appetizer is incredibly easy to make. Just be sure to make it the day before and wrap it tightly in foil so that the tortillas keep their shape after cutting and the flavors have a chance to blend together.

This was very good, and every one raved about them.  I used the flavored tortillas and would recommend spreading the cream cheese a little more thickly on the side that is going to be on the very outside...using it sort of like a glue to hold everything closed.  I was in a hurry, so I wrapped them up and stuck them in the freezer before slicing.  Very good!

WOW - what a hit these were at the party I just took them to.....first things to go and I made a quadruple batch!  So - easy to double, triple, etc.  I made a batch just as the recipe called for (used up my garden stuff - yay) and then made batches adding Buddig sliced ham, OM sliced roast beef (in the little container) and chicken.  I don't care for turkey but I'm sure they would be awesome with that as well.  If you add the meat, you might want to cut back a bit on the filling as it's a teensy bit hard to roll.  The only hard part was chopping the veggies - will DEFINITELY make again and again and again.  Thanks for this recipe!

This was so good!  I didn't use the olives in mine and it still turned out wonderfully!  One recommendation thought is to not use a whole lot of cream cheese on each tortilla.  Just put a thin layer on each one, that's all you need.  Yum!

I made these for a party. They seemed to go well, but no one asked me for the recipe :(. I didn't add the onions b/c I thought the taste of onions would permeate the entire other tastes, especially since it needed to chill for a few hours.
They were easy to make, just a bit of prep with the chopping of things beforehand.

These are fabulous!  I've made this recipe several times for parties, and it's a huge hit everytime!  (Make sure to bring the recipe or weblink to give out to your friends.)  I did substitue the black olives with green olives, and it gave it a delicious flavor with the mix of veggies. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM...DELICOUS! You will be the hit of the party!

I've made these twice now and both times have been delicious. I am not a fan of olives, so I omitted them. I also didn't add the peppers because they are just too expensive right now. I did add in some chopped carrots instead. I personally think you can add your "crunch" toppings of choice. One other note, I used a chipolte ranch seasoning packet the first time. Added a really nice kick!

the secret to this receipe is to take it out of the refrigerater early and let it warm up before serving, other wise it will be tasteless and hard. The rortillas need to soften. You can make this with just cream cheese,sour cream and thin slices of ham,black olives,dised green chilies and pimentos for color. Serve with salsa.  you can make sweet ones using cream chees,mixed with orange marmalade,thin strips of chicken,green onions,or pinapple cream cheese.  Strawberry cream cheese, 1/2cup choc.frosting and 1 cup of chopped strawberries. spread choc.then cream cheese and top with strawberries.and roll up. each rollDo not get to close to the edge and make choc. thin lawyer. makes 8 pieses. pretty!

These were good, however,  they were too salty and I didn't even add the whole packet of ranch dressing.  I would use 1/2 to 3/4 of the ranch seasoning.  Good recipe to add extras to.

I don't know if I did something wrong but these just didn't turn out;  I ended up throwing them away.  I don't know if they didn't turn out because I used light cream cheese.  They had a wonderful presentation, but they didn't taste too good.  I may try these again and hope for a better out come.

I've rated this recipe with 2 stars because the recipe, as written, is definitely too salty as other views have also indicated.  This recipe wins points, however, with the ease and presentation.  I increased the amount of peppers and celery and also added water chestnuts hoping that this would cut down on the salt, but it was still overwhelming.  I think with some reworking of either a) the amount of ranch mix (add less), or b) the amount of cream cheese (add more), this could be a keeper.  And by the way, it's definitely not the olives that make it too salty, I didn't have that many in the wraps, and I had a few bites without olives.

I made these for a church luncheon, and they were a big hit! I doubled the recipe but used just one package of ranch mix. I used two flavors of tortillas - spinach and sun-dried tomato. I added three slices of turkey lunch meat to half  of the rolls and left the other half vegetarian. If I were to make these again for just my tastes, I would add something spicy like red pepper flakes or black pepper, and some baby spinach. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Loved the ease of this recipe. Also loved that it was easy to change into other pinwheel recipes. I added a ham layer to half of the pinwheels and it was good too.

I didn't use the olives, but otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.   Everyone at the party loved them.  The flavor was fantastic!   It's a good appetizer for people on Keto diets. Pair them with crackers and they're good for anyone.

So many people have said it's too salty.  I tried to pinpoint what it is, and to me it isn't quite that it's too salty; rather, it's too ranchy!   It's basically cream cheese wrapped in a tortilla, with a distracting strong ranch seasoning taste.  But reducing or eliminating the ranch wouldn't help because then you'd be left with cream cheese wrapped in a tortilla. Ugh.  The ranch makes it edible but doesn't quite save it.  And neither does any amount of chopped veggies.   I think this just doesn't work.  The ranch mix is not a good complement to cream cheese, and  the cream cheese is too much.  Other pinwheel recipes, including one other I tried, have sour cream mixed in and other flavorings like picante to dilute the plain cream cheese taste.

Did you ever make a recipe that has all your favorites, but were disappointed in the outcome? For me, that's what happened, something just wasn't right.  I even tried it again several months later with the same results.  However, I think I've figured out what my problem is: it's the ranch dressing!  I love ranch, but it just has no business  hanging out with Mexican stuff!  My theory  is to use taco seasoning in the cream cheese instead of ranch dressing.  I haven't tested this yet, but if, like me, you feel that there is just something a bit off in this recipe, you may want to give it a try.  And, when I do get around to tweaking it this way, I'll update my comment.

I made these for a Christmas party.  They were fairly well-received but I didn't bring home a fair few.  I followed other's advice and used the fiesta ranch and chopped olives instead of sliced.  It seemed like more spread than was necessary.  A little too much spread to tortilla ratio.  Also, I wish I had used a flavored tortilla like spinach and tomato.  That would have been pretty but my Podunk grocery store didn't have them.  Worked fairly well on a corn tortilla for my gluten-free daughter.  Nice change for her.

I made these for an outdoor high school graduation party and everyone loved them.  So delicious and full of flavor.  My only error was trying to use smaller tortillas because I had quite a few on hand from another dish.  Do not make that mistake!  Definitely use the larger, 12-inch tortillas as the recipe states and save yourself the extra work and hassle trying to make the smaller ones work.

I know, I know - this review is loosely based on the original recipe.  My point is that this recipe is very adaptable to your favorite ingredients and what you have on hand.  Love it!  Yesterday, I needed an appetizer for a party and had only a package of Italian dressing (Good Seasons) so I used that.  I had to substitute roasted red peppers for fresh.  I still used the celery and black olives, but added chopped pepperoni and mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  I rinsed and dried the roasted red peppers and diced enough to make 1/2 cup.  I also added 2 or 3 TBS bottled ranch dressing to make the cream cheese/dressing mixture easier to spread.  I'm telling you, it is a very forgiving recipe!  While not the same (obviously) as the original, the Italian version came out really well.  One tip: spread filling only half way on tortilla, it spreads and fills in the other half as you roll it.

Totally awesome and everyone always loves. I am impatient so I stick them in the freezer for 15 minutes and then slice. At that point they are cold and hard enough to slice nice rounds. I added bacon bits.

Wanted a make ahead appetizer for dinner guests instead of the regular cheese & crackers.  These were a big hit and have become my most requested take along to gatherings. Like some of the reviewers here I mixed the veggies in with the cream cheese before spreading. I also added some finely chopped salami in half of these just to mix it up a little. I will be making these this weekend for a gathering, and I think I'll try the suggestion I saw here to add spinach leaves. Instead of tortillas I used lavash bread, which is similar.  Simple, delicious, inexpensive and versatile.

We really liked them except thought that the cream cheese could be cut in half. I omitted the olives and doubled the peppers. I also added turkey. I used the red tortillas. I cut them up the night before and they were runny by the next day. Next time cut right before serving.

I cut back on the ranch and the olives to accommodate for personal preference. Was a huge hit for my daughters birthday party. Will definitely make again. The way I made it I didn't have a problem with it being salty at all.

This recipe was great! Followed recipe exactly however I added sliced turkey and ham to my wraps though.  Best advice with these wraps is to go easy on the cream cheese mixture.  A thin layer will do as once you roll them up, you don't want it to be overpowering.  They were gone before all the guests arrived! And another guest asked me to make them for her next party.

I have made these many time this last year. People rave about them and when I am going to a dinner they always request that I make these. I wouldn't change anything I think they are perfect. I don't find them too salty as some have said. This is a five star for me.

This was great!  I used half of the ranch dressing mix called for since some reviews mentioned saltiness with the full package.  (Measured 2 tablespoons from bulk package) omitted black olives and used dried minced onion because I didn't have green onions.  I also added real bacon bits.  Took these to Sunday football gathering and they were a hit.  I'll have to double the batch next time.  Sandy Creek.

I would have been able to fill more had I used less filling.  I was able to fill 8 soft shell taco tortilla with 1/3 cup of filling, but felt the filling was too much and could have used 1/4 cup of filling per tortilla.

Instead of the store bought ranch packet, I made my own w/ spices I had in the cabinet:  1/4 cup dried parsley leaf, 1 Tbs. dill leaf, 1 Tbs. garlic powder, 1 Tbs. onion powder, 1/2 tsp basil (optional), 1/2 tsp black pepper and whipped it with the cream cheese until blended well.   

I minced the olives, 2 carrots, small jar of pimentos, 2 celery stalks, 2 stalks green onion and stirred it with the cheese and cream cheese.  I layered each tortilla with a slice of ham, and used the freezer method  (freeze for about 40 min, then slice).

Just "eh".  Easy appetizer but probably wouldn't do it again.

Very good except the ranch dressing mix makes it way too salty. I would leave it out next time and substitute one package of cream cheese with hummus.

I have never been a fan of pinwheels. Too doughy and blah.  I liked these better than others and made a few additions to the recipe.  I took turkey and crumbled it up and layered it first, added both red and yello peppers diced up fine. Added the olives and onion as directed than sprinkled tony chachere seasoning all over it.  They didn't want to stick together too tight so care was needed when they were handled.  I also used the green spinache wraps and if nothing else they were a beautiful addition to my food buffet.

There are so many versions of this appetizer - I don't think of these as anything special but they do always go at the parties and there's always compliments, so it must be me!  Anyhow, I did use a variety of tortillas for "presentation", did not use the whole ranch dressing mix, used chopped spinach in place of celery, used diced olives instead of sliced and added chopped bacon.  People loved them!  Made the night before and sliced prior to the party.  You can't go wrong with these.

I made this for a games night at a friend's house and it got great reviews. I did read reviewers' comments about only using half the package of ranch mix but I completely forgot when I was making it. I did think it was too salty but no one else complained, so that was good. I didn't add the black olives because my husband and I aren't big on them. But overall, they were good.. I just have to remember to cut down on the ranch mix or double the other ingredients.

Wonderful appetizer just as the recipe reads.
I had an old reicpe where you mix cream cheese with horseradish (as much or as little as you like), spread on sliced of boiled ham, roll and cut as pinwheels.  Kind of hard to handle, so I tried placing the ham on the tortilla with the cream cheese mixture spread over that, then sliced into pinwheels, it too was very good.

Great recipe! Easy to prepare with yummy results. Did not like the look of the black olives so I omitted that ingredient. Added chopped bacon and chopped turkey deli meat. Substituted roasted red peppers for regular red pepper.

I made these for a Christmas party. I used yellow bell pepper. They were fantastic. I also made the Fiesta pinwheels from this site to go with them and they both were a hit. I like these better though and will be making them again.

These lovely pinwheels were a huge hit at my party!  Everyone kept asking me what they were, and how to make them.  This is a no-fail, simple recipe that takes no time at all.  I can't wait to try to tailor the recipe to include my favorite vegetables and meats.  Thank you Maddie's Mom!

Easy to make, just have to plan ahead for the chill time in refrigerator. Got rave comments at party & none were left on the plate. Only change I made was I used 6 - 10 tortillas and sliced them 3/4" thick because at 1" it seemed a bit big for a comfortable mouthful.

The whole ranch packet in the cream cheese made these a little on the salty side, I will probably use slightly less next time. Other then that, everyone really enjoyed this recipe and they were gone before I could blink!

These were delicious, a big hit with grown-ups.  Kids didnt care for them much unfortunately.  I would go a little lighter on the ranch dressing in the future.  Just a little too salty.

I made these for a Superbowl party and they were the first thing to disappear! Based on other reviews, I used 1/2 of a ranch mix packet and the flavour was perfect. I minced the celery as small as possible because I'm not a big fan of celery's texture but didn't want to leave out the flavour and I used an orange bell pepper, just as a taste preference. In the future I'll use diced olives instead of sliced as well. I'm terrible at rolling tortillas so I went light on the filling, otherwise I found that everything rolled right out of it. Therefore, I ended up with 6 rolls, one of which was pretty skimpy. I chilled overnight and then ate the skimpy one for breakfast, which was delightfully unhealthy and delicious! I will definitely be making these again and will double the recipe next time so that they don't run out quite so soon!

I made these for a party and they were a hit!  So easy to make - and can use almost any leftover vegetables, olives, etc. that you have in your fridge.  It's fun making up new combinations.  Thanks for making me look good when it was so easy!

These were a huge hit! However I did make a lot of changes to this recipe. I got rid of the olives and added calabrese to add a bit of zip and texture. I also did not add the ranch dressing mix and instead added garlic powder, chili flakes and dijon mustard to taste.

Made a few ingredient changes to cater to my taste, omited peppers & celery added diced cucumber & fresh shredded spinach. Used both Sun Dried Tomato & Spinach Tortillias to be festive for Red & Green (Christmas) was a big hit. Made them Christmas eve morning, put out 1/2 for Christmas Eve party & other 1/2 for Christmas Day appetizers. Not mushy at all.

These were devoured by my guests at a baby shower.  I bought a can of chopped olives and found them to be chopped too fine.  Next time I will just buy sliced olives and cut them myself.  All in all a great appetizer!

I made these for a party and everyone said they were SO tasty and were surprised they were meat free, meaning they didn't miss the meat.  I doubled the recipe but only used enough of the ranch flavoring for one recipe (so I pretty much cut it in half).  They were yummy! Will make again!  
After Note.... I made these again this year for our annual party and doubled the recipe and had none left... again! They are good, everyone enjoys them immensely.  I have made them with regular, sun-dried tomato and spinach tortillas.  I personally highly prefer them with regular flour tortillas because I don't think they interfere with the filling flavors. YUM!

Everyone LOVED these and kept talking about how Martha Stewart I was. I couldn't stop eating them as I was making them. Sooo easy and the ranch mix definitely adds the most to these and I will definitely make them again.

After finding this recipe last year, I've made it several times. Everyone loves it. I have a batch in the fridge right now waiting to be sliced. This time I mixed all of the ingredients together before spreading on the tortillas. I expect them to be great for our Independence Day celebration.

It didn't come out salty as other reviewers said... maybe they used a generic, cheap brand of ranch mix - I've tasted some of those and they don't taste nearly as good as the REAL ranch mix (made by HiddenValley, go read about the history of ranch dressing). Anyway, I started adding bit by bit, just in case it might come out salty. I didn't want to put just a little bit otherwise it would taste too much like cream cheese. Just keep adding and tasting.. the first time I made them the ranch flavor was too strong. Once you find the right balance you won't be able to stop eating them. They are always a hit and there are never any left over.

I don't know how the author thinks it takes only 10 minutes to prep.  It took me 10 minutes alone to dice the veggies... the cream cheese was difficult to blend, even in the cuisinart.  I forgot the ranch seasonings after 2 trips to grocery store, so I just used prepared dressing and it worked fine.  Added crumbled bacon to cream cheese mixture to add protein.  They were a hit at the party, but I didn't care for them.

Very good.  I only used about 3/4 of the pkg. of fiesta ranch mix.  I changed the ingredients a bit - I layered turkey, cheese slices, mustard, lettuce, and olives.  Very yummy and will definitely make again!

Lots of compliments on these. My only mistake was combining everything in the cream cheese mixture instead of layering. May not have looked as pretty but they still disapeared.

I made these for a party recently and everyone loved them. They were a little too salty (and I love salt), but I think that was due to the Hidden Valley Ranch mix that I used. Next time, I'll add a little less of that or try a different ranch mix.

These were very good and much better than the store bought kind. I made mine with reduced fat cream cheese and only 1/2 the packet of Hidden Valley Ranch Salad dressing mix. I made mine the night before. I made some with deli ham and some without. I used mission large tortillas. Next time I will try different tortilla flavors. These were well received at my son's first birthday party. Everyone loved them including the birthday boy.

Delicious and so easy! Made a whole bunch for a party and they just vanished off the plate! Really simple to change up to suit your tastes as well. Made a couple with ham, bell peppers and tomato and then a few as written. Both were delicious.

I made this for the Super Bowl, and they were GREAT! At the end of the night they were all gone. I accidentally bought 8(6 inch) tortillas, instead of the 4(12 inch) and it came out ok but I recommend using the 12 inch tortillas so the pinwheels wont fall apart after you roll them.

Great recipe. First time I made them, for party, I forgot to add the cheese but they were quite popular. The next time I made them, for Christmas with the family, I remembered the cheese... but my family thought they were too salty that way (family doesn't use much salt for health reasons).

Great!  I used yellow peppers and a buttermilk ranch packet instead.  I also mixed EVERYTHING together in the cream cheese, so much easier to spread and roll.  It filled 10 taco size tortillas. It made so many we had left overs the next day and they were still good.

I've had something similar before and was looking to try to make it for a holiday party.  These were good but lacked "something" that I couldn't put my finger on.  Maybe it was just too overwhelming of a cream cheese taste.  I followed one reviewers recommendation to cut back on the ranch dressing mix and perhaps that was a mistake.  But I also felt like the ingredients could have been more cohesive.  Will try a different recipe next time to test my theories.

These were delicious!  Made them for our Christmas Eve party, and people were grabbing them as soon as they hit the platter.  Served them with picante sauce, but were good on their own as well. I will be making these again!

Wow!!!  I made these last night for a party today.  I had to go back to the store and get more of everything because our sample session last night emptied the plate.  They were a hit with everyone young and old.  
The only change I made- I used only half a package of the ranch mix.
These came a perfectly delicious.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Everyone at my Thanksgiving Eve party loved these things.  They were so easy to make the night before.  I added cilantro and used mexican shredded cheese - complete hit.  I'm making them again for another holiday party!

I made this for a Chrsitmas Party.  I purhased the green tortillas(Spinach herb) & also wanted to purchase red (sun dried tomato) to make it festive for Christmas-but the store did not have it stock.  I purchased chopped olives as one suggested and I also added ham to give it a little more body.  It was a hit and I will surely make this again.  I have referred 4 girlfriends to this site for the recipe.

The party pinwheels were delicious.  I used light cream cheese (to lighten the calories a bit) and a mixture of different vegetables.  I know saltiness has been a concern for people, but I used the whole ranch seasoning packet and it was not salty.  Be creative with vegetables.  I don't think you could mess these up.

Excellent! I've made these countless times, my family loves them. I follow the recipe exactly, with the whole pack of ranch mix, delicious! It does take a lot of prep time and it's pretty messy to make, and I use 5 shells instead of 4. I find it easier to use the tortilla shells that are room temp at the grocery, the refrigerated ones crack when rolling. This recipe is worth the effort. I don't plate the ends so my husband gets to eat those!

This is a great recipe! I did make a few changes although I'm sure it is great the way it's written. I just knew what i had a taste for at the time! lol 
I used jalepeno cheddar tortillas, added sliced turked on top of the scattered veggies and did not use olives or cheese. I did use the whole packet of dry ranch with the cream cheese and it was great! After I made each whole tortilla, I wrapped it in foil. and then cut into 4's. This was for a tailgating event, so this made them easy to travel with in tupperware. Soooo many compliments! Even my "no vegetable" guys loved these!

I thought these were fabulous!  Dropped the olives since I don't like them and added a little sliced ham.  Everything else was very tasty.  I even made some without the veggies per my hubby's request.

These are very tasty.  I used half of the fiesta ranch packet, as advised by previous reviewers.  I also used only one block of cream cheese, and 2/3 cup of sour cream (both low fat) so that it wouldn't be so thick.  I added some yellow bell pepper and some chopped up turkey meat (cold cut variety), and they were a hit at my mom's Easter dinner.  The only problem is that the flour tortilla sticks to the foil and I also tried the press and seal wrap with the pinwheels, but they stuck to that too, which made them kind of soggy.

I made these for my cousins wedding shower. They're really pretty and everyone loved them. If you do not like black olives, just omit them. These will still be delicious!! I used the FIESTA RANCH seasoning as some other reviews said to do. This is what gives it that one of a kind flavor. These were very DELISH!!!

These were good but I did chane it a bit.  I used 1/2 pack of the fiesta ranch dressing mix as suggested.  I also used sundried tomato wraps and put sliced turkey, bacon pieces, diced cherry tomatoes, and fiesta blend cheese.  Everyone loved them and I will make these again.

I have been making these for years and they are so versatile as far as what you can put in them.  My personal favorite is to add chopped ham or turkey slices with jalapeno (canned jalapenos work great).  So tasty with a nice kick!

I made both pepperoni and cheese with italian seasoning and they were YUMMY! Gobbled up at our halloween party in no time. Also used garlic butter flavored crescent rolls. Big hit!

These were very good.  BUT, as others have said just a little too salty.  I used the fiesta ranch dip but next time I would cut the amount in half. (a whole package to me was just too salty) As I read the ingredients on the package, I could see why.  1st ingredient was salt:)It would be wise with this recipe to taste as you go.  Basically though, a very good recipe.

I made the recipe as written, but I was not the only one who thought the celery was so overpowering, that I couldn't taste much of anything else.  It looked really good, especially festive using spinach tortillas.  But if I make this again, I would either reduce the amount of celery or omit it entirely.

Good recipe.  I substituted taco seasoning for the ranch seasoning and it was very successful.  I also used the spinach wraps - the color added a festive touch.  Alot of possibilities with this recipe.

I thought that these tasted wonderful, however they didn't really move off of the plate at my recent party.  A few of my close girlfriends commented that the black olives in them made them look unappealing since they don't like black olives.  And really once I thought about it the big black specks didn't look too fabulous.  So, I will try these again but omit the black olives and maybe add in some shredded carrots, or yellow peppers for even more color.

I was brave and made these for the first time last weekend to take to a friend's party.  It was the biggest hit there and I should have doubled the recipe!!  It rates a AAA+ in my recipe box!

I made these for a church function and everyone raved about them. I couldnt find the large tortillas so I used a 10 inch. It was  hard to get them  rolled tight and make them turn out round, but even as mishapen as they were everyone raved and I belong to a church of fantastic cooks. Ill make them again for sure. You can akso add all kinds of veggies,  chopped cucumbers would be great in season.

I made these tonight and I couldn't wait to try one so after about an hour or two I took one out and cut it up for my husband and myself and it was delicious :) I'll definitly be serving these at my daughters 1st bday parties since I have been looking for great appetizers to make. I didn't use the ranch mix stuff but I bought something similar from the store that has paprika and chili in it. It's great! I also added bits of bacon and I didn't use the celery. I just don't like it much :) and I used a yellow bell pepper too along with the red one. I'll definitly be making these more often! Oh and I added cheese too and I'll be using MORE cream cheese next time too. I didn't use what the recipe says but more will be better I think. :) Thanks!

Great, easy recipe!  I have taken this several times to events, family dinners, etc. and they disappear very quickly.  After the first dinner, it was fun to watch what happens once they are discovered by the guests.  I highly recommend this one, and have been asked many times for the recipe.

I didnt like these at all. The spread waS too salty (and I used 3/4 of the envelope as mentioned) and i felt like I was just eating cream cheese. Maybe I did something wrong, but I ended up throwing them out. O well!

I left out the pepper and used green olives and added chopped fresh tomatoe and cucumbers and it was a hit.  I had a couple of people ask me for the recipe.  I had no trouble assembling the wraps at all.  I made them the day before and cut them right b/f the party.

I'm sorry, we just didn't care for these.  My husband and I both thought that the cream cheese mixture was a little overwhelming.  I would use that amount for twice as many tortillas.

Pretty good. I made this for an office party and got decent reviews. I made some as is for a veggie friend and added lunch meat (turkey, etc.) to others. The ones with meat were first to go but all ended up gone by the end of the party.

These were pretty good.  I used vidalia instead on green onions.  I had enough spread for seven roll ups though.  I ran out of the ingredients and had to start getting creative.  Thin deli sliced meats work well.  I think I will make these again.

Wow! What an awesome appetizer! Besides the chopping these were very easy to make. Make sure you roll them tightly. Awesome flavor! You can add just about anything to these and they are wonderful. I made these as is and with 3/4 of ranch dressing mix and they went over well each time. Sliced ham with the veggies went over very well over all veggie ones. Make sure you take plenty of copies of this recipe for everyone will ask you for the recipe. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I made these for a Superbowl party and got really good reviews from everyone. The host ask me where I had bought them! I did add one thin slice of ham to each one. They are easy to take to a party; just take them whole and slice them when you get there.

These are AWESOME! I took them to three different parties and they were a huge hit every time. Easy to prepare, as long as you have a good knife for chopping the veggies. ;-) Also, refrigerate the rolls overnight because it makes them much sturdier and easier to slice. Bring a few copies of the recipe with you when you make these. Trust me, your friends will ask. :-)

I liked the concept but i wasn't a fan of the toppings so i used diced tomatos, spinach, shredded cheddar, and shredded mozarella.  Wrapped nice with a good plating appearance, Thanks

I made these for a bridal shower, they tasted good and I recieved a lot of complaments. ROLL THEM VERY TIGHT! Also place extra cream cheese mixture around the outside edge so when you roll them they will stay taught. I used turkey and ham minced in the blender on low.

These are very good, and nice that you can make ahead. But like the other reviews dont use whole package of dressing, too salty.

I made these last year for a Super Bowl party --and they were a GREAT success. I will make them again this year for the Super Bowl party but change the red pepper/celery/black olives to pepperoni rolls, minced ham rolls and walnut rolls (for the vegetarians). The meat rolls go over much better than the veggie ones with the football fans!! GREAT/simple recipe!  Thanks

These were very popular, although I made half with just ham and cheese, and half with veggies...and the ham ones went much faster!  I added shredded carrots to my veggie ones, and they came out well.

I didn't use the ranch dressing mix...I used some chimi-churri salsa packets I found in the cupboard...and probably would try to add a little more flavor the next time around.

Edited to add: Have made these again, mixing the cream cheese with just chopped cilantro and some chopped serrano chile.  Even used diced tomatoes this time as part of the veggies (without the seeds), and worked well.  A new favorite!

Because of all the warnings about being salty, I started with half of the ranch packet, and then tasted that mixture.  I already thought it was too salty at that point and was kinda worried.  So I didn't add any more and continued putting them together, adding green peppers and bacon bits, minus olives.  They are awesome!  Once they're all put together, the saltiness of the direct cream cheese / ranch dressing mix is tamed.  I wouldn't put any less than a half a packet of seasoning in.

Great Recipe and Really Easy.  I substituted ham and tukey for the veggies, but it was still a hit.  Took to a party and everyone loved them.

Super easy to make and they look great on a platter.  The taste reminds me of veggie appetizer pizza rolled up.  I made my rolls the night before & wrapped in foil.  They did not get soggy at all and the flavors had a chance to meld together.  Also, watch the amount of ranch mix you add to cream cheese if you are scaling the recipe to yield more servings.  I scaled to make 75 servings and it was way to salty.  Add small amounts at a time according to taste.  Overall, the recipe is definitely a keeper.

I started making these for parties a couple of years ago and they have proven a hit amongst everyone.  The filling for me goes a lot further than just 4 tortillas, though.  You can also use low-fat cream cheese and whole wheat tortillas to not only reduce calories but reduce carbs as well.  I highly recommend this recipe to people (but not everyone), I cannot have too much competition at these parties!

This was really good and quite easy to make. Great for the weekends to nibble on. I made them for a party and now make them on Thursdays to have for the weekends. I love making these and stuff them with all kinds of things (turkey, ham, all veggies) and use different dry soups and spices etc.

This is a great recipe!  I add a thin slice of cooked ham from the deli and green onion to my rollups and omit the olives and it is fabulous.  I am often asked to make these for other people to take to parties and I am always asked to make these for my parties.  The cream cheese mixture with the celery/pepper/onion is great on a bagel with the ham. I usually pair these with the Mexican cream cheese rollups from this website for my vegitarian friends.

This was so delicious!  It made a ton of filling.  I used 4 inch tortillas because that is what I had on hand.  As far as it being salty, when I first mixed it up, I thought it was salty but after it sat in the fridge overnight and I tried it again, it was wonderful.  Definately not as salty as when I first put it together.

This was a hit at my party last night, had none left over.  I did take the advice though and only put in 3/4 of the ranch dressing.  Also, the cream cheese, I used Garden Vegetable Cream cheese and added green onions to that, we used the left over of this mix as dip for wheat thins and that was even a bigger hit...so this not only good in wraps but also as a dip!!!  Great recipe and will make it again!

Oops, I forgot to chill these, but tooth-picked them instead, so they stayed together.  It would also be easy to add lunchmeat like turkey (same shape as the tortilla).  The ranch seasoning was awesome!!

I added 3/4 of the ranch dressing mix and it turned out great.  I brought it to a party at my work and everybody commented on how pretty they looked.  My sister made these for her nine-year-old's birthday party, and they were a hit with the kids and parents alike.  I don't like olives, so I subsituted pimentos and used yellow bell pepper instead of red to add more colors.  Will make again.

I halved the recipe and added 1/3 cup of mayo to the cream cheese mixture (as per another appetizer recipe I have). I wasn't too sure about how they would taste when I was rolling them up, but they  turned out pretty good! They didn't blow me away, but they have a very nice presentation and they're fun to eat.

After reading other reviews..I cut back on the ranch dressing...I think this was a mistake...next time instead of 1/2 a pkg I think I'll try the whole pkg. It was not the hit of the party but was well recieved.

Not sure if I did something wrong but these didn't come out as well as the other reviewers did.  The cream cheese mix came out very stiff and hard to spread.  It was also very salty tasting and a bit dry.  Not a big hit at my birthday gathering.

I didn't really like the cream cheese filling combined with the tortilla but that is probably just my  particular palate.  I also used a wrap style tortilla which was probably too thin and also made it feel like I was just eating solid cream cheese.  
Glad I tried this but it wasn't really for me or any of my family members.

This is my go to for many events.  It is a great recipe to include or exclude pretty much anything. Great flexible recipe to be vegetarian or not.  Thus far, the highest compliments are when I include cheeses, olives, and something with a crunch (most often peppers).   I almost always make the day before and let them set.  Kids love them as well.  Easy to take anywhere as it can sit in a cooler without issue.

I make salt free Ranch Dressing https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/214481/dry-buttermilk-ranch-mix/ 1 ounce is 2 tbsps. I use red pepper, cucumber, carrot and celery. I blot the vegetables with paper towel to make sure they are dry. I leave out the cheese and olives. I make in the morning, not overnight so they don't get soggy. We like using spinach or salsa or whole wheat tortillas instead of plain.

Great flavor. Purchased the ingredients at the farmers market that morning, including the ranch mix. I’m always challenged with pinwheels on the cutting and having them hold together as they travel to the mouth.

good recipe, ingredients right on for 4 tortillas. I used green olives, and added mushrooms, cuke, Yellow pepper,  chopped too. could use whatever veggies you like. Make sure you drain the veggies a little after chopped. I also added salami before the dressing, and stuck it down with a little dressing. yum! Took me 20 minutes though.

Very delicious and filling!  Made these like the recipe stated, except doubled the green onion and cheese, and also replaced the olives with finely diced carrots.  Also used sundried tomato and herb tortillas and they were very yummy.  I may lighten up on the filling next time per tortilla, since they were pretty rich and filling for a small slice, when served as an appetizer.  My husband and I agreed that these would be extra yummy with turkey lunch meat inside, to have as a lunch sandwich.  Thank you for the yummy recipe!

These are inexpensive, easy to make and addicting.  Instead of black olives I used green and added some finely diced jalapeno peppers.  They were the hit of the party.  I'll definitely make them again.

I made these for a party I hosted over the weekend.  They were a tiny bit salty, but overall they were good.  I had a couple left over at the end of the night so I wouldn't say they were a hit, but I'd make them again, maybe with a little less than a full packet of the ranch dressing mix.

I made these just like the recipe called for, and I definitely should've listened to the other reviews about using only half the ranch mix packet. 1 whole packet made them very salty/ranchy. Other than that they were delicious. If I make them again I think I'll add some turkey or ham lunch meat to them as well.

Overwhelming green onion flavor ( I used the veggie cream cheese per recommendations). If you try it with veggie cream cheese, skip the green onion. Even with that change, I don't think I'll try it again as the flavor just wasn't very robust.

I tweaked the recipe a bit to include ingredients I already had in my fridge. I didn't have celery or olives so I added sliced ham to the mix. I cannot tell you how delicious they were. We had our friends come over with their two boys and there must have been about 48 pieces of these along with several other things I made. at the end of the night we had 10 left and I was asked for the recipe. Am actually making these again today for the playoff game. #GoHeat!

Decided to do less veggies in it, besides that stayed true to the recipe. Really easy to make,  they were really yummy.

I used a flavored cream cheese (garlic and herb) instead of adding ranch. It was still too creamy/fatty tasting.  Will not make again.

I made these with a couple substitutions;  I used Chipotle Ranch dressing and added red and green bell peppers.   I like the crunchy peppers and the dressing isn't as salty as the package mix.

12/19/15 Used 8 oz veggie cream cheese & 8 oz onion and garlic cream cheese. Mixed cheeses with chopped red & green pepper, celery seed, sharp white cheddar cheese and black olives. It was ok. I think it could have used more flavor, maybe additional garlic powder and/or onion mixed in with the cream cheeses.

These are amazing. They go fast any time I make them and people started requesting them for any potlucks we do for my husband and the other drill instructors. I make them using the same ingredients but add lunch meat.

Very good appetizer! I will definately be making it again- yummy!  Leave yourself some time to mix the cream cheese with the ranch dressing--- that is hard , but worth it!!

These were a big hit at my party.  Super easy to make.  Like others mentioned I only used half of the dressing mix, and used flavored tortillas.  I also used chive and onion cream cheese.  Delicious! !

I had used the 'basic' idea of this recipe to personalize my own.  That's what's sooooo great about this recipe, you can adapt just about anything and it comes out great!  We are prepping for a Christmas party in December and I wanted to try this ahead of time.  I used the 'Garden Vegatable' cream cheese, red pepper, green onion, celery, cheese, Ham, and a Jalapeno. These were really good! How ever, I'm curious to try these again with the Ranch dressing mix & fat free cream cheese and see how they compare. I'll be making these for 50-70 people! THANKS for this!

Made these for a summer pot luck lunch at work because I wanted to bring something a little different than the usual chips and dip or salsa.   I doubled the recipe, but only used 1 packet of ranch seasoning as some reviews indicated it made them too salty.   Everyone at the office LOVED them.    Everyone HAD to know who made them.   Once they found out I brought them in everyone was texting my girlfriend asking for the recipe.   Much to their surprise they were shocked to find that I actually had made them (with her help of course).  These are great for summer cook outs as an app/snacker as everyone socializes.

The only thing that I did differently is that I used the sweet mini peppers instead of the regular red bell peppers. Using the mini peppers gave it a little sweetness, in which my children likes much better.

Very impressed and they were gobbled up within 15 minutes. Felt a little bad when someone else brought their pinwheels and her plate was barely touched. Only change I made was to only add 1/2 an envelope of the ranch dressing.

These are always a hit and great to make the day before!  I took another reviewer's suggestion and added raw corn cut from the cob and that just adds a sweet crunch that is wonderful.

I have made these to take out on our party barge for several summers...I use the low carb flour tortillas, fat free cream cheese and add chopped ham and/or bacos - also sometimes I'll chop up a few pickled jalapenos and add a touch of jap juice as well!  Flavored cream cheese is another alternative I use sometimes...CAN'T go wrong with these!!

Made these for a neighborhood block party and they went pretty fast.  I used about 1/3 of the ranch dip mix packet instead of the whole thing based on previous reviews about saltiness.  For veggies I did scallion, red&orange bell peppers, cucumbers, and carrots.  I used tomato basil wraps.  I didn't love them, but other people seemed to so I guess I would make them again.  I do think they are a great party/potluck item.

Everybody loves these. I've made them many times.  I never had any problems with them being too salty.  Just be careful not to spread the cream cheese mixture too thickly on the tortillas, just do a thin layer.  Otherwise when you roll them up, they will be too gooey.   Also don't skimp on the vegetable ingredients.  Besides the flavors, you need them for texture.

I have been making these pinwheels for over 20 years.  They are always a big hit.  When you use the spinach and sun dried tomato tortillas, they look so pretty. Since I went "preservative free" in 2011, I now make my own dry Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix.  I think the recipe for this dry mix came from Todd Wilbur. If you make your own dry mix, it solves the "too salty" problem.

Made these for a party and everyone loved them. I used orange bell peppers and spicy ranch mix and they were easy and a big hit.

Very yummy!  We used spinach wraps and stacked the rolls in the form of a Christmas tree for a holiday gathering...also cut out pepper stars and stuck them into the "tree" with toothpicks.  These were well received, so yummy!  We omitted the olives and used about 6 or 7 tortillas instead of 4.

This is quick and easy. Completely missed the chill for two hours part but thirty minutes in the freezer and thirty in fridge, haha! I used fiesta ranch mix, added deli lunch meat turkey, skipped the black olives since the hubby doesn't like them. This dish made it maybe thirty minutes into the party before they were gone and rave reviews. I was the only one who went home with an empty serving dish.

Made these for a party using mainly roasted garlic and red peppers. It tasted amazing. The second time I made it, I added some spicy tuna to the cheese and it was an explosion of flavour.

I loved it with alterations, used 3 packages of cream cheese and half a package of ranch dressing mix with a single layer of turkey lunch meat. They were a hit at my daughter's party. Thank you.

Tried this for a party last weekend. People already requested the recipe & I was asked to bring it the party this weekend. I did heat the tortilla for 20 seconds before putting them together, it made it easier to roll.

I made pinwheel sandwiches for the first time for a bridal shower in January using this recipe.  I made the recipe as is and did not find them too salty as other reviewers had mentioned. (I did add an extra 1/4 of a brick of cream cheese that I wanted to use up though.) I used the red and green tortilla wraps for a pretty colorful presentation.  They were very tasty, easy to make, and gone in a flash! LOL! I have also made them for school lunches and my daughter liked them...until she realized there were black olives in them!  Next time no black olives is her only request! LOL! This mixture paired well with ham slices put in the wrap for a change too! I am sure chicken or turkey coldcuts would work too!

I have made these several times and people love them.  I do change up the veggies, based on what looks good at the store.  I also usually use flavored wraps- makes them more colorful. A couple times I have added a thin layer of sliced turkey or ham.  They are always a hit and I have had many compliments on these.  Thanks for the recipe.

Overall this recipe is okay for a foundation for pinwheels hence my 3 star rating.  I would not recommend using a packet of ranch in this recipe.  What I do recommend is that you use 3 tablespoons of Ranch dressing and 8 oz of sour cream on top of the 16oz of softened cream cheese.  

Using a ninja blender w/paddle mixer attachment makes the blending very easy and consistent in texture.  I added some garlic to give it some spice instead of peppers and the mixture tastes great.  The mixture covers 6-12" tortillas perfectly.For the flour tortillas, make sure you buy the ones that are not refrigerated, they turn out much better.

I then used chopped green onion and shredded colby jack cheese to finish off the mixture.  I highly recommend you add some cooked ham,  turkey, or roast beef to these to make them more appealing to the pallet.  You'll be very happy with the meat along with the creamy mixture.  As the recipe states, make sure you wrap them in foil or like I do, wrap them in plastic wrap and let them sit for atleast 3 hours.  The longer they sit in the fridge before serving allows the flavors to come together.

I made enough to take to a Christmas Eve party and our family Christmas dinner.  Everyone liked them.  I used the Fiesta ranch seasoning mix and left out the celery.  They tasted better the second day after they stayed in the fridge overnight.  Thanks for an easy, tasty, make ahead recipe.

Ehh...These were ok but missing something. A little lacking in flavor and zing. My hubby ate quite a few but I noticed he was dipping them in ranch dressing for some extra zip.

Ok,I give these 5 stars for absolute versatility! I've never made the "exact recipe" listed because I always seem to be preparing for a last minute event and I don't always have everything listed but I just throw stuff in a bowl and chill it. I follow the basics but always add whatever....bacon,lunch meat,green chilies,green olives,take out or keep the bell pepper,regular onions instead of green,and then add spices usually dill and garlic salt. I also just use ranch dressing instead of the packet. I've used flour and wheat tortillas of all sizes. Messy to make,but kiddos are always willing to help and I'd say definitely taste the filling and adjust to your taste.Keep the filling a little strong because the tortilla will mask the strength a little. Regardless though they are ALWAYS a hit! They get 5 huge stars from me!

I made this recipe for a birthday celebration at my job and all my coworkers love it.  So simple and inexpensive to make.  If someone asks me to bring a disk..the pinwheels we be it.  #pinwheelmomma

I skipped the celery and added banana peppers, the tartness brought this to a whole new level.

made these a couple of times and they were eaten quickly! Everyone loved 'em...agreed with the recommendations to refrigerate before cutting into them to make them easier to slice.

These pinwheels are FANTASTIC! I warn you, do not make them unless you have a full stomach. Otherwise, you'll end up eating the whole batch! :) The only thing I changed was that I used a can of diced black olives instead of sliced. Also, yes the filling is salty. But it's a treat or something special for a party, not something you're going to be making every day.

This is WAY too salty, less of the ranch packet and you'll be fine.  I wish I would have read the reviews before I had finished making these and found that other people said too salty.

This is so good, and everyone loved it! The only thing I did different was make my own pico de gallo to use instead of just tomatoes. Just make sure you drain of all liquids before adding.

I made these for the 4th of July and even though they're pretty simple people LOVED them.  I've been craving them so much, I just got the ingredients again yesterday to make these for myself.

It's good, but I think that there is too much cream cheese...it drowns the taste of the veggies.

The prep takes time, but they are quite yummy when they are done and appeal to a wide audience as well since they are vegetarian friendly.  One thing I do different - I use colby jack cheese instead of (or in addition to) the cheddar cheese.

Love these!  Super easy, but look so pretty and colorful, especially is you use red and green tortillas. I was hesitant to stray from the typical taco seasoning that is usually used in cream cheese rollups, but the ranch flavor is great!  If I need an appetizer for a party, I whip up a batch of these, and a batch of "Fiesta Pinwheels" and I always bring home an empty platter.

Quite good. The diced vegetables give both a nice crunch in the creamy mixture as well as good color for presentation.

This was the first time that I made these and they were great.  My husband (ms. picky) even loved them.  I did make a few changes.  I didn't use any onion, husband does like it.  But I did had some ham and a pepper.  I soften my cream chesse in the mico, and added the ranch pk.  Thanks so much for the recipe.....it was easy and great!!!  A keeper!

Love this recipe!!!  Got a lot of rave reviews at the Christmas party. The one thing I need to work on is my presentation. Mine weren't as pretty as some in the pictures, but I'm learning. Definitely chill these babies in the fridge first to keep them rounder when cutting. Now, if only I can get the nice, tight roll down...

I love making these for party appetizers... they're always a hit!  I went with another reviewer's suggestion and used garden vegetable cream cheese - it was perfect, and so much easier.  This is also really good with beef slices.

These were great!  Served them at a birthday party.  The platter was empty before the party was over. I did follow other's advise and only used half the package of ranch dressing mix so it wasn't too salty.  Loved this recipe and will make these again.

These are such a hit everytime I make them.  I am always asked for the recipe.  They're simple to do and made in advance, so when my guests come I can just slice them and put them out.  Another benefit is that they don't take up a lot of room in the frig.

I liked these but didn't love them.  I actually thought there was way too much of the cream cheese mixture for my taste.  I really liked the crunch of the veggies in these, though, and liked how easy they were to prepare!

Made these for a large party and they disappeared.  I made 30 servings and added 2 (1 oz) ranch dressing mix before reading reviews.  I will reduce the mix the next time as it is a bit salty.

They were ok, but not a hit at our party.  Even though I followed a few of the suggestions from other reviews I personally did not find anything spectacular about the pinwheels.  Not worth the time to make them.

These were great - super addictive!  The only thing I would do next time is cut back a little on the ranch.  I love ranch and salty foods, so I was surprised to find the whole packet made it a little too salty for me.  I think this would also make a great spread for ham or turkey roll-ups too.  Excellent recipe!

SOOOO tasty and easy!  No joke!  I was scared thinking it was almost to easy...but so good.  I ate the parts I had to cut off. ;) You'll have a lot of cream cheese left over but that's a good thing cause you can eat it with crackers the next day.  5 stars for sure!

These were a big hit!  Extremely easy to make and taste great.  The ranch mix in the cream cheese is key.  I omited the onions and just used green, red, and yellow peppers.  Delicious....will make again!

I made these for a party, and they were received well. I think the ranch flavor was a bit overpowering - next time I will use a bit less. I also will use the flavored wraps as mentioned by others instead of plain flour tortillas to distract a bit from the ranch flavor. Overall a good recipe. Thanks!

very good!  I suggest making these the night before and then cutting them into slices the next day.  It gives the shells time to soften, and they won't tear.  i also used 1/2 pack of ranch as others suggested.

I love these!  I made these for a party I was having and they were a big hit.  Just beware, they are addictive!  These will definitely make many more appearances at my house.

Easy to make and assemble.  I made these for my children's B-day party. I ended up making A LOT! and most were gone at the end of it all.  I'm sure with another flavor other than Ranch, it would be great too. (Not a big fan of Ranch)

These were great for a quick finger food. I had unexpected guests for football this past weekend and made these in a flash. Even the vegetable haters loved them! They were eaten up so quick and everyone was begging for the recipe!

You can fill these with just about anything. I used fresh spinach, cheese, ham, olives and peppers. Tasted GREAT and it was REALLY easy. The only thing that I would chage in the future is to cut down on the cream cheese. It was a bit much.

I used this recipe for the general concept. I modified it by:
Using onion soup mix, ham, and romaine for one platter and ranch dressing mix, turkey, and shredded carrots for another. People thought I picked these up from somewhere because they looked so good. Who knew you could make these at home? ;-)

These pinwheels turned out really good and everyone raved about them. The only thing I changed in this recipe is I omitted the celery and add diced jalapenos for a little heat, they came out great.

I didn't have any pkged ranch dressing so I just used Hidden Valley Ranch about 1/2c and these turned out perfectly.  For some I added a slice of smoked turkey ham.  I will make these for the next party again!!  They were such a hit as I was cutting the rolls they were being eaten!  Now that is a good recipe!!

These are perfect and easy to make!  I used diced olives from the can which saved time and made for much smaller pieces than sliced.  Also added bacon bits and cut ranch mix in half.  Can't wait to share with friends!

Good, but the ranch mix was too overpowering. I'd make these again and decrease the mix amount.

I used 6 flour tortillas instead of 4.  When I started spreading the cream cheese, it appeared to be really thick.
It was a big hit.

Tasty! Especially with the Fiesta Ranch added.  I should have used a thicker tortilla because mine wanted to tear apart and made for a messier pinwheel.  I had to freeze mine to cut them and then they were a bit soggy.

Wow!  I have been looking for a good Pinwheel recipe that didn't have olives or that I could remove the olives and it would still had some substance.  This was perfect.  My whole family raved about these!  Thanks for making me look like a great cook!

we had a bowling scotch doubles the other night and didn't just want to throw smokies in the crock pot so I found this on allrecipes and thought I'd give it a try. Glad I did. They were very very good. Let's just say I didn't bring any back home.

For how simple these really are they are very good. The chopping is a little time consuming, but if you roll these really tight and refrigerate them, they make a wonderful presentation. I tried both reg ranch and fiesta ranch and I definately liked the fiesta better. The reg ranch was a little boring, but I added ham to some and the reg ranch was much better with the ham. I can't tell which my guests liked better....Thanks for a great recipe.

I used only half a packet of Ranch omitted the olives and celery.  I added diced red, green, orange, and yellow bell peppers as well as diced cucumbers and smoked turkey. I also used about 4 different kinds of tortillas.  I made them the day before the birthday party and they were delicious and went over very well!  I'm going to scale this recipe down so hubby and I have something great to snack on throughout the weekend.

these were pretty good... definitely a novelty but not what I had been looking for in a pinwheel.  I followed the recipe exactly except for lessening the ranch and excluding black olives (because I hate them with all of my might).  Even cutting down, as others suggested, it was way too strong on the ranch and kind of gave me a stomach ache.  I will probably make these again but I will add morning star bacon and... something else to cater it to my personal tastes.

The ranch dressing mix made this WAY too salty!  It was just overpowering.  If I made this over, I would eliminate the mix.  I also doubled the olives and green onions, something I will do again if I make this recipe again.

Great taste, but somewhat messy and fell apart. I did like that I could make them ahead of time. That's handy. Will probably make again.

Great recipe!  I did as others suggested and cut back on the ranch seasoning - I used 2 tbsp - and probably could have used a bit more.  Made the rest exactly as the recipe stated and everyone gobbled them up!  Definitely a keeper!!

I doubled this recipe and used only 1 1/2 envelopes of the ranch dressing mix. The next time I think I will use only 1 envelope as it is a little salty.

My husband was sneaking the cream cheese mixture so fast I had to rush to roll them so I would have enough!

Word of caution, make sure you roll tightly. Mine are a little loose.

These were great- the first to go at a party. I should have listened to other reviewers and cut down on the ranch seasoning. They were a bit salty, but still a crowd pleaser.

Great advice cutting down on the ranch dressing mix; 2T was plenty and even a bit too salty. I used Fiesta Ranch Dip for a little extra zip. Added orange bell pepper with celery to make interesting crunch. These were gobbled up quickly!

Excellent...made these for a party last night and they went fast! I used only 2 tblspns. of the ranch mix and used red and yellow pepper, a little vidalia onion, cheese and black olives. I did make the rolls the night before and just cut them before we went to the party. Very pretty on a holiday platter and very tasty. Will make again.

fantastic!!! My only complaint is that there were none left over for me to enjoy after my party!! I did not put them all out at once, as I think they taste best cold. You should have seen how fast my last one went!

I love these appetizers.  I have taken them to many holiday gatherings and they always disappear quickly!  I use green olives instead of black and I have never used cheese (but I might next time!).  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

Excellent appetizer recipe!  My husband loves it!  I use low carb multi grain tortillas to keep the carb content down, and also only use about a tablespoon or two of the dry ranch mix.  This recipe is a must for parties!

Lot of fun. Used homemade whole wheat rotis. Didn't have dry ranch so just used some grated parmesan and mayo. Superb.

I loved the recipe. I used spinach tortillas and whole wheat to add colour to the plate. Also in some I added smoked salmon and less of the pepper and celery topping. Delicious. But I made far too much filling for 8 tortillas.

These were easy to make, and tasted very good. I loved the filling, but realized after making them that I'm not a big fan of uncooked tortillas, and wasnt sure if I missed a step and was supposed to cook them first. All of my party guests seemed to like them, I doubled the recipe, and they were gone in no time!

Very easy and very tasty.  Can use different combos if you like, but I did as is, except with less olives.  A definite keeper for appetizer parties.

These tasted very good, but they did not roll that well. I rolled them as tightly as I could and refrigerated them wrapped for 24 hours before slicing and some of them still fell apart. Otherwise a great recipe.

These were easy and yummy.  I have made them twice and they were a huge hit each time.  I have tried a couple types of wraps, including alternating sundried tomato wraps with a spinach pesto wrap for a great Christmas presentation.  Extra points because they are better made a day ahead and just sliced and put on a tray for your party.  What could be easier?  I also tried mixing up the ingredients with fontina and mozzarella cheeses, and green olives, roasted red peppers and sundried tomatoes. Very, very good.

These are excellent, but either eliminate the ranch dressing altogether or only put 1/2 the pkg in.  They turn out way too salty with a whole pkg.  I added cut up thin strips of corned beef (Budding brand) and they turned out great!  I also took out the celery, black olives and pepper (YUK.)  They were wonderful without them.  Definetly a keeper!

I don't like olives, so I leave them out and the recipe is always a hit. I use green onions, red peppers, fiesta ranch (about 3/4 packet) and the mexican seasoned shredded cheese - no olives or celery. My husband begged me to make them for a bachelor party he's going to!

These were a big hit at the party I served them at.  They were the first item to disappear and the only thing I made that didn't have any leftovers when everything was said and done.  I made the recipe as directed, but cut up my own olives rather than buying the pre-sliced ones.  Great contribution.  Thank you.

I made these for a work potluck, and didn't bring any home!  The filling made more like 8 rolls, so I needed more of the veggies to compensate, but these were so easy, I will definately keep this recipe around!

These were perfect I doubled the recipe and added ham to 1/2 of the wraps. I Did them the night before the party, then just sliced them and placed little tooth picks in them. Can't wait the make them again. Everyone ate them even the guys who claim they hate all veggies.

Made them for office party and the entire office gave me compliments.  The cream cheese mix is a little hard to spread but a little time to do so is well worth it.

These were so good!  Made them for a baby shower, and got many compliments.  Here's some words of wisdom, if you don't already have a chopper, get one!  So much easier then dicing everything the old fashion way, with a knife.

This was really good. I forgot the celery, and left out the cheese, but I think it would have been better with the celery or maybe some water chestnuts.  Overall good easy recipe!! Thanks!

Easy recipe.  Not spectacular but tasty.  Added fresh bacon bits to some of the roll ups.  Will probably make again.

I served this for at a get together w/ a bunch of Martha Stewart juniors.  They all liked them, at least they said they did.  They are very easy to make and look cute on a festive platter.
