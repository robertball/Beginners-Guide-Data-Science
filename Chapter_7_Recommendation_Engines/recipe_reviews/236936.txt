A standard in my home.  The only difference is how much I cook the cabbage and onions.  I don't cover the pan, but keep sauteeing the cabbage and onions until they are very carmelized and golden brown.  It makes it sweeter.  It takes a bit longer but the flavor is fabulous.   Try this as a side to chicken, fish, or almost any type of protein.  A great change from potatoes and healthy too.

This is exactly how we were taught to make our Haluski (we always just call it noodles and cabbage) and we LOVE it. Simple easy and cheap meal that everyone enjoys YUM!

My mother introduced me to this recipe over 40 years ago. I've made it in several variations over the subsequent years. I like to add a few coins of kielbasa occasionally and vary the pastas.

I added a very light white wine to the steaming cabbage and my family loved it! #greekslovewine

Perfection. This is how I always have made it but I add some caraway seeds during the last 10 minutes. Always a staple in our house when the weather gets cool. Serve with Keilbasa and you have an awesome meal.

This was surprisingly delicious! Its only the two of us so I halved the pasta but kept the veggies the same. Caramelized it down and added caraway seeds as suggested. SO GOOD!

Made like my grandmas. The only thing I added was browned polish sausage to the mix since hubby would not say it without a meat. Hubby loved it.

Thank you for posting this recipe.  My grandmother used to make it with potato dumplings rather than noodles.  I didnâ€™t want to make the dumplings from scratch so I bought them frozen from a Polish deli.  They were rather large so I cut them in half.  I also decided to add a few pieces of kielbasa because someone in the comments suggested it.  After putting it all together I got to feel like my grandma was here with me again.  Thanks!

This was the first time I made this. It was delicious. I love onions so I used 3 medium size. On my serving is out some franks hot sauce. Perfect. Such a simple and delicious recipe. Thank you.
