These are so cute and so easy to make.  It is not too time consuming.  I put the filling and the whipped cream in a baggie and cut the corner.  It made it SO much easier to deal with and made them look fairly close to the picture on the box of the Nilla wafers.  The kids love them.  They're a huge hit.

Very cute.  I put the cool whip in a bag with the tip cut off for the topping.  Wish I had done it with the filling!

These were just kinda bland to me. Followed the recipe except for the sprinkles and licorice. I will experiment with different flavored pudding. I think it'd be better with a banana cream or chocolate.

I made this for a pot luck and everyone enjoyed them.  I did not bother with the licorice step.  They are a little messy to make/eat but yummy.  The recipe states it yields 14 servings but I got a lot more out of that because it makes a ton of filling.  I would definitely suggest this as a simple yet fun summer pot luck addition.

I made these for a BBQ I attended yesterday and they turned out great! After I filled the cookies, I rolled the sides in red and white sprinkles as well as putting the red, white and blue sprinkles on top.  I found it easier to attach the licorice by first cutting it up and freezing the pieces so that they were stiff.  I put the cool whip and sprinkles on top of the assembled cookies and then placed them back in the freezer for about ten minutes (to also stiffen the cool whip).  I took them out and attached the licorice and kept them in the freezer until I brought them to the party.  All the kids and adults loved them.

Sooooo yummy! Like little cheesecake bites...I say little because I accidentally bought "mini" nilla wafers, LOL! Warning: if using mini nilla wafers, prepare for tons of little cookie bites :-) However, these mini firecrackers are the cutest things I've seen in a while!

I made these this past weekend for a 4th of July bbq & everyone loved them! The only thing I did different was put the cool whip in a ziploc baggie & cut the tip off and frosted the top cookie that way. It made it look prettier. Next time i might do that with the filling as well.

These were wonderful. Kids and adults alike loved them at our 4th of July party. Large Ziploc bags with the corner cut off kept the filling mess to a minimum.  Only change was the topping. I added blue food coloring to the cool whip, used red sprinkles (left over from Christmas), and didn't do the licorice. Wonderful, simple, and a hit!!

These were absolutely fantastic! They were super simile to mix together and were super yummy. The only problem was assembly as they didn't hold up through the entire assembly time. Next time I will maybe refridgerate before putting the top cookie ti firm it up some because it slid off the slide otherwise. Messy but great taste made up for it.

I give these 5 stars because they're cute, fun and easy to make. The kids loved them as did the adults. You can have them anytime of year. Also, I found that I preferred to let them "set" in the freezer for a while so it was a tasty frozen treat!

Before I made this, I was almost deterred by the negative comments about this being bland.  I am glad I went ahead with it anyway!  It was great!  If you enjoy plain cheesecake, you will like this!  The only thing that I did differently is leave off the liquorice.

This recipe was great.  Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe.  I gave them all your site.  It made exactly how many it said to make.  I also put the cool whip on top and the licorice and put them back in the freezer till serving time.  Next time I make them I think I may try banana pudding.

I made these for a family 4th of July party this past weekend and they were a complete hit! I followed the recipe exactly, except I couldn't find 1in vanilla wafers at the store so I used the little ones which ended up being perfect for bite size bits of goodness and they looked super cute! Thanks for sharing!

Easy, cheap, make a lot for a crowd.  Definitely use a pastry bag, I did for both the inside and top.  I also didn't want to leave my bbq to put cool whip on the top, so I left off the licorice, put cool whip on the top, shook the sprinkles on top and froze all of them on a cookie sheet.  Came out great!

It's hot here in the south, and these wouldn't stay together unless they were totally frozen, whipped topping and all. Too much trouble (and I even used a pastry bag) for something that tastes good but "average". I would suggest making an alternate version of like Pumpkin Fluff and putting cookies on the side.
