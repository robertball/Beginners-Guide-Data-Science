I have made this a few times. I did get it from another site. It is very very good and easy to make a sugar free version. I made this for my 1 year olds first birthday. I used a sugar free angel food cake and sugar free pudding. The difference in sugar content for sugar free and regular whipped topping is not that much. I just used the low fat variety. I also upped the almond extract because you really can not taste it. We like that flavor so I doubled that amount.

Amazing! Also, easy to make low sugar or sugar free, which is a must for me. I just use sugar free or low sugar angelfood cake, sugarfree pudding and whipped cream, and no sugar added berries.

this was awesome, made it for dessert at Easter. Family loved it! Did double the almond as someone suggested and it was a big hit. Will make again.
