This was great! When the sausage was almost done, I added in 6 eggs to scramble with it. I also added in salsa to the mixture and added the sharp cheddar to the whole mixture instead of sprinkling it. My son especially kept telling me how awesome it was. Very easy to make! :)

I wanted to use this recipe as a breakfast dish, so I substituted the cream cheese for scrambled eggs.  After I drained off the grease from the sausage, I mixed 6 eggs with 1/4 c. milk and poured into the cooked sausage in the pan; stirred to cook to a soft egg stage, and then poured it over the bottom crust in the pan.  Topped with cheese and the other crescent dough, it turned out wonderful!

Delicious! I loved it, I tried to make a mummy instead of sandwiches and didnt do the best job, but it was by far the favorite dish of the day!

Winner, Winner in my house!  This is a lot like sausage puffs with the additional cheese.  This is  a good appetizer (as recipe is written) but it looks like the breakfast crowd is critiquing it as a breakfast.  It can be both but critique it as an appetizer.  If you try this as a breakfast offering, put your scrambled eggs on the side or you might have soggy crescent rolls and judge it unfairly.

I didn't love the recipe as written, but my husband and kids did.  Next time, I'll add eggs to it and make more of a breakfast casserole. It just seemed like it needed to be more quiche-like for some odd reason.  This was very simple to assemble, and would be great for people who don't have time to cook or consider themselves not to be good cooks.  I think it would go over well at pot lucks and brunches.

I carried this dish to a Pastor Appreciation Brunch. I believe the staff must have felt appreciated since it was all eaten :)

Easy to make and delicious as is, for appetizers.  I have also doubled the cream cheese and sausage only and made this into a breakfast casserole "bar".

This was wonderful! I made this for my office and you talk about a hit!  I took other's suggestion to add eggs when the sausage was almost done and cooked the bottom cresent layer for about 10 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. I used hot Italian turkey sausage removed from the casings to add a bit more spice.  I also cooked some onion, green pepper and mushrooms to add over the sausage/egg mixture.  I layered the sausage/eggs, veggies and cheese. Then topped with the final crescent sheet. I've been "ordered" by my coworkers that I must bring this breakfast at least once a week!

I think I'll add scrambled eggs and sauteed onions to the mixture next time. Then it will be perfect!

We've made this several times for breakfast. We typically use maple flavored sausage and add in and scramble 4 to 6 eggs when the sausage is almost done. For the two of us, this makes a quick, easy to reheat breakfast for a few days.

Good but not as flaky as I thought. Next time I think I will try it with puff pasty instead. I also added scrambled eggs. It was good.

These were the hit of the party. The only change was taken from other reviews, I baked the first layer of dough for 10 minutes before adding the sausage mixture.  I used the spicy sausage.

This was very tasty.  I think it can be lightened up using lower fat cheese, cream cheese and turkey sausage.  I will definitely make this again.  My friends and family really liked this.

Overall, I felt that the sausage and cheese combination was too salty and the leftovers did not taste good the next day (after being microwaved).
