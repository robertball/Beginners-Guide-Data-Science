I thought these were just O.K. I felt that there were too many spices going on here. Pumpkin spice has most of the other spices listed already in it. I didn't use any oil but bumped up the applesauce. Used buttermilk in lieu of milk, fresh strawberries rather than jam, honey instead of sugar and subbed oats for the buckwheat. Because I had an over ripe banana lying around, I threw that in too. These were a little dry but being that a good friend of mine was in the hospital last week with a severe case of diverticulitis, I'm trying very hard to get in my 25 grams of daily fiber. I'm not a huge breakfast lover anyway, so for now these will do, but my next attempt at making these will require a few changes. Thanks for a good start!

These were pretty good....I did add raisins and slivered almonds to add more taste.  I didn't use any oil just increased the applesauce.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

For what they are, these muffins really aren't so bad. They're low calorie, healthy muffins that really only need a little bit of jam or butter to make them quite tasty. I had to substitute soft tofu for the yogurt and shredded wheat for the bran flakes as I didn't have either on hand. I let the cereal soak in the milk mixture instead of turning it into a flour, but the results still tasted decent. I got 18 muffins plus a tiny loaf out of this recipe, and the batter is thick, so if you want pretty tops you'll have to smooth them before baking as they don't change at all once in the oven.

I had to make a couple of changes to this reciepe because I didn't have everything on hand. I substituted the applesauce for apple butter, yogurt for lowfat cottage cheese, strawberry jam for peach, and the biggest change was, I used 1 1/4 cups white flour for the crushed bran flakes. These muffins turned out very tasty indeed! They're a little dry, which is why I gave it 4 stars, but for a healthy, high fiber, delicous muffin, this is one of the best I've tasted!! Thanks Robert!
