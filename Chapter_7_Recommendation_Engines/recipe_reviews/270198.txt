This is a great idea.  We eat lots of hummus at our house, and try to eat healthy.  To begin with I made this as written.  I realize that often hummus has to sit awhile in the refrigerator  for flavors to maximize, and I didn't do that initially.  Right after mixing, I felt it needed more sweetener and more chocolate.  Thus a 3* rating.  After adding a few more Tablespoons of sweetener and another heaping Tablespoon of cocoa I would bump it up to a 4.  My husband really liked it!  So it is a good basic recipe you may want to play with the ingredients.

YUM!  I didnâ€™t have tahini so decided to use cashew butter instead. It came out creamy and delicious. Thank you for the fun and inspiring recipe.
