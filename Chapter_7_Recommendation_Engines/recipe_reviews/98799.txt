This dish was really sweet and I only used 2/3 of the sugar. I also served it with Bobotie which was also quite sweet so the combination was overpowering.
Maybe it should have been 3 teaspoons instead of 3 tablespoons. Otherwise it was quite good with a lovely aroma.

Super Delicious!  So glad I tried this recipe!  I used Sucanat instead of sugar, in the same qty listed. I also used some vegetable broth for some of the water and added a handful of cashew nuts.  Yum! This will be on our table again!

I made this with a north African chicken dish, and it was good. After reading some other reviewers' comments that they found it somewhat sweet, I made 1 serving ahead of time, and based on that, decided to use only about a quarter of the amount of sugar called for. I also soaked the raisins for about an hour to plump them up a bit. Served the meal with a South African white wine.

I must admit I was a bit nervous about the raisins in rice but it was so delicious. I used brown sugar in place of white sugar and served it with African Curry Chicken. My kids thought it looked gross but was pleasantly surprised and couldn't get enough of it. EXCELLENT!

This was very good.  My only complaint is that I don't think the turmeric dissolved well and some bites were a bit chalky.  This might of been my fault, since I like my rice dry and only used 1.75 cups of water.  It might of dissolved better in more water as the original recipe called for.  Next time I will stir the spices in the water vigorously before adding the rice.  My other changes was that I used only one tablespoon of sugar.  Combined with the raisins, it gave the dish a hint of sweetness without being overally sugary.

I recently attended a dinner party at a colleague's house. He is from South Africa and made this dish and was excellent. Compared to his version, this was a bit sweeter, but pretty close. It was great mixed with the Bobotie from this site, as well. I did sub craisins, as I don't like  raisins.

This was a cool rice recipe, definitely different than the usual side of rice ;)  I followed other reviewers' tips and cut the sugar in half.  Thanks!

A good side dish to bobotie.  It is pretty sweet, so depending on who you're cooking for I would adjust the sugar.  I've made it both ways (sugar as written & sugar decreased) and it's delicious.  It's not an amazing-wow dish, but it's a nice compliment to bobtie.  I also made a cumin-date sauce to go with it.  So all and all, a pretty good geelrys recipe.

I enjoyed this recipe. It was very easy to cook. I used Splenda and reduced the sugar. With the raisins it was more than sweet enough. Very good, thanks for sharing.

This was really good. I had a package of yellow rice and I wanted to try something new. I of course omitted the salt and turmeric because my packaged yellow rice already had spices in it. I made the yellow rice according to the package and tossed in the raisins, cinnamon, and sugar. I took the suggestion of others and only used 1 tablespoon of the sugar and it wasn’t too sweet to me at all.

My fiancee and I did not care for this rice.  I cut the sugar like suggested and sweetness was okay, what I did not like was the cinnamon flavor it was overpowering.  My fiancee states "it was okay, but who wants to settle for okay."

I made this with brown rice. I used 3 1/4 cups of water and lengthened cooking time to nearly an hour. It was excellent! My son had three helpings.

I was skeptical but being we were celebrating Fluorescent Yellow Food Day and I dislike most yellow foods like bananas and eggs I went ahead and tried it. My family really enjoyed this rice. Since my guy will not eat raisens, I soaked them in hot water seperately and stirred them into individual portions on our plates. We made mustard wings for more yellow food and had yellow cake for dessert. It was a lot of fun.

This would be better if you cut down on the sugar, it was much sweeter than I thought it would be.  It has a good flavor though and is a good base for grilled chicken.

We had this with some 'South African Boerwors' from Uli's at Pike Place Market. I thought it went well with the sausage, but was still a little too sweet. I'll definitely try this again, but will cut the sugar drastically. Thanks for the idea.

My husband is South African and had high hopes for this dish. Unfortunately, it ended up being just OK. With both sugar adn raisins, this ended up being way too sweet. I will try another recipe next time.

I thought this recipe was very good. I was a little skeptical as I don't usually care for sweet rice, but I was pleasantly surprised. I took it to a potluck African celebration. The bowl was empty at the end of the program. Always a good sign. :-)

This was good, but very sweet. . . more like a dessert, almost.  If I make it again, I will reduce the white sugar significantly.

This is really good, but it is too sweet. I'm going to try it again, but next time with less sugar because it was too sweet. Maybe with brown sugar? Half brown, half white? I served it with spicy beans and that helped to balance it.

Followed the recipe exactly the first time. Second time cut down the sugar by half, and used maple syrup instead. So throughly enjoy this flavour packed rice.

Used this for the continent program that my grandson had in kindergarten.  It is delicious !!  Could go with any dish.  We like it for a dessert.

Our family and friends enjoy this one. If you substitute coconut oil for the butter, you have a gluten free, dairy free, vegan dish great for pot lucks.

Served as a side with bobotie. Too sweet as written, but cutting the sugar to about a third of what's written would bring this to 4 stars.

Yum! Used 3 tsp of sugar because 3 tblesp seemed like a lot and it was delicious. Next time I may use even less sugar and a bit more salt but will definitely make this again. Served with bobotie

We all love this with babotie, also made from this site. My kids can't get enough of this rice...I never make dessert if we have this, just more rice! My South African friends like this one too ;-)

This dish is fairly easy to make and provides a unique flavor. It also has a very good presentation  (yellow/orange rice, the cinnamon mixed in, and the raisins) - yummy!

I was so surprised with how awesome this rice dish is!! It's like a savory rice pudding...the perfect side to any chicken dish, but also GREAT alone.  A++++ and I'll be making this again.

Way too sweet. There was just a little too much of everything really. If I were to try it again (which is doubtful), I would skip the sugar and omit (or at least seriously decrease) the cinnamon. My husband and I each had a small portion. It tasted like dessert. I might like it better with ice cream...really.

Like many said the sugar can use a tone-down, but the basic recipe is very good and the color of the rice adds an additional interest to your entire menu.  I liked the flavor, sort of tropical, good with entrees that have a fruit component, or if you wanted that contrast.

This is a wonderful rice. Everyone in my family enjoyed it.  A great alternative to mundane, plain rice.
