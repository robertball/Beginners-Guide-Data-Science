Very good and easy. Next time I think I will use raspberry preserves instead of the frozen raspberries for a stronger raspberry flavor.

I used 1 cup (seedless) raspberry jam -- and this was THE best salmon I've ever had.  My family couldn't get enough -- including 6 year old and 8 year old!

Delicious! Perfect healthy comfort meal! 
I "cleaned" this recipe up a bit by reducing the amount of sugar...substituting organic turbinado and a squeeze of honey.  I also added a pinch of smoked chipotle/paprika seasoning just to give it a smokey kick.  We grilled the salmon instead of baking.  We served it over a bed of mashed cauliflower....yummy healthy comfort food!

Very good.  Also very easy.  I did need a bite or two to fully appreciate the raspberry/salmon flavor combination.  As a slight modification, I removed the ginger slices but left at least half of the remaining solids in the sauce.  I really enjoy the textural experience of raspberry seeds.  My wife and I are looking forward to preparing it again.  

And yes, it's a great entree to prepare for a date; even if you're already married to the person :)

We live to fish for salmon on Lake Superior.I am always looking for new ways to cook this great fish. This recipe is not bad but, I would use less sugar. I would try it again in the future.

Husband said it was a good dish and a nice change from the usual fish flavor.  The sauce didn't thicken as much for me as I had hoped.  I don't think the fish needs the last bit of lemon zest.  I think next time I will use more ginger and less lemon to get a really deep lemon flavor.  You don't need sweetened raspberries either.  I also left some of the raspberry seeds in for some texture.

we really enjoyed this!  I did not discard solids, next time I'll discard some, but not all, like that texture.  I didn't have a lot of time, so I used ginger spice rather than the fresh ginger.  Will be making this again.
