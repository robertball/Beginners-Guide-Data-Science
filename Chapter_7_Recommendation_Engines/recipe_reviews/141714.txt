Overall this is tasty and received good reviews from the family, but next time would cut the soy sauce in half (it is very salty otherwise) and add some greens - bok choy, green beans - to make this a one-pot meal.

Imade this last night.  I cut back slightly on the flakes and the paste since it was the first time.  I added more when it was done. It was very good.  My kids, 5 and 9 and hubby loved it.  Made with sushi rice. MMMMMmmm!

I basically browned up the chicken a bit then dumped everything else in.  Used baby carrots. No salt.   1/4 cup Korean soy with kelp. Probably more than a cup of water because it thickened up and needed it.  Kimchi on the side.  It's like a stew/chili.  Delicious!

This was delicious! I've never had this dish before so I don't know how authentic it was but I really loved it.  I only used 1Tbsp crushed red pepper and I didn't have gochujang, so I used 2 Tbsp Thai Chili Garlic Paste.  I was glad I cut the heat a little, it still had plenty of kick! I served it with rice but it would have been great without it.  Delicious...will definitely make again.

The smell and taste of this and instantly brought back feelings from my childhood.  I can't explain it but it envoked so much emotion to me.  What is even more odd is my mother never made this dish. Thank you for such a food experience.  As to note the actual recipe.  I made this exact with all the ingedients.  Next time I will scale back to 2 tablespoons pepper paste and 1/2 teaspoon rep pepper flake.  Also please try to go buy the gochujang.  It is what makes the dish just right, gives it a nice depth with a little heat and it's own kind of slight sweet note.  You will not find the same flavor in other sauces.  You can pick up a small jar at a Korean market for around three dollars.  Just make sure it is a deep red and it will look like tooth paste.

Very good, quick and simple meal that I will make again.  As the description stated, this one is very spicy.  I cut back a little on the crushed red pepper flakes, and I did not have the Korean hot pepper paste but used the hunan red chili sauce that I had instead.  Also, I knew I would want sticky rice with this dish (in my opinion you must eat this with rice) so I omitted the potatoes and threw in some celery.  I just didn't see us eating potatoes and rice.  Very good.

Fantastic recipe! The only thing I did was different was with the paste. Couldn't find the Korean paste so bought the Sriachi brand chili paste. I liked this paste because instead of sugar being the 1st ingredient, chili peppers are. It made for a spicy, delicious dish. I was afraid the veggies wouldn't be tender and it looked like surely more liquid would be needed, but that's not the case! Just cover and it will be perfection when it's done. I can't rave enough about this dish.

This was pretty good.  I cut back slightly on the red pepper and the paste, but would probably follow the recommended amounts next time.  I did add a little more water and some red and yellow bell pepper.  I also used low sodium soy sauce and didn't add any additional salt.  Good reviews from my dinner companions!

Prepared as directed and it was great!  *Very* spicy.  My wife and I loved it that way, the kids devoured it but said it was a bit too spicy.  No leftovers.

The second time we prepared it we prepared two batches.  The first was prepared exactly as before.  Yum!  The second was prepared in the same pan as the first but without adding *any* crushed red pepper. Any pepper was left from the first batch.  Much milder for the kiddos.  The only leftovers were barely enough for lunch the next day.  A definite keeper!

Made a few modifications - couldn't find Korean paste so i replaced it with tomato paste and Worcestershire sauce and added some red bell peppers. Was quite a hit.

This was hot hot hot.  I like spicy food, and my mouth was on fire! Still liked it though. The left overs were less spicy, and actually tasted better after a day or two in the fridge.

I make this for my husband who is a bit spice averse and he loves it and yes it is an authentic dish! To help cut the spice I add about a tablespoon of honey and always serve it with white rice. You can also cut back on the gochujang and really don't need the red pepper flakes. Keeping the potato really helps cut some spice too. I've never done this in the slow cooker so I look forward to trying it.

My husband said this was the best thing that I've made for him in the 13 years we've been married :) I did make the following changes, however: I had a whole roaster chicken, which I cut up and used for this recipe the wings, thighs, drumsticks and a few small pieces of breast (I used the whole breast for a different, non spicy recipe). I left the chicken pieces on the bone and trimmed the skin on them and then browned in batches in 1tbsp of canola oil. I removed the chicken and added the vegetables to the pan to soften, switching out the potatoes for 3 stalks of celery since I planned to serve this over rice. When the vegetables were soft I added Srirarcha (didn't have the gochujang but would like to try in the future) and the chili pepper flakes and stirred for a minute. I added the water and soy sauce then nestles the chicken pieces in the vegetables, covered and simmered for about 25 minutes, turning occasionally. I didn't add salt since I was using regular soy sauce. definitely a keeper, and am sure my hubby will insist I make it again. Will try the gochujang at some point too. As a note, my husband is from Nigeria and likes spicy food, usually adding hot sauce to everything and he didn't have to the way I made this, so note if you like spicy or want to reduce the heat :)

Delicious and so easy! Unfortunately, I didn't have any gochujang so had to use sriracha and added a little sugar. It was still fantastic, but I'll have to pick up some gochujang and try again and experience it as it should be.

Simple, fast, tasty, spicy - sold.  It will become a staple.  One of the better things I've done with chicken breast.

Really enjoyed this recipe--changed the cooking methods a little; I pan-fried the chicken until crisp and golden, then added the soy sauce and let it cook through.  The veggies I did separately (omitting the onion) in a fry-pan; I cooked them with the seasonings in a little bit of water until they were soft and cooked through.  I like to use Rocoto chile paste (available in Mexican food stores); it is really spicy, but doesn't overpower the other flavors in the meal.  Thanks!!  We will definitely make this again.

The taste was good, but I didn't like the texture the potatoes brought to the dish. Like others I cut back on the heat and the next time I will make it without potatoes.

I thought this was fantastic but my husband found it too spicy even though I omitted the hot sauce.  Too much crushed red pepper for him. I had to make him some bacon and eggs.  I'll make it again, cutting the red pepper down and just add hot chili paste to mine when served.
