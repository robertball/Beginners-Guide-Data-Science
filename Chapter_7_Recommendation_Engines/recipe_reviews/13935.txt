It's hard to give five stars to a side dish.  Why?  Well, because it's a side dish--not the main event.  No so with this one.  Truly great side dishes seem rare.  I will absolutely remember this one as long as I'm able to cook.  I served it with Spinach Enchiladas, available at allrecipes, but it is so versatile that it would work with so many dishes.  I used a full can of veggie broth and the rice could still have been a little more moist.  Don't be afraid to use the jalapeno pepper.  Amazingly, with the pepper, chili powder (I used Mexian chili powder) and cumin, this recipe only offers a little zip.  It's not spicy HOT, like one might expect.  There are so many elements that make this recipe great but the cheese really makes it pop.  Don't leave it out.  It provides just the right finishing touch.  My somewhat picky adult son said this one was amazing!  Victory!

I made this recipe as a side dish to go with fajitas, and it worked really well. I added about 1/3 of a cup of salsa to it and to cut the fat content I did not use the cheese. The rice came out  very moist and delicious.  I also used white rice instead of brown because it was all I had in the house, and it still came out great. Great recipe, thank you!!

Loved it!  I used slow cooking brown rice, 1 can of Mexican tomatoes, and placed browned boneless, skinless chicken thighs on top of the rice for the last 20 minutes of cooking, then just sprinkled the cheese on top to melt.  I also added 1 cup frozen corn to the mix and it was really terrific!  A great meal.

This was okay eating.  I used chicken broth (which MAY have altered the receipe too much) but no matter which broth you use, it seems to need just a little more (perhaps an extra 1/4 cup?).  Some of my rice was slightly undercooked.  Also, with the amount of rice vs the red peppers and tomatoes required, it just seemed too much...and we LOVE red peppers and tomatoes, possibly lessen one ingrediant or omit one altogether?  Since I have found better rice side dishes, I probally won't make this one again.

Just okay in my book. I was cleaning out the pantry so tossed in some corn and cilantro, and used a can of Rotel tomatoes in place of the tomato and jalapeno. Despite the additions it was still missing something. I cooked it in my rice cooker - just threw in everything except the cheese and let it go. Couldn't be simpler, I'll give it that.

I used chicken broth rather than vegetable broth, and regular basmati rice, vs instant rice (3/4c rice for a 1:2 ratio of rice to liquid).  Simmered with the broth and other listed ingredients until cooked through (maybe 15-20mins?).  This was good and is serving as a side dish tonight to our leftover Southwestern Egg Rolls from this website.  Thanks for the recipe, Alison!

Make this recipe just for the aromas that will spread through your home.  It tastes great too!  I made a few adjustments as recommended by others: jasmine rice, 3c chicken broth, 1/4 cup salsa, juice from jalapeno jar and a sharp white cheddar).  The cheese gives this dish the creaminess that seems to be missing in other recipes.  Top of with some fresh parmesan and you've got yourself a delicious side dish to your entree (we had salmon).  Enjoy and Thanks!

This was good...I made a few modifications -- no diced red pepper or cheese and used 1 cup tomato sauce, 3 cups beef broth, and 1-1/2 cups regular white rice.  I'm a REALLY bad rice maker...my husband thought for sure this was a packaged mix because it was good and he knows I can't make rice!!!

This is an excellent dish!  Recieved RAVE reviews from the pickiest of eaters!  I did use 1 whole can of vegetable broth and I think it needed the extra liquid.  Also used almost double the cheese and it was excellent!  SUPURB!

Following the recipe as written, this was just edible.  I should have known better than to use instant brown rice -- the end result was a bit gummy, yet some rice was still undercooked (perhaps more broth??).  The spice/heat level was ok, but I probably won't make this again.  Thanks anyway.

I chose this rice dish to accompany a Chicken Monterey Recipe.  It was truly wonderful and not that difficult to prepare.  I omitted the jalapeno pepper and it still tasted very authentic with the mexican spices.

Made this to go with Zucchini Tomato Mélange.  Super!  Now I’m off to write a custom version to combine the two!  For the rice,  I like to use a brown/wild rice blend that takes 45 minutes to cook, so I had to modify the cooking methods for this recipe.  I sautéed the onion, added the garlic and red bell pepper, sprinkled the spices over, sautéed for a few more minutes, and then added the cooked rice.  When heated thru, added the tomato.  Did not use cheese (forgot) or jalapeno (wimp).  Thought about adding a can of (mild) Rotel…might try that next time.

Just made this, and it was great!  I only use brown rice, not white and this was the only recipe for the brown rice that I could find.  Only thing was I left out the jalapenos.  I will make this every time we have Tex-Mex in my house.  Perfect!!

I thought this was so tasty. I did change things a little.  I only had medium brown rice so I cooked it in the steamer like I normally do.  I sauteed the onion, garlic and red bell pepper together with the seaonings.  Then I threw in the diced jalapenos, rice and a can of diced tomatoes.  I forgot to add the cheese but I thought it was delicious the way it came out.  A little spicier than I would have liked but next time I will either leave out the jalapenos or use less chili powder.  I definitely will be making this again.

I made rice in a rice cooker; if you do this skip the excessive water/veggie broth as it will make the rice too moist. It is very spicy if you add a can of jalapenos, over all WAY better than restaurant Mexican Rice which I never order/eat.

Not spectacular but a decent way to jazz up brown rice. Used regular brown rice, so I increased the liquid and cooked longer.  The recipe makes -way- more than 2 servings, makes more like 6 servings.  I halved the recipe and after my BF and I had it last night there is at least a serving left over.  Definitely use the cheese. The recipe needs a healthy amount of salt and pepper as well.  Even with all those spices it was pretty bland. I'll probably not make it again.

This was a delicious side dish. It had the right amount of flavour but was not too spicy. The recipe made quite a lot but it didn't matter because my guests just kept on eating it! Thank you for submitting this recipe. It is one of my favourites.

I make this recipe once a week and serve it with something else for dinner (eg quiche, vegetable kebabs, stuffed capsicums etc). I like to use brown rice instead of white as it is so much healthier and this is the only recipe I have come accross that makes brown rice tasty! I think the grated cheese is the secret. My husband loves it too and doesnt dread any more when I say we are having brown rice tonight!

Used regular (not quick-cook) brown rice (cooked in twice as much veggie broth as rice.)  Did not have chili powder so used 1 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp. paprika.  Also added mushrooms and a can of beans and used 2 tomatoes.  Used shredded gouda cheese. Otherwise made as stated. It is good stuff!

I thought this was just ok, nothing special.  I made it as a side dish to go with enchiladas.  I followed the recipe exactly as its written and I thought that this dish was bland (and I'm not a big fan of spicy foods).  I had to add a little bit of taco sauce to give it some flavor.  I also think the cheese was a bit too much, I should have left it out, it didn't add much flavor but it did add a lot more calories.  I probably won't make this again.

Simple and easy mexican rice.  The cheese adds a nice stickiness.  Definitely use more broth than the recipe tells you too. I just eyed it added 1/4 cup more every time it was too dry.

This was really good!I didnt broth (which i realized after i started cooking), nor did i have jalapenos. i figured i'd just double the chile pepper. i added butter, peas, and more garlic, but this recipe needs waaaaaaay WAY more garlic. to eat it i sprinkled on some cheese and squeezed on some lime and it was perfect!!

Great!  I did use Rotel tomatoes and no red pepper, because I didn't have one.  I forgot to add the cheese and the rice was wonderful without it.

This is one of my favorite recipes ever.  We double it, and use pepperjack cheese instead.  Also, in a pinch, we've used a box of Uncle Bens rice pilaf and just discarded the spice packet.

Delicious and great!! I needed to cook the rice longer and needed more chicken broth. I also added more spices (cayenne) since I like spicy foods.

I'm rating this a 5 because it gave me a really good base for a one pot meal that was fresh, fast and good!
I added 1 pound of ground beef, beef broth and used fresh peppers and tomatoes from our spilling over the top garden. Jalopenos, chili peppers and a bell pepper and 3 tomatos instead of one. We even ate ours in warm flour tortillas with cheese and salsa! Very good! Thanks!

No cumin, a can of rotel instead of the tomato and pepper, no cheese, and 2 cups of chicken broth are the only changes i made in this recipe. It turned out really well, and pretty healthy too! Everyone who thought it was gummy probably didn't add enough liquid while the rice is cooking--brown rice is different than white rice, folks!!

This is a wonderful rice dish, we raelly love it. I make it often. It is also good when you have leftover roast, to chop it up and add it to the recipe for a one dish meal.Thank you so much Alison for sharing you great recipe.

This was delicious!  I used 1/2 the jalapeno pepper, and it had just the right zing for me.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious! I used regular brown rice (not the instant kind) and sauteed it with the onion and garlic to give it a nuttier quality. The cheese adds a delicious creaminess and bite to this perfect Mexican rice. Excellent!!!!

I loved the fact that this used brown rice because I love it.  I added a whole can of vege broth and had no problem with undercooked rice.  I also added cilantro, because I love it and I wanted a little more color in the dish.  Thanks for the tasty side Alison.

very good, I used regular brown rice and left out the jalapeno.  (just too spicy for my crew)  I cooked the onion and garlic 1st, then added the spices, chicken broth, rice and a can of diced tomatoes and baked it covered at 350 for about a hour and a half.  Served and then sprinkled with cheese.  I will make this again.

This recipe is awesome!  I used one can of stewed tomatos mexican recipe instead of the spices cumin, chili powder, and the jalepeno.  It has those things already and cut down on the time I had to spend (and the chances of rubbing jalepeno juice in my eyes!).  Great for kids because of mild taste but if you want more heat you can use the can AND the original items called for.  ENJOY!

This was terrible!  It lacked flavor and came out sticky.  I made it for a Mexican themed dinner party--everything received rave reviews--except the rice.  It was virtually uneaten, and I ended up throwing the leftovers away.  I'll be sticking with my usual Spanish rice recipe.

A wonderful dish.  A great way to get brown rice past finicky eaters.  I sauteed the pepper with the onion and garlic so it would be softer.  Cheese could be halved to make it a healthier dish.

I usually don't like mexican rice, but thought this was pretty good. My 1yo son liked it as well. Very easy to make. Would probably make again for my family, but not as a regular dish since nobody raved about it.

Let me first state that I used this recipe as a GUIDELINE to use up what I had ON HAND. I didn't have a jalapeno but my kids aren't fans, subbed Cheddar for Monterey Jack cheese, used green and red bell pepper, used already made white rice, and used the drippings from Double Decker Tacos/Taco Seasoning I rather than the vegetable oil. With that stated, the recipe turned out to be THE BEST Hispanic rice dish I've ever had or made. I do plan to make this dish as originally written to compare and rewrite my review. *UPDATE* After making as is, I was not too impressed but it is still a good base recipe. I prefer the original way I made this recipe.

Delicious. Can't wait to try it with the jalapeno and red pepper (I used green in place of the red)! I didn't add the cheese, but I think it would be good with it. I used chicken broth. Great with sliced green onion on top!

This recipe is outstanding!  I've looked for a good mexican rice recipe for a long time.  I added cilantro and green onions to mine(using only 1/4 tspn onion powder).  I also used 3 cups of beef broth, cut the cheese in half, added salt, and used rotel instead of the large tomato(also eliminating the green pepper).  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Terrific aromatic, appetizing side dish for bbq ribs!  I did use long cooking brown rice, adjusting the time to 45 minutes; and the amount of BEEF broth used.  One cup of frozen corn is a nice addition.  This is a keepie!   Yummy!

It paired great with a cilantro lime chicken I made. I used Rotel instead of tomatoes and hatch peppers instead of green peppers. It had great flavor and a nice kick! It really was great recipe thanks for the reviews.

Very tasty and zippy but not too hot.  Appealed to both me and my husband even though we like varying degrees of heat and spicyness in our food.  Also very quick and easy to make.  Made more than the suggested 2-3 servings.  More like 5-6.

Absolutely terrible.  Did exactly what recipe said and used all that it called for - it had no taste whatsoever!  Use tobasco sauce to give it taste and it still didn't help.  Did not like it AT ALL!

It was a good spicy dish. I omitted the cheese, instead of onions, I used onion powder, and instead of cumin, I used more mexican chili powder. It was good, but it wasn't spectacular. I will make it again for myself.
