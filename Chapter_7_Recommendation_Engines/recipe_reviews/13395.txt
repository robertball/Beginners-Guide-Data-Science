This recipe was a pretty good BASE for a 5 star onion soup. As a few people have pointed out, it was very bland. It had 5 stars so I gave it a whirl. I was very disappointed by the amount of doctoring I had to do to this recipe. 

There wasn’t nearly enough onions, instead of 2 onion I used about 4 cups, omitted the water and halved the butter.  I also added about 2 T. garlic (fresh, minced), 1/4c white wine, 2T worcestershire sauce, 1T fresh parsley, dash of salt and a healthy dose of fresh ground pepper and about 1/2t herbs de provence(yum!). 

The result turned out very yummy but I felt like I had to rewrite the whole recipe.

my boyfriend loves french onion soup, so i thought i'd give this one a try!  Following this recipe like it is was VERY BLAND!  it defintly needed some flavoring help.  These are the changes i made:  Just like some of the below comments i used only 3T of butter (this was PLENTY!!!). I also sauteed the onions with 1 clove chopped garlic - then added 1/4 cup of white wine.  I also added about a cup more of beef stalk (would have done boullion if i had had it).  I also added 1 1/2 Tbl. of worchestier sauce, 1/2 tsp parsley, and 1/4 tsp ground thyme.  With these changes..mmm.. it turned out yummy!

I've had to try so many different recipes and I finally got it right with this one.  This is the best recipe you'll find for French Onion Soup.  I add in a couple of teaspoons of Worstershire sauce because my pallet calls for it.  Tons of cheese and bread and you have an entire meal.  We love this one!

I've been looking for a good French Onion Soup recipie and when I saw how many people reviewed this one so positively, I was excited.  Right off the bad, I followed the people who said to add more broth and less water, and to use a boullion cube.  My reaction to this can be described in three words: "Holy gravy, batman!" Basically, by using the three aforementioned suggestions, I ended up making beef broth with a hint of onion.  While people may like this, I prefer the more oniony taste, myself. 

Here's what I suggest.  If you want your onion soup beefy, go ahead and use the three cans broth.  Otherwise, leave it as is, or (-and I would do this either way-) use another onion.  Cut the onion in sixths or eights and then peel apart the layers for more stability and flavor - I found the rings too fragile and not worth the work.  A dab of worcestershire sauce and a (VERY) small sprinkle of thyme are a nice addition.  Finally, go for a blend of gruyere and provolone.  Excellent taste.  

Guten Appetit!

This recipe is amazing!  My husband loved it SO much that he has already requested it again (and I just made it a week ago!).
The only change I made was to add a beef boulion cube to the soup.  I think the 2 1/2 cups of water makes it a little blah, and next time I would use all beef broth.
Oh, and I took another reviewers suggestion and added some Worchestershire sauce.  
Mmmm YUMMY!  You HAVE to try this recipe -- you won't be disappointed!

This was the first recipe that I tried from allrecipes, and I was very impressed! I added a beef bouillon cube to the water, used salad croutons instead of the bread (they stay crunchier),and used mozzarella cheese on top. Excellent soup that I make often!

After our return from France, my fiance and I 
were longing for the wonderful French Onion 
Soup that we had had in while in France. I am
happy to say that last night, our longing was
satified by this recipe. It was really good. Thanks Debbie.

I made a couple of changes to the recipe based on some of the reviews and to suit our taste.  I omitted the flour completely and added a bay leaf and some worchestershire sauce.  I used 1 large spanish onion and 1 large white onion.  Sauteed those in the butter with salt & pepper.  I added about 5.5 cups of beef broth and simmered for half an hour with a bay leaf.  I removed the bay leaf and spooned the soup over toasted thick slices of french bread.  Topped with swiss and baked at 425 for 10 minutes.  It was fantastic!!  I will definitely be making this again.

This was the first time I've ever made French Onion Soup. I thought the recipe was wonderful. I did use three cans of beef broth and less water as other reviews suggested. I used two onions as the recipe called for and I thought that was perfect for my family. My only problem with this recipe, was the amount of butter it called for. I thought this made the soup way to oily. Next time I'd use much less butter or even water to saute the onions. Other than that I thought it was wonderful. I'll absolutley make it again. My Husband loved it. My kids wouldn't touch it, but hey they're kids and it does have onions in it.  : )

This soup was great!  I kept the broth and water as is but did add one extra onion and one low-sodium beef bullian cube which I thought was a nice balance.  I also added a bit of worsteschire and some chopped shallots.  Instead of sprinkling with cheese like in the recipe I found some fresh mozzarella balls at the olive bar at my local grocer.  I tossed two to three in each bowl and let them melt just slightly before serving.  Delicious!!  Husband loved it!

A must for this or any onion soup recipe: Sherry: 1/4 c per 2 cans beef broth.  Makes it complete.

Rave reviews on this soup!  Better than the restaurants for sure.  Used 3 LARGE onions which was plenty for us.  Also added a splash of worcestershire sauce as recommended by other reviewers.  Bread was a bit soggy (despite toasting) will try letting it dry out for a day or so before next time. Also added a healthy dose of garlic powder.  5 stars!

This French Onion soup was fabulous!!  I altered the recipe a bit by adding fresh minced garlic, fresh parsley, and fresh thyme.  I also added worcestire, and balsamic to the onions all before adding the broth!!  My family loved it.  Wish there were left overs.  Yummy!!

After reading all the reviews, I too decided to modify. I added a package of au jus, 2 chopped garlic cloves, a couple of bay leaves, 2 Tbl. of worcestershire and 1/4 cup of white wine. I also doubled the cheese.   My husband loves this soup. I haven't had it enough to know what it's supposed to taste like. Over all I liked it.

My hubs actually made this one. He's the French Onion Fan in the house. We both thought it was good. Only change we made was subbed Provolone Cheese for the Swiss cheese because that's what we had at home. Will make again

Like many other reviewers, I thought that this was just a base for onion soup.  I had to modify it greatly.  So, I have to rate it as written but these are my modifications.  I used 3 onions; sliced as half moons,  2-2 1/2 tbsp butter, 2 cups beef broth and about 1/4 cup water, apple cider vinegar(because I didn't have wine or sherry), about 1/2 tea dried oregano.  I simmered all this until the onions were soft and the flavors melded.  The cider vinegar tasted strange at first.  When I baked the dish with the bread and cheese (Swiss mixed with Gruyere) the finished product came out great.  It ended up tasting like a real French Onion soup.    Thank you for giving me something to start with.  I will make this again with my variations.

This is very good, and easy--I don't even like French Onion soup (my husband does) and I enjoyed this.

I used more onions, and all beef broth as suggested by other reviewers.  Also, I carmelized onions.

Good stuff

I love frnch onion soup. This recipe was improved by adding some red wine in place of some of the broth, it gave it more depth. Also a dash of worcestershire sauce can add an undefinable kick - try it! Gruyere is definitely the best cheese to use for toasts!

This is a great soup, my boyfriend and I make it all the time! We substitute a cup of red wine for some of the water, and add a splash of cream, or half and half, or whatever's in the fridge to make the broth thicker instead of the flour. Sometimes we'll add garlic and pepper for a little kick.

Made this and it was well accepted all around. Did make a few changes; used vegetable broth instead of beef stock, added some tarragon, thyme and a couple of bay leaves.

This recipe rocks!  My wife (who isn't a big fan of onions) absolutely loved the soup. I didn't follow the recipe exactly as I used only beef broth and no water.  It was a bit salty but not bad.  Will try using a low sodium beef broth with the next batch.

It was amazing the only thing that we did differently was we added a packet of dry onion soup mix.  The flavor was incredidable.

Yum. I actually did use only 2 onions, and this made exactly enough for two adults and one 5-year-old. I cut the bread into cubes to make it easier to eat. Also subbed some of the broth for some au jus I had leftover. I wish I would have added more water though; it was a bit too salty. No fault to the recipe submitter though! I added a clove of garlic, and once the onions and garlic were soft I turned the heat up to brown everything. Nice and filling too, this was one of the easier French Onion Soup recipes I have tried, thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!  My husband said he'd never even had it before, and LOVED it!  As good as, if not better than, a restaurant french onion soup.  I don't feel it needs any changes, but I did add a few seasonings as suggested by other reviewers.  I also used more broth and less water.  I will definitely be making this one again and again!

Really great.  I also used all broth rather than the water. Added a dash of Madeira wine.  I made croutons to put on top (french bread sauteed in butter and sprinkled with garlic powder, parsley, and salt then broiled for 5 minutes).  First time I've made Fr Onion soup and loved it.

My husband and I both loved this.  I followed the recipe exactly and we both thought it tasted delicious.  Next time I will use a little more beef broth because we didn't end up with much "soup", it was mostly onions, bread, and cheese but still delicious!

I was not really impressed with this recipe. It was the first time I made French Onion Soup, but the broth came out so very light and there were too many onions. So i won't do this one again.

I had to tweak this recipe a lot, and did what many other reviewers suggested, which was using less water (I used about 1 C), and adding beef bouillon (maybe 1 tsp), salt and pepper (it needed a LOT of salt, but I don't like mine to be really sweet like some might like), a dash of thyme and about 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce. after all those things, it was very tasty. I can't imagine how bland this would have been without all the changes! :(

Basic and good.  Definitely too much butter though, recipe calls for 1/4c butter but you can make the recipe just as delicious by sautéing the onions in half the amount of butter and use water as a substitute.  This is healthier and just as delicious!

This is the best French onion soup my hubby and I have ever had.  What's even better was how simple it was!  I used slices of toasted Italian bread covered with garlic in the soup, and used a shredded "Italian cheese blend" instead of swiss.  It was fantastic, and I will definitely make it again!

Great recipe! I made this for my boyfriend and I and we loved it. It took about 50 min. and well worth it. I used a 14 oz. can of beef broth instead and a slice of provolone on top with a sprinkle of parm and served it with steaks; it was just enough for a nice filling meal. We'll definitely be having it again.

This a great starter recipe that allows you easily add whatever you prefer flavor wise.  The amount of water is good IF you use condensed broth (Campbell's); if using broth that doesn't call for adding a can of water on the label, skip the water and add more of the canned broth.  (I do wish recipes included whether or not the broth is condensed or not but I guess with a recipe like this it is probably safe to assume that it is given the amount of water called for.) Like other reviewers, I added worcestershire and sherry to the broth and a little garlic to the onions.  Be sure to caramelize the onions; it really adds body and flavor to the soup. A pinch of thyme is good here too.  I make croutons instead of whole slice of bread to make it easier to eat.  Don't skimp on the cheese whatever kind you prefer.  Another winner in my house!

Quite tasty recipe.  I did not use any water (next time I will use about 1/4 cup of water) -- opted for all beef broth instead.  Did agree with some other reviewers, it does need about two tablespoons of worcestershire sauce and about two cloves of garlic.  I also used a bit less butter than called for.    I was very happy with the outcome.  Will serve to guests next week!

I'm going to give this five stars! But only with these adjustments... Based on the reviews of others, I didn't include the water at all. I used vegetable broth to make this a vegetarian dish. I doubled the onion, and added parsley flakes, garlic and salt. I also added a dash of balsamic vinegar to combat the slightly bland taste to the whole thing. I used seasoned croutons instead of bread, then topped the bowls off with mozzarella and parmesan cheeses, sprinkled with parsley flakes, and broiled them in the oven til slightly browned. Absolutely delicious and very filling soup.

I probably can't rate this recipe too fairly, since I made quite a few alterations. I used 3 beef bullion cubes with four cups of water and 1/2 cup of sherry. I also added a dash of worchestershire sauce to the soup. We ate it with croutons and cheddar cheese. Even my kids liked it (they just ate the soup, no onions). Very easy to make.

I thought that this recipe would be bland based on other reviews but I was pleasantly surprised.  I made a few adjustments based on the items I had on hand.  I used three beef bullion cubes instead of the canned broth (2 cups water x 3 cubes bullion), I also reduced the additional water to 1 cup.  I added a splash of worstershire sauce and a dash of italian seasoning.  I ommited the parmesan cheese and used whole wheat french bread instead of white and mozarella instead of swiss.

I was sick, out of supplies and in no mood to go shopping, so I made this soup, using a crockpot and a toaster oven. Like everybody else, I made changes. No water, vegetable broth instead of beef (it was what I had), some red wine, worchestershire sauce, a bay leaf, garlic with the onion, etc. I also used mozzarella and ausiago. I left it in the crockpot for about five hours, until the onions were translucent. The result was delicious. It was exactly what I needed for the cold. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to strain out the onions and garlic.

I have to agree with Amy S and others.  Left alone this soup is slightly bland. I added salt, pepper and a little bit of thyme.  I also cooked my onions in olive oil instead of butter.  I should have added some white wine but forgot.  I really missed that flavor.  While this is not a bad soup, I do prefer French Onion Soup V from this web site so far.  Thanks for the recipe but I will probably keep looking.

I love French Onion soup and tonight was my first time making it.  I used only 1 T of flour, 2 1/4 C of water, added 1 T of Worcestershire sauce, and 1 tsp of  beef soup base in addition to the beef broth.  I lightly buttered my French bread, added some garlic salt and toasted them.  It was restaurant quality!

I used half the butter called for, but the soup still managed to taste impressively rich and buttery.  For the cheese I used shredded mozzarella and thinly sliced gruyere.  Definately resturant quality flavor from this recipe.

This is one easy, tasty soup to prepare. My husband loved it, said it was as good or better than ones served at restaurants.  I omitted the parmesan cheese and used shredded swiss only, but much more and 1/4 cup.  Success!

Thank you Debbie!  I've finally found a French onion soup rich enough for my tastes!  I listened to some other reviewers and used 3 cans beef broth, beef bouillon cubes, and more water. I even add more onions! When sautéing the onions, I add a bit of water so that they do not burn to the pan.  That way, I can use less margarine. I only use red onions, which are really sweet.  Great, just great!

This is a very good basic recipe. However, I highly encourage you to add some worchestire sauce. Otherwise, the soup is rather bland. I added provolone and grated parmesan. I will definitely use swiss next time though. Thanks for the recipe Debbie!

Excellent recipe!  I've tried a few different cheeses and loved it with provolone.  After putting it together and topping with cheese, try a couple of minutes under the broiler.  It browns the cheese up nicely.

This is one of the best recipes I have found on allrecipes.com! I used 3 cans of beef broth and about a cup of water, plus one beef bullion cube. It turned out better than in a restaurant.

I think French Onion Soup is my husbands all time favorite meal. He loves when I make this (and I love it too!). We have this often, I've used mozzarella cheese before when I haven't had swiss. The swiss is better though. Yum!

This was definitely a great foundation for the soup; however it did need a bit more flavor. Next time will add a package of au jus seasoning! But was still pretty good overall!

This is simple, cheap, and has an amazing taste.  I used red onions and provolone in my version and didn't have to add any extra flavoring.  Cheers to Debbie!

First time I've made Fr. Onion soup.  Turned out great.  Few things I modified:  added only 1/2 cup of water, used Swanson's beef broth carton, mozzarella instead of swiss, parmesan as an option. Good basis will build on the recipe later.

Great recipe.  I have made this twice.  The first time I made it for my girlfriend because her stomach was upset and she could only eat bland food, so I followed the recipe as is. The second time I made it I added the bouillon cube as suggested, and I also substituted 1 cup of red wine for 1 cup of water.  This gave an entirely new flavor to the soup, but I like it and it went over quite well.

I agree that this is a good 'starter' onion soup, but it's pretty bland without some additions. I omitted the water and just used beef broth. I added Worcestershire sauce, white wine (4tb per onion), and salt & pepper. It was really tasty if a bit oily from the butter. I would probably cut down on the butter next time. I would make again, but only with the modifications I made.

I've made this three times now, and it always turns out nummerlicious (we made up that word for our dog, but it's appropriate here... num num num num num)!

I took some of the other reviewers' advice and added Worchestershire sauce and substituted more beef broth for the suggested amount of water.

This is an easy and delicious meal.  We don't have it a lot, but it's in the rotation, and it's definitely worth a try.

This was good.  Easy too. Turned out great!  I added some minced garlic, seasoning salt and Worchestshire sauce to the onions while cooking.  I am really impressed with how good this really was...considering that there is not much to it.

Excellent flavor and my husband said it was better than any restaurants.  Easy to make.  Served with swiss cheese melted on top and extra french bread for dipping and made it a meal!

Great recipe and so easy to do.  I had to come home and make dinner quickly and was able to make this with time to spare before I had to leave.  And the taste is awesome.  Thank you so much.

This is an awesome recipe. My family really enjoyed this. It was such a hit that I am now the official soup maker for all dinners. The only thing I changed was the cheese to top the soup. I used a slice of provolone and a slice of mozzerella on top.

This was really not bad, but I would have to agree with other reviewers that the recipe calls for too much water (and I used 1/2 cup less than called for). I had to give it 3 stars because when I tasted it after it was prepared per the recipe is was really bland, and I don't even salt my food normally. It was just missing 'something'. After trying to figure out what I had on hand that might work (and even adding salt) I finally added chicken bouillon (didn't have beef) and that did the trick. I will make it again, but I will use less water, maybe even none, and double the beef broth instead.

the additional water does make this soup too bland. i stuck with using all low sodium beef broth and salted it to my taste.
this recipe definitely NEEDS thyme and wine, otherwise, its just like hot water with onions.

I love this recipe! It's simpler than some french onion soup recipes I've seen. I add a splash of white wine and mushrooms. My husband doesn't usually eat stuff like this, but this is one of his top requests!

At first I was really disapointed. The soup part seemed to taste like beef broth more then anything and I wasn't that impressed. HOWEVER...once the french bread was in the bowl and the cheese was on top I totally changed my mind.  It was very good. The ease and taste makes this a 5 star!   I only used 3T of butter and there was no excess butter in the soup.

Very easy to make and it was delicious.  I made it early in the day and then simmered it in the crockpot for a few hours, and then continued with the rest of the recipe.  Very GOOD!!

I was reading the reviews for this recipe while searching for a "basic" French Onion Soup recipe.  

If you want to add more flavor, try adding a bottle of your favourite beer or a glass or wine (red or white) it doesn't really matter.

I used 3 large spanish onions for this much broth, forgot the flour and added a bay leaf while simmering. Put soup in bowls, layed toast on top, covered with Parmesan and Mozzarella and broiled to perfection!  Thanks for the excellent recipe.

Awesome! I'm impressed!

Really really good, tastes like what you get in a restaurant.  I made a few modifications.  Used more onions, few cloves of garlic, Worcestershire sauce, a splash of wine wine and a beef bullion cube.  Also added a packet of French onion soup mix.  Simmered about 45 minutes.  So good!

I used gruyere, organic veggie broth and added some thyme. The veggie broth required extra salt to make it as tasty as beef broth.

It was my first time making french onion soup and I think I got the idea. It was okay. I had it with a pastrami on rye. Good pairing. I made it just like the recipe but added in variation more worchestershire sauce, thyme, parsley, garlc, and white wine.

This recipe is missing something, and I think it's WORCHESTER SAUCE. I made it: - once as is (very bland);  - second time adding white wine, thyme, and worchester sauce (good to very good);  - third time adding leeks with the onions and worchester (out of white wine and forgot about the thyme (great).

I made this with low sodium beef stock and it was great.  We did have to add extra salt, but usually although I like French Onion Soup, I can't eat too much because of the saltiness.  I can't wait to make it again.  We had it with our steak dinner one night and with loaded baked potatoes another night.  It felt like we were eating out.

This is the 1st French Onion I ever made and wow!  This is some good stuff.  I added and onion bullion cube along with the beef bullion and 2 teaspoons of corn starch to thicken up the broth.  Another thing I did with this is cut the bread into bite size pieces and this made this much easier to eat!  This soup was gone in a fre min.

This was a decent soup.  I made it for my husband and myself, so I scaled it down to half the recipe.  I had to make some modifications, but it still turned out pretty good.  I took the suggestions of others and added Worcestershire sauce, I also used croutons I had in the pantry, because I didn't have french bread.  I personally like Mozzarella Cheese and Romano and Parmesean cheese on top.  It turned out nice, husband ate it all up. It wasn't quite the best I have had.  Let's just say it didn't taste quite like our favorite but it did ok in a pinch.

Easy to make but I would not add the parmesan cheese since it doesn't seem to melt as well as the other cheese. Also, I think it's a bit too much water. Tasted good but I think I'll try a different recipe next time.

No one would eat it.  They just stared at it and made faces.  I thought it was bland and kind of boring.  I think it was missing something major!

This was my first french onion soup and everyone loved it. I only used a half cup of water, and substituted the rest with beef broth. There is no mention of salt or pepper in this recipe, but I used both. And sweet paprika. A great soup for a dark, rainly day

This was a really good recipe. Great taste, the thyme was nice. I agree about the butter though, a bit too much. Will cut back on this next time.

I originally started off making this recipe as is and have now adjusted it to suit our tastes. With other reviewers I too found the soup rather bland as is, so whenever I make it I am sure not to forget the bouillion and seasonings. I also leave out the flour. When I was making it with the flour it would foam up all over the top of the soup and not incorporate into it. With these adjustments the recipe for us now is to die for. Thank you for giving us a good base to work with.

Great receipe, add 1-2 chicken boullion cubes and 2 lg (knorrs) beef cubes, along with 1/2 cup or to taste red cooking wine, Boiling for a few minutes after adding wine will disapate alcohol and leave that rich traditional New Orleans flavour, Even my wife who hates onions! Loves this old world flavor

Yummy Soup. My 2 year old thought it was the GREATEST! I didn't even use the bread and he loved it. The onions floating around in it were his favorite part!

While I was cooking it up, the buttery smell was too much to my liking, so I added one more can of broth, and one more cup of soup.  I also had to finish by putting all the soup, bread and cheese in a cass. pan since none of my soup dishes were safe in the oven.

The end result was a fantastic soup that even my children liked :-)

Follow advice of users that say, use less onions (2), and add a beef bouillon or two, and flavor with worchestershire and/or soy sauce.  This was my first attempt with FOS and my husband and I were both extremely happy with the results.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks Debbie!

Pretty good, not not as flavorful as I would have liked.  I toasted some bread cubes myself and threw them in a bowl with some mozzarella cheese and it was better like that.

I make this a lot, and it always turns out perfect.  I do add a little salt on occasion.  I also substitute mozerella cheese as I do not like swiss or parmesan.  It is an all time favourite at my house.  (I have also frozen this for easy lunches for work..perfect!!)

Pretty good. I am still in search of the perfect recipe though. I would make it again. I left out the bread as I am just not a fan of much bread in my french onion soup. Overall, good flavor.

Very bland, and watered down. Added about 2x amount of boullion to give flavor. Husbands comments: "tastes like chicken" (not very good commentary). Needs more seasoning other than boullion. The cheese was the best part. Maybe I did it wrong....

I was looking for a good french onion soup recipe, and this is it!  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  Based on some of the other reviews, I substituted additional beef broth in place of the water, added a bay leaf, and used 1 1/2 red onions and 1 yellow onion.  Tasted great.  Will double the recipe next time, because there was not much leftover and it was just my husband and me.

Very tasty soup.  I really enjoyed it.  It was also easy to prepare.  I liked dipping cheese toast into it!

Very easy, VERY tasty.  We use store bought croutons and skip the step for toasting the french bread.

I hate to dissent, but this was not as good as I expected. (Turned out that my newleywed husband won't eat French Onion Soup, so I'm just going off of my own opinion here.) It was rather weak-bodied, and I missed the bay leaf. I might try again with bay, and different cheeses, and broil it to get that nice browned top. But then again, I may just try a different recipe. Thanks anyway.

I have been looking for a recipe for french onion soup that is not only easy to make, but tastes great. I have eaten alot of onion soup from many different places, and this has got to be one of the best! My entire family loved it! I chose not to make any modifications as some people did. I though it was perfect as is! This one is a keeper!!!

Great recipe!! Simple yet tasty. This is the first time I have made French onion soup and it won't be the last. I accidentally added to much margarine and it came out a little heavy on the oil so it imprtant to follow the recipe as written.
