Yummy! And SUPER easy to slap together - I mixed it all up in under a minute. Wear latex gloves while rolling the balls, as the mixture can be a tad sticky. I tried them with both walnuts and almonds... the walnut ones were richer and chewier, while the almond ones turned out crunchier and a bit lighter. I prefer the walnut version. They were baking in the oven when my husband came home, and he commented that they made the house smell heavenly. This will definitely be a staple for when I have guests - they're so fancy and gourmet-tasting, with so little effort on my part!

Delicious and easy!   I don't get why people complain/give a bad review when they don't follow directions. Perhaps the "metallic" taste wannabaker complained about was due to using foil on the sheets, instead of parchment as instructed.  Easy cookies, very rich flavour, and they looked pretty.  This was the first time I was asked for a cookie recipe. Thank you for sharing!

I made a colassal mess of my kitchen.  This recipe looked so simple and good.  Cookie bakers, heed my experience...
I ground too many walnuts, so I added extra liquids - I must have added too much because when I took my cookies out of the oven there was one big cookie burnt on to my pan.  So after playing with it a bit I found:
heat the oven to 300 degrees; 
add extra nuts, at least 1/2 a cup and no extra liquids.  You MUST line the pan with partchment or at least tin-foil! - I thought I could get away with just greasing the pan as with so many other recipies.
And finaly cook for only 15 to 18 minutes.  Whew! Pretty good cookie after I cleaned up the mess and corrected my mistakes.

This is a excellent recipe and I disagree with the others who complained that the egg mixture is too runny or that there is not enough egg for walnut mixture. The trick is to beat the egg yolks on medium/high for 5 minutes until it is light and yellow and gradually add sugar. Then you have a nice white/sugar paste. Then I mix in the almonds. I use a kitchenaid mixture for all this mixing. I didn't have any problem rolling them into small little teaspoon size balls using my hand. A standard cookie sheet will fit 18 little dough balls. My mom is persian and she said these reminded her of the same cookies she had when she was a child. I used only 2 tsp of cardamom and omitted the rose water. Despite many persian recipes using rose water, the authentic recipe does not call for it. I added 1 tsp of vanilla instead and the taste was perfect. I also think the baking time is too high and this will burn your cookies. I baked  mine at 300 degrees for 20 minutes middle rack. Perfect to dip in tasty persian black tea!

These cookies were a huge hit with my Persian family.  They were gone in a matter of minutes! A few tips:  My first batched burned very quickly.  Start checking on them after 10 minutes.  The cookies flattened out a lot.  They were very thin so the two inch spacing between cookies is very important.  Also, I only used 1 tsp cardamom and it was perfect!

I've made this recipe on several occasions. When the cookies turn out well, they are scrumptious and are easily gone in two days. We refer to them as walnut lace cookies because they are light, have a little crunch, and are flavorful.  But, as other reviewers have mentioned, I've have had my share of problems with this recipe. Three egg yolks usually aren't enough to make the batter stick (it hardly clumps together!) So, I either add another egg yolk (making 4 in total) or 2 egg yolks and one whole egg. I also have major issues with the term "finely ground walnuts." One time, I pulsed whole walnuts in a food processor to create finely ground nuts; I ended up with one, big, runny cookie. Another time, I lightly pounded whole walnuts in a plastic bag with a skillet; the end result was a slightly less runny cookie. So, I now used chopped walnut pieces. My cookies aren't as smooth as the ones shown in the photograph, but at least they are individual cookies. Also, I think using a silpat pad works better than the parchment paper. As the recipe suggests, do leave space between cookies because they spread and 20 minutes is indeed sufficient cooking time.

These were incredible. I made a double batch - one for a hostess gift, and one to stash in my freezer. The family I gave them to LOVED them and requested the recipe. I ended up raiding my own freezer for them the next day - my husband and I ate the whole batch in one sitting! I'll definitely be making them this year for Passover. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!!!!

These were quite tasty.  I really can't say anything on the authenticity of them, but they were light and slightly crisp.  Good flavor and they grow a good amount while baking (don't put these on the bottom rack though!)

"The Rebbetzin Chef's Persian Walnut Cookies" are really delicious! I made them for Nowruz (Iranian New Year), and my Iranian-born husband approved them! They bring back memories of Iran and Ameh Fatimeh's walnut grove in the mountains. Here are my own tips for making these cookies learned through my own trial and error process: (i) sort the walnut halves (grind the imperfect halves for the cookie dough and save the perfect halves for the garnish on top); (ii) weight the walnuts before grinding them so you can just make the entire cookie directly in the food processor after grinding the walnuts (1.5 cups of ground walnuts = 8-1/8 ounces of walnuts according to my measures); (iii) refrigerate the dough before rolling into balls (much easier to work with); (iv) use an actual measuring spoon (teaspoon) for measuring the dough (these cookies spread to about 2" diameter although the walnut garnish will be the same size as the cookie before baking); (v) CONSIDER REMOVING THE COOKIES FROM OVEN AFTER 10 MINUTES (NOT 20 MINUTES AS IN THE RECIPE) UNLESS YOU LIKE BURNT COOKIES JUST LIKE MY FIRST BATCH. They appear raw, but cook sitting on cookie sheet cooling in the following 10 minutes (as in the recipe description); (vi) the cookies taste best if let to sit a day for the flavor to develop.  Thank you The Rebbetzin Chef  for sharing your recipe. It is a keeper!

I followed the recipes as written, but heeded the advise of another and reduced the bake time to 10 minutes.  They turned out spectacular!  Seems a few folks have different methods of getting the walnuts finely ground.  I happen to have a Health Master (Living Well with Montel) and I was able to use the pulse feature to get the walnuts completely ground/mashed.  The walnuts ended up to be the consistency of peanut butter.  This seemed to work great for this recipe.  To get uniform size cookies I rolled a small 1-inch diameter size tube and used a teaspoon to slice each into desired portion size.  I rolled each measured unit into balls and topped with a walnut piece.  I also sprinkled each with a dash more cardamon for a little extra flavor. I happen to love cardamon! My husband is Persian, and was wowed by this treat.  I served this with our afternoon tea.

I have baked these twice so far. First time I messed up on timing and burned the batch. Second I followed directions more precisely and ended with some of the most beautiful and great tasting cookies. Will definitely make bake them again. I am not sure why people think three egg yolks were not enough. Dough turned out to be very good. One thing don't leave them on the baking rack and for me it took about twelve minutes to bake. After ten minutes you have to watch them because they burn very quickly after that.

These are, without question, some of the best cookies I've ever had or made. Not really hard to make at all, and they have a very distinct flavor. I wound up using pecans instead, since I'm sort of a fan of them, and they turned out wonderfully. My grandmother ate most all of these. She's not usually big on "exotic" ingredients like cardamom or rose water, but she said these cookies were addictive. I'll definitely be making them again, hopefully figuring the egg glaze out this time.

I took a beautiful platter of these cookies to a party and the following morning, my husband grabbed a few to have with his coffee!  Crispy, delicate, light & nice flavor!  I used 1/2 ground almonds & 1/2 ground walnuts & I didn't have time to finish with the egg wash.  I baked them on a Silpat sheet, so while they were very soft emerging from the oven, they were perfectly easy to remove, and crisped up immediately when cool.

Very easy and just as tasty. Because walnuts are the main ingredient, these are a bit on the oily side.

These were very easy to make, and I used nonstick spray on foil and they did not stick.  However, they had a really metallic flavor.  I think there may be way too much cardamom, or perhaps I needed to use a better quality rose water.  Not sure.  I will try this again because I like the idea of the cookie and they have a nice crispy texture, but maybe I will use way less cardamom, leave out the rose water or replace the cardamom with cinnamom or the like.  Bakers, definitely stick to teaspoon sized balls when making them, they spread big time.

Just made our first batch. Recipe seems to work fine as is but I'd like more flavor. The ground walnuts are a bit like a stiff chunky peanut butter. 20 minutes was the right amount of baking time. I placed my cookies a little too close and they fused to other cookies but once they're cool you separate them easily. A teaspoon looks small but spread a lot. The egg yolk glaze was probably unnecessary. The rose water taste was very faint. Cardamom was pretty noticeable. Texture was great light and crispy. I might add other spices next time, maybe cinnamon or nutmeg. Its a good idea to have an oven thermometer, just because you set it for 350 doesn't mean that's what it is.

Interesting recipe - made these for Passover. I had no experience with cookies such as these and I read all the reviews before embarking on this discovery adventure. I followed the directions except did not finely grind walnuts, just pulverized some and left others rough. The cardamon and rose water created a lovely scent (reminded me of my grandmother's bathroom). As far as my preference goes, I found the rose water overwhelmed the cookie. If I repeat this recipe, I'd try an orange water or grand mariner or using half the rose water (the first two changes might disqualify it for Passover? I'm not jewish so I'm not sure). Also using the egg white + water - take care not to let it run over onto the parchment, it glued the cookie down and it ripped when I pulled it off. I'd also make smaller size cookie - they pack a punch and not sure everyone tonight wants to eat a large one. We shall see. Interesting cookie indeed.

These were awesome! They had a lovely crisp after they cooled and my whole family enjoyed them. I did as another reviewer suggested and I beat the three egg yolks for five minutes before gradually adding the rest of the ingredients. I didn't grind my walnuts to a powder and I left them in tiny pieces. Also, as I didn't have rose water or cardamom, I used a teaspoon of maple syrup (I like to substitute vanilla extract with maple syrup; you can hardly notice the difference) and scant two teaspoons of grated ginger instead. I didn't do the egg glaze and I rolled the dough into 1/2 teaspoon sized balls. I lined my cookie sheets with parchment paper and I baked them at 300 degrees for 15 minutes. Sadly some on the bottom rack burned though :( watch them carefully. Other than that, the cookies turned out great! They looked exactly like the ones in the photo. I'll definitely be making these again. This recipe made around sixty small cookies. They do spread, so don't forget to leave space between the cookies.

Just had the most fun trying out this recipe!  Read the reviews and followed the recipe as written except substituted pistachios as suggested in the description above.  Easy to make and just love the resulting unusual aroma and taste of these cookies.  Family loves them, too.

Super easy, yes, but anybody up for pepper flavored cookies!?  Not here. Must be an acquired taste. Wish I had read wannabebaker before I started.  WAY too much cardamon in recipe. Can't imagine why the rose water is so important.  I did take advice  and turned down the oven and cooked less time that instructed. Parchment worked great. I always bake with it anyways.  I even put giant dollops of high quality chocolate on them and still nobody would eat them.

I made these for an office Christmas party. A few people had gluten sensitivity and there were a couple of vegans (who were OK with the eggs). These came out great. The texture is out of this world. The unusual flavor profile is not everyone's cup of tea; however, they are delicious and were appreciated by the crowd. Oh, I was out of walnuts and used pecans. Good results. I can't say whether walnuts would be better or not.

These cookies made with ground almonds are good if eaten right away but they got too hard to eat the next day. They're not good when they lose the chewy texture.

My family loves these. We have some gluten free and some diabetic, they easily use sugar substitutes. Easy to make. Made with Almonds, Walnuts, Pistachios, and even Macadamia nuts.

These were REALLY good and light tasting. I used egg white for the wash instead of yolk (because of course I had it :) , and I cut the cooking time by almost half (to 12 minutes) as my oven apparently heats high.
