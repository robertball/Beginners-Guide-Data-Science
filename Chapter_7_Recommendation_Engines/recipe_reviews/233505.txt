I didn't make the recipe, but found it while looking  for safe instructions to can my family's favorite recipe. I have no doubt this recipe tastes good, from looking at the ingredients...BUT BE CAREFUL with this recipe. The USDA recommends using ONLY PRESSURE CANNING when preserving soups and they advice against using thickeners, such as flour, because the product will not heat evenly or thoroughly for safe processing. If you want to use this recipe, I suggest you leave out the butter and flour, then process quart jars in a pressure canner for 20 minutes @ 10 lbs. Make a roux, using flour and butter,  and then add to the processed soup when you are ready to serve it. I'm not trying to be difficult...I love canning, but don't want anyone to get sick from not processing their food properly.

This is for the canning scaredey cats...Tomatoes are highly acidic.  Sugar is a great preservative.  There is no doubt in my mind that this is perfectly safe for canning.  If you are truly worried you could always pressure can it, but it is likely more acidic than your run of the mill home canned salsa.

I have not made this particular recipe, but it is very similar to one I have made for many years.  It has flour and butter with the vegetables.  I can it in a water bath canner. Never have had any
problems with it.

Apart from making the tomato juice a day previous, I followed directions from my All American canner guide book and processed the pints for 20 minutes in a boiling water bath. This recipe made 14 pints! I'm thrilled with it.

This is the first time I have canned tomato soup.  It is really very good!  I thought it was a little salty, but that was before I read the part where you mix it with equal parts milk before serving.  Its very very tasty!!!!

I have made this and liked it, but like the first reviewer,  I am worried about the safety of water bath canning this.  How about trying freezing it?

If you know about preserving and canning than you know this is NOT not Proper canning procedure for these ingredients. Celery and onions are low acid ingredients. Tomatoes are just barely acidic enough on their own, so to be safe we add lemon juice. When you combine the large amounts of low acid vegetables (3onions & a bunch of celery!) to the tomatoes it changes the acidity enough that you can get very very sick! It might not happen the first time or the twenty third but botulism is nothing to be la-de-da about. It only takes once to kill you!

I love tomatoes but I always remove the seeds when I can them. Seeds cause the tomatoes to become bitter. Easy to do and the soup will taste great!

I have a recipe identical to this except it calls for spices.  We love it and have always canned using the water bath method. Recently we were told that because of the other non acidic ingredients we should not be using  a water bath but a pressure canner instead.  It might be a good idea to check with y our local Extension to see what they recommend.  I dont like to use the pressure canner but now have concerns that the  water bath is not enough for safety.

You can not add flour when canning. It has to be added after opening the jar. This recipe is very unsafe.

I diced  the onion and celery real fine and then did not strain. Used tomato sauce instead of juice. Otherwise followed recipe. Very good.

I scaled way back on this recipe to make sure I was going to like it first. It came out great! Until adding the milk that is. I heated it up real slow but it still separated. I think it was user error though and will update my review once I try another jar.
