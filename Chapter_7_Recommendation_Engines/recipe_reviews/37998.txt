This is a fun activity for the kids - especially when camping.  To the previous reviewer, the recipe calls for a pasteurized egg (I use Eggbeaters) so you don't have to worry about cooking it.

I tried this recipe out at a recent 4-H club meeting.  Watching the girls have a good time while they rolled the cans was fun, and they even ended up creating several games and contests during the rolling.  The highlight of the day was (of course) getting to eat the results of all the play.  It was a big hit!

Erm.. Sorry, I just can't classify this as "ice cream".

For frozen pudding it's OK.. but it's not ice cream.

Sorry.

Did you happen to catch the nutrional facts on this recipe?  The sodium content alone would kill you... that is, of course, if you're eating that cup of rock salt.  So... word to the wise... don't eat the rock salt... ha ha ha.

I helped the little kids make this at a recent family get together. We all had a blast taking turns rolling the can around and rolling it across the floor to each other. A lot of fun and the ice cream is really very good. I am going to try it with other flavors.

I have a HUGE problem serving my children raw eggs. I heated the cream, then mixed warm cream with the egg to bring to close to the temp of the cream. I slowly added the warmed egg to the cream and cooked a few minutes. I then let it cool and mixed with the remaining ingredients. Not really worth all the work!
