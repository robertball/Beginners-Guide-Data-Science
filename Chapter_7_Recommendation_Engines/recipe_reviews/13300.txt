Very good taste!  Note:  I pureed only a portion of the beans because I could see the soup would be nothing but creamy, and decided I would not puree the beans at all next time I make it--I like having textured black bean soup.

The most amazing black bean soup!!! Much better with dry beans, canned don't give you the texture you need. The only comment I would make would be to eliminate the 2 cups of water. The broth makes it plenty liquidy, and the extra 2 cups of water make it too thin

This soup is a crowd pleaser- and my two year old LOVED it! Even with extra cooking my beans didn't completely soften which was not a problem after I blended the entire batch. I completely prepared the soup a day early and then set it in a crock pot before we headed out to the pumpkin patch. When we returned a few hours later, the house smelled wonderful and the soup pleased everyone. It is so tasty that we will be having it again soon. Thanks!

Update: It is Oct 23, 2008, five years (to the day) after my first review of this soup. We are having it tonight. It is truly a family favorite- a staple of our fall and winter meal plan. It is a great kid-pleaser. BTW, my beans didn't soften up tonight either!

This one is a keeper.  I saved some beans and vegetables, but pureed most of the soup.  The consistency was excellent, almost creamy.  I skipped the soy sauce since I used canned beans and they have plenty of salt.

I was skeptical about this at first, but it's probably one of the best soups I have ever had. I didn't puree it because I thought having the whole beans would be nice and I doubt I ever will puree it in the future.

Good recipe.  I didn't plan this the night before, so hadn't soaked the dry beans.  Instead, I substituted 3 cans of black beans. Following some other suggestions I skipped the 2 C. of water, dropped the soy sauce to one teaspoon and I found it too vinegary so next time I would suggest only using 1 T. of balsamic vinegar.

I like this reecipe a lot, but with a few changes:

1.) Only add water if necessary
2.) Use canned black beans
3.) Reserve some black beans to add back to the pot after puree-ing (it adds a nicer texture, I think)
4.) Add a few dashes of green Tabasco sauce.

Yum!

This soup was awesome! I used the dry beans. I also read the other reviews and only pureed half of the mixture and left half of the beans in the soup and also eliminated the two cups of water. I like having some beans in the soup rather than it being all liquid. I made it for a tailgate party and everyone loved it.  It has a little kick to it, which was the perfect amount of spice.  This is definitely a keeper.

This soup is exquisitely fantastic. I used Better Than Bouillon ham base + water in place of the chicken broth. This is certain to become a family favorite. Thanks for the recipe!

SO AWESOME!  My boyfriend, a picky eater, had me make it TWICE this week.  I did the quick-soak method on my beans...1 pound of beans covered with 2 " of water, boil 2 minutes, remove from heat, cover and let sit 1 hour.  As others suggested, I left out the 2 c. water when I added the broth and added 1 pound of chopped leftover Thanksgiving ham.  Along with the cayanne and cumin, I added 1/2 tsp curry...the other of my favorite "c" spices.  I only pureed about 1/2 as others suggested and the texture was perfect.  On the balsamic vinegar...which seems to be an issue with other reviewers as well...I only had 1T in the pantry for the first batch.  I could barely taste it.  I added the 2T called for in the second batch and I thought it was too strong...but my boyfriend loved it.  Will probably compromise at 1 1/2T next time.  I also added 1T liquid smoke at the end as I LOVE that flavor.  Served it with sour cream and green onions and crusty homemade bread.  Just great!!!  Thanks so much for a WONDERFUL recipe!

This was delicious! I followed all the directions, except I used 2 cans of black beans and 2 cups chicken broth, and no more water. I added the sherry and vinegar at the end and mistakenly omitted the soy sauce. I didn't make a soup but instead simmered down the liquids and served as a side dish. Magnificent!

Splendid!  Made exactly as written except used veggie stock in place of chicken broth, left out the sherry and used just one TBSP vinegar -- garnished with thinly sliced green onions and red bell pepper for a fantastic vegan dinner main course -- definitely a keeper.

Fantastic soup. For added flavor I cooked the vegetables in bacon fat instead of olive oil and omitted the 2 cups of water. I will definitely make this again. I served the soup with brown rice, sour cream, and green onions. Loving it!

First of all, I used canned black beans.  In the soup I added a little more cumin & cayenne pepper.  I added some chili powder that the recipe didn't call for, but I didn't use any sherry.  I didn't bother blending the ingredients, but just mashed some of the beans while it was in the pot.    I served this soup with ensalada de cebollas (onion salad) which consisted of tomatoes, onions, cilantro, lime juice, and a little salt.  I also had rice with mixed vegetables.    This is a very good recipe that tastes even better the next day!

A really good black bean soup. I pureed the entire dish because I like the silky texture. I did add some salt since I cooked my black beans without any salt added and it has a little too much cayenne for my taste. With these adjustments I think it will be a five star. Serving suggestions: a mound of rice in the middle of the bowl, some drained plain yogurt (for thicker texture) and onions, or perhaps in a "bread bowl." Very versatile.

Made this last night. Technically, it's meatless, but I used a hambone for added flavor. I cut the cayenne in half, added dried mushrooms, and use half chicken broth/half vegeteble broth (leftovers in the frig). I also used leftover red onion, doubled garlic, added 1/2 t. cumin more (love cumin). Didn't have celery; subbed celery seed (1/2 t.) We served over brown rice with a dallop of sour cream.

Very Very good soup, I used canned black beans though. I also added 1/2 Red Bell Pepper, 1/2 Red Onion, and i pulse blended the celery with 1 1/2 aji cachucha peppers. I will definitely make this again. the only thing i would do differently is use 3 cans instead of 2 cans of beans. The next time i made this the only thing i changed was the amount of water/broth. i just used 2 cups of chicken stock with 2 cans of black beans.

Not great but easy--I found it very bland, but nothing hot sauce couldn't fix.  I did a half recipe and started soaking the beans the morning I cooked it, and they were perfectly cooked.  I also pureed the soup with an immersion blender--I highly recommend blending it, so that the texture is silky.

I served this with a lump of steamed rice in the middle of the bowl and with the Best... Grilled Margarita Chicken...Ever! recipe I found on this sight.  What an amazing meal.  The flavors went so well together.

I took the advice of other reviewers and left the water out of the soup.  I also only pureed half the soup.

I had planned on putting in the vinegar but after tasting it(more than once...it was soooo good!) I just couldn't put it in.  It was so amazing without it I would have cried if I didn't like the vinegar flavor added in.

My husband couldn't stop raving about how good it was through the entire meal.

Thank you!

This was delicious! I ran out of sherry and used jack daniels instead, very yummy. Also, served it with sour cream, green and red onion, and grilled and sliced turkey keilbasa.

This soup is the BEST I EVER COOKED!!!!!  This was my first time cooking it and it came out so darn good that I hurt myself eating 2 LARGE bowls.  The beans took over 6 hours to cook, but well worth the time spent.

When I blended this soup fully (reason:  cooked celery chunks) and added 1/3 cup sugar, which balanced all the heat and spices, it became the best soup I'd ever made.  Garnish with a little chopped cilantro instead of sour cream.  WHAT a delectable soup.

Great recipe!!  It was a hit with cuban sandwiches!  You can also use the quick-soak method for the beans; boil in water for 2 minutes then soak for 1 hr.  Then, rinse and use as if you soaked overnight.

We really liked the complex flavors of this black bean soup.  We added a few jalapenos for added spice and some extra garlic as we can never have enough.  Served with some cheddar cheese sprinkled on top.

I only pureed a small amount of mine because we all liked the texture of the beans. The flavor was great and it was perfect with slices of radish, a few sprigs of cilantro and a dollop of sour cream.

This was o.k., but I'll keep searching for another black bean soup recipe.  I used dried beans and soaked them for almost 24 hours before cooking them, and they still didn't soften.  Next time I'll bring them to a brief boil and let them sit.  I ended up having to puree the entire batch with my hand blender.

This recipe turned out fantastic.  We had a group of 30 for a party and I made this along with cuban roasted pork and rice.  I did vary the recipe a bit by omitting the sherry, cut the vinegar a bit, added more garlic and added oregano and blended only one third of the beans and let it simmer much longer (about another hour or so) to blend the flavors more.  Our dominican and cuban guests loved it.  Next time I will thicken the broth with a bit of cornstarch (just my own preference).

I really enjoyed this mild and filling soup. I added about double the cayenne and 1/2 tsp ground curry, and used all chicken broth instead of water and broth...the soup is quite liquidy for a pureed soup, so if I make again I'll reduce to just the amount of broth called for and add no other liquid. the dollup of sour cream adds a nice, surprising tang (but my hubby didn't like it as well as just the plain soup.)

This was very tasty and easy. I was scared to put the sherry in, but it really did add a wonderful flavor once I did it. My boyfriend and my picky 11 year old son both like it very much.

Yum! This black bean soup was delicious! I made a few changes, though. I only pureed half of the beans, and it had a nice texture. I also cooked some salt-pork in with it for added flavor. Because of the added salt from the meat, I omitted the soy sauce. I served it with chopped onion and sour cream : )

I love soups, especially when I can freeze some servings.  I increased the quantities (my pkg of beans was a bit bigger) but tried to keep the ratio of the ingredients.  I was also afraid the freezing would lose the hint of the sherry, but it didn't! I found it easier to use a hand blender to puree the soup directly in the pot.  This left some very tasty bits in the soup.  Hearty comfort stuff!  Thank you W Anatooskin!

I made this with canned black beans with no problem.  Recipe doubles quite nicely.  Make sure and stir the soup before you show anyone because it looks terrible when it is separated. Super easy to prepare and tastes great.

This is a great base recipes.  I did some substituting and additions.  First of all I added lots of flavor using a 4.5lb picnic ham (bone in) to cook and soften my beans.  The ham was simply delicious after the cooking was finished. I also used a variety of hot peppers to give it some more pizzaz.  I omited the sherry and used more chicken broth to the stock.  All and all this recipe was very good to work with.

Overall, we really liked this soup.  I made a few changes and we liked it better this way:  1. I used three cans of black beans-do not rinse. 2. I added all the spices and liquids together, plus 1 1/2 t. liquid smoke as it was cooking. 4. I used homemade chicken stock-four cups, no water.  And I did add the two cans of ham-do not drain. 5. I did not even blend it and it turned out great.  6. I think part of what we liked about this soup is that I also added 1 cup of chopped, fresh parsley, as the other vegatables were being sauted.

If it weren't for the rave reviews and the fact that I was looking for a recipe that used dry, not canned, beans I don't think I would have tried this. I'm not a huge balsamic vinegar fan and adding soy sauce and sherry just seemed weird. HOWEVER, I tried it and oh my goodness it was fantastic. You can't taste the individual ingredients, but the combined flavors are just great. The only thing I changed was I used vermouth instead of the sherry. I didn't have sherry and did a web search for a substitute. I will be making this again. Don't be afraid to try it.

I make this all the time! The basic recipe is awesome, except I make one big change--instead of sour cream, I add an entire parsnip. It's super creamy and adds a slightly sweet flavor. I love sour cream and do not miss it at all! I also never have sherry or balsamic vinegar, so I just add red wine vinegar to taste. I bet plain red wine would be wonderful as well.

This is a very good recipe. I'm sure dried beans are the way to go but I was in a hurry so used 5 c of canned, 7 cups of stock (I prob. should have used only 6 c)and simmered for about 40 minutes. I reduced the soy sauce because my beans were salty even after rinsing. The celery leaves add a nice flavour and the sherry gives a wonderful depth of flavour - don't leave it out. My only complaint is the cayenne - I think half a tsp tasted harsh although it did mellow out by the next day. Next time I will either halve the amount or eliminate it and add hot sauce to taste just before serving. I see that William has published several other soup recipes, I look forward to trying them.

I made this for a Caribbean themed dinner party and it was amazing! Definitely a keeper. I used dry beans as suggested, but used vegetable broth instead of chicken because some of my guests were vegetarian. As some others suggested I only pureed half of it. I agree that it might not need two 2 cups of water - I think I'd like it to be thicker next time. Delicious though, and my guests loved it!

Really good recipe. I followed this exactly except for the 2 cups of water .... I thought I would add water if needed. when the soup was "done" I felt it needed a bit more kick so I added more cumin and a sprinkle of cayenne. It was much better (for my taste) then I added a half pound of leftover Christmas dinner smoked ham. I loved it!!!
But the original recipe was followed and I rated it based on that tasting before adding anything else.
UPDATE: 8/17/2016
I've made this several times now ......... the only thing I would modify is the amount of cayenne ....... I've gone to 1/2 tsp and that is enough!! GREAT SOUP!!!

Excellent really. Followed the recipe, minus the celery because... well it's celery. Otherwise, this has been perfect. Kept the liquid because I ate it over brown rice.

I made this exactly written except for the fact that I didn't have any sherry.  I substituted dry vermouth.  I read all the reviews and opted to keep the 2 cups of water.  I'm glad I did.  If you serve it over rice (as you would gumbo), then the extra liquid is a good thing, but we thought it was also good without any rice.  I used an immersion blender so I would still have some of the beans for texture.  The flavor is wonderful.  My husband and adult son both loved it, especially with a dollop of sour cream on top.  I will definitely make this again.  Best black bean soup I've ever had.  UPDATE:  If you use the quick-soak method for the dried black beans instead of the overnight method, the beans will be softer.  I find I prefer using dried if I have time, but 4 cans of beans work fine as well.

Absolutely delicious.  Followed recipe as written starting with dried beans.  Had to cook a little longer than stated in recipe.  I used a submersion blender to puree some but not all the beans.  Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe, William!

This is a GREAT soup recipe, and it received a lot of good comments!  Everyone I served it to really did like it a lot!  However, I did change the recipe just slightly. I added only 1 T. of balsamic vinegar because, based on other reviewer's comments, I was afraid the 2 T. vinegar would leave a strong taste.  After fixing the soup, I found it to be a little bland, so I added sugar, some salt, and some bacon pieces (which I promptly removed after a few minutes.  I only wanted a slight smoky flavoring.)

The flavor was good, but the soup was a little too thick.

The flavor of this was absolutely perfect!  Next time I make it I'm going to cut the water down a little and only puree about half to give it a little more texture.

A little too much sherry makes it too sweet. Back that off and it's very good!

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  We didn't use the soy sauce or vinegar, but we doubled the spices & it was nice & spicy.

I loved this recipe. I would give it 5 stars, except that we had mixed reviews in the family. My 3-yr-old loved it. The 5-yr-old liked it, but not enough to finish her bowl. The 7-yr-old doesn't like anything, so he doesn't count. My husband didn't like the vinegar. Maybe next time we'll try it without.

I increased this recipe to accomidate the two bags of beans (4 cups) I had to purchase.  The soup was a hit at the office party and I froze 1/4 of it for myself.  One recommendation: hold down the lid on your blender with extra strength if you are not use to using a blender...this soup is not fun to clean off the walls, floor, fridge, etc...

My husband can't stop raving about this soup.  I made mine with canned beans, but I can't wait to try it with dried beans.  It was sooooooo good!!!

We had a "tropical" dinner party and served this soup with a salad and coconut chicken.  Everyone LOVED the soup.  It was so easy to put together, too.  Just throw everything in the pan and let it cook!!  I used canned black beans instead and it made it even easier.  Yummy!

This soup is terrible!!!  I spend FOREVER making it.  The flavor is like a cheap shot.  Add sherry and cayenne to give it a kick because the soup is flavorless otherwise.  YUCK!  So not worth my time cooking it or the money I spent to make it!  PASS THIS ONE  UP!!!
