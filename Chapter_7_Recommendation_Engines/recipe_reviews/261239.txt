I whipped up a batch of this for a last minute dish to bring to work since I had all the ingredients on hand.  Very simple and quick! I found it to be a bit thin (I prefer my dips thicker) and a little strong in pumpkin flavor, so I added another half block of cream cheese. No extra sweetener needed. I then added some freshly grated nutmeg and some cloves.  Instead of these individual spices, you could just use about 2tsp of pumpkin pie spice, or more to taste.  I served these with Nilla wafers and everyone loved it!
