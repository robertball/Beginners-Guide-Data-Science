to clarify the directions...I pinch the sauages to form "small meatballs" and dropp them in the oil, cook till no longer pink... I also add some sort of small pasta. either tublini whatever is in the cabinet. I have made this a TON of times, its a quicker way to make escarole soup the "cheater" version...LOL hope you enjoy as my family did.... :o)

I omitted the tomato sauce, and added a couple of cloves of garlic to the sausage and it was so delicious - my friend and her 2 year old daughter both loved it as well. Make sure you note Melanie's added instructions to pinch the sausage into small meatballs and fry in oil, also add a small pasta (I used tubettini) towards the end of cooking.

YUMM!!!  This soup is delicious! The whole family loved it (me, hubby and a 1yr old). The only thing we did differently from the directions: The store was out of Cannellini beans (white kidney), so I got pale red kidney beans instead.

Very good! I happened to have venison sausage so I made it with that. If I was using Italian pork  sausage I probably would have omitted the olive oil.  Followed directions pretty much to a tee, except added garlic to the sausage as well as some dried red pepper flakes, black pepper, oregano, and parsley. Added a little extra broth because I threw in pasta near the end.  Definitely follow Melanie's instructions about making small meatballs out of the sausage.

I want to give this more stars!  What an amazing soup.  I like spicy foods, so I use spicy Italian sausage for the meatballs.  I also add some garlic and Italian seasoning to the meatballs.  Absolutely delicious!!!  I make it again, and again, and again!

I have been married for 30 years and this is one of the best recipes I have ever made. I pretty much followed the recipe to a 'T'.  I did add an extra box of chicken stock because I added cooked ditalini noodles to the soup which absorbs some of the broth.  I also used a big bag of fresh spinach instead of escarole...only because it is more of a preference with my family.  Other than that...wow, never made soup myself with such flavor!

Pretty good soup! I didn't use any oil, I just put some sliced up sausage in the pot with a little water to begin with. I took the advice of other reviews and added garlic. A huge elephant garlic clove, and used canned, diced tomatoes in place of tomato sauce. I also added some cayenne pepper and a little black pepper. I enjoyed it and so did my husband. I'd make it again.

SUPER EASY, SUPER YUMMY!  Will definately make this again. Unlike other soups, I didn't need to add any salt to this recipe!  I did however, add a little fresh garlic, just because I love garlic, and it was absolutely delicious!

Very good, but if you like it spicy use Mild Italian Sausage to kick it up a notch.

This was good but I felt that there was way too much sausage. If I make this again, I would definitely only use one pound of sausage and only 48 oz. of broth.

this is easy and delicious.. follow others advice and pinch sausage into balls, omit olive oil (plenty of fat in sausage), and add garlic! only other suggestion is if you can't find escarole at the store, kale works just as well! everyone loves this recipe in my house!

Delicious!  My whole family loved this!  We ate it for several meals and enjoyed it every time.  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the sauce and lentils because we did not have white beans on hand.
