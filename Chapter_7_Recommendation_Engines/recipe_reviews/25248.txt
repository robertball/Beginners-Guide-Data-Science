Two stars as written, if for no other reason than that this recipe calls for an extraordinarily large amount of lemon pepper seasoning and I knew better not to use that much. Curious, I measured it out in a prep bowl to see just how much that amount of seasoning looked like and was amazed--if I didn't know better I would think there was a misprint in the recipe. On the other hand, there is nothing extraordinary at all about green beans with butter and almonds, which would have made this only average at best, even using a more realistic measure of the lemon pepper seasoning.

I loved this dish! What a delicious and elegant recipe for company. I always use fresh green beans.... there's really no comparison to others. Adjust the lemon pepper seasoning to your own taste starting with 1 tsp.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was excellent!  As one reviewer may have said, there is nothing special about lemon pepper and almonds in green beans, but its simplicity makes it easy and delicious.  It was great to find something new and interesting to try with the extra summer green beans!  Thanks for the recipe!

Sounds too simple.  But I got raves at all my Holiday dinners for them.  The kids even had seconds (which was really weird).  Works with frozen petite beans as well as blanched fresh ones.

Very easy, quick, and tasty addition to veggies.  My 17-year old said "awesome".  I used a little less lemon pepper then called for and added regular pepper and salt.  Would be good with a number of veggies.  Next time I'm trying broccoli.

We love this recipe! So easy and quick but delicious. I only had a little over a 1/2 pound of green beans and that wasn't going to feed 6 this evening. So, I decided to add a few new red potatoes. I don't have a steamer, just put the potatoes in a bowl with a splash of water, covered with plastic wrap and microwaved until fork tender. Repeat with the green beans and proceed with the recipe, seasoning with the lemon pepper to taste. Worked out great! Everyone gave this one 5 stars. Thanks for sharing!

One of my favorite recipes.  Too spicy for kids, but perfect for adults.  Even my father-in-law, who doesn't eat ANY vegetables, ate these.  I NEVER have any leftovers.

Yum!!  These green beans were great!  I used frozen green beans and chopped my own almonds.  I am so happy to find such a simply-made, yet delicious side dish.

Very good recipe!  Baked covered with foil in oven for 30 minutes and another 15 minutes uncovered. Used half of the lemon pepper and was just right for us.

I LOVED these beans...I steamed frozen beans in the microwave for 6-7 minutes, used 1/2 cup slivered almonds, and I T. lemon juice in place of 1 tsp. of LP seasoning...Received many raves!

This is a wonderful alternative to plain green beans.  My husband loved these.  The crunchy almonds are delicious with the tangy lemon pepper.  I'll be making this again soon & plain to incorporate it into my Thanksgiving dinner.

These green beans were very enjoyable! Very simple and easy to make, and versitile enough to go along side almost any main dish. I love the combination of almonds with green beans, and I never seem to get tired of it. I consider this dish a success because my three year old son ate these first off his plate, even before the baked chicken and rice pilaf. I will make these again sometime soon because it is so easy and went over very well with my family. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us, Annette!

Yum.  Came to this website tonight to find a way to flavor up our frozen green beans.  This was on the front page.... My 11 y.o. son did most of it, the only changes we made were that we used frozen green beans, I added garlic to the butter and didn't use 2 tsps of lemon pepper...used about 1 tsp.  The whole family loved them.

Very good. Could use a little more zazz, but for a green bean side dish is my favorite find so far. Be careful not to burn your almonds!

This is a great option that allows the vegetable to shine on its own. No bacon, sausage or chicken broth added.  We serve this all the time at my guest ranch.   Browning the almonds in the butter provides great flavor. It is nice that my vegetarian customers can enjoy this great vegetable.

Recipe is quite simple to make, tastes delicious, and is very elegant.  Wonderful side dish for entertaining.  My kids liked it, (well 2 out of 3 did) although one objected to it being 'too spicy.'  However, if your kids don't like green beans, this isn't going to change their minds...

Only adjustment is that we cut the lemon pepper in half but otherwise no changes needed for us.  Highly recommend for a simple side dish that is also so easy to accomplish.

I was looking for a green bean recipe that was not the usual. I used a bag of frozen slender whole beans, steamed them and followed the recipe as stated. It was wonderful and all of my family loved them! I served them with baked ham and creamy scalloped potatoes. Just a note, 2 teaspoons was not too much lemon pepper, it was just right. Thank you for this recipe. It is a keeper.

Yum! What a pleasant surprise!! I'm trying to eat more fresh veges.....and these will stay in my recipe box.  I don't really measure anything out...just guess at what I'm throwing in...turned out great.  Oh, I did use pecans instead of almonds because that's what is always in the pantry.  My 'hon liked these too and he's not really into anything with a lot of spice. **Update***...this is my FAVORITE vege recipe!!!  I make these all the time now with the pecans instead of almonds. I can't get enough of these!!

Great recipe, I modified by adding half a clove of garlic, squeezing about a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and grinding black pepper on top. Turned out great!

Very yummy, next time I will use frozen green beans in the off season, too difficult to find good ones in the market. I read the reviews before making it and agree, too much lemon pepper, used 1 tsp instead of 2. Otherwise it was wonderful. Oh and I used slivered almonds instead of sliced.

I've made this with fresh, canned, and frozen green beans.  If you like it a little more lemony just add a tbsp. of lemon juice.  Or sometimes I add 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder.

I'm allergic to mushrooms so come Thanksgiving, I can't eat the traditional green bean casserole.  I made these last year and my family loved them.  They are a bit spicy, so adjust seasoning to taste.  Plan on making them again this year.

I made this for this first time for Thanksgiving, so I was nervous about how it would turn out!  I think it was a big hit.  The only thing I would recommend is to undercook the beans just a little bit if you are going to take them to someone else's house.  Mine were done just right, but then I transported them warm for about an hour, and then they were rewarmed in an oven for about 10 minutes.  That was enough to make the beans a little softer than I wanted.

I used canned beans, but the amount lemon pepper made these beans inedible.  It's a good idea that I might try in the future, with about 1/4 the lemon pepper.

I halved the butter and nixed the almonds. The peppper was a bit too spicey/hot for my husband (who is usually tolerant of heat) and I. May try again with less pepper.

Delicious!  I've been looking for new ways to cook green beans and this is by far the best I've tried.  Zesty and full of flavor!  A little too spicy for kids I think so maybe reduce the lemon pepper a little and add fresh lemon juice but other than that I wouldn't make any changes.

I didn't quite have a pound of beans, so I cut back on the pepper and still thought it to be overpowering. I would use much less the next time and definately Would use fresh green beans,not canned like I used. I'm sure there would be a big difference. Thanks Annette!

Amazing recipe it has a nice fresh crunch from the green beans and has a nice flavor of the lemon pepper. I only said 4 stars because it was over seasoned a little bit for me.

I think simple concoctions are the best and the lemon pepper and almonds in butter was a super combination for green beans.  To save time, I used packaged, pre-cleaned beans and microwaved them, then poured the lemon pepper combo on top and tossed it to 
combine well.  I DID have to add about 1/2 teaspoon regular salt when I did 2 small packages of beans.  Easy & quick!

4 stars only because I had to use what was on hand. 1/2 lb. green beans, 2 tblsp butter, 2 packets of True Lemon ( equal to 1 tblsp. lemon juice ), approx. 1/2 tsp. fresh ground pepper. Excellent! If you're not sure of the lemon pepper, start with a lesser amount. This was a big hit! Definitely a keeper.

This is a great spin on an old side. A great way to get some new flavor with something so overdone. Make sure you serve it while it's still hot. Really effects the taste.

I was desperate to come up with a side to do with canned green beans, I found this one and it was delicious! I'm sure it's way better with fresh green beans, but it was still really good with canned.... and easy and quick! I tried to make it healthier by using olive oil instead of butter, worked good! My 5 year old loved it!

I fixed these last night and they were great and I just love fresh green beans.  I will use half the amount of almonds because my family just had tons of almonds left on their plates.  I think they were delicious.

Really good, especially for being so simple. I doubled the recipe except that I only used about 3 tablespoon of the lemon pepper, and that was just right.

made as a side for a dinner get-together, and they were perfect.  They tasted like the green beans you get at a fancy steak restaurant, and then wonder why your green beans never taste like that- well, now I know how. HA!

I recently scored a nice batch of green beans from my local farmer's market.  I don't have a huge green bean repertoire, and I was happy to come across this recipe!  These beans were awesome!  I know some people commented that there was too much lemon pepper called for, but it was absolutely perfect for me and my crew.  Then again, I'm a huge fan of lemon pepper, so ymmv of course!  I'll be turning back to this recipe again and again for sure.  Thanks!

The green beans in the produce dept. looked like spinach, so I bought and used a "steamer" bag of green & yellow beans. Those cooked in the microwave while I prepared the almonds.  FANTASTIC flavor and super easy. I doubt I'll ever try with fresh beans as it will take more prep time. I thought the amount of lemon pepper was fine.

THANK YOU for this recipe... it is a weekly dish in our home. Because I have two under the age of three, I use McCormick lemon & herb seasoning in place of the lemon pepper. There are never leftovers and guests always ask how I did it. I thought this was a website to exchange recipes.... not only for originals but ones used everyday. Unlike other reviewers, I don't use a cookbook... this is my cookbook.

I didn't follow the recipe, just stole the idea...I used lemon juice (i just squeezed a lemon over the pan, so I guess 1 Tbsp?) and ground black pepper in place of actual lemon pepper.  But the idea came from you, and it was delicious, soo...5 stars!  Thanks Annette =)

Very good!  I only used 1 Tbsp butter and 1 1/2 tsp. lemon pepper.  Next time I might cut it back to only 1 tsp. lemon pepper.  I also used frozen green beans and they came out so tasty!

Never thought I liked lemon pepper, but now I'm obsessed with it.  This recipe was incredible.  I've cooked it for nearly everyone I know and all of them have used the recipe for their own meals.  THANKS!

How is this recipe so good?? Based on the ingredients I thought it would just be OK, but it was awesome. I made it with fresh beans and some European style butter. Just fantastic.

These green beans were very good and easy to make. I liked the addition of lemon pepper, but some of my siblings did not. These were very tasty, but not the best that I've ever had. Thanks for sharing!

Liked this recipe.  I used less lemon pepper, and added a squirt of fresh lemon and lemon zest.  Made this for Mother's day today, and it went over well.

Like other reviewers said, 2 tsp of lemon pepper seasoning may be too much! I used just 1tsp and it made for a wonderful dish! I wish I had used perfectly fresh green beans (mine had been bagged for about a week before I used 'em!) because I know it would have been even yummier had the beans been more fresh. Wonderful, simple recipe, and a great side dish to most dinners!

Very delicious! I actually cut the green beans back to a 1/2lb and added a 1/2lb of fresh asparagus to it, and used olive oil instead of butter which actually tasted better in my opinion. Very easy to make too!

This recipe lent a new flavor to an otherwise bland vegetable. I did not use seperate pans I just drain the beans and melted the butter in the same pan. Be sure to make your butter brown this is the trick to a rich flavor. I would recommend this to anyone.

My family totally loved the beans done this way. It really takes the bordem out of beans and dresses them up. I followed the recipe, but cut back on the lemon pepper to 1 tsp.and decided near the end to add chopped roasted red peppers for more colour. You can buy peppers already prepared in a jar in the grocery stores. This is a keeper.

These were a big hit with my family. Will definitely make again and I am not a green bean person.

Udpate: I've been making these for a year now and can't get enough. They are healthy and the only way to get my boyfriend to eat green beans.

Yummy...it's so nice to find a recipe that is really tasty and really easy to prepare.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I toasted the almonds in the butter for a bit before adding the green beans.  the only other point worth mentioning is that the recipe calls to steam the green beans for 10 minues which, IMHO is too long.  I'll definitely make this again - thanks for a great recipe.

I've come to realize that it pretty much doesn't matter HOW I cook green beans...if they're on the table, my daughter will devour them and give me praise!! I personally thought they were okay, my boyfriend seemed to like them and my daughter thought they were outta this world. In fact, she ate so many, there's none left for my roommate! I used fresh green beans and reduced the lemon pepper to 1 1/2 tsp.  Would make again for my daughter and boyfriend! Thanks Annette!

Liked it.  I made it with steam bag green beans so all I prepared was the butter and then tossed it.  A nice dress up for the usual plain steamed green beans so I'd make it again.  I had thought it would be salty so I cooked more beans so it wasn't so concentrated, and I needed more for my guests anyway.

I made the recipe exactly as it is, and it was great! I used the required amount of lemon pepper salt, and it was way too salty. I had an extra bag of frozen green beans on hand, so I added them to it and it made it a lot better. Instead of steaming, next time I'll just use steam in a bag beans, much easier. But great recipe overall, definitely will make again.

This is very good and has a brightness different than regular steamed beans. I keep toasted nuts in the freezer so when the beans are done, I drain them taking the steamer out, put them back in the pot, toss in the butter, lemon pepper and almonds, replace the top on the pot and shake very gently to mix. Easy, peasy!

This was very good!  My hubby even commented on the green beans specifically and he rarely does that.  No nuts as I didn't have any and I added some sliced shallots.  Excellent!

Bf opened a monster sized can of green beans, so I needed some recipes to use them up.  This one worked to use up a bit of it.  I would definitely prefer this with fresh, but beggars can't be choosers.  I didn't use as much lemon pepper as called for; I think would've been too much.  I just did to taste, adn it worked perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe.

While my husband said these were the best green beans he'd ever had, when I asked him what he liked best about them, he said that he liked them better than usual simply because they were not plain. I found them much too peppery (the lemon pepper completely overwhelmed the almonds), and my children - who love plain green beans - disliked them as well. I might try to make them again with less lemon pepper than called for in the recipe.

These have a lot of flavor and they only take minutes to make.  I left out the almonds because I don't like them and cut the lemon pepper in half because it was a little strong.

Enjoyed the recipe, but would start with 1 tsp lemon pepper seasoning and adjust to your own taste preference. Also, I use salt free lemon pepper season and simply add salt to taste -- easier to control salt content this way.

This is such an easy, quick and tasty dish. Being a full time grad student with a full time job, it takes minutes to prepare this dish!
I boiled the beans instead of steaming them and it turned out great!
I added extra lemon pepper to add to the zest a bit :) 
Also, a variation might be to add some garlic...have'nt trie di, but of someone does, lemme know how it was...

These were decent, but I am not a huge fan of lemon pepper, and I used walnuts since I did not have any almonds, but the taste was rather bland.

Really simple and tasty dish. I was lazy and used olive oil and sauteed all the ingredients in a skillet - cooking the beans first, and giving enough time so that the almonds could toast without burning afterwards then adding lemon pepper.  The almonds really give a nice flavour!!

I'm not much of a cook, so I'm always looking for simple recipes.  A nice, tangy recipe that is a favorite at family get-togethers.  If the seasoning or almonds are not a favorite I would think you could easily substitute your favorites.

Sorry, but we didn't care much for these.  We all thought they were kind of bland.  For one thing, to us, 10 minutes is too long to steam them.  We prefer a little crisper, fresher texture.  We also thought it was lacking any complex, complimentary flavors, and that the pepper - the only thing we tasted - was overpowering.  Maybe if I had cut back the pepper significantly and added garlic, maybe a squeeze of fresh lemon, etc. we probably would have enjoyed them more.  Thanks anyway.

Hey, these were pretty good. Very interesting flavor. It definitely works! I used a frozen green/wax bean blend and toasted chopped pecan pieces since we didn't have almonds on hand... my hubby and I both liked this.

I cut back on the lemon pepper seasoning as I find it very overpowering.  Other than that, great side dish, and easy too.

Too much lemon pepper seasoning for only 1 lb of green beans. Would have been better with real lemon juice.

I've used canned green beans in this recipe, as well as fresh---both ways are very good.  What a great way to "dress up" green beans with ingredients I always have on hand.

I am giving this a 5 star because I ended up using "canned" green beans and the butter, almonds and lemon pepper made them quite edible!!!  Looking forward to using fresh green beans the next time.

I used canned green beans, but fresh would probably be even better for this recipe. Served this for company the first time I made it and it was a big hit! My husband even ate the leftovers out of the fridge, cold! Great spice & crunch.

Yumm.  I really like this dish.  It's easy to make and adds zest to any meal.  Yet not so much zest that my husband who doesn't care for spicy food won't eat it.  I lessen the amount of lemon-pepper some, because I can always add more.

Very easy, very tasty.  Used frozen and tasted nearly as good as fresh. Would cut down on the lemon pepper and butter slightly next time.  Also, my first round of browning the almonds didn't go so well.  Got caught up basting my ham and ended up with blackened almonds instead!

Perfect as written (except to reduce the lemon pepper to your liking) for an everyday meal.  I made this for a Thanksgiving meal, and it was very well received.  I did reduce the amount of lemon pepper, as recommended by several other reviewers.  I also added some diced pork belly (or you could use bacon), which I seasoned with lemon pepper before roasting to add to the lemony flavor.  Delicious and special enough for a holiday meal!

We thought this was very good and easy. Took another reviewers advice and started with one teaspoon lemon pepper and then added more as I tasted the beans.

Usually don’t.Like green beans but this recipe was amazing I added 1 teaspoon of lemon pepper and a half instead of the full two because the full two would’ve Been Way too much for me and my family’s flavor this is a great beginner recipe it’s so easy and quick I paired it with Mexican  Rice and some Mexican chicken and the flavors paired well together I feel like I would make this again. Definitely a signature dish for me now.

Last review didn’t take for some reason.  So, been making this for a while (years).  Our now 10 year old asks for this specifically. A couple tips/shortcuts: 1) you can substitute 1 tbsp olive oil for 1 tbsp butter to make it a bit healthier.  2) if you don’t have all the pans & steamers, try cooking the green beans in your microwave using its vegetable cook setting (about 10 min total, stirring occasionally, on high give or take strength of tour microwave). Then transfer to almond mixture.

This very simple recipe makes green beans more flavorful! Excellent choice for stubborn kids! Be generous with the lemon pepper, you'll need a lot if your goal is to suppress the natural flavor of the green beans. This recipe is saved and is one of my new favorites!

This recipe is very good I added some coarse salt and it looked and tasted delicious! Now my actual twist was cooking the green beans for only 3 minutes in water and then finishing the cooking process by adding them to the butter and almonds.  This renders crispy green beans. My lemon pepper had too much pepper so I had to use 1/4 of the portion that the recipe calls for. Next time, I might toast the almonds separately and just sauté the green beans in the butter. It is a slight modification in the procedure, but I like the contrast of toasted nuts with boiled/sautéed veggies.

Easy and delicious! We are doing Whole 30 so I used ghee in place of the regular butter. I also used Trader Joe's frozen whole green beans, tripled the recipe and took it to an Easter potluck. Everyone loved it. I'm adding this to my regular rotation!

This definitely gives green beans more flavor. However after adding a tsp of lemon pepper.. I decided to hold off on the second teaspoon because it seemed like a huge amount. I'm glad I did. It was very peppery and full of of flavor. It would have been way too overpowering had I used the full amount.

Not a big fan of the green bean which is why I searched for a good recipe. This one ROCKS. I've made it several times. I do use a little less lemon pepper then is called for and only fresh beans. Love it. Thank you.

Wow, these were entirely flavorless.  A complete disaster when I brought them to a party.  The only reason I'm not giving it a 1-star review is that my lemon pepper blend has no salt in it, but several others do.   I added plenty of salt, but it wasn't enough to rescue it.  I sauteed the leftovers with soy sauce, garlic, ginger, hot pepper oil and they came out pretty good.

I really loved this dish.  I am always looking for ways to fancy up my veggies that aren't too labor intensive.  This was perfect!  I had some fresh French green beans that I needed to use up and already had all the ingredients and it was a hit.  I adjusted the lemon pepper seasoning to my taste (only about 1 tsp) so as not to overpower the other parts of the meal.

The only thing I did to the recipe was decrease the amount of servings as there was only the two of us.  My husband and I liked the dish.  Green beans being one of my favourite vegetables is was great to find a way of serving them differently yet deliciously.  We are a lover of the lemon pepper as it is something we use when cooking fish.
Will make again, maybe even for dinner guests

We enjoyed this green bean recipe for Thanksgiving dinner.  We're always searching for a new way to prepare vegetables.  This is a quick and tasty recipe and we had the ingredients on hand.

I have also used garlic pepper with the almonds which my family somewhat prefers.

This recipe is fantastic!  It has the two things that make a true 5 star recipe.  It's simple (only 4 ingredients) and it tastes great!  Make sure to use fresh green beans from your own garden or a farmer's market...we have had bad luck with some store bought beans this year.

This was a great recipe for regular green beans. Made it as written and everyone liked it but thought next time I should reduce the lemon pepper. Will definitely Make again! Thanks!

I'd recomend this side dish to accompany a light main dish such as steamed fish or poultry. It can be quite buttery and rich.

These were very tasty.  A couple of my family members weren't crazy about the almonds, but most liked them.

I cut back on the lemon pepper quite a bit, just sprinkling it over the beans; next time, I'd have a little more courage and use a little more.  The toasted almonds were FABulous!  Used the first of the harvest of green beans from our garden so it was a special dish for us.  Very good.  Thank you!

Excellent! The lemon was a surprisingly nice flavor and the pepper was just to hubby's liking (he LOVES black pepper!). I used slivered blanched almonds, a little more than the recipe called for, and cooked them to a nice golden brown. Yummy!

Works well with fresh or frozen green beans.  Not as good as leftovers because the almonds get soggy.

Very flavorful. The great taste of green breans with the slightly spicy flavor of the lemon pepper.  You could also fix this without the almonds.

Very good recipe.  I grew up eating green beans with cut up bacon.  This was a very nice change!!
