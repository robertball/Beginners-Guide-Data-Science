First time trying goat, it is quite good and was very tender cooked this way. The reduction also makes a very good gravy with just some milk and flour added.

I'm not really sure if my version counts as made it... I found that I did not have a few key ingredients such as preserved lemons or pitted prunes. So i substituted the lemons for 2 tablespoons of  lemon juice; the prunes for 2 small plums and 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar. I added a 1/2 tsp of ground ginger, and about a 1/4 cup of chopped parsley. I also added 1.5 tablespoons of rice vinegar to replace the wine. I cooked for 2 hours in a tagine(Dutch oven should be fine too). Results were delicious!!
