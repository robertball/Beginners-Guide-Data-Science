Holy Cow!!! This was amazing!  I am so happy to have found this recipe because it really is authentic tasting.  I will probably increase the spice by 1/2 next time, because I want even more of that indian flavor.  Thank you so much.

Really great and flavorful, easy peasy to make. Very runny, though. Next time I'll simmer longer and add some flour.

Pretty good and easy base recipe.  I did, however, find it necessary to increase the spice amounts and added 1 tsp. Madras curry powder and some cayenne pepper to kick it up as I like my curries fairly spicy.  I found the sauce to be a bit thin so I thickened it up by using a cornstarch slurry.  After making these adjustments, this curry turned out great.  Will be making it again and perhaps next time will add a few vegetables to the mixture.  I served this for dinner last night over basmati rice and with store-bought naan which I brushed with melted butter, sprinkled with minced garlic and baked on a sheet pan for 4 min. at 400 degrees.  The only thing I wish I had to go with this meal was some mint chutney, which I will be sure to have next time I serve this.

absolutely fantastic flavor.  I made it vegetarian by sauteing 2 cups of mushrooms with the onions, then adding 1 cup frozen green peas at the point where you would add shrimp.  I also wanted a sweeter flavor and used a can of stewed tomatoes that I chopped up. Served it over rice and it was scrumptious.  For an elegant look you can press a serving of rice into a small rounded bowl and then "flip " the bowl to empty it intact onto your serving dish Then ladle the curry mix around the rice, and adorn the rice mound with a piece of cilantro... gorgeous.

I just made this as part of a big Indian meal with several dishes and it was a hit! The only changes I made were that I used chopped fresh tomatoes and I added a chopped serano pepper because we like heat. Also I use 2 lbs of raw peeled shrimp. It cooks in the sauce in about 5 minutes. I think cooked shrimp would be too tough and not take on the flavor of all the spices as much.

Very good.  I cut the fat down to about 14g per serving by using only 1 tbsp oil and substituting light coconut milk.  I used fresh ginger and added about a tsp red curry paste for some extra spice.  

I did have to add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit.  Just mix water and cornstarch in a bowl before adding to avoid lumps.  Crushed cashews or pistachios would be an excellent thickener as well, but I was trying to keep fat low.

I followed the recipe to the letter and wouldn't change a thing.  My husband and I both loved it - very "authentic" tasting.  I served with white rice and a traditional salad and it was perfect.  Thank you!

This recipe was good but not one I would make again as is.  Needs some items added to it.  My husband said it didn't taste like something he would eat at an Indian restaurant as all the Indian food he's had is pretty spicy and this was not.   We ended up adding some curry and cayenne pepper.  Overall, it wasn't as sweet as I thought it might be but definitely tasted good on some naan bread.

This is a wonderful recipe for Indian curry! I love the flavor of all the spices. I do like my curry a bit hotter though, so next time I would spice it up with the addition of red pepper flakes or red curry paste. This was so delicious though & I will be making it again for sure!

It doesn't look like the picture, but it was DELICIOUS!! I added a tsp and a half of sugar and a pinch of curry. I also cooked the shrimp when I put the  coconut (lite) milk in. SO good!

Having never tried Indian cooking before, this practically perfect recipe provided a fun, easy way to start.  We felt like we got to go on a little trip to an exotic place for supper.  After simmering for 10 min., the mixture was still a little thin, so I added about a tsp. of cornstarch dissolved in a tbsp. of cold water.  My whole family, including my 12-month-old enjoyed this.

This was really yummy!  I used sesame oil instead of peanut oil, but that was the only difference.  We'll be making this one again!

Very good!.. We love shrimp and curry flavors.... I did use curry powder and omitted the cumin and paprika.  Added a few diced hot chilis with my tomatoes and simmered a little bit before adding the coconut milk; I used powder ginger (few dashes).  I served it with coconut/lime rice and sprinkled toasted coconut on top! :)

This dish was very easy to make. After all was said and done, the dish was very bland. I was able to save it however, by adding curry powder, cayenne pepper, red curry paste, and some more salt and cumin.

Fabulous recipe.  We went seafood overload and put in 1 lb shrimp, 1 lb mussels, canned clams and lump crab meat.  We also added a can of peas and it turned out delicious.  The turmeric was key in the flavor.  We didn't have paprika on hand and also used shallots instead of onions.  This dish is excellent mixed with basmati rice.  The leftovers the next day is even better than made fresh!  Enjoy.

I found this to be really "mild" flavored. I ended up adding sugar and curry powder, as well as red pepper flakes. It was very good, and I think the combination of turmeric and cumin added this depth of flavor that you might not get with straight curry powder. The sauce is a little thin, but I served it over rice in large flat bowls and no one seemed to mind.

I made this dish today for my son's Name Day and it was wonderful. I followed the recipe and it came  out really good. The only changes I made were,  I used olive oil, since I did not have any peanut oil and I used raw shrimp which I saute for 2-3 minutes before adding to the sauce. A great recipe that I will make again and again, thank you.

A hit!!! Great flavors. I didn't use the tomatoes because my youngest hates them....instead I used some chicken broth and also fresh ginger. At first they thought that it looked "to yellow" (turmeric), but after the first bite, they were hooked. Served it with Jasmine rice...our favorite.

Great recipe! I love indian food but lack many of the real recipes, so this was a convenient compromise. The first time I made it was the best where I actually measured exactly all the spices. Now I improvise and its still great. I use olive oil and it still comes out great. Definitely try it!

I was really worried since I realized last minute that I was out of onions and I know how dramatically they can impact flavor. I just went ahead with the recipe anyway and used the mexican diced tomatoes with green chiles that I had in the cupboard instead of plain diced tomatoes. I think the chiles added a bit of extra kick and the dish is so flavorful overall that I ended up not missing the onions. I also added in fresh green peppers to get some veggies in. Love this recipe and will definitely be doing it again!

Sensational recipe!  The spice mix on this is just perfect, I did add a 1/2 teasppon of hot curry powder for a little heat in addition to the published spices.  I also vegged it up with some added red pepper, sweet peas, and shredded carrot.  Loved this, a new AR fave!  Thanks for sharing this outstanding curry recipe with AR.

Wow! This is so delicious! The only difference I made was add 2-3 tsp of curry! Yum :)

I use this with chicken rather than shrimp.  Let the sauce reduce down so it thickens, then serve over rice.  Love it!

I made this Indian curry yesterday and it was awesome.
I used jumbo shrimp instead,the coconut gave it a creamy taste i added more paprika and it smoothed out the creamy taste,it was perfect.

The flavor was good, but there was way too much sauce.  So much that it was almost a soup!  I would half the coconut milk on the next try.  I also upped the chili powder to give it more kick.  Served over jasmine rice, yum!

Easy and delicious.  I subbed olive oil for peanut oil and used frozen cubes of cilantro instead of fresh and it tasted great. I also added a handful of toasted pistachios which added a nice nutty crunch.

Delicious and easy. Unfortunately, we're at the cottage and I didn't have any cilantro - otherwise I'm sure it would have been a 5.

We loved it, nice, easy and tasty! The only thing it's very mild - for me that was great, for my husband - a lot of extra spices were added : tabasco and black pepper. We both loved it, and will be doing this again with basmati rice soon (as we did now, plus adding a little spice to it such as few drops of tabasco sauce or curry powder). Thanks for sharing this with us - this one is a keeper!!!!!

Made this tonight and really enjoyed it! I did not make any changes except for using vegetable oil (no peanut oil) and EZ peel shrimp rather than cooked shrimp. Simmered about twenty minutes to thicken it up and it was perfect! Thanks.

Was great.  I first cooked shrimp in peanut oil and then followed recipe.  I used a small red onion.  I also substituted fresh cilantro for fresh parsley and ground coriander as I had no cilantro around.  Came out great.

I made this wonderful dish last night. I read a few of the reviews and I did change a few things. I increased all the spices!  I also added a tablespoon of sugar, some diced green peppers, a tablespoon of Indian Curry and a little fresh ginger.  I only had a can of Fire Roasted Garlic Diced Tomatoes so I used it. I did not find the need to add anything to make it thicker as mine was thick enough!! I made with it Coconut Jasmine Rice with Gandules. I liked the idea of putting it in a little bowl and turning upside down in the middle of plate  with curry ladled around it!!!  Needless to say, This dish was a hit!!! I will surely make it again!!!

NOTE: I noticed at the end of the directions, it says to add fresh cilantro and dried cilantro, but since dried cilantro was not listed in the ingredients, I did not use that.

Made it as is.  I really wanted more warmth and a bit of heat. It made a sauce, which should have been thicker,  that ran rather bland. Might try kicking up the spices next time.  Disappointed.

Prepared an enormous amount of this for a dinner party around Christmas.  They simply loved it.  I substituted the shrimp with chicken.  My family has been requesting it since that night, so I made it again for dinner tonight with the Indian Chipati Bread by INSHA87.  This dish is spectacular.  Thanks for sharing it.  YUM!!! YUM!! YUM!!!

Very good - quick and easy! It didn't have much heat.  It was fine for me but my husband likes it spicy. Would add some jalapenos next time - to the whole thing or to individual servings, to spice it up a little more.

Love it.  Reminds me of the authentic dishes I ate in Mumbai.  Not to complicated to prepare and utterly delicious.  Make sure you use coconut milk that is high in fat or you will loose some of the beauty of this dish.  I usually serve with basmati rice.

This was very good.  I used 1 TB of olive oil and 2 TB butter and used raw shrimp which I cooked in the oil/butter with all the spices.  I used 1 T of all spices and added 1T of curry.  I used 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes in juice with green chilies and then poured heavy cream into half the empty can (NO coconut milk).  I put the cream and tomatoes in the blender and then added it to the shrimp skillet.  The sauce was not too runny.  I served this over linguine.

One of the best dishes ever! Even my 3 year old loved it. Served it over angel hair pasta.  A lot of the other reviews said that it was too watery so I didn't put the juice from the canned tomatoes in the sauce.  Perfect!  I also added a little bit more of each spice.

Very delicious recipe with an authentic-tasting curry.  I did add a little more salt than the recipe called for, as well as added a few teaspoons of diced fresh garlic.  I also added a couple dashes of curry powder and it instantly transformed the taste, bringing to light the curry flavor I enjoy at my favorite Indian restaurants.  Simply delish!

Absolutely fabulous!  Better than the gourmet Indian restaurant here in town.  I could not stop from dipping into the leftover sauce.  It's addicting.  Make or buy some Naan for getting every bit of sauce from the plate.  It's quite spicy & bursting with flavor, the coconut milk softens the spicyness.  It's mildly hot and definitely has a hotness you can taste.  I like moderately hot and this was perfect.  Tumeric is one of the best anti-cancer spices you can eat too, added bonus.

This is an easy, delicious recipe. I only added a bag of frozen California medley vegetables. Next time I will try it vegetarian with chickpeas instead of shrimp. I think regular peas would be good in this too. My husband and I were going to have Indian delivered on Valentine's Day, but now, I have decided to make this and the day before stop at an Indian restaurant and pick up some naan and reheat it for our dinner.
My 6 and 10 year old kids even liked this. DH and I added hot sauce to our plate since this is so mild. If you like it hotter add crushed pepper or hot sauce.

Great recipe! I didn't use the cilantro but I didn't particularly miss it. Also, I used vegetable oil because I didn't have peanut oil. I also added some chopped bell peppers and mushrooms to make it a bit more chunky. It was a bit watery, though, so next time I'm gonna add some starching agent... like potatoes!

I loved this!  I was quick and easy.  I was missing the coconut milk, so I substituted coconut ice cream with regular 1% milk.  The slight sweetness added to the flavor, but I would obviously have preffered the milk without the sugar.  I'll try this one again!  Thanks!

This was OK but I think it could have used more spices.  I even increased the spices 1.5 times but still found it rather bland.  So did my family.

For better taste, use a regular fat coconut milk, not the light one.

Really good, but I couldn't figure out why you have a curry without curry powder. Perhaps the spices used combined equal what curry powder is.  At any rate, I did add a teaspoon of curry powder and substituted fresh grated ginger and fresh  parsley for cilantro which I did not have. This was a quick and easy Indian inspired dish which I would make again.

Great recipe! I think adding spices to the shrimp in the beginning will help with flavor as I have noticed with other Indian recipes.  I did add dash of curry and 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes.

It was wonderful! It had a great deal of flavor. We used frozen already cooked shrimp. We thawed them out and when we added them to the sauce, we Just cooked the shrimp got a much shorter  time.

Although the flavour was good, one reviewer described it as subtle, my family of 6 found the taste “too mild.”  We would make it again but would kick up the heat zone...

This was so good! I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and added extra of each spice, and also added curry and lots of red pepper. I like a lot of heat, but nothing too spicy. It was good the first night, but I just had the last of the leftovers for lunch and it was even better. I served it with jasmine rice. You won’t be disappointed!

This was delicious! I doubled the recipe- especially the spices, and added diced potatoes and a teaspoon of Garam Masala. I didn't have the correct chili powder so I just used cayenne pepper. We love garlic so I used about 6 cloves. Served it over rice....it was a hit!

Made this pretty much to the T.  I think I used the right red pepper as its not the usual chili powder I use.  It was just ok to me, but my husband really liked it.  There was just no wow factor for me.  Not terrible, but just ok.  Maybe the left overs will be better today as sometimes that happens.

The only change I made to the recipe was that I used canola oil in lieu of peanut oil, just because I didn't have any and didn't want to buy a whole bottle just for this.

The recipe was easy enough to follow, no problems there. 

The sauce seemed just a bit thin to me, but the flavors were interesting. We liked it, but  didn't love it. I'm not sure if we will make it again. I'll save the recipe and we'll see!

Thanks for sharing!

Great easy recipe.  I made the mistake of cooking my raw shrimp in the sauce, which made the sauce even thinner.  Cornstarch fixed it though.   I used fresh tomatoes and added fresh peas for some extra veggie.  Will definitely make again.

I added tomatoes and thyme. Eyeballed my curry and red pepper dose for a bit extra. Felt the recipe lacked a kick without more added.

This turned out phenomenally - I added chopped carrots and bell peppers for some more veggies. I also used fresh ginger and added a little fresh lime juice at the end to finish it off. Simmered for an additional 10 minutes to really meld the flavors and served over riced cauliflower - absolutely delicious!

I didn’t have canned coconut milk so I used coconut yogurt which made it too tangy. So I added a tablespoon of curry powder to offset the tang. I also used stewed tomatoes and some corn starch to thicken it up. Very good base recipe.

I made this in an attempt to approximate Goan shrimp curry we had at a Michelin starred Indian restaurant in Europe.  (One of the BEST FOODS I have ever eaten!!) It needs twice the ginger and about 1T sugar to really bring out the curry flavor.  Might cut the tomato amount to half next time.  Very good, just not perfect!!

made this using cod instead of shrimp.  felt like it was missing just a little something.  can't put my finger on it.  i saved half of the sauce before putting in the cod, so i will tinker with that.

This has become the new favorite for our family. Delicious and layered flavors. Only two changes in my version. I used about an 1.5” of minced fresh ginger and Korean red pepper powder. (Left over from my Kimchee batch). Please post more easy Indian dishes.

I made this dish.  It was excellent.  I used fresh ginger instead of ground.  I thoroughly drained a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and did make add a little cornstarch to thicken.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Oh what flavor and color this dish has!  I knew my eaters were going to want a more spicier sauce so I added 2 Tablespoons of  Thai Red Curry Paste and used Hot chili powder.  Also, used raw Large shrimp.  Added them after the sauce had simmered for 5 minutes, added shrimp, finished simmering for 5 more minutes.  The shrimp were done to perfection.  The level of 'heat' was perfect for us.  Just enough to know it's there, not enough to make your eyes water.

I love this recipe. I’ve made it a couple of times and agree with another reviewer that you should increase the spice 1/2 more than listed. Also serve with lime wedges to garnish or add to the recipe before serving.

This was soooo delicious.  I didn't have the cilantro, cumin, paprika, or cayenne (I don't like spicy) but it still tasted amazing.  I subbed olive oil for peanut oil and added a touch of curry powder.  I threw over salad greens instead of rice (for a cleanse I'm doing).  I had extra curry that I used in a salad for lunch the next day.  I added some roasted veggies and almonds- SO GOOD.  

Next time I'll make sure to get the ingredients I didn't have to make it as written... except the cayenne :D

I made this for a missionary and he loved it. He stated in his home country it has more spice (heat). He had seconds! I didn’t know his favorite dish is shrimp.

This recipe is simple to make and the results are great. The curry had a buttery quality to it and is fantastic over rice. I used raw shrimp and just par cooked them prior to the onions and added towards the end of simmer. They were tender and worked out well. Definitely a keeper recipe! Cayenne seems like a good replacement to indian chili powder and provided a mild spice but not overpowering and kept the dish seasoning balanced. Wife could only add “mmmmmmmmm” when asked for opinion. The second plate she made says it all :)

This recipe was excellent.  I dialed back the spices for the non-spicy folks in our group and it still tasted amazing.  It was very easy to make and used raw shrimp and let them slowly cook in the sauce while it simmered - made them nice and plump and tender. Served with Brown Jasmine rice, Butter Portobello (instead of butter chicken), Veg Biryani, Veg Samosas, Chana Masala, Naan & Raita.  Leftovers were awesome the next day. A new staple when we do Indian food for dinner.  Am also going to try Portobello Curry (instead of shrimp for the heck of it).

This is a quick and easy meal to make.  The only changes I made were I used coconut oil instead of peanut oil and used cream coconut and a touch of coconut yoghurt  instead of coconut milk. My husband loved it, I will certainly make again

It was good but not amazing. I found it lacked flavour so ended up doubling the spices and added some cornstarch to thicken it. I added pan fried tofu (pan friend in 1 tbsp peanut oil separately), sliced red pepper, 2 russet potatoes (cooked separately), 1 cup green peas, and pineapple chunks (drained from 1 can). For acidity added lime juice.

Super easy and very flavorful.  I’m not a fan of spicy foods, so I went easy on the red chili powder, and my husband added his own tabasco sauce, but we loved this dish.

This was okay, but it definitely needed some extra spice. It was much better when I added curry powder and Sriracha. I like my Indian/Thai spicey, so I added way more seasoning than the dish called for. Also, I didn't love how chunky the tomatoes were. Next time I will get crushed tomatoes. Overall it just needed some adjustments.

Love the flavour combination.
My only deviations were that I used raw shrimp,(takes mere minutes longer,) added curry and a tiny bit of flour at the end, (to thicken sauce. )

We WILL be making this again.

I thought it was lacking "something" in the end. So I ended up adding 1 TB of yellow curry paste and a half a can of pineapple and turned it into something else altogether.

I think it's a good starting point, but after following the directions exactly it didn't have a whole lot of flavor. Still learning Indian cuisine though.

This recipe was a hit with the family. I added 1 can of Kidney beans and did not add cilantro. My son who usually complains about anything curry, gave it a 4/5. The rest of us gave it 5/5.

Several of the other reviews here say that the dish isn't particularly authentic or that it's exactly what they wanted. I'd like to point on that I feel this recipe errs on the side of caution. Rather than having a distinctive flavor (salty, spicy, sour, sweet, etc.) it simply puts forth the core ingredients one would expect in a dish that's considered 'Indian'. Having made it, I would say that this dish, although 'Indian'-tasting, isn't something that I would consider complete. It hasn't got its own decisive flavor. It needs something extra - whatever direction you choose to take it in (spicy, sweet, etc.) - find some appropriate ingredients and add them. For me, I added a lot more Korean powdered red pepper because I wanted it to have a bit of kick.

It was very tasty. Followed the recipe, but added about 2 t. curry powder, and it was very mild. We like spicy food, so next time will add more of each spice and more salt to the sauce. Used my Costco frozen jumbo shrimp, thawed ahead of time. Will make again, for sure.

This is a good basic recipe for curry shrimp.  It was my first time using cumin, paprika, and turmeric instead of just using a curry spice blend.  I added diced carrots and yellow pepper because I didn't want to serve it over rice to reduce total carbs.  Seasoning based on recipe had very little heat so I added roasted red pepper flakes and two teaspoons of  curry powder.  I made 8 servings.  My wife and daughter and I liked it a lot and I'm sure I'll use it again.

Really good results, used heaping teaspoon/tablespoon measurements in case the spicing was weak and it turned out better than expected.  Will definitely make again.

Good, but a bit runny and bland.  Next time I would thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch and add some cayenne to give it more heat.  I served over rice noodles.

I didn't have turmeric or Indian chili pepper, so I just used yellow curry (which is turmeric & chili pepper). For personal preference I used 1.5 x the spices & added some veggies. I also drained the tomatoes, so it wasn't watery. This is super delicious!  My 1-yr-old and a 3-yr-old loved it. I already look forward to the next time I make it.

I used precooked shrimp and that was a mistake. There's nothing subtle  about the flavors, its too much. My throat swelled up. Not going to make this one again.

Subtle was the correct word when this is prepared according to instructions.  I like just a little more flavor and I'm just discovering a red pepper mixture called harissa.  So, I did add a little (maybe a 1/2 tsp) to the sauce after I tasted it.  Also, I used a low fat (Trader Joe's) coconut milk, and next time I may go for the richer stuff.  Super good.  Lots of things I could have added (chickpeas!).  Will play with this recipe!

Ok not so sure what all the discussion was to not add curry powder if you didn't have fresh but if you do it conservatively it works. Also added turmeric which really added an intense color and acted like a thread through the curry, garlic and ginger. Also did not have coriander, garlic / ginger paste on hand - improvised with olive oil and made the garlic / ginger paste 2:1 *side note, this is now a staple in my bag of tricks - what an amazing flavor! Used pure olive oil - large Spanish onion coarse to fine chop - the onion alone and this sauce is an amazing condiment for anything! Used frozen shrimp which did impact my water content - if you go this route add water last and if needed at all - if you go fresh def. add the water. Let the sauce reduce in its own - don't rush it - watch the shrimp once in and take care to remove from heat one you see evident color change on majority - keep it covered and let it do the rest of the cooking in its own. Prep with quick thaw of shrimp 30 mins - cook 30 mins - you can cut this by 20 mins if you use fresh shrimp. Definitely do this one! Will post again when I can follow the rules...! Enjoy!!!

Authentic Taste if you make the recipe "as is". If you are looking for an "American" Indian taste, then you won't like it. This is hot and spicy. I used basmati rice and it really went well with the spices. This is quick and easy, and is something I will make again.

Quick, simple and absolutely delicious.  I didn't have peanut oil so substituted with vegetable ghee.  It was very mild in flavor so next time I will definitely increase the chili powder content.  Cannot wait to make this again.

I wanted to make a curry dish for my adult son visiting for the holiday. He loves a variety of curry dishes from authentic Indian and Thai restaurants. I decided to omit the tomatoes and used  a sliced green pepper, and red pepper. We both felt this was the best choice. Even then, although the dish was good, as others have stated, we felt it was bland. It really needed more flavor. After the first bite, everyone added some curry spice that I had in my pantry. That helped improve the flavor. I will make this again but will also add prepared curry when cooking.

Used lite coconut milk, a little thinner but good. Tripled the cilantro, but I like cilantro . Used raw shrimp and let them simmer till done. May take a little longer, but both get better flavor.

Read other reviews before cooking and doubled the spices...and then some.  We love curry!  Added more while cooking.  I found myself adding salt and black pepper when I sat down to eat.  Not sure if I'll make again, to be honest.  The coconut milk really bumps up the fat.  Have made other shrimp curries without the milk and preferred the taste.  This was super fast to make, on the plus side - Also, my husband gives this a 5 :)

I made this for a new lover and it was a huge hit! I made only one change, using uncooked shrimp which cooked in the sauce in 5 minutes. I would most definitely make this again. Delicious!!

Used all the ingredients in the recipe & combined the other ingredients called for in another recipe on this site called, "The best Thai coconut soup". I used 2 lbs. of shrimp, one can of diced tomatoes, one can of chicken broth plus 1 can of lite coconut milk. I simmered everything for an hour stirring occasionally. I did not have turmeric & used fresh minced ginger. For the leftovers, I added more curry paste, garlic chili paste & cayenne pepper to kick it up. To thicken I made a slurry of 1/4 cup water mixed with 1 1/2 TBSPS. cornstarch to create a thicker than soup texture we wanted. Also, added a bag of snow peas (steamed in the microwave for 3 min. & cut in 1/2) the last 5 min. & served with jasmine rice & crispy buttered Naan bread. I'm sure had I not done anything to change this recipe, it would still be delicious.

Indian flavor was great, but like other reviews said, I should've doubled the spices. I used raw shrimp and cooked it with the garlic and spices.  The shrimp flavor is much more distinct this way than buying already cooked shrimp. It was also a little watery.  Next time I'd strain the tomatoes and use more cornstarch to thicken. I will definitely make again!  As good as take out!

We thought this was better half an hour later after the flavors melded. A bag of frozen and thawed green peas added at the same time as the shrimp was a delicious and healthy adjustment.

This was easy to make. I recommend tasting sauce a few times as it cooks. I added a bit more ginger. Also I used Coconut cream since I had it in house- used it half and half with water. worked well.

Very mild curry, but flavorful.  Used canned tomatoes; be sure to drain them before adding to curry.

There is very little about this recipe that is INDIAN so I don't understand why people call it authentic.  It  has absolutely no heat - even with the addition of curry powder. To me, it tastes much more like a Thai dish.  And like other reviewers, I found the sauce too thin. If I were to make it again, I would add cayenne pepper and only use the solidified cream at the top of the can of coconut milk. This would make the sauce thicker and richer.  It was very tasty though - and looked very  pretty on the plate.

This was very good.  I was surprised that there was no curry powder in the recipe it still tasted great. I increased the spice a little by adding a touch more cumin I also doubled the garlic and I sauteed the fresh shrimp ( tailed and deveined)  with garlic powder and a sprinkle of Adobo then I added the shrimp and took it off the heat.

This was a fantabulous recipe! My husband and I love Indian food, and this tasted as an authentic Indian restaurant entree. It was so quick to make too! As other reviewers, we made a corn starch slurry at the end to add to the sauce, to thicken it. Along with the other spices, we added a teaspoon of additional curry seasoning, and 1/2 tsp or so of red pepper flakes. Next time I will even add more. It did add some spice with the 1/2 tsp but not enough for our taste. Served it with Basmati rice, fresh snap peas, and Naan Bread. You need to serve the Naan with it, so you can soak up the scrumptious sauce! Love, Love, Loved this!!

Amazing! I made a few adjustments (left out the paprika and used tomato sauce instead of the chopped tomatoes). This will surely become my favorite, go-to, quick dinner fix!

Absolutely delicious! Saved in my recipe box baby!! Only thing I did different was add a thinly sliced jalapeno pepper, 1 tablespoon of organic honey, and a thinly sliced red bell pepper. 2 teaspoons of fresh ginger and 6 cloves garlic. Also, used a combo of coconut oil and sesame oil, and added pistachios and golden raisins and sweet potatoes.

Not as good as a restaurant.  Agree with the other reviewers to add a little more spice  I added them all into the oil that I cooked the onion in - better to enhance the flavour.  Next time, I will half the coconut milk - less calories and not worth the cream.  The one thing that I would like to improve: how to get the shrimp to have more flavour... the shrimp tasted a little watery and not mixed with the flavours.  Served on rice to absorb the broth.

Just added 1/2 teaspoon of  red curry also and used crushed tomatoes rather than diced tomatoes and this thickened the sauce, other than that  followed  the recipe. Does anyone know the proper Indian name for this dish?

Such a nice and versatile dish. I made it many times and every time I use a different meat, and add different vegetables, and it never fails me. You need to do some tweaks to the cooking method if using chicken or beef (both require longer times, and cooking before adding the coconut milk). I also used curry powder with the spices

I have made this shrimp curry several times now.  I use an immersion blender and puree the curry before adding the shrimps and cilantro- it makes a thicker sauce and helps me finish even faster.  We either increase or decrease the spices depending on who's having it and how spicy it needs to be.  Only problem in this house is that even when I double the recipe, it's never enough :)

Excellent! So easy to make. I had all the ingredients already on hand. I had a baked potato that we didn't eat the night before so when I added the shrimp, I added chunked potato. I served it over rice and it was delicious. I will make this many more times!

Quick and tasty, and on the table in less than 30 minutes. Flavor is excellent. Next time I might try a little red curry paste and some brown sugar to sweeten it a bit for our liking. A great recipe that can be molded easily for anyone's tastes. Thank you!

This was a top-notch recipe. Easy, tasty, flexible (make it spicier by adding some cayenne). I used grated ginger in lieu of ginger powder and I added another clove of minced garlic. It was a very tasty and great-looking dish. Can't wait to try it out on guests.

I have a dozen Shrimp Curry recipes. This one is very simple and will use it again.I used Hot Curry powder, Indian Chile powder and added Red pepper flakes to add some heat. I also sautéed the raw shrimp in the sauce to add flavor. Great recipe. Per a previous review I think I will add Clams and Mussels next time!

Liked this very much.  The only changes I made were to add some lightly steamed broccoli a couple of minutes before adding the shrimp, just to up the veggies.  I also used fresh minced ginger instead of dried.  My whole family complimented me on this dinner!

Great recipe that was very easy to make and loved by the entire family. I just added some naan bread to soak up the sauce and the dishes practically cleaned themselves.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I followed the recipe very closely, making sure to measure out all the spices.  The only difference was that I used 1-1.5 Tbsp fresh ginger minced, rather than 1 tsp powdered ginger (which follows the usual conversion ratio for fresh to dried in recipes).  As for the coconut milk, I got the extra-creamy kind from Trader Joe's and used only 1/2 the can, since other reviewers thought it was too watery.  Also threw in about 1.5 cups frozen peas for color, as I didn't have any cilantro on hand.  Can't wait to try this recipe with fried tofu instead of shrimp!  (Shrimp's kind of pricy for our budget...)  Those who like their Indian food spicy should add a hefty dose of cayenne pepper.

Came out great with a few alterations. As others suggested I added a teaspoon of curry powder, and also a 1/4 teaspoon of garam masala, a bit of chopped fresh chili, and cut the turmeric to 1 tsp. I used 3 tbsp. of fresh grated ginger instead of the tsp. of powder, and substituted chopped scallions for the cilantro--I hate the stuff. I scooped the most solid top 3/4 of the (carefully unshaken) can of coconut milk into the pan (reserving the rest) and cooked the dry spices in it over medium heat in a wok, scraping often, until the coconut oils separated out of the solids, about 5 min. I thus didn't need the peanut oil. I then fried the ginger, garlic and chili in this for a few minutes, stirring and scraping often. I filled the can with the remaining coconut milk with water and added this and the onion and tomatoes, following the rest of the recipe as above. Practically a new recipe but couldn't have done it without this :) Oh yeah I cooked down 4 chopped tomatoes for ten minutes or so and used that instead of a can. Who needs cans :) Now if I could only get some coconuts :)
EDIT: Made a wicked vegetarian version of this substituting some fresh baby corn and cauliflower for the shrimp. I fried them in the oil/ginger mixture a few minutes before adding the tomatoes etc. Upped the garam masala to 1/2 tsp. Outstanding

This was my first time making/eating any Indian dish.  I used garlic powder instead of a garlic clove and I didn't have any tumeric on hand. It was very good.

This was fantastic!!  After reading other cook's reviews I decided to thicken with 2 tbs of flour.  I don't like pre-cooked shrimp, so I bought frozen deveined fully peeled shrimp, thawed them, and then I added them in as soon as the curry began to simmer.  I let the shrimp cook in the curry for 10 minutes, then added the chopped cilantro and cooked for another 2 minutes as per the recipe.  Cooking the shrimp in the curry gave it an AMAZING shrimpy taste that is not too strong, but just perfect.  I think next time I might try adding a little lime to the party, for giggles.  My mum said she'd pay to eat this at a restaurant. Wonderful wonderful WONDERFUL!

I tried it and it is great, just used the whole sweet onion and more garlic, used half the spices when cooking the onions and garlic.  Used coconut cream, the whole can and didn't cook the shrimp too long less than a couple of minutes, but seems to be better the next day.  I was great for lunch the following day with a piece of garlic naan from Trader Joes.

Added a bit of curry to spice it up and served it over rice.
Very nice!

It was good but I added to it. Much more curry, fresh tomatoes, califlower, more salt, some peper and it needed something... I added just a little honey. Then it was really good. It made the flavors pop more.

Quick, easy & tasty! Had to make a few adjustments- used canola oil, 2% milk & skipped the cilantro- had to use what I had on hand and it still turned out great. Oh and I used raw shrimp that I seasoned with salt, pepper & curry seasoning. I just threw it in the sauce while it was simmering. I served it with brown rice and anything that gets my kids to eat brown rice is a winner in my opinion. This will be a regular in my kitchen!

My husband and I gobbled this up!  It was my first attempt a making an Indian dish, and it was super easy and very flavorful.  I used 2 lbs of shrimp, 1 T each of all the spices, 1 whole onion, and added 1 can each of garbanzo beans and peas for added protein/fiber.  I also added 1 T of curry and a dash of cayenne pepper for that authentic Indian flavor.  I served with white rice.  A new favorite in my home!

I loved this recipe!  I used coconut oil to saute the onion.  And we squeezed a little lime juice over it right before eating.  It took a bit to simmer down but the flavors were fantastic.  Will definitely make again.

I made this for dinner tonight, served it over white rice, and it really satisfied my craving for comfort food.  I used olive oil instead of the peanut oil, increased the chili powder and cumin by 1/2 - 1 teaspoon and added 1 teaspoon of salt to the final product. For the base, I used coconut cream from Trader Joe's. I did not have tumeric or cilantro.  I will definitely make it again, next time using all of the ingredients suggested. I think it would also be very good if you substituted chicken for the shrimp.

I made this as written except I used olive oil instead of peanut oil.  Very easy and quick to make (only took about 20 minutes).  I used small shrimp that didn't have a shell to peel.

Well, made this tonight and I can say that it was 'pretty good'.  Just seemed like it was missing something, not sure what but something.  Does need some heat added if you are like me.  Definitely put it together and then get creative with it.  This is not a bad review - leftovers are going with me to work tomorrow for lunch.

It was pretty good. I made a few adjustments. I substituted coconut oil for the peanut oil and fresh ginger for ground ginger as that is what I had. I also used light coconut milk. I added a couple tablespoons of honey to give it a touch of sweetness. I lightly blended it leaving most some of the chunks, and then added some cornstarch to thicken it a bit. It was really tasty!

Made this exactly as the recipe says, and it couldn't be better! Served it over rice. It's a little soupy, so I would serve it in soup bowls instead of on plates. Hubby and I couldn't stop eating it!

YUM! I loved this recipe and will definitely make again. I read some reviews and did make a few additions/changes. First I used coconut oil, I didn't have peanut oil. I added cayenne pepper, about 1/2 tsp. and added a jalapeno that I left the seeds in and diced finely. Added a good amount of heat. I realized at the last minute I didn't have cilantro so I used the same amount of parsley and about 1/2 - 1/4 tsp. dried mint. The flavor was delicious and the recipe is really easy. Thanks!

I just got married and I really dont know how to cook, but this recipe was super easy and fast and my husband loved it! The next day it was even better. I used exactly what the recipe recommended, just used a hand blender and cooked the shrimp in the curry sauce. Thank you so much!!

This was my first try at curry shrimp. I think it needed more spices because I might have thrown the ratio off when I  added more coconut milk. I wanted more sauce, but it wasn't as flavorful as it would have been with the stated amount of  coconut milk. My fault. I'll just bump up spices next time. I'd definitely like to try it again. Very yummy with naan to sop up sauce with.

We sauted the onion and added some chopped celery and carrots. We also added a couple of chilis for heat. Added an extra can of tomatos and coconut milk and did 1.5x the spices.
Very delightful!

Wow!  This was so delicious and flavorful!  It was really easy to make.  My husband loved it and told me to be sure to save this recipe.  We will be making it again soon.  I wouldn't change a thing!

This was fun to make.  Everyone loved it except my daughter, she did not care for the curry.  Excellent with some Naan bread.
