This is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and had great results. The pineapple juice does make it sweet, but that's what pineapple juice does. This is a great combination of flavors and will definitely be made again. Thanks for a great recipe, Witchywoman!

It was very sweet (which I knew by the ingredients).  I likened it to a Sex on the Beach with a coconut flare.  Personally I am not a fan of coconut in my drinks (bad experience).  But if you like sweet and coconut w/o a heavy alcohol flavor, you would def. like this drink.
