Chicken Marengo Haiku: "Made as directed, but didn't use bone, skin chick. I'm that kind of chick." I followed the recipe as written, but used BSCB. It surprised me how much we all liked it, although my youngest girlies didn't like the mushrooms nor the tomatoes, but since it called for whole canned tomatoes, they were simple to avoid. Sauce was a bit on the watery side, but serving over rice allowed by maximum absorption. (Wow, why was that word so hard to spell?)

The original recipe found in "The Joy of Cooking" is much better.  Sliced onions are browned in Olive Oil ( 1/2 cup), then removed.  The chicken is then browned in the flavored oil.  Chicken broth, Italian tomatoes, wine, parsley,  2-3 chopped garlic, thyme, bay leaf is added and chicken simmered for 45 min- to an hour.  Chicken removed to a baking  dish.  The liquid is  simmered and reduced for 10 min.  Then, sliced  fresh mushrooms and pearl onions are sauteed in 1/4 cup of real  butter and fresh lemon juice.  This is poured over the chicken, along with the reduced liquid,  a drained can of sliced black olives and finally a jigger (or 2 !) of brandy is poured over all.  Heat in over for about 30  min.  Serve with white rice and crusty french bread.  Ooooo-lah-lah !

I didn't have any canned mushrooms and used black olives instead. It was still delicious!

I followed the recipe as directed but removed the skin and fat.  I like it.  Thought it was going to be chicken cacciatore in flavour but it wasn't.  Very nice
