This was PHENOMINAL!!! One of the best recipes that I have tried from this site, hands down. Super simple to put together and the flavor was just awesome. I made this exactly as written aside from omitting the red peppers because I didn't have any and adding in a few cloves of whole garlic. I used hot Italian sausage. My little guy wiped his plate clean, and so did we, lol! This is a definate 10 star recipe that I will be making VERY OFTEN! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very tasty.  I did halve the recipe since there's only my husband and myself here and also only used chicken stock since I didn't have any white wine.  It was very delicious, colorful with the peppers, etc. and smelled great while it was baking. Thanks for the recipe, Beccabo73.

The minute I saw Christina's photo and read her review of this recipe, I new we would love it. Wow! It is excellent!! Followed the recipe with the exception of using 1 each of green, red, yellow and orange peppers and threw in a couple of carrots I needed to use up. I also did not peel the new red potatoes.  A couple of the kids and I don't usually care for spicey (hot), so I used 1 pound of sweet itialian and 1 pound of hot italian sausage. This was the perfect blend for us.  I also threw in a little fresh thyme and fresh parsley right before putting it in the oven. It did take apporox. 40 min in my oven.  This is definately a recipe that will be a reapeat here. Everyone loved it and said they are looking forward to having it again soon. Thanks for sharing!!

Delicious! I put my own spin on it. Cut everything down to half. Instead of wine I used beer(Im so used to it with sausage and was too lazy to get a bottle of wine :P ) and i doubled the chicken stock. I also added cajun seasoning and garlic salt as well as about 4 cloves of garlic.  it was delicious! the potatoes came out PERFECT and very soft, the sausage had great flavor. im not even a big pepper fan but i absolutely loved them this time around. will DEFINITELY make this again!

My mother-in-law showed me how to make this for my husband when I was first married a long time ago. (we are Italian) It is delicious, we never used the wine, I never did like wine in my food. So it tatses just as good without it. I really didn't use chicken broth since the sausage eludes alot of juices and oils to cook in. We baked it in the oven giving it a roasted taste, that is when we had time, if not we did it on the stove top also.

We loved this recipe!  I took a short cut and have used a bag of frozen potatoe cubes with diced peppers and onions.  But for the rest I have followed the recipe - Can not believe what a great flavor the wine and broth gave to the potatoes.  It was almost has it was soaked in.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I have used spicy Italian sausage.

OUTRAGEOUS!  I can't wait to make this for company.  I cut the recipe ingredients to 4 servings except for liquid - kept that at 8 as others suggested.  I did not have chicken broth so I used all wine.  Commenters said it lacked flavor so I seasoned everything (except sausage) liberally with Goya seasoning and Italian herbs before sauteing them.  The potatoes were perfect (I was skeptical). I put a lid on the peppers and onions which helped to soften them quickly.  I cannot tell you how good and flavorful this came out.  There were only 2 of us and we ate almost the entire dish ourselves.  I'm eating the leftovers-not sharing!  :)  Thank you submitter.

Deglaze the pan with the wine & broth and scrape up all the "bits" ... then add to baking dish.  Thanks Beccabo ..... AWESOME !  The smells remind me of the sausage vendors outside of Fenway Park !  :)

This recipe is definitely a keeper. Browning the potatoes before adding to the dish, and the addition of the wine to the stock really sets it apart from other similar recipes. I added carrots and adjusted the amount of peppers accordingly.

Since I found this recipe several months ago, I've been doing this about once every 2 weeks as it has turned into my husband's favorite meal!  I made as written the first two times and it's awesome like that, but I have tweeked it a little bit:   I add chopped celery and chopped garlic when I saute the onions.  I don't soften the peppers at all before baking, I just chuck them in the pan raw and bake.  (They still come out soft, but I like the texture better--I felt they were overcooked when I precooked them before baking.)  Sometimes, I also add carrots.  It adds more color and a bit more flavor.  In this way, I use all green bell peppers so that I can save money (the red peppers are quite a bit more expensive here) yet I still have a colorful dish.  Thanks for turning me on to a family favorite!!!

Luscious!  Made it as stated in the recipe.  I needed to add a little dry red wine because I didn't have quite enough white but that made no difference.  I was tempted to add some fresh basil, but it didn't need it and I'm glad I didn't.  I also used hot Italian sausage I got from my favorite butcher.  This is simple and comforting.

i just wanted to say this recipe was amazing. i did change some ingredients to lower the fat. I used turkey sausage, turkey kielbasa, and was out of chicken stock, so I used 1 1/2 cups of white wine and seasoned the dish with adobo. My kids were very satisfied. i also paired it up with brown rice.  What a success.

Great easy recipe.  Would work with any kind of sausage.  I used a spicy smoked polish sausage.  After browning the sausage, potatoes and vegetables I had alot of carmelized brown goodnes left in the bottom of my skillet. So I deglazed the pan with the wine and chicken stock (scraped up the brown stuff and incorporated it into the liquid) before pouring the liquid over the ingredients in the baking dish.  Why leave all that flavor stuck to the bottom of the pan?  My cooking time was, as others, about 45 minutes to finish the potatoes.  Would depend on how thick you cut them.  Anyway, it was good eats.

Great dish and a definite keeper! I cut everything in half except for the potatoes, spices and liquid. I also added a package of sliced Bella mushrooms. Next time I think I will add some grape tomatoes and use andouille sausage. Thanks for this comfort food excellence.

I grew up in a city that was 60 percent Italian and have since moved away...this dish brings me back to what I remember...(though I have yet to find as tasty homemade Italian sausage anywhere here in Colorado) We never had it with the potatoes either but this is a nice 'whole' casserole in the sense that it has your protein, starch and vegetables all in one. I would suggest doing everything the same except just throw the potatoes down in your casserole dish and pop them in the oven for 20 min first and then don't even bother sauteing the veggies - just sautee you sausages whole then slice them and add them with the vegetables. Also, if you want to have this over rice or on a hoggie with cheese, i suggest you just leave out the potatoes since I dunno, potatoes on bread or with rice  just is too much starch and who needs it when it tastes soooo good without?

This was so delicious!  I halved the recipe and made a few adjustments in the preparation.  I did not cook the sausage or the potatoes in the olive oil in a skillet.  I used small red potatoes and cut them in fourths, and mixed all the ingredients together in the baking pan.  I cooked it at 400 for about 40 minutes, or until the potatoes were tender.  It was really yummy!

We've made this a couple times now, and we love it. We use mild Italian sausage, red (unpeeled) potatoes, two medium onions, two red bell peppers, and one green pepper. I also add a couple cloves of garlic, pepper, paprika, and Italian seasoning. I usually have to bake 35 minutes before potatoes are tender. Last time I made it I added a little bit of cream in with the wine and chicken broth, and also thickened the mixture with a little cornstard; otherwise, the sauce is very thin, kind of like broth, not saucy at all.

YUMMY!!  You really need to cut the potatoes in small pieces because Mine took about 45 minutes just to get the potatoes soft.  Everyone had seconds, which really made me happy cause this made a ton!  Thanks so much!

This was fast and delicious - I only used one pound of Turkey italian sausage (cooked) and added some baby carrots and garlic. This ended up being a healthly low cal meal. I did not cook any of the vegetables which made this super fast. I don't know why it's necessary to cook the vegetables first. Cut all your veggies to size and adjust cook time as necessary - veggies do soak up your liquids but have wonderful flavor!

Very yummy!  I didn't have red peppers so I cut up 2 carrots instead.  I cut the carrots the same size as the potatoes and cooked them the same time I cooked the potatoes.  Simple, tasty recipe!  On a side note:  If by chance you have any left overs, this tastes great fried up with scrambled eggs for breakfast.  Two meals from one dish!

A first generation Italian friend of mine used to make something very similar to this for me and I have been longing for it.  She did used carrots too.  I think she called it "JhamBaht" (that is a phonetical spelling). It is really delicious and for me at least a recipe that will endure the test of time.

This recipe is delicious. I added a little more garlic salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning as my family likes bold flavors. I also used hot sausage. So delicious. Many people stated that the prep time is too long, but I cut the potatoes while the sausage was cooking and cut the bell peppers/onions while the potatoes were cooking. The potatoes did take longer to brown than I thought, but the end result was AWESOME. My husband said,"This is so good! I'm probably going to make myself sick, but I'm going to keep eating." I've made a similar recipe without the potatoes and it's not as good. The potatoes really add something. MMMMM....so good.

I rated this a five as my family ate a ton of it, which in my book equals a five (plus no one complained, and that's a miracle!).  I used three peppers, one yellow, one orange, and one red... they were super sweet.  My potatoes took longer than stated in the fry pan to brown, but that was fine- just wanted to be sure they were cooked through.  I was surprised that despite using wine, there was no wine taste at all.  (I like wine in my food).  Served with a side salad.  Yum!  Thanks!

This was really good.  With the excepiltion of cooking the sausage separately I followed the recipe as written.  Excellent, I will certainly make this again.

A new favorite in this house!!!  Delicious and easy to assemble.  The only change I made was to use all chicken stock instead of white wine.  Kids and adults both loved this dish.  Great with a side salad and french bread.

Yum!!! Hubby definitely wants this to stay on the regular rotation. Went exactly by recipe except added garlic (we love it). This was a great way to use our venison Italian sausage. Thanks for a great keeper recipe!

I make this all the time but without browning first. I use the whole sausage links and put everything in the over at 375 for approximately 40 minutes.

This was very good.  I cut the recipe in half but kept the wine and chicken stock the same as in the original.  Also, added some mushrooms in with the peppers and onions.  Will def. make this again!

WOW, in a Nutshell AMAZING...I Was Really Starting to Doubt my Cooking Ability, After I Had Tried a Couple of Recipes from this Site, With Rather Mediocre Results...But  Christinas Review Convinced me to Give This One a Try.......This Dish, and Marilyn G's Lima & Navy Bean Soup is Something I Could Eat Everyday for the Rest of Me Life!!!  First of all Your Gonna Need a Gi-Normous Baking Pan to fit all of this in, or at least 2 Good Sized Ones...I Like to Modify Recipes to try and Up the Nutritional Value...So I Used 2lbs. of Sweet Turkey Italian Sausage, and a 1lb. bag of Baby Carrots that I Nuked for about 4 minutes Prior...And instead of Just Regular Chicken Stock, I Used a Good Heaping Tablespoon of the Chicken Soup Base, Because the Turkey Italian tends to be a bit Blander than Pork Based Sausage...Also I Would Recommend Being Frugal with the Salt or even wait Until U are Finished Cooking...this Soup Base has Much More Sodium than Stock... I Used a Riesling Wine, and After a Half cup in the Dish and Approximately 7 Cups in me, it was Done...Terrific Right from the Oven, and Even Better the Next Day After All the Ingredients Had Married...I've had Sausage and Peppers Before, but Never with Potatoes...I Arranged the Potato Slices on the Bottom of the Pan, so They Soaked up all that Wonderful Olive Oil, Stock, and Flavors from the Sausage and Peppers...I Also Added about 7 Cloves of Garlic Which I LOVE!!!...Beccabo 73, I Wanna Marry U Girl.......

Great recipe, I followed the instructions...it was great. I also made it again with a slight variation, I did not have wine or stock, I used Italian salad dressing (already mixed) and topped with Parmesan cheese prior to baking, I had no complaints.

Great combination.  I cut the recipe in half and took the easy road. The recipe calls for frying everything separately in a skillet before transferring to a casserole dish and baking.  I decided to leave it all in the skillet, covered it with a lid and continued to cook on the stove top until the potatoes were tender.  We had a tiny bit left over and to make those stretch, I added it to some fried cabbage creating another great combination.

Very easy, delicious, everyone loved it. My husband went a step further and threw the mix in a skillet after it was done and scrambled up some eggs in it. Wah La...instant omelet! 
Since we prefer red potatoes, I quartered 2.5 llbs and fried them up in olived oil and poured them into my roasting pan, sliced and quartered 2 lbs of eckrich sausage and fried in the skillet with some onion to taste, poured that over the potatoes, sliced up 2 red and 1 yellow pepper and fried them up with a little white wine and poured that over the mix. Poured a 1/2 can of chicken broth and eyed approx the same amount of wine over the mix and mixed well. Placed the roasting lid on and placed in a 350* oven for 20-25 min. Amazing!

So easy and so good! I used a cast iron skillet and cooked the onions and peppers separately because of space. Thank you! Oh, and it didn't say but I covered it to bake.

Came upon some half-priced chicken sausage at Whole Foods and found this recipe and decided to go with it even though the sausage was not Italian.  I added some crushed red pepper to give it more zing and also made some other refinements like adding half and half with a bit of cornstarch with the white wine and chicken stock. Thought the result was rather ordinary given the multi-stage preparations.  Then I reheated the left-overs 2 days later and decided that I really liked the result.  I think the left-overs gave the flavors a chance to bloom and develop more than what we ate the night of preparation.  I don't know if I'll prepare again given the time it took to prepare, but I am going to consider how I might short-cut this dish.

I doubled this recipe for a family(12) get together. Thought I made to much due to my family (except me) eat like birds. Well I didn't make enough. That meal was gone the fastest in recorded history. Some changes that I made was that I used very small peeled baby potatoes and three differant sausages, a mild Italian, a hot Italian, and a hot portuguese chorizo.

Used a little less onion!  Definitely yummy.  Would be good to use leftovers as pizza topping with crust, pizza sauce and cheese added.  Yummy!

This dish was a bust in our house.  Didn't taste like the traditional sausage and peppers found in NY.  However we will use the cooked sausage for sandwiches and use the potatoes, peppers and onions for home fries

Absolutely wonderful! I did add a bunch more spice (garlic powder, salt, pepper, cayenne plus the Italian seasoning). It was wonderful and a new dinner staple.

I expected this to be a bland, but it wasn't at all. It was delicious actually. I only used a pound of sausage, used turkey sausage and used only half the olive oil, so I cut out a fair amount of fat. I also added some fresh green beans to the veggies and extra italian seasoning at the end. The only issue I had was that it took about 40 minutes in the oven as opposed to the 25.

I made this last night and it was very tasty. I did change a tiny bit, i used beef broth and no wine.  i cut the potatoes and put them in a 400 oven while i was browning the sausages, peppers and onions.  i put all in 13x9 and poured a cup of beef broth over all and baked for about 50 minutes.  ate with a salda on the side.  very tasty!!  thank you!

This was delicious. I used less sausage and extra potatoes to make this more budget friendly. I prepared this according to directions but instead of baking I had Mrdrea cook it in a foil pan on indirect heat on the grill. It took about 45 mins on the grill. I served this with a caesar salad and homemade croutons

This was so tasty...we loved it!  Next time I will definitely cut the recipe in half as we do not need such a large amount.  I used hot sausage and did not cook  the vegetables before baking them, but I did cook the potatoes as directed. I also added garlic.  I can't wait for left overs!

Loved it!  Used chicken sausage with green chile links and my husband not fond of onions so I didnt put one in, AND I  didn't have chicken stock so I opened up a can of Progresso Chicken Tortilla Soup and used 1/2 cup of the broth only - was great!  I also cooked up the potatoes a bit longer cuz we like them crispy.

Used Johnsonville 3 Cheese Italian Sausage. Less white potato and added some sweet. Red and yellow peppers only and added portabellas. Out of white wine so used all chicken stock but I can see how it would only be better with the wine. Skipped the skillet, dumped everything together and into the oven.

Delicious recipe!  Make sure to cut your potatoes in small chunks because mine took too long to get done and the other ingredients were overcooked by then.  2 inch thick slices was too big for mine to get done in that time frame.  Great tasting dish that pleases everyone.

This was excellent.  I had some cheese/beef hot dogs to use up so I made this.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and it made plenty for the 2 of us with some good leftovers!  I left out the italian seasoning (hubs doesn't care for that flavor) and just salt & peppered to taste.  The broth/wine mixture was a great addition, something new to add to my recipe box.  I think it would be great from breakfast with some scrambled eggs.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is delightful!  My only change was to add 1 tsp. minced garlic to the veggies as they were browning.  Otherwise..........it's perfect!
Second time I made it:  didn't have Italian sausage so substituted smoked sausage (links), and threw in a can of green beans, and a can of diced tomatoes and some hot pepper flakes.  It's hard to ruin this recipe.

My husband's Italian family makes a version of this and I was hoping to surprise him with an even better version.  This was good - but not what I was looking for.  I used kielbasa instead of italian sausage (his family uses kielbasa) and I thought that substitution was fine, didn't seem to make a difference overall.  I stuck exactly to the recipe for everything else.  It was "good" - but not "great".  I thought the potato portion was overwhelming.  I will cut back on the potatoes next time (or omit them altogether).  Also - the recipe doesn't really explain the potato part very well - do I cook them COMPLETELY on the stove top?  Or are they going to finish cooking in the oven?  I ended up having to cook the dish in the oven closer to an hour because my potatoes weren't getting done.  I think with a little tweaking to the recipe, this would easily be 5 stars. But cooked as-is, it was just good.  I'll still try it again with a few other changes and update my review then.

I used 1 green, 1 red, 1 yellow, and 1 orange pepper. Had only 1 onion plus I think 3 would be too much. I followed a reviewers suggestion and added Adobo seasoning, thyme, garlic and parsley. You have to add the seasoning of your choice so it's not bland. Really delicious!

The first time I pulled this out of the oven, I had my doubts it was going to taste any different than if I had cooked sausage, peppers and onions with potatoes on the stove.  The sauce didn't thicken up in 20 minutes so I put it back in the oven until it did, about an additional 15 minutes.  The sauce thickened up nicely and this dish was exceptional.  The only thing I added was a few red pepper flakes since I used mild sausage.  A definite keeper!

Based on reviews, I doubled the wine and chicken broth.  Big mistake as it made the potatoes soggy.  Due to the 5 minute precook on the stove and the 20 minutes in the oven, the vegetables were also overcooked.  It definitely needed more seasoning.  I found this to be a mediocre recipe.  I make pretty much the same recipe, but leave out the potatoes and cook everything on the stovetop so that the onions and peppers are crisp tender.    I would not make this again.

UPDATE: MADE THIS AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME, I SEASONED MY POTATOES (SLICED BABY YUKON GOLDS) AS THEY BROWNED AND AGAIN BEFORE BAKING - PERFECT! WHAT A BIG IMPROVEMENT!!! I USED ALL HOT ITALIAN SAUSAGE AND ADDED TONS OF FRESH GARLIC (WHOLE CLOVES). MY HUSBAND AND I COULD NOT GET ENOUGH! :) Not bad. My fiance and I used to enjoy this very dish at a local Italian restaurant. Unfortunately, that place has gone out of business (darn!). This is about as close as I'll get to my beloved meal. :) The only difference between the two is that this calls for red AND green bell peppers and quite a bit less liquid (the restaurant dish literally swam in liquid, but ironically enough, the veggies were not mushy in the least!). My only suggestion for improvement is to s&p your potatoes while they are browning IN ADDITION TO seasoning to taste PRIOR to baking. My fiance thought our potatoes were a tad underseasoned as is. A side salad tossed with Danielle M's Greek / house dressing and warm Italian bread completed our simple meal. With some tweaking, I know this will become a favorite at our house! Thanks for sharing, Becca! :-)

Very tasty and quick to make. I also halved the recipe for 2 people and there is still some nice leftover for lunch next day. I served it with a fried egg on top and some pickles. My husband loved it too. I will make it again, but next time I will use less sausage.

Used spicy italian sausage links and raosted the potatoes in the oven on 350 in a single layer (I cut them into slices) before adding the cooked sausage and veggies on tops, then baked and topped with cheese. Variations have become a regular meal in this house. Tonight Im trying it with spicy chicken sausage

Amazing! Halved the recipe and I wish I didn't! I omitted the white wine and used more chicken stock instead. I also only used 2 teas of olive oil in the beginning not the 1/4 cup. The sausage rendered off enough fat and oil its unnecessary to add more. I used red potatoes, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and added carrots which I thought was a good move. Will definitely make again!

I doubled this recipe the first time I made it because I wanted left overs and because it sounded so delicious. I was NOT disappointed. I used herbes de Provence because that's what I had. I also used red and green peppers frozen from my garden. I did not saute the peppers, because they were already soft from freezing. OUTSTANDING!

Excellent.  two suggestions.  Cook the potatoes for a little longer to try to crisp them up more, and cook in oven for 10-15 minutes longer than recipe calls for in order for the flavors to meld with one another.

This is very similar to dish we served at a restaurant I worked at, it was called Giambotta (pronounced Jumbaht). Instead of bell peppers we used vinegar cherry pepper(hot or sweet) cut into fourths and just fried the potatoes and served them on top. You can use any type of meat with this; on the bone cut up chicken or BLSL chicken breasts cut into chunks, pork chops and even steak (done stove top).

I made this recipe on a cold winter evening and my family thought it was really tasty comfort food.  I was one pepper short and used a bag of pearl onions along with one large onion and would do it that way again. For Italian seasoning i used dried basil and oregano and added very little salt.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I was looking for a way to fix italian sausage with potatoes and there it was. There are only 2 of us so we had leftovers, and they were as delicious the second time as the first. A keeper for me. I did add carrots cut into 1 to 2 inche chunks.

I used cubanelle peppers instead of bell peppers (for a more authentic "sausage and peppers" flavor), and red potatoes instead of baking potatoes. I cut each red potato into eighths, and I de-glazed the saute pan with the wine and chicken stock before pouring it into the baking dish. I also added 6 cloves of thinly sliced garlic along with the peppers and onions (which I also thinly sliced). DELICIOUS! Just make sure you have some crusty bread to mop up all that lovely sauce!

This is very tasty, indeed. I found that I needed to cook everything in batches, even in a pretty large frying pan. Two pounds of sausage wound up being boiled instead of browned when I tried to cook it all together. It also took longer than necessary. Splitting it into 2 batches was better. I also used some of the broth to deglaze the pan at the end and poured those tasty browned bits on top of all. So good. So Italian.

This is very similar to a recipe that I use; only I grill everything and cook the potatoes, onions and peppers in olive oil in a pan until they are crispy.  I did try this recipe in the oven, but thought there was too much liquid. Next time, I'll omit the liquid and cook my vegtables in olive oil until cripsy and then add the cooked sausage.

Was really excited when this recipe hit my inbox.  But wasn't all that excited after making it.  It wasn't horrible but just OK. It "missed" something and I'm not sure exactly what~more seasoning I guess.  I did follow other reviews and added some garlic but it just didn't quite hit the spot.

This was a fabulous recipe and very easy to make!  Here are a couple of suggestions that I used that made it really good.  I did use red potatoes and left the skins on, which added a very rustic flavor.  I also added some chunks of carrots.  And, to top it off, when serving, use grated parmesan cheese on the top.  It was "over the top" for flavor!!  Thanks for the sharing the recipe!

I skiped the veggies and added bacon.  Cooked everything on the bacon grease instead of adding oil.  It turned out very greasy, but tasty.  My version is definately not a good option if you are dieting, but it was delicious!

Since we raise own pigs our sausage is always ground. I made this recipe on the stove top and cooked the potatoes as bakers. Cracked each one open, put in a little butter, covered with veggie sausage mix and served with a dollop of sour cream. Super.

This was okay, nothing to complain about. However, I do wonder what all the fuss is about, as I wouldn't say it's absolutely amazing, but tasty.

The only changes I made were to 1/4 the recipe and use tiny little red potatoes that I didn't need to cut.  This dish was bursting with flavor.  I made sure that the veggies were almost completely cooked in the skillet which helped to keep the baking time to 20 minutes.  My husband and toddlers love it.

Quite good and will definitely make again.  Even though I scaled it down to 2 servings, I doubled the wine & stock and used a lot more seasoning than called for (we like things well seasoned!)... I do see why the sausage is done separately to brown properly, but didn't see any reason to separately cook veg, so I just put potatoes alone for a few minutes, added onions and cooked a few minutes more, then peppers for a few minutes and then used the liquids to quickly deglaze the pan, then poured the whole thing into a baking dish.  Hubby didn't even make it all the way in the front door before remarking on how good dinner smelled =)  DEFINITELY serve with some kind of yummy bread or roll to sop up the juices with!

When I make any recipe from the All Recipes site the first time, I follow the recipe exactly as the person who offered it has presented it.  I think it's the least another cook who is borrowing someones recipe can do.  THEN, if you just absolutely have to tweak it, put your own spin on it, alter it to your own taste, go ahead.  But  do NOT critique the recipe if you didn't make it exactly like it was presented.  That said, this recipe does not need to be tweaked, altered, spun or changed one bit.  For me, it merely needs to be doubled.  One pan is not enough.  It's that good.

This recipe is awesome just one thing though cover the pan with foil while baking it to help cook the potatoes all the way through. One more thing cut the sausage to bite size pieces.

I do not bake this - do it all on the stove top, starting with the potatoes. I substitute chicken sausage with roasted garlic (store was out of Italian sausage first time I made it). And I added mushrooms. I have five growing and hungry boys/men to feed and they all love this dish! I love it because it is ready in approx 30 mins, start to finish and one pot clean up!!

Bland, potatoes didn't work with the other ingredients, and tricky to get everything to roast properly when it's all mixed together.  Not worth the effort.

Delicious and easy!  I made this with no pre-browning, just tossed all the veggies and pinched off pieces of sausage (casing removed) in olive oil and seasonings and roasted at 400 degrees for about 45 minutes, stirring frequently.  I also added zucchini to mine and think other veggies such as carrots, mushrooms, squash, or tomatoes would be a great addition.  Will definitely make again!

We have made this 3 times now.  First time I made it and I have never followed a recipe to the T and it turned out good.  My husband has made this 2x now.  He always follows the recipe exactly and in this case it sure did turn out better than mine.  It works well for us as he is a meat eater and I love veggies so best of both worlds for us.

Absolutely yummy! This recipe is easy to make and easy to adapt to your own tastes. I use baby tri-color sweet peppers and add a dash of crushed red peppers for color and a little zip. There is a bit of prep but it's all simple chunky cutting and cleaning. I don't bother peeling the potatoes so that saves a little time. Try it you'll love it.

I had all of the ingredients on hand to cook this tonight so I thought I'd try it and we are in love! I'll admit I've been cooking for a long time and I'm terrible with directions/measuring, so I read the recipe and then eyeballed ingredients/winged stuff. This was so simple and good! Hubby said it reminded him of a rustic Italian dinner. Keeper...thanks!

I love this recipe!! I have made it multiple times and with different types of sausage (turkey, sweet and hot) and it turns out great!! If I do not have any white wine, I use extra chicken broth. I do add extra Italian seasoning and garlic but I like a lot of seasoning. I just tried a version of it by throwing everything in the crockpot (I did not brown anything either) and covering it with chicken broth it came great. I just drained off the extra broth when it was done.

I like all the ingredients in this recipe. But I never thought to cook potatoes
With sausage. My husband was skeptical. The first night we had this he said
It was not a keeper, but the next day he had it for lunch and changed his mind! I had used hot Italian sausage and the favors really mingled well over-night and spiced up the potatoes. So he changed his mind and wants it again!

There  no need to cook everything on the stove.  I browned the sausages while I was slicing the rest of the veggies and then threw everything in a covered baking dish all together.  Left in the oven on 275 for several hours and was delicious by dinnertime.  I skipped the potatoes since I was planning to serve over pasta.  Also added a can of whole tomatoes and a lot of garlic.  Delicious!

This was really a great entertaining dish. I used fresh Bratwurst and another interesting sausage (feta/spinach) from my butcher. I did a potluck and had my guests bring a salad and dessert. What a relaxed but delicious evening! Perhaps the best part, in the morning, I cut up the leftovers into little bits and made the most delicious fritatta ever! (just search for frittata recipes) Wa-bam-bam - two fab meals for the work of barely one! Thanks for posting!!!

Amazing recipe and so easy to cook! The kids were mad there wasn't enough for seconds. I baked hot Italian sausage for a few minutes and then chunked it up. I also chunked the potatoes and peppers about the same size so everything was uniform. I didnt have a problem with the potatoes being undercooked. Using the oil from the sausages I didnt need to use olive oil and since I just threw it all in the oven there werent multiple pans to wash. Will def be making this regularly.

We LOVED this recipe!  The flavors from the wine and chicken broth are amazing.  I didn't change anything - except, I only had 1.5 lbs of sausage, so that is all I used.  I didn't change anything else.  I used sweet italian sausage. Next time I will try a mix of hot and sweet.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have to tell you that I'm eatting this as I'm writting - not easy but worth it!!!! This is wonderful!!! I did read a review before I made it that said it was greasy and that the person would never make it again, so was a little worried. However, there were such easy solutions to that and it sounded sooooo good, I just had to try it and I'm so glad I did!! I have a few confessions to make, however - 1. I didn't use Italian sausage (OMG! I know, I know! So sorry!) I used sausages from Toulouse as I could just grab them at the supermarket instead of going to a specialty store; 2. I did not add the 1/4 cup of oil for the potatoes, but just browned them in the fat that was left from the sausages and followed with the peppers and onions, and thus, less grease;3. I didn't have any pre-mixed Italian seasoning so threw in a bit of dried thym, oragano, basil and a sprinkle of hot red chili pepper. I had some roquette that, as you may know must be used quickly or it's lost, so tossed a handfull on top after serving and it was FANTASTIC!!! LOVE IT! Will definately make this again and again, for me, as well as for friends! Thank you!! : )

This was pretty good, but not the best thing ever.  I saw in the pictures that some people use bigger chunks of potatoes rather than the slices called for in the recipe, so I did too.  Even though I had them nice and brown, they too longer than the 20 minutes in the oven to get fully cooked.  I should have cooked them longer in the skillet.  If I make this again, i will try the slices.

This was really good. The only thing I did different was adding some crushed garlic. Very tasty, my family really enjoyed it. I think next time I will try it with turkey sausage to make it a little healthier.

i  i wanted to add potatoes to the usual sausage and peppers. great template, i used hot turkey sausage, and a couple of tablespoon of chipoltle peppers in adobe sauce instead of the wine and stock, added water to the drippings and let that reduce a minute or so and baked.

This was really delicious. I used sweet turkey sausage, added fresh garlic and red pepper flakes. The only thing I'll do different next time is cut the potato slices thinner, I ended up having to cover the dish with aluminum foil for extra 10 minutes.

Love this recipe.  Like others, I add tons of garlic before putting it in the oven, which, for a garlic-lover is a must.  I also add some red pepper flakes since I usually buy mild sausages.  I also add some of the spice to the potatoes when frying, and I use vermouth instead of white wine, which is my go-to.  These are minor changes, though, really, and the recipe is awesome.  It's one of my husband (and mine!) favorite meals!

Super easy, we used two pans and cooked the sausage and potatoes at the same time to save time.  The kids even liked it, which makes this one even better.

This looks so good before it even gets to the oven. I halved the recipe, had some smoked sausage to use up so added that to the italian sausage and added in a couple of cloves of garlic. I cooked it for 30 minutes which turned out to be perfect for me, any longer and the onions would have been burnt. My husband gobbled this up in no time. Thanks Beccabo 73.

good.. definitely needs some salt. i did half, but kept the liquids the same. potatoes should be chunky, but not super chunky. maybe try 3/8" slices next time.

It tasted pretty good, however when following the recipe exactly it lacked flavor so I added more Italian seasoning throughout the browning and sauteing process.  Also if you cut the potatoes to thick it will take longer to cook, so cut them thinner than it says in the recipe.  Overall not bad.

Awesome! This is a keeper!  I made a half recipe but kept all the wine, chicken stock, and seasoning. Used Sweet Italian Sausages.  Would highly recommend giving this one a try at your house.

The wife and I agreed on a four rating. We're tough, I guess! The only thing lacking from a five is that we didn't feel there was much of a theme to it as a dish, even though it was delicious. I made half the recipe tonight while we were snowed in, and it was delicious, but we have a better handle on what else would be needed in the meal.  It would go best with a flaky bread stick and a salad. The taste was good, but we may add some cajun seasoning next time just for an extra kick. There was too much oil doing half of everything, so next time I'll be far less gung ho with the oil. The potatoes also took far too long to cook. "Thickly sliced" is what I did, but I think it should be sliced and then taken in halves to facilitate quicker, more even frying. As my wife summed it up, this is "man food“, but it's definitely a keeper. In fact, I'm on my way to go print this recipe for our recipe book as soon as I'm done typing! Thanks for sharing, and once it's printed I look forward to reading other variations!

Loved this dish! Served it the first night with rice and it was great. Even better the next day - made a sandwich on good French bread and it reminded me of the Italian Sausage Sandwiches we used to get in NJ.

We liked this recipe, because it was change from what we normally eat for dinner.  But I think its lacking something.  Its not very "saucy"- there's nothing holding the ingredients together (like in a pot pie). I didn't like that I had to pan fry everything in advance. I'm a busy mom, and don't want to stand at the stovetop for an hour putting a meal together. I might make it again, but probably pretty infrequently.

This is extremely tasty. I added finely chopped garlic with the vegetables. I wish I had doubled or even tripled the wine and chicken stock, the flavor is scrumptious! Thank you for such a great recipe.

We used polish sausage instead of Italian and it was still delicious! I think next time we'll double the meat though because we would like it meatier.

I found this a bit bland to my taste, so the second time making it  I added a few cloves of minced garlic  while sauteing the potatoes, and 3 chopped (uncooked) ripe roma tomatoes to the veggie mix. The sausages I had were mild, so I spiced up the wine/stock mixture with a dash of hot pepper sauce.  Much more flavour!

Wow!!  I've never had "sausage & peppers" without the sauce.... or with potatoes for that matter...and truly, this is a cozy treat.  Made as written... but 1/2 the recipe instead of the whole (just in case my crabby kids didn't like it)... should have made the whole thing.  Used 1 pack of mild sausages (which is more than a pound but I didn't feel like doing the guess work & taking some out), worked in some yellow bell pepper "just because." (It didn't change the taste).  I didn't have russet potatoes, so I used yukon golds... which were smaller, so I approximated (is that a word?) about 1 standard russet's worth.  I accidentally added 1/4 tsp of Italian season TOO much because I didn't have my glasses on & misread the measure... but that doesn't count for changing the recipe! ;)  This was excellent....and forgiving... and will be added to the rotation.  Thanks so much for sharing such a nice recipe!

WOW!  I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  Boy am I glad I did!  The whole family LOVED it!  Even our EXTREMELY picky 10 year old ate every last bit from his plate, including the peppers & onions!  HUH?  That NEVER happens!  I followed as written with only a couple minor tweaks of my own.... Colorful peppers instead of green and doubled the wine & stock so it would be juicier.  Amazing!  Thank you so much for sharing!  =)

I thought this needed more potatoes and had too much meat, but I also added garlic and way more seasonings and then it was really good!

Your recipe was fantastic. Like any good cook you adjust your cooking time and spices to please your family. I truly dislike when others review recipes and add this, that and another thing. I say write and submitt your own recipe. Thank you for Sharing

I just made this for our dinner! It was a hit with the kids & adults! I didn't use wine, I added a whole can of chicken stock. I think I'll add some carrots to next time. I served with a fresh baguette! YUMMY!

Wow this came out really great. I used some Lawry's seasoned salt and garlic powder but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Came out delicious and was very good the next day too. I never cook with sausage but I will start making this more often.

It is a delicious recipe. My husband gave it 5 stars, and I will certainly try it again. Instead of wine I add more chicken stock and a clove of garlic.

I cut the recipe in half because I was only cooking for two. I used a yellow and an orange pepper because I got a three pepper package that had a red pepper that I used in another recipe. 
The smell from the oven as it was cooking was outrageous. Couldn't wait until the timer went off.
This was SOOOOO good.  
Will definitely make this again.

My husband really loved this recipe. It was one of my best choices to try in a long time. I prepared it exactly as written, but I did cut the recipe in half for just the two of us. I will definitely be making it again.

I've been holding onto this recipe for a few months and finally decided it was cold enough to make this yummy cold weather comfort food!! My whole family loved it. I used all recommended ingredients and followed the recipe almost to a T.  I used 1 lb of hot Italian sausage and 1 lb of mild Italian sausage., only 2 onions, increased the liquid by 1/2 cup. (So I used 3/4 cup chicken stock and 3/4 cup white wine.  I also sautéed the links of sausage and then cut them in chunks before adding to the roasting pan.  I didn't soften the onion and peppers, just mixed them right in with the cooked sausage and pan browned potatoes. They softened enough during the roasting process in the oven. Once I had verything in the roasting pan, I sprinkled the Italian seasoning over the pan (More like 2 tsp) and poured the broth mixture evenly over everything.  It did take about 40 min to cook the potatoes thoroughly, but that allowed time for all the flavors to meld together!!  What a yummy one dish dinner. Yes, there is a little prep and clean up, but worth the effort. Next time I will double the recipe so my family of 5 has leftovers!!!! I had hoped to make a yummy  egg frittata with the leftovers, but every bite was eaten!! Thanks for a great new recipe..

Huge amount of food! This recipe makes 2 baking dishes of 13 inch X 9 inch size. The recipe takes a long time to make, due to the quantity of food. Chopping takes a while... Browning the potatoes takes a while because there are so many in the pan... The quantity of vegetables was so great that I filled my large skillet twice. And in the end, when the cooking is done, the  meat ratio of this recipe is far too low. If I make it again -- which I may not, because only the sausage has detectable flavor -- I'll leave the quantity of sausage the same, but cut everything else in half.

Cut the recipe in half the first time as there are only two of us.  delicious.   Second time made the whole recipe...added beef broth instead of chicken  broth and wine, and also added some garlic when sautéing the vegs.  Leftovers were added to jarred sauce and served over penne pasta for another  great meal....delicious.

I'm not sure how to rate it since I made changes to some ingredients, but followed the directions and my husband and I loved it! I used red potatoes, Johnsonville beef sausage (cut up), 1 red pepper, 1 yellow pepper, and 1 green pepper. I didn't add the wine and cut down to only 1 cup of chicken broth. Thanks for the recipe!

A-OK !  Simple to make, excellent flavor.  I halved the recipe, and the cooking times were perfect for each ingredient.  I baked at 400 for 20 minutes.   I used smoked sausage, not Italian.  We'll be making this often.  We don't eat sausage but smoked is my only exception, and with this recipe it's a trade-off....

It seemed like a lot of work to fry each ingredient individually then bake but the end result was worth the extra time. I followed the recipe exactly as written; my family loved it. The vegetables retained their own flavor, very important to me. I've made this dish multiple times, it "travels" and reheats very well.

I've been making this recipe for years.  I use turkey Italian sausage which I brown and cut into pieces.  The raw vegetables go into the pan cut up with the sausage.  I toss with olive oil and seasonings and roast for 45 min. to an hour stirring every 15 minutes till done.  I don't use the wine or broth since the vegetables throw off a lot of water and I want the ingredients to carmelize.  This method makes it quicker to put together and it comes out great!  Also, there is no need for wine or broth.  The sausage and vegetables provide plenty of liquid.  Another spin on the this recipe is to replace the peppers with zucchini cut in chunks and grape tomatoes sliced in half along with the onions and potatoes.  Potatoes can be optional.

Sausage Peppers Onions Potato Bake Haiku: "So easy to make. But cut the pieces smaller. Broil with some cheese!" I didn't want to have huge 2" hunks of sausage and wedged peppers and potatoes and cut ours into more manageable bite-sizes. Made the cook time a little quicker, but prep time slightly more; no biggie. Put everything in a baking dish covered for 15 min., then kicked to broil w/ some grated cheddar for another few min. for a nice brown crispy top. Simple and yummy meal w/ minimal clean-up and has starch, meat and vegg - a keeper!

This was a very easy, very flavorful dish.  Simple ingredients and simple preparation, once it's in the oven you have time to tidy up the prep area and relax with a glass of wine while you wait for the aromas to entice your family to the kitchen!   This recipe is a simply delicious as written, so if you are new to cooking, simply follow this recipe!  Some italian seasonings you could try are oregano, parsley, rosemary, thyme, or fennel or all of them! Lol  I add a few chili flakes, of course garlic and a good shot of of lemon juice to ours!   Thank you for sharing your great family recipe!  It's pure comfort food!  I will make this for years to come!

Delicious, absolute hit!! I followed all of the cooking steps but improvised my own take. Both times wonderful words cannot describe! I bought 1 lb each of sweet chicken sausage & hot turkey sausage. I used 2 yellow, 2 orange and 1 of each red and green pepper, red potatoes, and sliced up 4 each of carrots and celery, and used the rest of the ingredients the recipe listed. It is a full hearty quick meal; looks fabulous with all of the colors mixed together on the plate and served 3 couples, best part I had leftovers, which are always almost even better the next day!! I also served it with toasted semolina bread. A must try, and it really is easy! I cannot wait to make it again and impress more people =]

Really good. Omitted the peppers because they don't like me. Added chopped garlic to the onions. Deglazed the pan with dry vermouth and stock before dumping it in the baking dish and topped it with a touch of coarsely grated asiago.

I halved the onions and it was still way too much onion. The sausage was very well cooked on the outside, but blood red on the inside. I had to chop it up smaller and re cook it on the stove top. I used waaay more seasoning than the recipe calle for and it was the perfect amount, so I know this would have been bland had I not done that. My husband said it tasted fine, but all the ingredients should be diced and served with pasta or rice next time I make it. I will just go with what my husband suggested next time.

I have made this twice,once as written & my own variation. In a half batch of the recipe I added asparagus, hot Italian sausage that I browned and then cut, and I mixed 2 tbsp. barbeque sauce with the stock. I also used 1 small yellow & 1 red onion. Very tasty and adaptable recipe, I'm looking forward to subbing carrots & parsnips for the potatoes next time. It has has become one of my husband's new favorites. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Our family loved this recipe - I only made changes because I didn't have exact ingredients on hand - I used small baby potatoes, halved and unpeeled. I only had red and yellow peppers and instead of Italian seasoning I used some dried oregano and basil. I used less onion as well. I had leftover grilled sausages so I just cut them up and tossed in with the rest before I put the whole thing in the oven. I served this with spaghetti squash which I tossed with sautéed garlic, parmesan cheese, fresh basil and s&p. Delicious!

The first time I tried this recipe it was just ok and it took forever to cook. The second time I used an electric countertop skillet and made some changes. It came out fantastic in 45 minutes flat!
1. With the 4 tablespoons of olive oil I cooked the onions first and added minced garlic. Cooked 5 minutes - Stir
2. I added the potatoes. Cooked for 10 minutes – Stir & cover
3. I added the green peppers. Cooked for 5 minutes – Stir & cover
4. I spread apart the onions, potatoes, and peppers and added the sausages in the middle of the skillet and addedd the spices. I also added a little sage and parsley and splashed some Worcestershire on the sausages. Cooked for 10 minutes. - Stir & cover
5. I added sliced mushrooms and the chicken stock. Cover and let simmer for 15-20 minutes. Stirring occasionally.

I don't know why something this easy is so crazy good but it really is. I double the sauce and that's about all I do - the recipe works as is.  When I have guests that don't like wine. I use more broth and its still really good - you gotta eat this with good crusty bread its oh yeah just right.

We enjoyed this, but did alter. We used a small bag of mini red potatoes instead of reg ones. We cooked mini potatoes -cut in half with chopped mini carrots in pan with Italian salad dressing. Also with the veggies we added celery slices and orange peppers-don't like green. Served with parm cheese and sour cream. Very tasty.

Great recipe- a nice change for italian sausage dinners.  My potatoes were not done at 25 min so I bumped it up to 425 degrees for 10 more minutes and that did the trick. White wine+ chicken broth was so delicious!  Adding this to my dinner rotations, thank you!

Yes I did try this recipe with Turkey Sausage and followed directions.
I don't understand why it says to preheat oven to 400 when all  
has been precooked.  I added some mozzarella cheez over the top
for extra flavor and the whole dish came out totally overbrowned and
overcooked. I can understand the cheese being over done  but it was all overdone but it still tasted good.  Next time, I will bake @ 350 with foil over it and uncover and add cheese and bake additional 5 minutes.  Think this will solve the problem. Did anyone else have these same results?

This just didn't work out for me. I followed the recipe to a T, with the exception of not peeling the potatoes before slicing because I was looking to save some time. The potatoes were still hard after 25 minutes in the oven and 10 minutes of sautéing. I wonder if this would be better with small red potatoes? After almost an hour in the oven the potatoes were finally cooked through but the other veggies were overlooked. I don't know if I will try this again. Maybe it's just me. It took way to long to put together.

This recipe is SO GOOD as is. I did cut down on the prep/cook time and liquid for personal preference.

Great recipe. Doesn't need to be so complicated. I snipped hot Italian sausage into 2 inch pieces and browned them (only coated the pan with Pam spray since sausage is so oily). Put sausage in casserole dish and browned diced potatoes in some white wine then microwaved (in different bowl) for 2mins to cut down bake time. Did not pre-cook peppers or onions. Deglazed pan with more wine and added this to casserole. I would not use more than that small amount of liquid as the sausage and veggies give off a lot of liquid on their own (unless you like a lot of sauce of course). I would not use chicken broth in the future either, the wine is GREAT. 

Next time I will stop at a butcher for a better sausage. This was good from our local grocer but this recipe is good enough to use an even better one. 

3/4 family members loved this. The 4th is too picky to count anyway ;)

This was my first time ever making this kind of dish, and my fiancee and I loved it!!  I closely followed the recipe except for these slight changes: I cut the recipe in half to yield 4 servings, except as others suggested, used the original 1/2 c. white wine and 1/2 c. chicken stock, which was the perfect amount of liquid.  I used spicy italian chicken sausage instead of regular italian sausage for a lower-fat version.  When sauteeing the potatoes in olive oil I lightly seasoned them with pepper, garlic powder, and seasoning salt.  I sauteed the peppers and onions with 2 minced cloves of garlic.  (I tend to cook with a lot of garlic, so this was to suit our taste).  I baked the dish for 45 minutes (the potatoes were a bit too firm after only 25 minutes). The result was absolutely delicious!!  I will definitely be making this many, many more times!!!

This dish is fantastic! Followed the recipe to a T. Be sure to include the wine and chicken stock. It gives the dish an extra rich flavor. I will be making this one frequently!

The purists will hate this review, but because so many people tweak recipes which I generally find VERY helpful, I'm going to do it with this review. I love the ingredients and the "guts" of the recipe, however, after making this many times, I alter it to make it a little healthier and to cut down on the prep time. I dice up my potatoes, toss them with a little canola oil, spices to taste, and bake on parchment paper for 20-22 minutes. While they're baking, I brown my sausage (smoked turkey sausage) and then sautee my onions and peppers in the measly drippings the low-fat turkey sausage provides. When the potatoes are done, I combine them with the sausage, onions, and peppers and sprinkle with a little cheese (usually mozz or parm),  then toss back in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese. Voila! Served with a simple green salad, this is a family favorite that's quick for a busy weeknight dinner, or anytime some good, old-fashioned comfort food is desired.

This recipe totally saved my night tonight.  I couldn't think of anything to make for dinner so I came to Allrecipes and this is the first one I saw.  SUPER easy to make, fairly cheap in ingredients, and it didn't take very long to prepare.  I had to alter the recipe just a little since I was only cooking for two.  I used red wine instead of white wine because it's what I had at home.  Dinner turned out GREAT.  Flavorful and delicious!

I made this for dinner last night but I used ground beef rather than sausage.  The adults of the family found it tasty but the children did not care for this recipe.  I will make it again using sausage.

A bit bland for my liking. It wasn't bad, just not memorable. Could use some extra spicing to improve flavour, but probably would not make again.

I made half recipe of the this for 2 of us, and it was great plenty.  The only changes I made, was to use only 1 onion, and all chicken broth, no wine.  This was quite tasty, and a meal I will certainly make again!!

This was fantastic.  I used chicken Italian style sausage.  I also added a quarter of a head of cabbage (had to use it up before it went bad) with the rest of the veggies.  Used only chicken broth instead of white wine.  Used it to deglaze the pan and poured it all into the baking dish.  Both my 9 yr old and 3 yr old gobbled it up.

I halved this recipe and used Johnsonville chicken & pork blend Italian sausage. We thought this was very tasty in a subtle way as much of the flavor came from the semi-caramelized veggies and of course the tasty sausage juice soaked into the potatoes. We will have this meal again, thank you!

This is a good, basic meat-and-potatoes recipe (very husband friendly ;-)). I made it with Italian-style chicken sausage to cut some of the fat, and it was flavorful.

Excellent! Used red potatoes cut into small chunks and they browned nicely. Used all chicken stock since I didn't have wine. Added two cloves garlic and some Sazon Complete. This will absolutely be my only sausage, peppers, onions and potato recipe from now on!

My husband's family loves this meal; it's great to bring to potluck dinners and I never have leftovers to lug back home.  Without changing a thing, it's perfect.  When I make it just for us at home, however, I make some changes for the kids.  They don't like peppers so I replace the peppers with broccoli and they gobble it up.  I also tend to leftover cooked sausage which makes it that much easier to prepare.  This recipe is easy, delicious, and adaptable.  I love it!

This was alright. I don't really understand all the rave reviews. I used italian turkey sausage and only chicken stock in place of the wine because I didn't have any. I had to bake it about 35 mins because the potatoes were still hard and that caused the peppers to become really mushy and the sausage kind of dry. Maybe the potatoes should not be "thickly sliced". It was pretty easy and tasted ok. Not the best thing I have ever made, but I would make it again in a pinch since it doesn't require a lot of ingredients or work.

Really enjoyable meal. I cut the recipe in 1/2 and used a cast iron skillet to brown the meat, cook the potatoes and soften the vegetables. The mixture  filled a 9x13 pan. Used 3 medium potatoes instead of 2 large but will bump to 4 next time, since my boys aren't big veggie eaters.

I made this for my husband using bratwurst & he LOVED it! When the meat was about 1/2 way done, I added the peppers & onions in the pan, just to save a step.  I'll definately be making this again!!

Amazing recipe and so easy!! I added yellow squash and topped the bake with mozzarella and bread crumbs about 10 minutes in and it turned out great. I also cooked everything in coconut oil and used chorizo sausage. I'll be making this dish again!

This was delicious and came out looking great!  I halved the recipe and used unpeeled red potatoes.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for sharing this one!

VERY good! I added more seasonings (italian,garlic and onion powder,fennel seed) and fresh garlic. I think it would have been just a bit bland for our tastes otherwise. Thank you for sharing!!!

Fabulous... I took a major shortcut and cooked the sausage and vegetables all together after browning a little bacon....I used red wine cuz I didn't have any white and i added a package of Ranch Dip before putting in the oven...OMG -- delish!!

Super good!!!  I didn't need to add olive oil after the first little bit because the sausages gave off a good bit of oil.  I used this oil to cook the veggies and it gave everything great flavor and color.  I added garlic as suggested.  So good!

This is an excellent recipe! I have made this several times now and it always turns out great. My family loves it. I use both hot and sweet Italian sausage and serve it with warm Italian bread.

I gave recipe 5 stars because this is the best recipe of this kind that I ever made...Family loved it and my young children ate it up too. I did not use any peppers only onions and it was wonderful with just sausage/onions/potatoes. The wine was a really nice touch I thought. I will be making this dish for out picnic this weekend. Thanks for sharing!

I love this combination.  My family has always used a disposable baking tray. Start with a hot oven (400) and just toss the sausage into the baking tray to brown up.  Add a quarter cup of olive oil to the pan juices then add the peppers, onions, potatoes and spices; stir it up to coat all the vegetables then cover with foil and drop the oven temp down to 350 -375.  Bake for 1 1/2 hours.  Serve on Italian sub rolls and enjoy!

I halved the recipe. Used smoked turkey sausages, omitted the potatoes and wine (didn't have any), used all stock, a little cornstarch to thicken and served over rice. I did use a teaspoon or two of diced hot pepper to give this heat. We enjoyed this.

This was good but not great.  Used spicy italian sausage and frozen peppers.  We felt it was quite bland.  Will not make again.

Loved this recipe. Made it a second time around for my out of town guests. However please note that I did not use the additional 1/4 cup of olive oil after cooking the sausage; it made plenty of oil for the rest of the skillet cooking.  But if I used turkey sausage I would probably need the added olive oil.

This one id a winner...

Due to time constraints, I had to improvise according to what I had on hand.  I only had 2 russet potatoes, so I supplemented with a bag of Trader Joe’s cubed acorn squash, and it was delicious!  I also simplified the assembly, by first sautéing cubed potatoes and squash for 4 minutes in a large deep skillet.  I then added 1 cubed green pepper, 1 cubed red pepper, 1 chopped onion, and 4 minced garlic cloves, and sautéed everything for another 4 minutes.  I then added 6 pre-cooked “chicken sausage with jalapeno” sliced diagonally, Italian seasoning, some pepper flakes, Lowrey’s Seasoned Salt, and white wine and chicken broth.  I stirred all for another 2 minutes, then spooned all into a 9 X 13 baking dish.   I baked it covered in aluminum foil for 30 minutes, then uncovered for 12 minutes.  It came out perfectly cooked - - so yummy!

Excellent recipe, and very easy: simply prep the ingredients and let them bake! I used mild Italian sausage and didn't have any red bell peppers, so just used green. Also added whole garlic cloves (about 4 or 5) to the pan with the peppers/onions. Turned the stove to high when I put on the potatoes, which gave them a very nice "crisp" edge to them before they went into the oven. Wife and kids gobbled it down - a definite keeper!

The flavor of this was very good. I took one star away because I felt the cooking time for potatoes and peppers was too long- they were a little mushy. I will make this again and just decrease the times. Thanks for a nice, family recipe!

So delicious!  My husband said that he wished the sausage was scrambled, and the potatoes hash brown style, which I may try for his sake--I think the potatoes would get mushy.  In my opinion, NOTHING needs to be changed!

So...I'm eating this right now as I write cause I couldn't wait! This dish is so GOOD! I didn't change a thing in the recipe except I didn't have the white wine but I had Marsala cooking wine which is what I used instead. Absolutely yummy! I will definately be making this again.

All I did different was used more stock in place of the wine and used 2 or 3 tsps italian seasoning, otherwise everything was the same.  This was absolutely delicious and will be made again and again at my place, thank you!

The WHOLE family liked it!  Made this as written, and while I was a bit unsure of how the onions would be taken (young kids), this dish was devoured.  I thought I would have a ton of leftovers, because it seemed to be so much food...it got eaten so fast, I barely got to enjoy it the next day.      As for any suggestions, I think next time I would par boil the potatoes so they can cook up more quickly (I didn't think frying did that much), and for my taste, I would add more peppers and onions.    Enjoy.

Looooved this!!! The only change I made was to add 2 cloves of garlic (minced) to the onion/pepper mixture. The potatoes absorb the juices while cooking, YUM! This is even better the next day. All 3 of my picky eaters loved it. Thanks!!

One of the very best everyday recipes I've done off of here.  I downsized to 2 servings but upped the wine & broth to 1/4 c each & deglazed the pan with them.  Had to sub Marsalla for generic white wine.

This is a delicious, comforting recipe! Since there are only two of us, I only made half a batch, and we ate almost the whole dish! Because I lacked the white wine, I just used chicken broth, but want to try it with the wine next time. My husband said it was a "keeper."

Followed this recipe to the letter. Got to the chicken stock, opened the cupboard,no stock! What to do, what to do? Decided to use a can of cream of chicken soup. Mixed it and the white wine together, poured over mixture then stirred to coat all ingredients. It was scrumptious! Soup made it more gravylike. It was like Italian sausage(I used a hot fennel sausage from my local meat market) stew. My husband very eagerly had the leftovers for lunch the next day. Great recipe Becca, thanks a million.

This was so very good.  Ya think how could it be any differnet from regular sausage and peppers, but it is.  The chicken broth really gives it a good taste.  Used hot and sweet sausage.  Will make again and again!

Overall, this was a great dinner. We substituted Italian turkey sausage to cut down on the fat and calories. I personally feel fresh herbs make a huge difference compared to dry.  But realistically, dry are readily available.  I think fresh minced garlic cloves would be a great addition.  The recipe is very easy to make and after work, those are my favorite recipes.  We gave it 4 stars because their seems to be too much oil used. We cut back on the oil, and it was still too much.  We will definitely make it again...and again....and again.

This dish was AMAZING!! Omitted the wine, didn't have any, added 2 cups of chicken stock, diced chicken breast, used 1 red pepper and 1 yellow pepper, and fresh garlic.  I was hoping to have leftovers, but my kids had several helpings.  I will make double the amount next time just to have leftovers!

This was good and I will probably make it again but with a few changes.  First I will only use 2 onions and half of the peppers the recipe calls for, 4 large peppers is alot of peppers and it seemed like the sausages got lost in the mix.   I will definetly season the potatoes while thier cooking in the skillet.  Before I put the peppers and onions in the skillet I deglazed the pan with some white wine, as a result, the vegetables could pick up all the little brown bits while they are cooking.  I think the next time I make this with the changes I mentioned it will be even better.   All in all this is a great dish.

Great recipe!!  My family loved this!  I didn't change anything except sprinkled a little parmesan cheese in each bowl as I was serving it.  The only changes I would make the next time, and there will be a next time, is cut the sausage a little smaller and possibly add a little more wine and broth just because I really enjoyed the taste of the sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe, I have already had somebody ask for the recipe!!

This was a delightfully different option to make for dinner when I was stumped.  Very hearty and a nicely balanced meal.  The only changes we made were to use honey garlic sausages instead of Italian because the only ones available were hot and we're not hot food people.  I think different sausages would give this dish completely different flavours, which makes it very versatile!  A wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing!

LOVED this recipe!!  Was very easy to make and my husband and I thought it was delicious.  The sausage really made the dish.  I did add mushroom soup at the end (I thought my husband would like it more with the soup).  Next time I will try it without.

This is good...but I have been making something similar for years that is even better....same basic recipe, but we brown chicken thoughts and legs in oil and then add them to the casserole.  We also use oregano to spice it up and sometimes use red wine instead of white.  It is a great all-in-one meal w/a salad that we make for visitors to our Mountain home.  What is even better is the next day when you can chop up the remains and make an awesome hash!

This is a great recipe for a cold night. I added a lot more veggies though, beans, cauliflower, more onions & mushrooms. Doubled the chicken broth and doubled the italian spices.  Served with nice buns and used the buns to dip in the sauce.

I don't usually review things here but will this time. This was one of the tastiest dishes I have tried here and I have tried a lot . Double up the chicken stock and I used a good winter ale instead of the wine. I used Johnsonville Beer Bratwurst sausages as well and this turned out so good . Great recipe !!!

Took this dish to a party over the weekend.   Everyone raved about it.  Had many requests for the recipe.  Didn't have the white wine but those who tasted it, said didn't need it.  I don't usually take a new recipe to a party, but in this case it was a winner.

My partner specifically asked me to add this to my recipes. I used all chicken stock and had to cut out the potatoes for time (I filled in with (gulp) tater tots, but it worked. I did add 1 Tbs of minced garlic and red pepper flakes (mild sausage), which made for a more flavor-packed recipe.  Great, quick recipe.

YUM!!! I did add a few cloves of diced garlic to the peppers & onions mix and browned the sausages whole (vs cutting into pieces), other than that, followed the recipe as written. This is such a flavorful & delicious meal! Once it was done in the oven, I sliced the sausages into discs for individual servings. We will certainly make this again!

Yes I didn't use peppers. I added peas to my recipe. It was the way my mother made it. Yes, I will make it again. The first time I made it i used the peppers and also loved it. Didnt have peppers on hand this time. Thanks!

I followed the recipe just as instructed only didn’t have any wine so I used all chicken broth and I added some extra spices and baked it uncovered for 45 min mixing after 25 min in the oven and then again after the 45 min was up. So tasty and came out PERFECT!!! See my pic in the pics above. In love with this recipe!!! This will be a regular dish in my household!!! :)

Added a little garlic to the vegetables and Parmesan cheese at the end of baking.  Only had baby red potatoes on hand & they worked well.

I have made this twice. I did not bake it but rather put it together on the stove top instead. This is my absolute favorite recipe from this site. The combination of all the ingredients make a spectacular Italian flavor. I cut everything up smaller, boiled my potatoes separately and after  frying and removing the meat I sauteed the veggies using extra oil then added back the meat and drained potatoes and extra Italian seasoning and oil and wine. Highly recommend this recipe

Wow!! I made it today with not high expectations and I was mind blown!! I did modify it based on what I had on hand (not much as we were leaving town the next day.) I used golden potatoes. I did several. I used Zesty Italian sausage. I cooked them in thick rounds NOT 2" pieces. I used one red and one white onion. I should have used MORE. I had no bell peppers so I used two jalapeno peppers. I could have used the other two that I had on hand. I used a 50/50 mix of apple cider vinegar and water in lieu of white wine. I added probably half a teaspoon pepper to the broth.  The sauce is AMAZING. I cooked rice afterwards to put the leftover broth (everything else was inhaled by my dinner group of 7.) I will DEFINITELY be making it again and I will use more potatoes, more peppers, more onions. It was AMAZING!
Second time I made more potatoes and used three jalapenos and three bell peppers. I doubled the sauce.

My husband likes hot, so before serving he added some hot jarred jalapeno peppers, which gave the  dish  an extra kick.

I add Barilla pasta sauce from a jar and I use Italian style sliced tomatoes - no wine - no chicken stock and make layers.
It really comes out good. (Serve with a good Italian bread for dipping - Yum)

This is a great recipe.  I did change a couple of things for my family's taste though.   I did not use wine in this, just added more broth.  I also added minced garlic to the pan when cooking the onions and peppers.  I have made this several times and always great!

Both my husband and I enjoyed this recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe called for. It actually tasted better heated back up in the oven on day two of this meal. I think it allowed the flavors to meld together. The bonus of leftovers is when potato is baked twice it makes something called resistant starch that your body can't break down, but your healthy gut bacteria like to feed on (a prebiotic). I am a naturopathic doctor so I know a lot about nutrition.

Delicious! I made this thinking "hey, this will be a simple enough dinner", which it absolutely was, but I did not expect to be soooo tasty!!  Baking the meat and veggies in wine really elevated the dish. I halved the recipe and used hot Italian sausage links. I will definitely be making this again.

Replaced the Italian sausage with chicken sausage.   Not a bad quick dinner option.  I would use less potato and more peppers/onions next time.

Used the ingredients indicated, with the exception being I used vegan sausages. Instead of dirtying a baking dish, I threw everything into an ovenproof skillet and cooked/baked it all in one pan. It’s delicious! This one’s a keeper!!

Turned out great.  Added garlic.  Baked for about 40 minutes then left at 300 for about 30 minutes (because I was chasing children ha). Turned out beautiful and tasted great.  Next time I'll add more vegetables,  maybe carrots.

It makes a lot (good for meal prep), you need a big skillet to cook everything before putting it in the oven. Tastes great, pretty easy, seems healthy too!

I followed the recipe using Turkey sausage.  It was  fairly quick, easy and delicious,  but it made A LOT. Next time I'll probably halve it.

Only reason I make it 4 stars is I don’t like all the browning. I put everything in a baking pan raw. Added lemon pepper, garlic powder, fresh garlic in addition to the Italian spices and salt pepper. It was delightful.

I made it as the directions stated and it was delicious but next time I will only use 2 to 3 potatoes. It was very aromatic throughout the house and very easy to prepare. Everyone loved it!!!

This was real good though it took a bit more time than just stir frying it. I used Butterball Turkey sausage and ‘better than bouillon’ - And the wine in the recipe was a nice touch.  I’d definitely make it again.

This was delicious. I made it as posted. Only thing I would try next time would be to salt the potatoes while browning. Great with bites of sausage but pretty plain by themselves.   Thanks for the recipe. Super easy!

Very good. Used two orange peppers , onions, potatoes and carrots.  Used 10 Italian sausages and had one left but Riley wasn’t here.  Baked about an hour at 375.

Followed the recipe EXCEPT... I didn’t have Italian seasoning and didn’t think 1t would be enough anyway.  So, I used 1/2t each of lemon pepper, thyme, oregano and basil.  Used seasoned salt and fresh rosemary.  Delicious!

We loved it. I prepared the dish the day ahead. I left out the wine and added a bit more stock. The next time I make it I will add more of the spices, it was a little bland for my taste.

I liked it, but It made too much, and my pans weren’t big enough. Pan frying it all before cooking made it too greasy. I think I will l be looking for something I can dump in a pan and bake instead of fussing with before baking, the sauce with the wine and seasonings was tasty.

Very tasty, need to cut down on time.  I cooked in a cast iron pan all at once,  put that in the oven with foil.  Uncovered last 5-10 minutes.

It was good my kids enjoyed it, I used cream of chicken since I ran out of chicken stock.  I will make again to compare the chicken stock to cream of chicken!  I liked the suggestion someone posted about adding mushrooms! I had to cook a little longer to cook potatoes, maybe I cut them to thick!

I didn't think my finished product was very tasty. The sausage was delish, but the vegetables came out soggy. Also seemed cooking the veggies in the same pan as the sausage allowed for too much overall oil in the dish.

When my husband said he liked it several times AND he ate it cold the next day...I knew it was a hit! I do plan to slice the potatoes thinner next time which will cut down on how long the dish stays in the oven. I may also had carrots. My family really enjoyed it!

Loved this recipe!  I halved it and used 1 orange, 1 yellow and 1 red pepper.  I used 1 cup of chicken stock instead of wine.  Super simple and super delicious.  Definitely a keeper.

Delicious! I used those little, golden buttery potatoes, unpeeled, rather than white ones.
Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.
I will make this again. Thank you.

I would recommend and make it again. I've already been making a similar recipe. However this one adds potatoes, broth and wine. My family added mozzarella cheese on top which they said gave the meal even better taste. I just ate mine as is.

Great recipe! I didn't have any wine so I just added extra chicken broth. The whole family enjoyed the meal and asked me to make it again!

I wanted to love it but it was a bit bland - I added garlic, crushed red pepper to give it some zing.  Wasn’t crazy about the potatoes with it, either.  Sorry!  Just personal preference.

I have been making a variation of this dish since 1980 on whitewater rafting trips. I add a pound of bacon and a pound of chorizo and 2 cans of water chestnuts.

This was easy!  The only change I made was deglazing the pan with the wine and broth. Not only did it add extra flavor it made cleaning the pan a breeze.  My husband can be a little picky sometimes but he liked it and I will definitely be making this again!

I did not make any changes. I was as promised, absolutely delish! I did take a little longer to make than anticipated, but probably because I am not a fast chopper and everything needed cutting up.  I don't care for large pieces of veggies. 
The family enjoyed the meal and there were plenty of leftovers.

Great recipe. I used 1 lb of spicy Italian sausage, 4 medium new potatoes, 3 small onions,1 each red, green, and cubanelle peppers. Added 1 clove of garlic to the sautéed veggies. Baked in the oven for 35 minutes. It was plenty for 2 people with leftovers.

The only change I made was to add a 1/2 tsp. of minced garlic, only because we love garlic!  I did cut the recipe down to half, for my husband and me, but added all the wine and stock that the whole recipe called for.  I'll be making it again, for sure!

Maybe 3 1/2. I wanted to love this - didn't. It was time consuming cooking the sausage, potatoes & vegs separately. Browning the potatoes was a waste of time - didn't stay crispy.
If I make this again, I'll leave out the potatoes and cook everything on the stovetop. No advantage I could see to putting it all in the oven - maybe I'm missing something. I added garlic & lots of Italian seasoning, but still didn't get a rich flavor.  Maybe some tomato paste would help. Used a combo of sweet & hot sausages.

I make a similar dish regularly, but portioned for one or two.  I live in Guatemala and found a great sausage that I slice into a frypan, add a medium potato , half onion and peppers.  I add a little olive oil and black pepper and cook over low heat for 30 minutes or so.  Excellent

This recipe was very good. I did substitute a few things. I used sweet potatoes because I did not have regular potatoes. I also used Cajun marinated chicken breast that I pre-cooked. I used chicken apple sausage. I also did not have white wine so I used a dash of red wine vinegar and 1 cup chicken broth. I would definitely make this again.

It was wonderful. I used sweet Italian sausage links, cut into 1/4’s ,as that is what I had on hand. I doubled the stock and wine to have more gravy.
I passed the recipe on to friends and family.

My Italian family has been making this for years but without the liquids. Just some olive oil in the pan mixes with the sausage juices making a creamy texture. Sauté, put the lid on and cook for 20 min. Take the lid off and cook another 10 to Dry it out a little. Served with crusty Italian bread. Hubby’s favorite

I'm familiar with this dish already.
I just want to say
I'll be trying this with My Cajun Seasoning mix.
My seasoning goes over real well on my Wings.
But my crew prefers less robust sausage.
Maybe Kielbasa will be the choice.

I used smoked sausage rather than the Italian sausage, used red potatoes, added cut up carrots, halved the chicken stock, deleted the wine, and cooked it just in an electric skillet without the oven step, and served it over yellow Spanish rice from the boxed mix.  I'm lazy.  :)

Pretty standard and delicious comfort food from one Brooklyn girl to another. The only change that I would make would be to use a little less oil. Also, I find browning the sausages first make it easier to slice them. Maybe it's just me. Anyway, some freshly grated hard cheese of your choice on top and a loaf of Italian bread and it's pure heaven and a walk in the old neighborhood.

I really, really, really cooked the onions and peppers (only red - not fond of the green peppers) - the onions are sweet, the peppers balance everything out - of course, i chopped a few cloves of garlic, too - but I did not use so much olive oil - and I used chicken sausage - perfect-o - with whole wheat Italian bread - try it, you'll like it!!

I made this pretty much as written (except I used a dark beer instead of wine because that's what I had) and my husband and I both ate this right up.  It had a little kick and I even used mild Italian sausage.  Was super yummy comfort food.  Wish the recipe had told me to get a fresh loaf of Italian bread to soak up the "gravy" !!!!

This recipe was tasty. I would make this a breakfast dish. It taste like a breakfast dish that we normally order from the Marriott when we stay. I added all natural mild chicken sausage. I will marinade the sausages in the wine and broth the night before when I make it again. Also, taste this recipe often while making so it will not taste bland.

I live in a part of the world where Italian sausage is hard to find and so I used some Argentinian chorizo sausage (uncooked) instead. Everything else remained the same. 

The dish turned out to be a LOT for two people (would have helped for me to check the portions or "serves X" note) and so I ended up sharing with a lot of people who all loved it. Two days later I had the last of it for breakfast with two sunny side up huevos. Fantastic flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious. Next time I will include either some corn or green beans, carrots or even tomatoes, but it’s also tasty as is. Yes, I will definitely be making it again.

Made this recipe almost as written and it was delicious! It's a bit hot outside and I didn't want to fire up the oven. So, I made everything outside and used my cast iron skillet. I grilled the sausages, sliced them, and added them to the vegetables in my cast iron using the grill's side burner. Since my cast iron is enameled I just let all simmer with the broth and wine, covered, until it was ready. Otherwise, I would have used my grill as the oven. If it weren't hot out, I'd use the cast iron again to transfer it to the oven, making this a one pot kind of meal that is fast and delish! Next time will serve with some Italian bread and a side salad. Thanks for the recipe!

Didn't do the "Italian flare" but rather a "cajun" flare because I had Jalapeno/Cheddar Sausage and Creole seasoning.  Everything else I kept the same.  Husband kept going back for more.  Love it!

Not that this recipe needs another review BUT it was delicious, full of flavor! Couldn't stop eating. 

I didnt have Italian Seasoning, so I threw in some sprigs of Thyme and and chili pepper when cooking the potatoes. For a healthier version, I added thin slices lemon before baking instead of salt. Also purchased Organic Chicken Red Pepper sausage at Whole Foods. Otherwise I followed the recipe!

** made again and added Northern White Beans for a more healthier protein and less sausage and it was surprisingly flavorful as the beans soaked up some of the juice.

This was delicious! Even better the next day! Next time I would probably leave out the potatoes and put it in crunchy bread.

Loved this recipe. I added quartered mushrooms, but basically followed the directions.  The potatoes adsorbed the various flavors wonderfully.  After our first meat we poured off the extra juice and heated the leftovers in the oven for two more delicious meals.

Excellent! Use varying types of Italian sausage and use all chicken broth if you don’t have wine. Most importantly COVER with foil when you put in the oven - it roasts better! Thank you for this recipe!

YUMMY!
We used frozen peppers & onions tho because that's what we had on hand, and I used more veggies since we only had 1lb of sausage.  I also used less wine, and replaced it with a little more broth.

Very nice dish. Sorry- I had to sub some things. I had items I needed to cook or lose & no grocery $ til payday. Had just 1lb sausage; added 1lb uncured bacon. Chopped both in 2” segments. No other changes except added a zucchini I needed to cook.  I hope to make it again as written, but we both found it a tasty, filling, easy to make meal.

My husband loved this. I made it exactly like the recipe, but it would be very easy to add other vegetables to use up what you have. 
My hubby said it "was a keeper". High praise from him!

I adjusted the recipe by increasing the Italian seasoning to 2 teaspoons, and cutting vegetables into smaller chunks in order to reduce cooking time a bit.  Otherwise prepared  according to the recipe.  The meal was simply delicious!  The flavors perfectly blend in your mouth.  I highly recommend this recipe!  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Made per recipe, the only difference was I used baby potatoes cut in half.  I used with good hot sausages that I buy locally.  A definite keeper!

I love this recipe. I have always made sausage, pepper and onion but I have never tried it with potatoes. Yum. 

The only change I made is that  I cooked the Italian sausage on the grill. We love it crispy and browned all the way around. Then I followed the recipe like it says and it is amazing. We had some Tuscan bread with it and we couldn't stop talking about it. 

We will make again and again!

I substituted yellow peppers for green peppers and halved the recipe.  It was delicious.  The two of us had two helpings and there's another meal left over for the two of us.  Great recipe for company.

I made this recipe just like it was written, except I grilled the sausage.  While it was grilling, I continued with the rest of the recipe.  The sausage was done at the same time as the vegetables and potatoes (made completing the recipe so much faster).  Finished the recipe and it was fabulous.  Will make this again.

I made just a few changes. I added lots of garlic with the sauteed onions and peppers. Also, I deglazed the pan with the wine and broth to use the wonderful fond.  Lastly, I served with grated good parmesano reggiano.

Made tonight and loved it.  Cut recipe in half since just two of us, and used all white wine since I didn’t want to open up chicken broth for a quarter cup. Also added some garlic into the mix of veggies when I sautéed them. Can’t wait to make it again.

I've made this 4 times in 4 weeks & I'm still not sick of it.  This last time I omitted the potatoes and it still came out perfect.  As a matter of fact, I'm headed to the kitchen for left overs

I’ve always made my S&P similarly, doing it all on the stovetop & finishing in the oven. This was the first time I tried the addition of the chicken stock & white wine & it really kicked up the flavor!  I brown my sausage whole first, then place in roasting pan I’ll be using to bake in to let it rest (so all the juices won’t run out when sliced).  I sauté the onions & peppers together (I use orange, yellow & green peppers...nice & sweet) I then slice the sausage & put that in the oven to brown a bit while I’m preparing the potatoes (in the same pan the sausage and peppers/onion were in so they can pull up all that delicious flavor).  Take the sausage out of the oven & add the peppers, onions & potatoes. I then deglaze the pan with the wine & chicken stock....scraping up all that goodness on the bottom of pan with a wooden spoon. Poor that over the top & put in the oven. I usually cook 20 mins with foil & 20-30 without, stirring halfway through.  Make sure your potatoes are cut small & uniform. I use the Vidalia Chop Wizard & it makes them perfect size.  I really like the addition of the wine & stock & will be doing that from now on.

DELICIOUS! I used sweet Italian turkey sausage instead of pork and followed the recipe as is. I would suggest to make sure potatoes are done and onions and peppers are soft( unless you like them crunchy) before you add them to your baking dish and season everything generously while cooking/ sautéing. The time in the oven is just to heat everything back up, there is no time for raw veggies to really cook. I used a 3 qt (13x9) Pyrex dish. The liquid on the bottom of the dish is AMAZING!!! So tasty! Will make it again!

I attempted to make this as is...until I realized we didn't have a single sliver of onion in my house...but it still turned out great! In the end, I ended up making a bunch of minor changes. I also threw in some chicken as another person mentioned because I didn't have enough Italian sausage.  I decided to vary my peppers because I had a bunch of yellow, red and orange ones, but only one green one. So, I used one of each color.  The juice definitely makes this dish. I used a whole cup of chicken broth with a splash of white balsamic vinegar. I will definitely be making this again!

Good enough for company! Serve with a loaf of crusty bread.

 This would be a great base to make for sandwiches too. Just leave out the potatoes, then throw your sausage and veggies on a hoagie, top with a slice of provolone or mozzarella and put under the broiler for a minute to melt and brown the cheese. Use the juices for dipping!

Excellent.  My wife is vegetarian so we substituted Soy Chorizo from Trader Joe's which is spicy and wonderful.  The potatoes needed extra cooking, so I recommend cutting them into smaller wedges.

YUMMY!!! I will definitely be making this deliciousness again. I used kielbasa, just because that's what I had, and it was wonderful, but my husband loves Italian sausage, so I think I will definitely try it that way next time. Was thinking stir-fried pineapple would even be the perfect sweet addition if I use kielbasa again! It would offset the savory flavors perfectly I think. Obviously, I look forward to making this numerous ways in the future.

I didn't have white wine, so just used all chicken broth, but rather than just pour it over the meat & veggies, I used it to deglaze the pan first and get all the flavor of those baked on bits ---- sooo tasty! Definitely do that. I used Yukon Gold potatoes and didn't bother peeling them (I never do) and it was perfect. At 25 minutes, the potatoes weren't quite soft, so I upped the temp to 425° and gave it 15 more minutes. Came out just right!

I used my dutch oven for this, lifting out the sausages when they were done, same with the potatoes.  It took longer than stated to soften the potatoes, peppers and onions.  I baked it for 30 minutes and it was perfect.  Will definitely be making again, as it was a nice change from other recipes with sausages.

Very good in my opinion. Unfortunately for me, I didn't measure how much spice I put in so it came out, "spicy." Even though I messed that part up, it still came out good! The bell peppers tasted sweet which completed the spiciness of the sausage I picked out. I salted my potatoes beforehand so I wouldnt have to add excess salt to the dish and they turned out well too. Definitely reccomend for a college student as I now have 4 meals worth of food that tastes good.

Loved it.   Needed to modify to fit whole 30...no wine, extra broth.   Added chopped fresh garlic.   Will add crushed red pepper next time.   A great basic recipe.   Used spicy chicken sausage.   Followed instructions as written cooking the sliced potatoes 10 minutes in skillet.   They finished cooking in the oven and were not mushy.   I layered meat, then potaotes then the onion mixture, then seasonings then poured broth over all, not stirring.

I made this recipe as written with no changes, and it was fantastic - and so simple to make.  I made it to take to a party as a side dish and ended up making another dish of it for myself the next day for my lunches.  I used a mixture of hot and sweet Italian sausage.  Highly recommend.

Sausage needs additional browning prior to baking. It was still pink in the center after 25 min. @400°.

Loved this recipe! I’m sure the original recipient was amazing, but I did make some changes. . . I used Hillshire Farm Beef Sausage instead of pork sausage. I very quickly sautéed the peppers and onions in the same oil that the sausage and potatoes cooked in (I sautéed them on high heat for only about 2 minutes just to give them some color since they would cook a while in the oven). I cooked it 40 mins uncovered, and the potatoes were still a bit firm, so I covered the baking tray with foil and I cooked it another 15 mins. I also added some additional seasonings: onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, cumin, and Montreal steak seasoning. Lastly I added a bit more white wine than the recipient called for (I used Pinot Grigio).

It was delicious. I added a full tablespoon of  Italian seasoning (could have used a little more) and used red and yellow onions. I also cooked the vegetables a little longer allowing for a softer mixture. My family loved it!!

This was very good! I cut the recipe in half, and although the vinegar came through a bit too much, it didn’t take away from the overall flavor of the dish. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has the time.

Definitely a keeper. Followed the directions exactly, but left out the wine and chicken stock as I didn’t have any on hand. I put rosemary in with the potatoes during cooking and it added great flavor! I will say I felt it lacked a little something, I think the chicken stock and wine would have fixed that for sure, but that’s totally on me not the recipe as written. Still 5 stars and I’m sure it’ll be 6 stars with the stock and wine next time. Loved it!

This is similar to what I make in crock pot - but I’ve never used potatoes. Loved this! I used spicy ground sausage instead of links. Made recipe for four servings, added mushrooms and used white cooking wine (no chicken stock) and loved it. Assembled ahead of time, put in cold oven, turned it on to 350 and went to church. Home about 75 minutes later: perfect! Exposed pieces were just starting to get crispy - delicious! Will make again. Thanks.

I’ve been on continual search for one-pot (or skillet) dishes that don’t lose any flavor or consistency by reheating for a second dinner. This one meets that standard and actually tastes better the second time.

I noticed that one reviewer had added hot sausage to it and it was a nice touch with the sweet sausage also I don’t like wine so I doubled up on the chicken stock it was delicious the plus to this recipe was my son liked it and he don’t normally like eating peppers and onion but he wants it again. So this recipe is a keeper for my family.

I have been looking for years for a recipe for this dish and then I came across this one, it was absolutely delicious.  The only thing I did that it did not mention is covering it with foil & I baked it for 40 minutes. Will definitely be making this for the holidays

I made the dish for a large group. I sprinkled aged fresh Parmesan cheese and mixed lightly before baking. I baked with foil to keep the potatoes from drying out. It turned out wonderful. I will make this again.

My husband really liked it. We did not use the white wine, we just added more chicken broth. In the future I wouldn’t skip that. We also think we would’ve used foil. The potato seem to dry because we didn’t bake them with foil over them.

Amazingly good!  Even the kids who normally hate anything remotely vegetable looking gave it the thumbs up.  I did cut down on the peppers and only did one each.  This will definitely make its way into the dinner rotation file!

This recipe is great. I added the potatoes, bell peppers, and onions to a large roasting pan with triple the broth and wine for ten minutes while I browned the sausages. Added the sausage and roasted for an additional 55 minutes. I also added salt, pepper, parsley, and minded garlic right away.

Used turkey sausage.  Baking evaporated the liquid, so it was a bit dry, but very good flavor.

We loved this.  I happened to look up this recipe because I had potatoes , italian sausage and peppers plus some fresh fennel bulb leftover s.  .  Hubby and I both loved it and a match made in heaven with the couple of spicy italian sausages I had on hand.   Will make this again with whatever I  have on hand.  Deelish!!!

It was ok. Not a lot of flavor. 

We ate it, but will not make again.

Well, sort of .....this is a dish my parents made when I was a kid, and I have been making it ever since.  I dont briwn anything, I put everything in the oven and bake for about 90 minutes.  Don’t forget to add some garlic!  Italian comfort food.

I don’t normally review when I change the base flavour but in this case I had to. This was scrumptious with my changes and I’d bet (and seeing the other reviews) it awesome as it is as well! My reason for changing it is simple; I had leftover beef stock and a partial bottle of merlot that were begging to be used up. The merlot gives it a rich savoury flavour! Thanks! This recipe is a keeper!

I made it with some modifications! I added chunks of boneless chicken thighs as well as roasted minced garlic and in addition to the onions, peppers and potatoes (red skin),  I added scallions.  I served with crusty French bread! Delizioso!!!

Prepared 1/2 of recipe using Spicey Itailian sausage. Substituted 1/2 cup of chicken bouillon for broth .  Left overs were even better the next day. Worth the effort.

I made this dish for dinner tonight and my husband and I loved it. I only make half of the recipe, but I did use the amount of wine and broth called for in the entire recipe because I wanted extra juice. I served it with crusty Italian bread to sop up the delicious juices. This is a recipe I will be making again. it was easy, fast and very tasty. 
Thanks for sharing it.

I loved this too! Made it for dinner with friends. It was easy to do all the prep ahead and put it in the oven when we were ready to eat. Only change I made was red wine because I had it. Will definitely make this again, its delicious and looks special for company.

It was sooo good!  Getting through the stages of frying up each ingredient was a little time consuming, but more than worth it. We bought Italian sausage that was packaged in 1 1/4 lb packs and, therefore, used 2 1/2 lbs instead of 2 lb. I think 2 lbs would have been enough. 
A salad and roll added to this made a delicious meal.

I added a chopped jalapeño, we like it spicy. Used mango habanero sausage, that is what I had on hand.
Delicious, will do it again, of course.

I only put in one pound of Italian sausage because that is what we had in the freezer.  I would probably put more meat in next time, along with more potatoes.

I used white potatoes.  After  I baked everything together the potatoes were on the mushy side.  Next time I will probably just put the potatoes in for baking.  Otherwise  -  TOTALLY EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!

This was a delicious meal. Worth taking the time to prep. I made it using mild Italian sausage and followed the recipe as written. Next time I will add garlic. I served it with a crusty garlic bread and it made a great meal!  Umm!

The base recipe told me this would be a good dish, and if I had made it as written, I'm sure it would have still been a tasty treat! I added some garlic, red pepper flakes for spice, used hot Italian sausages, and made sure my chicken stock have some extra flavour by making it myself. I diced my potatoes instead of slicing them (oops!) but it still turned out great. If I'd had the chance, I'd have snapped a picture... but alas, the "not hungry" boyfriend scarfed this down faster than I could even manage to THINK to do so! 

Definitely recommend this to anyone who thinks it'd be good. If you're an amateur cook, here's a tip: make sure your onions are translucent before you start to soften your peppers, that way they aren't raw coming out of the oven! Your broth will thank you when you taste it! :)

Made this and it was very good! Didn’t follow all the directions though. Browned the sausage in my Traeger. Partially cooked the potatoes in the Traeger. Just lightly cooked the peppers in the Traeger. Added all ingredients with the onion wedges to a slow cooker and added red wine and a cup of chicken broth. Cooked on high two hours! Will surely do it again!

My wife and I both liked this recipe.  I substituted the wine with vegetable broth and added 3 diced cloves of garlic.

I will make this again - in fact, it is on next week's menu. The only changes I made were: used ground chicken hot and sweet sausages and after spending all that time browning the potato slices, I did not mix them into the stew but put them on top so they stayed crispy .

The flavour was excellent! We thoroughly enjoyed it and did not change anything, except for cutting the recipe in half as there was only two of us. Will definitely make it again!!!

A lot of work. Taste is nothing to brag about. Times for browning and preparing veggies are way off. Takes more time than it is worth. Definitely missing something in the ingredients. Needs more flavor.

I made this as recipe said and it was very good I will make it again but with some slight changes as suggested by others.  Next time I will add more wine and chicken stock plus not cook the peppers with the onions as they were too soft,( the oven will cook them just fine ) I only made half of the recipe as there is only me and my son (Who really liked it )  This will be a great cold winter night meal served with fresh buns. yummy

Used pre cooked sausage but wouldn't again as it didn't absorb flavors as well. Aside from that this recipe is the bomb! Great flavors, lots of juicy sauce and leftovers may have been even better. This is a keeper.

Excellent!  I cut everything in half except for the liquids and seasoning.  Served over some sliced baguette I wanted to use  up.  Will definitely make again.  I didn't have white wine, I used all broth.  Thank You for sharing.

It was such an easy dish to make, very flavorful, color balanced as well.  I topped it with some Mozzarella Cheese for added flavor and color.  Shared it with my BFF and she totally loved it!

Better instructions are needed.  I found the ingredients list to be too much for my baking platter.  And the timing was way off.  I had to put it all into my turkey roaster.   Next time I make this, I will use two onions and only use one green and one red pepper. To kick up the heat I also threw in some Thai Chili Peppers. A quick tip - cook the potatoes one layer at a time. If you put them all in at once you most likely won't brown all the slices.   Overall I liked how this came out, just cook everything in small batches.

I cut the reciepe  in 1/2 as we are a same family. Used Italian stye chicken sausage and a sweet onion. Still used the liquids for a full reciepe which probably too much, however it was great and will do it again.

I made this dish to use up leftover veggies, using the called for peppers plus added mushrooms and zucchini.  The dish was good but next time I will use Applewood Apple chicken sausages.  Neither my husband cared for the Italian sausage...it was chewy.  But the recipe was easy to make and it was tasty.

Great tasting.  I added chopped garlic and instead of chicken stock, added re wine (same amount)  and stirred the pan to release all the good bits from the bottom.

Easy to make!  Good balance of nutrients and will be tasty to my vegan soldier friend just back from Afghanistan.  I have converted over to chicken sausages and am very pleased with the tastes.  I will do this one again and put it in my trusty standbys.

I altered a bit with no wine and hot Italian sausage from butcher. IT WAS GREAT. My wife loved it and I loved it.  I will definitely keep this one. Thanks for the recipe.

Been making this for years...never realized it was an Italian dish (I'm half Sicilian).  My version is this:  After prepping your veggies, place them in a large ziplock bag, add 1 pkg of onion soup mix with 1/4 cup olive oil, granulated garlic  and paprika to taste, (and any other spices you like); seal and mix well.  Pour into your baking dish (or pot).  I then add 1/2 cup water or stock.  I put whole sausages right on top of the potato mixture, cover and bake at  375 for 45-60 minutes.  That's it.  No muss, no fuss.  Sausages bake very nicely without having to cut them up, although if you prefer them cut, go for it!  And it makes a very nice little gravy from the starch in the potatoes.

So, I have been making this dish for umpteen years. Although this version may be excellent, my recipe may be easier. First, less expensive sausages have more fat, and flavor to add to the potatoes and veggies. Cut everything in smaller sizes so they cook in a reasonable time. Add oil to a big baking pan, add everything and stir every 15 minutes or so. Cook at the temperature listed on this site. I check after about 25 minutes to see how it’s doing. All in all it takes about 40 minutes. No fluids are needed.

I found this recipe a few years ago, marvelous!  I've made it several times, occasionally making small changes depending what I have on hand, doesn't matter, it's always delicious. I personally never add the wine, I use additional stock, still delicious.

I think many of us have some version of this recipe in our box and I am no exception.  It is so versatile, and I usually do tweak it a bit; here are adjustments that k may use:  I usually use a kielbasa, sometimes I leave out the potatoes and serve pasta instead, sometimes I'll sprinkle a little parmesan and/or mozzarella (even cheddar is good too) on top when it's done, sometimes l add fresh basil, I usually just cook it on the stovetop in a large frying pan, I leave out the wine, I do add the garlic, and finally, this makes a great camping breakfast by cracking a few eggs on top when it's done and cook on low for a few minutes, covered, til the eggs are cooked through.  
So versatile!!  So delicious!!  So easy!!

Mom made this often, and always for New Years Eve.  But we never used chicken broth, frequently substituted thin cut pork chops instead of sausage, and always used vinegar peppers.  This, some good Italian bread, and a nice salad.  I tried it your way,but prefer it with less liquid.  So a little wine, but no broth.

I never weigh/count out the potatoes, sausage, onions or peppers.  I just put in what I feel like and/or have.  Everything else I follow to the tee.  I have used different variations of sweet, mild and hot italian sausage and love them all. I have made it about 20 times and it's always delicious!

We like this better every time I make it. It's easy to alter the ingredients to whatever you do or don't have. If I don't have wine I just substitute more chicken broth. I also use Jimmy Dean Italian Sausage and shape it into meatballs instead of using links. Ten minutes before it's done I put either a cup of cherry tomatoes or several quartered tomatoes for extra flavor (or just to use up garden produce). Also, I use whatever types of sweet peppers I happen to have on hand.

My hubby who isn't a veggie person thought that was the best part of the meal! Next time I'll try another type of sausage, not hot italian and will definitely cut the veggies smaller.  Only change was more chicken stock and no wine!

Flavor was ok, I may try again with a different sausage and skip the skillet cooking and increase oven time as others suggested. Potatoes were not done after 25min, but sausage was a little tough with the double cooking

Today I added mushroom and I used Greek seasoning because I was out of Italian seasoning.

I have to give this a 5 star since I have made this several times and it’s always a hit!  If there are any left overs...there’s bound to be a fight.  I double and triple the recipe and add a combo of sweet and hot sausages to please everyone.  I also only use red, yellow and orange peppers since I find many people can’t tolerate green peppers.  Great for a crowd, great for a potluck.

Good but felt like I needed to cook it so long for potatoes, onions and peppers to be the right texture.

This was super easy and turned out delicious! I didn’t need as much as it made so I reduced the veggie portions some but went ahead and used the liquids as listed. I loved the extra juice because I used veggie protein sausage and then served it over quinoa. Definitely recommend!

I made this for dinner the other night. it was Okay.  Pretty much roasted veggies with some sausage.  I recommend taking the casings off of the sausage, it was kind of tough.

Great recipe...I chopped the potatoes because it took too long to cook them. I also used red wine instead of white and added garlic to the potatoes while cooking them.

I've been looking for a long time for a recipe that tastes like this....I followed the recipe exactly, except for a few things.  I drizzled the italian sausage with olive oil and cooked it in the oven for about 40 minutes, then cut it in pieces and proceeded with the recipe.  The result was excellent.  Because we are garlic lovers, I also cut up a few cloves of garlic and put it in the last 1 minute or so when cooking the potatoes, peppers, and onions .  The potatoes browned really well without getting soggy or greasy.  I sliced the peppers into medium strips and cut the onions and potatoes in small quarters.   Will definitely make again!  Next time I may add a small amount of red pepper flakes for a little kick.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Beccabo 73!

This is the very first recipe I ever made and saved on Allrecipes and it is a family favorite! I have changed it up a few times out of necessity to avoid waste..like even a not too fond of red wine, left over beef broth or added veggies like zucchini but the original recipe is fantastic!! If you find your sausage is not so flavorful, I have tried adding some fennel seeds or crushed chillies.

I loved it. It was so flavorful and easy to make. Even my 5yr old niece who is a notoriously picky eater ate it up quickly. The only change I made was subbing the wine for more chicken broth because I didnt have any wine. I dont know if that made a big difference to the taste, but it was excellent as is.

Well, yes, I used deer sausage instead of Italian sausage links since we always have lots of deer meat.  And it was pretty tasty, I must say.  I didn't use the white wine because I was out of white wine.  But didn't change anything else.  I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely 5 stars for sure.  My family has made a version of this for years.  I decreased the recipe to feed 4 and used sun dried tomato chicken sausage, but otherwise followed the suggested recipe ingredients exactly.  I saw no reason to keep the liquid ingredient measurements the same as for 8 servings when halving the recipe as some have suggested, as there's no real need for additional liquid.  After removing the onions and peppers to a casserole dish, I deglazed the fry pan with the wine and broth.  This is an extra step that really shouldn't be skipped.  Great comfort food dinner!

Not too shabby. I made mine in the Instant Pot so I didn't have the issue with hard taters, Precious. I used the saute function for the sausage, removed and cut the sausage and removed the casings. Threw in the potatoes and peppers and sauteed for a bit. Then put the sausage back in, put the IP on high for 10 minutes, natural release for 5 minutes, and it was great.

Fantastic! Although I made it with vegan sausages and no wine. Everything else was kept the same. One thing though, I noticed that after 30 minutes of baking the potatoes were slightly burning on the edges but they weren't soft so I covered the dish with foil and cooked them another 15-20 minutes. That did the trick!

This was okay, but had way too many steps in my opinion...probably would simply cook the sausage in the toaster oven, then slice when cool.  Potatoes could also be roasted beforehand, then meat, potatoes , veggies, liquids & seasonings could be combined and roasted together for 20-30 minutes.   The outcome was okay, but a little bland for my tastes.  I pre-cooked potatoes so they wouldn’t be hard, and overall texture of potatoes & veggies was fine, but it just seemed bland.  Might benefit by more garlic & italian seasoning, or maybe using hot Italian sausage?  Not sure what was missing, but I thought it was okay at best.  Everyone else liked it and ate  it reasonably well, but I thought it was meeehhhh...

This dish was exactly what I was craving.  I halved the recipe and everything about it hit the mark.  I used sweet italian sausage (with fennel) and followed the instructions in this order:  browned the sausage, removed the grease from the pan and cooked the peppers and onions in the  drippings adding a small amount olive oil to the pan. After I removed the vegetables, I added about a 1/4" of oil then fried the yukon gold potatoes till golden.  I doubled the chicken broth and left out the wine.  I did not have an italian seasoning blend, so I used a couple of shakes each of dried basil, oregano and parsley. I tossed everything together in a bowl before turning in into the baking pan. The sausage had great flavor, the peppers and onions were sweet and the potatoes were dense and almost creamy. There was just the right amount of moisture from the broth.  This was a winner! It's going to a regular in my house.

This is a staple in our house!! I use mild italian sausage or even brats sometimes. I do pre-cook the sausages in the oven then slice and add to the other ingredients so the casing doesn't strangle the cut pieces when they're cut raw.

Great dish, has become a regular for our house.  I use half sweet potatoes and half gold or red.  Also add a little red crushed pepper for a kick.

I would suggest either cutting the potatoes thinner or microwaving them prior to adding them to the skillet.  Mine were still hard after baking.

I am not Italian so I have no experience with this dish. I found it to be flavorful and hearty. The flavors were good but it was a lot of work before putting in the oven. Not worth it to me so I probably won’t make it again.

Tasted amazing! I had to quadruple the recipe as I am cooking for a large gathering. Skipped the white wine, added Cajun spice, ground hot pepper (dried scorch bonnet pepper) and rosemary, it was perfect! Spicy but the peppers and onions gave it a sweetness. Will be cooking this again for sure.

I made this tonight. It was just me and my partner so I kind of guessed the ingredient  amounts. I must say it was indeed very yummers.  I will do this again with a better sausage as the one I had seemed more like a bloody weiner but in all the flavors were again, yummers. Thank you .

I tweaked it a bit to take care of the hard potatoes - cook 15 minutes, to take care of overcooked peppers and onions - lightly saute them for about 2 minutes.  And I've never been a big fan of dried spices so I usually try to make this when I have fresh basil, oregano, and rosemary in the house - that will take care of "bland".  The only other thing is add a bit of garlic with your veggies while sauteeing them - it warms the dish a bit.   As far as number of steps - seems pretty reasonable and not much more than other dishes.

I used both sweet mild sausage and spicy hoy sausage... I didn't have wine so I increased chicken stock to 3/4 cup. I dislike peppers and onions, I don't like the taste and won't eat them but I'll cook with them. This dish was A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.!! I absolutely loved it, so much flavor, and was filling! It was a nice change from what I usually make. This will definitely be something I make again. My family loved it too. Oh, I also added about a tblsp of minced garlic in the olive oil while cooking the potatoes.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit! Not only very easy to make but tastes pretty great too. I followed ingredient list except I added 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic to the veggies when they were being cooked on the skillet. I also used turkey sausage instead of any spicy or sweet beef sausages and it worked really well for this dish! I actually think next time I will sauté those right after the sausage as the potatoes lacked some of that flavor I was hoping they had. Also, I only used two onions and that was still wayyyyyyy too much; I love onion but wow! Next time I will cut that back to just one large onion so it doesn’t overpower the dish. It’s a wonderful dish and many thanks to OP for this new family favorite :)

It's good, but I'd recommend adding more meat if this is going to be a main dish. Adding garlic is also a plus! I saved a little time by roasting the potatoes in the oven while the sausage and other vegetables cooked in the skillet.

I loved this recipe.  I did add about 1 tbs of tomato paste toward the end of cooking time.  It just added an additional depth of flavor.  I keep tomato paste in a tube to add to recipes such as this.  Thanks for sharing

This made a delicious brunch dish. I made with Merguez,  Moroccan beef and lamb sausage. I omitted the wine but doubled the broth. The children  don't  like cooked bell pepper so I used half the amount only. I had to cook the potatoes in 2 batch to have them in a single layer and speed the Browning. We will be making again soon.

Nice recipe. However, you can use much less oil when browning the potatoes by parboiling them first. That was my only change.

I feel bad rating this, because I changed it so much, but I searched for a "baked sausage, pepper, onion, potato recipe" this came up, but there were so many steps in the skillet first. I didn't have time. I had already cooked Italian Chicken sausage, finger link potatoes, peppers and onions.  I used this recipe as a base. I put potatoes in microwave for 4 minutes. I sliced them not too thin, along with peppers and onions. I used 2 red, 1 yellow and 1 orange pepper. I seasoned them with olive oil, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, little red pepper flakes and some Mrs. dash table blend. I tossed in a bowl and added the sausage. I used a small individual (airplane bottle) of white wine.  I foil lined 9x13 dish and cooked in 400 degree oven for 45 minutes. Everyone loved it.

This was fine, nothing too exciting or special though. It seemed kind of like a soup but without as much broth. We served it with a little parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.

This was delicious. The only change I made if you really would call it one is to cut the sausage into small bites and cook them that way. I will make this again for sure,

I diced the Italian sausage to consistency like ground beef.   I also diced the potatoes , onion and only used red bell peppers.  I also used red wine instead of white wine (which seemed to me to go better with sausage).  We have this every week and my husband loves it!

This recipe was delicious, everyone in my household loved it. I didn't have Italian sausage on hand so I used what I had, which was beef smoked sausage. It still came out tasting really good. I did add a little cyenne pepper, garlic powder and a little minced garlic sprinkled in. I will be making this again using Italian sausage links.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  My step-son, who normally doesn't care for potatoes, loved this dish.  We served some sour cream on the side for anyone who wanted it on their potatoes.  This would be a good dish to bring to a potluck.  If we ever serve this with company over, we might add pierogies on the side as a nice complement, in addition to a garden salad.  We browned each item separately and substituted Goya Adobo seasoning for the salt.  Outstanding!

This has some great bones, but like most recipes, can be adjusted to your individual taste.  I pre roasted my potatoes, with olive oil and onions and garlic and Italian seasoning.  I heated up both regular sausage and spicy sausage with some red peppers and some more Italian seasoning.  I put the roasted potatoes in a 13x9 pan, stirred in the sausage and peppers, deglazed the pan with some white wine, and baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes... YUMMY

Delicious! Based on what others said about the potatoes taking longer than the 20-25 mins bake time to be done, after I browned them, I popped them in the oven on a sheet pan for about 8-10 mins while I finished up the onions and peppers. That seemed to get everything done at the same time after it was all recombined and baked. I didn't have Italian seasoning, so I used basil, oregano and thyme. Also, hubby picked up raw breakfast links vs. Italian sausages (he tried, bless his heart!), so I seasoned them with same mix as above, and they worked just fine. Thanks so much!

My husband loves this dish. Sure it has a few steps, but once it's in the oven I can clean up. I just make a veg ,warm a slice of sour dough bread and he calls this a comfort food.  Don't cut the potatoes too thick (I did mine about 1/4 in.) and brown them well, they'll cook up nicely. To save time I throw the onions in while browning the sausage. My husband doesn't care for cooked green peppers so I omitted them. The first time I made it I forgot the Italian seasoning so I don't bother since he loved it the way it was,  Cooking the sausage in the broth and wine gives the whole dish a great flavor.  It's definitely in my rotation.

I didn't have white wine so used chicken broth. It was absolutely delicious!!! Will try white wine in it next time but this was worth the steps to make. My husband and 13 year old son loved it too. I scaled back the recipe to 6 and have only enough leftovers for 1. Next time will do full recipe as we depend on leftovers for lunches!

It was delicious and perfect tasting. The potatoes took extra to get done though. Next time I'd maybe bake them for about 30 minutes  first. Perhaps while the other vegetables and sausage are sauteed. I will definitely be making it again!

This was fabulous! My boyfriend smelled it as he was coming up the stairs and hoped it was coming from our apartment! I used red, orange & yellow bell peppers-only change I made. There was enough leftover for the next nite and it was even more flavourful! Leaving out the sausages will make it a fave on Meatless Mondays too. Seriously recommend trying this one!

This recipe is so good.  The next time I'll add more peppers and maybe use chicken legs so everyone gets some sausage and chicken.  I will be making this often.

I made exactly as written . The family loved it. Will make again. A lot of prep but worth it. Also I did cook the potatoes a bit longer in a garlic olive oil (trader joes).

I love this recipe!  And I'm not even a fan of peppers.  But the flavor is spectacular.  Love that its cooked in white wine.  My only change is that I use Italian chicken sausage.  The ladies that work for the butcher I go to told me to try it...they prefer it to pork or turkey sausage.  I have to say that I'm sold on it.  But back to the recipe...definitely in my top 10!

i made this recipe the other day. It was good, but I found it watery.
I make my family recipe, which is pretty similar, except for I do it all in a frypan.  Just oil, sausage, potatoes, green pepper, salt, pepper and oregano.

We loved this dish!!!! I made some changes after looking over some of the reviews. I took a suggestion from another reviewer and cooked the potatoes in the oven 27 minutes before adding the other ingredients (20 minutes @ 425, 7 minutes on broil to brown them  a little ) . I added a little minced garlic , Italian seasoning, oregano , thyme, Cajun  seasoning , lawrys seasoning salt, adobo , and  1/4 cup of olive oil. I stirred the potatoes, seasoning, & oil and let it cook while I cut the the other veggies (onions, red peppers & green peppers). In addition, I used both mild ground Italian sausage & hot Italian links. I browned  the links in the oven and the ground sausage in a pan with one of the onions to unlock some flavor . I set the sausage aside. When I finished prepping the other ingredients, I added them to the potatoes that were cooking in the oven. I put the 1/2c of wine , 1/2c chicken broth, tablespoon of cornstarch, tablespoon of flour, a little mayo, a little hidden valley ranch , a little Lawrys seasoning salt, and a little Cajun seasoning in a bowl and mixed it all up. I poured the mixture over the the sausage , potatoes, peppers and onions . I placed the dish in the oven , taking it out periodically to stir. I baked it a little longer until the veggies were to my desired tenderness.

My husband and I both give it a thumbs up.  The only thing I did different was used very small baby carrots instead of red peppers.   I roasted them on the stove with the potatoes. Easy and tasty, I will be making again.  This dish would be perfect for a potluck party  I am looking forward to bringing the leftovers to work.  .

Excellent meal as written. I followed the recipe to the letter and have made it several times. Everyone in the house enjoys it and my daughter can be picky at times. 

Changing a recipe and then rating it is unfair and dishonest because it is not the submitted recipe, it becomes YOURS.

Definately a keeper.  I  made 1/2 the recipe and omitted the white wine and broth, instead used 2 tbsps of balsamic vinegar and 2 tbsps water.   Hubby loved it and it was gone in minutes.

I used bulk Italian sausage since that's all I had on hand.   Once done baking I broiled a few minutes just to crisp top, this was amazing!   Both my kids, husband and company loved this too.  Everyone was asking for the recipie.

This was very good and easy to prepare.  I used half the amount of onions and peppers and added mushrooms.  Maybe next time I'll serve it on some garlic and black pepper pasta.  It was satisfying but needed just a little more of something.

This was super easy! I'm a beginner and also live by myself. I barely know how to boil water and I'm trying to teach myself to cook so I have so other options rather than Ramen noodles and Kraft Mac and Cheese! 
I also didn't use wine as I read others didn't as well...I keep my wine for drinking ??. Instead I used a 1/2 cup of chicken broth (instead of stock) and 1/2 cup of beef stock that I had on hand. I think I used much more olive oil than the recipe called for. But it came out delicious!

This is phenomenal!! I made it just as the recipe called for with the exception of adding a  few more red potatoes- it was sooooo good. I used Barefoot Pinot Grigio for the white whine the recipe called for :) This is a keeper and I will definitely make again!!!!

Excellent recipe!  I changed a few things, though. I added Chardonnay to the sausage after about half the cooking time to deglaze. I added salt and pepper to the potatoes and onion & peppers  as they were cooking. I also added a can of tomato paste to the broth and wine before baking. I had to extend the cook time by about a half, but the result was incredible! So happy to have found this recipe! Thanks!

This was fabulous! The only change I made was because I didn't have peppers on hand. I used zucchini instead just to include a vegetable. I made extra and there was none leftover. My whole family said, make this again ANYTIME!

This had great flavor. Four of us almost finished a heaping 9X13 pan. I added some other veggies (carrots and celery) because I love veggies, but it would have been great without them. I also took another reviewers suggestion and oven-browned the potatoes in oil in the baking dish while I was cooking the sausage and onions and I didn't pre-cook the peppers.

Too heavy but good tasting. Assume it will be tastier when reheated. Needed carrots or green beans.

I substituted vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  My husband is allergic to chicken.  I also added more potatoes and cut them smaller so they would cook faster.  This does take about and 1-1/2 to complete due to all the steps it takes.  Make things easier on yourself and buy frozen cut up peppers in the frozen aisle.  So much quicker!  Overall everyone liked this dish and I may make it again if I have time.

This was very good but I found it was better to cover the baking dish before putting it all in the oven. The potatoes simply did not get cooked all the way through after 20 minutes. Either that or they have to be in the frying pan a lot longer than 10 minutes. I followed the recipe totally except I covered it during the baking process because potatoes were still too hard for my taste.

I expected to be wowed by this recipe and I just wasn't. It seemed to be very greasy. Maybe I didn't use good sausage; might try again sometime. It was a very pretty dish .

I didn't know how a recipe this simple could be so delicious, like the reviews said, but it really is. I think it's the wine and italian seasoning that make it great. I made it exactly as the recipe directs and wouldn't change a thing. Just be careful not to put too much salt as the sausage and chicken broth already have salt.

This was awesome! I was originally going to make this but get busy at work , just didn't have time. But! My husband cooked this and it was amazing! He cooked it by sautéing  the veggies and sausage cut in chunks with little evoo and seasoning. Cooked so nice and tender but with a slight crunch. Roasted the potatoes, quartered, in the oven then mixed the potatoes with the veggies. Yummm.....I couldn't stop eating it! He did such a great job!

The only change I made is the cooking time once in the oven.  It took 45 minutes not 25 minutes to get the potatoes tender enough to eat.  Other than that it was tasty.  I will make it again but not with so many peppers.

Love this...so, so good. I make this with fully-cooked chicken or turkey sausage...dietary necessity for me : / ...and often add additional veggies, so do alter the method somewhat. I definitely don't pre-cook softer veggies such as bell peppers, or zucchini, if used...just pre-cook veggies like celery, onion, potato, carrot. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this exactly as written.  It had all the ingredients the males of my family like.  Husband had seconds.  Having to cook all the ingredients beforehand increased the time to make the dish, especially the potatoes.  I will make this again, but to taste the salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning more, I will  put the veggies in a large bowl and season them all together thoroughly before adding them to the sausage in the baking dish.  It was difficult to  distribute the seasoning adequately once everything was already in the  casserole dish.

This recipe lends itself to a variety of vegetables. I ended up adding zucchini and eggplant because I had them on hand. We used Chicago's own Bobak's brand sausage - it's the best! Be sure to give the potatoes long enough in the pan; I rushed them and some were undercooked.

Was delicious. I changed this so much I'm hesitant to review.Almost created a new recipe.Would give 5 stars otherwise. Apologies to the submitter. However it turned out great! I used 1 red and 1 yellow pepper. Found I had NO chicken or vegetable stack (Yikes!) so used left over wine. No potatoes so used Faro. 1 and 1/4 pounds of Chicken thighs and Chicken sausage. Cut Chicken to bits size piece and cut sausage in to 1/2 " pieces. Baked with Parmesan cheese topping. Smells great!

I made it when we had people over for supper. They loved it. I followed the recipe to the letter. The only two things I  would do differently the next time would be to cut the sausage in smaller pieces (had a little pink in the center) and do a better job of draining every thing before placing in baking dish.

I found this on a whim, I was looking for a recipe to make with ingretdents I had in the fridge.  It was delicious, quick and easy. I added red pepper flakes, and subbed out the white wine for a bit more chicken broth then topped it with cheddar cheese. It reheated wonderfully the next day. I added eggs to it the next morning. Thanks for the recipe!

I never follow a recipe exactly unless it is for a baked good.  Sooooo, I subbed cheap merlot red wine, a different kind of sausage, never measure anything....I even changed the method of cooking; I  microwaved the potatoes first, then browned in a fry pan--MUCH faster. The addition of minced garlic, about two cloves at the end of the saute for the veggies and sausage, added some flavor.  I liked the result, and there is enough for a second meal for the two of us.  My husband suggested I make something else, so I guess he didn't like it as well as I did.

This dish has a delicious flavor and my family and I loved it. The only thing I will do next time is precook the potatoes in the microwave. The cooking time was not long enough to cook them fully and I had to put the dish back in the oven for another ten minutes.  It already took about an hour to make this dish and the kids were hungry and waiting for it to be done, but undercooked potatoes are not a good thing.

I grew up in an Italian household and my mother would make this in a pressure cooker.  I have since made it for my family, only due to allergies I had to omit the peppers.  1/2 the cooking time and more flavor .

This is a wonderful recipe. I bought spicy Italian & sweet Italian sausage from the butcher counter. They were pretty big so I just used two links (one of each) as it's just my husband and I. I used 4 cloves of garlic, half an onion, 3 small red potatoes and half of a green & red bell pepper. I kept the chicken broth, white wine, & spice measurements the same. I made sure my pan was very hot to brown/sear the sausage, I also cooked the sausage & potatoes in batches to ensure a good browning. Baked as directed for 20 mins uncovered and then covered the pan w foil and baked for another 10 mins (I didn't think my sausage was done all the way.) The results were great! My husband and I both loved it. I will definitely be making this again.

I am not a huge fan of Italian Sausage,but my husband loves it so we have it weekly.I've  used this recipe multiple times. Sometimes exactly as written. But often I am in a hurry and skip the browning of potatoes and veggies. Have even just thrown all ingredients in a crockpot with no browning. Always comes out great. Serve it up with a loaf of crusty bread to soak up the sauce.

I could have sworn I had Italian sausage in my freezer. Instead, I only had Bratwurst.  So that is what I used.  I did not use the additional 1/4 cup of oil and the potatoes browned up beautifully with only a few teaspoons of olive oil used in the first step.   No wine either, just the chicken broth. The Brats added great flavor to the potatoes and vegetables. Maybe next time, I will use a mix of both Italian and brats sausages.   Thanks for the recipe.

Wow. So good. I was surprised how good the potatoes were. I added garlic that I roasted, mushrooms and Italian spices. I used red wine because that's what I had and 1 lb of hot Italian sausage and 1 lb of ground beef. I cooked everything on the stove top a couple days before and popped into oven, 375 for about 35 min. My peppers were a bit overlooked so I won't fry them as long next time. And I think one pound of Italian sausage would be fine. Although this dish could easily stand on it own, I Served it with kale salad and garlic bread.

Great recipe.  The first time I made it without any additions/substitutions, there weren't any leftovers.  The second time I added different seasonings, made it too hot, and had plenty of leftovers.  This is one of the few recipes on here that you don't need to mess with.  One of or favorites!

This is a great recipe. I've been making variations of this dish for years and this recipe was spot on. The only changes I made were instead of Italian seasoning, I chopped three cloves of fresh garlic and added salt pepper oregano and Parmesan. It was delicious!!

This was more flavorful than I expected! I only write a review if I  make a recipe exactly as written. I too,  halved the original.  Next time , I think I'll add a can of tomatoes and some garlic. This will be a regular for leftover fried potatoes. Very good.

Great recipe!! I have a bumper crop of peppers this year and this recipe is a perfect way to enjoy them. I did include banana peppers and though good as is, the next time I will spice it up with a chili pepper. My only issue with the recipe- the bake time is way off  This dish needs at least 45 minutes in the oven, covered. This will allow the veggies to cook and the flavors to meld.

Browsing through recipes for something different and decided to give this a try.  Honestly, sausage makes me gag, so it was a leap of faith to attempt this!  I followed the recipe as is, but I didn't put as much onions and peppers as it asks for and it was just fine. I also heated the wine and broth in the pan after all the veggies, scraping up all the yummy bits and making it easier to clean the pan, too.  I took it out to the field for a harvest supper, and the 3 men all liked it!  I thought the flavours were great, though I only ate the potatoes and veggies! I will definitely add this to my "meals-in-the-field" list as it was easy to take along. Note: I used a 13"x9" dish and it was very full even with less peppers and onions, so I'll use a slightly bigger dish next time.

I have made this at least 3X and the family loves it.  I always make extra for another meal.  I use  whatever peppers I am in the mood for. The only change I made was adding sliced mushrooms with the peppers and onions.

This dish was fantastic!  Great for a dinner main ingredient, or leave out the potatoes and serve as sandwiches.  I've made it a few times, once with rice instead of potatoes, and it's definitely better with the potatoes.

Halved the recipe, but followed it except for the wine, substituted with more chicken broth. It took much longer to brown sausage and potatoes then as stated.  In fact, I microwaved sliced potatoes for 5 minutes before browning in pan.   Bottom line... delicious!

This is really good! I cut the recipe in half, only used green pepper since that is all I had on hand, and added 1/2 large zucchini (cooked it separately after the potato before the onions and pepper). I also added 1 Tsp minced garlic. I put the white wine and the chicken broth into the pan with the onion, pepper and garlic to deglaze it first, and then poured it into the casserole dish. Baked for only 20 minutes and it was perfect!

Followed the recipe mostly, except I used only one red & one yellow bell pepper, 2 large potatoes & 1/2 onion.  Turned out very good.  Will be adding a little more potatoes the next time I make it though.

Way too much time for the result.  I am going back to making my sauteed peppers and onions while grilling the sausage outside.  So much easier, less cleanup and just as good.

We ended up deep frying the potatoes and using spicy sausage from Costco. I also made chicken stock out of Better than Bouillon. We used our cast iron and baked it. It was phenomenal. We also used only chicken stock because we didn't have any cooking wine on hand.

Huge success! Will add this to our recipe rotation. I followed the directions exactly and everyone loved it. The only change I would make is to season the Potatoes, Peppers and Onions as you are browning to give more flavor versus waiting until everything is in the pan to go in the oven.

Delicious!! I just made this for two people, so I halved everything (except the liquid items), added a half stick of butter and garlic powder before I put it in the oven and this turned out delicious!!

Followed the recipe  exact except to add a little garlic ,  and made sure the potatoes were cooked before putting in the oven, turned out delicious.  The peppers and onion still firm,  fresh tasting , spicy with the hot sausage and not greasy at all.
My son said it the best "Italian goulash " he's had.

I agree with all that the flavor was awesome on this HOWEVER.......make sure potatoes cook correct. I followed recipe to a tee and some of our potatoes were hard. I even microwaved the potatoes for 5 minutes before cooking them in the pan. Disappointing but will cook longer next time.

This was great!  I have always made this dish, minus the liquid, on the stove top and would of never thought to finish it off in the oven.  It dirties another dish, but it was much easier this way and absolutely yummy!  I halved the recipe since it made plenty for the two of us, and used everything the recipe stated except I added in a few cloves of garlic chopped up, along with a dash of chile flakes while sauteing.  I also normally always use smoked sausage but italian sausage is great too.  The directions are where I changed it up a bit.  First, I added in the onions and peppers with the sausage to brown.  That way this eliminated an extra step since they all will brown and cook up at about the same amount of time.  I also add in the seasonings here to release their flavor while sauteing.  After removing the sausage, I then added in the potatoes to nicely brown and before removing them from the pan, I added in the liquid to scrape up all those yummy bits in the skillet leftover.  Then I poured it all in the 13x9 baking dish together.  I baked an additional 15 min. longer than stated, to make sure all the liquid was evaporated and it left a nice concentrated flavor leftover and wasn't soggy.    If you don't have white wine, more chicken broth can easily be substituted.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!  I will for sure make it this way again!

This was/is very, very good and easy.  I didn't have any sausage so I followed recipe as stated leaving out the sausage of course and I used green, red and yellow bell peppers and I topped it off with cheese the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Excellent dish thank you for sharing your recipe with us.

This recipe was amazing!! I left out the white wine because my husband isn't a fan and it still tasted incredible.  I used a colorful mix of peppers and I think that made the dish a little sweeter, which was perfect.  Definitely becoming a regular on our menu.

I've made this dish a few times.  It is a nice change from the Mama Corleone recipe I usually make (found on allrecipes).  Day 1 the meal is very good, day 2 the meal is excellent.  I kept thinking that it needed one more ingredient to put it over the top.  I sprinkled shredded romano cheese on top and it was perfect!

This is a fantastic recipe for italian sausage. I made it exactly as it was written. I used a braiser to cook it and was a little worried that I wouldn't be able to fit the lid on it. Makes a lot of delicous food! I'll definitely make this again.

Very tasty.  I made it with turkey sausage and it was great!  My husband loved it too!  Cut the potatoes thin or they will not be done in time with the rest of the meal.

This is absolutely delicious.  I made mine entirely with hot sausage and also added some fresh garlic.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing! I can't believe I forgot to rate it after the first time I made it.  It's a cold miserable day here, and I can't wait to smell it roasting in my oven tonight!

This is wonderful! It  is almost the same as the meal my Italian Grandmother made with some new variations. If you cook with fresh ingredients,  the preparation is going to take a little longer. You can always prep the night before. I did add some squash that I wanted to use up, but I'm sure other veggies could be added.

My Italian mother made a version of this but all done on a stovetop.  I found this oven method and it came out very similar and especially yummy.  I will definitely repeat this method.  Actually , better and healthier.

Concept is awesome.
Starting the potatoes in a skillet is smart, browning already pre cooked sausages not so much.
I started using my cast iron skillet and was almost finished with the veggies when I realized why not just put everything into the skillet, sauce it and put into oven.
I will be doing this again, minus the 3 extra bowls and pans

Didn't fry anything...just added the potatoes, peppers and onions to a sheet pan, drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with the Italian seasoning. Baked / roasted for 20 minutes. While the vegs baked, I grilled the sausage until half way cooked, cut into pieces and then added to the sheet pan with the broth and wine. Cooked another 20 minutes and viola! An outstanding dinner!

This is such a great meal. My husband's new favorite. After making exactly as stated in the recipe a few times, I decided to change things up a bit . I add some heavy whipping cream,  red wine vinegar, cayenne pepper and basil to the "sauce". After I fry everything, I transfer to my large iron skillet and simmer on stove top instead of baking. It's so delicious, it's on our weekly dinner list.

Made this exactly as described and it was really just okay.  Not sure what all the fuss about as it's a lot of work to pre-cook and bake for what to me turned out to be just a some roasted veggies with fried sausage.  I can say the sausage was the best part. Will not be repeating this one.

Our new favorite recipe! What a wonderful blend of flavors. I didn't have any white wine so I used all chicken broth. Also, for depth of browning and flavor I added a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce along with garlic powder while frying peppers and onions. Next time I'll try it with the wine and add some minced garlic. Hubby wants this once a week..so do I!!

Oh My!! Simple and fabulous. Great combination of flavors. And I found I didn't even need to use the extra 1/4 cup of olive oil to cook the veggies in. A definite keeper. Thanks for the great recipe!! ??

This recipe took a little time with the browning of the sausage and veggies but with the browning, came the flavor. I changed nothing other then using HOT sausage. This is a great recipe for a crowd for sure and I can see why this wonderful dish disappears at any party.

I have made this recipe several times since discovering only a few months ago. Love it! It is such good comfort food. I don't change anything, really. Just cook the potatoes for several minutes, then add the onions and peppers to the same skillet to finish. One less step. Definitely worth the time, and minimal effort. Thank you for sharing!

Excellent recipes. I used 4 chicken sausages, 1 red pepper, 1 onion, a few potatoes. I fried the sausage with the pepper and the onion at the same time, in the same pot. Then I put everything in an over tray on top of the raw (just peeled and diced) potatoes. Put some chicken broth on the bottom of the tray, and skipped the wine. This is a very abbreviated version of the original, but I have kids so I was in a hurry :) Regardless, it turned out delicious. Kids ate the sausage, my husband and an unexpected guest finished the whole thing. It's in my 'keepers' collection now. Thanks to the person who posted this. You must use the sweet red pepper and the onion to get the best taste, it's a must.

My  family RAVED about  this recipe!  It required a little preparation, but  is well-worth it.    To add more vegetables I added canned green peas.  Just the right touch.  YUM!

This was SO GOOD!! Everyone loved it. Next time I will double the recipe to send for lunches :) The only thing I'll definitely do differently next time is to cook the sausage BEFORE I cut it up... Trying to cut up a bunch of raw, slippery sausage links was the most frustrating and time-consuming part.

This meal was so super easy to make.  Flavor was outstanding and I served it to my family.  They were impressed and will most definitely make again and again.   I recommend the recipe for a big gathering, people will walk away satisfied.

I use a lot less oil than it calls for.  Cuts easily in half.   I also use gourmet sausages (sometimes 2 different kinds) when available.

My mom and her husband loved this.  (He bought 10 lbs of brats recently, so I substituted those for the Italian sausage.)   The peppers and onions added great flavor, but were in large enough pieces that my mom, who doesn't like either, could eat around them.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Didn't have white wine so used one cup of stock instead.  Also,  didn't have Italian seasoning so I used Cajun. Wonderful!  Served on a bed of steamed rice. Will make again

This was really good.  I made it exactly as written except  I did add the chicken broth and wine to the sauté pan before pouring it over the vegetables in the baking pan so I could get all the browned bits into the sauce.  Delicious!

This receipe is excellent, I did not make any changes except I changed the serving size to 4 and I baked for 45 minutes in order for the potatoes to be done.  This was perfect sizing for my husband and myself.  No leftovers, thanks for posting.   I will definitely be making this again.

This was simple and delicious! I halved the recipe, except for the liquid, as some reviewers had mentioned. I ended up with quite a bit of liquid in the bottom of the dish, but the potatoes soak it up so nicely and it keeps everything so moist. I added some diced garlic to the sausage as it browned, and next time I'll add some cherry tomatoes just before it hits the oven.

This was a good meal though we felt it was lacking in flavor even though I did add some Italian herb seasonings.  Next time I will add some adobo or Goya or some kind of flavorful seasoning.  Other than that, we enjoyed it.  I did add some carrots and celery hoping to add some extra flavor to the mix.  It was so easy and quick to prepare as I only browned the sausage and put the veggies in raw.  Baked at 400 for 1 hour and it was perfect.  Thanks Beccabo73 for a good recipe that has lots of possibilities!

Husband rated it a 5 on scale 1 to 10. I gave it a 7. I didn't have red peppers but I did add fresh mushrooms. Next time I'll make the sausage pieces smaller and will try a different find of sausage. But I did like it enough to fix it again.

Great recipe!  My only additions...red pepper flakes, minced garlic and used a combo of sweet yellow and purple onions.  My husband is a jalapeño guy, so half of the dish was topped with those yummy things.  Loved it !
My original review  above
This time I used sausage from Safeway the chicken spinach feta, lots of colored peppers, yellow , red and orange, potatoes from the garden.  Just lovely!

Recipe was pretty good, a nice, hearty dish for a rainy evening at home with a glass of wine.  I reduced the amount of onions from three to about 1 1/2. The recipe calls fro three large onions, but I must have had jumbo onions, it was too much.

Nothing fancy, just plain old good eating!  A perfect weeknight meal on a chilly evening. I didn't have green peppers so I just used red and orange, but I doubt that changed anything from the original recipe.  I have made a similar meal but never added the broth and wine to it - I believe that kicked it up a notch.

Such a tasty and easy dish! I love the colors and textures, and the flavor combination was terrific. Because I cut the recipe in half, I did all my sauteing and browning in my enameled cast iron Dutch oven. When each step was finished, I transferred the ingredients to a medium-size bowl. Since the onions and peppers were sauteed last, I just left them in the Dutch oven and returned everything else to the pot before adding liquids and seasonings. (I had no white wine, but red wine worked great.) I didn't give it 5 stars because it seemed to lack that "wow factor." So the next night, I reheated the leftovers and tossed them with bow-tie pasta. Magic! That was the missing ingredient! Next time I make this--and there WILL be a next time--I'll omit the potatoes (and perhaps add more peppers or even mushrooms) and serve it over pasta instead of by itself.

This was delicious. Will definitely be making again. I made a misgake and crumbled up the italian sausage before I relized it was supposed to be in sections, but it was sill good; also kep everything on the stovetop and didn't need to transfer it to the oven.

Oh, yea! This was awesome! I only used one red and one green pepper and 2 onions because my family isn't a huge pepper and onion fan, but they still ate, and liked it. Mixed hot and mild sausage.

I made this but I made a couple of changes.  Didn't use the bell peppers as I am allergic to them.  I also used beer instead of wine and smoked turkey sausage because that is what I had on  hand.  We loved it and I have made it a couple of times.

I made this recipe with two substitutions. I used  traditional Italian sausage, each link cut into four pieces,  and browned and I used red wine (because it was what I had but I liked the heartiness).  Other than that I followed the recipe. We all loved it.

WOW!  This was amazing.  I couldn't stop patting myself on the back.  This is SO worth the effort.  Hubby loved it too.  I followed the recipe.  Used my cast iron skillet to brown everything up  (used spicy Italian sausages) and threw it in an aluminum throw away 9x13.  Covered with foil and baked at 400 for 40 minutes.  Those who thought this was bland...you ain't doin' it right.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly, took a little shortcut on the potatoes because I got them already cut up in the frozen section.   Also added Italian seasons and salt and pepper during the cooking process.   But it was SO delicious....I'm not an Italian food person but my boyfriend is and he was very impressed with this dish.   I served with salad and garlic bread... Definitely a keeper!

I used bratwurst and a local sausage company called Opa's. I didn't realize how much food this made all said and done I had to transfer it to a turkey sized pan to bake and it almost filled that one.

I made it exactly as the recipe is written. We were not impressed. The onions and peppers were undercooked. It was actually better the next day reheated.  We decided that we might like this as a side dish at a summer picnic.

This is a wonderful and simple recipe that provides excellent and flavorful results the day you cook it and the next day (if there are any leftovers).  I used hot Italian sausage and made a half recipe which was plenty for two (we had leftovers for another meal).  I cooked everything in my enamel coated cast iron crock and then finished it in the oven uncovered. Cutting all the vegetables to similar size allowed everything to be done at the same time.   Delicious and I will make again. For a crowd I would recommend hot and sweet Italian sausage.

I reduce the effort by only browning the sausage first (keeps some of the grease out of the dish as well). Everything else can cook in the oven. That way there is basically no work involved....just let it cook and stir it once in awhile til its done to your liking. I like it a bit charred!

Delicious, just the sort of comfort food I was looking for.  I cut the recipe in half and it still made a large amount for us.  I used a nonstick pan, and so did not need as much olive oil as called for, though I did not omit it altogether, as it adds to the flavor.

This was fantastic...I didnt use wine in it or red peppers. I made this in ny ninja 3-in-1 cooking system. I also made the sausage into little balls. I first coomed the sausage in a littke olive oil and a littlr chicken broth. Then I added the potatoes, green peppers and onions, I poured the chicken broth over the top with salt, pepper, garlic and italian seasoning. I covered it and cooked it for a half hour.  My husband and I loved this. I will make this again.

Have this cooking right now!  The house smells wonderful and I sneaked a taste just to stop my stomach from rumbling. For those that don't like changes to a recipe, don't read this! I added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and a quarter cup of grated Romano cheese. Mixed everything together and now the wait!

This recipe is incredible! I have made it a half dozen times and my family loves it. The smell of this cooking fills the house and drives the kids crazy in a good way. My son loves to eat the bits of sausage from the pan when they're done. For me, it's a bit prep intensive but worth it. A regular in our house on the rare not busy nights!

I think this is a great recipe, but I think I did something wrong. I would have liked the potatoes to be golden brown, but there was too much liquid in the pan for that to happen.  Maybe j didn't sauté the peppers enough?   I left it in the Pyrex and I will drain the liquid and cook it longer tomorrow.

Very tasty, but I think my eyeballing of some quantities was off. I had to put it in an 11 x 17 pan; the 9 x 13 wouldn't hold it. I did use double the amount of chicken broth and white wine (because there was so much STUFF!) Used turkey Italian sausage--which, now that I think of it, may be in 20 oz packages instead of 16 oz ones. Everybody liked it. Took longer to cook, as many have said--and that was after I had the potato slices soaking in hot tap water. I'd allow an hour in the oven (uncovered; at least, that's how I did it).

The only thing I did differently was used 1 cup chicken stock, 1 cup chardonnay and used 3 red bell peppers instead of using a green one (eewww, don't like the green ones). IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!

Wow! This was really good! The veggies soaked up the flavors of the wine, broth and seasonings. Used cauliflower florets in a bag instead potatoes and browned them as in the recipe.  Deglazed the pan after browning everything with the white wine and chicken broth. Added that to the baking dish with the turkey Italian sausage and baked until the cauliflower was tender. Rave reviews! Thank you!

I love to cook and I love to try new recipes. This was one of the BEST and easiest I have made. Except for leaving the potato skins on and adding a few cloves of chopped garlic I stuck with the original recipe. I used leftover Chardonnay and would definitely NOT omit the wine. The aroma and flavor is superb. Was hoping for leftovers but oh no. All gone as it was a huge hit. This is a keeper!

Your Man Will  LOVE ThIS ONE! Meat, Potatoes and a savory light sauce. I added nutmeg and italian seasoning to the sausage, and also a  2 green med sized chile peppers to the veggies. I opted for yellow peppers and a smaller ratio of green and red. Red onions instead of white. It was superb and a most definite crowd pleasure. Follow instructions to the T for cooking times. 5 Stars!

This was delicious, quick and very easy.  I added garlic.  If you want to save time , I've preheated the potatoes in the microwave for 3 minutes to cut down on pan cooking time.  My husband loved it.

Of  course I made changes,  browned sausage and veggies in a Dutch oven pot, mixed "sauce" ingredients and poured over all, put in oven for about 2 hours at 300, to warm the house and let the lovely cooking smell come thru.   And at the end, I did add some heavy cream to thicken sauce a bit.  VERY GOOD!!!

20 - 25 minutes to cook potatoes at 400 degrees come on it's not going to happen. The dish is very good but lets be honest. You would never put something in oven like this for the time it takes to cook the potatoes uncovered/uncovered.  I didn't read when in the oven if the baking dish should be covered or uncovered. Oh well here is what I think you need to do bake about 3 inches from the bottom of the oven at 400 or 425 degrees cover the baking dish leave in the oven 1hr  or check after 45 minutes depending on the type of potato. Bottom line lots pf juice  or want less juice take the cover off at 30 minutes lots of fun to eat Enjoy. Thanks for providing the receipt it is very good!

You can make this with different kinds of sausage. I've used smoked sausage, without browning it first, and it still tasted great. I definitely recommend not skipping the wine. I think that's a big part of the flavor of this dish.

The recipe came out fabulous!  I did brown the sausage well, and did the onions longer on a lower flame prior to cooking in the oven; so it took longer to prepare this recipe but it was worth the time.  I used a cast iron skillet for the initial cooking process but I do not know if that factors in to the great flavors that resulted.  I used: red, orange, and yellow peppers,  red cooking potatoes,  vidalia onions and 2 shallots in place of 1 onion to add flavor,  I also favor Better Than Boullion chicken base in my recipes. I think the wine and chicken stock create an interesting flavor.  I had left over potato, peppers, and onions so I made hot dogs on the grill and this created a fabulous Italian Hot Dog!

This is an excellent recipe, however how can an traditional Italian dish without garlic? I add an entire head of garlic and some baby portobella mushrooms sliced. Instead of salt and pepper, I used chicken bouillon.
It came out great and everyone loved it.

I made this recipe today and it was absolutely delicious. I did not use red peppers because I was out of them. I used water mix with a cube of chicken flavor instead of chicken broth. When all was done it was place inside a bun with sauerkraut and mustard. Yummy, what a treat on a Sunday afternoon.  Thanks for sharing will definitely make again.

Loved it and so did my husband; I used a little less wine and more chicken broth but it was very very tasty; have it in a container for lunch on Monday and will definitely make this recipe again.  I used fresh sage, oregano and garlic and added the broth mixture to the vegetables (I also added some carrots) while they were cooking so as to soak up some of the flavours from the bottom of the skillet (not too long though).  All in all excellent flavours and cooked just right after 30 minutes. EXCELLENT!

Tasty! I pretty much followed the recipe except I used Sweet Italian sausage, used only chicken broth and added garlic. Mine also took way longer like 1hr and 20 mins. Thanks for the new sausage recipe!

Great dish, but I did make some changes.  I salted the potatoes while cooking them.  I also sauté garlic with the peppers and onions.  I also increased the amount of Italian seasoning.

I made this with hot Italian sausage as that's what I had in the house.  Can't say that I really liked it.  DH thought it was o.k. but didn't beg me to make it again!

Loved this. Just tried it and there's so much flavour. Was also a hit with my husband, who's my guinea pig!! I precooked my sausage in the oven first and didn't have any green pepper but added some fresh mushrooms. Will definitely makes this again.

Delicious. and very easy to put together.  I used baby potatoes and left the skins on and cut them in half.  Used red and yellow peppers.  Wonderful meal, and will definitely make again!

This was awesome! Of course, like most people, I tweeked it a bit. I used small golden and purple potatoes instead of the large ones. I also used green, red and yellow bell peppers cut in strips instead of chunks. I used Paula Dean"s house seasoning, which consists of salt, pepper and garlic powder (makes everything taste better!) and sauteed everything a bit longer to brown them better. My family loves it!!! I'm going to make this for our next church function. :-)

Thickly sliced potatoes is open to interpretation. I wish there was a reference here because my dish spent 45 minutes in the oven. I question the amount of liquid required as it sat at the bottom of the dish once I served. Still,good combination. Will make again.

I tried this tonight and even though I only had a little bit of trader joe's chicken sausage it still turned out wonderful. I did add a little bit of bacon because I was so short on sausage though, so that probably upped the yummy factor a bit ;-)
Also substituted vermouth for the white wine as I ran out of white wine. Also added a few red pepper flakes and some dried fennel to the sautee since I didn't have a lot of sausage. Other than that I did as directed and it was great!

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out ok. It takes longer then suggested to cook, about 40 minutes. It was actually better the next day after the potatoes soaked up more liquid. I'll try it again but will sautee the potatoes longer and add fresh jalapeños and garlic.

This was fantastic!! For some reason at the time of making this i couldnt find green bell peppers ANYWHERE! so to have the "green" i used a few jalapenos, cut, cleaned and seeded them very well to take as much of the heat out as possible, and even my 8 year old daughter devoured it!! It was different that what we normally eat(flavor wise) but it was so great! Will make this again, but next time i will use with green bell peppers instead!

This is REALLY GOOD!!!! Try this recipe you won't be disappointed. I followed the recipe step by step the only ingredient I changed was the wine to 3/4 cups. It's really not clear how to cook the potaoes. If you follow these directions at this oven temperature it takes the potatoes about 45 -50 minutes to bake not 20 minutes. Also,we are not wine people in our house, I have bought the wine used it, and thrown the rest away. What a waste. Believe it or not you can use apple juice as a substitute in the place of wine. We did not taste the difference.

Made this yesterday to bring to a friend (of course I tasted some for lunch) Very good, followed recipe except didn't use any wine.  Very good tasting but I did add some tomato sauce at the end just for a little "zing".

This was delicious!  I made it per the recipe, adding a little salt on the potatoes. Next time i will add more potatoes, they were our favorite part!!  It was a bit greasy, so i would recommend less oil.

This is so good !!! I followed recipe exactly as written except I added several dashes of red pepper flakes.  I made it for a Christmas party, and even after I doubled the recipe it was gone.  I used red potato's that I washed and quartered, coated them in olive oil and italian seasoning a little salt and pepper then roasted the potato's oven for about 40 min at 350, they were just shy of being done.  I used yellow, green and red peppers for color.  I think browning the sausage links whole then cutting them is easier and better.  I used a 2(plus) lb pack of mild and a 2lb (plus) pack of sweet Italian sausage.  I sprinkled salt, pepper, italian seasoning and red pepper flakes then baked in oven for 1.5 hours because I made this the day before our party it needed the extra cooking time to get it hot and bubbly.  This browned up the sausage even more, it was lovely to look at when it came out of oven and the smell of it was awesome.  I put out a bowl of fresh grated parm cheese to have our guests sprinkle on top and it was gobbled up.  Thank You for sharing !!!!!!!

you can't go too wrong with potatoes and sausage!  I would like the sauce it cooks in to be a little thicker so it can act as a gravy to the potatoes.  Next time I will do it with a little corn starch... (and turkey sausage to save cals!)

So delicious! I used smoked sausage, as my boyfriend and I do not care for spicy Italian. I also added celery to the veggie mix and strictly chicken stock as I did not have white wine. Next time I will use the wine, it might give it an extra boost of flavor. Other than that this dish was so delicious and easy! Great way to use up veggies in the house! I will make again for sure!

Followed the directions exactly for the potatoes and it took them 35-40 min to cook. Season well! Other than waiting around for it to finish cooking, it was great! Nice looking too.

Fantastic!  I did change a few things to suit my own tastes and keep the calories down.  First, I omitted the 1/4 c. of olive oil; I found 2 tbsp to be plenty.  I didn't have white wine or chicken stock on hand but I did have vegetable stock which I used instead.  I also added a dash of red pepper flakes, and I was very liberal with the Italian seasoning.  Oh and I added two cloves of garlic, minced.  I baked the potatoes separately to start, intending to put everything into the oven, but I ended up (after about 20 minutes of baking) adding the potatoes to the skillet with the sausage and vegetables, and covered them for probably another 15-20 minutes until they were perfectly tender.  I also recommend adding a little feta cheese over top when served; really takes it up a notch!  I will definitely be making this again!

I prepared as written with the exception of throwing some fresh garlic in with the potatoes. Rustic, easy, and delicious! We served this with some fried cabbage and it was a wonderful on a cold November night.

Perfect fall comfort food. I just made a few changes. First, I cooked the potatoes (doubled recipe) in the oven in olive oil (make sure you spray glass dish and heat olive oil before added potatoes. Add salt/pepper) for about an hour. I cooked onions and peppers in seperate pan and sausage in another. I drained and patted sausage with a paper towel and added everything into potatoes. I didn't use wine, but did use the chicken stock 1/3 cup. It came out great. I Will make again!

We love this recipe.  I had been looking for a recipe for italian sausage that the family would like.  Wow!  This is it.  The flavors are delicious.  The leftovers are even good re-heated (that is, IF  there ever are any leftovers).  Thanks for a great recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was something different from the usual. I used Country Crock light butter because I did not have any olive oil on hand. This recipe was worth every minute of prep!

Not bad, didn't feel like the flavors really soaked in. I didn't use any wine though, just chicken stock, and I seasoned the  out of it before hand. I also substituted chicken for sausage so that could've made a huge difference. It's easy enough to do and worth another shot.

So savory, so simple.  We loved this dish.  I don't care for green peppers so used yellow and red peppers.  The dish is as beautiful as it is tasty.

I thought it was very good. I made it without any alterations to the recipe. I actually used a cheese sausage which i think added some extra flavor. My husband loved a lot and was looking forward to eating the leftovers while enjoying supper! I only gave it a 4 because my daughter was not impressed, she is almost 2, many 2-year-olds are fussy eaters...however she normally is a good eater. It was the first time trying it so she might be better the second time. I will be making it again; hearty comfort food for the wintertime, easy to make with uncomplicated ingredients. Next time, I want to add more veggies, maybe add some peas or corn. overall, good recipe:)

A great success in my house. I don't really like sausage too much, but this is very good. Cut the recipe in 1/2, otherwise no changes. I think it is a fairly easy weeknight meal.

This is great! I used Johnsonville Italian Sausage.  It makes for an easy meal and I served it with homemade bread.  This would also be good for a brunch or breakfast with eggs. I added some fresh mushrooms that I needed to use up other than that I followed recipe exactly. YUM!

This is fantastic. Any good cook knows that the best food is simple food done right. The potatoes (I use Yukon Gold) provide a creamy background for the bold flavors of the sausage, peppers, and onion. Hearty and easy. My boyfriend loved this. I've made this several times and I never have leftovers.

Oh my word, this was yummy! I'm still licking my lips.  I'm trying to incorporate more veg in my meals so I tossed in carrots, chives, parsley and celery for good measure. I also seasoned at each step as opposed to end the end. Will definitely be cooking this again!

I was in a hurry, took frozen Italian sausage put into my electric pressure cooker for 35 min. sliced added to the backing dish with Italian seasoning, chopped garlic, pressure cooked a small bag of frozen cubed hash browns for a few min.to thaw then browned them a bit in the pressure cooker, and followed recipe instruction from there YUM!

excellent recipe.  i did add some garlic and next time i will use more wine, less chicken stock - might use less peppers and throw in some mushrooms.  .  i was planning on a 9 x 13 pan, but needed bigger. this recipe is easy, delicious, and budget friendly.

This recipe is awesome!!!  I followed it exactly except that I added the Italian seasonings while I was preparing the dish - parsley to the sausage, basil to the potatoes and oregano to the peppers and onions.  I also added some parmesan cheese just before popping it into the oven.  It is one of the best dishes I have ever made and there were no leftovers.  Thank you Beccabo73 for an incredible recipe.

this was good but not outstanding - I think I will try it one more time but will add garlic and some other spices as it seemed like that's what this dish needs.

I really liked this recipe but my preteens did not care for the vegetables; actually, they wouldn't even try them.  Next time I will add more potatoes, they liked those, and reduce amount of peppers and onions.  On a cold December nights, the aroma was very warming.

This is a delicious bake with all my favorites.  Will definitely make this again ... however, I think it needs a little more seasoning to make it really savory, then it will be perfect!

Excellent.  A perfect winter meal.  I did add the garlic and thought it made it perfect.  Even my picky son loved it.  Will become a kitchen favorite.

Awesome!!!!!  I am not a huge fan of sausage but my husband is so I made this anyway....I love this, our 6 yr old and 3 yr old ate this up and asked for more.  I only did half of the recipe but will be making another dish this week.  I only had on hand one sweet onion and two red and orange bell peppers so that is what I used (probably why the kids liked it so much) sweet!!!  This is a keeper!!  Thank you so much!!!

While this was tasty, I think the total prep and cook time is more like almost 2 hours, not 1 hr and 5 minutes.  Four large potatoes, 3 large onions and 4 peppers are a lot of vegetables! I had 2 skillets going at once and still had to do the peppers/onions in 2 batches. I needed 2 casserole dishes also.

Delicious! Will save recipe and make again.  We love spicy hot so made with henry's spicy pork sausage and dumped in about quarter cup red chili flakes. Also doubled garlic.  And used three bell peppers, one of each red, yellow, green. Yum.

Delicious.  Like other reviewers, I doubled the liquid and cooked it for about 40 minutes. I would suggest seasoning the vegetables with salt as you cook them, and sauteing the peppers and onions separately, to avoid boiling them in their own juices.  Nom, nom, nom!

DELICIOUS! 5 stars all the way! May add some more potatoes next time but that would be my only modification and that's just personal preference :)

This is delicious!  I add red pepper flakes because I really love the extra heat with the potatoes.  This is also great if you eliminate the potatoes, add a little more chicken broth, and serve it over pasta - I prefer something substantial like penne or bowties with this rustic meal.  And lots of parm on top!

This is very good.We used a combination of Italian sausage and a very garlicky German sausage because we didn't have enough Italian.The only 'complaint' we have is that we felt there was way too much meat.Next time we'll cut back the sausage by at least 1/3.Thanks

I first encountered this "cassoulet" at a tiny Italian restaurant...and went home and made it. The difference was that it was all done in a skillet and a small amount of tomato sauce was added (perhaps a cup). Wonderful quick meal!

Great recipe.  Store was out of Italian sausage so I used Garlic/Basil.  (Close enough?).  Not huge fan of green peppers so substituted whole mushrooms.  Yes, my oven requires 40 minutes. Also no white wine on hand so used extra chicken broth.  Very forgiving recipe. Thanks!

Tasty.  I usually make this with a tomato base, so, it's a bit different this way.  A nice change.

I decided to make this on the spur of the moment after realizing that we were going to have the same old boring grilled sausage, but that we had the veggies that needed to be used.  As a result, I ended up basically making half the recipe, but with an extra potato and only half an onion.  I also skipped the wine and chicken stock because I didn't have them on hand.  This was an awesome meal...so much so that as a person who is indifferent about sausage, I had a couple extra pieces.
