The smell is wonderful and the bread looks great!  I'm  not excited about how dense and chewy this bread is though.  I substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour for the bread flour.  The 3/4 cup of crushed Butterfingers amounts to a 3.7 oz. candy bar. This made two smaller loaves which baked at 350 for about 30 minutes.
