This is the BEST bruschetta recipe I've ever tried, and I've tried a bunch of them! Here are a few tips from someone who has made this recipe at least a dozen times: 1) Once, I couldn't find sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil and used the dry kind. Perhaps it was my imagination, but I think I lost some of that distinctive sun-dried tomato flavor. 2) The recipe suggests that you could use dried basil if you're in a pinch. That's true, but use it ONLY if you're in pinch! Fresh basil (I chiffonade mine) is part of what makes this recipe so absolutely delicious. 3) The recipe calls for shredded cheese, but I like to buy bulk mozzarella and slice it into pieces that are about 1/8" thick, and that are sized to fit onto the bruschetta. That keeps your cheese from falling off the sides, and it creates a nice "blanketing" effect over your tomato mixture that keeps it from falling off when you're eating it. Enjoy!

Delicious. My friends felt there was something missing and next time I plan on adding some fresh cut Oregano and doubling the garlic. I also plan on cutting the amount of olive oil used in half to only 1/8 cup. From the suggestions of previous reviewers I decided to brush olive oil onto the bread, broil it for a couple minutes, then add the topping. The cutting of the tomatoes did take a bit of time and I think substituting a couple cans of diced tomatoes would be fine. Just be sure to use FRESH herbs! I will be adding this receipe to my regular rotation.

Simply the best Bruschetta I have ever made!  It got rave reviews from everyone over the holidays.  I would definitely suggest letting it marinate over night - the longer the better.  I also took someone's suggestion to put the cheese on the bread and bake it first - then everyone can put on their own amount of bruschetta.  Everyone agreed that was the better way to go.  This really is easy to make - I also definitely suggest using fresh basil and buying the bread the day you are serving it as well.

Love this recipe.  Have made it many times since finding it online...  There is a reason this recipe lists roma/ plum tomatoes as the tomato of choice.  They are meatier than a beefsteak, early girl, or some of the other varietals available.  Using romas will eliminate some of the wateriness that other reviewers have mentioned.  If you have the opportunity to make this a day ahead, it gives the flavors a chance to marry and allows the garlic to mellow somewhat ~ so MUCH better!  Absolutely great as it is, but decided to try adding a smidgen of anchovy paste to it on the third time.  It sent it over the edge from outstanding to sublime!!!   Thanks so MUCH for this recipe!!!

WOW...these were AWESOME!!  I've never made tomato bruschetta before and these I would definitely make again.  Tried them out on family this weekend before I take it to a party next week.  Got rave reviews!  These are the things I changed: 1) Used 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes rather than cutting up tomatoes.  (Tasted great and much easier!) 2) Our grocery store didn't have sun-dried tomatoes so I used sun-dried tomato spread...worked great!  3)Definitely brush the bread slices w/olive oil first and throw in oven for 5 min at 400 degrees. Bread was not at all soggy, yet not too hard either 4) Use both parmesan (fresh) and mozzarella on top.  5) put back in 400 degree oven for @5 min till cheese melts.  Very good stuff!!

really great. I didn't put it on the bread and add the cheese though since it would be sitting out for a while at a party. I put it in a pretty bowl with the toasted bread nearby and the guests served themselves. It was just as good the next day too.

Great tasting recipe and very easy. I didn't have any sun dried tomatoes so I skipped it but added a dash of sugar to sweeten the Balsamic vinegar. The vinegar is definitely key to the recipe. Also, if you just grill your garlic bread and add the tomatoe mix,cold,(no cheese) it tastes just like Papa Vinos. Either way it's excellent.

“Only 2 things that money can’t buy, that’s true love & home grown tomatoes”. I like to eat this as a dip. It's fantastic! Thanks so much for the recipe! I will definitely use it often. ****Update**** I have made most of the bruschetta recipes on this site & this is still my fav! Delish!

Everyone at my dinner party loved this. I didn't change the vinegar or garlic.  I did notice the next day (leftover snack) the flavors were a little to strong.  This should be prepared the day of.

I would not reduce the amount of balsamic vinegar or garlic - tasted great the way it was!! Got lots of raves at the party I attended. Very simple to make, but people will think you slaved over it! 

Instead of 6 tomatoes, I used 5, and I substituted dried basil for fresh, and served the tomato mixture cold, with no mozzerella on the broiled baguette slices. Before I broiled the baguette slices, I also spread a bit of garlic butter onto the bread. 

Definitely will be making this again!

Very very nice recipe. I did change it a bit to better suit our preferences. Plum tomatoes are the best but if you don't have that you can use regular. Canned would work but be sure to drain it well or your bread will get very soggy. I prefer to omit the sun dried tomatoes and go all fresh. I use 2 cloves of garlic instead of 3. We are garlic lovers but I don't want too much garlic taste. I find the flavours even out better for us with just 2 cloves. I omit the balsamic vinegar. Not big fans of it. For sure fresh basil. Always go fresh when you can. Instead of mozzarella cheese I use goat cheese. Adds a wonderful unique flavour. Also, I cut the baguette into thinner slices, maybe 1/4 inch. It's easier to bite and chew when the pieces are not as thick. Again, it depends on your preferences. Next time I think I will double the batch. It disappears soooo fast.

This is now my go-to bruschetta recipe!
It's sooo easy and it's impressive to serve.

I don't like putting the mozzarella on top, I feel like it looks cheap, almost like pizza.  
I like serving it looking a little more refined and up-scale.
I take sliced mozzarella and cut it into small pieces to fit on my bread slices.
After toasting the bread, then I toast it with the small piece of cheese on it.  THEN I add the tomato mixture.  It seems to hold the tomato well (doesn't fall off at all) and it looks impressive.

Sometimes I top it off with some shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano, and it makes it look just that much more impressive, and adds a little something.  :)

This is a good bruschetta recipe. It's not my favorite appetizer in the world, but I did enjoy this version.  I followed the recipe and do agree with the submitter...using fresh herbs is best if possible.  Fresh basil brings out the flavor in tomatoes.  I really enjoy tomatoes with balsamic vinegar and parmesan so I may add some next time.  Good recipe Loll.  Thanks for submitting.

It's best if the tomatoes are seeded.  Forgot to mention that when I submitted the recipe.  Also, this makes enough to serve 6-8 people as an appetizer (not 4).

I love bruschetta......and this recipe is by far the BEST recipe I have ever made or tasted.  I served this on Christmas Eve and it went within minutes and I had made 2 batches.  I made it ahead of time and left it in the fridge overnight for optimal flavor.  I toasted my bread with garlic butter and parmesan seperately and put the (warm) toasts around the edge of the platter with the (cold) bruschetta in the middle.  I have never had more compliments on a dish EVER!  Will be a staple item on our Christmas Eve Appetizer Buffet table.  THANKS SO MUCH!

I made this recipe as written, except for the baguette and Mozzarella (I was looking for a flavorful, low cal blend to add to cabbage to get the bruschetta flavor...).  I really felt like it was missing something besides the bread and cheese.  If I used shredded Mozzarella, it would get soggy...  Well, I added about 3/4 tsp of grated Parmesan, and that gave it the flavor it was missing...  and took it from a good quality recipe to a restaurant quality (or better!).  It's funny how a simple ingredient can be the item that brings it all together...  I'd suggest trying it both ways, and seeing if you would agree.  With the addition of the Parm, I give it 5 stars, but as written, 4 stars.  But it's a very good base.

I made this for a party I hosted and every single guest asked for the recipe.  I didn't bother with toasting the bread or the mozzarella cheese though since I didn't have the time and it was less hassle this way and it was still fantastic.  I did however use fresh basil and even put in a handful extra just because I like basil so much.  I have to say that I think the sun-dried tomatoes added something special to it. I also made it a day before I served it and drained off the juice prior to serving.  I think that helped make it not making the bread too soggy.  

This was the BEST tomato bruschetta I've ever had.  A definite keeper.

This is the best Bruschetta recipe ever, and so easy to prepare. I made it yesterday for a family dinner, everyone loved it. The only changes made were more garlic and adding a few tablespoons shredded parmesan cheese to the mixture. Toasted the baguette slices and served, allowed individuals to spoon mixture onto slices. The sun-dried tomatoes definately add a unique taste to this recipe. Will be making this again!!

This is really amazing, and I don't even like tomatoes.  I will NEVER use that much oil again, because it makes the bread soggy.  If you use sundried tomatoes from a bag (not packed in oil) and two tablespoons of olive oil, it is just perfect.  Only fresh basil - delicious!

Mmm Mmm good! This is almost exactly how we always make it, just eyeballing the amounts. What's different about this is the garlic - we just never added it, never thought it needed anything else, but with the addition of garlic (2 cloves) it was just that much better! Also, we serve over lightly toasted (both sides) baguette slices & add small chunks of fresh mozzarella to the tomato mixture & serve as a refreshing cold appetizer/salad. Or at other times we cut the tomatoes into larger chunks & pile it all up on a toasted bread that's been rubbed with raw garlic & topped with mozzarella and/or parmesan & place under the broiler prior to piling the tomato mixture on top. The melted mozzarella layer helps keep the btread from getting soggy. I love easy recipes like this that are also versatile & always impressive!

Lovely recipe, I made a couple small changes, I used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic, oregano instead of basil, and stirred some crumbled feta into the tomato mixture.  I then topped it with parmesan instead of mozzarella.  Really yummy, the sundried tomatoes add a lovely tang to it.  Thanks!!

Great Recipe....I prefer to broil the baguette slices with a bit of garlic infused olive oil and shredded parmesan until just lightly toasted.  I also serve the tomato mixture in a bowl, so that everyone can add as much as they want to their toasted bread.  The balsamic vinegar really adds such a great flavor to this recipe!!  The nice thing about making bruschetta is that you can alter it to your own liking.  Thank you so much for posting this amazing recipe!

Good recipe, but if you want to take it up a notch, rub a raw garlic clove over the toasted bread and drizzle EOV on before adding the topping. The garlic melts into the bread and the EVO adds richness. I would leave the mozzarella off for a more authentic taste.

Everyone at my family Christmas party loved these!  They were gone in about 5 minutes.  I used my mini chopper for the sundried tomatoes--I only had dry ones, so I just added some olive oil and it was fine.  I made it the night before so the flavors could meld and I'm glad I did.  Yum!

This was fantastic. I cut the recipe in half because it was just my husband and I. I had one and he had like 8 helping. AMAZING. The only substitutions I made was white Balsamic because I didnt want it to change the color and it is a little more mild. Also when I put the bread in the oven to toast I brushed with a little Olive oil and sprinkled the bread with a tiny bit of salt and pepper. When I topped  the tomato mixture I used a combo of Parm/Romano. Fantastic. Im sure it would be wonderful as written as well.

Loved these!  Perfect as is, would not change a thing!  The sundried tomatoes add a whole new dimension to the flavor!  I chopped them up a little smaller - they were pretty big out of the jar.  Will definitely make this for future parties!!

This recipe was fabulous.  Made topping ahead for a party and then put it on the bread and baked it there.  Everyone loved it.

Divine! My first time making bruschetta and it was very easy! Followed the suggestion of toasting a bit with olive oil before hand.  Next time I'd add more basil- I love the stuff! Thanks so much!

Great recipe. I followed earlier reviewers suggestions to lightly coat the bread with olive oil before putting under the broiler. I also dropped the dried tomatoes 'cause I didn't have any. The result was still excellent. Lots of compliments.

The BEST bruschetta!  I made a couple of changes though.  Instead of the tomatoes packed in oil, I found canned tomatoes that were fire roasted with a hint of garlic (you can find these in any supermarket) and I used 1/2 cup of those.  Then, I broiled the slices of bread for 1 minute on both sides.  It helps with it being a bit soggy if you want a crispier bruschetta.  I'm definitely keeping this recipe!

I made this for the first time for a family party last night.  It is very good and everyone liked it!  I think a little balsamic vinegar goes a long way and cut the amount in half.  I also brushed the bread with a little olive oil before I toasted the slices.  And, I used the preshredded italian cheese for the top as a timesaver. I know I will be  using this recipe again.

This is awesome!  Nobody has mentioned that in the list of ingredients it says 4 T. olive oil, *divided*.  I don't see any place to divide it to :-) so just used 2 T. in the tomato mixture
because the sundried tomatoes are also oily.  It
was fine that way.  I made 'crunchy' toast out of the "Cheese Herb Bread" on this site, put the bruschetta on top, and used freshly grated parmesan.  Great stuff!

Very good recipe.  It was delicious.  Everyone at a recent gathering raved about it. I skipped the sun-dried tomatoes.  Also, instead of mozzarella, I brushed bread with melted butter and sprinkle parmesan cheese.

Easy to prepare, and was the absolute hit of the party! The balsamic is the key, but don't use too much. Remember to seed the tomatoes!

great recipe - my only change is to brush the bruschetta with olive oil and toast in a hot oven for 8 minutes prior to adding tomato mixture and cheese..........this makes it so crispy and even more tastey!

O.M.G! SOOOOO delicious!! Other than doubling the recipe for a big party I followed the recipe for the tomatoe mixture almost exactly. The only thing I changed was the olive oil. I still can't believe it but I ran out of the olive oil so in a last minute pinch I used the left over oil from my sun-dried tomatoes. I figure t only added more yummy flavor than the olive oil alone. As far as the rest of the recipe goes I used fresh mozzarella cheese in place of the shredded and I rubbed garlic on the french bread slices after toasting them under the broiler.  I will use this recipe from here on out! There is no other bruschetta recipe in my opinion!

I made this for an appetizer again tonight and this is one of my all-time favorite allrecipes.  The sun-dried tomatoes add for a sweet taste that other bruschetta's are missing.  I drizzled some reduced balsamic on the serving platter to make them extra pretty.  Thanks!

This had nice flavor but next time I’ll use 2 teaspoons (rather than 2 tablespoons) balsamic and follow the recipe by preparing 10 mins ahead instead of hours prior as many have suggested- it came out too mushy and brownish. I preferred it w/the bread toasted but not the tomatoes as it tastes fresher. I added green onions as well.

I loved this bruchetta recipe! I had my oven on 375 for another recipe & toasted my bread first, until crisp (not browned)with no added oil. Then I baked them again at that temp. with the topping on until the cheese melted. This made the bruchetta stay crunchy all evening. I would also recommend buying 2 baguttes. I ended up having enough topping for 1 1/2 baguette slices. Oh, and I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes for the fresh. It really helps the tomatoes stay on the bruchetta & makes this recipe even quicker to make!

This recipe is so very good!  I made these as an appetizer for a small dinner party.  Since I was serving 3 appetizers, I kept portions small ~ only 2 bruschetta per person.  My guests were fighting over them!

This was a great recipe.  Upon others' suggestions I did lessen the balsamic vinegar and garlic.  I made half with grated mozarella on top.  The ones with mozarella on top went quickest.  It was the first-finished appetizer at our last party.

This is a dish best served cold. Seriously, follow the instructions as listed here and the product is fantastic, but letting it sit a bit to reach room temperature brought out something extra from this dish.

This was so easy to make, and it was delicious! I only made one change, per the advice of other reviews: brush the bread with olive oil before broiling. It adds just a little bit more to an otherwise perfect recipe!

I put the tomato mixture together the night before serving....definitely a good step. Just before serving, toasted the bread slices, and topped with the tomatoes, popped them in a hot oven. Easy and delishious!

This is excellent! I used fresh basil and I'm telling you--dont bother making this unless you use fresh basil. It totally makes the dish. Instead of chopping all the tomatoes, I used my food processor and 'pulsed' it all together. It makes it a coarse, relish-like consistency. Also let this sit for several hours after making it because it truly gets better with age. I kept dipping into it with crackers before dinner because it was so addicting.  My husband loved it--a total keeper!

This recipe is the best for parties and get togethers.  I make it the true italian way.  I just broil the bread slices ahead of time for a minute or two on each side, then cut a garlic clove in half and rub it over one side of each piece.  Then I just set out the toasted peices and a bowl of the tomato mixture.  There is no need to heat it up.  I also mix one cup of parmesan cheese in with the mixture instead of mozerella.  delicious and so easy!

I thought this was going to be a great recipe until I baked it in the oven and then I was so disappointed!  The tomatoes were yucky and mushy after being cooked in the oven.  I think I would much rather enjoy this recipe if the tomato mixture was topped on the toasted bread and it used fresh parmesan or romano cheese instead of the melted mozzerella.

At least 5 stars, or more. This was perfect. I used just dry sundried tomatoes, $5 for the ones in oil was alittle much. I also brushed the bread with olive oil and toasted it. Then put cheese on and broiled that, so people could top it with as much or as little bruschetta as they wanted. It took about 1 1/2 loafs of bread to use all the bruschetta, but it was heavenly. I will make this for every event from here on out. Thank you!

I too didn't have the sun dried tomatoes packed in oil either but I had dried ones and just soaked them in water for a few minutes to soften them. Also, after I mixed all the ingredients together, I let it sit for a few hours to let the flavors marinate together.  This recipe can be made ahead of time and just put on the bread and broiled in a couple of minutes.  I think it helped a bunch.  I found that the amount of this recipe needed to be doubled to fill a whole baguette.  Maybe I cut my bread to thin or put too much on my bread, but I would double it next time.  This was a hit at my most recent party and I will definitely make this again.

I've made this recipe many times now.  I use lots more bread than is called for.  Also, for added appeal for the kids, I add a slice of pepperoni.  Better than pizza!

Excellent!  A quick and easy recipe that my whole faily raved about.  The key is balsamic vinegar, fresh basil and fresh mozzarella.

Excellent quick and easy recipe. I tend to like stronger tastes, so I didn't alter the balsamic vinegar or garlic like others had previously suggested. I think next time I make it, I will decrease the tomato a bit and add more fresh basil. I also used a parmesan/romano shredded cheese on top which was very tasty!

This is a fantastic recipe for bruschetta. I received numerous compliments at a party. I found that chopping up the sundried tomatoes works best. Chopping all the ingredients takes the most time.

LOVE making this and eating it too. Using the slimmer French breads from grocery stores usually works best, but if I don't have time to do that, I use sandwich toast and cut them into quarters. Definitely do not skimp on the fresh herbs or the garlic. Yumm

Amazing! This was a perfect mixture, and even my husband who isn't a big tomato eater enjoyed it. I put the leftover mix on chicken for dinner and it was good. Next time I will need to make more!

I would suggest cutting the mozzarella into thick circles to place on top it the tomato and bread just for security and assurance of cheese in every bite

This is an excellant recipe and I will definitely will use it again.   I didn't feel 15 minutes prep time was right - I think it took more like 25 minutes by the time I chopped all the tomatoes and got it sliced and ready for the oven.

Turns out I don't know how to use a broiler and burned half my bread.  That's not the recipe's fault, however.  Very yummy, incredibly easy - just a tad bit too tomato-ey fpr me.  Will cut down to four tomatoes for next time and use a loaf of French bread instead of a baguette (we were doing this more dinner style than appetizer).  The balsamic gives it a nice little tang and the FRESH basil is absolutely CRUCIAL as it makes it taste so... well... fresh! Really good recipe, will definitely make again.

the taste was very good but be careful when broiling the bread...I burned the first batch because I put it on broil for 2 minutes like it said...the second one I placed on the bottom shelf instead and only for 30 or 40 seconds and 3 minutes on the bottom shelf when the tomatoes are on it and its great!

I did not like this bruschetta.  I love fresh tomatoes and I think the sundried tomatoes were to much. I served it at a party and had lots left over.

Fabulous!  This was very tasty.  I omitted the sun-dried tomatoes.  I also toasted both sides of the bread before I topped it with the tomatoe mixture and cheese.  This was a great side treat to go along with "Pesto Chicken Florentine".  This recipe makes enough tomatoe mixture for the whole loaf of bread.

9/12. i halved everything and it made enough for the 3 of us.  i sliced the bread, brushed with olive oil mixed with garlic, put a slice of mozz cheese on top and broiled till bubbly.  then let cool, (give matthew some just like that) and top with brushetta before serving. yum.

I made this and it was a hit!! I used only Roma tomatoes only because I did not have sun-dried but I am sure they would be good. I also used freshly grated parm rather than mozz and did not heat it. Everyone loved it!!!

my husband found this and was gung-ho on making it for a fairly large dinner party. I was really hesitant thinking of hot bruschetta as not too appetizing. Man was I glad i went along with him. It was so amazingly beautiful to present to our guests , so quick to make so we were enjoying our guests not slaving in the kitchen, and the taste? WOW, really really really good. Will totally be making again. Made us look like professionals. We made 3 loaves and every bite was devoured. Rave reviews and compliments galore, honestly. Very impressive recipe.

Amazingly good! I added 7 chopped kalmata olives for a briney bite, and let it sit in the fridge for up to 24 hours to "marry" the flavors. Whole cheese works better than shredded, too. Thanks for this yummy recipe!

BEST  bruschetta i've tried! (and i've tried a lot) I made it for a dinner party and everyone thought it was from a restaurant! I took out the sun-dried tomatoes (not a fan, personally) and added a bit of feta cheese and toasted in the oven! delicious! thank you!

I have made this many times before. This is amazing! I have now started adding capers to the mixture. I also omit the cheese and replace it with goat cheese. I am always looking for anything to add goat cheese. Everyone loves my version! It is amazing. But of course, without this original recipe i would have never had "mine" now :)

Really really yummy. I also completely cheated and used hunts canned tomatoes that I drained. They turned out super yummy and quick. Only thing I may change is to brush some olive oil onto the bread before toasting it so that it doesn't scorch as mine did initially.... but that was probably since I wasn't paying close enough attention!

I didn't have any sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil or mozzarella cheese, so I used dried basil and left the rest out.  But instead of broiling, I brushed my baguette with olive oil and browned in a pan before adding the fresh mixture.  I know it isn't quite what's called for, but it still makes one of my all time favorite snacks in the world!

This was amazing, but the freshness of the basil/tomatoes definately made this what it was! I used 1/2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar(due to high sulfates and Im pregnant)instead of what was called for, and I didnt have sun-dried tomatoes so I used fresh organic cherry tomatoes with organic roma tomatoes and a little extra olive oil(just a tad). I also reduced the garlic to 1 clove(not a big garlic fan), and added about 1/4 Cup of finely diced bell peppers maybe a little less. I used sea salt and added parsley. This was great and I couldnt find baguetts so I just used toasted wheat bread and it was great. i will try a thicker bread next time, cuz it did make my bread soggy, but it was still great. My husband even loved it and he is not a fan of store bought tomatoes at all.

This was fantastic!  I omitted the olive oil from the mixture and brushed the sliced baguettes with olive oil prior to broiling as recommended by another reviewer. As suggested, I also added a little oregano.  I prepped the mixture and let it marinade for two hours which I think enhanced the flavor.  This will be my go-to app for all future parties.

This is by far the best bruschetta I have ever made.  Was pretty easy to make as well.  My family prefers more traditional bruschetta so i dint add the mozzerlla at the end but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter and i was perfect.  I also added a can of petite diced tomatoes because I didnt think i had enought fresh tomatoes and wanted to make alot.  I made this for Christmas as one of our apps and it dissappeared!  thanks for sharing, I will def be making this again!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  However, it is INCREDIBLY important to toast the baguette slices before loading up with topping, otherwise they come out soggy and falling apart.  Otherwise, surprisingly tasty. =)

this was ok. Not authentic though. I didn't use cheese as I have never had Bruschetta with cheese before and no one really liked it. Will not make this again.

Delicious blend of flavors, and soooo easy.  I mixed everything the night before a party and kept refrigerated. I used a loaf of French Bread that my bakery sliced thin and broiled in oven until brown.  I microwaved the mixture the next morning and drained before spooning on the bread - topped with a slice of cheese before baking for 5minutes in 350 degree oven.  These were a hit - also, you can reheat easily

I converted recipe to serve 8. As a side dish it would have served 3 generously, and as an appetizer 4 perfectly. I used canned diced tomatoes, drained well. Fresh tomatoes would have been perfect. Used fresh basil as suggested in other reviews. Definitely the way to go. 5 stars for flavor and simplicity. The sun dried tomatoes packed in oil was enormous in cost at $7.60 USD for the jar. The expense is a bit much to me for a casual occasion (totalled nearly $15.00 USD for all non-standard ingreds.) For a dinner party, other formality or special occasion I'd make it again.  Not too happy with the expense though. The recipe is great. FH loved it.

The whole family loved this one. There was absolutely nothing left after dinner when I made these - and yes I served the recipe as a light entree with sides of broccoli and cottage cheese.

With the first bite, even the 11 year old loved this recipe. And they look good too.

Regrettably, I didn't have fresh basil on hand, so I used dried. Fresh would have been a great addition and I will do that next time.

The fresh and sundried tomatoes are a nice pairing. With the sundried tomatoes, the flavor is much more substantial.

I will definitely make this again, most likely tomorrow!

Bets bruschetta recipe I have ever had!  This is not too garlicky or contain onions, but it is sooooo flavorful.  Like other reviewers, we used half the oil (since the sun dried tomoatoes are packed in oil, it adds plenty of oil). Instead of shredded mozzarella cheese, we cubed up fresh mozz and very lightly warmed the bruschetta in the oven before serving.  Within 2 weeks, we made this 3 or 4 times for holiday parties and got rave reviews each time!

A six star recipe. This is good year round.  To simplify, I did as others and used 2 cans of well drained petite diced tomatoes. Also used 4 cloves of garlic, omitted the mozzarella, and spread goat cheese on the toast before adding the topping to broil. The balsamic vinegar and the fresh basil are essential.

Great recipe! I was throwing a party in a big hurry--right after two exams.  I had limited time and limited energy.  I prefer to use fresh ingredients, but I had to cheat and use Recipe Ready! Petite Diced Tomatoes from a can.  I also used sundried tomatoes that I soaked in olive oil overnight, rather than the kind from a jar (which always have added spices).  Instead of mozzarella, I used a grated blend of Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago cheeses, simply because that was what I had.  Even without using fresh ingredients, this was a hit. My guests could not get enough, AND it was quick and easy to prepare.

My family really liked this recipe! The only suggestion was to broil BOTH sides of the bread for a crispier base, and to wait until ready to broil before putting the tomato topping on the bread so that it doesn't have time to soak in and soften the bread! Excellent! Compliments all around the table. Great post!

This stuff is outstanding!  I used it for an hors d'oeurves party at our apartment complex and couldn't keep the platter full!  For anyone from the Omaha area, this recips tastes very similar to the tomato/basil condiment served at Lo Sole Mio.  This recipe does make a lot, so be sure to have several baguettes on hand--three wasn't enough for us.  I used the leftover tomato mix in a pasta dish.  I'm considering keeping this mixture on hand at all times as a great addition to pastas and salads.  Even my friends who don't like tomatoes loved this recipe.

Great version of a classic appetizer. I used mini appetizer toasts as the base and had to use some canned diced tomatoes as I did not have enough fresh. Still turned out perfect!

Delish! Made this to go as a paring for my Pinot tasting party. Huge hit. Toasted bread first with some EVOO. Broil just a few minutes after I toasted the bread. Great party food.

I found it to be a bit soggy, even though I  used a slotted spoon to put the tomato mixture on the toasted baguette.  Also wasn't sure if the basil was supposed to be chopped, but I did it anyway.  I prefer crispy bruschetta so won't make this again.

Follow it to the letter and you'll have perfect bruschetta every time. Fresh basil is a must, and you can add more garlic if you're brave. The longer you let the bruschetta mixture sit (overnight is best), the richer the flavor will be.

Served at an outside party that lasted for hours, so these suggestions are based on ease and practicality. Have a loaf of baguette bread cut by the bakery dept at the grocery store into "bruschetta slices."  Broil the mozzarella cheese (be sure to get the kind that comes in a ball -- it tastes better and does make a difference) in the oven on top of the bread.  Leave a bowl of the tomato mixture for people to serve themselves. At a party it keeps the bread from getting soggy.  ;)  Tasty recipe!!!

The sun-dried tomatoes added a depth of flavor that can't be beat.  I used focaccia as a base instead of baguette slices and it was fabulous!

Hey Laurie, thank you for this amazing recipe. I, probably like the rest of the reviewers, have made bruschetta on many occasions. I was browsing through recipes to change mine up a bit and found your recipe.  I NEVER thought of putting sun dried in with the fresh tomatoes and I can't believe I didn't because I love the taste of both. This takes Bruschetta to the gourmet level. The only changes I made were using "tomatoes on the vine" because I didn't have any romas, and subbing white balsamic for regular balsamic. This avoided the "brownish tint" one reviewer commented on. I also added some fresh oregano as I love the flavor with tomatoes and basil. Fresh basil definitely is a must with this recipe. I was thinking in a pinch if I didn't have fresh basil on hand I could always add a spoonful of homemade pesto to the tomatoes instead. I also toasted my bread in advance dipping my brush into the jar of sun dried tomatoes and using that oil instead of olive oil or butter. I also sprinkled fresh parm on the bread before toasting. The best thing about this recipe is that you can do so many things with it. I have made it as suggested with fresh mozzarella toasted on the bread, but this time of year, its all about being cool.  I made this today with fresh mozzarella diced into little pieces and chilled with the tomato mix.   I toasted baguettes & served the tomatoes on the side EVERY PERSON ASKED ME FOR THE RECIPE!  That really says something! Thank you again Laurie...

I live in rural Turkey, where certain ingredients are impossible to find.  I couldn't find sun dried tomatoes, so I substituted ROASTED RED PEPPERS in oil.  I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but it was delicious!  I can't speak to the original recipe, but for those who thought it was too much tomato, try some peppers!

I have made this 3 times and it's absolutely the BEST!  The very first time I made it, I accidently mixed in the mozzarella with everything else, instead of topping it at the end.  Good mistake!  I'm making it like that every time now so the cheese doesn't slide off while baking!  Thank you!

AMAZING! My husband can not stop eating this when I make it. I did however change it slightly by putting the cheese in it and letting each person serve themseleves to prevent the bread getting soggy and it was so good.

Really, really good! A hit at parties and family dinners alike. I made this for my boyfriend and he ate more of the bruschetta than the meat which is odd for this man. Also, I just served this at a party I had and it was gone before even the last guests arrived. I should have cooked more! Definitely something you should at least try. You will like it.

This is so good and so simple! I followed the recipe as written but added a tablespoon of capers. The salty crunch of the caper is a nice addition. Since I added the capers I chose to serve it cold on the toasted baguette with a little sprinkle of Parm cheese on top. D'lish!

This was a great recipe and very popular with my guests.  I took the advise of other reviewers and prebaked the bread so it was nice and crispy, and didn't get soggy when the toppings were added.  Definitely use fresh herbs, it is worth it.

Loved it! Thought that was way too much oil though. Only used 2 tbsp and was still great. I also mixed parm cheese in with the brushetta as well as the mozza. Might try 1 tbsp of balsamic next time. Very delicious!

I love the recipe. I modified a bit. I used home grown tomatoes so I skipped the sun dried tomatoes. I also added some greek oregano as I didn't have enough fresh basil. I added a dash of red peppers for some heat and cooked the whole thing on Trader Joe's pizza dough with parmesan cheese.

This bruschetta was really great. i added a tiny bit of sugar and used two cans of diced tomatoes with only half of the juice, (one can was basil, oregeno, and garlic flavored). has a really strong flavor but thats why everyone loved it. definitely a recipe for tomato lovers. very easy will probably make again.

Yum. Tweaked the recipe a bit, but I would definitely make these again. Not a huge fan of sun-dried tomatoes, so I omitted those. I used beefsteak tomatoes and fresh basil from the farmers market- delicious. The french baguette I used was difficult to cut and top as it was far too small. Next time I will probably try slices of ciabatta instead. The topping is also great as a fresh pasta sauce!

Great recipe that I have used countless times and always get positive compliments on it. Our dinner party got pushed back and I was worried the bruschetta topping would get soggy by the following evening, but it tasted just as good.  I added some fresh tomatoes that evening.

Very good, but I did halve the balsamic vinegar and am glad I did.  It was a little too oily for me.  Next time I will half the amount of olive oil too.

Great bruschetta! it got rave reviews from my guests, i made it as directed except i brushed olive oil, garlic powder and parmesan cheese onto the bread and baked for 5 minutes on 400. then used the crisp garlic toasts to dip into the tomato mixture. i didnt have mozzarella at the time. either way the tomatoes taste fantastic, just dont forget the sun dried tomatoes in oil.(i measured them then blended in my magic bullet till they were finely blended then mixed with the rest of the recipe.) YUM!

Awesome- have also made it into a salad type dish- using fresh mozzarella balls, and serve with the sliced, toasted baguette on the side (brush with olive oil, lightly sprinkle with garlic powder and Parmesan cheese), easier to bring to potlucks that way (no baking while there required.)

Very tasty....  I am not big on Bruschetta but my husband loves it, so I am learning to like it. The sundried tomatoes drew me to this recipe.  I diced to tomatoes nice and small.  Letting it sit over night or at least a couple hours helps the flavors marry!  I lightly brown both sides of my baguette slices.  Do not use 2% Mozzerella as it does not like to melt!!!  I have to say I even liked it better the second night.  My husband of course LOVES it!!

This is the BEST bruschetta I have ever tasted!  I have ordered bruschetta many times in restaurants and this recipe beats them all. The topping is so moist, flavorful and succulent.  It was a big hit at our New Years Eve party.  I made some slight "tweakings" to make it better.  First, I used my bread machine to make homemade bread (I used the dough setting and then shaped the dough into a long, thin baguette and baked in the oven).  I also marinated the topping for a few hours instead of 10 minutes as directed.  Finally, I brushed the bread slices with a little olive oil before broiling for extra flavor and texture.  Otherwise, I did not change the essential recipe.  This recipe is one of my new favorites and I know I will make it again and again.

I made this for a cooking demo in my local grocery store for their Holiday Open House.  Everybody went nuts for it!  So easy and so delicious.  Somebody had the suggestion of putting it on a baked brie in a pastry puff... that would be amazing!

Fabulous flavor.  I mixed up all the ingredients and let them marinate a few hours before topping the bread.  Be careful and watch the bread toasting under the boiler...it only takes a few seconds and half of mine burned because I set the timer for a minute and left it unattended.

This is a great recipe-- I don't eat garlic so I didn't use that, but I have a great suggestion that makes this easy and great for parties.  Make this with out the bread in a shallow baking dish.  Toast your bread and set it in a basket beside the bruschetta that way it doesn't take up as much room and the bread doesn't get soggy you can pop it in the microwave whenever you need to warm it up.....

This was the most fresh bruschetta I've ever had...I added in more garlic, took out the sun dried tomatoes & balsamic, and added oregano. Everyone was raving about it! I also did a five-cheese blend instead of mozzarella (parmesean, asiago, romano, provolone, mozzarella)!

These were AMAZING! I took them to a progressive dinner party we had with our neighbors, there were 6 couples there total, and 3 asked me for the recipe immediately.  The only thing I did different was I let it marinade for 4 hours in the refrigerater, and brushed the bread with olive oil prior to broiling it! Will definitely be making this over and over again!

Yummy!  I made this for a holiday party where everything served was finger foods, and this was a huge hit!  The only thing that I did slightly differently was to let the mixture sit overnight to allow the flavors to mingle, and to use slices of natural mozzarella on top instead of the shredded kind.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

OH MY!!!   This is delicious.  Made it for Xmas party and now making it again tonight for a dinner party.  My husband looked at the ingredients and said "That's not bruschetta.  Where's the red onion"... But he LOVED this recipe.  That's what's great about it.  A little different from the original recipe.... FABULOUS TASTE!

These turned out great. I had debated between this and another bruschetta recipe. I never did find the sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil. I went to about 10 different grocery stores in the area. Regardless, they still were excellent. Will make again.

Very good, but next time I would probably use a little less garlic.  I topped these with a combo of mozzarella, parmesan, and romano cheeses.  Yummy!

Due to cost, I omitted the sun-dried tomatoes and this was still excellent.  It is now a regular snack in our house.  It is so easy and just packed with flavor.  A big hit.

I have tried a lot of bruchetta recipes, and this by far is the best. Completely addictive with summer tomatoes and excellent bread (Sarcones in Philly if you can get it!). I can easily make this a meal with a glass of sine and a salad.

Whenever I make this people LOVE it. I always use roasted red peppers packed in oil instead of the sun dried tomatos. I just really like the taste of the peppers. Gives it a sweet taste to offset the tangy balsamic. But I LOVE it! I will be making it all summer!

Phenomenal! I marinated it over night and it was bursting with flavour the next day. (I used mom and dad's garden fresh tomatoes.) Toasted baguette in the oven and allowed guests to serve themselves.

Perfect! I used this in my pasta salad with cheese tortellini and mozzerella cheese cubes. It has been requested for every family gathering. Next time I will add salami or pepperoni. Excellent!

I have made this many times over the past couple of years and it is always a hit.  The only changes I've made are to use only 4-5 romas and I like the one reviewers idea of using sliced mozzarella on top; it does help to keep it all from sliding off.  Tonight I used portobello mushrooms instead of the bread:  just rubbed them with a little EVOO and baked for about 5 minutes (at 425), added the bruschetta and baked 5 more minutes, topped with mozzarella and baked just til the the cheese melted.  Delicioso!!!

Delicious and easy! If stuck for time, I use a drained tin of chopped tomatoes, still turns out yummy :) I also tend to reduce the amount of olive oil slightly.

This is fabulous!  I made this 3 times since discovering two weeks ago.  Read other comments, and used only 2 Tablespoons of olive oil.  Highly recommend using a good quality balsamic vinegar and use fresh garlic, as using a bargain brand balsamic (Walmart) and preminced garlic from a jar (Costco), while still good, did not yield the fabulous flavor.  Everyone that tasted this has asked immediately for the recipe!  Thank goodness I can refer them to Allrecipes website!

This was very tasty. The tomato mixture is a little watery, so I suggest using a fork or slotted spoon to scoop the mixture. This will prevent the bread from getting soggy.

Made this with no changes and it was enjoyed by all!  I only suggest you de-seed the tomato so the bread does not get soggy.  If you do not know how, search Google for "Deseed Roma Tomato" and there are videos to show you how!

This was an incredibly easy to prepare and delicious appetizer. I think the flavor is definitely bruschetta but with a bit of something special that the balsamic adds.  I'll make this again, thanks!

I love this recipe.  The bruschetta turns out so yummy.  I prefer to reduce the balsamic vinegar slightly though and sometimes I add some finely diced onion.  Either way though it turns out very tasty!  I will try with goat cheese maybe for fun next time.

This recipe is perfect as is although I added some sprinkle parmesan cheese to it. Let it sit in the fridge overnight then I spread land o lakes roasted garlic butter on some sourdough bread and toasted it in my panini press. Just served it at room temperature. It's a keeper :)

We did not like the sun-dried tomatoes in this recipe.  It didn't have enough of a vinegar flavor, and had too much oil.  We put leftovers in the refrigerator and my husband liked it better the second day.  Next time I would leave out the sun-dried tomatoes, decrease oil to 3 tbsp, increase vinegar to 3 tbsp, and add scallions.

You MUST :-) rub the toasted bread with a cut garlic clove before piling on the tomato mixture.  It the garlic rubbed toast that makes it bruschetta.

Love it! I did not have any sundries tomatoes left so I omitted them. It was Still Delicious! It tastes like capresse, we now have made this 4 times, twice upon requests from friends. Thanks for sharing. Oh yeah, I made it the last time with a large can of diced petite tomatoes and it was delicious too.

Beautiful, delicious, relatively easy - I cannot wait to make this again. Used shredded mozzarella because it was cheaper, but next time I will try slices to see how that changes the feel of it.

Let me start out by saying this is a 5 star recipe.  The reason I gave it four is because I did not use the sun dried tomatoes. They were quite expensive and for a recipe I had never tried, I wasn't going to put the money towards it.  I used a friend as a "test dummy" he didn't mind. It was delicious!!! Next time and there will be one, the sun dried tomatoes will be tried. We both agreed it was awesome as it was, but we decided we must try it again with the sun dried tomatoes. A perfect excuse to make it again. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!!!!!!

This is a great base recipe. I used it for a dinner party and everyone loved it! I did make a few small changes which were for the better (rather than a mini-pizza style bruschetta). 

Changes:
3 tbsp balsamic vinegar
5 Roma + 1 Big Boy tomato
4oz crumbled feta cheese
No sun dried tomatoes, no mozzarella.

Fresh French bread, sliced, broiled/toasted. Sprinkle with olive oil before toasting. I did not toast with any cheese on the bread as I put the feta in the tomato mixture. I served the tomato mixture chilled and the bread warm.

Fabulous! I couldn't make enough to satisfy everyone! Have made this as is, and have also made them without the sun-dried tomatoes. Both versions disappear in an instant. Another version is one with lemon oregano oil in place of the olive oil, which gives it another dimension of flavor to the recipe. This is a fabulous recipe as is, as well as giving a jumping off point for other variations. A definite keeper – thanks!

Soooo yummy!!!  I let the mixture sit for a few hours and it was delicious!  To keep the bread from become soggy, I used a slotted spoon to divide the bruschetta.  I topped it with fresh mozzarella and it melted beautifully!  All 30 slices were gone withing minutes!

Excellent,even my husband, who normally doesn't like food like this, loved it!  I made it on ciabatta bread because that is what I had and it was great.  I did brush the bread with olive oil and lightly toasted it on both sides before adding everything thing else and melting cheese.

This is sooo delicious!  It's hard to stop eating, and always a hit.  It is delicious fresh out of the oven, or cold leftovers.  I wasn't able to get the sun dried tomatoes packed in oil, so I just soaked them overnight in olive oil.

Oh my gosh!!! This recipe is to die for. I know its an appetizer, but sometimes my family requests that I make it just for us (; and its sooooo easy! Just make sure you have a good balsamic vinegar, because I have come across cheap not so good tasting ones. Oh, and if your not a garlic fan, you might want to cut the garlic amount some. Its such a strong flavor!

Made this for daughter's Italian themed HS graduation party - it was the star favorite of everyone! I made way too much but it froze well and we could enjoy it again.  Also good with pita chips or tortilla chips.

This is one of my go-to recipes for groups and pot-lucks. I put the whole mixture of tomatoes in a large dish and then put mozz cheese on the whole thing and bake. I then put a spoon in it and put some veggies and toasts on the side and let people serve themselves. Easy, quick, and always gone in a flash!

Loved this recipe.  Brought it to several parties and everyone raved about it.  Definitely best with fresh garlic and basil.  Used Mezzetta brand sundried tomatoes packed in olive oil.  Served on parmesan triscuits.

TIMESAVER - Substitute for Romas 2 small cans of petite diced, Food Club (store brand) Tomatoes with Sweet Onions.  Also prefer fresh mozzerella.  IT TURNS OUT GREAT EVERYTIME!!  Try on toasted ciabatta or over hot or cold pasta. HEALTHIEST WOW you'll ever eat.

I had to modify recipe only because I had use what 
I had on hand. I didn't have sun dried tomatoes or balsamic vinegar but it still came out delicious. Everyone loved it, no left overs on this one. I toasted bread as recommended by many reviewers. Yummy!

This was my first bruschetta recipe that I attempted.. and I was very impressed!  (As was my girlfriend.. she asks me to make it quite often.)  It included one of my favorite food combinations; tomato and basil and the balsamic vinegar added a really nice dimension as well.  I second what some of the other reviewers have suggested:  brushing some olive oil or some butter on the bread and browning it lightly under the broiler before adding the topping to it.  Getting a fresh, high quality baguette is ESSENTIAL to making this recipe successful!

My first attempt at bruschetta - and it was awesome!  The whole family loved it!  Made as a side for the Creamy Chicken Linguini on this site.  Was a great pairing since the linguini is on the rich side.  I did add more garlic to suit our taste, but other than that it's perfect!  I also let the flavors meld for about 1 1/2 hours at room temp.  Can't wait to make this again!

I am living in China right now, so ingredients are scarce, but this bruschetta recipe was perfect, even without an oven! Instead of balsamic vinegar, I used some Kraft balsamic vingrette dressing, and about 1 tbsp of olive oil. No plum tomatoes, but sweet regular tomatoes worked fine. I found dried basil still brings out the flavour, but i had to add double the amount than the recipe asks. I toasted the bread instead of put it in the oven and sprinkled parmesan instead of baking it with cheese. It's still a delight though the recipe was simplified. My husband continues to ask for it as his hors d'oeuvre of choice.

I am actually in the process of preparing this right now. Looks and smells delicious. Market was all out of fresh basil, so I had to buy dried. I did add diced Kalamata olives to mine, as well. Plan on serving in a dish with toasted bread on the side.

Made this several times and everyone loves it.  I followed others' suggestions.  I mix olive oil, with Italian seasoning and chopped garlic to coat the bread.  Broil it.  Then add the topping.  I also used 1 Tbsp of vinegar as suggested and buy fresh mozzarella and slice it.  Much easier to add to top vs. shredded

This is the best bruschetta I've ever made. I made it the night before my get together. I had some cold with french bread after it had been in the fridge a few hours, it was so delish. I added a handful of parmesean cheese for a sharper taste with the mozzarella. I totally suggest this recipe if you want to impress people.

I used only what I had on hand...bakery Italian  bread, garden tomatoes, garlic and basil.  No sun-dried tomatoes.  I toasted my bread both sides on the gas grill, topped with the tomato mixture and cheese and returned to the top rack of the grill with the lid closed till the cheese melted.  The next day there was just enough leftover tomato mixture to have 2 toasted slices that I simply topped with the cold mixture and feta cheese for my lunch.  Perhaps because I didn't have the sun-dried tomatoes, the basalmic vinegar was just a bit too predominant after heating but cold it was simply perfect!!  I will make this again and again.  Definitely use fresh basil and I'm going to experiment with a couple different cheeses in the future.  Reviewers that used this as a dip were reading my mind as I was dipping it before assembling the bruschetta.

YUMM!!! Give this one a try! I will say that I didn't think the sun dried tomatoes added much, but I did really like the balsamic vinegar. Also, I'm lazy and didn't shred the cheese, just sliced it real thin and put that on top.

Also, for those of you with OLD/cheap ovens with no broiler setting like me (yes they do exist), just bake in a preheated 400 degree oven, toasting the bread itself for 2 minutes, and then everything for 3-5 minutes. Real easy!

Thanks for the recipe!

This was AWESOME!!! I made 2 loaf of the french bagette (had them sliced at the store) I used Hunts chopped tomatoes in the can and FRESH basil, didn't use the sund dried tomatoes, followed the recipe to a T other than the canned tomates and it came out AWESOME!  I made this for my birthday party doubled the recipe and there wasn't ANY left!~and this was my first time make brushetta  I highly recomment using canned tomatoes..(saves time and no-one could tell the difference! Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!  The sun-dried tomatoes make it stand out from other recipes I've tried.  I added some onion, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

This was such a hit at our Easter dinner.  Made the recipe as stated minus cheese (needed a vegan app.).  I placed sun-dried tomatoes, garlic and basil in a mini food processor to save a few steps.  Really good and would make again & again.  We had a few spoonfuls left which we added to egg whites for breakfast.  This would be amazing over pasta.

Soooo good!  I have never made bruschetta before and I am glad I chose this recipe!  It turned out so delicious.  The sun dried tomatoes were ridiculously expensive at my store so I just added a tablespoon of tomato paste for sweetness and did everything else as specified.  I had an amazing spread and honestly could have eaten only these they were so good!  Everyone loved them and they were easy to make.

Excellent!  The only thing I did different was let the mixture sit in the fridge for a few hours beforehand (except the fresh basil leaves) I didn't want them soggy so I added 10 minutes before broiling. There is enough mixture for 2 baguettes!  Enjoy!!!

Delicious!  This was great and I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of toasting the olive-oil brushed bread a little first after reading other reviews.  I served this with caesar salads - had planned on serving these as appetizers and didn't get the timing right and I am glad I didn't...it was a great addition to the salads!

Amazing recipe. Cooked this for an Appy for my father when he came over for the first time to my place. He doesn't eat cheese and its almost impossible to get him to, but he ended up having 4 of these! Easy recipe for even a beginner like me to follow. Saved a bunch and used it a few days after on some sour dough bread and tasted awesome on it also. small pieces of sour dough would have been better cause the middle can get mushy though.

This was delicious.  I followed the suggestions of others and used two cans of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh romas.  Also, I used a little less olive oil, about 1/8 of a cup.  I did not use any cheese at all, and just toasted the bagette and kept the tomato mixture as a dip.

I love it! It was quick and easy, I have had to make it for my family 3 times in the last 2 weeks cause they loved it so much. !st time I couldn't get any fresh basil for it but it still tasted great. I also made it once with frsh basil and parm instead of mozz and I think I liked it more. All in all good solid bruschetta recipe.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic!  It's super quick and incredibly easy with an amazing flavor for so few ingredients.  Although I did cut down the basil by about half (I used fresh freeze-dried) and added in some oregano, this is one of the best tomato bruschetta toppings I've ever had.  We also thought this might be good as the base for an Italian, or even more greek style pizza as well.  We'll definitely be making this one over and over again!

I love bruschetta and this recipe was delicious!! I cut the cheese into pieces and put it on the bread before broiling it (for about a minute or two).  Other then that, I followed the recipe.  Will be making this again!

I absolutely love this recipe. I have made it numerous times and even my guests love it. The only thing I change besides eye balling the spices is that I bake the Bruschetta in the oven in a ramekin and serve it with a spoon to that each person can serve the amount they want. 

I tend to make a lot and if I were to pre-make all the slices it would be cold before everyone could eat them. The ramekin allows it to stay warm and the cheese gooey.

Make sure you toast the bread enough before adding the mixture and cheese. I didn't get to the point of browning, and it came out almost too moist! I used slices of mozzarella like someone suggested and it seemed to work well.  I will make this again!

I didn't have enough fresh tomatoes so I used a can of seasoned petite diced tomatoes (drained) and it still turned out delicious.  Party guests asked for the recipe ... which is always the best indicator.

These were good but there wasn't anything really special about them. It just tasted like typical bruschetta to me, but if that's what you're looking for this recipe will work.  I did find that the mixture was a pretty liquidy so after broiling you must eat immediately or the bread gets soggy.  Would be better for an entrée appetizer than hors d'oeuvres that are left to sit. I would make again but half the recipe and eat immediately.

This bruschetta recipe is wonderful-we made it for New Years and it was a hit! The only substitution made was placing the cheese on the bread and broiling it and adding the bruschetta mixture afterwards.

Made this for a christmas party and at home for new years and everybody at both events loved it!  The sun-dried tomatoes definitely add to it nicely as well as the fresh basil.  I use slices of mozarella instead of shredded to get a nice layer of cheese which also kind of holds the bruschetta on the bread! and instead of chopping tomatoes I add two cans of diced tomatoes.  I also broil just the bread with olive oil on it first to get it nice and crispy.  really fast and easy prep too..love it!

This will be a staple appetizer for me from now on. The flavor is divine. It is so delicious yet astoundingly simple to make. The best part is you can make the tomato mixture ahead of time and refrigerate until you need it. Then, when your guests arrive, just put it on the bread, pop it in the oven and voila! It just doesn't get any better than this!

After a few times making this Bruschetta, I've made a few modifications and have come up with a great party favorite that everyone raves about and begs for.  Adding in more garlic, more basil, and more balsamic really gives a much better flavor profile.  Thank you for a near perfect recipe!

The recipe is to die for!  Perfect for entertaining or a nice dinner at home.  I advise to cut up the sun-dried tomatoes with some kitchen shears so they are spread evenly throughout the mixture. This is a #1 recipe in my book!

Made this yesterday to snack on during the football game.  Very good!  I first lightly toasted both sides of my baguette slices, then topped with the tomato mixture and a mozzarella/provolone blend and then popped under the broiler just until the cheese had melted.  I meant to brush the bread with a little olive oil before toasting, but forgot.  Guess we were anxious to have at these!  I might try this next time with just fresh tomatoes and omit the sun dried tomatoes.  I think I might like that even better!!

This is one of the best bruschettas I've ever eaten.  And I made it!!  I followed the recipe for the tomato mixture exactly as is, except, because of a bountiful tomato crop, I used regular tomatoes instead of romas.  It was still fabulous.  If you do this, just make sure you get rid of some of the juicier parts of the tomatoes - romas are very meaty - so I used very meaty tomatoes and used less (since they are bigger).  I served it on bread rubbed with garlic and olive oil and broiled for just a minute to make them toasty.  No need for cheese.  But next time I may add a little fresh parm on the top.  But its definitely not needed.  Great how it is!!

Absolutely fabulous dish.  My guests ate every last bit.  I made the dish according to the recipe but made sure to use fresh mozzarella.  Such a hit for my dinner party.  Plan for at least 20-30 min for chopping all ingredients.

i also brushed the bread with olive oil and broiled it for a couple of minutes. I'm a garlic fan, so besides the chopped garlic, I like to give my bread a garlic rub too (the flavor is subtler for those who don't like to find garlic bits in their bruschetta). Thank you!

I made this three times last week for various holiday parties.  I wasn't able to find balsamic vinegar for the first batch and used the top layer of an old balsamic vinaigrette dressing and it actually worked out well.  However, I was able to find the actual vinegar for the next two batches and those did get a better reaction.  I used a chopper for roma tomatoes and hand chopped everything else, following the recipe closely except for a few things.  I did not bake the tomato mixture and instead just baked the sliced bread in the oven with some olive oil brushed on top.  I put the baked bread slices into a chip and dip bowl and presented the cold tomato mixture in the center with some parmesan cheese on top.  Huge hit!

OH MY GOODNESS! I served this with a bisque-style soup and it was a hit! I had one of my guests look up the recipe on AllRecipes and make it the next day. I did try to make it with larger french bread and that was not good. The bread got soggy. The combination of flavors was amazing, however. This is one of my current appetizer favorites. And it's  very easy to make!

I used this Bruschetta recipe to top my balsamic chicken and then sprinkled the mozzarella cheese over the top and broiled.  It was fabulous dinner, my husband loved it.  Would be great for company.

My guests loved it.  I thought it was missing something.  Maybe feta cheese instead of mozzarella?  Maybe kalamata olives???  That would be yummy.  I'll try that next time.  Also, as others reviewers stated:  BE VERY CAREFUL WHILE BROILING.  The time stated is WAY TOO LONG.  I burned my first batch to a crisp!!

I've made this twice now, and gotten compliments from everyone who ate it. Some even said it was the best bruschetta they've ever had. This will be an hors d'oeuvres staple in our house! The only change I made is that I add a little chopped shallot. Also, I take the baguette slices, dip one side in olive oil, and bake it in the oven until hard. Then when it comes out of the oven, I rub it with a clove of garlic and add the bruchetta on top.

This was my first try at Bruschetta and I was very pleased with the results. I prepared it with one small change, I used thin slices of fresh mozzarella instead of the shredded as one other cook suggested. Very tasty.

This was an extremly good recipe however I would: leave overnight to intensify flavours, add a handful of red onion or shallot, add a squirt of lemon juice, remove the skins and seeds from the tomotoes and add less balsamic vinegar

Absolutely DELICIOUS! Definitely make it the night before, if possible, and let it soak up the juices over night. I toasted the bread with the cheese on it and served the bruschetta in a bowl. Doesn't get soggy, and makes it easy if your bread slices are small like mine were. I'm definitely making this again!

AMAZING.  I loved them.  I added sweet onion to the mixture and fresh parsley as well.  Great tip: And in assembling, I toasted the baguettes, then put slices of mozarella cheese on each, then broiled again til melted.  Then served.  Everyone can dish on their own bruschetta. HUGE hit.

Fantastic!  I made two alterations to make it even easier.  First, I buy crostinis at Whole Foods Market instead of slicing and toasting a baguette.  They are more tasty I think.  Second, I use sundried tomato paste instead of chopped sundried tomatoes.  The flavor gets more evenly distributed, and the mix is a little easier to spread onto the bread.

Fantastic!  My only change was to add Parmesan cheese with the mozzerella cheese to add a depth of flavor.  Make the tomato mixture in the morning or the day before to let the flavors mix together for the best flavor.

Delicious!!  I couldn't find sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil so I bought them,poured olive oil over them, and let them sit overnight.  It was so good!!  I toasted the bread and and let my guests dip their own tomato mixture on top themselves, served cold....like Olive Garden's.  Excellent.

Wonderful! I've been making it all summer with local tomatoes. I have varied the cheese with good results, but don't change anything else as the recipe is perfect as is. (I forgot the pepper and noticed the difference right away.) I used roasted garlic bread (from Costco). I made way to much the first time (4x the recipe) and cooked the leftover with tomato sauce for a terrific pasta sauce.

I have made this recipe without change to the ingredients several times and it's a winner everytime.  The flavor is very robust and the balsamic vinegar is wonderful.  I usually make the mixture the night before to let the vinegar soak the tomatoes.  I also toast the French bread on both sides and then add the tomatoes.  I have occasionally substituted the French bread for other breads, but to me, French works the best.

A sure hit at every dinner party I organize. It's been variously described as 'better than in the restaurants', 'truly Italian' and 'better than Oxford high table'.

Loved this recipe!  I thought that the balsamic vinegar taste was quite strong... may not put as much in next time.  But others that tried it said it was amazing!  Will definitely make again!

In a word, WOW!  This is the best brushcetta recipe I have found.  I made it for a party and it was a definite hit.  The sundried tomatoes and balsamic vinegar really make this recipe extra special.  And it is so easy!  Great for potlucks or a quick hors d'oeuvers for unexpected guests!

awesome stuff. i only used fresh tomatoes and it was fine, tons of compliments, and the biggest compliment of all: they were gone in a flash, as fast as i could put them out. have tried two ways: toasted baguette with cheese and let people top with their own tomato mix, and topped with tomato mix and cheese, then toasted. i prefer the first way, because then i can pile the mixture on, but i think the 2nd way works best for an hors 'doevre type serving. made these yesterday for a graduation party, and will make again this weekend for a birthday party-- yum! best with fresh tomatoes and basil, i am just waiting for my tomatoes to set some fruit!! thanks!

Very Good--When me and my husband go to dinner we always try the Bruschetta if they have it....This definetely was one of the better ones we have had.  The only thing I changed was the cheese--Kraft has a parmesan/mozzarella mix that I used on top....I really like the parmesan taste on Bruschetta....Great Recipe!

nice and fresh, followed suggestions in reviews and was sorry - next time will add full amount of garlic and balsamic vinegar, pretty bland.  did not care for the mozzarella cheese will definitely use parmesan next time.  thanks for the recipe.

Really flavorful bruschetta.  I made individual toasts for a picnic and used the suggestion to melt a blanket of fresh mozzarella cheese over the top that helped keep the fresh tomato mixtures in place.  Don't use dried basil if you can find fresh!

wonderful recipe and very easy to make!! I made it exactly as is, giving it 4 stars because the garlic was a little too overpowering. I will start off with one next time because the balsamic vinegar really does bring out the flavor in it

I made this recipe for the football game this weekend.  I loved it, found it very easy to make, especially now that tomatoes are in season in MN.  I would however not make it again for a football game, as the appetizers tend to sit for longer periods of time, and the bread didn't hold up well.  I would however make this as an appetizer for a dinner party anytime, where it will be eaten immediately.  One of my suggestions would be to toast the baguettes prior to adding the mixture on top, which would make the bread hold up better.  I also didn't have any sun dried tomatoes on hand, so just used more of my own garden tomatoes, but roasted them prior to adding them to the recipe.  This is a great recipe, I would definitely make it again, but I would plan it better to insure I had all the ingredients on hand as some are not staples in my cupboard.

This was really yummy.  I followed a few suggestions...toasted bread, added cheese, popped in broiler again to melt. Served Bruschetta mix on side.  Used 2 cans petit diced tomatoes, drained instead of fresh...fresh not in season.  This was a hit!

Best bruschetta I have ever had. We used fresh ingrediants and let the mixture set for 25 minutes to marinate and it was incredible!!! Someone suggested canned tomatoes and I think that is a definite no-no here. I like a little more balsamic vinegar too. I use a jar of marinated sun dried tomatoes in olive oil and spices. Use the olive oil from the jar in the recipe and it just blends so perfectly.

Ever since watching Julie and Julia, I have been looking for a great recipe for Bruschetta.  This is definitely it.  Very nice flavors.  It also looks very pretty with your oven toasted bread and the drained tomato mixture on top.  Skip the cheese. I could eat these all day.  Enjoy!  Thanks for a truly good recipe.

This a great recipe. I heated the bruschetta and tossed it with spaghetti noodles, added chicken breast on top and drizzled it with balsamic glaze.

Delish!
This recipe is delicious, I will definitely make this again. I didn't change any ingredients. The sun dried tomatoes make this recipe. I like to stay with fresh ingredients for flavor. I also made this a day before, drain off any juice before serving if you have any. I also grill the bread on a grill pan, I brushed with olive oil, grilled and rubbed with fresh garlic. The garlic melts in the bread when it's still warm. I serve cold with the bread I don't use the mozzarella cheese.

Absolutely the best bruschetta I've ever had!! My 22-yr-old son loved it, adding that he usually doesn't even like tomatoes or cheese!  Followed the recipe exactly until the end, using thin slices of fresh mozzarella.  As for quantity, I was able to cover about 20 slices of bread; half of them were coated with olive oil, the other half with butter.  My family voted that the buttered slices were better.

Awesome! I did serve this differently. I toasted the bread on my George Forman grill and then set it out along with the bruschetta and shredded Parmesan cheese and let everyone make their own. The bread is a little crumy but boy is this delicious!

This was so delicious!  I let the mixture sit in the fridge for about an hour so that the herbs and spices would really settle into the tomatoes.  This was the perfect appetizer to my Italian Fiesta.  Thanks!

Now that I've come online to review this recipe I made over the weekend, I realized I never topped with cheese and broiled! We simply enjoyed this on slices of fresh baguette... when hunger strikes, I forget to finish a recipe when it's "Good enough" as it is :) In fact, I'm not sure if I would've liked it as much with the cheese. We had really good, fresh ingredients (namely, the tomatoes, basil, and bread) to make this and loved every bite.

The basic recipe is a good one. I tasted it after letting the tomatoes marinate for a couple of hours and found it lacking something.  I happened to have some dried figs on hand, so I chopped up about 1/4C to 1/2C and added to the tomato mixture, let it marinate for another hour.  I didn't have mozzarella.  Instead, I brushed the bread rounds (I used a ciabatta loaf) with olive oil, toasted them under the broiler, then heaped the tomato mixture on, sprinkled all over with grated parmagianna reggiano and served.  My guests absolutely loved the end product.

So Good!!  I like to try the recipe as written the first time but the store did not have sun-dried tomatoes so I subbed sun-dried tomato pesto which was great!  Second time I used sun dried tomatoes and also very good, but I think the pesto slightly won us over for taste!

Wow! This is one of the best recipes I have made on the site! (and I have made quite a few!) I did use just dried tomatoes (not packed in oil) and I used extra virgin olive oil. It didn't take long at all an even my husband liked it! And regardless of my diet I ate SIX pieces! And I know what I'm having for breakfast tomorrow!

This was very tasty.  I really enjoyed the addition of the sun-dried tomatoes, and found myself making sure I got one in every bite.  Next time I'll add a few more.  I eyeballed the oil, and used less than half called for--just enough to give the tomatoes a little sheen.  I also used dried basil, since that's what I had on hand, and omitted the mozzarella, and served on gluten-free crackers instead of bread.  Hated to do both, but am watching the waistline and am gluten sensitive.  It was still very good.  I knocked off one star because it could use a little something, a little extra flavor.  Maybe a bit more balsamic vinegar.  But I am definitely keeping this one to experiment further.  Thanks for a keeper!

This is now my default pizza recipe! It's been a huge hit with the family.  I've made a couple changes.  I caramelize the onions.  I also replace the jalapeno (which, personally, I think has no business on a pizza) with sauteed yellow peppers.  I also use fresh chopped basil instead of dried.  Love it!

This recipe is so tasty! The garlic gives it a pretty good kick. I'd like to try it sometime with roasted garlic instead of raw. It's definitely a go-to appetizer for me.

By far the best bruschetta recipe I have ever come across!  It's a hit a parties and people always ask me to continue making this wonderful dish!  Definitely deserves 5 stars!  

I just add a little bit more garlic (I like extra garlic in everything) and I also add in some extra fresh basil.  I also substituted the mozzarella cheese with some thin slices of asiago or parmesan cheese.

My husband prefers this without the sun-dried tomatoes, and uses less of the bruschetta mix per bread/cheese.  Otherwise, we adore it!  Delicious and relatively healthy - sometimes, it makes up our whole dinner.

Very good considering I am not a huge tomato fan!  Used fresh tomatoes from the garden and omitted the sun-dried tomatoes as I didn't have any.  Subbed fresh mozzarella instead of the shredded.  I accidentally layered backwards with the cheese right on top of the bread then tomatoes on top of cheese, was still good, but I can see how putting the cheese on top is helpful as it will help keep the tomatoes on place when you try to eat it!  Will make again

Great, easy recipe.  I have made it both with and without the sun dried tomatoes and it's great either way. I add capers to give it a little more flavor, but it definitely doesn't need them. Must make it at least a day before serving so the flavors blend, kinda bland if you don't.

Delicious!!  I'm not a big fan of tomato but this was delicious and both the hubby and kids who love tomatoes couldn't get enough of it!  Definitely making this again.

Update: A couple years later I'm still making this recipe and it's still fantastic! Feel free to play with you vinegars, a mix of balsamic and apple cider, or red wine vinegar all bring out nice flavors.  If your using dried basil let the whole mixture sit overnight.  I personally always make this a day ahead, the flavors soak together overnight and taste amazing the next day.  For the dried tomatoes I have never found them in oil in the small town where I live, so boil you dried tomatoes for 3 minutes and voila! you don't notice the difference, again though mine sits overnight.

Followed the recipe but didn't care for the end result. Flavor just didn't work for me or the other people who tried it.

Awesome!  I chose not to use sun-dried tomatoes, and I added about 2 Tbsp of capers.  It turned out fantastic!

I liked this recipe, but my husband likes a more traditional bruschetta. I think the Balsamic Vinegar scared him. I ran out of bread the first night and was able to use it as a topping for some chicken the next. Turned out great!

This is so good!  The first time I make recipes I do it exact to the recipe, and this one did not disappoint.  The only thing I can even think of that may be added is some diced sweet onion.  I may try that, but will definately make this over and over again!  Thanks for a great recipe!
Jan 6, 2012 - I had a craving for these again, so I did a double workout at the gym, came home with a fresh baguette, plum tomatoes and fresh basil.  I am biting into these as I write, these are to good for words!  I now dip my brush into the juice of the tomato mixture, spread it on the bread and brown in 400* oven prior to piling the bruchetta mixture on top.  Today I added some sweet onions finely chopped...yum yum!!

Made this for a Thanksgiving appetizer, and it was a big hit!  I forgot the salt and pepper and it was still awesome. I followed another reader's advice and made it the night before. We used a baguette and melted some grated zesty mozzarella on the slices. Thanks for the great recipe.

Wow, finally a recipe that actually deserves the high rating! Made this for a grand opening at my husband's new business & although I absolutely hate tomatoes, no one was around to sample it before it was served, so I tried it myself and I couldn't stop eating it! Did everything exactly as stated in the recipe and it came out great. Made this again on other ocassions and served it cold without the cheese & still fabulous! Love this!!!

Delicious! I used dried basil, and omitted the olive oil since my sun-dried tomatoes were pretty oily. I let the mixture set in the fridge for approx. 3 hours, then cubed mozzarella since it was fresh, and stirred it into the mixture before placing on the baguette slices and broiling.
Simply divine! I highly recommend this recipe!!

This recipe was made without any changes, for my garden club picnic held outside on a members beautiful patio. Instead of heating under the broiler we put the pans with the bruschetta inside her high heated grill outside. It crispt up the bottom and melted the cheese on top. The only change I would make is to chop the basil a little smaller.It was met with rave reviews  and I have been told to bring it to our next garden club food event.

YUUUUUM!
I LOVED this recipe. And so did my mom. We had it for lunch instead of an appetizer, and we didnt use roma tomatoes, we used fresh tomatoes from our garden and the basil from our garden. I think the basil is what made the recipe. Anyways, we were a little nervous that the tomatoes we were using would be too soggy, but the bread soaked it right up and it was PERFECT!! I am definitely going to make this for the holidays this year!

This is an excellent recipe.  Will definitely used it again.  I will probably cut down on the garlic next time as we don't like a strong garlic flavor.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used it as a dip instead of putting it all together and melting the cheese.

Extremely flavorful!!  Wish I would have read the reviews where people said they put sliced mozzarella on before the tomato mix and broiled.  The shredded cheese ended up all over the place and would have been better under.  But the flavors in this were amazing!!

We loovvved this!  You really have to wait a full day to have all the spices marinade together.  Eating it in the same day doesn't work.  Next time, we're doubling the recipe because 2 of us knocked this off within 12 hours, it was that good.

I was skeptical on how good this was going to be because of all the high ratings...this was such a perfect bruschetta. I love that the sun-dried tomatoes give a tiny extra zing. It was eaten right after making it and everyone continued on with tortilla chips after the bread ran out! I want to make this for a shower I've been asked to cook for and so thank you to another reviewer for stating it may of been too garlicky making it the night before

Really good. I brush my bread slices with olive oil, sprinkle with a pinch of salt, and bake for 10 minutes before putting on the tomato mixture. While the bread is baking, I do the tomato mix.

I made this to take to a party -without every having it first.  I figure that it must be good with a rating like it has.  The recipe did not disappoint!  I didn't bring anything except an empty bowl back home.

This made my bread soggy. If I make these again I won't use vinegar and get rid of some of the tomato's juice. I would add more garlic too.

Great, simple dish. Took it to a weekly girls gathering. The only tweak I may make is one less clove of garlic. I love garlic, but in a social setting heavy garlic breath isn't the best. The best part of this dish is how beautiful they look!

Easy to make, and THE BEST bruschetta i have ever had. i doubled the garlic as well, left out the sun tomatoes, and used fresh rolled mozarella cut into about 1/2 inch slices to melt on top. Will make again and again, was gone in less than 10 minutes!

Delicious bruschetta. Mine turned out a little bit soggy but I think that's because I didn't broil the bread long enough - definitely don't skip this step!

Yummy! I made these for appetizers a few hours before a BBQ dinner I was making. Served this along with grilled artichokes, garlic mayo aioli and lots of wine! Everyone was very happy before dinner and kept raving on the bruschetta!

This is outstanding bruschetta. The sun-dried tomatoes add delicious tang to the dish. The mozzarella cheese, while not entirely necessary, is a great completion. I made this for the first time for a potluck dinner and they were gone immediately. I received so many compliments.

Wow this recipe was really good! I made this for my family and they are all gone!! This brushetta is great for the perfect Italian appetizer, or just as a yummmmy snack :)...But before you start to slice your bread, make sure that you slice the bread about 1/4-1/2in. thick, so you get a great crunch and a big bight of brushetta.

Delicious, but (like most bruschetta) it's best to leave this overnight so that the flavours can really come together. I added more garlic (but I always add more garlic) and I also added a bit of diced red onion. The restaurant I work at adds diced jalapenos as well for an extra kick, so if you like it spicy, I'd go that route!

Excellent recipe-tasted very similar to a popular Italian restaurant chain.  Very important to use fresh roma tomatoes (don't used canned) and fresh basil.  I also chopped the sun-dried tomatoes since they were pretty big.  I also subbed fresh grated Parmesian for mozzerella.

So amazingly delicious.  I used one can (I think it was a 14 oz can) of petite diced tomatoes instead of the 6 romas and fresh basilTasted fresh and delicious.  I made it the night before a party.  Sprayed sliced baguette with olive oil Pam and broiled and served it with the bruschetta on the side so people could help themselves.  No need for cheese.

Excellent. I added a bit more salt and pepper to suit my taste, but otherwise followed the recipe. I like cheese, but this was so good I ate it plain. It also worked well heated up as a topping for butternut squash ravioli.

Great recipe! Be sure to watch the bread as it bakes, I never knew it could brown so quickly! I use day-old bread discounted from a local sandwich shop and it makes this recipe just delicious.

They were devoured in less than 10 minutes at my New Years Party.  I used 1 tablespoon of freeze dried basil because I couldn't find fresh ANYWHERE that wasn't really expensive.  I did toast the bread first with EVOO.

Very tasty as followed. We couldn't find sun-dried tomatoes in oil so we used dried. Left it sitting all afternoon and put it on toasted whole-wheat baguette.

I left out the sundried tomatoes and made the toasts (10 minutes in a 425 degree oven)  and served them along side the tomato mixture and it was fabolous!  I've been making the "Balsamic Bruschetta" from this site and they're very similar and both very good.

FABULOUS RECIPE!!!!    I made this for a Halloween party and it was a huge success!  I doubled the recipe to make sure I had enough, I ended up with about 2 cups of bruchetta left at the end of the night.  After doubling the recipe I did add a couple extra cloves of garlic.  I made it in the morning, which gave it all day to really set in and let the flavors develop, which made it absolutely wonderful.  I would even suggest making it the night before - it would be perfect the next night!    I used block mozzarella, as suggested by other reviewers, cutting it in 1/8 inch slices.  I placed the mozzarella on the bread and broiled it for a couple of minutes just until the cheese melted.  Then I simply placed everything out and allowed people to put the bruchetta on themselves, it prevented the bread from becoming soggy.    This will definitely go into my normal rotation.

I made these for a party last night and they were a huge hit. I added about a 1/4 cup of chopped onion and cut the oil to 2 tablespoons. I didn't have any sundried tomatos, but it was still amazing. I think the next time I make this I'll do 1/2 the batch with fresh parmesan instead of mozz to see which is better.

Awesome way to use up some of the bounty of tomatoes from the garden.  I made up a batch of the filling and stored it in a container in my refrigerator. Anytime I wanted a little snack, I just sliced off a piece of French bread, toasted it lightly, added the topping and some cheese and then broiled it for a few minutes in my toaster/oven. Quick, easy, and delicious!

This recipe doesn't necessarily need another 5 star review, but I loved this so much I could not resist.  I brought this to our monthly wine club last weekend and everyone raved about it.  I didn't do the whole broiling thing because it's so hot here right now; just piled the tomato mixture onto toasted ciabatta slices and topped with a shaving of asiago cheese.  Awesome recipe!

I've made this several times.  Everyone loves it at parties!  The only modificiations I've made is a use a wider loaf of bread than a traditional baguette (the tomatoe mixture seems to slide off the smaller pieces of bread and there is too much of the mixture).  If you have your heart set on using a thinner baguette, buy two of them.  And I buy fresh mozzarella and dice it and mix it right in with the rest of the mixture.  It comes out well and then there isn't the risk of the cheese sliding off the top of the bruschetta in a sheet.  YUM!!!!

Phenomenal!!  My hubs and I both were amazed how good this was.  I want to host a party just so I can serve this as an appetizer.  I just made this today, and it's definitely one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten.  I used fresh basil and fresh mozzarella, and it was worth the extra dollars. Yum!!

Whew, this was stand-out delicious. In effort to use up 5lbs of roma tomatoes I made this recipe alongside another highly rated version off this site. As soon as I tried this, the other "contender" just seemed bland. I made as written and nothing needs tweaking, I may try to add more roma tomatoes to these ingredient amounts (lots of juice in the serving bowl) but am kinda afraid it might diminish the flavor punch. I should say too I can take or leave sundried tomatoes, and balsamic vinegar and I have had some issues in the past. It mixed up strong, just smelling the bowl I was sure it would be too much for me but I was totally wrong and loved every bite. I ended up not using cheese at all and serving cold. An absolute winner, thanks so much for sharing.

I love bruschetta, and had to try this one because of all the rave reviews!  Overall, it was really nice.  Fresh basil made a difference, for sure!  I do have to say that I'm a huge garlic fan, and still thought there was too much garlic in this recipe.  I used 3 rather large cloves.  I would recommend using three small cloves or 2 large cloves.  Otherwise, it was PERFECT!

Bruschetta is standard in my household, it's made for holiday's and a lot during the summer for a light dinner. I have never melted cheese on bruschetta before but I have cut up fresh mozzarella and put that in the mix.  I loved the addition of the sun-dried tomatoes, I didn't have anything left over however the melted cheese is not really necessary.  It was delicious without the cheese all together.

I made this last week and I must say the brushetta mixture was very, very good. However, after countless attempts to making the perfect bread using the suggested French baguette, it just never was great. None of the methods did the brushetta mixture justice. Then I finally found it. I used Sara Lee Sheephearders bread. I'm sure any bread like this would work though. I used as many of the end slices as the loaf had (as these slices have a heavy crust). Cut into small to medium size pieces. Sprayed each piece with Pam olive oil spray. Then baked in a 400 degree oven until lightly toasted. Then sprinkled some pieces with shredded mozzarella cheese and some pieces with fresh parmesan cheese. (do not use the canned stuff!) Then back in the oven until melted. While the cheese was melting I put the brushetta mixture in a bowl and into the microwave on high for 2 minutes. Or until warm/hot. Then placed it all on the table, allowing everyone to dish up as much of the mixture on their bread slices. They were absolutely delicious! We all loved this way better then the French baguette bread. (Oh, on the mixture; (1)I did cut the oil down to 1/8 cup. It doesn't need more when/if you use the sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil. (2)I used 3 very large cloves of garlic. Us this much only if you love garlic, like we do. (3)use as much fresh basil as you'd like. You can't go wrong with more! And if you don't have fresh basil, save the recipe until you do! It's an absolute must. My thanks to Lauri

My wife bugs to make this all the time. It's like the next best thing. Love to rap it in bite size Puff Pastries. MMMM! One thing I do differently, is in stead of adding the 1/4 cup EVOO, I just used the sundried tomamtoes juice/oil. Extra flave and theres plenty.

For best results, slice baguette and brush with olive oil.  Bake for 5 minutes at 350.  Then put the bruschetta mix on the bread, top with mozzarella, and bake for another 5 minutes.  This was the best bruschetta I've ever had.  My guests raved about it!

I have made this twice, the first time I did not brush with olive oil and put in oven-BIG MISTAKE, this is a MUST for this recipe.  The 2nd try I got rave reviews, I made them for my sister bday dinner as an appetizer for spaghetti and they were gone in 5 minutes, even the kids scarfed them down. I made a few changes, 1)I used canned petit diced tomatoes with basil and oregeno, so much easier, faster and cheaper! 2)used sun dried tomato spread(pesto) again, easier, fast and cheaper! 3) DEFINITELY brush with olive oil and brown bread first!! 4)I put sliced provolone cheese to "seal" in tomato mixture then topped that with shredded parmesan cheese. These make this recipe much quicker and more cost efficient!!  Will make this part of our regular cycle !!

This is great!  I like to use some grape tomatoes in place of 2 of the romas, just to add a little variety.  I've served this to guests and they always enjoy it.

I've made this recipe at least ten times now and each time it gets nothin' but rave reviews.  Don't over do it on the balsamic, a little bit goes a long way.  As for prep styles, we've done everything from putting it on grilled bread, to putting it on slices and broiling it, to simply spooning it on fresh bread.  You can't go wrong no matter how you slice it.

Terrific bruschetta recipe for all tomato lovers!  Two changes: I sauteed a bit of garlic in olive oil and drizzled that over the bread before broiling it, and I replaced the shredded mozzarella with veryyy thin slices.
Thanks Laurie!

This was a big hit at my family reunion this week end! Every one including my husband that doesnt like tomatoes loved it.  I was a little scared it was going to get soggy after a while but it didnt. I did substitute garden tomatoes for the romas and used dried basil instead of fresh.  It was still awsome!!!

I tried this recipe as is and it has a major flaw.  DO NOT cook the bread with the bruschetta!  It was extremely soggy.  I'm giving 4 stars because the flavor was outstanding.  Next time I will cook the bread with the mozzarella only and will serve the bruschetta separately.

Oh My!!!!!  This is the bomb!  Here's a party time-saver...I  went to Costco and bought a bag of Nonni's Panetini Oven Baked Garlic Parmeson Toasts.  They are perfect for dipping into this Bruschetta

Made this last night as an appetizer.  I brushed both sides of the banquette with olive oil and broiled them for 1 1/2 - 2 minutes.  I then turned them over and put a piece of fresh mozzarella on and broiled until cheese melted.  Served cold with brushetta on top.  They were good (would rate it a 4).  Today I took the leftovers and put more mozzarella cheese on top & broiled about 4 minutes.  They were so much better eaten hot (thus the 5 rating). In the future I'm going to broil & assemble just how I did yesterday, wait for them to cool & then put more mozzarella on top & put in the fridge until my company arrives - then put them under broiler again and serve hot.

This was yummy.  I added more basil and used fresh mozzarella instead of shredded and cut it into round slices and put it on top of the tomatoes.

This recipe was great! The fresh tomatoes made this recipe a nice light appetizer that's easy on the stomach, and the other ingredients really made this a very flavorful treat! As another reviewer recommended, I made the tomato mix the night before so the flavors had even more time to blend. Two things were surprising to me: first, I (of course) had to taste the tomato blend before putting it on the bread - and it was so good I may have to make the double tomato mix again as a stand-alone tomato salad. Secondly, and more surprising, I think this may have been even better left over - I just put it back in the oven on broil for a few minutes and the bread, which had soaked up the flavor overnight, crisped right back up! I'd definitely make this again.  Edit: Last night I made this recipe doubled for a party - everyone here in AZ thought it was salsa by looking at it! Haha. But everyone was asking who made it and thought it was delicious. I was very excited to have leftovers.

This has been an instant hit at every party I have served this at.  A few suggestions...when I don't have really good ripe tomatoes available I will substitute with 1 can of chopped tomatoes (Italian style works well) and I will add some chopped grape tomatoes to add some additional texture and flavor.  Make sure you drain the canned tomatoes really well.  I agree with some of the other reviews that using fresh basil is much better than dried.  I have also used the sun dried tomatoes packed in oil and those that are not and both tasted good to me.  I would definitely make ahead to allow the flavors to infuse.  Just a really great recipe!

Really great recipe and wished I was able to give it 4.5 stars instead since I think a few changes need to be made.  First, you should really use white balsamic vinegar if you can - the traditional/brown gave it an unappealing colour.  I would also recommend slicing the mozzarella into slices to place atop the bruschetta for melting since the shredded was everywhere and difficult to keep in place.  Even better is if you broil the bread with the cheese atop first and then allow people to spoon as much bruschetta they want atop afterwards (like a dip).  I also diced my sun-dried tomatoes and would recommend trying to get rid of as much oil as possible - the sauce was quite runny as it is.  Other than that, this was a fantastic recipe and I will be making it for a potluck with these changes in mind!

I'm not a huge fan of bruschetta, but this was tasty. Like others, I brushed the pieces of bread with olive oil and put them in the broiler for 2-3 minutes. This helped them from being soggy later. The only changes ingredient-wise that I made were to use multigrain bread and dry sundried tomatoes. I thought the sundried tomatoes in oil might make the mixture too oily when coupled with the olive oil. If I make this again, I will definitely buy mozzarella cheese and slice it myself or pre-sliced mozzarella. Shredded was all I had on hand, and it was a bit of a mess trying to get it to stay on the mounds of tomato.

This is an amazing recipe.  I've gone out to eat with friends and order Bruschetta just to hear "This isn't as good as the Bruschetta you make"  LOL...great compliment!  Anyhow...I make a few small changes.  First of all, since I use sundried tomatoes packed in olive oil I use the olive oil from that to add another layer of depth in the flavor.  I add a few rounds of red onion (I keep the rounds whole so I can pick them out as I don't like onions.)  I add a cup or so of fresh grated parmesean cheese to the tomato mixture.  Then I make it all the day before except I reserve the parmesean that I add and about half of the fresh basil and add it in just before serving.  As per others suggestions I put the mozzerella (or sometimes even provolone so it's real stringy/melty/cheesy) on the sliced bread and toast that under the broiler.  Then people can add their own Bruschetta mixture on top fresh. Easier to feed a crowd that way and ensure it's fresh and not soggy.  FIVE STAR recipe!

Even though my husband dumbs down the fancy name of "Double Tomato Bruschette" to "mini pizzas," whenever I serve them they are gobbled up really fast and I get compliments up the wazoo! It's yummy, fancy, easy and pretty all at once.

One of my favorite recipes, and most requested.  I simply make it chilled, though, and serve with chips or bread b/c it's easiest at a gathering.

This is wonderful bruschetta, but I have one suggestion and one caveat:  one, if you can find fresh mozarella, do so!  Chop it up in very small cubes and use it instead of the shredded.  The caveat:  DO NOT substitute dried basil!  The fresh is soooo good.

I've made this this 3 times in the past 2 weeks! It's amazing! I added a 1/2 tablespoon of sugar, I use diced tomato, and I put olive oil and a light layer of chesse on bread for the first 2 minutes browning. It's wonderful!

Absolutely exquisite.  I used organic tomatoes and added about 2 Tbsp sugar.  Also, I made it ahead and let it set in the fridge overnight, which is convenient but allows the garlic and basil to take on overpowering flavors.

Mmmmmm was the response from all the adults who tried this at my mother's birthday party.  We loved the combination of the two kinds of tomatoes - fresh and sun dried.  Fresh basil an absolute must.

I would give this more stars if I could... the sun-dried tomatoes really add so much flavor- make sure you get the kind soaking in oil.  and make sure to use fresh basil, that was also key.  We sliced mozzarella and put it on the bruschetta and I think it was probably better than shredded cheese.  So yummy!

Though I was unable to taste this after I made it I can say it smelled wonderful...I am giving this a four star however because during the party where it was served I noted that though people claimed to like it only one or two people ate more than one piece.

This is some of the best bruschetta I have ever made!! The combination of the roma tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes and garlic is perfect. It's quick and easy. Fresh basil is key...don't think it will taste the same with dried. I'd add some parmesan cheese in with the mozzerella for an extra kick.

Not enough stars to say how much I enjoyed this recipe! I like it better than the one we get when we go to Olive Garden (and their really good!)!! I used some minced garlic that you get in the bottle to make it easier for me.

I want to give this recipe 10 stars!  It was umbelievable delicious.  This is something I would expect to get in a good restaurant. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about the sun dried tomatoes because it did not look appetizing, but WOW, it tastes awesome with the other ingredients.  I chopped all the ingredients into small pieces, I know the recipe did not mentione it for all of the ingredients, but I think it works better.  I made it for 2 servings and that yielded 3 slices of bread toppled with the zesty tomato concoction.  I served it for myself for lunch with some soup, yummie!  I can't wait to share this appetizer with someone.  Thanks Loll!!!

This was amazing! I have made it several times and it's been a big hit. I prefer cheese slices instead of shredded though and add more garlic.

Absolutely Delicious!  The sun-dried tomatoes really give it a different taste.  I did make a few changes.  I brushed the baguette slices with olive oil and toasted them for a few minutes under the broiler before I topped them with the tomato mixture.  This made the bread not turn soggy.  Instead of using shredded mozzarella, I used slices of fresh mozzarella.  I put a slice on each piece of bread and then put the tomato mixture on top and broiled them for a few minutes.

My boyfriend and I aren't huge fans of tomatos, but we both liked this recipe! I omitted the sun dried tomatos since I didn't have any on hand, and I toasted the bread in the toaster oven before putting the toppings on.  On half of them, I used a blend of romano, parmesan and asiago cheeses instead of mozzarella and it tasted good as well.

This is the bruchetta recipe I've been looking for!!!  I had some great bruchetta in a very fancy steakhouse and they served it on French baguette toast spread with Boursin cheese and then topped with the bruchetta.  I followed this recipe to a "T" but omitted the mozzarella and substituted the Boursin spread underneath instead.  It was wonderful!  Thanks for sharing!!!

This is another recipe that I have made multiple times with great success.  I omitted the sun dried tomatoes because I never went through the effort to find a place to buy them.  I also double the amount of bread because I tend to have way too much tomato mixture left over after topping the original amount of bread.  I would not call this a problem though, because extra bruschetta is never a bad thing.  I also like to crack just a little bit of extra pepper on top of the mozzarella to give it a just a little more kick.

Very easy to prepare; next time I will just use a can of petite diced tomatoes to cut down on prep time. I forgot to put the balsamic vinegar in the mix and upon remembering, we just dipped the bruschetta in some balsamic. You definately need the balsamic in this recipe because it totally changes the taste. Very beautiful presentation. Next time, I will also brush the bread slices with reserve olive oil.

Perfect!  Quite possibly the best tomato bruschetta I've ever made.  The fresh tomatoes and the sun-dried tomates were the ideal balance. Like the other reviewers said, follow this one to the letter and you can't miss.

Wonderful!  My best friend is Italian and I was always requesting for her to make Bruschetta for me.  No more!  The olive oil divided, I used the other 2 Tbsp and brushed on the baguette slices before broiling.  I also used Romano instead of mozzarella for a little more of a kick.  Thanks for sharing!

I have never made bruschetta but have watched many cooks do it.  My bruschetta turned out good but the garlic and balsamic vingar were much too strong.  I would recommend cutting those amounts in half.

This was excellent.  For all you garlic lovers there is just the right amount in here.  I can't wait to make this with fresh tomatoes from my garden.  Store bought just aren't the same.

This is my new favorite appetizer recipe.  The sun-dried tomatoes and vinegar give it a special pizzazz, but, like others suggest, be careful on how much vinegar you use.  Half the amount called for in the recipe is quite sufficient.

This is the best Bruschetta recipe ever, andvery easy to prepare. I added more garlic and a few tablespoons of shredded parmesan cheese to the mixture. Toasted the baguette slices and served, allowed individuals to spoon mixture onto slices. The sun-dried tomatoes definately add a unique taste to this recipe. Will be making this again!!

Yummy!  I don't like sundried tomatoes in the produce section.  They taste like firm tomato paste pieces to me, BUT I bought & used the sundried tomatoes in oil - olive oil - anyway.  'Can't say I want to eat them from the jar, but I did like 'em - & the difference they added to bruschetta.  The cheese was a nice choice, too.  I'd only had it with a squeeze of lemon (no cheese), which is very good, also.  Too bad (not really) I'm the only one who will even try it (secret "yay!") ... :)  PS I used oil from the jar of tomatoes.

Brush the baguette slices with olive oil (flavored with basil or garlic if available). Fresh basil is key.  Also added some oregano. Place tomato mix on baguette, then cover with thin slice of mozzarella to help keep tomato in place.  Broil til cheese melts.  Love, love this.  Husband even enjoyed it cold.

So delicious every time.  I make according to the recipe - I just do one little extra thing.  Brush the crusts of your baguette with olive oil, makes the crust light and crispy

I don't normally leave reviews, but this time I had too! Made this last night and followed the recipe exactly! Outstanding!!! I will be making this a lot more! Next time the only difference I will make is use fresh Mozzarella cheese to help hold it in place.

Deliciously fresh flavor!  Loved it.  This will be my go-to bruschetta recipe for the future.  I did not broil it.  I put it in a bowl and served it with Panera Bread's Asiago Cheese baguette (slice thick).  DELICIOUS!  I made a double batch for a small party and there was not one SCRAP left for me to take home, unfortunately.  As with all bruschettas, take the time to peel and seed your tomatoes before using them.  Next time I may try adding a little red onion too.  A winner!

I have to say, I really loved this recipe! The topping was perfect, and it's smart to toast the bread for a minute or two before adding the topping. The bread had a little crunch but was not too crunchy. Not sure if I would do the cheese on top again, but that's personal taste. Nice job.

Slight modification. We toasted bread slices under broiler  for about 40 sec, they burn quickly!!. Then flipped for another few seconds. Then put thin slice fresh mospzzerella and again for a few secs under broiler. Then top with tomato mix. No cooking the tomatoes. Yum!

Exactly what I was looking for! I used a container of crumbled feta cheese and a handful of parmesan cheese instead of the mozzarella.

Its the BEST!!Made this for my friends at a weekend getaway. It was a perfect appetizer to start out our evening. Fresh basil, & in my opinion the sun dried tomatoes in oil where definitely the key ingredients. I added sliced Italian ciabata  black olives. Delicious!

Certainly the best bruschetta I've ever had. I skipped the mozzarella part but still really good. (I didn't have any on hand.) Thank you for this recipe!!! Can't wait to make again.

Delicious. I have made this for several dinner parties and it is always a hit and gone very quickly. I love how simple it is to make, now if I want a delicious bruschetta I can head to the kitchen instead of a restaurant.

I made this recently for a barbecue with friends, and it was great. I did make a few changes. I seeded the plum tomatoes before chopping them, and let the tomato mixture sit for a couple hours to blend the flavors. I also skipped the cheese and the broiling afterwards. I just put the toasted baguette slices out on the table with the bowl of the tomato mixture, and everyone just helped themselves. It got good reviews from everyone, and I will definitely make it again.

So so SO good... I just used torta bread sliced in half and used A LOT of basil since my garden is going off and it was perfect perfect perfect!!!  I also used all kinds of tomatoes that I had been given from a friend, (cherry, beefsteak, etc.), and it was still excellent.  I agree with all of "Nicole's" suggestions, (she is the top review at this point), which do not actually "alter" the recipe... but are just words of advice.  Incredible!  I will make this every time I am overloaded with tomatoes.

Amazing! I usually don't take the time to do reviews, but this deserved it. Look forward to making these again. On a side note, I had extra tomato mixture left over and didn't want it to go to waste. I used some already cooked chicken strips (I make these when I make a chicken dish because it always a good snack or lunch), wrapped the chicken with havarti cheese, placed in a tortilla, heated, added the tomato mixture and rolled it up. Added bonus this is great over chicken. The flavor was even better after a couple days too. Thanks for sharing :)

I've never had an appetizer with this sophisticated flavor profile that my big, burly outdoorsy guy friends love so much.  (Their wives are equally amazed). I skip the last couple of steps involving re-broiling with the mozarella because I'm usually taking this to someone elses's house, which makes that completely impractical.  I just make the tomato mixture (chiffonading the basil is KEY) brush the baguette slices with olive oil and broil them under the broiler for exactly 3 minutes. Watch them the whole time or you may burn them.  Then, throw the baguette slices in a plastic bag to transport and then to put in a bowl or on a serving platter once you arrive. Take the tomato mixture in a serving bowl. People get to regulate how much bruschetta goes on their bread and the toasted baguettes are yummy for hours, regardless of temperature.  This is my favorite crowd-pleasing appetizer.  Even kids love it!

I made this for a baby shower and it was awesome! I received several compliments. I kept the tomato topping in a separate bowl in case it didn't all get used. I didn't want the bread to get soggy.

A-ma-zing! Like a previous reviewer, I simply put the bruschetta in a bowl next to the toasted bread so it wouldn't get soggy. I received many compliments on it and plan on making this again!

I've made this recipe multiple times and using fresh tomato over canned tastes a bit better but both were good to me. Fresh basil is absolutely necessary! Yumm!

This was a really great bruschetta and enjoyed by all.  I believe what made it different was the sun dried tomotoes.  Will make this again, and again for family get togethers and other parties.

This is good.  I've made this bruschetta topping on a few occasions and it's always a big hit.  Never any leftovers.  Be sure to let the topping marinade for a little while to let the flavors come together.  

I have made this without the sun-dried tomatoes as I didn't have any and it was still delicious!!

This recipe was SUPER.  My grandson said it tasted like pizza.  I loved the balsamic vinegar bite to this bruschetta.  Thanks for the recipe.  I didn't have the exact amount of sun-dried tomatoes called for, so I couldn't give it 5 stars at this time.

VERY good recipe.  I added fresh pesto to the chopped tomatoes rather than plain basil and let it all marinate for a couple of hours. I brushed the marinade liquid on the bread before toasting and used slices of fresh mozzarella on top of the tomato mixture.  Topped with a couple of leaves of fresh basil.  TASTY!!----eta: husband LOVED this

I'm not a huge bruschetta fan, but this one is excellent!  I followed the recipe as it was, but omitted the mozzarella cheese.  I made this for my boyfriend  and he said it was the best bruschetta he's ever had.

Perfect bruschetta recipe. Friends always have great things to say about it. Just has a little extra zip that makes it special. Sundried tomatoes in oil and the balsamic really do makes the difference.

very, very tomato-y; next time, aim for either the sun-dried toms in oil or the roma toms, not both.

I've used this recipe multiple times, and I love it!  It's easy to make, and guests rave over it.  Some of my guests are gluten free, so when they come over, I serve it over sliced cucumber chips and don't broil it.

Pretty good. I did use fresh mozzarella that comes sliced and that made it easier than shredded. Way too much oil (shiver). After you broil it, it comes out soggy in the middle. Maybe do cheese bread and let people put the tomato mixture on by itself. Had a good taste.

Delicious! I got great feed back. I used sliced fresh mozzarella instead of shredded. I would not use dry basil because the fresh made it taste a lot better.

Very tasty! I used crumbled goat cheese on top instead of mozzarella.  I didn't have the sun-dried tomatoes but will try it with next time. I let the tomato mixture sit for several hours before preparing.  Will definitely be making this recipe again.

Delicious!  I used pureed garlic (from a jar) rather than cloves and toasted the bruschetta ahead of time (to take to a party, assemble and broil there).

I did not change anything but I did eat some chile peppers with it and that was a tasty accent to this outstanding recipe. Oh yeah I did pan toast the bread with butter for an extra crispy snack. Good job lady!

Easy and amazing...we ate some of the tomato mix cold on baguettes before cooking the rest. The vinegar is really what gives it the perfect kick.

Awesome brushetta.  I cheated a bit and used frozen new your ciabatta rolls with cheese on top and for the tomato mixture I used classico basil pesto and left out the olive oil.  It was wonderful!!

Delicious!  I left out the sun-dried tomatoes as my husband is not a big fan; and added an extra clove of garlic to compensate :) We do like garlic!  Super good. The liquid moistens the bread and along with the cheese, holds everything together. I've had bruschetta many times, including as a standing appetizer and gone through trying to eat as everything falls off/apart. So this was great - excellent flavor, moist, and much less messy then many bruschettas I've had.

This is the very best.  We even have it for a light lunch.  I had some leftover in the fridge and no baguette in sight.  I was making meatloaf and threw it in that and it was wonderful.

I made this for a Fourth of July party since tomatoes and basil are in season.  It was awsome.  I did not add the mozzarella cheese and broil at the end.  It was the best bruschetta I have ever made and will make it again soon.

Made this for a party...too garlicky for my taste, but the other flavors were great. I did make it the night before to let the flavors blend as suggested and that may be why it was sooo garlicky. Will use less next time.

I had this saved in my recipe box for a long time and finally had the opportunity to make it. It is INCREDIBLE. I received rave reviews for all our guests and many of them left with recipe in hand. I love those moments! I used other reviewers suggestions and served this in a bowl with crisp bread (w/ the melted cheese) around the outside . That was simply a little more practical for me. So easy, so delicious!

My father-in-law is a huge bruschetta fan.  I make this for him every once in awhile.  He raves that it's the best ever.  I think it is really good.  I use the little cherry tomatoes sliced thinly and put just a pinch of sugar which I think makes all the difference in the world.

Absolutely Divine! Followed the recipe exactly. I drained the tomatoes and I made up the bruschetta mix the day before and even though the mixture was a little soggy, these disappeared from the plate! They were excellent! Would recommend highly!

I made this to put onto chicken burgers with some goat cheese.  Absolutely delicious!  Even my 3 year old ate hers up!  I will definitely make this as an appetizer in the future.  It's the only bruschetta recipe you need - restaurant quality!

my guests inhaled this and kept asking how it was made! I garnished with extra piece of basil on top and it looked super fancy. Also use the plum tomatoes as suggested b/c they have less water. I didn't do this and had a lot of liquid but it still was ok.

This is delicious, but it can get soggy if not eaten right away.  This is not a major criticism; we are talking about tomatoes on bread here!  Just be aware when you make it -- it won't last more than about 20 minutes before you get soggy bread.

These did not last long. Everyone kept coming til they were gone. Didn't use the sun dried tomatoes, so it was just a "single tomato bruschetta" but everything remained the same. It was excellent, will for sure be using this recipe again.

This was so delicious! This is also my first time making bruschetta and it was a hit in my house. It did need a little kick in the taste factor but I just doubled the salt and pepper and added some italian season which gave it a good taste and look.

These were yummy! The sundried tomatoes gave it an extra tangy-ness that I loved! I put a sliver of fresh mozarella on top and it was oh-so-good. Even heats up as leftovers pretty well. Soggier but still good.

This was good, but my husbands aunt still makes the best bruschetta ever! I've never made it before & decided to try this since I had everything on hand except the sun dried tomatoes so I left that out. It had a bit of a kick to it that I wasn't expecting. It was good but not the best one ever!
I will have to ask for his aunts recipe! Also....brushetta is not the same with shredded mozzarella......you need fresh!

This was DELICIOUS!!! I made it for a dinner party and the plate was completely empty and everyone wanted the recipe! The only thing I did different was to grate fresh parmesean cheese on top- didn't melt mozz) I broiled each side of the baguette for 2 minutes, so both sides were crispy. The balsamic is an absolute must- it makes the whole dish special. Use the sundried tomatoes, even if you don't like them, you will love it all together. I used canned tomatoes (drained THOROUGHLY) and fresh basil is a must too. Will def make again!! Thanks!

I made this for christmas for my family. They loved it. I would of gave it five stars but I couldn't find sun dried tomatoes. It just seemed like it was missing something maybe that was it. Next time I make this I will have to shop some where else.

Delicious! Super easy to make. The only differences was adding Garlic Salt to mine and 3 more garlic cloves to make it really garlicky for garlic lovers like me : )

This was excellent. I forgot to add the sun dried tomatoes. I broiled the bread first with a little olive oil brushed on as others suggested and then added the cheese and topping for the last 3 mintues of broiling. I also added minced red onion.  I used crumbled feta cheese on half of the batch and goat cheese on the other half and they both tasted wonderful. I also added a little extra garlic. I did let the tomato mixture marinate for 4 hrs. Thank you!

This is one of my FAVORITE recipes.  I use a lot of extra tomato, double the seasonings (except the oil),  and extra balsamic (to taste).  This really stretches the recipe and makes each serving a little healthier.  I also add some thinkly sliced red onion.

This was excellent the only thing I changed in this recipe was I took the sun dried tomatoes out after it all marinated for the night, I am not sure since this was my first time using sun dried tomatoes they were chewy and hard that is why I decided to take them out, otherwise I found this recipe AMAZING!

Made this for NYE...it was wonderful!! Only thing I would change is I think I would be more garlic next time, but I love garlic.   I doubled this recipe, and next time I think I will double the bread, but not the tomato mixture! I have a ton left over, and no "good" bread for it with the stores closed today!

WoW! Made this as an appetizer for a dinner party! Everyone loved them and asked me for the recipe! Very delicious! Only thing I changed was, I peeled the tomato skin off by dropping them in the boiling hot water just for about 20 sec, came off like a charm! Will make them again! Also good on pita bread. I run out of french baguette and dint want to waste whatever filling I had left, so I topped a pita round with it and then cut them in little wedges, wonderful!

Made WAY too much for an appetizer for a family of 5! I used the long baguettes from my bakery and got two and I still had extra tomato mix left. Very delicious with cheese on :)

Absolutely the BEST bruschetta recipe I've tried! I'm in love! So simple, too, just tedious cutting all the tomatoes. I've made it multiple times for my friends and family, and they just GOBBLE it up! Seriously, don't change anything. I did everything exactly as shown in the recipe. Just make sure to use FRESH BASIL. I cannot emphasize that enough! Fresh or nothing. Dried basil is a waste of space. It makes all the difference. Also, try to go to your grocery store in the morning to get the freshest bread, or get the ready-to-bake one, which is often cheaper.

I made this last night for dinner and the Husband was sooooo busy eating that all I could hear was muffled sounds of delight and "This is terrific", "It's delicious", and other similar comments as it quickly disappeared!  I followed the recipe exactly except my sun dried tomatoes were in a pouch without oil so I just added a little extra to accommodate for it. Will Definitely make again and soon!!

This recipe is delicious!!!  I made this on my anniversary and it was almost gone before I could even finish dinner!!  My only suggestion is to buy two french baguettes because I had a lot of the Bruschetta left over.  Or cut the bread shorter than it says.  But this was great I will definitely make this again!

This was a big hit! The mozzarella cheese helps hold the tomatoes together. We actually soaked the garlic in the oil and vinegar overnight and it was so yummy!

This is delicious! Was a huge hit at a house party. I'm lazy and I tossed everything in my tupperware Quick Chef, did a few turns and it was done! If you're not picky about how pretty your tomatoes are sliced, it takes literally about 5 mins to make.

This was astounding, I made it for a family get together and everybody was blown away. I've made it again two other times. I did use canned petite diced tomatoes (drained),added a little diced onion and a couple of tablespoons of Capers then melted Havarti cheese over it. It's definately a keeper.

Awesome recipe! My wife had kept mentioning how good one of her friend's bruschetta recipe was, so I thought I would give this one a try (it looked similar) to see how she liked it. We both loved it. Very simple, great fresh taste, just what a great bruschetta should bring to the table.

i made this for a No Men Allowed dinner with a few of my girl friends, and it was a HIT! super easy to make and also gives you a bit of freedom to add or take away certain ingredients to your liking. i also did not serve these with the sun-dried tomatoes on top. i used them in the mixture and let it set, but i felt going all fresh was best. i will definitely make this again.

Bruschetta is one of my favorite foods so I've been really wanting to try making it myself. This recipe is great! I've made it twice. I used fresh mozzerella balls and it was really yum. DO NOT USE DRIED BASIL. I tried it with dried and it was terrible. The fresh basil is wonderful and it MADE this recipe. Also I skipped on the vinegar...it was delicious without.

Delicious! We used dehydrator dried cherry tomatoes, roma tomatoes, and basil from our garden. I lightly brushed the bread with olive oil, put it in the oven til brown, then topped with parmesean and mozarella cheese and put back in the oven til the cheese melted. We added the bruschetta at the table. Will definitely make this again!

I used about 5 regular sized tomatoes from my garden.  I omitted the sun dried.  Other than that, I followed this recipe exact.  It was delicious!  Will be making again and again and again!

Delicious! I used a mix of tomatoes (what I had on hand from the garden) and also added parmesan cheese to the mozzarella. I eyeballed all the ingredients and it turned out fantastic.  I brushed the bread with olive oil, broiled till lightly browned...then added the cheese. I kept the tomato mixture in a large bowl so people could serve themselves.

Completely delicious!!!  Bumper crop of Romas and Cherry tomatoes were amazing.  This recipe was so tasty that I used some old frozen hot dog buns I had leftover from a summer cookout and it was still FABULOUS!!!

Turned out perfect. I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes on hand, but it didn't need them! I mixed ingredients into a large bowl (minus bread/cheese) and chilled until ready to eat. The flavors blended well and were great on toasted French bread.

If I could give this more than five stars, I would. This was absolutely delicious. I used much more garlic and I used mozzarella medallions instead of shredded, which was definitely the way to go. Also, don´t skip the step of toasting the baguette for a couple of minutes... it turns out soggy if you do.

These were very good and simple. I didn't use basil because I don't care for it, but the finished product has a very fresh taste to it. Delicious!

Be careful with the broiling, though -- mine needed only a minute or two in there to melt the cheese.  More and they would have burned.

I made this for my housewarming party last night and everybody loved it!  I used fresh mozzarella instead of shredded and it was perfect.  The balsamic vinegar really gives it a good bite and the roma tomatoes and sun-dried tomatoes tasted fantastic together.  I made the tomato topping the night before and put it all together 10 minutes before the party was to start.  Overnight really gave the tomatoes an extra tastiness.  Delicious and I will definitely be making it again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I love bruschetta! I halved the baguette lengthwise and crosswise to better hold all the goodness in the toppings. I didn't have any fresh or regular sun-dried tomatoes, but I had smoked sun-dried tomatoes so I used them. I also used fresh buffalo mozzarella and Locatelli romano cheeses. The romano has a sweet nuttiness that holds up to the vinegar well. The only thing I wish I did differently was not having white balsamic vinegar. The aged Modena balsamic vinegar was a tad strong. Oh, and I made the garlic bread in one of those microwave/convection combo ovens at 450°. Thanks for the idea of sun-dried tomatoes! I never thought of them on bruschetta.

This is a great appetizer. I didn't use Roma tomatoes because I had lots of vine ripened ones. My suggestion is if you use vine ripened tomatoes to chop and then drain them for about 30 mins. in a colander so the mixture isn't so runny.  Maybe it was just me but I felt like the sun dried tomatoes in olive oil was plenty of olive oil. So, I didn't add any more. For sure use fresh basil if possible - makes a big difference - again I didn't use but about 2 tbsp. and felt it was very flavorful. I served these as appetizers to 6 adults and they all loved them. We were off to dinner so I had quite a few left over even after almost everyone had 2 or 3. Some of the guys just wanted to stay and eat the rest and pass on dinner!!

This was amazing!  I read some of the reviews before making and I noticed a couple that said tasted too much vinegar.  I almost didn't put in the full 2 tbs but I'm glad I did!  It was amazing!  My husband doesn't even like tomatoes and he loved this!  I can't wait to make it again!

I love balsamic vinegar but these were a little on the heavy side as far as the vinegar taste.  Next time I'd use a very scant 2 tablespoons and maybe not quite as many sun-dried tomatoes.

So good!  I did not have Roma tomatoes and I wanted to use tomatoes from my garden soI sued Beefsteak tomatoes and stil delicious!  I also omitted the sun-dried, just because I did not have any in the house.

This was good, but not great. I followed to a T and it tasted like vinegar. I will def cut back on the vinegar if I make this again. Made much more than I needed so I added grilled chicken and made it into a sandwich the next day for lunch, was ok.

This is a 5 star recipe as is.  I've made it multiple times now and I am never disappointed.  I've read a number of reviews that said it caused the bread to get soggy.  I have started leaving the extra oil out and deseeding the tomatoes before chopping them.  It makes a huge difference.  I've also started using a better quality balsamic vinegar (three leaf) and it's improved the flavor.

Fantastic!  I used chopped grape tomatoes, a whole pint.  Omitted the sun-dried tomatoes as we didn't have any on hand.  Decreased the oil a little.  The balsamic really added a lot to this bruschetta.  Great idea!  Making again tonight!  Can't get enough!  Thanks for the recipe!

I halve the recipe because 6 tomatoes make a lot of bruschetta.  Easy to follow tasty recipe!  Like other reviewers, I toast the bread with the cheese and have people add however much bruschetta they want on top, otherwise, I'd probably make a mess in the oven and have soggy bread to boot.  I used tomatoes on a vine one time and it made it very watery, I would recommend sticking to the plum tomatoes.

Delish.  The only thing I would change is to butter the bread before popping it in the oven.  Even just a spritz of spray butter or a dab/mist of olive oil.  Without, the bread is too hard and crunchy.  Otherwise, the recipe is super easy and the ingredients are perfect.

This Bruschetta was amazing. I didn't use the sundried tomatoes because the jar I bought was damaged (and didn't realize it until I was already preparing this) but it still came out wonderfully. I used extra cheese and it was a huge hit!

Perhaps not the most "traditional" bruschetta recipes, but it was super delicious!  The sun dried tomatoes added something really special to the tomato mixture, and I loved the melted mozzarella on top.  I can't think of anything about this recipe I would change, and I would DEFINITELY make this again.

I planned on making this tomorrow as an appetizer, but I wanted to try it out beforehand. Big mistake because after making 4 or 5 I had to make the whole loaf of bread. My husband I devoured it and I look forward to making again tomorrow! So delicious. I used Italian seasoned diced tomatoes in a can and I also used the basil from my spice rack. I took the advice of others and brushed the bread with olive oil and baked for 5 minutes on 400, then added the tomato mixture and mozz and baked for another 5. The bread came out perfect! Enough crunch without being too hard. The best bruschetta I've ever tasted.

I LOVE this recipe and it’s so easy I can whip it up any time.  The sun dried tomatoes gives it that extra umph.  A couple times after I’ve toasted the bread, I’ve put a pesto spread on each piece.  I’ve served it at parties and gotten rave reviews.  A must try!

This was great! I made this as a dip by just toasting the bread, without the cheese. It was a hit at the party!

Delicious!  I made one mistake in not slicing the bread thin enough, but besides that delicious! I marinated the tomato mixture overnight, added oregano and skipped the sun dried tomatoes.

Are you ready to be the talk of the party-try this recipe! Goes together easy and has a zesty bite. I didn't have sun dried tomatos so I substituted 1/2 packet of splenda which did the trick! I also sprayed the baguette with olive oil broiled and then added mozzarella and broiled. I let the guests add their share of bruschetta. DELICIOUS!

WOW!! This was terrific. I used some of the oil from the sundried tomato jar in place of the olive oil, and I used about 5 or 6 cloves of roasted garlic. I put everything (except the cheese and the bread) into the food processer and pulsed a few times until it was about the consistency of spaghetti sauce. I refrigerated it overnight and served as a cold dip with fried zucchini and packaged panetini toasts as an appetizer for some guests. They raved over it! I will be making this again, ASAP- and in a much larger quantity! It'd be awesome as a pizza sauce.

This may be one of the best recipes I've ever gotten from Allrecipes. I made it at the lake for about 6 people who couldn't stop talking about how awesome it was. I mixed the sundried tomatoes, garlic, OO, vinegar, and salt and pepper and let it sit in the fridge overnight. About half-hour before serving, I added the romas and basil. Bake these on a wire-rack, if possible, so the bottom of your toasts stay nice and crispy. While I did use the mozzarella, a family friend has made it using goat cheese and said its even better. This is a huge winner and is great for summer entertaining.

I made this over the holiday weekend for my parents & in-laws.  It was a huge hit for a group that can be hard to please.  I followed the directions, and also brushed the bread with EVOO and baked for 5 minutes at 400 degrees prior to adding the toppings.  I will definitely make this again, it was wonderful.

These are soooooo yummy! I would definately next time cut the Balasmic Vinegar in half as it has just a bit too much bite and overpowers the rest of the flavors. My sister agreed. I made this with some soup and it was sooo good! Makes a lot! :o)

Same here, didn't like the balsamic vinegar.  I also want to stress the importance of toasting the bread well before adding the topping so that the middle doesn't get soggy.  I also added too much of the liquid to the bread when I put the topping on so make sure you drain the topping well.

If I could give this 10 stars I would!! My husband & I loved it!! I didn't use sundried tomatoes only because we don't like them, so I added extra Roma tomatoes. I brushed the bread with olive oil, sprinkled with garlic powder, then put a slice of mozz. cheese on bread and baked at 400 for about 5 minutes. We added the tomatoe mixture after it came out of the oven. Fabulous recipe!! Thank you!!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I didn't use the sun dried tomatoes because I don't like them, but used extra romas instead.  I will be making these again.  I might even share with hubby next time.

I made this recipe to take to our girls night out group called Mad Housewives (yes, after the wine). I like to think we all have fairly good taste in food. This recipes was a hit. It was polished off and I mean scraping the bowl clean. I got compliments from all who tried it. I increased the garlic to about 4 cloves, because I like my Bruschetta sweet and salty. I'm a fan of the pre-minced garlic. 1/2 tsp = 1 clove. This recipe is phenomenal and I will only use this in the future!

OH MY!  This turned out so very good! I could have eaten them as a meal--and probably will next time! The only change we made was use canned petite diced tomatoes because we had them on hand, but it was still wonderful.  Thanks!

I brushed olive oil on the slices of baguette before putting in the oven for the first couple of minutes then cut a garlic clove in half and rubbed it on the hot bread to melt the flavor in.  Then I topped it with the mixture but didn't have mozzerlla so I used goat cheese and took it out when it browned a little because goat cheese does not melt very well.  Fabulous recipe, fabulous flavor!

Made this for our Oscar Party and called it "Vicki Cristina Basil Tomato Bruschetta" for Vicki Cristina Barcelona. Was DELICIOUS!  I eyeballed the ingredients a bit, as I only had 4 roma tomatoes. And be forewarned: a little balsamic vinegar goes a long way, esp if it's high quality. I also added capers. Served in a bowl alongside a plate of toasted italian bread with fresh mozzarella on the side meant easier prep and less likelihood of soggy bread. Guests gobbled it up.

YYUUUMM!  i made this for a girls get together, and had no idea how awesome it would be.  i mean, how impressive can bruschetta be?  But boy was i wrong!  everyone raved about it, and it was gone in no time.  People even chose it over the food that was ordered from a famous restaurant.  I had a lot of people asking me for the recipe on this one.

FANTASTIC bruschetta recipe.  Best I have ever had.  I think the fresh basil leaves make all the difference in the world!  Organic basil leaves tasted better in this, than when I did it with regular basil leaves.  I wouldn't have thought it would have a noticeable effect, but it did.  Soaking everything together in the oil and balsamic = Ingenius!!!  100% recommended.

I really really enjoyed this.  I didn't change a thing.  Did it exactly as stated.  If I were to try and make it better, I would play with garlic salt rather than salt and garlic cloves for a stronger garlic flavor.  Loved it!

This was great and pretty easy to make for a party - I made the tomato mixture the night before and also sliced the bread the night before.  Day of the party I brushed the bread with garlic butter and toasted in 400 degree oven for about 5 minutes then added the toppings and put back in the oven for another 5 minutes (saved me from having to watch the oven the whole time under the broiler).  I used two cans of petite diced tomatos that I drained well but did use  fresh basil.

My husband and I attended a neighborhood superbowl party on Sun. One of our neighbors prepared and brought this bruschetta to the party.  It was fabulous as indicated by the empty platter.  The neighbor shared with party attendees that the recipe for the bruschetta came from "All Recipes".  I couldn't wait to add this recipe to my recipe box.  Thank you for sharing the recipe for these tasty delights.

This recipe is delicious.  However, we do not put the cheese on it and put it under the broiler.  We love the Bruschetta cold served on toasted baguette slices, etc.

We made 5 times the recipe to serve 50 people and we ran out!  Everyone raved that this was the best bruschetta they had ever tasted.  The only change we made, was to double the balsamic vinegar.

This was so good, that I didn't even get to have any.  We were having a get together and I put a plate of this out on the table.  After several compliments and groans of satisfaction, the plate was empty.  My friend, whose wife's a chef, said he needed the recipe (something he never asked before).  I'm definately doubling the recipe next time.

I used this recipe for a family Christmas Eve gathering and everyone raved about it!  Some said it was the best Bruschetta they ever had - first time I made it!  Super easy.  I subbed the 3 garlic cloves for 3 tsp minced garlic from the jar, and I also added a sprinkle more basil.  I could not find sun-dried tomatos in oil but the dry-packed ones worked fine.  Delicious!  Will definitely make again for future parties.

YUMMY!!!

I had made bruschetta before, but nothing this good. The balsamic vinegar is definitely what makes this recipe. The only thing I would suggest is being careful when broiling the bread -- it says to do it for 5 minutes, but after a minute and a half they began to burn.

I will definitely make this again!

I made this without the sun dried tomatoes, and on flatbread, and found it to be perfect. Because I cut the sun dried tomatoes, I also cut out one of the cloves of garlic. This blend of flavors for the topping is to die for!

I didn't care for the taste but I am not a big balsalmic vinegar fan. My daughter on the other hand thought it was great and ate most of it herself. I'll continue my search for a better recipe though....

I get so many compliments on this one.  I used the ingredients but compiled them different.  I dumped all the ingredients together. The difference: I cubed the cheese into tiny cubes and dumped that in as well.  I let it marinade for a few hours before serving. Toasted some bagettes. Served both side by side and have my guests spoon their bruschetta on the bagettes.  This prevents soggy bread and a fresher tasting appetizer.  Yummy!

This was really really good!! I made the tomato mixture the night before so all the flavors marinated together overnight. I baked a loaf of Coles's garlic bread and when it was almost done I took it out of the oven and topped with the tomato mixture and cheese before putting back in the oven on broil until the cheese melted. I had bruschetta once like this at a restaurant and it was so good! Only thing was though that the bread got a little soggy under the tomatoes. Maybe next time I will broil the bread for a few minutes before adding tomatoes. Still great though, everyone was surprised that I really made it myself!

This was a delicious but best of all extremely easy recipe!  I made these for a Christmas gathering of my Book Club and they were a definite hit.  I did make a few changes by way of what I had in my pantry, suggestions of other reviewers, and one accidental mistake.  I used diced tomatoes, dried basil, instead of adding olive oil to the mixture I used the extra oil from the sundried tomatoes for flavor.  I let this mixture sit in the fridge overnight as someone had suggested.  I did use fresh mozzerella which I think is important.  I also brushed the bread slices with olive oil before putting on the cheese.  Once I had everything layered, I cooked it all together about 4 min. and it was perfectly done.  I will be making these often.  Thank you!!!

Quite simply- devine!  My only suggestion would be to add about 1/4-1/2 cup finely diced red onions (personal preference.  I also lightly sprayed both sides of my bread with Olive Oil spray before toasting.  This recipe is delicious!

Excellent and super easy and quick to make. The bonus is that I was able to use the tomatoes and basil fresh from my garden.  Will make this again and again. I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion and bought the chunk of mozzarella cheese and cut into slices to lay over the top of the mixture (or you can put on the bottom for a more attractive presentation). For those that don't know... you can have your grocer put the french baguette through their slicer and this will save you the step of all that cutting.  It comes out perfectly sliced!

This is great stuff. I use a can of petite diced tomatoes and skip the dried tomatoes. It is more cost of effective and faster this way. Everyone loves it and no one has ever noticed the difference. This is one I like to take to parties. Also, the cheese is unnecessary. If you don't have it on hand, don't worry about it. Make it anyway. It amazing even without it!

I loved the balsamic vinegar in this! Instead of roma tomatoes, I used vine ripened garden tomatoes. It added a lot of fresh flavor.

A definite keeper. I'm not with letting the mixture marinate overnight though. I made it last night, tried some and it was great. When I prepared the rest today, it was more sour and the basil flavor kind of faded with the whole thing. Fast, delicious, and very grand. Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe for my Memorial Day BBQ and it was the talk of the whole party. Everyone loved it. I had three people who said they don't like tomatoes but they loved my bruschetta. The only thing I didn't do was melt the cheese on top. Instead I cubed some mozarella chesse and put it on the side for guest to add on top.  Next time I think I will try it with fresh mozarella.

YUM! I made these as an appetizer one night for supper & we didn't eat anything else. So good. I had left over capers in balsamic vinegar that I thought I'd try on a few slices & it was delicious. This recipe served with a salad would make a wonderful lunch or simple supper!

My husband and I thought this was very good. I decreased the amount of balsamic vinegar, and let the mixture sit in the fridge for a couple of hours. I like a previous reviewers suggestion of serving it in a dish with the warm toast on the side, and think I will try that when I am entertaining. Thanks for the recipe Laurie, we really enjoyed it.

Very good.  I used slices of fresh mozz on the bread and the tomato mixture on top of that.  I was surprised how the sun dried tomatoes dominated the fresh--I may use a little less of the sun dried next time and more of the fresh.  Overall very good.

This was sooo good!  I added some italian seasoning and a little more garlic and it turned out so very good. I also broiled the bread with olive oil brushed on the top of it.  Will make again soon!!!!

This recipe is excellent. Instead of using fresh basil, I used a spoon-full of blended basil pesto spread instead. Delicious.

This is a great and very clever variation of the classic original "Pizza Margherita" first introduced in the 1890's.  Proof that tomatoes, basil, olive oil, garlic and mozzarella cheese in any combination will work every time!!

I loved this, though next time I will not marinate overnight.  The tomatoes took on some of the balsamic vinegars color, and didn't looks as fresh.  Not too many people at my party tried this.  I thought it was delicious, though.

OMG, Amazing! First time ever making this dish, and it came out great. I followed the recipe and made no changes. I am definitely making this for future gatherings.

I was suprised by how good these were!  My boyfriend can't stand the taste of tomatoes if they're uncooked, so I wasn't how sure he would enjoy these, but he loved 'em! The only thing I would change about the recipe for next time is to leave out the sun-dried tomatoes.  I included them because so many reviews said they really make the dish, but I didn't think they were that good.  They made the mix a little too oily (or it just could have been my imagination after seeing them packed in that oil) and most people ended up picking them off anyway. Otherwise, though, it was a fantastic recipe that I'll definitely be making in the future!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for a party, and people gobbled it right up! The only change I'd make would be using a lot less olive oil next time... the oil in the sun-dried tomatoes probably would've been enough. Lots of flavor and definitely a keeper!

Awesome bruschetta, I will make this again and again.  I took it to a party last night and not only was the very large plate cleared, everyone wanted the recipe.  I made a few changes... I used more garlic (5 cloves) and vinegar (3T), and I made it the night before and let it sit in the refrigerator.  Probably not necessary but it worked fine and saved time the next day.  My bread was fairly dry so I didn't bothter to bake it without first by itself.  Also - I used sliced cheese instead of shredded, much easier to place on each piece.

I made this last night for a small dinner party and everyone LOVED it!  One of the guests HATES vegetables and ate a ton of this, he even asked for the recipe.  I did the whole thing in my little Cuisinart chopper so that it was not very chunky, and it made it really easy to scoop a spoonful on each piece of bread with no mess.  Doing that also cut out a lot of the time it would have taken to chop all the tomatoes.  I used slices of mozzarella instead of shredded and some of the oil from the sundried tomatoes.  I strained the sundried tomatoes and used whatever oil I got out of that and then used regular olive oil for the rest.  We made 24 slices of bread and there was leftover bruschetta, just to give you an idea of how much this makes.  Enjoy!!

really good!  Easy too apparently!  Hubby made this for our lazy Saturday night tea.  Was beaut in the hot weather.  Will make it again for sure.  Oh & we found that if you put some cheese on the bread first & then the tomato mix & then more cheese the tomato stuff won't fall off quite so easily as it sticks to the cheese.  Otherwise we were having bits fall!  Darn it - was too good to miss out on!

A very easy and excellent dish! This was the best Bruschetta I have had. Another review was correct in that the sun dried tomatoes are the key here. I don't like them in many dishes but here they are the key. Thanks!

I loved these brushettas!!! They're different from the 'usual' kind I normally prepare. The balsamic vinegar adds a kick of flavor. Definitely broil the baguette sliced before adding the toppings!
AWESOME RECIPE!!!

Good stuff.  Be careful of the broiler when heating up the bread...first batch was in for 2 minutes and went up black smoke!  Next batch we kept in for only 1 minute...must depend on the oven...just keep an eye on it :)

This was delicious! I used a pre-made pizza crust instead of a french baguette. The only problem I had was that it got soggy. Next time I am going to strain the tomatoes before I put them on. I'll also let the tomato mixture marinate in the fridge for a couple of hours.

This is an excellent bruschetta recipe.  It beats any kind I ever had hands down!  I recommend using the pre-chopped garlic that you can buy in a jar-- makes the prep so fast and easy.  I cut the bread and mixed it up a few hours before our guests arrived and threw it in the fridge.  Literally then took 5 minutes to top and cook when we were ready to eat. Everyone complimented and asked to share the recipe!

YUM!!!!! I made the burschetta part early in the day with the intention of toasting it with the bread for dinner, but I ate ALL of it throughout the day so I will have to try the complete finished product another time :>) I am generally a big sun-dried tomato fan (that's the reason I opted for this recipe in the first place), but actually found myself picking most of them out...I thought it tasted better without. The balsamic vinegar adds great taste to this recipe! Even my 15 month old ate this and was mad that he couldn't have more because his mom ate it all :>)

SOOooo YummY!!!!Imadethis for an appetizerfor veggie lasagna. Weate so much of thie, that we didn't have room for the main dish. I served the bruschetta cold, just the way I like it. added a lil extra balasmic, cause I love the flavor it gives. And I didn't have and basil, so I just used Italian Seasonings, and it was still super good. I think the sundried tomatoes, we NOT a must, the were a good adddition, but this could still be very good without them. Anyone whos having trouble finding sundried tomatoes in oil, check the international food aisle at your grocery store, usually they are in the Italian section.

Simply fantastic! However, the French bread doesn't need to broil that long to achieve perfection. Also, you must serve it either hot or cold. DO NOT SERVE AT ROOM TEMPERTATURE. If you do it will lose the highlight of flavor, the taste that makes it fantastic.

Fresh and yummy, there weren't any left! I had bought mozzarella to top the bruschettas but I changed my mind at the last minute because we already had all those cheesy appetizers. They were delicious, even without the cheese!

This is a fabulous appetizer!  I chop the tomatoes chunky and take it to parties as a salsa.  Everybody loves it. I tried using the french bread but everyone prefers to just scoop it out of the bowl with tortilla chips.  It's perfect as is.  I've never even been tempted to variate this recipe, except to omit the cheese and french bread.

Very good.  Reduced the garlic and added shallot per several other reviews.  I also didn't have the oil-packed sun dried tomatoes, just dry packed so I added the full amount of olive oil and thought it just the right amount of oil.

If you love bruschetta (and we do), you'll love this.  And it makes lots! The leftovers were great even a couple of days later.

I tasted bruschetta in a restaurant and had to make some myself. This is the recipe I chose and it was wonderful. I'll use it over and over again.

I omitted the sun-dried tomatoes, garlic and vinegar.  I mixed shredded cheese into the tomato mixture and did not heat.  I did add just a shake of cayenne pepper.  All those changes and it was still wonderful!  Great for a light lunch.

I thought this was outstanding and all of my guests really liked it as well and made comments about how good it was. I'm not even a big fan of tomatoes but I really liked this. Used dried basil because I couldn't find fresh at the store and it was still fine.

This was soooo good!  I varied the recipe to our tastes as I didn't use the sundried tomatoes.  We also like the mozarella cheese on the bottom of the bread and not melted.  Fresh mozarella or shredded both work great.  My husband couldn't get enough of this.  It's on the menu every week!

I made these tonight for my teenage kids and their friends. My daughter took credit for making them and got a marriage proposal. LOL! The only thing I changed was not adding sun dried tomatoes.

I made this for a party of thirty-five, doubled the recipe and there were none left within two hours! By toasting the bread via broiler first, it doesn't get soggy or stale as quickly. The sun dried tomatoes give it a definate kick. Easy and great taste!

I definitely suggest letting it marinate overnight if you have the time. It allows the vinegr and herbs to really blend together. I also usually add half an onion to the mix.  I make this every year for New Year's and it's a huge hit!!

I have made a LOT of recipes on this site that deserve 5 stars.  THIS recipe deserves 10 stars.  I have made this at least 4 times for different parties and events.  Without fail, it ALWAYS gets rave reviews.  The last time I made it, my tomato-hating sister yelled out, "Look, you have me eating tomatoes!"  I replied, "I have you eating two different TYPES of tomatoes.  That's just unheard of!"  This is such a great recipe; it is always a given that I will make it for any party I host or attend.  (I always double the garlic).

My husband never wants me to make this for company...because then he has to share.  I put the bread in the broiler to toast then I spread a garlic/herb cheese, top with the tomato mixture the broil again.  I would also suggest using the full amount of balsamic vinegar and garlic.  It's wonderful.

I really liked the fresh tomatoes (from my garden) and basil in this bruschetta, but I would have to tweak it a little next time to suit us.  I think the vinegar overwhelmed the taste of the tomatoes quite a bit, and the bread was soggy from the mixture.  I would decrease the amount of vinegar, and cut the pieces of bread a little thicker and toast both sides.  I think I may keep searching for the perfect recipe...my favorite bruschetta is made by UNO's restauraunts, based out of Chigaco.  MMMMM!!!  Actually, I think it is called Tuscany bread...

This was good.  I was making several appetizers at once, and accidentally used fresh mint instead of basil.  When I realized, I added basil as well.  Friends actually enjoyed the mint in it.

This is the best bruschette I've had/made. I didn't change a thing and the flavor was outstanding. It's a good thing I tried one when I took them out of the over because there wasn't a single one left after my company came!

I loved this recipe!  I served it at a dinner party as the appetizer.  I made a huge batch all at once, but would recommend making smaller portions as needed.  By time the guests made their way to the last pieces, the bread was a little soggy.  The next day, I added the leftover tomato topping to a can of tomato soup.  Wow that was good!

everyone in my food co-op really loved these.  i gave them a four because i thought the sun dried tomato in oil was a bit much.  i'd use less next time or avoid it completely.

Delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly other than I broiled the cheese on the bread before adding the tomatoes vs. after.  In the future,I may fancy-up the bread a little (broil both sides, brush with evoo/garlic) but it was so good as written.  If you don't already use parchment paper, run out and buy some.  It will improve your life (cleanup) tremendously, including while broiling this recipe.

I don't entertain very often but when relatives came to town due to a family crisis I knew we needed to bond over food. I went to allrecipes.com and found this recipe.  I followed the recipe as written and was tempted to skip the sun-dried tomatoes. Glad I didn't. They gave a wonderful depth to the recipe.  It was easy to pull together and my family raved about it. This and the Guac. recipe by Bob Cody are my two reliable and favorite appetizers on this site.

I love this bruschetta recipe so much! And so does everyone I've made it for. The sun-dried tomatoes are the perfect touch. I double the garlic though just since I love garlic, and I use mozzarella slices instead of shredded mozzarella because it stays on top easier and creates a little melty blanket to hold the tomato mixture in place. I try to let the tomato mixture marinate overnight too. Definitely use fresh basil and sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil (rather than dried). Besides cooking it in broiler, it's also great to use the baguette slices and tomato mix in a chips & dip way - it's just as delicious when cold. I've also made it the regular way in the oven, but without the cheese for my boyfriend who is allergic, and he loves it! This recipe is a definite hit.

The bruschetta itself was not as fresh or "crisp" as other versions. After melting fresh mozzarella on top, it was very nice but I guess this just wasn't for me.

Excellent as written, customize as you desire.
I upped garlic, added some jalepeno because i had some, and a bit of green pepper. Great.

Great recipe! It's been a big hit with the family. It's super easy to make, but packed full of flavor and nutrients. I substituted the fresh basil with dried with no problems.

Hi guys!
Very nice recipee, i prefer the original version without cheese but i like the twist of adding dried tomatoes. i used to eat this dish a lot with my family as a kid during summer, when the tomatoes are just picked from the plant..
always brings back good memories!

I've modified this based on other reviews & it's delicious & disappears before my eyes. I use the canned petite tomatoes (drained) unless the Roma are home grown. Fresh basil is a must. I bake a fresh loaf of bread, slice it & brush with olive oil. Bake it for about 5 minutes at 450. Okay, now here is the weird part. I buy chive & onion cream cheese & spread it on the bread & top with the Tomato mixture. You can even use crackers if you're in a pinch or run out of bread.

Can't rate this for the cheese part, but the bruschetta topping itself can't be beat. I like to spread the crostini with goat cheese, then the tomato topping.

Luscious and flavorful. Was too busy preparing dinner to bother with the step of topping with cheese and broiling again after initially toasting both sides of the bread I'd brushed with olive oil, so I simply mixed small pieces of fresh mozzarella into the tomato mixture. I put it into a bowl and arranged the bread on a plate around it so we could spoon it on ourselves. It was still really, really good, if not entirely traditional or to the exact recipe (sorry!).
Just two of us, so we had leftovers. Also didn't add the sun-dried tomatoes because I don't care for them but even if I did, I'd probably skip them simply because of the price. But it was still delicious anyway. Will definitely make again! Thank you.

I have made this recipe many times and the only suggestion I have is to double it and make it a day a head if possible to really bring out the flavors. I also like to use smoked provolone cheese for something a little different. This is also wonderful on grilled chicken or mixed in with some angel hair pasta. I also seed the tomatoes before I chop them and let the liquid drain off.

I made this for an open house for 50 people, and it was a huge hit.  I personally thought it was the best thing on the buffet table.  I would make 1 change when I make it again (and I will make it again) and use ciabatta bread for the sake of having a  larger surface on which to put the tomato mixture.  Even though I sliced the baguettes diagonally, it was hard to spoon the topping and cheese on the toasts without spilling a lot on the baking sheet.

Truly loved this and it was such a big hit at a party I attended. The only differences I made were definitely adding more seasoning and changed up the topping. So I added more salt and pepper and I added oregano, garlic salt and about a 1/4 of a teaspoon of granulated sugar to bring out the flavor. I refrigerated it tomato base for about two hours, then topped it with the 4 Italian cheese blend that contains mozzarella, asiago, mild cheddar and smoked provolone. It was out of this world and a crowd pleaser! Try it

Thank you so much to the comments on this recipe, because of all of you I have been able to perfect this for my family.  Oh we are loving it with these small changes.
Cut 3-4 Roma's long way, do away with the seeds and any moisture with a spoon.  After all is in the bowl (omit the sun-dried tomatoes and add lots of some fresh thyme to recipe) we only use a couple drips of EVOO and between 1/2 to 1 tsp. balsamic vinegar, add a couple drops of white vinegar (the secret of summer recipes), some S&P and taste, taste, taste.  Let sit in fridge to meld... like 2hrs if you can wait, overnight is perrrrfect.  The salt and vinegar will bring a bit of moisture outta the tomatoes.  Toast bread one side, pull it out and rub with the cut side of 1/2 bulb of garlic, it'll surprise you how it rubs on like melted butter and OMG the smell YUM.  Flip bread and repeat with toasting and rubbing.  Then we cheese the bread with shredded mozz cheese (readily available in my fridge) and broil 1 more time to melt it. Add Cold toppings with a straining spoon as we stand around using hands as plates and rave about how awesome it is!  I plan in the future to try a cheese like feta for even more bite and possibly the (jarred moistened) sun-dried tomatoes.  This is our savior for summer heaven. Also our broiler has a low setting which after making this 4 times in the last 6 days I have found is really handy.  Man that broil high setting cooks FAST.  THANK YOU ALL so VERY VERY much!!!

Absolutely amazing! I added Classico pesto which added a great flavor cause I didn't have sundries tomato. But that's my opinion anyways....

This is pretty much the best thing I have ever tasted. The longer the tomato mixture sits, the better. It's awesome as is, or on pasta, or eaten straight from the bowl with a spoon. This is the only bruschetta recipe I will need.

This was great.  I really think the sun-dried tomatoes really make this recipe.

This is great.  The only change we make is to skip the sundried tomatoes and add a little extra balsamic vinegar.

Be careful when broiling the dry bread!  It gets crispy in seconds.  Two minutes in our oven would leave cinders.

I brushed my baguette slices with the oil from the sundried tomatoes, added a little parmesan and mixed in a little tomato basil feta instead of mozarella. Best thing I have ever eaten.

I usually replace the balsamic vinegar with the dressing. It is sooo good. I've been making this over and over again. Do not over do the garlic though, it tends to overpower the rest of the flavors. Thanks for the recipe.

My favorite appetizer! Very easy to put together and delectable! I didn't add any salt since the recipe calls for sun dried tomatoes which were pretty salty already. I also used artisan bread with garlic cloves which was a great improvement. Everyone loved it!

Great appetizer.  The sun dried tomatoes and fresh basil give it a natural taste.  While the balsamic vinegar adds a little bit of tartness to it.

I love this bruschetta recipe!  Much better than what you get in most restaurants.  I follow exactly as written and everyone loves it.  Today I made it for a birthday dinner I am doing for my friend (steak and lobster tails).  I added chopped marinated artichokes this time which my favourite little greek restaurant does and it put it right over the top.  I didn't think it could get better. I'm glad there are only going to be two of us so we will get lots!!!!

I used dried basil instead of fresh. I also added a quarter of diced sweet onion and fresh parsley. The bruschetta tasted just like what I buy at restaurants! DELICIOUS!

I didn't have any sun dried tomatoes but it really didn't need it.  However, I did add some diced sweet onion and it was wonderful! Those are the only changes I made.  Next time I might even add some diced black olives.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is perfection!!!! I always skip the salt & pepper, you dont need it. I really like havarti melted on the baguette slices, then top with the bruschetta.... so good!!! And that way prevents the bread from becoming soggy.

These were a hit at the party. My only advice/adjustment is to not broil the bread as it burns too easily, instead just set the oven at 500 degrees. Also, I added prosciutto on the side and my guest loved it. It is pretty simple to make and you can be made ahead of time/the night before to let the flavors blend in.

Being a huge lover of sun dried tomatoes and bruschetta with fesh herbs I really loved this recipe I made this exactly as the recipe states and the only thing I would change for next time would be cutting down the olive oil, otherwise perfect!

Another delicious recipe to make for friends.  This would have turned out perfect if I had not burnt the bread which is because I had never used a broiler before. People still loved it though.  :)

This recipe was a huge hit at the party.  I tested it using some of the modifications in the reviews.  I preferred the version that called for baking the baguette slices after spraying with olive oil.  I used firm farmer's market tomatoes rather than store-bought roma tomatoes. I also combined grated parmesan with the grated mozzarella.  I will also decrease the amount of mozzarella next time because I had too much using the amount listed.

I just made these for a house party. They were great! I didn't use sun dried tomatoes. I doubled the amount of basil and minced it as much as possible. Added Parmesan cheese.

This is a great recipe. I love the mix of fresh and dried tomatoes. Of course, you have to season it according to your own taste. I come from a South Asian family that is used to the bold flavors of Indian food, so I doubled the basil, tripled the black pepper and tripled the garlic. I also tossed in some grated Parmesan. It got rave reviews.

This was absolutely fabulous.  I used a homemade french loaf, tomatoes and basil from my guarden and organic mozzerella.  I didn't have any sun-dried tomatoes on hand but I really didn't feel as though it was missing anything.  I will make this recipe again and again and again.  Yum!

I did not add the sun-dried tomatoes but even without them it was delicious. The family raved about it and asked to have this added to the list of things to make again.

Very nice. The sun dried tomatoes add a really nice flavor profile. I brushed the bread slices with butter first and toasted them in the oven. After they were crunchy, I added the topping.

This was a huge hit with my family. I made the bruschetta in the morning and left in a bowl to the side. I toasted the baguette in the broiler brushed lightly with melted butter and placed them all on a cookie sheet earlier in the morning as well. Then once my family came I put the tomatoe mixture on the bread topped with mozzarella and broiled for 2 minutes. It was unbeleivably easy and delicious!!!!

Very yummy recipe! I added a pinch or two of bruschetta spice mix from Epicure, and with held the cheese. Still lots of flavor, with less fat.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! I made this the other weekend as an appetizer for a small dinner party, and every piece that I put out was VERY quickly eaten. I think I promised the recipe to everyone that was there, it was such a hit! The leftover were just fine the next day, and were tasty cold as well as hot. MODIFICATIONS: I did as other suggested, and baked the baguette and mix in the oven rather than broiling it.

This recipe was delish!  I didn't have enough romas in the house so I used the 3 I had and also used canned diced tomatoes.  The fresh basil definitely makes it, along with the kick from the balsamic vinegar.  Served it a group of friends and everyone went back for seconds.

I made this for the first time ever the other day when I had some fresh tomatoes from a local garden.  The company who ate the bruschetta that I had prepared commented that "it was the best bruschetta they had ever tasted and they had tasted a lot of different versions."  Thank you for such an easy and delicious recipe - especially since - I am not a good cook.

Amazing way to use up summer tomatoes!  I despise balsamic vinegar with a passion, so I used a sweet, spiced vinegar dressing (Hendrickson's, it may be a local thing) with closer to a tablespoon of pepper and it turned out wonderful.  It works alright on regular toast, as I like softer bread and smaller bites anyway...  Fantastic recipe, perfect for anyone who loves tomatoes.  Super easy to adjust to taste.

Delicious!  Just the right blend of ingredients.  I decided to use it as a dip/spread instead of broiling it, and mixed about 1 cup of shredded cheese into the mix instead of melting it on top.  It was a big hit with my guests and husband, and I think I will even extend the recipe to use as a sauce with pasta next time.

Very good!  I'd rub the garlic onto toasted bread because it's got too much bite.  Would also ditch the sun-dried tomatoes since our family doesn't like them.

This was great. 1st batch got gobbled down and had to run to the store for more tomatoes, bread and cheese to make a 2nd batch or there would have been a riot?
Modifications I made - my sun-dried tomatoes on hand were dry so I marinated in Zesty Italian dressing for about 1/2 1st. Used fresch Cuban bread instead of French. Added chopped jalpeno peppers for extra zing.

My daughter is a very picky eater and decided (only for a few days) that she wanted to cut meat out of her diet. I found this recipe, leaving out the sun-dried tomatoes, she absolutley loved them! Now that meat is back in her diet, she still asks for them.

This was absolutely amazing and received rave reviews from my whole family!  I didn't have any sun-dried tomatoes so I used a few more home grown garden tomatoes.  This will definitely become the Sunday dinner appetizer!

So good. I didnt use sun-dried at all only cuz i didnt have them so i just added an extra tomato. I found little grape tomatos work even better being less juice. You REALLY have to use plum tomatos tho for this(or the grape) or its way way to liquidy. I kept everything else the same. I didnt put it on bagguettes. I served as a dip with plan n sea salt bagle chips.It was gone fast

Fantastic flavor and so easy!  Instead of broiling the bread first (since I prefer my bread a little softer), I brush a little olive oil & balsamic and sprinkle Romano cheese on it before stacking the tomato deliciousness.  Broil together & the edges of the bread will be crispy but not like a crouton.

This was great!  I didn't add the cheese and I didn't put it on the bread...I instead ate it as a dip with spicy crackers!  Yummy!!

Fantastic!  Everyone LOVED it!  I admit, I did make two changes.  First I cut the olive oil to 1/8 cup, and instead of mozzarella cheese, I served it with thin (very thin) pieces of shaved parmesan on top.
Perfect!  Certainly a keeper!!!

Amazing bruschetta!  The best one I have ever had.  Very easy to make and so so tasty!  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for, only I did not have any fresh basil.  That of course, would have only made it better!

Absolutely the best bruschetta I have ever eaten.  Served for a football party and everyone loved it.  One man even was eating it with a spoon! I used the basil that comes in a tube and it worked out great!  I also served with toasted bagette brushed with olive oil.  Delicious, thanks for sharing!

Wonderful Recipe!  This was a hit at our Halloween party.  I took the advice of others and brushed bread with Olive Oil, then broiled for about 2 min, before adding the tomato mixture.  This kept bread from getting too soggy while sitting out at a party.  I also used cans of petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh as a time saver... the recipe still turned out delicious!  Will make this one again very soon!!

Everyone raved about this! I was worried there would be too much liquid with the balsamic, oil and natural oils from the tomatoes, but it turned out well. I didn't boil at the end because I had baked the baguette and didn't want it to burn, but the mozarella still worked quite well.

great dish... nice use of leftover french bread. i sliced the bread early and let it sit out and get crunchy before i baked the bruschetta which worked out really well. i also added a little extra vinegar. the garlic was pretty powerful if you used fresh minced garlic. i also agree with everyone else that the fresh basil was worth it. . . so were the sundried tomatoes... it's an overall great dish! rave reviews! :)

FANTASTIC!!!  I didn't have any sundried, but I did have an abundance of home grown tomatoes.  I tried a few with cheese on top and a few with cheese on the bottom.  I do believe that cheese on bottom helped keep the bread from sogging and also ensured cooking through my extra garlic (I couldn't help myself!)

My sisters made these.  They were okay.  They are a good appetizer to have if you are having a party.  Maybe, I might make these again, but I personally don't think the preparation is worth it.  They are good for a party because the recipes makes alot and they are filling.

This recipe is awesome!! It makes enough for a small dinner party and tastes fabulous. I pretty  much followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I will change next time is to use a whole wheat baguette for a healthier version. Also keeps really well the next day for leftovers.

Made this for the first time and it was super easy, quick, and SOOOOO DELICIOUS!! Many requested I make it again. Looks professionally done and, being a beginner, I really impressed not only my dinner guests, but myself. I adjusted the ingredients though and left out the cheese as I found the dish flavorful even without it. Will definitely be making this again (maybe tomorrow night!!)

This is the best bruschetta recipe I've ever tried. It's better than anything I've had in a restaurant, and I am not a fan of raw tomatoes. I followed the recipe exactly, but did not need the full amount of tomatoes.

This was...how can I say this...DELICIOUS! I've never had bruschetta before and after this recipe, I can't imagine life without it! I did not have sun dried tomatoes, but I did have fresh from the garden ones and it was exceptional! Next time, I will purchase some sun dried, just to see if I'm missing anything. The balsamic vinegar changes your life. I don't care if you can't stand vinegar DON'T SKIP OUT ON THIS RECIPE! The garlic adds a nice bit to it. I used shredded cheese this time, but I do see how the sliced cheese could make prep easier, and you can get some nice cheesy blanket action going on. Thanks Laurie! This was a life changing recipe for me!

This is my husband’s favorite appetizer!  They are a huge hit at parties and are a great way to use up some extra tomatoes!  I use whatever tomatoes I have on hand and just drain the extra juice.  I have tried a two leaf as well as a three leaf balsamic vinegar and I like the two leaf better.

This recipe is simple to execute & is absolutely amazing! I didn't have fresh basil in hand so I used dried basil and added oregano into the mixture. I added 2 more cloves of garlic than the recipe called for. I also used the oil that was packed with the sun-dried tomatoes as well.

Absolutely delicious! But be warned, if you are not a huge garlic fan this recipe might be a little to spicy for you. I thought it was perfect! I also chopped balls of marinated mozzarella and added to the mixture, instead of adding shredded mozzarella at the very end.

I must say, this is a great recipe. Tomatoes are the stars in flavor.  Good balance of tart and sweetness of fresh plum tomato. If you want to add hearty experience add some fresh avocado, I promise you it goes together like carrots and peas.  1 avocado for every 3 tomatoes. Some folks claim not to put sun dried tomatoes which is a mistake, they play a crucial role. Although this is a really good recipe i gave it 4 stars for not to blow me away, so I reserve that for something special.

Tried this for a party, VERY easy and delicious!  Well actually, I never got to try any, I served them, and they were eaten so fast that they were coming into the kitchen looking for more!

Very, very good flavor. It got rave reviews from our guests. I toasted both sides of the bread to keep the tomato side from getting too soggy and added a bit more minced garlic.

First time making Bruschetta.  The whole family loved it.  I made only a half recipe, but ended up using a whole baguette (10 oz. LaBrea).  Next time I will probably try to use sliced mozzarella instead of shredded.  Can't wait to make this again and again.

Mmmmm.  Yummy.  I left out the sun-dried tomatoes and brush EVOO and garlic on the baguette before broiling.  Everyone loved it.

I will start off by saying I love bruschetta; I make it regularly at home, and order it regularly at restaurants.  I did enjoy this recipe, however I still prefer the classic bruschetta to this one.  This one is a little sweeter for my taste.  I am glad I tried it, and my sister liked it a lot, but I most likely will not make it over a more traditional recipe.  Personal preference.

Scrumptious!  I did not cook them long enough in the broiler, so they were a bit soggy.  Regardless though, my dad would NOT stop complimenting me.  Just be sure to broil them until slightly brown to prevent what happened to me.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! I found this recipe as an "attempt" of finding a Bruschetta that I would like and that is exactly what I did! Not only do I like it, my husband and 5 year old think it is amazing as well. When we make a "batch" we double the recipe and use the left-over bruschetta to eat on numerous things during the following days. We simply can not get enough of this wonderful treat!

This is excellent!  I served it along side Hot Onion Dip and a nice red wine.  The bread is crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I mixed in a little parmesan cheese too.  I will absolutely make this again!

Definitely cut the oil in half, there was too much. But other than that, it's a great and easy recipe! I used English Toasting Bread and cut the bake time by one minute. Still good!

You must chill this overnight, I know it doesn't say to but it's the best.  Everyone raved about this one!  I made this for a girls happy hour party I had.  They all loved it.  I did make changes I used an 1/8 cup of olive oil and an 1/8 cup of the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes.  I also added parmesan cheese to the mix, because it should be there.  Then chilled it over night to congeal all the flavors, and presto instant hit!

I made this recipe with my sister when she came into town. It was WONDERFUL. I had dry sun-dried tomatoes and we rehydrated them and it tasted great. I wish we had fresh basil, but we were on a budget and used dried...1tsp dried for every tbs fresh. It still tasted great. We also used fresh mozzarella and it was out of this world! We will definitely be making these again.

Fantastico!  I served these at a cocktail party with a bunch of Italian friends and they loved them.  Love the addition of sun-dried tomatoes.  You definitely have to use fresh basil--I added fresh oregano too.  Like other people mentioned, I lightly toasted the baguette slices before topping with the bruschetta and I put a thick slice of mozarella over each rather than shredded--way easier and not as messy.  Use more garlic

Quick and easy recipe for some amazing bruschetta. Italy is one of my favorite places to travel and this recipe reminded me of it. My boyfriend said this would work as a pizza and that he could eat the tomatoe topping just by itself.   Great and easy. Thank you!

I just made this for a Valentine's Day party I had where all of the food was red. It was delicious! Everyone loved the balsamic vinegar and I thought it had just right amount of flavor. I didn't have the tomatoes called for in the recipe so I used a can of diced tomatoes and it worked perfectly. Will definitely make again!

Delicious!  I made the following modifications: - Used 5 garlic cloves instead of 3 - Cubed fresh mozzarella and stirred it into the mix instead of topping with the shredded mozzarella.  It was quickly eaten and I would definitely make it again!

Made this recipe and it was great! I followed the advice of others and sprinkled a bit of cheese on the bread before putting on the tomato mixture and then sprinkled some more cheese on top.  I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried basil and it was delicious.  Will try with fresh basil next time, as I'm sure it will be even better. Thanks, Laurie!

Omg, I just saw I had not rated this and feel really bad as I have been using this recipe for all of our get togethers for quite a while now. Everyone loves this when I make it. I don't use the sundried tomatoes, just use Roma but other than that I make as the recipe suggests.

Second time I've made these in 3 days! They are sooooo delicious! I didn't even have sun-dried tomatoes, but they were still really incredible! I did add feta cheese to them though. I broiled them on both sides for a minute or so, so that the juices do not run through the bread and make them soggy like they did the first time. INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS!!!  I crave them all the time now!  One added note- make sure to use FRESH basil, it is truly the reason why these are so wonderful!

Not much to say here that hasn't already been said. This really is incredibly delicious bruschetta. I like to use it to make a pizza (the full recipe would make about 2 standard size pizzas). I think the sundried tomatoes are the secret!

This was soooooo good.... I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes and just used dried. I also couldn't find good Roma tomatoes so I used grape. GREAT recipes even the kids loved it!

Wow! This is the best bruschetta I have ever had. I can't wait to make it again! (To make it gluten free, I made gluten free french bread, which does make this more time-consuming). Hints: I removed the seeds and the inside liquid of the tomatoes. I added extra garlic, and I mixed mozzarella and parmesan cheese. I also let the tomato mixture marianade for several hours. I can't wait to make this again!

One of the best bruschetta I've eaten.  The two types of tomatos and the balsamic adds depth that is missing from other recipes. Will make over & over again.

Fantastic and EASY! I made the tomato mixture and marinated it over night and it was very worth the wait! I just added extra diced garlic cloves because my family and I are garlic-lovers. I will be making this again in the near future.

Delicious, simple and oh so quick! I toast the bread slices in the toaster before loading them up. Also, I omit the olive oil. I also use parmesan cheese instead of mozzerella sometimes. The sun-dried tomatoes can be omitted if you don't have any. Sometimes I put basil pesto on the toasted bread as a base before adding the tomatoes (marinaded in some balsamic vinegar), basil leaves, pine nuts and cheese.

Great flavor combinations and super easy to prepare.  My guests loved this app.  I think you could easily go without the cheese as well - the tomato mix carries the dish well.

This recipe is amazingly delicious!  After using sun dried tomatoes packed in oil, I found no need for additional olive oil.  Adding the fresh basil is a must and definitely kicks the flavor up a notch.  I recommend using fresh mozzarella and melting a slice on the bread and adding the mixture on top.  I brought this as an appetizer to a friend's birthday and there was not a single tomato slice left over.

Loved this recipe!  I did make it a little easier and spiced it up a bit.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies (drained) in substitution for the 6 romas.  It was easier than cutting up the tomatoes and added a little heat to the bruschetta.   I plan to add a small can of olives next time for another twist!

Just made this a few minutes ago...I didn't have half the ingredients, and it turned out just fine! I have to use some powders for the garlic and onion, and didn't have any vinegar at all! I had already decided that I would just put the tomatoes over my slices of cheese and eat it cold, but I totally forgot about the cheese last minute and had to layer some over my tomatoes, then stick it in the microwave for 30 seconds! It was a mess, but tasted fine!   (Oh, and I decided to make this last minute and didn't have time to get groceries...I just put everything over some whole grain toast! xD not as good as a baguette, but certainly not bad either!)

So good! If you are a fan of Olive Garden's Bruschetta, I believe this would be very close to (or even better than), if you add just a couple tablespoons of grated Parmesan to the mixture and skip the cheese on top.

I served this at a party and everyone loved it, however you really have to love the taste of sun dried tomatoes.

OMG, this is good.  I never thought to use sun-dried tomatoes for buschetta, but man it's awesome.  Rave reviews and I'll definitely make it again.

AMAZING!!! If you want the best burschetta, MAKE THIS! Don't skip the sundried tomatoes if you can help it, they give a great texture to this dish. I made these and another rattatouille type bruschetta for a dinner party and everyone liked them both but wanted this recipe not the other one.

I love this recipe. However, I don't like the sun-dried tomatoes and I think in this case the cheese actually takes away from the other flavors. Fresh basil is much better.

People ask me to make this all the time - its funny, because it is SO simple to make.  Definitely use petite diced tomatoes, and small-cut sun-dried tomatoes if you can find them.

I added a bit of diced red onion (about 1/4 cup)  It was awesome.  I did not have fresh basil, my grocery store had no fresh basil (can you believe that?!) so went for dried.  Still a great brushetta and I got rave reviews on it at work.  Did not add cheese but served over garlic crackers and also over garlic cheese bread.  I am sure it is even better with fresh basil.

Delicious!  I made this exactly as is, except instead of melting mozarella over the top I spread honey goat cheese over the toasted bread and then topped with brushetta.  its the perfect blend of sweet and savory, YUM!  My husband ate a whole loaf of bread!

I have to say that this bruschetta was the best I ever had! It was a huge sensation at my dad's birthday party. It was gone within ten minutes of being put out. Love this recipe and can't wait to make it again! Def. 5 stars!

Yummy!  I didn't have a bagette so I used italian bread.  I should have toasted both sides prior to adding tomatoes.  I'll know next time how to make it better.  It was still really good.

This was really great. My parents loved it. I had to double the topping and halve the cheese (I had too little of the former and too much of the latter) but it was superb. I think my baguette was just too big. Thank you!

Really good.  I didn't use the sun dried tomatoes and used parmigiano reggiano instead of mozzarella and was still great.  Doubled the recipe and ate for a vegetarian dinner.

Used about a tablespoon of the olive oil from the sundried tomatoes.  Grated some fresh Parmesan.  Was for a party so I served it cold alongside toasted bread brushed with olive oil.  I was surprised how good it was - thought the garlic was a little much when I first tasted it, but once I put it on the toasted bread it was perfect.  The balsamic vinegar gives a delightful sweetness.  I enjoyed it very much!

Okay, I have to admit, this was a delicious Bruschetta! I made it for my dad and step-mom, and they both LOVED it... personally, I thought it was delicious also, but I felt the sun dried tomatoes were sort of out of place. I cut them into small, diced pieces, and when you bite into the Brushetta, they made it chewy, and taste almost like there was raisins in it. This recipe was delicious, don't get me wrong, but next time I make it, I will leave out the sun dried tomatoes.

I made this on a day that I had 8 kids at my house ages 4 through 11 and they all ate it and loved it - what are the chances? It was very good. We made it with fresh basil and next time, I'll probably experiment with reducing a oil.

Fantastic!  Since we do not have a lot of money this was our breakfast, lunch, and dinner!  We will definitely have this again when we have a bit of spending money.

Amazing! Made this for appetizer night after a day of wine tasting. If I had a little less wine maybe I wouldn't have burnt them, but they still turned out great. Fresh basil is key

Perfect bruschetta! I didn't have sundried tomatoes, so I just used all fresh, and this was still delicious. I would like to try it with the sundried too next time though. Balsamic vinegar is the key, I can't believe how many recipes on this site for bruschetta didn't include it! I won't be trying any other recipes though, this is perfect!

Fantastic!  I will never use another bruschetta recipe.  I had people asking for more after it was gone at my last gathering.  I guess 2 loaves just wasn't enough to satisfy the hungry masses.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this yesterday for Easter.  Was a huge success.  I followed the recipie exactly only added more fresh ground pepper, cuz that is just the way I am.  Can't wait to have the leftover topping (because I ran out of bread) today on some pasta!

We had this for a light dinner, alongside a tossed salad. I liked this, but felt like it was missing something. I did use about half the cheese that it called for and added a little bit of parmesan to the mozzerella. I felt like it needed a lot more basil, and I like the idea of brushing the bread with olive oil first. We love garlic, so I might also double the amount. I only used four tomatoes which was plenty, and I wasn't able to find sun dried tomatoes in oil, so I used dried ones. I do think we'll keep this recipe, but I will definitely be tweaking it. I could barely taste the cheese, so I think I might omit it. No need to add calories if you can't taste it anyway!

This is a great recipe! I found the sun dried tomatoes in oil comes in a jar in the pasta aisle. I personally think the sun dried tomatoes is absolutely delicious and important to perfecting this recipe.

This is a standard in my house.  It's easy and always tastes great.  I've also put leftovers that needed to be finished off ASAP in a pan with some extra chopped fresh tomatoes, a little extra balsamic and some extra fresh basil leaves to make a sauce.

Delicous! Simple and elegant, perfect for a gathering where there's not a lot of time to be in the kitchen. We sprinkled the mozarella directly on the bread to melt it a little, then stuck the tomato mixture on top so you get that nice warm gooey with cold crunchy (that's a technical term). Thanks a bunch!

I made this last night for my cousines..they loved it.  I made it early in the morning at 8am and served it around 7pm...gives it time to marinate!  Perfect!!  I didn't top it with cheese nor did i put it back in the oven once i topped it with the marinated topping.

Wonderful!!  Easy!!  The only substitute I made was pizza cheese instead of straight mozarella & I sliced the romas making a pretty presentation.  Filling will make 2 loaves if you add a little more sun dried tomatoes.

This was delicious, and I ended up making it on two seperate occasions! It's basically mix, pile, and broil - it's so easy. I will be using this as an appetizer in the future when having guests over! It does make a LOT, however, so I would go with half the recipe when feeding a small crowd or the full recipe when feeding over 6 people.

Ever since I brought this to a family party I am always asked to bring it to every family get-together! Instead of doing all that chopping I just use 2 large cans of petite diced tomatoes, minus the juice. It's just a lot easier! I am also a huge fan of balsamic & garlic so I always add a bit more. I strongly urge you to use FRESH basil, it's what really makes this dish standout.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I made this with canned diced tomatoes as someone suggested and it was just okay.  Even lots of garlic and herbs didn't improve the flavor.  Next time will try with fresh tomatoes.

Talk about yummy! It makes a lot of bruchetta! I prefer to make these with frozen texas toast, I toast the bread for 5 min, then top it with the mixture, then the cheese and bake it on a lower temp until the cheese is all melty and yummy! Put it under the broiler if you prefer browned cheese.

This was exceptional!  We had a party and made maybe twenty recipes, mostly appetizers, and this was the hit of the evening.  It also, in my opinion, was the healthiest appetizer there.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

These were great! I served them at a party last night and they were gone before I could make another batch. Everyone raved and asked for the recipe!  I would definitely make these again!

Great recipe. I was really happy about the way this recipe turned out. It tasted so "professional", and everyone loved it. Pop these in the oven right before serving so that the bread doesn't harden too quickly. There are really no suggestions for the recipe itself b/c it tastes just right.

You will not want to miss the joy of these amazing appetizers---among the best I've ever tasted! The combo of sun-dried and fresh tomatoes plus all that yummy basil---what can I say? It just about ruined Thanksgiving dinner because we ate so many! Only suggestions: Make sure the bread is sliced to the stated thickness so the filling doesn't seep through. I made the mistake of cutting the bread too thin at first. Second, watch the pan like a hawk while toasting the bread and during broiling. They can burn in a snap!

These were so easy and sooo good! I used parmesan cheese, instead of mozarella and they rocked. Next time I will use more fresh tomatoes, and less sun-dried ones. Thanks for a quick and yet "professional" recipe.

I made these for a New Year's Eve party last night.  WHAT A HIT!  I think I got one of them.  This was my first time making bruschetta and it wasn't as intimidating as I thought it would be.  We'll definitely try some more bruschetta recipes.

I tried this out for my NYE party last night, and it was a HUGE hit.  I added a lot more balsamic than called for, just because I love it.  I also added a touch of sugar to round out the flavors.  I used canned diced tomatoes and drained them in a mesh colander.  I was asked for the recipe several times, and my boyfriend demanded that I remember this recipe and make it often.  This would be amazing as a pasta sauce as well.

This is the best bruschetta I've ever had.  I made this for Christmas Day and they were gone in less than an hour.  Even the professional chef in the family loved it!  I did add a little more garlic and basil than suggested and as another review said, I toasted the bread with a little olive oil to add flavor.  Perfect recipe!

I thought this recipe was wonderful!  The sun dried tomatoes really add a sweet complexity to it.  I did halve the recipe, but followed the proportions exactly as written.  This was a big hit for our Christmas Eve appetizer - and really, it came together very quickly - about 5-10 min of chopping and 5 min under the broiler and you are all set.  Everyone did agree that the mozzerella cheese doesn't add a whole lot of flavor, and the recipe would be fine without it.  I think it would be great just tossing the tomato topping with some pasta for a quick meal.

YUMMY!  I did take shortcuts as advised by others.  2 cans petite diced tomatoes, and 1/2 of a 9oz jar sundried tomato spread.  Also, as others suggested, I brushed the bread slices with oil and baked @ 400 for 5 min.  Added the tomato mix and cheese and baked 5 more minutes - they were perfect!

If it gave me an option to give more than 5 stars, then I would. It taste AMAZING... restaurant quality! Even though I followed the directions, I felt that the bread was a tad bit soggy. Maybe I should've used baguette instead of Italian bread. Either way, it's darn good! Be sure to brush olive oil on the bread before toasting, otherwise it'll get burnt.

Fabulous!   Changes I make:  I use only 1/8 cup of olive oil, 1/4 cup of sun dried tomatoes and I don't bake it or add the cheese.  I think it tastes much better without it.

This came out DELICIOUS! Hubby was still raving at breakfast this morning about how good they were last night.  Very very easy to make, I didn't find it time consuming at all.  We preferred toasting the bread first with half the olive oil.  Next time I'll try the suggestion of cheese on the toast, then topping with the tomato mixture - it did tend to get a little soggy in the middle even on the toasted bread.  The cheese would make a great barrier between the bread and tomato juices.

delicious!!
I made this the day before I served it at a party and it was a HUGE hit.  I substituted 1/2 cup roasted red peppers for the sun-dried tomatoes, and they added so much to the dish.  I also used one sweet onion finely chopped.  Instead of shredded mozzarella, I used a round of fresh mozzarella, chopped/torn into pieces and mixed with the bruschetta.  I put it in the fridge for about 24 hours and then served it, allowing quests to dish it out.  I made a triple recipe (tripling all of my additions also) and it was gone halfway through the party!  Thanks for the great recipe--I will be making again!!

I used multi-grain baguette that was getting stale. I also substituted grape tomatoes and added roasted red pepper and oregano to the bruschetta mix. I brushed the bread with pesto before browning in the oven. Then I placed some shredded mixed Italian cheeses on the bread underneath the bruschetta mix. I didn't have fresh basil, but used frozen, which has just as much flavor!

i just made this tonight for an appetizer party and it was a huge success.  i added more garlic and more vinegar, my two favorite things and it was so flavorful, not over powering at all.  and i actually brushed the bread with melted butter and a garlic clove and then added the cheese to the bread and broiled that first and then brought the breads on a platter and the tomatoes in a bowl in the middle and everyone could make their own.  also I didnt care for the drie tomatoes, I will leave those out next time but other then that, it was AWESOME!!!!

I have to say my husband, who is not the tomato lover, really enjoyed these. Myself, the actual tomato lover, didn't really like them. I think it was more of the balsamic vinegar that I didn't enjoy in this recipe.

This is an amazing recipe...I made the tomato mixture the night before and allowed to chill all night.  It was a huge hit.  So huge that it has already been requested for a baby shower coming up soon.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I did make a few minor adjustments like more garlic, salt, pepper and added oregano (just a hint).  It was delicious.

I've been making this recipe for the last 2 summers and it is definitely my go to recipe when I have some fresh garden tomatoes sitting on my counter.  Delicious!

I made this last night for a dinner party. It was great. I toasted the french bread slices before I put the Bruschetta  and cheese on it.It was very flavorful and a big hit. We did have some for lunch today and it was still very good. I just had to drain the tomato mixture before I used it today because it became a little runny as tomatoes do. Definitely a keeper. I also upped the fresh basil because we are such big fans. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was delicious!  I used fresh tomatoes from the garden, as well as homemade sourdough bread.  I bought fresh mozzarella from an Italian deli and put some slivers on top.  I baked the bread before I put on the mixture, but I did not top with oil as some suggested - it was delicious and skipped unnecessary fat.  Next time I will even use a bit less oil.

Best bruschetta ever!  I made this as a side dish for dinner and ended up eating more bruschetta than dinner!  Some changes: I left out the sun dried tomatoes since I don't like them, baked the bread at 350 instead of broil, italian bread instead of french because there wasn't any french bread at the store. Amazing!!!

This was amazing.  The combination of basil, balsamic, and garlic is perfect.  Also, I learned you have to watch your bread while it's broiling--it started burning at only two minutes!

Yum! I love this recipe and it is requested often by friends. I use 2 cans of petite tomatoes instead of fresh and I toast the bread with olive oil and cheese and serve the brushetta seperately for dipping.

The balsamic vinegar was a little to much for our tastes.  Will reduce it next time.  And there will be a next time because we really liked it.

Delicious! Except for chopping the tomatoes, it is fast and easy. I was told it was restaurant quality by friends.
I didn't like the cheese so I stopped putting that on there, but others enjoyed the cheese so that is probably is just personal taste.
I also didn't like broiling the bread with the mixture on top, so I just did the bread and put the cold mixture on after.

The only changes I made were adding cubed mozzarella and 1/4 minced red onion. I will also cut down on the olive oil next time. I only gave it four stars because as directed, you have to bake. This type of appetizer doesn't need to be baked and is just as good served cold on toast.

I made this for a gettogether with my friends and their husbands. As always, I hadn't finished all my recipes and the tomato mixture was waiting to be put on the bread and into the oven. It never made it to the bread because everyone immediately dug into it. Delicious!! I plan to try the FULL recipe next time.

I don't know if a recipe could possibly be any more perfect. This was a recipe my mom referred me to after she raved about it herself. I let it marinate 24 hours, and although the balsamic vinegar did turn it a darker color, nobody minded at all. It really soaked up all of the flavors and made SO much that I was able to use the leftovers for a second loaf of bread the next time! This will be considered one of my all-time favorite recipes.

I made the spread ahead of time, in the essence of time I used canned diced tomatoes and just chopped them up smaller. I also bought presliced sourdough bread. I found I needed to flip the slices when I put them under the broiler to get both sides crunchy. They were delicious!!!

Love It! Made it twice already. Followed ingredients exactly. Got RAVE reviews for this one.  I served it fresh with crostini.  I tried it oven baked and it was lovely but prefered fresh. Also much easier when hosting.

This was good and had great appearance, however it was starting to taste too close to a pizza like taste.  I may have to adjust something so that it doesn't don't know what yet.

Exceptionally wonderful! It was gone before I even had a chance to grab one! Good thing I was able to grab a couple hot out of the oven. I made the recipe exactly as stated. I will make these again!

This is always a hit when I make it for parties. I use goat cheese instead of mozzerella and it is fantastic!

This recipe is unbelievable!  I broiled the bread with mozza on it and then allowed my guests to top with their own bruschetta.  It made lots so I was able to try it with 2 sets of friends and both loved it.  Thanks!

These are heavenly! I wish I had all the ingredients to make them right now. Soooooo soooooo good and so so easy to make. I think I made them three times the day I tried these out. I love tomatoes and sundried tomatoes so this recipe was perfect. Oh, and who doesn't love basil? And cheese... and balsamic... haha, I think you get my point.

Very easy to make. I preferred this recipe over the store bought bruschetta.  I used only 1 clove of garlic and that tasted great. I didn't have sundried tomatoes so I left them out.  I will make these again soon. thanks

EASY and fabulous!  Served this with a Zuppa Toscana recipe and a goat cheese appetizer.  It was delicious.  And I couldn't believe how easy it was.  We didn't do the mozza step - just put a bowl out and let people spoon it over their bread.  We used a homemade pesto bread instead of the baguette.  Completely terrific.

OH MY!!  This was delicious!  Used home-made french loaf and cherry tomatoes from the farmer's market. The flavor had a depth that really put these over the top!  Easy-peesy!  Will make again, for sure. Update: This is now what I am famous for among my close friends.  I serve it at almost every dinner party.  And I make it for my boyfriend just about every week.  He loves it.

This brushetta is fabulous.  I am not a sun-dried tomato lover, but I used them in the recipe, and it was terrific.  Absolutely use fresh basil---it is one of the most important ingredients. It is so easy to make this, and it will receive raves. Definitely use a little less oil.  You can buy pre-packaged oven baked Italian toast in the cracker aisle of a supermarket, and make this even easier.  I did not bake them with cheese but merely put the tomato topping on the crackers.  They are scrumptious, but are a bit messy.  Serve with those you know very well, and there will be NONE left over.

Thank you for the recipe! I myself don't care for tomatoes so I didn't eat it but I made them as an afternoon snack for my boyfriend and he loved them! I reduced the serving amount to 4 but he ate them all in one sitting..lol..

We are very picky...and this is an excellent recipe. I added a tad bit more sun-dried tomatoes than the recipe calls for and I chopped them up so I could get an "all throughout" flavor. Yum! Definitely let them sit for awhile to let the flavors mingle!

My family just loves this receipe. I have tried a few different versions but this has  been the best by far. It is all in the balsamic vinegar. The better quality you buy the more it brings out the flavor in the receipe.

This turned out excellent! And if you like garlic, you will love this recipe!! I cut up some mozzerella cheese into little cubes and put it in the mixture as well. If you put some cheese down on the bread under the bruschetta mix, it'll keep the mixture from sliding off while eating as well. Perfect recipe, will make again!

This was excellent, i needed a recipe to use up my leftover french bread.  I did not have any sun dried tomatoes and it was still perfect, i followed the rest of the recipe as is.  My tomoates did not fall off at all, what i did was i had the mozzeralla cut thin like for sandwhich, i then sliced it in half and then cut it into very thin slices, and placed the cheese on top in rows.  No falling tomoatoes and perfect recipe.

I also got rave reviews on this recipe over the holidays.  By far the best I've ever tried.  Follow the advice of others and use the fresh basil for more intense flavor.  And allowing it to sit overnight does help as well. I used fresh bread and melted cheese right on bread and left others plain so the guests could make their own choices, both ways are great(had to test it). Great with and Italian meal or as an appetizer.  Thanks for a great keeper recipe!!

Heck yes, these were so good. I heart tomatoes and this is really  110% as good or better than anything you can buy out and about. I did omit the sun dried tomatoes cause I don't like the texture but it still so rocked. Also I used italian bread as opposed to french but whatever, it was still gone in 2.5 seconds. You'll love it, try it!

YUM!  This is a FANTASTIC app!  Served last night and people LOVED it.  Followed the recipe.  Next time I might put 1/2 regular olive oil and 1/2 the oil from the sun dried tomoatoes to give it a little more somethin somethin.  I'll also add just a tad more garlic too.  Either way this is a SLAM dunk.

Delicious.  I've made this recipe a few times and each time it was devoured.  I make 2 changes to the recipe.  #1 - Instead of adding olive oil, I add the oil from the jar of sundried tomatoes.  Much more flavor.  #2 - Instead of using a baguette, I buy Panetini at Costco (essentially garlic bread crisps) to cut down on time.  Yummy.

This is an AMAZING recipe.  Do not pass it up...it is restaurant quality.  

I normally do not like sun-dried tomatoes but it really does add flavour to an otherwise typical recipe without being overpowering.  It is the "secret" ingredient that sets this recipe apart from all the others.

I finely chopped the sun-dried tomatoes to ensure they were evenly distributed in the mixture.  I accidentally used more garlic than the recipe calls for and it still tasted heavenly.

Wonderful and delicious - I will add it to my regular rotation.

I brought this to Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it and said it was the Best they've ever had.  I also did like other reviewers and brushed olive oil on the bread and put cheese on top and then broiled it till golden and set them out next to the bruschetta so people could add it themselves.  This is a definite keeper!!

I made this for a Thanksgiving appetizer.  Everyone loved it and was looking for more.  I made extra and we ate it for lunch the next day.  I toasted the bread first and substituted fresh sliced mozzarella and "par broiled" first, so it would hold together better.

FANTASTIC! Took to a recent party, and a doubled recipe was GONE in under 20 minutes. Fresh mozzarella makes a HUGE difference -- would highly reco using it.

I used the ingredients as written but brushed the oil onto the bread, toasted, then applied the tomato mixture. This was really super. My husband dubbed it "restaurant quality"!

Thanks for a great recipe.

Don't look any further - this is an amazing recipe that will impress your friends! Gourmet and easy. Two words I love. The balsamic is a great touch and fresh basil is a must. I added more garlic, substituted grated parmesan into the mix insead of moz on top, left out the broiling step, and it was still amazing. This might be the best bruschetta ever.

This was terrific!  Like others, I first melted the cheese onto the fresh baguette bread (350F for about 7-10 minutes) and then added the topping at the event.  I added about 1 cup of shredded asiago cheese to the tomato mixture. I really love the taste of garlic, so I increased that to about 6 tsp of chopped garlic in a double recipe! Everyone said it was a winner. A double recipe covers 4 baguettes for a crowd with a little to spare.  Yummy.  Will certainly repeat again!

Fantastic flavor!  I made these for my best friend's bridal shower I hosted and everyone LOVED it.  Because the shower was held 20 miles from my house, I took another cook's recommendation of broiling the cheese over the baguette slices and bringing those and the tomato mixture together separately and let everyone assemble themselves.  This is a keeper!

I know it's a little untraditional but all I had on hand was some whole wheat bread so in place of the baguette I used that. Followed the rest of the recipe as written and it turned out great. Loved this bruschetta!

I make this all the time now.  So much better than cold bruschetta you load on your bread yourself.  The only thing I do differently is add Parmesan Reggiano cheese into my tomato mixture, because you simply can't have too much cheese!

This is VERY good!! I have tried Bruschetta many times, but I have to say, this one is my favorite. I think the key is the sundried tomatoes packed in oil. They added a wonderful full flavor that you don't get with just the fresh tomatoes. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing next time I make them. I served them at my "Italian Girls Night" and everyone loved them! Thanks for a great keeper!!!

This is AWESOME!!  I didn't have the sun-dried tomatoes or fresh basil, so used regular tomatoes and 2T dried basil and it still was amazing.  I also simplified it by using french bread and just put the topping on it (sliced in half of course) and toasted; I cut the slices after it was toasted.  This cut down on mess and time.  Everyone at the party asked for the recipe.

This bruschetta recipe is the best! For the bread, I used sourdough and toasted fresh grated parmesan under the broiler for about 6 minutes.

This was a great recipe!  I added onions and omitted the sundried tomatoes (only because I didn't have any in the house).  Took it camping and put it on top of our t-bone steaks while they were finishing up on the grill - wonderful!  Hubby plans to use it as a topping on his hotdog next time I make it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I took this to a party and it was a big hit; people were going back for thirds and fourths. It was even more delicious the next day. I did not have enough fresh basil, so I used some fresh and some dried, and it was fine. I also chopped the sundried tomatoes. I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion and served the bread slices separately with cheese melted on them. I was glad I did because it was less messy and the tomato mixture was so juicy I think it would have been soggy if assembled beforehand. (If you do this, though, you will probably want to make sure to have extra bread because it is very appealing and people will grab it to eat by itself and with other dishes.) So good, and simple!

These were delicious!  I chopped the basil and the sundried tomatoes.  I could not find sundried tomatoes packed in oil in my supermarket (just ones that were loose, not in oil), so I combined those and the oil in the recipe a few hours before I made it.  I also flipped the bread over after toasting it, before adding the topping.  I didn't have mozz., so I used a little fresh parm that I was using in my main dish.  Yummy!!

This was a hit at my party.  I followed the recipe as is except I put 1.5 TBS of olive oil vs. 1/4 cup olive oil (cuts down on calories) and added a splash of lemon juice.  For toping I used shredded mozzarella cheese (low moisture / part skim) and shredded provolone cheese.  Awesome!

All I can say is it smelled so good. By the time was I was out of the kitchen and ready to eat all the Bruschetta was gone (first may I add) and all my guests raved about it. So I was kinda mad I didn't get a taste, but I will make a double batch next time and make sure to save me a piece.

I made this for an "Italian Dinner Party" appetizer and it was a huge hit.  I lightly toasted the baguette bread first, brushing lightly with EVOO and a little parmesan (green container). I also combined all the ingredients about 2 hours ahead, EXCEPT the romas, I added those just before topping the bread to avoid any discoloration or sogginess. I also added a touch of red onion.  These were enjoyed by all. A must for future gatherings.

I did without the sun dried tomato and it still turned out amazing! My only recommendation is to  toast the bread separate and place around bruschetta mixture. Many italian restaurants serve it this way, also if you want to put cheese on it then melt on some of the sliced bread. My personal favorite, fresh mozzarella.

I made this for a friends suprise 40th birthday party. Incredible!!  Everyone wanted the recipe. I cut cost a little by using a bag of dried sun-dried tomatoes and rehydrated them according to package instructions.  Definate do-over.

I threw a party this weekend and included these as one of the appetizers and they were VERY well received.  Several people asked for the recipe and I had to make more half way through the party because people were still asking for them after we ran out! These were too easy to make and too delicious to NOT make these again. Thanks!!

This is excellent - I made it a couple of times and am about to do now.  I even used sundried paste in leiu of the tomatoes in the jar.  Mix it with the fresh tomatoes.  YUMMY and it reheats well too.

I think that this recipe is of resturant quality...but you must use fresh basil.  I agree with not using shredded cheese...much easier cutting it in slices to fit the bread size...less messy.

Made this as is except only used 2 cloves garlic.  This was still too much garlic.  Overall taste was very good.  I would make this again, except use less garlic.

Made this to have something different at this year's Thanksgiving dinner.  IT WAS AWESOME!  I made it the night before, so I think the spices really had time to release.  I plan to make it at Christmas too.  It's a nice change from the norm.

I make the tomato mixture without the basil the day before. I drain it a bit and add the basil before baking.  Very good, took to a ladies tea at church and it was well received.

I've never made bruschetta before and this was fabulous!  I think the sundried tomatoes made all the difference.  I had some mixture left over since I ran out of bread so we put the bruschetta on steak sandwiches the next day.  So good!  Definitely will make again.

Superb these were a real hit and so full of taste.  I as others added more garlic (family of garlic freaks).  Once again I made the mistake of using Mozzarella, it is so long ago since I last used it I forgot just how bland it can be and hey who needs all those calories racing to the hips for no flavour? So next time will be using Parmesan or Grana Padano.  It is a little messy but really worth it. This one is most certainly a keeper.  Thanks Loll

I love this bruschetta and have made it several times.  I add more garlic--personal preference--and will substitute parmesan cheese when I don't have mozzarella.  Check the broiler often when you make this, though, as some ovens cook more quickly than others and the broiler can quickly burn the cheese and bread if you aren't watching.

Eliminated the sun dried tomatoes and used up some old bread and substituted the cheese to pre-grated mixed cheese, and it turned out so AWESOME! Thanks for the idea.

Awesome bruschetta.  People were eating spoonfuls when the  bread ran out.  I've already made it twice in the last week.

I made this using tomatos from my garden. If you really want to blow your tastebuds away...just toast the bread in the toaster, spread goat cheese on it and top with this!! You're taste buds will be begging for more! EXCELLENT RECIPE!! Thanks so much!! This is one I can't wait to take to a gathering and suck up the compliments!!

Fantastico! For the final broil I used a toaster oven so that these could be done in smaller batches and eaten immediately. My family waited eagerly for each batch!

Since the sun dried tomatoes were already packed in oil, next time I'm going to reduce the amount of olive oil a bit. And I will be making it again very soon!

This is a fantastic and easy recipe!  Of course, the key is fresh tomatoes and fresh basil.  So easy to mix this up, spoon it on the bread and have a delicious and impressive appetizer or snack.  I have also made it without the sun-dried tomatoes and it is equally tasty.

I used more sun-dried tomatoes than the recipe called for - and thought they were a bit overwhelming.  My own fault.  However, next time, I'll stick to the proportions as listed and I'm sure it will be fine.  I did make the tomato mixture earlier in the day so I wasn't so rushed just before dinner.  I will make this again.

I followed this recipe exact and it was a hit at my party. It definitely has a strong tomatoe taste and the name suggests. I would suggest making the tomatoe mixture the day before you plan on serving.

Delicious and easy to make -well, except for all the chopping.  I forgot to get the sun-dried tomatoes and it turned out fine.  I love balsamic vinegar but found that there was too much (perhaps because I didn't have the sun-dried tomatoes.)  I used 2 tablespoons of the olive oil to brush on the bread before broiling and then added the tomatoes topped by parmesan cheese.  It was delicious but the bread was a little too soggy. I think it might be even soggier if I had the sun-dried tomatoes packed in olive oil. In the future I will either use less balsamic vinegar, not brush olive oil on the bread or spread the mixture over 24 slices of bread instead of 12. If you do use mozzarella, you won't need as much as the recipe calls for.

This bruschetta recipe is so good. The sun dried tomatoes give it a flavor that is deep and rich. I'll never make it without adding them again. Plus, I used basalmic glaze instead of regular. Its nice and thick, again I was going for flavor depth, and it did not disappoint. I also use about 3 times the garlic, too. This recipe is a winner, and worthy of making again!

Yummy!  Big hit at a birthday party.  I used canned petite tomatoes and placed the mozzarella on the toasted bread and then added the tomato mixture. Absolutely delicious.

Delicious.  The only deviation I made was I use bakery sliced 1/2 slices that I buttered before toasting and shredded Italian cheese bagged mix.

I was making a meal at the same time as the bruschetta that called for 3 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan cheese and 1 teaspoon brown sugar mixed together needles to say when it came time to add the cheese that is what I added and put back in the oven but only about 2 minutes when the cheese started to turn colour.  Luck was on my side as everyone thought it was very good.  Maybe next time I will get it right or sprinkle a little of the Parmesan sugar mix on after it has been in the oven 3 minutes.

This is very very good! I have always made one similar to this with green onions and no basil or vinegar & I didn’t put it back in the oven with the cheese. This is a nice change. My family loves both recipes. I will make bothoften. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Wonderful recipe. Everyone loves this appetizer. 
Made a few changes along the way - did not have sun dried tomatoes, so I doubled up on the campari tomatoes that I had. Now  I always use the Campari. Be sure to deseed the tomatoes, otherwise there will too much moisture (and will be a little bitter). After many trials, we now brush the sides of the bread with garlic infused olive oil before broiling, then melt the cheese on one side. This keeps the bread crisp, and the cheese acts as a barrier for the bruschetta. Always use fresh basil, it just isn't the same without it.

This was awesome, with so many positive reviews how could I miss?!  The only change was that I used cherry tomatoes from the garden - yummy!!  My boyfriend ate it the next day and said it was even better - this one is definitely making it to my recipe book!

I will make it again. However I will use two loaves of bread or reduce the number of Roma tomatoes. I liberally topped each piece of bread and covered them with cheese and I had enough left over for another loaf of bread. Also thinking about using the left over tomatoes as a base for a pizza.

I used 8 tomatoes just because I bought too many.  I scooped out and discarded the pulp and seeds and chopped up the rest.  Added the rest of the ingredients (dried basil at first) and let it  marinate together for few hours.  Later, I added fresh chopped basil and large cuts of buffalo mozzarella.  I toasted the bread and the put the tomato mix in a dish and let people pile on what they want.  Rave reviews.

A fabulous recipe. The change I made was I added 2 tablespoons of dry good seasons original dressing mix. It added  a unique oomph. I made a double batch and like another reviewer I toasted the bread separately and guests put the tomato mixture on the bread as a topping. It's easier that way.

I like to prepare this a bit ahead to let the flavors blend. I have served it with the bread toasted and the topping in a bowl so guests could top their own and also fresh out of the oven all put together. It is excellent either way. Garden tomatoes make it perfection. I  personally would not use canned tomatoes.

In all fairness I really only used some suggestions/ingredients from this so I don't blame the recipe. However all bruschetta recipes have a very high standard to meet in my book. The garlic brought it up a notch from others I have tried, but I do not understand the mozzarella instead of fresh parm. I always use fresh parm and fresh basil (the SO thinks I am becoming a food snob...lol) in bruschetta.

This was just okay in my opinion. I have had better bruschetta that was actually easier to make than this recipe. I would keep searching if I were you - I could change the recipe, but that would seem pointless to me.

I added artichokes to this recipe for some extra vegetables and some yellow and red grapes tomatoes to give it some different textures and colour.
Overall, it was a great recipe.  Thanks.

I've only made a bruschetta recipe once before, many years ago. I thought this one looked good due to the addition of the sun-dried tomatoes.  I followed the recipe exactly except for reducing the olive oil a bit, per other reviews. It was a hit at a dinner I prepared for neighbors.  I will for sure make this again, and maybe not wait for entertaining to do so!

AMAZING! This is so delicious! Truth be told, I never cared for tomatoes until I tried this. Like other people say, you definitely want to use FRESH basil. I like to add a bit of fresh oregano with it. It also helps to brush the bread with a bit of olive oil before broiling. I find it takes a tad longer than 1-2 minutes. You want to be sure the bread is golden crispy before putting the tomato on. I've made this several times. It's a perfect appetizer.

Huge hit at my last party! My husband accidentally bought way too much baquette, so I ended up using it and doubling the recipe. I worried that no one would eat it as we had so much other food. It was gone and everyone kept moaning about how great it was. Thank you so so much for this recipe.

Recipe was good. Not sure I cared for the sundried tomatoe.  I found I had to add a couple of things like onion to make it more flavorful. It’s  a good base recipe that you should alter to improve the flavors

Quick, easy and delicious! Had some extra tomatoes and basil that we needed to use up so this was perfect. I didn't have any sundried tomatoes in oil but had sundried tomatoe paste in a tube so added that. FANTASTIC!

This was a good appetizer recipe.  The changes I made were to use cherry tomatoes instead of roma (since that was what I happened to have), dried spices, and sliced mozzarella instead of shredded.  I also did not have any sundried tomatoes in oil so I just used dried instead.  I thought it still turned out great.  Next time I would definitely slice the sundried tomatoes to make eating a little easier.

In preparing the recipe I mistakenly read "cloves of garlic" as "tablespoons of garlic" - which is about 6x as much garlic.  It was actually pretty good!  I would not suggest 6x the garlic but would definitely recommend doubling the garlic if your family loves garlic as much as mine does.  Second time I made it I also put in more garlic, and used a multigrain baguette - YUM!

This is an excellent bruschetta recipe! I left the sun-dried tomatoes out (personal preference) and served over baguette slices brushed with olive oil and broiled until just toasty.

Very tasty! Made it as listed. It was liste as a 12 serving recipe, I was preparing for 24. Well the original recipe would have been sufficient for 12 servings!  I have half of the doubled recipe leftover. My friends raved over the recipe!  Will make again!

I would use less garlic next time I make it.  I love garlic but was a bit over powering.  I did use a bit less oil.  
A great recipe.  Loved it.

Love, loved it.  So easy to make.  Made it up in the morning as  we had a play to go to in the afternoon.  When we came home with our friends all I had to do was put  the tomato mixture and cheese on the bread.   So quick and everyone loved it even asking for the recipe.

I love this recipe!! I make it every September long weekend at the lake with fresh tomatoes from the garden. It is a huge hit! I don't always use Roma, but if you are using a slicer tomato, just make sure you drain the extra juices from the tomatoes before adding it to the mix. Don't skip on the garlic, in fact, add more is you are a garlic lover like me. This recipe is definitely the best bruschetta recipe.

This was delicious. I used Sun-dried tomato pesto rather than sun-dried tomatoes in oil. I also cut the mozzarella in half and replaced it with crumbled goat cheese. Perfect.

Well I changed this recipe up a bit because of what I had on hand. I really enjoyed it. I followed the recipe with the both of the tomatoes, instead of the vinegar I did a balsamic glaze (2cups balsamic & 1/2 cup brown sugar--let reduce by half). i used feta instead of mozzarella because i food prep and i wasn't sure mixing it in would work well. Last i  baked pita bread (to a crisp) cut into 4ths instead of the bread you should use because i made pita pizzas and had some leftover... Overall, i will probably make it exactly the same next time, i really enjoyed it. (especially the glaze)

Made no changes. Loved it! The sun-dried tomatoes gave this bruschetta a lovely lift from the ordinary. Thanks again to allrecipes for the ingredient search function. Oddly, the allrecipes ingredient search function does not always work. But happily this time it did. I had a partial jar of sun-dried tomatoes I wanted to use up. This was a great use.

Had a lot of tomatoes and Wanted to get a sense of ratios of ingredients   Didn't have sundried tomatoes and used taco-spiced shredded cheese so didn't put it under broiler.  In spite of this, it was really very good.

Delish! All of the reviews reflect my opinion on fresh basil, sundried tomatoes etc.  If you enjoy olives, I chopped up a few kalamata olives and added them then subbed the mozza for feta just to switch it up and it was a new five star!

I didn't have sun dried tomato so I cut up a couple more fresh ones.  I followed all other ingredients and I added feta to the mixture.  We put on english muffins for breakfast and they were great.  I boiled some egg noodles and washed them with cold water and poured remaining mixture on those for lunch with a little Parmesan on top.  Yum.

I've been making this for years and it's always a hit! I put the sundries tomatoes in the chopper so they blend well. I serve it as directed or sometimes I just toast sliced French baguette and spread cream cheese then top with the bruschetta

It's excellent!  I didn't tweak it. ( I had to use my own sun dried tomatoes packed in olive oil and it was still yummy.)  If you want the best Balsamic Vinegar - that I've ever tasted - google Napa Valley Naturals, and select 'Grand Valley Reserve'  from options on the left of page.  About $7/bottle when ordered by the case - gift some.  It pours like liquid chocolate.

Delicious and easy.  I omitted the sun-dried tomatoes and it was still very good.  Watch them while they a broiling in the oven - there is not much time in between baked and burned!  Also, I did not measure the amount of mozzarella cheese, but rather sprinkled some on top of each slice. I would make again.

Really good!  I rubbed a small amount of garlic on the bread followed by brushing olive oil on before toasting.  Since I made this to take to an event, I followed another person's suggestion by putting the tomato mixture in a bowl so I had everyone put their own mixture on the bread.  That way the bread did not get soggy.  I think that worked out better.

Following reviews I brushed the bread with olive oil and parmesan to toast.  I also added some onion, extra garlic, some celery seed, salt and pepper.  I let this sit all day.  I drained most of the liquid off before serving at room temperature. It was a big hit at our pre wine tasting happy hour.

Today I used some of my big mama tomatoes mixed with one Black Krim tomato for this recipe. The big mamma has very pink flesh and the black krim has dark purple flesh. These 2 flavors and colors meld together well. All fresh ingredients make this the best bruschetta I've ever had. This was our dinner tonight!

Anywho I'm attempting to cook backwards from my first issue to now...random hobby I know. I found this recipe in the Aug, 2014 issue and decided to try it. Theres only one of me but im a fool and decided to make this recipe as written don't get me wrong, it was delicous but one can only eat so much bruschetta on standard french bread. Do me a favor...marinate your chicken in the leftover, add cream, more savory sauces, whatever! Some salt, pepper and nice thin pasta and its an additional winner! The original recipe is amazing AND the leftover possibilities are endless...YES PLEASE!

I've made this more than 20 times and have shared this recipe with family members.  It's a hit ALL the time... people stand around the plate and keep eating it, as if it were dinner; they can't get enough of it... A few things: 1- you don't have to use the cheese, although it's amazing with the cheese-it's just as amazing without it; 2- when cutting up the tomatoes I remove the seeds and the bitter pulp (it makes a huge difference) and it makes it less watery; 3- use the best olive oil and balsamic vinegar you can get -  I purchase my olive oil in TJX, Marshall's etc.,  I use a 25 year balsamic (William Sonoma),  totally decadent.  Best recipe ever!

Made it as written the first time.  Raves all 'round.  Second time, followed suggestion of putting mozz slices on bread, then tomatoes et.al.  Third time, put a few capers under the cheese!
Once, I had a little left over basil pesto, smeared it on the bread first.  All iterations were well received.

This is the BEST bruschetta recipe! I have made this several times as written and with the following modifications.  If I can't get "fresh" enough tomatoes I have used canned diced. I make the tomato mixture the night before-to let the flavors blend. Per another readers advice. I lightly toast the bread w olive oil.  When I am ready to serve, I melt the mozzarella (when having a large party short on oven space have done this in a microwave) in the oven.  I let my guests top the tomato topping themselves.  Smaller groups I might heat the tomato topping, but I normally make this for a crowd,  Always a success!

My go to summer appetizer.  If you can, add the fresh basil just prior to serving for beauty and taste.  I skip the mozzarella and provide a bowl of feta for guests to sprinkle on top.  Adding the feta to the tomatoes tastes great but doesn’t look as pretty.

Loved it!! The only change I made was I didn't add the extra olive oil. I used the oil from the jar of sun dried tomatoes instead. Very good!!

Awesome recipe. Be sure to use fresh tomatoes and basil. We preferred strips of fresh mozzarella on top. So delicious! Thank you for the smiles on my family's faces!

I make this on the grill a few times every summer and wouldn't change a thing in the recipe.  Great for an appetizer or with other grilled food.  My daughter isn't a big fan of grilled meat - but she loves these.

A great bruschetta! Everyone at the party thought so too. I did a little addition to the mix just for my own taste satisfaction. I added Parmesan cheese in with the tomatoes and a little more balsamic. I also topped it off with some jalapeño jack cheese just to add some heat. Thanks to the poster of this recipe and all the reviewers.

Absolutely love this recipe. The only things I do that isn't mentioned in the instructions is squeeze what oil I can out of the sun dried tomatoes packed in oil, and I add a little fresh chopped oregano to the basil.

I hosted Bunco last night, and decided give this bruschetta recipe a try for a change, as it came highly recommended by some Allrecipeeps of mine.  They were right, this one is delicious! It went over very well with the Bunco ladies.

Perfect as is!! I've made this several times..  I've used fresh sliced mozzarella, goat cheese, and this time shredded mozzarella.. Absolutely delicious.  This recipe yields about 30 servings, and is a perfect and easy appetizer to make for company, etc. it's been a hit every time!

SO GOOD!! I made this and brought it to Thanksgiving dinner as an appetizer and it was gone long before dinner started! Everything tasted so fresh and one can easily mistake it for something you order at the restaurant. Super easy to make, and the balsamic + basil made it all amazing. One thing I added was a teaspoon of minced garlic. I love garlic and found it hard to believe that garlic wasn't in the original recipe.  Garlic is a must if you are a garlic lover!

I didn't have the sun-dried tomatoes so I made the recipe without them.  This recipe exceeded my expectations in every way. We didn't even use the mozzarella.  It was good just cold on bread. I could eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner without with a spoon skipping the bread!

OMG! Made this for my huge Christmas Eve dinner party for the first time.  Husband, who dislikes Italian food, LOVED this!  He went on and on about it!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY!  Got the sun dried tomatoes in oil and used fresh basil.  I did, however, marinate it for a few hours before hand.  Don't change anything!  It's fabulous!!!!

The only change I make, is that I use sun dried tomatoes in oil and instead of adding 1/2 cup of olive oil, I just used the seasoned olive oil already in the jar.  Works great.  Like to put all my ingredients in the food processor and chop them up a bit, as it makes for less messy eating.

I broiled the bread on one side for 2 minutes - removed it and turned them over and put it back in for 40 secs. Once removed I topped it with the ingredients and the mozzarella cheese then I and drizzled olive oil over the top, put it in just until the cheese started to melt! Everyone enjoyed it! Great recipe! 5 stars!!

delicious...but i think the proportion cheese compared to all of the other ingredients is too much. I cut back on the cheese.

The sundried tomatoes really jazzed up the flavor of the usual garlic, tomato, basil, balsamic combo. I was surprised how much we liked this. Will definitely make again.

Delicious! Only note: Make sure to flip the bread and broil on both sides so both are crispy- otherwise the middle gets soggy after putting the tomato mixture on it.  Other than that- so yummy!

This was fantastic.  I didn't add the cheese because I don't need the extra calories but it was delicious without it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Husband and I loved this recipe.  I did cut back on the olive oil (1/8) cup and only had Honey Balsamic vinegar on hand so used it; also, used parmesan in addition.  I do dry my own tomatoes and make my own baguettes.  It was great!

I also wanted to mention that different family members have tried it and love it...also, 7 year old granddaughter ate it for breakfast and almost made herself sick.

I made this without the sun dried tomatoes & it was still awesome. I used fresh tomatoes from my garden (not Roma) & drained them before adding the rest of the ingredients.

I LOVE this recipe! My adjustments: I added feta cheese and used less basil (with fresh basil, the amount listed is a bit much for me) - absolutely amazing. It's always a big hit at parties, and I make it all the time as a pre-dinner snack, since it takes no time at all to prepare!

I have made this several times and always get rave reviews! I have never melted the cheese on the top since I am always serving a large crowd. Instead, I grate fresh mozzarella and mix it into the tomato mixture and let guests serve themselves.  I had bruschetta in a restaurant once that had the cheese this way and I loved it!

I love this recipe!!! Especially in the summer when good tomatoes are abundant. As a shortcut, I buy the bags of baguettes that have already been sliced and toasted. They worked well.

This is a simple and delicious recipe. I definitely recommend using fresh ingredients at all times. A agree with letting the mixture marinade awhile, at least an hour. I tried topping the bruschetta several times with feta cheese crumbles. With the fresh basil the feta is outstanding. Give it a try!

Came out so friggin' good - I didn't think I could make something this tasty! I did light the bread on fire because I didn't understand how the "broil" setting worked on my oven, but the second batch came out okay. This does make a lot though - definitely more than 12 servings...but I'm not complaining!

Served this for a jewelry party at my house. Simple AND delicious! I made a double batch and it was gone by the end of the night. I didn't use the cheese on the bread, that's the only difference! Definitely reccommend!

My favourite bruschetta recipe ever! I was worried the out of season tomatoes at Christmas would dampen the flavor but it was still so great and a huge hit. Everyone loved it!

Skipped the sun dried tomatoes since we're not fans...it needed several hours to marinate and much more basil and GARLIC!  ( : Really good, but not fantastic...maybe a splash of red wine vinegar next time?  Just seemed to need a little "something", but an excellent starting point for sure!

Absolutely delicious.  Served at New Years Eve Party.  Guests loved it.  The only thing that I did differently was to cut whole mozzarella instead of using shredded.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I made this for a dinner party and while it is good, it's not a memorable appetizer, which is why I gave this 4 stars versus 5.  I felt it was missing something...and I wish I could put my finger on what was lacking.  I would make this again but I'm thinking I may experiment with it to figure out what is missing.  The upside to this dish is that since it a bit on the bland side, it would work well for multiple tastes.

We did Christmas in Italy this year at my SIL's house and I was asked to bring an appetizer.  I had been wanting to try this recipe for months and I'm so glad I got the chance.  I didn't change a thing and it was delicious!  Everyone raved about it.  I am definitely lazy when it comes to chopping so maybe next time I'll enlist my food processor to do some of the chopping for me. HA!  I will definitely be making this again!

I made this recipe nearly exactly how it is. Since, I grow basil year round (outside in summer; inside in winter), I used FRESH basil; there is no comparison. 

Awesome recipe!! I've been switching over to a more healthier Italian/Mediterranean diet. Do not overheat your olive oil if your looking for the health benefits and flavor. Heat will kill the health beneficial flavonoids and enzymes. That is why First Cold Pressed Extra Virgin Olive Oil is the BEST and the most Expensive. 

I would not change anything except I might add a little Italian Seasoning to the mixture. Yum!

I used 2/3 the amount garlic listed and skipped the cheese and only broiled the toast.  It turned out delicious and was a big hit!

Couples night; Dining in. The husbands cooked for the wives on this occasion. The girls loved them and so did we. It is a quick, simple and extremely tasteful recipe not just in flavor but presentation too! Will defiantly make this again.

If you like bruschetta than you have to try this recipe. The only change I made was substituting mozza for feta and I also threw in some fresh mint. Whenever we have company over I usually make it and it's always a huge hit! Even my stepmother loves it and she is really fussy.

Great! I was a bit worried about using the oil-packed sundried tomatoes as soon as I opened the jar - they stunk! Bur I followed the recipe as directed, and it turned out to have a great flavor. Took the advice of another reviewer and used a slice of mozza instead of shreddedm Teriffic recipe!

Unreal how much flavor this has in it. I toasted some artisan bread, rubbed it with garlic, then added fresh mozzarella and parm-reg shavings, re-broiled for a min. then added the tomato topping...DIVINE!

Family loved it. Even the picky eaters.  Because of the price of sun dried tomatoes, I used my dehydrator with a little salt and oregano. Turns out great and save a bunch of money.  Now trying to can some to see if it will have some staying power.

This was the first time I made bruschetta and it was everything that was said. Everyone loved them and I saw people going back for seconds so that means a lot. Very simple to make. I made it with fresh basil and garlic. I also made it several hours ahead of time to let everything merinade.  It was outstanding !,

This was really good.  Although I messed up and put a half cup oil in...I had wondered why it seemed like so much!  I guess I will just have to use it up with another batch.  My version of 3 garlic cloves must be bigger that this 3 cloves, cuz it was a little strong.  I'll go smaller next time.  I used regular home grown tomatoes and no sun-dried cuz I didn't have any.  With using home grown tomatoes no need for sugar as someone else said they added some in.  If I had store bought tomatoes, I probably would have done the same.

Yum. (I followed recipe exactly except that I substituted drained, diced canned tomatoes because I had no fresh ones.  It was still yummy.)  Thanks for the recipe! The balsamic vinegar really makes it... and the garlic ... and the basil.  Yum.

Very popular with friends.  I cut the baguette into thinner slices and did mix some shredded Parmesan into a bit less mozzarella cheese.  I strained the mixture a couple of times before putting it on the broiled baguette slices.

This was fabulous! The combination of fresh and sun-dried tomatoes offset by the fresh garlic and balsamic vinegar were the bomb. Plent of garlic finished it off nicely.

I pulled this recipe based on the ratings and I can see why it rated so high.  It is a fabulous recipe, and I doubt you will have leftovers.  After reading some reviews I changed it up just a bit.  I added 1-2 more cloves of garlic, prepared it the day before and used fresh parmesan instead of the mozzarella only because I made another appetizer that included fresh mozzarella.  Definately use fresh basil as it adds a wonderful flavor.  This recipe is a keeper!

Top this with smoked mozzarella and get ready to have your mind blown.   This is a good recipe and is forgiving when it comes to the proportions of the ingredients (for example using 5-8 tomatoes) or if you need to make substitutions (such as regular tomatoes for sun-dried).

I was having a dinner party and the guests included some picky eaters and some gourmet cooks from Europe...rough combination audience. I followed the instructions just as written but there were too many people to melt the cheese so I just offered a really good regiano to add if desired. They scraped the bowl ! All of them. How does the addition of the ground sun dried tomatoes make such a difference? Got me. But it does. I won't ever use another recipe.

Like some of the other reviewers I put in less mayo and added half a package of cream cheese.  I did not use mozzarella cheese at all. I made it hours ahead of time and refrigerated it. It was the best bruschetta I've had!

I'm giving this 5 stars because everyone loved it!!! This is what I did different: -I added shallot -I let the mixture marinate for more than an hour -I toasted the bread on one side, rubbed garlic on it, then toasted the other side with the cheese  and just let everone spoon on however much they wanted. Anyways...big hit!!

This was amazing! I loved it and so did my guest. There were a few things I changed... 1) I brushed olive oil onto the bread and broiled it beforehand, 2) I used the Bruschetta as a dip, 3) I used cubed chunks of Fresh Mozzarella (was fabulous!), 4) and used a little less garlic which made it perfect! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe it was amazing! By the way, I almost omitted the sun-dried tomatoes but decided not to and I am so glad I did! They really added to the flavor!

This is one of those recipes that doesn't need to be changed at all, it's awesome just as written.  I like the flavor that the sun-dried tomatoes add, and the amount of balsamic was spot on for my tastes.  I recommend trying this one exactly as written :)

Love Bruschetta,,its my "ultimate" favorite food. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe other than toasting your bread in the oven/broiler,,then as soon as it comes out hot and crispy,,,rub a nice big fresh garlic clove on one side of all the toasted slices,,,yummo!!

Great recipe!   Made the recipe exactly as written, except used only 1 T of the balsamic vinegar.  Toasting the bread first ensures they are not soggy.  Will definitely make this again!  This bruschetta is the best I've ever made!

Yum.  This recipe is fabulous just placed on a toasted baguette.  We’re in a heat wave and there is no way I’m turning on my oven. . . but it doesn’t matter. I diagonally slice up a baguette and freeze the slices.  I pull the slices out of the freezer and into the toaster as I need them.  Top with a thin slice of fresh mozzarella and then with the bruschetta. Perfect little snack, healthy and delicious.   I did add a little minced shallot to the recipe – just my personal preference.  Thanks for sharing.

I've never made bruschetta before and this recipe was fairly easy and very good.  As other reviewers suggested, I brushed the oil on the bread and broiled for a couple minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I also used slices of mozzarella instead of shredded so it wouldn't fall off the bread.  Next time to save much time I will buy a can of diced tomoatoes instead of chopping all those.  Great recipe!

hmmm... well i'm not sure what to put here because i've NEVER seen a recipe that's held its 5 star rating with so many reviews!  but, there is a but.  not sure that i love the heavy balsamic taste to this one.  i used tomatoes from my garden...2 different varieties because i didn't have sundried.  i love bruschetta and i think all the flavors in this recipe would be amazing but they were so masked by the balsamic that it was hard to tell.

I only rate recipes when they're outstandingly good.  This recipe is so fantastic, that I made it two nights in a row!  Definitively a keeper, and I didn't change a thing (although, I eye-balled most of the recipe, because it's so quick and easy)!   5 Stars all the way!

SOOOO GOOD....this tastes just like it is from a restaurant!  Easy to make for a beginner cook as well.  People will think you are quite a chef if you make this one.  My whole family enjoyed this.  I will certainly be making this again!  I did add a bit of oragno and brushed the bread with olive oil and put it in the oven at 400 for about 3 min before I put on the tomato.  SO VERY GOOD!

I at way too much it was so good. I brushed olive oil on and browned both sides of the bread prior to topping it with the tomato mixture. I'd recommend putting the rack close to the top when melting the cheese, so that it melts quick but leaves the tomato mixture cold.

OH. MY. GOD.   Really, nothing else needs to be said. 50 stars...no, 1000 stars....  I've literally made it every other day for the past week with tomatoes and basil out of the garden and am soooo looking forward to tomorrow so I can have more!

This was great and was gone very quickly at a bridal shower.  As others suggested, I made the toast with cheese the night before and let people put the bruschetta on top of the toasts themselves.  It was perfect.

This was a delicious recipe! My family and I decided to do a 'Come Dine with Me' week where we all got a day on which we would have to serve a starter, main meal and dessert. I had this as my starter and it was wonderful! Everyone loved it -- I think I'll be getting many points!

This is by far the best bruschetta I have ever had. The vinegar absolutely makes this recipe. I've never made bruschetta without green onions, so I sliced and added two. I used a variety of tomatoes from my garden and dry sun-dried tomatoes. I'm also partial to fresh mozzarella. This goes so well over many things; today for lunch I put it over leftover mac and cheese--wow! Can't wait to use this for guests!

This was absolutely delicious!  I did not do steps 4 & 5.  I instead purchased fresh mozzarella, cut it in to small chunks and tossed it with the tomato mixture.  We scooped this on to the toasted french baguette slices and it was wonderful!

I made this exactly as the recipe states and it was great.  Might skip the olive oil next time as it was a little too soupy for me.

This bruschetta was great. It had just the right amount of flavor. I didn't like the sundried tomatoes very much but I'm going to try it again with a different brand and cut them up really small. Such a quick and easy snack.

Amazing, we just couldn't stop eating it. I did brush a little olive oil on each slice before broiling and the fresh tomatoes and basil were heavenly. Can't wait to make it again, thanks for sharing.

Wonderful!  Wonderful!  I think the sun dried tomatoes mixed with the fresh tomatoes and fresh basil really put this recipe over the edge as one of the best bruschetta recipes around.  Have gotten lots of compliments on this every time I have served this!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great! But needs onion! A small vidalia added makes all the difference. You dont even need the cheese on top, just serve the baguettes with the bruschetta in a bowl so people can help themselves!

Fixed this for my daughter's graduation party and it got rave reviews.  Some of the kids couldn't quit eating it!  I tripled the recipes but used only 1 jar of the sun dried tomatoes b/c that's all I had.  I used quite a bit of extra garlic. Toasted some crostinis with olive oil and garlic and some with olive oil and pesto and served with parmesan and feta on the side. Will be making this again soon!

Made this for father's day, and everyone loved it!!!  It tastes even better the next day.  I found that toasting the baguette made it too hard, I just cut fresh baguette, scooped fresh mozzarella, and put that and bruschetta in a bowl to the side... was perfect!  People put just the amount they wanted on top!!  Will definitely make again!!

The grocery store was out of fresh basil so I had to use dried- still very good. Definitely use french bread and not Italian or it will become mushy.

Why did I ever wait so long to make Bruschetta? This is so easy. A neighbor gave me fresh basil from her garden, so I decided to give this recipe a try. Fantastico! A huge hit with the family. Definitely use fresh basil, not dried. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was really good, but I would recommend turning the bread over and toasting the other side under the broiler also. The bottom side being soft made this really hard to eat because the bread tried to fall apart in your hand.

My friend printed out this recipe and made it for a dinner party at my house. We actually used my toaster oven on the broil setting. She forgot to toast the baguette slices first, but it still turned out great. Oh, and she used thinly sliced mozzarella cheese instead of shredded (less mess). I'd love to try it with FRESH mozzarella.

WOW Yummy! Amazing Bruschetta. Easy to make ahead. The longer is marinates together the richer the flavour. I topped mine with feta instead of mozzerella and it was superfantastic.

Had a version of this at a party recently, and even though I love bruschetta, I've never made it!  I also decided to leave out the cheese and just have it cold on french bread. Also added the raw garlic rubbed onto the bread....excellent!  Will definitely make again, a wonderful appetizer at any time of the year!

Laurie, you are my son's hero.  Bruschetta is a huge favorite for him and I made this tonight with some leftover French bread that i made yesterday.  I didn't have any sun dried tomatoes, but instead used sun dried tomato pesto... about 3 or 4 TBS.  That really made it pop!  My husband and son even tossed it into their pasta con aglio de olio (pasta with olive oil and garlic - I just learned the real name today!) to use it as a fresh pasta sauce.  There was nothing left!!!  I did tweak just slightly.  Garlic is good at 3 cloves, but don't forget to rub some raw clove on your bread after grilling!  I put my sliced bread on the BBQ and grilled my breads, rubbed raw garlic on them and a quick slash of olive oil to each one, used these for the bruschetta.  Finally, I didn't have mozzerella and didn't want to broil it because I did NOT want soggy bread bottoms.  I skipped the cheese altogether and served the bread on a platter and bruschetta in a bowl.  I had fresh grated parmesana-reggiano on the side if they wanted it. For us, perfection! Thanks for sharing.

This was great however the seasoning were not stirred enough so one on piece was perfect while another too strong, will have to be careful next time overall was a hit!

This recipe was amazing! I made it for a housewarming party and everyone loved it. I was asked for the recipe several times. Definitely use fresh ingredients when the recipe indicates. I love garlic so I used five large cloves instead of three.

Delicious! I will definitely make them again! Try not to put the liquid on the bread. It makes them soggy :/

Incredible.  I could even see using this as a pizza topping.  The more garlic the better.

Fabulous! I've made this several times. It is super easy and gets rave reviews. Sometimes I add cooked, chopped shrimp to the tomatoes. Once when people were eating them so fast, I got in a hurry and forgot to toast the bread first. They were a little limp. So, toast first! You won't be disappointed.

I love this recipe, we get requests to make this at every family event. To change it up I have used the fresh mozzarella bocchino (mini balls) and mixed it in with the tomates and baked it until they melted.

This bruschetta was fantastic!!  I only used 4 Roma tomatoes and cut the olive oil in half, and it turned out delicious!  I also used half of the sundried tomatoes instead and it was still tasty!  Definitely a family favorite and I will be making it again!

i thought this recipe was okay. it was a little sweet for traditional bruschetta and i dont think there was enough garlic in the recipe. next time ill reduce the sundried tomatoes and add a little more garlic. its a decent recipe, just a little too sweet.

Awesome, the basalmic gives it a great flavor. The whole party loved it on crusty french bread lightly coated in olive oil, a dash of garlic and toasted.

Best bruschetta, so stop looking. If you love fresh herbs and balsamic, you are set! Like other reviewer's have said, do not bother if you are not going to use fresh basil. Usually I am not a fan of fresh basil, but this is fantastic!

This is a great appetizer.  Everytime I make it, people request this recipe.  I sometimes add chopped up artichoke hearts and use dried sweet basil when fresh is not available.  I have forgotten to broil the baguette before cooking with the bruschetta and it doesn't seem to matter (makes it even easier).  I sprinkle with fresh grated Romano cheese.  Mangia!

This was a good recipe! Loved all the garlic in it - if you're not a garlic lover, I would recommend cutting back to two cloves or even just one. I used white balsamic vinegar instead of regular only because I prefer it. The bruschetta was interesting with the vinegar in it - added a bit of sour to the sweet tomatoes. Altogether a good recipe. I will defintely keep this to make again, perhaps for company.

This recipe was FANTASTIC.. and SO EASY.  I did make a few changes.  I added chopped Kalamata olives and substituted freshly grated Parmesan Cheese instead of Mozzarella.  I would make this recipe again FOR SURE!

My first time making bruschetta, it turned out fabulous! I made a few minor changes: decreased olive oil to 3 tbsp., vinegar to 1 tbsp. Skipped the cheese and brushed the bread with olive oil before broiling it. Very delicious and easy dinner, when paired with a salad.

My wife and I love Bruschetta and this one didn't disappoint us.  I made a double batch and put the second batch over some lettuce the next day.  The flavors had a chance to blend and tasted even better.

We love this and eat it all summer long! I just wanted to add that when fresh basil is not handy, we use Litehouse freeze-dried basil -it softens right up in the oil and tastes great!

This was ok, I made it exactly as written and for Bruschetta it was way too sweet. I think that if I tried it again I would cut the balsamic down a bit. Most of the family didn't care for them.

Wow, this was so great.  I didn't change the recipe, it was great as-is.  I mixed everything up in advance to blend.  Make sure you peel the tomatoes (you can loosen the peel quickly by pouring boiling water over the tomatoes in a bowl).  I added the basil right before serving.  I used the oil from the sun dried tomatoes and added a splash of olive oil to get to 1/4 c.  Update- I made this last night as a dip instead of a prepared app and it was great.  I toasted the bread 5 min at 350, then flipped and topped with a small handful of shredded Italian cheese blend and baked another 5- 7 min to melt/toast.  Cooled the bread then packed it to go.  Served the bruschetta cold on the side with a fork to help drain off some of the water/oil.  Put a little fork full on a prepared toasts and you have a great cold appetizer, plus nothing gets soggy!  Update again - wowza, I just used the leftovers from my last batch as a marinade/topping for chicken and it's FABULOUS!  I marinated chicken breasts in the leftovers for a couple hours, browned the chicken on a grill pan, then moved to a baking dish where I topped each breast with a portion of the bruschetta.  I baked until done, then topped with some mozzarella and parmesan and broiled to brown.  It needs salt if you are using it this way, but made a terrific chicken dish!

Didn't change any of the ingredients, and this was awesome!  The only thing I did any different was slice the mozzarella instead of using grated.  DELICIOUS!

The best Bruschetta I've ever tasted! I let it marinate  for almost 4 hours before serving, everyone at the party was fighting hand over hand to get to the tray! I toasted the bread for about 3 minutes on broil then took the pan out and added the bruschetta mixture, the cheese I added right before I took them out of the oven so it would brown slightly, I love the smell of the cheese cooking with the garlic and tomato Yumm!!!

Used a variety of fresh tomatoes and fresh herbs. Grilled sourdough and a grainy bread on grill, brushed bread with OO. Skipped Motz. Can't go wrong, is great base recipe.

I really liked this Bruschetta. However, I may cut back on the amount of Balsamic Vingegar that I put in if I ever make this again.  My husband, who typically loves Bruschetta, had one piece of this and said that he did not like it at all (which is the reason for the three stars).

Fresh out of the oven! Literally just made them seconds ago, fantastic recipe! Stop staring at the recipe and just do it already. I used sun-dried tomatoes not in oil, I just added oil and some herbs, so much cheaper I think.

I friends are begging for the recipe!  The Sundried Tomatoes are in the world foods isle of your grocery store.  I realized I was out of oil and used the oil from the tomatoes and it turned out great.  Also it makes a lot so I froze half of it and it thawed well and tasted just as good a month later!

WoW, WoWeeee!  I made this to take to a staff party and everyone just loved it.  Everyone of course asked for the recipe.  I'm telling you I could have ate the tomato ingredients just by itself and others said the same thing.  No need to search for any other bruschetta recipes because this one is by far the best I've tasted.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe Laurie!

Super good! Always turns out right even if you vary the ingredients slightly.. BUT beware of the bread getting soggy- you need to eat these right  away! Do not put on tomato topping until you are ready to serve...

I made this for Christmas. I was a little worried about using dried and fresh tomatoes, but this was wonderful. I recommend making early in the day(or night before) to give the flavors time to blend. I used grape tomatoes and removed all seeds from my fresh tomatoes. I serve with Garlic Parmesan Panetini toast.  I had guests that normally did not like tomatoes telling me how much they enjoyed it. Great recipe!

I had some french bread that I needed to use up, so what better way than to make bruschetta!  I tried putting a slice of cheese under the tomatoes, a slice on top of the tomatoes, grated on top of the tomatoes, and no cheese at all (for my lactose intolerant roommate).  They all were good! I think I liked the cheese under the tomatoes the best though. I did take out all the liquid and seeds from the tomatoes, then drizzled the left over balsamic/oil mixture over to keep them from becoming too dry, as I don't like my brushetta extremely crunchy.  I want to make this every day!!!

Love this recipes, used 1/8 cup of olive oil and the longer it sits the better it tastes! But I would use a little less garlic next time.

Great recipe. Substituted Classico Sundried Tomato Pesto for the sundried tomatoes and reduced fresh basil just a bit. In a pinch, I used used store bought frozen garlic bread, cut in 1/2 on the bias, grilled it on both sides then finished it in the oven. Huge Hit, super simple!

This was VERY good and so simple! It reminded me why I love Italian food again. The balsamic vinegar is just the thing that seperates this bruschetta from many others I've tried. The second time I made it I was trying to make it a little healthier, so I served it on whole grain cocktail bread in olive oil, and it was sooooo good! Next time, I think I'll fry baguette slices in garlic butter. I made some slight adjustments: instead of olive oil, I used pesto, and I used 4 cloves of garlic, but only because I LOVE garlic to death (I would recommend using the 3 cloves unless you want the garlic to have a strong statement). This is a very good recipe, I suggest using this one over any other recipe on this site. Better than the Italian chain-restaurant recipe!

Great recipe. I brushed the bread with olive oil and broiled as others have mentioned. Made the tomato mix the night before using canned diced tomatoes and sprinkled with 4 cheese-blend. They didn't last long  at our dinner party!

This was very flavorful.  I did do a few things differently:  I added oil from the sun dried tomatoes, used red wine vinegar (b/c I was out of basalmic) and spread a layer of pesto on the bread prior to the tomato mixture.  I also let the tomato mixtrue set overnight so the flavors could meld.  I will mike this again!  Yum!

This was delicious! The only thing I changed was to use dried basil instead of fresh (there was none to be had; I checked three stores)!  Next time I make it I'll try straining the tomato mix before putting it on the bread.  Some of the spoonfuls I used to top off the bread had too much liquid and it soaked clear through the bread!

Really good! Followed the recipe except for adding extra garlic. I think next time I will omit the oil and just leave it with the sundried tomato oil-that would've been plenty! I had extra oil left after loading up the bread so I soaked some smaller pieces of bread in it and made croutons-yummy.

Make the recipe as is !! It really works !!! To make it authentic I used ciabatta bread. Sliced it, brushed the slices of bread lightly with garlic oil, put them under the grill for a few minutes untill crisp. Top with the tomato mix and SLICES of mozzarella (couldn't get grated the first time and the sliced mozzarella turned out GREAT) Fresh Roma tomatoes give a fabulous flavour. This is a no-fail-favourite !!!!

This was great but I'm really glad I left out the oil. The oil from the sundried tomatoes in more than enough. And make sure you use bread that gets crispy in the oven, mine went soggy.

I made this for an Italian themed party last night and everyone raved about it.  Someone even said, "This is the best thing I've ever eaten!"  I did use cherry tomatoes instead of roma and those didn't take long to slice at all!  Excellent recipe!  A keeper!

Wow...this is soooooo good. I made this for a party..they were gone in a flash ! I also used chopped canned tomatoes and it was delish! I think the canned tomatoes add a bit more flavor then the fresh.

This had an excellent taste!  Although using the "good" ingredients (i.e. fresh basil, sundried tomatoes) can be a little more expensive...it is worth it. I added fresh mozz. cheese to the top- just a little was needed.  I would suggest to top your toast points right before serving as it can get soggy sitting for a bit.

I love this recipe! I had to make it for a large class (30 people) so I substituted canned diced tomatoes but no one was the wiser. Next time I make this, I'll be cutting slices of cheese to top it rather than sprinkling grated cheese. Still, all and all, delicious!

I have been making this at least once a month for 2 years now.  The only difference is that I add more garlic, I am a bit of a garlic fanatic!  This is the best bruschetta I have ever had including any restaurants.  It always gets awesome reviews at parties and I have given the recipe to several people.  THIS IS THE BEST!!!

The first time I made this recipe I thought it was incredible. The second time it was still good, just not as amazing but I haven't been able to figure out why. I would definitely recommend it because it really was delicious both times.

I made these for my husband's surprise birthday party and since I don't like tomatoes I wasn't able to try it prior to serving.  I took the risk, put them out and they were gone within minutes.  Numerous people told me it was the best bruschetta they ever had.  Based on all the rave reviews my friends gave I'm giving this recipe 5 stars.

This was awesome!!! I made it for a dinner party last night and every bit of it was gone in about an hour.I toasted the baguette then sat it on the side of trey w/a bowl of the bruschetta in the middle. So they could spoon out their own. No cheese is needed! They loved it! My only recommendation is to start early chopping everything-it made me a little late for the party.But it was worth it! It's a Keeper!:)

Best bruschetta ever!  Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly!  I ended up with a lot of the tomato mixture left over and it was yummy straight from the bowl!

My family RAVED about this recipe. We will be using this again! Followed the recipe exactly, using very juicy tomatoes and the sun-dried tomatoes in oil. Use slices of mozzarella cheese in the last 2 minutes of broiling to just get it melted enough. The juices were held inside by the cheese and squeezed out when you bit into it. AMAZING! I would give this six stars if I could!

This was delicious!  I made it for a work potluck, so I prepared everything the night before, then heated up the bread and added the “toppings” the next day.  I'm sure it would have been better if I had been able to eat it immediately, but it was still very good.  I definitely recommend brushing olive oil on the bread before putting it in the oven - this made the bread soft and full of flavor.  I also followed the other recommendations regarding oil packed tomatoes and fresh ingredients - that really made the difference!

WOW!! This was really good. I did not have sundried tomatoes so just used vine ripe tomatoes and it was so so good.  My hubby kept eating the tomatoes out of the bowl I was marinading them in. Very good...going to make more tonight.

I made this for a dinner party and it went so fast that if I hadn't tasted it before hand, I never would have gotten any!  I omitted the sun-dried tomatoes and just used extra romas, and substituted parm for the mozzarella, toasted breads slightly before serving then added mixture to the top and skipped broiling to keep them from getting soggy. D-lish!  Will be a great hit with any crowd!  I would recommend making it a few hours before hand to allow all the flavors to blend.

GREAT flavor! Will definatley make again. Next time I will us a little less oil and vinegar. My husband and I ate these up fast and the bread was already sopping up the liquid getting and getting soggy. Other wise Really, really, good. I will be making this for any party I host/attend. Also, I always add extra garlic to everything but with the balsamic vinegar you don't need to. This recipe actually called for enough garlic. Yum!

This works everytime!  It's simpe to make, and tastes soooo good.  A favorite recipe for me.  One thing I like to do is put the sliced bread under the broiler first, then add the toppings and put it under again.  I like it crispier, rather than soggy.  I have also not even had the chance to use fresh basil on this recipe, only dried and it is incredible.  I'm sure with fresh it will be that much better!!!

This was a wonderful recipe. I did leave out the sundried tomatoes, did not have them on hand cuz I really don't like them. I was lucky enough to be able to use tomatoes and basil from my garden, good timing! It came out perfect and I got rave reveiws from my dinner guests. Thanks Laurie! This one is a keeper.

I did this as a cold appetizer for a party I went to.  Instead of mozz cheese, I added finely chopped parmesean.  I also added fresh oregano. Use only fresh herbs!  I ended up putting bruschetta in a bowl and pre slicing the bread.  They served themselves.  Yummy!

I used fresh tomatoes, basil, and oregano from the garden.  I used a whole baguette cut in half and brushed with olive oil.  I added some cheese on the bottom then the topping and grilled the baguette half and sliced to serve.

Delicious! I've made this bruschetta so many times I've lost count. I use 2 cans of drained diced tomatoes in place of the romas, 1 tbsp olive oil, and add a bit of dried oregano and garlic salt to the mix. To crisp up the toast, I use cooking spray, sprinkle a bit of parmesan and then garlic salt. This recipe would be wonderful even without the little tweaks. I've made this with jarred basil once or twice and it was still very yummy. I highly recommend this recipe!

Best bruschetta ever.  Only suggestion would be to add just a capful more of balsamic vinegar.  Gives it just a little bit more of a kick.  Cannot beat this recipe!

This is one of the best things I've ever made!  The sun-dried tomatoes really give it an interesting twist and the balsamic vinegar brings it all togheter.  My very picky husband even loved it.  He wanted to eat the topping with a spoon!

A little lemon juice to make the basil pop and my cheese preference with balsmic vinegar is parmesan.

we made this for a teenage group party and they couldn't stop raving about the "tomato bread!" it was fun and easy. instead of using roma tomatoes, we used grape tomatoes, since i had bought an excess. they added great flavor and color. if you're not used to broiling (like me) keep an eye on the bread slices the whole time! they can burn really quickly. thank you for a great appetizer that's both eye-catching and kid-friendly!

I don;t get why this recipe is getting such amazing reviews, I did not care for the flavor. My mom liked it better than I did, which is the only reason I am giving it a 3 instead of a 2.

Good recipe, I caution not to cook the tomatoes when you are attempting to melt the cheese and i used slightly less vinegar then the recipe calls for.

Great recipe for Bruschetta - but having just come back from living in Tuscany for a few months I wanted to make mine a bit more traditional. Definately use sundried tomatoes packing in oil, tates way better. also double garlic and reduce the oil a bit (because i toast the crostini with oil on it before adding bruschetta you get the extra oil taste) and use HIGH QUALITY olive oil!!! Also i added a dash of dried oregano (not too much) and a little extra fresh basil from my garden. The traditional way is not hot at all, and the cheese is not melted, so i used a ball of fresh ovaline mozzerella i cute into small chunks and also a dash or parmesan. GREAT and DELICIOUS!

My husband loves this recipe and says it's his favorite bruschetta. I usually do not put in the sun dried tomatos and another roma tomato or 2 instead. The hubby does not like the texture of the sun dried tomatos. Because we really like garlic, I will often toast the bread, rub a clove of garlic before adding the bruschetta mixture and popping it back in the oven.

This was awesome!  I used 10 Roma/Plum tomatoes instead of 6 just because there seemed to be too much basil.  Also, I did not melt the cheese, but instead served the bruschetta chilled with the cheese on top of the toasted baguettes.  I brought this to a BBQ and there was none left and everyone loved it!  Thank you!!!  I will definitely make this again.

So, so good.  Used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, and white vinegar instead of balsamic.  Such a fresh taste.  Put together, looks professional and yet, it was so easy to make.  Will use this recipe again and again.  Next time I may try putting over macaroni.

This recipe was AWESOME!! I have made this 3 times now and I believe that fresh romas and basil are a MUST. Each time I made this I used 8 romas and I question people saying that the canned tomatoes are more economical. It only costed me about $2.38 for 8 of the roma tomatoes. I don't know how much more cheap you can get than that:)  I only used 2 tbsp of olive oil and did not use any of the sun-dried tomatoes. This is my husbands new favorite food.....he can't get enough!!!

I let the tomato mix set for about 4 hours. My bread got burnt the first time so you have to watch it closely - but then again, I've never used the broil setting before! Once I got it figured out  the recipe was great! These are best fresh, I let them sit for a couple hours - they were still good but soggy instead of crunchy. So don't make them in advance! Thanks for the great recipe! I usually don't like bruschetta but I really love these!

This appetizer is the best!!! I have made it for several friends that have come over and they all really like it. It takes a little longer than 15 minutes to prepare though if you are cutting all your tomatoes up. Next time I make it I will try the canned tomatoes like the reviews say...

This is a great recipe.  I've made it many times for my wife, as she always requests this.  She always asks me to make this when we need to provide appetizers for family meals.  I can make it quick, and if I don't use all of the mixture, I will put in the refrigerator and use the next night as a snack!

Fantastic!  I just served the Bruschetta in a bowl, allowing guests to pile it atop simple crostini, and they loved it.

Easy, tastes wonderful, you can make it ahead, and feeds a lot of people for not much money. Oh did I say it tastes great!?!  Followed recipe to a T.  My only change was brushing the bread with some olive oil, toasting, flip, brush, toast 1-2 minutes then add Bruschetta, then fresh slices of Mozarella - broil.    You could easily use 2 lfs. bread and a huge ball of fresh Moz. to slice. I made this the night before the S.B and it did not get mushy.  We heated up the left overs the next night and had over pasta.  This is a keeper for so many different reasons! Cheers!

Great recipe.  Made this to top herb-rubbed grilled chicken.  The only change made to the original recipe was replacing the bread with grilled chicken breast.  Delicious!

Fantastic! I followed the recipe as provided with one exception - I broiled the french bread with only the mozzarella, and allowed my guests to add the bruschetta themselves.  This was - hands down - the best bruschetta I have ever eaten.  My guests argued over who could take left overs home and this one is going in my all-time favorites!

This was fabulous.  I have never made bruschetta before but have had it many times, and I have to say this was the best I have ever had.  I made only slight modifications to make it less fattening.  I only used about 3T of olive oil, only used about 1 1/2T of the vinegar, and because I was taking this to a party I toasted the bread ahead of time and skipped the cheese on top since it would have been inconvenient to use the oven.  I also put it on sliced cucumbers and rounds of jicama that I had cut out with a cookie cutter and that worked well too, especially the jicama. YUM!

This is definitely the best I've had! I marinated for about 20-30 min. then took the bread & bruschetta to the party. I drizzled the bread slices in EVOO then sprinkled the cheese on top. Broiled it until bubbly & served the slices on the side of the bruschetta. Rave reviews! I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes as recommended by another reviewer since our Romas were bad. Everything was fresh!

It was a huge hit. I didn't haven't sun-dried tomatoes so I just added a little sugar like a previous reviewer did. Everyone loved it. I used Cibatta bread instead of a regular baguette.

Absolutely delicious.  I leave out sun dried tomatoes because I don't like them.  It's good with or without cheese on top and sometimes I serve it on untoasted baguette.

Awesome recipe, make sure you follow the baking directions as they say or the bread will start to brown way too much. The family loved them and the topping was amazing. I even used the left over topping on top of the salmon cakes I made as the main course to this meal and it was very good!

I made this for a New Years Eve party and it went like flap jacks!  Next time I think I will use dried basil instead of fresh.  It seemed like not everyone got basil on their bites.  Also next time I think I will leave out the sun dried tomatoes.  I am not a fan.  Also use a spoon with slits on it to scoop your tomato mix onto the bread.  Some pieces felt too wet, even after broiling.

Wow! The combination of flavors - from the fresh basil, to the almost tart sundried tomatoes, to the bite of the balsamic vinegar - makes this bruschtta wonderful. I found myself eating it out of the bowl before I cooked it!

This was very very good. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars, it because I reserve that for recipes I absolutely fall over for. But this was great, no doubt about it. Very different from traditional bruschetta.

Fantastic! I made a couple minor changes - I used a loaf of french bread instead of a baguette. I also brushed the bread with olive oil before baking at 400F for 7 minutes. For the topping I had to use dried basil because we have limited access to fresh herbs where we live. I bet it's even better with fresh basil though! Excellent flavor, will definitely make again.

Delicious! My entire family loved this recipe! I followed it exactly as it says, and used fresh basil. Next time I will add some oregano as well and lessen the amount of oil. Will follow advice of other reviewer and buy bulk cheese and lay one slice over each piece of bread. The shredded was kind of annoying, as it was falling off the bread as I was putting it on. Over all, YUMMY!!

WOW! This was AMAZING! I made it for New Year's Eve and will definitely be making again.  Since I had to transport it, I made it into more of a dip (skipped the Mozzarella and added a Parmesan/Italian blend cheese right into the mixture).  And definitely go FRESH with all your ingredients...MMM, MMM GOOD!

I make this when we crave a lighter meal.  It has excellent flavor and there's no need to deviate from the original recipe.  I have, however, made it without sun dried tomatoes and it's just as good.

I have made this recipe for years with many veriations. My favorite is cutting up a fresh mozzarella ball into small pieces and adding to the mixture. Refrigerate and serve cold over the toasted bread of your choice.

I never made Bruschetta before and after making this recipe, I will make it again, it wasn't that hard, but came out great.  One big thing is making sure to baste the bread with olive oil when you first put it in the oven.  It was really good using Mozzarella strips, instead of shredded cheese.

This Bruschetta is very flavorful and easy to make.  Everyone on Christmas Eve raved about how good it was.  I didn't use all of the tomato mix on Christams Eve so I put it in a tubberware container and used it two days later and it was still absolutely delicious.

I brought these to two holiday parties and they were a hit at both and the first to disappear in a sea of other potluck items on the table. They're definitely more of an adult food, I couldn't fool the kids with "they're just like mini pizzas." The teens said there were too many tomatoes, but the adults loved them.

This is the BEST bruschetta I have ever had! Everyone asks for the recipe every time I make it or else it is always requested at parties. The only thing I do different is to slice a brick of mozzarella cheese and put slices on the top of the mixture, it's less mess and also creates a little "blanket" to keep the mix on the bread. So Yummy!!

Oh so yummy! Well my family never uses the broiler...so the first batch got completely burnt when we were supposed to be browning them, but hey burnt ones tasted good too, the second batch we were a little paranoid after burning the other ones, so we'd take them out every other minute. They were really good. Though we didn't have fresh basil, so we used dry basil, 1/4 cup of basil seemed too much, so I just eye ball'd it. They were really yummy. Nothing bad to say.

I thought this was very yummy.  The sun dried tomatoes really add that extra something!  I used dried basil and it was still good and I didn't toast my bread before putting the stuff on top.

This bruschetta recipe is my favorite (and all of my friends).  I add extra basil and extra garlic.  Quick tip, if you buy a chop wizard, the tomatoes will be cut in seconds rather than 10 minutes.  I can whip up this recipe in less than 10 minutes and I know it by heart!

Made this one as a snack for me and my siblings, I can see myself making this during the holiday season as an appetizer. I made servings for 3 and I used two cloves of garlic, I would definitley add in more then called for! I also added in onion. And btw I barely added any cheese, just a teeny pinch but it really isn't needed at all imo. Good Stuff.

I made this recipe for my bridal shower and served it, minus the cheese, on pita chips. It was an easy, no fuss addition to my "tea party" and the girls loved it! I'm making it for a Christmas party tomorrow, again minus the cheese, and I know it will be a hit. (I can't eat cheese, and not having cheese doesn't ruin the beauty of this recipe at all.)

The PERFECT recipe for an appetizer. I was able to do this simultaneously while making my pasta and chicken parmesan. Great blend of flavors, especially if you like balsalmic vinegar. I tried adding artichoke hearts to some of the bruschetta pieces I made. Not bad either!

This is probably one of the best bruschetta you'll ever have. I didn't have Mozarella on hand, so I substituted with 4 cheese Mexican blend and it gate this an awesome kick. It was so good I think I will continue to make it with the Mexican 4-cheese blend going forward.

This makes a very good bruschetta.  The plum tomatoes at the market were anemic, so I used a can of diced tomatoes (drained).  Otherwise, I went with the recipe.  Every time I make this, people go crazy for it.

This is hands down the best Tomato Bruschetta ever!!!  I make this all the time.  Family and friends always rave when I make it.  However I don't bake it, I just serve it right from the bowl with good crusty bread on the side.

This is really tasty. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it kind of made the bread soggy so next time I will not put all the juice on it. It was really yummy though!

I love the flavor in this recipe. The guests all loved it, but I would definitely cut back the olive oil. I'm going to try it again, but with less oil and I'm sure it will come out perfect. The fresh basil really adds some great flavors.

Excellent recipe!  A few additional suggestions:
1) Toast bread on BOTH sides
2) a bit of fried bacon added would further enhance this excellent recipe.  3) I used dried tomatoes and they worked as well as dried tomatoes in oil.

Very tasty recipe, used dry sun dried tomatoes because they were more affordable and still turned out great. Be careful with the broiler, the baguette was a little too toasty.

This bruschetta is very good! I don't always like bruschetta, but this recipe is very good. The oils taste great as well as the sun dried tomatoes. I like my mixture sit over night to really absorb the flavors. My guests said it was the best they had ever had!

I made this exactly as is and it was delicious!  The balsamic vinegar gives it a little kick which I love!

This was wonderful.  I didn't use the sundried tomatoes, but the results were still great.  I used half as much olive oil.  I also let the tomato mixture marrinade for about eight hours before I prepared the baguette which really made the taste stand out. I personally thought the taste was even better the next day.  I also found that baking the bread slices brushed with a little olive oil or garlic butter first ensured that I had bread that was crisper and didn't soggy once I added the tomato mixture.  I added one extra step, I canned the bruschetta mixture.  I added the mixture to clean sterile jelly jars and then gave the jars a 15 minute hot water bath.  This mixture was so good that I wanted to preserve the taste of fresh home grown tomatoes because during the winter months the fruits and vegetables just don't taste as good, so this was a good way to preserve the taste.

Serious Bruschetta! Cut the bread on a diagonal so it is easier to bite into. Also added a thin layer of pesto sauce to the tosted bread. Next time will add shrimp for a twist. Great recipe.

This recipe was awesome.  I used fresh tomatoes out of our garden instead of the roma.  I peeled them first and then squeezed out most of the juice and seeds.

Great flavors.  I used suggestion of others to brush bread with olive oil when first broiling.  Next time I will cut down on the olive oil in the recipe.

Very delicious. Turns out great even with modifications. Used 3 different types of heirloom tomatoes, did not use any sun-dried or cheese. Pulsed everything in processor (be careful so it doesn't liquefy!)dumped it in a bowl and served it with toasted baguette slices. Make sure you process the garlic and basil first, to mince them, before adding the rest of the ingredients

I love this recipe, and have made it many times.  I regular tomatoes instead of roma, skip the sun dried tomatoes altogether and use either mozzarella or a sprinkle of parmesian. It is always a hit when entertaining!

This was amazing!  Make lots- it's great to snack on for days.  We used sliced mozzarella and followed the recipe exactly.  I was really glad I splurged on the fresh basil- it really added to the flavor.  YUM!

I have made this several times and it is so good!  I usually use the slices of cheese for the top because it seems to stay on better.  I have used the baguette and have also bought frozen garlic bread...both are equally good!  Excellent recipe!

I forgot the cheese, so I just left it off.  I think it would be better without it.  I made it as an appetizer for guests, and everyone raved about it. I snacked on it for a couple days afterward.  Thank you so much for this great recipe!

fantastic recipe. Used regular (on the vine) tomatoes, as I couldn't find romas. Made enough for 2 baguettes. Used 1/2 the recipe the next day and was still great. I brushed olive oil on the baguette slices and broiled for a few minutes (on both sides) before putting on the bruschetta mixture.

This went over very well at a get-together we had.  Everyone really loved this appetizer.  I did as others suggested and broiled the bread for a few minutes prior to putting on the mixture.  It turned out great.  Thanks!

Unbelievably good.  Best Bruschetta I have had yet.  I made it as an appetizer to tide us over while I cooked the main course.  It went over very well.

WOW! An absolutely wonderful recipe! I made some adjustments to fit our family's palate. We LOVE garlic so I added a TON more along with extra basil. I used Campari tomatoes too. I always get rave reviews on this!

This recipe was amazing; we got rave reviews from everyone at a BBQ I prepared it for. The tomato- basil mixture was a fantastic base and tasted wonderful cold, eaten like a salad even before it was cooked. Will definitely make this recipe again.

Really good recipe.  I make this all the time and always disappears very quickly.  The only change I make is to top it with fresh grated parmesan instead of the mozzarella cheese.

Quite a hit!  I made the tomatoe mixture the evening before and only added 1 T. balsamic (per p.p. suggestions) and it was perfect!  Final assemble was very easy, simply brushed bread with olive oil, broiled for 1.5 minutes and then back in broiler w/tomatoes and cheese for another 1.5 minutes...Thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty! Pre-made the tomato mixture a day before, stunk up the whole fridge, but was worth it! Only added one clove of garlic and used sliced mozzarella.

One of the best bruschetta's I've had.  I made homemade french bread and it all came out wonderful.  My husband took the extra fixings to work and assembled it there then toasted it in their toaster oven to rave reviews.  Thanks!

Really good! I halved the oil and it worked out well. I tried using tomato slices and also chopped tomatoes. My vote is for the chopped. Definitely brush the bread with olive oil and put it in the broiler before adding the tomato mixture. I will make again for sure.

I make this frequently.  I cut up the sun-drieds before tossing them in, and I haven't used fresh basil yet.  I've had it with different cheeses on top, broiled on bread, or spooned fresh from a bowl.  All of it is terrific.  Thanks.

I served this at a get together with friends and everyone LOVED it!  I used bulk mozzarella instead of shredded and let the mixture marinate overnight and also brushed the bread with olive oil and baked at 400 for a couple minutes before adding the topping.  I had some of the mixture left over and used it a couple days later and it was still great.

Perfect bruschetta recipe!  I did as other reviewers adviced and brushed the bread lightly with olive oil and cooked them for 5 minutes at 400 before adding the topping.  I also added some grated asiago to the cheese topping - just because I LOVE asiago!  The asiago gave it a really interesting and subtle bite.  In addition I added some finely chopped sweet onion to the tomato mixture. The recipe is perfect as is, but I tried the additions on my second time making of it, and I think the changes amped up my personal taste yum factor.

This recipe was so yummy! I made this for a party and every piece was gone within 20 minutes!! The only substitution I made was to use a 4 cheese blend. I had multiple people ask for this recipe--absolutely delicious!

Wow.  Best bruschetta ever.  I didn't add the mozzarella,  just toasted the baguettes and rubbed with garlic.  Definately a keeper.

I do not typically care for this type of thing, but really liked this recipe. I did make it early in the morning and let it sit in the fridge all day to combine the flavors. Also, I did not bake the bread first, just put the topping on, and then I did use sliced pieces of mozzarella as opposed to the shredded. Turned out great. Just watch it like a hawk when in the broiler...it bakes super fast.

An excellent recipe.  Can't wait to try these with summmer-ripe tomatoes.  I used a mix of red and yellow romas and it was wonderful.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Mmm!  I made this fresh (no baking) to eat piled on "roasted garlic bagel crisps."  It was delicious after only 15 minutes of marinating.  I love my bruschetta with plenty of "bite," so I added an additional teaspoon of balsamic vinegar for extra kick.  The delicious aroma of garlic and basil is absolutely fantastic, and the colors make it stunning, too.  I'll be making this for a potluck the first chance I get!

Absolutely delicious, a big hit.  I had a hard time finding the sun dried tomatoes, so I skipped  them and it worked fine without them.

Tried it two ways- with the cheese and without.  Both are a hit!  I've made it 4 times in the past two weeks and it has disappeared every time!  I did follow others' advice and only added a bit of olive oil.  A keeper!

This bruschetta was delicious. I toasted the baguettes with a little mozzarella cheese first and then spooned over the bruschetta. I also added some onions to the mix, used sun dried tomatoes without oil because my store was out of the other and dried basil (got home without fresh.)I thought I would be disappointed without fresh, but it was really good! Will definitely make this again!

AMAZING BRUSCHETTA! I make Bruschetta all the time for my family and decided to try a new recipe. This was a huge hit. They said the flavor was amazing and the sun-dried tomatoes gave it a kick. Wonderful recipe. We had it with salad and it made a great dinner!

Awesome!  I only had a sun-dried tomatoe paste at home so I used that...only need about 1/4 of what is called for if you use paste instead of actual sun-dried tomatoes.

This recipe is fantastic!  I didn't change a thing (well, I did add some chopped fresh parsley), and everyone scarfed them up.  I don't usually like sun-dried tomatoes and debated leaving them out, but they really do add a lot of great flavor without tasting exactly like sun-dried tomatoes.  Delicious!

My first try at bruschetta- I followed the recipe as is, except I may have added a bit more oil and basalmic (i didn't really measure!). I took this to my best friend's house- she is a bruschetta FREAK- and she proclaimed it was the best she has ever had!!! I did put thick slices of fresh mozzarella on the slightly toasted bread before loading it up- JUST A SUPER RECIPE!!! We soaked up the leftover sauce on the plate with more bread!!!

I omitted the sundried tomatoes and the mozarella cheese and stuck with just the fresh ingredients room temp atop the toasted bread slices. Husband and I ate this up! When done this way, it's VERY close the the Stonewood restaurant's bruschetta recipe. Healthy and YUMMY!

I cut up fresh mozz. and added it to the bruschetta mix and let that sit for about 2 hours. Doubled the balsamic for a kick. Amazing!  My guests were thrilled.  The Fresh Mozz got just melty enough under the broiler.  Very tasty!

Best Bruschetta I have tasted.  Came out perfect and was absolutely delish.  Better than the restaurants I have tasted.  I put a bit of olive oil on the bread before broiling the first time.  Otherwise, didn't change or add a thing.

This was absolutely fabulous.  The only change I made was that I used slices of whole mozzarella instead of the shredded and like some others said it did hold the tomatoes in place.

This appetizer was delicious and a hit at Christmas Eve. I followed some peoples suggestions by dipping the bread in the contents that were marinated over night and as the bread and cheese broiled, poured the contents ontop for a fresh taste. Everyone wanted the recipie after tasting it...Thanks!

Well the recipe was for 12 servings, but 4 in my family polished the whole batch in one siting.  They thought it was wonderful and raved about it and kept asking if there were any left.  

We like it best when I brushed the slices with the excess olive oil mixture and then sprinkled with the grated cheese and then toasted them, butting the tomatoe mixture on top.  The slices were a little soft/mushy toasting them with everything on top.  I processed the fresh basil, basmalic vinegar and garlic in a small chopper before mixing with the other ingredients. The baguette was pretty small and it was a little time consuming brushing the tops, then putting the mixture and the cheese.  I wonder if it would work with a larger diameter loaf of bread or even with a small sourdough loaf.

I will admit one thing first - I don't like Bruschetta, but my husband and family do so I made this for Christmas dinner yesterday.  Everyone raved about it and even though I didn't have any - I will certainly make this again.  Easy and def. a huge crowd pleaser.  A single batch did well for the 23 people that were here, but I will double it in the future.

Delicious!

Like another reviewer, I would suggest adding oregano and [a lot] more garlic...but that's according to your tastes, I guess :) I also chopped up the mozzarella into little pieces and put it in the mix, instead of sprinkling it on top.

Anyway, got the stamp of approval from my very Italian family! They loved it!

i give this five stars not only for tastiness, but also because it is extremely easy and quick to make. I topped each individual bruschette toast with a small mozzarella ball that was marinated in basil and olive oil, and broiled for 5 min until melted. The presentation was very nice as well!!

This recipe was such a hit at my party.  I added a little bit more garlic (we love garlic) and made sure that everything was diced very small.  I will definately make this often.

Definitely one of the best bruschettas I've had. I agree with the other reviewers in that the olive oil helps. Also, the sliced mozarrella gives it a better presentation.

This was so good! I've made this a few times now. The only difference is I dont use the cheez at all, and serve the bread toasted on the side, and the tomato mixure in a bowl w/ a spoon to top bread. Always RAVE reviews!

This is a fabulous recipe. Very easy to prepare. Since I'm not a big fan of sun-dried tomatoes, I did not use them but the result was still awesome.
I would recommend insisting on fresh parsley and fresh baked bread, as I think they make a big difference.

This is the best I have ever had! Well worth the chopping. Don't look any further. I would cut back on the oil next time. Doesn't seem necessary, but flavor is perfect! No tweaks needed!

I've made this very quick and easy appetizer several times and it is always a huge hit..never any left!! I think another reviewer mentioned this change as well....I switched the mozzerella to Feta and got rave reviews.  This is a great recipe because I usually have the ingredients around the house,  especially in the summer when our garden is churning out roma tomatoes.  Fresh basil is a must so plant a small plant and make this recipe a staple of your appetizer recipe box.

This was quite a hit at our halloween party. I followed some previous advice and left the bruschetta separate so that people could put the amount they want and that seemed to be a good idea. Flavors were so fresh and yummy!

The tomato mix for this bruschetta is out of this world.  I used one of the other suggestions from the review and toasted the bread with the cheese seperate so everyone could get the amount of tomato that they wanted.  Excellent recipe!!

Absolutely Scrumptious!!!  Sceptical at first about the sun-dried tomatoes, I tried this recipe for a large dinner party.  It was a hit!  I've used this recipe time and time again- it is absolutely the most tasty bruschetta I've ever had.  To cut down on the grease, I try removing most of the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes and it still tastes excellent.  This is definately a recipe I will be using for years to come...

I made this for an Italian themed baby-shower. I tripled the recipe, letting everything marinate overnight and cut the bread and broiled about 20 min before guests got there. It was very good both warm and at room temp...the guests loved it.

Too much basil I think. It was pretty strong for our taste. I cut the amount of olive oil to 2 tbsp. and that was plenty. Will make this again, but next time I will saute the garlic in the oil a bit and but back on the amount of basil.

I had a lot of people ask for this recipe the night I made it.  The only changes that I made is that I didn't put the mozzerella cheese on top, instead I put grated Parmesan cheese inside the tomato mixture.  Also, I didn't serve the tomatoes on top of the bread because I was afraid it would get soggy, so I just served it side by side.  Very good!

This was hands down the best bruschetta that I have ever had!  It was so simple to make but the results were amazing.  I made the topping about 4 hours before a party I was hosting and then right before my guests arrived I spooned the topping onto the bread, added some cheese, and popped them into a 350 degree oven for a few minutes just to melt the cheese.  They were all gone within 10 minutes of putting them on the tray and everyone asked for the recipe.  This is a very simple appetizer that tastes and looks very elegant!  A great addition to your next party!

This did make a delicious bruschetta, but next time I will try using 4 Roma tomatoes as there seemed to be more topping than the bread could really handle. The balsamic vinegar, especially, gives this recipe a nice kick without sacrificing the well-balanced flavor.

Amazing Amazing Amazing Bruschetta! This recipe is easy, delicious, and sure to please! You can make a meal out of these! I like to add a little more garlic, it really seems to be the kind of recipe that you add a little more or less of the ingredients and it will always taste great! Also, I like to let it sit for at least an hour or so to let the flavors really blend. Yum Yum! People won't believe it's homemade!

Excellent--made it for a party and everyone loved it.  I went a little easy on the balsamic but other than that, didn't change a thing.

Mmm.. this was scrumptious. I kept putting off this recipe, but finally I made it! I used the amount of ingredients as instructed, but I still have a leftover for the tomato mixture. Unfortunately, I bought french bread, not a baguette. So it was much harder to get the correct slices. This was a simple recipe and I will make sure to make it when we have lots of guests over. The crisp bread, mixture and mozerrella all tasted wonderful together.

These were definitely good.  I did do some slight alterations, I added more garlic and toasted the bread with some olive oil.  I let it sit out for a while so the mixture could soak up some more flavor.

We loved this recipie, including my son who doesn't particularly like fresh tomato.  With the oil from the sun-dried tomatos and the olive oil, it was a bit too oily and I intend to cut back on the olive oil the next time I make it.

Bruschetta does not get much better than this.  I served it on top of some fresh italian bread that I had made earlier and my little kids and husband devoured 2 loaves with dinner.  Although there was plenty of leftovers from the dinner, there was nothing left of this.

I hate to give this recipe a just 'ok', since it's gotten so many other good reviews, first of all, this recipe made a LOT of bruschetta mix, a LOT more than I ended up using up, so a lot of it went to waste, next time, if I make it again, I will cut it in half.  I followed exactly as stated.  It was 'ok', nothing fabulous, and I may not make it again.  I found that it hardened right away when sitting outside, which is not great when you're entertaining.

Wow, this was fantastic! I made my own French bread which definitely helped.  I think letting it sit in the fridge really brought out the taste. I didn't have sun dried ones, so I used more of mine from our garden. I did brush them with a tiny bit of olive oil and put the topping in the bowl for the guests. A lot of bruschettas don't always have cheese on them, so I left it off and it was fine. I'm not big on tomatoes, but this is one great way to eat them. This is a good summer appetizer I will be making again soon. Thanks a ton!
By the way, I used some of the tomatoes in an omelette for my mom and reserved the olive oil/balsamic vinegar part for salad dressing-yum!

Second review n stilll cant believe wat a hit it is.. n if u replace the baguette for six grain bread cut into halves n leave out the oil soaked sun-dried tomatoes, every ingredient is good for health.. tats wat i just love. since garlic is uncooked, it has very active cancer preventing elements. Hows tat !

Delicious.  Made exactly as written except I used orange & yellow cherry tomatoes.  You could use a lot less oil and it would still be excellent.

One of the best bruschettas I have ever tasted!  The only negative is that we found the baguette pieces to be too hard, maybe next time try a softer bread to go with this delicious treat

My friends and I loved this. I put the mozzarella cheese on the slices of bread and melted it in the oven for about 8 minutes. I put the tomato mixture on it after I took it out of the oven. I used only about 1/8 cup or more of oil, but that was still too much. Even my sister who doesn't like cheese asked me to make more.

Canned sun-dried tomatoes in oil were a little hard to find and very expensive (nearly $5) but they make a BIG difference in the recipe. I had no mozzarella but substituted fresh grated parmesan the first time I made this, and loved the flavor so much that the second time I combined mozzarella and parmesan. This is the best bruschetta I have ever tasted, including in restaurants. Thank you, Loll, for sharing this great recipe!

This turned out wonderfully! I put cheese on the bread before adding tomato mixture and after as well.  Great flavor.

I make this all the time and it's great.  I only use fresh basil and I substitute the mozarella cheese for feta cheese.

I have honestly never really cared for tomatoes, however, I made this recipe for my boyfriend and we both loved it!!  A little too much garlic, but I'll tone it down next time.  Thanks!!

What a great bruschetta recipe.  Exactly what I expected.  I made it the day before and let the juices develop overnight.  No need to change any part of this perfect recipe.

This is the best bruschetta recipe I've found.  Its very simple and its easy to double if necessary.  I've experimented using different kinds of cheese (feta) for a slight change.

I come from a typical Chinese family in sunny Singapore where balsamic vinegar is unheard of. After reading the reviews, I decided to invest in a bottle, and boy, I sure didn't regret it! Though I meant to reduce the amount after reading some reviews, I accidentally tipped too much of it, yet it turned out ok. I also couldn't find sun-dried tomatoes, so i used more normal ones. My boyfren, who's a tomato lover, couldn't get enough of it. When I told him he had betta help me finish up the entire bottle of vinegar, it was obvious he was more than happy to!

Simple and Superb! I left out the sun-dried tomatoes but added one finely-chopped red onion. This recipe is fragrant, delicious and so easy. It made a big impression!

A nice change from a traditional bruschetta. I actually prefer to use dried basil instead of fresh. I think the flavor is more evenly spread. Use your kitchen shears for cutting those sun-dried tomatoes. Sometimes this ends up a bit soggy, but it is always a crowd-pleaser.

This is fantastic!  Thank you for sharing!  I made this New Year's Eve for our family get-together, and it was to die for.  The sun-dried tomatoes really added a lot of flavor.  I also threw in a couple cloves of minced garlic.  We also made the Marinated Cheese on this site, and we used some of the marinade from that recipe to brush the bread with before toasting.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

We save this for fresh tomato season.  I don't always have sun-dried tomatoes on hand, but either way this is great.

Made this for a Christmas party and it was a huge hit!  As soon as I unwrapped the platter, it became the "to try" appetizer and the positive comments lasted well into the evening, longer than the bruschetta! Since the group was large, I doubled the batch but otherwise made it as indicated.  Fresh basil is absolutely the way to go.  Will definitely make this again, yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this recipe! I thought the vinegar was a little overpowering, so I now use 1/2 of what's called for and it's perfect for us.
