The cake part was great but decided to make my own filling and frosting, from reading the other reviews.  I whipped up a half pint of whipping cream and set it aside.  Then I beat 4 oz of cream cheese with 1/2 cup powdered sugar.  Then I folded the cream cheese mixture and whipped cream together.  To that, I added some well drained finely chopped peaches.  I assembled the cake and then frosted the top and sides with the whipped cream cream cheese frosting recipe from this site, and added some yellow and red food coloring to give it a peach tint.  I added some peaches to the top of the cake after I had chilled the cake for quite some time, right before serving, so they wouldn't slide off!  Thanks for the recipe, though, you gave me some great ideas!

the cake was a hit but the icing was a disaster.  i decided to add 8 ounces of cool whip to the mixture to make it stay on the sides of the cake but it still wasn't enough.  i think next time i will use only half the milk called for.

The cake was great! Although, the recipe for the icing should be revised to only 1/8 cup of milk, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp of vanilla. I actually re-made the icing because i knew the cake would slide!

Everyone loved it. Icing if made by the recipe is too runny as others have said. Next time I will try 1/4c of milk. So if you are making this for the 1st time - gradually add your milk and test it, because you won't need the full amount.

I found this recipe while searching for a way to use some leftover sour cream. When I saw how thick the batter was, I was afraid the cake would be dry.  Wow, was I wrong!  Very moist and easy to work with. I did not use the frosting/filling recipe. I made my own combination cream cheese/buttercream recipe to use the half pack of cream cheese that I had leftover. It was a good combination and I intend to make it again.

This cake was YUMMY!  I made it for a birthday party, using fresh peaches, and the crowd went wild!  Very easy to make with its straight forward recipe.

The cake itself was delicious, but I followed what others said and only used about 1/8 cup milk.  The icing was still somewhat runny, but I stuck it in the fridge and it hardened somewhat.  I think when I make it again, I'll use even less milk.

The cake tasted very good but the icing was pure liquid. I should have read the reviews before I made it. I will make it again, this time I will make my own icing. I wouldn't slice the cakes either, just put the peaches in between the layers.

This cake was so YUMMY!!!!  My kids loved the frosting.  One thing I think I would do different is I would make the frosting while the cake is cooking so it has a chance to harden.  The frosting was a little running.

The cake was AMAZING!!!  My only problem is the same as everyone else said...the icing was so runny.  I did what a few said and only used a 1/4 cup milk but that was still way too much.

This has been a favorite everytime I make it, and it's so easy to make!  Icing will harden a little more as it sits, but is great!

Just a regular cake with what what would have been very runny icing had I not drained the peaches well, reserved the juice, and used that in the cake, and only used half the peaches on the cake (the rest chopped and thrown into the batter). As written, this recipe just doesn't do it. I expect there to be peaches in the cake batter, not just the icing.

What a delicious cake! I substituted the french vanilla cake mix with white cake mix. I also used only 1/8 cup of milk for the frosting because it would have been too runny if not. I used fresh peaches instead of canned and it turned out delicious. One of my favorite cakes I've made!

This cake is absolutely delicious!  However the icing would be way to thin if you use the 1/2 cup milk listed in the recipe (hence only 4 stars..) I used the advice of other reviews and cut the milk down to 1/8 cup (2 Tbls), 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla.  I also used fresh peaches instead of canned, and mixed some diced peaches into the cake batter as well. An instant favorite!

I followed the recipe word for word.  The icing was way runny.  And the cake was way, way too high.  Next time I will not cut the cake and I will probably not add any milk.

The cake was delicious and the filling tasted great - however the icing remained very runny no matter how long it was whipped. Turned out to be a big joke, we all laughed at how the peach slices just slid off the top of the cake.
