This recipe was delicious! The food processor made it very easy. I found this recipe tasted great cold but much better at room temperature. Cheesecake is hard to judge when it is done and an overcooked cheesecake will become dry, so if you take it out when the centre of the cake is still a little wiggly it turns out just perfect. The most effective way to bake cheesecake is to bake it in a water bath. Have a dish with a little water in it that is bigger than the cheesecake dish and it sits in it to cook. Since water evaporates at the boiling point, the water bath will never get hotter than 212 degrees F (100 degrees C), no matter what the oven temperature. This means that the outer edge of your cheesecake won't bake faster than the center, which can cause it to souffl√©, sink, and crack. I added cherry pie filling cherries on the top. I will definately share this with company as I already did my familly.

Cheesecakes are my specialty but I've found this recipe to be a little sour tasting.  My husband, who usually enjoys the cheesecakes I make, did not care for it at all.  Needs to be dressed up a bit.  Chocolate chips or fruit topping would have hidden the flavor.

Wasn't too crazy about this recipe at first, but it tastes MUCH better after it sits for a day or so in the fridge. The layers blend much better after it's had a chance to settle and cool off. I recommend making this the day before you plan on serving it. Definately a keeper in that case.

I actually divided the batter in half and made it plain and peanut butter chocolate swirled. It was a bit dry, but that was my fault because I used muffin pans to make heart shaped cakes (valentine's day) and wasn't sure exactly how long to bake for. All in all, it was a nice taste.

Fairly easy to make and it turned out beautiful. I was tempted to not put the top layer of sour cream on. I'll be taking this to put luck dinners from now on.

The cake tasted really great, but it wasn't very hard in the middle.  it was nicely cooked on the sides, however and that was the best part.  we just avoided the middle part of the cake and ate the rest of it.  really great recipe!

I made this cheesecake for my husband since cheesecake is his favorite.  He absolutely loved it.  I've had to make it every week since.  I put some in his lunch everyday.  A coworker asked if I would put an extra slice for him in my husbands lunch box.  This really is the best cheesecake ever!

I chose to make this one due to the almost unanimous high rating, but I must say I wasn't pleased with the result. The sour cream topping was horrible, I had to remove it. I will go back to a more classical recipe.

Really good cheesecake!  I almost didn't try it because it seemed too easy to be true.  I'm glad I did!  I like that you bake it in a 9x13 inch pan.  I used 2 cups graham cracker crumbs instead of crushing them myself.  I melted the 1/2 cup butter to make it easier.  I don't own a food processor so I used my Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer.  It worked just fine.  There were a few lumps in the cheesecake mixture but after baking they were gone.  Thanks for sharing!

This is SUPER easy with a cuisinart, and very good plain or with topping.  I served with with a homemade topping made from sour cherries.  It was truly awesome together.

fool proof cheesecake!!  So yummy too!  I made this and doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan.  I didnt know how long to bake it so i did a huge no no with cheese cakes and poked it with a knife and it craked....no problem, just cover it with the sour cream frosting and it looks perfect!!  I will add a spoonful of cherries when i serve each piece.  This is a keeper...look no further!

This cheesecake got rave reviews!  I took the advice from other bakers and cut down on the margarine a bit for the crust.  I also added a cup of non-fat lemon yogurt and omitted some of the sourcream for the topping, which gave it a nice flavor.  I garnished the top with kiwi slices, but would probably use strawberries next time.  I used reduced fat ingredients and it turned out great!

This is fairly good.  I would like there to be more cheesecake filling, so I would probably 1 1/2 the recipe.  I added lemon juice and zest.

Excellent!  Fast, easy, delicious - what more could you ask for.  Oh yes - and enough for seconds!!! LOL It was perfect - not too sweet and just rich enough!
I added a bit of lemon zest to the cheese! Endless possibilities for toppings - I used cherries with sauce but you could do fresh fruit - mmmm... peaches with apricot jam melted in the microwave and used as a glaze overtop!  This one is a keeper and passing it along to my family.  Thanks Austntachs for sharing.

AWESOME recipe. The only cheesecake recipe I've ever used. I did read the instructions wrong the first time and I never cooked the cheesecake after I put the sourcream layer on top. It turned out great that way though so I still don't, I just put it in the fridge and its like a cold icing. Excellent. Also, I add a little more sugar to the sourcream.

This is the BEST cheesecake I have ever ate/made. T've been making it for about 5 years now and I never get tired of it.   UPDATE: just make in mini muffin pans. I sprayed the heck out of the liners with PAM for Baking (as opposed to last time where i didnt use any greasing method for the liners) I also bought a oven thermoeter bc my oven is kinda "retro." I put about 3/4 tsp of the graham cracker crust in each pan. I then spooned over about a tbsp of the first layer (to the top of the liner) I then baked for 15 min in a 375F oven. I took them out of the oven and let them set for about 3-5 min to let them go down (this allows room for the sour cream later) So i finally spooned about a tsp of the sour cream mixure on top. I bake at 375 for about 7 min. Took out of oven and let them sit in the pan about 5 min and took them out VERY carefully with a opposite end of the spoon and toothpicks and put them on the cooling rack. Taste great even though i just ate like 3 straight out of the over. Ask questions if youd like. I'm so so so happy they turned out!!!!!!! Also even though the top layer tastes sour creamy, dont add more sugar (i tried and too sweet then)

this cheesecake was amazing! i love to bake and my uncle kept bugging me to make him a cheesecake. i wanted to try a different recipe and i fell upon this one. i gave it a try and everyone, especially my uncle, loved it! he ate half a cake (the amount i gave him) and he finished it, on his own, within 2 days. the sour cream topping looked cracked when it cooled down, perhaps i baked it too long or something but overall it was delicious! to garnish the cake, i put fresh strawberries with apple jelly glaze. i definitely recomment this recipe to everyone. very easy to make as well as to eat!!

Very rich and creamy.  I took the advice of others before me and decided to cut the butter down by 1/2.  It worked out very well.  I also used a spring form pan and would suggest that if you also decide to use one that you use the smaller one (8",I think--in a water bath) for a New York cheesecake look.  I didn't wait the 2 hour cool down bfore adding the sour cream and it didn't seem to affect the final result.  Topped off with sugared strawberries, this cheesecake was an Easter hit!

Wonderful cheesecake!!!  Quality did not seem to be affected by adding the sour cream mixture without the two hour cooling period--a great timesaver.  Also, was good with butter decreased by half in the crust.

I took this recipe to my 2003 Oscar party as an ode to 'Chicago' -- the Best Picture winner. Everyone loved it; people asked for the recipe all around! I used my stand-up mixer for each step and it hardly took the 30 minutes indicated here. I let the cheesecake cool for one hour, then put it in the refrigerator to cool for an additional 15 minutes to speed up the process and make the total time even faster. A delicious, easy, fool-proof recipe!

I made this for my sons 13th birthday party...followed the recipe exactly as written and was impressed with how creamy and flavorful this cheesecake turned out to be.  The sour cream topping was a nice addition and looked like frosting.  I topped each piece of cake with a chocolate covered strawberry...a big hit with all.  Thanks Austntachs!!

I thought this was wonderful!  We ate two pieces and I am going out to get a can of cherry pie filling to put on top just to give it try.  I love it!  My hubby loved it!  Will definitely be a pan scraper!

This recipe was excellent, it's basically fool proof, I'm 17 and it came out wonderful :P. This being my first cheesecake and I decided to try it out for my family for the first time :). It went well, since it was a last minute thing. But I didn't have enough time to have the top layer set that well. Also, I made a mistake and used very cold butter for the crust, realizing this, I put it crust mixture in the microwave for 1-1/2 minutes and put it on the bottom of the pan. It was GREAT mistake, it came out yummier than I've tasted in stores if you ask me :). 

Good luck and happy baking :).

This was foolproof and wonderful.  The entire family loved it.  It is very similar to an old family recipe from my great great aunt, but that one retires using a hand beater for 20 minutes...the food processor sure cuts that time down!  The second time I made this, I made it completely sugar-free (with Splenda) and low fat for my diabetic mother.  It was still very tasty.  Thanks for sharing.

I have come to the conclusion that the best recipes are also sometimes the simplest. This is an excellent recipe. Easy to make and tastes wonderful. I did find that the cake needed double the baking time and I put a large pan of hot water on the bottom rack to humidify the oven. Make sure to bake it in the middle of the oven to slow browning. The other reviews were right, the crust had too much butter for me. But this was so good that my 3 year old took off with mine, ate every bite and she's not much for any kind of cake. Thanks for sharing a tasty recipe!

Delicious!  My family loved this recipe.   I altered the recipe slightly though, I doubled the ingredients for the crust to make it thinker and I added the sour cream topping after 30 minutes of baking, instead of letting it cool first.  It turned out great!  Thanks!

This was great, and really easy!  It's not fancy, but a perfect cheesecake for the family.  I personally liked the sour cream topping, but it does give it a tangy flavor--if you prefer your cheesecakes mild and strictly sweet, I'd recommend topping it with something else (or it would probably be fine with no topping at all!)

I had no idea this was for a 9x13 pan when I headed to the grocery store with it for ingredients. So I cut it in thirds and bought a graham cracker 9 inch pie crust to throw it all in. The cream cheese mixture only filled half of the pie shell so I'm hoping the sour cream mixture filled up the rest - I delivered it to a friend to finish, but I'll be trying this again, only with a little more ingredients than a third. It baked wonderfully and smelled delicious!

I added a teaspoon of orange extract to the cream cheese mixture, which gave it a very subtle but good flavor.

This recipe made a large quantity of cheesecake.  Actually I used a disposable aluminum lasagna tray!  I thought I'd have to cut and freeze 1/2 of it so it wouldn't go bad.  Was I wrong!  This is a very rich cheesecake that is just delicious!  Everyone from my 3 kids (13,16,18, hubby and motherinlaw LOVED it!  This is a keeper!  Give it a try---you won't be sorry!

I made this cheesecake for Christmas.  My entire family could not get enough of it.  My kids told me it was as good as Cheesecake Factory. Really good. Followed recipe exactly.  This is the only cheesecake I have ever made that tastes good. Thanks - it's a keeper.

I have only made cheesecake once before but found this really easy to make and really really good.  I made it with light cream cheese and light sour cream (not fat free) and it was great.

I did cut back on the butter in the crust, but not enough - next time I would half it.

I also added the juice and zest of one lemon and that gave it a nice light lemon flavour.

I topped with cherries but next time would serve toppings on the side as I think it would be even better plain.

My husband thought it was better than what he has bought or had in restaurants...I haven't had a lot of cheesecake but it was/is (it makes a pile!  I have loads left) really good and a friend who came for lunch today asked for the recipe.

I will definitely be making this again, especially for pot lucks.  If I make it for our family again I'll cut the recipe by at least a third.

Delicious!!!  This cheesecake is very easy to make and is so creamy and smooth.  I took it to my office for a treat day and it was gone within minutes.  Everyone raved about it.  My only suggestion is that you cut the amout of butter down especially if you use a springform pan.

I tried this and other than the time factor, this was the best tasting cheesecake I have ever tried.  It's even better than those I have tried at restaurants.  I didn't think it needed anything on top.  Awesome!!!

This is my mothers cheese cake recipe...almost. I add a 4th 8oz. cream cheese pkg. to the sour cream top along with some more sugar 2-3 tbsp. This tastes much better, my mom even agreed.

Absolutely devine. I am a cheesecake purist. I like it just the way it is without other toppings. This is the best. For the people who said they didn't care for this recipe, the size of your eggs can make a difference. Just use large eggs. I find the sour cream topping very appealing. To me, this is the way cheesecake should taste. If the topping is too sour then add more sugar or pile it with canned pie filling when serving.

I wasn't too sure ablout this recipe because of the sour cream top.  I followed the recipe and it was a hit. everyone loved it and they could not believe I had made it. I will make it again and add some fruit to the top. I will make it for christmas or before. :) You do not have to worry if the cheesecake breaks because the top will cover it.

great taste, unappealing texture. i didn't liked the idea of adding 3 eggs to this recipe but this recipe has so many good reviews that i decided to follow the recipe without making any changes. BIG MISTAKE! 3 eggs are way too much to this recipe it ended up looking like a souffle with a flanish texture if that's possible. Next time i make this i will add just 1 egg. i loved the taste. i topped this cheesecake with guava marmalade instead SOOO GOOD.

It was a hit. Lazy me used a purchased graham cracker crust. I was short some of the cream cheese (some one must of had a bagel for breakfast), and my vanilla was no more. So I used Orange extract and about 2 3/4 boxes of the cream cheese, plus everything as the instructions say. Everyone loved it. Thanks for the simple recipe.

to much butter in the crust cut it in half to make a crispy crust and cut the cooking time to 8 mins and you will have a perfect cheesecake

was easy to make and a huge hit. i took it to a chrismas party and it was gone before i even knew people knew about it. the reason im only giving it four stars is because it tastes like the cheesecake that is on the back of the cream cheese packs

This was only my second time making a cheesecake but I needed a recipe that could be done fast.  This one worked out great.  I didn't read all the reviews but a few tips...I added 3 tablespoons of sugar to the sour cream topping instead of 3 teaspoons and it was really good.  Didn't diffuse the sour cream flavor, I would recommend it.  I had a dish of canned cherry topping on the side, but I would suggest using fresh cut fruit on top of the cheesecake to compliment the sour cream flavor better.  I only waited 1 hour for the cake to cool after putting on the sour cream, and there were no problems.  Also, I used a 9" round springform pan and it required about 40 minutes extra to cook (I also put a pan of water in the oven to add moisture).  Great recipe and the graham cracker crust was really good too....I agree, you can use about 1/2 the butter and it would still be great.

This is a great recipe for cheesecake with a graham cracker crust.  Ok maybe it is just me I could not find a 8x12 pan.  I am just going to try a 9x13 next time.  I love the sour cream topping.  Even my niece ate it.

I was a bit skeptical about this recipe; wasn't too sure how the sour cream layer would taste, but decided to try it anyway. I made it for Christmas, it was a huge hit with the crowd. I added about 2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice (because I like a hint of lemon in my cheesecakes)Everybody raved about it.
Thanks for sharing this one!

Wow, I made a cheesecake without a springform pan - this was so easy and pretty good. I dont have a food processor so I just used the box of graham cracker crumbs (2 cups) and mixed it by hand - served some blueberry pie filling on top for my blueberry freak husband ;) - He loved it!

Very good recipe. I have another recipe I really love, but I would encourage any novice cheesecake baker or one who may be short on time (as I was when I made this) to try this recipe for happy results.

I made this recipe,  It is closest to the changes I've made in other recipes.                                                                   I substituted 9% MF greek yogurt for the sour cream and used jumbo eggs.    I used lemon Yogurt and added the zest of 3 lemons. It was fantastic!! Not one piece was left over.  I baked in a water bath and cracked the oven to let it cool when it was done cooking ,after an hour I moved it to the counter to cool a few hours before moving it to the fridge to chill for 12 +hours.  This is easy to flavour as you can use whatever flavour of yogurt you like.

Very easy to make. I've made it for over 3 years at least 3 times a year and it's the first dessert item gone! The only challenge is baking it just right, or it's to soft/ a little burnt. Best cheese cake ever.

Baking time of the cheesecake is 50-60 minutes, not 25-30.  Recipe also needs adjusted to remove the specific measurement amounts which don't update if the "servings" is changed.  Otherwise, the cheesecake itself is amazing!  Oh, and using the food processor made it effortless!

This recipe was super easy. The only thing I changed was to use 8 oz sour cream and 8 oz vanilla bean Greek yogurt for flavor in the topping  and topped with berries for serving. Absolutely delish with coffee and after dinner drinks. I will definitely make this again.

Made this and followed it to a T, just had to bake it a little longer the first time to firm it up but I was using stone so that varies a little. It tasted gourmet. My family was VERY impressed. I'll be making this one from now on! Thanks for sharing!!!

This recipe has been the hit of my office now for 2 years. No matter if I server it as is or fruit and whipped cream they love it!. I've tried mixing pumpkin in half of the mix,then topping with the rest of the creamcheese mixture and it turned out great.  My favorite is topped with whipped cream then drizzled with raspberry prserves.  Love this recipe.

I made this for my son's birthday and it was devoured.  I also added strawberry topping as found at http://allrecipes.com/recipe/supreme-strawberry-topping/detail.aspx The firm texture and flavor was loved by all.  Thank you.

i wanted to make a low-fat cheesecake for myself, but all i had was one 8 oz package of fat-free cream cheese, so i cut the recipe into one-third. i just mixed the cream cheese, an egg, 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and 1/3 cup sugar in a bowl then put it in 6 muffin cups and baked it for about 20 minutes. it had a terrible consistency and was very liquidy, but this might have been due to the fat-free cream cheese. it tasted alright, but didn't cook evenly, so maybe a water bath would fix that, and i would recommend sticking to one round pan, opposed to muffin cups. the sour cream topping i made with fat-free sour cream and added some black berry jam, and it tasted fine.

I have never made a cheesecake before and decided on this recipe  because it sounded easy. I read the other reviews on the sourcream topping and made a couple of additions to it. I added extra sugar, vanilla and lemon juice. This cheesecake turned out awesome. My family loved it and I will be making it again.

I agree with REBECCA50; I thought the sour cream topping was absolutely disgusting.  My husband, who eats anything, wouldn't touch it.  Sorry, just not our taste.

My husband gave it a four star but I think it's more of a five.  I don't really care for cheesecake but this one was lighter and fluffier, which I like.  The cinnamon flavor was sooo good in the crust. I don't have a food processor so I tried it first with the blender (didn't work), then I just blended it with the hand mixer, which worked out fine.
