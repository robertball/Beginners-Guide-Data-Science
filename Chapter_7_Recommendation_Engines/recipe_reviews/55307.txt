OMG! This was so good - a really nice twist on classic recipes! If you love BLT's and you love pizza then this is for you! My husband and I love 'em both, so what could be better than combining these all time favorites! Plus, it was a great way to use up some leftover bacon I had on hand and some cherry tomatoes that I cut in half. This recipe was simple and delicious. It was perfect for a quick lunch. Very filling - a definite keeper for sure.

Wow, this was soooo good. As I was making it, I was starting to doubt the recipe as there aren't many ingredients and I wondered if the pizza would be bland without sauce. Once I took my first bite, I knew it'd become a staple in my house! I love BLTs and this was excellent, tastes just like one. My advice is to sprinkle the lettuce on each individual piece as you serve it. That way if there are any leftovers, you won't get soggy bread/wilted lettuce. Chop fresh lettuce each time.. it's worth it!

AWESOME, so quick and easy and soooo delicious! I had some Ready Bacon on hand, so I just snipped it into 1/4" pieces with my kitchen shears and tossed it on. Doubled up on the bacon, tomatoes, and mayo. When I went to make the dressing, I whisked together the mayo, 1/2 tsp. of garlic salt, and 1/4 tsp. of pepper with a little bit of water to make it easier to coat the lettuce. Pleased all of the adults and 2 out of 3 kids. This is gonna be a new family favorite! Thanks AMYAME!

I have to admit, I was kind of skeptical of pizza w/no red sauce, but this was fabulous!  I prepared as directed, except I'm lazy and hate my house smelling like fried bacon, so I used Hormel real bacon pieces instead of "real" bacon.  I used part skim cheese and light mayo and it still tasted great. To further lighten the recipe, I will also use a stronger cheese, maybe a sharp blend like classic melts, but use less of it.  My husband enjoyed it, too.  This will be a cheap, easy weeknight keeper!  THANKS!

What a great recipe! I did some things differently and wished I hadn't. I used diced tomatoes with jalepeno peppers (next time I definitely won't). I also will use Jay's Pizza Crust recipe next time too. If you follow the recipe exactly I know it's excellent! YUM!

We are really fond of BLT and Pizza, we liked the pizza, we made it as it says with the only difference that we added more tomatoes, however we think it has room for improvement. Next time will make it adding some garlic to the mayo or to the olive oil.

My kids and I just spent the week with my sisters and their kids...there were 11 children in all. I served this BLT pizza one night and they all loved it! My kids who are not fond of "salad" (their word for lettuce) even liked the mayo/lettuce topping. I would recommend adding red or green onions and lots more tomatoes, but thats just because that is what I like. Try this recipe...you wont regret it!

Double the bacon & add lemon juice to the mayo to lighten it up. We used peppered bacon which increased the intensity.

We make a lot of pizza dough & run the oven at 450 ... 350 seems a little on the cool side for a crispy (not soupy) crust.

I really liked this pizza, but then again I'm a BLT lover, in general.  I wasn't sure about the lettuce/mayo topping so left it on the side for people to use at their discretion, but I thought it made the pizza.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I think this pizza is amazing.  The only change I make is to first thinly coat the crust with mayo before I put the cheese on.  I also use the boboli crusts....they are the perfect thickness!

My husband was skeptical but ate 1/2 the pizza! It's a refreshing alternative to ordinary pizza as the lettuce has a crunch and the flavors are great together. I use lowfat mayo and reduced fat cheese to make this a healthier meal.

Sorry-I'm going to have to disagree with the other reviewers. I had high hopes for this recipe because I love BLT sandwiches and I love pizza. The combination just didn't seem to come together for my husband and I. I followed the recipe exactly and served it immediately but the lettuce just seemed to get hot and wilty on top of the hot pizza. My husband said he preferred the pizza without the lettuce/mayo mixture.

Absolute favorite! I used a whole pound of bacon & 2 smaller tomatoes since I was feeding the whole family. Also, use refrigerator pizza dough if you don't have a tried & true recipe for homemade dough. Yum!

This is a great concept and, as written, we found the flavors to be a little bland and a little too cheesy for our tastes.   The second time we changed it a little and prefer our changed version.  I prebaked the crust for a couple of minutes then brushed it with a garlic olive oil.  Then we spread a layer of our favorite guacamole recipe over the crust.  On top of that we layered just a small amount of mozarella -2-3 Tablespoons, then added the tomato, the bacon, and topped that with another 2-3 Tablespoons of mozarella.  We've always liked guacamole (or even plain avacado) on our BLTs so this change really suits our tastes perfectly.  Be sure to prepare the lettuce at the last minute and only prepare the entire amount if you plan to eat the entire pizza.  The lettuce willts quickly and is not good if you have leftovers.  Without this recipe I never would have thought of putting a BLT on a pizza crust. Thanks for the great idea.

It was just okay. Most of our guest actually just ate this without the lettuce/mayo mix and dipped it in sauce that was served with the breadsticks.

YUM! I've had BLT pizza's from restaurants before so I was excited to find this recipe here, and it doesn't disappoint! I add a slice or two more of bacon but that's my preference.

I love BLT Pizza, but I had to make two small changes to this recipe in order to get it the way I remember. I use a pound of bacon and bake the pizza dough topped with mozzarella cheese and bacon first. Then top it with the mayo/lettuce mix and tomato slices afterwards.

This wasn't that good. There were two problems. Bake time is not nearly long enough. Also I mixed the lettuce and mayo about an hour before I put the pizza in the oven so perhaps that effected the final outcome. Either way not super impressed.

This pizza is FANTASTIC!  I made my own pizza dough, doubled the tomato and used turkey bacon in place of regular. I also sprinkled a little garlic powder on the crust itself and again into the mayo with the salt and pepper.  Thank you so much Amyame, this will definitely go on the rotation!!

I used two cans refrigerated reduced fat crescent roll dough to make one 9x13 pizza. I used a full pound of turkey bacon and a homemade mayo/sour cream fat free based ranch dressing. I did increase the tomato. The family thought this was great, I did not try this myself but they were raving about it. Super easy and great to use pantry items I always have on hand.

This as an easy and good recipe. This was a lot of fun to make on a Saturday afternoon. We subbed cheddar for the mozzarella and cooked the bacon in the microwave. Thanks for the post.

I thought this was delicious. I did use 2 tomatoes, 9 pieces of bacon, a whole bag of cheese and a whole bag of lettuce. What can I say? I like my pizza with lots of toppings!

I recently ordered a BLT pizza from a local pizza place and loved it...so I researched and found this amazing recipe!!  I made it homemade and will be regular meal.  The recipe is perfect as it but my family loves extras so we just added a bit more of everything!!!

I was a little scared of this pizza but it was great! If you like your bacon crispy, make sure it's crispy when you cook it, it isn't in the oven long enough to crisp more.

We made this tonight and it was great.  We added avocadoes and more tomatoes on top.  Next time I'll add garlic when I do the olive oil on the crust.  Thanks for the recipe!

Bought premade crust and toasted it in oven. Mixed mayo, garlic powder, and pepper in bowl and spread over crust. Topped with 5 strips of bacon diced, canned diced tomatoes, and mozarella cheese. Baked 7 min then took out and topped with shredded lettuce. Very good!

Really good, though I used my own dough instead of refrigerated dough (Grill Dough recipe from this site, and rolled it really thin...BTW this was even better on the grill!).  This was my first BLT pizza I made myself and I loved it! I hadn't had it with the lettuce coated with mayo before but I preferred that instead of spreading it on the crust, as I had it previously.  Tastes like a BLT sandwich, but better!

Nice pizza.  I left out mayo bc I'm not a fan at all, and I used homemade pizza dough--used the Pizza Crust for Breadmachine dough on here.  It turned out really well, although I don't think I had enough tomatoes bc I didn't really taste them.  With more tomatoes, would be better.  It doesn't really taste that much like a BLT to me, but I do like the combos.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it.  Made as directed with the addition of a little ranch dressing on the crust as a sauce.  Sliced tomatoes for a prettier look.  We just brought the lettuce to the table in a separate bowl for our guests to put on separately.

Awesome Pizza!!!  My husband loves this and has said that it is better than the pizza chain we order it from.  Only thing I did different was to spread the mayo on the pizza then put the lettuce on top of that.  I was leary about mixing the mayo with the lettuce.

This recipe has 5 star potential, but as is, I thought it was a 4... I made it a second time, this time using shredded cheddar, I brushed the crust with ranch dressing, added lots more bacon (a must!), and I opted not to cook the tomatoes on the pizza- I topped the hot pizza with lettuce and fresh diced tomatoes, and a drizzle of mayo across the top. Delicious! I will definitely put this in the dinner rotation.

This was delicious and we've fixed them numerous times.  We have changed it a bit; I used the precooked pizza crust and bacon and instead of the mozzarella I used the Mexican or 4 Cheese blend.  Either way great recipe.

We love this pizza, I am eating leftovers as I am writing this. Just popped it in the toaster oven on 400 deg, still good even with the warm lettuce. We always have cooked bacon in the fridge. so I used a rollout pre-made dough from the grocery.  I did bake it a few minutes with some olive oil before putting the toppings on. Next week,  bbq chicken pizza. Another great recipe.

I love this recipe - with one exception.   I prefer fresh, uncooked tomatoes on mine so my pizza goes in with just the cheese and bacon.   Sliced tomatoes go on after it comes out of the oven, and then the lettuce/mayo mix.    My mouth drools just thinking of it!

I spread seasoned mayo over the crust and cheese to bake. Then I put on lettuce (not dressed) and tomato after baking.  Changed it somewhat but a good pizza. I'm thinking of baking spinach on one sometime for a flavor kick.  You never know.

I wasn't sure what to expect of this but I thought , give it a try. I wanted something a little different than the usual BLT sandwich.
WOW!!! This was delicious. Of course, I added a couple of things that just made this zing for my wife and me. We're still raving about it. First, I was going to get a prepared pizza crust but found, instead, Stonefire Tandor baked Naan bread. Again, I thought what the heck, it might be good. I did follow the recipe mostly but added a little smoked Gouda cheese with the mozzarella. Then I added just about a tablespoon of Sweet Baby Ray's sweet and spicy BBQ sauce to the dressing(I always use Miracle Whip). I then drizzled some bbq sauce over the pizza and cooked it for about 14 minutes. I also used red-leafed lettuce and mixed in some Arugula. I've really fallen in love with Arugula lately. This thing had flavors out the wazoo. It's a keeper for me. It's very easy to put together. This would make great appetizers, cut up in small squares. I will also plan to make this for guests sometime. — HAWGSOOIE

Wow! I have to say I was a skeptic. A BLT pizza? The reviews helped a lot. This dish was a home run!! Only thing I added was a bit of red pepper flakes all over the pie,and slice tomatoes over the mozzarella and bacon crumbles, before baking. (I do pre-bake my crusts) The lettuce with miracle whip (what we put on our regular BLT's) is the icing on this pizza pie. Great recipe and we'll be having it as a regular. One poster used sliced avocados, that will probably be a topping with the lettuce next time, sounds delicious.

This was really good and we really enjoyed this! I made my own pizza crust and I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo. My homegrown tomatoes were definitely the star in this recipe, and bacon, need I say more?

I wasn't quite willing to go with NO sauce, so I spread a very thin layer of pesto on the crust before adding my tomatoes from the garden sliced instead of chopped.  The contrast between the crisp, cold lettuce and the warm pizza was very nice.  I will make this again.

Sooo good! I wasn't sure if it would be good because there is no sauce, but it was fantastic!! I sprinkled a little oregano on top, and used a mix of mozzarella and provel cheese, doubled the bacon and the tomato too. I also added green peppers just because I had them around, but I know it would have been just as good without the extras! Highly recommend !

RANCH DRESSING!  Use Ranch as the pizza sauce!  It is amazing and easy and you can skip the mayo and olive oil. Our family even makes Tomato pizza with ranch as the sauce without the bacon. It is sooo good.

I used a little fresh garlic on the crust after putting on the olive oil. I also added some ranch dressing to the lettuce mix as well. The guys gobbled it up! I thought it was good..just not great.

This has become a regular at our house. The only difference I do is add pizza sauce, sprinkle with Mrs. Dash Tomato Basil and add extra bacon.

OK folks, here's the deal. This is pretty good, but not as good as CPK's version, IMHO (and I'm not sure why b/c the concept & ingredients are the same). Having said that, BLT pizza is the ONLY thing I will order when my fiance & I eat there, so I really DO enjoy it. I have a couple of tips for those of you wanting to give this a try. First of all, I understand that it is human nature to 'tweak' a recipe to your liking, but sometimes, it is best left as is. I have to admit that I'm usually quick to make most of the changes suggested by other reviewers, but sometimes, they're just wrong. Stick with the recipe on this one. If you are striving for authenticity, keep in mind that your lettuce / mayo mix. should be ever so lightly dressed. Doubling it (even if you thin w/ H2O or milk) will leave you w/ soggy, sloppy lettuce!!!  Suggestions to dbl. the bacon (who doesn't like bacon??!!?!?) & sub. garlic salt for plain table salt are spot on, however. I ended up using the dressing recipe from Mooney's BLT Salad recipe since I enjoy it so much. Just scale to 2 T / 1/4 c. worth mayo & add 1/8 t garlic powder or salt, a pinch of pepper and 1/2 T / 1/2 t milk. My only other sugg. would be to use a VERY good quality pizza crust (why skimp on the main part???). I used a Boboli whole wheat one since CPK serves theirs on honey wheat (closest I could find to that).  Overall, this was a good pizza, but when I'm craving the "real" thing, I'll head to the chain. TY for sharing! :-)

When I make a BLT pizza much like this, I add cooked chopped up chicken and spread the Hellman's on the crust with salt/pepper. I also spoon the chopped tomatoes on each piece after it is cooked as my husband doesn't like tomatoes on pizza. Red onions are definitely good too!

Okay. A nice twist on homemade pizza, but it seemed a little bland. Husband and 3-year-old preferred it without the lettuce on top. If I make again, will either add some seasonings with the oil on the crust, more bacon, or possibly Miracle Whip with the lettuce instead of mayo.

My mother was a huge fan of this pizza when our home town pizza place used to make it.  This wasn't as good, but very close!  If you enjoy a BLT you will love this!  Don't skimp on the bacon.

Although the idea is good and the toppings taste fine, the crust beneath the toppings was completely soggy. I should have known to prebake it, but foolishly followed the recipe directions instead. The result - a soggy, barely edible dinner.

I've made this three times in the last month as it has become our favorite pizza... and so easy to make.  I prefer to use 2 tomatoes and about 8 strips of bacon and serve the lettuce mixture separately so as not to have soggy leftovers.

we have always enjoyed BLT pizza at our favorite pizza place but I have never made it before now.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added Roasted Garlic (you have to try this simple recipe from this site) just spread the roasted garlic on the pizza crust before adding the toppings.  It was delicious. I love the addition of mayo to the lettuce. Next time I will use a homemade crust.

Some people think the idea of a BLT Pizza is a little odd, but once they taste it, their opinion usually changes! I tried my first BLT Pizza at CPK and was thrilled at the idea of making my own at home. This is a great recipe and tastes just like the CPK pizza! Thanks!

I've been looking for a BLT pizza recipe.  A local pizza restaurant serves one.  I absolutely loved this!  Even the kids did too!  I did subst. the bacon with the salad toppers Bacon Toppers pieces.  One package was perfect for us.  Others may want more bacon.

You would think putting lettuce on a pizza would be gross, but its really good.  I used ranch instead of mayo because my husband always uses ranch on his pizza's.  I really loved a pizza with no sauce!  No Heartburn!

We love BLT pizza from a local pizza place, so I knew this was a winner!  I used a prebaked crust (will make homemade next time) and added some green onion with the bacon and cheese (mexican blend). Sprinkled with black pepper and baked it w/o adding the tomatoes.  I added the tomatoes cold (more than called for) with the lettuce mixture rather than baking them. I used some extra mayo and squirted some over the crust before topping.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I used a half recipe of Jay's signature Pizza Crust (from this site) then sprinkled it with garlic powder before I put down the cheese.  I didn't bake it with the bacon and tomato, I added them afterward.  Didn't measure the lettuce or mayo (did use more than 2 T though!)  My husband worked as a pizza delivery boy about 20 years ago and the BLT pizza was their speciality.  I've been hearing about this pizza this as long as I've known him and am glad I can now make it!

I really liked this concept for pizza since we LOVE BLT's.  Minor changes included using an already baked 6" focaccia (recipe from this site).  I also heated the pizza with 2 tablespoons of ranch dressing spread on the pizza.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I subbed chopped sun dried tomatoes in oil. Nice change of pace from red pizza.

I doubled the bacon 4 slices just didn't seem like it was enough. I ate my first slice as stated with the lettuce on top. I didn't care much for it that way. I ate my next slice without the lettuce and I liked it a lot better. If I make this again I will add some ranch on the bottom and use lettuce on top but without mayo mixed in it. Thanks for the post.

Yum! My husband had never had BLT pizza before and he LOVED IT! If you cook for or are a BLT fan and a pizza lover, try this! Only thing I did differently was use garlic salt instead of regular salt.

I made this a couple of days ago for a group of teenage boys. I also made the Cheesburger Pizza from this site. Believe it or not, they liked this one better. I didn't really measure anything with this, just used all the ingredients and it came out well, and couldn't be easier. Though the boys all enjoyed it, my hubby and I just thought it was so-so and not something that would generally appeal to a lot of people. The mayo could possibly be a turn off to some if you are not a big fan. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this type of pizza, but it was bland so I added chicken that I cooked and diced up I used homemade ranch with cream cheese and spread on the bottom for sauce. Then to kick it off drizzled ranch on the top... I also used 12 peices of bacon.  YUMMY

Wasn't a huge fan of this, it just didn't have the taste I was looking for.  I followed the recipe exactly- but I am also a "newbie" so I may just have messed something up.  Sorry : (

Easy and good. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I might increase the bacon to 6 slices and increase the lettuce to 3 cups. Be sure to chop the tomato by hand and not in the food processor or you'll have tomato soup LOL. It is great just as is though. A keeper, particularly when I am wanting to do something easy that the whole family will enjoy. Thank you AMYAME for the recipe!! *****UPDATE***** This continues to be a family favorite. I use 9 slices of bacon and 4 cups of shredded lettuce, otherwise I follow the recipe exactly. I wanted to say thanks again for a wonderful recipe!!

This was very good and easy to make. Not very good the next day though!
