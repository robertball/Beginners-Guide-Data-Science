Delicious! I cut the recipe in half to give this a try and I'm glad I did.  I used olive oil vs. melted butter and added a pinch of sugar to the lime juice.  I also used minced garlic vs. garlic powder. Overall, very good!

Such a great recipe. I did use canned sundried tomatoes, and it was still awesome! Even my 2year old loved it, I think its the lime that really adds the yummy flavor. Thank you!

What a lovely idea for a recipe! Im very surprised it hasnt been rated yet!

I got interested in the recipe, because i got braces recently, and so i cant really eat corn on the cobs normally (however much i love them!)

Ok, i think this recipe yould be awesome: WITH these adaptions:

Instead of the garlic powder, use 3 cloves of garlic, crushed.

Use 1 whole red pepper.

Use 1/2 the lime reccomended.

So im giving it a good rating, mainly because i believe that with these alterations, this would be a brilliant recipe. We actually served this warm instead of as a salad, and it worked out fab.

This salad takes a little bit of effort but is well worth it. This by far is one of the best ways to serve corn. Between the lime juice and the cracked pepper it really has a bite to it. I loved it!

It was very good.  I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes so I cut some grape tomatoes in half and grilled them and then folded them into the corn right before serving.

Really good.  I did not use as much of the sun dried tomatoes, nor as much salt.  I used fresh garlic and a good bit of it, olive oil instead of butter, more lime juice, and no parsley.  So, I suppose this was  not really the same recipe.  Still, I think it was a great idea.

I wasn't sure how this would turn out as I am not a big fan of sun-dried tomatoes, but it was really good.  Nice balance of acidity and sweetness.  Great crunchy texture too.

I did not like this at all. Maybe because I used can corn instead but I followed the recipe and there was way too much lime.

This recipe has tons of flavor.  It's almost like a relish.  Great summer dish for bbq's or potluck.  My husband does not like red bell pepper, so I used green, but it's otherwise perfect.  Loved it.

I had some leftover corn on the cob that I had cut off the cob.  I've had this recipe in my box for quite a while.  Glad I remembered it was there because this was a very good salad to use it up.  We enjoyed the mixture of seasonings and the red peppers and sun-dried tomatoes.  The lime juice pulled all the flavors together.  The first time I served it, it was at room temp.  The next time it had been refrigerated, enjoyed it both ways.  Thanks Linriyum for sharing.

This is the best way to serve corn off the cob...I didn't use sundried tomatoes I used just regular tomatoes and I put some onion and jalapeno peppers in it for a little kick and it was great! The lime juice was great with the corn never would of thought of that!

The first bite was good but then I started to not like the corn with the lime so much.  The ingredients did sound yummy though...maybe leave out the lime next time and try lemon...

Our family loves this! I used my favorite sweet white corn from Maryland's Eastern Shore that's been blanched and frozen. I boiled it with butter, salt, water, then drained and spread in a disposable tin pan & placed on the grill for a while. Then prepared by the recipe. Next time, I'd definitely use way less lime. But... Very tasty side dish!

Great Recipe!  I made as the recipes states except using 2 cloves of pressed garlic instead of the garlic powder, 1/4 c of lime juice,  cherry tomatoes instead of sun-dried and added fresh thyme from the garden.  It was delicious!!

this was really good.. i cut this down to 2 servings and used a little over one cup of frozen corn that i pan fried until it got roasted/spotted.. i subbed olive oil for the butter, bottled lime juice for the fresh, half a yellow bell pepper for the 1/8 red, one roma tomato in place of the sun dried tomatoes, table salt (half the amount) for the kosher, cilantro for parsley and one minced garlic clove for the garlic powder.. bf said he loved the fresh taste and that this was like a corn salsa.. it sounds like i changed a lot of things but i think i stuck to the flavor profile intended.. ty for the recipe

I boiled the corn instead of grilling it and I only used one tbs of garlic powder. Very tasty! I will try it with grilled corn next time.

I used boiled, fresh corn rather than roasted corn and dried rather than jarred sun dried tomatoes. It was still fabulous and a big hit at the church potluck.

I made this last night with some left-over corn and was impressed at earthy and good it tasted.  i used sun-dried tomatoes and roasted peppers, less salt and less garlic powder.  Can't wait to taste the rest of it tonight.

2 tablespoons of garlic powder was way to much. I recommend starting off with a teaspoon and working your way up. Remade the dish using less garlic powder and it was really a winner.

Perfect for a light summer side dish or at a bbq.
