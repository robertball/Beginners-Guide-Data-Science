This is fantastic Ice Cream. The first time I cut the recipe in half but since then I make the full amount. Not only is it fantastic as an ice cream but it also works great as an ice cap. I fill my blender half way with ice, add in a bunch of the recipe mix, some extra coffee granuales to taste and some milk. Blend this all together and you come really close to a Tim Hortons Ice Cap. Love this recipe and will make this again and again. Thanks for posting this recipe Mr. McCarty.

Really good. I added mini semisweet chips to this. Next time, I think I'll also add more coffee. Thanks!

This is fantastic!  I cooked up the mixture a day ahead and just stored in the fridge until I was ready.  The kids weren't crazy about the coffee flavor (hence the "mocha").  The coffee flavor was alot less intense on day 2 so I recommend making this one at least one day ahead.  The next time I make this one, I am going to omit the instant coffee.  I think the kids would prefer it that way but it's fantastic just the way it is!!!  Thanks for this one!

Totally delicious ice cream recipe! I only made half the recipe and so glad I did cause it filled my 1 1/2 quart ice cream bowl almost to the brim. I did make one change to this recipe - I used 1 c. milk and 1 c. heavy cream for the 2 c. of half&half required. Worked out perfectly. The flavour of this ice cream is wonderful. The coffee has a very subtle tone and compliments the chocolate perfectly (for my palette.) I will be using this recipe often. Thanks for sharing.

this recipe was great.  Only thing I would do differently is add more coffee.  I even used splenda in place of the sugar.  I also added marshmallows and chocolate chips.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This was our first attempt at homemade ice cream in several years, and the whole family loves it.  I may add extra cream next time, as it was a little hard to scoop, but the flavor was great.  We added slivered almonds to one batch and m&ms and peanut butter to another.

I just finished making this ice cream, it is outstanding, this best chocolate I have ever tasted. I changed it alittle since I did not have enough half and half, so I added more heavy crean. The instant coffee enhanced the cocolate.
Before it went into the freezer, I had to have a taste, it was out of this world.
I give this 5 stars and will make this again.

This recipe is really good! It takes a long time to make, and it makes a lot. Also, there are little flour clumps that I'm not sure how to get rid of.

Awesome chocolate ice cream!  My family is big into coffee.  In fact, I've been referred to as a "coffee snob".  So the 2nd time I made this, 2 days after the 1st, I used 1/4-1/2 cup strong fresh brewed coffee and reduced milk by same amount and added 1 cup mini semi sweet chocolate chips, delightful flavor!  I only made 1/2 recipe because I have a small ice cream maker but next time I will probably make full amount and do 2 batches (I have 2 freezing bowls) b/c this doesn't last long in my house!

The other reviewers are right...the taste is addictive.  I only made half a batch with the same amount of coffee granules x 3.  I don't have an ice cream maker, so I made it manually by beating it every 45 minutes or so for several hours.  It was tough, but well worth the effort.  Although maybe I'll try to use an ice cream maker next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

OKay, I made this recipe, never having made ice cream before-got a new ice cream machine so I needed to try it to make sure it worked properly--well I am here to tell you--HOORAY for Mr. McCarty!  It was GREAT!  It was creamy, it was like my favoritest ice cream at the store only better!!!!  I did add chunked almonds at the end.  Oh my goodness, thank you thank you thank you.  Try this recipe--you won't be sorry.  Oh, I did the straining of the mixture like one post suggested--did not catch anything, but wanted to make sure.  I would suggest doing that for a 'just in case' plan. 
After the trial run that I just had to do, I took it to our church ice cream social.  Yep--you guessed it.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  That is a success in my book when someone wants the recipe.  Enjoy!

Made this for an ice cream social  and the ladies wanted the recipe. I didnt have a candy thermometer so I think I over cooked it a little. As I poured it into the ice cream cylinder I used a strainer to catch any clumps. Turned out some of the egg solidified and I was glad I did.  Would make it again very yummy!

I coarsely ground espresso and cooked it with the custard.  I strained out the beans when I added the cream at the end.  I also added chopped almonds at the end of freezing. Yum!

This is very good and fairly easy. I used another reviewers advice and used instant espresso instead of instant coffee. This did not have much coffee flavor, but my kids weren't looking for that. If you truly wanted a coffee taste to it, I would use more coffee.

This was quite a solid recipe. I made a few personal changes based on my tastes. First, for a little richer/thicker texture I used two eggs and 2 egg yolks (instead of the full 4 eggs). Also, the first batch that i got out of this recipe, the coffee flavor was very mild so I added another half Tablespoon of the instant coffee to my second batch. And ... for a little contrasting texture I added a large chocolate muffin, I kept in the freezer for a day so it would hold up better in the mixer, about 3/4ths of the way through the churning process (Diced to 1/2in cubes). Overall, it was good stuff.

Really yummy! I used expresso instead of instant coffee and it turned out so smooth. I think the heating binds the fat so it doesn't stick to your mouth, it just tastes wonderful. Can't wait to make more.

The coffee crystals still showed, which I thought was strange, but it was very flavorful and easy to do.
