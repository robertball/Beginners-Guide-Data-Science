This recipe is incredibly versatile. In addition to making them as the recipe states, I have also made them with chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, raisins and mini marshmallows. But my most favorite of all these combinations is the one with raisins, honey roasted peanuts and cappucino chips. Yum! Thanks Becca!

Who would guess this would make something so yummy? I frequently have trouble getting butterscotch chips to melt smoothly. For some reason they like to turn into a lumpy mess so I usually add a tablespoon of shortening to the chips to help them stay smooth (butter won't work, the water in it just adds to the problem!).

THIS IS IT!  :)
My Grandma made cookies that we all called Noodle Cookies.  She is no longer with us and I've been searching for the exact recipe she used.  This is it!  The only butterscotch chips that work well are Nestles.  If you use an off brand it doesn't melt well.  Also I'd like to add that I put my chips in the micro to melt.  Much easier then a double boiler.

It is a good recipe but instead of using peanuts and butterscotch chips use marshmallows and peanut butter mix it up with your noodles and you have a great no bake treat!

Super easy and yummy.  I took the advise to microwave the chips on the "defrost" function rather than use a double broiler.  I have a Whirlpool Gold and I selected Defrost, Fish, and .5 pounds (or pressed 5 on the keypad) and it worked great.  I forgot to stir during the heating too.  My batch produced about 28 cookies. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent and easy recipe for satisfying that sweet tooth!  For chips used 1/2 butterscotch chips and 1/2 white chocolate.  Also added bits of cashews to the peanuts.  Tip for first time makers (like me): Definitely use a double broiler.  After mixing it all together, keep the heat on low and spoon from bottom where the mixture is warm.  Makes it much easier to form the drops.

When I first read the ingredients to this recipe I couldn't imagine it tasting good.  Was I wrong!  It's quick, easy and tastes good.  However, I did not use a double-boiler.  I just melted the butterscotch chips in a saucepan on low heat which seemed to work fine.  I'll definately add this one to my recipe box.

I loved these when I was a little kid but have never been able to find the recipe for them because I didn't know what they were called. Thank goodness for this site! I made these yesterday and they were perfect - absolutely delicious! I omitted the nuts, and made half with butterscotch morsels and the other half with chocolate chips (which is how I remember them from years ago). Both were superb!

Huge hit. Many folks I've served these to seem to remember it from school lunchrooms in their childhood. Save the trouble of the double boiler, and melt the butterscotch in the microwave on a defrost setting, stirring often.

I loved the classic combination of tastes with the noodles and butterscotch, but was hoping for a smoother, more fudge-like consistency from the coating.  I did use some nice fresh Nestles chips, and they were delicious, but not that cooperative. They didn't melt easily and evenly- the butterscotch seemed to get a bit dry and lumpy.  The cookies dried to a rock-hard consistency, with uneven coating that was almost too hard to bite into.  So, overall, a bit disappointing.

I love this recipe! and i did it several different ways and used them as christmas gifts bc not everyone likes choc or butterscotch ect.. so try these ideas, substitue milk chocolate for the butter scotch or white choc. I like to use white choc and cranberreies, or milk choc and nuts! they are so easy and fun to do!

This is a great basic recipe. My family does something similar to this but with chocolate and peanut butter chips. Around the holidays we add half a cherry and 2 extra chow mein noodles to make them look like rudolph. Great fun to make with kids.

I agree with other posters, this recipe is also called "Haystacks".  My grandmother made them and I continue to do so.  I make a batch of chocolate ones also.  Just use chocolate chips instead.  
Great recipe. :)

This recipe really surprised and impressed me. The limited ingredients gave me doubts and i am not a buttersctotch fan, I also had the urge to throw in some raisins in half the batch. That was amazing to me! I would recommend it if you tried half and half some with raisins some without.I also popped them in the freezer for ten minutes, they pop right off the foil and you are left with one pot and one spoon to clean!!!!

These are really good and really easy to make.  I used to eat these all the time as a kid.  Try it with marshmallows instead of peanuts...I think it tastes better that way.  I didn't have enough butterscotch chips when I made it so I used half peanutbutter chips and half butterscotch.  Delicious!

I used a ratio of 2 parts butterscotch to 1 part chocolate.  They were great!  Added mini marshmellows with a touch of black get to turn them into "creatures" for halloween.  Big hit

These have been the mainstay of my holiday giving for years, but we always called them Glomp Doodles.  I double the recipe just for us. And due to a nut recipe i leave the nuts out and use the artificially flavored peanut butter chips.

i substituted 1/2 semi sweet chocolate chips in place of all butterscotch ones.  I also used only half the amount of peanuts.  They don't look very good, but do taste good.

I am not a big fan of the ingredients separately but together this made one incredible cookie. Super easy & fast too. Would love to try w/ other flavor chips. Highly recommend.

Used generic butterscotch and found it very difficult to melt.  The oils separated making a lumpy mess.  BUT even though the clusters barely held together, they were delicious.  Next time I'll try name brand!

These are one of the easiest dessert recipes I make. I don't have an oven so I am always looking for no bake recipes.  I use the microwave instead of a double boiler, put the chips in for about 45sec - 1 minute and stir, repeat this until they are melted. I also put them in the freezer instead of the refrigerator after dropping onto the wax paper much easier to deal with.  Great with any flavor chip

Excellent!  And so easy to make.  Didn't change a thing.  I got way more than 24 though - maybe I made mine too small, but you can eat one with two bites!

I love this! especially because I always buy the big bag of chow mein noodles (cheaper that way) and they get stale if I just use them for Chinese food. Good way to use up some of the noodles!

I always enjoy making these cookies, they're simple, fast, and delicious.  They're great if you're in a hurry to make cookies for an office party tomorrow.  Or if you just need to satisfy your sweet took NOW!

A real crowd pleaser (young and old)!  Wonderful for summer dessert because there isn't a hot oven involved.  Very tasty! Enjoy...

I received these about 10 years ago in a Chrismas goodie tin from my boss.  I couldn't for the life of me figure out what they were made of but I loved them.  I figured out the noodle and butterscotch years later, but never dreamed that was pretty much about it.  Yum, yum, and who would have thought they only had three ingredients!

I replace the chow mein noodles with Fiber One cereal.  I also omit the peanuts to keep it healthy.  Very simple recipe and no one will know the difference between using Fiber One cereal or chow mein noodles.

I've made these for years, except I add paraffin wax to make it smooth.  I shape them into birds nests, and after it dries I add robins egg candies(speckled malt balls). Great for kids to take to school in the spring!

Very addictive....be careful!!  I added some white chocolate chips to this, about 1/2 cup, because I didn't have enough butterscotch chips.  I also added about 1 cup more chow mein noodles.  So delicious!! Very rich, though.  Great w/a cup of coffee!!

I love this recipe.  There is something about the chocolate and butterscotch combining together.  I have also done chocolate and peanut butter chips which is also totally awesome.  They were a big hit at the office and with my family.  Have fun playing with this recipe.  Lori O.

My husband really likes these. I think they are o.k. I don't like butterscotch so I used semi sweet chips. I also microwaved the chips. I am sure my husband will reqeust these again. Thanks for posting.

I must admit I was skeptical, but I had some chow mein noodles in the cabinet that were just going stale,so I said what the hay! I'll try it! I used salted cashews, because that's what I had on hand. They were still delicious!

I made these to send to my son who is in the Marines and is stationed in Japan. They were very easy to make and were real good, just make sure you have a glass of cold milk to drink while eating them because they are rich.

These were so good. I love the sweet/salty combination. I made these along with about 6 other completely different types of cookie recipes for entertaining during Christmas and I think this is my favorite one of all. I will continue to make these every Christmas.

I've been making these for years, using corn flakes rather than chow mein noodles.  They were dubbed "Scooby Snacks" by a friend of mine, because we just never had a name for them.  One day he just said..."Give me one of those ...uhhh....Scooby Snacks." and the name stuck.  Amazingly simple, and incredibly good.  Watch out they're VERY addictive. =)

This is a very yummy treat!  It taste just like candy!  DELICIOUS!  The only problem is cleaning out the pot and keeping everyone from eating them!

These are really good.  I prefer to use chocolate chips.
