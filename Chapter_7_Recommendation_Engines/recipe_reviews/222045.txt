What a great way to dress up fresh green beans!The only thing I changed was instead of using a fresh tomato I used a can of diced tomatoes. Will be keeping this recipe in my file for future use.

Awesome! Thank you for making a healthy dish which was amazing....  I only changed a little bit because I didn't have red pepper flakes or ground thyme...  I added fresh of both... I am certain both are just as good, it's just what I had...

This was amazing. The picture showed the beets, so I roasted the beets (wrapped individually in foil @ 400 degree oven for an hour - I used my toaster oven.)and added them when I added the tomatoes. I used balsamic vinegar and left out the pepper flakes. Definitely will make it again.

I made two changes one minor - I substituted balsamic vinegar in place of the cider and one fairly major.  I used roasted beets instead of chopped tomato.  I am sure I will like it with tomato.  Thanks PBJGirl!

Very good (my kids didn't like it but they ate it, without making faces, so that is a compliment. We let them add some Parmesan cheese). We parents, however, really enjoyed this. A more creative way to eat beet greens and thankfully easy, (but we left out the red pepper flakes). We always use the whole vegetable, so this was one of three dishes from one bunch of beets. (I removed all the stems, chopped them up and put them in meatballs and found a roasted beet recipe here too.) I do wonder, what this recipe would be like with the chopped beets added. Kicking myself for not taking a pic - it's a good looking dish too.

Great combination of flavors!  I didn't have a tomato, so I poured a little pasta sauce in, and it was great!

With Beet Greens and Green Beans straight out of the garden this was a great dish!  I added less vinegar, will be making this one again!

Delicious ! I used only 1 Tbl oil and as others did, balsamic vinegar. I like it spicy so doubled the red pepper flakes. This recipe will be made again!

Took this dish to a BBQ and everyone kept saying they loved the flavour and were surprised at the blend of veggies! All the veggies were fresh from the garden so rhe tastes were fantastic! Yes I would make it again for sure.

Loved it!  I threw in some mushrooms and used cranberry-pear vinegar which was delicious.  I used cayenne pepper and it was a really nice, subtle kick.

Outstanding! I had to modify mine a bit. Used 2 cans of cut green beans (drained), organic cut beets, boiled, used balsamic vinegar, can of diced tomatoes and just the broth from cambles chicken noodle soup. Cooked the garlic and onion together and three it all together for 40 minutes simmer. Unbelievable unique taste.
Thank you

wow this was wonderful.. i am not ashamed to admit that i licked the plate clean.. i was really worried bc i'm not a huge fan of ground thyme and seeing as how that was the only herb in the recipe, i was worried it would overpower everything else.. thankfully i was wrong.. i used chopped asparagus for the green beans but kept everything else the same.. ty so much for the recipe

Wow! I don't like cooked green beans, but this was good! I used balsamic vinegar based on preference. It was a fresh flavor that went well with my pork loin.
