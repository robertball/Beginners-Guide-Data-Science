My British houseguest says these are exactly like his mum's, and my 11-year-old devoured them, so I guess that's four thumbs up!

I've been looking for years for a really good hot cross bun recipe for my husband for Good Friday and this is it! I used my heavy mixer with dough hook for the kneading so it was easy to make and the texture and flavor were authentic. This is the recipe I'll use from now on!

I just made these and the dough didn't rise much at all. I used the same yeast I've made bread with several times in the past month. It worked fine then. Any suggestions?
