I made this as an add-on to an antipasti platter last night. To put it simply, this was excellent and something I would make again. I followed the recipe exactly as written with a couple of modifications:  1. I used a fork to blend the mixture together forming something that had a much more pleasant texture and look. 2.  The recipe calls for unsalted butter. I did not have this available so I used regular salted butter.  I believe this made the tuna a bit more salty then one would like. Not overly salty but I always follow the rule you can add more after you taste but you can't take it out.  Definitely something that's easy to make, quick and an extremely tasty add-on to any grazing platter.

This is such a refreshing, tasty tuna dish. Put on crackers, make sandwich, such a versatile recipe. Love the addition of the capers.

I thought this was delicious.  I cut the butter to 2 Tbs, added a splash of olive oil, used two 3oz cans of tuna in olive oil, increased the Italian parsley to 1 C, added 1/2 C green onions, and increased the lemon to whatever comes out of half a lemon, about 2 Tbs. We served on toasted pumpernickel bagel halves with mini bell peppers on the side.  MMmmmm. The kiddos loved it too.

I made this for lunch today. I don't know when this recipe was written, but a lot of tuna now comes in packets. Guess, they couldn't keep reducing the can size. It is typically about 2.6 oz instead of 4.5 oz called for in the recipe. I had only one packet, so I cut the recipe back to 2 servings or sandwiches. I also followed the serving advice on making it into a sandwich. I made it according to directions but used olives instead of capers. I would like to try it again with the capers. I think they would be the perfect compliment. I have seen similar tuna spreads under French recipes. They typically call for olive oil instead of the butter, are usually made with olives, and have seen the tuna sandwiches with sliced boiled eggs. This is the closest I could find after another recipe dissapeared from the site, that I had planned to try. It was quick, easy, healthy, and a nice change from tuna with mayonnaise.

I used one of those very small 3-oz cans of tuna in olive oil, (Italian brand....love those, great on a salad). I used 2 tblsp of butter and added everything else to my preference. I just mixed this all  up with a fork, which gave it, IMO, more texture (worked just fine). I used parsley from a plant that I recently purchased, and that was a treat! This was great on crackers with a little vino on the side! I highly recommend this spread!
