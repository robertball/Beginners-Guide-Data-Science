I would not recommend this recipe. It cooked improperly,and due to the celery on the bottom, it braised, rather than cooked-- not something I would normally do to chicken or hens. It didn't specify which side 'up', and despite the celery, I cooked it breast side up, which left the breast at least browned, but somewhat dry. The dark meat was cooked and tasty so far as herbs, but very unappetizing looking and not remotely browned, since it was braised, rather than roasted. I wouldn't do that unless it was cooked breast side down, and turned over for browning in the last 20 mins or so. Disappointing, overall. Almost like the person who wrote down the recipe put the effort in, but forgot key aspects. I would lose the lemon inside (overkill) add more garlic (inside and outside) and use less liquid, which I believe is why it took at least 30 mins longer than the recipe stated. Seasonings were right on, but cooking methods and instructions were poor. I wouldn't ever make this again.

This is absolutely one of the best recipes I have made. I took the celery, juices, garlic, white pepper, and onions and made a sauce for the meat using a blender. I thickened it with flour & butter. I did add more chicken stock, however. This is absolutely fantastic. I usually dislike cornish hens, but no more. I think this is a brilliant idea to cook meat on celery and add all these herbs. Thank you to chef, who thought of this idea. A wonderful treat! Make the gravy!

Very YummyYummy! 
Had to adjust the cooking time kus I only made 2 hens. I used only Thyme for the herb and stuffed some of it in the cavities along with the lemon and onion. Very Good!

Amazing! Made for non traditional thanksgiving, next time will cut the recipe in half, one hen is enough for two people.

Couldn't have been more pleased. I used these for a medieval feast. I marinated each chicken in the olive oil and herbs overnight and they turned out awesome. I substituted Herbes De Provence (savory, rosemary, marjoram, thyme, basil and lavendar flowers) for a slightly different twist on flavor and simply basted with chicken broth rather than the wine sauce since some of my guests had dietary resrtrictions concerning the use of wine. I will definitely make these again.

Didn't use as much lemon. Added black pepper and garlic inside the hen. Was very good, put in oven at 450 for 10 minutes first, then dropped down to 350. Had to cook for about an hour and a half though as the dark meat wasn't cooked all the way through. Made two hens.

Very good and fairly easy to prepare. Only used one game hen, which fed two of us nicely. The meat was tender, juicy and tasty. My only issue was that the skin didn't crisp up as much as I'd like. Next time, and there will be one, I'll try a few minutes of broiling before serving.

What a hit. Roasted my hens with sweet potatoes, carrots, garlic cloves, onions, and cherry tomatoes. Such a beautiful, rustic dish.

Had to adjust the recipe a bit because my local supermarket doesn't sell lemon pepper or tarragon.  Cooked this for my fianc√©s birthday and we both loved it!
