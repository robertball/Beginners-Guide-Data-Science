UPDATE 07/2008:  I've been making this for 4 years now, and have a tip for you.  I clean and trim 2 "super-club paks" of chicken and put 5-6 pieces into four separate ziplocs.  I double the marinade, divide it evenly into each of the bags, stick one bag in the fridge to marinate for dinner, and the other 3 into the freezer.  Next time I need chicken to grill, I grab one of these and let it thaw in the marinade - Fast and fabulous!! END. This name should be changed to "Easiest Ever Super Tasty Grilled Chicken"!!  I have to admit, I was concerned that this might be bland since the marinating time was so short, but I was delightfully surprised.  My 9 year old (who "hates spicy food") proclaimed that it was one of his favorite meals.  If you're a working mother, this is one of those last minute no brainer meals.  If you're like me, and you didn't have time to put something in the crockpot in the morning, or you forgot to marinate something overnight, this is the recipe for you!!  And once you have all those spices on hand, you'll have them for a while, so you won't likely to be short an ingredient.   This is one of our new standbys!!!  Now, if I can just rack up a few more of those... !

I've made this 3 times in the past month - everyone asks for the recipe.  The only change I made is decreasing the oil to about 1 1/4 cup, and I used olive oil instead of vegetable.  Thanks.

This chicken is so good!  I use Cajun Seasoning Mix from this site for the cajun seasoning.  Definitely use olive oil vs. vegetable oil. I have made this twice now and it has come out tender, moist and full of flavor each time.

YUM!!!  This chicken is fantastic.  I only made a couple changes.  I cut down on the oil and I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours.  A few reviewers were complaining that this was a little salty but I used Mrs Dash lemon pepper which is no salt and just used regular Cajun seasoning.  Then I threw it on the grill.  FANTASTIC!!!

This recipe was HUGE, so I halved everything.  One change I made was to use the full amount of garlic pwdr. called for and I really feel if I hadn't used the 1/2 tablespoon, the chicken would have been a little bland. I have 7 children and they ALL loved this recipe, so the flavors were pretty mild.  I will try this recipe again.

It was raining the night I made this, so I put these in the broiler for 20 minutes and they were awesome served with BBQ sauce.

This was SO simple, yet so yummy!  I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the oil back to 3/4th of a cup but kept all the spices the same.  I added 5 BLSL chicken thighs to the marinade.  Baked it in a foil lined 9X13 pan at 450 degrees for 35+ minutes.  This was served over baby spring mix, tomato wedges, and chopped veggies.  We bought some cajun seasoning when we were on vacation in New Orleans, so our chicken had some kick, but not too much.  This tasted salty, even though I didn't add any additional salt, so keep that in mind.  Thanks for sharing your great recipe, Wood!

One of THE best grilled chicken recipes around. Although the name says "cajun" this recipe is mild enough for even the most sensitive palatte, and yet exquisitely delicate for the grilling connoisseur. Easy to make and tastes wonderful. A word of warning though, cooking this over charcoal generates a TON of white smoke (because of the oil), so use in a well ventilated area (if you're using charcoal, I hope you would anyway ;).

this recipe is absolutly wonderful. There isn't enough spice in it to make you turn away from it. Its got the necessary amount of pizzazz to it. Thanks for sharing woody. I also went with the lady from chicago who used the george forman grille. Way too cold in ohio in january to use the grill. I also think that the george forman helped keep the flavor in the chicken. Thanks for the GREAT recipe

Many times seasonings tend to overshadow the taste of the meat.  In this case, the marinade complemented the subtle taste of chicken.  I used less oil than called for in the recipe and this didn't seem to hurt at all as the chicken was very moist.   I always prefer bone-in rather than boneless chicken breasts which is what I used this time.

Just wanted to clarify something on the "Cajun Spice" / too salty debate for those of you using Tony's, Konrikos, or similiar spices (Which are the most incredible multipurpose seasoners -  a restaurant secret for amping up all sorts of cuisines!). These are actually labeled Creole and tend to be much saltier. Either stick with those and drop the amount a little or use an "Emeril" type Cajun Seasoning which tend to have more herbs and spices than salt. Either way a great recipe!

Very good! I think I like it better than the Chili's Cajun Chicken recipe. I topped it over Bertolli Alfredo Sauce and finished it off with Shredded Parmesan. My husband  loved it! This is a keeper!

I was surprised at how good this came out.  I made it at a family gathering as an alternative to the ribs I made and didn't expect it to be such a big hit.  The spice mixture seemed strange to me but tasted great.  Something to note...a previous reviwer was concerned about heating the oil in a pan over med. high heat...this recipe is for grilling.  The oil is for the marinade.  You need to pull the chicken out and discard the remaining oil.  Tonight I'll be trying the recipe out on my George Foreman. I'm sure it will be as delicious as it was on our gas grill.

This is a nice recipe.  Instead of using garlic powder though i used a couple of fresh cloves of garlic, which we love! When i buy extra chicken to freeze i prepare the marinade ahead of time & put it on the chicken first....soo easy that way & less prep time.....thanks

Lemon Pepper has both salt and sugar in store bought. Cajun and Italian seasoning sometimes has salt.  I have Cajun and Italian without salt and sugar that I can have. For the lemon pepper I use grated lemon rind. I would use extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I have use this recipe and everyone loved it. I added just a little bit more of each seasoning just to be able to have more flavor. Thank you for the recipe.

I followed this exactly, although I had to make my own Cajun blend. We marinated some chicken tenders for 30 mins. and then grilled on my cast iron grill pan.  We had it sliced on top of a mixed salad with a light dressing and it was delicious! I wish I'd made extra and I will next time because this is a very versatile recipe. Leftovers would make interesting chicken salad, soft tacos, soups, buffalo chicken dip and such. Thank you for sharing! :o)

Wow this was good!  Do not make the mistake of salting/adding pepper to the chicken prior to marinating as it doesn't need it.  Also I more than halfed the amount of oil and only marinaded the chicken for barely 20 minutes and it turned out just fine.  Great recipe!

Very quick and simple to prepare.  I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil.  Baked thin cut breasts for about 20 mins @375, but 15 mins would have been better.  Yum!

We really enjoyed this chicken!  I subbed EVOO for veggie oil and left out the lemon pepper, per personal preference.  Mr. LTH grilled it to perfection and we ate on top of fresh veggie salads.  Delectable.  We will be enjoying these on a regular basis.  TY for a great recipe!

Loved this chicken dish!  The flavor was wonderful.  I did not have lemon pepper so instead added some lemon juice and fresh cracked black pepper.  WONDERFUL!  I made two extra breasts to cut up and serve in a salad for lunch tomorrow!

This recipe is so easy and tastes great! My husband is normally a "burger guy". He said this was so good he always wants to have his chicken fixed this way. By the way the cajun seasoning does not make it "hot". My 4 year old can eat this also. Great recipe!

This was good, not great, but good.  It kept the chicken moist.  I cut way back on the oil only using 1/2 cup vegi oil and 1/2 cup olive oil.

Really, really good. The only thing different I did was use less oil.  I only used 1 cup but 3/4 c. might be enough too, and I baked the chicken at 350 F until the juices ran clear (didn't feel like bundling up to BBQ in the snow).  It was a big hit with our guests.  One of the fellows asked for the recipe right away and was making it the following weekend.

This chicken came out very moist and tasty. Just don't expect it to be extremely spicy, because I used only 1 cup of vegetable oil, and even still it wasnt very "hot." I was still very pleased with the results and will definitely make this again!

I gave this one five stars even though I did not grill it.  I actually just pan seared the chicken with the vegetable oil marinade...it came out very tender!  I would love to have had a grill as I believe it would have been even better!  Thanx!

Really great! Although my husband was disappointed it didn't have more "kick", my 2 and 6 year olds ate it up!  Instead of grilling outside (it's cold here in the Chicago area), I used the George Foreman grill, and it worked really well!  Thanks for a tasty recipe!

AMAZING CHICKEN for salad and we use it to make spicy chicken salad also.  Throw a teaspoon of cayenne in for some fire.  Our Walmart carries the super thin cut breasts so we use those and don't have to pound the chicken.  Awesome recipe.  THANKS!  My wife is Cajun and can't get enough.

Wow! I did alter it just a little.  First, I used thighs instead of breasts. I like the moistness and flavor of thighs vs. breasts. Plus  there is no need to pound them to thin them out. I used a combination of olive oil and canola oil using mostly Olive oil.  I cut down the amount of oil as well.  Added some onion powder.  Marinated it for about 2 hours. I than grilled the meat indirectly.  I preheated the whole grill on high, than turned off half of the grill. Lowered the other half to medium.  I put the chicken on the half that was off.    I turned them over in about 15 minutes, basted it with remaining marinade and grilled about about 10 to 15 minutes longer.  I served with angel hair pasta that I sauted with butter, fresh garlic, dried rosemary and a roma tomato.  Oh...because I like it heat, I threw some dried chili peppers in the saute.  Yummy!!

Not my favorite chicken dish, but good.  I scaled it down to 2 servings and marinated it most of the day.  Since today was cold and rainy, I baked it in the oven instead of grilling it.  I expected to taste a strong cajun flavor, but the lemon pepper was the predominant flavor.

I made the recipe exactly as written, only changes was I made them in Kabobs.  These were just ok, nothing special really.  I've had far better cajun chicken recipes.  Pleased I made this, as a quick and simple recipe but its not a recipe I will be keeping.

This chicken has a wonderful flavor. I reduced the oil(used olive oil) to 1 cup and mixed all in a ziploc bag. I also did not pound the chicken breasts. The seasoning turned into more of a paste than a liquid marinade. I left the chicken in the paste for about 1 1/2 hours, then grilled them. Not too spicey, just right. Served with Greek Potatoes from this site and a tossed salad. Made a wonderfully light meal!

Pretty good flavor and a bit different.  I used olive oil and was probably pretty liberal with the garlic powder (tho I don't recall) but all the measurements were as is.  I boiled the leftover marinade and then kept brushing it on while grilling.  Despite the date on here, this actually got made a couple of months ago, outside on my charcoal grill.  Really, the only reason this wasn't a 5 is cause it wasn't enough of a wow to account for what, to me, was a hassle (pounding out the chicken and things burns easily on the grill, etc.).
EDIT: I recently made this again but didn't care to grill. So I just cooked it in the oven in the pan I marinaded in w/foil covering. Keeps it nice and moist, and you can just leave all that oil behind.  Or... this is really good flavor w/potatoes, so wedges can be thrown into the same pan & stirred around in the marinade.  Really good that way.

Loved it!  Beware of different cajun seasonings though.  Tried it with a few diffrent mixes of cajun spices.  Flavors really vary.  Great marinade that adds just enough juice and spice.  A side of fresh fruit is a must.

This cajun marinade is absolutely excellent. The chicken was delicious, full of flavor, and was extremely easy to prepare. For a rich flavor profile, try marinading the chicken 2 hours before cooking or even overnight. The more time the spices sit with the chicken, the more flavor will be absorbed and will come out with that first bite.

This was great, juicy chicken! For a lower fat version (and for those who say there is too much oil), spray chicken w/ olive oil COOKING SPRAY instead and then add heavy seasonings & marinate... it worked perfect for me and I didn't have to use all that oil! I added some garlic salt and creole seasoning too! I recommend this recipe to everyone for an easy, simple grilled chicken recipe!

This is an awesome recipe!!  I use olive oil instead of veggie oil and I have used it for pork chops as well as chicken.  I have made this for my husband, my family, his family and large  parties of our friends too ...nothing left on anyone's plate.

I made this last night and yum, yum!  I followed the receipe exact, except I used olive oil infused with lemon (I used Emeril's cajun spice recipe).  I only used 4 breasts and didn't even pound them out, bbq'd them and it was an absolute delightful flavor.  I will definitely make this again and I'm sharing it today with two workmates. Thank you for the great recipe!

This was really good. I used a ziploc bag instead of a dish and used only 1/3 of the oil and twice the amount of cajun seasoning. Then I just added in the chicken, closed the bag, and massaged the bag around for a bit so that all the seasonings covered the chicken. I cooked it on my George Foreman grill. I think doubling the cajun gave the chicken the perfect amount of spice!

I have a son who is truly a picky eater. Getting him to eat chicken is really hard. The only changes I made are cutting  this recipe in half and using 2 cloves of crushed garlic and a sprinkle of garlic powder. I gave him the usual half of a piece and he wound up eating almost 2 pieces. In my books that is totally amazing and I plan to record it next time to prove to family who won't believe it.
Thank you so much for this recipe. It will definately be on my usual list from now on. I would give this a ten if I could.

I'd never cooked on a grill until I got this recipe, now I love to, especially with this recipe.  While this is grilling I'll also throw on some baked potatoes or some veggie packets to steam.  It's not what I consider "cajun" but it is very tastey!

This is a nice kick of spice for chicken.  We've tried it on boneless breasts as well as on chicken wings.  It's good by itself and really good with bbq sauce.  It makes the bbq sauce like a spicy bbq.

Loved this! Like others said it was a little salty, but I like salt, so maybe I will cut down the cajun seasoning a little next time to see if it has the same WOW to it. Had such wonderful flavors! I do want to add that I used a lot less oil. I cut the recipe in half and it then called for 1 cup oil, so I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup water, perfect amount. I used the leftover breast for a southwest salad the next day for lunch, yummy!

Easy.  Don't need as much oil as called for, we only used 1/4c & could possibly use less. It did taste alittle more Italian than Cajun, but I supposed could always use less Italian seasoning, but for now I won't.

We've made this several times and the first time I followed the recipe as shown. Then in order to cut down on the fat & calories, I dried the breasts using a paper towel, sprayed the chicken breasts with PAM and then spread the dry ingredients over both sides and then let them set for 30 minutes.  We can't taste the difference between this and marinating. According to my calorie calculating tool, each 3 oz. serving is about 105 calories.
This chicken is really good the next day in chef salad.

Every time I make this recipe for guests, I'm asked for a copy of it.  I use chicken tenders and put them on skewers.  The meat is always so moist and tender.  I also use this recipe for shrimp, and  think the shrimp is even better (if that's possible).  It's my "go-to" recipe for grilling.

4 stars after tweaking. easy. fast. i used cajun seasoning & lemon pepper both with no salt. i used garlic salt, not garlic powder. i reduced oil to 1 cup & used 4 breasts. i kept the spice measures the same - We like spicy. I added black pepper to the marinade. Marinated for 40 minutes. Ran out of propane right as I was going to put them on the grill - so I fried them (oil & all) in a pre-heated cast iron skillet. They were outstanding. Moist, tender, juicy & delicious. Thanks!

B/c it wasn't great grilling weather today, I ended up following the instructions and just baking it for 30 mins. at 350 degrees and it was great.  Flavorful.  I actually didn't have "cajun seasoning" handy but had "creole seasoning" to substitute.  It was still good.

This recipe was wonderful. I have recently started enjoying spicier foods, and this had a kick but tolerable for me and my 2 year old. I also used the cajun seasoning mix recipe from this site and I did add a squeeze of fresh lemon and a little less of the lemon/pepper, very savory and tender. I put a couple in freezer bags for another time. it's a simple and a keeper!

Delicious! I slice my chicken breasts horizontally instead of pounding them (too much work!) - I cooked part of them in the oven and part on the grill. When I put them on the grill, I got LOTS of fire from the vegetable oil - so my chicken came out a little grey from the smoke. Still tasted great, just didn't look too good. The chicken I cooked in the oven came out great - 375 for 30 minutes!  I will definitely make this again!

I only used 1 cup of oil and broiled the chicken for 20 minutes instead of grilling.  Like other reviewers, I agree that the chicken was too salty, but it was moist, and my family did like the flavor a lot.  It was not too spicy not even for my 10 year old. Next time I will use only about a 1/2 cup of oil and use unsalted cajun seasoning or unsalted lemon/pepper so there's not a double dose of salt.

This was just OK for us.  Other than cutting the amount of oil in half, I followed the recipe but found that this just wasn't very flavorful.  It was fine, but I won't be making it again.

Reduced to only 3 servings and reduced the oil even more.  The chicken turned out moist but even after sitting the marinade for over 24 hours still didn't have a lot of flavor.  Will try again but will adjust the seasonings.

It was so hot outside, this was the perfect recipe for not heating up the house, and all the ingredients were on hand for me.  The chicken was SUPER moist, we loved it.  Served atop a large dinner salad.  A simple, yet delicious, and healthy dinner.

Highly recommend for a fast weekday dinner!  I wanted a new, but quick, easy recipe for chicken without having to run to the store for ingredients.  This was great!  Just a few ingredients, a quick marinade time, add a simple side dish and you're done....and it tasted great!  There were comments in other reviews of this turning out too salty, but there are several low sodium cajun seasonings readily available at the grocery... no need to sacrifice flavor by lessening the "cajun" spice.  Next time I will try it marinated all day or overnight!  (But it turned out great even with just the 20 minutes or so I did this time.)  Check out my photo soon on the photos page!

This gets raves every time I make it. I adjust quantities some times or put in another seasoning, instead of cajun. I like to mix the marinade and put all in a freezer bag in the fridge, for less mess. Also I freeze boneless, skinless chicken thighs in this in freezer bags. I always use thighs. Very good recipe, thanks

Easy to make and very tasty. I marinate for 6 hours. Also marinated red potatoes and grilled them and they were even better then the chicken. Served with cajun corn on the cob (corn in husk coated with fat free butter & cajun seasoning and grilled in foil packet) Soooo gooooodd!

Very moist and tasty.  I used olive oil instead of veggie and used 4 tbspns of lemon juice instead of the lemon pepper, and added 2 garlic crushed garlic cloves.  Spicy without real heat.

This recipe was quick easy & tasty, but the cooking times are NOT RIGHT...in fact it would be a HAZARD to heat oil in a pan over high heat for 15 minutes!!!  Can you say grease fire?

Excellent.  I grilled my chicken and served it on top of a ceasar salad as suggested.  My husband and I both loved it!  Thank You.

Super easy and my husband loved it.  I - however - found it WAY too salty.  We had dinner a few hours ago and I'm still guzzling water... I may make it again and try to adjust somehow to decrease saltiness.

This is a really good recipe, I used olive oil and scaled back the measurements because I was cooking a smaller quantity. Marinated for about 30 minutes then tossed it on the George Foreman for about 10 minutes...quick & yummy!

Great. Used the Simple Cajun Seasoning recipe from this site (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Simple-Cajun-Seasoning/Detail.aspx). I didn't pound the chicken flat, but I will next time.

I made this just as said and cooked half of it in my George Foreman Grill and it came out tasty and spicy, but not too spicy.  After letting the other half of the chicken marinate for 2 more days, WOW, did it taste fantastic.   From now on I am letting it marinate for 2 days.

This was super easy to make. I used the cajun seasoning recipe from this site, so it wasn't too salty. I cut down on the oil and used olive oil, plus I used boneless, skinless thighs instead. Otherwise, I used all the same ingredients and it turned out great. Need to add a couple minutes more on the grill, if you use thighs. My family all liked it, but we thought it was a little mild in taste, so I might add some more cajun seasoning or red pepper flakes next time. Great recipe! We had it for our Mardi Gras meal with some black beans and rice.

I tried the recipe exactly as written EXCEPT it was pouring outside so I cooked the chicken in an iron pan.  The seasoning didn't seem to stick making the chicken taste rather bland, so I wouldn't recommend this cooking method.  Will try it again on the grill and expect to have much better results!

This was one of the best chicken recipes I've made in a long time.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well all of the flavors melded!  I substituted less than a 1/3 cup of olive oil and the chicken still came out great.  This will definitely be added to the grill rotation this summer. :)

I made this recipe for Memorial day and it was a big hit. I only had 5 boneless chicken breasts, so I cut the oil and seasonings in half. I marinated the chicken over night and the taste was out of this world. This will be a wonderful addition to my chicken recipes.

I really enjoyed this chicken!  The first time, I fried it because I didn't feel like firing up the grill (in March in Canada) and it didn't wow me.  But I had doubled the recipe and frozen some so I gave it another go, this time on the BBQ and it was AMAZING!  So moist!  Awesome!  
I found that the cajun seasoning that I have isn't actually very spicy.  I would have preferred more cajun seasoning so I have purchased a different brand/mix of seasoning and will use that next time.
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

We used chicken legs, 1 cup EVOO and the "cajun spice mix" from this site.  Made everything else as directed.  We let the chicken marinate a couple of hours.  Very moist and juicy chicken with a little kick.

Sorry, but this one didn’t impress us at all.  It was edible, certainly, but we both thought it really lacked pizzazz.  It was quick and easy; I’ll give it that.

Moist and delicious!  I followed the recipe but used chicken pieces which just took a bit longer to grill but was well worth it.  The marinade coated the pieces well.  Everyone loved this recipe and I am anxious to use it again.

I didn't think the marinade added enough flavor.  Maybe if you marinade longer it is better.   I also cooked on an indoor grill and think maybe charcoal would have been better.

This was a good dish,other dishes that are similar,claim they are spicy,this one was! I was pleasently surprized,the only thing I did different was well,besides subbing olive oil for veggie oil,I did liquid italian dressing,I was afraid of it being to salty. Everyone who tries this dish should like it.

Wonderful and full of flavor. I marinated the chicken overnight and added cayenne pepper to the marinade. This was awesome chicken..Nice, flavorful, spicy, and juicy. Thanks for this recipe. We will definitely make this again!

I usually use half the oil and just brush it on the chicken. This also tastes delicious using Greek seasoning instead of the Cajun seasoning. Good on pork, too.

Amazing! I prepare this exactly as is, with the only except being that I marinate it for four or more hours. It's very tasty, with just the right amount of zing to it. Thanks!

Tasted great and was very moist. I only marinated for 15 minutes. I put it in the oven at 400 for 35 minutes. I also made it with the cajun roasted potatoes.

This was DELICIOUS! I halved the recipe and had plenty of marinade for 5 breasts. It makes a lot! Added a clove of garlic and a pinch of salt. I think the longer they stay in the marinade the better they are! (3 hrs. min.) Thanks!!

Superior. I would give it 10 stars if I could. The only thing different I added was a little white wine. I didn't have lemon pepper, I had garlic pepper so I used it and added lemon juice instead, and used EVOO instead of veggie oil. Tasted like Outback's Chicken on the Barbie. I marinated them for about 4 hours, cooked them out on the grill and basted them with left over marinade. You won't be sorry to try this! YUMMY!!!

This is my go to recipe for fast and yummy chicken.  Its also really good even if you don’t have lemon pepper or Italian spices on hand.  I also use a lot less oil.  Just brush some on the chicken lightly.  If you don’t have Cajun seasoning, this site has some really great recipes for it which is great because you can control the level of spiciness.

Delicious! I marinated the chicken over night in a zip lock bag (shaking it occasional). I also used olive oil and cooked it on the George Foreman as I live in rainy ole England. The only draw back is that I didn't think it had enough flavor. I know as crazy as that sounds considering all the seasonings that are in the recipe. Perhaps next time I'll add just a tiny bit more of everything.

5 star no doubt about it.  1st of all I made half of the marinade because I only had 6 chicken breast and it was plenty of marinade, 2nd I used olive oil, and finally I refrigerated mine for about 5hrs.  They came out very tender and moist.  I will make this again and when I do I will probably put a little bit more Cajun seasoning.  Thank so much for the great recipe Wood Halsey.

This was really good, except that it was very salty.. Next time, I'll make sure to buy cajun seasoning that is salt-free.

I scaled this recipe to 5 servings and I think it was a little salty caused by the Lemon Pepper.  The Lemon Pepper was very over powering with the 1 Tablespoon that it asked for.  I couldn't really taste the cajun because of it.  I used my George Foreman grill, was very juicy and overall I just think that the Lemon Pepper should be reduced by 1/2.  I will make this again.  Thanks.

The recipe was good but turned out a little salty. I think that was because of the type of Cajun seasoning that I used (Tabasco Cajun seasoning). I think I will use a different brand next time and that should help. Overall very easy and quick to make.

This was very good.  My children didn't find it too spicy.  I didn't find it spicy enough.  The second time I made it, I used less oil and made more of a paste.  Then I rubbed the chicken with it and let them sit for about 1 hour.  I cooked the chicken on the George Forman Grill and it turned out much better the second time.  I'll keep tweeking with the recipe.

I used the chicken tenders and marinated overnight.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't love or hate as is, but it will be good with salad or sandwich because you'll add dressing and other stuff.  It was definitely super easy to make and maybe using more expensive spices might help the flavor (I used those cheapy kinds).

This is our favorite go-to recipe for chicken.  It is easy, tasty and quick. We cut down on the oil a little and we use pounded chicken. We have tried it marinated for only 20 minutes, tried it marinated overnight and have also tried it frozen with the chicken and let it marinate as it thaws. It has ALWAYS come through with flavor. Thank you for a great never-fail recipe.

I have used this as a foundation recipe. I am thrilled with the concept, but, instead of veg oil, i used coconut oil and instead of the lemon pepper mix, i used ground exotic pepper and REAL lemon juice to taste. I am a single person so I also cut my chicken breast into small pieces and it`s perfect on/cold or hot with a salad. thanks

I used Italian salad dressing mix instead of Italian seasoning. Did this on accident. Turned out great.

VERY tasty; I marinated, then froze for a few weeks. Took the package (10 pounded breasts work well into a 2 1/2 gallon zip lock baggie) out of the freezer and thawed in the refrigerator a day ahead, then proceeded to grill. SO GOOD!

I needed a quick recipe since we had company who stayed longer than anticipated. I ran across this and I had everything (except lemon pepper, so I subbed lemon juice and cracked black pepper) on hand, including my salt-free cajun seasoning from this website (Cajun Spice Seasoning Mix in a Jar). I added a bit of salt to it and barbecued. The outside was the perfect combo of spices, and it was nice and crispy! My guests begged me for the recipe. Thanks!

Cajun Chicken Haiku: "This was really great! Marinated longer time. Ate mine on salad." So in all honesty, I was surprised at how good this was, due to its fool-proof ease. I reduced the servings to 1/5, as I was only doing a few chicken tenderloins (which I did on George Foreman), and Wow, again, I was amazed at how tasty this chicken was since the ingredients were so simple. Definitely looking forward to making this again!

This chicken had a good flavor, but way too salty. I will try again and use less cajun seasoning next time.  That should do the trick.

This was a wonderful and different way to cook chicken instead of the old stand by that I usually make. I wasn't sure if the cajun spice was going to be too much for my kids? But everyone loved it, and had second helpings! I passed this onto my folks and they loved it too! Awesome!

This chicken was pretty good. Not as much flavor as I was expecting though. Would be good in a salad, quesadilla, or sandwich.

I don't have a grill, so I used the tip earlier to broil it on high for just over 20 minutes.  I also didn't have any lemon pepper but it still turned out delicious!  And I usually am terrible with chicken.

Reduce the oil by half and this is a great recipe! Marinated for an hour and broiled for about 6-7 minutes on each side.

Wonderful!  We like spicy so I threw in some red pepper flakes for more zip.  Definitly my favorite new bbq chicken recipe and can't wait to make it for company.  Also, I hate over cooked chicken so I pounded it to about 1/2'' thick and then we grilled it for 6 minutes on each side.  You can always zap it in the microwave if neccessary to make sure it is cooked through without drying it out.

This is a delicious chicken recipe.  Something a little different and great for grilling season.  Followed the recipe as suggested, but reduced the oil to 1 cup as other reviewers suggested.  Extremely tender and moist.  Will definitely make again.

When I came home from work, my husband had brought in lots of lettuce from the garden, so I cut the chicken breasts in strips, marinated, and then sauteed the strips in some of the marinade.  We enjoyed them in our salads.  Thanks, Wood!

We really liked this!  I used chicken leg quarters (can't beat $0.59/lb), marinaded the chicken all day and baked at 250 for 45 minutes, then broiled for an additional 5 minutes after that.  The meat was juicy and flavorful.

I used chicken legs/thighs with bone in and skin on.  I let marinade for a couple of hours.  I also used italian dressing along with the italian seasoning.  I did not use veggie oil I used a LITTLE olive oil as chicken legs/thighs have more fat on them.  Hubby grilled these on our charcoal grill.

Sooo salty!  I read previous reviews that said that was a problem so used only half of the cajun seasoning and it was still almost unedible and I love salt.

Great tasting chicken!  I used my own Cajun spice blend and Italian seasoning blend.  I also cut back the oil to 1 cup.  I only had three breasts to marinate, they marinated about 6 hours.  Chicken tastes good hot, warm, or cold!

This is a good recipe, very tasty and turned out moist. I did it under the broiler, and needed less than 20 minutes for sure...just need to watch them so they don't overcook. Nice flavor! I used the the cajun seasoning recipe from this site...saved myself a trip to the store, and a several dollars! Thanks!!

Best grilled chicken ever.  I didn't have any italian seasoning, so I used 1 cup of italian dressing and 1 cup of oil instead.  It turned out great.  My wife and I have probably made this chicken 10 times in the last two months.

I cut the oil down to 3/4 cup and the spices and herbs to half the suggested amount. I also used about 1 tsp. of garlic powder. Next time I will use fresh minced garlic for extra flavor. This was really good alongside 'Healthy Garden Salad' from this site, and some hot crusty baguette.

This recipe was so easy!!  I used olive oil instead of vegetable.  I marinated them for 24 hours, and put them on my George Foreman grill.  They came out awesome! Thanks for the great recipe.

Wow! This was very flavorful and juicy. I used the olive oil and used less of it by 1/3 but kept the spices the same. Still had plenty of volume for immersing the chicken. This will be made often at my house. Thanks so much for an alternative to the same old Italian dressing marinaded chicken.

I did not like this at all. It didn't have much flavor and I always exaggerate the spices.  This one has been deleted from my recipe file.

As so many have said, this is very good!  I have made it many times...marinating the 30 minutes and longer.  I've added a pinch of red pepper flakes to give it a bit more pop.  I also cut the chicken breasts into fingers for quicker cooking and more even portions.

I made these for a bbq yesterday (we decided to do it on the 3rd, not the 4th), and those who tried it loved it--I got asked for the recipe.  We had a lot of different types of meat, so there was some leftover, but it definitely was a hit.  I like that this can be prepared ahead of time and just let marinate until I'm ready for it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was a little concerned by the "lack of smell" after putting all of the ingredients into a lg. ziploc bag with the chicken...I pounded the chicken into large, thin pieces. I left them in the frig for about 6+ hours then grilled them. They were delicious~ the marinade is not overpowering at all just light and good!

Loved this! Have made a few times now. Great grilled chicken recipe! I like to marinade overnight. Gives it extra flavor. Easy and makes great leftovers for salads! Minor change, I reduced the amount of oil and used olive oil instead of the vegetable oil. Loved so much gave to my sister and best friend to try and they loved it as well.  Will make again and again!

I agree that the flavor on this is great, but if you reduce the oil, I think you need to reduce the rest of the marinade as well... otherwise it's a bit strong.

This marinade was good. We liked it.  I added juice from one lemon to the marinade. The only thing i didnt like was that since there were a lot of dried herbs with the thyme and italian seasonings, it got kinda burned on the grill. But other than that it was great. I marinaded it for 3 hours, and it was very juicy and flavorful.

Oh my Gosh!  I wished I had found this recipe a lot sooner.  It was quick and so good.  My guests loved it.  The blend of spices were great.  The only thing I changed on this one was to use about 1 1/4 cups of oil only and I also added juice of 1 lemon.  Outstanding!

Really good chicken.....I scaled it down to 4 chicken breasts and used olive oil instead of veg oil. I marinated for about 3 hours and chicken was moist and very flavorful. Will be serving tonight sliced on salad. Thanks!

Much better than I thought it would be.  Whole family liked it. I cut the cajun spice in half & forgot the garlic powder and it was still great. I agree - it's a bit too salty or strongly seasoned. Reduce spice amounts equally a bit.

Excellent chicken recipe. Pounding the chicken flat first really cut down on the cooking time and kept it from getting dry. It wasn't too spicy either. I used Tupperware's Ragin’ Cajun and their Italian seasoning spice.
I actually marinated it overnight, for convenience sake, and it turned out excellent.

Great chicken, nice flavor, but could have used double the "heat" factor. I served this on a toasted hoagie roll with cajun-mayo and shredded provolone. Very filling as DH and I could have shared one sandwich. These seemed a little salty though so maybe making my own cajun seasoning instead of the storebought kind? Next time I will add some cayenne and maybe double the cajun spice? Great sandwiches, we really enjoyed this, thanks.

I had to cook this on hte Foreman grill as it was storming all day. It came out very moist and flavorful. Husband wasn't so keen on it cold, sliced, in a sandwich the next day - said it 'smelled weird.' Anyway, good stuff. Thanks!

This was excellent! The chicken was incredibly moist, and the flavor was very nice. You could probably tinker with the spices a bit to suit your tastes. This was not really spicy, but it was a very good and easy to make chicken breast. My husband said he would grill this all the time.

I tried this recipe last night on my charcoal grill and it turned out very good. Like other reviewers, I used olive oil and marinated the chicken for about 1 1/2 hours. The chicken was tasty and juicy. The kids especially liked it and asked for more. Great recipe!

My husband made this for dinner and the only differences he made is he used crushed red pepper instead of cajun seasoning and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  It was absolutely wonderful.  Thumbs up to the chef.

I gave this recipe four stars because it was too salty.  I liked it a lot though because I like salty food, but next time I will use less cajun seasoning.

This is such a great and easy recipe.  My family thinks I'm a rock star! I also have cut back on the oil.  I grill out this particular recipe at least twice a month!  The chicken is great in chef salads and also makes a killer chicken salad!  Very versatile!

Great recipe!  Always looking for something different to do for our Sunday Phillies game tailgates, tried these yesterday and they were a hit!  Had some cajun seasoning I got earlier this year at the flower show, so I tried it out.  I did let the chicken marinade overnight and I used olive oil because I did not have veg oil, turned out moist and yummy!  Will definitely make again this summer before a Sunday game!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent.  Like some other reviewers, I decreased the oil slightly, and let it marinate longer.  It didn't seem to matter since there are no acidic ingredients that would begin to "cook" the chicken.  Definitely will make again

I've used this on both chicken and shrimp.  It added a lot of flavor, but was a little salty.  I may have try a different Cajun seasoning next time.  I really liked it with the shrimp.

I had first pulled up this recipe to make cajun salmon.  I could not find any cajun salmon recipes and decided to adapt this one.  The salmon came out fabulous.  I have since made it with chicken as well.  Some changes I made, however, are that I use less oil than the recipe calls for and I make my own Italian Spice using oregano, basil, marjoram, thyme and crushed red pepper.  I usually put in a little more basil and marjoram, since they are a little sweeter.  This is an easy recipe to make, and has been a hit every time I have made it.  And if you have a George Foreman grill or something similar, it is even easier.

Chicken had a very good flavor, although it was very salty.  I added extra cajun spices.  Next time I will use less garlic salt. I will definitely use this recipe again.

We really enjoyed this chicken.  I followed the recipe exactly (scaled down for 2) but since it was raining I cooked it in the oven on 350 for about 25-30 minutes.  Great!!

Like my son said "Deeeewishussss!"  YUM! Fast, easy, little cleanup, juicy, flavorful, versatile...what more can be said?  I didn't have cajun seasoning, so I substituted grill seasoning.  I will definitely be trying the cajun, though, cause man, that must make this dish completely over the top!  I marinated this only long enough to fire up the grill and it was extremely flavorful.  I didn't feel like washing an extra bowl either so I just threw everything in a ziplock in the frideg.  All this oil makes for great flames and grill marks.  Absolutely superb!  Will be a staple here for entrees, salad, and cold chicken dishes.  Great cold leftovers next day too!  THANKS!

It was good but I think I will add a bit more cajun seasoning next time.  It didn't have enough of a kick but definitely a good start.

This was awesome!  I didn't have lemon pepper so I used some fresh lemon juice and a little pepper.  The chicken was so moist.  I also let it marinade for about 5 hours.  Yum!  Will make this again.

I marinated this chicken over a 24 hour period and it made the most tender perfectly seasoned grilled chicken for a salad, sandwich, or a main dish.  Went perfectly with our barbeque party.  Two thumbs way up!  A pleaser!

Hm.  Not too sure about this.  One reviewer said it was too salty.  I thought it was a bit on the bland side for my taste.  I had to add some salt to the final product.  I marinated for 8 hrs.  Used chicken thighs & cooked them in a pan on the stovetop.  Will make again, but will add some soy sauce to the marinade and try broiling next time.

very yummy!  I even goofed on the recipe but it still came out delicious... It's only me and my fiance' so I bought a 3 pack of chicken breasts and completely forgot to cut down the recipe until I'd already poured in a whole cup of vegetable oil and a whole tablespoon of Tony Chachere's (the best cajun seasoning out there)...once I did that I realized my mistake, but with all the vegetable oil, the spices were definitely not overpowering (as a lot of them ended up slipping off in the vegetable oil mixture).  Oh, and I also cooked them in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes (with very minimal oil in the pan).  Delish!

Delicious!  Both of us were surprised how much flavor these had after only an hour marinating.  We didn't have a big problem with flame-up.  Yes, there was an initial burst of flame when you put them on the grill (shake off the excess oil!), but they didn't blacken.  I plan to slice up the leftovers (I only made 4 breasts total) and create a cajun-type pasta dish for another meal this weekend.  Give this one a try!

This recipe was amazing.  I reduced the lemon pepper to 1 T and the oil to 1 cup.  I used a little less chicken then the recipe called for.   Marinaded in the fridge most of the day and fried it in a skittle, 8 minutes on each side. It was delicious, moist on the inside while still being a little blackened on the outside.  The spices were spot on, while maybe being just a little strong.  Which was a plus while using the left overs for Cajun chicken Alfredo recipe on this website.  I will definitely make again.

4 slices of bacon,
cut the squash smaller and make sure the mango is ripe;
the crushed red pepper flakes are a great edition !
Great with over-easy eggs.

I cut the recipe in half.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, I didn't have lemon pepper so I used fiesta lime and added black pepper and I used Tony Chachere's creole seasoning.  I marinated for two hours and after looking at your comments I put it in the broiler for 35 minutes. I started on low and then moved it to high.  It was delicious.

Reviews made this sound better than it turned out. I'm not a fan of lemon pepper, so that's probably what I didn't care for. It just seems odd to combine lemon pepper, Italian, and Cajun seasonings. I served with black beans and rice and some chopped avocado. Not bad, but the spices didn't work for me. I might try again and just use Cajun seasoning, and see how it turns out. (I made one of the Cajun seasonings from the Allrecipes website.) Definitely not too spicy.

Very tasty but too salty. My Cajun seasoning and lemon pepper both contain salt which was too much salt. 
Based on other reviews, I used less oil and adjusted the spices.  Will try again and tweak the spices for saltiness.

This was wonderful!!! I used chicken tenders bc that is what I had thawed. I used Creole seasoning bc I don’t have Cajun spice (research showed the main difference between creole and Cajun spice is that creole uses oregano) and olive oil, per reader suggestions. It was perfect grilled and then on top of a mixed salad! Perfect lunch! Thank you for the recipe.

Surprised that it didn’t have a bit more of the marinade flavor than it did.  The other reviews made it sound like it would.

This was the best marinade I have ever tried. Picky husband asked me to use it again the very next night on steak to top a spinach salad. Absolutely yummy! :)

I cut up boneless chicken strips to use with this recipe . I also broiled the chicken strips for 20 minutes after having marinated them overnight. They turned out very tasty  over a bed of Spanish rice w saffron.  It was a big hit at the social gathering I took it to. Thank you for the recipe!!!!

Let me qualify my review with the understanding that although I do a lot of cooking for me, my family and often times extended family with repeat request for my cooking (assumably not out of pleasantries) that this recipe is fantastic and easy with the most important part - flavorful!

I only had 2 chicken breasts to make so I reduced 2T to 2t and only used 2T of oil also, for more of a rub than a marinade, and then pan fried. The seasoning was strong but tasty!

An incredible recipe! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and it turned out amazing. The olive oil makes the grill smoke which gives the chicken so much flavor. I also left the chicken to marinate a little longer than 30 minutes and added a little more cajun seasoning (McCormick). This recipe is such a great way to make chicken with rice! Yum!

The very BEST chicken recipe. I used Slap Ya Momma Cajun Seasoning (regular) and store bought lemon pepper (but just a sprinkle) I also used black pepper and lemon zest. Grilled on George Foreman because I didn't have charcoal and OMG! My picky hubby even raced over it!

I made this recipe for my wife for dinner tonight and she LOVED it. I did substitute the garlic powder for fresh chopped garlic, it gave it more of a bite and enhanced  the cajun taste. Also, I only let it marinate for 15 minutes and that was more than enough! The flavors soaked up pretty quickly and she raved about it. Thank you! I will definitely make this recipe again and for a larger crowd! :-)

Subbed olive oil and marinated 5 hours. Hardwood charcoal, and grilled at medium heat. These were thick, large chicken breast, and required around 12 minutes per side. Came out great :-)

It wasn't bad but I expected more flavor.  I didn't have the lemon pepper so I used lemon juice and pepper- perhaps that is why.

This was an amazing dish with a lot of flavor! I didn't have as much time to marinade the first time and also had to bake it. The second time, I let it marinate for 4 hours and grilled it- it was absolutely incredible and our friends raved over it! I'll be serving it as a catered entre' today so we'll see how that goes! Thank you!

This had really good flavor. My grill ran out of gas just as I was putting the chicken on the grill so I had to finish them in the oven. They still turned out great. We ate our with a little mozzarella over the top of them. Will make again!

Outstanding ! I used thin chicken breasts. Marinaded using the recipe above with a few ommissions. Left out the lemon pepper, it was not necessary. Used italian spice I already had basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary, onion powder, garlic powder and cajun seasoning. Used a bout 2 tablespoons of each and poured some olive oil over it. Mixed it well , threw the breasts in to marinade for about 30 minutes in the fridge. Cooked on the grill medium high for 4 minutes a side. Perfect. I made 7 breasts and my husband ate 5 of them. He cannot stop talking about them. I made them with some fettucine and sauteed peppers. but next time I making them with garlic mashed potatoes. My god these were good.

This recipe is amazing.  I was concerned about the marinating time, but it was great--I bet if you marinate it longer its even better.  You can spice it up with more cajun, etc.  But as the recipe reads its not too spicy.  Great in Spinach salads.  Everyone enjoys it.

WOW...is this good!!! At first, thought the flavors wouldn't go well together, read some of the reviews and decided to try it. Awesome flavor! As per one review, I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil (I just prefer olive oil) and another review said this made a lot of chicken. Yes it would. I used only 2 whole chicken breasts (very large from the meat counter), cut them down to about 3 pieces per breast half, rolled out to about 1/2 inch. Used full amounts of spice & oil for marinade, was perfect. Will definately make again. thanks!!

This chicken was really oily and salty. It wasn't bad, but I would not make it again. It was a little salty, but that may have been because of the Cajun Seasoning Mix I used from this site.

Good taste, a lot of flavor. Not very spicy. I used olive oil and cut it down to 1 cup. There still seemed to be way too much oil - had to get rid of it. Didn't grill it either (winter time here in AK - too cold, brrr). Broiled it in the oven for 20 minutes and it was still very moist and yummy.

This chicken is some of the best I have ever had.  I used olive oil instead of vegatable and added a little white vinegar.  My family tore it up and raved all night long.

I love this chicken!  I use olive oil and less of it.  I bake it for about a half hour, and always use thin breasts.  I make it with rice and use similar seasonings.  Perfect amount of flavor and spice!

While we like this chicken and it is spicy the cajun is not the most dominant flavor. I would definitely add less lemon pepper and more cajun. Also you can cut down on the oil significantly in the marinade.

Very tasty, but mine needed some salt after cooking. Might have been my cajun spice mix. Will add some lemon juice to marinade next time.

This was okay. I was expecting much more flavor. I was surprised that the lemon salt did not stand out more. I have some other marinades that add much more flavor.

I thought this was great.  I found this recipe a little over a year ago.  I usually cut the oil in half and use olive oil.  I usually will throw chunks of potatoes in to cook with the chicken.  It gives the potatoes a great flavor and they seem to mask the saltiness.  I've also just made potatoes with this recipe.. still very good!!

This recipe made the chicken very moist and tender, but not much flavor. I used way more seasoning than it called for, but just no real flavor.

Extremely good combination of spices! I cut down for 2 chicken breasts and marinated in the fridge for an hour. I must have said yum 10 times!! I wish I had enough for seconds or to throw on a salad for later. Good enough for company!

Used this recipe to marinade chicken strips to place on skewers for a Mardi Gras party.  Everyone enjoyed them.  This recipe makes enough marinade for 12 pounds of chicken.

Really good. We followed recipe exactly (made Cajun Spice Seasoning Mix in a jar from allrecipes for this- perfect). My hubby and I both ate our lunch for tomorrow already! I think next time I will decrease the oil from 2 cups to 1 1/2 cups per other users. Just want to see if it gives it a hint more flavor. Would also (as others suggested) be good on a salad. Definitely will be adding this to my recipe book.

This is a great marinade/recipe. The only suggestion I have is to use lemon pepper with no salt--the chicken was a touch salty for us. It's not very spicy/"Cajun"--just a good, basic marinade.

I have made this a few times now. I only use a half recipe for my hubby and I, and sometimes I don't even marinade the 30 minutes. I Also add hot cajun seasoning (Penzeys spices) to make it more spicy, but this is great just as is. The spice combination works great in grilled burgers too!

My husband and I liked this. I marinated the chicken overnight in a ziploc bag. We both agree that the chicken was too salty. One reviewer said that this is because of using cheap cajun seasoning. I used Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning and it still is too salty. I will use half the amount of cajun seasoning the next time I make it.

Yum, my family loved this chicken. Even my one year old. It is not too spicy hot. I made up several batches of the spice and keep it on hand. Great sprinkled on shrimp prior to grilling then served on a bed of greens. Thanks for the recipe.

This was pheonomenal and so easy. My changes: I only used 3/4 cup oil (extra virgin olive instead of veg). For the cajun seasoning, I used Emeril's Essence recipe that I got from Food Network's Web site. I also added about 1-2 Tbs more cayenne  pepper to the mix. I marinated for about an hour or so and cooked the chicken with the marinade in a skillet over high heat on the stove. Came out great and juicy. Probably not as healthy as grilling, but fantastic flavor. The boyfriend told me this was the best meal I've made him yet!

My husband and I enjoyed this chicken recipe.  It was easy to make too!  I scaled the recipe to two servings and used six chicken tenderloins.  I added a splash of lemon juice and it turned out great.  I didn't think it was too salty...it was just right!

We love this recipe.  If you think it's to salty, check your spices for salt.  The cheaper ones do tend to add more salt.

I found this to be pretty salty-and I love salt.  I used Tony Cacheres Creole seasoning.  I really liked how moist these were so I am going to try it again with another seasoning blend. A good starting recipe, but definitely room for improvement.

Good and super easy.  I used chicken tenders instead of large chicken breasts and used my Geo. Foreman grill.  They only took a few minutes to cook.  Were very moist and tender.  I think you could cut back on the oil a bit which would help to make them a little spicier.

OH MY GOSH! This is so delicious.  I marinated for 30 mins in the fridge and then grilled it on my bbq. The fire seared it and gave it that oh so good bbq flavor.  I recommend turning down the heat (if possible) after the grill heats up, that way it doesn't dry out.  My picky 5 year old ate his portion and then another serving! MMM MMM MMM!!!

I heard "This is delicious" about 10 times during supper from my boyfriend.  He was skeptical at first because it only marinated for 30 minutes, and it was marinated in oil, but he's definitely changed his mind, we both loved it!

Very flavorful, but a little on the salty side.  Not sure what to do about that though.

Very tasty - and spicy. The kids enjoy it. I'll use Cayenne pepper in place sometimes. Still good.

This recipe was amazing. I let the chicken marinate for about two hours in the refrigerator. To avoid the high flames from the grill that a few other reviewers wrote about, I lined the grill with foil. I served this with the Roasted Garlic Grilled Vegetables from this website. If you are counting carbs, both of these recipes are wonderful. I will make this again and again!

I would like to warn other people thinking about making this, that you will have some flamage when putting this on the grill!  So be prepared!  I didn't think it was to bad, it turned out very moist.  But my daughter wouldn't eat it because of the color!

Very good and not too spicy. Just remember to drain before placing chicken on the grill. (I had a bit of a flame problem...oops)
