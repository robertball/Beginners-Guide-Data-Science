My husband really liked this recipe.  I had to use Sweet and Tangy A-1 since it was all I had and I found the recipe a little too sweet.  I think it would be better with regular A-1.  It was however a nice change for the round steak I used.  Plus, it was super fast and easy.  A great last minute, I don't know what to make recipe.

I don't like to mess with steak too much because it's perfect as is, but this was nice for a change.  It's wasn't too sweet and the orange and ginger flavors weren't over-powering.  It was really wonderful!  (I did make it with sirloin steak, though.)

Marinade was good, but it's not long enough to tenderize top round. I'll use a better cut of meat next time.

The sauce on the steaks didn't add much flavor.  You really have to dip pieces into remaining sauce to taste it.  Just OK for us.

I needed to do a lot of extra stuff to make this recipe work for me. First I made the glaze exactly how it stated, except I used regular A1. Realizing this was not going to cut it; I added garlic, green onion, a lot of red pepper flakes and orange juice. Then seasoned the meat with the normal powdered spices and let it marinade in the orange juice mixture over night. Next day I transferred it to a baking dish added more oj to the marinade, pored it over the meat and put it in the oven with chopped onion and green peppers. When it was done, I cut the meat into strips, reduced the sauce on the stove, then added the meat back to the sauce. I ended up serving it over jasmine rice. I guess I completely changed the recipe to what I call ‘Spicy Asian Orange Beef”.  The end product was not what was stated in the recipe but it was a spring board to something really good and unexpected. That’s why it got 3 stars.
