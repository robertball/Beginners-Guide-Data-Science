I am rating this recipe 5 stars after I have made a change or two.  I bake this for weddings every weekend and have never had a complaint, only rave reviews so I guess this recipe speaks for itself.  Substitute the baking soda with baking powder and add an additional quarter cup of milk......Best ever!

I made soe changes after reading reviews and cake came out moist and chocolatey.  I used 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup boiling water.  I used two squares hereshy unsw chocolate and 3tbs cocoa dissolved in in the water.  I added 1 tsp baking powder. With adjustments a great chocolate cake.

I'm with Tianne on this one. We did not like this cake at all.  It was very bland and not sweet or chocolatey at all.  It raised very nicely and had a good texture, but that's about all I could say about it.  I poked holes all over it and melted some frosting and poured it over it to add some sweetness. I then put a ton of frosting over that.   I really expected a great cake with the ratings.  I was very disappointed.

Great chocolate cake! I made a little change though- instead of using cocoa, I melted 1 1/2 cups chopped milk chocolate and semi sweet chocolate chips, and made an icing of melted chocolate, butter, a squeeze of orange juice, splash vanilla and powdered sugar. I'll definately make it again!

This is absolutely THE BEST cake I have ever made!  It was even better than a Betty Crocker mix.  I paired it with the Chocolate Frosting submitted by Tianna.....delicious!  Even my husband, who doesn't like sweets, LOVED it.  This will be THE chocolate cake I make from now on.

This recipe was really REALLY bad. I followed the recipe exactly. When it came out of the oven I was really excited because it looked beautiful but when it came to eating it.. it tasted bland, the texture was crumbly.

not chocolatey at all. The consistency is excellent, but the taste is less than 'one star'. I would not make this recipe again. I used a ton of extra icing in order to give it some sweetness and taste. I'm not sure why the other people gave this recipe such good ratings. At least it was moist and good looking.

I made this chocolate cake for a birthday party and it was a real success. Even one person that does not like chocolate cake ate it saying it was the best cake she had ever eaten. Great recipe.

I've made this a few times and it has always been a success... I even made one for a Breast Cancer fundraiser and the whole cake sold for $3 a slice!!!...Here's what I changed: 7 tbsp of cocoa instead of 6, 2 tsp of vanilla extract instead of 1 1/2, 1 heaping cup of mini, semi-sweet chocolate chips (they mix well and they don't sink).

When I make a recipe from AllRecipes.com, I like to make it the first time exactly as the recipe says. I didn't do that this time. Instead of a cup and a half of milk, I put a cup and a half of non-fat sour cream. Instead of margarine, I used butter. I think I might cut back to 1/2 tsp. of salt next time, and there will be a next time. This is a good cake. I agree with the commenters who used block chocolate if you like it real chocolatey. I don't. This was about as chocolate as a German chocolate cake. This turned out very moist. I'm saying it's because of the sour cream. I can't say for sure because I haven't tried it with the milk. Good recipe.

This cake is dense and moist making it perfect for cupcakes and small loaf molds (in addition to cakes).  I read the reviews before I made it and took into consideration several people thought its flavor was bland.  I doubled the cocoa powder, used baking POWDER instead of baking soda and increased the milk by adding an additional 3/4 cup.  In a few of the cupcakes, (as a test) I threw in about 10 milk chocolate chips.  The chips melted leaving a nice, moist and creamy chocolately inside that increased the flavor.  It was delicious!  Not too sweet but a true chocolate flavor!  This is my new recipe for chocolate cake!  Peanut butter buttercream frosting really works well with this cake.

I love the texture...soft and moist. I hate to sound cynical, but I think the reason most people are saying this was bland was because they're so used to eating over sweetened pastries that they completely forget that desserts can taste good without being too sugary. This cake is a wonderful cake for kids, as this is just like the cake out of the store and for some reason, kids like that better than fudgy, rich cake. Also, those saying the taste was not rich enough, this is supposed to be a moist cake, not a fudgy cake! I personally thought this was a very nice breakfast cake to eat plain (no frosting please) with a cup of coffee on the side.

I followed the advice of using baking powder instead of the baking soda, 8 tbsp of cocoa powder and used 1/4 more milk. I also used 1/2c butter AND 1/2 c oil since thats what I had on hand.  

First off the texture of this batter is so silky, its just divine. I baked half into cupcakes and the other half into a silicone cake pan. The final product of the cupcakes and the cake is GREAT! Moist, just the right amount of sweetness and texture was just right. I noticed some people said that it was bland but I wonder if they realize that the cake isnt supposed to be sugar loaded- thats the job of the icing. Anyway, I really enjoyed the basis of this recipe and recommend it.

I have never had a Chocolate Cake taste like this! We made a couple of changes to make it a bit richer - and it totally paid off! We used unsweetened butter instead of margarine, whole milk, and used a food processor to cream the sugar & butter. This added a lot of air to the mixture and provided a light and fluffy batter. Once all of the eggs are added, remove from FP to large bowl and beat in vanilla. Then move on to step #3 using a hand mixer. Of course, if you have a Kitchenmaid, you don't need to use 2 different methods. If using this recipe for cupcakes, you will only need to bake for 20 min - but they come out PERFECTLY - a nice firm texture on the cupcake tops and nice and moist on the inside. This is my new cake recipe of choice.

I thought this cake was very moist!!  I did add appox 1T espresso powder to dry ingredients and 1/3 c sour cream to wet as well as member suggestion to replace soda with powder + 1/2 extra milk.  The flavor was similar to a Texas sheet cake but more developped.  I frosted with milk chocolate buttercream and it was great--not too rich.  Thank you for this go- to recipe!

This cake was great. I used regular coco powder and  divided the batter into two 9 inch pans. I let the cakes cool and I used chocolate pie filling for the middle. Very moist and yummy.

Great recipe. I made some changes though. I added 1/4 c Milk to the recipe. I used butter instead of margarine and I also melted 4 tbsp of the butter and added about 3-4 extra TBSP of cocoa powder to the melted butter before adding it to the remaining butter before creaming.

Dry.  Even using regular butter didn't save this cake.  Never understand why people use margarine for baking anyway.  Color wasn't attractive - not enough cocoa - 6 tablespoon is barely enough to color the cake, more less to taste like chocolate.  After a day, it was too dry to eat.  Sorry I wasted my time and ingredients.  Try Dark Chocolate Cake II (from this website) for the ultimate chocolate cake.

Very moist and delicious!  I made this for my hsuband's birthday cake and he LOVED it.  I also whipped up a quick frosting for it and it added to the chocolatey flavor (1 cup powdered sugar, 3 T. melted butter, a dash of light karo syrup, 3-4 T. cocoa powder, a few T. milk...mix together and spread over cake).

Flavor was great but was very dense. I followed the recipe as posted, maybe next time I will add more baking soda. All in all good cake.

I debated on making this cake. Usually when there are mixed reviews, it doesn't turn out right for me. But, the pictures looked yummy so I tried it. I followed Karin's suggestions and hoped for the best. Unfortunately, it was not the best moist cake ever. It was not sweet, barely chocolaty, and light tan in color. Not moist and not good.

I made this cake for my son's birthday. It was my first homemade chocolate cake and it came out great, everyone loved it.  It had a wonderful flavor and wouldn't even need frosting.  I did use butter instead of margarine, I'm not sure what the difference would be.  I will definately make this again.

This turned out good, but I changed a few things. Instead of milk, I used sourcream, and I lowered the amount of baking soda I used. It came out really really good that way though :3

SO moist that my cake was starting to fall apart when spreading on the frosting.  I served this at a dinner party and was asked for the recipe.  I think the trick to this recipe might be mixing the ingredients REALLY well.  Thanks Maria for submitting.

Goes together quickly and makes a cake that beats a mix hands-down! This is excellent. This would make good chocolate cupcakes too.

The texture and moistness of this cake are great. The taste, however, is less than satisfactory. The batter (and therefor the cake) is really light colored for chocolate cake. That should have been my warning sign. It doesn't even taste like chocolate cake. As a matter of fact, it tastes kind of odd. I will not be keeping this recipe in my recipe box. Next!

Just finished baking and eating this cake. First Choc cake I've baked and it was quite easy to make!

The only difference I did was to scale it down for share of 3 (I was trying to satisfy my Choc cake craving so needed something small) and added in some semi-sweet Choc chips. The result was moist and even had nuggets of chocolate goodness!

Loved this cake!! I used it to make cake squares and it was so moist and chocolatey! I did use only 1 cup of milk and the rest coffee. I am definitely going to make this again! I used a chocolate cream cheese icing from this site.

Absolutely Amazing Cake!  I made it according to exact directions and the cake came out so moist and delicous.  This will now be my only cake recipe I use.  I also have made this without the cocoa and it made a wonderful white cake.

Made this cake with my 4 year old. It was simple. I used butter instead of margarine. And because I ran out of all purpose flour- I used half all purpose and half bread flour.  Cake turned out moist. My husband enjoyed the cake, even though he is not a cake lover.

I made these with butter and did the substitution of baking powder for baking soda and the additional 1/4 c milk.  I used chocolate milk as we only had skim regular milk.  Really moist and yummy.  I cooked them as cupcakes (24 regular size and 12 mini).

I made this cake for Christmas and was weary because of the few bad reviews but thought all of the great ones made up for it so I gave it a try. It was literally the worst Cale I have ever made/tasted. Too bland and not chocolatey at all. Not to mention it took about an hour and a half to bake. For your own good DO NOT USE THiS RECIPE. I even listened to some of the modifications and it was still awful. Unfortunately my family didn't get the "great homemade chocolate cake" I had promised this Christmas. Less than one star

Since I'm in Salt Lake City (about 5,000ft), I made some modifications for high altitude and the cake was awesome! No frosting needed! Used butter instead of margarine; -3tbsp of sugar; + 4tbsp milk; +5 tbsp milk; -1/4tsp baking soda; used 4 and a half tbsp cocoa powder, since that's all I had left, and included 4 tbsp of chocolate chips. Baked at 375 degrees for 35 minutes and Presto! Cake looked and tasted really good!!

THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!!! I have made this cake twice in a matter of weeks! The only changes I made were to use baking powder not soda as suggested and I added a rough cup of mini chocolate chips both times. The 1st cake I baked in 2 round cake pans. I made a cream cheese icing for it. RAVE REVIEWS, prompted another cake. Last night I put  my batter in a bundt cake pan. It needed to cook an addtl 10 mins or so. This cake I glazed with a vanilla glaze recipe I found on this site. OMG! This is our go to chocolate cake recipe!!

I was a little wary at first, it seemed you either loved or hated this cake. I made minor adjustments (added 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and 1 tbsp cocoa) and... it turned out absolutely fabulous! The batter itself was very thick and tasted perfect, but when baked it was moist, high, and delicious! I highly reccomend!

If it was possible to give this cake NO stars I would have.  I made it once before and didn't even think it was worthy of a rating. I tried again using some of the adjustments suggested by other reviewers and still, this cake fell VERY short of what I expected judging by the reviews. First off, the heavy whipping cream (suggested by another reviewer) made this cake batter the consistency of chocolate mousse, which I believe is the reason it came out so crumbly. The batter tasted great, too bad that could not have been the case with the finished cake.  Second, even after adding a little extra sugar, cocoa, AND almost a half a cup of chocolate chips, this cake STILL lacked flavor. Overall, this cake is not worth the ingredients you put into it, with or without the adjustments!  Ive tried THREE chocolate cake recipes from this website, I don't think I'll be trying any more!

An easy to follow and relatively no fuss recipe. The cake turned out really moist and yummy. Was a bit too sweet for me though and I would probably reduce the amount of sugar next time, but overall a great recipe :)  Not so great for cupcakes. Came out too dry and not-chocolately.

I was kind of worried when my niece did not care for the batter (Which she usually loves)but thought it was okay when I saw it come out of the oven then I spent two hours decorating her this large castle cake for her fourth birthday and when it came time to eat it everyone took one bite and left the rest on their plate. I was humiliated, I followed the directions exactly and was not happy with the taste. (it tastes like flour) KEEP LOOKING

This is a great recipe for cupcakes. I add 2 cups sugar instead of the 1 3/4     cups they had and one more tablespoon of cocoa. But love it as cupcakes with cream cheese icing. Plus I baked at 325 instead of 300

Finally a cake recipe that is moist and tender! Everytime I make a homemade cake I think I could have done better with a mix. Not this time! This was great! I did frost it with some chocolate frosting and added some pretty sprinkles for the kids.

I don't know why some people gave this cake such bad reviews! Maybe because you used unsweetened cocoa instead of sweetened? I've never tried it with unsweetened cocoa, but w/ sweetened it tasted great! I have made this cake numerous times and every time it has turned out moist and light. I will continue to make this cake many times more! :)

This cake had a good flavor but turned out kind of dry.  I used the chocolate frosting submitted by Tianne and that frosting was very good.  I will make it again but next time will probably add a little oil and some chocolate pudding mix to make it moister.

I found this cake dry.  I carefully watched the baking time because of the other comments on it coming out dry, but if I had taken it out any sooner it would have been raw in the centre.  I used half whole wheat/half white flour but that has not affected my recipies before.

This tastes just like a good, old-fashioned chocolate cake.  Surely better than the boxed version, although it could be a tad more moist.  It's worth the effort.

This cake was excellent.  I made it for my son's birthday party.  It was so good, people took home chunks of it.  And I almost ate all of the leftovers.  It was definitely moist.  I paired with cream cheese icing and decorated with chocolate morsels. I will make this one again.

This is a great recipe.  Like the other reviewers I made a couple of tweaks that enhanced the original recipe.

I do agree with the substitution of baking powder.  In addition, when making a substitution using baking powder, the type of cocoa powder needs to change as well as the amount of baking powder used.  I doubled the amount of baking powder to 3 teaspoons. I used Dutch process cocoa that gave the cake a richer look and added the chocolaty taste that others said was lacking.  The use of Dutch process is usually the rule of thumb when using baking powder. Be careful because unless the original recipe calls for Dutch process you shouldn't just substitute it because many times you have to make other adjustments.  But, since I am doing a makeover to the original recipe by making a change with the leavening agent I decided to make this change as well.  In addition, instead of using extra milk I added 2/3 of a cup of mayonnaise for moistness.

Wow! What a difference.  The cake was awesome! A moist, rich chocolate cake that garnered compliments from many of my willing guinea pigs who tried it.  I also added a whipped chocolate frosting.  This cake is a chocolate lovers dream for sure.  I hope this helps others to achieve great results as well.

I made this cake for a cake decorating class that I am in and my husband tried it and said ti was yummy and excellent.  I also thought it was very excellent and moist.  I did make one change in the recipe, I used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  I will use this recipe again.

This recipe was simply delicious, everyone loved it!  I made a few changes to it - i added 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. And instead of milk I used evaporated Milk. The cake turned out very soft and moist! loved it!

I have never made a cake from scratch before. I came across this recipe because it didn't need a lot of extra fancy things in it, so I had what I needed and gave it a try. I made this cake for my girls 6th birthday and everyone liked it. I will use it everytime and I will even use it for chocolate cupcakes =)

That was the most UN-chocolate chocolate cake ever. It holds together nicely, but it doesn't work as a fix for chocoholics!

This is a heavy cake, but it's chocolate-y.  Although, I supposed if you like super sweet, heavy chocolate-y-ness, it won't work well for you.  I did add about a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips to the batter and used more like 7 tbs of cocoa powder as a concession to the negative reviews, but I think it would've been fine without them as well.  It is rather heavy and dense.  I made cupcakes and in my normal metal cupcake pans, 20 mins at 350 was perfect.  For my ceramic pan, it took closer to 30 minutes.  As others have said, this is similar to a German Chocolate Cake recipe.  I frosted with the Peanut Butter and Banana Frosting from this site, minus the bananas.  thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was AMAZING!!! when it said UNSWEETENED cocoa powder i was a bit worried about it not being sweet enough so i just added 1/4 cup more sugar. After i baked it, it tasted like out-of-the-box... BUT BETTER! Overall it was moist, chocolately and very good.

I loved this very light, not too sweet chocolate cake!  It's a piece of cake to make also.  I sometimes use my bundt cake form instead of the 9x13 pan.  Please thank your mom for me.

I loved this recipe! I was very nervous about making a chocolate cake since you can make one that doesn't have that really chocolate-y flavor. I did make a few changes: I added butterscotch chips, an extra 1/4 cup milk, an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder, baking powder instead of baking soda, and an extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Perfection when topped with a coffee/chocolate frosting.

it was just ok for me.  I had to cut way down on the sugar, milk and butter because honestly, there is just no need for that much of any of it.  The chocolate flavor was there, but overall just a basic recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly but my cake barely rose.   It was so flat I had to bake a second to have another layer (I had baked it in an 11 x 13 inch pan.   I agree that the flavour is not that great and it was very dense.   I won't make this again.

Great cake, although it fell in the middle after I took it out of the oven.  I also had to bake it longer than the cook time said to. Maybe that was because of elevation? Anyways, still a great cake!

This cake was GREAT with a few changes after reading all the reviews.  To this recipe as written, I also added 2 additional Tablespoons of cocoa, 1 box of instant chocolate pudding, 1/2 c hot water & 1 tsp baking powder.  Topping the finished cake with the "White Frosting" by Sierra on this site.  YUM!!

All in all, it was a very good cake. This was the first time I used this recipe, so I was unaware how it'd turn out. My grandmother's birthday was coming up and I wanted to make her a good, homeade cake -- she has beginning of severe stage Alzheimer's so I wanted this to be a good birthday and good cake. I saw this recipe and tried it. I really made no changes other than adding a little more cocoa. I made it a layered cake and made chocolate frosting and chocolate drizzle (I just made a normal chocolate frosting but made it a little thinner and added melted chocolate). After that, I just put Hershey's chips on it. The cake wasn't as moist as I hoped, though. I followed the recipe very carefully, but it seemed about as moist as an average cake, not extra moist like I hoped. It may have been my fault, though. It did stay in one 1 extra minute because the phone rang. Either way, my grandmother loved it and everyone else did, too. So thank you for sharing this. =)

Very nice! The cake is a little crumbly (in the good way) and a lighter chocolate flavor that goves it a devils food feel. I will be making this again :) I subed in 1/2 t of the baking soda for powder

As advertised, the cake was very moist and the perfect texture. I cut the recipe in half due to a lack of flour on hand and it still made a ton of batter, enough to fill a 9"x13" pan. Not much chocolate flavor, which could be due to my cocoa powder being a little old. I added four dark chocolate ghirardelli squares, melted, to the batter. Despite having little flavor, I have had four slices already in the past two days so I guess it turned out. I reccommend looking up the recipe for "Texas Chocolate Frosting" and adding a little cinnamon to that.

I had no margarine so I used butter. It was a wonderful and easy to make recipe that made 24 perfect, deep, dark, chocolate cupcakes.  Quite yummy!

This recipe was great!  Wonderful for my chocolate craving!  I had ALL the ingredients here so I didn't have to go to the store.  I did alter it a lil by sifting/adding a box of chocolate pudding mix in with the dry ingredients.  The pudding mix made it perfectly moist.  Then, to top it off, I drizzled a lil caramel sundae sauce AND dark chocolate sundae sauce!  My son loves it!  Thank you!

Really didn't like this cake. Very bland. Not rich, not sugary, not chocolately. Nothing a good chocolate cake should be. I will not make this again.

I made this cake today for my son's birthday party! It was DELICIOUS! I took Karin's advise and substituted baking powder for the baking soda. It was just enough chocolate taste, not too sweet, but not bland either! It was just right! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Changed baking soda to powder
Added an extra 1/4 cup milk.

This cake got raving reviews from my friends and family! It's more dense than a typical box cake and it's extremely smooth on the palate.  I tossed some mini chocolate chips in the batter too. Awesome cake!

I followed other reviewers advice and added a quarted cup extra milk and substituted the soda for baking powder.  I did have to cook about 7 min longer than directed but the cake looked beautiful and the taste was perfect.  I don't know where the other reviewers got that the taste was bland.  I used this cake to make cake balls/pops and it was fantastic!  Thank you so much!

AMAZING,AMAZING, AMAZING. I made cupkaces using this batter. They are amazing. I just used butter instead of margerine and baking powder instead of baking soda. I added about a cup of chopped dark and white chocolate. I baked the cupkaces for about 20 min. Very nice :D

This cake is AWESOME!! I followed the directions and it turned out great. I made it in an easy bake oven though. But if it turned out perfect for me, it should be perfect for everyone else. One night I made this only had it be vanilla cake because I loved this soo much! It turned out perfect!

This cake needs a 10, I have made this several times, and will from now on be my go to chocolate cake!  It is just amazing, no adjustments, no additions.  Yesterday I even accidently left out 1 teaspoon of the baking soda and it was still good!  It in fact made a denser cake, that I was more able to decorate.

I thought this cake turned out Great!! Very moist, with really good flavour. I did make some modifications to it as well, following Karins advice, I substituted baking powder for the baking soda, and also added 1/4 cup extra of milk...I ran out of vanilla extract, so instead I used almond extract...it added the perfect touch of flavour. I will definitely use this recipe as my main chocolate cake from now on, I'm sold!!! :)

Great cake mix. I wanted to try this cake mix so I have put this mix into cup cake form and it turn out great. I left it in oven for 350F for 20 mins and it was enough.
Cake mix is not crazy sweet which will make great combination with chocolate topping/ icing.
Totally recommend this cake!!

We made this recipe (AS IS- NO CHANGES) 4 days ago and will be finishing it off tonight.... IT IS AMAZING! Perfectly fluffy, not too dense. Very moise. Perfect flavor. We will absolutely be using this recipe for all chocolate cake needs in the future. Even now, 4 days later, it's still moist. We paired it with a basic buttercream frosting= perfection! Thank you so much for sharing this!

Although it turned out moister than I thought is would by the looks of the outside.  It didn't taste like chocolate cake to me.  So it wasn't great but it wasn't bad either.

Its not a great cake. It is however a good base to build upon. Add more chocolate, some applesauce and heavy cream.

Every time I bake this cake I freak out at how watery the batter comes out, but this is the ONLY cake that I am now allowed to make...that is how much of a favorite it is!!  I have made it tons of times and everyone loves it.  I do use Ghirardelli Unsweeten Chocolate powder which I think adds to give it that great chocolate taste. It is extremely moist and therefore crumbles easily so I hate icing it!

This cake is by far the best, and easiest recipe i have ever come across.  I used this recipe to make 250 cupcakes for a wedding, and they were the talk of the night!  The name seriously says it all, BEST MOIST CHOCOLATE CAKE

By far the best home made chocolate cake I've ever had the pleasure of making. I Followed the directions to a T each time I've made it and it comes out perfect every time. I just wish I could decorate it as nice as the pic.

Thank you for the DELICIOUS recipe. It loooked just like the photo! :)  I used butter instead of margarine, and increased the milk by 1/4C...and used 1 1/4 t. baking powder, and 1/4 t. baking soda( instead of using all baking soda)  Tasted like a sheet cake....very yummy. My entire family loved it.

Just made my first "Best Moist Chocolate Cake", and I changed the recipe based on the other reviews.   1 cup oil instead of margarine, a bit more milk, used baking powder and extra cocoa powder, (in my case 2 tablespoon extra).  I did not add more sugar since looking at 1 3/4 cups of sugar kinda scared me a bit. As expected the cake is only sweet enough not to be completely bland.  Overall the cake came out very moist and soft.  I held one of made in a 8X1.5in pan and it was heavy and rather dense feeling. The bread is crisp on the outside but moist inside, well.. almost a bit too moist.   I must say I am happy with the results. I'm giving 4/5 stars only to reserve 5/5 rating for the bakery level cakes.

I made one change to this cake. I put in 2/3 cups of cocoa instead of 30g and it was fantastic! I made a chocolate icing for it too! Its really moist and spongy.

Wonderful cake, and perfectly chocolatey--not a chocolate devastation or death by chocolate.  Followed Karin's advice in her review with the extra milk and the baking powder-soda switch.  I shall be making this again.

I made this recipe lastnight and it was delicious. I added an extra 1/2tsp of vanilla and changed from only baking soda to only 1/2tsp baking soda and 1tsp of baking powder. It was The Bomb!!! Thanks for the recipe...

This reminded me so much of my grandmas recipe. For those who dont think this is chocolaty enough (even though its great on its own) try putting chocolate chips in it. I made mine into cupcakes in baking cups and they turned out perfect. Great recipe!

This cake was excellent. I read the reviews so added a bit more sugar to sweeten the cocoa and then used half milk and half-half & half. I also added a healthy dose of chocolate chips and it was brilliant. We used some Pillsbury fudge icing and it melted into the cake just adding to the experience. Both my wife, mother-in-law, daughter, and I liked the cake.

Not so chocolatetey the first time I made it (used unsweetened cocoa) but it was GREAT without the cocoa and add 1/2 tsp lemon extract - I served it with either powdered sugar on top or cream cheese frosting from the store - it really is a great moist cake, better than boxed mix.

My daughter selected this recipe to use for a 4-H demonstration.   I must say I was impressed with this cake...it is very  moist.   Probably the only thing I would change is to add a abit more cocoa, I like really dark, rich chocolate cake.

A good chocolate cake without oiliness - definitely a plus!  Let the cake cool down and the moistness will emerge.

I loved the cake but I did make some changes: butter instead of margarine, 2 c of milk, 10 T of cocoa, 1 t of baking powder, 1/2 t of baking soda. everything else was the same. I did have to bake a little longer. I made a frosting with powder sugar cocoa milk and butter. I kept the cake in the fridge to keep it moist and it lasted a week

I followed some suggestion to double the cocoa powder and add a quarter of milk . Also used baking powder instead of baking soda. The cake is too sweet in my opinion, should've put only I cup++ since I'm doing frosting.  I divided it into two, baked it  40 mins each and layer with cinnamon butter frosting. The cake is easy to manage, super dense and looks more like brownies. Love it if it's not too sweet.

I like how rich it tastes, however i added some instant coffee and a bit of almond extract to give it a special flavor, but unfortunately it turned out very dry, although i reduced the flour amount and added more liquid (may be wasnt enough). I will make sure to add more liquid or oil next time!

To make up for the dryness, i made small holes with a knife and topped it with chocolate ganache and toasted coconut flakes for the taste.

This is my go-to recipe for any chocolate cake. I took the advice of a review above & substitute baking powder for the baking soda & add an additional 1/4 cup of milk. It makes 36 cupcakes or 3 8" rounds.

I have made this recipe several times. A tip for those that want a more chocolatey taste, I changed the recipe to 3 Tbsp of Special Dark cocoa & 3 Tbsp cocoa. Also I added a 1/2 package of instant Jello pudding (chocolate or fudge) if you add the pudding mix you will need more milk. After I have made these changes I have only used this one for chocolate cupcakes & all my kids are always asked to make it for their school functions. The way I make it yields exactly 30 cupcakes & in my oven 18 minutes. But for those that don't like chocolate as much I stick with the origional reipe, either way I have never had one complaint!

Not being a chocolate fan (I'm nuts, I know), I didn't have a stand-by recipe on hand.  I wanted an easy recipe that I could bake with ingredients on-hand.  I usually test a new recipe on my family before I make it for company, but I didn't with this one. It was a hit!  How lucky I feel to have found a great chocolate cake recipe on the first try! The recipe makes a lot of batter, so I made a 9-inch 2-layer cake, and it was done after 30 minutes in the oven. I frosted it using the buttercream recipe on the Domino's confectioners sugar box,and added enough unsweetened powdered cocoa to make a light chocolate frosting. Because of the size of the cake, I needed an extra 1/2 box of powdered sugar to make the frosting.  I prettied up the top by sprinkling it with iced oatmeal cookie crumbs. This will be my go-to cake recipe in the future.

This is the best homemade cake ever!  I tweaked it a little bit, I used 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup half and half and added an extra tablespoon of cocoa.  The cake is chocolatey but not too chocolatey and is very very moist!  Give this cake a try, you won't be disapointed!  P.S It tastes even better the next day :D

This cake was very moist yet did not have a chocolate flavor. I made the adjustments of adding 1/4 cup milk and substituting baking powder instead of baking soda, as suggested by a previous review. If I want a chocolate cake, this would not be my choice.

This was yummy! Not quite the most moist cake ever--pudding in the mix boxed cakes or mayonnaise cakes are moister. BUT this was not at all dry and very tender. Some comments here mentioned the cake not being sweet/chocolate enough, so I added 1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips to the batter. Still, I wound up quite happy this cake wasn't overly sweet because I used the Pro Ganache frosting recipe found here and it would have been wayy overkill had this been sweeter.

Cake not sweet. A bit heavy too. I'm sticking with boxed devils food cake by pilsbury. It's light and sweet and a whole lot easier to make.

I loved the texture of this cake, very tender.  Great flavor, my family loved it.    On the down side I had tried to make it into a roll cake to freeze, and it cracked in several places which I attribute to how tender the crumb is.    Still delicious with Cream Cheese icing.  By the way I added 1/2 cup sour cream for extra moistness.

Its delicious! lol im eating a piece right now, its very moist and fluffy and you can taste the chocolate but if your looking for something extremely sweet and chocolatey you should probably look for another recipe. I like it though, i frosted it with store bought chocolate frosting which is all i had on had, i had a big craving for chocolate and i needed a recipe that called for cocoa powder rather than chocolate bars. Its great its not overly sweet and complements the frosting very well. Thanks for the recipe!

True to Description..."yummy on it's own or w/ frosting"... My Teen followed the recipe but needed to substitute the cocoa in it's absence she used 3x's the amount of Nestle Nesquick (it was still excellent)!

This was a very moist cake, but I was not impressed with the intensity of chocolate, it needed more cocoa or melted chocolate or something, I also replaced the baking soda with baking powder and that worked well.

Despite the bad reviews for this recipe, I decided to try it. I should've kept looking for another recipe, because this one is not good at all. It is not chocolately enough, and it was heavy and dry. Don't waste your time with this chocolate cake... keep looking!

Moist and delicious!  I added some chocolate chips (about a cup) and made this in cupcake form (20 mins in the oven at 350).  I glazed them with the Hard Chocolate Glaze recipe from this site - they turned out great!!

What a spectacular cake!! The cake came out so moist and chocolaty!  I covered the cake with a chocolate Ganache and it was supburb! A big cake, but I cut half for my husband's office and froze the remainder of the cake for whenever we get the munchies. I will be making this again and again and again!

I followed the recipe exactly as I didn't want to end up with a bad cake. It was really bland, rubbery, not nearly chocolaty enough. Tasted "home made" if that makes sense. I will not make this recipe again and do not recommend it. I was very disappointed.

I decided to make these for the 4th of July party my parents do every year, and they were a hit. I made too many and took the rest to work, the guys had no problem devouring them. I did make some changes to better suit my dietary needs. I subbed out all the butter of olive oil, 1/2 cup sugar and a half honey, 1-1/2 cup rice milk, and 2-1/2 cups white spelt flour, and only 1/4 tsp of salt, I think my "helper" might have dumped another 1/2 cup of sugar in when I wasn't looking, they are sneaky little men :) wink wink

I made this recipe for my class of 18 5-7 year olds and they all loved it, as well as the faculty that got to try it.  I made it with olive oil instead of margarine/butter, and aprox. 2/3 honey 1/3 sugar in place of sugar.  It was fantastic!  Also, I used half whole wheat pastry four and half whole spelt flour.  They kids really helped me make it so I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but came pretty close except for my changed, due to what we had in stock.  It was great, and I'll definitley make it again!

This cake came out of the oven and looked just beautiful but the taste was only ok. Its too bland and a little salty. Frosting didnt help either....I was able to salvage by making an ice cream cake. Turned out great. The ice cream is sweet enough to make up for the bland cake and everyone loved it. If I made this again I would use 2 cups sugar, twice the chocolate, and maybe even a little chocolate pudding in the batter....

This was edible but not great.  Not quite sweet enough, definitely not moist enough, and tasted like baking soda.  I would suggest using half baking soda and half baking powder instead of just the soda.  I would not make this again.  I make things from scratch whenever possible to cut down on all those unpronounceable ingredients, but Pillsbury's from a box is better than this.  Sorry.

Man, does this make a lot of batter! I ended up with 48 mini cupcakes AND an 8 X 8 sheet cake. Having tasted a cupcake or two first, I threw a big handful of chocolate chips onto the batter of the sheet cake and found I liked it better. Topped it with cream cheese frosting and drizzled chocolate spiders on top of that.  Even with those add-ons, I could detect so-so cake beneath.

Exceptionally fine, "short" crumb gives a delightful texture.  I drizzled a maple flavored glaze on the top.  I could see this cake with maybe a rum topping too.  It's a very addictive cake, yet somehow it would have seemed more satisfying if it were a bit more fudgey.

This looked like it was going to be a little dry, so I made a powderd sugar glaze and poured it over the cake after I poked holes in it. That made it sooooo moist and added a little sweetness. Very good cake! I also added some chocolate chips to the batter. Thanks!

Awesome!  Very quick and simple.  I see others found this cake a bit dry, but I didn't have that problem.  (Perhaps those people are in areas of higher elevation and needed a tad less flour.)  I'll definately make again.

Great cake! It wasn’t as rich as some of the cakes I’ve made and I love that! Although I did have to bake it about an hour instead of the written time, but it was totally worth it!

Followed the tip to switch out baking powder for baking soda and to add a quarter cup more of milk and it turned out great! I've made a few different homemade chocolate cakes and so far this is my family's favorite.

I made this one day at the last moment.  I do not use margarine for baking, only butter. At first, I thought I messed this up.  The batter is not thin like box cake mix is.  It's kind of fluffy.  It filled up the 9x13"pan almost to the top.  I had to cook for a few extra minutes.  I'm true to the toothpick testing.  I let it rest.  Smelled amazing.  I didn't frost it, too lazy.  It actually tastes great unfrosted.  Maybe next time I will serve it with some whip cream and cherry pie filling .  It's not a heavy chocolate flavor.  And the butter hits your palette  towards the end.  I'm glad I kept this!  Everyone loves it!!

I made this as cupcakes - following the comment siding baking powder instead of baking soda and adding an extra tablespoon of chocolate powder and using 2 full table spoons of vanilla. They turned out great- made a cherry vanilla butter cream frosting - hubby likes cherry so we went with that but I a coffee flavor frosting would have rocked!

I added chocolate melts in the mixture and it turned out to be an excellent addition to the moist cake. The milk made such big difference in creating the texture of the cake. Will certainly recommend this recipe to my peers .

This turned out horribly... I dont know if it was something that I did wrong, but I KNOW I put that said amount of cocoa and it hardly had any chocolate flavor. Also runny batter and just didn't taste good.... Had to throw the whole batch out

The cake turned out absolutely lovely. Extremely moist. I replaced the flour with whole wheat flour . Added  little more milk as I read the reviews of the cake turning out dry. That's it,the most moist cake I've made so far. Love it.

I followed as written, I used baking powder instead of baking soda.  Problem with this cake was that it was NOT moist. Other than that had a nice taste to it. Instead of putting frosting on it, I sprinkled some powdered sugar on it.

After experimenting with 2 other recipes, i had better faith in this one. Although, I added tons of extra sugar and powdered sugar. It DEFINITELY helped it sweeten up a bit. I also only put 1 cup of milk in to keep the consistency nice.

This recipe was pretty good, I'm not a chocolate cake lover but bake them for the boyfriend all the time  =)  Good thing about this recipe is it make a nice big fluffy chocolate cake.  Not a very chocolaty chocolate cake though, a small bit bland in comparisons to other cakes I have baked.  I added an extra spoon of coco powder, and definitely needs a chocolate fudge icing.

Not moist-should be baked at 325 especially if using nonstick pans. I even took 10 mins off cooking time and it still was not moist. My dad is a professional baker, but wanted to try this recipe. It was delicious though.

I loved this recipe.  Made a few changes though.  Added a packet of chocolate pudding mix and a bag of semi sweet choc. chips.  also, used baking powder rather than baking soda and upped the milk to 1 3/4c.  It was very moist in the middle and a little dryer at the edges.  My husband would have enjoyed a little less cocoa powder, but I thought it was perfect. Used with Chocolate Frosting II from this site and got a great compliment on it.

I did not have a lot of faith after having a disaster after the Decadent Chocolate cake recipe on here.  My fears seemed to be confirmed when I found the mix to be thin/runny to say the least, but all in all I was pleasantly surprised upon completion of baking.  Even with just the baking soda, it rose well.  Very chocolatey.  Smells superb.  I think we have found a winner!

I did not care for this recipe. The only way I can really describe the flavor is weird. It wasn't chocolaty at all. Even after adding more chocolate it was still awkward.

I thought the cake was ok. It didn't seem super moist or taste very chocolaty to me. I should have know it waouldn't be very miost, though, because there was no oil.

I, too, changed the baking soda to baking powder and added 1/4 cup more of milk and the cake turned out better than I thought it was going to. Homemade cakes are usually dry, but this cake wasn't as dry as the last homemade cake I made. It wasn't SUPER chocolatey, but overall my family was happy, they all said good things about it. Not one complaint. :)

I have made this cake over and over...I have never had a problem with bland flavor! In fact, the opposite..it's actually TOO rich in chocolate flavor for me. It could be that as I live in Germany, and use different chocolate than what is available in the US, is what makes the difference. It's never been dry or crumbly either. It's perfect as it's not too sweet and I don't need a ton of frosting or icing to "sweeten it up". I've made flavor variations such as vanilla, lemon, and the like, and none have disappointed. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was "okay", but not as special as I had been hoping.  I made a double recipe for a First Communion cake.  It was dense in texture and had a nice "feel" to it, but the taste was fairly bland even with the extra cocoa recommended by others.  I won't be making this again.

I substituted baking soda for baking powder and added 1/4 cup more milk as was previously suggested. I also added mini chocolate chips and drizzled the top with milk and white chocolate...looked and tasted delicious :) Thanks for the recipe!

Seriously good cake here folks! Very moist, very nice texture and perfectly sweet. But I'm rating this 4 stars because it could be more chocolaty, I think I'm going to increase the cocoa powder by 4 more tablespoons the next time, or I'll try adding in some melted chocolate. I've been trying chocolate cake recipes on the internet for years and this is the best recipe by far!!!

I just baked this today.  I tried  the original recipe and also tried with the changes that another user suggested (sub. baking soda and add 1/4 c milk).  I did not like either version of this recipe.  It didn't taste good and didn't have much chocolate taste.

The taste is good, but my cake totally fell apart. I am not an experienced baker and I tried to modify the recipe by adding some real melted chocolate so maybe that was the reason it fell apart. Tasted good though..

This was very moist and yummy! The only problem was that the recipie said to keep it in the oven for 20 min. but I had to keep it in an extra 15 min. Other then that everyone loved it, I will make this again for sure!

I love this recipe! It's the only one I use and everyone can't get enough of it! I tweak it by adding chocolate chips, coconut, and chopped nuts on top. It comes out beautifully and makes a great thank you gift!

I adjusted the milk and added baking powder and think maybe 1Tbsp of cocoa powder more would have been better. Otherwise I loved this cake it was moist and dense. If it had been a little richer I would have been in heaven.

This cake was so-so.  It has a very nice texture but something is missing.  The only changes I made was adding an extra tbs of cocoa powder and adding 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I think next time I'll add chocolate chips or semi-sweet baking chocolate.

This recipe was not nearly as good as i thought it would be. It looked good and was moist but it didn't taste very good at all. I even added melted chocolate, and more milk as some other suggested . It still had little flavor.

I was looking for a recipe for chocolate cupcakes that included cream cheese in the batter, not just poured in the center.  Found this recipe and replace the margarine with 8 oz softened cream cheese, and I used unsweetened dark cocoa powder.  The cupcake came out moist and very tasty, not as sweet as cake.  Next time I will adda bit more milk, but otherwise, they were a BIG hit!  Next time I want a chocolate cake, I will make this as written, except for adding extra milk.

I made this for my son's 2nd birthday. I did a small 6inch cake and 36 cupcakes (doubled recipe) It tasted fine, but not amazing. I did make a few adjustments...I used baking powder instead of the baking soda, and and added an extra 1/4 cup of milk. Like I said, it was okay, but not amazing.

I am sorry to say that I have never had a cake turn out as badly as this one did. I followed the directions and made no changes. It was ridiculously dense, almost flavorless and very dry.      You know it is bad when four people - myself, two guys who eat almost anything and my friend who has been cooking as long as I have - give it the "thumbs down". The only good part was the chocolate frosting and even that wasn't enough to save it.      My 16mo old wouldn’t eat it. We limit the amount of sugar she eats, so she never says no to sweets. Until today.     My friend compared it to a box of Jiffy corn bread mix with chocolate added to it.      Note: the only reason it got a 1-star was because the website requires 1 to 5 stars. I wanted to give  it 0-stars.

Easy and delicious!  Don't overbake though.  I baked mine in 2 -8 inch round cake pans for approximately 35 minutes.  Fabulous!  It tasted like devil dog cake to me.  (without the unnatural additives)

I made this recipe today, I was making a guitar cake and was concerned from some of the other reviews that it would not be a dense even cake for what I needed.  But I am very happy to report, the cake was a huge success.  But I took the advice of one of the other reviews, I added baking powder, and I added some melted dark chocolate as well.  Half a brick of really good dark chocolate.  Also, I used part whipping cream, part milk instead of just milk.  Came out so most.  Try it, you will see what I'm talking about.

this was the first cake i have ever made from scratch and it was pretty easy...just time consuming. i used a cream cheese frosting and topped it with fresh srtawberries. the cake was pretty good, but it was a bit dense and not as chocolaty as i like. will try something different next time.

I made cupcakes out of this and it was very tasty!  They cooked perfectly!  The cake was very fluffy and moist.  The only thing I would do differently would be to add a little more cocoa.  But great recipe otherwise!!!

Made some changes and then died and went to cake heaven! Per previous reviews I used baking powder instead of soda. I didn't have any eggs so I used applesauce (didn't really measure but tried to make it somewhat equal to the 3 eggs worth) and I added peanut butter chips and semisweet choc chips. I used a glass pan and gave it an extra 10 min but it could've gone even 5 more.

This is a very moist and delicious cake! I was really impressed! I topped it with Sour Cream Chocolate frosting from the Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book "Chocolate-Sour Cream Frosting". After reading reviews, I made the following adjustments: I added an extra 1/4 cup of milk and an extra 3 Tbsp. of cocoa powder which made the cake very chocolaty! Very moist! This will be "the chocolate cake" I make from now on! My daughter has requested this chocolate cake for her birthday! Thank you!

Great recipe!!  The batter is like mousse and bakes up gorgeous and light.  Tried it as written the first time and it was great, the sponge-ist cake I've had in ages.  This time around I halved the recipe and made 36 mini cupcakes for the family.  Thanks!!

This cake is very moist, but not chocolately enough for my tastes. Not sure if I will try it again with more cocoa or if I should go to another recipe. The sides got a little too brown while the center wasn't done. Anyone know how to prevent this?

I found it a bit dry and it was lacking in the chocolatey taste

This cake was OK. not the best cake that I have ever made or eaten. :) If you add 7 Tbsp. cocoa instead of just six, and about 1/4 to 1/2 cup more sugar it probably will taste better. All in all it wasn't too bad.

Great recipe really soft and moist family loved it. I used a glaze topping instead of frosting and it was great. My kids want me to make it more often, Thanks for the recipe.

I used sweetened cocoa powder instead of non-sweetened. The cake I made was not moist at all, but I thought it had just the right amount of chocolate. It wasn't too subtle and it wasn't overwhelming. I will not be making this cake again though, I need my "best moist chocolate cake"s to be moist!

I gave this a three because I don't think it would have been very good without my changes.

First, I halved everything but the chocolate. Then I subbed in butter for the margerine, made half the baking soda baking powder instead, and reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp. I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and I mixed in a pack of chocolate pudding mix.

This actually turned out very well, much to my surprise. It'd make better brownies than cake, though.

Excellent recipe! Since I do not eat chocolate, I substituted the cocoa with Krakus Instant Coffee Substitute measure for measure. Very nice.

Made this cake for Father's Day.  The men loved it and so did everyone else.  This one has now taken the place of my standard chocolate cake.
Thanks Maria!

i enjoyed the cake, however it came out dry on the outside and moist in the middle. I figured it must have been a mistake on my side, maybe i over cooked it or something. I will try it again. It was very easy to make.

Good chocolate cake, very moist.  I couldn't find unsweetened cocoa powder so I used the sweetened. Still tasted good, very rich cake.

Pretty good. I thought it was a little bit dry, though.
