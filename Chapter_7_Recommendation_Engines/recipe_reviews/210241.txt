loved this dip...brought it to a bbq and everyone really liked it as something different.  I used 8oz of cream cheese, 1 1/2 cup pb and 1 cup marshmallow.  I blended that together and used french vanilla creamer as needed to get the right dip consistency.  It was fabulous.  thank you

Everyone loved this! I wouldn't chill as I found once I did that it was almost impossible to dip the fruit in after that.  The kids gobbled it up and request it again and again. Simple and fast!

This dip is okay...isn't amazing or anything. Noone really ate it at my son's birthday party. Plus, even after using "fruit fresh" and a little orange juice, the apples set out to dip into it still turned brown. Didn't even try bananas for that same reason. 
Would be a good filling to add mini choc chips too, pour in a pre-made graham cracker crust and top w/cool whip for a fast, easy dessert.

I think I'm going to fondly refer to this as "Peanut Butter Crack Dip".  I was able to sneak in a taste of this as my kids were devouring it during afternoon snack.  Um, yeah.  Anybody who remotely likes peanut butter needs to try this!  No need to refrigerate, either.  If your kids are anything like mine, the dip will neither make it into the fridge before they snatch it, nor will there be any leftovers!  Great with apples, strawberries, pretzels, animal or graham crackers!

Even though the kids liked this, I will not make it again.  I would've had to add a lot more water to thin it out because it became so thick after sitting for a  while the kids were eating it that they picked it up in clumps with their fingers!

This is super yummy!  I love peanut butter and this is just a great dip.  My husband prefers it to be made with crunch peanut butter because he likes the litte bits of peanuts in the dip.

Not a bad treat. Really simply and to the point. The kids loved it. They ate it with apple slices. I only made this because I had a bag of leftover marshmallow I needed to get rid of. So, I melted the marshmallows in the micro and add the rest of the ingredients.

So simple and so yummy!  My 2yr old son and I loved this.  We dipped apples in it - perfect way to get a 2yr old to eat fruit!

Very light and peanut-y dip.  Equally good with pretzels or fresh fruit.  It will be fairly firm when you take out of the fridge, so plan on letting it sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes to soften and make dipping easier.  Doesn't get much easier than this, and it's kid friendly, too.

Great snack dip. I had leftover marshmallow creme from a recipe and didn't know what to use it for. This is it! Super easy to make. Will make again.
