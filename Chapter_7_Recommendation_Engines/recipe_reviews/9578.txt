Although the flavor was great, the consistency is not right. I ended up with a buttery mess that ran all together when baked even though I only made 4 per cookie sheet. I ended up breaking it apart and using it to top ice cream.

Amazing flavor!! Just like the ones from the expensive bakery. I would watch the cooking time - depending on your oven 5 minutes will be to long.

I have been making these for year, beautiful as a topper on an icecream desery, also really good if the end is dipped in melted chocolate AFTER they cool!
