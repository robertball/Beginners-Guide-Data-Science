I fixed this for Thanksgiving to take to my parents.  My Grandma (85yo) has been wanting the recipe since then,  She states this is the best she has had.  She is from the country and I remember visiting when she made everything from scratch,  her "canned" veggies etc.. were from a  mason jar, butter was from a churn, ah to go back in time.  Well, if she said it is the best, then it must be!!!!

My husband has been trying to get me to make Scalloped Corn for about the past 16 years but with all the varying versions I was always leery on picking the right one. I decided to surprise him this last Thanksgiving using this recipe – I realize now that this dish needs about 15-20 minutes to ‘rest’ before serving. I got a second change at Thanksgiving dinner when my daughter and son-in-law came home to visit while on R&R from their tour in Iraq. This time I used 1 sleeve of cracker and ¼ cup butter in the corn mix and 1 sleeve of crackers and ½ cup butter on the top. A huge hit!! I was even asked to bring this as my passing dish for the Family Reunion ;o)

This recipe is a great alternative to regular corn, which I would eat every night if my husband allowed me!  The only thing that I changed was that I used 1 can cream corn and 1 can regular corn (scaled down the recipe).  By adding regular corn, it had a "cornier" texture, as opposed to just creamy.

Delicious! The best scalloped corn I've ever made. I used 2 cans of creamed corn and 1 can of whole corn. I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it!  I used crushed Ritz crackers instead of saltines and it had a more flavorful taste plus added 1/4 cup of finely chopped red onions which added more flavor too. I also added 1/4 cup parmesan cheese to the cracker crumb mixture for the topping. I will make this over and over again! Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this recipe as a "run through" before the final day - just to make sure we liked the recipe & to see if I would want to serve it for Christmas dinner.  Let me tell you, it was a hit!  I didn't do my "timing" all that well, so I ended up cooking it in the microwave in a casserole dish & it was still fantastic!  I've been to previous family gatherings where someone has brought Scalloped Corn & it wasn't very good, either too soupy or too thick.  This one was just perfect.  I would recommend this recipe - FOR SURE!

One of my family Thanksgiving traditions is this dish - I always add a few extra crackers to thicken it a bit more!  Excellent and very tastey!

By using only 2 cans creamed corn with 1 can regular corn and substituting saltine crackers for buttery club crackers our family just loved it!

I made this for Christmas dinner, and everyone liked it very much.  I made it with 2 cans of cream corn, and 1 can of whole corn, and I added a pinch of sugar.  I think maybe next time I might try 2 whole, and 1 can of cream corn.  Thanks for a good recipe!

My Grandmother made scalloped corn every holiday when I was growing up. This is the closest I've found to her recipe. It is a great recipe, easy, and turns out well. The only change I would make is to cook it just a little bit longer for a thicker consistancy.

Comfort food night(or also known as broke-as-heck and using what's in the cupboards). I cut this back by half. Instead of using half a can of creamed corn, I used two full cans. I threw in some Frank's Hot Sauce into the creamed corn mixture. I used Ritz crackers because that was what I had on hand. I tossed a couple tablespoons of Kraft parmesan cheese (in the green canister) in with the cracker mixture before I sprinkled it over the creamed corn. My boys LOVED this--my oldest boy had two big helpings and asked for a third but my husband had already finished it off. NO leftovers.

This is an old, family recipe.  I have been eating this for Thanksgiving since I was a baby!  While it is not fancy or in any way wow-inducing compared to some of the recipes on this site, it is my idea of comfort food.  It is a lovely side for a meal, easy to prepare, and just about everyone likes it.  what more do you want?  Tradition at its finest!

Great recipe, 
Only used 2 cans of creamed corn. (didn't have 3)
Substituted french fried onion rings instead of saltines. This made it absolutely mouth watering. Was the first dish finished on Christmas Day.

I revised this recipe somewhat by adding
1/3 cup fat-free sour cream; reduced the
cream-style corn to 2 cans; substituted
Pepperidge Farms Herbed Cornbread Stuffing
for the saltines.

Any vegetable I can get my son to eat 
with gusto, deserves a 5-star rating.

Loved this corn!  I had to use Ritz crackers (didn't have saltines) and it was still wonderful. Used 1 can kernel corn and 2 cans creamed. Perfect combo. Thanks for a great recipe :)

My family loves this dish and asks for it frequently. It's so easy to make and so delicious. The only thing I add to it is about a 1/2 tsp. of salt to the corn mixture, and instead of 3 cans of creamed corn, I use 2 and then 1 can of whole corn, drained.  Delicious. Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is identical to the one that's been in the family for years upon years.  My grandmother made this.  When I bake the casserole, I follow the recommended time.  it never looks quite done to me, but when it rests for a few minutes, it's perfect.  It should be firm around the edges and just about firm in the middle.

I made this for our family Christmas dinner in hopes it was similar to my sister-in-laws late mother's recipe and she loved it.  We used more whole wheat Ritz and butter than the original recipe to give the proper crunchy top to a larger baking dish. I think a Tbsp of flour would tighten it up better and will do that next time, yet the flavor was spot on and wonderful.  thanks.

JUST LIKE MY GRANDMA USED TO MAKE! I made this for Christmas dinner to go with my ham and it got rave reviews. The only thing I changed was I used Ritz crackers instead of saltines which I think makes a world of difference!

I have always made scalloped corn very similar to this recipe,  but adding the paprika, butter and crackers to make a crumb topping really made an improvement. Everyone I served it to at our Thanksgiving gathering really loved it.   I did add diced onions to the corn mixture,  my family loves them in their scalloped corn,  but otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee and it came out wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe Cali!

I use one can of cream corn and 2 cans of regular corn, 2 eggs, 2 sleeves buttery round crackers, omit the paprika and use lots of black pepper.  It sounds like a lot of changes but this is the closest recipe I can find to mine.  My family loves it. My sister-in-law will sit beside the dish with a spoon and eat half of it by herself.

This is so good! I used one can of whole corn and two creamed corn because I like it thicker. I didn't put the topping on and mixed it all in instead. Turned out great! My husband liked it and he normally won't eat stuff like this. He even went back for seconds. Next time I will try it without so much butter. I think it would be ok with less.

Simple & tasty! I used fresh corn since it is in season now'Just cut it off and put in food processer.I left some whole kernel to since I like it a little chunky.Also used crackers I had that happened to be ritz,vegatable flavor even.Cut recipe in half since only 2 of us.May serve 5 that way but we had no leftovers with the 2 of us!

Good.I would give this 5 stars but the flavor was just corn-y.  I like the texture. I like the crackers. Next time I will saute half an onion in oil or bacon grease add a couple shakes salt and pepper and then it will be a 5!!

It's not much different than opening three cans of creamed corn and putting it in a pot on the stove and heating it up, and it's not worth the extra effort.

I added a can of diced green chilies and a smidgen of cayenne. For the cracker topping I added some Parmesan cheese - it was really good, will be making this again.

Made this for Christmas and it just didn't do it for us.  I thought it was incredibly bland.  Maybe it was the brand of creamed corn I used.  Will not make again.

My husband's grandmother used to make Scalloped Corn for large family meals.  When she passed away, so did her recipe.  I tried this recipe about five years ago and all his siblings love it - it's just like Grandma's.  Highly recommend this recipe - it's a tradition and now something I can pass down to my kids too.

I was low in the pantry and found this recipe by using the ingredient search tool. I used Ritz butter crackers since I didn't have saltines...This was very good, a nice change from the regular corn casseroles that use corn muffin mix. Thanks Cali.

Excellent! This recipe tastes exactly like the great casseroles that I enjoyed for many years at our church potlucks. It was so easy to fix. I substituted bread crumbs instead of saltines (less sodium) and it was great.

I made this recipe for our family Christmas dinner for a different variety and everyone loved it...better then my old recipe from my grandmother. I used two cans of creamed corn and two small cans of whole sweet corn.  This is probably the best I have had...just remember to let it 'rest' before serving. This is definately a keeper!

Made this for thanksgiving dinner, it was very good, but I did substitute one can of whole kernel corn for a can of cream corn. so I used 2 cream & 1 regular. I would also add some chopped onions next time.

This was pretty good. I enjoyed the recommendation of using one sleeve of saltine crackers in the corn part and one sleeve of saltines in the topping mix.

I had such high expectations for this recipe and I gotta say I was let down.  I've never had scalloped corn before so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like but to me this just tasted like you opened a can of cream corn and crumbled some saltines in it.  I wouldn't go through the trouble again when I could easily open a can of corn and get about the same taste.

I really wanted to like this. I'm sorry to say it tasted just like saltine crackers and canned creamed corn. I guess it sounds silly, but somehow I was expecting something tasting less like crackers. I do like scalloped corn though, just this didn't taste how I expected. Very bland. Maybe using Ritz crackers next time and adding some cayenne? Thanks anyway, we didn't mind giving it a try.

Followed the recipe exactly. I really liked the texture, like a light frittata. My kids loved it. I needed a little extra salt at the table. I'll make it again.

Delicious!  I replaced one of the cans of creamed corn with whole kernal corn, and I left off the topping.  This is my new favorite corn recipe!

My Mom made this.  She was a country girl from Ohio.  I'm now a senior citizen and have been making it for years.  I use more crackers and mix them all in.  Also I add 1 minced scallion and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.

This is a great base for a recipe. I add a 3/4 Cup Heavy cream, 1/4 cup minced onion, and some garlic salt. And for the topping I use more crackers and season it with some salt and pepper. Its a favorite for my granddad!

Made this in hopes of winning over the family. Thought it was a different twist to the reg corn casserole. It lasted for a few more days than I expected but was good. Especially when you put some honey over it (according to my son) :-) I would recommend this recipe.

This recipe is runny and flavorless.  I agree with other reviews that it tasted like plain old creamed corn out of the can.  I would not make it again.

Followed the recipe the way it was written and it turned out very runny and was really nothing special.  Upon looking at the other reviews will try some of the other suggestions and try again. Always willingly to try a few times and doctor it up a little.

This has been a family favorite at every holiday feast.  The only thing we do to make it our own is to use Ritz crackers instead of saltines.  I also use about 1 cup of crackers in the corn and about a 1/2 a cup for the topping, and no margerine.  As my Dad always says, "Everything is better with butter, except watermelon!"

Excellent!  Just how I remember it.  I did make a minor adjustment though.  In place of the canned cream corn, I used the recipe for "Marian's Creamed Corn" found on this website (I omitted the bread crumbs and 3tbsp. butter from that recipe).  Thank you so much for sharing this great old fashioned goody!

Made this the first time following the ingredient list and instructions... I felt the dish was too soupy.  Next time I made it, I added a box of jiffy corn muffin mix in with the corn instead of the crumbled crackers.  I did use crackers in the second step which created the topping.  It turned out much better utilizing the jiffy mix.

I had made scalloped corn years ago, but it was a crock-pot recipe I have long since lost. This was true to that recipe, except I remember adding sugar and cheese to that one. I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner. I spread out six slices of American cheese on top of the corn mixture in a 8x11 glass dish, before adding the cracker topping, and it was loved by all. I will make it again!

No changes, made per recipe. If you make this plan on bowls to serve the gruel. You'll need a gallon size freezer bag to dispose the ample leftover stuff.

I made this for our traditional Christmas with friends. Each year the hostess asks me to bring a corn casserole. The previous  3 year's recipes I tried weren't too great, all too sweet. So this year I wanted to try one without cornbread mix.  I made this recipe just as directed, but added a seeded, diced jalapeño for some Christmas color and it turned out great!!  I cooked it for about 50 minutes and took it out of the oven when it still had a slight 'jiggle' when moving it.  Remember to let it rest for about 15 minutes before serving. It got rave reviews and will now be our new traditional corn recipe!! Leftovers were used to make a Shepard's Pie -couldn't have been better!!!!!

This was exactly the recipe I was looking for my mom always made something like this for Thanksgiving every year. The only change  that I made was to add chopped roasted red peppers  and diced onion I mixed everything together and put it in the fridge overnight and then sprinkled paprika on top and baked it the next day. Also, I used Club crackers instead of saltines. Thank you for this recipe!! My 84 year old mother raved about it we have been searching for a recipe like this for a long time !!

I was drawn to this recipe because it uses saltine crackers (like my family's usual recipe) and its high rating told me it might just be an improvement on what I have made before.  I mixed the ingredients as written first, and it seemed rather thin - based on other reviews I then added an extra 1/2 cup or so of crushed saltines to the mixture.  I also misread the directions and added the paprika and pepper to the corn mixture (and then also used them in the topping).  I checked it after 40 minutes and it was still jiggly, so I left it in until it seemed firm enough to me - turned out to be 65 minutes.  Overall it turned out very good, and I got several compliments on it when bringing it to Thanksgiving dinner.  The paprika in the topping was a great touch.

This is my go-to Scalloped Corn recipe.  I tweek it a tad as well, using 2 cans creamed and 1 can whole corn.  If you're looking for your lost grandmother's recipe, look no further. This is it!

This is basically my favorite scalloped corn recipe.   Mine came from BH&G)  I use 1 can of creamed corn, 1 egg, and 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of crushed saltines (22 crackers) reserving 1/c to mix with 1 tblspoon of butter for topping.  I also add some instant minced onion (my recipe calls for 1/4 cup of finely chopped onion) instead of fresh onion as fresh onion doesn't seem to get done.  I don't usually use paprika.  May try this version with extra corn and no milk next time.

The traditional way to make this is to use regular canned corn niblets. Pour the liquid into a measuring cup and fill with cream or evaporated milk to measure one cup. Otherwise be sure to put casserole dish into a pan of hot water to bake. The dish is done when a knife put into the center comes out clean.

I have to give it 5 stars because it was good. But it's pretty much the same as opening a can of creamed corn and heating it up. I also had trouble with the topping because it doesn't "sprinkle" that well, it chunks. So it was very uneven. I also cooked it for an hour like a few reviews said, which helped make it somewhat thicker in consistency. I think it's horrible to add that much butter to a dish that really doesn't need it. I won't be making this again, I'll just enjoy regular creamed corn like usual.

I made this for a family dinner.  My brother-in-law didn't like it, but he likes nothing, especially casserole type things.  The rest if us thought it was ok.  It seemed to lack something, but we aren't sure what.

I used 2 cans creamed corn and 1 can regular corn.  I made it on Thanksgiving.  I'm not sure that it could hold it's own as an everyday side dish, it's rather bland. But with the combination of all the other sides that we served that day, it was a fine addition.

didn't have creamed corn so pureed a can of regular corn.  only used 1 can as I didn't know if we would like it.   still made more than enough. added 2 eggs and 1 sleeve of crackers and 1/4 cup melted butter.  added a little minced onion and some Italian seasoning.  put more crackers and butter on top and a little shredded cheese just before it finished baking.

This got raves at Thanksgiving dinner!  I did a few adjustments though. First I substituted a can of niblet corn for one of the cans of creamed corn. I also finely chopped 1/2 of each - green bell pepper, red bell pepper and a medium onion - and sautéed them in 1/4 C of butter before stirring them in with the other ingredients. I reserved the other 1/4 C of butter for the cracker crumb topping.  Scalloped corn has always been a tradition in our family but these few adjustments gave it a bit of color and flavor that made it more appealing

I made this with a couple of substitutes instead of 3 cans of creamed corn, I replaced one with a drained can of whole kernel corn. The other substitute was instead of saltines, I used a sleeve and a half  of Ritz Crackers (approximately 1 1/2 cups). Hubby said it was the best scalloped corn he’s ever had. Will be making this again!

Made it! Excellent. I used two cans creamed corn then 2 cobs of fresh kernels cut off the cob. Made it more stiff. Topping I used panko and the butter. Excellent!! Will make again. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I found this dish easy to make and, as expected, very good. It deserves a five star rating.

I make some alterations to this recipe such as adding paprika and using 1 can whole corn for more texture. But over all, it's very good!

This  recipe is very similar to the one my mom has made for every family get together my entire life. A few subtle changes  makes such a difference.  I did 2 cans of creamed corn and 1 can of   kernels   Kosher salt  and I cut out  paprika

I used to make this a long time ago but forgot the recipe. This version turned out too runny, but it was good otherwise. I will add more crackers next time and omit the melted butter from the  recipe base. I 'll probably also sub one can of whole kernel corn like some of the other reviewers. It's a great recipe, it just needs a little tweaking to thicken it up a bit.

I made this casserole for my grandson's scout swimming picnic. So I increased the canned corn to 5 cans, drained. I did use 1 box Jiffy cornbread mix, 2 eggs & 2 yolks, 1/2 cup sour cream,  1/8 cup grated onion, 1 roll crushed Ritz crackers, 1/2 cup melted butter, 2 tbsp corn starch, 8 oz shredded sharp cheddar, a tbsp sugar, salt/pepper &  1 cup 1/2 & 1/2. I melted 3/4 stick butter. Crushed another roll of Ritz crackers & spreadded it on top, then drizzled 3/4 stick butter overcrumbs.  It looks & smells good. But until the picnic later, I won't have a true consensus or rating.  Thanks.

I like the fact that this an inexpensive dish to bring to any holiday gathering. As suggested by one reviewer, I added red onion,( about three tablespoons finely chopped) and 1/8 cup of grated Parmesan cheese to the crushed butter cracker topping and baked for 40 minutes.  Easy to prepare and tasters!  Very well received at Thanksgiving!

I followed the suggestion of a sleeve of crackers in the corn and another for the topping. It got a little too dry for my liking so will dial back to about 1/2 sleeve in the corn mix.

I researched a lot of scalloped corn recipes before settling on this one.  I was trying to duplicate what I had been served back in small town Minnesota.  Based on the reviews I decided to substitute Stove Top stuffing in the corn, used Ritz crackers on top, and added garlic salt.  It was delicious, I even got a thumbs up from my 92 year old mother!

This was exactly what I expected (and desired) for my family's Easter dinner.  One sleeve of saltine crackers ended up being close to 3 cups once crushed but I just divided them in half for each part of the recipe and it came out great!

I followed the recipe to the t .  Not a lot of flavor and quite runny.  I want to try this again for Christmas but I think I will add 2-1/2 cups of crackers for the mixture to try and thicken it up.  Maybe back the butter off some also down to and 1/8th of a cup.

My mom always made something similar.  She substituted frozen buttery corn, for one of the cans of cream corn.  It cut out adding the butter.  We never used eggs though.  Maybe someone could tell me what the egg is for?

I doubled this recipe and omitted one can of creamed and added a 15 oz pkg of white frozen corn which I steamed before adding.  This was an excellent recipe.  When doubled it took 65 to 70 minutes to bake

Good...I halfed the recipe and used one can of creamed corn, and one can of drained whole corn. I also used ritz crackers.  Was a little watery, but tasted good.

This was exactly like my grandma used to make, and exactly what I was looking for! The cracker crumbs browned up perfectly on top, and it was overall perfect with Thanksgiving dinner.

Good but texture is a bit runny for me. I will drain some of the  juices from the corn next time. The topping is great!

This was good.  I followed the recipe as stated except that I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers.  This added a little extra flavor and worked just as well as the crackers.  I also cooked it closer to 45 min. - 1 hr.

Excellent recipe! Just like my mom makes! I increased the amount of crackers; I like it extra crunchy. I think next time I may add a splash of milk and a can of whole kernel corn.

This was good.  I added flavored crackers instead of just saltines.  May try to add a little sour cream next time.  Filling side dish.

This is a very good side dish.  A simple dish that requires ingredients one would normally have on hand.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks!

i personally didnt really like this but my boyfriend did. I love creamed corn on its own, and the egg added to it gave it a strange texture. I won't be making this again unless my boyfriend BEGS, and i dont think he liked it THAT much.
