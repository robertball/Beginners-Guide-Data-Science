This recipe is out of this world, but be sure to serve warm or hot.  The texture of the persimmons change if it gets too cool.

So quick and easy and delicious! I thought 1 Tb of cinnamon sounded like a lot, but it was perfect! Smelled divine while it was baking too.

This smelled great while it was baking and I couldn't wait to sample it.  I took it to a party and was extremey disappointed and wished I had tried it at home first.  Taste-wise it was okay, but the texture was not appealing to me.  It was very dry and crumbly.  I won't be making this again.

PLEASE make sure you've got RIPE persimmons.  I used Hichayu and made the recipe without checking online to read that particular information.  Hichayus need to be totally ripe before eating.  Fuyus don't.  My grocery only stocks Hichayus, and I just didn't check the ripeness.  It's all on me.  BITTER, BITTER, BITTER!  Looked pretty baked, though.

I LOVE persimmon's, every member of my family from my great grandmother on down to my family have had both the Apple Persimmon and The soft mushy persimmon tree's. I've always eaten them plain or with peanut butter . After looking up other ways to use them I found this and have to say it is a fantastic, easy to prepare pie. The first time I made it I didn't have corn starch so I used regular flower, it was good, but the second time I made it I used the corn starch and it was even better.
