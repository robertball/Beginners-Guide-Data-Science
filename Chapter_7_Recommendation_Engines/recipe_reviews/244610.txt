Juicy Chicken Breast Marinade Haiku: "Nice chicken flavor,  wish I'd changed it *just* a bit, so easy to make." As w/ SLN's review, I had to grill mine much longer than directed, but chicken breast shape and weight can affect grilling time so that's no fault - I'd anticipated needing to grill it more like 6 min./side. My only issue w/ this marinade was that it was so heavy on the Italian seasoning that the little green flakes just overtook the flavor entirely. I'd throw this marinade together again no prob, just reducing the Italian seasoning.

Simple and delicious. My guests loved it. Will be a go-to. I sliced the garlic so I had nice pieces of it on the chicken. I ended up broiling them due to the weather; broiling on medium they took about 8 minutes per side.

Made as written except that I sliced my chicken breast in half so that I could get more of the marinade throughout. I found that the chicken needed more than 3 minutes per side but other than that this worked perfectly. Super simple super tender and super moist. You really cannot go wrong with this recipe. I plan on playing around with the herb mix some but the lemon juice will stay.

I was so looking forward to this recipe after reading the reviews. I couldnâ€™t disagree more.  The marinade needs salt! Breast turned out with good lemon and garlic flavor after marinating for over 24 hours, but dry meat.  I may try one more time with salt added.
