I changed this recipe a little and it turned out great, I doubled the vanilla and cinnamon. I added cinnamon chips instead of choc. chips.  They were excellent!  So chewy!  Yum!

Yum!  These biscuits turned out great.  They are crispy on the outside and soft in the middle and they look good - a nice puffy round shape.  The cinnamon adds a unique flavour.

I tried baking these(only my second time dealing with cookies), and they came out just wonderful! They were a bit too soft once done cooking, but they're also very small, so getting them off the tray and onto a cooling tray wasn't hard at all. They hardened a bit once cooled down, but were still soft and chewy, which is a plus.

The connamon was a nice touch. Everyone who has tried them has loved them.

This was a great recipe that allowed me to do ten different things at one time because once you had all of the materials it was SOOOOO EASY!!!

I followed the recipe exact only using granulated sugar and Hershey's cinnamon chips. The nuts were optional and I didn't have any so I didn't add them. Dude. These cookies were SO naughty. These were so easy to make, they came together in a flash and what was great about this cookie dough was that it didn't need to be chilled. Huge timesaver for someone who needed a batch of cookies pronto. Also, this was great using pantry items I always have, with a little bendability on the pudding mix and flavored chips used. Try the cinnamon chips in this recipe yourself. Or not. It's pretty dangerous for those watching their figures! ;)

i really didn't like the cookies.  Did not turn out like the picture (could have been the dough was too warm).  I will not make these again.

These cookies were delicious - however, one could barely taste the cinnamon! I suggest putting a lot more cinnamon in the mix when making this recipe, if one does not want a simple chocolate chip cookie.

Great cookies- I recommend doubling the cinnamon and adding 1 tbs of nutmeg. I also add 1 1/2 tbs of coffee, they turned out perfectly tasted great too.  Crunchy outside "gooey" inside.

Didn't turn out at all like stated.  MUCH too spongey.  Can hardly taste the cinnamon.  Sounded good, but didn't perform.  No remake here.

This is my first ever review on this site.  I just couldn't believe how overlooked thie recipe is.  I made these for my family and they were a huge hit!  I used cinnamon chips and doubled they vanilla like someone else had said.  Made for something a little different and delicious!  The kids said they were like bite cinnamon rols and wanted to add icing.  Maybe next time ;)

These cookies were amazing! They're very similar to cookies I've been making for years but the touch of cinnamon is inspiring. I think next time I might sub out 1 cup of chocolate chips for 1 cup of white chocolate chips.

These cookies are awesome as written!!  However, I make them a bit different and they are one of my favorites!!  The changes I made was an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and a bag of cinnamon chips.  With the optional addition of the walnuts they are perfect!!  Iâ€™ve made these so many times and I have gotten many compliments and requests for the recipe.  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!!

Great recipe.  I did, as other reviewers suggested, and used cinnamon chips instead of chocolate chips.  My daughter loved them and took a batch to school.

I liked them, except for the cinnamon.  Next time I'll just leave out the cinnamon.
