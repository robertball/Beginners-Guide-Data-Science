Instead of 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, I used 2 cups all-purpose and 2 cups whole wheat. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it came out great! I used this for a pizza crust and it was quicker and more flavorful than other crust recipes I have used in the past. Thanks!

I use melted unsalted butter in place of the margarine, which is much easier to mix with the milk and yogurt.  Always turns out great!

We loved these! I unearthed a can of chick peas in the pantry so I found a recipe for falafel but I needed some flat bread to go with them.  THIS WAS PERFECT!  There are a zillion uses for this bread from Mediterranean, to Mexican, to Italian, to Indian, and on and on.  I used nonfat plain yogurt since that's what I had on hand.  It seemed to work just fine. Will find this on our dinner table often!!

This recipe makes fabulous flat, round and soft pita bread!  I used it for my Greek gyros!  Perfect and I didn't change anything!  Thank you Max, for this wonderful recipe.  I've tried many but this one is the real thing!

I made this almost exactly as given, except used Smart Balance Butter Blend instead of margarine.  Mixing it with your hands is really the only way to get the dough fully incorporated, so while it is messy you have to just dive right in!  I had a little trouble with the first flat bread I cooked.  It would not brown or puff up.  I turned up the heat on the skillet to medium and used a bit more olive oil for the rest of the dough, and it turned out beautiful with a really nice flavor.  We served it with hummus and everyone loved it.  I think this would also be delicious if the dough were brushed with oil on both sides and then cooked on the grill!

Fantastic piadine.  I have made three different batches of these (actually halving the recipe each time) each time using butter or lard instead of margarine.  The first time, indeed was too salty for me especially seeing that they get filled with salumi (deli meats) and cheeses that are already very savoury.  The second batch I put a pinch of salt and they were great.  Definitely, as reviewed before, a forgivable dough.  All the ratios seem to be right on.  Then I made a gluten free version replacing the flour with 3/4 of the total flour quantity for gluten free all purpose flour and 1/4 gluten free whole grain flour.  Once cooked they are bendable, soft and delicious.  I have posted my picture of the gluten free version with bresaola, rucola and parmigiano reggiano shavings and "un filo d'olio" which is just a touch of fresh olive oil.  Living in Italy it seems strange that I would make these at home, but I prefer to make food from scratch for my kids nor can I find a good gluten free version.  Yum!!!! Thank you Max for this recipe.  Will be making these always.

Very good flatbread that is in the permanent rotation in our household.  I sub butter for the margarine, since margarine is so salty and just not good for you... also a stick of margarine hasn't graced my kitchen in 20 years.. LOL!  I sometimes add a bit of minced garlic to the milk mixture as well a few dried herbs.

I made the piadina as written (except I used butter instead of margarine) and it turned out great!  I actually warmed the milk/yogurt/butter mixture because the butter was too hard, but it made it very easy to mix together.  The consistency was great--just added a touch of water.  I didn't have a rolling pin, so mine turned out smaller and thicker than normal.  It's been years since I had piadina from Italy, so I can't say whether it tastes truly authentic or not, but I think it was pretty close.  Thanks :)

I couldn't be more happy - - - I had some yogurt I had to use up, so I made this recipe and then a small batch of Labneh with the remaining yogurt.  Absolutely delightful!  I halved recipe, but ended up having to add quite a bit more flour (perhaps another 1/4 cup) to achieve the consistency I believe you recommended (not too sticky, not too dry).

This was very nice.  Perfect for when I am in need of a fast flatbread.  It seemed to lack a certain depth of flavor (probably because it was a quick-bread & not from yeast), but all things considered, I will make this again!  Thanks for sharing!

To me, it came out a little too salty, and mine were very flat and a little crisp, not quite like a pita as other reviewers have said, but still very good for spreading with cheese.  The lack of fluffiness may be because I substituted butter, kefir, and heavy cream for the milk, margarine and greek yogurt.  I imagine sticking closer to the listed ingredients and removing some salt would improve it for me next time!

This was good - the texture quite lovely-  but rather bland - that's why only 3 stars. However, after the first 2 came out of the pan, I decided to mix some herbs and garlic into the oil I was using to brush onto each one. I also salted them on each side. And it made such a huge difference! Thanks for the easy starting point to a lovely flatbread.

We love this bread - this is a great recipe and I've found the dough to be very forgiving. If it's a little too sticky, just flour your countertop and rolling pin a little more than usual. We eat this with homemade hummus and baba ganoush. Love it! Thank you for posting this recipe!

This is a wonderful, fool proof flat bread recipe. I made it with my students. Needless to say anything... The only ingredient I replaced was the Greek yogurt with regular, traditional one, since here in Petropolis, Rio de Janeiro, I couldn't find the Greek kind. Thank you so very much for sharing. I love Allrecipes website!

My daughter and I made it today. It was really good. We substituted margarine for the butter and we didn't have any Greek Yogurt, so we used sour cream instead. Needless to say, it came out perfect. We also did an experiment and rolled shredded cheese into the last dough ball. It was great as well. Try it!

A wonderful, easy recipe.  Have made it three times now and my family loves it! I replace yogurt with sour cream because we eat our yogurt too fast. Will make again and again.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Well....I added 1/2 glove of minced garlic, 1 sprig of Rosemary and 2 sprigs of Thyme in the dough.  Then followed the directions as instructed.   Once cooled the flavor was great!   I then added a topping of the Turkey and Yam Spicy Tacos on Allrecipes and a little grated Mozzerella.  Wonderful...but I would add more garlic...TRY IT

I’ll make this again. I actually saw a cooking show on some Life channel making this bread. They made sandwiches out of it using ricotta arugula with lemon juice, olive oil, salt,pepper and prosciutto and another kind of sandwich. My son loved it too.

so what is so Italian about this? First one had a lovely flavour but not reminding me of Italy. So the next one as I placed it on the griddle I sprinkled fresh rosemary, rock salt an a spray of olive oil and I thought focaccia could not be beaten. Yummy.

Absolutely my go-to flat breads for not only Italian foods but my Indian foods as well.  Excellent with Hummus or as a replacement (and easier to make than) Na'an bread.  Love the ease of this recipe.  Even found a way to incorporate this recipe into my WeightWatchers program by making the recipe stretch to 17 breads for less points!

I appreciate any bread recipe which does not use yeast! This was great with feta along with big bunches of various herbs like basil, parsley, lovage, and mint. Thanks! -Paula Akbari

I make this recipe at least twice a month. It is wonderful and goes well with everything from eggs to soup. We especially like it with virgin olive oil and raw milk cheese in the evening for a snack.  I do not use table salt, instead I use Himalayan Pink Salt. It is the ONLY salt that has not been polluted by man in one way or another.
Today I am making a batch using organic spelt flour and kefir milk instead of wheat flour and sourcream and milk. I'm sure it will be the best ever.

I just made these and followed the recipe except I used sour cream instead of Greek yogurt...only had blueberry Greek yogurt. I was a little concerned about the stickiness of the dough but I floured the board well and had no problem rolling. I lightly oiled my old pan before each bread and they all turned out lovely. Having flat bread pizza tonight.
