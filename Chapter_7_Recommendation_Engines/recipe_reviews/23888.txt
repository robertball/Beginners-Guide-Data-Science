THIS CHILI IS DIVINE.  Everyone who has made it has loved it!!!!!   One recommendation is...if you are not a big bean lover....cut the beans down to one can.  If you do use 2 cans...rinse and drain only one can of beans, cause the chili needs a little more liquid to it.     Also, the picture that is shown...doesn't look too appetizing, but don't worry, its WONDERFUL!!!  Enjoy!!!!

I made this chili for a chili competition we were having at my job and won best overall chili along with people's choice. I did however tweek a couple of things. I bought and used one whole roasted chicken from the store instead of ground turkey meant and took the meat off the chicken and placed it into my pot along with 1 cup chopped onion, 1cup chopped red pepper, 1 cup chopped green pepper, and 1 glove of finely chopped garlic. Instead of using water I used 2 cups of chicken broth. I also used 2 cups of salsa instead of one. With the few changes that I used with this recipe made this an award winning hit at my job... I hope everyone else enjoys!

I thought this was pretty good but my husband - he LOVED it!  He could have ate it ALL in one sitting!  1 bowl was filling enough for me!  Making it again for a friend tonight!  My husband has told everyone about this, he just can't get enough of it!  So it's already a request!  I took the suggestion of adding the beans with the juice.  This did not seem too watery at all - I thought the texture was perfect!  I also used hot Salsa and shredded Cheddar cheese.  Make this!  It is SO easy and yummy!  Everyone will enjoy it!

UPDATE:  8/24/04  This has been a biweekly meal for the last 8 months so I just had to update.  We also add chopped onion and don't add the water.  We have also made it w/o cheese for my brother and he has requested it again.  Because this is so easy to make, we give it out when friends or family are needing meals it's a good change from the typical casserole.

Yum!  This was DELICIOUS!  I have made this recipe many times and it's always a favorite.  I do subsitute a can of chicken broth in place of the water, but other than that, no changes.

If you like this recipe, you HAVE to try it with chicken instead of the ground turkey.  Put your chicken in the crockpot with some bouillon and butter and let it simmer all day.  Then when the chicken is done, shred it and put it back in the crock pot with the remaining ingredients in the recipe.  It's so good.  Let it all cook together and you won't be disapointed! Everyone loves this white chili.

I made this chili using a black bean and corn salsa and it was wonderful.  I served it on top of a mexican corn bread recipe also on this site.  My fiancee has been talking about it ever since.  As a novice cook, I always select the recipes with the best reviews regarding both taste and ease in preparation - this one was a winner!

awesome!  I used shreded chicken instead of ground turkey.  My husband and toddler are super picky and both enjoyed it.  I used the cheddar/jack pepper cheese by Kraft, it's already shreded for you.  It was such a snap to put together.  You could probably even use canned chicken and it would be a 5 minute meal.

I made this with Boca vegetarian crumbles instead of the turkey and it came out really well. I had a lot leftover and noticed that overnight in the fridge it thickened up, so I took it to a party the next day with chips and it served as a great bean & cheese dip. Really enjoyed it ... thanks for the recipe!

I used cooked/cubed chicken instead of ground turkey and only one can of northen beans. While others mentioned problems w/ the cheese cooking hard to their pot - we didn't have that problem. This recipe combines my three favorite words: fast, easy and satisfying. Thanks Tina.

I could not believe how fast and easy this was to throw together!! Not to mention how good it was. Since I could not find the Sharp Cheddar Cheese cubes mixed with jalopeno cheese, I used the sharp cheddar cheese cubes and added jalopeno hot sauce (the green hot sauce) to this recipe. I also used medium garlic salsa and seasoned the turkey with chili powder. This dish is awesome. I didn't follow it exactly and it still turned out great!!! I will definitely make this again.

Ok, I couldn't see how this recipe got such great reviews but now I know. It is simple, healthy and delicious. I subbed a can a hot chili beans in sauce for one can of great Northern beans. I used plain shredded cheddar and a few jalapeno slices to the soup. Excellent!

Wow! This was great chili! 4 adults finished off the pot. I improvised and added a few things: can of whole corn, drained the water; added a small can of diced chilis; used chicken broth and used pepper jack cheese. I was also very liberal with the salsa. Served with fresh cut cilantro which added a TON of flavor. Added corn chips on the side too!!!

Yum! Really tasty and perfect for a winter day. We crushed some tortilla chips on top and added a dollop of guacamole and sour cream.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I changed it some to suit our tastes.  I sauted 1/2 diced onion and 1t. minced garlic, used veleeta cheese (it was what I had on hand) and added chicken broth to thin my chili down some.  I also added some chili mix since I didn't have the jalapeno pepper Cheddar cheese to give it a little more punch then followed the rest as written.   Took it to church last night for trunk or treat and not a drop was left (there was plenty of others left over) and 9 requests for the recipe.  I like it this way and will continue to make it "my" way.  Thanks for such a fantastic beginning!  Oh, I did use diced cooked chicken and PLEASE change that picture!  I almost didn't try this recipe because of it.

This recipe has been in my rotation for a few years now. My whole family loves it. We look forward to cooler weather because that is when I cook it. I substitute chicken broth for the water and add in an extra can of beans. This dish is excellent.

I used shredded chicken instead of turkey. My husband loved it and has since requested it twice, even though I made it last week!! Definately a winner here.

Great recipe!  I did make some changes.  I added onion, red and yellow bell pepper, cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper.  I did not add the water and used velveeta.  Very enjoyable.

I did tweak as well, using Kraft's Big Slice, Jalepeno White Cheddar slices. I also used a packet of white chili seasoning. One can of beans were enough for my family of 3. This is definitely an easy recipe I will be adding to my circle of continued meal.

Recipe is okay. At the end, I had to add about a 1/2 can of tomato juice and 3/4 cup water because there was no liquid left in the pot (dont add too much tomato juice, you dont want a red sauce).  I used pepperjack cheese as well, which melts great in this - and I served it with Lime Tortilla chips.

I made this in a crock pot on high over about 3-4 hours.  I added a few drops of oil first so the cheese wouldn't bake to the crockpot.  I also subbed beer for the water and pepperjack for the cheese.  I added 1 tsp chili powder but thought it needed some more kick.  Pretty good overall, got several compliments on it.  Thanks!

AWESOME chili. I added 2 cups of water, and didn't drain the beans, of which I added 4 cans. I will probably adjust the recipe a bit, for extra servings. Also, I used a verde salsa, which I think was perfect for white chili.

I love this recipe! I have used both ground turkey and ground chicken and both work fantastic. I have used 1 cup of canned corn instead of frozen and that works well too. I also add a few more spices (sometimes chili powder, sometimes seasoning salt, sometimes "better than bullion" chicken flavor) With the spices, it's whatever I think I might be in the mood for. Throw it all in the slow cooker and just eat whenever we are ready. I have cooked this on high for 2 hours or on low for 4 - 5 hours. Just brown the meat and add it cooked to the slow cooker. My husband LOVES this recipe and I have started buy canned beans every shopping trip because this has become a weekly meal for us, and I NEVER cooked beans before! Even my kids eat this up which is nice. A really wonderful winter recipe I plan on having lots of fun with all winter long!

This chili is great tasting and very easy to make.  Next time I will try using a salsa verde instead of regular salasa as my chili turned out more "organge chili" than "white chili".  Defintely will be making this recipe again.

I love this recipe.  I added turkey sausage, 1 can of chicken broth and I used Salsa Con Queso instead of jalapeno pepper Cheddar cheese.  It was DELICIOUS! A great quick easy meal.

My husband and I love love looove this recipe. It's perfect for a quick and filling dinner, not to mention easy. Perfect for a chilly night. Just throw the ingredients in a pot and stir occasionally until the cheese is melted; how easy is that?!

I made mine with shredded chicken instead of turkey, chicken broth instead of water, and cheddar cheese instead of jalapeno cheese. It turned out great! My picky husband and small children loved it!!

This chili was so easy to put together.  It was really good.  I took other reviewers advice and used chicken broth instead of water.  I also added some garlic powder, sauted onions, and used regular cheddar cheese and just added jalapenos.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

My 7 year old loved it!  I made this recipe with chopped turkey instead of ground.  I also used about double the salsa that the recipe called for and used some chicken broth instead of water to thin it down, as it was very thick.  Also used half pepper cheese half monterey jack, which made it not spicy at all if you are looking to make it mild.  I will defintely make this again.

I just made this for my husband and he absolutely LOVED it!  I used a mixture of Cheddar and Pepper jack and I melted them before I added the beans--so I didn't smash them up as I stirred the cheese in.  I loved it and my hubby insists on me making it again!

VERY good! My family loves this recipe! The only thing that I did different was slow cook some chicken in the crock pot and then add the rest of the ingredients later to let simmer on low for about 3 hours.  When it's all hot I add the cheese... soo good.  Awesome recipe!!

Surprisingly easy and good.  I added substantially more water, substituted jalapeno jack cheese, added more corn, and put a dash of cumin and chili powder in it.  I think the thick and chunky salsa we used did wonders for the texture.  This is a simple and tasty supper.

A great easy to make chili!  I added a chopped onion, some pressed garlic, and cumin for some extra flavor.  For the cheese I substituted regular cheddar and some chopped jalapenos.

My husband and I both loved this recipe! I substitued pepper jack cheese for the chedder, and I sauted 1/2 an onion with the turkey. It had plenty of kick and was delicious. Sour cream can be added to thicken it a little as well.

Great chili! Loved the taste!  I was worried it might be too spicy, but it was just right.  

 But this was visually appalling.  It took some convincing to get my husband to even taste it. Once he did try it, he liked it too.

I used chicken broth instead of the water, and added about 1 tsp of cumin and 1 tsp chili powder.  I also tried a jalapeno Havarti cheese, which melted very nicely and no mess like many others complained of.

I loved the taste, but absolutely you couldn't serve this to anyone outside your family.  My husband named it "Predigested Chili" and while he said he liked it a lot, he probably wouldn't ask me to make it again.  

I would have given it 5 stars for the taste alone, but couldn't get past the odd pink color, so it wound up with 4 stars overall.

Very easy to make. I could not find Jalapeno Cheese at the grocer, so I used Pepper Jack instead. I also threw in some Jalapeno juice for flavor and spice. I loved it... scraped the pot. My wife wasn't excited about it, though it may have been the spiciness.

Too many beans for my taste.  After reading previous reviews I decided to add shredded pepper jack cheese to individual bowls when served.  No mess in the pot to clean.

This is a very easy and tasty dish but, my husband had liked other white chili recipes better.  It is a mess to clean up with the cheese and I used boneless skinless chicken breast cut into bite sizes instead of turkey.

All I can say is YUM, YUM, YUM!!  Wow, this is great.  I added an extra can of beans and more corn, also, I doubled the salsa. I found the cheese in shredded and that sped up the cooking time by at least ten minutes. This makes a great soup or thin dip.  What a winner.

We love this recipe.  It is just bursting with flavor.  I hate beans, but you'll see me eat more than 1 bowl of this.  It is a little on the spicy side with the jalepeno cheese (and I love spicy!)  You may want to serve on top of rice if you're doing the dinner thing.  Very quick and easy to make.  Perfrect if you have little kids and little time!

What i did turned out much better then the original recipe. Instead of water I added skim milk and instead of cubed jalapeno cheddar I added shredded 4 cheese Mexican blend from Sargento that I had left over from making tacos, I saved some to sprinkle on top to serve, and I cut up 2 fresh jalapenos and added those plus about half the seeds. mmmm it was good! had a nice kick!

I used this recipe as a jumping-off point. A can of great Northern beans, a cup of frozen corn, 1 cup salsa...chichen broth instead of water, sharp cheddar and chopped jalapeno pepper in place of the pepper cheese. And I tossed in a handful of collards and added some cumin. I nixed the ground turkey as DH isn't a huge meat eater, and he truly liked this. Cornbread is a must!

We didn't have any type of white bean, so I substituted canned pinto beans and we also didn't have jalapeno cheddar cheese, so we substituted 2 oz colby and 6 oz velveeta. It was fantastic!

Yum!!!! OMG!!! It's really good!!! I do have to say, it could be slightly better with a little more seasoning in it...I was trying to figure that out, maybe a little cumin or something....I never did figure out what it could be to make it a little tastier, but it definitely great! I hope hubby likes it too!***had to come back and add that my hubby LOVED this....there was almost none left. My picky kid even ate it.  Really good recipe!

To make this recipe to go from pantry to table, I changed it to one can of diced chicken from my pantry, added another 1 1/2 cups of water, and used cheddar cheese powder.  I used dried beans and left them on low in the crockpot for 12 hrs, then added all the other ingredients (salsa and corn) 30 minutes before serving.  Very yummy and can use items I keep on hand in the pantry....  Leftovers will probably be thickened enough to drizzle over some tortilla chips for an additional meal.

I couldn't wait to make this based on all of the reviews, I even bought enough to double the recipe. Luckily I decided to only make one batch until I was sure I liked it.  I was very disappointed. Other than the kick from the jalapeno cheese it was bland and tasted mostly like cheese.  I think with some other ingredients it could be good, but I'm not very good at knowing what to add to a recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.

This is a fabulous chili! I added chili powder, pepper, garlic, some grill seasoning, a cup more of water and corn. I also only had 1 can of northern beans so I added a can of pinto along with it. We also loved the flavor that the cheese added. This is a keeper!

One of the best white chili recipes I've tried. The only issue I had was with the servings amount. It barely fed my family of 6 - we all had to have small bowls. Definitely double the recipe if you have more than 5 people to feed!

OUTSTANDING!  This is a good base recipe for white chili.  I added chopped onion, black pepper, garlic powder, and used chicken broth in place of the water.  Toppings included sliced avocado, a dollop of sour cream, and some crushed tortilla chips.  Not too spicy, very hearty, and delicious.  Awesome recipe, Tina B.

This is a simple, delicious base recipe that can easily be altered to make several different types of chili.  I used the ground turkey, but will try shredded chicken soon.  Added cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper to the beef, then more cumin and chili powder to the final mixture.  Increased salsa to 1 1/2 cup and subbed 1 1/2 cup bold rotisserie chicken stock for the water.  Didn't have any frozen corn, but I added a little corn and chile salsa that I needed to use up.  For the cheese, I used a total of about 12 oz of cheddar and 4 cheese mexican blend.  Added 2 chopped fresh jalapenos.  Very tasty and easy.  My husband loved it.  Super meaty and the cheese combined with the turkey to give it an interesting texture - kind of chewy, but good.  Perfect amount of liquid with my changes.  Yum!

We love this chili.  I use a block of pepperjack cheese because I've never seen cheddar with jalapenos.  My cheese is a 10 oz. block.  I always add additional salsa, probably closer to two cups.  I cook the turkey with a chopped onion for more flavor.  I also add a little garlic powder and chili powder.  The quality of the salsa used and the heat really makes a difference.  I prefer the chili when made with Pace medium salsa. It has a nice tang.

I really cannot understand all of the raving about this recipe.  I made it last night, I am not an inexperienced cook, and it was a total dud.  It was terribly dry, so I kept adding water, and it kept drying up (and I actually used a lid to keep the moisture from escaping).  Finally I added about 1/2 c. of refried beans to achieve some kind of smoothness, but it was no use.  No flavor, terrible texture -- I've already thrown out the recipe.

This is so easy and delicious! I made it as written and it turned out wonderfully. I especially love how fast it was. I found the recipe, went to the store, and was eating the yummy chili all within 1 1/2 hrs. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

A friend made this for me first and then I had to have the recipe for myself.  The only thing I changed was adding chicken broth instead of the water and eating tortilla chips with it.  It was so good my daughter even cleaned her plate.

Not sure what people are talking about when they say this is too watery... I thought it was rather thick. Much thicker than I like my soups. Don't think I'll make this again.

This was very easy and good :).  I added some minced garlic to the turkey as I was cooking it, just since I love minced garlic.  That's the only modification I made.  This chili is deceivingly good -- looking at the simple ingredient list, I didn't think it would turn out as well as it did!  I'll be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved the chili!  I added chili powder and chopped onion and red pepper to the turkey while browning it.  I also used pepper jack velveta and a can of mexicorn instead of frozen.  I am normally not a fan of processed cheese, but it did melt wonderfully into the chili.  The flavor really blends if you let it simmer for a long time(1-2hours on low).

It's not the most beautiful food, but sure is good. My husband really liked it and he's not a big fan of ground turkey. Very easy to make. the salsa I used was very thick so I added a little extra water and also dried minced onion.

I did not like this at all, it was very bland, I had to add more chili powder and cumin so it would taste like something.  I would not recommend this.

This is one of the easiest chilis to make, and it's my husbands absolute favorite.  First of all, he loves corn in chili, the beans are awesome and I always use jalapeno salsa, the green kind, and it's perfectly spiced, with the pepper jack cheese of course.  Thanks for a great recipe that disappears like crazy every time I make it.

This was a hit...I changed it to 12 servings but it only made 8-9. I also added one small chopped onion and used almost double the salsa because it was drier. Try not to use lower fat cheese as it doesn't melt well. I served it with Sassy Sangria which went over really well. I plan on making it again.

This recipe is so simple and so good. I'm making it a second time right now. Actually, I could say that I'm making it a third time, because I made it once with black beans. Yum! I didn't use ground beef or turkey--I used chicken. And I used a few fresh ears of corn instead of frozen. Regular Jack cheese is great if you don't like things too spicy. This recipe also works well in a crockpot. This will certainly be a family favorite forever more! Thank you!!! :)

A tasty recipe! I cound't find cans of Great Northern beans at my supermarket (I have since been told that they are cannellini beans), so I used kidney beans instead. I also could't find cheddar cheese with jalapeno peppers, so opted for shredded cheddar cheese and added chopped jalapeno slices from a jar. I suppose that is one way to have control over the "heat"!

I made the recipe with the exact ingredients listed.  I also browned the turkety with a large, chopped red onion and some minced garlic.  I let the chili simmer on low for about 6 hours.  It was thick and perfect!

So easy and good.  To make it more like a traditional chili consistency though, next time I'm going to add one can of beans with its liquid and puree the other before adding it.  The taste was great with the shredded pepper jack cheese.  (I also added cumin)  It just needs a little thicker base to hold it all together.  Thanks for a quick warm supper!

This was very good!  I agree with some of the reviews that the color was kind of unappealing.  Be sure to use a thick salsa or picante sauce so it's not runny.

This recipe is SO easy and my husband and I both love it.  I've tried it with the ground turkey, and then again with canned chicken chunks and it is awesome both ways!  If you cook it slowly and on a lower heat (like the recipe says) and you stir it often, you will not get any burned cheese on the bottom of your pot.

This was a hit with everyone in our family.  This recipe was really easy and tasty.
If you don't like cheese, this recipe won't be for you, but I added even more cheese since we're cheese-lovers and it was really good.  I also used hot pepper cheese, and black bean and corn salsa.  It had just enough of a kick -- nothing too spicy but you could taste it.  In case you can't find "Great Northern beans", white kidney beans are a great substitute.

Well, we all thought it was tasty, but ugly.  It just looked bland.  i couldn't serve it to anyone outside my family just because it looks tasteless, even though we liked eating it.  As for the cheese-sticking-to-the-pan problem, I let it finish simmering and just put the cheese on top.  When it had melted, I took the pot off the heat and stirred the cheese in.  I didn't use a non-stick pan but still didn't have any cheese stuck to it!

We loved this recipe!  I used ground beef and pinto beans to suit our tastes.  It was great!  I used the leftovers the next day to dip tortilla chips in.  I used 1/2 cheddar cheese and 1/2 pepper jack cheese.  It was wonderful!!!

Terriffic!!  This was great!  We added more salsa than the recipe called for (about twice as much) and used canned corn instead of frozen, and it was totally delish!  Served the white chili with corn chips broken up in the bottom of the bowl and now its all gone!  Can control the spicyness with the style of salsa!!

Loved this recipe!   We like fairly spicy food and cheese.  It always goes away at events.  Some people think it's too spicy.  But, the people who love it make up for that.  It's simple, rich and kicked up.  I've never found a better chili recipe.

This was surprisingly good to be so easy! Just be sure to have a brillo pad handy to clean the pot, that cheese is very sticky.

I really liked this recipe.  My husband said this was the best chili he's ever had.  I have never had ground turkey, but could not tell that turkey was in it, so no need to switch it out for beef.  Thanks for the recipe!

Quite yummy. I didn't find jalapeno pepper Cheddar cheese at the store, so I substituted pepper jack (maybe these are different names for the same thing?). Also substituted beef for the turkey. It was quite delicious and not messy to clean up like one reviewer mentioned. I'm not quite sure what that person was doing that involved melted cheese all over the place! My roommates loved this and they went back for seconds...and thirds! It was a real hit. I'd definitely make it again.

A wonderful chili!  I wasn't able to find Jalapeno Cheddar, so I used 4 ozs of Jalapeno Jack and 4 ozs of Cheddar.  Both my husband and I loved it!

This is great! I added an extra can of beans and some extra corn. I didn't drain the beans either. I think that makes it thicker. This will be great for football games with tortilla chips. Yummy!

This was a really great way to use the ground turkey -- which is what I was going for.  I added some red peppers and some hot sauce.  Will difinitely make again!

This recipe is really tasty.  Could be a bit thicker, but I made it in the slow-cooker so maybe that's why it was more "watery".  The only suggestion I have is to serve it with or over tortilla chips.  Great football game watching food!

I don’t seem to have the ability to edit or add to my previous review, but I wanted to say this turned out really good!  I wasn’t able to follow the recipe because of my depleted food stores, but this recipe gave me the blueprint I was looking for for the ingredients I did have on hand.  Thanks Tina B!

Trashy, but good. Added 2x the salsa and a full can of chicken broth. Tastes more like a chip dip than a chili, but does make for a good dip-as-dinner.

This was pretty good and a nice change to try with ground turkey. I also added some chopped onions with the turkey when browning the turkey. I also used only 1 can of beans which was plenty for us. I didn't add any cheese, as I meant to add some shredded cheese to the individual bowls, but then forgot to anyways. It was a very mellow taste, I am sure by not adding any cheese it lessened the flavor. Overall we enjoyed it and filled our bellies with it and it was a good lunch on a cold winter day, but probably won't make it as often as our regular turkey chili recipe. I also made some cornbread to go with it. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This chili was super easy and my family loved it! I used shredded chicken instead of turkey (made even easier with precooked chicken strips). Used 2 cans of Great Northern Beans in Mild Chili sauce and didn't drain or rinse. Also added salt and pepper to taste. Otherwise followed the recipe, and it turned out great! The consistency was perfect, and the flavor was delicious with a mild spicy kick. 

I served it with fresh cilantro on top of each bowl, plus sour cream and hot sauce on the side. Side dishes were a green salad and cheddar biscuits. A great choice for when you need a quick meal or something you can leave on the stove for awhile -- I'll definitely make this again.

This was pretty good and incredibly easy. Next time I would add some fresh garlic and fresh onion when cooking the turkey cause it needed a little more umph.  Maybe use some chicken stock too.

It's simple and so, so good! I like to add onion to the meat while it's browning but it's not necessary.  I also found that this recipe freezes well if you wanted to arrange a pre-made meal.

Excellent and easy--the perfect combo!  I used chicken broth instead of water and diced chicken breast instead of turkey.  The fire can be lessened or heightened depending on the salsa you use.

I have used different types of Pepper Jack cheese (generic and Kraft).  Every time I make this recipe it is a BIG hit.  This is very easy to make and is even tasty cold.

I doubled this recipe.  I used 2 lb ground turkey, 1 cup hot salsa, 1 cup black bean and corn salsa, 12 ounce bag corn, 14 ounce can chicken broth (instead of water), 4 cans northern beans rinsed and drained, and 16 ounces cubed sharp cheddar cheese with two jalapenos minced.  It was delicious, and as other recipes called- I used the Mexican corn bread recipe that is so famous, to serve it with. Rave reviews from guys who normally only want red chili.

So easy and so good! I used a can of corn with green and red peppers in place of the frozen and chipotle cheddar cheese because I couldn't find jalapeño cheddar. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I made this with some chopped smoked turkey that my neighbor had given me over thanksgiving and it was AMAZING. I didn't have the jalapeno cheese so I used cheddar and jack, and then added cajun seasoning and chili powder to it. I would really recommend trying it with the smoked turkey, it works really well in this recipe!

FABULOUS! I'm going to live off this recipe all winter! Followed the recipe to the T, then added a few ingredients to make it my own. Added some chili peppers to up the spice. I like my chili swimming a little so I added about 6 more cups of water. Finally, I added some liquid smoke for a great smokey flavor--this really made the meal! Great recipe for the crock pot!

Super easy and yummy. I substituted turkey with shredded chicken made in the crockpot all day w some olive oil,water and Tastefully Simple Chipotle chilli seasoning. Instead of salsa I used Kroger diced roasted tomatoes salsa style (love this stuff in place of salsa because it's lots of tasty tomatoes). Then just add in the corn, beans, and cheese. I'm making this for the second weekend in a row because my older boys actually fought over the leftovers.

I thought this was the best white chili I've tried so far... though husband didn't rave so I guess I'll keep looking.  However, I did make a lot of changes (I halved the recipe).  To the ground turkey I added 1 tbsp homemade taco seasnong, 1/2 onion, 1 can of green chilis, & a tbsp of canned jalapenos.  I used cheddar cheese & hot salsa.  It was really spicy.  I added 1-2 cups of water since my husband likes his chili on the looser side (it was still really thick so I can't imagine if I hadn't added any).  Topped with sour cream & extra cheddar & served with corn muffins.

I decided on a whim to take part in a chili cook-off at work. I've never made chili before and this one looked easy. I used two cans of chicken rather than ground turkey (I was in a hurry). And I used shredded cheese rather than cutting it into cubes. I threw it together in about 10 minutes (or less) and cooked it in the crock pot instead of on the stove. So easy!! It worked out so well that I won the cook-off! Thanks for this delicious and simple recipe!

I used 2 chicken breasts from a roasted chicken torn in pieces, 2 small cans of chicken broth instead of water, mild salsa instead of medium & 1/4 of a pound of pepper jack cheese/1/4 of a pound of super sharp cheddar. Consistency was better & not as spicy. Really good chili!

We gave this 5 stars not only because it was delicious, but also because of how EASY it was to make.  We don't like to rate recipes unless we have made them exactly as written, but unfortunately we didn't have all the ingredients.  We made the following changes:  used chicken instead of turkey, used regular Cheddar cheese, and added 1/2 cup of jalepeno juice to the 1 cup of water.  We ended up adding another cup of water at the end of cooking, and we threw in a handlful of diced bacon at the last minute.  We will definitely make this again.

I love reading reviews and incorporating a few changes along the way, and this turned out lovely (doubled the recipe).  Used dried beans (soaked), added a lot of chili powder (maybe 1/4 C.) and Lawry's seasoning (2-3 Tbsp) while browning the turkey (the beans soaked up a lot of that flavor, so it even though it seemed heavily seasoned at the time, I knew it would eventually even out); also had added yellow and red bells as well as an onion, three cloves of garlic, and a jar of green chiles during turkey browning.  I then added 1 jar of Salsa con Queso, a jar of medium salsa and a 8 oz bag Mexican 4 cheese blend.  Added a little water to accommodate beans, but just played by ear.  Corn bread muffins rounded things out, and it was a hit.  Super easy and tasty!

I used shredded chicken instead of ground turkey and it turned out great.  The only problem I had with this recipe was the portion size.  It says it serves 8 for one batch.  I made a quadruple batch to serve a large group of 16 (which should have been more than enough) and there was NOT nearly enough.  I will definitely make it again, though.  It was delicious!

I just made this last night, and it was successful.  I gave it 4 stars because of the changes I had incorporated. 
As suggested by MERMAR I made a mexican cornbread to serve this with.  I used the leftover ingredients from the cornbread into the chili.
Changes: Seasoned the turkey meat with salt, pepper, and chili powder while browning.  I added in 2 oz. diced green chilies (left over from cornbread recipe).  I did not use the cheese in the recipe, but instead used the other cup of shredded mexican cheese blend leftover from the cornbread.  I also added in about 2 oz. of cubed Velveeta Queso Blanco cheese just because we like it cheesy.  I only used one can of beans, undrained.  Once I had stirred that in, the bean-meat ratio looked fine to me.  My chili was slightly watery, so maybe I should have drained and rinsed the beans.  I will try that next time.  I also threw in a chicken bouillon cube with the cup of water.
I thought it reminded me of Hamburger Helper, but my husband loved this chili ... and he HATES Hamburger Helper.  So I must be imagining things.
I was missing something crunchy while we ate this, so we also served up tortilla chips and fresh salsa, and had a hearty meal.

I added fresh onion and garlic, along with cumin and chili powder spices to the beef as it browned. I also used Pepper Jack cheese with a little cheddar. It was amazing!! This is a new favorite.

This chili was good.  I did modify slightly. I could not find the cheese recommended so I added green chiles, and used hot salsa for a little kick.  It was very good

This recipe is so easy and for minimal effort you get delicious chili.  I don't even have to measure anymore!  Once you get the basic idea of it down, you can just make it without any thought.  Sometimes I add some fresh chopped tomato, or different kinds of salsa.  I serve it with Jiffy Cornbread mix, with a little honey and vanilla added to the mix.  It's a great meal.  Husband LOVES It.

I really enjoyed this.  Made at the suggestion of my daughter who tasted something similar at a chili cookoff.  Being from the midwest I had NEVER tasted any chili other than tomato based.  You definately need to give this a try.  It is easy to prepare and will be added to my list of comfort foods.    My mission is to add of decent photo of this recipe.  Taste better than it looks.

Awesome- I used a little more water than the recipe and loved it. Will be great for a potluck served with tortilla chips. Topped each bowl with shredded cheddar and sour cream. Affordable, 10 minute, very tasty!

This is comfort food and a very flexible recipe that I will make again.  I omitted salsa and added chorizo, added chicken broth - enough to cover the chicken and bean mixture.

Spicy and delicious but seems like it is missing something. I made it exactly as the recipe described and it was delicious but I guess I just thought it would have more ingredients.  Still - yum!

Man this was delicious!! I had only heard about it in the past so i figured I would take a look.  I checked out several different recipes before finding this one b/c the others seemed so extensive as far as the number of ingredients.  And this one seemed much more thick in the picture compared to the others.  It turned out absolutely fabulous!! I did make a couple of changes.. I took the advice of the other reviewers and used the can of chicken broth rather than water, I drained and washed the beans but I kept the leftover juice in case I needed more which i did.  I added a small diced onion and a can of mushrooms and then cut up very small jalapenos and added them to the mixture.  It was a  great addition to the salsa.  After cooking it for 30 mins I added a tablespoon of sour cream to each bowl and it was a hit.  The first meal I was actually totally excited to eat as a leftover.

I loved this recipe. For anyone who thinks there isn't enough flavor or moisture, try adding more salsa, more water and use habanero cheese. It was really spicy, but very good. I also used frozen, cubed roasted chicken instead of ground turkey. So easy! This is a keeper!

We really liked this, although it could have used a little more spice.  I also think if you left out the turkey it would make a great meatless chili.

Curiously tasty.  I browned half an onion in butter and then cooked the turkey in the same pan.  Also used chicken stock vs. water.  I used Yancey's Fancy  Peppadew cheese.  Huge hit and oh, so easy!  It's on the winter rotation.

With a couple tweaks, this quickly became a 5-star recipe!  First, I added 1 tsp chili powder as I was browning the meat.  Then I substituted chicken broth for the water, and used 2 cups instead of 1.  I used the entire jar of salsa, which was about 2 cups, and I opted for 1 can of great northern beans (drained) and 1 can of black beans (rinsed and drained).  Then I diced an onion, red pepper and green pepper, and added it to the pot.  The final change was to use habanero jack cheese in place of the jalapeno cheddar.  I've never had a problem with consistency (given the additional liquid from the chicken broth and salsa), and always get rave reviews!  Great recipe; thanks!

On of the easiest & best chili's I have ever made!  I added a handful of chopped cilantro, 1 teaspoon cumin, 1 small onion & used chicken broth instead of water. I made it the day before, heated on high for a couple of hours; let it set overnight in the crock pot in the frig & then cooked on low for 3+hours.

sure it's easy, but it's pretty freakin gbland.  i added probably a tsp each of onion powder, garlic powder and 1/2 tsp adobo(w/ cumin).  i also used diced tomatoes with habaneros and had to add extra (shredded mex style) cheese to the pepper cheddar that was already in there. it came out deliciously.

Pretty good- substituted chicken for turkey and doubled the batch.  Added cumin and chili powder.  Served at our superbowl party and people ate it like a dip with Fritos.

This is so super easy and tastes very good.  I made it twice in two days.  I couldn't find chedder jalepeno cheese so I substituted with medium chedder cheese and a 4oz can of jalepenos.  It was super good.  It worked well to use poached chicken instead of the turkey for a change.

This chili was pretty good!  I added my own spices because the cheese didn't add enough flavor for me.  I also added onions and cut out the corn.  I will make this again :)

Made this last night and received great reviews.  Reduced the cheese by 1/2, and still was great.  Instead of water used the liquid from the corn and added chicken broth to make the full cup of liquid.  Used left over chicken from the night b4.  This is a great low fat option for those who love chili.  My fiance makes the best "regular" chili, but he said he likes this much better!! Another keeper recipe!

I printed this recipe out Dec 2004 and have made it over and over since that time.  It  is delicious.  The only changes I made to the recipe are: I add 1 cup of chicken broth and replaced the cheddar cheese with velveeta shredded cheese.  For a little heat I put in 3/4 mild and 1/4 hot pace chunky salsa. Thanks, Tina for an awesomely delicious recipe!

I believe that this is now my favorite chili. It is great as is or as a "base recipe". You can add to this whatever you wish and not destroy it.Try one can Great Northern beans with one can Garbonzo beans. Will definitely be using this recipe for years to come.

Just what I was looking for!  Healthy, quick & very yummy.  Perfect for a rainy fall day.  I added a small can of corn and a nice size dose of minced garlic.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Great! Very satisfying. Even my kids ate it. I used low fat cheese and served it iver brown rice. A very delicous, low-fat, nutritous and easy to prepare meal. You could even pre cook the meat and you would have a quick no fuss meal to prepare after work. I highly reccomend.

What a nice change from the normal meat and bean chili.  The only change I made to this was I used cheddar-jack shredded cheese instead of the spicy cubes.  I think it did something to the consistency because it wasn't as thick as I usually like chili.  However my kids loved it and asked for more!

My search for a good white chili continues!  This one just didn't do it for me or my family.  My son could not even stand to look at it.  It has a weird consistency that happens when you melt down that much cheddar cheese with water or broth.  It should also be called "pink" or "orange" chili!

This has got to be the easiest, yet most impressive recipe I have made!  I used a local stores homemade corn and black bean salsa, and chicken broth instead of water.  I also added another can of beans (mashed) to thicken the chili a bit, and added a little ground cumin and roasted garlic to the ground turkey.  I didn't have any trouble finding the jalapeño pepper cheddar cheese, or have any problems with it melting.  I served it with a griddle corn cake!  Fantastic 30 minute meal!

I followed the recipe exactly, but this turned out really thin and watery.  However, after my fiance got over his inital apprehension at the way it looked, he tried it and said that it tasted really good.  I guess that's what really counts anyway- although as someone else said I probably would not serve this to company because it doesn't look very appealing.

This is a wonderful recipe and is amazingly easy to make. I highly recommend it. 1 note on this recipe is that it took more like 45 mintues to an hour for all the cheese to melt when 1 made it.

Very tasty. Works great with ground turkey, beef, or venison. I added a scoop of sour cream to "creamy" it up a bit. This also freezes well. I made a big batch and froze smaller portions for later.

This recipe is awesome! Everyone in my family loved it and said this one is a keeper. I was not able to find the jalepeno pepper cheddar cheese so I use Pepper Jack cheese. This chili was wonderful with sweet corn bread. Also good as a dip with tortilla chips and crackers.

I took your word that even the pickiest eaters would love this. I was pretty sure you were wrong because my family would faint if they thought I was feeding them ground turkey and white beans are on the list right next to poison. I used pepper jack cheese because that's what I had, chicken broth instead of water and dropped the beans to 1 can.  Placed it on the table expecting to hear cries of "YUCK! This stuff is NASTY!!" To my surprise, even my picky granddaughter ate three servings. This is a keeper, Tina. Thanks for helping me feed my family a tiny bit more healthy.

Such an easy and fast chili!  Great for a cold night.  I only had mild salsa, so I added 3 serrano peppers and some hot spices to the chili. Instead of cooking in the cheese, we just sprinkled a little chedder on top. Thanks for the recipie!

Just made this recipe tonight for my family.  It got good reviews.  I did add salt and cumin to taste.  I simmered it without the cheese because of some food allergies in the family.  I just topped each serving with Pepper Jack cheese as needed.  The cheese is what brings it all together.  Next time I would like to try the cheese that is called for in the recipe.  One request was for more corn and a little more spice.  My kids ate it without complaining, but then, they like beans, so they got into this.

Hubby didn't even realized i used ground turkey! i added a healthy splash of Frank's hot sauce, and sprinkled pepper jack cheese over the top before serving. No problem with it sticking to my pot, either.

This certainly is an easy recipe.  I followed other reviewers and used broth instead of water.  I used chicken broth because that's what I had.  Also I used pepperjack cheese (and only 6 oz.) and I shredded it instead of cutting into cubes.

I make this recipe several times a month.  I use "fresh" salsa from the grocery store and Kroger Hot Pepper cheese.  It makes it nice and spicy.  My family (1 husband, a 10 year old, 9 year old, and 7 year old) loves it.

My husband and I both really liked this dish. It's flavorful and simple/easy to prepare. I used about 4 oz. of hot pepper cheese and there was still a good kick of spicyness.

I used shredded turkey instead of ground and chicken broth instead of water.  It was wonderful!  It may be a little spicy for youngsters, I'd use a mild salsa for them.

This is one of our all-time allrecipes favorites!  We use a shredded pepper-jack cheese blend, and sometimes add a little shredded cheddar on top of each bowl.  Highly recommended if you love spicy food and don't mind the cleanup!

Worked great! I used Perrper-jack cheese instead of jalepeno cheddar (couldn't find) and it was just fine - husband loved it! also added about 1/2 teaspoon black pepper at the end.

Quick •Good•Easy. at first I wasn't sure about how it would be with the Turkey, but I just browned it with a little bacon grease I used more beans also. Really delcious. I think it would make a great corn chowder soup  also.

My family loved it. I just add another pound of ground turkey and while I was cooking the turkey I add 1 cup of onion, 1 clove of garlic, salt, pepper, and allspice to taste. I also add 1 can of chicken stock and only around 6 ounces of pepper jack cheese.

This was easy and yummy but made a few adjustments, thus the four stars.  I browned the turkey with some chopped onion, added a small can of green chilies, used broth instead of water and only one can of beans.  It was still pretty thick, so added almost an entire can of broth to make it more soup-like.  The salsa I used was a pico type salsa, this would be good with a green salsa as well.  After simmering, I added Penzey's pico/salsa seasoning and some salt and pepper.  I also waited to add the cheese and just added a handful to thicken a little (not an entire bag).  It's a good base recipe that can be easily adjusted depending on your mood (and salsa).

This my go to chili. It’s really easy to make and always tastes fabulous!   Made some alterations to the recipe, but it’s in keeping with the original.  Instead of a cup I use a 16 oz jar of Neuman’s Own medium salsa.  Like others suggested, I only rinse 1 can of beans and add 1 can unrinced or drained beans.  I’ve substituted a 12 oz can of beer for the 1 can of water. To be fair it may not be a full can of beer as it should always be tested before adding it to the chili. As to the cheese, I buy a store brand Pepper Jack which comes in 24 oz blocks. Eyeballing the correct amount of cheese (about 1/2) and then adding a slight bit more to taste.  Overall a really easy and fantastic chili!

This was a great, quick and easy, dinner to make. I added fresh garlic, salt and pepper, to the ground turkey and I didn’t use cheese. Next time, I may use hot salsa instead and add chopped cilantro. Would definitely recommend.

This was sooo easy and my family loved it! I have a hard to please crew here, my son is in Culinary Arts! We all felt healthy after eating this too. At first, I was worried that there wouldn’t be enough for my 3 big eaters plus me, but we actually had leftovers!

Took suggestion of another and used shredded rotisserie chicken, chicken broth rather than water, and added red & green peppers and onion. This was delicious! Definitely going to be a regular in the rotation.

Thanks for all the helpful review and tips, which I incorporated here.  The recipe rebel in me used as many as possible.  Used 1 lb. ground turkey + 5 slices of bacon and leveraged up on the veggies.  Chopped in my food processor and added 1 whole onion, 1 whole red pepper, ~ 1.5 c. carrots, and 8 oz. Kale (half of a prewashed bag).  Doubled the frozen corn to 2 cups.  Used 2 cups salsa verde instead of the tomato based salsa.  I doubled the water w/2  tsp. chicken bouillon and added 1 more tsp. bouillon to flavor the other liquids.  I kept 2 cans of beans and did not drain them.  Dairy issues at our house so the pepper jack cheese was a shredded garnish. Served w/chips and cilantro on top, guacamole as optional garnish.

Yummy, easy, everyone in my family loved it! I used dried beans that I cooked in water in the Instant Pot instead of canned beans. Added a little salt at the end -delicious!

I just made a couple changes to make it healthier. I add some chopped up zucchini and carrots and only used 8oz of cheese. I added a can of low sodium chicken broth. A bit of a kick and a good flavor! Thank you for posting this!

We had this tonight.  The main reason that I gave it a 5 star, is that it’s soo easy to make.  We used a medium salsa.  We will probably go with a hot next time, as we like our chili on the spicy side. Thanks for the recipe!

Did not care for this at all! It's bean soup masquerading as chili.  Had to add chili powder it was so bland.  I actually thought my Norwegian ancestors came up with this one!

I just made this tonight, and it was awesome! I look forward to my leftovers for the rest of this week. The only thing I did different was using canned corn in place of frozen, and using the liquid from one of the cans of beans in place of the water. It was perfect. What I love about this recipe is how delicious it is while being both simple and affordable. I always have canned corn and medium salsa on hand, so I only had to buy a few items: Turkey, which is far cheaper than beef, beans, which are a few cents a can, and pepper jack cheese. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again.

This is so easy and delicious.  I used about 1/4 of the cheese and it has a nice kick and is still great.  I also used four (for double reciple) varied cans of white and red beans that I had on hand.

Turned up this simple recipe by adding browned white chicken. Onions, fresh garlic, green & jalapeño peppers. Switched out water for vegetable stock. Anyone who eats your chili will surely think you a genius cook.

I made this last night and everyone loved it. I did make some minor changes. I used 1 can each of northern beans and lite kidney beans. I used 2 cups of mild salsa, omitted the water and used a can of chicken broth. I substituted one can of corn, drained and rinsed, for the frozen. I also added 1/2 of a large onion, chopped,  and 1/2 teaspoon prepared minced garlic. I used my slow cooker on a high setting for 1 hour and this worked for me. Didn't worry about anything scorching. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious and very forgiving. I made a few changes due only to what I had on hand-a bit extra turkey and corn, a bit less cheese. I added a bit of broth after reading other reviews, but not sure it was necessary. I'll definitely make this again.

We really liked this recipe! It was almost better the second day (as most foods are Haha).  I added some spices to mine though in addition to the entire amount of cheese. Added a dash of white pepper,   chili powder, & soul seasoning. Very good and will definitely make again!!

This was pretty good! I used turkey chunks from Thanksgiving leftovers and cut the cheese in half so it wasn't too spicy. My kids also really liked this. The only reason I probably won't make it again (and the reason for 3 instead of 4 stars) is because cleanup was a beast! That melted cheese was stuck on everything!

Made it with one can (and a bit) of chicken broth, can of corn, half a red bell pepper, and shredded chicken seasoned with chili powder. Let it simmer for an hour. A big hit. Thanks.

This chili really is tasty - I made it for our Fall block party and got rave reviews. Another bonus is that it does not need 4 hours to cook! I can easily come home from work and have this on the table in 45 minutes. Bonus for working moms!

Easy to make. I had to purchase 20oz of ground turkey so I used all of it and just added an extra can of beans. I also sautéed a small onion, used hot salsa, never rinsed the beans, and added a half cup of water. Turned out great. I'm going to experiment with less or no cheese, and might put in some sour cream to make it creamier. Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

I doubled the recipe and used half onion and garlic and combo of medium and mild salsa. I  use  ground chicken as well . I diced a few red and green bell peppers (and called it White Christmas chili during Christmas time).  Don't drain all the juice from the beans- use it. Use broth instead of water. Delish!

since AR has disabled notes, i have to insert my notes via a review which really isn't a review--it's just my notes.  i used 20 oz of turkey.  browned it with 1 tb of butter.  when it was about 75% browned, i added a bag of frozen onion/peppers.  i used about 1/4 extra of salsa and corn.  i used 1/2 cup broth and no water.  not sure it needed the broth at all.  i didn't drain the beans.  just  used one can.  added 1 tsp garlic.  used about 4 oz of pepper jack and about a handful of mexicheese.  it was really good.

I have to admit the name just didn't excite me but I kept hearing about it and finally tried it. So glad.  It is just so easy and so good. I'm sorry I didn't make it sooner. The pepper jack cheese makes it nice and  snappy. Will make it over and over. Still don't find the name enticing.

I went off recipe a bit.  Made a big pot for numerous people.  Used Rotisserie chicken and chicken sausage.  Fried the sausage with a medium onion.  Used four cans of navy beans, 16 ounces of regular salsa, one bag corn, three cups chicken stock, and 24 ounces of jack cheese.  I will say it didn't look to appetizing.  Once it cooked and the cheese melted, it looked better. I let it set overnight.  I entered it in chili cook off.  Came in second place.  It tasted get.  The only real effort was cooking the sausage. Will make again soon.

I made 2 separate batches, one I used the turkey meat, the other I used "hot" spicy sausage meat, added a hot salsa to the "hot" batch instead of medium. I also added fresh chopped Cilantro to both batches for a white chili flavor.
I served Sour Cream on the side along a bowl of Jalapenos on the side for those who like the flavor of Jalapenos! 
Obviously this is a very easy type of white chili recipe to make, but has good flavor, mild or "hot"!

So I made this and it was really yummy I'm actually counting calories right now so I used low sodium northern beans for less calories and served it over brown rice so it was more filling

This was delicious.  I kept looking at the recipe throughout the cooking process because it seemed like it needed something else, but it really didn't.
The changes I made.....used lean ground beef (didn't have turkey).  Instead of water, I didn't drain the liquid from the beans.  I used a can of lentils and a can of navy beans because that is what i had.  I also used mozzarella because that is the only white cheese I had. The end result tasted like a tortilla soup chili.  I garnished with cheddar cheese, sour cream and tortilla strips.  So good!

I wasn't too sure about this... Seemed too simple and worried it'd be bland. But the reviews all said otherwise so gave it a shot and WOW... This is SO good! I did use chicken broth instead of water and used a little less pepper jack  than called for and it was still incredibly cheesy. For a less fattening version you can cut the cheese amount in half and it will still be great. I did add 1 1/2 cup of the broth instead of 1 cup. Other reviewers said they used chicken instead of ground turkey but the ground turkey worked perfectly for me. I browned it and added the chicken broth, corn, beans and salsa and let it simmer for an hour and a half on low heat to soften the meat. Then added the cheese the last 15 min. It is ridiculously good. Will definitely make this many more times.

This was absolutely delicious!!! I added salt, pepper, chili powder and onion powder to the turkey as it was browning because, as written, it looks as if the dish could be bland. I served it over rice. This is a great dish for busy weeknights.

Nice alternative to tomato-based chili. I had to decrease the amount of salsa, and use a different kind of cheese, to tone down the spiciness for my little ones.But it was still good!

The flavor was great the day I made it, but when I ate leftovers a day or two later, it really had a distinctive Pace Picante Sauce flavor.  I like PPS, but not at the main flavor in a bowl of chili.  So I would use less of that next time.  I also had a problem with the cheese clumping like some others have mentioned.  I read afterwards that that can happen when the soup/chili is too hot when I add the cheese.  I'm sure that's what did wrong, so I'll fix that the next time.  Will fix this again!

I altered the recipe by using diced tomatoes instead of salsa because of the peppers, onions, and garlic.

It's a winner! Made this last night for a chili cook off, and it received first place! Just substituted water for chicken broth, and garnished with deli- sliced jalapeño peppers.

Was tasty and very filling but I probably wouldn't make it again. Had a weird texture probably due to all the cheese.

Neither my husband or I were crazy about this recipe. It wasn't bad, but isn't something we'd make again. The only thing I did differently was use chicken instead of the ground turkey. Way too much cheese in the recipe to be considered healthy in my book.

This wasn't good. First off it calls for way too much cheese! I started with 8 ounces and I'm glad I did. Even with 8 ounces it tasted like beans in cheese soup. To offset this I added a 3rd can of beans and another 3/4 cup of corn. I also added cumin, cilantro, salt and pepper. Only after adding all of the ingredients and even a little extra water it still tasted like beans in a cheese sauce.

Delish . Made this for me and my fiancé and we loved it . We did do like the other reviewer said and only rinse and drained one can of beans . We also used the skyline habernaro shredded cheese instead of pepper jack . Also added Fritos chips and sour cream on top for a little crunch and to make creamier . Yum yum enjoy :)

Absolutely wonderful and easy I have made this several times already! I put all ingredients in my crockpot except the meat. I boil and shred some chicken and add that to the crockpot, stir and let sit on high for just about 2 hours, great!! This is also easily gluten free for those who need some delicious and nutritious!! Love this recipe!

It is really good, but I did make some changes. I added chicken broth because 1 cup of water just wasn't enough liquid. I also used shredded chicken instead of ground turkey. It is really tasty and is now a regular meal at our house.

I think its a keeper! I did not find it dry at all. Instead of draining and rinsing the beans, I measured the bean liquid and used it as part of the 1 c water.
All you would need to do if you like it spicier is use hot salsa, instead of medium.

So good and easy!!  I used half pepperjack cheese and half colby cheese to cut some of the heat since my family isn't into spicy.  It turned out perfect!  Next time though I think I will leave out the meat and add an extra can of beans.  I didn't think the meat added anything to the dish and it would be a good meatless meal for us.

Great budget friendly and easy meal. I used leftover turkey and diced it up. I also only had black beans and kidney beans on hand and worked out fine.  I wasnt crazy about the cheese in it. I would prefer to sprinkle on it at end in serving bowl.

Delicious and easy.  Threw the ingredients, except cheese, in my crockpot before church, came home and added the cheese and had lunch already done.  Nice.  I added some garlic and cumin since I personally love the flavors. I was actually worried I would have too much broth in my chili, but the cheese thickened it up nicely.  How can any chili be bad with 12oz of cheese in it?

Super easy! I use this recipe a lot. It also works with ground pork and different types of cheeses with kick.

This was easy and did not call for a lot of ingredients so I tried it.  I liked that it was easy and fast. I had to add some seasoning as a bit bland in my opinion but if you adjust to your taste it is a decent recipe.

This was a hit!  Everyone that tried it asked for the recipe and went back for seconds.  It was really easy to make, inexpensive, and delicious.  Although some recommend using chicken rather than ground turkey, everyone I made it for agreed that it was a great change of pace to have a meal with ground turkey.  I took the advice of others and substituted water with chicken broth, otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.

Thought this recipe was very good and a nice alternative to your traditional red chili made with ground beef.  I ended up adding some Cajun seasoning because I needed a bit more flavor to the dish and I do enjoy some spice.  That was the only change I made to the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe, some times vary it using rice instead of corn.  Always works, and tastes great.  Super simple.  Just makes sure you use a salsa you like.

Its fantastic. Simple to make, and tastes great. You can make it spicier if you want, or cool it down if folks don't like it hot.

My family loved this! I didn't use the jalapeno pepper cheddar cheese but just mild cheddar cheese. I seasoned the turkey with garlic,onion, and chili powder, accent, and season salt. I add a stick of butter to it because I drained the beans. I made it with buttered cornbread and this meal was a delight :)

Almost forgot.... I was afraid it might be bland with the ground turkey, so I added a Knorr extra large chicken bouillon cube.  That added some great flavor along with the salsa and toppings I added below.

My boyfriend LOVED this and I make it pretty regularly. I leave out the water and add the cans of beans with the juice, a can of diced chilis and use velveta instead of cheddar. PHENOMINAL!!

Very easy recipe.  I used black beans, undrained, and left out the water/chicken stock - it was a little thick, but I like it better that way. I also put in some spices - cumin, chili powder, oregano, black pepper.

By far it is my favorite use of ground turkey.  Finally a ground turkey meal that tastes like it was meant for ground turkey and not like the turkey was substituted for something tastier just to make it healthier for you!  It was delicious and filling, but I would like to note that (for us) it only served 4.

I make this almost exactly as is. The only thing I do different is I don't drain the beans. I add all the liquid, but I only add about 1/2 of the water. I also don't mix the cheese in, instead I use 1 block of cream cheese for a triple batch and add some shredded cheese on top with some crackers. We make this all the time and just love it!

Awesome!  I used chicken breast that I cooked in slow cooker with 1C broth and about 1 1/2 cups salsa.  When done I shredded chicken and added other ingredients + about 8oz.  Mexican cheese blend.  So good!  Was a party hit.

I altered the recipe a little bit to suit my family's taste and needs.  I started with a dash of garlic and a small chopped onion that I precooked in a little bit of olive oil.  I then add 2 cups of corn instead of 1 and used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of water and in addition to the northern beans I added 1 can of cannelloni beans and because I couldn't find the jalapeño cheese I used 4 cheese Mexi mix and 1 4 oz can of jalapeños.  This had good flavor but next time I make it I will use chicken instead of turkey.  The turkey just didn't taste that great and both hubby and I had a hard time getting over the smell of it.  We topped our bowls with a tsp of sour cream and that gave it a nice cooling touch to the hot in the salsa and jalapeños.  I will definitely make again with everything that I did today and use a rotisserie chicken instead.

I thought this was pretty good, but my husband thought it could have used some more flavor.  When I make it again, I'll flavor the meat with some salt and garlic powder as I brown it.

This was so delicious and so easy.  I agree that the photo doesn't look appetizing, but it tastes great.  The recipe as called for would have been very good, but I added some garlic and trinity mix to the turkey while it browned, just as a matter of personal taste. I love any kind of bean, so I didn't cut back as others recommended.  Can't wait to have it for leftovers tomorrow.  It was cooked through and the cheese was melted well before 30 minutes -- an added plus!  Thanks for this one.

This is a great recipe. Can be made in one skillet or pot. I used ground turkey. Substituted the plain frozen corn for chuck wagon mix. I also used shredded cheese instead. The cubes took a long time to melt. I also added a can of diced jalapenos for extra kick!! My family and friends actually love it!

Huge hit at party! Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. Used white jalapeno pepper cheese instead and it tasted great! Could really make a variety of chilies solely based on the type of cheese you use. Awesome flavor!!!

I just made this and really enjoyed it.  It's easy and tastes great.  We used some wild turkey my husband had shot.  We cooked the breast in the crockpot with some chicken stock and spices then shredded it to add to the chili.  I also added two teaspoons of Cumin for that chili taste.  Thanks for posting this!

This was so easy and very yummy! I did not use the corn, (hubby won't eat it) but I put in some onion and used chicken broth instead of water. I couldn't find the jalapeno pepper cheddar cheese, so I used 1/2 pepper jack and half cheddar. It turned out delicious. I will be definitely be making this again soon!

Great one-dish meal!  I tweaked it using some of the previous reviewers' suggestions - used chopped onion and roasted garlic, used chicken broth instead of water.  I also added some chipotle hot sauce and cumin. Served with Tostitos and sour cream.  Delish!

This is a good & easy recipe. My family loved it. I used monterey jack cheese w/jalapenos instead of cheddar.  You can add so much to this recipe!

YUM YUM YUM!! Soo good, reminds me of chicken tortilla soup. I like to eat mine with tortilla chips. I bought an already prepared rotisserie chicken and stripped the meat rather than using turkey, just throw everything in and heat!! Served it for our Super Bowl party and EVERYONE loved it and were asking for more after we ran out. I always double my recipe(except for the beans) so it lasts more than a day. Delicious!  * I also did not rinse the beans.. I prefer mine with a little more juice and also added a little extra water.

Even my children loved this recipe.  I cut the amount of cheese to about 6 ounces.  I used about 1/2 jalepeno jack cheese and half cheddar Jack so it wasn't so spicy.  I also used mild salsa.  Will try again and add green pepper and onion.

I had trouble getting over the pink-ish color of the soup.  The flavor was pretty good and my husband really liked it, but I think it's just a one timer for me.  If I were to try it again, I think I would use poached chicken instead of ground turnkey, as the ground turkey didn't look too appetizing either.

This was pretty good and even better the next day, but I don't know if I'll be in a big hurry to make it again. I used Pepper Jack cheese and a mild salsa and it had a nice kick to it.

My family and I really liked this. I did make some additions just for personal taste. I started off with 1/4 of a large onion and 1 clove of minced garlic sauteed before I browned the meat. I also used ground chicken as this was what I had. Also, I added about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon cumin during cooking because I really like the smoky taste it adds. I didn't have cheddar with jalapenos so I just used regular cheddar. Lastly, I added fresh chopped cilantro at the end, just before serving. I think it's a great starting point and you can really personalize it to your liking.

I love this recipe.  It's simple and It's a must have at least once a week in our house.  The only thing i did differnt is added some chopped onion and I didn't drain the beans. I also make the allrecipes Mexican Corn Bread along with it that goes perfect.  I reccomend this recipe to everyone.

This was really quite easy. I needed a chili without tomatoes and this one did the trick. I chose a green tomatillo salsa and I added quite a bit more water. It came out more soupy, although the cheese worked to thicken the broth. Since some reviewers felt that there wasn't enough spice, I grabbed a few spices from my cabinet to help round out the flavor: garlic, paprika, curry, bay leave and thyme (because I feel they go well with turkey). I garnished with chopped green onion. It went over really well served with a no-sugar cornbread. Thanks!

This was just okay for me.  I thought the recipe sounded pretty bland as is so I added chopped onion, green chiles and some spices.  The finished product had a decent taste but was really orange and thick.  Maybe less cheese next time?

Super easy and tasted great. I used Pepper Jack cheese, cut the amount by about half and added sour cream for extra creaminess. No complaints- liked it so much I had it for breakfast the next day!

One of our favorite meals. Have made it many times. We typically do not put corn in it. Also, the quality of the ground turkey is tantamount. Have made it once with less-than-white meat and it was horrid.

Fantastic!  I use a Mexican 3-cheese blend in place of jalapeno cheese.  This can be put together very quickly and is consistently delicious and hearty!

I have made this a few times now.  Mine changes slightly, depending on what  I have.  Between processed cheese and the shredded brick cheese, I prefer the shredded.  I also add quite a bit of red pepper flakes, we like things hot.  This chili is filling and so easy to make.

Serve with the "scoops" tortilla chips and you don't need a spoon.  Frozen corn works well instead of canned.  Freezes well too so make a double batch.  To cut the spice but keep the cheese I split the Jalepeno pepper cheese with cheddar.

I made this for dinner and it got rave reviews (I used the Velveeta brand cheese).  I made it again the next week for a work potluck and the kids were mad that I didn't bring home leftovers.  There weren't any.  :)  **Update: instead of cheddar use a block of the Mexican velveeta, it melts very smoothly and gives is a very creamy spicy kick**

This recipe was great.  Added about 2 cups chicken stock and about 1 cup green salsa and 1/2 cup red.  Added less regular shreddedcheddar cheese and almost a full can of diced jalapenos. My boyfriend and his friend loved it.  So did I!!!

I tried this recipe last night and it came out really tasty! I did do a couple of things differently--shred the cheese and double the water, but it was really great! I will make it again on another cold night!

AWESOME! This is my 'new' favorite.  Only thing I did differently was sub out ground turkey for slow cooked chicken breasts.  Cooked chicken on low all day and then came home and drained chicken, added beans and other ingredients to crock pot.  After it was hot again I added the cheese.  Really, really good and I am going to make this again and again!

The best and easiest recipe I have ever made.  I have used chopped pork for the meat (even eliminated meat altogether once), skipped the corn, changed the type & quantity of beans, used different brands of salsa and hot pepper cheese and it came out very good each time.  It is on the spicy side.

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site. So easy to prepare. Great for a busy schedule. Great comfort food. I used one block of Monterey Jack cheese with jalapeno peppers, blends very well.

Wow! Thanks for posting this one. I am covered up in picky eaters around here and they loved it. I tossed in a handful of diced onions and tomatoes and added one more can of beans. It goes onto our rotating menu. Yum!

This tasted very nice. I had used dried beans so even though they had softened, they didn't mash completely. Next time, shallfirst boil beans. Thanks for the great recipe.

Tasted good, looked a little unappealing. I fried 1/2 onion and some mushrooms with the turkey. Used a shredded pizza blend for the cheese and added 1/2 cup sour cream and a tablespoon on cajun seasoning. There was liquid and the there was this big glop of stringy cheese with beans stuck in it. Will make again, but will use cheese as a garnish.

Easy,tasy and fast, what else can you ask for.  I usually add a small can of chopped jalapenos for a little oomph.

Pretty good.  I could not find jalapeno cheddar cheese so I used cheddar and put in some jalapenos.

Very quick and easy recipe!
We used salsa with lime and garlic, added fresh chopped cilantro and subsituted chipolte cheddar for the jalapeno.  The results were fresh taste with a smokey background.
This is a keeper!  Thanks.

This is simmering away on the stove right now and I can't wait to try an entire bowl.  I added onion, garlic, cumin and chili powder as well as salt and pepper to the turkey while it was browning.  The consistency seemed way too thick to me as written, but I like more "juice" in my chili than most I guess.  I used a whole 16 oz. jar of Pace Picante Sauce, 2 cups of water and only 1 can of beans.  The flavor is very good and spicy and the ease of making it can't be beat!

Excellent White Chili recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly and had no trouble with the chili being too watery.  I did add a couple teaspoons of cumin.  I let it simmer for about an hour and it was perfect!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I used Pepper Jack instead of cheddar and chicken stock in place of the water.  Both the hubby and I loved it.  Bought some light sour cream just in case we felt it needed it, but we didn't even open the container.  Great recipe Tina!

so quick and easy to make, and it tastes great too. My children are very picky about cheese, so I used mozzeralla instead spicy jack or cheddar. I also used leftover chicken breasts that I just chopped into small bite size pieces. I like lots of sauce, so I used 1 cup of stock and 1/2 cup water. It was GREAT served over brown jasimine rice. A definate repeater!

This was really good and easy to make.  Substituted chicken for turkey; chicken broth for water; and pepper jack cheese for jalapeno pepper Cheddar cheese.  It didn't look the prettiest but it tasted great.  Made it with corn casserole and toasted bread.  There was some cheese stuck to the pan but nothing a little soaking and elbow grease couldn't handle.  Will DEFINITELY make again!

We all liked this chili. It was so easy to make. I used canned white pinto beans and canned turkey.  I also put the cheese on top of the chili when I served it.

Very yummy and easy to make.  I used ground beef.  I don't like things real spicy, so I only added half the pepper cheese.  I tasted it after 1/2 hour and it needed something, so I did go ahead and add th rest of the pepper cheese.  It was so yummy, I didn't mind the little extra spicy.  My husband loved it too and couldn't beleive when I told him it only took 1/2 hour!

My husband really liked this.  I thought it was too watery and a little bland.  I suppose I could change the type of salsa I used if I decided to make this again.

Heavens to Betsy this is good (and I usually don't go for things like this). It's especially appealing because it is so easy to make. We substituted pepper jack cheese for the cheddar with good success.

Very tasty, but didn't look real good.  Used hot pepper cheese and it had a great spice.  Next time we will try more cheese and salsa for more of a kick.
