I thought this was a great recipe. The only change I made was I used carne Asada seasoning on the chicken!

I modified the recipe; no hot sauce and used flour tortillas. A side of corn and it was delicious and perfect week night meal!

Used this as the inspiration for tonight's BBQ Chicken Tacos. I need to watch carbs so went with flatout bread and cut in half. All I can say is that the wife liked.
