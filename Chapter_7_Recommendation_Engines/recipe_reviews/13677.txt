This recipe gave the turkey the prettiest color I have ever seen.  But the cheese cloth had to be basted about every hour and I ended up taking it off and covering the turkey with foil for the last two hours of cooking. I found that the moistness of the turkey was not really that much different than what I usually get and most of the flavor was in the skin instead of in the meat. Maybe injecting the turkey would allow more of the flavor to come out.  Probably won't do this recipe again, but it was nice to try something different.

I am usually not a big fan of turkey, but wanting to cook a traditional yet unusual dinner for Thanksgiving, I tried this recipe.  Am I glad I did.  I'm sold!  It was the best turkey I ever had.  I will never cook turkey any other way.

Used this recipe for our very first Christmas turkey dinner (we're newlyweds).  My mother-in-law was impressed.  The directions, as written, are not that easy to understand though.

This recipe couldn't have been more perfect! I used it to introduce my British boyfriend and flatmates to Thanksgiving dinner, and it was my first time cooking it as well.  Couldn't find tangerine juice, so used juice from clementines instead, and it still came out perfect.  We also used the Sausage, Apple, & Cranberry stuffing, which was the perfect complement.  Whether you like classic or offbeat, whether it's your first or 30th Thanksgiving, I recommend this recipe.

I made this turkey today for an early Xmas get-together (12/14/02) and it was so-so.  The tangerines and flavor allegedly described in this recipe were not tasted at all.  Anyway, what WAS A HIT was the Awesome cranberry and sausage stuffing - the web link for this recipe is on the same page as "Awesome Tangerine-Glazed Turkey".  WOW - people loved that stuffing and the rosemary, sage, cranberries, celery, sausage ingredients were GREAT tasting!  See my review on the stuffing page - it was just simply delicious and mouth-watering.  Not only did I love the stuffing, so did my other 9 relatives!!!  Try the stuffing!

I couldn't find tangerine juice, so I substituted orange-tangerine juice instead. Although I couldn't taste any tangerine in the turkey, my family said that this was the most moist turkey they have ever had. The gravy, however was REALLY lacking in flavor.....definitely needed some extra spices to make it better.

I cooked this turkey last Thanksgiving (2002) for the pickiest group of people I’ve ever fed, and they thought it was absolutely fabulous. I too thought this was great, better than those old turkey’s my mother used to make (sorry mom) when I was growing up.

Our family did not like this at all, but I gave 2 stars because it looked picture perfect the glaze gives it a golden brown color.

This was a beautiful and juicy turkey (even though I forgot to turn the oven down for the first hour and it got a little extra brown!)  The gravy was a nice change from the "usual" turkey gravy, and I did the sausage and cranberry stuffing - it IS awesome!  This will be my new standard recipe every year! :)

I used this recipe to cook my first Thanksgiving turkey ever, and the results were outstanding. The turkey was so moist and flavorful and had the prettiest color. I soaked it in Citrus Turkey Brine for about 12 hours, then stuffed it with the Awesome Apple and Cranberry Stuffing, and served it with Oranged Cranberry Sauce, Corn and Pea Medley and Green Beans with Hazelnuts and Lemon. But the best of all was the gravy. Yes, it takes several hours of work, but it's not really difficult and trust me, it's worth the effort. My guests were delighted. A complete success.

This is a great tasty and juicy recipe. The turkey always runs-out just right, extremely flavourful. Have had various guest whom are not fond of turkey simply fall in love with it. Honestly, it the besy turkey recipe yet to be found by me. I've been using this recipe for the past 8 years and seems as if it will become a family tradition. Thanks for sharing it!!

Nasty, damned nasty.  Leaves a bitter acrid aftertaste.  Seasoning is ALL wrong.  Avoid at all costs, or you'll just ruin your holiday (and repulse your guests!).

This was truly the best turkey I've made and had!!! it was tender, moist & fell of the bone. I changed a couple of things though, like no cheese cloth but kept basting every 15 - 20 minutes and I used a bit of juice too (white grape juice) for the stuffing I just improvised and the stock was so delicious it sufficed.

This was a great addition to our turkey.  We also injected the bird with the glaze(strained through a cloth).  Nothing but praise from all guests.
