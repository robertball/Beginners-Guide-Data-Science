I took the reviewer suggestion of baking mine @350 for 15 minutes. I didn't drain my salsa, but I used less of it, and I applied it with a fork so that I could get mostly veggie chunks, and it worked very well. Be sure to spray the tops of your tortillas, otherwise they will get dried and chewy rather than deliciously crispy! I did not flip mine because the cooking spray on both sides takes care of the crisping for me. Thanks for the recipe, it was easy& tasty and I'll use this again :)

Boy these are quick and easy!  I brushed melted butter on the outsides of the tortillas and then put them under the broiler.  Keep your eyes on them because they're done in a flash!  I served these for supper with taco salad.

Easy and delicious!  I needed something for my husband to take to work and this was perfect!  I added some leftover grilled chicken and used a blend of cheddar and jack cheeses.  I packed up a little shredded lettuce and sour cream plus a bit of extra salsa on the side.  Not bad for something quick and better than what he'd end up buying.

This was a quick and tasty lunch!  I used mild salsa.  Since the salsa was cold drained it (so it would not be soggy) and preheated it in the microwave.  I also placed my quesadilla in foil for the amount of time stated, then removed the foil and heated an additional 2 minutes (on low).  I like them to be a little on the softer side and not too crisp or dark.  I will definitely make again when I have left over grilled chicken!

This is a great easy, tasty recipe that my entire family enjoyed! I made mine in a skillet and in the broiler of my oven, and both ways worked very well. I also added cooked shredded chicken and browned ground beef as some reviewers suggested. They were delicious! I will make these again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Great recipe, Luke!! I made these with pepper jack cheese and also some leftover colby cheese. After heating we topped them with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and lots of sour cream. Very good! Thanks for sharing this one.

Good recipe Luke - I left my oven rack a little farther from the broiler, and left them in for the time allotted and they were perfect.  We put some sliced black olives on some, and some diced tomatoes on others, dipped in salsa at the table and everyone raved!

I folded these over rather than stacking and brushed  the outsides with melted butter before broiling so they would get golden and crispy!  Great as is or with additions!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I just used mexican blend cheese and the tortillas as I was making this for my picky kids. I chopped up some green onions and sprinkled on one of them though and it was GREAT! Only problem is that they burned pretty badly. I flipped them after 3 minutes and I had some dark spots, so I waited only 1.5 minutes to check on them and there was smoke rolling out of my oven!!! I think next time I won't cook it so close to the broiler!

Broiler was a great idea! I usually pan fry, but this cuts out alot of fat. I didn't have salsa on hand so I sprinkled with hot sauce. Yum! Wish i had sour cream to sop it with.... i need to run to the store!

This recipe was really good and easy to make.  I added some veggies though to fill it up, like green and red peppers, red and green onions, tomatoes and jalepenoes.  Great for anyone who likes a fairly quick but tasty dinner :)

Great recipe.  I do something similar, but use the microwave.  It only takes 30 seconds.

These are simple goodness! I always call this 'Mexican grilled cheese'. Sometimes I just put the cheese inside and serve the salsa on the side because I like the hot/cold contrast. You can easily change up the kinds of cheese, and that's the beauty of this recipe. Sometimes I do them under the broiler, as instructed, and sometimes, I put them into a 400 degree oven until browned and cheese is melted (both are good methods), just remember to sray the tops w/ cooking spray to get a nice crispy quesidilla. I also serve them with sour cream-YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Although a healthy recipe, for us the amount of salsa overwhelms the cheese in this quesadilla.

I've been making these for years without realizing there was a recipe for them - I prefer to heat them in a frying pan for economy of electricity and a quicker meal, though.  Sometimes I add cut up cooked chicken if we want more of a meal out of them. I keep tortillas in the freezer all the time for meals such as this.

Yum! Mommyluvs2cook is right.... How can cheese and salsa, sandwiched between buttery crisp tortillas NOT be good???!!!??!!? It's amazing how simple ingredients, when paired together, can be so darm yummy! :) Not only were these a delicious complement to our soup dinner, preparation couldn't have been easier. Jsut be sure you use the best quality salsa you can get your hands on (it really makes a difference, IMHO). Thanks for sharing your idea, Luke! :-)

Tryed this on the grill when grilling pizza, worked great. Just happened to have a pizza cutter handy. I used the grilling stone. No "Bad" broiler here.

So very delicious and easy, I make these all the time! I do prefer to make these in a skillet though, but sometimes I do use the broiler/oven. I heat 1 teaspoon of oil in my skillet, get it nice and hot over medium high heat and place filled quesadilla and flip over once until nicely browned. I added some refried beans along with the cheese, which is fabulous. I served these with salsa, sour cream and sliced black olives. Such a nice light lunch or late night snack. These are so versatile, adding ingredients you prefer. I also sometimes use colby-jack cheese too. Thanks :)

Such a quick, easy snack or lunch (so easy I eat more than I should!) and very versatile. You can stick with the basics, or add olives, leftover meats, or top with sour cream. I usually cook them in a non-stick skillet instead of the broiler.

I made this just like the recipe except I added thin caramelized onion slices to the cheese filling and baked the quesadilla at 350 for about 15 minutes.

So simple, yet so delicious!  A great base recipe that is perfect as is, or easily added onto by using chicken, bacon, refried beans, or whatever else you have on hand.  This is a great go-to recipe for my kids for a quick snack or light lunch.

This is the easiest way I've found to make a quesadilla.  I don't even bother turning it.  I just broil the one side and it's plenty crispy for me and holds together very well.

These are great! I make them for my family of 9 and we all love it! I add chicken chunks and green pepper to mine for a full meal. The kids love them because they are easy to eat, just pick up. We also dip in sour cream. Yum!!

Be very careful on how close the tortilla is to the broiler. Mine was 4in. and started on fire after 1 minute. Must be hotter than average.

These were good! When I went to taco bell I took some of their little sauce packages (actually- I took quite a few!) and I mixed them in with the Quesadillas and it made them even more delicious. Try it!

I gave this 5 stars because it was the best METHOD of making quesadillas EVER! It doesn't really matter what ingredients you use. Putting them in the oven made them melty and crispy, just perfect. I will forever make quesadillas like this. Thanks Luke!

Good base recipe. Also added diced chicken (cooked) and scallions to the recipe. Did the 15-@-350 recommendation. Flipped the quesadillas half way through. Careful flipping, though, as the contents may fall out in midair.

Eh. Pretty basic recipe, I've been making these since before I looked up recipes to make more interesting quesadillas. I don't understand the broiler/oven business though as a pan on the stove will make for thoroughly melted cheese and nicely browned and crisped tortillas.

This is a quick recipe that is really easy to add your own twist to. I liked that it is broiled rather than fried. I've used it as a appetizer and even a side dish in a pinch. I cut the salsa amount down a lot because 1/2 cup makes it a bit too 'mushy' for us.

I made mine with handmade torillas, mild salsa and mexican blend shredded cheese. Next time I was to try brushing the outside of the tortilla with butter, otherwise I normally use a little bit of extra virgin olive oil.

My daughter loves plain ol' cheese Quesadillas and I'd usually share with her by dipping mine in taco sauce.  Not anymore!  If I'm making Quesadillas and I have salsa this is what I'm making!  My oven was in use so I made mine on the griddle.  Also, I used a Mexican Blend of cheese instead then dipped them in sour cream.  I can't wait to try these with some chicken!

We love quesadillas, I make them normally in a frying pan and my kids just microwave them.  But we tried this recipe by broiling them and it was very good as well!  Can't go wrong with cheesey quesadillas!  Thanks!

I liked the idea of broiling in the oven instead of making them in a pan.  I just used cheese then folded it over.  It was still nice and soft on the bottom.

Made this for my daughters so I didn't add the salsa to them. I only had whole wheat flour tortillas, but they couldn't tell the difference they ate these up!

I made these last year for my son for a Spanish class party. He requested them again for this year's fiesta. He enjoys helping me with them and says they go FAST.He also enjoys them for a quick snack for himself after school.

These quesadillas were good, not great. I used whole wheat tortillas and added some butter on the outside parts of the tortillas just as suggested. I would try this recipe again adding some chicken.

So, I didnt use salsa. I put hot sauce on the CORN tortilla (before and after melting the cheese) as well as topping them with fresh avocado.

I make these for my 9 year old daughter all the time. I leave out the salsa and microwave it for 45 seconds. She loves it and I love the fact that it so easy to make.

These are so easy, can't believe I didn't think of it myself.  My whole family and guests loved them.  Don't put to much salsa in, overflows out.  But YUMMY!

I made this for lunch and loved them. I used a quesadilla maker and they came out perfect. Next time I'm going to add a little bit of chicken. Fast, easy and delicious!
