Delicious recipe! Will definitely make again! I cannot stress enough that the instructions are accurate and should be followed closely. Such as, when it is mentioned that you should remove the yam mixture from the heat after 15 minutes, you should remove the yam mixture. A word of caution, be vigilant in checking on your boiling yams, it is very easy to overcook them making them more difficult to grate. Apart from this, it is an amazing recipe that is very rewarding. I have no doubt that you will soon be saying YES to this jam! Not only did this recipe inspire us to make yam jam, it was also the beginning of our quest to make fig and date jam.
