These are really good. I sliced precooked packaged polenta that was already rolled - which saves a ton of time. I only used half the jar of sauce to bind the sausage and onion - a whole jar may have been too messy (though I put lots more than a teaspoon of the mixture on each polenta slice, so my greediness would account for some of the mess). Thanks for the recipe!
