These were a great hit!  After reading some other reviews, I made a regular brownie mix and used the topping from this recipe.  I substituted 1 tsp. of peppermint extract for the creme de menthe and had no problem melting the chocolate chips down in the microwave.  I'll definately be making these again.  Thanks!

I have a recipe from my mom that's exactly the same as this except that the mint filling uses 3/4 tsp mint extract and 1 tbs water instead of creme de menthe, since my family does not drink alcohol.  These brownies are amazing and my coworkers insist that I bring them to every potluck!  The brownie part is super moist and dense (much different than a box mix!) and the mint cream is very flavorful without being overpowering.  Both the brownie part and the chocolate topping add a nice chocolate flavor without being too sweet (if you use semi-sweet chips in the chocolate topping) and are a perfect balance to the mint cream!

The only reason I didn't give these a 5 is that the brownie part wasn't so good.  It doesn't really taste like chocolate and is pretty bland and chewy in an odd way and tastes like if you bake a brownie mix with apple sauce and fake eggs instead of the real stuff.  But of course there was all that fat in it so it's not fair! :o)  BUT, the mint part (I used 3 teaspoons of mint extract and a few drops of green food coloring) and the chocolate covering were excellent.  Next time I'll just make a different brownie recipe, but use the same topping.  Also, a bit of advice about the chocolate chips:  I think they've changed the recipe for them, because it is IMPOSSIBLE for me to melt chocolate chips in the microwave or on top of the stove without it seizing!!!  Even if the water's not boiling, or the power setting on the microwave is .1 and I check it every 5 seconds, it still seizes up.  It just doesn't make sense because when I was little, I never had problems melting them.  So what I did is get a big bowl of very warm water from the faucet (not so hot that it hurts to stick your hand in it) and put a little metal bowl with the chocolate chips and butter in the water and stirred it until it melted.

My five star rating is only for the mint filling and chocolate topping because I used a box for the brownies. ~ I used an 8x8 pan so mine were thick and after making them a few times, decided for my small pan they are better when I cut the frosting in half!  If you are substituting mint extract use very little; start with 1/4 tsp with 2 T of milk to make it cream together.  Too much mint makes it taste like toothpaste!  Green food coloring gives it a minty look!

SOOOO Good!!! I added 1/4 tsp salt and one tsp vanilla to the brownie mix, and didn't have creme de menthe so I used 1 tsp mint extract. I made a batch of the mint frosting with 3 tsps mint extract as someone suggested, and that was WAY too much. Tasted like toothpaste! Otherwise this is a top notch recipe! Tastes so good & it just melts in  your mouth! Yum!!

Fantastic!  I made these for a potluck at work, and everyone raved about them and wanted the recipe.  I substituted a brownie box mix and used 1 tsp. peppermint extract instead of the creme de menthe. Takes a little planning to account for the cooling steps, but it is worth it!

Oh my goodness...these are sooo good!! And so easy to make.  I just bought the store brownie mix and then made the topping with the peppermint extract.  If the frosting is too lumpy to spread, just add a little water to make it a little thinner.  I also used melted milk chocolate chips as the top layer. It turned out great!!

This recipe was great with the help of the reviewers! I made a boxed brownie mixed and then followed the recipe as directed and it was amazing. I made it for a dinner party and everyone is begging for the recipe!

I don't know if this is fair or not but I took away a star because of the difficulty I had finding "creme de menthe liqueur".  It was even for St Patty's day and no store in my town carried it.  I ended up using mint extract and the flavor just didn't do it for me.  The idea is 5 starts but the hassle and end result warrant 3 in my book.

I love mint and chocolate together. My MIL made these one christmas and I fell in love with them. I couldn't stop eating them. I searched for the recipe and found it here. These are SO good. I made brownies out of Trader Joe's truffle brownie mix and used Creme De Menthe. Outstanding and easy to make. My local liquor wharehouse had 2 kinds of Creme De Menthe, one was clear, the other tinted green. So I bought the green, of course. But for christmas I plan on buying a bottle of clear too and putting red food coloring in one frosting and using the green for the other. Only thing I would change is add more Creme de Menthe, as is it's very very subtle mint flavoring and all I could really taste was the butter. I prefer a more mint flavor, so I added more creme de menthe. Next time I will use less butter and more creme de menthe.

I can only rate the toppings, as I used a box brownie mix like others suggested. The cooling steps could be tedious, but I had enough time, and cut the time a lot by using my chest freezer to cool each time. These were absolutely aMAZing. I used 1 teaspoon of peppermint extract (rather than mint liqueur), with 1 Tablespoon of milk, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and a few drops of green food coloring. My roommates were so impressed by these brownies and I loved them too!!!

I made these exactly as the recipe is written except I substituted 2 tablespoons of peppermint extract for the creme de menthe since these were going for a pre-school event. I also substituted rapadura for the white sugar just to try to cut down on the amount of refined ingrediants. They came out wonderful!! The brownies were very "brownie" like, not cakey at all. The frosting and shell seemed to be in good proportion to the brownie. I plan to make more of these for the holidays. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Yum! Reading others' reviews,, I made my standard brownies and then followed the recipe for the creme de menthe layer as well as the final chocolate layer and let me tell you...the whole thing was one big fudgy,minty, chocolatey delight. A definite winner!

I didn't use syrup but melted some chocolate. It was a HUGE hit at work. And as a mint fanatic, I must say this is going straight in my top list of mint recipes.

I've been making this exact recipe for years!  It is very rich.  We nicknamed them "Death by Chocolate" at our house.  Sometimes instead of the creme de menthe I just use mint extract.

I did not make the brownie part, but the filling and chocolate topping were excellent! Since I used an 8x8 pan, I halved everything. I took the advice of another reviewer and froze each layer for 2 minutes before putting it in the refrigerator. Make sure the mint layer is very cold before spreading the chocolate on!

I was disappointed with these somewhat. The brownie part was extremely easy. The downside was it tasted funny and had a strange texture. The mint part I followed the suggestion of another reviewer using mint extract and water. I thought it tasted good and was bot too minty. I think if the filling and topping were on a different, more fudge like brownie this would taste so much better.

These brownies are amazing!! To save some time, I used pillsbury family- size brownie mix. I also used an 8x8 in pan instead so that the brownies would be extra thick. The first time I made these I used salted butter, but would recommend un-salted butter instead because it gives the mint buttercream a rather salty flavor.

Normally I make brownies out of chocolate chips and butter, or with brownie mix. i was confused when this recipe called for chocolate syrup. I don't like the way they tasted or the texture, but they went over well with my friends. Personally, i prefer making basic brownies from scratch, so I probably won't use this recipe again, but I won't give it bad recommendation in case it works well for someone else. I like the idea of the toppings, but having two layers is a bit much, so I'd probably flavor the brownies and top them with one layer.

Great recipe, tastes more like a cake than a brownie though, I'd also add more creme de menthe to increase the mint flavor

I really shouldn't review this at all bc I changed the recipe so much... I cheated by using a box mix. I wanted a thicker layer of mint, so I used 1 1/2 the amount called for originally. I also used mint extract instead of Creme de Menthe. I think I should have mixed my mint layer longer, it was sort of grainy to me. I sprinked Andes Peppermint Crunch baking pieces over the top of the frosting to make them look festive. They were cute, just not super sure I liked the taste. That being said, I would attempt them again bc they looked so cute on my cookie tray :)

This was so good. My store didn't have creme de menthe so I went with Mint Baileys. It was creamy deliciousness.

Made this for my grandson's 13th birthday.  He loves mint and chocolate.  We all loved it!  My daughter said that this will replace our favorite chocolate cake recipe.  
Make sure you double the frosting otherwise you will be sorry!
Only make it when you are having company..otherwise it is too tempting to have around:)

Sorry, these didn't make it for me. The brownie layer was not a brownie but a cake texture and it didn't have a rich, pronounced chocolate flavor at all. I didn't waste the rest of the ingredients. After baking and tasting the brownie layer it went into the garbage. I will try another chocolate mint brownie recipe. Zero stars :-(

I cheated a bit.  Used a box brownie mix, and 1 tsp peppermint extract and about 1 1/2 to 2 TBS milk in place of the creme de menthe.  I let it set at room temp., then i microwaved a can of frosting for 25 seconds and poured it on and smoothed it out.  Refrig for an hour and it cuts nicely.  It's probably a 5 star recipe, but I gave it 4 just because I didn't follow it to the "T!"

I used a pre-made brownie mix for this. 
I just want to stress the importance of adding milk (or water) tot he confectioners sugar if you are substituting mint extract for the liqueur, i forgot this step and my mint layer was more of a crumbly struessal topping. It made the chocolate topping not settle properly. the brownies tasted great despite this fact. I used about half a teaspoon mint extract in the mint layer and instead of semisweet chips i used andes chocolate mints melted down for the top. It was a great balance of chocolate minty flavor. Tasted much like a girl scouts thin mint.

Great brownies!! I followed the advice and made my own brownie (from a box) and then used the mint frosting and chocolate topping.  They are so easy and amazing!  I used 1 tsp. peppermint extract and my recipes was lost so I guessed for the chocolate topping and used 1 cup chocolate chips and 2 Tbsp. butter, still came out great!

I make a nearly identical version of this adding 1 tsp vanilla to the brownie mix, using the 16oz can of Hershey's syrup (not sure if this is 1.5 cups), adding green food coloring to the filling, and using 1 tsp of peppermint extract rather than creme de menthe.  These are simply the best!

A friend of mine gave me a recipe very similar to this one and I couldn't find it.  I found this one and just used a regular boxed brownie mix like my friend's recipe.  I made these for work and everyone loved them and several asked me for the recipe.

These are delicious!  I made them for a party and everyone loved them.  I just used basic brownie mix but added some dark chocolate/mint chips to the batter.  I've also used store bought frosting and just added peppermint extract which is good if you are in a hurry.  But, the homemade frosting is better.

WOW! These are great and fairly easy (just be sure to factor in the cooling time!)  I multiplied the recipe by 6 for a neighborhood cookie exchange (they were a huge hit!). I also used a brownie mix, because I prefer the non-cakey variety of brownies.   Here are a few hints:    1. Add a tbsp or two of milk to the mint frosting if it is too thick. This will help with the spreading of the frosting and limit the amount of brownie crumbs that pull off of the top and mix in with the frosting layer.  2. After letting the frosting set, but before you pour on the chocolate, use your hand or a flat spatula to level the frosting and push it to the edges. This makes it easier to get the chocolate layer to cover everything evenly and also makes it look nicer when sliced. (If you are really into having them look nice when sliced, it might be worth trying the same leveling trick with the brownies after they cool from the oven. I didn't, but wish I had.)

I made these for a potluck at work and they were a success! Everyone loved them. I liked that the brownie part was cakey and not as rich as usual box brownie mixes. The top was rich and sweet enough to balance the flavors perfectly.

"Obscenely good," was how one guest rated this dessert. I used a chocolate chunk boxed brownie mix. A bit of milk really smoothed out the frosting. Tip: to spread the frosting more easily, keep your spoon or spatula wet to keep it from sticking so much. Topped with dark chocolate drizzles instead of a full layer [added a touch of parafin wax to the chocolate] and made some white chocolate leaves for garnish. Fabuloso!

I didn't care for the brownie recipe.  Other reviewers called the brownies dense and moist but mine were dry and cakey, so I don't know where the disconnect there is.  I believe using 3 eggs instead of 4 might help with this.  The mint frosting is quite stiff, and I had to spread it very carefully with my fingers so as not to tear the brownies.  I found that two tbs of the mint liqueur was not enough mint flavor for me, so I added a third. For the mint frosting to be green, I needed green food coloring--my creme de menthe liqueur is clear. 
Adding butter to the chocolate for the top layer isn't necessary; if you want to cut out some of the fat you can just microwave your chocolate on half power in 30 second bursts, stirring after each burst, until it's melted enough to work with.  Try to use a bowl that doesn't absorb much heat itself.

Yummy but next time will try a different recipe for the brownie base.  The use of creme de menthe was awesome.  I upped that to 3 tbsp plus another tbsp in the top chocolate icing.  Also added green food colouring to the butter layer.

I made this for Thanksgiving and they came out wonderful! I tried a recipe from a coworker some years ago, but the brownie part didn't come our right for me. I have never had luck with brownies. But this recipe came out nice and moist and oh the creme de menthe! Thanks for this recipe; finally a brownie that works for me!

I've been making this exact recipe for years. My daughter has been requesting it every year for her birthday cake since she was about 7. She's 15 now and still loves it. I used to make it the quick and easy way substituting a boxed brownie mix. Not anymore! The chocolate cake part of this recipe is just too good (way better than box brownies) and the texture is unique. We like it with Hershey's Dark syrup even better. The mint layer is also better with the green creme de menthe liqueur than it is with mint extract. I only use the liqueur when I make it now. I only buy semisweet chips which makes this dessert taste soooo yummy!!

I used some other review recommendations and the results were okay; this recipe has potential.

What was great: Using a different brownie recipe.

What was not-so-great: Using peppermint extract (I could taste the alcohol using just 1 1/2 tsp.) 

Next time, I'll try the creme de menthe liqueur as written; and I'll make a slightly larger batch of ganache for the top layer.

My mom first made these almost 20 years ago and I have always loved them. I think it is the name that is confusing people - its not really a brownie recipe. I've always made them with mint extract and they turn out well.

A great potluck recipe - everyone loves them!!!  Very VERY easy if you use one of the fudge boxed brownie mixes (yes, I know the recipe says to make them from scratch but I just didn't have that kind of time).  And very impressive.  I did swap out the creme de menthe liqueur for 1 teaspoon of mint extract and 2 Tablespoons of water as suggested by a reviewer.  I can't imagine that would change the results.  All in all, a fantastic recipe.

These turned out great.  My mint cream was a little thick so I added a touch more creme de menthe.  Also, there are two types of creme de menthe - one is clear.  I used this one so I also needed green food coloring to color my mint cream.

I've made these a few times and everybody always loves them!

After reading some other reviews I replaced the creme de menthe liqueur with a little peppermint exact, only 2 teaspoons because of how strong it is.

One time when I was in a hurry I just used a box brownie mix and still followed the steps for the topping. Still turned out great!

My review is for the frosting only as I used a box brownie mix. I only gave it 3 stars because when I tested the mint part after mixing, I barely tasted the Creme de Menthe. All I tasted was butter, so, I poured more Creme de Menthe in which made it runnier, so, i added more powdered sugar. I even added a splash of peppermint extract. Ok, NOW I could taste the Creme de Menthe! They're good. If i made these again I might just go with the extract instead and use less butter.

I did not care for this recipe. The brownie was more like cake than flaky brownies. It was quite dry but the top was too moist! My mother did not like the mint icing. I followed all of the directions, I don't know what went wrong! I thought this would be a simple recipe, guess not! I am not a beginning baker, either.

Review is for the mint cream and topping only as I used a boxed brownie mis.  I used 1 tsp of peppermint extract and it turned out wonderful.  For the chocolate topping I only used 3 tablespoons of butter and it turned out perfect as well.  Thanks for a great recipe.

The toppings were good, but the brownie itself was bland and not at all impressive.  I'll use the topping again sometime, but with a fudge-type brownie. And for those of you who want to use mint extract instead of creme de menthe because you "don't drink alcohol"- be advised that mint extract is 89% alcohol. Creme de menthe is 15% alcohol.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  The mint and chocolate topping for this were excellent!  The brownie was a little bland.  While I agree that a light cake like brownie would be best with this rich topping, I think this one may have been just a little too light in flavor for my taste.  I think a typical fudge brownie box mix might be too rich.  Next time I'll either try another homemade browie recipe made with cocoa or maybe a box mix following the 'cake like brownies' directions and then use this topping recipe.  All in all still really good though!  Oh and it was much better at room temperature when the toppings were soft and creamy rather than cold and stiff......Ive made this lots of times now and Ive changed to liking it better cold  :)  Still great!  I just buy dark chocolate brownie mix and follow the cake like brownie directions (add an extra egg)

Everybody keeps raving about the mint and chocolate toppings, which I agree is fantastic. But I also love the brownie part. Using the chocolate syrup makes for a very tasty moist brownie which I find so much better than a box mix. Its also extremely easy to make. You just mix everything together and pour it in the pan. My mom has been making this recipe for 20 years and it is my most favorite dessert.

Put this on top of Ghiradelli Double Chocolate brownie mix.  It was excellent.  The chocolate layer on top made a nice, solid layer on top of the softer minty creamy layer.  I used peppermint extract and 2 drops green food coloring.

As some other people, I also used pure peppermint extract instead of the liqueur, though if I had some of that on hand, I would have used it. I'm bringing these to my family's christmas get-together, I hope they're a hit. They're really a great treat for those with sweet tooths. The mint = amazing.. Believe me, these are to die for at least once a year, christmas holidays being the complete perfect time! Fluffy and tastey, a must-try.

My family and I LOVE this brownie. My mom has been making it for years, we call it the Creme de Menthe brownie. She also adds green food coloring to the mint filling, just to look festive. I just asked her last night if she was making them this year :)  Also, these freeze great! We have freezed them for up to a year and they come out perfect and good. We usually can't wait until they are thawed before cutting into them. I have even traveled from MD to FL on plane with packages of these... you will love them, guaranteed!

This was quite good! I took others suggestions and made a boxed brownie mix and I had to improvise on the mint middle, it was really dry and crumbly so I used milk to smooth it out and make it spreadable and it turned out excellent! and for the top I microwaved the chocolate chips and butter, stirring every 30 seconds. my husband is a chocolate mint fiend and loved this!

They were ok. Brought them for a friend's bday at work and really wished I had made my own brownie base, but they got eaten and tasted pretty good.  But I really recommend making your own base- 4 eggs?  That just made it so chewy- not in a yummy gooey way- more like a kitchen sponge.

You need to be prepared to spend a little time on them though since they do have three layers and a little wait time between making each layer.

I have made these as per instructions and they are great. I have also made them with a brownie mix and they are great that way as well. I did not have creme de menthe liqueur so I substituted one-half teaspoon of mint extract. I used 2 drops of green food coloring and that made a nice color green. I feel one teaspoon of mint extract would be too much. These are always well received!

I am not a big dark chocolate fan, but I do like it when accompanied with mint.  These look great, and taste even better. This recipe is delicious as written, however sometimes I substitute about 1/3 of the chocolate chips with Andes mint chips prior to melting for a little additional mint flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yum. Used the recipe for the mint layer and top. I had to make 1.5x the amount for enough mint creme for a 13 x 9 pan.

We thought these were delicious!  I made these to take to the boy's water polo banquet and they were a hit!  I did not have the liqueur so I used 1 tsp of peppermint extract and they came out perfect!  That was the only change I made to the recipe.  I did find the brownies to be a bit bland by themselves but once you add the mint and chocolate layers, it comes together nicely.  They did take longer to bake than the recipe states.  Will make these again!

These things are dangerously easy to make, especially when you take the easy route and use a box mix for the brownies.

Awesome recipe!! I followed the recipeeaxact except for the creme de minthe. I used 1 tablespoon mint extract and 1 tablespoon water in lieu of the mint alcohol.  And I used dark chocolate chips for topping rather than semi-sweet chips.  Tastes like Fannie May mint meltaways!!  So yummy!!!!! Brwonie recipe turned out well, too. I did not use a box mix as other reviewers have. Homemade all the way!!!

O M G this is a phenomenal dessert!
i URGE you to not buy prepared frosting & adding mint extract... making the real deal is easy ( i mean,youre already knee deep in fresh dessert mode so why stop now?) & worth it..
tip: i used mint extract & heavy whipping cream instead of the milk trick when making the mint frosting.
yes, this will take a day (you need to fridge the minted  brownies so they'll semi -harden)
i made this xmas eve day (amongst my other cooking-- yes im crazy!) for xmas day  dinner & my family LOVED IT... i felt like super star chef!
i will cherish this recipe forever!

I used boxed brownies....It was pretty good just wish the mint portion was a different icing because powdered sugar is way to sweet

I thought the brownies had a strange spongy texture and a weak chocolate taste.  They were much different than a traditional brownie recipe.  I liked the mint chocolate topping.  They tasted much better when they were refrigerated.

Absolutely fabulous!if you like peppermint patties you will love this. I used my fave boxed  brownie mix and took other reviewers ideas to use mint extract instead of creme de menthe and a couple of drops of green food color.

I also made this for those like chocolate and orange, by substituting triple sec for the creme de menthe, though you could also use creme de banana, kirsch, or kahlua, just to name a few options for altering the flavor.

I'm a brownie fan. I made it with a boxed mix and added peppermint extract and green food coloring to the filling. (I think I put in to much peppermint). Next time I'm gonna use half the filling, and less peppermint...The only reason it didn't get a five was because it is very time consuming.

This was a great idea! I used a Duncan Hines brownie mix. I used smart balance instead of the butter for the filling. Next time I'll try margarine, to keep it non-dairy. I used mint extract instead of the liqueur. It was yummy and got rave reviews! Thanks   Kim!

Followed recipe except:  used Betty Crocker Fudge brownie mix.  At $1, it is the best box brownie mix ever, my mom makes the same.  As for the mint flavor, I used 1tsp of mint extract instead.  Delicious and it was a hit at work, making it again this week for home!

I hate it when people totally change the recipe and then review it, and then here I am about to do the same thing--sorry.  I really do this deserves 5 stars based on the idea, but this is what I did.  I used boxed brownie mix (Ghiradelli has been the best quality I've found), and instead of Creme de Menthe, I used peppermint extract.  Everything else I left the same and let me tell ya, these are a huge hit every time I make them!  Love this recipe--thanks for sharing!

These are Amazing!! My family really likes mint, so everyone loved it! I used just a brownie mix for the base then put the cream layer and chocolate, it works really well and doesnt take as long and doesnt use all that chocolate syrup....even though that makes it really rich and delicious too!

These turned out better than I had hoped since I had not tried baking brownies with chocolate syrup before. I do suggest using a quality brand however for more taste. My favorite was the icing. Could probably add a dash more Creme de Menthe than what is called for if you like more mint flavor. I also used bittersweet chocolate for the topping and cut back on the sugar a bit in recipe. I used unsalted butter, but would recommend salted for more flavor. My guests liked them and almost ate the entire pan!

Delicious. I added 1 tsp of peppermint extract(which was more than enough) in place of the creme de menthe liquer. Also added some green food coloring for St. Patrick's Day. I will try other extracts too because I feel many different flavors will work in the recipe.

I substituted I Tbs. water, 1/2 tsp. mint extract and 3 drops green food coloring for the creme de menthe liqueur (as suggested on the Hershey's web site). The cream center and glaze are good, and everything tastes OK together, but the brownie part is very dry and kind of tasteless. A little vanilla would help, but I would probably just use a different brownie recipe. Even a brownie mix (ugh!) would be better.

I used a boxed brownie mix in a 9x9, so I halved the ingredients for the creme de menthe layer and the chocolate topping.  The creme de menthe layer turned out soupy and never set up (although my butter was closer to melted than softened), which made spreading the chocolate layer over top difficult.  Then, the chocolate layer cracked when I went to cut the brownies after letting them chill in the fridge overnight, and the (still soupy) creme de menthe layer squished out all over.  Taste was good, though.

Everyone loves this recipie but I think using a boxed brownie mix would make it better. The recipie produces a cake-like, mediocre brownie. The mint and toping make this brownie.

When making the frosting, make sure you use PEPPERMINT extract if you are substituting for creme de menthe. I made the mistake of using mint extract and the brownies had a spearmint taste and ruined the brownies.

I stuck with my own brownie recipe, but oh man, the mint cream and chocolate icing...soo good!  I am very glad that I used creme de menthe as called for as opposed to straying and using mint extract, I also added one drop of green food coloring to give it a more minty look.  I melted the choc chips and butter stove top, in a sauce pan over low heat, with no problems.  Thanks Kim, this is a keeper! =)

I have not made this recipe, but I grew up eating these bars.  I read some of the other reviews and I couldn't imagine making these using a brownie mix.  My mother's recipe for the brownie portion is slightly different and I think it's delicious - she uses a stick of margarine (rather than butter), a whole 16 oz. bottle of Hershey's syrup and a 1/2t baking powder.  I think that layer is delicious that way and is way better than a brownie layer would be.  She also uses 1t peppermint extract for the mint flavoring.  I love these!

Seriously SO good!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used a boxed brownie mix, however I would reccomend using two boxes in a 9x13 sized pan, 1 box made the brownies a little thin with loads of mint. I used peppermint extract (1 tsp) instead of the creme de menthe liqueur.  The chocolate topping was WAY too buttery (6 tablespoons was way too much 2 or 3 would have been perfect) so I added another cup of chocolate chips, which turned out perfect.  I melted the butter and chocolate chips in the microwave in 30 second intervals, only took about 1 min.  They were so yummy!  Took them to a party and everyone asked for the recipe, it's so easy to make too.  Yummy!  Thanks for the recipe, I've been looking to spice up brownies for a while now and this was the first time I've tired.

I made the brownies and had to throw them away.  They were thick, rubbery, chewy, and tasted extremely eggy (like bad flan).  I threw out the brownies and made One Bowl Brownies from this site.  I then made the toppings, with 2 teaspoons peppermint extract instead of the liquor and 2 drops of green food coloring.  The topping on this recipe was good, the brownies part was not.

very easy to make, make sure the brownies are completely chilled before putting mint topping on or the brownies will tear. these are a crowd favorite!

These are great.  I was actually expecting the brownie part to be chewy and rubbery, based on some of the reviews, but it wasn't at all.  It was great.  I used 1.5 teaspoons of peppermint extract in the frosting, instead of creme de menthe.  I had no problems melting the choco chips/butter on the stovetop, and I don't have a double broiler.  I just used a very small, good-quality saucepan over the lowest heat.  Then I set it aside for about 20-30 minutes to let it cool a little so it wouldnt' melt the mint frosting.  these were so tasty and I want to try making orange-flavored frosting next!

The 'brownie' part is very cakelike.  Weird texture.  At first I thought I had made a mistake with the recipe. The frosting part is good.  I would recommend microwaving the butter and choc chips for one minute, then stir.

I will not make these again.  The brownies were soggy and the mint topping had a runny consistency.  I can see how this recipe would be good if I tinkered with the bake time and amt. of sugar and mint in the topping, but first impressions are lasting ones, I guess.  My dad loved them, though, so 5 stars from him.

Ok, I like rich desserts, but this was toooo much.  I cut down the amount of butter, but that's still all I could taste.  Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream they were ok, but otherwise they were way too sweet.  I brought some to my office, cut into very small pieces, and they guys ate them but they all agreed that they were too sweet.  Sorry, too time consuming and fattening and sweet for me to keep.

I made these for a company party and they were delicious! They were gone in what seemed like 60 seconds! Instead of creme de menthe, I used about a tablespoon of mint extract. Be sure to taste-test the mint filling so it's not too minty!

I read other reviews and decided to use a Betty Crocker Fudge Brownie mix instead of the brownie recipe on here. I used mint extract instead of the liquor. I had no issues melting the semi sweet chips but I do recommend the Hershey’s Semi Sweet chips. These turned out amazing. Really rich. They taste exactly like a thin mint Girl Scout cookie.

This recipe was in one of my mom's Taste of Home cook books more than 20 years ago.  It was great back then.  I have been making it  since I got married 18 years ago and have been asked for the recipe over and over.  Most of the time I just use peppermint extract.

Easy recipe and tasted great. Base is nice balance. Boxed brownies would be too sweet. Substituted 1 tsp of peppermint extract and a couple drops of green food coloring for the creme de menthe and it tasted just like my grandma used to make.

If you use a box mix for the brownie part, you are missing out.  It's not even close to how good the recipe is for this brownie. I've done it both ways, and hands down, the one made from scratch is infinitely better. It all works together, so don't cheat yourself.

This was an absolute thumbs up with my family!!  The extensive preparation of it is so worth it!!  I used a brownie mix  and 1 tsp of mint extract as a substitute for the crème de menthe.  I also added some finely chopped fresh mint leaves to take the mint flavor to another level and the brownies tasted like York Peppermint Patties! Yum!

2 boxes of TJ brownie mix in an 11 x 14 pan and then the layers on top.  very little green food coloring for a pretty spring color. and 1/4 tsp of the mint flavor was definitely enough, substituting peppermint flavor for creme de menthe.  Rich and yummy.  My 16 year old and friends loved them, as well as my mom's group!  One other note, my chocolate top layer was a hard shell and could easily break when I used a spatula to cut it right out of fridge.  I decided to let it sit out a bit and use a pizza cutter.  Worked much better.

I made this dessert to bring in to work for my birthday.  It was a hit!!!  Gone in 30 minutes!  It was fabulous.  And as to another comment on here - I found the crème de menthe liqueur at our grocery store.  I'm pretty sure most stores carry it.  She must have overlooked it!  Any liquor store would definitely have it!  I would give this 10 stars if they were available!!!!!

I made these brownies only because I had some chocolate syrup to use up.  WOW!!  These were fantastic!!!  I did not have Creme de Menthe, so I substituted amaretto....OMG so good!  Next time, I might make them with butterscotch liqueur...any flavored liqueur you like would work well.  This is now my favorite brownie recipe!

1/1/16- EXCELLENT. Used ghiradelli double fudge brownie mix. 7x9 glass pan. Mint layer as directed (substituted 1 1/2tsp mint extract) Added green food color. Topped with mixture of ghiradelli milk chic morsels, nestle semi sweet morsels and butter. Would try something that hardens less. (More fudge consistency?) decorated with peppermint covered pretzels. Made 16. Would consider using different topping (crushed mints/canes? Andes candies?). Smaller topping so could make brownies smaller.
7/10/16- made as written. Used Ghird. semisweet morsels. Perfect. Glass 7x9 cut into 20.  Should have been smaller still (24?). No topping/decoration.

These are great! But you can't really taste the mint all that much. If you like mint, I would add more...otherwise it was great as is!

Mercy, these are incredible!  I took others' advice and used a brownie mix (from Aldi's which is the best box mix I have ever tried) instead of going from scratch.  I also went with 1 T peppermint extract and some green food coloring instead of the creme de menthe.  Will try using 2 tsp. of extract the next time.  DELICIOUS!

ADVICE FOR THE MINT LAYER--add 2-3 tsp of water to the mint layer frosting to help it smooth out.  It will hydrate the powdered sugar and help it spread much better.  Also, be sure to let each layer cool COMPLETELY before doing the next, otherwise you will have swirly frosting layers and the brownie will be mushy and crumbly.  

This is almost exactly like the recipe that I have grown up with in my mom's house.  I always only make a half batch otherwise I will eat the entire thing.

Awesome!  I took the advice from others and used a box brownie mix, used 2 tsp of peppermint extract instead of creme de menthe and chilled about 30 minutes before spreading on the chocolate layer.  Took them to a party and they were a huge success!

Very good mint mixture (tastes like peppermint patty filling!).  I used box brownie mixture because I didn't feel like making homemade.  I also used peppermint extract because I didn't have the creme de menthe.  Use sparingly - you can always add more!  I think I started with just under a T and that was plenty.  To get the mixture to a good consistency, I just supplemented with a little water.  My brownies only made an 8x8 - don't use all of your toppings if this is your case, otherwise it is too thick and too rich - I learned.  I also think a cake-like brownie, as opposed to fudge-like, would have been better, because the topping is gooey enough.  I will definitely make again!  You can color the mixture red for Christmas!

The good thing about these brownies are the look of them. The texture and taste of the brownies are blah. The frosting doesn't have the best of taste. The chocolate on top cracks when you cut into it so you have to be careful. I made these for a dinner. Thankfully I tried them before I took them. In the last hour before I had to leave, I quickly made up different brownies to take. If you want something similar to these brownies, I would recommend using the "Best Brownies" recipe and using the frosting recipe from it with a few Junior Mints in it to give it the minty flavor.

These were very good but not excellent. I thought the brownie was okay but it needed a kick of flavor or something. I do like my brownies cakey so these were perfect as for that. The mint layer was good, I added 3T of creme de menthe and was still a bit disappointed that it was not mintier. The chocolate layer I used 3 flavors, semi, milk and dark, all equaling 1 cup. I also then added 1T peppermint schnapps to try an add more mint flavor. All in all, I will make these again and all my guests loved them. Oh, I did add green color to the sugar frosting for St Patricks Day.

This was well recieved. However I did use the other recommendations from the reviews by using a different brownie base. I used a dark chocolate brownie that I knew was chewey and moist. They were a hit! Thank you for a new St. Patty's dessert.

Delicious! I used the Chocolate Bliss Brownies for the base and just added the topping. I thought this would be difficult to make the layers but it was easy! Easily the best brownies I have ever made.

I made this recipe for a potluck and they turned out great. The layers look nice and taste just as good. There were some people who did not eat them b/c of the liquer in it. So next time i'll use food coloring and mint extract. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I cheated like everyone else... I used a boxed brownie mix.... yummy! And instead of the creme de minthe, I used pure peppermint extract. These were a huge hit at a party I took them too. I have had to make them again. I am going to try them next time using the given brownie recipe.

So good, at least the toppings are.  I tried the brownie recipe here and it wasn't very good.  I now just use brownies from a box, but still with this topping, because the mint and chocolate on top is just amazing.

These were great! I used Betty Crocker's brownie mix and I also used 1 tsp of peppermint extract in place of creme de menthe.  I used dark chocolate chips for the topping instead of semisweet.  These seriously tasted just like girl scout cookies, especially when you eat them chilled.  Sooo good!

I took the advice of everyone else and used boxes brownie mix.   So this review is only for the mint and chocolate toppings.  I used 2 to 3 tsp peppermint flavoring with just a bit a milk to help it get creamy.  took a while for the mint to set up enough to spread on the chocolate, wish I would have prepared for that.  the chocolate topping was also very good although I think the amount of butter could be cut down. 6 tbsp is a lot of butter for only 1 cup of chocolate chips.

Rating is for mint and chocolate topping layer only, used my favorite box mix for the brownie layer  Made with peppermint extract and ohhh, these are good.  A wonderful way to dress up a brownie.  A little time heavy, with the waiting for the browinies to cool and then waiting for the mint layer to firm up in the fridge, but sooo worth planning ahead.

this rating is basically for the mint/chocolate topping as well.  I basically used Betty Crocker's Hershey fudge brownie mix.  however, for the mint cream I used what I had on hand and added about 2-2.5 tsp of peppermint extract (make sure to get peppermint and not spearmint) to it, along with a couple of drops of green food coloring.  the other change I made was with the chocolate sauce.  i only had milk chocolate chips on hand, so I used a cup of those, but instead of 6 tbsp of butter, I used about 4 tbsp.  these came out very delicious, and I felt they were just fine with the brownie mix I made them with.

I agree - you can use the topping on any brownie recipe. My son asked for this instead of cake on his birthday!  My son made it once with creme de menthe, and he says he liked it better with mint flavoring.

WARNING: this recipe is time-consuming (although very delicious!) i only gave it 4 stars because i took another reviewer's advice and used a different brownie recipe (Brooke's Bombshell Brownies). the mint and chocolate layers from this recipe gave the brownie that extra "fancy" look and kicked a plain ol' brownie up a notch. next time i would reduce the amount of butter used for the chocolate topping to only 2 or 3 tablespoons--6 seemed like a bit much. other than that, this recipe was great!

My new favorite dessert!  I only gave it four stars because I couldn't figure out how to get the chocolate to spread on top of the mint layer.  I ended up having to mix them and making it look a little marbled.  But other than that, they were awesome!

This is a great recipe. I took others advice and used a prepackaged brownie.  I used 2 1/2 T milk and a half a teaspoon of mint extrace instead of the creme de menthe. Rave reviews everytime I make these. Thanks!

These were "OK". A little too sweet for my liking (my bf agrees).... I made a batch to go with the St. Pat's Day themed meal that I prepared last night for my bf and I. Instead of using a 9x13-inch baking dish, I used my 8x8-inch stoneware one (my brownies were very thick!). I didn't make the brownie part of this recipe due to time constraints and other's complaints about the texture. Instead, I used a Betty Crocker fudge brownie mix. I did make the mint and chocolate layers though. To improvise in order to use what I had on hand, I subbed 1.5 tsp. of mint (not peppermint!) extract and a 1/4 tsp. of green food coloring for the creme de menthe called for. My brownies were VERY green (more than I'd like - I'd cut back on the food coloring next time) and only subtly minty (I could have easily used 2 tsp. extract IMHO). I also subbed mint chocolate chips left-over from the holidays for chocolate chips (melted in a double boiler over low heat). My mint layer only needed to "set" for about a half hour. I let the chocolate layer set for the full hour as directed. Again, good, but not WOW! I guess my bf and I are just not fans of frosted brownies. Thanks anyways!

The five stars is for the topping and filling, I DID NOT make the brownie from this recipe.  It could even had been a bit more mintier for my liking but I will be using this recipe again.

Very rich! But these were pretty good. I used peppermint extract. I like a lot of peppermint, so I put in a teaspoon, maybe a little more. I prefer them cold, so I put them in the fridge. Oh, and my hubby said the green filling would make a yummy center to an oreo cookie. I doubt I'd make these again, but it was good to try.

This recipe was really easy to make and it tasted great. I made only two changes to the recipe. First, I didn't have Creme de Menthe and couldn't find it on short notice, so I used 2 1/2 tsps of mint extract. I think it gave the brownies the perfect level of mintiness. everyone thought I had topped them with Andes Mints. 
Second, I did not use butter when melting the chocolate chips. The result of this is that the chocolate on top of the brownies was hard to cut, but they tasted great.
In the future, I will definitely reduce the amount of butter and use some oil. I think the butter makes the recipe a bit heavy.

I made this with a store bought brownie mix.  I thought that made this a little to sweet.  This brownie recipe makes a little less sweet brownie to off set the very sweet topping.  I will use this recipe next time for the brownie.  I will only rate the topping this time which was fantastic.  I took to a church function and everyone loved them.  I did use mint extract instead of the liqueur.

Great recipe!  I read some of the reviews and decided to use Betty Crocker Chocolate Chunk Brownies.  For the mint filling, I used 3 tsp of peppermint extract and green food coloring.  Everyone raved about these brownies!

The brownie part of this brownie actually tasted pretty good. The "mint" part was probably what turned me off. I actually used the creme de menthe - making the brownies taste funny, you could taste the alcohol aftertaste. I wish I would have taken the suggestion of others to use mint extract, but the whole reason I wanted to make this in the first place was to use up a bottle of creme de menthe, which no one here seems to want to drink in the first place. So I think the real reason this recipe isn't good is because the nature of creme de menthe, which i might just throw out...
Next time I'll use the extract.

I made the "best brownies" for the base (although that recipe yeilds only an 8x8 pan I baked in a 9x13 and reduced the time to 15 minutes), then followed this recipe for the remainder. Substituted 1/2 T of mint extract for the creme de menthe. I recommend making all of the layers at once, even though you won't assemble until the layers are each set. This way the mint/sugar in the middle has a while to meld. And place the choc chips and butter in a glass bowl and set on top of the oven while the brownies are baking, as to allow them to start melting slowly.

All I can say is "OH M-Y G-O-D!" These are absoultely wonderful.  If you are into chocolate than I highly recommend these.  Even my sister, who really isn't a sweet eater, couldn't stop eating them.  I made them for my St. Patty's party and have already been told that I am to make the for ALL of our family gatherings.  It is a quick and easy recipe--doesn't take long to make and certainly doesn't take long to eat!

I have made this recipe for years, and it has always been requested. Lost my recipe, and luckily, found it here, exactly as I remembered. Making these for Christmas as requested by my family. The only change I made was to put them in a sheet pan, for thinner pieces. They are very rich, and beloved by all.

This was a very easy dessert to make.  But you do have to make time to cool the brownies.  They were just the right amount of sweetness.  I might add more creme de menthe next time.

For this first time I didn't make any changes to the recipe. The brownies themselves could be a little bit chocolatier. And it's definitely not a recipe to make if you're in a hurry. However, overall they're a hit with me and mine.

I made this according to the recipe and it came out wonderful! It was probably the best brownie I’ve ever made from scratch. It was delicious! It was supposed to be for my Bible study and I will have to make another one since the grandkids and I ate most of it. Thank you for this recipe!!

So good! It was national mint chocolate day, and this jumped out at me. 
If your mint frosting seems too thick to spread, try adding ~tsp. (Milk capful) of milk to smooth it out. I also used peppermint oil instead of the creme de menthe even though I had mint extract. I suggest 3-4 depending on your mint strength tolerance. Yes, it only needs drops, trust me. Taste the frosting to see if it's good for you after you mix it together. Oh, and a drop of green food coloring is perfect since the oil is clear.

I used my usual brownie recipe and followed the directions for the topping. These taste amazing! My only complaint is the mint layer is thick, which to me isn’t a bad thing but my family says it’s a bit much.

De-lish!  Best if kept chilled... the mint layer seemed to get softer than brownie and chocolate top layer. Sooooo good!

Made these for a little Thanksgiving  treat and they were a huge hit.  I made the mistake of using an 8 x 8 baking dish instead of 9 x 13 as called for in the recipe so it took a little longer to bake, but the recipe was so tasty I’ll definitely make these again!  Also, recommend cutting them into small squares, as they are a bit sweet.

I also used the packaged brownies mix with ready made chocolate fudge frosting.  I used mint extract and green food coloring instead of creme de menthe.

Family favorite! You can substitute a few drops of green food coloring and 2 t of mint extract for the creme de menthe if you don't have it on hand.  I put the brownie layer in the freezer for a 1/2 hour or so before frosting them with the mint layer . Then I freeze them again before I put on the ganache layer to make that step a bit easier.

This was a great recipe! I did not use the brownie recipe listed, because of some of the reviews. I also substituted 1 1/2 teaspoons of mint extract in place of the creme de menthe, and 1 drop of green food coloring. Will definitely be making this recipe again!

The only change I made was a substitute of 1 tsp mint extract and 2 Tbs 2 tsp of half and half instead of the creme de menth.  Be aware the brownies are more of a cake-like brownie.

Disappointed, could hardly taste the mint & I added more creme de menthe even. I'll try again with even more & if no improvement I'll look for something else. This was easy & I gave to neighbors on both sides of us, but that was before I tasted them.

these were amazing! everyone at the party i took them too LOVED them, i left out the green food coloring because i had none and it looked fine. I wonder if you could substitute cream cheese for the butter in the mint creme to cut down on the fat a bit?

I read the reviews and then made the recipe as presented. They were good, but I agree that the base wasn't just right. Next time I'll follow the recommendations and use a purchased brownie mix for the base. I took them to a potluck and they flew out of the pan!

Although not the thick chunky brownies I had expected, these brownies tasted great - the next day.  Don't bother rating this recipe until day 2 because you'll wish you'd rated them higher!  Because I am a huge fan of mint, I added a 1/2 tsp of mint extract to the batter as well, and lowered the sugar because of the high sugar-content of the syrup.  Still fantastic!

I made this using a boxed brownie mix, as was suggested by other reviewers. For the mint flavoring, I used a bit of mint extract instead of the liqueur. It came out great and was even better the day after. For the future, I'll remember to use green food coloring to get that minty look, if I use the extract again.

These are the best ever. When I'm in a real hurry and want something really over the top but don't have time, I whip up a box brownie mix and simply put the mint and chocolate layers on top. You can't miss with this one!

After reading the reviews, I started out making these brownies but substituted the actual brownie part with "the best brownies" from a hershey's cookbook I have. I followed the rest of the recipe, except I substituted the 2 tablespoons creme de menthe liqueur with 2.5 teaspoons peppermint extract. These turned out wonderfully! Now whenever there's a get-together I'm asked to bring these, even if there won't be any other food!

I made this recipe with a boxed brownie mix, and substituted 2 1/2 teaspoons of peppermint extract in place of the liquor. They turned out very good, but they are extremely rich! I ended up giving half the pan to my mother-in-law and she LOVED them; she asks me to make them nearly every time she comes over.

I used to make these brownies when I was a kid, then I lost my recipe and suffered through the holidays without them for over 15 years.  I was so excited to find this recipe on the website so I could make them again!  They turn out so pretty that no one ever believed I made them myself.  I like to add a little green food coloring to butter frosting sometimes.  I usually cheat and just use a boxed brownie mix instead making them from scratch.  Sometimes, when I'm feeling very decadent, I double the mint icing and save back a heaping cup so all the kids get a spoonfull to lick.

Brownie layer was not completely cooked through with the given cooking time.  Tinted mint layer green, everyone at my St. Patrick's day party thought they were nanaimo bars.  Good flavour, used 1 tsp mint extract, and top chocolate layer was easy to cut through straight out of the fridge.  Some other recipes I've tried, the chocolate shatters.

This recipe was a big hit with my family and friends.  I also substituted peppermint extract, and used green food coloring to liven up the color.  So many people have asked for the recipe.  Plan ahead; the time it takes is worth the wait!
