I love this recipe!  What a great switch from the old boring way of making salmon patties!  Here's where I am confused...  it seems so many allrecipes fans don't actually "rate" the recipe as submitted but instead, totally rewrite the whole recipe to suit themselves and then give themseles four or five stars.  Is this how it's done?  I thought we were to rate a recipe based on the ingredients listed and not a "new" recipe that's been tweaked to death until it's nothing like the original recipe!

These were delicious and fun to make. I used this as a base and tweaked the recipe heavily to my liking. I baked some fresh salmon and shredded it instead of using the canned salmon. Mixed in 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs, eggs and 2 sliced green onions instead of regular onion. Added 1 tbsp each of dijon and lemon juice and a few dashes of hot pepper sauce and salted to taste. Also added about 1/2 cup of shredded hash browns. No celery seed or dill. Formed patties with wet hands and dipped in more panko before frying in olive oil. Served with a lemon caper sauce from another cooking website (1 cup mayo, 1/4 cup each chopped chives and Italian parsley, 2 tbsp each minced shallot and lemon juice, 1 tbsp olive oil, 1/2 tsp hot pepper sauce and 2 tbsp minced capers). It definitely needs a sauce with it. Next time I will try a dill sauce. They were not dry at all-I had to turn them gingerly in the pan because they were so moist. An interesting way to cook salmon. I uploaded my photo of the recipe. Yummy!Thank you!

These were great and we liked them better than the recipe I've been using for several years.  I doubled the recipe and per other reviewers' recommendations, I sprinkled in some shredded cheddar cheese.  Because it was a little dry, I added some milk.  Because we try to avoid fried foods, I used a 1/4 cup and scooped them into muffin tins that had been shot with a quick spray of oil.  I baked them at 350ยบ for about 40 mins.  I served them with lemon sauce from this site.  Fantastic recipe, Joy!

Great patties! The only change I made was baking them on a baking sheet (10 minutes for each side) instead of frying them. I had never used celery salt for anything else than tomato juice and cubed appetizer cheese: huge mistake! It really adds an interesting flavor to the mix.

These were delicious!  I used real mashed potatoes (with no butter or milk)instead of the flakes.  They were not a bit dry.  Will definitely make time and time again.

Very good recipe!  I actually doubled the recipe, took out all the bones & skin after draining the cans of salmon.  I used fresh dill, ritz cracker crumbs, a little old bay seasoning, green onions (only 3 chopped up finely) and I didn't have any potato flakes, so I threw in a couple of handfulls of frozen hash browns, and made large patties (hamburger sized).  I fried them in canola oil in my electric skillet until they were good & brown & crispy.  They were just delicious!  These are great on a hamburger bun with mayo, tomato & lettuce, and I even ate a few of the leftovers for lunch today just with some cucumber ranch dressing and no hamburger bun!  Just as good leftover, but not as crispy after warming in the microwave, but just as tastey!
Thanks for a great recipe!

My family and I LOVED these patties!  I made a few adjustments according to other reviews - fresh celery, an 1/8 c. sharp cheddar, plain bread crumbs with Mrs. Dash and a splash of lemon juice -  wow, they tasted sooo yummy.  Not fishy at all and flaked while it melted in our mouths.  There's nothing overpowering about this recipe, all ingredients blend very nicely together.  Thanks, it's a keeper!!!

Substituted poached fresh salmon (in wine and water) and frozen shredded potatoes (defrosted).  Added a tsp. of Dijon mustard.  Sauteed minced garlic and onion in butter to mellow flavor before adding to salmon mixture.  Browned patties in frying pan and finished cooking on baking sheet in oven because cakes puff up nicely and cook all the way through if baked.  Served with Dill Dip II from this site.

We just loved this recipe!!!   I made just a few adjustments and they came out perfect. I used fresh salmon (about 1 1/2 lbs.) I also added a little more breadcrumbs for better hold when frying. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. The potato flakes are a great addition to regular salmon patties.  They come out beautifully crisp and brown on the outside and tender on the inside.  Thanks so much for your great idea!

I don't think that people should rate a recipe if they have made a bunch of changes so I didn't change a thing and they were fantastic. These salmon patties have good flavor and there was no trouble getting them to hold together. As another reviewer said these can be served with a Lemon Sauce that is on this site. it is the "Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties" Yum. Both great recipes. Thanks.

We absolutely loved it. I will cut the recipe down a bit next time, since there are only two of us. It was a surprisingly filling and rich taste. I'll make this again! Thanks.

I don't usually go for canned salmon, but I ended up loving these. Took some of the most helpful advice (thanks.)
Added a splash of milk to the eggs, some Old Bay, a touch of cayenne, a squirt of lemon juice and a cup of extra charp cheddar cheese. I also had to use onion powder instead of fresh. These patties turned out really good; not the least bit greasy, heavy or fishy. We'll be having this easy to prepare, tasty and economical meal again. Thanks, Joy!

I used fresh salmon(poached), fresh potato(mashed) and Panco bread crumbs.  Really good and you can used canned crab in place of salmon for good crab cakes.

I stuck to the recipe as written, (I know.. shocking!!) and it was great as is.  Can tweak to your tastes also but I liked that I didnt have to think about it, I just followed what was in front of me.  And they turned out really nice.   Save your other ingredients for another dish.  I was going to make the salmon cream sauce to go with but just topped with a dab of honey mustard salad dressing instead.  Very good.  Thanks for sharing!

I love crab cakes and thought these might be similar so I gave them a try this weekend. Overall I was really happy with the recipe and plan on making them again but upping the spices. I used plain bread crumbs and tried to compensate with a teaspoon of Italian seasoning but I still think I could have added more. Many reviewers said they had problems with the cakes holding together. You definitely should put these in the fridge after shaping them, make the rest of your meal, and then fry them once they've chilled. The recipe should have included that instruction. I did not find them dry or difficult to keep together. Personally I did not taste the potato flakes at all, so if you are looking for something with a potato flavor I might suggest using some prepared mashed potatoes or adding some grated potatoes.

Great recipe.   I whipped some heavy cream with horseradish, lemon juice and salt and pepper to serve with it.  My husband thought it was a gourmet event.

This turned out just as wonderful as the reviews said!  I used tuna instead of salmon since I had it on hand, and 1 potato mashed after I did a quick cook in the microwave and peeled it.  Baked patties in a muffin pan at 350 for 35 minutes and served with a hollandaise recipe from this website.  This is one I would make for company because it was so easy and presented beautifully next to a salad.  Give it a try!

Update: I have been using this recipe for awhile now, but I add more spices (about 1/4 tsp. Old Bay & 1/4 tsp. dried parlsey), lemon juice (about 1 TBSP), and a little of the broth from the can for a little liquid (I only use one egg). Also, my mom's recipe calls for a little cornmeal and sometimes I add that, too (about 1/8 cup). My FIL loves these, but he and I are the only ones that eat them!(: Original review: I was craving salmon patties like my mom used to make for us when I was little, but whenever I have used her recipe in the past, they have fallen apart. So I thought the used of potato flakes might be a good idea---and it worked!

This was an excellent Salmon Patty recipe and I have decided to use it from now in place of my old one. I did not have the potato flakes on hand to use at the time so I made it without them and just added a bit more bread crumbs and a touch of mayo. I love them with Wasabi Mayo-soooo good!

Good recipe.  I double it all except the eggs; 3 instead of 4.  In place of that 4th egg I use a scant cup of leftover mashed potatoes.  I also add a splash of worcestershire, lemon juice, 1/2 tsp of old bay seasoning, and 3/4 cup of finely diced bell pepper or celery, whichever I have on hand.

I very successfully substitiuted 2 cans of solid white tuna in water for the salmon.  They were great!  I also left out the celery salt because I didn't have any and substituted onion powder for the onions.

Good recipe. I've been making salmon patties for about 50 years, but I had never had them with potato flakes before.
Quite tasty. I serve with a medium cheese sauce (no processed cheese food, please!), and either rice or potatoes.
My family enjoys salmon patties as much as a good steak.

These are very good indeed! I followed other people's advice, substituting real potatoes and fresh salmon. I also fried up some leeks, a bit of red onion, and garlic and added it to the mixture, along with a little bit of cheddar. Even my fussy toddler ate them!

Great flavor!!! recipe does not need any changes!!! but I made the patties smaller (pictured) and got 16 pieces.  The only changes I made to the recipe, was to cover the patties with bread crumbs before frying (for the visual effect:) and like the other reviewer, I also added a mashed potato instead of potato flakes.  The only thing I noticed was that some of the onion pieces remained crunchy because there wasn't enough frying time, so next time I might saute the onions separately before adding to the mix, although the crunchiness adds a nice texture.  These are so delicious, they don't need any sauce, I just served them with mashed potatoes.  Yummy!!

This is easy and delicious! I use panko bread crumbs in place of the regular,a big sqeeze of fresh lemon, a sprinkle of Old Bay, a couple squirts of hot sauce, garlic salt, and chop a half of onion and sautรฉ in butter or olive oil before adding to salmon, and roll the patties in Panko bread crumbs before cooking. I make curried rice and creamed peas to go with it. 1/2 cup of potatoes and 1/2 cup of bread crumbs is too much, stick 1/4 cup each.

I made this exactly according to the recipe and they were DEELISH!  My family thought so, too.  I also used the "Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties" from this site, as another reviewer suggested, and it was the perfect compliment for these salmon patties.  Will likely make these again!

My boyfriend and I loved the Salmon patties. He wants me to make them more often. I kind of changed up the recipe. I used shredded potato, fresh Salmon, green onions. I formed the patties with my hands and dipped them in the left over bread crumbs and fried it in olive oil. This is a recipe to keep!!!

These are wonderful! I had a can of salmon and was trying to find something to do with them - this fit the bill. I had no potato flakes, so I baked a potato in the microwave, peeled it, and smooshed it. It worked out well. I cooked these 3 different ways. The first few, I coated in plain bread crumbs, and pan-fried them with olive oil spray. The second batch I coated in breadcrumbs and cooked for 7 minutes on my Foreman-type grill. The last batch I left plain and cooked in oil. The ones on the indoor grill came out the best - they were extremely flavorful, none of that oily fried taste. When I make these again, I will definitely cook them on the grill. I served these with the lemon sauce for salmon patties another reviewer mentioned - Delicious!

What a Success!!! The patties were Delicious even though I did not have all of the ingredients such as the dill weed, garlic clove and potato flakes (I did add green bell peppers though). Imagine the taste after I engage the other ingredients that were recommended.  Um, Um Good!!
Thanks!!

Not a fan ... was hoping for so much more, but nothing to write home about as far as I'm concerned.  Followed the recipe to a tee with the exception of using  real mashed potatoes rather than the flakes. Yes, they did fry up nicely, however something is missing ... flavor.  Sorry JoyLee, won't be making these patties again.

This was so easy!! And so good, my bf hates fish and he couldn't get enough!! I have made salmon patties before, but I really like this recipe out of all of them. Instead of using olive oil I used vegetable oil which made a lighter pattie. I substituted bread crumbs for gluten free bread crumbs and it tasted just wonderful. And if you use fresh farm eggs it really makes a big difference

I was looking for some fun way to use up leftover Easter mashed potatoes and posted my query on the RE, Weeble suggested this recipe and fortunately I had everything on hand. I didn't  use the instant potato flakes or the dry bread crumbs, but instead, mixed the salmon, egg, spices with the mashed potatoes I had on hand and then rolled in Panko. Pan fried in a little oil and served them alongside a very mild but flavorful salsa verde. I'll definitely make these again.

Just a quick note to let others know that if you don't care for salmon or the bones in it (I hate digging out bones) you can use tuna and get the same great flavor, this is the same recipe that I've used for yrs that has been passed down to me from my mother and grandmother.

My DH flipped out with these.  They were fantastic.  I added a bit more dill weed to the mix and some lemon juice (it was a little dry to work with making the patties).  But the taste was out of this world.  I'll definitely make this one again!

I made these Thursday night & they were awesome.  I didn't put in dill since I didn't have any.
And thanks to the poster who suggested baking them in muffin cups rather than frying- they were WONDERFUL. I had canned salmon from costco that I used and they turned out fine.  Will definately make again.

These turned out perfect!  I did make a few slight changes - I left out the onion because I don't like it and substituted onion powder, added a little hot sauce and some cheese based on other reviews.  They fried up perfectly crisp and were delicious!  I'll be making these again soon, thanks for the great recipe!

These were delicious and disappeared quickly even when I doubled the recipe.  I put them in the refrigerator for a few hours so they were more firm for cooking.

Excellent, moist, delicious salmon patty!  I followed the recipe as written with two exceptions.  I didn't have any potato flakes or celery salt so I used ground celery seeds and sour cream and chive potato flakes.  So good and so yummy!  Way better than my Mom's recipe.  Will be saving this to my recipe box to use again and again!

GLUTEN FREE Version... I substituted Corn Flake crumbs and season them instead of bread crumbs.  Also used the green onions like others mentioned.  Added a smidgeon of lemon juice and had fresh dill on hand. Did double the recipe. Family really loved them.  A keeper.

I used Progresso Italian breadcrums,  a little extra dill weed, and these were excellent!  I mixed everything together but added the salmon last and lightly mixed together before forming into patties.  I served with a little mayo mixed with lemon juice on the side for dipping.  Use good quality canned salmon for this for the best results!

These were good, but needed a few extra things...  I made the mixture as described first, then noted it was dry like other reviewers.  I added one more egg, 1t more minced garlic, and 1/4t more dill.  I think it is plenty salty as is, but it does need more zip like a dash of cayenne or Old Bay seasoning.  Will make again.

I used leftover broiled wild-caught sockeye salmon that neither my husband or son ate because of some bones. I'm not a big fan of processed/boxed potatoes, so I also used half of a med. sized potato and grated it. After reading some of the reviews, I also sauteed the potatoes first and tossed in the onions and garlic & followed the rest of the recipe. For the sauce, I mixed 1/2 of lime juice, 1 tbsp of mayo, 1 tbsp honey dijon mustard and about 1/2 tspn of crushed capers. The result was 5 perfectly seasoned patties! I will be making this again, since I have more "bony" sockeye salmon in the freezer. Thanks for the recipe! ! !

These were good but a little bland. I would suggest adding some more flavorful ingredients to perk up the taste. I used a tablespoon of Dijon, half of a red bell pepper, very finely diced, a big splash or two of hot sauce and a teaspoon of Lemon Pepper seasoning. I cooked a double batch and formed the patties small to bring to a pot luck as an appetizer course... I served them with a Remoulade Sauce recipe from this web site; they were well liked by all and quickly devoured. It's always good to take home an empty platter!

Incredible!  I didn't have any potato flakes, so I used 1/2 cup of just plain ole' boiled, then mashed potatoes.  My son says after years of trying different recipes, "mom, you nailed it!"  I also used Panko bread crumbs (1/2 cup) to make it go a little further, I have two hungry teenagers and my husband is a big eater as well.  Great recipe, thank you so much for sharing.  Oh, and I made a curry, onion, garlic, mustard, mayo, lemon juice sauce to go with, everyone loved it!

These turned out on the dry side; I had to make a dill sauce to add some moisture.  I'll stick to my regular recipe with crushed crackers next time.. Thanks though; Here's the dill sauce recipe if you're interested:   1/4 cup mayonnaise 1/2 cup sour cream 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill

Almost made this as written.  I used salmon my husband caught.  Baked it first with lemon pepper.  I served this with mayo/pepperocini sauce.  I made this into six patties.  Will make again. Thanks.

This was not a great recipe, I had decided to try salmon to find out what all the rage was. Made the mistake of using this recipe, the flavor was all wrong. I followed the recipe down to the last detail, but still no go. Thanks anyway though

These were wonderful!  Crispy and flavourful and perfect with rice.  I didn't have any celery salt on hand, so I left that out, and I added red pepper flakes, dried parsley, green onion, Italian seasoning, cayenne pepper and just a little more of the mashed potato flakes.  I also made a simple mayo-based sauce of cayenne pepper, dried parsley, dill weed, and salt and pepper.

My husband & I didn't really care for this.  I had 2 cans of boneless, skinless salmon I had to use up & this sounded good.  I also baked them & maybe that didn't help.

I have to give this 5 stars.  My husband hates "fishy" tasting food.  I made this for dinner last night and he enjoyed it.  He said he would eat it again.  I change the recipe a little by leaving out the onion and using onion salt.  Plus I used italian seasones bread crumbs which really hid the flavor of the salmon.  It was a realy big hit and the left overs today were great for lunch.  I will be using this recipe again!!! It was great for a change and healthly to have some fish in our diet!!!!

Gosh, I WANTED to like this dish as I simply love fresh salmon.  I made it from home canned salmon caught on the northern California coast sent to me by a relative & it tasted wonderful just from the jar.  It was just too dry and needed "something" so my quest for a great salmon pattie continues . . .

I needed dinner.  I thought I had a can of salmon somewhere.. but I didn't.  So, I used tuna. used Ritz instead of bread crumbs and added italian seasoning and a bit of cheddar.  I used leftover smashed potatoes... and cut it all in half.  To accompany it, I served 2 TB sourcream with 1/4t dill and a dash of Worchestire. Yummy.

These were okay.   Way too many onions though.  Next time, I'll cut way back, or maybe add a green onion instead.   I'll maybe add some red pepper flakes or something to give it some zip next time.  I only used half the olive oil as well and found that sufficient.

they were real good, but i wont be adding as much onion next time(and i used a small one!), will prob add one more egg and start with more oil to fry them.  they didnt brown evenly with so little oil.  instead of dried dill i used fresh and i used fresh celery, and instead of plain potato flakes i used the garlic flavored kind.  my favorite way to eat salmon patties is on a biscut with lots of mustard, mmmmm.

As salmon patties go, this is the best recipe I've found.  I, too, substituted the bread crumbs for seasoned stuffing mix.  These NEED either a dipping sauce or I like the lemon flavored white sauce idea.  Use Red salmon for more salmon flavor.  I will make again.

Loved it! Used fresh copper river, one real baked potato, homemade bread crumbs,Parmesan cheese. Made a sauce of organic mayo, french yummy mustard, and 2T of fresh lemon juice. I made a bunch of little ones and served them on small pretzel rolls.

I didn't follow this recipe exactly, but it was a great guideline for quick and easy salmon cakes.  I modified it by adding mashed potatoes (I boiled 2 and mashed with butter), and used chives instead of onion.  I made patties and rolled them in italian bread crumbs, then baked them at 350 for 40 minutes, flipping at half time.   We enjoyed these very much.

I'm just a beginning cook, but these turned out better than my mom's salmon cakes. The only thing I changed, was I used real potatoes instead of flakes. I will be having Salmon cakes more often now.

If you like crispy patties, these fit the bill.  I thought they were a little bland though so that's why I only gave them four stars.

I've made these several times and everytime they've been a hit.  I didn't have potato flakes on hand this time so I just omitted them but everything else was the same and they still turned out great.  My kids even like them.  I didn't have tarter or horseradish so I whipped up some mayo, lemon juice, seafood seasoning (or Old Bay) and worchestershire and it's a nice sauce.

I have tried to make other salmon potato patties/cakes from other recipes in the past.  The recipe I used to make used real sliced potatoes.  It was time consuming, very messy/difficult to make, and the patties never stuck together properly.    I tried this recipe when I was short of time one day.  I LOVE it!   Super easy to make and clean up after, the patties hold together very well, and they are just as tasty as the others I made!

I love salmon patties but I decided to try the recipe a little different and it was delicious! Instead of the dill weed and celery salt, I added some old bay seasoning and some chopped fresh chives. I also added a small amount of lemon juice and cheddar cheese. These were excellent :))

very good salmon patties. I used fresh salmon that I poached in white wine and water until opaque. I then flaked it and let it cool. I also opted to use 2 medium russet potatoes, boiled, mashed. I added a 1/4 cup italian seasoning bread crumbs, beat one whole egg and one egg white, green onion, minced, 1 garlic clove, fresh dill, celery salt, salt and black pepper to taste. I formed into patties and fried in 2 T olive oil. I watied 5 minutes until it was nice and golden brown before flipping to the other side. Outside as nice and crispy while inside was a little soft but the taste was well balanced. I also served this with, "Dill Dip III," from this website. I think next time I would like to try baking them instead of frying, just a personal preference. A nice change and very satisfying meal in itself.

I was in a hurry and had no meat thawed but had two cans of salmon that had just been hanging out in my cupboard for a while. I also had a can of crabmeat and figured what the heck. The only other change I made was the dill weed. I didn't have any so I used celery seed instead and these were amazing. 
My family isn't much into fish and they were all skeptical and sure they'd hate them. Well...I had to make sure I saved the recipe as they were all oooh's and aaahhh's when it came time for the taste test. Thanks so much. These were definitely not my mom's salmon patties. I used to dread those dinners at home lol.

Very good recipe to ad lib with.  I thought it was a bit dry, so I added a little lemon juice, horseradish, and ketchup.  I used a 1/4 measuring cup to scoop them up with and they turned out gorgeous!

These are very good and I didn't have all the items on the list.
For the potato flakes all I had was Idahoan Four Cheese.  I did not have the dill weed either, so added about 3/4 teas of parsley flakes instead.  
Also, I always add all the salmon broth in the can, I think it gives it much more flavor.   Very good, can't wait to try with all the correct ingredients.
Thank you for listing!

This was OK when made as directed. It was just a little on the bland side, though, so I might try to spice things up a little more if I make it again. I did use the Ladolemono sauce found elsewhere on allrecipes, and that made a good deal of difference. Without it, however, I don't think I would have liked these patties as much.

Wonderful!  So fast, easy, and inexpensive!  My 3 y/o son and husband loved it!  I used one pouch of salmon and kept all the other ingredients the same except subbed onion powder for the real thing due to time constraints.  Wow, my first time making any kind of fish cakes, crab, salmon, etc.  Delicious! - (UPDATE 1/9/2012)  I double the recipe using 2 pouches of salmon except still only use 2 eggs.  They come out perfectly making between 7-8 cakes.  I fry in 2 tablespoons of coconut oil for 4-5 min each side.  My family loves these.  I use Panko for the breadcrumbs and add Ms. Dash onion blend for seasoning in addition to items listed in recipe.

These seemed dry to me.  Next time, I will decrease the bread crumbs and potato flakes significantly, maybe by half each.  They did pass the picky 7 yr. old test, though, which really surprised me.

I just want to say that you can add a can of salmon to left over mashed potatoes, add a tsp of dill and thyme salt and pepper and some chopped celery and onion. Form them into patties and dredge in flour then fry them . Then you add your tarter sauce to them with some fries and you're good to go.

I made this using left over mashed potatoes.  It was delicious.  I used two cans of salmon, red pepper, shallots, Italian seasoning and Italian breadcrumbs. Sauteed shallots, red pepper in olive oil and the juice from the salmon.  Added the salmon and broke it up.  Spiced with Italian seasonings.  When shallots were softened added to 2 cups of mashed potatoes and mixed.  Added Italian breadcrumbs until a bit dryer and two beaten eggs.  Mixed well and covered.  Put in  fridge for 30 mins.  Made patties then and rolled in breadcrumbs.  Cook in olive oil in frying pan until golden on both sides.  Delicious.  Actually froze 4 of the salmon cakes for another meal.

Very good, a tad dry, but I don't have too much of a problem with that. I used Panko bread crumbs because that's all I had. Also did not have any celery salt, but it still tasted good. Thanks!

I only gave these 3 stars because they were a bit salty. Too salty to eat, actually. But the general flavor and texture was good. I halved the recipe and still came out with 8 patties.

These salmon patties are great!  This is a great base recipe.  And I say "base" only because I did add more ingredients to give it some more flavor, as I have saw many others do as well in their reviews.  I pretty much made the recipe the way its written except I subbed green onion for the onion and garlic powder for the fresh.  I added in some extra ingredients including a small squirt of srirachi for some heat, a little dijon mustard, mayo, horseradish sauce, old bay, and some parmesan cheese.  I also love dill, so I added in a little more than the recipe says.  These were very flavorful and great!  I do think the recipe as written would be great, but I thought what the heck I love adding in more flavor, so lets go for it!  These were the best salmon patties that Ive had and I ate mine with some tartar sauce on top.  Any type of sauce would go well with these such as a roumalade, dill sauce, horseradish, etc.  Very good!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the tastiest salmon patty recipe I have ever eaten!  We also had friends over, they all love them, even my 2 yr old.  The only thing I tweaked was adding fresh lemon juice to them, and I sauteed them in lemon olive oil.  A family favorite, for sure.

These were good and my hubby liked them more than I did.Flavor was really good but  I found them a tad dry. I used a packet of salmon instead of canned which may account for them being dry.  Will try with canned and see how they are then.

UPDATE:  These make AWESOME salmon rolls for lunch.  Instead of creating patties I just cook the entire batch in the pan like hamburger meat.  I placed it on flat out bread with some cheese, spinach leaves, and horseradish sauce... rolled it up and it was soooo good.  I ate it everyday for lunch, and its healthy.

These have quickly become a favorite of ours.  We don't always have dill, so sometimes I substitute finely diced garlic, black pepper or lemon zest.  Yummy every time!  Leftovers (if you're lucky enough to have any!) reheat nicely.

This is a great versatile recipe! The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and they were fantastic! They held together well and fried up nice. Since then I have subbed tuna and/or added different herbs, grated cheese, crushed potato chips instead of bread crumbs....the possibilities are endless. Just stick to the fish:eggs:dry ingredients ratio and tweak to your hearts content! Econimical and yummy!!!

This was wonderful. I used left over salmon from the "Grilled Salmon" from this site and "lemon sauce" from this site as well.  I added "dashes" of garic salt, onion powder, lemon juice, hot pepper sauce and some cheddar cheese.  I too  baked them in a muffin pan at 350 for 40 min.

GREAT!  Loved the potato flavor in it.  I didn't have flakes, but I minced (with food processor) about 1/2 cup of canned potatoes.  Children loved it too (even my picky one).

Found this recipe, several weeks ago, when I was looking for a way to use left over fresh salmon. I'm sure the recipe would be great as written but I did make a few personal changes. I used panko crumbs, fresh herbs and garlic, celery seed, and carmalized the onions. I also coated the patties in panko crumbs prior to cooking. They were crispy on the outside but moist and flavorful inside. I served them with a tomato caper salsa, couscous and fresh beet salad. I will be making again next week, for a family gathering, and I will serve sandwich style on buns with a fresh dill sauce from this site. Very versatile recipe.

We love the fresh salmon burgers at our local grocery store but they can become very pricey. These were a great alternative. I used 2 6oz cans of pink skinless, boneless salmon and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Thank you.

I didn't do anything differently than the recipes asked me to do. I wish there was some sort of sauce I could have put on them. (like the photo shows) But the question is what kind? Tarter sauce, cajun mayo? not quite sure. I over browned my first batch, all my fault completely, and the can of salmon had bones in it, so be careful, to pull them out. I will make this again. And it's light and quick.

I prefer fresh salmon, so i baked mine(laid out foil, sprinkled with olive oil, placed th salmon in the center, added salt, pepper, granulated garlic and a dash of white wine. Wrapped tightly and baked for 45 minutes). Added a little bit more garlic and homemade old bay seasoning. Thank you!

My husband and I really like these.  The only changes that I made was to use mayonaise in place of one egg and also added some tobasco sauce and shredded cheese.  I served these with sour cream that I spiced up with dill, cayenne pepper, celery salt, black pepper and a bit of vinegar.  Also, PLEASE DO NOT used the canned salmon with the skin and bones! Just use two 7 oz bags of boneless, skinless salmon.  They are right next to the canned salmon in the grocery store.

First of all, I would like to thank the reviewer who told how to cook these patties in the oven in a muffin tin. i doubled the recipe and got 16 muffin-size patties. I also made the following changes and additions to the recipe (based on previous reviews): added 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, used 1/4 tsp. celery seed in place of the celery salt, used 1 tsp. dried minced onions, added about 1 cup of Sharp shredded Cheddar cheese, and because the mixture seemed a little thin I added a little skim milk at the end. For the unspecified amounts of salt I pepper I used 1/2 tsp. salt & 1/4 tsp. pepper. I didn't tell my family they had salmon in them at first so they would actually eat them and there were no complaints. Definitely serve with some kind of sauce though. Options for sauces: cocktail sauce, tartar sauce, ketchup, prepared horseradish. Anyway, I'll be making these easy little patties again soon.

This was pretty good and easy.  Kids wouldn't eat it - but they never eat fish.  I felt like something was missing and maybe will play with it a bit.  Hubby suggested cayenne pepper which sounds like a good way to add a kick.  I need to find a better canned salmon.  The one I got had bones and skin and I hate picking through it.  I had some fresh canned salmon from Alaska once that was all meat and soooo good.  Anybody know what brand/type salmon to buy to get it boneless? Overall this is very good recipe and a great way to get more salmon in the diet.

My husband asked me to make salmon patties the way his mom makes them..which is 1 can salmon, 1 egg, 1 sleeve of saltine crackers..which I think is very dry,and the crackers is all you taste. So I looked on here for other variations. I found this recipe,and although I didn't have the celery salt, or dill weed..I decided to make it anyway. I used a 16 ounce smoked precooked salmon filet we got for christmas, italian bread crumbs instead of the herb(all I had)and before I fried them, I dipped them in egg and gave them a light coating of bread crumbs. I brought a couple to my neighbor to try(because I do not like salmon),and she loved them. And my husband loved them,  he thought they were awesome,and prefers them now over his mom's dry nasty ones..haha..(but don't tell her that.)

i have been looking for a way to use up the canned salmon in my pantry, and this was the perfect solution!  very flavorful and moist!  i coated each patty in extra bread crumbs, used whatever spices i had and baked them at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes.  an easy meal that looks fancy!

These were easy & delicious.  I had added a tiny bit of smoked salmon I had left, with the can of red sockeye. I served them with a choice of my home-made Tartar sauce, or a Wasabi Mayo with fresh lemon.Here again, I converted my "shellfish only" friend to liking this a lot. Previously, I turned her on to the greatest Parmesan Tilapia. Will make this often.

We budgeted and used 3 cheap 79cent cans of tuna instead, and added an extra egg. They still came out absolutely fabulous and tasty, with no oily aftertaste. We served it with a side of lightly-spiced cellentani-shape pasta. It was absolutely awesome, and me and my mom have enough for leftovers. Thanks for this great recipe!

These were tender and juicy, light and flavorful.  Just watch your salt.  I put in maybe 1 tsp, and they were too salty.  1/2 tsp of salt should do it.

I really didn't like these.  I have never had canned salmon before and was expecting it to taste more like fresh salmon. I'm giving it a three star because my kids ate them.  I did, however, try the cilantro lime tartar sauce from this site and that was very good.  Sorry.

These are very tasty. Even my toddlers enjoy making & eating them.  I do sometimes have trouble w/ them falling apart on me.  So to improvise I sometimes use the crumbled parts to top steamed baby spinach and add fresh ground black pepper and a splash or two of balsamic vinegar.

I will have to agree with some of the other people, they were really dry. Maybe because I used an indoor grill. The flavor was a bit bland too, even with the onion and garlic. 
Don't know if i would make this again.

Perfect basic recipe.  The 2 eggs are essential, I think, which is different from other patty recipes.  I used med/large eggs.  Very moist and kid/husband friendly.  My husband walked in while I was flaking the salmon and pronounced, "I'm having no part of that".  He not only had a part of it, but didn't touch the back up dish I'd prepared.  A very good recipe and something to expound on if your husband or kids will let you.

I served this as an appetizer at a St. Patrick's Day themed dinner, and it was a big hit.  I added some cheddar cheese to the mixture as another reviewer suggested, and served a dill dip alongside the patties.  Very easy to prepare and cook, neither too fishy nor too much filler, and they were enjoyed by everyone.

I rate this 5 stars but I won't be making them again. I took my first bite and said "ummmm honey, what do you think"? After 21 years of marriage and a kazillion meals later my husband says he really doesn't care much for salmon. Who woulda thought? My mom and several friends declared they are absolutely five star and will gladly take them off my hands any time I see fit to make them again. Should I make them again for myself (and mom/friends) I think I would add just a little minced bell pepper.

This was a quick and easy recipe that my family enjoyed. We love grilled salmon and I used the leftovers I had frozen to make these patties. I added an extra egg, as the mixture didn't seem to be holding together, and added a bit of shredded cheese. I also made it even easier by using onion powder (my kids don't like onion "chunks") and garlic powder. Just don't overcook! I did, and mine were a bit dry, but still good. Served them with the lemon sauce recipe from Allrecipes, but the kids liked them dipped in ranch dressing. Will make this again.

I enjoyed your recipe very much. I used some seasoned stuffing for the bread crumbs. I didn't have the dill, and only had celery seed instead of celery salt. I will try it with the dill and celery salt next time. They tasted great! thanks for posting it.

Excellent option for salmon patties.  Since my husband can't eat wheat, the seasoned bread crumbs were NOT added.  The instant potatoes worked just fine as a binder.  The cakes held together and crisped up nicely and were wonderful with the lemon sauce from this site.  It's a great gluten free solution.

Made these today, fantastic.  I started out with the best intentions, but ended up with the kitchen sink in there too.  That's the great thing about salmon patties.  Most of my ingredients were the same, but I added a handful of shredded mozzarella, some cayenne pepper, mashed potato and some sesame oil.  5 stars is for the original recipe base, without which I wouldn't have come up with something so tasty!  A trick if your patties are too wet, put olive oil on your hands and form the patties--(think rice krispies squares)--no fuss!

The only change I made was to use panko instead of breadcrumbs, added some dijon and extra seasoning for the lack of seasoned breadcrumbs. I still found these to be a little bland. I did like the texture, and will try this again as a base, but with more seasoning. Could be that the herb breadcrumbs add so much extra flavor?

Very tasty.  I had to add about 1 T of milk to help the mixture stay together.  I was only able to get 4 nice size patties using 1 can of salmon.

These turned out really well!  On the suggestion of another reviewer, I baked these in a muffin pan on 350 for 40-ish minutes, and they were fantastic.  I also used left over mashed potatoes instead of flakes, and fresh dill since I had some on hand. Thanks for the recipe!

Tried these first time as stated and found them a bit bland. Second time I added lemon juice, a few dashes of cayenne pepper, some horseradish and a sprinkle of basil. Had better flavor. I liked the idea of another reviewer who used a 1/4 measuring cup to form, makes the perfect size. Good base recipe, thanks!

So good! We have a stocked catfish pond and 3 teenage boys who won't eat catfish.  I've needed to find a way to use the catfish that the boys would not just eat, but actually enjoy.  This did the trick.  One 25" catfish, flaked, with a doubled recipe of the other ingredients made up into patties the whole family loved.  Thanks!!

Yummy!  I baked at 375 for 30 minutes for a low fat meal.  I did need some lemon juice for flavor after it cooked.  I might use it in the mix next time.

Sorry, 4 stars due to canned Salmon in recipe. I use the 7.1 oz vacuum sealed pouch (like tuna comes in) It was Pillar brand sockeye salmon. Anyway, I wanted to use up some leftovers so used 1/3 C mashed potatoes vs instant. Used dried onion flakes & 1/4C Panko bread crumbs and only 1 egg.. Added 1 tsp dijon mustard and fresh grated lemon peel & approx 1/4C of parmesan along with the dill/celery seed and garlic. I liked this recipe for the "idea" to tone down fish taste. Mixed then refrigerated overnight. I dusted patties with a little flour b4 frying in pre-heated veg oil. Turned out very good. I can't stand canned salmon (PU) so using the pouch style worked better for myself.

I liked them! I did make some changes though: I added some lemon juice, fresh basil, and I used boxed hash browns instead of potato flakes. I also baked them instead of fried. Will make again!

My husband has been wanting salmon patties for years and im not a seafood eater so I have never made them. I found this recipe for Potato Salmon Patties and they seemed easy so I decided to give them a try. They we great and this is coming from some one that doesnt eat sea food. Thanks for the recipe!!

This was a great recipe, it was better than the traditional fall apart salmon patties.  I doubled the recipe and added 4 tbs of the salmon juice for moisture.

I didn't change a thing (imagine that!) These were SO good! Even the kids had seconds! They were quick and delicious..much cheaper, too, than buying lump crab meat. Per my three children, ages 7, 11, and 13, and hubs, these will be made monthly at least!  Thank you!!

These patties are wonderful! The recipe is great just the way it is. I just took it upon myself and added ingredients other viewers said which were about 3 tbsp of lemon juice, 1/2 cup shredded chedder cheese, and some 4 tbsp of honey dijon mustard. I used the ingredients b/c I had them in the frig. But the recipe is perfect the way it is without the additions! That's why I gave it 5 stars! Great job chef! Will use again and again! I saved this one to my recipe box! :)

When I can make something that my teenagers will eat, my husband will eat and my twin one year olds will eat I am in heaven!  Whipped these up (doubled the recipe) and served with some basmati rice and veggies and ding, ding, ding, we have a winner.  Replaced my curried salmon cake recipe with this since not everyone in my house is a curry lover and I will definately make these again!

Like many of the reviews I agree this was a great base recipe.  I only had one 6oz pack of salmon but got 4 filling patties.  I just threw in what I had: green onions, yellow onions, garlic, plain breadcrumbs, a couple ritz crackers crumbled, potato flakes, eggs, Italian herb seasoning, adobo, sprinkle of dill, squeeze of lime.  I also threw in diced mushrooms from my sauteed mushrooms recipe.  Came out great!  My dad never liked salmon patties but he loved these.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are great. I did change it a little. I boiled 2 large potatoes, then mashed them with a little butter, salt & pepper. Add the other ingredients, omitting the eggs, dry potato flakes, and bread crumbs. Added a little Old Bay seasoning, mixed, shaped into patties, and lightly breaded the outside with Italian seasoned bread crumbs.b Browned in frying with butter. Will be making these often. Served with tartar sauce.

Canned salmon? No way!! It is so easy to finely dice up fresh salmon. It works very well and taste so much better. One med. onion? That is waaay to much. I even thought half of an onion was to much. I think i ended up using 1/4 of it. Not sure what the potato flakes are for. A binder maybe? because you definitely cant even tatse a hint of it. None the less it was good.

The Salmon Patties turned out really good. The onions are a must. Because they fry fast, the onions are still a bit raw and give the patties a nice crunch. You can enjoy with a mixed green salad.

Not bad, the mixture was a little dry so I added an extra egg.  Probably could have added a little milk or less bread crumbs.  They were falling apart a little while frying.  The flavor was decent, but could have used a little something more.

We loved it!  I used boneless, skinless pink salmon, substituted bread crumbs for potato flakes, added 1 T of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning.  To form the patties I packed the mixture into a measuring cup(1/4 C), knocked it out into my hand and pressed it down to 1/2 and inch.(1 pattie=3 WW points) I refrigerated the patties to chill them as one reviewer suggested. Here's a fat free sauce for the patties:  2 T non-fat plain yogurt, 1/2 T lemon juice, 1 tsp horseradish and 1 T chili sauce...I thought I got the sauce recipe from this site, but can't find it. Thank you JoyLee for this recipe.

Really good!  The potato makes all the difference.  I used a yukon gold potato.  I also used real diced celery instead of celery salt, and added some diced white onion.  It was nice and moist, not dry at all.

Yum!  This was heavily modified based on what was in my kitchen.  I put mashed sweet potato (microwaved), corn flakes, green onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and dill in the food processor, then added flaked canned salmon and 2 eggs.  Added more corn flake crumbs to get the right consistency.  These fried up really nicely in the pan with a nice crunchy crust.  Just goes to show how flexible and forgiving a recipe for fish patties can be.

My boyfriend and I are dieting.  We gave up red meat for awhile so we tried this recipe and both loved it.  We have since tried it using canned tuna and chicken and also adding some shredded cheese (on non dieting days) to the mixture to give it some extra flavor.  We have loved it every which way we have tried it.  We are also talking about adding small chopped bits of green pepper and/or crushed red pepper.  We may also be trying different kinds of fish to this mix, as we think that may taste great as well and give us a few more options on taste.  I have tried tarter sauce to go with it which was good but really love to put honey mustard dip/dressing on the side and it tastes even better.  This recipe leaves alot of options open and they have all tasted great.  It is a quick recipe to whip up and make any time.  We either serve it with salad or a side of veggies. We will be making this again and again and again...

These are my new favorite salmon pattie! I am not much of a fish eater/liker and truthfully only eat it during lent so I was shocked that I not only ate a second bite of mine, but actually finished it and had a second one. I am actually looking forward to fixing this again. I didn't have flavored bread crumbs so I smashed up some flavored salad croutons which turned out perfectly. Thanks, this recipe is going to get a lot of use now!

I made these just as the recipe specifies except that I used garlic potato flakes. Turned out quite well. I served with a home made tartar sauce. These are much better than your average salmon pattie.

This was the first time I had ever made Salmon Patties. I really enjoyed them. They were very quick and easy to make. I'm not sure I will use the canned salmon next time, but I will make them again. I do need to find a good sauce to go with it, though.

My husband must have liked these- he didn't douse them with ketchup or hot sauce.  That says alot!  I'll make these again, for sure.

Made this last night.  It was very good.  My girls love it.  Made some changes, cooked the onions first added some lemon pepper and some sour cream for moistness, used panko instead of bread crumbs.  This is a keeper.

I didn't follow this exactly, but close. I shredded two potatoes instead of using dry and used onion powder instead of onion and no celery salt.  These were very good.  This recipe is a keeper.

These were great!  I made a few substitutions due to what I had on hand. Plain bread crumbs, dried minced onion, dried parsley, dash of garlic powder, dash of Old Bay, TBS each of dill pickle juice and lemon juice. Left out celery salt & dill because I didn't have them.  This recipe made 6 patties for me and I coated them in plain bread crumbs before browning in olive oil.  I finished them off in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes.  Will definitely try them as recipe is stated when I have all the ingredients and will be making again!

My youngest loves the Salmon cakes that her grandma makes, so I thought I'd treat her to these and surprise her.  She was not impressed but I didn't think they were bad. I think it was the onion/garlic mix.  She is not used to that in the ones that grandma makes for her.

I substituted tuna and these came out awesome. My 5 and 7 year olds loved them. Next time I will try to match it with a good sauce as it would have been nice to have one! thanks for the recipe!

Easy to put together and good flavor.  I think that pan frying it lends a slight heaviness to it that I could do without (I'm not crazy about the taste of fried foods), so next time I'm going to follow the suggestion of baking them in muffin tins.  We'll see how that works.  I'll also be using a creamy horseradish-dill sauce recipe for dipping.

This is a great tasting salmon patty.  I really do not like too much dill, so I cut the amount in half.  To add extra crunch, I also coated the patties with cornmeal before cooking.  MMMMMMM!!!!!!
My family loved them.

I changed these a bit to suit what I had at hand. I used tuna instead of salmon, only had plain breadcrumbs so added some italian seasoning, used chopped fresh parsley instead of the dill and only used half of a small onion. turned out really good my husband said 5 stars after one mouthful. Thanks.

These were the best salmon patties I have ever eaten! It's tough to find a pattie recipe using canned salmon where they don't taste somewhat "fishy", but these didn't at all. I will be making these often. Thany you, Joy, for a great recipe!

These were absolutely wonderful.  I could not find garlic & herb seasoned bread crumbs at the store so I opted for Italian seasoned.  I added a little garlic salt and figured that was close enough.  Made the patties larger than recipe suggested and cooked a little longer.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have been looking for a recipe like this for awhile to use the salmon in a pouch. I just added a bit of olive oil to make sure they didn't turn out dry. And they weren't.  My husband loved these!  I did like a previous poster and put them into a muffin pan and baked them (350/40 min).  Great texture and flavor, not difficult--just great!

These were very good!  The best Salmon pattie recipe I have found. They do not fall apart like others I have tried. I used the white sauce from the  "Fish Tacos" recipe  by: Tanya. It went excellent as a dipping sauce for the patties.  Yum! Yum!  Thanks, Joy!

This is a family staple in our household.  I subsitute dried minced onion instead of fresh to save time, and use celery seed instead of salt to reduce the sodium level.  I also cook them on a non-stick skillet and don't have any problems with them sticking.  Thanks so much for a new family favorite.

I must have done something wrong because the patties I made were so dry and had that "stick to your throat" thing going on.  Besides the texture, they tasted good, maybe I drained my salmon too well or something.  I think I'm going to have to give this one another try. . .

Wonderful recipe as is but I made a couple modifications this time because I didn't have time to go to the store. It still turned out great! I used panko (Japanese bread crumbs) and scallions for the onion. I also used a small grated cooked red-skinned potato, minus the skin instead of flakes. I didn't have any dill, so I used some spicy montreal seasoning because it has dill in it. I didn't have celery salt, either but I did add some lemon pepper. So, you can play around with it a lot and still have a great outcome! The original recipe is very good as well.

I substituted dry potato flakes with frozen hash browns, then fried until crispy. Oh were these ever good!

I liked the texture of these very much-- preferred them made with potato flakes and breadcrumbs rather than just breadcrumbs.  Added some grated cheddar and a few dashes of Old Bay Seasoning, which perked up the flavor a lot.  I made them bigger than the recipe called for, though... for a meal I didn't see the point in hassling with a bunch of little patties instead of several bigger ones.  My husband really enjoyed this and we've had it several times.  Very good and very easy!

These were excellent.  They fried nicely, were moist...and tasty!  This is better than my old "stand-by" recipe for salmon patties and is definitely a keeper.  We're not huge dill fans, so I only used half the amount of dill specified; however, we may try following the recipe exactly next time.

Oh!  Our favorite "sauce" for salmon patties is Heinz 57.  It may sound odd, but it's a great taste combination -- and is even good on a salmon patty sandwich (cold or hot)!

These were OK, tastes like a very dry-bland Hush Puppy with a touch of salmon. Next time I will adding some shredded zucchini (moisture), use an onion not onion powder (moisture) and add Old Bay Seasoning (flavor). I really want to find a salmon recipe that works for me---as a rule I do not like salmon  but I understand the health benefits of eating it regularly so I will try this recipe again with modifications. Also, if you cooked these silver dollar size patties for 5 minutes on each side (as recipe calls for) they would be hockey pucks, try a minute or less!

I tried this tonite and it was delicious and very easy to make.  I served it with a little lemon-flavored white sauce on top.  I also used seasoned poultry stuffing instead of dry bread crumbs - Yum!

I shredded some potatoes in instead of the flakes (I dried them with paper towels as much as possible) and it was very tasty.  I also didn't have the breadcrumbs so I just used crushed crackers and added my own herb & garlic seasoning.  Turned out very well.

I was given 4 cans of salmon and was determined to do something with them that my family would enjoy. We don't normally eat canned fish (south Louisiana!) so I was nervous about fixing this. I followed this recipe as written, except forgot all about the onions. (Oops!) I would add a little more cayenne next time, but it was very good as is. Everyone really enjoyed it.

Loved it.  I made the assumption potato flakes are the same a instant potatoes.  My hunch is you could even use actual mashed spuds.  I cut the onions by a half.   I think fresh dill would make a great recipe even better.   Watch the cooking, 5 minutes in the recipe could burn depending on the temp.  I did a quick sear on each time and finished for 5 minutes in a hot oven.  I did a Lemon Caper sauce on top but anything creamy would be great ... maybe ranch dressing.

Anytime I have leftover mashed potatoes I make these. Adjust seasonings to family's liking and they are gobbled up every time! Definitely better than the patties I grew up on.

Yum! These were really good. I didnt have any dry potato flakes so I substituted cooked mashed (plain) potatoes, and they turned out really good. Had to use a bit more breadcrumbs too (just eyeballed it until the texture stuck together well). Yeah, will definitely make again.

Best Salmon Patties in the World!  These were so good. I kicked them up a bit with some cayenne pepper and fried them in a  cast iron skillet. I served them on homemade hamburger buns.

I've never been a fish person. But the last year or so I can't seem to get enough. This is the first recipe for salmon patties I've tried and we LOVE THEM! I didn't have the garlic & herb seasoned dry bread crumbs. So I mixed some plain bread crumbs with garlic powder & Mrs Dash Onion & Herb Seasoning. Yum yum yummy!! Thank you for the recipe! :-)

The only salmon my kids, grandkids and husband agreed on.  Made salmon patties 35 years just like my mom and grandma before her.  Found out after making these that my entire family hated the old ones and would sneak and throw them away or feed them to the stray cat outside that we adopted!!  Thank you so much for this :) !

Some long lost memory from my childhood surfaced the other day and left me hankering for these...had a can of salmon and went for it. "Just like Mom used to make" :-) Wife liked 'em so I will make them again for sure.

Didn't have all the ingredients so I subbed 1/4 cup herb dried stuffing mix and 1/4 cup quinoa flakes (in place of potato flakes)  Doubled the dill. Also added 1 tsp of no salt (Costco) All Purpose Seasoning mix.  I baked them in the oven in a individually divided brownie pan, so they came out in 2X2in squares and it made 10 of them. See photo. Put 1/8 tsp of coconut oil in each square section of the pan and preheated the pan and oil in the 350 degree oven.  Shaped the salmon mixture into golf balls size portions, rolled lightly in Panko bread crumbs, and pressed each ball of mixture lightly into each each square section of the pan. Baked in 350 degree oven for 30-35 min, till golden brown.  Would make great little sandwiches on small buns too.

Dry, but worth a try. They taste healthy and are nicely seasoned.  I followed the recipe to a T, but found the cakes were hard to move if you flatten them first.  Instead, I placed the ball on the hot pan and found it easier to flatten them with a spatula.

Not too bad! Not sure how the potato flakes affected the texture, but some of the patties would not stick together! Tasty overall still though.

Very good recipe as is.  Not dry as some state, not flavorless as others do.  Have made salmon cakes using saltines and no garlic or dill for years, plus used vegetable oil instead of olive.  I loved this recipe and will keep it.

I wasn't in the mood for a cold salad to use up leftover grilled salmon that I had. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. Delish! Would definitely make again. We loved it!

These were great! I followed the recipe almost 100%, but didn't have enough salmon leftover from a filet, so I augmented it with a can.  Man, canned salmon is a pain in the a#@.  Don't waste your time picking out all the teeny tiny bones and just make this as a left overs recycled meal.  

I used a couple of drops of milk since it was almost too dry before cooking, but it held together nicely while browning in the olive oil.

I served it with horseradish sour cream as suggested, green beans and sweet potato fries for a kid friendly quick and easy meal. Yum-mee!

this is really good, I use a small potato instead of the dry flakes and only one egg since it's wet enough, added 1/4 Tea garlic powder, onion powder, and season salt on top of everything listed here, use only 1/4 onion, blend potato, garlic, and onion all at once in the small processor, and pan fry it, the potato give it some crunch. I got lot of salmon cans from work, now I know how to get rid of them.  thank you for sharing this recipe

Great recipe!  I didn't have potato flakes so I grated half a small raw red potato and used it instead.  When cakes were almost done I sprinkled a bit of pecorino romano cheese on top!  YUM!   My husband said these cakes were tastier than the salmon meals we get out (and he's picky!)  Enjoy!

These are really good but I did make a couple of changes.  I use panko bread crumbs and omit the dill.  One tablespoon of mayonnaise also helps for flavor. You can also roll in panko crumbs before frying.  Very good!

My boyfriend enjoyed this recipe when I made it.  I didn't have garlic flavored bread crumbs so I used garlic flavored potato flakes instead.  This was the first time  I made salmon patties and they turned out great. Thanks for sharing.

Used fresh salmon and panko.  Only issue was had a hard time getting patties to stay together while frying, but that could be due to the fresh salmon.

The patties were so good.  My DH didn't want to try them but when he did I had to fight him for the last one.  Used pankon instead of bread crumbs on the outside made them crispy.

Made exactly as stated in recipe.  Pretty good.  I think if I had used fresh salmon, it would have been 5 stars for sure.  However, we had the canned salmon and needed to use them, so this was a nice way to go.

Really good, added 1 tsp lemon juice and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper to rest of ingredients. Used hash brown potato instead of potato flakes, Put Panko bread crumbs on the outside just before frying.  Made 4 patties.

Good, but I REALLY like salmon patties and found that the potato somewhat interfered with and mellowed the flavor of the salmon. I also missed the Old Bay that I usually use with such patties, as I think it would have complimented the salmon, yet subdue the potato. I used green onions and added a bit of cilantro, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe. I DO like the dill.  : )  However, in no way will this produce 5 adults dinner servings -- 3 maybe. I made 6 patties. This would be a wonderful appetizer! Thanks.

Fabulous! Wonderful as a main dish, just have to portion accordingly as each patty is pretty small. But this would also make a wonderful appetizer. They really do not need any dipping sauce, great flavor as is. But my daughter and I both agreed that a nice lemon dill sauce with capers would complement this wonderfully. I was serving to someone who cannot eat onions but can have onion powder, so I substituted 2 tsp powder for the fresh minced onion. I also added 1/4 tsp Old Bay seasoning and used aproximately 2/3 cup left over mashed potatoes in place of the instant potato flakes. I made sure to use the better type canned salmon, red sockeye vs pink, and removed the bones and skin. We really loved this! Thanks JoyLee for sharing a great recipe!

This went over very well with hubby and the kids. Like another reviewer, I cooked a small potato and mashed it instead of instant which I didn't have on hand. This one is a keeper. Thanks!

These were awesome. Glad to have a new & different way to make my salmon patties. The only change I made was to lightly dust my patties in equal parts of corn meal & flour before frying. Makes a nice crispy crust on the patties. Will make again & again.

I had full intentions of following this recipe to a "T" but alas, I had no bread crumbs! Or crackers! But I did have potato flakes and used extra in place of the bread crumbs.  Turned out phenomenal! Nice crispy crust.  I'll give it 5+ stars for that but since I didn't use bread crumbs, I gave it 4.  Great, great recipe! Will definitely use again (potato flakes and all!).

My family loves this one.  We do it every couple of weeks and follow the recipe exactly.  Great way to get the toddler to eat salmon.  I mix mayo with lemon juice, dill, and celery salt for dipping.

Why do I keep trying to find a decent salmon pattie recipe when the Zatarans mix is so much better and easier?  This recipe was dry and tastelesst.  I tried adding milk like others suggested, but still not good.  My son loves salmon patties, but couldn't finish these.

Had to make for a quick dinner. My kids LOVED them! Added just a dash of milk cuz I thought the recipe looked/felt a little dry.  I've never used celery salt before but it really DID make a difference.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks, they were delicious!

I have tried lots of salmon patty recipes. This one is a keeper even my husband liked it. I did not have the seasoned bread crumbs so I used a store brand pork breading (shake & Bake). It turned out great! Very flavorful! My five kids love them.

These are delicious and flexible--you can easily make a few changes based on what you like. I used garlic flavored potato flakes, panko bread crumbs, seasoning salt rather than salt, freshly ground pepper, lemon zest and feta cheese. I also used both regular onion and green onions.  Overall, the basic potato flakes, bread crumbs, egg, and canned salmon mixture is great and don't be afraid to play around with the other ingredients.

I used two 5oz. cans of boneless skinless salmon, 2 eggs, 1/3 cup of seasoned bread crumbs, 1/4 cup of Idahoan roasted garlic mashed potatoe flakes, minced garlic, salt, pepper, and TS spinach and herb dip mix(it has the dill in it).  I chopped the onion in the food processesor to make it very fine.  I heated my evoo on medium heat and once I put the patties in, I turned it down to medium low.  These patties were so moist and had so much flavor.  Even my picky 4 yr old liked them.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful! I only had plain bread crumbs so Old Bay seasoning was added, but everything else was according to the recipe. We'll have these again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

I used 2 green onions, sub. the canned salmon with baked fresh salmon (seasoned with salt, pepper and lemon juice), and baked them at 350 for 40 minutes in a muffin pan. They were awesome! Will be making regularly.

I used this recipe to make crab cakes instead of salmon patties.  I used a 1 lb. can of Jake's Catch gourmet crab.  I used 1/2 minced yellow onion and about 1/4 cup chopped green onions.  After I had the patties formed, I rolled each one in cornstarch before placing in the hot oil - the cornstarch gives it a nice crisp coating and helps to hold the patty together.  These crab cakes turned out great - good recipe.  Maybe next time I'll try it with salmon!

Wow! Even the crumbs are good! I made this exactly (well, except for the celery salt, I used garlic salt instead) Just a fair warning, cook it on a LOW flame or it will burn and smash it down fairly good for the middle to squish out. Really good meal with just corn for the side to me. I'll be making this sometime again.

These were delicious and very filling!  The great part is that you can easily tinker with the recipe as well to make it more your own; adding things you like and omitting those you don't.  I'll definitely be making these frequently.

Just made these for dinner tonight.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the dill weed.  We don't like it so subbed about 1/2 teaspoon lemon pepper.  Turned out great.  Served the patties with the lemon sauce for salmon recipe, it's good too. An economical, easy and nutritious meal.

Delicious! I did not have any celery salt, but I think chopped celery in it would be good. I left it out and used Italian fine bread crumbs for the breading. I squeezed lemon juice on top when it was served. I think aioli sauce would be delicious on top as well! My two year old ate 4 patties...with ketchup and ranch dressing of course.

These turned out great. Deboneing the canned salmon was the biggest pain while making this recipe. Kids and husband loved it.

These were good, but Mom, Dad and I were looking for something "better" than moms homemade ones. These were a moister patty than she makes, so it was "different", but we couldnt peg them as "better". I did make the Lemon Sauce on this site, and that was a fabulous compliment to these. I did double my dill, added some "garlic and cheese" herbs, and added some Worchestershire sauce. Will keep searching for "better" but would make these again. Thanks!

So quick, easy and yummy! I confess I did not have instant potatoes so I substituted instant hummus. (I had some on hand from camping trips) For me this recipe yielded 8 large patties. I ate 3 of them with asparagus (steamed 5 minutes then sauteed 2 minutes in evoo, lemon juice and sesame seeds) A very quick and satisfying meal!

Really good.  I love salmon patties and these are better than the ones my mom makes.  I added a couple tbsp. of mayo to the mixture.  Left out the dill and celery salt just because I didn't have any on hand.  Thanks for the recipe!

Another All Recipes recipe my family loved.  My husband really liked the way the potato flakes were used as a binding agent yet didn't take away any taste from the salmon.

Mine were a little dry, but the flavor was GREAT. I used the pouch salmon instead of canned, so it may have been drier since it wasn't packed in liquid. I will add a little liquid next time. Otherwise, they were really good. Even my picky 10 year old ate them!

Fantastic. I double it and feed it to my neighbors. They are always asking when I am gonna make it again. I also used it to make crab cakes using lumped crab. Had to modify it a bit by adding a little more bread(was to watery) and with crab I used chives instead of onion so as not to overpower.

Patties were yummy. I dont think all the olive oil should be added at once, rather a small amount before you fry each pattie. My first pattie was a little greasy, and the rest got drier as i cooked. Thankyou ^_^

I so wanted this to taste good.  I like canned salmon patties but this recipe is not good.  From the first bite all I tasted was the instant potatoes, then a fishy taste.  Seems the ingredients took the salmon flavor away and replaced it with bad fishy potatoes.

This was a wonderful recipe!  I will definitely make this again, but I think I will try baking them as one other person did as I am trying to stay away from the fried stuff.  My husband really liked them too.  I did not like them reheated though, so I would suggest not making more than what you need!

Growing up, the only fish I would go near were tuna (in tuna salad) and salmon (made into salmon patties). I was a little leary about going on a limb and making a patty on my own, but my boyfriend has been getting sick of ground beef and chicken breasts. I made them as directed and I think they turned out great! My boyfriend has brought them up 3 different times in the last 2 hours! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a great recipe! I used shredded potatoes instead of flakes to match my cooking style better, and took the advice from other reviewers and added some fresh minced celery and a splash of lemon. Next time I might blanch the shredded potatoes a bit first to lose some starchiness - and will have to find some sort of chipotle sauce to go along!

I used this recipe as a base, but made some (quite a few) alterations (I'm a college student, I used what I had on hand)-
Green onions instead of onions,
thyme and a dash of italian seasoning instead of dill, 
Seasoned salt instead of Celery salt,
The result was good! I enjoyed it and will use this recipe again (perhaps following it a bit more closely next time).
I had it with a sauce that was equal parts sour cream and mayo with thyme, season salt and lemon

I really liked this recipe. not only was it easy and quick, it was very tasty. my 3 1/2 and 2 1/2 yr old also loved it. I did use potato "pellets" instead of the flakes which made it harder to mix, it did not adversely affect the taste but I will go along with the recipe next time and use the potato flakes.

Easy and very tasty. Wasn't sure where to find "potato flakes," so I ended up with instant mashed potatoes. Worked great. Didn't want to fry, so put them on the indoor electric grill, and they were great. Will definitely make again.

I was wary of making these because the salmon came from a can and wasn't fresh. They had VERY good flavor, however, and were even tastier the second day reheated. My husband loved them even though he had scoffed when I told him I was making "Salmon Patties" :) I served the patties with Broccoflower and topped both with the 'lemon sauce for salmon patties' from this website and it was excellant!

This is the first time I've ever made or eaten salmon patties and I have to say that picking through the can of salmon to take out the bones and skin really sucked, but they really were good. Since I really hated picking through it I ended up only using maybe about 3/4 of the can, maybe less. But I still used the same amount of everything else. I think if I used the whole can it would've been too much for me. So I got 5 good sized patties. I think these would be great on a bun with some mayo and juicy tomato. Mmmmmm.

These were very good. I wasn't sure about the potato, but I did use the potato flakes and they were very good. The only change I made was I used green onion instead of white (a must) and I just browned them in the pan and finished in the oven. They had a bit of trouble staying together, maybe I will add another egg or milk next time. These were very good, I will definitely make them again.

We really enjoyed these, they have a better texture than any other recipe I've tried. The only thing I did differently was to bake the patties instead of fry them. Will definitely make again, thanks!

I hated Salmon Patties growing up, my Mother would just add onions and saltines - YUCK! But now having made this recipe twice I feel like I've found the BEST way to take a can of Salmon and turn it into something that is actually quite tasty and comforting to eat.  Changes I made were simply in adding a few more ingredients, being two jalapenos that I minced with the onion and garlic (actually in my food processor), some Old Bay seasoning, splash of fresh lemon juice, 1/8 cup of cheese, which was an Italian Blend as that was what I had. I left out the dill though.  And since I burn everything I try to fry, I opted to broil them, 8 minutes on each side.  More healthy and they weren't greasy.  I served these patties on a toasted wheat bun with mayo, mustard and tomato.  Yum-O!

Very nice.  My husband and I both enjoyed them.  I think I would use a little less breadcrumbs next time.  I could still taste them once the patties were cooked

Great recipe! I loved the addition of the potato flakes - I used butter and herb. I also added about 4 TBLS of sofrito sauce ( a Puerto Rican blend of green & red peppers, onion, garlic, cilantro, parsley). I dusted mine with breadcrumbs and pan fried in olive oil and veg oil. So very good, and very easy to play with!

I needed a quick recipe for dinner, and chose this one. What a great recipe it is! With the advice of some of the other viewers, I omitted the celery & dill, and added old bay seasoning. I used garlic powder rather than fresh garlic. My kids who normally don't like fish, loved this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

These were very flavorful.  I have tried other  a salmon patties from this site, but this one is much better.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I add some parsley. I coated mine in panko bread crumbs and they turned out crispy and delicious.  I served them with a lemon dill cream sauce, steamed asparagus, and buttered rice.  A great meal. This one goes in my recipe box.

Very Good! I used panko crumbs to coat and it was great, nice and crisp. I made plenty and froze uncooked patties and those turned out just as good as the fresh. The kids loved them. I put out a variety of sauces from tartar to horseradish to plain ranch dressing and all worked nicely.

These turned out wonderfully in my opinion, but my 5 year old daughter didn't seem to go for them.  I did saute some onion and celery and added it to the patties.  I didn't have celery salt, so I used garlic salt and added some celery seed as well.  Very good!

I made mistake of NOT dicing up onions enough so the cakes tried to fall apart because of this.I'd add ingre. to spice it up a bit to your taste. You might want to reserve liquid from salmon just in case mixture gets dry/crumbly from extra ingre.(or use a favorite sauce instead).I used peanut oil to cook them instead of olive oil.Very good!

Wow!!! Quick, easy, and tasty!  I used salmon in the pouch and halved the recipe.  Subbed garlic salt for celery salt (didn't have any) and ommited the garlic (didn't have that either!)  Turned out super good, moist and tasty, I left the patties rather thick, and didn't have too much trouble with them falling apart.  I will definately be making again!

I am not a fan of canned salmon but these were really quite good.  Didn't have potato flakes so I substituted 1/4 cup left-over mashed potatoes and also added some shredded cheddar cheese.  Next time will re-dip them in more bread crumb mixture to make them a little crispier.  Also can't wait to try them with fresh minced salmon.

This is just as delicious as advertised!I used fresh salmon that I had baked and substituted Panko crumbs for the herbed seasoned dry bread crumbs. Yummy with homemade tartar sauce from this site.

I didn't care for this at all.  More potato taste than salmon.  I like my recipe more using saltine cracker crumbs, 1 egg, lemon pepper and dried dill weed.

This was a great recipe! Thanks Joy! Also too easy (except for prepping the salmon) Maybe I got the wrong kind; but it had bones and skin..kinda yucky, but tasted good. For the dip I mixed mayo,sour cream, shake of dill w/ pickle relish and lemon, it was a hit w/ the cakes. Also I used "garlic" m.pots, it was all I had. Very good!!

This recipe was pretty good. They tasted like tuna to me but so do all salmon cakes. They definately needed a dip. I just used sour cream which seem to compliment well.

These were ok. My husband liked them alot. Thought the potatoe flakes made them dry. Adding some cheese helped a little. Needs some kind of sauce to go with them. Not bad, but I'll probably stick to my old recipe.

I probably shouldn't even rate this as I didn't have all ing. on hand, I left out the potato flakes, the dill, and only had plain bread crumbs. So it's no wonder why I thought it was pretty bland. But I give it a 4 because I'm sure with the rest of the ing. it's great.

These were excellent. I did make only one change(minor). I substituted bread crumbs w/caesar salad croutons. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Mine did not turn out dry as others said. The flavor was great. Served with fresh lemons on the side. Thanks for a great recipe with salmon in a can!

As tasty as these were, they were on the dry side. Next time I'll try using real mashed potato instead of potato flakes. Hoping to make them a little moister, I served the patties with a newburg sauce (Knorr's). It helped and was very good.

Although I was missing some of the ingredients this was an excellent recipe that my fiance and I both loved and will make again. We were missing the celery salt and instead used onion powder to substitute. Next time I will make sure to have the celery salt on hand. We can't wait to try it again!

These were pretty good. I would suggest using a little less onion than the recipe calls for though. I like onions but there were just far too many. My husband thought these were ok even though he hates all sea food.

I have put this recipe into our regular rotation. We love it. It is a nice spin on traditional salmon patties. They are very quick and easy to make and my whole family loves them (even my picky two year old will pick them up and gobble them down. Very good with horseradish as the author suggested.

Tonight I prepared Potato Salmon Patties and they were Super!  With the combination of seasonings, makes it a very flavorful patty.  Also, because it was so simple to prepare, I liked it even more!

For two college kids who have never made much before, this was super easy and super yummy! I even fudged it a little - since I only had one small can of salmon I added a can of tuna and no one noticed.

My family has been enjoying Salmon Patties for years.  I tried this recipe one night after realizing I was out of some ingredients for our stand-by Salmon Patty recipe... now there's no going back! Everyone agreed this is the best Salmon Patties they'd ever tried!

I have made these a few times, and always to rave reviews. My 2 & 4 year old children devour them. I had to fudge a little, as I didn't have all the ingredients. I used plain bread crumbs and added some Knorr onion soup mix. I don't keep dried mashed potatoes, so made some fresh and added them. I served them with a tar tar sauce that I made fresh.

Thanks Joy, these are on my regular rotation!! Ohhhhh p.s. I doubled the recipe tonight and we only had one left!!

" Wow!!," said my husband.  He wants me to make this one again, and often.  He loved the onions in it - If your husband likes impossible cheesburger pie, he'll like this, too, if he enjoys salmon.

Very good.  I was surprised at how much I like them because Salmon cakes are not something that I usually enjoy because of the texture.  These are definitely worth making.

This had lots of flavor. My kids really loved it. I squeezed a lemon into the mix,italian style bread crumbs (I dont recommend that), garlic potatoes, old bay spices and some hot sauce. You will probably need more crumbs to get the mix to stick together better. Great recipe. I wasnt to crazy over the "soft bones" that was all thru the salmon! I know they are eatable but yuck...what a turn off. I'm hoping that all canned salmon isnt like that. It was in a orange can called "Honey Boy". Good luck!

Excellent!  They had a wonderful consistency and were so yummy with the lemon sauce for salmon patties.  Nest time I will make sure and chop my onions very fine(maybe in the food processor) because I was in a hurry and got a couple of big pieces of onion in some bites.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

My husband insisted I rate this.  I found a can of salmon in the pantry and came looking for a recipe and found this one.  I made it just as is and we really loved it.  I just served it with asparagus with lemon/butter and tarter sauce.  I put another can of salmon on my shopping list and I know it won't be there as long as the last one.

These were okay. They were too fishy tasting for me and my husband wasn't overly impressed with the flavor.  I added a couple dashes of hot sauce to it and made the Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties recipe from this site.  I had to put a ton of sauce on them to eat them.

Loved these salmon patties!  They smelled wonderful while cooking, and turned out very moist and tasty.  I might add some more breadcrumbs next time, because they didn't hold together very well.  I also used fresh chopped dill, which gave it a very fresh taste.

Very Good! These are very similar to my own recipe. I use the skinless, boneless salmon( 2 7oz cans) The Costco brand is a little dry, so next time I'll add another egg. I also use about 1/4 c. chopped onions that I saute' first. I don't understand why people would put cheese in their salmon patties- oh, well. I really like the use of the potato flakes- Idahoan are the best in my opinion! Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe!  I used left over broiled salmon (about 1 1/2 times more than the recipe called for) and used 3 eggs instead of 2 - they were perfect!  Also tried garlic butter flavored potato flakes which added good flavor without the guilt.  Highly recommeded.

I really liked the recipe as it stands.  I looked up a recipe using canned salmon because our income doesn't support fresh.  So all you fresh snobs please go rate a recipe that uses fresh salmon.

Will make again, for sure. No fishy taste and served with tartar sauce (homemade with Miracle Whip lite and pickle relish, s&p). Only change was finely chopped celery instead of celery salt. Delicious!

This recipe works good as written (4.5 stars). It also is adaptive which I like to do. Reading reviews led me to use fresh salmon and fried hash browns as well as saute the onion and garlic. It was a little mushy so I kept adding more salmon and Cajun seasoned chopped prawns. That bulked it up and made it even more delicious. I like extra dill as well as added some low salt Old Bay. They were even better than the original. I also used the recipe in a cream cheese lined tortilla, experimented by adding some pickled onion and Jalapeno. Topped w/ a little Monterey Jack, folded it in half and called it a "Caseydilla".  Feel free to add some heat...might do that w/ the last of the burger ingredients.

Used canned pink salmon, might try canned red. 
Add 1/8 cup shredded cheddar
reg salt instead of celery
add 1 tsp dijon mustard
splash of fresh lemon juice. 
Make some garlic dill sauce to put on top.

Delicious JUST HOW THEY ARE! I made them exactly to the recipe and these salmon patties were awesome. Just like my mom made. I ate them with ketchup growing up but I think I'll try some lemon sauce or tartar. Thanks.

I made these last night and they were a hit. I made a dill sauce and had a horseradish sauce as well, to serve them with. Paired nicely with sauteed asparagus w/mushrooms and grape tomatoes. Will definitely make again. Only variance: I baked them on cookie sheet instead of pan-frying (350ยฐ 35 mins) and used fresh mashed potatoes instead of flaked. Next time we may pan fry. I could see making these larger and serving on a sesame seed bun, burger-style.

I used real potatoes I placed in blender to puree and strained to drain the liquid instead of dry flakes. Next time I will try the dry flakes.

I've tried so many recipes for salmon patties I was beginning to think I'd never find the perfect one.  Well, I was wrong.  There, in my opinion, are perfect.  I made them exactly as written and they were fantastic.  I served them with a simple butter cream sauce and steamed broccoli and rice.  Everyone loved it.

Keto alternative   I shredded zucchini and squash and mixed left over salmon in with it. I added coconut flour and almond flour to form the patti , EXCEPTIONAL!  Will make it again except I added old bay.

These were pretty great. I think they could have used another egg, or maybe a less-thorough draining of the salmon. Just a tad more moisture. But otherwise very good!

It turned out good and made it in muffin tin. FYI a double recipe perfectly makes 12 cakes in the muffin tin.                       My kids always thumbed their nose at the idea of salmon cakes. Guess what?  They ate them and loved them!  Added mustard, lemon, juice, and hot sauce like many suggested. If I was to do it again would add some smoked paprika. Would definitely benefit from some celery both for flavor and moistness.

Instead of potato flakes I boiled one small Yukon gold potato, let cool, peel the skin, slice and dice then continue on with recipe. 

I also used wild caught salmon that was baked and left over from another meal. 

The best most moist fish cakes I have ever had.

This recipe was delicious! I used a combination of left over salmon( from dinner a couple days ago) and one small can of salmon from the pantry. I used finey chopped celery leaves instead of celery salt and added just a bit of mild because the mix seemed a bit dry. Will definitely make these again.

Yum! I didn't have any regular breadcrumbs, so I used panko. I also added a splash of lemon juice (just because I like lemon with salmon). Otherwise I followed the recipe as written and it was delicious. My picky 5-year-old only ate a couple of bites, but everyone else had seconds. It's a keeper!

Very good.  Darling daughter liked it!  (Amaze-balls!)
Substituted green pepper for onion as daughter has an onion sensitivity.   Used some leftover breadcrumbs that are for turkey dressing, which helps me use them up.  Served with cocktail sauce. A good dinner entree or appetizer!

Wonderful recipe!  I used frozen salmon, and omitted the dill (we don't care for it),  left out the celery salt, and used Old Bay Seasoning instead.  My husband who is not a fan of Salmon Patties, said these were the best he has ever had!  Thank you Joy Lee for sharing - will be making these often!

I followed the recipe to the T! They were very tasty, but quite dry. I believe I will have to do some adjusting to the recipe. I served them with a remoulade sauce which helped to keep them from being too dry to eat.

I got a "can you make this again?" from the hubby. Make sure you debone the salmon and I added a little lemon pepper. I miss read the recipe and I added the olive oil into the mixture.... it actually helped keep it together! When I served them (over herbed rice) I added a dollop of sour cream.

Definitely a good salmon patty recipe.  Even my five and six year old grand kids liked them and asked for seconds.  I don't think they realized there were onions in them (I chopped them very fine).  I doubled the recipe but had to add an additional egg as they weren't holding together well with the first try.

I must try this! Sounds better than my plain old patties. The potato flakes and breadcrumbs seem like it would make a great filler rather than my same old cornmeal & flour. I will try this and give it an actual tested and tried review. Thanks for sharing.

I made these the other day except I used tuna. They were pretty good. Not very fishy at all. Will be making again.

Great recipe! I adjusted it a little knowing my preferences & reading other reviews - used mashed potatoes (no butter/milk), half a red onion, and a tsp of dijon mustard. Coconut oil for frying was a great choice too :) Delish!

It was really good and my kids liked it too! The only change I made was adding 1/4 cup shredded cheese (as others recommended). Also, I used scallions instead of regular onions which gave a nice flavor. 

Great recipe, will be adding it to our regular line up. Thanks for posting it!

Really tasty, quick, and filling.  This will be a regular for us.  I added a quick and tasty dill sauce (greek yogurt and organic dill dip packet).

I am not sure what others did wrong with this recipe, but I did these for dinner tonight and found them so easy and delicious!  Did not change a thing about them and they came out crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle.  I made a broccoli salad and cream corn to go with it, dinner was ready in less than an hour!  This will be going into my recipe rotation for sure.

This was okay.  I'd rather have salmon patties without the extra spices.  And the recipe needs to call for more oil to fry them in.

This is a great recipe! After growing up eating my Mom's version I developed a hatred for salmon patties. However my Honey Honey asked me to make salmon patties and I found this recipe.  He loved them and I liked them as well! I now have to double the recipe because the last batch I  made his son ate them all. Thanks for a great dish!

I found these dry and not a taste I liked at all.  Adding the onion without sauteing it first was a mistake -- the onion taste was completely separate .. I'd say just use onion powder if not sauteing the onion.  I'd omit the potato flakes -- they didn't add anything at all, add 1/4 cup of fine chopped celery to add a slight crunchy moisture, and find a good sauce -- possibly a honey mustard or something spicey.
But I won't make this one again.

Very simple and my kids and husband loved them. I used a little more oil to cook them in so they had a crunch and didnt have and celery salt and it was ok. Oh also left out the onions and was still pretty good.

I made this recipe (with a few modifications) last night and it was soooo delicious. I used hash browns instead of the potato flakes and changed up the seasonings a bit. I will most definitely make this again since I'm exercising more and could used the protein.

These are really good.  I didn't have any potato flakes, so I just added more bread crumbs, which worked just fine, and I also added some finely chopped fresh spinach.  They were wonderful!

This recipe was a great twist to the old school version.  Any seafood cakes can be dry no matter what version. The recipe called for dry flakes and there were a few post saying cakes turned out dry.  I also did not want to open a box using only 1/4 cup.  I figured making the whole one would leave a useful leftover.  It made sense to use them cooked they bring some moisture as well as making them gooey. I also added finely crushed french fried onions in the cake mixture and also coat before frying.  Added Old Bay and/or Cajun gives a little kick.  Great recipe so moist.

I made these and followed the recipe except I added a little milk because I was planning on baking them. I ended up frying them. they were very good. My husband loved them and he is not a salmon lover.

Parents and toddlers all loved these at my house!  I baked these at 400 instead of frying (more to do with my inability to fry than my wanting to change the recipe) so I did saute the garlic/onion before mixing in with the rest of the ingredients.  I was also light with the dill and added some dried chopped chives per our preferences.

It was a great starting recipe!  I didn't have any dry potato flakes, so I used panko instead.  I also added 1 Tbs of balsamic vinaigrette, just because I thought it'd give it some more flavor.  Oh, and I had to baked some frozen salmon since those were the only kind I had.  The husband thought it was excellent! :)  It was easy to make, but fancy enough for guests!  I also made a dipping sauce with mayo, sweet relish, and some Sriracha sauce - but it really didn't need it!

This is by far the best salmon patty recipe I've come across.  The ingredients are so simple and they blend so well, it really makes the patties taste so good! My family raved about them and they were gone!  I did make one change...I used frozen salmon fillets, which I think made the taste all the more better! I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to try this recipe..it is great!

This was fairly easy to make.  My husband loved it more than I did, so I would make it again.  We're trying to incorporate more fish, specifically salmon, in diet and this added a twist.  I whipped some mayo and relish together for and served with corn and a salad.  I didn't have any celery salt, but it tasted good so it obviously wasn't a necessary ingredient.

These were really good! My In Laws Loved them, even my kids ate them. I did use fresh salmon instead of canned , that's what I had on hand, and steamed it, then followed the recipe, served with tartar sauce! Will be making often!

Just made these tonight.. they seemed easier than other salmon patties I've made in the past.  The adults in the house loved them but I'm not entirely sure I could pull them off on the kids.  I added an extra egg per some of the reviews.  Thanks for the recipe and a great grown up meal.

I thought it was really tasty, though slightly dry.  My biggest concern with this recipe was that there was an excessive amount of onion in it.  I would personally cut the amount of onion back to 1/4 the original recipe amount.

Very good when made as written (4.5 stars), but even better when you spice it up a bit. I have my own mix of seasonings that I add to the mix including a little old bay seasoning & red pepper. They are a little drier than the usual patties I make - but it wasn't a bad thing. All-in-all a very good variation.

This is an awesome recipe, delicious! I also baked the patties because my mom's a health freak and i didn't have dill weed at my store so i used dill pickles haha, it wasn't too bad. Next time ill add the celery salt, i can't seem to find it either. Awesome recipe

These patties were okay.  Can't say we really noticed anything different from the potato flakes.  I think the patties could use more bread crumbs to help them stay together better.  Tasty, but not that special.

Absolutely delicious. I didnt change a thing except I didn't have the herbed breadcrumbs, so I added a sprinkle of mixed herbs. I used pink salmon.Texture was beautiful, not too dry. I really minced the onion up good, so maybe that helped with the moisture.

Well, I thought these were really good as written, except I did add some extra potato flakes to get them to hold together... they were kind of 'loose'.  I think next time I will add Old Bay Seasoning because we love it!  We ate these with Blooming Onion Dipping sauce and they were GREAT with the sauce!  Recommended recipe!

Easy and delicious! The patties were kind of dry and crumbled when I turned them, so I might tweak the recipe a little next time, but other than that, my whole family loved them.

4 stars for being so easy and tasty, mine came out a tad dry though and I would have liked the onions to have been less crunchy.

I followed the recipe exactly, except for celery seed, since I don't like the flavor of that spice. I thought it was very good, I never made salmon patties before.  My 2 year old son, who is a pick eater, ate a bite and asked for more. My older kids will not try them, since they didn't care for the smell when it was cooking.  I will probably make again, if I am having company that likes salmon patties.

We all liked this, added lemon juice, dijon, celery, green onions and coated in panko before grilling.  Good for burgers or on a salad.

This is only my second time to make salmon patties. We like salmon, but the first time I made salmon patties, we really didn't like it. This recipe changes that! This was delicious and will become a regular way to get those good fats into our diet. Thanks!!!

I love this recipe. The only thing I changed was I used tuna rather than salmon. My family loves it so much I have to triple the recipe just to have a little leftovers for later.

I'm giving this recipe the benefit of one additional star, as I think I am just not a fan of salmon patties.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using onion flakes instead of minced onion.  If I were to make this again, I think I would use either onion powder or be sure to saute the onion (and definitely not a whole one!) until very soft - as the crunch of the onion did not appeal to me.  I ate my patties with the "Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties" and some roasted broccoli.

Tastes like a salmon patty...mmmmgoood. But it did fall apart just like a salmon patty. I baked some and pan fried some, the pan fried was much better.

Nice salmon cakes.  I added a tad of oil to help keep them from falling apart, although they still did a bit, so I guess I didn't add enough.  I also formed them ahead of time then fried them.  I made smaller patties by using my trigger ice cream scoop (it scoops things to about the size of muffins) and then just patted them flat.  I got about 7 small patties that way.  I served tonight with tartar sauce, lettuce, tomato and bread.  Definitely a hit--bf liked them a lot and so did I.  Thanks for the recipe!

I will never make again.  My step dad made some salmon patties when I was a kid and I don't know if it's the fact that I was really young or not. This was the first time making salmon.  I will try a different recipe, but not this one again.  My husband and son didn't even touch it.  I cooked exactly as it directed on the recipe.  I think it might have been the combination of ingredients in this recipe.

These were so tasty. I didn't have celery salt, so I added about 2 T. finely chopped celery. The only other change I made was omitting the seasoned bread crumbs - instead, I coated the patties in seasoned panko bread crumbs before frying them.   I served them with coleslaw. They didn't need any sauce in my opinion.

Followed a combination of reviews, used fresh salmon baked in foil for 40mins with salt, pepper, olive oil and lemon juice. Used two potatoes boiled and mashed in place of the potato flakes. Didn't add celery salt or dill weed. Baked in the oven for 20 minutes. Overall turned out very well, served with a garlic aรฏoli.

I've made these twice now - once with the potato flakes and once using 1/2 c. seasoned dry bread crumbs.  I prefer it using only bread crumbs.  Also, per other reviews, I added the juice of half a lemon, and 1/2 tsp. each dried chives and dried parsley. Very good recipe.  Will make again!

These were great and will added to my regularly rotated salmon recipes. Added another egg and one small mashed potato (instead of flakes) and a touch of Worcestershire sauce. Delicious!

Even the kids loved these.  Subbed unseasoned Panko for breadcrumbs since I didn't have any on hand and seasoned with greek seasoning, garlic salt and pepper.  Didn't add dill or celery seed by choice, but forgot the garlic by accident. It was still super.

I have NEVER given such a low rating on any recipe thus far, but these were just awful to us.  For my husband and I to throw something out, I know that we truly have not enjoyed it.  I did use fresh salmon (should be better than canned) and I have never bought dried potato flakes, so I used real potatoes that I grated.  I did bake rather than fry, but still can't imagine that frying these would take my rating much higher.  Really sorry, just not for us.

Great recipe. The combination of breadcrumbs & potato flake crisp these patties right up with excellent aroma from the herbs. I followed the recipe as is, but added a little salt & pepper. Great served with cream peas or i made a creamy dill dip. A keeper!

Really fast to throw together and even the daughter that is not fond of salmon enjoyed these. I used skinless boneless canned salmon so I didn't have to muck with it. Fries up quickly to a nice golden brown.

These were pretty good, but just from reading the recipe, I knew I would need more seasoning so I put in a full tsp of dill, and replaced the celery salt with ground celery seed, I also rolled these in cornmeal before flattening and frying.  We dip these in the "South Texas Tartar Sauce" you find on allrecipes...yummy!

My family loved this recipe. I didn't have garlic and herb bread crumbs so I just used original and added a garlic and herb seasoning I had. I also had no potato flakes so I doubled the bread crumbs.

I tried this recipe because I had to find something to do with leftover salmon from the night before.  I didn't have potato flakes so I shredded a potatoe and microwaved it for about 3 minutes.  You definitely need to add more spices.  I added lemon juice, but definitely need more spices.  I didn't really care for them, but my husband ate them so it was still better than tossing the leftover salmon!

These were very bland. I made them in the oven instead of frying them, maybe frying them would have helped? The recipe doesn't call for enough spice. I won't be trying this recipe again even to try frying. We ended up throwing them out and eating frozen burritos for dinner. Sorry this was just not good.

Made these for dinner and my husband loved them.  I was concerned that there was no added liquid in them other than the eggs but they were not dry at all.  Well certainly make them again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These were very good and not to dry at all!. I was nervous b/c they kept falling apart before I got them to the pan but once they started cooking they stayed together. I served them with cream peas and toast! Tasted just like my great grandma's. I will make these again.

Not that great to my husband and me.  Really needs the dipping sauce to offset it.  I went to the grocery store after I made them, just to get some sauce.  I had never used canned salmon before and that was a pain, picking all the bones out.  Then the whole house smelled like fried salmon.  I was missing the celery salt, but that couldn't haven been what makes these taste so great.

I loved these. I served them with a chipotle maple aioli for dipping. I don't keep potato flakes in the house so I added 1 cup of frozen hashbrowns. I also add 1 tbsp of lemon jiuce and more dill. Delicious!

I halved the recipe since we are a family of only 2 and a half. I didn't have any potato flakes on hand so I reduced the amount of salmon and added a small, grated red potato. I also gave the whole recipe a generous sprinkling of seasoning salt before forming the patties and right after frying. My 1 year old loved them and had to share with me since my husband loved them so much that he was unwilling to share any, even to his own daughter ;)

I fixed this for dinner tonight and we really enjoyed it.  I will definitely fix it again.  I will reduce the amount of onion next time.  I also made a cream sauce and put in canned (drained) Italian seasoned diced tomatoes.  It was very good with Italian green beans and mashed potatoes with roasted garlic seasoning in the potatoes.

Thanks for a great meal!

These were very good.  I made a good sauce out of mayonnaise and horseradish to put on top.

This was easy to make.  My husband does not like anything too 'fishy' and he asked me to save the recipe.  Really worth trying.

These were very "fishy" tasting.  Given the irony of that statement about a salmon recipe, I was trying for something milder.  I used the red salmon per some reviewers' suggestion, doubled the potato flakes instead of using flakes and breadcrumbs.  I also added 1/2 c sharp shredded cheddar and about 1/3 c half and half.  Left out the garlic because of personal taste, perhaps that was the problem.  The texture and moisture content was just right, but I'd need to figure out something to make them less fishy to make again.

I followed the recipe pretty close, although I was out of dill and I added 1t of Old Bay Spice.  My three kids loved these, which is something that doesn't happen very often.  I would recommend cutting the onion very fine.  Mine was a little course and it made the pattie a bit harder to hold together.

This is my go-to recipe when I have nothing in the house. I have made it too many times to count.  Fussy kids even like it now, but it took a few times.

The first salmon patties I've ever eaten.  They were crispy outside and tender inside.  There was no strong fishy smell.  Thanks.

We enjoyed these. The only problem I had is they didn't stick together all that well. And I would recommend you use the de-boned de-skinned salmon. It's more expensive but well worth it in my opinion.

These were really good. I was out of dill weed, celery salt, seasoned bread crumbs, and onions. I substituted 1 T Mrs. Dash, 1 T onion powder, 1 T lemon pepper, 1 T Old Bay seasoning, 3 T lemon juice, and 3 T Worcestershire sauce. The texture was great, I fried them in oil, but I think they would have been just as good baked. I served them with mustard and horseradish.

These were great. The Hubby & 3 yr old were happy.  I used green onions and garlic powder, in place of their counterparts because it was was I had in stock. I cut an egg and used Pam instead of oil for diet purposed.  This made them break a bit, but still good.  For the sheltered souls that have never seen canned salmon, it looks disgusting.  But wait for the finished product, it's worth it.

I have four college-age children in my house.  They started fixing their own dinner when they saw I was making salmon patties.  After I was finished they took a few nibbles and ate them all up before I knew what was happening!!  These are really awesome.  Thanks for a great recipe!

So easy and very yummy.  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand.  I didn't have potato flakes so I used panko.  Also, I baked these at 350 for 40 minutes so they were nice and crisp.

Salmon patties are a favorite in my family, and this was a major improvement. I didn't have "garlic & herb" bread crumbs, so I used regular bread crumbs and added some garlic powder. I followed the recipe, otherwise. Delicious!

Used to hate salmon patties because my mom's were so bland. Wanted to make them for my husband because he loves salmon patties. Tried this recipe and he loved them and now I can eat them!

I tried this recipe using leftover salmon and green onions.  The kids wouldn't eat the salmon filets, but they rated this dish 4 stars.  They don't even know they ate onions.

The flavor of these patties is great - I just found them a bit dry, despite the splash of lemon that  I added. I think next time I'll add a bit of milk or water as well.

this was the first time I made a childhood favorite and it was GREAT. I personally think I added to much onions so I will cut back next time and I did not have celery salt so I used Old Bay seasoning. It was great. Thanks for sharing.

Hmm - our family loves these, even the toddler.  I never use canned salmon, though.  Always wild salmon, either fresh or frozen, that I bake at 400 degrees until moist & flaky.  It must be served with a sauce: I've used the Wine Sauce for Seafood recipe on this site and also a lemony aioli mayo.

My husbanf loved these.  He said they actually tasted like salmon and not like bread as so many other salmon patties have.  I many tinker with seasonings some to get just the right zing for my taste buds.

Great way to add fish to your diet.  The potatoes really add texture so the patties don't fall apart.  Used Ranch dressing for sauce and loved it. No leftovers here!

My family really enjoyed the salmon patties. I didn't have any dill and so I added some lemon pepper seasoning, they were still excellent!

These were really good. I didn't care for that much onion so next time I will put in less.  They were even better the next day warmed up.  I just served them with tarter sause and it was great. Thanks

These were absolutely wonderful. I didn't have breadcrumbs, so I used crushed saltines, and I didn't have celery salt, so I used fresh celery. They still turned out great.

WONDERFUL!  Even with one egg (I wouldn't advise), because one egg was all I had.  It crumbled some, but the flavor was perrrrrrrrrrfect!  Make sure to have those 2 EGGS!!!

Had a craving for more fish tonight, so made these.  They were good. I made "Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties" from this website, but I need to try them with horseradish as recommended; I think I'll like that better.

When I was little my grandma made the best salmon patties, and either my taste has changed, or hers were better, because these were just okay for me. I made them just as the recipe says and I made a dip of cocktail/tarter sauce combo with some extra hot horseradish (which that was REALLY good). Maybe next time!!

My husband thought they were ok, I asked him if he would like them again, he said, maybe.  I did not like them very much.  I used leftover fresh salmon, thought this would be a great way to use left overs.  They didn't have much flavor.  My kids hated them. Didn't like the potato flakes in them.  Maybe a leftover baked potato would be better and more spice.

These Salmon Patties were ok.  I only used 1/2 of onion and didn't include celery salt because I didn't have any.  Maybe it was the onion or the dill weed but the overall taste wasn't very appealing for my taste buds.  Thanks for the recipe though.

Well, my husband loved it and wants it for leftovers, however I found the salmon pattie very dry and tasteless.  I did not use canned salmon, instead the pouches (3) and this could have contributed to the dryness since there was no oil.  I also used one baking potato instead of flakes, but I had read another reader had done the same thing and they didn't complain of dryness.  Probably won't make this recipe again, but it was probably my own fault it was dry.

These were ok but nothing great. It may be my fault b/c I used onion powder and garlic salt, so they were a little dry. Might try again w/ proper ingredients.

These are so good! Better than regular salmon patties. The potatoes give it a great texture. I used tuna and they came out great.

I made this recipe wondering if we were going to like it. I had made salmon patties before without much success. My fears were unfounded! This is a delicious recipe and I will make it again and again. I followed others' ideas and drained the salmon, the patties came out just perfect.

Great use of salmon.  My kids don't usually go for new foods but this one they tried.  My pickiest eater ate 3.  We liked them with other sauces like BBQ and honey mustard.  Easy, quick, great meal.

I used garlic potato flakes(from instant mashed potato mix), added red pepper flakes, and minced the garlic very finely as suggested and it was delicious. Try not to make the patties too large or they'll break when you cook them.

Excellent!  My kids ate them and my husband even suggested that we have Salmon patties more often!!!  I love the cheddar cheese addition that some of the other reviews added.
