Instead of Country Crock I used equal amounts butter. I used one large package of frozen broccoli because that was all I had for frozen vegetables. This was an okay quick meal. I would like to try this again but use the cheese and milk and make a quick cheese sauce instead of layering it like the directions asked. I think the end result would have been better.

I tried this recipe yesterday. I used mixed vegetables and also a bag of frozen broccoli. Because it was a little dry next time I would add a can of cream of chicken soup and some spices. Overall though my family really liked it and it was easy.

For a dish so simple this meal was actually very good. Even my 16 month old (who happens to be very picky) had seconds of this. I did dress this recipe up as it seemed it would be extremely bland otherwise. I added a can of Campbell's fiesta nacho cheese soup to the mixture. I also diced my chicken breast prior to sauteing it and seasoned it with garlic salt and onion powder. While this doesn't seem that it would do much to help a dish it certainly did in my opinion.

This was very nice after I added Lawry's Seasoned Salt and black pepper to taste on my plate otherwise it's bland. You'll notice there are no spices in the recipe as written. Next time I'll add the spices when assembling. I will be making this again. Update: This time I used leftover Christmas turkey breast and added 2 tablespoons (yes tablespoons) of low sodium seasoned salt and 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper to the mix. This makes a good 10 cups which doesn't fit into my 9x9x2 inch square glass baking dish. I had 4 cups left to freeze. I think 8 ounces of dry pasta (by weight) is too much. I will use 4-6 ounces next time. I used Birdeye's California blend vegetables thawed and cut into bite-sized pieces. I do like this recipe but it needs a little tweaking.

The kids loved this. I doubled the topping and also topped with sliced American cheese. However it still wasn't cheesy enough. I would double up the cheese. Also I used a mix of different cheeses.

My husband I really enjoyed this i added two boxes of mac and cheese cooked to the instructions on box. Made enough to put into 9x13 pan and baked everything else all the same.

This was ok. Might be better with butter. Seems like a good kid food. Nice and quick.
