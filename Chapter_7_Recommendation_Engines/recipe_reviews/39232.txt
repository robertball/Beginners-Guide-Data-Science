Now, I disagree with the idea of cookies for breakfast but these were good and the family thought they were great.  I can't eat alot of them, (too sweet) and I probally won't make them very often but the family thought these were a great treat!! Will make again...every once in a while.

These were very good, only change was that they seemed way too thick for my liking, the first one was like an inch tall! I added probably another 1/2 c of milk to thin it down.

These pancakes are so delicious, way better than that 'international pancake' place!! We have them at least twice a month and we'd eat them more often but that might be dangerous to the waistline. To make sure I always have the time for these I sometimes put the dry ingredients together the night before and that shaves off a few minutes in a busy household. There's just something about those warm chocolate chips....

Big, fluffy pancakes!  Didn't have any strawberries and were still good.  Will make this one again.

These pancakes had a good flavor, but they were really thick.  I had to add a good bit more milk to the recipe.  Adding the strawberries was an interesting twist.

How could you not like this recipe.  It was a an easy recipe to make and everyone enjoyes it at breakfast.  My nephew is a picky eater and asked for a third pancake.  My sister went home with a copy of the recipe.  Thank you.

I used buttermilk instead of regular milk and melted butter in place of the vegetable oil. These pancakes turned out fluffy and luscious. There wasn't enough for me to have any (my husband and boys ate every one of the pancakes I made) so next time, I'll double the recipe. Huge hit--great weekend treat.

My family did like this recipe, though we thought they were just ok, nothing special. I did put extra milk in to thin it down and  I think if I did make it again, I'd cut down on the amount of choc. chips. I mean it is breakfast!!!

I made these this morning. I have  3 kids and 1 out of 3 liked these. I thought they were good but wanted something for the kids. My kids are hard to plase. I keep trying.

I thought these pancakes were just OK, nothing special, which surprised me because I love Toll House cookies.  I followed the recipe as stated but didn't have mini chips so I chopped regular chocolate chips.  My kids said that they were alright but they've had better.  I don't think I will make these again.

This recipe was easy enough to throw together and tasted great.  I did add more milk so the pancakes wouldn't be so dense. My kids thank you.

i followed others' advice and added another 1/4 c. milk; could have used some more as they were still pretty dense. these weren't as good as i'd hoped when i read they were better than ihop's (my personal fave), but there were many variables in place that could have affected the outcome. so i'll give them another shot. when asked, my husband said he'd rate them 4 out of 5 stars, so there you have it. also, if you don't have children as we don't, you may want to cut this recipe in half; it made about 18 pancakes.

Delish!  Tasted almost like a chocolate chip cookie!  I followed the recipe and found that I had more than enough milk, even though other reviewers suggested there wasn't enough.  I'd not change a thing!

What a great recipe!! Im actually going to make these again for breakfast and I felt guilty that I had used the recipe so many times and not reviewed it as yet!! The first time I made pancakes, I used this recipe and asked my husband if he wanted chocolate chips, to which he replied " What am I . 5 yrs old??" Well I made some without and some with chocolate chips ( for my self) and can I just say , these were the best pancakes we both have ever had. Its a versatile recipe to which you could add just about anything. I did have to add a bit more milk to thin it out, but it was FABULOUS!! YUM!!!

I improvised the recipe a little, adding things from my other pancake recipes that I like including a touch of ground cinnamon, vanilla and lemon juice. The results were terrific. Also, instead of mixing the chocolate chips in the batter, I sprinkled them on the pancake while it was on the griddle (I forgot to put them in the mix). Kids went nuts over them. I made heart-shaped ones. Flavor was very good. I liked the addition of the brown sugar because it gave a nice color and texture to the pancake. I also used regular sized chips instead of the mini size.

These are great pancakes!  I also added a little more milk (only about 1/4 cup) and I mixed them in my blender (makes for easy pouring of pancakes) so some of the chocolate chips were chopped up giving the entire pancake chocolatey goodness!  Everyone in my family gave them rave reviews.

Excellent pancakes--fluffy and delicious.  A hit with my 4 kids.  I too added about 1/4 cup more milk and the batter was the perfect consistency.  An easy and delicious breakfast treat.
