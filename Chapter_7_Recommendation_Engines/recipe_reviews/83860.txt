The best thing ever to do with those ubiquitous summer squash. After reading other reviews, wanted to avoid the "eggy" thing, so removed one of the egg yolks. Added 4 oz. of fresh, sliced mushrooms and a bit of thinly sliced yellow onion, as well as 1/2 tsp. of Hot Chinese Mustard.(Think Dijon would have worked well, too.) Steamed the squash for 6 min. to retain a vestige of vitamins. No salt or pepper. Shredded a little extra cheese on top, and baked @ 350 for 45 min., to match something else already in the oven. My husband and I both loved it. Will never turn down an offer for yellow squash from a gardener again!

Very delicious. I didn't have any egg on hand so I just added about half again as much cheese and 3 tablespoons of flour. I also sprinkled some extra cheese on top and a mixture of 1/4 cup bread crumbs and 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil. The topping added an extra crunch that made the dish more enjoyable. I also only needed to cook the dish for about 15 minutes since the squash was already cooked.

We enjoyed this very much, I did only use 1 egg due to reading the reviews and I also added garlic, just seems I have to put garlic in most everything.

This recipe is great; I've fixed it many times and have passed it on to friends and family who also love it. I use more cheese (usually at least 3 cups and I like to mix cheddar with Colby jack) to taste, omit the wine, and add onion. I usually steam the squash first but if I forget I just up the temp to about 400 and leave the lid for 30 minutes. I also add a topping of breadcrumbs mixed with spicy breader (fish batter) and a dash of olive oil.(~1/4 c each. stir until all topping is moist and crumbly and sprinkle over top) I add this after I take the lid off or about 20 minutes before it is done. I've used canned squash and I've also substituted with zucchini and it was great both ways! Our family favorite!

The recipe came out a little bit eggy for me, but the white wine was a nice touch for a squash casserole; I liked that combination. It also improved as leftovers, which is an additional plus. Very easy. Thanks for the recipe!

I agree with the previous reviewers that the amount of squash is not as clear as it could be--it would be better given by weight.  That said, however, this is easy and pretty good.  I used two decent-size yellow squash, one egg, 1/2 c. white wine, 1/3 c. chopped onion, 1/2 t. salt, maybe 1/3 t. coarse pepper, maybe 2/3 c. mozzarella cheese, and one piece of bread crumbled over the top.  I baked in a loaf pan at 375 for an hour.  I liked the white wine flavor.

This recipe turned out just okay. I found the "8 yellow squash" to be very vague.  Big?  Little?  Maybe I had too much squash in it because that is all I could taste.

Not very flavorful, but I'm a person who likes a little spice to a dish. Also a little eggy for my tastes.

Some mentioned they didn't like the eggs.  I loved the eggs in it.  I did add fresh rosemary and onions for extra flavor.  It's a keeper for us.  Thanks to Allrecipes.com, we enjoy many great meals!

This is a great recipe but I will double the squash next time adding salt, pepper accordingly.  I did this in a 8x11 glass dish and it still didn't fill the dish up.  Can't imagine how it works in a 9x13???  Overall though, great recipe!

I too eliminated 1 egg as several people suggested. I added about 1/2 a cup of thinly sliced yellow onion and didn't bother to cook it before mixing it in with the other ingredients and it turned out just fine. I also added some extra cheese on top and the recommended 1/4 of breadcrumbs with some drizzled olive oil. I would probably add 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs next time and perhaps try some mustard. The wine definitely added a unique touch. Certainly a nice spin on traditional squash casserole.

You have to love yellow squash to enjoy various squash recipes.  I do.  I am trying to use up the garden's bounty, so I searched for new casserole and found this one.  It was simple and tasty.  I ate about 3 servings.  Fed our family of 8 with generous servings.  Nutritionally....well...by the time you boil 10 minutes and bake an hour, probably not a lot there besides the eggs and cheese, but it was yummy and simple to make.

This turned out pretty tasty with the white wine. I added about 3 slices of crispy crumbled bacon on top. I also used crooked neck yellow squash and removed most of the seeds before boiling.

I microwaved the squash instead of boiling and added about 2 tablespoons of minced onion.  For the cheese, I used Sargento's shredded 2%, 4  cheese Mexican.  Baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  Only change I would make next time would be to cut the squash into smaller cubes.

I like having meatless meals once or twice a week so I made this one because I was intrigued by the addition of white wine to a squash casserole.  I used about 2# of sliced yellow squash.  I simmered them in a skillet with the wine and 1/2 cup of water, 2 t. chicken "Better than Bouillon," and several sprigs of fresh thyme.  I also added 2 T of cream cheese along with the cheddar cheese.  I put crispy onion rings on top for some additional flavor and crunch.  My family and I loved it.  This is going to my permanent recipe box.  Thanks!

Very bland. I added onion and garlic and still too bland. Needs better definition of the squash quantity: cups or pounds. I used five and it was too much. Eight would have been way too much.
