As a Tiramisu-Lover, I decided to try this recipe, based on the reviews.  The only thing I can say is WOW!!!!  The RICH & CREAMY flavor mixed with the Coffee-soaked lady fingers leaves you wanting more!  VERY IMPORTANT: Let it refrigerate AT LEAST 24 hours; the flavors really need to blend!! I tasted the mixture right after adding the Marscapone Cheese and it tasted very bland.  However, after refrigerating overnight, it was probably better than any Tiramisu I'd ever tasted.  ONE MORE IMPORTANT TIP: As others have mentioned, doubling the coffee / rum mixture is a MUST.  You get that espresso taste, blended with the creamy flavor - HEAVENLY!

This is the recipe to try if you´ll make your Tiramisu.  I was unsure wich recipe to try, ´cause others had more reviews.  Lucky me, I try this one. My husband, a very picky eater, loved this and didn´t stop the MMMM! while he was eating.  The milk in the egg mixture makes the difference. Few tips: 1. make 2 days ahead, it´s the peak of flavors and consistency.  2. double the amount of coffe/liquor, it´s not enough.  3. use soft lady finger, the others are just like rocks. 4. don´t be tempted to lower the amount of sugar, I did based on a preview review, big mistake, went from a 3/4 cup wich is what the recipe call for, to 2/3 cup, the little extra sugar was missing, and I don´t have a sweet tooth.  5.  serve chilled, just my taste but it´s wonderful in this warm day to have a cold dessert.  6.  be carefull, one piece of this has tons of calories, your waist and hips are going to tell you sooner than later.  7. mix well the egg and sugar and when you cook the mixture NEVER stop beating, this makes a silky smoth texture.  8. with a electrical mixer add the mascarpone to the milk/egg, this way you avoid clumps and keeps the silky texture.

I don't normally bring a dish to a party until I've "test drove" it with my immediate family, but I decided to go ahead and trust the allrecipes community and brought this to our extended family Christmas party this past weekend.  It was a hit.  I'm picky about my tiramisu and was doubtful that I could produce one that I really liked.  This is it.  
I took the advice of several others and doubled the coffee mixture, and had just enough.  I didn't have any rum on hand, so I substituted with Frangelica.  Yum!
Also, as noted by other posts, don't judge by the way it tastes when you are making it.  I thought it quite blah during preparation, but after 2 days in the fridge it was delicious.  
For presentation purposes, I made it in a trifle dish. I modified the layering a bit, but used the same amount of ingredients and it fit perfectly.  I covered the bottom of the dish with lady fingers and then also stood them up along the outside of the circumference of the dish (on the first layer only).  I then did a layer of filling, layer of cream, second layer of ladyfingers, layer of filling, layer of cream, third layer of ladyfingers, layer of filling, layer of cream.
Thanks for adding another great dessert recipe to my collection!

FanFreakin'tastic!!!! OMG....I am so glad that I chose this recipe over the many others on this site...I made this Christmas eve to serve for dessert on Christmas day for 10 of us. It was absolutely the best, and my family raved over it.....I made espresso using instant espresso granuals, used Kahlua instead of the rum, and did need to double this as the lady fingers are like little sponges. I did use the Savoiardi lady fingers that I easily found at Shop-Rite. They are the hard lady fingers, not the soft. I dipped each one half-way(long ways)and then placed the espresso/kahlua side up in a tin pan (11 3/4" X 9 1/2") and then spred my filling on top. By the way I loved that the egg yolks were cooked and that you didnt need to use a double boiler, after I made the egg yolk and marscapone filling, I made the whipped cream and then folded that into the cheese mixture (so I had one filling instead of 2)I layered the filling over the fingers and repeated. I made 3 layers with the marscapone cheese filling on the top. I dusted with the cocoa powder when I served the dessert. Everyone said it tasted like it was from a fine Italian restuarant. I was nervous that it would become soggy and runny....and that was not the case it was perfect. I recommend folding the whipped cream into the egg/cheese filling. I really think it saves a step and really makes the filling light and very flavorful. Thanks for this recipe. I highly rate this.....10 stars+!

I made this recipe for company last Friday and it was wonderful.  I learned to make Tiramisu in Italy from my husband's family and this was every bit as good.  Even better because this recipe cooks the eggs.  I have two hints to pass along.  I increased the coffee to one cup and the rum to 4 tablespoons.  Also, I did not split the ladyfingers.  I put the coffee/rum mixture in a shallow container and then quickly dunked both sides of the ladyfingers in the mixture.  I'm looking forward to making this recipe again, soon!

I LOVE this recipe!  Originally, I was quite disappointed.  Shortly after making it, I had a piece and decided it wasn't worth the cost of the ingredients or the time it took to find them.  However, when I went back to it a day or two later...HEAVEN!  I've made it three times since (all in the last month) and I always make it two days before I need it or plan to eat it.  It's one of those recipes that needs to sit a while.  I use more vanilla, equal parts of coffee and brandy (and more than the recipe calls for), and I've even made it with pound cake when the local bakery/deli is out of ladyfingers...it's just as good and much cheaper!

Positively the best Tiramisu recipe ever but with adjustments!!  I took a long time reading the reviews and agreed with
most of the suggestions.  This is what I did and it turned out brilliantly.
1. I used a 9" springform cake tin and lined the outside with dry sponge fingers sugar side out cut to level of the tin. Bit fiddly but the shape can be perfected once you start putting in the filling.
2. Savoiardi biscuits are the best quality, but any supermarket sponge fingers will do. To use up leftovers I used a mixture of both. For three layers you need 2 or 3 packets especially if using a springform tin.
3. Agree egg/sugar/milk mixture must be stirred constantly whilst cooking to a nice thick consistency.  Also stirred it twice while cooling. You should end up with thick yellow custard.
4. As suggested, I added a little sugar (level dessertsp.)to whipped cream and vanilla mix. 
5. I folded the mascarpone mix and cream mix together.
6. Agree you need to treble the amount of coffee and rum.  Rum is best of all in my opinion to get a good balance of flavours. 
7. I mix rum/coffee in shallow dish and then with a sponge finger in each hand I dip, flip and out. This takes a second or two and just colours the fingers on either side. Do not soak them or you will end up with a mush!! Do a couple at a time and put sugar side down in base of tin to form complete layer. Totally unnecessary to split fingers.
8. I put a third of the mascarpone mix over the top of base fingers and sprinkled

I am not a Tiramisu fan but apparently this recipe was outstanding.  I did double up on the coffee and instead of rum I used Kahlua (which I doubled also).  I used a pastry brush and  brushed the coffee onto the lady fingers.  I also whipped the egg whites and added them to the cheese mixture.  Makes it very fluffy.  Definately let it sit for 24 hours.  The flavors really blend in.   Don't forget to sprinkle your cocoa on just before serving or it will get soggy.  I also added some strawberry chocolate shavings on top of the cocoa.  Looked really good.

Wow! I made it yesterday for Thanksgiving and all our picky eaters loved it!It was the hit of our dessert table - Now I will be making for Xmas too! It really tasted like it was from my favorite Italian restaraunt!

I read all the tips and suggestions for this recipes -following is what worked (and didn't work)for me:
- made it 2 days ahead worked great
- added more coffe and Rum ( 1 cup strong coffe and 4 table spoons rum) this worked perfect!
- tried quickly dunking ladie fingers vs drizzling was a disaster! I tried quickly doing this with the liquid spread out, but it absorbed up almost all of the liquid after just a few ladie fingers, so I would reccomend the drizzle method which worked just fine.

Thanks for this great recipe!

Very good but MUST double the expresso and liquor. I will make this again. I decided for presentation sake to make it in a cheesecake pan. Before serving remove the sides of the pan and transfer (with bottom of cheeseake pan) to a pretty serving dish and hide the edges of the pan with sliced strawberries.

This was my first Tiramisu attempt and I got raves - no reason to ever order it out again.  I made it in a trifle dish so it was 3 layers of each.  I also soaked the lady fingers.  Also somewhere in the middle I shaved some dark chocolate - also on the top.  If you want to split the recipe into a few smaller tasks, I made the cheese mixture 3 days in advance and rest 2 days before serving.  It worked out well and lighted the load.  Will definately make this again.

I've made this several times! Truly easy --it's become my bread and butter. Awesome reviews. I never use Rum though.  Tip: 1. Don't change the amount of sugar. 2. Keep stirring the yolk mixture over the stove till the sugar has melted. Don't refrigerate the yolk mixture after it's been cooked. Instead... 3. Stir in the room temperature Mascarpone cheese into the hot yolk mixture so that it will melt easier and it won't be lumpy. 4. Stir the semi whipped cream into the yolk mixture. 5. Don't dip both sides of the lady fingers. It makes the Tiramisu runny. Yuck. (This can be made with both types of lady fingers.) 6. Sieve the cocoa on top the Tiramisu when it is ready to be served, otherwise the cocoa will get moist and won't be as pretty. 7. Refrigerate for 48 hours for best results. Make this ahead and you won't regret it!

I found this recipe about a 1 1/2 years ago when I was pregnant. I got tired of craving it constantly and paying Italian restaurants $6 a piece just to satisfy my cravings... So I hunted down all of the ingredients. I also read the reviews on here and one said to mix the mascarpone mixture with whipped cream, so I did and every time it turns out perfect. I ALWAYS make tons of the coffee/espresso mixture because there is never enough, I make about 4 to 5 cups of it. And I either use Trader Vicks coffee liquor or Khalua. I made a version tonight for my MIL who doesn't drink coffee with DARK hot chocolate mix (5 packs), 1/2 C. of regular baking cocoa, 1/2 cup of Godiva Choc. liquor and 5 cups of HOT water. Turns out great for those who aren't into coffee. As for the lady fingers some people say to barely dip and others say dunk. I think that depends on how much you like the flavor of coffee. I dunk mine all the way in because I love coffee. I also use hard lady fingers. And another good trick so the cake comes out nice and formed is to really pack the lady fingers in tight, after they have sat a bit in the pan they will be soggy, slide them over and squeeze one more in. When you slice it it will come out very nice looking. And the egg mixture, make sure you beat the yolks, sugar, and milk together well (electric mixer is best) BEFORE you turn on the burner. It will be smoother. And try to let the cake sit for AT LEAST 24 hours before you eat it! The longer it sits, the better.

Pretty easy recipe and tastes GREAT!  However the directions are very vague when it comes to mixing the egg yolks with the sugar and milk.  After ruining the custard on the first attempt I retried it using an electric mixer to incorporate the sugar (until it turned a light yellow) and then I added the milk gradually (also using the mixer) before cooking it on the stove...PERFECT and extremely smooth custard.  Excellent recipe...will definitely make again!  Thanks Christine

I don't know if its that I don't like tiramisu enough, or if I did something wrong with the recipe, but I was a bit disappointed with how this turned out. It was a lot of work and the flavor of it wasn't all that great, even after letting it sit in the fridge for 24 hours. It wasn't sweet enough for me, so if I do make this again, I'll definitely add more sugar. It did make for a beautiful presentation though! Thanks for posting the recipe!

This tiramisu is delicious. I've made this three times now, and I have noticed a few items that you might appreciate:  1) Your custard/zabaglione will not set up after "a minute" of gentle boiling. You will have to watch for the change in color and consistency to get it right. 2) My "gentle boiling" does not go over well without a ban marie. 3) If you accidentally buy hard lady fingers, just soak them in a bit of extra liqueur/coffee, and they'll be fine (and, as far as I'm concerned, they'll be better). Don't let them get to the point where they are falling apart or dripping liquid. 4) The completed tiramisu needs to be chilled for at least a few hours. Preferably, it should chill overnight. 5) IF YOU WANT TIRAMISU, but you happen to be short on the mascarpone cheese, then you have to go and get MORE mascarpone cheese. If you want CHEESECAKE, then you can be lazy or cheap and use the cream cheese/sour cream substitute that you can find on the internet. That substitute makes this recipe taste a lot like cheesecake. Trust me, there are easier recipes for cheesecake out there.

Okay first of all i have to admit I substituted a lot of things, but it still came out spectacular. Everyone LOVED this dessert though they all said they´ve never had tiramisu like this one so I don´t know if what I made cann even be called that. I subbed mascarpone cheese with 2pckgs cream cheese, 3 tbsp sour cream and a bit vanilla. I subbed the ladyfingers with plain poundcake. And I didn´t have rum for the coffee mixture so I used brandy instead. Oh, I also added a hint of cinnamon to the brewed coffee. And yes, you have to double the coffee mixture recipe. And MANDATORY refrigerate 48 hours. Sprinkle cocoa just before serving. WOW!!

Delicious and very easy to make! This was a hit at home and work alike. My supervisor's wife who is an absolutely wonderful cook, had tried a few tiramisu recipes in the past, but found my tiramisu to be the best and wanted the recipe. Here are the variations I incorporated from the other reviews: 1)1c coffee, 4 tbsp rum 2)Added a tbsp of sugar to the cream and vanilla 3)Folded the cream mixture with the custard (so, just had one filling instead of two) 4)Whisk yolk mixture every 15 minutes while it is cooling in the fridge. 5)Use pastry brush to thoroughly soak lady fingers with coffee mixture. 6)Let it sit for 2 days before serving. 7)Sprinkle cocoa powder once it is set, so that it doesn't get soggy even if you don't eat it all the same day.

Fantastic my friend, first time making it and it was wonderful. Tasting it one would imagine it was a very difficult recipe, however anyone can do it, I am no pro chef, just a guy with a love for cooking and I would say I nailed this one on my first try!  (My Back) *Pat Pat*

Fantastic tiramisu recipe, I can't go anywhere without this dessert request!!  This one caught my eye b/c you cook the eggs vs. using raw eggs like the traditional recipe. Do as others suggested, double or triple the coffee/rum mixture.  Important to constantly stir the egg mixture while heating.  Add a little bit (1-2 tsp) of sugar to the whipped cream. I always use the hard ladyfingers and really can't split them so be careful if you use the 7x11 pan with them; mixture will overflow so adjust the recipe accordingly or use a bigger pan. (Don't want to waste the yummy mascarpone mixture!!). Best to let it set for 48 hours.  Lastly, don't sprinkle the cocoa powder until you are ready to serve it, otherwise it gets soggy if you put it on while it's chilling.

I've been cooking for 40+ years and I made this yesterday.   I made it exact to the recipe, with the exception of mixing all the fillings together prior to putting it all together.   There is no need to have the whipped cream layer separate to the custard layer, it just makes it more time consuming in putting it together.  I thought the dish was to die for and it was not too sweet or lacking in coffee flavor.  However, as others suggested, I agree that doubling the coffee/rum to at least  1/2 cup next time would have been a little bit better.  Not because the ladyfingers need so much soaking as they get soft from setting for 24 hours between the custard layers anyway.
There is a huge difference in flavor between marscapone cheese and cream cheese, and unless you want cheesecake flavor, use the mascarpone, which is richer and more like a heavy cream  taste.  Cream cheese has a more distinct flavor no matter what you add to it, whereas the mascarpone takes on the flavors you add as the distinct flavor.  Spend the extra few dollars and get the real thing.  Whisk the egg yolks, sugar, and milk over medium heat and continue after it starts to boil for 1 to 2 minutes.  It will not be as thick as pudding, but after it is refrigerated for an hour it is the perfect texture when you then mix it all together.  I don't know how the person who said they went through a bunch of egg yolks because they kept cooking.  If you do as directed it doesn't happen.

I made this recipe to wow my girlfriend on Valentine's Day, and it was a hit! I took note of the suggestions in the reviews, namely to prepare the tiramisu at least 2 days in advance; and to double or even triple the coffee/rum mix (I used espresso and dark rum) as the lady's fingers will really soak up the juice.  One problem I faced was with whipping the cream and vanilla mix to the proper stiffness. Just make sure you don't overwhip it; the peaks should be stiff enough to stand when you stop whipping, but when you see white chunks floating in liquid, you know you've whipped it too much.  Anyway, it tasted DELICIOUS. I'll definitely be making this again sometime.

The problem with this recipe is that there is no direction on what to do with the egg whites...also a Double boiler should be used so that the eggs do not end up scrambled...these two details I found out AFTER. I called my mother who said that a double boiler must be used to make the custard and the the egg whites should be whipped until stiff and folded into the egg custard as the very last step. I think that the overall flavor of this recipe will be good when I re-do it but this time it had a strange consistency with the egg cooking the way it did. I also added some powdered sugar to the whipping cream to sweeten it up a little bit but I would add just a little more sugar and some vanilla to the custard as well.

First off, let me just say that I absolutely hate rum, but this gave it an entirely new meaning.

I made this for my husband's early Father's Day dinner (his favorite dessert) and he rated it as a tie for the best he's ever had. My son scarfed it down in minutes and I even had seconds.

This recipe is so easy to follow and, after following the advice of others, had BARELY enough liquid to use with my lady fingers.

You have to double the amount of coffee and don't skimp. I had 3/4 of a cup and I literally ran out. That 1/4 cup would have made a huge difference. I used rum extract instead since I won't buy rum and it was waaay overkill (about 1 1/2 tablespoons overkill). I used way too much and unfortunately the bottom layer of lady fingers were lushes and absorbed it all. So, use the required amount of rum or rum extract! I could have used more coffee than rum flavor in mine as well, but that must be due to my crazy rum pouring. 

LET IT SIT FOR AT LEAST 2 DAYS! The marscapone cheese mixture was bland when I first tried it but when it sat put together in the back of my fridge for 2 days, angels sang. It needs to marinate and have time to absorb all together. Otherwise, you'll just be eating sweet cheese, unflavored whipped cream, and caribbean coffee soaked cake; not tiramisu.

This is the absolutely best thing I have put in my mouth in years. I will be trying this again in about a month and I guarantee you, it will be twice as better...and less drunk.

Very Good!! I love tiramisu... but I always hated the "raw" egg part!! This is a wonderful recipe.. I used a double boiler to cook the egg/sugar/milk mix.Used "savoiardi", I live in Italy so they're easy to find...I also used "marsala al uovo" which is a liquer for desserts instead of coffee...just great!!!

I doesn't get better than this folks! I am a HUGE tiramisu fan and this is better than any I have ever tasted, and I've had tiramisu in Italy!

I also doubled the rum and used 1 cup of coffee. I used a pastry brush to add this mixture to the lady fingers (worked great!) and I gently folded the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture - heavenly!! And yes, it is a MUST that you not serve this the day you make it. It has to be served a day or two later which is perfect for a holiday dessert - it's done and out of the way so you can concentrate on the meal, then wow your guests with this amazing dessert they never even saw you make!

The only thing I will say is that this packs a wallop calorie-wise. It's a dessert, so of course it has lots of calories, but just beware the calorie to serving ratio. 12 servings from a 7X11 dish makes for very tiny portions. You will probably eat a piece twice that size, so the calories will double also.

Won't stop me from eating this luscious dessert, but it does make me mindful of the rest of my calorie intake for that day.

Enjoy! You won't be sorry you made this dessert!

My advice, remain calm. It will not only work out, but in fine fashion. A fine dish worthy of the time and expense.   Two days before an employment gathering, I made not one, but two Tiramisu II in trifle dishes. As I was whipping the cream, I panicked. Stiff peaks? There were no stiff peaks, let alone slightly firm bumps. I continued beating and whipping and nothing, it was as though I was stirring milk. The trick is to keep beating. It will happen...eventually.   As for the many who suggested doubling the coffee mixture, I wholeheartedly agree. The benefit to using a trifle dish is that after you quickly dip the lady fingers in the coffee mixture and stand them vertically in the dish along the sides, the excess liquid will pool at the center, where it can be dabbed out with a paper towel.   I simply layered the cream, Mascarpone mixture and lady fingers in the middle of the dish, with additional fingers composing the 'walls' of the dish. Instead of using cocoa powder, I shaved a Dove dark chocolate candy on each layer. After the last layer, I scraped curls of dark chocolate on the top, then placed tiny stars of the remainder of the whipped cream between the tops of each lady finger. It looked stunning!  Another vote for mixing well. One doesn't want lumps in a luscious dish like this!  Make two days in advance, this is very important to give the flavors a chance to settle in to become extra delicious.

Fantastic recipe! Brought it to a family gathering and got raves. I did make a couple of changes - I used espresso rather than coffee and used Kahlua for the liquor. I had the soft kind of ladyfingers and found that brushing them generously with the mixture worked well. I would recommend letting this sit for at least 24 hours for the best flavor. I lightly dusted mine with a cinnamon/cocoa powder mixture just before serving.

Made this for my girlfriend for her B-day as a surprise, huge hit! She's a tiramisu lover and said it was the best she's ever had.
What worked for me:
1. Hard lady fingers, ordered from Amazon
2. Doubled coffee / Kahlua mix (Starbucks coffee w/ a shot of espresso added), mixed together and divided in half, used small cup to drizzle halves evenly over ladyfingers layers (2 layers)
3. Used a whisk and mixed eggs & sugar together first, then added milk and set electric stove on '4', slowly stirred until a soft boil - took about 5 minutes, then boiled for about a minute while still stirring.
4. After chilling and adding mascarpone, custard still had very small sugar/egg lumps - other reviews were correct, don't worry about this - after chilling for 2 days it was smooth as butter.
5. Added about a tablespoon of sugar to whipped cream. Used an electric hand mixer to whip the cream. Mixed approx 2/3rds of whipped cream with the mascarpone custard and saved the rest for a light whipped cream only layer on top. That worked really well.
6. I used a rectangular spring form and lined the sides with Pirouline dark chocolate rolled wafers that I had cut to various lengths (uploaded a pic), this was the hardest part actually - getting all that to stay in place with the bottom layer of ladyfingers cut and shaped to fit in tightly. Tasted great and looked awesome.
7. Lightly dusted top w/ cocoa and added strawberry slices with shaved dark chocolate. Great flavor combo w/ the rest!

This is absolutely the real deal. Having worked in an authentic, family-owned Italian restaurant as a teenager, I know what tiramisu should taste like, and this is it! The chef at the restaurant always soaked each ladyfinger (not split) individually, rather than drizzling the coffee over them. That was the only thing I did differently - otherwise, I followed everything to a T (and yes, soaking them the way I did meant that I needed more coffee). I recommend using espresso for maximum taste. I agree that this must chill for AT LEAST 24 hours. If you're making it for a special occasion, make it 48 hours in advance and prepare to blow everyone away. And don't be alarmed if it is a little 'soggy' - your custard should be firm (you should be able to cut a solid piece and have it stay together), but tiramisu should be a little soggy! In my opinion. :) If you love tiramisu, give this recipe a try. It's incredibly easy and absolutely delicious!

Best Tiramisu EVER...light and flavorful. The 1/4 cup of espresso is not enough, it needs at least 1-1.5 cups of instant espresso ( I would rather have more than I need when assembling the dessert than run out midway through and have to make more and wait for it to cool). My family wanted a little more sweetness so I added a tablespoon of sugar to the whipped cream band that did the trick ( I have made 3 batches of this recepie tweaking each time which is what I am summarizing in this review)I also folded the whipped cream into the mascarpone cream, and did not layer the mascarpone and whipped cream as the recipie calls for. Whipped cream will deflate and turn watery after a while ruining the dessert. I also recommend leaving in fridge for 24hrs before eating' this recipient gets better with age:-)

Really good, but definitely needed to follow others' advice. I've never made tiramisu before, and while it tasted great, it came out a bit soggy. Dipping the ladyfingers (Savoiardi brand) soaked up too much coffee, so next time I'll have to brush it on or drizzle. I was worried they'd be too crunchy if I didn't dip them, but I was wrong!
I didn't have rum, so I substituted Drambuie, and doubled the coffee/alcohol mixture. I also used chocolate milk instead of white, though I'm not sure the difference is even noticeable. 
Will definitely make this again!

Somehow tasted a bit bland to me, even after spending the night in the fridge, but it is probably because I omitted the rum.  I will definitely make it again, using rum, or marsala wine. Make sure you whisk the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer until they are light yellow before you boil them. Also, double your espresso mixture! Had I only made the 1/4 cup I don't think it would have been enough. Update: After two days in the fridge the taste improved considerably and got rave reviews- people were telling me i need to open a bakery!

5 stars because no first time tiramisu should EVER taste that good. I just created something that is way beyond my pastry-making abilities. Cosmic imbalance might ensue.  Do fold the whipped cream into the cheese mixture and double the coffee/liquor like most other reviewers suggested.   If you have any doubts about making this, don't. It's worth it. Just make sure you have enough people around to eat it, or you might end up putting on a a pound or five.

This is an incredibly easy dessert that tastes and looks like it was much more difficult to make.  It is very important to let it set in the refrigerator for the time stated to allow the coffee flavor to mix with the ladyfingers and the filling. Otherwise the filling will not be sweet enough! I generously drizzled the coffee on the ladyfingers because I found that if I soaked them, they fell apart. I also used a spring form pan lining the sides with the ladyfingers which made a beautiful presentation.  Your friends are sure to be impressed with this one!

Perfect. I've made this many times for company and everyone always raves about it. I like to line the rim of the glass container I'm using with strawberry slices. I use a little extra rum (or Kahlua, whatever I have on hand)and definitely need to double the expresso/rum mixture. I also make is 2-3 days in advance and use the soft lady fingers rather than the crunchy ones.

This was my first attempt at making this desert and it was great. I made it in a 13x9 pan, used 3 packages of lady fingers  and followed others' advice to use 8oz marscapone & 8oz cream cheese (diluted with a bit of cream only), I folded the whipped cream into the cheese mixture. I used Kahlua and rum...more than suggested by others! Delish!
A word of advice from a French master pastry chef's daughter to those of you who end up with watery, flat whipped cream: Use a brand with CREAM only (no carrageenan) with at least 36% butterfat.

Huge success anytime I make this. It is also great to be able to make it ahead.  I usually double the amount of coffee but that is definitely a personal preference.  
This is not a super sweet dish but it is my dad's favorite.  He has a serious sweet tooth so I add sugar to the whipped cream when I make it for dad.

Wow...really, really tasty!  Made this 2 days before serving to allow flavors to come together.  I made this in a springform pan.  I lined the sides of the pan with parchement paper, so that the cream wouldn't stick to the sides.  Just before serving, I pull the paper away to reveal a perfect round cake...it was super easy for cutting and looked better for my entertaining purposes.  I too (like the other reviewers) doubled the coffee/rum  mixture.  Do use the hard ladyfingers with no worries...once they are (quickly) dunked in coffee mixture  then layered with cream they will soften!    My Italian friends agreed that this was as authentic as Tiramisu gets...not overly sweet but good coffee flavor.  Will definitely try again!

Very easy recipe. I made some changes to reduce the fat and cholesterol and it still tasted great and lighter. Ladies...there's is about 6g of fat per tbsp marcaspone cheese and probably the same in the heavy whipping cream! My lower cal version cuts down at least half the fat:
-1 C coffee + 8 tsp rum
-Mix 3 egg yolks, 1/2 c sugar, 2 c milk, 1 tablesp flour; cook & stir until thicken, add 1 tsp vanilla
-8 0z marcaspone , 8 oz cool whip, mix with chilled custard

This was amazing! I’m normally not a big fan of Tiramisu, but my mom loves it so I decided to make this for her and I’m glad I did!  I tripled the coffee/rum mixture because I think that’s where the flavor of the cake really comes from.  Also make sure to stir the egg mixture CONSTANTLY!!! while its cooking.  If you stop stirring it will clump together and you’ll have sugary scrambled eggs.  I stopped stirring for just a tiny moment and had to strain the lumps out.

Tried this recipe and found it to be absolutely delicious!  I will, however, double the coffee and rum the next time I make it.  It just needs a little more of the coffee flavor, but overall, this is the best tiramisu I've ever tasted.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made this tiramisu for a family/friend get-together, where there were more than a few "food snobs". It was such a HUGE hit, I was asked to make this every year as a new menu staple. Relatively easy preparation, attractive presentation, and DELICIOUS! Thanks for the recipe!

Okay, so after 4 times making the cake (at least 1 &1/2 time failed) here some of my lessons: reduce the milk, too much milk will make the cheese mixture soft and not good to hold the shape. Put the cheese out of the fridge until room temperature- so it wouldn't create lump. Bake the ladyfingers at 250 for 5-7 mins so it would stay harder and not soggy when you try to dip into the coffee. And most important, let the cake stays on the fridge at least 12 hours. The longer it stays, the stronger the shape and the tastier it is. You can also sprinkle another cocoa cover after the first layer.  I'm a guy and I make this for my birthday as well as 2 of my friends'. The cake quickly went out in 30 minutes- enough said!

This recipe was well-rated, so I gave it a try. Fantastic! Sooo easy too. A couple adjustments however: I followed several reviewers advice and tripled both the coffee and the booze (I used kahlua for booze and espresso for coffee). This is a lot of the flavour and since the lady fingers absorb it all so quickly it is very important to have plenty of coffee/booze. Also, try and have the mascarpone at room temperature before mixing in...otherwise it'll likely be lumpy. Other than that, great recipe! Will definitely make again.

This is one of my favorite desserts, but I've made modifications.  First, I double the amount of coffee & rum.  I also double the amount of vanilla in the whipped cream & I sprinkle cocoa on both layers.  There is a reason this recipe gets 5 stars.  It is DIVINE!

simply fantastic! My daughter has been bugging me for years to make Tiramisu. I have been hesitant since I don't like coffee, and it seemed like a LOT of work. Tiramisu IS a lot of work, but this recipe is totally worth it! I used the ladyfinger recipe from this website and made them into two 8" round cakes. I was short on time so I popped it in the freezer for a couple of hours to cool it down quicker. This is my daughter's favorite dessert. I made her so happy for her graduation party!
UPDATE: I made this again for my daughter's birthday, but this time I used Kalua and made individual servings using small juice glasses.  I used the ladyfingers recipe from this website, and poured the dough onto an airbake cookie sheet covered with parchment paper. I only baked them for 10 minutes and used the juice glass to cut out individual rounds of the ladyfinger cake so I could layer them with the whipping cream and custard into the individual glasses. Once assembled, I popped them into the freezer. This worked out PERFECTLY!!! Once again, I got RAVE reviews!!!

It got 5 stars from my guests, also.  I made this following the recipe except that I wound up doubling the amount of rum and coffee because I ran out before I was finished brushing it on the ladyfingers. I would suggest making it as written and using all that on the first layer, then mixing another 4 T. coffee with 2 more T. of rum for the second layer of ladyfingers.  I used the recipe for ladyfingers from this site.  I was very impressed with the final product.  I made it a day ahead and the flavors had time to meld.

I used this recipe thinking it would be even better than another one I have previously used from Allrecipes. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Tiramisu in my experience has never had two different layers of custard and whipped cream; it has always had the whipped cream folded into the custard part which combines the two flavors better I feel. Furthermore, the amount of coffee this calls for is much too little, I used almost a cup of a coffee and Kahlua mixture. It is good, but not nearly as good as tiramisu could and should be, and does not deserve five stars to say the least.

Coming from a genuine Italian family, older gen born there, this was excellent. My moms recipe required uncooked eggs and these days people dont like doing that anymore. I tried this recipe for the first time this Christmas and my family was floored. I changed a couple of things but mostly what the other reviewers did. I made a full cup of espresso and added 4 TBS of Frangelica liquor and 2 TBS of Kamora coffee liquor. I mixed the 2 fillings together gently folded into each other. I also dipped the lady fingers lenghtwise in coffee mix but only one half the other half facing up I spread the cream mixes. This allows the two flavors to meld but not concentrated in one spot. There are two true chefs in my family and I truly recommend this recipe and do make it a couple days before like everyone said. Enjoy! Also try to find the Savoiradi lady fingers if possible, I think these taste and work best.

I made this for my sis in laws b-day, and she loved it! The only thing is I would half the liquer that is used if serving to people how dont really like the taste. I used kalula instead of rum. I also used cool whip instead of making my own whipped cream. Doing this ommites and extra step and tasted just as good. I also used the hard lady figures instead of the soft, the soak up a lot of the coffe mix so be careful or else you end up with mush (but it still tasted great!).

Tried this recipe a few days ago! I loved it and my whole family loved it! I took  alot of tips from everyone one else and  1. Double the coffee/rum 2. I used the hard lady fingers and they were just perfect for me 3. Add a 1-2 tablespoon of sugar to the coffee cause its a bit to bitter 4. Seriously for the best flavor wait 2 days to eat it first day you might bedissapointed but on that 2 day the flavors where amazing^_^  5. Add bout a teaspoon of sugar to the whipped cream 6. Let the cheese be room tempature it will make it easier to mix and finnally 7. The cocoa makes the difference get a sifter and put it i between your layers! It makes it amazing and very geriously but for the top add it on the day you will be serving! but over all this was amazing just wait the 2 days you will love it!

Delicious!! I've had this recipe in my recipe box for months, just waiting for a reason to make it and Christmas was the occasion I was looking for.  I made it 2 and a half days in advance per reviewers' suggestions and it turned out perfect- just as good, if not better than at my favorite restaurant.  I found the mascarpone cheese in the deli's section of imported cheeses at my local grocery store and used the "hard" lady fingers since that was all I could find.  I was nervous about using those after reading multiple reviews saying to only use the soft ones but they are wrong!  The hard lady fingers soaked up the coffee/liquor mixture and turned very soft (even the parts that weren't soggy were soft).  Everyone loved this dessert and it was much easier to make than I expected.  I also made it in a trifle dish and it turned out really pretty.

This is THE tiramisu recipe to go for - as good or better than many I have had in excellent restaurants.  I did make a change or two.  1: I doubled the amount of espresso that I used.  2: I used Kahlua instead of rum.  IT was delicious.  Definitely leave it for at least 24 hours and don't be too worried about using another kind of sponge cake if you cannot find ladyfingers.  I would however be wary of substituting mascarpone with cream cheese, though admittedly I have not done it.

Great recipe! The balance of the flavor of ingredients is perfect. I did double the amount of espresso and used Borghetti Italian coffee liquor in place of the rum. We live in Germany and have an awesome Italian supermarket close to us so all of the ingredients were very readily available. Definitely use the hard ladyfingers...They don't even make the soft variety in Italy. You will not get crunchy ladyfingers as long as you let the tiramisu "marinate " for at least 24 hours. Thanks so much for this DEVINE recipe!

Delicious recipe for tiramisu! It came out a lot like restaurant tiramisu. You will need to make a lot more of the coffee/rum mixture than the recipe calls for, though.

Unbelievable! This is the dessert I make when I want to impress, but best after a light meal, or served later in the evening - its rich! For sure, double up the coffee/rum mixture and prepare at LEAST one day in advance. The coffee/rum mixture tastes pretty bad alone until it has had time to permeate the whole! Also, I cut some ladyfingers in half and stand them up on their cut ends all around the outside - looks pretty and adds more surface area for the coffee rum!

I made this recipe twice in 2 weeks since I found it...people advising me to start a bakery now...it was so good...
as advised by other reviewers, definitely increase the coffee liquor mixture, also I added 2 teaspoons sugar while whipping the cream and vanilla together to add a little sweetness to it...
otherwise its soooo good :)

Very nice. I followed recipe exactly, except I doubled the rum/coffee. Very expensive recipe -- I won't be in a hurry to make this one again! I just used the standard "hard" ladyfinger cookies, which worked fine.

Followed recipe as stated to make birthday cake...doubled the coffee mixture and had plenty. Used Trader Joe's soft ladyfingers. Made the custard two days in advance and put it together 24 hours before the party. It was delish!

A wonderful tiramisu! I looked high and low for a 7x11 inch cake pan and used a 9x11. For the first layer of ladyfingers, I followed another members suggestion and drizzled the coffee mixture-don't do this, dunk them in the bowl! I subsituted Kahula for the Rum. The one problem I had was the whipping cream, I think I had to triple it, 1 1/4 cups heavy cream is not anywhere near the amount needed for two layers!

Great recipe!  I am a very picky Tiramisu eater and this was great.  I used Kahlua instead, and lots of it.  I don't have an espresso machine so I just used espresso grinds in a regular coffee machine.  I also sifted a little unsweetened cocoa powder between layers and added a little on top, it made the presentation nicer and complimented the coffee flavor nicely.

This is a great classic recipe and really makes a wonderful tiramisu. The only problem I saw was that the Tiramisu really has to sit longer then then even 5 hours for the taste to really be there. I'd recommend keeping it in the fridge overnight! Also, I needed more espresso then what the recipe called for. I ended up lightly dipping each ladyfinger in the coffee instead of drizzling. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

I love Tiramisu and this is my favorite.
I've used this recipe several times already, and every time comes out wonderfully.I double up the espresso and rum. Driggle the coffee mixture over the dry lady fingers. I use as much cocoa power to cover the entire surface, which is probably more than 1 Tbs. One time I put a cover while refregilating, and the cocoa power got too wet. I guess I did not wait the egg mixture to cool down long enough. Taste the same, but it did not look as good. I would leave the cover off for the first few hours.

I love this recipe!  The only thing I changed was I used Brandy instead (the italian market where I purchased the ladyfingers suggested it).  I put the coffee mixture in a shallow dish (I used an old pie tin) and quickly rolled the ladyfingers in the mixture instead of sprinkling it on.  Also be sure to use the hard ladyfingers!  It came out excellent and I always get asked to make it!!

Tiramisu is my favorite dessert, and this is an excellent recipe.  I've never made it before, but found this recipe quite easy.  I doubled the coffee and rum, and I used a pastry brush to soak it into the ladyfingers as I layered them.  I'm having a hard time staying away from it!

I chose this recipe because the eggs are cooked (raw eggs make me nervous).  I have made this recipe twice and received rave reviews.  Pretty easy to assemble and looks impressive when you are done.

Here's what I don't understand. Why does it not tell you at add sugar to the whip cream? Now fortunately I was smart enough to add the sugar to the whip cream anyways. I'm unsure as to why you'd have to cut the lady fingers in half, or why you would just drizzle them with the coffee. I recommend making double the amount of coffee, and not cutting the lady fingers in half. If you cut them in half it makes the whole dish just a custard mess. This doesn't come close to the tiramisu dishes I have had in the past. I recommend staying away from this recipe and venturing elsewhere for a better authentic tiramisu recipe. Nothing about this dish was good.

This is soooo good!!! Let it sit in the fridge 2-3 days before you intend to serve it.  Make sure you use really strong coffee and double if not triple the coffee/rum mixture.  This is THE BEST!!!!

You don't have to refrigerate the yolk mixture before putting the mascarpone in.  In fact, I always [I've made this many times] put the mascarpone in while the yolk mixture is still hot.  It's much easier to mix then.  And then I just let it sit (unrefrigerated) while I prepare the rest of the dessert.  And, yes, agreed, double the rum; & use real espresso.  An hour in the fridge is enough to let it soak a bit, but it definitely tastes better after 24 hours.

Awesome tiramisu! this is just like the high end dinning tiramisu. I made it for a wedding tea and everyone loved it. My mom said that it was great and she thought that she did not like tiramisu. I will make this again and often. thanks for a great recipe

Healthy tip: You will burn about half the calories in this cake if you try to whip the cream by hand. (And wake up with a sore arm the next morning). But it is so worth it.

Tasty!  I cut the recipe in half and made 4 little individual ones in these clear ramikin-type things I have.  I couldn't for the life of me find lady fingers, and the Italian market was closed, so I used pound cake cut into small cubes, and it was still amazing!  I topped it w/the cocoa powder, then i put a little biscotti cookie sticking in the side of the bowl with a fresh strawberry cut and fanned around the cookie.  My hubby and sons loved it!  Thank you!

OKay I just made this exactly by the recipe but I did double the coffee and rum, not sure if this is the dessert for me. I felt like I was eating mouthfuls of whip cream and the taste was bland. I might try this again with a few modifications. I also drizzled the coffe/rum over the ladyfingers and I think next time dunking them would better. This dessert is still in the fridge for the second day so I might try another piece...

Awesome.  Made 2 days prior, used 1/2 c expresso w 1/4 c Kahlua.  Substituted 2 containers of cream cheese, 1/2 c heavy whipping cream and 5 T sour cream for the marscapone.  Added the mascarpone substitute to the egg mixture while they were still warm so they would blend well. This custard was delicious by itself.  Not overly sweet.  So I did not combine it with the whipped cream as some reviews suggest.  Really liked having the custard and whipped cream as separate layers.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This recipe is great!! So rich and delicious!! But I would make a few changes next time I make it. 1.) I added a pinch of salt( to bring out the sweetness) 1 tablespoon of vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon to the custard filling. This improved the flavor alot. 2.) NEEDS MORE COFFEE/chocolate FLAVOR. Don't be afraid to really soak those ladyfingers in coffee. I added about 1 tablespoon of coco powder to my coffee because I like that mocha coffee/chocolate flavor together. Add double the amount of coffee As well. Also I sprinkled coco powder in the middle of the layers. This improved the flavor greatly. 3.) Mine  came out a little runny, the custard didn't set up very  thick. Not thick enoughto cut a perfectly square  slice. Next time I will fold some of the whipped  cream into the custard filling. This will make the  texture better for slicing. Overall with a few changes to add flavor= delish!!!

Turned out great. This was the first time I ever made a Tiramisu, I made it for my husband's birthday. It was a great hit. My only problem was that it took refrigerating over night for it come together; it was jiggly at first. the reason might have been that I used  2%milk! Thanks for sharing.

Perfect recipe first time I made it! Helpful hints in hindsight:  layer lady fingers tightly for a good cakelike layer - drizzle or brush coffee/liquor mix, I dunked and it was too strong IMO - I used espresso and coffee liquor and the flavor was great - when stirring the yoke mix over heat it will rise, make sure pot is large enough to accomodate and mine never boiled for a minute but I did cook and stir for a long while until the mix raised to more than double and was creamy throughout - if whipping cream with whisk mixer it doesn't take long at all, be careful to not over whip!  I WILL MAKE THIS GREAT RECIPE AGAIN!

Thanks to all for the reviews.  I followed many of them with great success.  I used 1 cup strong coffee to 4 Tbsp kahlua. I added 1 Tbsp powdered sugar to the whipped cream mix and used the mixer to whip the cheese into the cream.  I folded the (delicious) custard with the (delicious) whipped cream and cheese, which was delicious by the way. :) I made my own ladyfingers from the recipe on this site which I have found to be more flavorful (if less voluminous) than the storebought.  When making them, I always spread the batter out, bake, and then cut into bars.  It makes it so much easier than piping! That recipe yielded just enough ladyfingers for two layers when layered into a 9" springform pan.  (I did not split them in half.)  I also waited until the last day to sprinkle on the cocoa and made the tiramisu two days in advance.  Since I had turned my ladyfingers upside down and dipped the top third of them in the coffee mix (as opposed to drizzling), I was worried that they might be soggy two days later, but they were not.  This received rave reviews!  Simply superb. Thank you!

This was my first time making tiramisu. I brought it to my boyfriends parents house for a get together with his family. His dad said that I could a win tiramisu contest & even mentioned it again to my boyfriend to tell me that "he was out of tiramisu" (haha). Everyone loved it and was really impressed. Only thing though I added sugar to my whipped cream. And I had to work around food allergies so I made one with strawberries (one layer of strawberries in the middle) and one with chocolate shavings and curls on the top. (see my picture). It was a huge hit!!

Easy to make, nice and creamy.  Made a couple of substitutions: used Kaluha instead of rum, flavored marscapone cheese instead of plain. Result was a very intense coffee/chocolate dessert.

I've made it twice and have found it to be extremely easy and delicious.  The most time consuming part is separating 6 eggs.  I like this recipe better than others because you have three layers; other tiramisu recipes combine the whipped cream with the marscapone layer.  This one is prettier.  And you don't need to use a double boiler with this one!  Also, each time I've made it, I made it the evening before, so it was in my fridge for about 24 hours before serving - that's perfect for letting the flavors really come through.  I also just drizzle the ladyfingers with a strong coffee and kaluha mixture instead of rum and espresso and instead of soaking.

This was wonderful!  I made a few changes to it: Used a combination of chocolate and yellow lady fingers, added 1 cup of melted german chocolate to the marscapone, and upped the coffee/rum to 1 cup coffee and 1/2 cup rum for EACH layer.  Fantastic!

Absolutely fantastic!  Since I can't consume alcohol, I can't eat store-bought tiramisu.  The problem was I loved it.  Now I can make my own and it's safe to say it's the best!  I dropped the rum, got 2 shots of espresso from my favorite coffee shop and added a little bit of water to make it almost 1/2 cup. I used homemade
angelfood cake instead of ladyfingers. The outcome was great!!!

I found this recipe to be excellent and my friends, who had never tried it, loved it.  I did add a layer of biscotti instead of Ladyfingers on the second layer...almond biscotti...excellent!!!

This recipe made me a star ! It was light and not too sweet! I served this at our holiday dinner and it was loved.  Here are my changes:
Timing: Made it 2 days in advance as many reviewers suggested and it was delicious!
Whipped Cream: First, using my electric hand mixer, I beat the cream with vanilla and a pinch of sugar until stiff peaks formed. 
Custard: Next, whisked the yolks, sugar and milk together in a in a saucepan until it was mixed and THEN turned on the heat. Stirred the custard the entire time.  When the custard finished boiling, I removed the pan from the stove. Instead of refrigerating the custard (per the recipe), I immediately added the mascarpone cheese and used the electric mixer to incorporate it into the custard to ensure a silky, smooth, texture with no lumps.
Ladyfingers: The ladyfingers were hard but I had confidence they would soften. I doubled the espresso coffee mixture and used 1/2 cup of coffee and added 4 Tbsp. of Kahlua instead of rum. Next time I make it, I will probably use ¾ cup of coffee and 6 Tbsp. of Kahlua to ensure all the ladyfingers are thoroughly soaked but not mushy.
Building: I didn't have enough ladyfingers to build 2 layers (didn't cut them in half), so only layered everything once: Soaked ladyfingers on the bottom, next added all the custard mixture and then all the whipped cream.  Put plastic on top and into fridge for 2 days. It came out delicious!

Love it! My husband made it for me and it turned out awesome! Best Tiramisu I have ever had. We did make some changes as recommend  by other reviewers. We doubled the coffee and the rum! we also added 1/4 cup sugar to our whipped cream.

Wow! This was my first attempt at a tiramisu and I don't need to ever search for another recipe! I read through many of the reviews and did make some tweaks based on what I had read. Most notably: 1)Make 48 hours ahead. 2)Double the rum and coffee. 3)Use your kitchenaid to mix the yolks, sugar, and then milk. Pour into bowl and set over pot (as a double boiler). STIR CONSTANTLY and even a few times while chilling. I wound up being on the stovetop for 12 minutes. Mine never reached a boil, but I was looking for the change in color and consistency as noted in reviews. It also firms a bit more in the fridge. I used the kitchen aid to beat the ROOM TEMP marscapone into the chilled yolk mixture. 4)My store did not have the soft lady fingers so I wound up using the cookie like 'hard' version, Bellino Savioardi. I used about one and a half 7 ounce packages. I put them under the liquor/coffee mixture and rolled a few times then pulled out. Did not let get soggy, and after the 48 hours  they were all soft and pleasing. I will ONLY use the hard lady fingers now! 5) I used a 10 inch spring form pan, and I added about a tbsp of sugar to the heavy cream. THANKS SO MUCH! AWESOME RECIPE! Update: Made it again 2 weeks later for Christmas Eve and came out the same- wonderful recipe! Everyone raved and there was none left.

This was an easy recipe to follow and it was delicious!  Even better than the Tiramisu from our favorite restaurant.  Next time I'll take the time to brew extra strong coffee so the coffee flavor really shines through.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

I love Tiramisu, but this recipe was not as good as I hoped. There was way too much filling/marscapone-egg yolk mixture for the amount of everything else, and it was very "liquidy." My family thought it was a pudding rather than a Tiramisu. The espresso and rum mixture was delicious, but, like other reviewers, I doubled it. Also, I wasn't sure why one wouldn't have sugar in the whipped cream part. I couldn't find my recipe for Tiramisu that I usually use, but I would not make this one again!

Soooo good. 

I followed the reviewers' comment on how to do it and YES, it got better after 48hours and even better after 4 days in the fridge. 
Hubby and I finished it in a week and the flavour got stronger the longer I keep it in the fridge. 
Oh yes, i didn't use rum, I used Kahlua instead to maximise the coffee-ness of this dish.

Totally did not like the ratio. The cookies needed to be whole and soaked in the coffee/rum mixture. Too much custard and cream for small amount of cookies. Maybe recipe is written wrong :(

This turned out GREAT and was a hit at the party - -kids, adults, non-coffee drinkers.
I used 9x13 dish, and had 14 oz package ladyfingers (didn't use 4 cookies).  Accordingly, I doubled the coffee/liquor amount.  However, there was plenty enough of the zabaglione custard and whipped cream.  
I admit to being a bit extra cautious with the raw egg issue, so kept the egg yolk mix on the double boiler (never boiling it) for nearly 30 minutes.

Easy and DELICIOUS recipe, but a bit time consuming. My boyfriend, friends, and family were so impressed with my potluck contribution. It was such a hit I will be making it again for this weekend! (Tastes better than the ones I've had at Italian restaurants.)


**Recipe Notes/Adjustments**

As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the coffee/rum mixture. 

I left the tiramisu in the fridge, covered, for about 48 hrs to allow all the lovely flavors to marry. Longer, between 48-72 hrs, would have been even better.
 
I must have overcooked the zabaglione (milk, egg, and sugar custard mixture) a bit because it came out lumpy. Per Martha Stewart, I simply put the mixture through a strainer and, voila, out came smooth zabaglione custard. Next time, I'll cook this mixture on medium-low heat. 

I will take the advice from a previous reviewer who suggested adding the mascarpone cheese into the warm zabaglione custard mixture and then leaving the mascarpone-zabaglione mixture in the refrigerator for 1-2 hrs. Mixing these elements while they were cold made it challenging for me to combine them both into a smooth mixture.

Even though I somehow screwed this one up (it was very runny because the filling didn't set right and I can't figure out why), I gave it 5 stars because it tasted SO good! Obviously it was not the recipe's fault that the consistency was off since all of the other reviewers did not seem to have this problem. I'll have to attempt it another time and hopefully it will be solid. But everyone did enjoy my tirami-soup, as I nicknamed it!

This was my first attempt at making Tiramisu, and I have to admit, it turned out pretty well. I've been wanting to make Tiramisu for a while now, and was glad that I found this recipe. I took the advice of the other reviewers and doubled the rum/coffee mixture, but it still wasn't enough. Quadrupling would have been better, and I would have had a better result had I quickly dipped them instead of drizzling the liquid on the cookies. Also, I didn't see the point in splitting the cookies in half. I took the advice of combining the custard with the whipped cream to save a layer, as my pan was quite short. Very good eaten a few hours later, but even better the next day!

"This... is... AMAZING!" is what my (very picky) boyfriend said after his first bite. :D I made this cake for a small gathering with a few friends and they all had seconds and thirds. This tiramisu is just as delicious, if not better, than the one from our favorite (expensive) italian restaurant. This is seriously one of the best desserts I've ever had! And I don't even drink coffee.
.
It requires a bit of work, yes, but it's generally very easy the make. I followed the directions for the most part, but modified one or two things. I mixed in most of the whipped cream with the mascarpone/custard mixture because I thought it was too cheesy otherwise. I made 1.5 cup coffee and used Kahlua instead of rum. I poured 1/4 cup coffee in a small bowl and mixed in 2 tbsps + 1 tsp Kahlua. I soaked in the ladyfingers for around 1 second on each side and poured in more coffee/Kahlua mixture when needed.
.
I only had an 8x8 inch dish, but it worked out perfectly in the end. I left it in the fridge for 48 hours before serving, but I think it would've been good after 24 hours too. Awesome recipe!

Goodness... my husband baked this for the family, and we adored it!  Day three was probably the best, after it had been maturing in the fridge awhile.  When we cut into it, the rum had mostly soaked through the pund cake and gave it terriffic texture.  Delish!

Like other reviewers, I made more of the coffee mixture for dipping...I halved the recipe because I only had an 8oz. tub of mascarpone, and I'd say I had a little over a cup of the dipping mixture, and it was barely enough. I didn't have rum, so I subbed in some Kahlua. YUM. 

That said, this tiramisu is nothing short of spectacular. I wanted to lick the bowl out when I was done eating it.

I made it with Baileys instead of rum... Amazing! Didnt change anything else, just made doble coffee as the other reviews suggested!

This is by far the best Tiramisu recipe I have encountered. I have made this to-die-for tiramisu 3 times since I found the recipe and got rave reviews from my roommates. Just follow the recipe, DOUBLE the rum/coffee mix, and wait for 48 hours before consuming it, then you are guaranteed to experience something of Italian restaurant quality. Love it!

Absolutely perfect and a hit - I used Parvisi cookies instead of ladyfingers and it turned out just as yummy... Recipe is a keeper for sure... Thank you for sharing it with us...

I used 1 c espresso, 1/4 c kahlua, put it in my springform pan, and then added the extra ladyfingers around the edge. I also sprinkled cocoa powder between the whipped cream and ladyfinger layer in the middle of it. I also used a lot more ladyfingers than it called for. I had a 14 oz pkg of the Allesi brand. I used three of the four inner packages.

I have never made(nor had)tiramisu before this recipe. A friend ask if i could make this for his birthday, so i found this recipe and it was a HUGE success!!! I did not use the milk or boil the mix. I looked at 'old/classic'recipes and none of them cooked anything in it.I did everything else just the recipe says and waited 24 hours to serve,the birthday boy loved it,so did my husband and daughter!!

This was great, added sugar to whipping cream and used cream cheese instead of mascarpone cheese, too costly for me.  Didn't use any rum, no reason too.

Tasted great. Next time I make it I think I will fold the whipped cream with the cheese mixture and also dust the lady fingers with cocoa.  I loved this!

WOW!!! And I really mean WOW!!! I cut the recipe to four servings and made it in individual custard cups. One for me, one for my husband, one for each of my two kids. DH and I ate ours while our kids were finishing dinner and decided not to share! 
Sidenote: I didn't have any rum so I sub brandy and it tasted great!
I also used a ladyfinger recipe from this site, they didnt look pretty, but the taste was wonderful.

Loved it! Appreciated that the yolks were cooked since I am pregnant. I doubled or tripled the coffee amount. I also used the marscarpone substitute found on this website since I had a lot of cream cheese on hand. Will be making again!

This is my husbands favorite dessert, so I was terrified of messing it up! It turned out so good, even I liked it (and I'm not a coffee person). At first I attempted to make my own ladyfingers (won't be doing that again!). I found it amazing how the flavor just explodes when you combine the mascarpone & yolk mixture. I will mention you really have to soak the ladyfingers & use a strong coffee to get a strong flavor. I'll definitely make this again!

I used a 13 x 9 baking dish so I bought 3 packages of ladyfinger cookies and used Kahlua instead of rum. I made everything else the same with the exception of the custard. I had to run errands so I left it in the fridge over 4 hours before assembling it. I folded in the whipped cream as recommended by other reviews. I also used 3 times the amount of coffee and liquor. Otherwise, yum!!!! I'm picky and my husband is even worse when it comes to tiramisu and we both are eating through the leftovers like it's the last tiramisu on earth! Thanks for the recipe; no more ordering it at any restaurant. This recipe is better!!!

First time making tiramisu and so glad I chose this recipe. It's awesome! Comes out just like the tiramisu you buy in a restaurant, if not better. Traditionally I think they blend the heavy cream with the egg mixture, but either way it works. The only modification I made was using kahlua instead of rum and adding 1 Tbsp. of powdered sugar to the heavy cream. You will definitely need more than 1/4 cup of coffee. I used about 3/4 cup. Brush it onto the ladyfingers with a pastry brush. (Some recipes tell you to dip the ladyfingers which is not a good idea. They soak up liquid way too quickly.) Again, this is a great recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe that will leave everyone wanting more. It rivals the best restaurant recipe. As others have mentioned, more liquid is necessary to soak the ladyfingers. Since I don't wish to use alcohol in my tiramisu I have found that using a "tall" truffle double espresso from Starbucks for the liquid portion is unbelievably delicious. I don't know how it could get any better.

This turned out wonderful! I just wanted to make a note for anyone who cannot find the soft lady fingers (I went to 6 different grocery stores only to find the hard ones). I made mine in a springform pan and lined the outer edge with Madelines (found these at Trader Joe's). They're a soft cookie shaped like a shell almost. 
Then I used the hard lady fingers and soaked the first batch in the rum/coffee combo, lined the bottom, did the layers and then did the lady fingers in another batch of rum/coffee mixture. Essentially doubling the rum/coffee, only doing it in two seperate batches. It turned out beautifully with the Madelines around the outside, and the flavor of the Tiramisu - perfect!

Absolutely delicious!  Guaranteed crowd-pleaser!  A couple of suggestions:
1) Definitely up the amount of coffee/rum for the ladyfingers.
2) Definitely make this two days in advance.  I've made it the day of, the day before, and I think two is the magic number (though it seems to taste so good in the days following too!).
3) I'd wait until the day of to sprinkle the cocoa on top, otherwise it gets soaked up by the cream and turns into a dark color.

Great Dessert! Try combining some of the coffee/rum mixture into the marscopone/egg mixture instead of just drizzling it on the lady fingers. I found that this adds much more flavor to the dessert, and also it is not necessary to wait 24 hours to serve it. 
Delicious!

I, as well, have never made tiramisu and am not much of a baker, so I was nervous to serve it at an Italian-themed Christmas party. It was great. It was easy to make and I served it about 24 hours after I made it. I doubled the coffee but kept the 2 T. of liquor (I used brandy). I also sprinkled cocoa after the first layer. This one is a winner. Thanks!

Great recipe. As earlier reviewers said, it's necessary to refridgerate at least a day in advance to meld flavors. Also, I suggest tripling the amount of coffee and rum and making the coffee very, very, very strong.

Good dessert. Make sure that if you don't use this sized pan that you don't run out of lady fingers. I like more layers than just the two so I added more. I took others' advice and double the coffee and the rum- great flavor. Will make again.

I made this for my husband on Valentine's Day. It was pretty good but I think it needs more than 1/4 cup of coffee and rum, it was difficult to make it extend over two packages of the landfingers. Overall pretty good.

Great recipe, but the real genius comes from fellow reviewers! I followed the modifications of other reviewers like so:

1. Triple the coffee-liquor ratio to 3/4 cup coffee and 6 tb kahlua.
2. Really pack as many soaked ladyfingers as possible into the baking tin. Makes a nice, dense, and even layer of soaked cookies.
3. For the custard: Beat eggs yolks and sugar together until well combined and mixture has turned a pale yellow AND THEN stream in the milk. Combine well before cooking. Stir  mixture continuously during cooking and several times while cooling. Strain custard after cooling to remove any leftover clumps (yuck!).
4. Fold whipped cream (add 1 tb sugar) into egg mixture.
5. Let sit for 24 hours before serving.

I also made my own ladyfingers and double-baked them so they were extra crisp before soaking. A wonderful recipe. Much better than most restaurants!

I've been wanting to make tiramisu forever! I've just been a scaredy cat! I made this recipe last night and it came out so perfect!

I did read a ton of reviews before my attempt and as a result did make some changes from the original recipe that I feel strongly had impact on my success.

1. I used the hard lady finger cookies (Danesita) and I feel like the texture is perfect and not soggy because of that like some of the others pointed out that used fresh (soft) cookies.
2. I saw that some people said it wasn't sweet enough so I added one tablespoon of confectioner sugar to 
my whipping cream for a little added sweetness. ( It was perfection!)
3. I didn't use rum because as a huge tiramisu fan I wanted a stronger coffee flavor so I used coffee liqueur. (Next time I am going to try come coffee flavored extract.)
4. I dunked each cookie into the mixture instead of just wiping it on.
5. I took the advice of a great review on here and just combined whipping cream, mascarpone and custart mixture together instead of separate layers. (I agreed that seemed very unnecessary.) 

It came out so perfect! I have guests coming over to grill out and this will be the star attraction of the meal!

OK, I made this recipe to the letter. I refrigerated mine overnight (12 hours). I also put it in the freezer for about 2-3 hours, and, half hour before serving, I put it back in the refrigerator.  The freezer really helped firm it up quickly, and it tasted great.

Few tips: from the author Christine: 1. make 2 days ahead, it´s the peak of flavors and consistency. 2. double the amount of coffe/liquor, it´s not enough. 3. use soft lady fingers 4. don´t be tempted to lower the amount of sugar. 5. mix well the egg and sugar and when you cook the mixture NEVER stop beating, this makes a silky smoth texture. 8. with a electrical mixer add the mascarpone to the milk/egg, this way you avoid clumps and keeps the silky texture.

Made this for my daughter on her 19th birthday today. It was incredibly light and delicious.  I have only had tirimasu a few times in my life - this was super easy and so rich and creamy. My daightew's boyfriend has had tirimasu and is a tirimasu snob and he loved it.

I have been making tiramisu for over 10 years. I've tried many recipes and this is by far THE BEST TIRAMISU I've ever made. My guests loved it. It was delicious. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

This was so much easier than I ever thought it would be, and it got RAVE reviews. I found the soft ladyfingers in our local grocery store bakery section.  As most of the reviewers did, I doubled the coffee/rum mixture, but left everything else the same.   I also followed the review to make it the day before because the flavors blend better over time.  I think it's definitely important to use an electric mixer for this type of recipe, because you want to obtain that rich, creamy consistency for each layer.  Oh, and I also read that it's better to sprinkle the cocoa on before serving, or else it gets soggy looking.  Great recipe.  If you want to impress people, this is the recipe to use!

This was an easy and delicious recipe! I added 2 tablespoons of brewed coffee and 1 tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder to the whipped cream and it made such a huge difference. I love the extra coffee flavor by adding that in. Next time, I'm going to add 1-2 tblsp of coffee to the custard too. By the 3rd day it was absolutely delicious!! I also quickly dipped the lady fingers into the brewed coffee and the texture was perfection - it wasn't soggy or hard.

The best base Tiramisu recipe that I have found. I use Kahlua in place of rum, quadruple the coffee and Kahlua amounts, I did not split the ladyfingers but dipped them whole. I also whipped the mascarpone into the cooled custard then folded in the whipped cream.

I love the recipe. Here are my suggestions and what I did different and had great feedback from tiramisu lovers.
-for the soft lady fingers I would bake them in the oven at 320 for 10-15 minutes so they get harder; ideally find some hard ones or make your own
-dip them quickly in coffee/rum mixture and line the pan, then when soft squish them together to fit more of them
-sprinkle the cocoa powder between each layer
-fold the custard into the whip cream and add a little more vanilla

I think I actually heard angels singing when I took the first bite!!! This is SO good!!! I followed the recipe and tips and watched video (doubled coffee and rum). I only had an 8 1/2 x 12, and it was fine. In the video it looks like the lady fingers are still "whole", but there is no way I would have had enough, so I split all of mine, each package was a perfect layer. The video also showed soaking them, im thinking unless they were frozen, there is no way they wouldn't have either fallen apart or soaked up all the coffee 1/2 way thru. Spooning the coffee/rum over, worked great!! Letting it sit for 48 hours a must!! Well worth the wait!!!! DELICIOUS!! AMAZING!! WONDERFUL!! BEST DESSERT I'VE EVER MADE!! (and I've won contests for my desserts!!)

1st: recipe with the common corrections was awesome. 2nd: review from Feb 23, 2011 by CelticSmiles: This review had me laughing for ten minutes. I am GLAD that you + your DH finished off the 4 servings you made. There isn't much, but it's still alcohol and coffee and I personally wouldn't admit to serving this to your KIDS.

I used this Tiramisu recipe at a family function, and to say it was a hit would be an understatement. My whole family bakes and they know their desserts very well, so this is a definite 5/5.

The only things I changed were the following: I used Kahlua instead of Rum because I like its flavour more, and I used MUCH more than 1/4 cup of strong coffee. I used about 1.5 cups per layer of lady fingers. I didn't soak them beforehand, I simply laid them dry and then poured the 1.5 cups of coffee (mixed with about 1/4 cup kahlua) onto them. This worked well since the ladyfingers absorb very quickly. I also found the mascarpone mixture difficult to spread with a spatula (it's quick thick) so just a head up: it's probably easiest to use your washed hands. 

In accordance with one other review here, I made it 24 hours before it was to be served, and I agree that the flavour was more intense. Happy Baking!

Very good. I reduced this to 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 3/4th cup and it was plenty sweet. 1/4 cup is not enough coffee I used about 2 cups of expresso coffee didn't include any rum but nobody could tell. I froze it over night and defrosted it a few hours. It was still very good defrosted.

I'm very pleased with this easy to follow recipe. I love the thought of baking but am very horrible at it. My husband company have a bake off with alcohol dessert as a theme. He asked me to make tiramisu. I googled and this recipe comes up. I follow with a few tweak of tips from other reviewer and viola' my husband won the contest which is very exciting for us. I use pound cake instead of ladyfingers. I arranged the bottom layer with coffee and liquer, the middle layers with mostly liquer and the top layer with very little coffee. I recommend dusting cocoa powder after every mascapone layers to have a nice layering affect. Let the tiramisu sits for at least 24 hrs to have the best taste. Thank for this great recipe and all the tips!!!

Delicious, but definitely needs more coffee mixture but be sure to watch how much rum you're putting in because that comes through quite nicely. I also think next time I think I won't halve the ladyfingers. That was a pain in the ace and I've seen many a tiramisu with whole ladyfingers.

Tasted just like the one at my favorite Italian restaurant - and there was none left. Followed exactly except used 1 cup espresso and 1/4 cup dark rum. Made 2 days ahead.

I needed to make additional coffee/rum mix to dunk the ladyfingers in...perhaps because I ended up using twice the amount of ladyfingers than the recipe calls for. But it was fantastic that way - will make again!

My closest group of friends and I planned a progressive dinner party on New Year's Eve.  My family was responsible for dessert.  I know tiramisu is not a "favorite".  It's more of an acquired taste.  I planned on making at least t desserts though, so I wasn't concerned about having tiramisu as one of the options.  Besides, I have been dying to make MY FAVORITE dessert (tiramisu).  I read well over 60 reviews from others who have previously made this dessert.  I was a tad nervous, but built up the courage to just do it.  This was by far the best tiramisu I have ever tasted... I mean it.... EVER!  If you follow the directions verbatim, you won't be disappointed.  Some of the ingredients were tricky to find, but my local grocery store (Kroger) had them all.  Here are a few of my suggestions: 1. USE THE SOFT FINGERS and 2. DOUBLE the rum/coffee mixture if not triple it.  The fingers, in my grocery store, were in the bakery section where the specialty things are like canoli shells. The marscapone cheese was also in the bakery/specialty cheese section.  Just hard to spot, but it's there.  Don't leave the store thinking they don't have it.  ASK FOR IT.  I haven't tried NOT refrigerating the yolk/milk mixture before mixing with the cheese mixture.  My guess is... it's fine and like another reviewer said, easier to blend the cheese mixture into because the cheese is stiff, but I wanted to follow it to a "T".  I feasted off of this dessert for days and days. Feel free to contact me w ?

I followed this recipe with a few changes: I beat the yolks and sugar before heating to ensure they were mixed enough and cooked evenly. I also followed a comment's advice and used equal parts coffee and rum (doubled to 1/2 cup each) and brushed the lady fingers instead of dipping them to avoid a mush mess. I added 1/2 tsp. sugar to the whipped cream. After an overnight chill, the custard tasted heavenly but much to my dismay the lady fingers were very rum-tasting. It was overwhelming, I couldn't taste the coffee at all. I hope in letting it chill for another half a day the rum will mellow a LOT so I can serve this. It looks very nice. If not, I will make it again using half the amount of rum (or possibly a different alcohol). Very good custard! I will also keep my lady fingers whole to distinguish the layers a bit more.

i would recommend you to use BelGioioso's mascerpone cheese because the other brand i used for my second one (i made two), i think it was by Vermont Butter & Cheese Co., tasted really crappy. I did not use rum but the taste is still heavenly. Also i did not whisk together the egg custard and the whipped cream because then i would really feel the custard and the cream blend together in my mouth (I mixed them up together for my SECOND one and it tasted not as good as i expected, i couldnt differentiate between the custard and the cream at all). I also put a little bit off sugar into the coffee to enhance the taste). Also for the whipped cream, i would say to add also 2/3 cup of whole milk into it along with heavy cream and vanilla extract (it tastes really good when you assemble the whole thing together.

I doubled this recipe to fit into a 10" springform pan, therefore I quadrupled the coffee (I used espresso rum & kahlua) rum mixture. Made 24 hrs in advance. Took it to an Italian themed dinner. Most people had never had Tiramisu, but it was devoured.

This recipe was amazing!  I am a very experienced cook and decided to make this for an Italian themed Christmas party and all I can say is WOW!  I used soft lady fingers and did double the rum and coffee.  Tried to soak the lady fingers but found it much easier to drizzle the coffee and rum onto the lady fingers in the pan with a turkey baster.  Also, it gets much better when made 24 hours ahead.  Excellent recipe!

Wow! Dont be afraid to try this! I'm not a good cook and was afraid because I didnt know what mascarpone cheese was, let alone where to find it! In the end, it turned out AMAZING! Everyone loved it and said I will become famous for this recipe! I used the hard/cruchy lady fingers, so the only change I made was that I did have to double the coffee/rum recipe. Trust me and make this, it is good...and pretty easy if you're not a "cook" like myself!

This is the first and last tiramisu recipe I will ever use.  I just made it for the 2nd time, with the recommendation of increasing the coffee/rum mix.  The first time I just kind of poured that mix on a bowl of lady fingers and had some soaked and some without any.  This time I tried to pour more evenly, with 3 times the mixture.  Also, as someone else noted, you need the soft/squishy lady fingers, which I was able to find at a local Italian grocery.  Also, as others noted, it really does taste better if you refrigerate for at least 24 hours before eating.  My boyfriend likes desserts that aren't very sweet, and this has gotten the stamp of approval from him!

This recipe was great!!! I took the advice of others and increased the coffee/rum mixture.  Could not find ladyfingers anywhere so had to make them and they didn't turn out exactly right but it was all still delicious! THANK YOU!

I made this twice, once as a trial run, and once for my boyfriend's Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone--my family, his family, my roommates, and my friends loved it. 
I did double the coffee and rum and made my own lady fingers with the "Savoiardi I" recipe I also found on Allrecipes. For presentation, I lined a baking pan with saran wrap, and put the layers in backwards. After letting it set for several hours, I turned it over, removed the saran wrap, and dusted with cocoa. Voila! They couldn't believe it was not from the bakery!

this turned out AWESOME!!! First time making Tiramisu and this was a huge hit at a party! And I'm not a good cook to begin with! Recipe is very simple & dummy proof :) 

Only change I made was adding brandy instead of rum b/c I didn't have any rum at home.

i estimated my own coffee/rum mixture and dipped each lady finger in one at a time.

This was excellent, I love tiramisu and am glad now i can make it at home. I couldn't come by ladyfingers but used slices of sponge cake placed in a 150 degree C oven for 5-10mins to harden up. The custard recipe is really top. I didn't have rum so (tentatively) substituted 1/2 brandy and 1/2 whisky - it tastes so good. Also take heed to other reviewers' advice regarding doubling the coffee/liquor mixture. Thanks for a great recipe.

Lady fingers are not soaked all of the way through with the amount of coffee and rum listed.  We doubled the amounts for those two.  Other than that, a great recipe!

Was afraid of how it would turn out since I never really eaten tiramisu and I'm not sure how its suppose to taste or look, nor it's texture.

But everyone loveeed it to bits! (even those who were suppose to refrain from alcohol had 3 servings!)

1) I swapped out the rum for coffee liqueur. 1:1 coffee : liqueur. Doubled the amount as most people did.

- Because coffee liqueur is sweet as compared to rum, I added less sugar to the recipe.

2) Made it 2days in advance. The cream on top became slightly dry, so I made a fresh batch of cream just before bringing it over to the party.

3) Sprinkled hot raspberry chocolate drink powder instead of cocoa. [Added more flavor]

4) Soaked the ladysfingers a bit too much. I think. Felt abit too soggy, not sure if Tiramisu is suppose to be that way.

Have fun and good luck!

I'm giving this five stars because I altered the recipe, so this may be why it didn't come out that well.  I substituted amaretto for rum.  I doubled the amount of alcohol and coffee as some suggested.  I let it sit for 36 hours before serving.  It was still runny, but good.  But it was lacking some flavor.  I'm not sure what that flavor was.  I wonder if the rum would have been a better choice.  I'm going to let it sit for another 12 hours to see if that helps.  I did transfer it onto parchment paper and put it back into the fridge, so maybe that will make a difference.  I think that amaretto just doesn't have the same bite to it that rum does, so the flavor wasn't there. :(

THIS IS IT! I made it as directed except for the rum, I did not have any and did not care for it. I also dipped the ladyfinger cookies directly in coffee (eyeballed the amount of coffee I needed). EXCELLENT tiramisu! I will never ever order it at a restaurant and pay 7$ for it! Thanks a lot Christine :)

this recipe is amazing!!! When I first made it, I made a mistake of putting the mascarpone cheese in the egg yolk mixture… So i still used it and it was the most amazingly tasty mistake!  Now every time i make this I put mascarpone cheese in the egg yolk and the whipped cream mixtures… :)  Very tasty

This is delectable. I didn't change a thing,next time to change it up I will try Kahlua instead of rum. Stick with Rum, it is better Kahlua.

I've made this twice--both times for special occasions over at my parents' house--and it was a great hit, but didn't let the egg custard come to a full boil as I was afraid it would curdle, and it takes SO long just to get it hot enough to thicken (took me about 1/2 hour on med-low), I didn't want to risk having to start over. This made the custard quite runny, still, so I couldn't spread the whipped cream over it, but rather had to mix the two together a little bit. And I used an extra layer of ladyfingers to sog up the extra moisture (and because the dish I was making it in was a bit deeper, but with smaller bottom dimensions than that called for). Everyone still said it was the best tiramisu they ever had, though. I'll have to try it again now that I'm home and have the right size dish to make it in, and more time to risk playing with the custard. Does it really not curdle if you let  boil? Will it really thicken enough to spread whipped cream over? Maybe I will try adding a little bit of custard powder in as insurance/extra thickener...But the recipe really is amazing just as it stands. Agreed with those who say double the coffe (and I used some amaretto with the rum the second time, which was really good, too), and let it sit for 24 hours.

This stuff is AMAZING!!! My family loved it, and so did I. I would use 1 3/4 cup of heavy cream, because 1 1/4 didn't make very much whip cream. But otherwise a perfect recipe!

This was spectacular!  I made it for Christmas, and while Tiramisu is not for everybody, it's definitely for me so I was excited to have plenty left over.  I might have went a little crazy with the coffee and rum so that could have been why people weren't too crazy about it.  But I froze it and it tasted delicious that way.

Turned out wonderfully! An amazing recipe indeed. MY TIPS: I used a casserole-type dish, but was slightly larger than recommended and found that I absolutely had to double the whipped cream. Otherwise, as others had suggested, I doubled coffee/liquor and was acceptable. BUT, if you're like me and like your tiramisu to be really strong in the coffee/liquor department I would even triple the amounts so as to really get a good soaking of the lady fingers (maybe 2 seconds dipped, per side?)...in which case, definitely DON'T cute them in half, leave them whole. Also, in this case, do buy the harder lady fingers so they don't fall apart in the soaking process. I made this for a social gathering and everyone RAVED about it! Definitely a do-over!!!

Awesome! My first attempt at Tiramisu.  I also had trouble finding the soft lady fingers, so used the crunchy ones, which worked out great.  Used about 3/4 cup of instant espresso (more than the original recipe, to ensure the lady fingers softened enough). Used creme de cacao liquer, because that's what I had.  Made 2 days ahead as many reviewers suggested, and it was perfect.  Looks very fancy using a springform pan (lining the sides with ladyfingers).  My family loved it, and I will definitely make it again.

I've made this three times so far.  Tried it with the rum this first time and just couldn't get it down.  Omitted the rum and it's PERFECT!

I love Tiramisu and decided to make this recipe for a dinner party. This was my first attempt at making this dessert and it was a hit! It's pretty easy to make and is delicious. Instead of using rum mixed with coffee, I mixed hazelnut coffee creamer with the coffee. It gives it the buttery taste without the alcohol. I would definitely make this again. Look no further, use this recipe!

I made it as a few others did  with half mascarpone and half cream cheese just because mascarpone is 8.00 a pound here. Personally I like my whipped cream a bit sweetened so I did add 2 TB to the whipped cream. My ladyfingers were not  too sweet as the stores here didn't have any/used the ladyfinger reciped from here on AR as well....so no sugar crust on them like some  of the storebought ones. Having made tiramisu in the past a trick I have found  to making good strong coffee flavor without adding so much coffee that the ladyfingers actually get soggy is to use instant coffee granules and make the coffee double strength. I probably will double the rum next time though. We do like rum!

Made this for the first time for company.  You would have thought I gave my company a million dollars.  They just raved about it.   I used skim milk and 1/2 lb of mascarpone cheese and 1/2 lb of cream cheese.  I used amaretto instead of rum.  Basted the ladyfingers with the coffee/amaretto mixture.  used 3 packages of  soft ladyfingers and 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream.  It took awhile for my eggs & sugar to boil, but the texture was great.  i too folded the whipped cream into the egg mixture and made it 48 hrs before serving it.   This is an expensive dessert to make, but worth the taste.   It is not difficult to make either.  Will definitely serve this again to company.

My coworkers have been begging me to make a tiramisu as I bring baked goods to work often. I've never had tiramisu before, and after making this, I realized that I've been missing out!  The flavors together are amazing

YUMMY!!!  I made this for my daughters birthday.  I doubled the coffee and I used Kahlua instead of the rum and doubled that as well.  Next time I will for sure triple the coffee/kahlua as it could use a little more of that flavor...even my italian hubby, who loves tiramisu, said that it needed more coffee flavor.  I would make this again...it was much easier then other ones that I have made.

When I tasted each layer individually I didn't enjoy the flavour at all and was concerned how my tiramisu would turn out, but once they were put together... what a huge difference! It was very creamy and delightful, not sweet at all in my opinion. In fact, I'll probably add a little sugar to the whipped cream next time I make it. I was always intimidated to make tiramisu because it seemed difficult, but the instructions are clear and it's just a matter of taking it one step at a time. I also made the ladyfingers with Roxanne's recipe from this site. Thanks Christine for the recipe!

This was amazing!  It tasted wonderful.. I will say that my custard was grainy; I'm not sure what I did wrong. It didn't change the flavor as it was to die for; but I couldn't get it smooth!

Oh my goodness!  This was heavenly.  My husband had never had tiramisu before, and I've had it a few times, but this had both of us saying, "Wow!" and wanting more.  I halved the recipe, but DOUBLED the coffee/rum as suggested by many others. I brewed the coffee extra-strong, poured a half cup, and added about four generous tablespoons of Cap't Morgan's Spiced Rum (my fave).  I lined a 9x5  bread tin with cling wrap (so easy to lift the dessert out to cut and serve and then drop back in to save the leftovers), then layered 1/2 the lady fingers on the bottom (two rows of five).  I DID NOT SPLIT the lady fingers, as the ones I found were thin and delicate. Drizzled a hefty amount of the coffee mix, then I layered 1/2 the mascarpone mixture and then 1/2 the cream.  Repeated the same steps, then sifted on a dusting of cocoa powder, and just a touch of confectioner's sugar.  I had it sit in the fridge for a full 24 hours to allow the flavors to mingle and intensify. This would be a great dessert to impress company, especially after a meal of lasagna with garlic bread and a colorful green salad.  SO DELISH!

This recipe is fantastic!!  I made this for my father's birthday -  he loves tiramisu...  it was such a hit!  I omitted the Rum (just my taste) and doubled the coffee based on other reviews but didn't need it all.  Also, as in other reviews definitely make one to two days in advance to allow the flavors to meld.  I was afraid it would be soggy, but it was absolutely not!  So fresh and light tasting, not heavy as some I have tasted!  Even the kids at the party ate it up like crazy!!  One thing I also did was add a bit of sugar (heaping teaspoon) to the whip cream and vanilla part, just to slightly sweeten it-  delicious!! Garnish with chocolate covered coffee beans (found at coffee shops) Sooooo good!!

This recipe is better than almost every tiramisu I've had at a restaurant.  The tastes were not quite combined on the first evening (you could taste each individual component), but by the subsequent nights, the flavors blended together beautifully.  We did double the amount of coffee + rum, as other reviewers suggest, but this got the bottom layer pretty soggy in the following evenings - next time, I might try the recommended amount or 1.5x the amount.  Also, we were trying to whip the heavy cream by hand, and it never formed stiff peaks - so might try just used pre-whipped cream, unless we invest in an electric beater.  We added a bit of instant coffee with the cocoa powder to the top of the tiramisu, and that added some nice bitter notes.  A very professional recipe - I would make this again.

This recipe is just fantastic.  I used chocolate filled, Milano cookies in place of lady fingers and it turned out wonderfully!  I would suggest you try it as well.

I adjusted the recipe for 18 servings, doubled the amount of coffee (and brewed it double strength), and instead of rum, I used the same amount of water and 1/4 tsp. imitation rum extract.  I made this in a 10" x 13" baking dish.  Also, this was prepared a day ahead of time using the hard biscuit type ladyfingers.  They were nice and cake-like when I served it.  My sister-in-law from Italy and my brother loved it.  They thought it was some of the best they had ever had!  I will likely make this again.

This was a very tasty treat. However, all of us that ate this agreed that the ladyfingers needed more soaking liquid. Next time I will be using 1/2 cup of the coffee. They just didn't have enough liquid for a complete soak. The flavor of the custard was great! Next time I will add 1/8 cup of honey to the whip cream mix, to give it a bit more sweetness. All in all it was tasty. But room for improvement.

Great recipe. My foodie friends said it was as good as any at a restaurant. But you definitely need to double or triple the amount of coffee. I made it exactly according to instructions at first and there was hardly any coffee flavor. I didn't get any enthusiastic compliments that time. It is also quite difficult to split the lady fingers in half lengthwise when using the hard lady fingers (soft ones were too hard to find, even in NYC). The 2nd time, I did not split the cookies, and I rolled each whole cookie in a bowl with the coffee mixture. This turned out perfectly. It was not too much ladyfingers at all, as it smushes down with the moisture of the coffee and surrounding filling. I also combined the egg mixture and whipped cream for simplicity, as most recipes do. Absolutely fine. Also, I saved a scoop of the mixture for a personal parfait, and I used nilla wafers b/c i ran out of lady fingers.  the nilla wafers worked great! (I wouldn't use them for a whole pan tiramisu, but for a parfait it was totally fine).

Awesome!  I made it just as the recipe was written.  EXCEPT I folded the whipped cream into the mascarpone cheese mixture and then layered that with the lady fingers.  TOO DIE FOR!  Even my daughter who doesn't like Tiramisu loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Definitely double the rum and coffee and make the coffee strong!  We used a springform pan and needed 3 packages of lady fingers, in order to line the outside of the tiramisu as photo'd.  Need to make sure the bottom layer of ladyfingers are not used sparingly, if they are the cream will come out of the pan.  Drizzle the lady fingers instead of soaking them, or they tend to fall apart.  It did get much better on day two and three!

This recipe was very easy to follow and turned out delicious...I made an alternative for the mascarpone cheese by mixing an 8 oz package of cream cheese and a 1/4 cup of heavy cream and a tablespoon of butter together.  I also put a tablespoon of confectioners sugar in the heavy cream.  I also, only used half as much rum as was called for, so it wasn't overbearing. It turned out wonderful.

I loved this recipe and so did everyone who tried it! I did change a few things though, I was debating which recipe to make, this one or the "Classic Tiramisu" on this website, so I kinda combined the two. I started out following the directions in this recipe up to step 2 but then I combined the yolk mixture and the whipped cream mixture together with a hand mixer until combined well and used Kahlua instead of rum to soak the ladyfingers in. I brought this to work and one person thought that I had bought this from an Italian bakery. My daughter said she was in heaven and that I had to make more. A wonderful desert to impress with.

This recipe is amazing!  I brewed 3/4 cup of super strong espresso, added 4 TBS of Kahlua and brushed half on each layer of ladyfingers with a pastry brush then let it sit for two days.  I have never had such delicious tiramisu in my life!!!

I made this recipe and followed the suggestions to double the coffee mixture. I also used Kahlua. Since I have never made Tiramisu before I was wondering how the once crunchy now soggy ladyfingers would turn out. Well to answer the question, I have to make three more this week. Cutting the ladyfingers in half is a pain. Some reviewers suggested not doing so. I believe it would not make a difference. I also plan to make this substituting the ladyfingers with pound cake.

I made this Tiramisu for my dinner club. Everyone raved about it. It was absolutely delicious!! The only changes I made was that I used Kalhua instead of rum. I will definitely make this again.

This was my first attempt at a desert.  I brought it to a friend's house and it was a super hit... and very filling.

It was served a full day after its creation and it was light and VERY flavorful.  I did make the coffee very strong and doubled the rum content (dark spiced rum)...but I did have leftover liquid.

I had to fight for my life to take the remaining piece home for the next day, it was good, but the bottom layer was too soggy for my taste.  I'd stick to serving 1 day after.

This is excellent, and pretty easy to make.  The ladyfingers that I found weren't very thick, so I didn't halve them, and it worked out perfectly to have two layers of everything in a 9x13 pan.  And I did "drizzle" like others had suggested, but I also used a pastry brush to put the coffee/rum on the cookies.  Excellent, and I will definitely make again!

I made this recipe and used cream cheese, it worked great.  I made the tiramisu in a spring form pan and lined the inside of the pan with lady fingers. You will need an extra package of ladyfingers.  Also,  I dipped the ladyfingers in 3/4 cup of coffee and 5 teaspoons of Kaluha.

I changed this basic recipe a little and it turned out very well. Instead of mascarpone I used cream cheese, instead of ladyfingers I used a vanilla cake made with a vanilla cake mix, and instead of rum I used amaretto (almond liquor). I just sliced the vanilla cake and used the slices as a substitute for the ladyfingers. You will get a stronger taste, if you use a very strong coffee/amaretto mix and VERY IMPORTANT: The longer the tiramisu sits in the fridge, the better it gets. It tastes best after 2-3 days.

ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!  I personally do not like Tiramisu, however, this recipe was fantastic. I mixed all the cream cheeses and whipping cream together and just did one layer, then the chocolate on that for each of the layers and it turned out fantastic! I made it the night before and I would strongly recommend doing that. The taste was incredible!

This recipe was so easy.  I made it for my sister-in-law at a dinner.  She loves Tiramisu, but I was not a big fan.  I am now!  I also added more
rum and bought 2 shots of expresso from a coffee shop.  The flavors were great.  I am going to make it again this Friday.  So very easy. I hvae passed the recipe around to everyone at work.  A great dessert.

I am a dessert snob and this Tiramisu was the best I have ever had!  It was the hit of the party.  It was easy to make and delicious.  I did increase the coffee and rum (X4) and dunked the lady fingers in the mixture.  I wanted a stronger coffee/rum flavor.  I also made the egg, sugar and milk mixture the night before and refrigerated it.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing it with us!

Soooo delicious! I cannot believe how luscious this is—and, that I made it! Lol And, I’msaying this only having tasted it immediately—if it gets even better as everyone seems to think after the flavors marry, then I’ll surely be in heaven. I had a bunch of whipped cream and ladyfingers to use up after making a trifle a few days prior, and though this is actually quite a similar dish, the technique for making the custard was very different—and this one was so much better—especially the consistency. I will eat it any time! I also agree with everyone who says you need more coffee liquid. I ended up using a whole 12 oz bottle of dark cold brew Starbucks coffee (from grocery store) and two minibar style bottles of Captain Morgan, and still didn’t have enough to dip my last couple of cookies. Also, I had thought I needed to soak them for a couple minutes, but these cookies are so absorbent you only need a couple seconds on each side to get fully saturated. After that, it gets so soggy it falls apart and is unusable.

I attended culinary arts college back in 1986. While at Johnson and Wales we prepared a great number of dishes from homemade pastries to upscale desserts. Tiramisu has always been a favorite. I no longer have my old school books so relied on this recipe to create a much loved dish. It was spot on. The flavors, texture and preparation were in line with my formal training. I highly recommend this recipe.

I made this for a wine tasting dinner with friends, and it was amazing. Rave reviews from everyone, especially the Italians in the group, and even one friend who is a professional caterer. Many thanks to Libby (12/19/08) who summarized a lot of the other reviews. Here are my notes:
**It is important to make this recipe at least 24-48 hours ahead so the flavors have a chance to blend. 
1) I used Savoiardi ladyfingers (Publix).
2) Stir custard mixture constantly while cooking. 
3) Add 1 tsp sugar to cream/vanilla mixture.
4) Triple the amount of strong coffee and rum (I also added a Tbsp of Kahlua).
5) Don't split ladyfingers. Just very quickly dip both sides in the coffee/rum mixture (just barely colors each side) and place sugared side down. Do not soak them or you will get mush!

I've made this several times to perfect it. Best if made the day before serving. I make espresso and Increase the amount to one cup and rum to 4 T. Need three packages of 12 ladyfingers for 9 by 12 pan. Be careful not to over mix the heavy cream, if it is too dried out it will not spread well. Be sure to get 16 oz of mascarpone, a popular brand makes it in a 12 oz container.  i use my egg beater in mixer to smooth out the cheese with the vanilla. Then I fold the whipped cream and cheese mixture together to create one spread

I've been making this for YEARS! Everyone that has ever tried it, has LOVED it and always asks me when I'm making it again :). I followed the recipe as written for a long time. Only the last 2 years I've changed it ever so slightly. My new changes have been; making my own ladyfingers using the "Savoiardi I" recipe from this site (I've tried all the ladyfinger recipes from this site and found this is the closest to store bought crisp Savoiardi). Instead of sprinkling cocoa powder, I buy a high quality 70% cacao bittersweet chocolate bar and use a micro plane grater for super fine chocolate shavings. I fold my whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture so I can have one less bowl on the counter during assembly (limited counter space!), and I prefer the texture this way. I sometimes use rum, sometimes not. It all depends on if I have any handy or not (usually not). And in my opinion, I think it is best 24 hours after it's been made. 4-6 hours is just not enough time for all the flavors to really soak in. I know it's hard to wait! But I promise, for this recipe - patience TRULY IS A VIRTUE!

This is my favorite dessert! I have made it several times and mastered it. I like the cream in between the layers thinner (less filling this way lol). I use about 10oz of ladyfingers, organic sugar, milk, cream and eggs! My secret is to dip each ladyfinger in the coffee mixture (it will need to be doubled, about a cup of coffee. I use Italian coffee). I dip them fast and set them in the pan. They become moist this way! I also put cocoa powder in the middle whipped cream layer. Tastes delicious!

Made this multiple times...always excellent. Remember the quality of your finished product will only be as good as the quality of your ingredients. Have used different liquors....Kahlua, Amaretto (Disarrono), Rum.....always yummy. And definitely fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone, makes a huge difference.

Followed suggestions from other reviews and it was dead on.  Definitely wait more than 48 hours for this to set and all the flavors to sink in.  I tried it after 24 hours and it was yummy.  Then had another piece the day after (so almost 72 hours) and it was amazing. :)  Will be making this again for sure.  At first the egg mixture looked like there were mini clumps, but in the end it tasted fine and super smooth.  Just don't stop mixing the egg mixture.

I've been using this site for at least 10 years and this is my first review. Not because I didn't like other recipes, but because I LOVE this one. I live in a more remote area so had no access to lady fingers and I didn't have rum. So, we used pound cake sliced about 1/2 inch thick and we used Baileys Irish cream in place of the rum. It is AMAZING. Baileys and coffee are a perfect combo anyway and you will want to eat the entire thing in one sitting. Really. You really have to try it....yum yum YUM!

I've never had or made tiramisu before and this was absolutely delicious!!!! It wasn't hard to make at all. A little time consuming but totally worth it! The only lady fingers I could find were the small EXTREMELY absorbent ones so my first doubled batch of rum and coffee went completely into the first layer so it was a bit strong but the next layer I just drizzle it over the lady fingers after I placed them which worked out way better. I will definitely make this again!!!

I'm a Tiramisu-Lover but I've never dared to make one myself. I finally decided to try this recipe and it was a total hit! My guests and I loved it. However, I followed a few suggestions from the reviewers and let tiramisu sit in the refrigerator for over 24 hours. I also used more coffee mixture: 6 tablespoons of rum and 3/4 cup of coffee. I basically soaked ladyfinger cookies in the coffee mixture which made the tiramisu nicely moist (i.e. the way I like it).

I made this as written except for doubling the coffee/rum mix.  Perhaps this "double amount" was needed since I used the "hard", unsplit lady fingers from a local Italian grocery. I lined the pan with the 1st layer of lady fingers, drizzled them with half the liquid then layered as written. Added the 2nd layer of lady fingers, drizzled them with coffee/rum mix then again layered as written. For our taste, the ingredients and quantities in the recipe (except for doubling the rum/coffee mix) were perfect.  Very light. Very fluffy. Not too sweet. Delicious. I've made the recipe twice and have gotten rave reviews from guests both times.

I am a big Tiramisu fan and when I tried it I though I was eating at an Italian restaurant! Great recipe, but I would recommend doubling the coffee. I also used ricotta cheese because I could not find mascarpone, but it still tasted great!

I made this for a Womens Club Italian Night.  Major hit.  So many have asked for the recipe.  I like this because my favorite recipe used raw eggs.  Other recipes called for pudding,etc.  This is basically like my original, but the egg yolks are cooked so they are safe for eating.  It doesn't use the whites, my other recipe did.  But I save the whites for meringue and egg white omelets.  Great recipe, a real keeper.

I used a 13X9 dish for mine. I was concerned that it wouldn't be sweet enough w/ both the whipped cream & the coffee not being sweetened, but it was perfect! The custard/cheese concoction provided all the sweetness needed. I used brandy instead of rum, as I thought rum is too distinctive of a taste & not one that I want in my tiramisu.

I noticed other recipes made use of the egg whites, but this one decides to use whipped cream instead. I hated to throw them out, so my wife made some delicious meringes with them!

This dessert capped off a lovely dinner of fresh made pasta, sauces, & bread, & after a heavy meal, it was light & delicious with a hot cup of espresso.

Made this cake for my dad. He is a BIG tiramisu fan and he knows whats good. I know he loves this cake so much that I made this recipe for him. When I surprised him with the cake, he was skeptical because one, I'm not italian. two, i have a reputation of making crazy desserts and have them turn out bad on the first try. 

This was different. The look on his face was priceless. He even said "we don't need to go out for tiramisu anymore!"
I also fed this cake to my family and my loving grandma stated that this was the best tiramisu, better than any restaurants'. This means quite a lot because she probably goes out to dinner like four out of the seven days a week.

Needless to say, I'll definitely be making it again!

I did 1 1/2 times of the coffee rum mixture and next time will double it, as some other reviewers suggested.  Also made 24 hours in advance as suggested by others.  Delish! Would definitely make again.

This tiramisu was one of the best I've ever had. Creamy and decadent! I made a few changes. I didn't cut the ladyfingers in half so I had to double the coffee mixture and used an 8" by 11" dish. On the first layer, I noticed that it was difficult to spread the whipped cream so for the second layer, I mixed the whipped cream with the mascarpone mixture. That ended up even better because the flavor was distributed evenly. Instead of rum I used Disaronno amaretto liqueur which was divine! Got rave reviews from everyone who tried it!

I made this for an Italian themed church potluck - boy did people love it! I used decaf coffee and rum flavoring (kids were there!). I also folded the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture rather than keeping them separate. I loved this recipe and can't wait to make it again!

This is VERY good. However I did not split the lady fingers, added Kahlua instead of rum and did doubled the coffee & kahlua amounts. Came out perfect!

I decided to try this recipe since it had so many good reviews .I also increased the coffee. For every 1/4c of coffee I added 2T of rum. I also added 1tsp of espresso powder to the brewed coffee.I too didn't split the ladyfingers, when I finished making it, I put it in the fridge to age for 2 days like some of the reviews suggested! This was absolutely delicious! Everybody wanted seconds and I will certainly make this again.

I've never made tiramisu before.  This turned out wonderful.  I had the hard ladyfinger biscuits as they were the only kind I could find.  I doubled the rum/coffee mixture and quickly dunked the cookies in it.  It turned out great.  Very delicious!!

Right after exams i was in the mood of baking so I tried to make meringues.  But I failed and it brought me down, so I decided to make something different and tried this recipe.  The ingredients were very costly, since I currently live in china and much of the ingredients were imported from Europe and America.  Still did it anyway, very time consuming, but fantastic.  The night I made it i tried some of the cream and it was kind of disgusting, but I followed the recipe and refridgerated my 9-inch tiramisu overnight.  The next morning I sprinkled the cocoa and had it for breakfast.  It was AMAZING!!!!  And yes, I did double the coffee, or else the rum flavor would be too strong for me.  However, the the lower layer of cream was still kind of soggy in the morning, so I had to refrigerate it at 32 degrees for another day to have it stand upright.  I would cut the milk in half next time.  Still a wonderful and easy recipe to follow, and it wasn't overly sweet or plain.  Just the way it should be.  Tastier than the ones in restaurants.  Christine y are my life saver!!!  :D

WOW! SO GOOD! I did add more vanilla to the whipped cream and more then double the coffee, and use kalulah instead of Rum. You really need to let the lady finders soak that stuff up. So, with a few minor edits for more flavor, this was magical!

DELICIOUS!  I didn't have rum so I used amaretto, and doubled the coffee/alcohol mixture.  I also used the crispy ladyfingers.  This was absolutely amazing.  Everyone that ate it came back for more, and said that it was the best tiramisu they'd ever had! Great recipe!

This was an excellent recipe....tasted better than some I've eaten in restaurants! Be sure to double the amount of coffee and alcohol suggested in the recipe, otherwise, you will not have enough liquid to soak the ladyfingers in. To get a stronger coffee flavor if you aren't using espresso, stir 1-2 tsp of instant coffee into your brewed coffee. Also, don't split the ladyfingers in half...it makes them way too thin. I made 2 batches of this recipe...one with and without splitting the cookies and the whole cookie recipe turned out way better. Your guests will love it!

OH MY GOD!!!! YUM!!!! It was awesome!!!People said it was the BEST tiramasu they ever had. I sweetend the whipped cream with powdered sugar. After dusting the cake with the cocoa I shredded dark chocolate on top. I also doubled the coffee and used 2 TBSPN of rum and 2 TBSPN of khalua. I drizzled the coffee mixture and did not taste to much alcohol or espresso. For those of you on weight watchers be carefull..It is 12 points for a piece.

I used this recipe, modified for individual tiramisu parfaits I made for my church youth group's Valentine's dinner fundraiser a couple days ago.  We couldn't afford mascarpone, so I used the Mascarpone Substitute found here at AllRecipes instead.  I also used the Ladyfingers recipe by Roxanne instead of buying store-bought ladyfingers.  Since I was making these for a church function and also because children would be eating them, I omitted the rum.  I used double-strength Kahlua flavored coffee, so the desserts still had that liqueur flavor to them.  The custard is so simple to make, as long as you watch it carefully, stir it constantly as it's cooking, and take it off the heat as soon as it starts to smell "custardy", if that makes sense.  I topped each parfait with a hand-piped chocolate heart and a sprinkling of red sugar crystals.  Everyone raved about their desserts!  In fact, one girl asked her tiramisu to be her Valentine :)

Absolutely fabulous!  After reading the reviews, I doubled the coffee and rum.  I didn't have cocoa powder, so I grated unsweetened baking chocolate over the top of the completed tirimasu.  This was a huge hit at our super bowl party.

I absolutely loved this recipe when I tried it for NYE this year. As far as Tiramisu goes, I have made a number of recipes and this is a basic fantastic go-to recipe. While this may go against popular opinion, I think the recipe is fairly forgiving. I omitted the rum and made a cup of espresso instead of coffee. I also only had 4 eggs on hand and really didn't want to go back to the store. 
I really think the trick is finding the right texture of lady fingers so they don't crumble into mush while you are trying to work with them! I lucked out with some great lady fingers from Trader Joes that weren't too soft/too hard. I would recommend dipping the lady fingers into a cup and then laying quickly in the dish rather than err on a soupy mess of coffee on the bottom of the pan.
As far as the times in this recipe... I am possibly one of the most efficient (ahem, impatient) bakers alive. So, after cooking up the custard, I put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes, and whipped it up with the marscapone when I knew it was cool enough to not melt the cheese! While leaving it in the fridge overnight did enhance the taste, we did sample it after about 4 hours and wasn't bad at all!

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve this year-everyone raved about it! I tasted just like tiramisu should. I did double the coffee/rum mix and folded the whip cream into the mascarpone mix. The cream tasted awesome! I also let it sit for two days prior to serving it.

This is the best Tiramisu I've ever had! It is a little costly to make but so worth it. I made my own ladyfingers and had no problem with dipping them (quickly) in the rum/coffee mixture.

I am not the best baker/chef at ALL.. but this was simple and, quite frankly, the best cake I've EVER had. And I'm a wedding photographer for a living and eat cake at least 30 times a year. This is the moistest cake I've ever had.

Great recipe. Making it just for me and my wife I would cut it in half. It is not that we would not eat all of it (who could resist) but this is  really a splurge dish for anyone who values their arteries. Like another reviewer, however, I doubled up (at least) on the coffee and rum. I suppose that it all depends on the moistness of the ladyfingers.

I have never made tiramisu before this but I figured id give it a try! It is delicious and the texture is wonderful.  The only thing that I would have changed is that i wish the cream was a bit sweeter but this is canceled out a bit with the sweetness of the mascarpone cheese mixture.  It was definitely a huge hit!!!

AMAZING recipe!! My boyfriend and I actually spend time making this tiramisu together since it is a favorite of ours. We dont even order it at the restaurants anymore because we feel spoiled with this recipe!!! Its fairly simple. The worst part is waiting overnight for it to chill...but VERY worth it !!!

I used way more coffee than this recipe called for because that's what we eat tiramisu for. Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly and this recipe came out great. I even had friends tell me that they don't usually like tiramisu because they don't like coffee, but they loved this recipe. 

It tastes pretty good a few hours after you make it, tastes great 24 hours later, and is best after 2 or 3 days.

I had never made tiramisu before and was really nervous it wasn't going to be sweet enough-- so I added a 1/4 cup of sugar to the top layer of whipped cream-- I made it the day beforeI needed it as others suggested and it was awesome!  I doubled the coffee/rum mix as well and really was as good if not better than any bakery!  Very impressed!

This is really good. I only make half the portion and add plain Greek yogurt at the same time I add the Mascarpone. Gives it a bit of tanginess. I added about half the portion of Mascarpone. U can also freeze for the best ice cream. I also added a tablespoon of gelatin since the first time I made the the yolk/cheese mixture was loose and it came out more mousse-like

This is an exceptional recipe.  It's very easy to adjust to your own tastes.  I usually amp up the rum, adding sugar to to coffee/rum mixture, and make my own sponge cake.  But this is a fabulous go-to recipe I have in my permanent collection.  I must KEEP myself from making this TOO often.  :D

This is the perfect Tiramisu recipe!  Tiramisu is my husband's favorite dessert and this is his favorite version of it.  I make it quite a bit and it always goes over well with company.  I agree with other reviewers that the coffee mixture could be doubled, but other than that it's perfect.

Excellent!! The only change I made was drizzling a little Godiva white chocolate liqueur over the coffee/rum soaked ladyfingers. My fiancé ate the ENTIRE thing and has requested it again for his birthday in a few weeks. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is the ONLY tiramisu recipe I will ever use. It's perfect. I do increase the amount of coffee just because I enjoy a stronger coffee flavor. I use the mascarpone substitute found on this website as well.

Very good dessert, not too sweet.  Easy to make as well.  I made it with about 1 cup of espresso and no rum.  Let it sit in the fridge a couple of days.

Excellent Tiramisu without raw eggs.  I have made many recipes in the past but this is the easiest and safest because you do not need to use raw egss.  I do use Brandy instead of Rum.  Don't chince out on the Brandy.  Get a good name brand that you would drink.  Also, I double the coffee recipe and use strong coffee but not espresso.  Can't say it make a difference.  You will have coffee left over but this way you can make the lady fingers as wet/dry as you like.  Do let this sit for at least 12 hrs before serving.  The flavors get better and the cream sets up a little better.

This is AWESOME!  It takes longer than 35 minutes to make, though, because the yolk mixture needs to cool for 1 hour.  I would recommend using about 3/4 c coffee and 6 T rum, or just until the ladyfingers are soaked.  I also drizzled quite a bit of Kahlua over the ladyfingers because they seemed dry.  This turned out GREAT!  It needs to set in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours before serving, or the yolk/ mascarpone mixture will be a bit runny.

Absolutely delicious! The only change I made was a slight increase in the amount of coffee/rum mixture used. It is imperative that you make this at least a day before you plan to serve it. It just gets better and better. It comes out beautifully in a 10 inch springform pan.

I didn't drizzle the coffee mixture right, so I doubled it.  I do not recommend doing that, we could only taste the rum.  Overall, fabulous recipe.

Awesome recipe! Only change I made was 1 cup coffee, 4 tablespoons Kaluha. I had never made this before, so I did not know how long to cook the egg yolks. Did it until it had a thicker consistency...about 10-15 minutes. Cooling does help, so make sure not to skip that step.

I tried this recipe for Christmas eve, I followed the reviews and let it set in the fridge for two days before I served it. I doubled on the coffee and rum as recommended. The lady fingers I used were super absorbent- a little too absorbent, they ended up getting a little too soaked, so just sprinkle the coffee and rum over them, don't soak them, that was my mistake. But overall everybody loved it!!  I would make it again especially since I have learned from this experience

OMG! Made this for Christmas dessert, and it was inhaled! I did double the coffee because I had the dry biscuits, and folded the cheese mixture into the whipped cream for ease of layering, but other than that, it's perfect the way it is. Loved it!

I love this recipe! My husband and my friends love my Tiramisu. I already made it 3 times for a party this month and its always a hit. I made a little modifications i used 3/4 cup of regular coffee and 1/4 cup of espresso and dipped each lady fingers on it before layering, i used Kahlua instead of rum and i doubled the cream.

Perfection!!!!!! This is better than anything you can get at any restaurant. I am soooooo greatful for this recipe, it gave my husband a new found respect for my cooking skills :).....best of all, it is super easy to make.  After reading the reviews I did make a few adjustments: doubled the coffee and rum and I left it in the fridge for 48 hours.

This was my first time making Tiramisu. I read through the reviews and omitted the rum. Other than that, I followed the recipe. My suggestion- when making the egg/sugar mixture, make a really strong pot of coffee and let it cool, so it's ready to go when the egg/sugar/cheese is completely cooled. I used a lot of coffee/Kahlua when preparing the ladyfingers. I didn't soak them either, I just rolled them in the liquid. I also folded the cheese together with the whipped cream to eliminate one step and it turned out just fine. This is a beautiful make-ahead dessert that is not too sweet. More sugar can be added to either the whipped cream or the egg/sugar mixture. Enjoy!

This was my first attempt at making tiramisu. I only had Baileys in the cupbord, and it worked out great! I used 6 oz of espresso and 4 oz Baileys. It was a hit!

WOW! Definitely temper the eggs. I heated milk and 1/2 cup sugar first and then tempered the eggs. Then put back on the stove for about 4 or 5 mins. Also used Kaluha instead of rum and mixed 1/2 of the whipped cream into egg mixture and put rest on top. Delish!!! 5 stars all the way. I also made 48 hours ahead. A must!

This is my most requested dessert. I always double the coffee/alcohol (using Kahlua) and wait 24 hours before cutting in to it, per many recommendations. LOVE IT! Easy! (Although I haven't really figured out how to serve it prettily. Suggestions?

This was a good recipe, although I liked the taste and texture better when the cheese custard and whipped cream are blended together.

I had been craving Tiramisu for quite some time so I decided to try this recipe! You've really got to make a STRONG coffee/liquor mixture for this dessert to really shine. I went with a weaker combination for people who don't like the taste of strong coffee that I was serving it to and regretted it because it really would have made this stand out. My fault. Be sure to soak them for an adequate amount of time and to work quickly because they are very fragile. Add 1 tbsp of vanilla extract to the custard mixture (do combine the whipped cream and egg mixture). I also decreased the amount of sugar to a 1/2 cup as I didn't want it to be too sweet (ladyfingers had a sugar crust) and used 1/2 lb of reduced fat cream cheese and 1/2 lb of mascarpone (it's expensive!) and it tasted yummy. Let it sit for 24 hrs and I recommend Disaronno or Kahlua over the rum. :)

My teenage son made this for us.  I loved it.  He did, however, use Franjelico instead of Rum.  Our family doesn't like the taste of Rum...too strong.  It was fabulous.

Absolutely wonderful!  I've never made tiramisu before.  The recipe was easy to follow.  My notes:  I didn't cut the lady fingers in half, I found you needed TRIPLE the liquid for the lady fingers -- and I quickly dipped them in a shallow pan, and I needed to make more whipped cream.  This was also best after at least 24 hours.  FABULOUS flavor - light yet rich.  A true keeper.

Made this for DH's bday and it turned out fantastic!! I used the soft ladyfingers, doubled the espresso, subbed some of the mascarpone for a cream cheese mix, AND used coffee Patrón (tequila) as my liquor. AMAZING!! The cake is not done unless you let it meld together overnight.

This was really yummy! I made it for Sunday dinner with my inlaws and we all loved it! Takes a while to make but definitely worth it! The only changes I made were (based on previous suggestions/reviews): 1. Doubled the rum/coffee  2. Did not refrigerate the egg yolk mixture. Instead I added the mascarpone directly after. It wasn't lumpy at all.  and most importantly: 3. Refrigerated it for 2 days so the flavors blend. The only thing I would warn is it's so filling! You definitely have to watch how much you eat.

I made this recently for a church dinner and people were fighting over it. I also had a true Italian friend there, and she gave it the thumbs up! I went with raters suggestions on doubling the coffee mixture and was very pleased. Without enough "liquid" I think the dessert would be too thick and rich because the ladyfingers do soak up very quickly. I had tiramisu recently at a restaurant before I made this and it paled in comparison. I think it's what inspired me to find a better one.  Excellent recipe!

This recipe even taste better few days later. It gets marinaded in the flavors. Next time I will make sure my coffee is stronger, so I get more of that flavor. I used imitation rum, and it taste like the real thing. Actually imitation has so rum in it, nobody will know the difference. I used a rubber basting brush to drizzle the amount of coffee rum into the lady fingers. Excellant recipe, I've made about 3 times now.

I used this recipe to make tiramisu for the first time, and not only was it easy, but it was delicious! It came out perfectly. My mother-in-law described it as "deadly," which I assumed to be a really good thing. Not something to make every week, but something great for special occasions or a special treat.

YUM!! First of all, I agree with the many people here: double the amount of coffee [or espresso]. Instead of rum, I used coffee liquer. Also, if you're going to use espresso, to increase the amount of liquid, add a little bit of water too. The taste will still be there. I love moist ladyfingers but make sure to not soak them til they drip. If they're soft, it only takes a split second for them to get moist. If you're like me and you don't have a coffee maker, go to Starbuck's and order yourself 12 shots of espresso [or at least that's what I did]. If you don't have an electronic mixer, the Magic Bullet for whipping the heavy cream worked wonders. Great success for my first tiramisu!

My husband greatly enjoyed this for his birthday cake! He always wanted tiramisu and thought this tasted better than in restaurants. I followed the directions, except adding sweetener to the cream/cheese mixture. I used splenda instead of white sugar.

Good.  Next time I will try brushing the coffee/rum mixture instead of drizzling onto the lady fingers.  Drizzling just didn't distribute the flavor well enough.

This was soooo good. I didn't add the rum because I don't like any alcohol. I've made this a few times now, the first time with regular strong brewed coffee (doubled amount) - and the rest of the times with different types of coffee I bought from a Starbucks lol. With their Espresso - it's amazing.

This is the best tiramisu I have ever had. It was very easy to make and impressed everyone at my dinner party. Like other reviewers, I made it 2 days in advance. I used espresso instead of coffee and doubled the rum/espresso mixture. Also added a tbsp granulated sugar to the whipped cream. It turned out perfectly and I wouldn't change a thing next time!

Very good, only giving it 4 stars because I couldn't find mascarpone cheese and thus had to use a cream cheese-sour cream mixture. But still very good, I'll try it again when I get some mascarpone!

This came out really well. I made it in a spring form pan and followed the suggestions of other reviewers to add twice the amount of liquor and coffee. I also kept on stirring the yolk mixture constantly while it boiled and it came out really smooth. I've already made it twice in the past two weeks :)

This was FABULOUS!  I made this for Father's Day and it was a huge hit!!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and used Kahlua instead of rum.  I also basted the lady fingers with the coffee/kahlua mixture instead of drizzling.  I also did not have a 7x11 dish, so I used a smaller one and made 3 layers instead of 2.  Great recipe, thank you!

Wonderful recipe! I tried it with 3 different liqueurs: Rum, Cream de Cacao, & Kahlua. My family & others choose the Rum to be the best. I also doubled the coffee/liqueur mixture and found it to be better. I tried it with home made lady fingers and store bought(soft) and prefer the store bought. Next time I'll try the firmer ladyfingers. I also used espresso rather than strong coffee with better results. I agree that bringing the mascarpone to room temp makes it easier to mix with the egg mixture.

This recipe was fabulous. I doubled the coffee mixture following others' suggestions, but other than that the recipe is perfect as is. I had a diffcult time finding lady fingers at the grocery store, but after circling several aisles, I finally found them in the deli area next to the self serve donuts and bagels. Just a tip to save you some time.

Wow, this was amazing! I got so many compliments! I actually made this as a birthday "cake" for my husband because we aren't as big on actual cake. This was the perfect dessert! I used Kahlua with espresso to soak the ladyfingers in and loved it. I was also surprised at how easy it was to make this, I thought in order to make tiramisu I would need to spend hours and hours working on it! Also, I do highly suggest refrigerating overnight as well to make sure the flavor gets fully infused. I will definitely be making this again!

Wow, there is a reason why this recipe has so many 5-star ratings.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I didn't cut my lady fingers in half.  I just dipped them quickly in the coffee/rum combo and it worked perfectly.  This desert is sinful.  Don't hesitate to prepare it!  My last note would be to chill the cream before whipping it for the sake of ease.  Best of Luck!

Absolutely the best!  I would increase the coffee to 1 cup, keep the rum at 2 tablespoons, and add 2 tablespoons of kahlua.  I brushed this mixture on the ladyfingers when layering in the dish.  I would also increase the whipping cream to 2 cups to make this layer a bit more generous and add a little powdered sugar.  Definitely  try this recipe; you won't be disappointed!!!

Pretty close to popular restaurant tiramisu.  I used soft ladyfingers and froze them a bit.  That made them easier to work with during layering.  I also used strong coffee with about 3 tablespoons of kaulua.  I also added a touch more of sugar which nicely sweetened the marscapone.  You could decrease the milk a bit which I think would make the dish set up a little better.  The marscapone had a pudding like consistency instead of a custard consistency.  Will definitely make this again, especially for a summer cookout.

Wonderful recipe!! I used hard ladyfingers, kahlua instead of rum,  doubled the coffee/kahlua mixture, and dipped the ladyfingers rather than drizzling them with the mixture.  I may even triple the coffee/kahlua mixture next time as my first layer I had soaked more than the second layer and my friends agreed the ones with more of the mixture were great.  I think I will also add one or two tablespoos of sugar to the whipping cream next time to slightly sweeten it.  I did make it 24 hours ahead of time like others recommended.  Wonderful recipe, received tons of compliments.

The great thing about Tiramisu is that is both flavourful and savvy, you don't spend much money doing this treat and yet you get amazing reviews.  Make sure the ladyfingers get really soaked in the coffee as it will provide richness to the overall flavour...yom-mi!!!!

It's only been in the fridge for 2 hours now, but i can already say i really like this tiramisu. It looks good and i could already cut out a piece without it sinking in. I like that you dont need to whip up the eggwhites ( i have plastic bowls). I made a full cup of really strong coffee  and 100 ml of amaretto and poured it on a deep plate to soak the lady fingers in it for a few seconds. It's definately needs much more soaking next time, maybe even more coffee, but i won't be sure untill tomorrow when i can have the true test. I also folded everything together and just made 3 layer out of that. Much easier. Oh, oh and also i didn't split teh lady fingers. Still great tho. 
UPDATE: It definaely need more coffe. A full cup and the 100ml liquor didnt do enough. Maybe because i didnt split the lady fingers, but they had no coffe on the inside of them. We like them soaked/almost mushy and full of coffeeflavour.

AWESOME RECIPE!! I searched this site & others for days looking for a tiramisu recipe that was restaurant quality but still within my abilities - and I found it with this one! I live in a rather small town, over an hour drive to a grocery store that sells mascarpone & lady fingers, so I made the substitute mascarpone (found on this website) and used pound cake cut into 1/4 inch slices and it still turned out WONDERFUL! I will definately be adding this to my favorites!!

THIS RECIPE IS WONDERFUL!!I made it for the first time this week for a sunday school christmas party & it was a HIT! I did not use any alcohol, but I did use the international foods swiss mocha instant coffee, to get the chocolate/coffee flavor. I have tasted many tiramisu's before & this one, even though I made it, still was up there among the best I had ever had. It is by far the BEST recipe ever! It is easy & fairly quick. As with the other reviews, it has to sit overnight for the flavors to blend to get the perfect taste.

Awesome recipe! Minor changes: I made a whole cup of coffee and added 2 tablespoons of kaluha and 2 of amaretto instead of the rum. I completely dunked the ladyfingers so that they would be completely soaked. Also, instead of the cocoa powder, I shaved dark chocolate on top.. YUM!! I would definitely make this again and again..

it was good but it didn't have the exact flavor of tirimisu. what was lacking was the coffe flavor. if anyone makes this you NEED to soak the ladyfingers in the coffee not drizzle them. my boyfriend ate one piece and has not returned fr seconds in the past 3 days which is very unlike him.

I usually dont like Tiramisu (something about soggy ladyfingers doesnt do it for me) but was assigned it for our dinner club.  This recipe actually made it really good!  I just lightly drizzled the ladyfingers so they wouldnt get really wet and used spiced rum since I was out of regular.  I also added a touch of sugar (1/2 cup) to the marscapone cheese b/c I thought it was not at all sweet on its own and was afraid my yolk mixture didnt have enough sugar to compensate.  I also made a little more whipped cream becuase my carton had about 1/4 cup left.   This recipe got RAVE reviews, so I recommend it.

Delicious & easy to make.  Next time, I will double the coffee mixture and use it all because my lady fingers weren't as soaked as I wanted them.  I tried to lay the first section in the coffee mixture to soak, but they almost fell apart.  So, don't be afraid to go overboard on your coffee mixture.  Drizzle away!  Also, this almost didn't fit in my 11x7 dish.  I had to go over the top of the dish.  Next time, I will try to use my triffle dish and see how that might work.  Overall, wonderful though!  Tastes just like the ones I've had in restaurants.

Fabulous recipe. I made it substituting a cream cheese, sour cream, heavy cream mix (a substitute I found listed on the net).  I made it for a potluck lunch at work, it disappeared so fast!  Definately a keeper!

For me, this wasn't perfect but it was delicious.  I've always heard that Tiramisu is 'hard' to make.  That's not the case with this recipe which is very simple.  Keep stirring the egg and sugar mixture as you heat it and that's about the most difficult thing you will deal with.  The recipe calls for the ladyfingers to be drizzled with the coffee & rum mixture (which you will definitely want to double) - I took the advice of some and quickly dunked them instead.  Turned out great (though I had a few that were too soggy and should have been dunked faster).  I may use the pastry brush next time instead of the dunking technique.  Also, there was not nearly enough heavy cream for me so I made an extra batch to put over the top.  Next time I think I will just fold it into the custard like a lot of others suggest.  I made this on Wednesday night and served it on Saturday and it was delicious.  It did not hold together (because of the over-dunked fingers) but not one person cared as the taste was excellent.  Will definitely make this again, and again.

Amazing recipe. I’ve never made or even eaten tiramisu before but this recipe made it easy. The hardest part was getting the custard right, but if you have patience, follow the instructions, and keep stirring it turns out perfect. I added a few tweaks to this recipe, and they seemed to work: I added a little white sugar and (a TINY amount of) almond extract to the whipped cream. I love almond and coffee together so that was a personal thing. I actually quadrupled the coffee mixture and used Kahlua and a dash of vanilla whiskey. I used soft basic Safeway deli brand lady fingers and dunked one side in the mixture before laying them down. I used a baster to coat insides of fingers with excess coffee mixture. I also started off putting lady fingers around the edges inside the springform cause I just didn’t want to deal with putting them on after the cake sets. 

The cake is in the fridge right now and will have about 20 hours to set. My one concern is the ladyfingers will get a little mushy, but I tasted the coffee mix + lady finger combo and it was so yummy I don’t think it’ll matter even if the finger layers are mushy! I plan to add chocolate curls, cocoa powder and raspberries as the finishing touches.

I have never tried to make tiramisu, but I saw this recipe and couldn’t resist. It looked so easy. It was a hit!!!! Absolutely amazing! You do have to read through the comments and make the necessary changes, but if you do, you’ll be pleased. 
First, the comments I saw were saying that the custard mix, yolk/sugar, was runny. They said to get extra mascarpone. The problem is when you do that, you get too much mix. Then you have way too much filling  and no room to cover it with the cocoa on it. So I suggest, as I will do with my next one, to cut down to about 4 egg yolks. And the full pound of mascarpone. 6 yolks is too much. Second, the amount of ladyfingers they say does not cover the dish twice, if you keep them close to each other. I used about 18 ounces or so. Third, I didn’t have rum so I used the extract. It was delicious, but go easy on the extract....a little of that goes a long way!!!! 
I can’t rave about this recipe enough.

The first time I made it I got a little mixed up by the various steps.  Step two should be broken into two steps, a) whipping the cream and b) mixing the mascapone into the eggs.  (I mistakenly mixed the cream into the mascapone. But I regrouped, with the thought that "hey, it’s all yummy food, and will be fine in the end.”  My first attempt had also been complicated by the fact I couldn't find ladyfingers in the store and had to make my own. In the end it was all delicious and got rave reviews.

 The next time I made it I had found storebought ladyfingers but found they were too dry to slice, so I couldn’t split them in two. The extra thickness meant I used more and didn't really have enough liquid to soften them sufficiently. I wish I had read the reviews before that suggested more liquid than the recipe called for. For third and subsequent makings (it’s now a favourite) I had  more expresso/rum to soak them in and people always are very impressed.

And, btw, if you are wondering what to do with the leftover egg whites, they sure make great amaretti!

I was SO nervous to make this recipe. I thought this would hands down be the most difficult dessert ever to make. I even sampled the rum to calm my nerves LOL. It was actually SUPER EASY. This was, oh my gosh the most delicious dessert I have ever had in my LIFE. I followed the recipe exactly - the only thing I did different was use the double boiler method for the egg yolks but I’m sure it would have been fine the saucepan method. I combined the cream mixtures so I just had one big cream mixture because the thought of all that layering stressed me out and it was soooo good all mixed together. Don’t be afraid to dip those lady fingers! I was scared they’d turn out mushy so I just barely got them wet with the coffee mixture and regret it for sure with the end result. Still delicious, though! I made this 2 days ahead so the flavors had time to sit and get extra yummy. I used a 9” spring form pan and a dark chocolate bar for the shavings. Christmas day everyone had 2 slices. It was all gone in 20 minutes!

I followed advice about doubling the coffee and rum mixture and had just enough. I used 1 cup coffee, 2 T run and 2 T Kahula. The custard was simple and absolutely delicious. I did use electric mixer and then put on stove top. Also used electric mixer for the cream and marscapone. Smooth as silk. This is truly fast and easy and is very very good.  Please do make it 2 days in advance.  I put in trifle dish and it was beautiful.  It was a hit at Christmas dinner!  Thanks for this great recipe.

If you enjoy all the steps in a journey, you will NOT be disappointed at the end of this one! One reviewer described this recipe as HEAVENLY, and I agree! I saw it as a winner, having so many 5 star reviews, and easy to follow directions.  So, I made Tirimisu for the first time, using what I would describe as, a highly exceptional recipe! ??  I tweaked two things which were: I made the ladyfingers and marscapone. I also liked one reviewer’s suggestion of, only ‘kissing’ the very bottom layer of  ladyfingers, with the coffee/rum mixture, preventing sogginess.

Well let me tell you, first timer on any tiramisu and I used kahlua. If you choose to, stay with the directions and use coffee as well. I thought I would kill two birds with one stone it being a coffee flavored liqueur. Just use it as your rum and for the love of God add coffee!

This tiramisu recipe is absolutely amazing provided you do the following:
Continue to whisk egg mixture while it boils, then take it off the burner and KEEP whisking it for a couple of minutes before you let it set. Otherwise you will end up with curdled egg - AKA lumpy mixture.
Bring your mascarpone to room temp before trying to whisk it into the egg mixture. 
Use Captain Morgan's spiced rum for the best flavor. It makes a huge difference. Use good quality dark roast coffee. 
Use soft, fresh, spongy ladyfingers. I buy mine at the bakery of my grocery store. 
You will need more coffee and rum mixture for all the ladyfingers. Pour it into a shallow dish and very quickly submerge the ladyfingers one by one, rather than drizzling. It's important they're not too soggy because they will get gritty and break down if too wet.
With all these stipulations, this is the BEST tiramisu you will ever eat.

If I could rate this higher than 5 stars, I would. I pretty much followed this recipe with a few little changes: 
(1) I used a little mixer instead of the whisk (I don't have one) for whipping the cream and vanilla essence together (It still worked!). 
(2) I didn't add the rum (none of my friends drink).
(3) I added a pinch of instant French Vanilla coffee to the mascarpone cheese and egg yolk mixture, as well as two spoons of black coffee (the same one in which I dipped the ladyfingers). The result was tiramisu with the sweetness of sugar and cream blended beautifully with the bitterness of coffee. 
All my friends loved this preparation (made it three times till now), and I can now make this without constantly referring to this recipe, which I have already recommended to a few people. Thank you for this amazing recipe!

I’ve made this dozens of times. It’s a huge hit. I’ve made it based on be recipe but I use some modifications sometimes. 1. I use premade whipped cream 2. I double the coffee and use a bottled cold brew (Starbucks Dark) substituting rum for vanilla extract. 3. I’ve also made it in small individual cups using nilla wafers instead of ladyfingers and added a raspberry on top.

Fantastic! I’ve made this several times and those who “don’t like tiramisu” seem to enjoy this. I also double the coffee/liquor mix and use Kahlua or Frangelico instead of rum. I make it the day before as suggested.

Ok. So this is my favorite desert to make ever.  I could eat the entire thing by myself so I'm only allowed to make our note if I bring it in to work with me.  The only clarification s I would make is that the egg mixture should be made over a washer bath.  I tried without the first time and ended up mostly with scrambled eggs.  Now once it starts to thicken up pretty thick I remove it to low  heat directly on the burner, low boil while stiring constantly for a minute then cool it in the fridge. For me this ous what takes the longest.  I may just be paranoid  now but the thickening process takes me almost 30 min. I also find I like better with twice as much coffee. I don't use liquor, just double concentrated instant coffee. And let it sit at least overnight in the fridge.

Made twice -- once to test. I actually made the recipe into about 24 small plastic cups as single serve desserts for a shower, then topped with chocolate covered espresso beans. Big hit! Like other reviewers suggested, I increased the amount of rum and coffee. Can't wait to make again but in one dish -- the cups turned out great but was a little tedious (my own fault!).

The only bad thing about this recipe is that I ate almost all of it. Too good to resist. Definitely double the coffee and rum, I did that and still feel like I could’ve used even more! Will make again... and again :)

This was great, but next time, I will add more alcohol and coffee.  I would prefer to quick dip the lady fingers.  The taste was great, but it was a little dry in places.

Some great things about Tiramisu II. 1) The lady fingers and mascarpone amounts are in amounts and packaging that are easily found in a regular grocery store. 2) It's easy and delicious. 
Next time I would, as other reviewers have suggested, doubled the coffee and rum and soaked the ladyfingers more thoroughly, but even without doing that, I got raves from my guests!  Thanks!

I made this just like the recipe except for the rum. I used Amaretto. Excellent! The only thing I would recommend if using store bought ladyfingers is to let them stay out of the package over-nite so they can dry out a little.They soak up the liquid immediately if used right from the package. I ended up spooning the coffee/amaretto mixture over the cookies. The recipe doesn't say whether to split the ladyfingers or keep them whole. Since I really haven't used them before, I did split them. Maybe that's why they soaked up the liquid really fast? I looked up making them myself & they really aren't hard to do. Might try that the next time. But, all in all, it was deeeelishious!

Fantastic. The flavors are all so amazing, and everything's perfect. Haven't made a Tiramisu before, but this turned out beautifully. :) I think my only problem was over mixing. I had to make two batches of the custard because I had over mixed. One was over mixed and the other was average mixed. Personally I didn't think that it made a difference, but I think that the texture was a bit more separated. Considering I'm 12, this was extraordinary:)

The whipped cream recipe should have been 1.5 - 2x what was listed (with a small bit of sugar) and there was too much marscarpone filling.  Splitting the cookies is also a bad idea, as you'll either come up with crumbly cookie or a mushy mess.    The taste is fair, but I wouldn't call this tiramisu.

I doubled the coffee, then doubled the whole recipe because we don't play with small pans in this house.
Also used cream cheese (cheaper & also, my mom used it growing up & my mom is always right).

I love tiramisu, but had never made one before. I was sceptical about the outcome, but this recipe did not let me down. It turned out fantastic!  I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan. I'll defiantly be making this again!

Was delicious however I soak my cookies in a 1/3 cup run, 1/3 cup  Kaluha ad 1/3 cup espresso.

Also I do not cook and I fold an egg white /sugar mixture into the yolk/marscapone, sugar/ rum mixture.  

I place in the fridge for 8 hours.

Not a dessert for children or if you are driving but delicious...

I am giving this  4 until I make it, basing the score on comparables to other recipe sources.  Will re-review once I have made it.

What can I possibly add to the 950+ reviews?   This was superb; most definitely a restaurant quality dessert, if not BETTER!   I made it 48 hrs in advance and followed the recipe almost exactly.   Because I used soft ladyfingers from the bakery, I didn't dip them and then put them in the serving dish -- I just put them (split) into the dish and poured the coffee/rum mixture over top, for both layers.   For 6 oz. of ladyfingers, I used about 1 cup coffee and 4 Tbsp rum.  This is something I plan to add to the holiday menu.   Outstanding!   Thank you, Christine!

I've gotta agree: WOW!!!! I made this for Father's Day (it's his favorite and it was his special dessert request). I've never made tiramisu before (and I've only made custard once before) and this turned out absolutely perfect!! I was a bit short on time so I was only able to make it one day ahead, and it was DELICIOUS! Everyone (especially my dad) raved about it! I'm even more excited to know it's just gonna get better the next couple days (if it lasts that long! haha) Took other reviewers advice and tripled the coffee/rum (o used Kahlua in the place of rum just because I had it on hand) and added a Tsp of sugar to the whipped cream. I also used a mixer to add the mascarpone to the egg custard, came out velvety smooth! I can't say enough how decadent and gorgeous this was!! I made a quick raspberry sauce (pint of raspberries simmered in a simple syrup of 1c water and 1c white sugar, boiled gently til the berries broke down and it reduced a little bit to the desired consistency). Drizzled it over the top, dusted it with cocoa right before serving.   A++++!!! If you're looking for a fantastic tiramisu recipe, look no further! Yum!

I am not a tiramisu person, really, but my husband definitely IS, so I sallied forth into tiramisu territory and started testing recipes.  This one is bang on - far better than any local restaurant version - WITH a few changes.  Per the other reviews, I doubled the coffee mixture (and tripled the liquor); I changed the rum to Kaluha; can't find the crispy ladyfingers in my area, so use the soft ones from the bakery section of my grocery store; I place them in the serving dish and then drizzle (generously) the coffee mixture; and I replace the cocoa with microplaned frozen dark chocolate(freezing the chocolate bar first gives you tiny little curls of chocolate; As for combining the gooey layers, I've done both and prefer the separate layers. I agree with other reviewers that ingredients have to be fresh, but since this is a pricey dish to prepare at best, I decided to go a step further and use all organic ingredients.  End result? Heavenly - and much requested by friends and family.

Great recipe. I combined the custard/mascarpone with the whipped cream, so it's one layer rather than individual layers. And instead of cocoa powder, I grated dark chocolate on the top. Also I added a layer of mini chocolate morsels in the middle.

I loved this recipe. After having tiramisu at my favorite vegetarian restaurant, I decided to try it at home. What this recipe does not specify is to use fresh ingredients. My eggs and milk were a little old so it curdled and just didn't smooth out the custard. It turned out a little rough (to say the least)but edible (but just for myself) I will do better next time and have a smoother pudding, then maybe I will share.

This is delicious!  I read the other reviews.  I decided to mix the mascarpone mixture with the whipped cream instead of layering it.  It worked out just fine.  I will definitely make this again. I eliminated the rum and made a couple special cups for my kiddos.  They LOVED it too!

Great recipe, very easy.  The only thing I would change is instead of soaking the ladyfingers in a bowl, I would take a spritzer and spray the ladyfingers.  There's not a lot of liquid and I found some bites did not have an evenly distributed flavor of the coffee/rum mixture.

I didn't soak the ladyfingers, I dipped them quickly on both sides and I found no reason to split the ladyfingers in half.  The "custard" was too sweet, the whip cream too bland, and I didn't get the smooth, creamy, fluff I should have

This recipe has been a hit every time I've made it.  Instead of ladyfingers, which I cannot find locally, I use sliced pound cake.  This recipe is easy to make and tastes delicious!

Amazing. I made it twice and the first time it was awesome the second time it was really loose and watery, I followed the same procedure as the first time (leaving it in the refrigerator for 2 nights) but I don't know what happened. Does anyone know what I did wrong? It was still amazing just the presentation was lacking

This is the only tiramisu recipe I trust, I've tried many and this is the real deal! My Italian family agrees, the only thing I change is using fresh brewed espresso instead of regular coffee, it's the stronger and the way it was intended. I also discovered when my mixer broke that substituting cool whip in a pinch will work if you have no other options.

This is the real deal, folks.  Not sweet, but oh so rich.  This is an expensive cake to make.  I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9 x 13 pan.  Approx cost - $40.00.  But it was delicious for several days.  The second time I made it on a Wednesday for a Friday evening dinner party.  Yum!

I have made tiramisu from several different recipes and this one is probably the best I've tried. My only change was that I doubled the amount of coffee/liquor based on other reviews and used Grand Marnier instead of rum(just my preference). And as others have said, you really should let it sit for a day or two because the flavors meld so much better. The difference was day and night between day 1 and day 2. My whole family loved it and I'll definitely make this again!

Amazing. 
I made this for my sister in law. She is nine months pregnant, so I summer the coffee with decaf and the rum extract in place of the rum. Its perfection, she's one happy mommy to be!
I can not wait to make the grown up version for my self.

Excellent. Needs more coffee in my opinion. (It's possible that the coffee I used simply wasn't brewed strong enough though. (Though I did brew it at 1.5x strength already...))

Came out great! I used Kahlua instead of the rum as I believe that it has better flavor and added a dash of hazelnut extract. My BF loved it!

This is the best tiramisu ever! Not too sweet and both light and rich. I was nervous to cook the eggs as directed, so I  beat the eggs and sugar until pale and fluffy, then heated the milk and tempered the eggs with the hot milk. Then I put it all in the pan and boiled gently for a minute. No scrambled eggs. Also I dipped the ladyfingers in the coffee/rum mixture instead of drizzling. Was so good, even my boss, who is a french chef, loved it.

I changed the serving size to 18 and it fit a standard oblong cake pan perfectly.  I took it to a dinner party last night and people could not stop raving about this, saying it was better than the restaurant version.  The only changes I made were to triple the coffee/kahlua mixture.  Added a bit more Kahlua than the recipe calls for.  I used the hard ladyfingers.  Just dip the non sugar side in the coffee mixture for a few seconds that quickly place sugar side down in the pan.  The coffee mixture will drip down through the whole cookie.  I will be making this often and everyone wants the recipe.  Thanks for posting.

I tried this recipe and I loved it! Absolutely amazing! I have made some slight changes to it though:
1) (Optional) Since I wanted an alcohol free tiramisu, I substituted the rum with a tablespoon of extra coffee and another tablespoon of milk
2) In the video, it said to soak the ladyfingers by dipping them into the coffee. I know how easily these biscuits get soggy so instead, I placed the ladyfingers in the tray and then drizzled the coffee on top of them.
3) Be sure to let the finished tiramisu set in the fridge for at least 24 hours to let the flavours merge together

Overall, though, by far the best tiramisu recipe ever.

This was THE BEST recipe!  You really have to allow it to settle for at least 24 hours if not 2 full days before you eat it.  All the ingredients really come together beautifully.  I use the soft kind of lady fingers and I also use 1 full cup of good coffee (the cheap stuff is usually more acidic) and 1/2 cup Kahlua.  I dip some of the lady fingers in the coffee/Kahlua mixture, but not all; I don't want them too soggy - The rest I brush it on and then drizzle whats left. I don't add the cocoa to the top until right before it is served - it can get soggy.  Thank you Christine!

This recipe turned out great. Although I did add 2 T of sugar to the whipped cream mixture because it tasted pretty awful without any sugar! You could probably add a little bit more depending on your taste. I also subbed Kahlua for rum and used espresso for the coffee. I made my own ladyfingers to go with which is a must. All in all a great recipe!

AWESOME recipe!!! Simply the best. Like others, I double the coffee/rum portions and let it sit in the fridge overnight (AT LEAST 12 hours). My daughter has requested this recipe for her birthday for the past 3 years. DO NOT skimp on the ingredients or go "low fat"... do as the recipe says and enjoy one of the best tiramisu's you'll ever have.

Flawless recipe. I used a 9x13 form and for that you need exactly 1 1/2 ingredients. The 48hr wait until it was ready to eat were the most excrutiating 48 hrs ever, but they were well worth it. Absolutely fantastic!

This recipe was awesome! However, I think the rum is probably too much because I had to let it sit even longer than 2 days for the strong liquor taste to really go away. After 3 days, it was heavenly, the rum tasted really nice. I even added some skinned chocolate on top and a piece of Hershey's milk chocolate just to make it look more legit. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Absolutely loved this dessert.  Basically no reason why you can't sweeten it to your liking even for non-professional cooks like myself.  I liked it just the way it was.

WOW! I had been reading reviews for weeks before i tried it for my husband's birthday. I made it 48 hours in advance and I was SO worried it wasn't going to set. It came out FLAWLESS. No one but my believed it wasn't store bought. As the pic shows, I didn't get a chance to get a pic of it whole... and its disappearing SO quickly. i will DEFINITELY make this again. THANK YOU!!!

Tastes good. I had to triple the coffee-rum mixture and double the whipped cream, but it's a great cake. I didn't use the vanilla extract because I couldn't find it anywhere. 8/10

Made this on the weekend for company and everyone LOVED it!!! I did make a few changes. I double the coffee and rum amounts like suggested by others. I did not Split ladyfingers in half lengthwise and I'm glad I didn't. I may also try adding more next time.  I also soaked the lady fingers in the coffee rum mixture instead of drizzling them. It was great 5 hours after I made it and even better the next day.

Not so good as I hoped.  The mascarpone mixture was too heavy and for me taste like a cheese cake. But overall not so bad.

I've made this tiramisu three times now and it has never failed.  One thing I have found is that you need much more coffee (I make about 2 cups and  skip the liqueur). I use the hard biscuit like lady fingers and quickly dunk them in a bowl with a generous amount of coffee.  And I let it sit in the fridge overnight to set.  Works brilliantly every time.  One of these days I make this in a springform pan to make it extra fancy (likely need another package of lady fingers to due the outside surround).

Amazing! Used biscottis dipped in dark chocolate since I couldn't find lady fingers. Doubled the espresso and rum and added some Disorono. The cookies added some texture. It was fantastic!

I use Khalua instead of rum and beat the egg whites and add to mascarpone mixture for extra lightness.

As a Tiramisu fan, I must say that this is the best recipe ever. I made it three times and received lots of compliment. However I must agree with other reviewers that the amount of coffee and rum should be at least doubled. Just make sure you soak the ladyfingers. Otherwise, perfect

I really enjoyed this tiramisu BUT the lady fingers were way too soggy! I took the advice of my fellow allrecipes members and doubled the coffee/liquor mixture and dipped the lady fingers instead of drizzling on top. Bad idea... My suggestions, Next time I will double only the coffee, not the rum. It was too "rummy" for my liking. I thought if I had too much cake I'd get drunk lol! I didn't use VERY strong coffee though. Also, I will only dip the lady fingers for a second! Definitely don't let them sit in the liquid mixture more than a second or two! It absorbs way too much, that's why everyone's having to double or triple their coffee/rum mixture. Trust me, you'll avoid the soupy mess in the bottom of the pan if you follow these instructions. Besides those alterations, I'd stick to the rest of the recipe AS IS. It was delicious! Oh, I almost forgot... I did let it sit in the fridge for 24 hours before sinking my teeth in it. Other members suggested the longer you let it sit, the more amazing the flavor gets; I'd have to agree! I'm on Day two and its even more delicious! Thanks for the recipe Christine ;)

I added sugar to the whipped cream. Definitely needed more coffee mix than the recipe called for. Went to Starbucks and got six shots of espresso, mixed with two airplane bottles of Kahlua. Delicious!

This recipe was great!! I followed everything except the drizzling of the lady fingers... I dip the lady fingers into instant espresso with about 2tbs chocolate coffee patron!! YUM! They get nice and soft and full of flavor! This came out the bomb in my 9x13 pan!

This recipe was great! I tripled the coffee/rum mixture because I used hard ladyfingers and dipped them into the mixture to soak up more liquid.  I didn't add any sugar to the whipped cream and I thought the tiramisu was sweet enough. I let the tiramisu sit overnight and sprinkled it with cocoa right before serving.  This was delicious and I'll definitely make it again!

I have fooled around with a few different tiramisu recipes.  I won't be experimenting any longer, this is hands down the best I have tried (or tasted anywhere, for that matter).  Followed the recipe exactly.  As others have said, next time I would double the coffee/rum amount, it was a bit skimpy.

I was always afraid to even attempt to make Tiramisu. This recipe had so many positive reviews, I thought I would give it a try. I am so glad I did....It came out fabulous!!!! I actually trippled the coffee rum mixture based on several reviews. Very very easy. It was delicious!!

Amazing recipe. I found "tiramisu mascarpone cheese" at the grocery store, and I wasn't going to buy it, but it was on sale. Anyway, I made this the afternoon of the event that I served it. It was a little loose at first (because my boyfriend came home from his night shift job and announced that I was to make a dessert to take along to a party), but the flavors were amazing -- possibly attributable to the coffee flavoring in the cheese that sped up the "blending" of flavors that usually takes overnight in the fridge. It ended up setting perfectly later into the evening, and I'm really glad that we have a few leftovers because I am in love with this recipe!

I'm an Italian food lover and an absolute beginner and I thought I would mess this up. I made only half the recipe to avoid bigger mess. But I Succeeded! My husband loved it very much. His first reaction was "MMMMMMM". To be honest, that was my first reaction too :) The only change I made was double the espresso like everyone says (in my case I use the same amount for half the recipe)

My boss is italian and was talking about how good Tiramisu is.I had never made or tried it. So I looked up this recipe and prepared it (I like that you cook the egg mixture). It was sooo good. I tried several substitutions on my next attempts as I live in a small town and cannot always get the ladyfingers or mascarpone. However, the original recipe was by far the best but if you really need a Tiramisu fix and can't find all the ingreds.the subs will do. You can use pound cake in place of ladyfingers and cream cheese with a little butter and heavy cream in place of the mascarpone. I did sprinkle bitter sweet chocolate shavings on top of them all and it gave them a pleasant but not overbearing chocolate taste. And my boss and co-workers absolutly loved it. I have made 10 throughout the holidays and it dissappears as fast as I can make it. Yumm!

Great recipe.  I didn't have a 7x11 pan so used a 9x13.  It worked ok but the layers of the mascarpone custard and whipped cream were a little thin.  Next time I will either make larger quantities or use a smaller pan.  It made for a lighter, fluffier Tiramisu than the more dense typical.  I used an electric mixer to mix the yolks and sugar until it was thick and then when cool used same mixer to add cheese.  Everyone enjoyed it and said "it wasn't too sweet."  Definitely could taste the various flavors of coffee, rum and mascarpone.   I will make it again.

Outstanding! I only changed the rum for kahlua and increased it to 4 Tbsp instead of 2. This was the best tiramisu I've ever had! Thank you!

Amazing!  I have made this several times.  A few tweaks...
Bake the lady fingers at 250 degrees for 7 minutes to dry them.
Use instant coffee for a strong taste (You will need at least 8 oz.)
Mix the whipped cream w/ the cheese layer ( I substituted 1/2 of the marscapone w/ full fat ricotta, and it was amazing.)
Mandatory 24 hour wait for the best flavor!

I tried out this recipe during last Saturday.  Overall result is not very successful.  As the mascarpone and yolk is too watery, I did chill it for more than an hour in the pot cover with the lid.  I used expresso and it tast bitter.

I've been making my tiramisu cake several times already, following this recipe. Instead of using espresso, I use the instant mocca coffee mixed with kahlua. It's just sooo yummy and everybody in my family loves it! Absolutely a keeper!

This is by far the most requested recipe in my arsenal.  I recently made lady fingers from scratch to see how it works the next time I make this. The recipe needs no improvement but why not give making the cookies from scratch a whirl.

I made this for my husband and he absolutely LOVED IT!  He prides himself on a bit of Tiramisu connoisseur and devoured the entire pan (sized 13 x 9) in three days!  The only rum I had in the house was white Bicardi rum, next time I'll try it with Captain Morgan's dark run.  

Recommendations: 
- Have it sit overnight; it definitely soaked up more of the flavors
- Use an electric hand mixer to ensure a smooth texture and achieve a balanced flavor (it'll even out all the ingredients)

Thank you for the recipe... TOTAL HIT! :)

LOVED IT!  It was easy.  I used a Trifle Dish and used more ladyfingers (Lined the inside of bowl with upright finger)  I agree with folding the two mixtures together.  I did not this time but will next time.

The first tiramisu I have ever tried making at home and it was perfect ...used cherry liqueur and doubled the the coffee-liqueuer mix quantity....Strongly suggest making this 2 days in advance. Ate most of it the next day ...and it was great but ate the leftover after 2-3 days and it was absolutely awesome (understatement!)

Soooooo rich but sooooo good!  I made it exactly as described in the recipe.  I had trouble finding ladyfingers but finally found them by speaking to the bakery - they were kept frozen behind the counter.  I did also read online that pound cake or angel food cake would also do well.  Ladyfingers felt like the consistency of angel food cake and I think I’ll sub that for actual ladyfingers next time.  Also, the mascarpone cheese was rather expensive and I went to 2 different grocery stores looking for it!  I should have called first.  In retrospect, the mascarpone filling is extremely rich so I plan on halving the recipe for the filling component which will make it a) cheaper and b) more edible (did I mention how rich this dessert is?)  Using angel food cake I’m going to double the amount of “ladyfingers.”  Definitely double the coffee/rum mixture as suggested by others.  I’m also going to layer these in wine glasses and chill overnight for little individual desserts.  There are some great presentation ideas online.

This recipe was phenomenal! This was my first attempt of making tiramisu and it was absolutely fabulous! The only thing I did differently was dip the lady fingers in the coffee and rum. I also kept adding coffee and rum because it runs outs so quick, you definitely need to triple that. But otherwise it was amazing, will definitely make again.

This is a perfect recipe.  Not too sweet.  I personally add a bit of Cassis Liqueur to my coffee and rum.  It enhances the flavor of the two and gives it a edge.  Guests just can't figure it out.  
Also-this is a perfect base for doing a red berry tiramisu too.... The ideas are endless....  Thanks!

Great recipe! All aspects were great! I tried subtle changes, vanilla bean paste in the whipped cream and instead of 2 T. Rum I used 1T Rum and 1T Tuaco. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best Tiramisu ever....I loveddd it....I baked my own cookies since i couldnt find any in the store and it turned out great....
I made only few changes...Instead of using rum, i used Apple Juice (since i drink alcohol) and doubled the amount of coffee and instead of making a layer of whip cream, i took half of the whip cream and fold it in the cheese mixture....other than that i followed the exact recipe...

I love tiramisu and have eaten it in Italy, so I am a tough critic. This recipe was the first I ever tried to make my very own, and (after following tips to double coffee/rum mixture) I can officially give it my seal of approval. I'm so happy I found this!

This was the first time I ever made tiramisu and I will definitely make it again using this recipe. Although it was difficult, I waited 24 hours to eat it and it was definitely worth the wait. The flavors were much richer and blended then they were the day I made it. As others suggested, I also doubled the coffee/rum mixture. I could only find the hard ladyfinger cookies at the grocery store, and they worked just fine. I think doubling the coffee/rum mixture helped soften them so that it would not be crunchy. Next time I will make it in a smaller pan with more layers so that there's more to each bite. I will definitely be making this again soon!

I had never made Tiramisu before. This was so easy to make and is incredibly delicious. My husband's birthday is this week and he has asked me to make 2. This is definately my favorite recipe to make and eat.

Fantastic and easy to make. I made the lady fingers from scratch through this site also. Check it out especially since it can be difficult at times to find lady fingers

Excellent recipe. Taking tips from others: definitely double the coffee mix, combine the yolk mix and milk mix together, dip the cookies for a couple seconds on the no sugar/flat side and then place in your dish with the flat side up so the liquid will go through the whole cookie. Changes I made: sprinkle powdered sugar in between layers. I also made sure that I LIKED the way the coffee mix tasted. I didn't want anything bitter so I added Kahlua, sugar and Godiva White Choc liquor. The last change I made was to add a layer of chocolate and coffee buttercream to the top. I know this is not a common thing to do, but it sent this dessert over the top. Made it the night before and iced it right before serving.

This is the best tiramisu I've had. The recipe is so easy to follow. I doubled the coffee/rum mixture and soaked each ladyfinger for 3-5 sec on each side. You definitely need to keep it in the fridge overnight. The flavors really sink in.

Delicious! We are glad we had a couple cups of coffee because 1/4 cup was not enough. My husband thinks it is a little too sweet, but I think it's just right. Thank you for this recipe! We will be making this, again!

This is a wonderful recipe. I fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture in step two. I also layer this in a trifle bowl for a beautiful presentation.

Everyone loved this. My first time making tiramisu and I like this recipe. The only thing I did different was I accidently mixed the whipped cream in with the egg mixture, so I just mixed it all together and it was great.

I LOVE tiramisu and was always intimidated by making it on my own ....until I stumbled upon this recipe! It was not difficult at all and it was absolutely perfect!  Very rich and delicious!  My own word of advice is that the lady fingers soak up the coffee/rum mixture FAST, so literally a second on each side is sufficient.  It came out suburb!

Made this recently for a dinner party and it went down an absolute treat.  Doubled up on the coffee-dipping  mixture - you definitely need to.   If you are making a Tiramisu this is the recipe for sure - gorgeous!

Got lots of raves.  I fooled advice and prepared 2 days ahead.  We don't drink coffee, so I didn't know what "strong" coffee was.  i just went by the instructions on the bag and used 2 Tablesppons ground decaf coffee to 6 oz. of water.  I doubled the rum/coffee mixture, as advised.  I put mine in a 9x13 pan, as the plastic wrap used to cover it wouldn't touch the top of the cake in a larger pan.  Several people said it was the best they had tasted!

I wanted to try this recipe because I've never tried custard in a tiramisu.  I didn't like it.  The coffee flavor just wasn't strong enough and the custard texture I felt didn't belong, but my husband devoured it! He ate the whole thing himself in a span of 3 days so I'm glad it didn't go to waste.

After reading several reviews I decided to try this recipe for my SIL's Birthday Party.  Glad I chose this one, it was delicious!  Took the advice from others and doubled the coffee and the rum.  Made in a 10-inch Springform pan, came out perfect....although next time I will use a 3rd package of ladyfingers to surround the edges of the tiramisu in the pan.

I made Tiramisu for the first time using this recipe for New Year's Eve. It was absolutely delicious. Everyone raved about it. I used Kaluah instead of rum and needed double the amount of coffee. I used the hard lady fingers and dipped them in the coffee, perfect texture and flavour! Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I used a 9 by 13 dish and it filled it to the top, the only suggestion I would make would be to up the cream to one and a half cups, otherwise this recipe is perfect!

WOW! I've made this 5 times in the last 2 months, and fall more in love with it every time! I followed other reviewer instructions and let it sit for 24 hours before my first bite, and it got better every day (although it only lasted 3 days).

This was very good--with a few adjustments.  I used 1/4 c of rum, 1-2 cups strong coffee (don't have an espresso machine) and grated chocolate for top.  Also, I didn't bother soaking the ladyfingers.  I just laid them in the pan and drizzled the liquid over them and it worked great.

Love Love this recipe...this is my first time making Tiramisu and I was a little nerveous serving it to my guests before testing it. It was a hit and got a lot of great comments. I followed the receipe but doubled the coffee and rum. I kept it in the fridge for over 24 hours and it was yummy. Thanks

i made tiramisu for the first time and my guests LOVED this recipe !  to use a non-alcohol rum substitute I boiled molasses in a little water and a few drops of vanilla on the stove, then added 2 spoons of that to 2 shots of espresso for the liquid.  I increased the sugar slightly (added half a 1/3 cup of sugar) I also used lady fingers that had chocolate filling - the chocolate added some crispiness and was a little surprise for the guests - they loved it - the brand is milano's. Also i mixed all ingredients together ( the yolk mixture and the whipped cream mixture) before I layered.  amazing recipe !

I made this for the first time for Christmas and made it the day before. It was a huuuuuge hit. I used brandy instead of the rum and only made it with one layer of lady fingers and then spread all of the yolk mixture on top of it and let it sit for 1 hour before adding the whipped cream. What little we had left over 2 days after making it was great. One of our friends said it was better than the restaurant one she normally gets. i will be making this again.

This was my first time ever making tiramisu, and it was a bit hit with my family. It was pretty easy to make, too. I had a somewhat larger pan, so I needed a little more of the whipped cream and coffee/rum mixture. And if I do it again, I think I'll leave the ladyfingers whole instead of splitting them in half. It came out great, though. My sister doesn't like tiramisu and she liked this recipe!

it is the best tiramisu I have ever had, and the recipes takes a while but it is soooo easy.  Five stars all the way.  Marscarpone cheese was easy to find too, it was at dominicks and trader joes, and lady fingers were in the bakery at domincks.  Great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe. I did also whip the egg whites and add to the cheese mixture. Yes, the ingredients are expensive, but if there is one near you, you can find the marscapone and soft lady fingers at Trader Joe's. I doubled the recipe to send to my husband's potluck so I needed 2 lbs of marscapone and that cost $9 and $5 for 2- 5oz boxes of french-made lady fingers. It's delish though and the way that it's supposed to be. More often than not I'm disappointed with what I get in restaurants.

Wonderful! I made this for my dad's birthday, and he said it was better than any tiramisu he had ever eaten! I couldn't find mascarpone or lady fingers. Made Lady fingers from this site, and substituted 2 Pkgs Cream Cheese, 1/2 Cup of Heavy Cream and 5 Tablespoons of sour cream for Mascarpone. That substitution worked great!

I gave it 4 stars because the 'egg and mascarpone' part were very firm to bite even after it's been refrigerated for 2 days. And since i've had other Tiramisu before I don't remember that part being dense and firm but soft and moist. Also, as seen on the photo I've posted I added too much Cocoa Powder for decoration purposes and had to scrape out some on my slice since it was too bitter for my taste. Other than that, it was pretty good and best part was my Husband and Mother in law loooved it!

Delicious! and Easy!  My daughter gave me an A+ and the hubby said it could not have been any better! I did not have a 7X11 dish so I used a 9 X 13 used 50% more lady fingers and 3X the coffee/rum blend and it turned out Great!  Could have used more whipping cream but it was great the way it was.

Absolutely fabulous! Brought this to an Eat, Pray, Love party where everyone was to bring a food from one of the 3 countries. It was the hit of the party! As many people mentioned, it's best made in advance. My mom, a gourmet cook, called as soon as she sampled it and said, "Oh, Karen! I know this is Italian, but it was so good it tasted like it came from a little French bakery! It was THAT good!"

Other than the lacking coffee flavor, this is an easy and fail-proof recipe for tiramisu.  Next time I will triple the amount of coffee and maybe use espresso instead.  I used 8 oz. mascarpone and 8 oz. cream cheese with great results.

This recipe is really amazing. It is relatively easy to make and tastes great. My dinner guests were impressed. Make sure to let it set at least 24-48 hours before serving.  My only issue was the egg yolk-sugar mixture. I went through 24 eggs trying to get this right. It's nearly impossible to boil egg yolks without cooking them. Even my final version had teen tiny bits of cooked egg. I would have liked instructions on what the texture should be. Can anyone help with this? Thanks. Great recipe!

Amazing!  Everyone loved it, it got better the second day and probably would have been better the third but there wasn't any left!  Only change I made was instead of rum using Kahlua as suggested by other reviewers.

follwing the directions/ingredients, here are my opinions 1.my custard was  a little grainy. (i kept stirring when cooking over LOW heat.)  maybe next time i will simmer on low heat and heat until thickened without bringing to a boil. 2. doubling the coffee and liqueur. 3. reduce sugar because my family don't have a sweet tooth. 4.mix whipped cream with custard.

This was my first attempt at Tiramisu.  This recipe was easy, and the results were excellent. I made a few changes, based on other reviews, and what I had available in the house.  I combined the whipped cream and custard mixture, and I would suggest this, as I thought they tasted better combined.  I used the hard ladyfingers, as that was what I could find.  I used Starbucks Doubleshots and added dark rum.  The Doubleshots are a combo of espresso and cream, and really give the tiramisu a strong coffee flavor.  I ended up using about 3 6.5 oz cans.  I made 2 9 x 9 pans of this with this recipe.  I didn't know Tiramisu was so easy! Wish I had found this recipe years ago! I love that the egg is cooked, no worries about Salmonella! Thank you for sharing this, I will be making again and again!

EXCELLENT!!!  I placed tiramisu into 2.5" foil cupcake cups (paper cups are too flimsy) and refrigerate in muffin pans to keep its figure; makes about 30.  I used 2/3 of one ladyfinger for each ladyfinger layer.      Other adjustments:   1) I substituted cream cheese for mascarpone cheese  2) Add the cream cheese to the yolk mixture after it has been cooked (hot yolk mixture will melt the cream cheese)  3) After cooling the yolk & cheese mixture in the frige, fold the mixture into the whipped cream  4) Drizzle the coffee onto the ladyfinger with a spoon  5) Dust cocoa before serving

I made this to take to dinner at my parents request. It turned out fantastic. The only change I made was that I omitted the rum and doubled the coffee and I made my own ladyfingers (recipe on this site) It turned out great and everyone loved it...this will be my go to tiramisu recipe :)

This is the tiramisu recipe!  I've tried another one on here because it had more reviews but this one has a better star rating.  I had nothing leftover, this recipe was perfect.  I did double the coffee and I used every last drop.  I had nothing left over, even ladyfingers were all used up.  This tiramisu is even better than the one  I usually buy from a fancy bakery.  It's cheaper to make this than buy the cake in store. Love it!

Mine looked beautiful but tasted very bland. That may have been my fault for not soaking the ladyfingers long enough. I was afraid they'd get soggy. I might try again and REALLY soak in the coffee liquer - but we'll see. It's a bit expensive to "try" a second time considering I was not too impressed.

I never knew Tiramisu is so easy to make!  I've made this recipe twice, the second time I doubled the liquid mixture as suggested by other reviewers.  Tasty both times.  Thanks!

Tiramisu is my favorite dessert and I have tried many different recipes...so far this one is the best! Instead of brewed coffee, I use espresso bought from a local coffee shop to give a stronger coffee flavor.

Delicious and rich.  My Edits: Doubled the rum & tripled the coffee.  Substituted cream cheese for the mascarpone since it's sooo easy to find.  Also substituted the ladyfinger cookies, also difficult to find, for Viena Finger Cookies.  I just scraped out the cream and used about 2/3 of the package.  Will definitely make again, and again.

First off, I have to say this is the best Tiramisu recipe here! It's awesome!! I have made this 5 times in the last month! I found chocolate espresso from a local cafe that I use, and it's great. Used dark rum the first couple of times, and it was good, but now I use Frangelico, which I think tastes better. Better than most restaurant Tiramisu I have tried. But I have to disagree with a previous reviewer that said the hard ladyfingers don't work. YES, THEY DO WORK!!!I have used the hard ladyfingers every time and it turns out perfect! What I do is dip the ladyfinger in the espresso mixture halfway, place it in the dish and brush a little more on each ladyfinger. I even made this at the cafe I get the espresso from so she could sell it as one of her desserts, and everybody wants it on her menu! It's an awesome dessert!! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

This is better than I can rate it. Tiramisu is my favorite deseret ever. I made this for Christmas and my father told me I never had to buy it again I could make it from now on it is better than any he had eaten. I'm making it again on New Years day for the Fenway Park hockey game party.. I made some changes after reading reviews I was really worried about it being to wet but it was not I used 3 x's the coffee and 2 x's the rum, dipping each lady finger seperate than let the excess run out and layed in the pan. Perfect. I made 2 days before I served it was perfect. This is the best receipe for Tiramisu on here I have discarded the others I have. Thank you for sharing. I still can not believe how easy it was to make and so delicious my mouth is watering now just thinking about how fabulous it is. Thanks again.

So easy and so yummy! I only rated this as a 4 star since I think that the recipe should double the amount of coffee/rum mixture.  Try using an Americano coffee w/ extra espresso, yummy and tasty. I've also tried using the harder Italian ladyfingers, and these don't work out as well. They don't absorb the coffee and they are crunchy. You need to find the ladyfingers that are more cakey and yellow.  I could only find them at our local Albertson's. That might not be the 'traditional' type, but in the picture, that is what is used and trust me, the harder ones will NOT absorb the liquid, you'll have a mess.  As far as the recipe goes, it's yummy and decadent. I love that the yolks are cooked into a custard too.

Excellent! Most important- you must make this at least 36-48 hours ahead of time. One day isn't enough for the flavors and texture to develop. Also- add Kahlua to the rum/coffee mixture and double it for sure- you won't be sorry!  It looks complicated- but it really isn't hard to make and is an easy way to impress you friends :-)

This was outstanding! I made 3 days ago for Christmas (yesterday). The key is definitely letting it sit in the fridge for a couple days. The flavors are delicate and blend so wonderfully. It was a huge hit! Even among those who don't typically like tiramisu or even dessert. I made it in a springform pan and transferred to a pretty cake plate to serve. The only change I made to the recipe was using brandy rather than rum. The lady fingers I used were the hard variety. You don't need to cut them in half. Just dip them halfway (lengthwise) in the coffee/liquor mix (which you need to atleast double). Place wet side up on the bottom of the pan. It was great. We'll put it in the 'keep' box :)

I've made this many times and now everyone asks for it. I made the egg custard, let that chill, and then add the mascarpone to it. Then, I fold in the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture. I think it tastes better having it all combined that having it in separate layers. I usually make it 24-36 hours ahead of time, so all the flavors can meld together. FANTASTIC!

Love, love, love this recipe- changed a major thing on accident and it turned out amazing so haven't went back. Instead of 6 yolks I did 6 egg whites. Makes it so nice and light. Also instead of doing a coffee version I make it a berry one with frozen berries and orange juice in place of coffee and keep the rum. I put berries on top---beautiful and so creamy. Guests always ask for it again and again!

OH. MY. GOD. This is probably the best dessert I have ever made! A pound of mascarpone (~$11) was too expensive for me, so I used half mascarpone and half Mascarpone Substitute from this site. I used hazelnut liquer instead of the rum, and that was amazing. The sweetness of this dessert is perfect, since the ladyfingers (found in the bakery section) are lightly dusted with confectioners' sugar. I lined a 9" springform pan with a 3rd pack of ladyfingers and assembled as instructed. It's so easy to get a beautiful presentation. Smooth, creamy, light-the perfect dessert to impress, but it will bring out your greedy side!!!

Recipe is better than any you'll find.  Delicious.  I probably go a little heavy on the coffee/rum mixture to make sure the ladyfingers are good and covered, but all in all, fantastic flavor, great recipe.  This has become my husband's favorite treat!  Great recipe- thanks for sharing!

I've always been a fan of tiramisu and was a little nervous when I first decided to try to make one of my own. This is an excellent recipe and like many of the other reviews suggested, it would be wise to make more coffee/rum than what is stated in the recipe. I tripled the amount and it turned out perfect for me. :)

What can I say?  I just got home from the get-together I served this at.  People who never liked Tiramisu ate up their entire piece and came looking for more.  My Tiramisu lovers' eyes grew wide at first taste, and at the last bite, proclaimed it among the best theyd ever tasted!  As for me, I found out that I don't care much for Tiramisu.  But how can I argue with every single person who tasted this one tonight?  FYI: I used the homemade Ladyfingers recipe on here and I am SOOO glad I did!  I think it is a MUST, the ONLY way to go!  I used an 8x8 springform pan, just be sure to run a knife along the edge before opening the spring to serve.  Be sure to leave in the fridge a few days before serving to let the flavors coagulate.  This recipe is so straightfoward.  Thanks for makin' me look like a rock star tonight!

Absolutely delicious!! and really not too hard to make.  I used a springform pan to get it to look like the picture - presentation was beautiful.  I did lightly brush the interior of the vertical ladyfingers with the coffeemixture.  Like others, I doubled the amount of coffee mixture and used Disarrano Amaretto.  I was too afraid of soaking the layers of lady fingers and did not quite use all of the coffee mixture - don't be afraid, it would have been the perfect amount.  Also, used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder, thought that was perfect.  Don't forget to include cocoa powder as part of the layering process - directions not very clear on that.  I will definitly make this again because of the ease of preparation for such a decadent dessert!

I totally agree with other reviews to double up the cofee. I used Starbuck's cofee liquer with mine and it was delicious. I've made this recipe twice already. The first time, I didn't double up the cofee and copied what the sample picture looked. It was delicious but realized that it definetely needed more coffee ( did not read reviews before making it.). Second time, I actually did something different..I used three of those GLAD sandwich container and layered them like the direction says. I got the idea because it's just me and my husband and wanted to freeze some for next time (We didn't want to eat them everyday! We wish!). After letting all the ingredients come together for about a day, IT was delicious and much better than the first time(doubled up the cofee)and we have left overs for next time we have the cravings....

This turned out WONDERFUL! A few tips, just like a lot of reviewers said, I actually tripled my coffee mixture (I used Kaluha instead of rum). Also, do not whip the cream too stiff or it will be hard to spread (found this out the hard way!) The lady fingers I bought were really skinny, so i didn't have enough to put around the sides for presentation. I will definitely make this again!

This tiramisu was the best! I used twice as much coffee as suggested and think it could have still used a little more. I also would add a little sugar to the heavy whipping cream. Overall, excellent recipe!

Very creamy and delicious tiramisu. I would advise using the real ingredients with no substitutes however to get the best taste possible. I had used the mascarpone substitute recipe from this site because I couldn't find the real thing and although the results wasn't bad, you can taste a difference. Like the other reviewers suggested, you definitely need at least 1/2 cup of coffee. I also didn't use rum but next time I think I will just to get the full flavor.

OMG - this was absolutely fabulous!!  The only alterations I made were from previous reviews:  doubled the espresso to 1/2 cup and used 2 Tbsp. dark rum and 2 Tbsp. Kahlua painted on underside of lady fingers with a pastry brush.  I also used a springform pan.  Next time I'll be layering it in a loaf pan to make more layers and using just the Kahlua and no rum.  Everything else is just right!    My mothers had requested this for her birthday cake this year and she said it was just as she had imagined it would be!    A must to use the mascarpone cheese and to allow flavors to mingle in the refrigerator for 2 days. Also, I didn't even use a full teaspoon of cocoa to sprinkle over the top - a full tablespoon would make it too thick IMHO.  This one is definitely going in my recipe box to stay!  You will NOT be disappointed - worth the time to make the homemade custard to end up with such an elegant and rich dessert will very little prep work!

This was spectacular! I also doubled the rum and espresso and it was the perfect amount. I made it in a springform pan so I could decorate the sides with more ladyfingers. I did what another reviewer suggested and dipped the ladyfingers lengthwise in the rum/espresso and then flipped them over in the pan to let the liquid soak down. Not too soggy at all! I waited 24 hours to try it and it only got better after that! A great recipe!

This is the best Tiramisu I've ever tasted.  I have made many times for the last 2 months for my friends always craves for it ever since they've tasted it.   I followed the other reviewers suggestion for the coffee mixture...and it turn out perfect.  You really have to let the egg mixture boil to get the firmness after assembling the tiramisu.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

Excellent Recipe.  This was my first time every making Tiramisu.  I made the Lady fingers from this site instead of using store bought.  However I did use store bought lady fingers for the outside so it would look like the picture.  I would suggest you cream the marscapone first before adding it to the egg yolk mixture - I didn't and it found that the mixture was lumpy.  I did try to whip it but I couldn't get rid of the small little lumps.  I also found there was a lot of filling, Next time I would not use all of the filling.  I made this for my father-in-law's birtday and he loved it - had 2 helpings.  I would make this also 2 days before, sitting for 1 day isn't enough.  It is excellent on the 2nd and 3rd day - if it lasts that long.

This is the best!!!  creamy and flavorful! I have made this many many times and everyone always raves about how good it is.  I sometimes just use hot cocoa to soak the ladyfingers, especially if someone doesn't like coffee.

I made this tiramisu for my husband's birthday, and it was very well received by our guests.  After reading many people's comments I doubled the coffee/rum mixture but found that it still barely soaked the lady fingers.  I did not split the lady fingers (does this mean split them like a hot dog bun?? Does anyone have tips as to how to do this??) but the liquid hardly penetrated the first mm or so of the cookie.  The cookies weren't crispy, just soggy but dry (an oxymoron, I know, but the best I can explain it).  The flavor was delicious, but I would have even tripled the coffee/ liquor amount so I could actually soak the lady fingers instead of just drizzling with the mixture.

I made this twice within a week because it was so good the first time and everyone in the family wanted more! I followed other reviewer's suggestions, doubled the amount of coffee and rum and made it at least 24 hours ahead of time. Everyone who tried it LOVED this tiramisu. I couldn't believe I was able to make tiramisu that tastes so much better than what many restaurants serve. I doubt I would ever order it at restaurant again. Making my own isn't difficult and the result is so much better! I also want to mention that for kids I made it with rich hot chocolate cooled down and kids love it and many adults enjoy it too.

This receipe is delicious! I used whiskey - our liquor of choice and it was terrific. I quickly dunked the ladyfingers in a bit of the coffee mixture, layered them in the pan and then brushed additional coffee mixure on top. Turned out to be just enough and not soggy! As suggested I combined the cream layer with the egg & cheese mixture and it worked well. I was a bit worried as the mixture seemed grainy after refrigerated, but once it warmed a bit it was very smooth. Everyone loved it!

My fiance and I are crazy for Italian food, and pride ourselves that we have had some very delicious and authentic recipes over the years. Well, this was the best Tiramisu we have EVER tasted, and cannot believe it came from our kitchen! I agree with other reviewers that the rum/coffee mixture needs to be doubled, and also with the advice to not soak the ladyfingers in it for long, or they will be mushy. I didn't split the ladyfingers lengthwise, but I used them whole. Also, I put some of them (cut in the middle) around the pan, for decoration purposes. I made two layers, and used a total of 300gr ladyfingers. Finally, I couldn't find mascarpone, so I made the Mascarpone substitute from this site also - excellent! All in all, we went nuts for this recipe, and we now have a new favourite dessert! Thank you very much for sharing.

Flavor is delicious.  Now I did double the coffee and rum but it wasnt enough.  What I did was on every ladyfinger I made sure it was covered in coffee/rum.  When I went to have a piece it was dry.  I believe what makes a tiramisu is the wetness of the coffee and rum.  So what I did was made small holes throughout the tiramisu and poured coffee/rum in each hole and on the sides this way it can get moisty and come out perfect.  My suggesting is make triple of the coffee/rum because its better to have enough than too little.  Make sure each lady finger is completely wet otherwise you will get the same mistake I did.  Other  than that everything came out perfect. Afterwards i covered the holes with the unsweetened cocoa. It was hard for me to find the aluminum tray they ask for so my husband bought me the one to make the lasagna in.  It couldnt have been a more perfect size!!!

I was shocked at how easy this dessert was to make. I did add more coffee than it called for and you couldn't even really taste it. Next time I will add a little more. I loved how it wasn't overly sweet. It was so good I overindulged a bit :)

I'm addicted to Johnny Carino's and have been trying to find a recipe that resembles it...this is the one!  I had a problem with getting the mascarpone cheese mixture to be smooth, but besides from that, it was perfect!  Try this recipe!

Very Delicious recipe! I agree with the other reviews but in case you're wondering what the end product is like...this is a very light tiramisu since it incorporates whip cream and milk the cream layers are very fluffy, it isn't overly sweet in fact just enough to complement the coffee flavor, I use homemade ladyfingers and if you obey the recipe the ladyfingers will be dry on the inside, they don't get soggy until about 3/4 cup is used, there isn't much liquor flavor (when using 4 tbs rum & 2/3 c espresso). All in all very easy and great outcome. 

Homemade ladyfingers recipe (Wolfgang Puck/Food Network):     
    * 6 eggs, separated
    * 1/4 cup sugar, plus 1/4 cup
    * 1 cup cake flour, sifted
    * Melted butter, for brushing pan
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Butter a 12 by 16-inch baking tray. Line with parchment paper and brush again with butter.

In a mixing bowl, whip the egg yolks with 1/4 cup sugar until ribbony and light in color. Reserve. In another mixing bowl, whip the egg whites to soft peaks. Slowly add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and continue to whip to medium peaks. Sift the flour again. With a rubber spatula, fold half of the flour mixture into the yolk mixture. Fold in 1/2 of the egg white mixture. Then fold in the remaining 1/2 flour mixture. Lastly, fold in the remaining 1/2 egg white mixture. Pour the batter into prepared baking tray and with an offset spatula, carefully spreading the batter to fill the tray. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until done and

The flavor was wonderful!  After reading other reviews, I doubled the coffee/rum amounts and soaked the ladyfingers and found them to be too soggy.  I think that I will drizzle next time.

This tiramisu was far better than any I have ever made before, and there is no way to possibly understand how delicious it is without trying it yourself.  I ended up tripling the rum and coffee mixture, and I dunked the ladyfingers into this mixture one at a time rather than drizzling the mixture over them.  It made for a flavorful, moist and cake-y tiramisu.

WONDERFUL!  However, I used about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of strong coffee, mixed with about 6 tablespoons of Kahlua and 4 tablespoons of rum.  I don't know how 1/4 cup of coffee could ever be enough!  I dunked the ladyfingers in the liquid rather than drizzling it on top, and this made for the perfect consistency and flavor of the ladyfingers.  Don't be afraid to do this--they are supposed to be soaked and a bit mushy.  I brought this to work and was told this is better than the Olive Garden's tiramisu.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  My brother loves Tiramisu and is very picky--he said that this was restaurant quality. I only made a few changes -1.  I used equal parts Kahlua and Rum and 2. I used 2.5 times the amount of liquid for the lady fingers. 2. I also used my spingform pan and removed the sides before serving.  I then used chocolate curls and sliced strawberries to decorate the sides.  I was surprised that it turned out so pretty.  I had been a little worried about the presentation.  Keep in mind that the flavors really do improve after it sits for a few days.  I made this Friday morning and served it to dinner guests Saturday night--we all loved it (I even gave out 3 copies of the recipe-one of which went to women who said that she generally doesn't care for Tiramisu but loved this one).  We had one little piece left over that my husband and I split Sunday night and we were both surprised at how much better it tasted Sunday night.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Msde this for a tiramisu fanatic who goes to different bakaeries in search of the perfect recipe. He LOVED it.

I followed the suggestions of soaking the lady fingers in coffee and I increased the coffee/rum mixture by about 4x. I also wait 36 hours to serve it as suggested.

It was also easy to make considering I never did it before.  I used mini-springform pans which made it even easier.

I made this for an Italian themed dinner. Everyone loved it. I used Kalua, and also as posted, increased the coffee mixture. I doubled the whip cream, and put some kalua istead of vanilla in second batch. I also made it 2 days in advance... Really, Really good. Thank you.

I made this two nights before serving it, to let the flavor really come through. It was wonderful. I used a combination of Kaluha and rum with a strong coffe/espresso mixture. I think the only thing I would change is to use more! I didn't have a springform pan, so I used a deep-dish pie plate. It worked out pretty well. The next time I make it though, I'll definitely get a springform!

I and everyone I have made this for LOVES this recipe!  I have received many requests for this dessert.  The only things that I always do differently is to let each of the two mixtures chill overnight, then re-fluff the whipped cream just before putting the cake together.  And, I always use a spring-form pan, I like round cakes.  :)  Delish! Thanks!

I am not a huge fan of Tiramisu, but one of my good friends is so I decided to give it a try with this recipe for a work party.  I don't usually bring "untested" recipes anywhere, but this one had such good reviews so I took a chance.  I'm glad I did and I think so is everyone else.  It came out AWESOME.  I did double the coffee/liquor (a must) and I used Frangelica instead of rum.  It was definitely a hit!  Thanks so much!

Fantastic!!  My daughter and I made this together and it was the best. It was hard to wait over night to try it, but we waited. I did double the coffee/rum mixture and it was just right as suggested by other reviews.  The other thing I did was to add a little sugar to the whipped cream, maybe a little less than 1/4 cup.  Will definitely make again!!

Hand down, amazing!!! Such an easy recipe to follow and the taste is better than those you pay a fortune for at a restaurant!  I didn't change a thing, except to be prepared to use a lot more coffee and personally I think using really strong coffee works the best to bring out the flavours.  Fantastic recipe, worth your time!!

I made this recipe for Easter dessert - it was divine!  I was busy and didn't get to go grocery shopping, so made do with what I had.  I therefore substituted cream cheese for the marscapone, and used Irish Cream liqueur instead of rum.  I did double the amount of coffee.  It wasn't too sweet, as there was no sugar in the whipped cream nor the coffee.  Delicious!
By the way, the photo doesn't look like the finished product, as this is a layered dessert.

Yup, this was amazing.  Just perfect.  I used lady fingers one time and pound cake another time.  I agree with everyone else about making extra of the coffee mixture...I quadrupled the mixture but still could've used more.

I'm new to the baking world and have never made Tiramsu- this came out amazing!!  I doubled the coffee/rum mixture as sugggested and it was great.  The only thing I will change next time is I'll use coolwhip instead of the cream- I probably didn't beat it enough but it was really thin and I've been told that the coolwhip does the same thing and it's easier.  Making for Easter for sure!

I love tiramisu and thinking I could never make it well have been reluctant to even try. This turned out FANTASTICALLY! My mom, also a tiramisu-lover, raved about it. I followed the recipe to the letter. It was so easy to make I was sure I did something wrong and it would be terrible...until that first bite. HEAVEN!
Thank you so much for posting this!

I thought this was very good, but it definitely needs AT LEAST 24 hours for the flavors to blend. The longer it can sit, the better! We enjoyed it the first night (after 24 hours), but the following day (after 48 hours) it was 10X better. Also, if you use pound cake, you could probably triple the coffee/rum mixture, as the dry cake really soaks up the liquid.

After trying another Tiramisu recipe using a double boiler with disastrous results.  This one was  a fabulous hit. I used pound cake as all the stores in our area were out of ladyfingers.  I also used brandy instead of rum.  The custard was divine!  I also grated semisweet chocolate over the top instead of powdered.  Everyone loved it for Christmas dinner.

I absolutely love this recipe!! Layering the whipped cream and the mascarpone make this dessert extra special. I always double the amount of espresso and liquor. I have used dark rum, Kahlua, and Baileys Irish cream. They have all been delicious!

Very good recipe for satisfying tiramisu cravings. If you are using the substitute for mascarpone cheese, be sure to whip/ blend/ strain mixture and get a very smooth consistency, it won't be good to have gritty bits of curdled eggs or milk in your tiramisu. Brew the coffee very strong and spoon mixture generously over the ladyfingers. I used vanilla wafers instead of lady fingers and they worked just as well.
Serve it in individual wine glasses, looks very pretty, and less messy too.

This was pretty good. I made it for Thanksgiving. The only problem I had was that the sugar crystalized in some parts of the custard and made it unbearably sweet in spots. I loved that I could make it two days in advance. Also it is the same recipe that was on the back of the lady fingers package.

I made this for Thanksgiving and had never tasted Tiramisu before, it was one of my daughters favorite desserts, I decided to treat her, I was worried about the results but found it to be outstanding, the only change I made was I used coffee liquer made by Starbucks, it was the great, I made it on a Tuesday and today is Saturday and we have 4 pieces left and it is still fantastic, doesn't weep or anything, I was thrilled with the taste, appearance and such, will make it againl I put cocoa on top, sifting it on plus I used Hershey bar that I had made curls with for a nice finishing touch.

This is a great recipe!  I like the fact that the egg yolks are cooked and it wasn't difficult to make.  I did make a few changes as follows:  1) I only had 5 eggs in the fridge but that didn't seem to impact the custard part taste-wise.  2)  Used Kahlua since I didn't have rum.  3)  Made a 9" sponge cake since I can't find ladyfingers in my area.  I doubled the coffee and Kahlua as other reviewers suggested but I didn't get as much moistness as I would have liked.  Next time I'll triple the liquid amounts if I go the sponge cake route.  4) I  chilled the custard in an ice water bath for about 10 minutes and then placed it in the freezer for 20 minutes before assembly.  I waited 24 hours before tasting it and was surprised at how much it resembled restaurant quality tiramisu!  Thanks again for the great recipe.

Excellent recipe. Important things - DO DOUBLE THE COFFEE/RUM mixture; let it sit in the refrigerator for 24 HOURS FOR BEST results; the flavors blended so well and it was worth the effort!!

Maybe I'm jinxing myself, because I haven't tasted it yet (except for licking the spoons).  But this is by far the best looking tiramisu, and best constructed one I've ever done.  

I chilled my mixing bowl before whipping the cream, and it has held up very nicely.
I used coffee flavored rum (Brinley Gold if you can find it).  Another trick I have used in multiple tiramisu recipes - is instead of cocoa or choco. shavings, I buy chocolate covered espresso beans, and grind up in my cuisinart. I layered on top of the whipped cream. It gives a nice subtle crunch with a chocolate/coffee flavor!  (And still looks nice on top!)

wow!  I made this for my birthday cake. it came out perfect!  What amazed me the most was that it was so easy! (of course I didn't tell my guests. We'll keep that just between us cooks.)  The other thing that impressed me was how beautifully it cut! even the first peice had nicely layered sides. I doubled the espresso-rum mixture and spread it on with a pastry brush. I also whisked the egg mixture the whole time it was cooking.  Definitely a good recipe!

This is just like the tiramisu you'd find at a restaurant. i experimented with it a few times and here's a few tips. Definetly double the coffee mixture and try using kahlua instead of the rum. and also make sure you are using SOFT lady fingers. for presentation i find it looks better in smaller individual glass serving bowls (or a bowl for two after a romantic dinner). i just line the bowl with ladyfingers around the circumference first. and lastly, make this ahead of time. not only will it save you time on the night of your dinner, but the flavors really come out after it sits in the fridge for a day.

This recipe is fabulous.  It turned out beautifully. The ladyfingers must be different here in Europe though becase they were way too small to cut in half.

this was good! but i'd say that it was really smooth enough. i would use powered sugar next time. it also wasn't really what i was looking for. i hoping for one of those recipes where the tiramisu would had a soft new york cheesecake kind of texture, so basically more firm. I whipped this up along with the whipped cream and layered it : brownie, tiramisu filling, whipped cream. it was definetely rich and satisfies sugar cravings. a keeper, but i'll still be looking for a firmer tiramisu recipe.

Very delicious dessert and worth every minute of the prep time to make it !!! Changed it up abit - brushed the coffee (1 cup) and rum (4 tbps)on the ladyfingers and lined a springform pan with them. Alternated the custard and whipped cream and used a high quality grated dark chocolate to top the cake.  Very delicious and not too sweet !!!

Awesome.... easy easy easy.  I use to make a no bake Turamisu, though the raw egg yolks always scared me.  This is great and my whole family loved it. I added 1/2 more sugar because I didn't have 24 hours for the flavors to blend.  I made this at noon and we ate it at 7:00.  I added the extra sugar to the egg yolks while cooking.  YUM

I can only describe this as being sinfully rich, yet light. Wonderful!!! My hubby loved it. I used the hard lady fingers sliced in half, kalua, & let it set up overnight before serving.

This is awsome.  And EASY!  I have celiac disease so I substituted Gluten Free Lady fingers and I could not tell the difference!  I did over whip the cream.  I will know for the next time.  Also, I like a little more Rum.  But it would be perfect for my teenage daughter to share with us just like it is.  Thanks Christine.

Excellent recipe for a first time tiramisu maker!  My husband doubted my tiramisu-making skills until I made this recipe.  He is picky and he loved it!  I left the lady fingers whole and used a bit more coffee to compensate.  But make sure you use a deep enough pan if you do that.  I would also agree that it is better when made the day before.

To cut fat and calories, I used fat free ricotta. I also used 1/4 cup kahlua instead of the rum. Sprinkled cocoa on top of the first layer of whipped cream, as well as on top. Used a pastry brush to control the amount of liquid on the lady fingers. We think this recipe rivals the tiramisu originally served at our local Macaroni Grille!

You can't get better in an italian restaurant!  After I made this, I don't order out anymore.  I used a Starbuck small coffee and light rum.  WONDERFUL!!!

This was good.  I mean, it's tiramisu - how can it not be good?  But, after reading the reviews I expected it to be great, and I was dissapointed even though I followed the recipe exactly.  I've definitely had better and for what it costs to make this desert, I won't use this recipe again. I'll try one of the others next time.

I have made this many times over the past 13 years.
One change that I tried once and have stuck with is folding the whipped cream into the marscapone/custard mixture as is done in most other tiramisu recipes.         
NOTE: for the reviewers who stated that the custard was runny/never set, that's an indication that you did not cook it properly.  It is a standard soft custard.  However, if you prefer it a bit thicker, try adding 2 tbsp of cornstarch.

Excellent recipe. I followed the advice of some others and added more coffee and rum and quickly dipped the lady fingers into the mixture. For the cocoa powder, I used a sifter, too. It looked just like a restaurant, but tasted so much better than one.

I followed this recipe to the letter, no modifications or changes.  The result was a runny mess, the custard filling did not set up, even though it was refrigerated over 12 hours prior to serving.

Very good recipe! I read and followed reviews- 1 cup coffee and 4 tablespoons of rum for the coffee mixture but I still needed more.  I did the rest as the recipe was written, and again due to reviews made it a day and a half ahead.  2nd day flavor was the best.  My personal addition was to top it off with a salted whipped cream (heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar and salt to taste), the cocoa powder and shaved dark chocolate.   This will be by go to tiramisu from now.

I made this for my husband for his birthday since it was our wedding cake. I did enjoy the video and found it helpful. Since it’s just 2 of us, I halved the ingredients except for the coffee/rum mixture. I have to agree with the review stating the video does not correspond to the recipe. Firstly, you can’t cut crispy lady fingers. You need to dip each ONE AT A TIME. Not like portrayed in the video...I did that and I ruined 3 lady fingers and 1/4 c. of the coffee/rum. Making 1/2 the recipe fit nicely in a loaf pan. It’s in the refrigerator...hopefully it will taste amazing and I’ll want to make it again.

This was soooo goooood! I had a favorite go to Tiramisu recipe. Not any more. This one is it!  Doubling the coffee and rum is a must as is making it a day ahead. I presented it in individual sherbet glasses. Not a drop was left.

Easy to make. I read that she said only dip the fingers in the mixture briefly. But I dipped them longer. So the bottom batch was soggy. Next time I will do it right. Everyone loved it regardless!

Wow, so good!  A classic tiramisu.  I had to make it twice for my family over the holidays as it disappeared so quickly.  The only change I made based upon other reviews was to increase the amount of coffee - I used about 3/4 C.

I stumbled upon this recipe when searching to make some for a friend. I've liked Tiramisu, but wasn't a huge fan. This recipe has made me a fan. It is SO good, and really not difficult at all. It's not too sweet, not too heavy, really just perfect. I highly recommend it.

Everyone loved this.  My husband is Italian and this was my first time making this. I was a bit apprehensive about how it would stack up against his family's tiramisu. He said it was amazing and he went back for seconds.  Definitely a keeper.  I might blend the Whipped Cream and Egg mixture next time.

I haven't made this in a few years, now I remember why, I end up eating half of it by myself! This is amazing! Definitely make at least 1 day in advance for the rich delicious flavor a good tiramisu has. I always use a round springform and have extra lady fingers on hand to line the inside of the cake pan with standing lady fingers. When unmolded I use a festive ribbon to tie around the tiramisu. Everyone has a hard time believing it is homemade and that I didn't buy it at an Italian bakery. By far one of the most impressive desserts to serve or bring to someone's home. If your making tiramisu this is the only recipe you should be using! And as recommended by others always double the coffee amount. Enjoy!

Excellent recipe.  But mascarpone isn’t easy to come by where I live, so used cream cheese.  I brushed in the rum and coffee rather than soaking the ladyfingers in it.  It was a smash hit at three Christmas parties.

Excellent recipe!  One of the best tiramisu I’ve had and others who ate it agreed.  Not hard to make.  I followed the recipe with one chance, I dipped the cookies in coffee rather than drizzled so probably used twice as much coffee, maybe more.

Had to double the coffee and rum mixture. Best to dip the lady fingers in the mixture quickly or they become too soggy.

I made this for the first time to take to a family Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. I had to actually triple the coffee/rum mix..I guess I was soaking the ladyfingers too long. Will definitely make again.

We made the ladyfingers for this recipe and doubled the amount of coffee rum mixture. Instead of drizzling the mixture over the lady fingers we dipped them quickly in the coffee rum mixture. Will definitely make this again.

I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it! I never made tiramisu before but all of the 5 star ratings caused me to try it. It is the best recipe ever!!! No raw egg to worry about and just the right amount of sweetness. Definitely 10/10

The best tiramisu recipe IF you like it custardy (vs. light and airy). I will be making this many, many more times! The only thing I did differently was adding a tbsp (maybe less) vanilla sugar to the whipped cream because I don't like it w/o it.

The mascarpone custard here is amazing, which I think is they key to good tiramisu. I make this for Christmas almost every year. My family loves it. Even my best friend from Italy likes it. The only things I do different from this recipe is I don't split the ladyfingers and end using additional ladyfingers and more of the coffee and rum mixture.

•I used a 9x13 pan & Schar’s lady finger cookies (the hard ones) •I combined my custard and whip cream mixtures and it turned out having the same flavors. •I also added 1/2 cup of cold, unmelted butter and mixed it into that. •I didn’t use rum because of the people I was making it for and it still turned out great. •I dunked my lady fingers immediately in and out instead of drizzling and it worked perfect. 
Great recipe, if you’re a tiramisu lover, you’ll love this!!

Amazing recipe. I used an expandable cake mold and it set up perfectly after 24 hours in the fridge. The pirouette cookies along the outside were perfect for dipping into different layers.  I grated a chocolate bar on the top and left out the rum. The kids devoured it!

I used kahlua instead of rum and this was fabulous. Def gotta let the flavors meld at least overnight. Also followed other reviews and doubled the coffee-rum mixture, but I’ll def make this again! Made in a trifle bowl for my sister’s bday and it was a real hit! Thanks for the great recipe!!

It was really great.
I did fold in some chopped espresso chips to the marscapone custard that added a boosted coffee flavor and a contrasting texture!

I love this recipe. It’s better than any restaurant tiramisu I’ve ever had.  I usually double the batch because it’s a lot of work and it freezes pretty well.  I buy the crunchy lady fingers and do not cut them in half.  I dip them in a mixture of espresso and Kaluha or other coffee flavored liquor rather than coffee and rum. I like the flavor better. This dessert can be made a few days in advance and it’s better for it!

Pretty good, but some necessary advice in making this: 
1 - Do NOT bother cutting the lady fingers in half. Use the whole lady finger and just dip (not drizzle) the coffee mixture for 1 - 2 seconds and put them in the glass pan. You'll also need about 2 cups of coffee + 8 TB of rum.
2 - After making the whipped cream, fold that into the mascarpone mixture. the mascarpone does not hold up well if you put it in as a "layer" in the tiramisu (plus America's Test Kitchen and others tell you to combine these). 
3 - Let this sit for overnight if possible.
4 - Add some chocolate shavings as well as the chocolate powder, if you like (optional).

I usually don't review recipes but I HAD to review this one! It is AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled the amount of coffee and rum per other reviewers' suggestions. I tried splitting the lady finger cookies in half but they crumbled and broke so I used whole ones. It was delicious after the suggested chill time but it was amazing the next day!

Simple to make and so delicious! We had to make a change due to a medication that can’t be mixed with alcohol so I simply put a little rum flavouring into cooled, strong, extra bold coffee  and it turned out so tasty that the family asked that we have it for all our special occasion dinners!

This was very good and easy to follow. A couple of hints. 

1. If you are using the softer cake ladyfingers dry them out at 250 degrees for 10-15 minutes penned in half. 

2.  Triple the coffee/rum mixture and really soak the ladyfingers.  I used a coffee, Kahala, rum mixture and did not use enough.  

3. I used less than  1/2 cup of the whipping cream and should have used FAR less. 1/2 c total would have been plenty bit overwhelmed the amazing custard. In had a bit more than 3/4 c based on the amount of cream used (3/4 cup heavy whiling cream. 1/4 c would have been plenty. 

Otherwise am i f.

Perfect! We halved the recipe as there are only 2 of us. That made 4-5 portions. As per other reviews, we also used double the amount of coffee and rum, and dunked the ladyfingers until they were covered all over. We drizzled any remaining coffee/rum mixture over the second ladyfinger layer. Other than that, we followed the method exactly, and left it for 24 hours (dusting with cocoa just before serving). Was great after 24 hours, even better after 48. Tasted as good as any restaurant tiramisu.

Omg! Made this for the first time and it’s turned out really good.  I used Chocolate Cherry Liquor instead we of rum.  It’s so creamy and it’s taste like some of the restaurants I have eaten in the past.  Definitely a keeper.

Like others before me have commented,  the amount of coffee was insufficient.  I ended up using 1 cup and 6 tablespoons rum. Must dip cookies quick quick quick or they will oversaturate and fall apart or just be too wet.

This is amazing!  I only substituted the marscapone with cream cheese and heavy whipping cream because there was no marscapone at my store.  Wonderful!

Yum! My go to recipe for Tiramisu! I only change/add two things: more whipped cream (I always seem to use the initial 1-1/4 cup for the bottom layer) and shaved dark chocolate on top of the cocoa later!

This is a really good recipe! For moister cake, you will need to use more coffee than suggested to dunk the ladyfingers in.

I like my tiramisu wet on the bottom where you can taste the coffee. 1/4 cup of coffee and 2 tablespoons rum barely permeates. What I do is drizzle the lady fingers with 1/2 cup of coffee and 4 tablespoons of rum then I pour an additional 1/2 cup of coffee and 2 tablespoons of rum on bottom of pan before adding the lady fingers and layering. Once I did that, it's perfect for my taste.

Followed the recipe closely (doubled the coffee/rum/vanilla mixture as suggested by other reviewers) and let it sit in the frig for 48 hours before serving. Took it to a party and people inhaled it and were fighting over the final pieces. Folks were raving about it being the best tiramisu they had ever eaten. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe, much appreciated!

This is heaven!!! Seriously.  Everyone raved and I’m the type of person that when I go to Italy, I have to try the tiramisu at every restaurant I go to.  This will be your one stop for tiramisu. I used spiced rum because it’s what I had and I doubled the coffee mixture because those ladyfingers soaked it up like crazy.

Absolutely DEELISH! The only changes we (the mister and I) would make: add a teensy bit more coffee and rum. The flavors of both those ingredients are very light in this recipe. We are also going to try adding chocolate shavings to the top next time to add a lil more oomph. But, to give you an idea of how WONDERFUL this recipe is, we have three kids (aged 2 through 14) who don't drink coffee, booze, or generally like "complex" desserts.... All three of the kids WOLFED this down!! Huge hit! Also, this dish is one of those that is just devine as left overs! Last helpful tip: dont even bother trying to halve the ladyfingers - waste of time and completely unnecessary. You'll give yourself a headache and your other half will find you drinking booze on the kitchen floor ;). They turn out just fine if you leave them whole!

This was my first attempt and I followed the recipe with only two exceptions. First change was doubling the coffee rum and the flavor was perfect. I watched the video and they used whole ladyfingers but the recipe said to slice them in half which I did. I made it two days in advance and kept it covered in the fridge. The flavor was outstanding but the bottom was wet and I didn’t like that! I do know next time I will not cut the cookies.

This recipe was a huge hit both times I made it. I made it with spiced rum as I did not have plain rum on hand and doubled the coffee/rum mixture as I was almost out of liquid after my first layer, even with very lightly dipping the ladyfingers (make sure to lightly dip them in, don't have them dripping wet or rum flavor will be too strong). The recipe is even better the next day as it has longer to set. Yummm!!

Easy to follow recipe that was a real crowd pleaser. I substituted the rum/coffee with a 1.25 cups kahlua instead since I had just enough left over for it. I also had to double up on the heavy cream since the ratio between that and the mascarpone mixture was off for me. I layered the tiramisu in a glass round bowl. I will definitely be using this recipe again!.

This was my first attempt at tiramisu and it was an overwhelming success! I made this for a Game of Thrones series finale viewing party and I renamed it “Tyrionmisu”, after one of the main characters. I followed the recipe pretty closely except I did double the coffee and I skipped the rum. I used the soft lady fingers and brushed them with coffee rather than soak. I also sprinkled a layer of crushed chocolate covered espresso beans on the whipped cream layers for texture and crunch. Because it was a theme dessert for a viewing party, I included a stencil of Tyrion Lannister on the top layer. Of course, normally I would simply dust the top.  It was delicious and well received! This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe was delicious! I followed the recipe, with the exception that I tripled the coffee/rum.  The ladyfingers soak up a lot of the liquid; the more soaked, the better.  I also recommend making it at least one day prior.  I made it for a group of people, and it was a crowd pleaser! Using Mascarpone and the heavy cream are the key ingredients to this recipe.

Perfect !  Was hesitant due to all of the reviews and changes that others had made.  I took a chance, made it following the recipe as is.  I did let it set for two days.  Delicious!  This one is a keeper!

This was a delicious dessert! Just be sure to refrigerate for at least 4 hours. The custard mixture tasted a little odd before letting it “set-up” for a good amount of time. I also heeded advice of others and doubled coffee/rum marinade, and added quite a bit more rum than the recipe called for, because yes...I like rum??. I will definitely make this many more times!

I'll definitely make it again! I took everyone's recommendation on doubling/tripling the coffee & rum mix, it's mandatory! I used the savoiardi lady fingers and rolled them in the mixture. It was perfect! For the custard,  we did cook it 1 min non stop whisking and chilled in refrigerator 1 hr. It did set up but looked a little thin. I was concerned! However,  using the electric mixer to blend it with the mascarpone it thickened and was perfect! We waited 24 hours because we were too excited to taste it and it was really yummy! Do try to wait the whole 2 days!

I also forgot to put the cocoa powder on before serving and did that before refrigerating and covering.  It still turned out fine. I covered with aluminum foil instead of plastic wrap because I thought it would not hold as much moisture.  

Also shave a little dark chocolate on top!!! It's amazing!!

Really, really great Tiramisu. This has become my 'go to' recipe.  I altered the recipe only to double the amount of the coffee/rum mixture for dipping the ladyfinger cookies, and I followed the suggestion to save a step by combining the custard and whipped cream vs. layering them on individually.  It is tasty on Day One but definitely even better on Day Two.

This dessert was so good! Made it for a family potluck and got many compliments. Instead of coffee, I went down to the local coffee shop and had them make me 4 shots of espresso. I made 1 1/2 times the recipe in a 9 x 13 pan and refrigerated it overnight. I really appreciated that this recipe is not overly sweet and will definitely make it again.

Super great recipe! Made it for my family and it was gone in 2 days! I used more coffee than it called for. 1/4 cup  was not enough but it was an easy fix, and pretty convenient since I had plenty of extra coffee. Looking forward to making this again!

I love this recipe!  We did have to up the coffee mixture to 1 cup of joe and 3 TBLS of liquor and dipped the lady fingers vs drizzling it over them.  Other than that, love it and will make again!

Taste-wise I would give this 5 stars all the way. However, I did a couple things a little differently and don’t like when people give 5 stars and then list everything they changed. My changes: 1. DOUBLE the rum and coffee mixture! A single recipe would definitely not be enough. 2. I find it easier to pour the rum mixture from a small measuring pitcher rather than soaking the cookies. 3. Next time I feel like I could use just 1/2 C of sugar and have it still taste absolutely delicious, but that may just be me. I’ve made this recipe several times now and it’s ALWAYS a hit!

I more than doubled the coffee/rum mix.  The lady fingers really soaked it up.  I used Kahlua in lieu of white rum.  I used a whole package (7oz. package) of  Alessi Biscotti Saviiardi Lady Fingers.  Excellent recipe. I will definitely make it again.

I made this without the alcohol, using Starbucks finely ground espresso coffee (brewed strong), and very lightly dipped the lady fingers (not letting soak at all). It was the best  tiramisu I’ve ever made, even better the next day after the lady fingers soak up more of the liquid during the night and the flavors have time to marry. I added shaved dark 70% cocoa to the top for decoration (also the unsweetened Dutch powdered cocoa) and it was lovely. Definitely a keeper.

I love this recipe.  I like that the eggs are cooked, unlike some of the other recipes.  I had to use more coffee than the recipe called for, and I would mix the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture to make it less firm. I will definitely make this again.

Overall great, but I definitely would make some changes. 

The custard tasted good, but the recipe asks for 6 yolks and only 1 1-4 cups of cream, so you end up having lots and lots of custard and a medium amount of whipped cream. This made for a very heavy tiramisu ...if you like that then great! But if you like light and fluffy tiramisu like me, then I would cut down the custard to 4 yolks and increase the whipped cream.

Very much enjoyed this recipe. I ended up making it in two 9x9 inch square pans for two separate occasions. Got 9 portions perfect portions from each dish. I did have to double the coffee/rum for dipping the lady fingers which I quickly dip on both sides for just the right consistency, not too dry, not too soggy. Also, I combined the whipped cream w the marscapone mixture for one smooth cream. Delicious and will be making again!

A little extra work but the results were worth every minute of effort. Super light and creamy, would suggest you make it in a transparent glass pan which would allow your guest to see the yummy layers of goodness that awaits them.

Excellent. Important note: Patience is key to the egg/milk/sugar mixture on the stove! I stirred constantly and it took almost 20 minutes on medium heat to start gently boiling. I considered it ready when it coated the back of a spoon and I could draw a clear line on the spoon with my finger. The end product was worth it!!

This is the second time this week I've made Tiramisu.   First time I used this recipe and the second time was from another recipe  website. This recipe was the better of the 2.  The only change I will make to this recipe is next time I will use a coffee liqueur (such as Kahlua) with the espresso.  Just a suggestion when you are making this, I can not express enough how important it is NOT to soak your lady fingers. Literally to the count of 2 for each side of the cookie.  Makes for a soggy dessert,  still yummy but soggy.

I impressed family and friends with my first time making tiramisu using this recipe.
I like the fact that the egg yolks are cooked to ensure food safety.
I used kahlua instead of rum and it was perfect, though it was 4 times the amount.
also used 4 times the cocoa powder.
Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Great recipe, but the custard might not be enough for some people.  If you find it isn't enough, I recommend folding in a tub of whipped cream.   I also used Kahlua instead of regular rum, blends better with the strong coffee flavor.

Need at least double coffee/rum mixture.  Next day still wasn't quite right. I think third day and after was best. Need to plan ahead for next time.

Great recipie, made it several times. No changes needed. Dark baking chocolate makes the flavor pop a bit more. Make sure you've got an afternoon or evening set aside to make it though, the six hour refrigeration is the bare minimum for it to set. The longer the better

I personally don't like tiramisu. However, my husband absolutely loves this dessert! I have made this recipe many times, and the only suggestions I have are to double or even triple the rum, make the coffee VERY strong, and as others have said let it sit for at least 24 hours. Our family and friends always request this dessert for parties and get togethers! This is an excellent recipe!!

This is a staple at almost all our get togethers.  Everyone loves loves loves it.  I do a few things differently though.I make my own mascarpone cheese, add more coffee liquor then what it calls for and sometimes, I have made my own white cake to use instead of lady fingers.

I made the custard mix in a bowl over shallow pan with hot water in it.  I also mixed whipped cream and custard mixture together. It turned out perfect

Sooooo good. I added a pinch of espresso powder to the cocoa on top. I did accidentally fold the mars alone into the whip cream, not the custard, so I just combined it all into one. Turned out amazing!!!

This is the BEST Tiramisu ever! My family went crazy over it! Even those of us that have never liked Tiramisu loved it. If you like the super boozy type, you will have to adapt this recipe, because it's very mildly rum flavored. And definitely at least double the coffee/rum mixture if you are using ladyfinger cookies, because they are dry and really soak it up. And definitely make it at least 24 hours in advance of serving because the flavor and texture is so much better.

Make sure you are quick with soaking the lady fingers! We weren’t quick enough and ended up having a very rum-heavy tiramisu.

I brought this to our office Christmas Potluck and everyone raved about it. Thank you so much for sharing. I did have to double the recipe for a 9 x 13 pan. I had a little extra because I did that but enough for the 9 x 13 which was what I needed. VERY TASTY!

Wonderful! As mentioned in other reviews, use double portions (I used even more) of rum and coffee, otherwise it'll run out really fast. Don't overbeat the cream, or it'll break. Somehow ended up with two tiramisus, but I'm not complaining :)

The recipe was amazing. The first time I tried making the tiramisu custard with egg and sugar, I curdled it. Whisk the eggs and sugar until they turn a pale yellow, then bring it to the stove. The mixture should thicken up, but it will set more once it's chilled. The amount of sugar was perfect. The sweetness wasn't overbearing. I did use around one cup of strong coffee because 1/4 cup of coffee just wasn't enough.

Absolutely THE best.  I’m Italian - so picky about my tiramisu. Make this - it’s amazing. Just let it sit for at least 36 hours so the flavors will blend and it will be delicious. I alwys make a little more whipping cream than recipe says so I don’t run out and I add rum to my espresso before dipping the ladyfingers.  Any recipe for tiramisu that calls for Cool Whip should be illegal

Took this to a Christmas party tonight.  Everyone loved it.  I did make a couple of changes.  Added more heavy cream, since the first batch did not seem to make enough to spread.  I also made some coffee syrup to make it taste a little more coffier.  Is that a word?  LOL!  I also did leave out the rum.  I didn't even add imitation rum, and it was still great.

Being gluten intolerant I made my own gluten-free Lady Fingers. I also used Amaretto instead of Rum. The other change I made was to fold the whipped cream mixture together with egg yolk mixture instead of layering. It worked out fabulously!!!

I followed the recipe pretty accurately and it turned out really good. For first timers like me it's important not to leave the lady fingers in the coffee mix for too long or they'll get really soggy.

The taste is perfect. I found it a bit too runny. With that amount of ladyfingers i cannot make two layers. So the last time I made it, I doubled the amount of ladyfingers and it came out great. Also, the custard is not done after one minute. You have to cook until it thickens or you will get runny tiramisu.

I don’t usually rate recipes but this was so good I decided to.  A little time consuming (but not hard) to make.   I used the packaged hard lady fingers and they softened nicely.  I did not cut them in half.  I soaked one side only and placed the soaked side face up.  I put the cocoa powder on when I assembled and it still looked nice when I served it 36 hours later.

Keep it refrigerated for two days before eating. This is not optional. This is the best tiramisu, but only if you let it rest for two days. It's quite bland otherwise. It just isn't worth the cost of the ingredients if you eat it immediately or after one night.

I made it for a work party, and made the mascarpone substitute with cream cheese, butter and whipping cream.  I did double the coffee mixture as recommended.  Still blushing from all the compliments!

I never write reviews on this site (though I have to admit I use them often!!), but this dish requires it.  This dessert was AMAZING!!!!!!!  I made it for a huge dinner I hosted with friends, and it was the perfect make ahead dessert and got rave reviews from them.  I 100% agree with the people who say the longer it sits the better it becomes.  I made it on Friday and had a slice just now (Monday) and it tasted better today than it did on Saturday when I served it.  It DOES need the coffee/rum mixture to be doubled as several have said.  I actually used Kahlua because I had it, and that was a very good choice.  I also used pasteurized eggs because the fact that there were raw eggs freaked me out a little even though they are heated, so that is always an option if desired :).

Okay, so this week was my fourth attempt at homemade tiramisu, and I think I've got it!! This recipe is really perfect, though I omitted the rum and soaked the lady fingers in espresso only. I did need more than the recipes calls for, however. Besides omitting the rum, I followed the recipe to the letter but chose to mix the whipped cream and custard mixtures just for simplicity. I have had many tiramisus and always find Olive Garden's to be the best, and I think I've got it!! Today's was PERFECT! I think anyone can follow this recipe exactly and make a great dessert. My only piece of advice is to just dip the lady fingers into the espresso. My first attempts ended in way too much sogginess. Also, I did question the pan size and wanted to make mine in a 9x13" pan so I doubled the custard and whipped cream and ended with more than I needed, which allowed me to make another 9x9" pan.

I made Tiramisu according to this recipe twice for the first time I somehow missed the step to mix mascarpone to the yolk mixture and whisked it in whipped cream mixture, it still tasted good but the shape of yolk mixture was not creamy enough.  

Note: I think would be much better to split this into two separate steps -  In a medium bowl, beat cream with vanilla until stiff peaks form. Whisk mascarpone into yolk mixture until smooth.
Thank you!

Delicious!  
I needed 1.5 cups coffee (used decaf) & used 1 tsp rum extract & a Tbsp Jamison whiskey (as I didn't have rum on hand.)

I was hesitant to make this as I thought much could go wrong and I live in a place where many of these ingredients are hard to come by, but I was encouraged that even the failures tasted good according to the reviews. First, I had to use ricotta because there's no mascarpone here and I smoothed it out with a little cream, I'm concerned it may still be a little lumpy. I used brandy instead of rum and I made way too much coffee since the reviews said to make lots, but since I only brushed it on the ladyfingers (I don't like really wet cake), which I left whole, there was plenty left over. That's ok though because I reserved a little whipped cream and am enjoying a grownup coffee as I write this. I wonder if it will be lacking in coffee flavour though. I was particularly nervous about scrambling the egg mixture so I started out heating it over a water bath but that was taking FOREVER and never came to a boil so I ended up dumping it in a pot to finish whereupon it immediately thickened smoothy. I did mix that into cheese without the cooling in the fridge and it was fine. I also mixed the cream into that, also fine. I am giving it the recommended 2 days in the fridge and will come back and let you know how it turned out...I'm very hopeful!
UPDATE: it was sorely lacking in coffee flavour. I recommend dunking the cookies instead of brushing.

This was easy and came out great!
I cooked the custard for 20 minutes and stirred it all the time.
I did have to make additional coffee mixture and whip cream.

I would’ve given this recipe 5 stars but it seemed like the quantities were not large enough for a 7x11 pan. I didn’t have enough ladyfingers to cover the bottom of the pan, nor did the mascarpone or whipped cream layers get fully covered. It was delicious otherwise but it looked awful.

Very yummy! I'm a novice baker, and mine was still delicious.  The marscapone custard -my favorite part- was great. I do, however, agree with other commenters that much more of the coffee-rum mixture is needed, especially if you like those tastes to be stronger, as I do.

I am a fairly experienced & good baker but had never made tiramisu before. This was excellent. Did not change a thing. Made it for my son’s 40th surprise birthday that we hosted. Everyone raved about it. I didn’t even get to try it before it was snarfed up. I made it two days prior as others suggested for the tastes to merge.

This tiramisu is very light and not overly sweet. Its amazing and even if you accidentally mix in the whipped cream and the egg mixtures like I stupidly did, it'll still taste amazing.

Oh My GOD.  Follwed recipe,  doubling the coffee mixture as suggested by other reviewers, and using Kahlua instead of rum.  Definitely prepare AT LEAST 24 hours before serving.  It tastes better on days 3 and 4.

This recipe is a winner! 

Changes: I used instant coffee and I left out the rum (didn’t have any).  I couldn’t find marscapone so I substituted whole milk ricotta and cream cheese whipped thoroughly together.  (50-50 ratio). I also cut the sugar to half a cup instead of 3/4. 

I’ve made tirimasu before with different recipes and although I can’t stand drinking it, I find that using consentrated instant coffee tastes better in desserts than brewed espresso.  Not sure why. 

But oh my, this recipe is so tasty. The egg yolk custard is what does it.  It was so good. Definitely a must try if you like Tiramisu

I make this recipe more often than I should admit. I do not add the rum and it still tastes out of this world. If you don't like to add alcohol to your food this recipe works with or without it! I DO NOT replace it with anything, I just leave it out.  I can honestly say I have never tasted a better tiramisu in my life and I buy it every time I see it.

I made this for my son's birthday dessert and it is amazing!  I did use store bought whipped cream and I also made a mascarpone substitute from cream cheese, sour cream, and half and half.  So delicious !  Will make again and will share the recipe.

Followed recipe as written. This is fairly simple, just follow the steps. It received rave reviews from all of my guests. I did use Italian lady fingers found in the International isle in my supermarket. I found if you let them sit in the coffee and rum for more than a quick turnover they get mushy in your hands. I think next time I will brush the coffee rum mixture on the lady fingers rather than dip them. I did let the Tiramisu chill for 24 hours before serving. This recipe is a keeper.

The family loved it! I made extra whipping cream just in case and still would have liked a bit more.

I made it for a 9x13 pan just double the recipie and it worked great. I did leave out the rum and added 1/4 cup of sugar to the whipping cream. You definitely have to let it set overnight in the frig. So it will set and cut beautifully.

Always use legit lady fingers not US made, IMPORT is way better. They don’t get soggy as fast as US made.I don’t double rum mixture,  instead I quadruple it along with espresso. Cream turns out very smooth and velvety. I let it sit overnight and next day it’s a ????????. Always make it during summer months, I bring it to get together with our family and never have leftovers. It’s the fist dessert that disappears in seconds.

My dad loves tiramisu so I always make it for his birthday. This recipe is excellent, but I do recommend some things. Like other reviewers have mentioned, double the coffee/rum mixture. You must let it sit in the fridge for at least a day, but two is best. I had trouble with my custard curdling, but after doing some research I found out that if you pulse it with an immersion blender, it looks fine, even if you’ve already refrigerated it! I hope this helps!

I want to make this but with rum extract. How much rum extract do I use? I don’t have rum and it could possibly be a wast for me to buy.

I made it exactly the way the directions say except I didn't put rum in it as I was making this for teachers at my son school for teacher appreciation week. They said it was "TO.DIE.FOR" and that they should have started with dessert first before they ate lunch! I was so relieved, never making this before and not being able to taste it I was really scared to serve it to them and have them be my guinea pigs.

I made it exactly as the recipe said - although I did add a couple tablespoons of powdered sugar to the whipped cream. It was absolutely divine. I wouldn't change a thing. For those who may be wondering, I used regular hard/crispy/crunchy lady fingers available in the grocery store - they worked perfectly!

Super easy and hands down the best we’ve had. I did double the coffee and liquor as suggested and I used a coffee flavored liquor instead of rum. And I always make my own ladyfingers while I’m waiting for the custard to chill. They are soft and so yummy! My wife begs for this on a regular basis. It’s a keeper!

I’ve made this twice and it’s great. I think it was at its peak when it sat for about 1/2-2 days. Toughest part is soaking the lady fingers. Too soggy and it’s mush, not enough and it’s dry. I dunked bottoms of lady fingers and brushed the tops. The middle of the lady fingers were dry. I think this is why I like it after 2 days- it’s the right texture for the lady fingers! This one won’t disappoint.

I have made this a couple times now and it is always a hit. Very tasty and perfect coffee/filling/whipped cream ratio.  The video with the recipe is different than the instructions with the recipe.  I read some reviews that say there is not enough of the coffee liquid.  If you drizzle the cookies as in the instructions rather than dunk them as in the video there is the perfect amount.  The cookies further absorb the liquid as the dessert stands for the time specified so they don't need to be completely saturated.

This was absolutely spectacular!! I would make it the day before for sure, just to allow all the deliciousness to really set up. It was much easier than I anticipated/ and I liked that there is no raw eggs. It is my new favorite!

I looove this recipe!! I've made it quite a few times now and figured I should finally review it. This is my go-to tiramisu recipe, hands down. I only have two changes/recommendations: 1. for the zabaglione, you need to whisk non-stop throughout the process, and boil for 1-2 min. if not a little longer (eyeball it and remove from heat when the foam dies down and it starts to look like a thicker custard; it will be thinner than normal custard however). Once removing it from the heat, act like it's a roux and keep whisking thoroughly for several minutes until it cools down. If you leave it untouched when cooling slightly, the eggs may separate as they continue to cook in the hot mixture, even when removed from heat. 2. I would recommend with the other reviews to triple (or at least double) the coffee/rum mixture, and then divide it among two little bowls so you have an equal amount that gets drizzled on your two lady finger layers. If you triple the coffee/rum, use hard lady fingers. Also save the cocoa powder dusting until right before serving, as others have suggested. The longer this sits in the fridge, the better, so make a few days in advance if you can. YUM!

A really good recipe. I have made it three times now, and I'm going for a fourth. The only thing I have to say is to definitely use espresso. The other coffee is just too faint.  If you plan to let it rest for more than a day and you want a strong coffee flavor, use either slightly stale or hard ladyfingers, which makes sure that it won't become a soggy mess. I also recommend that you use a taller dish than a larger short one. This makes the layers more defined when eating it. Overall, it is an excellent desert,  and a perfect substitute for birthday cake.

I read a lot of reviews before I started.  After reading so many, I decided I could hardly make a mistake because there were so many people who said the opposite of each other.  I thought it turned out quite well and I will make it again.

Love this stuff!! I did make a few changes. I used Café Bustello Espresso coffee. To the coffee I added Kahlua and a bit of sugar. The first layer of soaked cookies I let the extra coffee drip into the pan.  I folded into the egg custard some fresh whipped cream not sweetened. Then I repeated this step to the second layer of cookies. Once I added the second layer of cookies I sprinkled a bit of cocoa powder before adding the custard.  Then I finished as per the instructions and decorated the top with a stencil of a cocoa rose! Like other reviews I let this sit overnight so all the flavors could mingle and OMGoodness was this great! Love Love Love this one.

This is good, but not a traditional tiramisu. The custard gives it a completely different texture and flavor. Espresso is a must.

Absolutely the best! I'd never made Tiramisu before, though I've eaten it often. This was better than the best I'd had before. I left the ladyfingers whole and just poured espresso over them with a spoon. Used instant espresso and it worked a treat. Added a bit of chocolate liqueur to the espresso and a drizzle of chocolate syrup as it was served. Rave reviews from family and friends at Christmas dinner!

Delicious and a huge hit at our Christmas gathering!!! I used espresso made in my Nespresso machine. Like suggested, I doubled the coffee and rum. I made mini tiramasu in individual cocktail cups and made chocolate lattice to garnish. I will definitely be making this again- everyone loved it!!!!

I've made this multiple times now for special occasion desserts. Every time guests positively give compliments...
Very easy to make, also makes this a hit with me...another tip I tried was after the cooked egg tokes had a chance to cool off at room temperature, I slowly wisked in the mascarpone cheese. I found that the amount of heavy cream was not quite enough if making a double layer, 
I also added rum to the coffee, and whipped cream.

I  made this and followed  the  recipe  with some of the  other reviewers  recommendations. I  used instant espresso, kahlua and I  let it sit for 2 days  in the  refrigerator. All of  these things made this  recipe  very tasty indeed. There's  none left. The  reason  for the minus one star is that  this is very heavy  tiramisu. It is not light and fluffy  as some tiramisu  can be. Except  for  the  heaviness  of the eggs  and  cream, this  taste  like  a  world  class  tiramisu  and it was a hit for Christmas  dessert.

Fantastic.  As others suggested, I eliminated the water and used a bottle of clam juice instead. I also substituted olive oil for the butter. I prepared the broth a few days in advance and then froze it until the morning of the day I served the dish. I also added some red pepper flakes for a bit of a punch.

More of a pudding custard than a zabligone.   Marsala is an essential ingredient to balance texture with flavor.

My Italian husband’s mom made her amazing Tiramisu every Christmas for the family gathering. Sadly she passed this year leaving a huge hole in our hearts. I decided to try to make it for Christmas tonight but was so nervous that it just would not do her justice. I made it yesterday and let it sit in the fridge overnight. I tried a piece this morning, because I wasn’t about to present it without a taste test. All I can say is OMG!!!  Nonna will be so proud of me. I used Milano Giant Lady Finger cookies. Because they do not have sugar on them I sprinkled a bit of sugar to each layer.  I also added an extra teaspoon of rum then matched the rum amount with the same amount of Kaluah. I will definitely be making this amazing recipe again and again!!! Thank you All Recipes for helping me bring a little bit of Nonna to our family Christmas.

This is the best Tiramisu recipe. I added rum and amaretto to the espresso coffee and it was delicious. I also used 2 cups of heavy whipping cream.

Followed recipe exactly and it's delicious! I have made it twice, 1st time in a glass dish casserole dish, 2nd time in spring foam pan. A few tips, 1) constantly stir the sugar egg yolk mixture while on the stove and 2) use a hand mixer to mix marscapone into egg mixture after its been cooled to make its smooth.

Came out fantastic. Multiple foodies went back for seconds. I ended up in a round cake dish with higher sides so did three layers with a smaller surface area. Recipe was easy to make with the right instruments.

As suggested I doubled the coffee and rum mixture for some extra flavor. Unfortunately, for me this made my bottom layer of cookies particularly soggy. If you want a bit of extra flavor I would double the coffee but keep the rum the same. Otherwise, a great recipe! Will be making again.

This recipe was fabulous. I think my guests wanted to lick the bowl. I did use my kitchen aid to help mix up the ingredients as I have rheumatoid arthritis and I must say it was as easy as "pie" Pardon the pun. Definitely a keeper and requests are already being made to bring to the next family function!

This was so delicious!! It was the first time I've made a tiramisu and I was taking it to a family dinner so I was really nervous how it would turn out. It was amazing and a dessert I will definitely make again. I made it on a Thursday night for a Saturday dinner, as many suggested to make ahead of time. I also doubled the coffee and rum like others suggested.

Too fussy and ingredients were extremely expensive.  Cheese alone was 26 bucks. Adding the cost of brandy put the price to over 50 bucks. Cheaper to buy it pre-made. Made it the 1st time per recipe and was extremely disappointed as it was nothing but mush.  Wasted time and lots of money. Made it a 2nd time. I bought generic cream cheese, powdered vanilla pudding and angelfood cake. Made the pudding, added the cream cheese,  split the cake longways, covered with espresso and brandy and layered it in a loaf pan, refrigerated it and then topped with cocoa and chocolate. Didn't need the bowl of Ice or eggs at all.

I personally prefer the lady fingers to be dry so I decided to mix 1 tablespoon of espresso powder and 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder and rather than soaking the lady fingers, layered them with the mixture in between the whipped cream and the mascarpone.

OMG!!! This is the BEST Tiramisu I've ever made! I've tried several recipes from this site looking for the Perfect recipe and I need not look any further. I am a tiramisu snob so I am difficult to please but this recipe, although a bit time consuming, is well worth the effort. 

It was completely eaten in less than 15 minutes...it was that good! I am planning on making again. Yummmmmmm!

This was delicious... but I did make one change.  I made all components as directed but rather then layering the egg yolk mixture and the whipped cream; I folded them together and layered that mixture on top of the ladyfingers. It worked beautifully  and I would make it that way again. :)

All I can say is wow!!! A few modifications: I used 2 shots of expresso instead of drip coffee!! It really added the depth and taste a lot of people stated it lacked. I also doubled the cream and used Sabroso Licor de Cafe. This dish is a definite party pleaser and a must try!!

I have always loved tiramisu but was too intimidated to make it. Glad I tried and made this. I made it first thing after breakfast and kept it in the refrigerator until dinner dessert. Oh was it good. And a lot easier to make than I expected. Definitely a five star recipe.

I swear, this tiramisu recipe give sooooo much better result than what you find in another restaurant. I made it twice and still wanna make it again and again. Because if you try it once, you will never stop to eat it.

I absolutely love this recipe. Since my local store doesn't carry lady fingers, I replaced that with vanilla pound cake, which made it super rich and creamy. I'm always asked to make this and that makes me feel awesome.

I gave this Five Stars because it is ALMOST PERFECTION....with a few tweaks , I think, for me, it now 'IS' Perfection.

First, I needed it bigger! To fill a 9x13 dish.

I added 2 egg yolks. I used heavy cream instead of milk and increased that to 1 cup. Increased the Sugar to 1 cup.
Used an additional 4 oz. of marscapone. 

I also used 1 pint of cream and added a Tbsp. of Sugar to the whipped cream and increased the vanilla. All this required using more Lady Fingers...3 packages...(there will be a few extra)...This fills the pan completely. 
Some dark chocolate curls made with a potato peeler adds a nice touch and great flavor.
As others have said, it tastes much better after 24 hours.

Used 2-1/2 cups of coffee and 7 tbsp kahlua. Recipe was pretty good but not the best tiamisu I’ve had.

EXCELLENT recipe. I followed it to the letter and it came out better than expected, better than many tiramisus I've had in nice restaurants.

I made this for my husband's 44th birthday & everybody loved it!! I let it sit for 2 days before eating it as others suggested on the comments & it was out of this world delicious!  A real keeper!  I also took the advise to double the coffee concoction.  Also my ladyfingers were soft and small so I didn't dunk them as it would have made for mush but instead pastry brushed the coffee on. 
I made mine in a springform pan and lined the sides with wax paper...the pan pulled apart beautifully (wax paper came off nicely, made for great looking edges)after setting and then I lined the edges with ladyfingers & some other little touches.  I also dusted with cocoa before serving...Beautiful  presentation and oh SO yummy!

The first thing to say is that this is one of the best tiramisu that I have ever tasted.  It was not to sweet and not over powered by the rum.  I did double the amount of the coffee/rim mixture and I brushed it on instead of drizzling it.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

This is an awesome recipe!  The only change I made was to double espresso and rum. A few other reviewers said to do this and they were right. I will be making this again. Delicious!!

First time I made this was for a dinner party. Everyone loved it, including me! I read most of the other reviews which helped. As someone suggested- do not soak the biscuits they will turn to mush. Just dip in and out of the coffee/ rum mixture quickly. I made mine in a 9x9 pan and made 3 layers ending with the custard. Also make 24 hours ahead for the flavors to meld. Dusted the top with the cocoa just before serving. Scrumptious dessert!

This is an excellent, classic tiramisu recipe. Flavorful, and not overly sweet. I have made it twice, and received many enthusiastic compliments! I agree with (and followed) the suggestions to double the coffee and rum, and to refrigerate at least 24 hours before serving. Wonderful.

I have made this multiple times.  No matter who eats it, they love it. One time I totally forgot to mix in the marscopone (what???). Realized it AFTER I the layering. So it wound up in one big bowl, mushed together. Still a hit! I have also used regular sponge cake when lady fingers were unavailable. Still tastes amazing. A co worker expects it for her birthday every year. No one seems to mind.

I came across this recipe years ago and since then made it at least 20 times. Everyone who ever had it loved it!! I make it exactly as if except for two things. I skip the rum because we're an alcohol free home and I end up using more coffee.  I make it 2 days before so the flavors have time to blend.

Thank you so much for the delicious  recipe!!

If you want the cheesy flavor to stand out, and be noticeable as the coffee is, I recommend that you add more cream cheese--not mascarpone--to the custard from the recipe. I added about 200g(or ~1 cup), but it still wasn't cheesy enough for me. 

Aside from that, I used a mix of approx. 2/3 cup instant coffee and 1/3 cup of espresso for my ladyfingers--and they turned out phenomenal!

Overall, it was really nice. My folks and I really loved it.

I made this twice!the first time I doubled the expresso and rum, whick was way to much liquid and caused the bottom to be soggy. Also I must of been heavy handed with the rum and it was overpowering. The second time I made it, I only used 1/2 cup espresso and 4 tablespoons rum (should of used 5). I found the trick to make the ladyfingers is to put a small amount of espresso/rum on the bottom of a bowl and quickly flip the fingers. They were not soggy this time. You do not want to have so much liquid that it covers the ladyfingers. All in all, this is the best tasting tiramisu I have ever had! It was a hit at Easter ! I will make this many more times! Thank you for the recipe and everyone for the tips in the reviews!!!!

Oh. My. Goodness!  WOW.  Like WOW. The most amazing, restaurant-quality dessert I've made in a long time.  I made it exactly as directed, but I had to alter it 1/2 way through.  No big deal...  I just needed more coffee. Which meant I needed more rum.  lol. Seriously fantastic.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thank you!

I  made this recipe twice this month.  The first time I split the hard ladyfingers and combined the egg mixture and whip cream mixture together for one layer.  It was a heavenly mixture.  I dunk the ladyfingers in a shallow plate
 of strong coffee and rum. i did have to double the mixture  to get enough to dip all the cookies.  Only the bottom is moistened and it still holds its shape when transferred to the casserole dish for layering. I make two layers, cookies and cream, cookies and cream.  Garnish with unsweetened cocoa and chocolate curls.   Turned out great.  Of course, better at least one day after making.  The second time I used whole cookies and layered the egg mixture, then the whip cream.  I also sweetened the cream slightly.  Same finishing details.  Another big hit.  Definitely liked making a cooked egg version.  Need to improve the smoothness of the custard, but it didn't seem to affect the dish. Next time i will try beating the egg yolk and sugar with the beaters, then cooking.   The egg whites are not used in this dessert.

I don't cook or bake much but love to challenge myself when I do. This was the first tiramisu I've ever made and it was pretty easy to make and turned out way better than I expected. It was so good! 
I recommend doubling the rum and coffee mixture. I used spice rum instead of white and it tasted great! Everyone, even the picky people in my family loved this!

This tiramisu is spectacular!! As many other reviews say, it is a must to double the coffee/rum mixture. I also opted to fold my whipped cream into the mascarpone custard rather than layering it to create a lighter, heavenly custard, but that is just my preference. If you like tiramisu, this is a must-try!! It will become your go to recipe!!

The recipe was easy -- taste fantastic, but because I could not get the yoke mixture to blend nicely with the cream, the texture was a bit lumpy.

Very easy to make! I took note of previous reviewers to double the coffee/rum mixture. I made mine with Kahlua and had it sit in my fridge for 2 days. Instead of drizzling, I dipped the ladyfingers in the mixture for about 1-2 seconds, and after 2 days of setting my springform pan was leaking! I might try drizzling/brushing the mixture onto the ladyfingers next time to keep my ladyfingers from getting too soggy. I also followed another reviewer's (SLJ6's) comments about folding the whipped cream into the mascarpone/egg mixture and dusted the top with black cocoa powder. I'm not a Tiramisu lover, but this has converted me into one! Made it for a Tiramisu lover and they loved it as well! Thank you!

Really delicious, set up perfectly. I made the custard the day before and swapped the rum for a Tbsp. of vanilla syrup (the kind you put in hot drinks). It sliced beautifully. Interesting how it hits the perfect sweetness since only the custard layer is sweetened. Thanks for sharing.

I have made this a few times now and my husband and kids rave about it. He claims it is better than the tiramisu you get at Italian restaurants. I doubled the espresso and rum and it turns out perfect (do not triple, it makes it taste too much like liquor and makes it too strong).

AMAZING recipe, this was so easy to make. Like some other reviewers have said, I doubled the rum and coffee mixture. I also used espresso instead of coffee and this worked out great. The flavors really meld best if you keep it a bit longer in the fridge; 24 hours at least. At 2 days, it was even better but I wouldn't keep it any longer than that. Not that you will have much left over, this is a hit even with my mother and father, who don't even like desserts!

It was super easy and very very popular. I couldn't find ladyfingers, so used magherite Italian cookies, and I didn't have rum, so used Kahlua. I'd never made tiramisu before- I'd always assumed it was laborious and complicated, but this was pretty easy and it came out really really well. I made it for my brother's 50th and people kept coming back for more helpings. Thanks for this recipe!

Absolutely delicious! Followed the recipe almost exactly except I added half a vanilla bean to the whipped cream plus 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar for a little sweetness. Added Kahlua to the coffee instead of rum. Also, used a spring form pan and decorated the sides with lady fingers. Instead of cocoa powder on top I shaved dark chocolate on top. Crowd pleasing! would make again!

This was great! It's rich and delicious. I would have dipped the fingers rather than drizzle them with coffee- I didn't think they absorbed enough coffee. I also used espresso as opposed to coffee and used 2x the amount suggested.  Really worth trying out!

CONS - It was more custard like than I prefer.  Also it lacked enough sweetness like others have said.  

PROS - It was simple to make, decent taste, good dessert to make ahead.

I've made this twice so far. The first time was a disaster because all I could find was soft lady fingers. Bad news. It was a flat soggy mess. I knew this was supposed to be an amazing dessert, so I dropped another $20 on ingredients, and found the correct lady fingers. The directions call for two 3oz packs. The ones I found came with two sleeves in a 6oz package. I bought two, and ended up using 1-1/2 packs because I used a little larger dish. I also followed the advice of others. I only chilled the custard for 30 minutes before I mixed in the moscarpone. I folded the whipped cream into the custard instead of leaving them separate. I used a cup of coffee and 6 Tbsp of kahlua to dip the lady fingers, and it was one of the most pleasant desserts I've ever had. It leaves you wanting so much more, but it's gone before you know it. It's light, fluffy, not too sweet, and just fantastic. I definitely recommend this if you like cooking fancy stuff that people don't see everyday.

Step 2 really should be broken into 2 separate steps. Combining 2 instructions involving 2 parts that are not joining together at that moment could be confusing (says the person who just put mascarpone into cream).

So excellent.  Seriously the best tiramisu I've ever tasted!  I did double the coffee and brandy, and learning quickly how quickly to dip the lady fingers so that they wouldn't absorb to much.  Let it set for about 24 hours. Everyone went crazy for it.

It was well received, I reduced the Rum and doubled the liquids, which was barely enough for the ladyfingers.

I will make it again!

This was an awesome tiramisu.  It was very traditional, which we like.  I followed the other reviewers and doubled the rum/coffee mixture and sprinkled that over the lady fingers.  I did break the lady fingers in half, but I won't do that next time.  We conducted an experiment and served it after six hours because that's what the recipe called for and that was all the time I had for it's intended purpose.  We then had a piece 24 hours later and 48 hours later.  Wow!!  What a difference!  It was merely good at 6 hours, great at 24 hours and phenomenal at 48 hours.

Different from my original recipe but excellent.  I always need more expresso & kaluha than listed to get a great coffee flavour that everyone loves.

I loved this recipe so much and made the lady fingers myself! If you do make lady fingers always use a pastry bag I can't stress that one enough.

I've made this recipe three times now and it's been a hit every time.  It's not difficult to make at all and tastes heavenly! I did make two changes: In the filling I used half & half instead of milk. Huge difference in the creaminess factor! And, I used Kahlua instead of rum, because I didn't have rum.  Tasted better than the rum, to us. Just as other readers have said, I did double the coffee/kahlua mixture and let it refrigerate for 24 hours.  We love it!!

I never made Tiramisu before before and, after doing a lot of browsing,  this recipie stuck! I used a double boiler method for cooking the egg yolks so it would be harder to scramble them. And I didnt layer it, instead I mixed the whipped cream into the egg and cheese mixture. I also added 1 cup of sugar instead of 2/3 of a cup. I let it sit 15 hours before the wait was too long! SOO DELICIOUS! I'll wait for full 24 hours before my next slice.

OMG I've never had Tiramisu before, I LOVE this recipe.  I made it for a dinner party and increased the coffee and rum mixture as other reviewers mentioned.  I didn't split the lady fingers and dipped them in about 3/4 c coffee and 1/4 c of spiced rum.  It's rich in flavor and creamy melt in your mouth yummy. Thanks for sharing.

Hi, I loved it, but made it with the following modifications. I added the vanilla to the zabaione (the egg, sugar, milk custard) and I whipped the heavy cream until soft peaks. Further, I first softened the mascarpone and then added the softened substance to the cold custard. Finally, I folded the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture. Very gently, don't over beat it.  Also, If you soak the cookies into the coffee/rum mixture the way it is shown in the video, first you will have a very soggy tiramisu, and second you will need ten times more coffee/rum mixture. What I prefer to do is just dip the cookies into the mixture really fast, less then a second on each side. You will need to use your fingers, of course.  Good luck. I have made tiramisu with this modifications twice  already and it was scrumptious.

This Tiramisu is awesome, I love Olive Gardens and this recipe tastes almost exactly like it, Definitely double the rum and coffee because I ran out only making the suggested amount. I don't think you'll ever need another Recipe!

This is my absolute favorite, tried and true recipe for Tiramisu. It is better-than-restaurant quality and so easy to make! The hardest part about making it is keeping your hands off of it while it sets in the fridge. The only tweak I make to this recipe is using Kahlua instead of plain rum. Original or salted caramel flavors work beautifully. I totally recommend it as it is always a crowd pleaser!

Best tiramisu I ever had! Made for a Coworker's going away luncheon. He loves tiramisu and said it was the best he's ever had. His wife asked me for the recipe. Very simple to make, but sublime!!! I'm in charge of making this delightful, scrumptious dessert for future luncheons. Thank you for this gem!!!

Like other reviewers, I doubled the rum and coffee to add stronger flavor. It was perfect, and certainly not too strong. This also fit (barely) into my 8x8 pan, although 9x9 would be ideal.

I doubled the espresso and rum mixture, and put some cocoa between the first layers as well. I also used a full batch of homemade ladyfingers: (Ladyfingers recipe by Roxanne).  Because of this, the 7-11 pan was just a bit too small.  I took it to a party and it was loved by all, and I didn't get to take any home!

This is always dessert for Christmas.  I use only hard lady fingers as they soak up the moisture without getting mushy.  Follow recipe but use Irish Cream as the alcohol.  Only difference is I beat 3 egg whites to stiff peaks and fold into mascarpone/cream mixture.  Have only seen one other recipe that does this (probably concerns re: health issues but I've not had problems).  This step adds volume to the mascarpone filling while also making it a tad "lighter" (not so heavy).   This recipe is NOT difficult and it comes together well.  Better to let it sit 24-36 hours once assembled to let flavours develop.

I made this for Christmas dinner this year!  Yummy!  
I did double the rum and strong coffee as was suggested by
some reviewers.  Definitely a must!  
I will be making this again!    Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Excellent! I added the whipped cream to the mascarpone mix and doubled the coffee/rum, even more than doubled. I didn't split the ladyfingers and I left everything else the same as the recipe. The only thing that I seemed to notice was that for my taste wasn't sweet enough but not a lot. It was very good!

Have not tasted it yet.  Having some of my golf girlfriends over for and Italian night tonight and looking forward to trying this.  All the ingredients tasted good going into it so I'm thinking it will be very good!  I did enjoy it very much.  I don't have any alcohol in my home so I used a dram or whole bottle of butter rum extract normally used for candy making.  It looked to be about 1 teaspoon.  I think it was a little strong tasting.  My guest asked to take some home because she loved it since it did not taste like too much coffee.  I'm going to try making it again reducing the butter rum and increasing the espresso coffee.

I doubt that this recipe needs another 5 star review but that's not going to stop me! Tiramisu is my husbands' favorite dessert so I've made it a lot and tried many at restaurants. I feel like I'm echoing everyone else when I say WOW.....this is the best!!! I thought it was odd that everyone said it tasted best after 48 hours but they were absolutely right (we tried it after 24 hours and 48 hours). This is the perfect dessert for a dinner party as you can make well in advance. I made a few small changes....folded the whipped cream into the custard, used Kahlua instead of rum (one cup strong coffee + 4 tbsp. Kahlua), and grated Valrhona dark chocolate on top instead of the cocoa. It held up really well even after two days of refrigeration.

I really loved this. Though, in my laziness I didn't quite read the instructions, and had already mixed the whipped cream in with the mascapone mixture. That tasted excellent.

I made two of these for  Christmas day and I have to say it was a winner! I did make a few changes after reading other reviews;
I used Kahlua instead of rum, expresso coffee, I folded the egg mixture with the whip cream. I had only enough ladyfingers to stand in one cheesecake tin, but both were fab. I used Trader Joes ladyfingers (soft n I used them whole) and doubled the coffee & Kahlua. Great recipe....a keeper!

I will make this every Christmas now!  Delicious!  Fits perfectly in a 7" X 11" glass pan.  Some useful hints:   I used three-fourths cup of STRONG brewed coffee and 4 tablespoons of rum.  Next year I will use slightly less coffee . . . I felt the ladyfingers were a bit mushy, although everyone else disagreed. . . . Use an electric mixer to add in the mascarpone cheese.  Have all ingredients at room temperature before starting!   Wait at least 24 hours before serving it.  Keep it refrigerated.  Add cocoa powder just before serving.

Definitely, A Winner!                                                                                              Made It as my Signature Christmas Dish 2016!                         Absolutely  Nervous about making it, but the recipe was clear, and the video really helped.   I tweaked a lot, 9 eggs,  1/12 pounds of mascarpone, vanilla  & sugar to taste.(a must) increased greatly the coffee/Kahlua mixture at least 1/2 cup of each.  My only miss-step was 2nd guessing the strength of the coffee  I  watered it down, It seemed too strong, & bitter with the expresso, but it was needed, and the coffee flavor  was faint. The custard was smooth & flavorful, and the whip cream was very light. All in All  Awesome! Got Rave Reviews from  The Men Folks Too!

Absolutely excellent. Followed recipe exactly. Next time will drizzle a little Kahlua in the bottom of the pan so the ladyfingers are especially moist. Make 2 days in advance for best results.

I've picked up a couple tricks for this, having made this more than a few times now as my oldest son's  chosen birthday dessert.  

Tips: when doing the custard, boil the water in the pot you are using as a double boiler(which I recommend as opposed to direct heat), then remove the water from heat for a couple moments before setting the bowl containing the milk/sugar/yolk mixture on top, then bring the water back to a rolling simmer on medium to medium high heat.  This worked much better and heated the egg mixture more quickly than starting the whole thing off cold and I had a nicer custard this year than I ever have in the past.

I like to add a few drops of vanilla and a dab of butter too just to keep the bubbles down from the whisking, I don't bring the custard to a boil either but heat it to 165F for a couple minutes  CONSTANTLY WHISKING(for the love of Mike don't stop the whisking) before removing from the heat STILL WHISKING until it cools a little.  The whisking is key, once those yolks start to curdle(think scrambled eggs) you're kind of done for, things will still taste fine but the texture doesn't stay smooth like we like.  Since this is a birthday dessert for my kid I switch out the rum for orange juice, but I leave the coffee.  I'm trying it with a springform pan this year, and hoping it works out and doesn't ooze too much, we'll see how it goes for that but I know it will taste great like always.  Hope this little tidbit helps!

I tend to just drizzle the coffee(

Thank you for this wonderful recipe. I made this last night for our Christmas dessert for 10 people, mostly Europeans who have tasted Tiramisu in Italy.  They unanimously said this was the best tiramisu they have had. I made a couple of changes, I blended the egg yolks and sugar cold in the blender instead of on the double boiler,  I used Kahlua instead of rum and I added vanilla to the whipped cream.  
Big big recommend. Quick and easy to make too.

Turned out wonderfully! I made the lady fingers from scratch & love doing the whole thing from scratch. I really enjoyed making it with the detailed recipe. The taste was excellent. It went so fast I didn't get a chance to photograph it!

Amazing! So delicious!! The 3 things I have added in this recipe was only because it made sense..
1. Use more coffee -8oz. ( 1/4 cup not enough to soak)
2. Used spiced rum- 6 tablespoons add it to the coffee
3. Add 2 table spoons of sugar to whip cream

That's it! This will taste like a rich layer of creamy, cakey heaven!!!!

You have to make this!!!!!

That's my tiramisu! And all my friend circles are getting addicted to it. I'm making it the night before most of my visiting occasions. :)
However. There's one more element I add. I whip egg whites and fold it into the final cream. That way it becomes super fluffy. Insane!!!

Recipe was very good. Substituted milk for half and half because that was all I had. Doubled coffee and rum and made it a day in advance like most reviewers suggested and it was great.

Loved this recipe, but would somehow try to make the coffee flavor a little stronger next time. Perhaps, I'd used espresso instead of coffee or whip some coffee flavor into the cream.

This was very easy to make, delicious, and wonderful to have made it advance.  As previously noted, there is not enough coffee/rum liquid.  I made 3/4 cup coffee and added 3 tablespoons of rum.  Also, I could not cut ladyfingers in half lengthwise so i just left them as they came.  This worked fine.

 I left the coffee and rum in a tall measuring cup after mixing and quickly dipped each end of the lady finger in the liquid.  This created a wonderful coffee/rum flavor in the tiramisu.

As one person suggested, I experimented and brushed on the coffee/rum liquid on one layer of the ladyfingers. (In lieu of dipping the ladyfingers.)  This left the ladyfinger too dry and also did not flavor the mascarpone and cream layers very well.

I also let the tiramisu refrigerate for two days as suggested.  This helped take the stress off the day of party prep work.

Bottom line-  Triple the coffee rum mix, don't worry about cutting up the ladyfingers, and otherwise follow the recipe and it will be wonderful!

My son actually started making this a few years ago and we all loved it. I am making it to take to a Christmas party this year. Definitely better after it sits for a day or two and we do double the coffee also. We had tiramisu at an Italian restaurant in New York a few months back and it was no better than this recipe!

The Tiramisu turned out great ! This  is my first try at my son's favorite dessert. I followed the recipe as written , with the exception of following other people's advice about more expresso and rum. I tripled the expresso and rum to make sure I would have enough.
When it was time to work on the lady fingers ( I used the  Savoiardi Balocco "hard" ladyfingers. I laid the ladyfingers flat, sugar side down. I then used a medicine dropper with a plunger (mine equaled 1 teas total). I think any size would work. I filled the plunger to the top with the expresso/rum and plunged it over the entire ladyfinger covering it as desired. After completely them all, I turned the ladyfingers over and did the same thing on the "sugar" side.
This method worked quite well and I was able to control the amount of liquid so they did not get soggy. I will definitely be making this again!  I will add the photo if I can figure out how.

The flavor is definitely there. I used Kahlua instead of rumI and ended up using more coffee/Kahlua mixture because I was soaking the lady fingers instead of drizzling. Also, next time I'll use an 8x8 pan and do three layers of lady fingers instead of two.

Amazing! A definite crowd pleaser.  No double-boiler needed.  Easy to make and very pretty in a glass or crystal bowl.

Recommendations:
Substitute brandy for rum.
For an alcohol free version, use Trader Joe's alcohol free vanilla flavoring instead of rum or brandy.
Suggested sugar (or sweetener) in the whipped cream is a personal preference, we found it was not needed.
Drizzle coffee and brandy over the top of ladyfingers, no need to cut in 1/2. 
Use soft ladyfingers with little or no icing (ex: Ralph's Fresh brand) vs. hard version with icing like a biscotti.
Allow to set up overnight in fridge to slice like cake.  Otherwise chill and (spoon) scoop out into pretty bowls to serve.

This recipe is absolutely amazing! Probably the best thing I have ever made. The only thing I would suggest is to double or triple the coffee/rum mixture. I used espresso and since I like my tiramisu very moist I had to make two separate cups since I ran out. I really wanted to soak the ladyfinges thoroughly. Best tiramisu I've ever had and very easy to make.

I have made this twice now. The first time I curdled the custard (it happened so fast!). it just started separating. So... I took it off the heat and mixed in the marscapone while it was hot. That created a runny mixture s- somewhat creamy. I then mixed in the whipped cream into that mixture with hopes that it would stiffen up. No such luck. I ended up putting the whole thing together. I called it Tiramisoup. People loved it even if was a bit runny.  So... the second time I created the custard with a home made double boiler. Because I was so paranoid about curdling the custard I took it WAY too soon. I put it into the fridge to cool... and guess what... runny. To the internet...  realized I had not gotten it hot enough. Read a bunch of websites... finally got the nerve to take it out of the fridge and put it back on the double boiler. This time I watched the temperature with a meat thermometer. Stirred it the whole time. Took it off when it was @145 degrees. It was coating the back of the spoon - which is what  I read is supposed to happen. This time it was fabulous! Creamy and wonderful. That is the hardest part of this recipe. It took me @ 15/20 minutes to get the custard thick with the double boiler. Guess it takes longer than the stove-top way.

I've made this 3 times, one time tripling the recipe (1 to keep, 1 to give away and 1 to share at a neighborhood party). The only thing I don't do per the recipe is RUM. I use Kahlua and I use about 25% more liquid (kahlua/espresso mix). Best recipe ever! oooh, also, I've made more of the custard to allow for making tiramisu ice cream!!!!!!! I refrigerated the custard for a day and then before adding it to my ice cream maker, I added more heaving cream, more mascarpone cheese and kahlua/espresso mixture. Before serving the ice cream, sift a small amount of dark cocoa on top. Love! What a crowd pleaser it is! Thanks so much for this recipe!

Update: made this 5 times now.  Continues to be a birthday cake request by neighbors. And due to the fact that  we left one of the Tiramisù desserts in the refrigerator when we meant to take it out of state for Thanksgiving. When we returned home, we weren't willing to throw it away w/o confirming the eggs or milk were too old. It was even tastier after 8 days vs. Our typical 2-3 days we used to allow for the flavors to meld/deepen. Now, we purposefully allow extra days in the fridge.

This recipe is great and not to hard to make. You definitely need more coffee to soak the ladyfingers. I also would recommend either using much less rum or none at all. With the amount listed in the recipe it is way too much rum for me.

Fantastic!  Made it for several birthdays.  Love how stark the whipped cream portion is.  However, I did make the clutch decision to put about a half tablespoon of Kahlua in, and it super yummy.  We'll see if I want to keep it tomorrow, at my birthday party :)

I made this dessert with my boyfriend and it was so rich and decadent. We used Sweet Marsala wine instead of rum and  a different method (double boiler) to make the custard. Dust it with Valrhona Hot COCOA powder because that's what we had and now prefer this type over the traditional unsweetened cocoa powder. Great recipe to try if you love tiramisu

Okay, I don't usually write reviews HOWEVER,  I made this version of Tiramisu to take to my husband's Sicilian family get together.  When my husband's Sicilian Great Aunt DEMANDED that I share the recipe, I knew I had a winner! I followed the directions to the T, except for the Rum. Patron  makes a tequila based coffee liqueur that I had on hand,  which was apparently what made my  dessert stand out! Give it a try, it will not disappoint (or leave leftovers!)!

The flavor was spot on but the custard did not set at all. So disappointing! I want to put this in the ice cream machine and make something delicious. Doubled coffee and rum for ladyfingers.

This was delicious, I used pound cake because I couldn't get lady fingers. And I used rum flavoring not rum. It was all gone at the end of the dinner everyone loved it.

Perfection! Totally worth every effort and every calorie. I skipped the alcohol and definitely used more espresso, other than that, this recipe is perfect. Would make any other adjustments. Thanks for sharing. It's a keeper for sure!

This was incredible!! A bit time consuming because I did a few things differently per other reviewers recommendations. Instead of cooking the egg, sugar, and milk in a pan, I used a double boiler to avoid direct heat to the eggs and risk scrambling them. It took me at least 30-40 minutes of constant stirring to get the perfect thickness to my custard, but it was soooo worth it! I also added a 1/3 cup of sugar and a little extra vanilla to the whipped cream. For the coffee mixture I did double the recipe and used Malibu rum, only because it's what we had in the cupboard. I did a very quick dunk on the hard lady fingers and they held up well.

Ok, so I read through the reviews before I tackled my first tiramisu. I did make more coffee/rum mixture, it's needed. I used the hard ladyfingers, they came out perfectly, not too soggy. You do have to stir the egg mixture constantly or you will get scrambled eggs. I did combine the custard and whipped cream, came out delicious and was super easy. But next time I will keep the layers separate to see if I like it better. Oh, and I used a 7oz package of ladyfingers, not enough. And a 7x11 pan is just a bit too small, mine was overflowing. And by the way, it was delicious!!!

I will never make a different Tiramisu.  I follow the recipe exactly except for one small exception -- I double the coffee/rum and I submerge the ladyfingers in it one by one for a few seconds instead of drizzling.  Absolutely delicious version.

Always a hit.  I use homemade pound cake sliced into strips (or store bought if I am rushed) instead of lady fingers.  I also double the coffee mix as recommended by others.

Made it for a dinner party and everyone went wild over this. I sprinkled some limoncello on the ladyfingers to give it a little more moisture and kick.  A Winner in my books!

OMG this was delicious!  I ended up using brandy instead of rum.  I would probably use more coffee and brandy to soak the lady fingers next time.

Well, everyone loved this. I'm not a tiramisu fan (or a dessert fan, in general), but the others cleaned their plates. Did use more coffee and soaked the ladyfingers in it, other than that, I respected the recipe entirely.

I made this for my dads birthday and it was AMAZING, I read a bunch of other reviews and took their advice. I doubled the coffee rum amount and let the lady fingers soak for an hours while the egg milk and sugar mix cooled in the fridge, I also put the egg milk and sugar mix in the freezer for the last ten minutes and it made a world of difference with the texture and I added more vanilla to the whip cream. the most important thing I did however was let it sit in the fridge covered with aluminum foil for more than 24 hours. The only things I wish I had done differently was not use so much fillings on the first layer, and used more lady fingers/ left them whole. I hope this helps somebody!

Made this for my son's 14th birthday, at his request. Since he is gluten free, I used gluten free lady fingers, the crunchy kind. I didn't split them into 2; I quickly dipped them in the coffee/rum, and they turned out soft, not mushy. I did make it 2 days ahead, and like many reviewers suggested, I increased the coffee to 3/4 cup and 4 tbsp of rum.  Even my younger kids didn't notice the taste of rum.
I used a spring form pan, and used the entire 2 packs of gluten free lady fingers (5 1/2 oz each). I put ladyfingers all around the pan (soaked side out, flat side in), chopping them to the size of the pan, then I layered the cream and the whipped cream, put the rest of the lady fingers (had to get creative with all the little pieces), then another layer of cream and whipped cream. Covered with foil, and let it set in the fridge for 2 days. Added the cocoa powder just before serving. Discovered a big finger print in the whipped cream when I took it out of the fridge. Don't know what happened; all 4 kids  claim innocence...

Very good - a little too "light"  in the flavor department for my tastes though..  Doubled the coffee and used kahluah, still could use more coffee flavor. Also sat 48 hours in the fridge. In all honestly, pass on this recipe and opt for Ina Garten's Mocha Icebox cake.  It's vastly superior in every way.

This recipe is awesome - my first tiramisu was a huge success :) thank you! And I followed everyone's recommendation to double the amount of rum and coffee. Please remember to dip gently but not completely soak the ladyfingers in the rum and coffee, otherwise you might use up the mixture very quickly.

This is definitely a go to Tiramisu recipe.  I'm a Tiramisu addict and have tried a many both in the states and in Italy. There are different variations and this one will NOT disappoint.  Agree you should let it set overnight to let the flavors meld.  Thank you for the recipe!!!

After reading other reviews, I made this dessert two days before a large dinner party , to let the flavours come together . The only change I made to the recipe was to double the rum and coffee amounts. After two days in the refrigerator , the big taste test, and ...Wow! Best tiramisu I have ever tasted!

Fantastic!!! This tiramisu is better than my favorite Italian restaurant! I swapped out the rum for Kahula and used Italian espresso. I will make it again! Thanks for the recipe!

This was great!  We used jameson instead of the traditional rum.  Suggest using a very small pan or doubling the recipe bc we used a corning ware 7x10 or something and only got one delicious layer of each as a result.  Didn't taste any different but not very photogenic.  It became known as desert-glop.

Yummy! Instead of rum, I use Marsala. It's sweeter and still has the acidity of the rum. I also add coffee liqueur.

I needed a good bit more coffee and rum,  but a good recipe.  I thought it came out well.  Pretty close to restaurant quality.  Be careful with the custard,  mine curdled the first try.

I've never tried tiramisu but I wanted to make this for Mother's Day. The reviews were great so I went for it. I followed the recipe with a couple minor changes. Coffee liquor instead of rum, double coffee/liquor amounts per other reviews. Added 1/8 c sugar to whipped cream per other reviews. I made this in a trifle dish so in the future I'd use a bit more whipped cream. This recipe was awesome!! Everyone loved it!!! Will definitely make this again.

This was excellent.  I made this for Mother's Day and did not do a test run first as it received 5 stars from so many of you.  It did not disappoint.  Like several other reviewers I doubled the coffee and rum.  Next time the only thing I would do different is to not 1/2 the lady fingers.  I will leave them whole.  Don't be disappointed when you are assembling if you think the whipped cream isn't sweet enough.  After the flavors come alive in the fridge, you will see it is the perfect balance.  And the directions were perfect!   Thank you for this.  My Italian husband loved this and all my guests asked for me to put this on my annual menu.

I JUST made this for an office potluck for the very first time so I made a trial sized one on the side and boy, did I say "wow"! 

I made 3 changes: 1. I used 1 part light brown sugar and 2 parts white sugar 2. Instead of rum, I used 1/2 cup Kahlua & 1 cup Bustelo coffee 3. I used fresh ladyfingers. I'd use the "stale" one if I had more time to chill it. 

Many reviews mention that you need AT LEAST 24 hours. Well, my trial sized Tiramisu only needed 1. So, with that being said, I think using fresh ladyfingers makes all the difference! Now I'm not saying that it won't taste better tomorrow but right now it's pretty  good!!! A million times better than the $9 one at the Italian restaurant down the street...

Very good.  I had never made tiramisu before, but followed the instructions and it came out great!  I agree that it's best to double the coffee/ rum as the lady fingers really soak up a lot.  Didn't have a 7 x 11 pan but used a 9 x 13 and just used more lady fingers.  Served it at a dinner party and received many compliments.

Followed other suggestions and doubled rum and coffee. Don't be shy - dunk them, don't just drizzle. That's what gets it the proper tiramisu texture. Also, tiramisu is not supposed to be layered so I folded the whipped cream into the yolk/marscapone mix. This blended the sugar evenly throughout the cream. Made a phenomenal tiramisu with a nice rum kick!! Make sure to constantly stir whilst cooking the egg/sugar/milk mix - the sugar will caramelize and leave brown bits if you don't. That happened to me but didn't affect the flavor! Also agree to let it sit at least 24 hours - this has only tasted better as time has gone by.

Absolutely delicious! I made my own ladyfingers using a recipe here, and this was just fantastic. Everyone loved it!
Next time I may increase the coffee/rum by half, but that may be because my ladyfingers may have been thicker.

its one of the best recipes for tiramisu , i did it exactly as they said but the lady fingers were so mushy but the flavor was amazing , 
so the next time i replaced ladyfingers with 2 packs of vanilla wafers , crushed them to quarters before adding the coffee mix , it was amazing , my friends said that was the best tiramisu they ever had

Two thumbs up for flavor!!!! I have made this recipe as listed a few times now, and the only thing I can find wrong is that the creamy layer doesn't firm up, so it stays gooey which hinders the presentation factor. I'm still tweaking the recipe to find out the best way to firm it up a little without losing any of the flavor. Totally agree with other reviewers that you need to double the coffee mixture AND it MUST sit in refrigerator for at least 12-24 hours! DELICIOUS!

Really loved it! I was kind of scared when there didn't seem to be any sugar. I added a bit to the whip cream (maybe a 1/4 cup powdered sugar) it was amazing. I used the hard lady fingers and ended up having to douple up the coffee and Kahlua. Tonight I'm going to try it without the alcohol (for a friend in recovery). Wish me luck!

Delicious. I omitted the rum. Better to leave it overnight for best flavor/texture.  Easy to make. I ended up having to cut the recipe in 1/2 cause my significant other only bought 8oz of Mascarpone. Will make again for sure.

What a perfect recipe! I halved the recipe, but kept the coffee and rum measurements the same, per a review saying that they should be doubled. I also let it chill for about a day. The longer the better, it seems. My boyfriend and I loved this tiramisu and will definitely make it again.

My boyfriend is a tiramisu fan and LOVED this recipe. My came out a bit soupy...not sure if I over soaked the lady fingers (they absorb liquid in a snap) or it was addition to my less-than firm custard. Still, extremely delicious! I used a half a vanilla bean's paste in the whipped cream (it can be used in the custard as well) and as other reviewers wrote it is a must to use extra coffee (I used 1 cup of fresh espresso, no rum).

I found this recipe to be very "runny". Even after sitting in the fridge for a day most of the mascarpone mixture wound up falling off while trying to serve.

Next time I won't be including the milk or cream as they are pointless and just add too much moisture to the Tiramisu.

Delicious Tiramisu, it was not hard to make and was met with 8 rave reviews when I took it to a dinner party. Rich tasting and delicious.

For Tiramisu, this was a 5star...definitely equivalent or better than any we've tasted...though we're probably more aligned with cheesecake in this household.  Very nice recipe & easy!  thank you....

I substituted the lady fingers for salted carmel biscotti and folded in 1/4 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips into the mascarpone mixture.

Absolutely amazing!  I added just a bit more coffee & rum to soak up the lady fingers (not too much or they're soggy)... Seriously though- it's a perfect dessert.  I took it to a NYE party and the hosts actually asked if they could keep the leftover 2 pieces before I could even offer them.  Worth the time and effort, and people will be so impressed.  I will definitely be making this one again!

Is so good I made it three times in a row in one week. I substituted the vanilla extract with vanilla bean (1 bean for 12 servings) and doubled the coffee and rum (Kahlua) mix, based on the review. I picked the recipe for the cooked eggs and the overall 5 star review. The video was helpful, too. 

Tip from first failed experience of making the custard: MUST STIR CONTINUOUSLY until and after the yolks and milk mixture is boiled.  Turn the heat down if lacking of experience like me. I stopped stirring to check if it's boiling and the yolk mixture turned into egg drop soup. Made it again and everything turned out successfully and beautifully.

I love Tiramisu and have successfully made this recipe before but this time the whipping cream refused to whip. I  had no problem with another brand of heavy cream before but the store was out of it so I had to buy a new brand. And no matter how long I tried whipping it, it just refused to set. So, to rescue the cake, I made it anyway, using the runny cream and then froze the whole thing. It was good when it thawed out a bit except  I need to remember to  use less sugar next time. I prefer my Tiramisu less sweet.

Delicious flavor and very moist! Boyfriend always hated store bought tiramisu, but can't get over how delicious this one is! I also doubled the coffee and rum mixture, and almost think it needed a little more! Letting it sit was also a great idea. Can't wait to make this again!

amazing! Based on all the reviews, took a chance and made it as a dessert for Thanksgiving. It was a huge hit! Would definitely make again. Suggest using Italian lady fingers as they are a bit more sturdy than other lady fingers. Definitely make at least 1 day in advance.

I love this recipe.  Lots of great tastes knock you over, and the creamy texture is amazing.  One year I accidentally left out the milk--it still delighted.  Not many recipes can boast that.

The best tiramisu I ever eaten! Instead of rum, I used Baileys espresso. I didn't split the lady fingers, doubled the baileys/espresso for each layer (2 total layers). Amazing!!!

Sooo yummy, and much easier than I thought!  Based on others' reviews, I used 1/2 cup of brewed coffee and 3 tbsp white rum.  I think that was a good amount, although maybe could be a little less rum.  Next time I might try doubling the coffee only and leaving everything else as is.  Also, I was slightly overflowing in an 11 x 7 pan, so I think my 11.5 x 8 would be perfect.  My mother was absolutely thrilled with homemade tiramisu, and I'll definitely make this again!

unbelievable recipe. the sweetness is so balanced, everything is so delicate and restrained. I made it about 12 hours before eating and my dinner party cleaned my casserole dish. one guy, who normally hates Tiramisu,  went back for thirds! use a freezing bowl to whip your cream, and for a holiday twist, add a couple drops of cinnamon extract to your whipped cream and use a holiday coffee! perfection.

I figure I'm not a tiramisu lover. Followed recipe to the letter but when compared to my favourite deserts it's just ok. First time I made it and suspect that as far as tiramisu goes it's probably a pretty good recipe.

We LOVED this Tiramisu! I made it for Christmas dessert, then again on the 26th because it disappeared and we still wanted more. I followed the recipe, but doubled the vanilla, the coffee/rum mix, and based on other reviews, combined the mascarpone mix with the whipped cream before assembling everything. Also, I used soft lady fingers and instead of soaking, I arranged them in the pan, then spooned coffee/rum over the top...so they ended up soaked, but I didn't have to worry about them falling apart on the way to the pan. Thank you for sharing this recipe! I loved it!

This was pretty easy and turned out fantastic.  I served it after Christmas dinner and some people had thirds! My sister-in-law said it was the best she's ever had.  Will definitely make again.

After tasting tiramisu for the first time on our recent trip to Rome, my husband (who is not a dessert person) has not stopped raving about it.  I had to fight him over the last bite of the piece that we shared in Italy.  So when assigned by my sister to bring a dessert to our family Christmas dinner, I figured I would try this recipe.  I made very minor changes to the recipe as written.  I doubled the coffee and rum, as recommended by many reviewers.  I also chilled it for 48 hours (which was really a big blessing --- allowed me to make the dessert 2 days ahead of Christmas -- no last minute rushing).  And lastly I added 1 Tbsp of confectioner's sugar as I whipped the heavy cream and vanilla.  Result --- it was wonderful (my husband says ALMOST, ALMOST as good as the tiramisu in Rome).  One neighbor of my sister who happened to drop in, asked who made the tiramisu as he was headed to get his second piece.  He said he was not a dessert guy and seldom ate any but that this recipe was outstanding.  That seemed to be the general consensus of all the dinner guest who tried it.  I will be making this recipe often.  Thanks!

Easy & excellent.  My Italian mother-in-law loved it too! I'm gluten-free, so I used Schar g-f lady fingers, and it was a smashing success!! Just be sure to use the 7 x 11 pan, or increase the recipe portions so you can use a 9 x 13.

This tiramisu is great!  I made exactly as written, with the exception of doubling the coffee/rum mixture.  I still ran out when dipping my lady fingers and had to add a little extra to that.  I also refrigerated for a full 24 hours to give the flavors a chance to blend.  The only change I might make next time is to sprinkle some chocolate on the middle layer of whipped cream, in addition to the top layer.  It was so creamy and rich, I received compliments from everyone that had a piece!

I have made this over 5 x It's a huge hit with my family and extended family. I had never had this dessert before and my son wanted me to make this cake for his birthday. I found this recipe and will never look for another one because this is his absolute favorite recipe even better than the original cake he ate.  I highly recommend this I just don't use the alcohol in it.

Followed instructions exactly , EXCEPT FOR:
1. Didn't let custard sit 1 hour to cool. I set it in a ice bath, and stirred to cool. Much quicker, and didn't effect custard.
2. Ran out of coffee and rum, suggest 1/3 cup instead of 1/4.

I started making this when I was 15 and it turned out beautifully. I'm not an amazing baker or cook by any means so I thought it would flop but we had a tub of marscapone lying around and had to use it for something so I gave it a shot. I'm now required to bring this to all family gatherings. it's an awesome recipe!

I ommited the rum and tripled the coffee and the recipe tasted great. I tried dipping the ladyfingers (soft ones) quickly but it ended up being too soggy so I'll try brushing it on next time. Definitely recommend this recipe.

Really solid, delicious recipe. The recipe fits perfectly into an 8x8 pan, just in case you don't have the 7x11 suggested.

Made first time just as recipe said, it was good but little plain compared to others I've had. Then next time I made I beat the eggs whites like making meringue and added to the custard/mascarpone mixture and instead of milk used half & half its creamier and bout 1/3 extra sugar, it was great.

It was good, very rich, very heavy.  I had to leave it overnight for the rum and coffee flavor to properly infuse into the cake rather than the 5-6 hours they suggested.

One glass rectangular pan w/blue lid. Double coffee and rum. Hard lady fingers (1 lg package fine). Double strength instant coffee. 1T coffee poured over each finger. Kept cream and whipped cream layers separate. Didn't mix. Sprinkle with cocoa. Put SMALL, ghiridelli chocolate in top. Consider choc shavings.

This was so amazing! It's one if my favourites to eat, now I'm glad I can make it! I watched the video which was helpful.  I used Kahlua rather than a mix of coffee and rum and used more than 1/2 Cup, I added more as needed.  Also I didn't have vanilla so I used Grand Marnier in the vanilla! I will make it again!

I love this recipe, but I did make some changes, and it was wonderful.... I bought mascarpone cheese and it smelled bad, and it tasted worse... So I used Philadelphia cream cheese.. It was so good... ( to bad I paid 6.00 for the marscapone... Gurrrrr.....  Any way I made to pints of whipped cream glad I did.... And the egg mixture I put vanilla in that mixture... Delish... I made 3 cups strong coffee... And I put 1/2 cup of rum.... But then I decided to put another 1/4 cup... Yummmmmmy...  This is now my favorite recipe... Fun to make also.... Love to bake.... It did not taste like cheese cake at all it was perfect, and it was cheaper....  My new favorite desert......

I added shaved Dark chocolate to both the custard and the whip cream. I also substituted Kahlua for the normal rum and added a little espresso and kahlua to both the custard and the whip cream.  Worked great, its amazing!

Delicious. Used frangellico in place of rum because that's what I had. My coffee could have been stronger. Might go for the express next time. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing it

Awesome!  Amazingly simple for such a delish dish!  Will definitely be making this again.  I used the Ladyfinger recipe from this site instead of store-bought (I couldn't find any right now) and that was surprisingly easy too.  Thanks for the recipe!

The Best recipe EVER! ! Not a bite left!  Expensive to make but, so so worth it.  Will be making it again.   Followed recipe completely except, I added sugar to the whipping cream. Having doubts about making it, please do.  Totally worth it.

LOVED IT! Didn't add the rum and doubled the amount of coffee to soak the ladyfingers. When soaking the lady fingers i found it easier to coat a bowl and then press the ladyfingers in the bowl and repeat. This allowed it to soak throughout the whole ladyfinger instead of just a stream throughout the ladyfingers! It was a great hit and everybody loved it with no complaints :) Just finished eating the first try and I think I am going to make more tomorrow!

Nice, light, and coffee flavor infused. Perfect! I did make a few changes. I increased the coffee to 1/2 cup and instead of the rum, I added 4 tbsp. of Kahlua.

This recipe is delicious! It was a boatload of fun to make and 2 people in my family have already asked me to make it for there birthday! I also used a 8x8 pan for this and it worked just fine, just a little thicker. Also I just put it in the freezer for an hour and it worked if you are in a hurry! :)

Made this for a friends birthday as its her favorite dessert. DEFINITE KEEPER- I have ate tiramisu at all kinds of high end restaurants- this was some of the best I've ever had!! Scrolled through comments and only modified two things. Didn't spilt lady fingers (why do that anyway they are messier than hell!) and I made one cup strong coffee and splashed in 4-5 TBSP rum. Made it in two glass dishes (it's so pretty, you have to do glass!) so bday girl could take one home. I also made an extra batch of cream and added a little sugar to it. Just go for it you won't regret it. And agree, even better on day two!

I will make this again no-doubt! Absolutely loved it! I doubled the coffee and rum mixture to which I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of sugar just to make it even more calorifically potent!

I love tiramisu and this one is amazing! I made it to take to a dinner party and seriously considered keeping it all for myself and bringing something different. Like others suggested, I added extra coffee and rum to cookies. 10/10 would make again!

I made this many times. It is delicious. The only thing I would mention is that the whipped cream quantity and the coffee should be a bit increased. I also brush the cookies with a bit of Kahlua. I've gotten great compliments whenever I made it, including from well seasoned  cooks/chefs. :)

I made this a few months back for my cousin's birthday...first time making a tiramisu and it was a HIT!  Everyone loved it...and my cousin is a tiramisu fanatic.  I agree with everyone else that you have to double the coffee mixture...as I was just praying that I would have enough...and also agree that it should sit for minimum 24 hours before being eaten...thanks for the fantastic recipe! :)

I hosted a wine glass painting party last night and made this for my guests. AMAZING! And super easy. I didn't change a thing. By far the best tiramisu I've ever had. Thanks for sharing!

A great smooth fluffy texture, but enough coffee flavour for me. It's possible the lady fingers just weren't thick enough to actually soak up all of the coffee / rum.

Great recipe!  I couldn't find ladyfinger cookies so I used the soft kind (sponge cake-like).  It was more like a tiramisu mousse because the coffee soaked right through the ladyfingers, but the flavors were still there.  It was MMM MMM good!

This is a great tiramisu. I made some changes that turned it superb: prepare the half cup expresso coffee and complete the cup with equal parts of rhum, chocolate liquor and tía maria (this last is a must). Also you can add a couple tablespoons of rhum to the whipping cream. Try it and ley me KNOW!

This was relatively easy to make and a hit with everyone. 2nd and 3rd day taste even better. I agree with others to double the coffee/rum. May try the coffee liqueur next time. In one word, YUM!

Best tiramisu I have had! I think it would be perfect as is (of course, doubling the coffee mixture as everyone has said). Here are slight adjustments I made: 1) I only had 8 oz of mascarpone, so I used the mascarpone recipe on the site - perfect 2) instead of coffee, I used espresso using instant espresso. I prefer a stronger taste without risking bitterness 3) I used coffee liqueur instead of rum 4) I used 10 oz ladyfingers. The package comes in 7 oz containers so I got two 5) When making the custard, I made it like I would an ice cream base. This way I knew I wouldn't have any lumps. DEVINE! I read that you need to wait at least overnight - but I made a sample w/ the extra ingredients left over and it was SO good already.

Great recipe. My local grocery doesn't carry mascarpone or ladyfingers, so I used softened cream cheese mixed with sour cream and milk, and nilla wafers. I dunked each wafer into the coffee individually. I tried to sprinkle the cocoa on with a spoon; lots of lumps, I don't mind, but next time I might use my sifter or little strainer. But believe you me, there WILL be a next time!

This is the most amazing, rich, decadent recipe for tiramisu that I have come across to date.i always follow the directions exactly, until I get to the last step.  I put on enough cocoa powder to thinly coat the entirety of the top layer of whipped cream.  I don't measure out the tablespoon.  I sprinkle as evenly as I can, and then I pick up the whole pan and just jiggle it a little back and forth to get the layers to settle and the cocoa to spread evenly.

I first tried this recipe several years ago (about 5 actually now that I think about it; wow) and I'm still using it today! My own variation is actually folding the whipped mascarpone into the whipped cream, and then gently folding the custard in with that, creating one creamy texture as opposed to two. The resulting mascaropne custard mix is delicious, I always make extra when I'm making a tiramisu now, just so that I can make crêpes with that cream and fruits later on in the week! 

As for the rum, I'm not a big fan (too many bad drinking experiences with it), but I've tried it with no liquor, coffee liqueur, Bailey's, and Amarula and all have been fantastic!

The Tiramisu turned out amazing! The only thing I would change is to maybe add more coffee to the recipe. I read the other reviews and made sure to make it the night before. This recipe is definitely one I will hold on to.

I love tiramisu and my daughter had requested it for her 16th bday.  This recipe was very easy.  I did double the coffee in the recipe, and used pure vanilla rather than rum (as it was for a 16 year old's birthday and one person attending is in recovery.)  I did purchase a hair dye bottle and used that to drizzle the coffee mixture on the lady fingers.  It made it quick and easy with no mess.  I did make it 24 hours in advance.  I personally found it more sweet, rather than flavorful.  I think if I make it again I will use espresso to give the flavor more of a kick and maybe add some cocoa to the cream mixture.  A cake shop around the corner from my work makes the best tiramisu.  (but come to think of it, it is made with a chocolate base.  I think that is what I felt was missing from the Tiramisu....the chocolaty indulgence that I crave) :)

First tiramisu I've ever made and first custard I've ever made as well ( do not stop whisking!). Everything came out great! As others have said, double the coffee/rum component.  And don't dunk both sides of the lady fingers. One side or drizzle with a spoon because the cookies are like sponges and you still want to maintain somewhat a crunchy texture.  As a topping I sifted some left over hot chocolate mix I had laying around, crumbled some left over lady fingers and drizzled some warmed (in a microwave safe bowl) Nutella. What else is as italian as Nutella? Next time I will drizzle some onto each cookie layer but not too much. The coffee/rum is subtle and Nutella is rich, so just enough to maintain that balance. I hope people enjoy making this as much as I did! O and I'd let it sit in the fridge at least one day.

This was delicious! I doubled the coffee and rum mixture, as suggested, which was a must. I used cafe bustelo expresso and let it sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Will definitely make this again.

I absolutely love this recipe! This was the first time I had made tiramisu and im so glad I did. I took it to my in-laws and it was a hit. A couple things I substituted was agave nectar for sugar. I use the madhava brand organic. Also, I used kahlua instead of mixing coffee and rum. I read some reviews and did what they suggested which was keep sugar same amount and leave it in the fridge a coupke days prior to eating. I made it on a thursday night and we ate it on Saturday afternoon. I had a hard time finding lady fingers. I finally found some in a frozen section by the bakery. They were soft. I know some one also suggested softer lady fingers. I hope this helps anyone else searching for a great tiramisu recipe.

What an amazing recipe! Super easy to make and it was absolutely delicious! Like many others recommended, we doubled our coffee and we even added some Starbucks coffee liquor to the mixture. We recommend not drizzling the lady fingers with the coffee/rum mixture, but rather quickly let them soak in the mixture BRIEFLY. Because of this, we  ended up having to mix another half-batch of the coffee/rum mixture. The only thing we will change for future batches is having 3 layers of the lady fingers. Other than that, definitely wait the 24 hours to eat! We will definitely be making again!!!

This was seriously amazing.  Definitely wait two days, double coffee/rum.  I got my lady fingers in the baking section of Hannafords, and they were soft, like another recommendation suggested.  However, they were really small, and I found that the cream overwhelmed them.  Still soo good, but make sure you get full sized lady fingers.

Tried this recipe and it was great. Learned a thing or two by trial and error.  Doubled the coffee and rum because i ran out on the first layer.  The Mascarpone whipcream mix needs to be refrigerated slightly before spreading otherwise it will run, lastly, this is not a last minute recipe, wait the six hours and allow it to set. One previous reviewer said it best, prepare a few days ahead and this will be twice as good.  Very close to some of the best Tiramisu I've eaten. This will go into the family recipe book for sure.

I have made this before and I find it hard not to eat the whole thing myself!  Right now as we speak I have had two lady fingers with a little of the filling!  YUMMY! I have just finished making it this morning and it is in the fridge for a tomorrow night dinner party.  I don't change any of the ingredients with the exception that I did quadruple the coffee amount. I make my own ladyfingers from this site simply called Ladyfingers.  The are a soft lady finger.  This time I did something a little different, I used a spring form pan.  I made one batch of ladyfinger and baked three thin layers in cake pans.  I then made another batch of piped ladyfingers to place up on end around the edge of the spring form. The reason I did this is because to get a nice solid layer of ladyfingers in a round pan is pretty difficult.  The rounds were not quite large enough to reach the edges and that is where the individual lady fingers come in handy.  I also combine the whipped cream mix with the mascarpone cheese/egg mixture and did it as on layer, that worked fantastic.  I also used Medaglia D'Oro instant espresso coffee.  I used 50ml of Appleton Estate Jamaican rum. I am hoping that it all turns out in the end.  Fingers crossed! This is an amazing recipe and I will always use this and no other!  Time consuming but every bit worth it!!!!!

I am in Italy with a group of students. I wanted to surprise them and made this tiramisu. Rave reviews from them all. One student, who does not like coffee-based dessert, had two servings. It was a hit. AND easy to make.

Really good and fairly easy to assemble. I used the hard version of the ladyfingers rather than the soft, and made more than the suggested coffee and used liberally.

I made this using the marscapone substitute on allrecipes.com and also substituting angel food cake for the lady fingers.  This makes the recipe much more economical.  It is also hard to find these ingredients in my area.  Tiramisu is my husband and my favorite dessert.  We thought this was delicious as did our young children!

Doubled the coffee/rum mixture as others suggested.  I did get the stated sized boxed of lady fingers but they seemed very small.  Although they were the hard kind they seemed to soak up the mixture quickly and I was afraid they would be too soggy- they actually turned out fine but I can't imagine using the soft kind of lady fingers and having it work out.  I used a 9X13 as that was all I had available at that time.  This was a mistake- it was too thin and there wasnt enough lady fingers to make a second layer.  I will definitely make this again- in a smaller dish!!  The flavor was great. I did let it chill for about 36 hours..... was better the longer it chilled. I waited until the last minute to sprinkle the cocoa on with a sifter- perfect!  Edit 3/21/15- I couldn't find lady fingers so used biscotti as others suggested.  Also used the full double batch of the coffee/rum mixture.  The biscotti were not good at all and the rum flavor was too strong.  This needs to sit for 48 hours for best flavor.  Next time I will only make it with lady fingers, double the coffee but the stated amount of Rum.

This is the BEST!  The only thing I did differently was to use Kahlua instead of rum, and I did not split the ladyfingers but briefly dunked or rolled them in the coffee mixture and laid them in the dish whole.  I loved my old tiramisu recipe but this one is the one I will go with from now on!

I thought this recipe and the insightful reviews made this a winner!  I did up the rum and the coffee  as suggested.  My trick for drizzling the lady fingers with coffee/rum...a clean, unused hair color bottle! I simply squeezed a perfect amount of  mixture onto the individual lady fingers, just right! Try it !  Happy 2015 !

The flavor was great after sitting for 24 hours. I used soft ladyfingers and cut them in half this time like the recipe says. However, next time I will leave them whole for a thicker layer of the ladyfingers. I also mixed the custard and whipped cream together and tripled the rum/coffee mixture.

Yum! I cook the custard mixture in the microwave:30-60 second increments on high until thickened, stirring after each time.(less likely to scorch that way.If you over-cook and have curds, use "stick" blender, they smooth right out!)Found cocoa-flavored mascarpone at Trader Joe's - folded 8 oz. tub into the whipped cream, used 8 oz. regular mascarpone in the custard mixture. Used 50/50 strong coffee mixture and Frangelico for dipping the lady fingers. This tiramisu is awesome; it really does continue to improve the longer it rests - the hardest part is hiding it until serving time! First made this for Thanksgiving and it was immediately requested for Christmas - I have a feeling this is a new family "tradition" for the holidays. Thanks for the great recipe, Christine!

My boyfriend loves tiramisu, so I made this for him to celebrate a special occasion. I made some adjustments, I made 5x the amount of the coffee alcohol mix and I reduced the amount of alcohol it was a bit too much for my taste. I dipped a few of the lady fingers in the mixture to taste to get the amount of coffee and rum just right. But everything else I kept the same. A previous review mentioned that after 48 hours the flavors develop..... This is so true. By day 2 it was phenomenal!! My boyfriend loved it, he said that this is the best one he has ever had.

Fantastic. Like many others I could not find ladyfingers anywhere.  What I did find was Madeleines , which I hoped would be a good substitute.  They were !  I also did take a  short cut and used store bought whipped cream, to which I added real vanilla extract.  Let the whole thing sit 24 hours.  Wow, lots of compliments.

Great recipe! I used coffee instead of espresso and brandy instead of rum. It tasted amazing. I soaked the lady fingers with more coffee and brandy than what was called for- otherwise it seemed too dry.

Everyone loved it and said it was better than the ones they've tried! I used the exact amount of sugar indicated, but next time, I will use a little bit less since it was a little on the too sweet side for me. I also used really soft lady fingers since those were the only ones sold at the store, so I had to bake it in the oven at 350 degrees for maybe 15-20 minutes to harden a little. A lot of reviewers say that it tastes better the longer it stays in the fridge. I made mines the day before in the late afternoon and had them for lunch the following day and they were still good. I also used twice the amount of coffee and liquor (Kahlua) as suggested.  I will definitely make it again!

This tiramisu is spectacular! I let it stand in the refrigerator sealed for two days to meld all the flavors. My family is does not like coffee or expresso so we substituted gourmet hot chocolate (doubled the chocolate measure to make it stronger) for the coffee. The flavors of this recipe are all very light and airy. The rum is just distinguishable which is perfect. Texture and taste are fabulous! Highly recommend this to anyone.

I was scared to make this, but had to as my daughter told me at the 11th hour she needed to bring this dish to school for class. ARGH! It turned out beautifully and was sorry she came home with the pan empty. She said many really liked it. So I will make this again for the family to enjoy.

Only made tiramisu once and it came out good but nothing different well I used this as the base and added my own flare made it with double or triple the amount of coffee called. I used Stella D'oro margharite cookies instead of ladyfingers I couldn't find them and the cookies were on sale. Also for the top layer of whipped cream I mixed the remaining coffee to add to the flavor (can never have enough coffee in my opinion) and made it a day before to let it set.

This was delicious. I followed what other reviewers said, and doubled the coffee/rum mixture and let this sit in the fridge for 24 hours. But, I halved the recipe and made it in a 9x5 loaf pan, which was the perfect width for the ladyfingers. The whipped cream wasn't enough so I made extra. Yummy.

Made a half batch & omitted the milk! Amazing - was searching for a new recipe that didn't use raw egg whites... This was just as good as my recipe I normally use, but you can eat more without getting a tummy ache! ** bonus** 8)

Everything is amazing in this recipe except my measurements must've been way off. I couldn't find lady fingers so I used Stella Doro cookies...which I ultimately ran out of. If you use these, buy 2 pkgs. I used spiced rum because that's what I had, and I used up the entire 16oz container of heavy cream because I knew I would never use the rest (also doubled the vanilla to compensate and ended up using most of the whipped cream). I started with a 9x12  dish but had to switch to a 9x9 because of the lack of cookies. I used all of the custard so I don't know how thin the layers would've been otherwise. The whipped cream seemed bland so I added 2 packets of Splenda and it tastes amazing. Not too sweet. I also used Splenda baking blend and skim milk in the custard. I made this last night and I'm eating it out of the dish with a spoon right now. Great recipe!

I LOVE Tiramisu!!  So I was looking at all the tiramisu recipes and reading a lot of comments and came upon this one.  I agree with other reviewers about doubling the coffee and rum.  I didn't test this recipe like I normally do, I made it and brought it to a party.  It got really  good reviews.  I told everybody to let me know their opinion as this is a new recipe for me.   Everybody loved it.  Not one bad comment.  This group will let me know if they didn't like it.  I agree that it needs to be in the fridge for 24 hrs.  I made two for the party; one the night before and one the day of.  The one the day of was a little runny and the flavor wasn't as good.  The flavors really come together when it sits.  I used hard lady fingers and soft ones.  I dipped the hard ones and spooned the coffee rum mixture on to the soft ones.  They both turned out the same.  I can't always find hard lady fingers in my area, the stores tells me it's a seasonal item.   This is my go to Tiramisu!!!!  WOW!!!  If you love tiramisu.  You'll (and everyone else) will love it!!!!!

This recipe is so authentic it brought back memories of a romantic dinner in Rome with Ermanno. Mmmmmmm! Seriously, this is a GREAT recipe! Used Starbucks French Roast coffee. Great coffee is a MUST. Doubled the coffee/rum mix and STILL wasn't sure I had enough. However, later discovered those Lady Fingers sop up liquid like little sponges. Just drizzle the mix over the bottom layer. No one wants a soggy bottom! ;) Grazi, Christine! Loved this recipe. I'll make it again.

Omg.  Absolutely fabulous.  I made my own lady fingers for this using the recipe here on AR dot com.  Can't believe my mother and I put away this whole thing in a couple days.  ;_;  As the other commenters noted, let it sit for two days before eating it.  When you do, it's like heaven in a bowl.

Made this after visiting the North End in Boston and getting tiramisu. When we got home, we all craved more tiramisu so we decided to make our own. We were worried, since it seemed like an intricate recipe, but it was extremely easy and delicious! Based on what the reviews said, we doubled the coffee/rum mixture and we're very pleased, we could tell that it would have been too dry without it. We let it sit for about 15 hours which was a very good idea and we'll worth the wait! Overall, a great recipe and can't wait to make it again!

Great and very easy to make. My husband love it so I had to make another with the slight change of height. I made it  in 4 layers instead of 2. Looked better and taste richer.

Wonderful recipe. Be sure to let it sit and I sometimes find that if you double the coffee and add about 1/4 cup of sugar to the whip cream people love it even more. Overall it is very good, but some minor tweaks make it even better.

I would make a little more whip cream next time and go really easy on the cocoa sprinkled on top. Other than that it was A-MAZ-ING!!! So delicious! Loved it!

This tasted nice but not the best Tiramisu I've tried and some directions in the recipe are kind of misleading. You definitely need to let it refrigerate a lot more than 6 hours. I had a slice 10 hours after I put it in the fridge and it was "Eh," 14 hours, "Nice." 24/more than 24 hours; "Good." I didn't split lady fingers in half, very unnecessary and in fact would make the slices too thin for my like. As others mentioned here, you'll need more coffee and be careful with rum. The first time I used rum extract instead of actual rum, and less than 5ml were too much for a serving size of 8.

Amazing!! This was my first time making it and it came out just the way I liked it! I didn't use the rum and it still came out great! I also couldn't find the lady fingers so I ended up making that from scratch! But all in all, delicious!

this was amazing especially 2 days later. I mixed the custard/mascarpone filling with the whipped cream before spreading it on the ladyfingers. I will use espresso next time instead of regular coffee.

This recipe is really good. I did make it with coconut sugar instead of cane sugar. This modification made the recipe amazing.

This is so easy to make you can increase or decrease the amount without any problem.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  I am not a big fan of tiramisu, but I've already made this twice in less than 2 months and everyone loves it.  I will be making it again. There's also a video that matches this recipe that's very helpful.

I've made this twice now, and the first time was a flop for one simple reason: I took the recommendation of a blogger and cooked my sugar/yolk mixture over a double boiler. I cooked it for quite awhile and it still never thickened enough. The filling was runny and while it tasted great, it was more like Tiramisoup. The second time I followed the recipe's instruction and used a regular saucepan. Huge difference. A few small changes I made both times: mascarpone is hard to find in my area and ridiculously expensive, so I make my own. It is identical to storebought, and so simple & cheap to make. I also incorporated the whipped cream into the cheese mixture to make one filling, as well as added a small amount of sugar to the cream before I whipped it. It is incredibly delicious, and everything you want in a tiramisu.

Made this for Christmas dinner this year.  It was a huge hit!  Now my family is requesting it for every occasion.  The tip about not soaking the ladyfingers, but instead drizzling it on is a good one.

I LOVE this recipe! I made it for my coworker baby shower and every one at the office love it. I made this as an individual cup desserts, I used the 6 oz cup that bought from a restaurant supply store. *I used icing bag to fill the cream and break the lady fingers into three small pieces to fit in the cup

This is the first time I tried making tiramisu. I read a lot of the reviews and the only thing I did different was I mixed the whipped cream and the egg mixture together to create one layer only.  It came out perfect tasting.  It didn't look too pretty because I didn't have the right dish size to use but it tasted awesome.  I used Callebaut cocoa powder in all of my desserts and I think it will make everything taste so decadent.  I used Myer's Jamaican rum with Starbucks coffee and the mixture blended beautifully together. My husband loves it and thinks it's the best tiramisu he's ever had and he has a big sweet tooth! Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

OMG OMG OMG! This is to dieee for!I chose this recipe because the eggs are cooked and boy am i glad i did! I did not change anything about this recipe..not sure why everyone has to change recipes. Nothing about this recipe needs to be changed it was excellent.  I will without a doubt be making it again.  I watched the video and it def helped with the directions.  I used 1/4 cup of rum and a half cup of coffee which is suggested in the video and i doubled it and i had more than enough.  Cannot wait to make this again!

I tried making tiramisu with a no-cook recipe--it was better than what I've had in restaurants, but still slightly bland. Last night, I gave this recipe a try and it was AMAZING!!!  Because I like mine with more of a kick in flavor, I did make some adjustments. I added a tablespoon of sugar to the whipped cream, I used espresso instead of regular coffee, and I tripled the amount of coffee and rum, letting each lady finger soak for 3 seconds in a shallow dish. I will definitely make this again and again!

WOW! I never made Tiramisu before! I saw this recipe and thought "that seems pretty easy"...so I tried it. I did it as the video showed. Although, since I had never worked with ladyfingers, they got just a tad too soggy when I dipped them...I didn't realize how quickly they soaked up the liquid! Ya live ya learn! This was super easy and super delish!!!! Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this for the umpteenth time today, I agree with those who say increase the coffee/liquor, otherwise it is wonderful as is. For those who expect this recipe to tell them what to do with the egg whites, understand that this recipe does not call for egg whites.  You are free to add them, it is your dessert and you are free to change the recipe. But this one and I wager most classic tiramisus do not have e.g. whites.  You could use them in another dish.

Awesome recipe! I doubled the coffee and rum the first time, but felt it wasn't enough.  When I made it the second time, I made sure the lady fingers were about half way saturated.  Turned out much better.  This recipe is delicious and seems foolproof. Yum!!

Looked at several other reviews and yes, 
1) Double up on the coffee/rum (I actually tripled)
2) Make this at LEAST a day in advance, two is better, at day three - even the cream had a nice coffee taste. 
3) Soak the lady fingers for a couple of seconds, and I think folding the whipped cream with the chilled mascarpone/custard at the end not only saves time but the texture and taste are pretty extraordinary than the regular way. 
All in all, this is by far the best Tiramisu recipe, hands down. Made this for my husbands birthday and the guests thought I bought it from the 5 star Italian restaurant. One of the guests told me flat out he hates cake, got him to try a bite and ended up eating a big piece. So worth it, definitely 5 stars.

I chose this recipe because it was the first one that I saw, but it turned out really well! I did, however, leave out the rum. I also made a substitute for the mascarpone cheese because it is not available in my area (cream cheese, sour cream, heavy whipping cream). The creamy cheese filling was definitely the best part! I would make this again, using my slightly modified recipe. It is easier than it looks! And it got rave reviews from my family. Oh, also, I did not have to split the ladyfingers that I bought -- not sure what brands you can find, but sometimes they are called Savoiardi Biscuits. They were the perfect size to fit two rows in a 9 x 13" pan.

Great tiramisu!!! Everyone loved it. I did end up using sliced pound cake instead of lady fingers because I couldn't find any at the store. And I used creme de cocoa instead of rum. I dipped the sliced pound cake so It wouldn't come out too soggy! And just like the previous reviews , I doubled the coffee and creme de cocoa. Overall it was so tasty!! I'm definitely making this again.

This was a very good recipe! The only thing I would change is next time I'll be adding some powdered sugar to the whipped cream for some sweetness. Other than that, it was great! And fairly easy to make too. I will deff be making it again.

absolutely brilliant :) planning on making one of these for my wedding reception, but also doing a trial run based on this recipe for a strawberry, non alcoholic version (home made strawberry syrup instead of the coffee-rum)because we have several friends and relatives who don't like coffee or any alcohol, and this is just too delicious to let them go without something similar on the day :)

I decided to try making this for my mom`s birthday and so glad I did! After reading reviews I doubled the rum (not the coffee) and the result was outstanding. My mom (who is picky and used to good stuff) said it was the best dessert I`ve ever made. Not bad! : )

I've made this twice. The first time, I used Trader Joe's lady fingers and it was excellent. The second time, I couldn't get the Trader Joe's kind so I used a different brand of lady fingers, which were much crispier and it wasn't as moist as the first time. I suggest doubling or even tripling the amount of coffee/rum mixture to really get the lady fingers soaked. I found it easier to put the first layer of lady fingers in the dish, then pour the coffee mixture over them, then do the marscapone and cream, then the next layer of lady fingers and again, pour the coffee over them. It kind of drenches the cream layers in the middle, which isn't a bad thing. It still looks pretty, but is much creamier. Also, definitely let it sit in the fridge overnight - it's much better after a day.

My family gave this rave reviews. Easy to make, and absolutely delicious!! I can't understand why some people had problems with it. I let mine chill for 24 hours before serving and the flavors were wonderful. I will make this again!!

Awesome recipe. First time making Tiramisu and was a success. However personally I think the Mascarpone mixture is a little too sweet, reducing some sugar should be fine.

Very easy to make, very tasty too!  Didn't know it was so easy to make, might try use pound cake instead of lady fingers next time.

It's not hard to make, just a little time consuming, but totally worth it. Tiramisu has always been my favorite dessert and we took a stab at making it for the first time the other day. If you've ever had the tiramisu at Astoria in Greektown or Royal Oak, this tastes very similar. Ingredients were about $12. It's very rich, very delicious. Tiramisu perfection.

Wonderful recipe. A few adjustments I made... I doubled the amount of rum and coffee mixture, except I used coffee liquor and espresso instead. If you prefer a more "coffee" flavor I suggest using an espresso. Also after the sabayon was made (egg yolk/sugar/milk) I threw it into a blender to get it really smooth. Otherwise your mascarpone creme will be a little lumpy due to the cooked egg. If you blend it before adding the mascarpone then the creme will be perfectly smooth, much like the texture of eclair or creme puff filling. :)

LOOOVE IT ! 
I am so glad that I choose this recipe ! 
I made some changes like : marsala vine instead of rum, doubled the coffe amount and I didin't use milk for egg yolk mixture. 
I found that most zabaione recipe ( the egg yolk mixture) don't need milk , and after all it came out delicious ! 
Everyone in house enjoyed it and said that it is even better than in some restaurants :) 
So I highly reccomen this recipe, YUM YUM YUM !

Wonderful!   We only had amaretto, and used it instead of rum.  We made 12 oz. cup of double strength instant coffee + 5 Tbsp amaretto for dipping the ladyfingers.

The only problem I'm having with this is that now that I've made it for my family, they ask for it all the time. It is the "real deal" tiramisu. Yummy, yummy, yummy! I have made this a few times and I am always impressed with how well it turns out and how professional it looks. I will say I tried it one time using BelGioioso mascarpone made specifically for tiramisu that had coffee flavoring added to it and I did not care for it.

I've made this for several years now. It's my "go to" Tiramisu recipe. Everyone I've served this to asks for the recipe! I've often added rum for that extra kick. For a single recipe, I use a deep 9x9" square casserole dish.

I made this for my husband's birthday and he LOVED it! I also doubled the coffee and liquor as others suggested. I used Starbucks dark roast with Kalua and let it sit covered in the fridge for two days. It was amazing!

I couldn't stop eating it myself!  I cut the recipe in half because it was for two people.  It still came  out great!  I didn't realize it was so easy to make.  The video helped me follow along.  I followed everyone's comment about doubling the coffee and actually replaced the rum with another 1/2 cup of coffee.  It came out amazing.  I think it got better and better night after night.  I highly recommend this recipe and i'm looking for excuses to make it again!

I made this for a dinner party when I couldn't find the recipe I've always used.  Amazing! The custard-marscarpone mixture was creamy, delicious, rich and absolutely perfect.  This is easily the best Tiramisu recipe I have ever used (I've tried ~6, and used to remake one that I liked at the time).

Rich and delicious.  After reading the reviews, I planned ahead and made it in the morning on the day BEFORE the day of the family dinner I was planning on bringing it to. My (Italian) family all loved it, as did I.  Like many others, I also doubled the coffee/rum mixture and it was just barely enough.

WONDERFUL. Bought some hard lady fingers as an impulse buy and found this recipe.  Put the coffee rum mixture in rectangular pan where I could tilt all the fluid into the corner and gave each lady finger a quick and easy roll. Doubled the coffee and rum as suggested and still ended up needing a little more. Most of my lady fingers came out soaked half way thru and completely soft and wonderful. A few got a little too soft. Next time I'll use a little more rum. So good your eyes will roll up into your head.

This was absolutely delicious!  I looked at over a dozen recipes for tiramisu, and settled on this one.  It can be a bit time-consuming, but the outcome is definitely worth it.  I have made it 4 or 5 times now, and everyone has loved it.  It's much better after it sits overnight in the fridge.  If you're thinking about making this, do it!  You will love it!

This recipe is "dead on"!!!!  Tastes exactly like what I've gotten at many Italian restaurants (maybe even better).  It is not difficult to make--just a little pricy for the ingredients, mainly the mascarpone cheese.  The only thing I might change would be to try thin slices of pound cake instead of ladyfingers. For one thing, ladyfingers are hard to find.  Secondly, you have to be very careful when putting the expresso mixture on them or they fall apart.  Pound cake is denser and might work out better.....we'll see!

This is the 2nd year that I made it for both sides'  family Christmas party.  The 1st year, my husband's brother said "This shall be my b-day cake from now on". This year, my sister's husband said "No one can eat dessert any more, I can take the whole thing home to enjoy!".  By the way, my husband who hates coffee & alcohol secretly finished off the extra cup at home!  Tried making it, you will not regret!

This is really very nice! Thanks for sharing the recipe. You can consider putting cling wrap over the container with additional length so that it's easy to take out. Or you can find a container with a wide enough base so that you can lay the tiramisu by individual portions.

I think it would be nice if the video could show the end result of the yolk mixture before putting it into the refrigerator. I made it three times as the first two times became "curdy" which I suspect was due to "over cooking" the mixture.

I have made this recipe twice now, and both times I have had rave reviews! I made it for my soon to be in-laws and everyone loved it!  I didn't reduce the sugar, but used dark chocolate instead, I also added GFIC Cafe Vienna to the heavy cream mixture. Be sure to make this desert 1-2 days in advance! Double the coffee and rum. I made chocolate hearts with white and dark chocolate for the decoration and made it in a 9" round pan.

As Macklemore would say.  This is Freaking Awesome.  So easy to make and amazing.  As other reviews said it gets better day by day.  I like mine really "coffeey" so next time I'd use a super super strong coffee and some more rum.  It's really the perfect tiramisu.  You will amaze people w/ this one.

This recipe was amazing! As was recommended by other reviewers, I doubled the coffee + rum combination (used Myer's dark rum, since I've read elsewhere that this is good for tiramisu). I actually served the tiramisu in mason jars instead of making a full tray of it. can't wait to share with guests tonight!

My picky son & 3 teenage boys loved this. I used this recipe & another directions, using a 9 x5 x3 loaf pan, lined with plastic wrap to remove, 3 layers with chocolate gratings between and heavily on top after removing from pan.

Absolutley fantastic!!  I made an 8in round sponge cake instead of using the ladyfingers and used Kahlua instead of the rum.  Only need 1/2 the rec for the filling if making the 8 in round and use 2 cups of whipping cream if you want to decorate the cake.  Other than that...this is a KEEPER!!

My Dad called this phenomenal!  It was super-yummy and more like old-school Tiramisu to me.  We had some at a restaurant (Delmonico's Steakhouse) about a week later and this recipe was definitely better!  I doubled the coffee and rum as suggested by others and would recommend that.

I made it twice - the first time as the recipe calls for which was good. The second time was phenomenal. I made 1.5 times as much custard and whipping cream filling. I quadrupled the coffee mixture and only dunked the bottom half of the lady fingers in then drizzled the top half. I made it three days before eating and it was perfect.

This was my first time making Tiramisu and I was impressed. The directions were easy to follow and spot-on. I was originally a little worried after I had made the egg yolk/sugar/milk mixture because it was a bit grainy and didn't have the smooth texture I was expecting. If this happens to you DO NOT be alarmed. It turned out awesome.
The ONLY thing I'm going to change next time I make it is I am going to do a 1 tablespoon rum to 1/4 cup of coffee, as I now have a low tolerance to alcohol taste... ha. But it tastes just like the stuff you buy at the fancy italian restaurants!

Wonderful cake! Easy to make, did once, but going to master till it's perfect to be a "family's special".It's not too sweet, it's sweet enough to be a dessert!  It's not very solid if we are talking about the texture. Next time I'm going to reduce amount of milk or drizzle ladyfingers very ,very lightly. Needs to be refrigerated minimum 3 days in my opinion. Overall, perfect taste, perfect moist , worth making!

Outstanding recipe.  I used the soft ladyfingers and was concerned they would get soggy so I double the coffee/rum mix, applied with a brush and just about had all of it left.  Ended up using an ultra thin offset spatula around the edge of my glass bowl to dribble in more coffee/rum mix onto the ladyfingers at the bottom of the bowl.  Don't be afraid to use the coffee/rum mix.  Waiting 2 days to serve blended the flavors. Dessert turned out delicious and it was a big hit.

OMG delicious!! For those people who had a hard time splitting the ladyfingers in half lengthwise, it was probably because you've purchased the 'hard' ladyfingers, as I did. I didn't know there were two kinds. So, I didn't cut them, and just used the whole thing like that, and it turned out perfect. Also, I didn't drizzle the coffee/rum mixture on them but dipped them really quick in it. For the NEXT time I make it, I might combine the custard/mascarpone mixture with the heavy cream to make one lighter custard filling. I felt like the mascarpone layer could have been lighter.

Very good, and not that hard to make.  Definitely double the alcohol and coffee.  I tried 1c of coffee and that was more than I needed- so try 1/2 c of coffee and 4T rum or kahlua or whatever is handy- it's all good!

Delicious! This turned out way better than I expected. Changed up a couple of things: used Disaronno Liquor instead of rum and used dark chocolate cocoa powder on one of the layers. This dessert was a hit with the family and it turns out that it's even better the next day :)

I've been using this recipe for a few years and am finally getting to review it: I love this tiramisu!! Made a slop a few times (didn't let the yolks thicken, didn't whip the cream all the way), but once you get the hang of things this is the best homemade tiramisu I've had!

Fantastic recipe! Super easy to follow and make. I cut the lady fingers in half as suggested by recipe and it didn't provide enough sponge for my family's preference. Next time I will make without splitting the lady fingers. This will now be the family's favorite dessert!

This recipe was perfect!!! I substituted mascarpone with 400g of cream cheese, 3 tbsp of sour cream, 1 tbsp butter, and 1/3 cup of heavy cream. I also whipped the egg whites and folded them into the cheese mixture at the very end (as someone has suggested) because I didn't want to waste them. I folded the heavy cream mixture with the egg yolk mixture instead of having two layers. I was going to let it sit for 48 hours, but I couldn't resist and tried it after 24 hours and it was amazing. Everyone loved it.

This recipe is very easy to make & the only change I made was to drizzle the coffee/rum over the lady fingers ve. Soaking as they fell apart when I tried to soak them. It is VERY rich as others mentioned but it was a huge hit when I served at the last dinner party. Def will make again!!!

I loved it! I wanted to make it again but forgot to buy mascarpone...so I used all cream cheese, added a little sour cream. Not too bad. Not as good as mascarpone but not bad. I think 1/2 cream cheese 1/2 mascarpone is perfect.

Made this last night and it turned out beautifully. The only changes I made were that I added 1/4 cup sugar to the whipped cream so that it was lightly sweetened, used kahlua instead of rum and I actually quadrupled the coffee/kahlua mixture (I used the hard ladyfingersinstead of the soft, so they soak more up).  Tried it this morning and it's delicious!  All of my coworkers loved it.

I messed up my tiramisu, I mixed the mascarpone with the whipped cream by mistake, after I realized it I mixed some of that mixture with the yolk custard. Not real tiramisu because of MY error but still fabulous non the less. I imagine it will be spectacular when I make it the right way.

I changed this a bit, didn't have enough lady fingers, so used pound cake instead and didn't have enough mascarpone cheese, only 8 ounces, so also used an 8 ounce package of cream cheese.  Even with the changes, this was FANTASTIC - made it the day before and refrigerated over night.  It was rich, great coffee flavor and tasted very much like the restaurant version.  I would definitely make this again.  This makes a large pan of cake, enough to share with everyone.

I love this recipe.  I've made it three times now, and get rave reviews from everyone who tastes it!  I double the coffee/rum mixture, as per other reviews, but other than that, it is perfect!!

This was delicious! I used amaretto instead of rum. After I cooked the egg - sugar - milk mix I thought I messed up because it wasnt creamy enough so next time instead of a whisk I will use an electric mixer during this step- however after it cooled it set up perfect- This recipe definitely needs to set a few days to make it better- instead of 5 hours I would say its tasted the best today which is 3 days after I made it. Also something else I am going to do next time is add a pkg of cream cheese with the mascarpone cheese and also im going to add a few teaspoons of cocoa to my coffee - amaretto mixture. Also I had to double the cream mixture to make enough to cover 2 layers. This is actually a very easy and yummy dish!

This was the first time I tried making tiramisu and to be honest, it wasn't as great as I expected from all the rave reviews. It had too much whipped cream which overpowered the mascarpone.  Also I just barely drizzled the lady fingers with strong coffee and that wasn't enough.  Next time I will cut the whipped cream in half and soak the lady fingers a little more. I also will not split them in half, and fold the whipped cream into the marscapone mixture to make it thicker. It has a good rich taste though, perfect with coffee!

The taste is absolutely great! However, I rated 4 stars because the recipe does not work perfectly for me.
1. "1 1/4 cups heavy cream" is not enough. I used a 7x11 inch dish, at the end I can only make 1.5 NOT 2 layers of whipped cream. Fortunately I have a bottle of ready-to-use whipped cream as backup to finish up the rest.
2. coffee and rum are not enough. In the recipe it was written "1/4 cup strong brewed coffee, 2 tablespoons rum" and in the video "1/2 cup strong brewed coffee, 1/4 cup rum". Both are not enough. Maybe the ladyfinger cookies I used soak too much liquid.

Really really delicious and not overly sweet like some recipes. It's worth noting, though, that you will need 2 or 3 times the amount of coffee/rum mixture that the recipe calls for.

Excellent easy Tiramisu recipe!  I would definitely double the coffee/rum amount. There is not enough in the recipe amount to moisten all of the lady fingers. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Awesome recipe. Easy to follow. I made it as directed. Had 2 different sources and textures of ladyfingers which concerned me, but it didn't matter. This tiramisu was a big hit.

try using Medaglia D'oro cafe espresso but also go authentic by using Punch Abruzzo instead of plain rum! you will get a much more authentic and complex flavor.

This was a complete success despite having fouled up the recipe mid-stream. Instead of whisking the mascarpone into the custard, I mixed it with the whipped cream. Having caught my error just after making it, I took half of the mascarpone mixture and mixed it with the custard. I'm sure it didn't really matter, but the end result was a bit more soft and creamy than the other tiramisu I've had. It was still wonderful and delicious and as I can recall, the best I've ever had. My family agrees.

This will definitely be one of my "go to" desserts.  It was delicious and fairly easy to make.  I made it a day ahead.  I even sprinkled it with the cocoa when I made it and it didn't get soggy.  I used a pan that was a bit bigger than my glass 11x7, which I think would have been too small.  I doubled the coffee/rum but didn't use all of it because I was afraid of it getting too soggy, but next time I would use more if not all of the doubled amount.  Delicious!

YUM YUM YUM!!! I made this with just a few changes.....like other reviews I mixed the whipping cream with the marscapone mixture and used kahlua instead of rum. I also made a crust with chocolate graham crackers sugar and butter. This recipe was AMAZING!!! Everyone loved it and kept raveing how good it was. This will be our Christmas dessert from now on!

My life is complete! Found the perfect recipes for tirumisu. I did this in a 13x9 pan and it filled it just nice. I let it stand for one day cos I could not wait for another day. 

Also, dip the cookies fast. Don't let it soak/drown or whatever. Do a quick dip so that it wont be soggy overall. For me, I had to triple the coffee liquor as I used more cookies. :D 

I could eat the whole tray worth of tirumisu myself.... omg thanks christine!

Oh, my goodness! This is amazing! Perfect blend of flavors! I made mine rum free, so I could have used rum extract, but couldn't find it in my grocery store that day. I used almond extract instead. I also added a touch of sugar to the whipping cream and vanilla. Maybe two TBSP. No matter what, this is the best Tiramisu I have had...ever!

Yay, it worked! This was my first attempt at making Tiramisu, so I was worried about it's outcome. Especially since it was for my husband's birthday and his whole family would be eating it. When I found the recipe, I didn't have time to read through the reviews. Therefore, I didn't make the changes that many recommended. I made this recipe exactly as written....how could that be wrong with a 5 star rating and 617 reviews?! Well, I'm so glad I made it exactly as written. It actually DID have 24 hours in the fridge before we ate it, which according to reviews, is a good thing. I used the crunchy lady fingers, and they turned out perfectly soft by the time we ate it. The coffee/rum was the perfect amount for someone who doesn't like a strong coffee flavor. I can't say enough good things. It got rave reviews from everyone, and we all liked it better than restaurant Tiramisu.

This turned out perfect on the first attempt Minor changes: mixed the yolk mixture + milk using a double boiler instead of a pan to avoid the eggs getting cooked, tripled the coffee (used purple nespresso shots- the better the coffee, the more authentic the tiramisu  tastes) and omitted the rum, drizzled it on the ladyfingers generousily with the sugar side down, mixed the filling and whipped cream together- easier to apply this way, refridgerated for >24 hrs and applied the cocoa powder prior to serving. Thanks for sharing this recipe

Delicious!  The only thing I would add to the recipe is the instructions on how to layer the lady fingers.  For a novice such as myself, I had no idea what to do and whether I had to separate them.  Will make again!

This is the first recipe I've reviewed here, and it definitely deserves more than 5 stars. I just wanted to add a comment about drizzling versus dunking the ladyfingers. I put the coffee/rum (or kahlua) mixture in a tall narrow cup. I then use a straw to pick up the liquid. Do this by immersing the straw then holding your thumb over the top, put the straw over the  ladyfinger and hold the straw at an almost horizontal level and slowly release your thumb. It is a very efficient way to evenly drizzle the ladyfingers with the exact amount of liquid. Superb.

Made it first time. Wanted to make Tiramisu and didn't really want to use recipe that calls for raw eggs. So I tried this one. The cream was a little to sweet at first so I added 2 tablespoons of sour cream to the cream mix before I put it on the bisquit. I know I'm supposed to let it sit because it will taste better after a while. But I don't think it will last 24 hours. What a great and easy recipe. Thank you

I wa sso nervous abt this one, bc the ignredients are expensive and also the issue of cooking the eggs. My first batch of eggs, I cooked too much and threw it out. I knew bc it was lumpy and looked scrambled...The second one I followed the directions to a T, and I got a smooth custard.

I learned you have to dip the ladyfingers in the coffee ( I didnt use rum bc I didnt have), if you dont dip the ladyfingers and just drizzle it, it doesnt get soaked as much it just stays dry. Besides that, the taste was amazing and only gets better and better...3 days later Im still eating it!!

I took the advice of many and did three layers, actually had to triple the espresso and liquor mixture for the amount of ladyfingers and cream this recipe suggested. I didn't use rum, I did with Frangelico and it was just divine.

I made this for Christmas dessert and it was a huge hit!  I found the soft ladyfingers near the bakery section of my grocery store (not in the cookie aisle).  I don't think it would come out quite the same with crunchy ladyfingers.  I used kahlua instead of rum and doubled the kahlua/coffee mixture.  I layered the custard and whipped cream (didn't mix it together like other reviewer) and it was great.  The unsweetened whipped cream is the perfect combination with the custard.   Will definitely make again!

MMMMM this recipe is soooo good, I used a double shot of espresso mixed with coffee and instead of rum I used Godiva white chocolate liqueur and doubled up on both. I have a dinner party to go to tomorrow and made a small tester just to make sure it would taste good which also gave me an excuse to have tiramisu for breakfast today (made it yesterday) ;0) I highly recommend this dessert recipe!

I made this exact to the recipe except I had to use a pound cake instead of the lady fingers because my supermarket does not sell them. I will definately triple, if not, quadruple the coffee/rum mixture next time as with the pound cake it was too dry. Excellent flavor though, and I like that the eggs are cooked. It's a keeper.

Love this recipe, however, cutting down to 1/2 of mascarpone cheese also work if you're looking for a low fat version.  I aslo love to add more rum and coffee just to kick it up another notch! And I made a mistake by serving it after 3 hours.  Two days of letting the cake soak through was perfect.

This was really good and pretty easy! I accidently whisked the mascarpone cheese into the whipped cream and panicked for a minute, but then I just decided to mix the custard into it and make it one big filling. It was really good and noone knew any different! The only thing I did purposely different was I added chocolate liquor into the coffee rum mixture. Very good, I will most definately be making this again.

This was amazing!  I did as recommended with the doubling of the coffee and liquer.  I used Tia Maria in place of the rum since I didn't have any and it was amazing!  Yes, waiting a day makes for a fantastic marriage of flavors.  Thanks for an outstanding recipe!

All I can say is everyone LOVED this! Only thing is double the rum/coffee mixture and don't drench the lady fingers (everything will go downward to the bottom of the dish and look soggy).

Served last night for friends - it was a huge hit.  Used soft ladyfingers, kahula (not rum), and doubled the coffee and kahula.  Made 48 hours ahead - a must.  Also, I was paranoid about "oversoaking" the ladyfingers"...especially since they were the soft variety - DRENCH THEM, I say!  They were great!

This was pretty good! Doubled the coffee/rum mixture and added a splash of kahlua. Next time I'll try amaretto instead. Definately more vanilla, otherwise it was great! I made the original recipe and it was almost polished off by just 6 people with one serving leftover, so it was a hit! Thanks!

this was the first tiramisu i made and it came out perfect. i didnt use cream, instead used the egg whites and added them after the mascarpone cheese.  I dipped the lady fingers in coffee-rum extract mixture and added some to the cheese mix for more flavor.  love the result.

What a great recipe! I had to use the hard ladyfingers b/c that's all I could find, but they worked perfectly.  I used about 3 times the rum/coffe mixture listed in the recipe.  Be sure to put it on a dish in the fridge - the liquid leaked out a little. I got tons of compliments on it. I stenciled a design on the top with the cocoa and tied a ribbon around it - it looked professional!

INCREDIBLE!!!!! I followed the advice of other reviewers & doubled the coffee/rum mixture.  I also used espresso instead of regular coffee.  My family loves Tiramisu & couldn't get over the fact that I'd actually made this!  I did put it in a trifle dish for presentation & doubled the whipped cream so that I'd have plenty.  Put some strawberries on top with chocolate shavings & it was perfect.

Oh my goodness...simply the absolute best thing in the world. My husband and myself are tiramisu connoisseurs - ok, not really, but we have tiramisu at every restaurant that we eat out at if its on the menu. There is one place in particular in our city that we go to simply just for their tiramisu...we have even ordered take out of that item....in fact, my husband was living across the country and I went to that restaurant, go some take out and went on a plane with the tiramisu and brought it to him because its that good. This recipe was an exact replica of that restaurants tiramisu. I cannot rave enough about it....its amazing! Only change I made was due to the comments to triple the esperesso/rum mix - it was the perfect amount. Thank you for a great recipe!

This was WONDERFUL! I  made this for my MIL for her birthday and she raved about it!  I did do some things differently and would do some things differently next time...and I promise, there will be a next time!  The big change I made this time was to use less Rum.  Most of my family drinks, but not often. And one of us doesn't drink at all because he doesn't like the taste of alcohol.  So, I used half of the listed rum.  I also followed all of the reviews and gave it 24 hours to set and when all was said and done...delicious!  I can't wait to make it again.  Next time though, I will use less rum again. I used 1/2 of the recommend rum this time and I would us 1/4 of what the recipe calls for next time. It was still too strong. Also, I would mix the whipped cream into the custard created. I will also add a little more sugar too, several people said it was just not quite sweet enough.    Overall, a great recipe.  I can't wait to make it again. (Really who doesn't like it when they can make the MIL happy?)

I made this recipe for the first time for a bake-off and it won!  I followed the advice of others and I made it well in advance of my competition to give the flavor plenty of time to come out.  Also, I doubled the coffee and liquor quantities. (I used half rum, and half Godiva Milk Chocolate liquor and it was great!) Like others, I could not find ladyfingers and used the recipe on this site.  The two recipes are very complimentary.  Thank you for posting, it was wonderful and I would recommend to anyone looking to impress!

This was fabulous!  Definitely get the lady fingers nice and soggy for the best effect.  Mine weren't as juicy and it was missing something.  Next time I'll double the coffee/rum as others suggested.

Restaurant quality or better! Time consuming, but so simple to prepare! I baked my own lady fingers(easy)and added half bar of cream cheese to 8oz of Mascarpone cheese and the flavor was immense, elegant and balanced.  The texture was light, creamy and fluffy! You must let the flavor bloom over night in the fridge. Must DO!

This recipe is awesome! It is realy easy to make and the preperation is well worth the time. You do need to double the coffee, but I left the rum out. I made this for a dinner party I threw a couple of weeks ago and everyone though I was an amazing cook - the whole thing was gone by the end of the night. Make this at your next gathering and you will be the star of the evening.

I tried out this recipe, and I'll tell you it is one of the best if not the best Tiramisu recipe that I have ever tried. I do agree with with another comment above. Due double the coffee and rum. The only thing that I did change was that I didn't cut the lady finger in half. I used 4 boxes of lady finger instead of 2 and I double the heavy cream.

As good as any Tiramisu I've tried at any restaurants.  However, you will definitely need more coffee & rum than the recipe suggests at least double.

This recipe was supuer easy to follow and didn't take as long to put together as I originally thought. I took this recipe to a 4th of July picnic and the dish was scrapped clean! My only concern was that the lady fingers would be soggy however they weren't. Next time I think I might use a bit more coffee and either pound cake or double up the ladyfingers. They seemed to get lost in the custard and I didn't really get the cake effect that you usually find in tiramisu.Super tasty.

I'd give this 20 stars if I could!!  I made this for a birthday party and it was a huge hit! I also doubled the amount of extra strength coffee and added a couple of shots of Kahlua to it too.  If you dip the lady fingers into the coffee/liquor mixture, do so quickly otherwise they'll be soggy.  I also highly recommend making this at least one day before so that the flavours have a chance to combine. Will definitely make this again!

I made this in a trifle bowl and brought it to a graduation party. Very good!! I did double up on the coffee/liquor mixture and used a pastry brush to coat the lady fingers. I layered everything in the trifle bowl and let it sit for 2 days.  I highly recommend making this a couple of days ahead of time as other reviewers have suggested. I was really worried that the lady fingers would be soggy, but they weren't! The flavors just aren't the same if you serve this the same day.

My 7 years old who doesn't like anything creamy LOVED this!  I was shocked.  I was also surprised at how easy this was.  I doubled the coffee like the other reviews suggested, I don't think it would have been nearly as good if I hadn't.

I wish I could give this recipe ten stars!  I made it for my sister's birthday, and she said it was better than her favorite Italian restuarant's tiramisu.  Now, that's the ultimate compliment from her :)  I did follow the suggestions to double the coffee and cream the marscapone cheese before combining, and it turned out heavenly!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

My favorite dessert in the whole world, and this recipe is every bit as good as the Tiramisu I've had at fancy Italian restaurants. I used soft lady finger cookies, which made it just like the texture I know from professionaly made tiramisu. You just have to be very carefull that you don't rip them after they've soaked up the coffee mixture. I used a spatula to transfer the soaked ladyfingers to the pan I was preparing the tiramisu in. BEST TASTE ON DAY 2-3! Make ahead!

I doubled the coffee alchole mix and let the dish sit for 2 days to meld like others suggested. I had a little extra that didnt fit in the dish that i tried right away and I tasted the coffee mix more then after it had sat for 2 days. I would make this again for sure. BUT, next time im going to add even more coffee mix and/or use french pressed coffee instead of just strong brewed from my coffee pot. Great recipie, We loved it! And it was easy to do aswell. Which is always a plus!

Phenomenal!  I am a huge tiramisu fan and am so excited that I can make it home now and it's so simple.  Some pointers:  definitely double the coffee/rum mixture.  Make the tiramisu 1-2 days ahead of serving.  Do NOT put the ladyfingers directly into the coffee mixture.  It soaks it up and turns it to mush. So, so good!

Made this for Easter and absolutely loved it.  I didn't have the size pan called for so used springform which worked out great.  I also replaced the rum with Kahlua since I didn't have rum on hand.  Sprinkled with shaved chocolate.  Doubled the coffee and rum mixture.  Fabulous!

OMG this was awesome.  Not too difficult to make.  I made it in a cheesecake pan and whipped extra topping and added coffee.  Then I used it to glue the ladyfingers to the sides.  Next time I will add more ladyfingers to the inside.  It was a big hit at a dinner party.

I loved this tiramisu, and so did everyone else! It was hands-down the BEST tiramisu I ever made.  I made only two minor adjustments.  I added a little vanilla to the custard mixture.  And, I used Kahlua instead of rum.  It was just fantastic!

Delicious!  Great texture.  My fiance and I made this for the initial meeting of our parents and it was a huge hit.  Definitely make 2 days ahead as others suggest.  I was afraid it would be too soggy after two days but it wasn't.  Very, very good and we will make it again.

It tastes terrific and easy to make! It is not too sweet and melts in your month and you want more and more. I used 2 tbsp. champagne cognac into my espresso coffee and worked wonderful with whole Tiramisu. My bf and his family love it! One thing turns me down is this tiramisu recipe is really high calories and fat. I made this fatty one for my bf and a low-fat one for myself.

Oh my.  This recipe was fantastic!  I was adventurous and made it for Christmas dessert before trying ahead of time.  Everyone loved it and requested it for a get together we are having this weekend- just 3 weeks later! I'm glad I took the chance.  I did double the coffee mixture like many reviews said.  This recipe will be enjoyed for years to come in our family!

This was wonderful. Everyone loved it. I combined the two layers (pudding and whipped cream) before layering it with the cookies. I used Kalhua insted of rum and I also tripled the amount. The pudding/whipped cream layer was a little lumpy, i will see if I can put the pudding through a sieve to get rid of the lumps next time. I am definitely making this again!! thank you!

I made this for a work party and everyone loved it.  The only thing I changed was I used chocolate shavings to top it off as I don't like cocoa powder.  You won't go wrong with this recipe.

All and all, this is an excellent recipe. However, I did not read the reviews first and I concur, the rum and coffee must be doubled.  Also, soft lady fingers are better since the hard ones are impossible to cut in half.

WOW!!!  This was delicious.  It should be against the law to eat something this decadent.  I could only find 3oz packages of lady fingers.  I bought 5 packs and only used 2.  I was extra generous so I can only think I used different ones than the recipe intended.  I'm glad I had some left over.  I can't wait to make this again!

This is a great recipe and its my first time to make tiramisu. Initially, I thought it was complicate dto make but after seeing this recipe, I went ahead and made one for our Christmas dinner. My family loved it!! I followed the advice of some of the reviewers here and added more esspresso and liqueur (rum). Then allowed it to sit in the fridge for 24 hours. It taste incredible! I'm impressed! The only caveat is that it was hard to get mascarpone in the stores, esp. during this season. A friend told me I could use light cream cheese instead but I wanted to get the real taste of mascarpone. Luckily, I found a tub of it in a 24 hour supermarket and it was on sale!

12/23 Ok - Here's what I did: used 1tlb rum to 6 fresh pulled shots of espresso from Starbucks. I brushed the mixture onto each of the lady fingers twice using a pastry brush but I didn't use all of the mixture, so I probably could of halved the ingredients. However, I think they could have used more espresso flavor so next time I will brush the lady fingers with four layers. I also used 3 packages of lady fingers and made three layers instead of two in an 8x8 brownie pan. I also added 1 1/2 tbl powdered sugar in the whipped cream. Everything else I did the same. Tasted Great!

I had not made Tiramisu in ages, because my recipe (from my Italian grandmother)called for an uncooked egg-based cream. Christine's recipe is fantastic. Easy to make, delicious, and no raw eggs!

Deceptively easy - as long as you don't burn the custard, the rest is just assembly. I used Starbucks coffee liqueur and espresso, sprinkled some cocoa in the middle, and topped with bittersweet chocolate shavings. If you want to decorate the top, make extra whipped cream. I made it 2 days ahead, and it was great!

This was incredibly delicious and professional tasting. Great recipe! 

Changes I made from reading other reviews: I doubled the amount of coffee but kept the rum amount the same. I used hard lady fingers, but they seemed to be soft enough after quickly dipping them in the coffee mixture (don't dip them too long or they'll end up really mushy). I will definitely make this again!

Made this for a dinner party and everyone thought I bought it!!  I tripled the amount of coffee I used and i drizzled some into the mascarpone mixture for a stronger flavor.

I followed the instructions and I got a delicious tiramisu cake. I followed the recommendations left by one of the reviewer and left the cake in the fridge for one night before eating it. The rum soaked through the ladyfingers and flavor was wonderful.

Mmmmmh...delicious. I have a picky Italian husband and I've already tried lots of Tiramisu recipes and none of them could please him. But with this recipe he just went silent, ate the whole thing and said it was one of the best he's eaten so far:-). I followed the advices to double the coffee, but did not double the alcohol (I used cognac and not rum). Really does turn out like something you get served in the restaurant. Thank you for sharing this great recipe:-)

I have always loved Tiramisu but thought it would be difficult to make.  This desert was absolutely wonderful and not a bit of trouble.  Yum - Yum

absolutely amazing! 
i followed everyone's suggestions -especially the part about completely soaking the ladyfingers in super strong coffee vs. drizzling...came out perfect. everyone loved it and i even got a 'this is the best tiramisu i've ever eaten' comment. made me super happy :) thanks for sharing!

This was the first time I've made tiramisu and I served it at dinner party we had tonight and it was a big hit!  I didn't have any rum on hand but it still turned out delicious!  Love it!

My husband and friends said this was the best tiramisu I have made to date.  I did double the coffee and rum. I used raspberry flavored rum just for a little change and it was delicious if you like a hint of raspberry.

This was really exceptional and better than a lot of tiramisu I have had in restaurants!  I followed the suggestion of others and doubled the coffee and liquor (I used both rum and kahlua).  And, I substituted frozen pound cake for the ladyfingers, which is easy to find year-round.  I served this to my family after about 48 hours, and it was great.  I will definitely make this again!

Fantastic!!!
I followed suggestions and prepared it 2 days before hand. I also made the ladyfingers from a recipe found here. 
I only had 1/2 a pound of marscapone cheese, but it worked out just fine. No runniness either. I also used 3/4 cups of espresso & 6 tbsp of Bailey's Irish Cream 'Caramel flavour'. It was to die for. 
I also made this in my 9" springform pan.

I made this for my sewing group and received rave reviews.  Everyone said it was the best they had ever had!  I substituted Kahlua for the rum.  The flavors peak at about 36-48 hours so it is a great "make-ahead" dessert.  I will absolutely make this again!

This is THE recipe for Tiramisu. I have tried many recipes and this one is by far the best. Follow the suggestions from previous reviewers and this will turn out magical. I served this last at my Christmas party and it was a hit for a crowd. It was all gone in minutes. 
Make sure you make it early in advance (day or ever 2), beat consistently while making the egg mixture and double the coffee. Enjoy!

Excellent recipe to start with but I did have to make a several changes. I quadrupled the espresso and only doubled the liquor (it was for sunday family dinner), I used the Starbucks coffee liquor, ended up used almost double the whipped cream (but I did decorate the top with it), and dusted cocoa powder on each layer. I didn't split my lady fingers (used 1 1/2 pkgs) and I used a 9 inch springform pan. Made this 2 days in advance but definately could have made it 3 days in advance. Only gave this recipe 4 stars because I feel alot of the measurements are off. Next time I will try making my own ladyfingers.

Excellent recipe. I should've read the other reviews and doubled or tripled the coffee, but even so the results were amazing. (Also, I made my own ladyfingers which were much thinner and softer than store-bought.)

This was AWESOME!!! I absolutely loved this tiramisu! The only change I made was using fresh brewed Starbucks espresso inplace of the coffee and Kahlua instead of the rum, other than that I followed this recipe exactly! I had a few 4 1/2" springform pans, so I made "individual" tiramisu (though they were very large to eat in 1 sitting). It was a special treat for my boyfriend on Valentine's Day, he said it was one of the best, if not the best tiramisu's he's ever had! Thanks for the awesome recipe!!!

This tiramisu is absolutely the best.  I am the cook at a senior citizen center so made the recipe for 72.  They oohed and aahed through the whole thing.  Did the recipe the same as written just doubled the coffee and used rum extract. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

Excellent recipe, easy to make, and fabulous taste (but you do need to wait at least 24 hrs -- if not 48 hrs --  to allow the flavors to meld before tasting).  My grocers did not have plain mascarpone cheese, so I bought "coffee flavored" mascarpone.... it was perfect!!

Made this for my husband's birthday and was so pleased!  I was a little worried as I had never made a tiramisu before but it turned out perfect.  My only problem was finding ladyfingers at the grocery store.  I used a springform pan and only had the 3 distinct layers but still great.

Made it for a dinner party and it was a hit! Even the kids loved it. When cooking the egg, sugar and milk mixture keep stirring else it'll turn lumpy. I stuck it into the freezer for 30 minutes instead. Doubled the dose of the coffee and rum (it will smell extremely rummy, don't worry) as advised by other reviewers. Lovely texture.

This was awesome. I used twinkies instead of lady fingers, cut them in half and soaked them in the tripled coffee/liquor mix. I used vanilla rum & kaluha (sp?) and sprinkled 2 layers with powdered mocha. Will keep this recipe forever!!!

This is one of the best desserts I've ever made (and generally a dessert has to be chocolaty for me to love it).  I made it instead of a cake for my mother's birthday and everyone was blown away but how delicious it was.

Heavenly! I only left out the rum since I'm allergic to alcohol and used a slight bit too much coffee. I didn't check how much I'd used, I just kept adding the coffee and soaking the ladyfingers until they were quite mushy. Bad idea!

I also reduced the sugar by 1/3 and it still came out perfect.

The crowd loved it.  It wasn't too sweet.  I was just right.

absolutely delicious....could have doubled the recipe and it still would have been gone!!  If you can manage to save some, the melding of the flavours would be great!

Excellent. My husband loved it. Needs to set a lot longer than 4-6 hours though. I would make it the day before!! Even better the next day!

Awesome recipe!  Based on reviews, I used extra coffee/rum mixture and dunked the lady fingers but it came out too soggy.  Next time I'll drizzle like the recipe says.  It definitely takes a day or two for the flavors to meld.  Absolutely delicious!!

This was ok. I don't really like Tiramisu but I made it for someone who likes it and he didn't rave but said it was good and looked like he liked it. I used a little extra coffee. I did enjoy it even though it is not my favorite dessert. Looked great.

Yummy! I increased the Rum, and let it set for 24 hours.  It was delicioso!

AWESOME RECIPE!!! The first day it was not so good, but it tastes better after every day. Two days of refrigerating and you've got one great tiramisu!

Best I've ever had...and that is including restaurants and everything.  For tiramisu...it was very easy to cook and very enjoyable.  Had to fight the family for a piece.
