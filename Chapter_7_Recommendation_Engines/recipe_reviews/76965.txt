We love gingerbread with a full and spicy flavor.  This certainly is both of those.  The only thing I changed was to add a 1/2 cup of applesauce to the batter.  It smoothed the spices a bit and made it even more moist.  I served it with a Kentucky Bourbon reduction (hard sauce) and it was fantastic.  The kids loved theirs with Cool Whip.  We'll definately make this again.

Loved this with a light vanilla cream sauce. I replaced 1/4 cup of molasses with 1/4 cup of applesauce.

This is fabulous!  I split the batter into two bread pans and baked for 45 minutes. Light and fluffy without skimping on flavor. I will definitely make it again.  Next time I will use a larger measuring cup  to mix the wet ingredients...I had an overflow situation.

I thought this recipe was just ok.  It has a slightly strange taste to me and I think it has to do with the spices.  I think I should have used less ginger and added some cloves and nutmeg.  I made the cake in two loaf pans and baked them for 50 minutes.  They didn't rise very much and once I cut into the cake, it dried out very quickly.  I frosted the cake with cream cheese frosting and that really improved it.  Next time I make gingerbread, I will probably try a different recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as stated with the exception of using light brown sugar rather than dark (because that's all I had).  The cake was dry and tasteless.  I doubled checked my ingredients to be sure because of all the marveleous reviews the recipe had gotten.  I don't think I'll try this one again.

Moist and delicious. Hubby, who almost never eats cake, took a bite and ended up cutting himself a nice big slice. Made cream cheese frosting which complimented the cake very nicely. Thanks!

This recipe is fantastic! I baked it in the alternate method of two 8x8 pans. I frosted one with cream cheese frosting and left the other plain. I substituted whole wheat flour for white flour and brown sugar Splenda for the sugar. So moist, spicy and delicious!! A real hit with the whole family! I'll be making this again!

This gingerbread spice cake was wonderful! I didn't make any changes to the recipe, and followed it to a "T". It came out tender and moist, not crumbly or dry. The flavor was perfect. After cooling it completely,  I served it with a lemon sauce. My family raved about it, and everyone wanted seconds. Thanks for a delicious recipe.  It's a keeper!

I made this for my fiance's luncheon for work.  I used a 10 inch bundt pan instead of a 9x13 inch flat.  I increased the cook time to 60 minutes to compensate for the change.  This went over fairly well with her workmates.  I gave it a 4 because she usually comes home with recipe requests.

Definitely a great recipe.  It was very flavorful and moist and was great with a bit of whipped cream.  I would probably opt for a bit "healthier" gingerbread recipe if it were just for me and my husband, but for guests - this is the way to go!

My son and his bride wanted a gingerbread cake for their wedding cake, so I tried this recipe. Wonderful choice! Very moist, full of flavor and everyone loved it.  I made it with a lemon curd filling, frosted with whipped cream buttercream frosting and covered with marshmallow fondant.

This was wonderful!  I am not a huge gingerbread fan, but this was delicious.  I just finished it with a dusting of confectioners' sugar.  It would be delicious served ala mode with vanilla ice cream, or a dollop of whipped cream.  We are vegans so I had to "veganize" it and it still came out perfectly!

Yum ! I used the caluculator and recalculated this recipe to 27 servings and it made 1 Nordic bundt cake plus 6 wilton mini bundt cakes the only thing different in my caluculation/recipe was to increase the recalc. from 1 2/3 milk to 2 cups of milk and I used the blender to tork up the batter for a perfect blend. :-)

I love gingerbread, and was really looking forward to this cake. It was moist but not very flavorful, and very heavy. (I did not frost it, and everyone kept saying "this would be good if it had some cream cheese frosting.") It also takes a LOT of ingredients, and I was really disappointed with the result. I will not be making this one again.

I really did not care for the flavor of this cake.  It did not taste like spice cake to me.  I had intended to bring it to a ladie's function for the desert and I was glad I tried it ahead of time.  I wanted it to be fabulous but it was not.

The cornstarch in this recipe seemed odd -- and it  (I think that is what threw it off) gave the cake the weirdest consistency. 
Also, it said to put it in a 9x13 pan...I think  9x9 may have made a difference. It just didn't rise very much and was thin and flat.
I wanted to like this recipe because the flavor was good -- but the consistency was just to chewy/dry/flat.

I like odd tastes, but should have used less molasses. It overpowered this cake, even though I used a bit more ginger and a bit of nutmeg as well. I also subbed additional flour for the cornstarch. Not very moist, but not too dry. Again, if I liked traditional tastes better I probably would not have liked this cake at all, but I made the Cream Cheese Icing II and that redeemed it a bit.

Even though I cut back on the ginger and added nutmeg, there was a sort of odd flavor that other reviewers commented on.  I'm wondering if it's the combination of butter and cornstarch.  I've never seen cornstarch like this in a baking recipe, and I think my old standby recipe called for oil.  I think I'll keep looking for a better gingerbread, and get rid of this one.

1st-This is not a recipe I would make for myself, as I didn't like the outcome.  
2nd - This recipe is for some of my elder friends from down south (the poor south) and they absolutely love it! I made changes to the amount of ginger I used.  Other than that no changes.  As I stated, My Elder Friends Love It!

I split the recipe into 5 mini loaf pans.  I divided it evenly and probably should have used 6 mini loaf pans as the batter spilled over.  Silver lining is that I got a bowl full of gingerbread "droppings" for myself, as all the loaves were to give away.  :)  I will definitely try the sheet cake method next time.

Very good in loaf pans, the recipe made two and I had to up the bake time to about 50 minutes. Didn't have any allspice so I used pumpkin pie spice in equal measure plus a sprinkle of ground clove. Delicious uniced for breakfast or frosted with cream cheese icing for dessert.
