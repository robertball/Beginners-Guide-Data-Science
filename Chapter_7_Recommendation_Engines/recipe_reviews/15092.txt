this recipe is delicious.  If you will add a half a cup of peanut butter to the chocolate it keeps it creamier and stops it from getting hard and breaking up.  It also gives it a richer taste.  The other thing I do is use milk chocolate chips.  a litle secret is you can use any flavor chips you want and they all make their own flavor ie..white chocolate, or butterscotch.

They turned out even better than I expected! I lined my dish with parchment paper and that worked out great. I only used 2 cups of confec. sugar. As for the chocolate, I used 1/2 milk chocolate and 1/2 semisweet, added a tbsp of margarine and a rounded tablespoon of peanut butter. Let me tell you... the chocolate was excellent. Cutting it was no problem either. We put it into the freezer for about 15 min, then removed it to slice, and then put in the fridge to finish setting. At first we cut into large 2 inch squares, but later I cut them into smaller (1 inch) squares, which worked out better for us (see my 2 pics). They are rich, so it's perfect to have a small piece at a time. At least it worked out that way for my family:-) This is a definitaly a keeper!

Delicious!  I didn't change a thing.  I made two batches for a bake sale tomorrow and am disappointed I can't keep them all for myself.  FYI: I figured out that 2.5 cups graham cracker crumbs is the same as 15 whole graham crackers (where each graham cracker is 4 of the small rectangles).  At least that's how they do them around here.

These were really, really good. I made a few small changes to reduce the fat/sugar content: used reduced fat graham crackers (about 16 crushed up), reduced fat peanutbutter and I reduced the amount of sugar to 2 cups and used 2/3 cup melted margarine instead of the butter. I also used equal parts of milk chocolate chips and semi-sweet chips for the chocolate layer and topped 1/2 the batch with finely chopped pecans and shredded coconut.

These were wonderful!!!  Sooo very easy.  I lined the pan with parchment and let it hang over the edge of the pan.  I just lifted the whole thing out and they sliced perfectly.  Thank you, this will be used often.

These are absolutely delicious.  Originally I made them for dessert tonight, but when they came out I had to have a little taste...WOW.  I made the mistake of cutting them right out of the fridge....didn't see the other reviews until too late, and the chocolate layer did not stick to the peanut butter layer and cracked all over the place.  Now I know to let them come up to room temperature.  I also used chuncky (honey roasted) peanut butter and milk chocolate.  Definate do over. "Too easy...don't tell anyone!"  Thanks for the post.

I thought this tasted great, just like the PB cups. I would recommend milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet. Also, I refridgerated the bars for an hour, then tried to cut them. Bad mistake. The chocolate layer cracked as I cut it. I'd recommend only putting it in for a short while (5 min) then cut, or at least let the bars warm up to room temp before cutting.

These are addictive, even with my lowering fat changes!  I used half the margarine, just 2 cups of sugar, and 1 cup milk chocolate chips.  The excess sugar and fat seems unnecessary, as it is plenty tasty with a lot less!  Great treat.  Fast to make and no hot oven!

Based on other reviews I cut the butter down to 3/4 cup and it was plenty.  Next time I would increase the amount of chocolate and use a bigger tin - I found the base was too thick.  Great taste though.

These were excellent!  I took them to a lunch at church and everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.  I followed some of the other reviewers advice and only used 2 cups of sugar, used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, and added melted peanut butter chips to the top and swirled them together with the milk chocolate.  I had to wait about 20 minutes before they were hard enough to cut, then I chilled them overnight.  Wonderful!

To stop the chocolate from cracking, simply add in 4 tbsp veg shortening into the chocolate when you're melting it. That way you get the creamy consistency, but you don't get an overpowering peanutbutter taste.

I just made this tonight. I would NOT add 1 tbsp of margargine to the chocolate chips "to make it creamier" as one poster mentioned.  When I did this, all of my melted chips SOLIDFIED into one big blob and would not move! When I tried to remelt in the microwave, it just got worse. THE WORST "helpful hint" I ever received from a web posting. I can't comment on how they came out yet, I just placed them in the fridge after re-doing my chocolate chips. Hoping I like them as much as the other posters here...

Sensational! For fellow choclate lovers out there instead of chocolate chips, melt a mouth watering blend of 70 % Dark Bakers Chocolate and Semi-Sweet Bakers Chocolate (a whole package of each chopped and melted together will do nicely) OR use your favourite solid chocolate bar, then pour that on top for a thicker chocolate layer.           Go ahead you deserve it!    Also using mini muffin cups you can create that P-butter cup feeling.  Fill the mini cups half way with the p-nut part then gently spoon a thick layer of chocolate on top.  Kids of all ages love em and they're great for events that require finger deserts.

These are very good and I love how there is a nice thick graham cracker/peanut butter layer. I would suggest placing waxed paper on top of your pan and also adding 1/2 cup peanut butter to your chocolate mixture and the chocolate will NOT CRACK. Also, I would refrigerate for about 15-20 minutes and then they will cut easily with no mess!

Everytime I make these, people absolutely RAVE about them.  Super easy and THIS is my favorite recipe of all the ones listed for chocolate peanut butter bars!  One of my secrets that I have discovered...prior to cutting the bars, I put bars in freezer for about 5 minutes...it prevents chcocolate from getting to sloppy all over the bars....made a BIG difference and made the bars look a lot cleaner.

Following the advice of others, I added an extra heaping scoop of peanut butter and they turned out much creamier and less crumbly. So yummy! Made 2 8x8 pans but had to heat up another 11 ounces of chocolate to go on the second pan.

Yum!  I only used 2 cups of sugar, only because its all I had, but they still came out delish!  As with other's suggestions, I lined my pan with wax paper and used a pizza cutter to cut the bars before the chocolate was completely set (about 15 min. in the fridge).  I refridgerated overnight and breaking apart the precut bars was a sinch and very simple to peel off the wax paper.  The only addition I made to the recipie was I put down a small layer of chocolate on the bottom before layering the peanutbutter mixture (just for fun) - but even if I didn't do this, this recipe as is....amazing and definately a keeper!

I've made these twice now and both times they turned out great.  It is a good idea to mix the melted butter and peanut butter together first to make mixing the rest easier.  Also, like other reviewers mentioned, putting the first layer in the fridge for a few minutes helps the chocolate layer set quicker.  I also put it back in the fridge after the chocolate is added.  Just don't leave it in the freezer too long as the layers will separate when cutting smaller pieces.  Awesome quick, inexpensive recipe!

I am making these for holiday gifts. Wanted something easy that would help me use up my peanut butter stash. I only used one stick of butter, upped the amount of peanut butter to 2 1/2 cups and lowered the amount of powdered sugar and graham cracker crumbs to 2 cups. I found that if you melt the butter and peanut butter very well before adding other ingredients it is easier to spread into pan. Used 1 bag of milk chocolate chips with 1/2 cup peanut butter added when melting. Used a 9 x 13 lined with wax paper with overhang. Let set up in fridge then lifted out of pan with no problems. Then wrapped in foil and froze. When ready to give as gifts, remove, bring to room temp, slice, and box (I put each piece in a cupcake liner). Very happy with this  recipe. :-) Taste very much like a reese's

I am so impressed with this recipe.  So easy.  I had to make 2 batches and the first one was a trial for sure.  Very messy preparing but the 2nd one went much smoother.  I did not use parchment paper and I would definitely say that parchment paper is a must for a couple reasons.  #1 The first bunch crumbled horribly because I cut into them and tried to serve them within the first hour, but if you use Parchment paper I do not think this would be a problem.  Reason # 2 is I let the 2nd batch sit overnight in the fridge and they set really nicely but were tough to get out, so parchment would help.  Whether you use parchment or not you MUST at least cut into them once the chocolate sets (15-20 mins in fridge).  Also, definitely mix the chocolate with a little peanut butter.  Made it very smooth and chocolate did not crack.  Great recipe.

Wonderful!  I'm really not a fan of graham crackers or the crumbs but they are really necessary for these and you cannot tell they are in there!  I had just a small amount of peanut butter left in the jar so I added a little extra to the bottom layer and about 2 T to the chocolate layer.  I did halve the recipe and used an 8x8 pan.  These are a keeper!

RIDICULOUS!  That's how good these are!  I was glad to read they could be frozen, but truthfully we will eat them all before I get them in the freezer.  I did cut butter to 3/4 cup as others recommended to save a little on fat and calories.  I softened the butter in the microwave and then added the pb to the bowl to finish melting the butter and soften the pb.  Made it very easy to mix.  I will probably add an extra cup of chocolate chips on top as anotehr reviewer did, but just because I like a little more chocolate.  These are great the way they are written.  I will try not to make these too often as we eat way too many!

OMG!  These are so simple and so good.  I did use reduced fat peanut butter.  I reduced the recipe by half, using an 8 x 8 pan.  I'm glad I did because I would have eaten way too many!  We will make these often, and I can already see several full batches for the holidays!

This was a good but it was also greasy. I would definitely use only 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1 cup. I also added 1 cup of chocolate chips and used chunky peanut butter instead of creamy :)

Super simple, and AMAZINGLY good! I would note though that if you use regular peanut butter they will be incredibly sweet, so I use the natural peanut butter thats just peanuts, and its fine, anything else would be way to sweet! Someone also suggested shortening in with the chocolate so that it wasnt so crumbly, and about 1/3 to 1/2 a cup was perfect, let sit for about 10 minutes in the fridge, cut them, and then let them harden completely. I highly doubt these will last long!

Tasty, quick, and affordable to make for a dessert.  Ate before but not sure where.  No baking to required just a microwave.  Always gets eaten up very quickly!  For a small family I found to cut recipe in half just use an 8x8 or square pan and half the ingredients.  The only tricky one is the confectioners sugar and I use 1 cup plus 6 tablespoons for half the recipe.  And, like another reviewer said the graham cracker crumbs can be subtituted with an equal amount of honey graham crackers crushed.

I have made this recipe at least 6 times all to rave reviews. I like to add just a little more peanut butter for flavor and just a little more chocolate chips to evenly coat. If you score the peanut butter/butter/sugar mix a bit before adding the melted chocolate it helps the layers stay together a bit better. Love it! Easy and quick.

I was looking for something other than cookies for my boys to make with me.  They are 2yrs. and 4yrs. old and this worked great!  I had them each unwrap a stick of butter and put it in the bowl then each smash a bag of graham crackers while I combined the butter peanut butter and powdered sugar. They couldn't wait to eat them!  However I am on Weight Watchers and the points are really high on this dessert. The dessert is 3.5 Weight Watchers points if cut into 48 pieces.  I cut 4 rows then cut 12 slices in each row.  It was 7 WW points if left in 24 servings.  Easy to make and tastes pretty good.

Made as specified except only used 1/2 cup butter instead of 1 cup to cut down on fat/calories.  Still turned out good.  Husband and kids both devoured.

Followed instructions as is except added 1 extra cup of choc chips.  I just didn't think it would cover the whole thing.  Hubby LOVES them!  The first one busted when I tried to get it out of the pan, but all the others came out beautifully.  Next time I will wait 10-15 minutes before cutting and definitely crush the graham crackers finely.  My husband loves you, Justine.

So yummy!  Very rich!  Added a big spoon of peanut butter to the chocolate like others suggested.  Not sure how others fit all this into a 8x8 pan.  I did not use a 9x13 but I had a weird 8x12 (not sure where this pan came from) that worked great.

These were VERY easy and delicious!!! I did reduce the confectioners' sugar to 2 cups, added about a half a cup of peanut butter to the milk chocolate chips and used an 8x8 pan because a 9x13 pan was too big. I will definitely make these again!

Amazing.  Just remember to cool entirely in the fridge and then allow to come to room temp before cutting so as to avoid the chocolate seperating from the bar itself.   YUM! These are my husbands favorite!

Ohhh so good! I did reduce the butter to 1/2c (1 stick) and found that to be plenty. The crust was not dry at all and firmed up in the fridge with no problem. I have made another PB bar recipe on this site and used all the butter suggested and I literally poured the crust in the pan....yes it did firm up and was delicious....but I think I prefer this recipe and use less butter. The taste is great and it will totally satisfy the PB/Choco. fix....thanks for a yummy recipe!

These are great.  I added my peanut butter into my hot butter so that it would blend smoothly.  I also allowed these to set for a few minutes in the freezer before cutting them. I then placed them in the fridge so that they could finish setting.

One word: Yummy!
I'm a fudge lover, and I think I like this just as well, if not better. I know one thing, it was much easier to make! I've tried fudge - for some reason it never turned out like my mom's. *sigh* I loved this though!
My husband thought it would take us forever to eat it because of the richness... HA! It was gone in a day or two. I knew it would be!

Very easy recipe to make! I used 2 c confectioners sugar. I did use the parchment paper and it worked well. I mixed 1 T of peanut butter in with the melted chocolate. Cut in to small pieces as it is rich. Tastes like a peanut butter cup. This was popular and enjoyed by all. Thanks to previous reviews before I made it.-The Entertaining Hen

OMG!! This recipe taste just like a Reese's cup... I have been waiting my whole life to figure out how they make their peanut butter so good. Well here it is! LOL I would probably use a little less sugar next time tho. I liked them room temperature after they were cooled in the fridge, but my husband preferred them chilled. Either way, they were a HIT!

This is IT! This is the one! Growing up and attending a small public school, we had these bars once a month and the recipe went to the grave with the chef. I have tried to replicate over the years and now I found the secret is the GRAHAM CRACKER crumbs!Thank you Justine, the search is finally over :)

I needed to bring a desert to a BBQ and did not want to turn on the oven.  This was great.  My 8 & 10 year olds did it almost "all be themselves".  We used natural no sugar added PB and it was still incredibly sweet.  We will definitely makes this again.

Good recipe, easy to make.  The only change I made was to add a few tbsp of shortening to the melted chocolate so it would be easier to cut when set.  Really liked the bars very tasty.

So glad I found this... Gran used to make them for me and used to know the recipe by heart... alas forgot.

Definately add peanut butter to the chocolate for best results.  Will require longer refrigeration before cutting.  These freeze fabulously if you can't finish a full pan before you get tired of them.

These turned out great, I did add a 1/2 cup of peanut butter to the melted chocolate chips for the topping like the previous review suggested.

I absolutely love these bars. It has been a few years since I last had them. I like the graham cracker to be larger than crumbs. I made these today with a twist, for a Christmas present. We didn't have graham crackers, so I substituted coconut. I rolled them into balls and froze them for 1/2 hr. and then dipped them into the chocolate. They are so good, and not terribly sweet!  I think I could have done with less butter, though. But, that is with the coconut. I am not sure if I had done it with graham crackers.

Made these today - delicious.  I only had a little over a cup and a half of the graham crumbs but they're fine with just that much.  Usually make peanut butter balls but hate the mess of the dipping.  These were much easier - a little hard to cut but I cut them in small squares and they look find.  I agree with one reviewer that they taste like the Reece's Peanut butter cups.  I also used the milk chocolate chips as I prefer them.  Yummy

Delicious and easy! I made 7 recipes (all from this website) for a church coffee hour. This recipe got rave reviews and disappeared first. I hand mixed the peanut butter / graham mixture, but I wished I'd used my mixer since it got so thick.  Melting the chocolate in the microwave slowly but surely was a lot easier than getting yet another pan dirty.  I did let them sit too long before cutting into squares so the chocolate hardened. The directions to refrigerate for only 5 minutes, then cutting into squares would have been best.   Oh, one little tip I did right. I used a 9 x 13 disposable aluminum container from the store and cut each corner when ready to serve. That way I could fold down the sides and cut into bars more easily than flipping out and trying to cut into squares. I also dipped my knife in boiling water in between cuts so the chocolate didn’t crack.  Nice presentation.

YUM Justine! Just found out it was my neighbors birthday so I put an emergency call in to daughter number 1 who's a manager for Bath and Body Works to bring home a pretty Fall candle and then went on a hunt for a quick but delish no bake recipe. I'm a Reeses freak so I knew this had to be a winner. Personally I love the graininess the graham crackers gives the bars as it reminds me very much of the infamous peanut butter cup. I found that I didn't have quite enough crackers so I supplemented with rolled oats and ended up loving the chewy texture it added. Took the great advice from "zmo" and used parchment paper to line my pan and another from Lisa who suggested adding PB to the chocolate. Also listened to others and only used two cups of sugar.  Fantastic little dessert Justine and thank you!

Holy cow these are awesome!  I was craving peanut butter and chocolate and this definitely satisfied that craving.  These are absolutely perfect as written and I would not change a thing.  These will definitely be made again in my house.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe! It was very quick and super easy! I used crunchy peanut butter, reduced the confectioners sugar to 2 cups, and added 2 teaspoons of shortening to the semi-sweet chocolate chips when melting, which produced a smooth and glossy chocolate that set up to a perfect semi-hard state, making it very easy to slice while still remaining firm. When I was ready to store these, I cut them into even smaller bite sized pieces, as they are very rich and sweet, but SO yummy!

Theses are way too good!  You will love them if you are a Reese's fan.  I think they are much better when they are at room temp rather than just out of the fridge.

I gave it five stars due to the simplicity of such a delicious treat; a fun rainy day moment with two young kids. I used almond butter rather then peanut butter since that is what my family seems to prefer; and the idea of adding 1/2 cup of it to the melted chocolate is brilliant. Rich flavour of chocolate without all the cracking when serving. Definitely take the time to precut squares 15 minutes after placing in the refrigerator to make it easier. Even though I reduced the icing sugar to 2 C, I will cut it even lower next time...perhaps because I used semi-sweet chocolate on top. My sweet tooth, as powerful as it is, was surprisingly a touch overwhelmed. Will keep this one around for when the little ones have an urge to "bake"!

I refrigerated the peanut mix in the pan, then cut out shapes and dipped them in the chocolate with a dollop of peanut butter. They made great Brown Bear Bars for my son's Kindergarten class.

These were quick and very easy to make.  Had a good taste but a little dry.  Think another chocolate topping that doesn't set up so hard would be better.

This is really good, although I think I added too many graham crackercrumbs as the bottom was a little dry.  I used 15 whole grahams crumbled finely as another reviewer suggested and then added 3 more when the first batch only yielded about 1 3/4 cups.  I think 15 would have been perfect. Will make this again, but think it needs to be tweaked a bit.

I made these for Easter but did as chocolover09suggested making the box brownies and putting these on top.They didnt stick to the brownies at all. Any suggestions to make them stick next time? They are still wonderful and very easy to make. My daughter agrees they taste  exactly like a Reeses Peanut Butter Cup she cant stop sampling them.

these were awsome! even my fiance's sister who made the exact same thing (only her recipe called for a bunch of powdered sugar) admitted that mine were better then hers. Everyone said they tasted like reeses peanut butter cups. I used ghirardelli milk chocolate chips instead of the simi-sweet chocolate chips. They were fantastic. The only trouble I had with them was spreading the chocolate on the very cumbly mixture. I ended up spreading it as far to the edge as I could and just cut out the imperfections. overall great recipe I will definatly make these again and again.

I halved the recipe for an 8x8 pan. Was craving peanut butter cups and these were pretty darned close! I ground the graham crackers in a mini food processor for finer crumbs and used natural peanut butter.  The natural PB means the squares can't be left out for too long before they start to get melt-y, but that's ok--if they were out in sight we'd eat them all at once!

I was looking for a recipe that would take me back to my school days -you know those chocolate peanut butter bars they served in the cafeteria (so good) and this didn't do it.  The texture of the peanut butter filling is a little strange, not bad just different.  We did not like the semi-sweet chocolate at all.  It was way too strong for these bars.  We ended up peeling the chocolate off and throwing it away.  I think milk chocolate would taste so much better.

Very good!  I used my blender to make the graham cracker crumbs so they would be really fine.  I also used a cookie sheet - to make more, turned out just fine- not thick like the picture.  The only adjustment I needed for the cookie sheet was about a 1/2 cup more morsels.
After five minutes in the frigde I pulled the cookie sheet out to cut them, they started to melt.  So I stuck them back in fridge already cut, then 1/2 later pulled them out and placed them in an airtight container.  Will make again.

I'm sure these are just as good the way the recipe it written, but I wanted to decrease the sugar a bit and "healthy" these up some more. So I used the whole box of my graham cracker crumbs instead of 2.5 cups... making it was closer to 4 cups, decreased the powdered sugar to 1 and 1/2 cups, and added extra peanut butter (I just eyeballed it and went by taste.) It was not quite gooey enough to hold together so I added a bit of corn syrup, which "stickied it right up." I also changed the chocolate topping a bit after hearing what the other reviewers said. I used half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate chips, and melted them in the microwave with 3 Tablespoons of butter. Stirred and added 1/4 cup of half and half. Anyway, even with all my changes it turned out great, and I felt better that my kids got a little less sugar and a little more wholegrain. Also the parchment idea from another reviewer worked like a dream!

My mom always made these during the holidays for a treat and they were always a favorite. I had to look this recipe up as a refresher for how to make them, but one thing we always did differently is use half semi-sweet and half butterscotch chips for the topping.  It is sooo yummy, give it a try!

Very easy to make if you have a food processor.  The whole thing came together in under 10 minutes.  Delicious!  Very, very rich!

This was good, but it requires way too much margarine.  It holds together much better when you use half the amount.

I have made these luscious cookies for years.  They are always in demand by my husband's tennis teams--both boys and girls! Any cookie recipe that requires only a pan, a food processor, and two bowls for the microwave is a keeper.

I am VERY picky when it comes to recipes. This one is great! Here are a few tips to save on fat/calories for days when you don't want to feel like a total glutton: I used reduced fat peanut butter, cut the butter to about 2/3 of what the recipe calls for (and for half of the butter, I substituted with margarine), and cut the confectioner's sugar to 3/4 of what the recipe calls for. The bars really don't taste any different. They are still sweet and chocolatey and sooooo peanut buttery!

I didn't have a lot of faith in this recipe as I was making it. The peanut butter mixture was real moist and I didn't think it would harden at all! But I made it and stuck it in the fridge and left it overnight. I woke up the next morning and it all had hardened. I cut them into bars and b/c I waited so long to cut them, the chocolate broke into pieces for a few of them, but tasted great anyway. I've even gave the recipe to a few friends :) I'll definitely make these again.

Just like the Chocolate Peanut Butter Balls we always make at Christmas...without the time consuming rolling and dipping. Now I can have my favorite year round. Not sure if that's a good thing or not. : )

These are really good and easy to make! I did find them a bit too sweet though, I think cutting back a little on the sugar may improve the taste, (not that it really needs improving since these were so good). It's really a great quick and easy treat to make.

This recipe is amazing!! It is sooo easy and quick.  I think I made it in 15 minutes.  These bars taste just like Crispy Crunch chocolate bars (I'm from Canada).  If you need to bake something really fast, these are perfect and you will be praised as a baking goddess!!

I'm not surprised this Reese-like bar has made it into the Top Ten list.  I've been making these for a dozen years, and they're ALWAYS a hit.  In February, I add a little cinnamon heart to the top of each square, and it's a terrific combination of flavors!  Enjoy!

They are good -- super rich. They cut easily into perfect squares of any size so they're good for bringing to bake sales or pot locks. If you know anybody who is a serious Reese Cup addict (my husband is one) then these will be an instant hit. They took a long time to disappear in our house (about 3 or 4 days, which is long for sweets in our house) because you only need a tiny slice. It's like eating a 9x13 sized Reese cup. It takes time people! ;)

Tastes like peanut butter cups!
The only change I made was to add a little peanut butter (maybe 2 tbsp) to the chocolate chips while they were melting.
Very rich.  My family loves them!

These are very good. I added 1/2 cup of peanut butter to the melted chocolate like the one poster suggested. I did add more peanut butter to the filling than the recipe called for.

Ok, so I completely forgot the sugar in the recipe.  I cut the amount of butter to half.  Added a tbsp of butter and peanut butter to the chocolate while it melted.  I can imagine that the recipe must be too sweet, because I thought it was great without the sugar!  I'll be making this again (because I am a sucker for peanut butter and chocolate) but I'll be definitely cutting down on the sugar.  My guess is that 1 to 1 3/4 cups is way more than enough...

These are amazing!!!! Apart from the HUGE amount of butter, I'd eat them all day! Definitely one of my favorite recipes on Allrecipes. I had cut the recipe in half, added a little vanilla, and added sprinkles on top. (I used chunky pb.)

Mmm! These are better than peanut butter cups! So yummy and gewy! Insted of using chocolate chips though, I tend to make my own chocolate using the recipe on the Hershy's Cocoa Powder box. Add a little milk and these are just like the store-bought kind! Only cheaper! 

I also added dabs of water into the graham cracker/peanut butter mixture so that it would stick together more. Worked perfectly and good even out of the fridge for more than a couple of minutes!

This recipe was easy, quick and delicious! My huband loves marshmellow, so I melted some marshmellow fluff in the microwave to make it easier to spread and spread a layer on top of the peanut butter mixture before adding the chocolate. Turned out awesome! I melted the chocolate in the microwave and it seized up but just added some hot water and it worked great.

Very, very good, and so easy to make.  I added more peanut butter and used 1/2 milk chocolate and 1/2 semi-sweet chips, after reading the comments of others.  My family and friends loved these!!

Delicious! I will be making these again. Would like to try some kind of milk chocolate, I think they would be even better. The only problem is that the bottom half crumbles and they fall apart when I try to take them out of the pan.

This was sooooo easy and quick and the family loved it! I have to tell you though that I was out of (and frankly we don't often have) graham crackers and substituted crushed animal crackers (I had a huge box of them) and they came out great. I don't care for graham crackers and may try it with vanilla wafers next time! Yum!

Excellent!   My family loves this recipe!  I usually add 2 tablespoons of peanut butter to the chocolate chips when melting.

Not sure what I did wrong, I followed the recipe exactly. I chilled & cut before the chocolate hardened & then chilled again. They completely fell apart when I tried to get them out of the pan, & tasted really dry. And the chocolate still separated from the peanut butter. Disappointed...

One of my favorites for years.  To get nice, clean edges to your bars, run a thin knife under hot water for each cut.  My recipe calls for margarine instead of butter, 1 & 3/4 cups of graham cracker crumbs and 2 & 1/2 cups powdered sugar.  I cut them in 1" squares because they're like candy (that way you can have more than just one!).

This recipe was ok, though I would not make it again. If you are going to make this, I recomend not using semisweet chocalate chips because they do not pair well with the peanutbutter and is to strong of a taste. Also, use less grahm crackers and more peauntubutter for a smoother texture.

What a delicious way to satisfy a chocolate/peanut butter craving! Next time I will add a little less sugar because it was a bit too sweet and could have used a little more moisture. The bars definitely taste best at refrigerator temperature.

These were amazing! Possibly my favorite dessert I've made in a long time.

Since I only had one cup of chocolate chips leftover, I decided to add about 2 Tbsp of cocoa powder and 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the mix. And Lisa R's suggestion about the peanut butter to the chocolate chips was a fantastic idea! it made it so much easier to cut into and added lots more flavor! I will be making these over and over again!

Sooooo good. Brought these to a BBQ and they were the first one out of a table full of desserts to dissapear. Wish I had made a double batch! Cut down the butter by about 1/4 and they turned out perfect! Will be making wayyyy more often! So easy too!

I tried to make this as written, but couldn't add all the powdered sugar - the crumb mixture was way too dry. Next time I will use less crumbs or more peanut butter (melt it a little in the microwave!). It tasted fine. Also, leave them in the refrigerator for more like 10 minutes before slicing. After 5 minutes my chocolate was still a little melty and made my first few cuts a big ol' mess. So I put them back in for about 5 minutes more, then they were super easy to cut.

These are so good! I used Kraft no added sugar or salt peanut butter and they taste like homemade peanut butter cups. I followed two suggestions from other reviews and added 1/2 cup peanut butter to the melted chocolate and I lined my pan with parchment paper and just pulled the whole thing out and cut them up. I stored them in the freezer and they keep really well and taste great frozen.

This was such an easy recipe! I've made it several times already for a bridal shower, for work, and for a family gathering, the kids love these, they go so fast. Each time I make this I cut the squares smaller and smaller. Best modifications is to cut the sugar down to just 2 cups and to cut these when they are just semi firm (otherwise the chocolate cracks and its very messy). Once cut, pop them in the freezer to quickly set, yum!

For my second batch of these, I didn't have enough cookie crumbs, so I used 1 cup cookie crumbs, 1/2 dessicated coconut and only 1/2 cup margarine... And they were SO much better than my first batch! I reccommend substituting a portion of the cookie crumbs for dessicated coconut, as it makes the bar alot more moist without making it gooey or wet.. And you can't even taste the coconut

Just halved this recipe to fit in a 9x9 pan, can we say yummos?  Didn't alter the recipe.  I think could get away with just 3/4 conf sugar...  Nonetheless, this is easy and delish.

Love these!  Couldn't be more simple, kids gobbled them right up.  I've made with semi-sweet chips and milk chocolate chips, both are great.  I line a 9x13" pan with wax paper, score the peanut butter layer to help the choc layer adhere, add a heaping tablespoon of peanut butter to the melted chocolate which keeps the choc from breaking while cutting, freeze for 15 mins, then cut into 1" bars, then into the fridge.  Perfect, easy and delicious.

Rated 4 stars because as written it would have been WAY too sweet. I used only 1 cup of sugar and it was the perfect amount of sweetness for my family. Also slightly increased peanut butter and slightly decreased butter. Had to use crushed digestive cookies (the Canadians will know what those are, for the Americans, they are kind of like Nilla Wafers but thinner, less sweet, and made with whole wheat flour and oats) because that is what I had on hand. They were a great substitute. Very good recipe. Will make again.

These were delicious but the chocolate cracked when I tried to cut it. The second time I made them I added 3 Tablespoons of shortening to the chocolate before melting it and it kept the chocolate smooth and soft enough to cut.

These were just "ok".  I thought I would like the higher ratio of grahams to everything else to save on calories.  These were pretty crumbly and could have used more peanut butter and butter both.  If you are going to eat these you midaswell go for the gusto with more of the good stuff.

Oh man these are good!  I only had one sleeve of grahams, so I crushed up some rice crispies for the balance, and it worked great.  Use a 9x11 pan to thicken these up a bit.  Trust me, you won't be eating huge pieces anyway.  Pretty, and the whole family ate them up.

There just isn't much to say... these are amazing.  Super simple and yummy!  Thank you for sharing this!  I did add a Tbs of peanut butter to the chocolate as someone suggested and my chocolate had a very nice smooth texture to it.  None left after church!

Amazing, I added extra sugar and omitted about 1/2 of the crumbs.
I added about 1 1/2 cups peanut butter to the chocolate to keep it from getting hard.

The second time I made it I added lowfat margarine instead of peanut butter to keep it from getting hard, and the chocolate got really crumbly and gross. Its because it is lowfat... if you add butter... add full fat butter!

I made this for snacks to take to church and it was a huge hit.  In fact, I went by the grocery store and picked up the items to make another batch for home.  Scrumptious!

These are great.  Everyone who tries them wants the recipe.  I love that they taste like processed peanut butter cups, except I can make them with organic ingredients and feel good about eating and sharing them.

I thought this recipe was excellent. I also put parchment paper in the dish before adding the first layer. So, when it came time to cut the bars, I lifted the bars out by the paper and then cut them. I think this made cutting them really easy.

Really easy and quite rich and delicious. 

2.5 cups of graham crackers = 15 whole graham crackers. I added a scoop of peanut butter to the melted chocolate before I spread it on top, to soften it up a bit, and it cut nicely.

These are even better the next day once they have sat in the refrigerator overnight.

These are excellent.  They are super quick and simple to make and they taste delicious.  I made these for company and they loved them so much I had to make a second batch later in the week.  They just kept asking "Do you have any more of those Peanut Butter Bars?".  Be sure to follow the instructions given and cut them after setting for five minutes.  Otherwise, they are very difficult to cut.

Really yummy! I made a half batch in an 8 x 8 pan and cut into 1 inch pieces, I got 49. I cut the butter to 5T and the sugar to 1C - remember this is for a half batch. They are a bit crumbly and must be refrigerated. I used semisweet Nestle chips.

truly the best. simple and easy to make. on some of the bars I pressed a MINI pretzel into the chocolate while the chocolate was still warm (right after spreading). Makes for a pretty decoration and adds a salty bit to the sweet.

A friend is a total Reese's devotee, so for her birthday I made a batch of these, put them in a pretty tin and mailed it off.  Several days later, I received a phone call; my friend was practically giddy with delight!  So these are a keeper.:)

I made these bars the other day and I was very pleased with the end result.  They are super quick to throw together last minute and they taste really good too.  I did cut the recipe in half with great results.  The only things worth mentioning is that I felt there were too much graham crumbs for our liking, so I will reduce it to 1 cup (or 2 cups if making the whole batch).  I also reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup (again, 2 cups if making the whole batch).  Next time, I will probably increase the amount of chocolate chips used because 1/2 cup was just barely enough to cover the bars.  I let them rest in my fridge for about 15 minutes, and then cut them and that worked great.  Thanks for a good and super quick recipe.

This recipe is YUMMY!!!  They were so quick and easy to make!  The only change I made was to use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and melted them with just a teaspoon of shortening.  Also, I used just one 11.5 oz bag of chocolate chips, which is a little less than 2 cups, but it covered the bars perfectly.  They were so good I had to bring some to work so I wouldn't sit home and eat them all!

Great recipe - I followed it exactly except that I halved it.  

Some reviewers have said it would taste better with milk chocolate, but the peanut butter part is so sweet itself that I think it might be overkill!

I cut into very small pieces, each basically the size of a little candy (I probably had close to 40 or 50 with half the recipe).

Thought these were great and my company loved them too. I took the other reviewer's suggestions and used milk chocolate chips and less sugar. Also, didn't have any problem with cutting them (chocolate crumbling) because I added a little shortening when melting the choc chips.

This recipe was great! However I made many changes to make it healthier...instead of the full 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs, i made it with 2/3 of a cup of graham cracker crumbs, 2/3 of wheat germ and 2/3 of wheat bran. I cut down the sugar to 1.3 cups, and I upped the peanut butter to 1.5 cups to make them more creamy and make up for the sugar cut. and added a bit of peanut butter to the chocolate. Delicious! Will definitly make again! My brother didnt even notice the changes!

My husband and kids love these.  I cut these into squares before refridgerating, then I don't have to worry about the chocolate breaking.  I used 1/2 peanut butter and 1/2 semi sweet chocolate.  I am making these to bring to a school function as well.  If you use milk chocolate make sure to add butter (we didn't and had to start over..a smoky mess!).  I will definately try a healthier version submitted earlier, but I like the reg. recipe just fine.

This recipe is undoubtedly a family favorite. I like to do things a bit differently.  Instead of adding the peanut butter to the crust, I melt the chocolate and peanut butter together, and use only cracker butter and powdered sugar for the crust.  I put 2 1/2 cups crackers 3 1/2 cups powdered sugar, mix that together until evenly mixed, then i add 1 cup butter.  I Press the crust down and pour the melted chocolate/peanut butter mix over the crust.

These are awesome! Quick and easily made. I followed the recipe to the tee. I even cut them into heart shapes for my boyfriend for V-day after the 5 mins. of chilling. I then had to re-cut them once completely chilled to pop them out. Either way it worked and come out great! Don't change a thing here.

Made these for the first time today. If anyone has ever made peanut butter balls, imagine them in bar form, and that's what you'll get with these. Very Delicious

These are excellent and oh so easy!  My guests loved these at card club.  The only negative thing I have to say is that the grainy texture of the graham crackers isn't my favorite, but tasty nonetheless~

These bars are incredible! I've been making them routinely for almost a year! My family hates me everytime I make them (because u can't eat just one!) but they hate me if I don't make them! I follow the recipe pretty much exactly, but always end up adding a little bit more of this or that. After spreading the choclate over it (I only use about 1-1 1/2c of milk choc chips), I put it in the fridge for 20 mins, then cut. After about an hour more, they'll come out of the pan fine and then I trasnfer them to the freezer.

Fantastic!  I assembled these for my coworkers and they all really loved them.  They just had to know what made the crunch in the peanut butter; nobody guessed graham cracker crumbs.  These are great served cold with coffee - like a Butterfinger candy bar.  Thank you for the great recipe!

My husband use to love these when they made them in elementary school (not anymore due to the nutritional value).  I found this recipe and surprised him with it.  He loves it, kids love it and so do I.  Very good.

These are very easy to make and to adapt if you lack/need to substitute ingredients. I live in a dorm but had left over ingredients from making cupcakes at a friend's house a few weeks ago that I needed to use, so this was great. I used broken up cereal instead of graham crackers (which is what I had and really prefer for the crunch and a lightness factor) and did all necessary melting in the microwave. I used less sugar, because peanut butter (which I upped by half) is already very sweet, and I probably could have cut the amount of butter, too. Overall, though, the fact that you can adjust the recipe so easily is one of the reasons it's good. These will probably go quick!

it was too sweet and looks and tastes like ordinary chocolate and peanut butter candy from a store but if that is the point then i'm not impressed.  thanks for sharing anyway.

These were very good.  And very easy.  Like the no baking factor!  I used crunchy peanut butter, margarine instead of butter, and milk chocolate chips (more than called for).  Came out very nice.

Huge hit.  I like these since they are just like buckeye candy but even easier to make.  My family wants me to use milk chocolate chips next time instead of semi-sweet though.  They said there was a slight bitter edge to the flavor.

These were a total home run after I added 1 C. of rice crispy cereal and 1/3 C. corn syrup to the peanut butter mixture. I also sprinkled the top with chopped peanuts.

I'm trying to keep my sugar down but needed a fix. I used only 1.5 sticks of butter ( I tried 1 but it was to dry) and a big spoonful of extra peanut butter. I also only put in 1.5 cups of sugar and only about 3/4 of a bag of dark chocolate. Although it was enough to cover, I'd prefer more chocolate. It also was very peanut buttery and not too rich. I would consider this a lighter version. I'm thinking I should have made it richer so I eat less, but good none the less. Mixing the peanut butter with the butter first is a must do!

My daughter loves these as much as those name-brand peanut butter cups. I drastically cut the amount of sugar called for to just over a cup and add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the crust mixture, and they taste great.

I followed the recipe according, but the bar was very crumbly. The chocolate made it hard to cut. However, the taste was great!!

Made these today, loved them.  Not being a baker, these were very easy to make and a crowd pleaser.  Whoever said she threw them out obviously does not like Reeses Peanut Butter Cups.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! Made these today and we love them. I thought they tasted like a Reese's peanut butter cup but my husband said it tasted like a Butterfinger. Very easy to make and would not change a thing!

Very good! My boyfriend mmm's and closes his eyes while eating these! The only changes I made is I used 2 cups oatmeal instead or graham crackers and reduced the amount of sugar by 3/4 cups. I thought I would make these in muffin tins so that they would be nicely shaped, but I would not suggest doing this because they were extremely hard to get out of each individual muffin cup. They did look very presentable though, especially after the chocolate was added on top afterwards. I will make these again in a pan, making sure to not cool them completely before portioning so that I can get a knife through the chocolate.

I can see this being a great recipe if made properly. I made it for the first time tonight and didn't crumble the graham crackers enough so the base turned out chunky which isn't that great. I rather have a smooth base. The only thing I'd do differently is add a little more peanut butter and reduce the sugar to 1.5 cups of sugar.

Ok, so these as written were not so great.  I am rating this way on the recipe as is.  It can be a lot better with the suggestions of other reviewers as far as the chocolate topping being better and not crumbling off.  If you follow the directions as is, the topping breaks off and tastes gross.  You definitely need to use a milk chocolate or at least a mix of the two and also follow the suggestions of others on how to get them out of the pan without breaking.  Will make again with a lot of the suggestions from others.

It was a hit with everyone, and very easy and quick.  I thought it was good, just nothing that particularly stood out.  I took the suggestion of adding a little shortening to the chocolate chips, and had no problems cutting them.  Next time I will add a bit of almond extract to the graham cracker layer.

I made this recipe just like it says and let them set and chill 5 minutes before slicing, then put them back in the fridge until completely set. The next time I make them going to use cupcake baking cups and a muffin tin place chocolate in the bottom of cupcake baking cups set it in the fridge until it's set so the peanut butter layer will not push the chocolate out, then peanut butter then chocolate on top have my own name brand peanut butter cup for taking in my cooler to work or for having as a finger dessert plus then there will be no slicing to have to take the chance of the chocolate breaking. A very good recipe will make again and again.

Super quick and easy! Tasted better than I had expected...to the point where sharing is a MUST! (As difficult as it will be to part with these babies~ I don't trust myself with the whole batch!) I adjusted as recommended to only 2 cups sugar, used milk chocolate instead of semi sweet, and added 1 tbsp peanut butter to the chocolate chips before melting. Sprinkled a little bit of chopped pecans on top before chilling too. Lining the pan (I used an 8x8) with waxed paper, and cutting with a pizza cutter made the bars a breeze to divide. My peanut butter loving husband and teenage boys are thrilled to have this added to our growing list of favorites.

This is a great recipe but like the others I reduced the powdered sugar to only 2 cups and since I didn't want to use up the last of our graham crackers I used only 1.5 cups of graham cracker crumbs and 1 cup of wheat flour.  I also only put in 3/4 cup of peanut butter.  It still tasted delicious and nobody knew I put in the wheat flour!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because I should have made it as stated.  Instead I followed some reviews that I wish I hadn't.  I decreased the butter to less than 3/4 cup and I increased the chocolate chips to 3 cups.  The base ended up a little dry and crumbly and the chocolate layer was too too too chocolatey.  That's alot coming from me - a confirmed chocoholic.  The chocolate layer was just too overpowering.  I will make these again & include between 3/4 and 1 cup butter & stick with 2 cups of chocolate chips.

So rich and peanutty!  Great little treat.  I made half the recipe in my silicone pan, and it popped out after 15 min in the freezer.  I added a tsp of butter and peanut butter when I was double boiling the milk chocolate, and it didn't crack.  Thanks for sharing!

All I can say is WOW! Excellent recipe as is. I did use milk chocolate in place of semi sweet morsels. Plus I only used a cup of confectioner's sugar and they came out great! Also, I used organic peanut butter to cut down on the sugar content. Still rocked!

Tasted just like a Reese's PB cup.  It took a couple of weeks to get to my husband who was deployed.  I wrapped them individually in plastic and mailed them.  He said that they were just the right amount of dry and moist and tasted just like a PB cup when he got them on the ship.  He absolutely loved these bars!!

These are GREAT!!! They taste just like Reese's PB cups!  My brother, sister, and mom loved them! Like some others suggested, I used Milk Chocolate chips and reduced the sugar to a little less than 2 cups (I ran out). I love sweets and I ended up having to cut my 2 inch square pieces in half. Will make these again!

Very sinful and delicious, even better than Reese's in my opinion. I have made these once so far and am afraid to make them again because I can't resist making a pig of myself with them! I sent some to work with my fiancee and the guys were fighting over who could have the last piece.

My roommates loved this dessert. Make sure to add the right ratio to the "crust". Otherwise, it is at risk of crumbling. Also, I'd make these ahead of time, refrigerate them for a night and then serve them the next day. This way the consistency and texture will be firmer. Oh, and I did use milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips.

these were a huge hit at christmas, just a bit too sweet for me.  The second time I made them I pressed them out in a jelly roll pan and cut them into small bite size squares.  YUM!  Also, my kids liked the milk chocolate chips better than bittersweet.

Yummy, yummy!  These are much better then Reece's cups. I had to make 3 more batches yesterday. I served them at different Christmas parties.  Husbands, who normally do not like "Christmas candy" wanted more of these.  One of them drove 45 miles to pick them up.  Using the parchment paper as a pan liner was a brilliant suggestion from one of the reviews. Also I did add 1/2 c. of crunchy peanut butter to the chocolate.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and also milk chocolate chips.  Both were yummy! Thanks for sharing a fabulous recipe!

I made these for my company party and they were a hit! Soooo Easy! The box of graham crackers is about 3cups... I used them up and added a tad of extra butter to compensate for the extra graham crackers- FANTASTIC!!!!!

Love these with real unadulterated peanut butter.  If you want to measure - 1 cup of peanut butter weighs 8.75 oz or 245 g.

I just made a batch of these, my husband claims they are fantastic and better than Reeses, and says it reminds him of his mother's beloved fudge (the powdered sugar gave him that familiar taste). I do not have a 13x9 inch pan, so used a 10" springform pan with wax paper lining to make these. They came out nice and thick, like the picture.  I mixed some peanut butter and margarine with the chocolate chips, probably about a heaping TBS of each, to make the consistency creamier for spreading. I used Country Crock churn style and it tastes fine. Freeze the pan for 20 mins before cutting the bars and they will cut easy. This is definitely well worth trying and a 'KEEPER'.  Enjoy everyone!

Yumm!  My kids LOVED this.  I did add a generous spoonful of peanut butter to the melted chocolate chips to keep the topping a bit creamier and prevent cracking.  We have already made this 4 times - Love it!

Next time I make this recipe I will add a bit more peanut butter. I would also recommend using a mixer to mix the dry and 'wet' ingredients together. The ingredients didn't mix as well as I had hoped and I think using a mixer and slowly combining the ingredients would help. It kept well and was excellent!

OUTSTANDING!!!  2 cups of powdered sugar and 1 2/3 cup of butter is enough, no need for the extra calories or sweetness! Brought to a party and everyone raved out them!  thanks for sharing Justine!

Thanks to the all recipes for posting this as the Recipe of the Day over the weekend.  I made these bars for dessert yesterday.  Delicious and decadent.  I didn't have graham crackers crumbs so I used Digestive biscuits which might not have produced the best texture for the base but took nothing away from the taste.  I will buy graham cracker crumbs just for this recipe.  I added peanut butter and a bit of butter to the chocolate while melting so that the chocolate wouldn't break up when cutting into squares. I have to still work on the right amount as the chocolate was still a tad hard.  And I did as others suggested, used parchment paper to cover the cookie sheet - easy to lift out to cut up.  Very easy, very quick.  Will make many times.

These turned out SO good!!!  I didn't have graham crackers, though, so I used ground up oatmeal, which worked really well, tastes like a Reese's cup!

If you add BC supreme brownies to the bottom of these bars, it is simply divine.  I am a huge choco lover and I will also double the choco chips to make the ganache even thicker.

These were very easy to make and very tasty. They basically taste like a Reeses peanut butter cup, but the crust part was a little too grainy. I would make this again.

I used yogurt butter to help cut back on calories and fat a little, although if you're trying to watch your weight, making these is not the best choice. They turned out great and everyone loved them!

This is the BEST! I needed something fast and easy to make for my husband's Holiday dinner. He's a firefighter and works with nothing but guys. So I needed something you know simple. I originally was going to make enchilada's and save this recipe for his dad's christmas dinner but I changed my mind the last minute. These are delicious!

These are very good and easy to make. I didn't quite have the complete measurement of powdered sugar, but that didn't seem to matter. I probably used about 1 1/2 Cups or 1/2 a box. Hubby thinks they are a real winner and he's normally "Just make chocolate chip cookies" kinda guy.

These were awesome!  My husband could not stop talking about them.  We had friends over and they could not stop talking about them.  I sent some home with one of the guys and I am sure I will get an email for the recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It is a keeper.

I thought these were ok, but my friends loved them.  I should have let them warm up a bit before cutting - tried cutting right out of the fridge to bring to a friend's house and they were tough to cut into nice, neat squares and some  crumbled.  Flavor was pretty good, but I've had others that I liked better - just have to find the right recipe.

Wow!  Really good.  I didn't care for the semi-sweet chips, so I'm going to use milk chocolate next time!!  More of a candy instead of bars.

Used only 1 1/2 cup sugar but still sweet for me. Next time, need to use at least castor sugar, since normal table granulated sugar is too big.

This recipe was so easy to make and it wash the HIT of the party! That was a first for me since baking is new to me. This recipe is perfect for any party, kid-friendly or adults only. I did not change a thing and I never would! It's a delight! I will make it for years to come!

This was so easy to make.  Tastes a lot like butterfinger!  I wound up adding extra chocolate because the 1st layer looked too thin but I think it would have been fine with the amount of chocolate the recipe calls for.  PERFECT once it got to room temp!

Easy and so yummy.  My son and daughter (3 and 18 months) passed up EVERYTHING at the dessert table at a potluck and just kept pointing and begging for these (they'd gotten a little one before we left home)  Cut into about 1 inch squares since they are rich and sweet.  SO yummy - lots of compliments, and they looked beautiful!

Very simple recipe to make, for the most part, did have a little difficulty getting sugar, PB, and Graham crackers to mix well but over all very good, made these for a birthday party at work ,and got rave reviews!! Thanks so much for sharing.

I made this recipe for a party.  I just happened to have all the ingredients on hand and it was very easy to make. I melted the butter in the microwave and the chocolate chips how much easier can that get.  The guests loved them so much and the children. They weren't to sweet either.  The next time I make them I'm going to use parchment paper in the dish like the other readers suggested it would make it much easier to cut them into pieces. Thank you

Very good. Not as good as the Reese's mix you can buy at the store though. I think I will use less graham crackers next time.

Great. More like a candy and less like a bar cookie.  We love reeses peanut butter cups and they taste very close without cooking. Simple and easy.

This is YUM! BUT double the ingredients for the crust bacause the crust is too thin and the chocolate topping over powers it. But it tastes awesome!

Tasty, but still not what I remember from elementary school. These were a total sugar slam! Tasty but WAY too sweet for me. Thanks for the treat!

I really liked this recipe.  The only change is that next time I will decrease the graham cracker crumbs and increase the peanut butter to get more of a creamy texture on the bottom.  Still very good!

This is exactly the recipe that I remember from my childhood.  I'm so glad I found it.  A little sweeter than I remember but - oh so good! Will be making these for the holidays.  Maybe they'd be good cut into squares and then dipped into chocolate - like a candy. Hmmm.

I made these with my mother for her Bake Sale benefitting the Cancer Society.  We made 4 batches and put out a few small pieces for samples.  We sold out of them VERY quickly and had people asking for more.  Dad can't wait until we make another batch just to eat at home.  As Mom says "This is a Keeper".

Very yum!  These disappear fast :)
I would recommend not grinding the graham crackers very finely.  I left some crackers bigger than most and it gave a nice crunch.

This was a perfect substitute for Reese peanut butter cups.  I loved them!  They're vey sweet and high in fat, though.  The recipe makes a lot for a family of four, so maybe next time I will modify it to make it lower in fat.  Because I did not want the chocolate to get too hard, I did add a tsp. of peanut oil to the chocolate topping.  Next time I will probably lessen the sugar and butter.  These were really SWEET, so I think I could lose a little sweetness while keeping the taste.  A real keeper!!

These are great and taste a lot like peanut butter cups.  The people at work wanted more.  Tried milk chocolate chips for the frosting and liked that even better.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I would give more stars if I could!  Everytime I bring these somewhere, they are GONE!  If you like chocolate and peanut butter, you HAVE to try this recipe.  Cut these squares into small servings though, they are very rich, but to die for good!!  You HAVE to make these!

The only reason I'm giving these 4 stars and not five is because I melted the chocolate over a low heat in a small pot on top of the stove and the chocolate was thick and pasty, not liquidy like I would have thought it should have been, but anyway the peanut butter mixture was delicious, and I did my best to spread the thick pasty chocolate over it, and they were quite tasty and my guests did like them, but next time when I properly melt the chocolate, they'll earn five stars, and yes, there will be a next time.

Delicious!  I made these for a quick dessert and I am so glad!  They go together quickly and are great!  My brother kept coming back for more.  It makes a lot but you need them once people realize they taste just like Reese's PB cups.

This are very rich, but very tasty.  I had to wait about 15 minutes before they were hard enough to start cutting into.   Then after being in the fridge for a few more minutes, they were pretty much ready to serve except that they melted in your hands easily.  I would suggest making them the night before you wanted to use them because that would give them plenty of time to set in the fridge.

Fabulous and relatively easy to make.  A big hit as well.  Tastes just like Reese's peanut butter cups.  I did use 1/2 milk chocolate and half semi-chocolate, but that's just a personal preference.

The peanut butter filling was absolutely delicious.  I think I seized the chocolate in the microwave while melting, but that would be my fault.  They still turned out pretty good.  I also used semi-sweet chocolate chips but next time I'll go for the milk chocolate.

This recipe is awesome! Talk about easy to make and my family loved them. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chips. I also added a layer of melted peanut butter chips on top of the melted chocolate and used the tip of a knife to swirl them together. Next time I make these, I think I'll try using chunky peanut butter. Thanks for the great recipe Justine.

These were fantastic and so EASY! My husband raved about them, and he usually doesn't even like sweets. He said more than once that they were even better than peanut butter cup candy. Definitely a hit and a recipe I will make again. Thanks!

Great square, easy, fast and wonderful.  Taste just like
the "peanutbutter cups" chocolate bar.  It slices up 
perfect and is firm enough to hold it shape.

Wow! These bar cookies are so good!  After I finished baking them, I placed the pan in the fridge for about 1 hr to harden and then I could cut into squares easier. This is definitely a keeper and so easy!! Highly recommended!

These were so yummy and so easy to make!!  I used the store bought graham cracker crumbs, and they came out absolutely perfect!  Can't wait to make them again - we sold out at a bake sale and EVERYONE asked for the recipe.  Thanks for the recipe, Justine - I think it's my new favorite!!  :o)

I found this recipe very easy to make and the guests at my friends graduation ate almost the whole batch.  The crunchy peanut butter layer was great!

These turned out a bit dry when I made them, but I may not have measured the ingredients carefully enough.  I will try them again next holiday season.

I made these as a gift for my sister in law who LOVES PB and Choc and they were gone before she left Christmas Day. Excellent! Thanks.

These are wonderful.  They are very easy to make and they dissappear very quickly.

These were OK.  I let them sit out after chilling so the chocolate wasn't so hard to bite through.  Probably wouldn't make again.

these were so good!  i never would have made them on my own, but i wanted to make something special for my grandmother who loves peanut butter.  she hasn't tried them yet (have to mail them tomorrow), but at the rate they're going, she might not get any!

The little voices in my head told me to make these. I'm glad I listened this time. Sometimes the little voices tell me to do other, bad things. But these were far from bad; they were outstanding, and my fellow cult members gobbled them mindlessly! Thanks!
