I added a few variations to the recipe.  I would take out the oven at 130 degrees to maintain that pink in the middle and let the juices settle into the meat for 20-30 minutes.

I had to leave the pepper out of it and I added some basil. It was excellent. It took a little longer than I thought but it was time well spent.

This is a terrific recipe. First time I’ve made a standing rib roast so I thought I’d try a basic recipe. This worked out great. The only think was I had to cook at 325 for about 90 Minutes to get the meat done to medium to medium well.
