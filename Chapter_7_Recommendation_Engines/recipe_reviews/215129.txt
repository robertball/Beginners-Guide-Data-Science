I enjoyed this recipe, but it needs a little tweaking as I found the bread part bland. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, but will increase that next time and add some nutmeg. The texture was great though and I'll certainly make it again. Other changes I made: subbed pecans for walnuts, used water instead of soy milk and added some margarine to the topping mixture.

This bread was very dry and crumbly, and quite bland.  I did use regular milk and plain dairy yogurt rather than soy.  I will not bake this again.

Wasn't horrible but not to our taste. It might have been the plumsThey were off of our tree and it has been a dry year here in Kansas.

it was sort of dry...but that's probably my fault since i used whole wheat flour. i'll probably have to adjust the ingredients for my own preferences! but overall the recipe is great. the aroma is amazing as well!
