These pork chops are interesting.  I am not sure I cared for the combination of the marinade and the breading.  It just didn't mesh well in my opinion.

I wish I would have read the reviews before making these chops.  I agree- they were just way too salty.  The soy sauce overpowered the garlic and ginger, I couldn't taste them at all.  I will try again and cut the soy sauce in half, use pineapple or orange
juice, and more ginger.

you really do need to cut back on the soy sause. Maybe just 1/2 cup next time.  However, family still enjoyed it.

I added some rice wine vinegar to the marinade, because I was concerned with the reviews about how salty this would be - plus, I like how the acid in the vinegar tenderizes the meat.  I doubled the garlic because we are big garlic eaters.  I also skipped the breading when it was baked, based on some other reviews.  It was moist, tender, flavorful, and not 'too' salty (although it was salty indeed).  I would definitely recommend using low-sodium soy sauce in the future.

tasted great! i used a little more ginger than listed, threw in some sesame seeds and cut the soy sauce to about a 1/4 cup. when i took the chops out of the marinade, i coated them in sesame seeds only(no bread crumbs). i let it marinate all day, and then preheated all three grill flames for about 5 minutes, then turned off the middle and cooked the chops there, off heat(this way the seeds didnt burn, just toasted nicely), for about 15/20 minutes, flipping once. they came out nice and tender and juicy!

Marinated all day and was very moist!  I agree the soy was a bit salty tasting but served with mash potatoes and wasn't as noticable.  Overall very tasty though!  Hubby enjoyed...thanks!

Delicious - Marinated chops overnight, then coated with breadcrumbs and sesame seeds and baked in the oven - I didn't find it too salty at all using low sodium soy sauce.

I made so many changes to this recipe. Here they go: I used three thin cut pork chops, added 3 tbsp of soy sauce (tamari), 2 tbsp rice vinegar, 1/2 cup water, 2 tbsp fresh ginger minced, 5 garlic cloves and as much black pepper as you want.   Let them marinate for about 2 hours, then threw the marinade away and cooked the pork chops in the grill. They were perfect!   Make sure you use fresh ginger.

These were pretty good.  I marinated mine overnight and used low sodium soy sauce, otherwise they would be too salty.

I had this with chicken, without the breadcrumbs and with a bit of orange juice added to the marinade.  It tasted good, but both me and my bf thought the sesame seeds made it kinda of taste like a hamburger bun.  The marinade was nice though and will use that again.

The best pork chops i have ever had in my entire life. Prepare them before you go to work and eat them for supper. The longer they sit the better they taste!!!!!!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I was a little hesitant to try it because of the previous comments about saltiness.  I used the "lite" soy sauce.  I also added a splash of water and a splash of orange juice in an attempt to tone down the salt.  Whether that did it or not, I thought the chops turned out great!  One complaint -- you don't need a whole cup of bread crumbs.  Seemed wasteful to use that much.

These chops were very good on the grill.  I used 3/4 cup kikkoman lite soy sauce and marinated them for about 8 hours. The soy sauce does have a strong flavor and I think regular, full sodium soy sauce would have been too overwhelming.  If you don't like soy sauce, you probably won't like this recipe.  We, however, will be making them again!

The marinade was quick and easy to assemble.  The time allowed to marinade and the cooking time, however, require meal planning but it is well worth the wait.  The only suggestion I have is to forget the plastic bag and marinade in a flat shallow baking pan.  A glass Pyrex for example.  Then lessen the marinade time to about 20 minutes.  This is because the bread crumbs absorb the soy sauce and the salty flavor is overwhelming.  Other than that, it is a fabulous recipe!

I used low sodium soy sauce and much less of it than called for + more garlic but it was very good and my hubby loved it! I didnt have time to marinate so I made it more like a rub ( with the less soy sauce ) and it was still fabulous

Easy to make and yummy, but a little too salty for me.  Think that next time might cut the amount of soy sauce to 3/4 cup, and add 1/4 cup sake to balance the flavor.  I used panko (Japanese bread crumbs) and it worked out fine.

These were GREAT!  I added the sesame seeds to the marinade and omitted the breadcrumbs since we decided to grill them.  A good idea to cutback on the soy sauce.  We used 1/2 of what the recipe called for and they were still a bit salty.

Hi!   This is Carol...the person who submitted this recipe.  I've read over the reviews, and the one that keeps on popping up again and again is that it's too salty.  I use Kikkoman soy sauce, and haven't found it to be too salty myself... so I'm maybe thinking different brands are saltier than others.

These were delicious although I did have to substitute ground ginger and garlic powder from my spice rack for the "real thing". Even my 2 picky girls ate them!

As with others, we used only a quarter cup of low sodium soy sauce. We used minced ginger instead of slices. We marinated for about 5 hours and it turned out beautifully! Definite keeper!

Great recipe! I honestly tweaked it a bit. I used lite soy sauce, cause that's all I had lol, and I did about a quarter cup of soy  sauce and a third of a cup rice wine vinegar. I also threw in about a tablespoon of sugar and then, instead of using sesame seeds, I put in about a tablespoon of sesame seed oil as well. When I baked it, I had it in a Pyrex dish and after placing the chops in I went ahead and poured some of the marinade in. It smelled so good that I couldn't resist. Lol. The vinegar really broke down the pork so it wasn't so dry like pork usually is and it also allowed for the marinade to really soak in to the meat. Seriously so good and I haven't even served it yet. Lol. Just took bites from cutting it up.

These were pretty good. I think my pork chops were too thin; they got pretty dry. But the overall flavor was really good!

The family loved this, will definitely be making again!  Cut the soy sauce in half and added 1/2 cup of orange juice to marinade.  Added about a tsp of both rice wine vinegar and black pepper as well as 1/2 tsp sesame oil.

I made this recipe without using mustard powder, as we are not big mustard fans, and it was fabulous!

My boyfriend loved this dish, he said it tasted gourmet.  I halved the recipe, used lite soy sauce and ginger powder .  It was good, I agree that the recipe calls for too many breadcrumbs.  All in all I liked this recipe, it seems like a healthier one.

The flavor of the soy was a little too much for my liking, even though I used lite soy sauce. I imagine it would taste great to those who are really fond of it though.

A great recipe for anyone who truly enjoys garlic, soy and ginger.  I even used jarred ginger. Although the chops come out very moist, I would have preferred the coating not to be as moist as the meat.  Next time, I will do without the bread crumbs and I think it would be awesome on the grill.

A bit on the salty side - due to the soya sauce, I think - but a very nice recipe.  I just cut down a bit on the soya sauce, and used the "light" kind, and it's much better.  Very nice with rice and oriental veg.

This recipe is the best, but I didn't use the breadcrumbs...just the marinade.  I grilled the chops on an indoor grill and they moist and had wonderful taste.  I have passed this recipe on to all of my friends and family.

I didn't have enough soy sauce for a whole cup, so I used 1/4 cup of typical Kikkoman soy sauce, and 1/4 cup of generic "dark" soy sauce (which is generally less salty than the typical American stuff). I marinated the chops overnight, and they turned out just fine. Not too salty.

Not a bad recipe however, I found the chops quite salty.  A suggestion; maybe use sodium-reduced soy sauce instead of regular.  Other than that it was tasty!  Kim.
