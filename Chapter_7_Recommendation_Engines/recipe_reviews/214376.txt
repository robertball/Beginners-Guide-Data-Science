I would leave out the sugar.  Was good with it, but I think it would be better without.  Very nice way to serve mushrooms.  I used a Malbec wine and served it with a pot roast I cooked in the pressure cooker (no gravy).

Edit: I tried it again without the sugar and it was much better.  Next time I am going to try white wine which will make a nicer looking sauce - the red wine and the mustard make it muddy looking.

Yum! I skipped the brown sugar as others have mentioned, but otherwise I followed the recipe pretty closely. I did cut down on the butter though, and I sprinkled in a little parsley.

These mushrooms are great made like this. Two tips: if you'd like them more tangy leave out the brown sugar. Put half a teaspoon in for a balanced taste. To have them on the sweeter side, feel free to add more of the brown sugar. It is up to you and it's a matter of taste. To mine I add a teaspoon or less of the sugar and they have always been a hit. Then if you'd like to have your mushrooms softer, wait and add the sauce after they have become browner. If you'd like them firmer at the end, then add the sauce as they begin to brown but are still somewhat firm. Normally, I continue to cook them in the skillet over medium heat for another 10mins after adding the sauce. They are great as a side to chicken or pork.

A keeper, delicious!  I used 1 tbs. of brown sugar per other suggestions.  I used sherry cooking wine and whole grain mustard.  Served with a roast.

Yummo!  I made this tonight to put over sirlon steaks and it is delicious!  I love mushrooms and this is a great way to use them.  I followed the recipe exactly as far as ingredients, but I let it simmer for about 15-20 mins to reduce the strong flavor of the dijon mustard.

A great change from everyday mushrooms and onions.  The only change I made was to use 2 tbsp. of maple syrup instead of brown sugar with Merlot for the wine.  I used the sauce to de-glaze the pan and added the mushroom mixture back into it after the sauce had reduced a bit. Served them over grilled pork chops.

We liked this a lot. So much flavor, and very good the next day too. I served these mushrooms with steak.

The original recipe is definitely 5 star. It calls for 1/2 bell pepper (green) cut in 1 inch chunks in addition to the onions (regular yellow is fine) and mushrooms. Also, the cooking time after adding the sauce is more like 45 minutes. It cooks down to a lovely thick state, "nasty looking" according to the original, but absolutely wonderful on toasts at a party. Try using tamari as a sub for Worcestershire (as my friend who gave me this years ago advised.)

Delicious. I used 1 1/2 lbs of mushrooms and only 5T of butter. I might decrease the sugar next time, but it was wonderful with steak!

This is very sweet if you follow the recipe. I pored it over grilled turkey breasts. If i make it again I will use less sugar or even some local honey.

Wonderful; thank you.  The only wine I have in the house is Marsala, so that's what I used.  I simmered it all a few minutes until the sauce thickened up a bit.  We put it over steak & my husband said it was better than a restaurant.  Then we used the leftovers for mushroom swiss burgers.  Tell me a burger joint that puts Marsala wine in their mushroom sauce, ha!

Being of Czech, actually Bohemian, descent I grew up with mushrooms of all sorts. Pickled, sauted, dried, raw, deep fried puff balls, you name it, we ate it. Heck we even put them on ice cream! Just kidding. This recipe is great. Never did the brown sugar thing before, but love the sweetness. If it's too sweet cut it down or out. Whatever trips your palate. Enjoy!

OMG...Try this. Great on Chicken or Beef. I only had 2 boneless chicken breats and made the Mushrooms before starting. Just added a little brown sugar for my taste. I did a quick pound and egg dip with your choice of Flour/Spice coating. Just spoon the Mushroom/Sauce over the Chicken after browning on both sides for about 4 min. each side or  until golden brown. Adjust the recipe to the amout of protien being cooked. Very adaptable recipe. It's a go to when a change up with Mushrooms is wanted.

You know when you like a recipe but dont have any of the ingredients but you know that what you have will work. Yeah, well, I did that. Was still delish!! 
I used tamari sauce and a honey garlic sauce w a spot of mustard in it. and cooked it all down. Have used it on top of potatoes, pasta, eggs, meat. Will make again with anything!

So delicious! I didn’t even use all of the butter that the recipe called for and it was still super yummy. I used only about 1/4 cup of butter: using half of which in the beginning with a generous drizzle of safflower oil and then added the other half after the mushrooms shrunk down a bit. A+!

It is probably because I used a very honey mustard (Woeber's much more honey than most!) instead of the Dijon and half of the brown sugar, but my 'sauce' turns into well browned glazed mushrooms with a lot of greasy liquid that I just left in the pan...but the mushrooms sure were tasty with the pot roast! I was cooking the mushrooms separate without onions to cater to some conflicting taste preferences. Since I made a significant substitution, I can't really rate the original, but I thought there might be someone else with honey mustard who might need to know you don't have to throw it all away when the sauce breaks.

I made it but practically halved everything since it was just me & my son. We loved it. I actually made it with red wine vinegar and just a finger tip of brown sugar. It was best after they had rested for 5-10 mins. yum!!!

I'm giving this 4 stars because I changed the amounts of ingredients based on other reviews. But with those changes it was yummy! I used a white wine, more like 3tbsp butter, and 1/4c brown sugar. I also used red onion since that's what I had. hubby came in and said it smelled delicious, and really liked it! I think this gave the mushrooms a nice balance of savory with a little hint of sweet. I used a mix of mushrooms, but really any kind I think would do.  Served atop pan seared chicken and sauteed spinach for dinner.

I used baby Bella's and served this over baked potatoes. My teenage daughters loved it!  We're vegan and I'm always looking for news ways to serve veggies. I used a couple tablespoons of pure maple syrup in place of the brown sugar. Sweet, tangy, delicious!!

This recipe is excellent. It is a keeper. I unfortunately had to use Sherry as I had no red wine. However, the outcome was spectacular. I put it as a side for the Breaded Pork Chops posted in this website....EXCELLENT combination! I followed the recommendations of others who suggest to forgo the sugar. I do agree this recipe without it is perfect. Personally, I do not like to add sugar to plates that are not desserts or sweets. I am definitely doing this again. Now, at the moment I had to reduce the recipe for 2 people and noticed that there was a bit of extra sauce which my hubby wipped off from the plate with some crusty bread....

Great recipe. After reading the other reviews. I came up with these changes. I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar,1/2 stick of butter, 1Tablespoon of Dijon mustard &1 Tablespoon of harvest coarse ground mustard.Great favor. Not to sweet or to much butter. This is a keeper.

Rave reviews from our dinner guests!  I did reduce the sugar, though.

I meant to add that I usually triple the vegetables but only double the sauce to make more.  I cook over high heat until the sauce starts to thicken and then slowly decrease the heat and stir more frequently to keep it from sticking.  I find it takes a good long time for the thickening to start.
