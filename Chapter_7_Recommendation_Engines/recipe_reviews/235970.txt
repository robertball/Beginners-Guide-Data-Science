A delicious way to prepare a grilled cheese sandwich.  I only prepared two sandwiches rather than five.  The mixture of the tomatoes, onion, and cilantro worked nicely together, but I really enjoyed the twist of the lime.  I never butter a grilled cheese, but instead use a thin layer of mayonnaise.  This sandwich paired very nicely with a bowl of tomato soup.

I love Pico de Gallo - this one needed a little diced jalapeno or a serrano chili - if you are only using one tomato make it a big one or use several smaller tomatoes.  Instead of buttering the bread for grilled cheese I use a very thin layer of mayonnaise.  Thanks for a nice lunch.

I wasn't able to quite wrap my head around provolone with pico de gallo so I took it one step further and used pepper jack cheese and it turned out to be one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I have ever made. I also used mayo instead of butter on sourdough bread. This is a keeper folks.
