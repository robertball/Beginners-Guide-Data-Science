It's true. They came out like the KFC biscuits. If yours didn't, here are a few tips: 1. Be sure your self-rising flour is fresh. 2. Double the recipe and pat (not roll) dough out thick. 3. Place close together in baking pan so as they bake, they will touch sides and bake upwards instead of flattening out. My husband said to keep this recipe in our files! Thanks a bunch! Oops, but I should mention that I made these with butter instead of shortening. :)

I added 1 teaspoon of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to my regular all purpose flour, and these came out very nicely. They do taste very PLAIN, but they were *perfect* for biscuits and gravy, and I imagine they would be good with jam or honey as well.

This is a good basic bisquit recipe.  My favorite part of it was the idea to double the dough.  Instead of doubling it, I rolled mine thin and placed one one bisquit ontop of another.  This allowed them to pull apart nicely for butter and jelly.  I'll do this with all my bisquits from now on.

These biscuits were so easy and turned out just the way I wanted!  I've tried dozens of recipes and always end up with hard, dry biscuits.  These turned out light and fluffy and tasted great with country gravy or jam.  I didn't have the self-rising flour so I used regular flour and added about 1 tablespoon of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of salt.  These rose nicely and because of folding the dough over before cutting, they were easy to separate into halves for buttering after baking.  My oven runs a little warm, so I only needed to bake for about 15 minutes.  Yummy! Thanks, this recipe is a keeper!

These were okay.  Plain they were flavorless.  With butter and jam they were good.  If you don't have self rising flour, use all purpose flour and add 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda.  Next time I make these I will add butter to the dough for some more flavor.

These came out perfect!  The recipe is missing a couple of points.......cut the shortening into the flour first, then add the milk.  DON'T OVERWORK the dough!  2-3 gentle kneads is all you need, or your biscuits will be hockey pucks!  I did add a pinch of salt and a bit of sugar but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Mine rose up high, were light and flaky.  Perfect recipe to add chopped chives and crumbled bacon.  YUM!  Definately a keeper

This was a ver easy recipe, but like other reviews it was kinda bland. But along with the sausage and gravy recipe also from this site they were wonderful. I will prolly try to adjust it like others next time.

AWESOME!!!  TASTES LIKE THE BISCUITS FROM KFC.  TIPS:  COLD,CUBED BUTTER ALWAYS!!! ADDED TO THE FLOUR AND CUT  IN WITH A FORK UNTIL LITTLE PEE SIZE BALLS FORM, THEN SLOWLY ADD YOUR MILK.  NO HANDS! JUST UNTIL MOISTENED.  DUMP IT OUT ON THE WAX PAPER AND USE THE CORNERS TO FORM INTO A ROLL. PLACE IN FREEZER WHILE YOUR OVEN HEATS UP. THE JUST SLICE OFF YOU BISCUIT AND PLACE IN CAKE PAN SO THEY ARE SNUGGLED UP TOGETHER NICE AND TIGHT.  BAKE AND EAT IT! YUMMY!

Nice and light biscuits... I used saved bacon grease as shortening and it added a nice kind of salty flavor.  Very quick and easy.

I use this recipe every time I need to make biscuits and it's always a big hit.  Can also put them in a cupcake/muffin pan and use them as dinner rolls.

mercy, mercy.
i didn't think i could give 5 stars to a biscuit recipe without buttermilk, but this was (is, it is being devoured as i type) one good biscuit.

i used white lily self-rise, spectrum shortening (no transfats- i'd use half butter or natural transfat free margarine instead of butter flavored crisco, if i wanted that 'chicken place' flavor... the texture & size are certainly there.) 

added a tsp or so of sugar, as per recommendations. but it would be fine without. cut shortening in with pastry blender to pea size lumps, stirred milk in very gently, and baked for 18 minutes. 

it is a fairly wet dough, but easy enough to lightly handle with floured hands (though i was skeptical at first). i think the wet dough makes the more kfc type biscuit; for a cracker barrel type, more traditional biscuit, my dough is dryer & has buttermilk. i used a greased cast iron skillet to bake them. 

a great addition to my biscuit repertoire. thanks, brenda! (the kids are putting homemade apple butter on them right now- well worth it!)

I read the reviews that say these biscuits have not much flavour. Yet it's such an easy recipe that I simply had to try. So I made them with garlic powder, oregano, 1/2 tsp salt and grated Parmesan. Delicious. Then I tried with cinnamon powder and raisins. Wow, tasted fantastic with my morning coffee. These are so easy to make that you just can't go wrong. I've also made them with grated apples and cinnamon, chopped olives and rosemary, and sundried tomatoes and onion powder. The possibilities are endless. I'm still experimenting.  Once I didn't have enough butter. I only had about 100g. No problem. They turned out fluffy and good. As suggested by another reviewer, I always pat them out thinner and stack 2 together. They pull apart easily for buttering and look nice. Do use buttermilk/sour milk if you have them. You'll love the final product. This is so much easier and tastes just as good as any scones recipes I've tried. I whipped them up in less than 15 mins, bake them for 18 mins (my oven) and have hot biscuits for tea or breakfast. Best way to impress last minute guests who come to tea/coffee.  Brilliant basic recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I've made these twice now. Usually I buy pilsbury but they are so expensive for flour bisquits I thought I'd try my own. I do not have a bisquite cutter so I used a glass. The first time I rolled out my flour to thin so they were flaky but to thin and a bit crisp from doing so. The second time I made them, I made them fatter. I suppose mine were quite a bit bigger and thicker than they were intended and I had to cook them ten minutes longer. Either way everyone loved them. I did notice several people mentioning a lack of flavor...not sure what tehy were looking for being they were flavorful and we always add jams, honey, butter or applebutter to ours. Either way we really enjoyed them and will def make again. Super easy and super quick. Thank you.

I love this biscuit recipe. I opted to use butter instead of shortening. I think butter has more flavor. I think this is a no fail recipe.

I am a veteran biscuit maker, and have tried many recipes. The previous recipes I have used have man ingredients, including cream of tartar, so I searched to find something that could be make more quickly.  This was a delicious recipe, and turned out perfectly.  I used butter flavor crisco for the shortening, and mixed in cheddar cheese, made drop biscuits, and brushed with melted butter/garlic after taking out of the oven for cheddar bay biscuits.  This recipe is a good all-purpose biscuit recipe for either plain breakfast biscuits, or the fancier cheddar bay, or sweet biscuits (such as adding cinnamon/raisin and a glaze).  Put this one in your recipe box!

I was very happy with this recipe. The biscuits turned out perfect. Just the right crunch on the outside and light and fluffy melt in your mouth on the inside. Everyone loved them. I will definitely make these biscuits again.

These are by the far the best and easiest biscuits I have ever made!  For those of you who had flat, hard ones, be sure you use self rising flour.  This makes a world of difference. Also, don't roll them too thin, think big and fluffy! I brushed with melted butter for that crispy top and delicate inside. YUM! Don't be afraid to try these awesome homestyle biscuits. Thanks for sharing.

Our family devoured these biscuits.  Of course like with all recipes I tweeked it a little.  Regular flour, 1T baking soda, 1t salt, 1T sugar.  Added milk slowly until I got the batter I wanted.  I always use a floured rim of a glass to cut the biscuits and they were perfect size.  We will definetly use this again.  Thank you for listing this recipe.

This was my first attempt ever at making home-made biscuits...turned out wonderful and I can't believe hoe easy it was to make! I think next time I will try the butter flavored Crisco to see how that does.

This is similiar to my recipe I have free handed for years. My secret ingredient is buttermilk instead of plain milk.  I wont even make biscuits if I dont have buttermilk on hand.

Used this recipe to top a chicken pot pie, and it was delicious!  I used melted butter instead of shortening and mixed until combined, then "kneaded" the dough a little (mostly just folding it over and mushing it out) to give it a "layered" effect.  I only had regular flour, so I had to add baking soda, baking powder, and salt to make it like self-rising flour, but these were yummy and then some!

I have tried many biscuit recipes and this will be the one I continue to use.  I did swap out 2/4 of shortening for butter.  Delicious.

Delicious! I only had enough self rising for 1 recipe, but needed to double it as I have a large family. So I used the SR flour I had and then added 2 1/4 C. all purpose flour, a 1/2T. salt. 1t. baking powder and 3/4 t. baking soda. I also added 2 T. of sugar. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I baked them in a baking pan very close to each other and they rose perfectly! Nice taste too! OH! And I used butter flavored Crisco :)

Enjoying these right now.  These are the best biscuits ever!  I used butter instead of shortening, whole milk, a tsp. of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of baking soda and a dash of salt.  I placed the biscuits so they were touching sides, brushed with milk. They are perfect for egg sandwiches or just butter and jam.  Thanks for an awesome recipe! My husband commented that if we add some garlic, herbs and cheddar and brush the top with garlic butter, these would be identical to Red Lobster's biscuits!  He's right!!!

Sorry. But this recipe didn't work for me. They came out rather "short" for me. I didn't use all the milk because they were already so moist. Maybe I should have. I may try again with a bit less shortening.

The basic recipe was good-I did some tweaking also, like most everyone else.  I used only 2 cups of flour, just the regular kind, not many of us have self-rising flour on hand.  I added 3/4 cup shortening, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1 Tbsp brown sugar, and 3/4 cup milk.  I don't roll my biscuits, I just shape them into loose balls, but I did fold over the dough, and that helped them to not be too heavy.  All in all, they turned out pretty good, still a bit tasteless, as I see other people have comlained about.  I just smothered them in jelly, and that fixed the problem!

These are AMAZING my two year old loves them and my boyfriend loves them!! They turn out perfect every time and yes they are a bit plain however we don't eat just biscuits by themselves! We use them for a multitude of things. :) I recommend this to all my friends for perfect biscuits that flake wonderfully

Mine came out quite a bit flatter than the picture and tasted sort of "healthy." Perhaps it was because as 1 reviewer noted, I did not have perfectly fresh self-rising flour. Instead, I followed another reviewer's suggestion and made my own "self-rise" flour by adding baking soda & powder. Disappointing.

Trying my hand in the kitchen for the first real time in my adult life, I was drawn to this recipe for it's simplicity.  I followed the directions as is, and my first batch came out hard and burned.  After reading some of the other reviews, I modified by adding a tablespoon of sugar and a dash of salt, and I reduced the cook time to about 17 minutes.  They turned out wonderfully!

I rate 4 stars for the easy part and I will probably make again but I will cut back on the shortening, (I used butter flavor Crisco) because I thought they were a tad greasy. They also were not as light as I like. However I found the dough very easy to work with.

Done in 15min in my oven!  Just made these and they satisfied my biscuit craving! Used Parkay margarine and only a heaping 1/2 cup (3/4c is ALOT). Also used a trusty hand mixer to blend it all. They turned out perfect; not too bland or floury and not too greasy. Also very soft. Set the timer for 15min and had to pull 'em within 1 min of the beeep. Glad to find a good use for my self rising flour.

This is a great basic recipe, but would be better if you use lard or butter depending upon your taste preferences, as shortening will not add any flavor and be bland.  To address other reviewers, self-rising flour has baking power/soda in it and should rise nicely, but if your self-rising flour is too old it will lose its potency.  It may have even sat in the grocery store too long.  Also, to add sugar to a biscuit is plain WRONG.  You do that with rolls.

These were very good.    However, both times I made them, they came out a little crispier than I usually like.  Very good flavor, though.

My 22 yr old son, who doesn't cook for himself much, wanted biscuits and gravy for breakfast.  So.....I signed onto AR - he searched for easy biscuits.  His result was a delicious biscuit that was somewhat flakey and held well under the gravy I taught him to make.  He had to make his own self-rising flour - add 3 tsp baking powder & 3/4 tsp salt for this recipe. (isn't google search  handy???) He mixed the dough with a spoon first, then on a parchment sheet the dough is  folded a few times and gently patted adding flour until not sticky; then hand patted to about 1/4 inch thickness,  after cutting patted out dough again making  11 biscuits total.  He replaced 1/4 cup of the shortening with 1/4 cup bacon grease from my stash in the fridge.  His bake time was about 19-20mins.   I think making his own self-rising flour, using freshly opened baking powder, helped with the flaky end result.  hmmm - I don't have to worry about him starving without me afterall.  : )  ...... lol...Thanks for the easy recipe.

Couldn't ask for an easier biscuit to make. I only had regular flour, so I did as someone else did, and added 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 Tablespoon baking powder..Some said they were plain, but never be afraid to jazz something up. I added just some garlic powder, and next time i will add some chedder cheese. I sprayed both the bottom of the pan with butter flavored spray, and I also sprayed the top of the biscuits as well. 425 is too high for my oven, so I cooked them on 350 for about 20 minutes. The perfect biscuit. Thanks for the recipe.

I used the following suggestions from other reviewers since I don't have a great history with biscuits: added 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder to regular all-purpose flour, used butter instead of shortening, and baked close together to help the biscuits bake straight up. This is the first biscuit recipe that I have had success with! Thanks Brenda!

My biscuits did NOT turn out well... but I suspect that my baking powder was too old.
The flavor of the biscuits was good, but they didn't rise at all, so they were really dense. 
I'll try it again with new baking powder and see if I have a different result.

I did not care for this recipe. It came out as a thin soup and then I doubled the flour and shortening, then I tripled the flour and and shortening and still it was just runny. Worst case: I could have been distracted and doubled the milk (I think I might have b/c the phone rang just when i started putting things together), but then the extra floor and shortening would have corrected the issue.

I used bisquick baking mix (heart smart), margerine (it's what I had), and almond milk (unsweetened).   I did add 2 Tbl sugar and a splash of vanilla.    These were so fluffy on the inside and not dry at all!  They were similar to KFC.  My husband did like them, so that was a good comment!    I will make again!  Very easy and simple.  I only got 10 biscuits.

So.....i had a friend cook these and they came out block hard, but she overmixed the dough.  I made them and they flaked nicely.  The key is nit to overmix the dough.  Add in butter and flour first to make a crumb mixture then gently fold in mix.  Pat it down, do not roll out with a roller.  Add a little baking powder an use buttermilk for more rise.

These were really good.  I used salted real butter in place of the shortening because I was out.  These turned out light and flaky inside and slightly crispy outside.  I cooked them only 17 minutes because they were already browned.  I will use this recipe again!

I never buy the store-bought mix anymore. I do add baking soda, powder and salt to reg flour and use butter rather than shortening.

This was my first attempt at making homemade biscuits. It was very simple to make. I think I should have doubled it and made a thicker biscuit. I think next time I'll use the suggestion someone else left with rolling it thinner and then putting two on top of each other for baking. These went very good with homemade cherry jam :D

eh.  I have a few problems with this recipe.  I made it as stated.  The dough was so wet that even after i added only 3/4 of the milk i still added like another cup of flour to make it workable.  Then all i could really taste was shortening.  I love the simplicity of this recipe, but i would have to cut back on the shortening a bit and the milk.

Great biscuits.  I didn't have any shortening so I used butter instead and they still turned out  fine.  I brushed the tops with a mixture of garlic powder , melted butter, salt and parsley and got rave reviews from my family!  I'll definitely be making this again.

These came out just like Australian scones....though I liked the idea of folding the dough in half so they pull apart easily after baking. The milk was too much as directed so I used about half the amount. I enjoyed them for morning tea with butter and strawberry jam. Tonight for dinner I will make a bacon gravy for them to satisfy my husband's preference for the savoury style.

Easy and tasty. I did mine as drop biscuits, they were a bit crumbly but tasted great with jam. Following other reviews, I added a tad bit of salt and sugar.

Thank goodness cuz cupboard was bare! I havnt used anything but bisquick for years, but had a craving, didnt have shortening or self rising flour. added baking powder (Tbsp), ( no b soda either), and used 1/2 stick unsalted butter, and rest in veg. spread. cut in the butter/spread, then added milk slowly. patted out, doubled, and cut out with juice glass- made perfect size. brushed tops w/spread. baked 18 minutes.
I think they would have been better with Crisco. even with added baking powder, they didnt rise much. tasted okay, but even with the butter, not much flavor. good w/butter and jelly though, and satisfied my biscuit craving for now.
I think butter Crisco and maybe add shredded cheese , as drop biscuits, they would be close to red lobsters cheddar biscuits. 
thanks for the easy basic recipe!

This recipe in of itself is not great, actually it's very bland but that only means it has great potential for adding other ingrediants.  I will use this on the weekend adding some herbs and garlic for garlic biscuits. Adding sugar and vanilla would be great for strawberry shortcake.  I will use this recipe again.

These were great! Made them on night for strawberry shortcake and added 3 tbsps of sugar to the dough.  Turned out very yummy but they didn't rise much so I would aim to make a thicker biscuit than just 1/2 inch.  Had the rest the next morning with strawberry jam and butter, great breakfast! I think without the added sugar to the dough these would have been pretty bland. You could also add vanilla or butter flavor to the dough.

I really liked the texture if the biscuits. My oven is pretty hot so I baked mine for about 15 mins on 400. I did find them a little on the plain side so next time I will probably add about 1/2 tsp of salt. I also only needed about 3/4 cup of milk,  it's pretty humid where I live so maybe that's why.  Overall I loved the recipe, simple + fluffy = yummy to me!

Very easy base recipe. From this recipe you can really expand the horizons. I didn't substitute anything, but I did add some salt and pepper, and brushed them with melted butter before putting in the oven. They only took about 15 minutes in my oven, but my oven runs hotter. I'll be putting this in my recipe book. There's many things you can do with just this recipe.

I just made them and they are easy to make and good to eat. I did read the reviews first and liked the use of butter instead of shortening for more flavor and these biscuits are not plain tasting using butter. This will be a much used recipe for that homemade taste in biscuits! Thanks!

This recipe was really simple, but really tasteless. Also, my oven may be incorrect temperature, because, at 425 degrees my first batch got very crispy in 19 minutes.  2nd batch I lowered the temp. to 350 and they were cooked well.

These biscuits were quick, easy and delicious. I made them twice and both times they were gone before I could put them on the table. I did take some suggestions from other comments, I added a pinch of salt, 1/2teaspoon baking powder, 1 tablespoon of sugar (optional), 1/2 cup shortening and 1/4 cup butter. The butter and sugar gave them some flavor so they were tasty with just a little butter. I would like to freeze the cut uncooked biscuits and cook them in a week or two and see  how they turn out. If anyone has done this please share your experience.

The dough was too sticky to do anything with it.
So I kept adding more and more self-rising flour until the dough is better.
Hope this helps!

These turned out great.  I didn't have self-rising flour so I took the advice of previous posters and added baking powder and baking soda.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon salt.  I used shortening but I put it in the freezer for a few minutes to make sure it was really cold.  I pulled mine at 20 minutes, they were a bit dark and any longer they would have burned.  I would suggest checking them at 15 minutes if your oven cooks fast.  I will definitely be making these again.

This is a fast and friendly recipe - it may easily be adapted by adding grated cheese and garlic, or even changing to buttermilk, but the one key element to making biscuits that will rise properly is to cut them straight down - do not use a twisting motion...such a little thing, but so important!

They turned out superb! yokay, so I was a little nervous about making these biscuits because I wasn't sure what self-raising flour was and looking around, we didn't have any, so instead I used Krusteaz Buttermilk pancake mix, then instead of using shortening I used COLD butter (cold butter supposedly will make biscuits flakier), mixed it in with the milk and flour mix and prepared the rest like the instructions, cooked it for about 12 minutes/ until golden brown and they rocked!

Made these because I was in a pinch.  Choose this recipe because -- only 3 ingredients.  Did not have milk but did have buttermilk powder so used that in place of milk.  Doubled the receipe - and because I was in a rush I just used a large scoop and scooped out 24 bisquits and slightly flattened them.  Took advise from others and placed right next to each other.  Slightly bland but with butter and jelly they were great.

I made them just now ONLY since I didn't have shortening I thought to use bacon grease..Yepz! bacon grease instead. I save bacon grease right after cooking bacon I put it in a crock in the fridge. Had a little less than called for I doubled the recipe. I also added a sprinkle of dry butter flavoring for popcorn. I've made biscuits from these forums before that were so bad and dry. These weren't I rolled them out a little bit and double stacked them. I put on baking sheet and brushed veg oil on the top. Baked and I am enjoying these now! Thanks for the recipe.

Followed recipe, but they came out flat and flavorless.. Maybe they need baking soda?

I added a pinch of salt and used whole milk. Will try half butter, half shortening next time. Also will add more salt, maybe 3/4 teaspoon. Biscut doesn't have much flavor but great with sausage gravy.

I should have read the reviews and added baking powder.  They were like browned dough cakes with NO flavor.  bummer...use baking powder, add salt for flavor.

very easy, and tasty, I did add sugar, baking powder and baking soda, I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 shortening, was not watery at all, and may I suggest to those who claim it tasted to much like flour to taste the dough before cooking so you will know if you need to add anything else, thank you for the recipe :)

Very Bland.  The ease of the biscuits does not makeup for the lack of flavor.  Tasted like flour and shortening.

These did not turn out so good. Even with self-rising flour, these biscuits didn't rise. I still tasted, but they were very plain. I ended up eating just two or three bites of one. Thanks for trying to find an easier way to make biscuits, but I think i will stick to the more conventional recipes.

My husband made these for me (he is a novice cook) and didn't realize we had all purpose flour vs self rising flour.... so they were pretty dense.  We will add some baking powder and baking soda to our next batch (to equal the self-rising flour). Also used butter instead of shortnening. *ADD SALT- they are very bland.

i have made many biscuit recipes and this one was not to my liking.  very runny and had to use a lot more flour.  not to mention they didn't rise-lack of baking soda or powder in the recipe, which i didn't realize at first.  they also fell apart when trying to eat them.  taste-bland unless with butter or jam.  wouldn't recommend or make again.

This recipe is great for biscuit beginners or folks like me who just can't make biscuits.  I followed the recipe to a "T", but I doubled it and made them in a baking pan rather than on a cookie sheet.    You'll definitely want to pat the dough rather than rolling it.  If it's too sticky, just add a little more flour to the outside of the dough.  I think I cut the dough to about a inch thickness.  Folding the dough over was a great idea.  The biscuits come right apart for adding butter, jam, gravy, or whatever you like.  These truly taste like restaurant biscuits.

Quick.  Easy.  Tasty.  I used half butter & half Crisco.  I wasn't sure how thick to make them.  They were probably half inch or less, so they werent all that thick, but only took about 15 minutes to bake.  I would say if you place the biscuits so that they touch in the pan, you can expect them to double in thickness.  Just guessing.

I think this is a good, simple biscuit recipe.  I did use butter instead of shortening for more flavor.  Next time I will use buttermilk instead of regular milk.  My biscuits turned out light and fluffy.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I altered the recipe and they came out delicious. I added less shortening, butter, baking powder, and baking soda. They were very light, fluffy and moist on the inside. I will definately be making them again. Love them thanks alot

I love the idea of the three ingredient biscuit but they were a little flavorless, so I halved the shortening and replaced it with salted butter. The butter made for an easy, tasty fix.

These 3 ingredient biscuits are simple and very very tasty... as another reviewer wrote, they taste like KFC biscuits  The consistency and flavor are identical.  I forgot to fold the dough over and double it... but will do that next time.  they were small because of that, but the flavor was awesome!  thank you for this great biscuit recipe!

These certainly lived up to their name "easy". Also, they had a nice texture. I had some leftover self-rising flour to use so I decided to give them a try. I made them smaller (about half the diameter of regular biscuits) to use for finger sandwiches. I baked them at 400 for about 14 minutes on my baking stone and they came out just right.

These came out pretty good! They were flaky and delicious! I don't keep shortening in the house so I used salted butter instead(out of unsalted), because of this they came out a bit salty since I made the self-rising flour myself. Good recipe but I gave it three stars because you cannot leave the biscuits in for 20-25 minutes. Ours were done in 15 minutes!

I would love to thank you Brenda!!! I am a newlywed and LOVE TO COOK!!! I'm a  southern girl who would never allow a box of bisquick in my house. LOL However when my husband told me last minute my inlaws were dropping by for breakfast I could have died!! I had to spit shine my house, wipe down my daughter (no time to bathe anyone), and had not been grocery shopping. I rememebered running across this recipe and decided to try it... needless to say they truly tasted like my usual biscuits that take forever to make... I will never go back!!!! Plus... they could never tell the difference... my mother in law even COMPLIMENTED them! So you know they had to be good :)

I only did a couple of things different. I added about 1/4 cup more flour, a little salt, and I used evaporated milk because I was low on regular milk. They turned out great, my kids and me husband loved them and they were very easy.

These biscuits are perfect!  I followed the recipe word for word.  The flavor is great, the height and thickness is great!  Sure they're crumbling apart as I try to open them, but they're so moist inside...just like KFC!!  I didn't think that would be true, but it is!

I'm serving with a side of bacon, eggs, hash browns, and they're dripping with butter/strawberry jelly!!  Ooooh Weee!!  Delicious!!   Thank you!!

These were SO good! We added a little baking powder and salt and made sure to really knead it well and they were wonderful! Very much like my all time favorite KFC biscuits. Stored well on top of the fridge in a ziploc bag for a week. Will absolutely make them again!

These are great!  I followed some other reviews and added a bit of Baking Powder.  They turned out awesome.  I will bake them again.

I was looking for an easy biscuit recipe and this one definately is, but I didn't think these had much flavor.  Mine turned out kind of skinny, crunchy, and flavorless. I would definately add some salt or something if I made these again.

I have had many failed attempts to duplicating my Mom's homemade biscuits and just couldn't do it.  But this recipe made it the easiest.  They are the best and easy to make.  Will use this recipe many times over.

This is really easy and takes no time at all. Very good for beginner. I personally love the taste, but it might be because my shortening were already a little sweet? Eitherway, yes it's good. :)

Had a good flavor, but didn't rise.  They ended up flat, hard lumps.  Once we were able to pry our way inside of them, they did taste like biscuits.  They turned out so bad i thought I must have done something wrong. So I tried it again with the same results.  I was beginning to think it was me or my oven until I found another recipe that turned out perfect.  In comparing the two, i realized the problem with this one is that it calls for too much flour and the cooking time is about twice what is necessary.

I'm sorry, but these were some of the worst biscuits I've ever eaten. The self-rising flour made them way to salty, they hardly rose after baking for 20 minutes, and they tasted of flour. I added a 1/4 cup sugar which helped a little bit but I had to throw out a lot of them (which is a rare occurrence in my household).

The biscuits were easy to make and had a good taste but my Hubby and I both agree that we would have liked them to be a little more moist. But an excellent recipe for a beginner to try.

I wanted an easy recipe being it was my first time making biscuits from scratch. They turned out great! I was amazed how fast and easy it was to make them. I did use butter instead of shortening and they were perfect for biscuits and gravy!

I cooked for 15 mins and they burned. The dough was incredibly sticky. They all melted together even though I made sure to put plenty of space between them. This recipe was honestly the worst one I have used for biscuits.

This recipe is similar to how my grandma makes her biscuits. I am very pleased with how they turned out. The only change I made was that I brushed them with butter a few min before they were done cooking!! So delicious! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I followed the recipe to the letter, wasn't sure what to expect after reading a few of the reviews which said the biscuits were a little bland...not so with the ones I just made, they are light and fluffy and have a wonderful taste before adding anything else to them, no butter, jam, or gravy I sampled them right off the cook sheet and they are delicious! I will be using this as my go to biscuit recipe in the future!

I make mine with butter instead of shortening. I use a pastry blender to cut the butter into the flour and then add the milk. Just before biscuits are finished cooking I take them out and butter the tips and put the under the broiler to brown them a bit.

We loved these biscuits!!! You can’t go wrong with 3 ingredients in a recipe. Cut the shortening into the flour with a knife or pastry cutter. I’m anxious to try these again with lard. Not very healthy, but when is any biscuit meal healthy lol!

Great and easy recipe. I substituted buttermilk for sweet milk and didn’t roll off just pinched off biscuits by hand instead of rolling it out. Cooked it in an iron skillet too. ????

The instructions are too simplistic. A novice baker might not know you have to cut in the butter, or shortening. Also, even though I used self-rising flour (fresh) my biscuits did not rise like those depicted. One thing I did to make it easier was to grate the butter (what I used) into the flour. Easy-peasy! Just put it in the freezer for 30 mins. so it’ll stay cold long enough to grate.

I liked this pretty well.  As other reviews stated they would do nicely with gravy. 
I do not have self rising flour,  these are the changes I made:
Add 1 Tbsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda.  Half  whole wheat flour and half regular flour.  Used stick margarine instead of shortening.
The dough was VERY sticky and had to work in more flour. Overall I think this was a good recipe.

The fact that this is top of the list when googling “self-rising biscuit recipe” is a major Google fail. It is WRONG WRONG WRONG in almost all particulars. For 2 cups of self-rising flour one needs only 4 tbsp of butter, or only 8 tbsps if you want it really buttery (1 stick). Don’t add 1 cup of milk or you will have a hopelessly gloopy mess. 2/3 to 3/4 cup of milk is PLENTY. Finally, like scones, these bake at 425 degrees F for only about 15 minutes until golden brown (12-16 mins). This recipe calling for 1.5 sticks of butter, 1 cup milk, and 20-25 mins of baking is a recipe to waste good ingredients. I actually made this on a sleepy Sunday morning when I was too tired to check out other ingredients. The milk turned the flour/butter mixture into wallpaper paste that required additional flour, and baking for 20 mins turned the “biscuits” into blackened pucks. THEN I checked other recipes and realized that this recipe was just WRONG on so many levels. All the biscuits went into the trash bin - wasting good flour, butter, milk, and my Sunday morning.

I rate according to title and description and these are all they claim to be.  You can't make biscuits any easier or faster.  This is a great recipe to use as a foundation.  Replace the shortening with butter, add salt, sugar, honey, etc to your taste.  Use all purpose flour and add baking powder and optionally baking soda instead if you need to.  This recipe is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.

WOW, Great Recipe It really worked out well. The changes I made is I used Butter instead of shortening. Also I used 3/4 cup of milk and added 1/4 cup of sour cream. This added taste almost like you used buttermilk. I also felt that the biscuits were lighter and baked really well ! I highly reccomend this recipe !

I set a goal to master the perfect biscuit this year...soft and flaky.  These are just the ticket!  I love how this recipe is only 3 ingredients and so easy.  I believe the flakiness comes from not mixing too much and not using a rolling pin.  Folding the dough over helps to make the layers I love so much in a biscuit.  This is my biscuit recipe from here on out!

I always read reviews. That being said since I had no shortening in the house I used blue bonnet margarine. They looked great and tasted even better.  I was worried they would be bland based on other reviews but they were quite nice. Also the recipe did not specify if we should spray the pan with cooking spray so I made the main batch on a sprayed pan and the left over dough I did not spray the pan. The sprayed pan one turned out much softer.

Super easy. A bit plain but I brushed butter on them when they came out of the oven and it made all the difference! Perfect for our homemade sausage gravy and biscuits supper tonight.  Made 12 biscuits.

This is a good recipe. It is the first time I've made biscuits that had the right texture.  After reading some of these reviews,  I used butter instead of shortening and added a pinch of salt which took care of the tasteless issue.

I used a pastry cutter to blend the butter into the flour which seemed to make it easier to combine the butter and flour before adding the milk.

loved this and will be making this all the time! I brushed them with some buttermilk before baking and they came out perfect. the only thing the recipe doesn't tell you is that you have to make them really thick and I think putting them next to each other on the baking sheet would help them rise up instead of out. I also didn't have any self rising flour so I made my own. the taste is really good. I love this recipe.

Excellent recipe! Tasted just like the yummy ones you eat in a restaurant. I made these with Hudson cream self rising flour, worked crisco into the flour really really good then added milk followed the instructions except this dough is so workable that you don't need wax paper and little flour to keep it from sticking. This will be my go to recipe for makin biscuits ;)

These biscuits were easy to make and came out perfect! I made two small changes: 1- instead of shortening, I used equal amount of butter. 2- After reading some reviews that stated the biscuits were plain, I added approximately 1/4 of sugar. I will be making these again!

I turned them into drop biscuits and added a couple pinches of baking powder just to get a better rise. Great easy recipe.

I put together my own self rising flour from all purpose flour, salt and baking powder because I didn't have any, but this was still super easy and came out perfectly.  Like another reviewer, I folded and pressed the dough out a couple more times and it held up fine.  Didn't flatten out.  They were huge and fluffy!

Very easy recipe to throw together when you need biscuits.  I don't usually have shortening on hand so I used butter.    I brushed mine with a little melted butter after I took them out of the oven.

I have made these four times, they have a wonderful flavor but mine never rise. ? Either way they were great with everything they were served with.

Loved it!! I use it for my Chicken and Dumplings and it's just perfect. Thanks for posting an easy recipe for those of us who find cooking challenging, but want to feed their families better than store bought!

I made these today to eat with country gravy and (veggie) sausage. I don't have much experience in biscuit-making. I forgot to double the dough and they came out quite thin. However, they were delicious!

Great biscuits! I especially liked the fact that the process didn't leave a huge mess on the counter like most biscuit recipes do.

I used butter instead of shortening and did not double the dough. They still turned out great. They're perfect with any type of jam or honey. They pulled apart easily and were very flaky and tasty. This was a very easy recipe and will be my go-to for biscuits in the future.

I tweaked this recipe by using AP flour plus 1 tablespoon baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 tablespoon sugar. I handled the dough per Chef John for his Cream Biscuits recipe, then baked at 375F for 15 minutes. They were tall, flaky, and fabulous! Thanks for sharing this very easy recipe.

Feb. 16, 2015 Edit: I made these today using coconut oil, which is solid at room temperature. The biscuits rose nicely, with a crunchy bottom crust. Baked at 375F for 20 minutes made them perfectly golden.

Feb. 25, 2015 Edit: I made these today to go with chili, but I tweaked the recipe by using one stick of butter (1/2 cup) instead of 3/4 cup shortening. I cut the biscuits out with a water glass, then cut the rounds in half. I rolled each half in my hands to make a long tube just longer than my hands. The rolled dough was fashioned into a knot shape by criss-crossing and placed onto a foil-lined sheet pan. I melted half a stick of butter (1/4 cup) and added 2 T grated Parmesan-Romano cheese, 1 t dried Italian herbs, 3/4 t garlic powder and combined. This was brushed generously over the top of the biscuits. I baked them at 375F for 20 minutes. They were golden, flaky, and delicious.

Nov. 1, 2015 Edit: I made these today but subbed buttermilk and lard. I baked and 350F for 15 minutes. Scrumptious!

Easy, easy, easy and they came out just right. I used coconut shortening. Next time I will add a little salt. Fabulous, quick and easy. Thank you for this recipe. P.s.  My husband says this would also make a good cheddar biscuit recipe.

I've used this base recipe for years with AP flour, baking powder and baking soda. Makes wonderful cheddar bay biscuits! Make sure your shortening is cold and don't over mix once the milk is added!

As a college kid who really has no idea what she's doing in the kitchen, this recipe was really easy for me to make. However, I did have to change two of the ingredients that I didn't own because my roommates weren't home and I didn't have a car. I used butter instead of shortening, which was a simply fix, but the main issue was that we don't have any baking powder, baking soda, or even self-rising flour (I'm only staying with these guys for two weeks before I leave for study abroad; if this were my permanent kitchen, it'd be stocked!). However, I did find some pizza dough mix that contained dry yeast, so I said what the heck and threw it in. I was sure my biscuits would turn out to be a disaster, but they were actually really good--especially with raspberry preserves on top! But even without the preserves, the biscuits were still pretty good. 
Thanks for the recipe!

Outstanding!! I took the advice of some of the others and used the baking powder and soda because I had all purpose flour. I also used butter instead of shortening. They turned out light and moist.. Definitely a keeper!!

I followed the directions and used real butter instead of shortening as suggested by others. I was extremely disappointed by the outcome of this recipe. It was dry and had no taste to it.

I tried this recipe this morning for the first time, and it was really good.  I have tried other recipe but this one will be the one for sure to make for my family... I changed the oven temp for about five minutes, from 425 to 400 then after five I raised it to 425.  I also made sure that before I started the oven was turned on to 400. Even though I had set the timer for 22 minutes, I checked the biscuits having 7 minutes on the timer.  They were done, and I took them out of the oven.  I also have an electric oven so I'm guessing it varies from oven to oven.  We served them with sausage gravy, and even grandma had fun eating them... Thanks!

these are a great basic recipe there's alot you can do and still get a good result. change the shortening to margrine or like me butter and they have a creamy flavor and flaky. I use this one for biscuits and sausage gravy once a year only.... just a craving that come's from being a kid and my mom always made so it's to bring back memories with her and I try to always do it on her birthday so that she know's Im thinking of her way up in those sky's that she's watching over me she know's and well yeah once a year we have these if it was up to me it would be more often but they arent healthy in anyway so we keep it at once a year just for mom,,,,,,,,,,,, love my mom and miss her so....

Best recipe for biscuits, cause you can't screw 'em up! I used butter flavored Crisco and added about a Tsp of salt. Before putting them in the oven I brushed with melted butter and right when they came out. Mine were perfect after 15 minutes.

If I could give this 10 stars I would! Easily the best biscuits I've ever made. I think a hot oven (heat it at least 10 minutes) and a greased cast iron pan put them over the top! I used butter (only because I did not have shortening) and sprinkled garlic powder on top before putting them in the oven. The tops and bottoms were nice and crispy, and inside nice and fluffy. 
I think they would be great with a bit of sugar and vanilla added, plus a little sprinkle of sugar on top for strawberry shortcake!

Great, simple recipe but I added about a tablespoon and a half of baking powder.  Also added a dash of garlic powder and onion powder for more flavor.  They came out fantastic.

These were easy to make though I didn't have self rising flour so pulled up AR's substitution chart and put in about 1 TBLS baking powder and aout a tsp of salt. Made 2 batches as was making AR recipe of Garlic and Herb Pull Apart Bread and didn't have any canned biscuits. These were a little too soft for it, but it tasted great! Instead of rolling it out, I made little balls to roll in the butter mixture and put straight into the bundt pan. I also added about 2 tsp of garlic powder to the flour when I added the baking powder and salt and it gave it a great savory taste. I did have to bake it for a really long time to get it done though. Next time, I'll just make regular biscuits!

Very bland, and the texture was unappetizing, as well.  I followed this recipe exactly, other than adding a 1/2 tsp of salt (because of other reviews) thinking this would add some flavor. I will definitely not be making this one again!

Very easy! I did use all-purpose flour and just added baking soda and powder like others did and they turned out great. However, I also used butter flavored shortening instead of regular shortening and it added a lot of flavor with out have to change the recipe.

What a waste of flour, crisco, milk and time! These were flat, greasy and tasteless!!!  Definitely will not make again ever!!! Don't waste your time with this one -- just look for another recipe that actually works!

I used cold butter instead of shortening, and only 3/4 cup of milk. I put the self rising flour in my kitchenaid with the diced butter and used the paddle to cut the butter in. Then I kept it on low speed and slowly poured the milk in until it came together. That's how I only used 3/4 cup. I dusted the counter with all purpose flour and patted flat, folded over, patted flat, folded over a couple of times. I think the all purpose flour keeps it from getting tough. I used my medium sized cutter, brushed the tops with melted butter before and after baking.  They were baked at 425 convection for about 15 minutes. Both my husband and I thought they were delicious both times I've made them.

The first batch i made i used wax paper to bake on, which was an awful idea. The following batches were fair, they didn't rise how i wanted and were really thick. If i were to make again i would use yeast.

This recipe did not work out for me. They did not rise as high as the photos suggested about 10% higher than when they were put in the oven. Followed the recipe without tweaking, very easy to put together, worked the dough to a minimum just till all ingredients were together. I was expecting a fluffier biscuit. Also the shortening I thought was too much at 3/4 cup turned out heavy could not eat any more! Will have to look for a recipe that suits my fancy.

We love this super simple recipe.  I do use butter instead of shortening like other reviewers had suggested.  Also, once they are out of the oven, I brush melted butter over them.  Super yummy!

We love it . Especially my 10 yr old daughter .it was easy enough for her to do it with my help and she loves them . I did take one of the tips and use butter. I had a squeeze bottle of "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter". Which made it easy for my daught to measure it. Thanks Again.

I tried this recipie and it came out totally different than the picture. Honestly, the directions weren't clear enough, and there were no alternatives listed, and how much to use for alternatives..I don't have a biscuit cutter or shortening. I saw that you could use veggie oil as a subsitute and the biscuits never rose. It tastes like-as my mom put it-un leavened bread for like the passsover or something..no egg, no baking powder, salt, sugar. Definately not what I was looking to do.  -CulinaryCLUTZ00 
I made 2 batches: In the first I followed the directions and in the second, I added an egg, less oil, more flour, powdered sugar(on top) hazelnut syrup, vanilla extract and a little more milk. It still didn't meet my standards.

I love the simplicity of this recipe!

I had to make my own self rising flour even though I am a fan of White Lily. I even ran out of AP flour, and had to dig into a new bag of bread flour to get the last 1/4 cup and to flour the board I used for shaping the dough. I skipped the wax paper obviously. I added a teaspoon of salt and used lard (and admitted to it). I made my own "buttermilk" with milk and white vinegar. I skipped the wax paper. As far as patting the dough down I did it maybe 4 times. The less you handle this dough the better. I sprinkled a little more bread flour on top of the dough after patting it out to make the dough less sticky and easier to handle.

I think it's very difficult to get 12 biscuits out of this recipe. I got 13, but I had to cut them very small. I combined the last two and that biscuit came out the best. Some of the biscuits did not rise as much as I wanted, but I think that was because I spaced them out. The biscuits that rose were placed so that they touched. We also sprayed the baking sheet and the tops of the biscuits with cooking spray. These tasted great.

These were OK. The flavor was good, but they turned out like hockey pucks. I followed other user's advice by: using half wheat flour and half white, using butter instead of shortening, putting them close together so they would bake up instead of out and by using regular flour and adding 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda. My biscuits did not rise. At all. I was expecting them to be big and fluffy. Perhaps it's because I didn't follow recipe exactly. I will give it another chance and follow recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. I haven't made biscuits since I was a teenager but this was super easy! My family loved them. My husband said they were better than Bojangles (a real compliment coming from him). I love that there are only three ingredients. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I was feeling reminiscent of my grandmother's biscuits and thought I would come on here and find a recipe.  Too many recipes that I found weren't close enough to hers, yours was spot on!    Even though I had to change it a lil (I didn't have shortening so I used 1 cup of butter, 1/2 cup of oil) they turned out so beautifully....and best of all, they were simple and elegant!  The sad part to all of this is this is the night my stove decided to not stay lit lol so it took about 2 hours for them to FINALLY cook...  Thank you so much!

make sure you pat these to be at least 1/2 in thick and watch them in the oven.  mine were too thin and the 20 minute minimum made them too crispy.  they were still good smothered in homemade sausage gravy though!

Bland and greasy.  Forget trying to modify it with other reviewer's suggestions to make it better.  The best way to make these "Easy Biscuits" is to look for another recipe.

I also substituted grated butter instead of shortning, and added 1/4 cup more milk. Nice & soft & excellent flavor!

This recipe didn't work for me. The inside never cooked and it was gooey. I think it needs baking soda or powder as well as the self-rising flour.

They turned out perfect, I am making them a few times a week now! I liked them the way they are, but I have added a few shakes of sugar (mainly for company, not family) so they do not have such the flour taste. Again, thanks for the recipe, it's now a staple in our kitchen!

My self rising flour didn't cut it, and it was well in date, didn't expire until next December.  Will try again with self made self rise flour next time, also used butter Crisco, they were still delicious even though they didn't rise much!

We did not like these at all.  They were very dry , and had no flavor.  I think these need a good pinch of salt, at the very least/

They turned out very burnt, and I cooked them for the reccomended amount of time. Very plain and bland. Dough was very sticky, even after I added a lot of flour. Will not make again.

It turned out okay. Nice color, good texture, but it didn't have much flavor. Next time, I will use baking soda or salt and mix it in with the dough.

Simply Delicious!  It was so simple and turned out perfect for me. No kneading or cubing frozen butter.  You can not go wrong with this recipe.  They were really fluffy and delicious.  The only change I made was to brush with melted butter a couple minutes prior to end of cooking time.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

I made a lot of modifications to this recipe and they turned out pretty good! My husband seemed to love them. Here are my changes: I only had all purpose flour, so I took another reviewers suggestions and used 1 Tb baking powder and 1 tsp salt (I didn't have any fresh baking soda). I also substituted 1/2 C wheat flower to make them a little bit "healthier," which worked well. Since other reviewers complained about lack of flavor, I substituted 1/4 of the shortening for butter and added a Tb of vanilla extract, which made them smell really good. With a bit of honey on the finished biscuits, they tasted just right! Finally I mixed all of this up in my cuisinart food processor, which was perfect and made them VERY easy to press out (I usually have problems with that stage and end up having hands covered in dough!) They weren't the best I've had, but probably the best I've made so far!

Thanks Brenda for a great recipe. The only thing I did different was cut down on the shortening and added unsalted butter.  I entered these in our local fair and won a blue ribbon and $5.00.  I have also added cheddar cheese, bacon bits and a little garlic and made cheese biscuits.  Another variation is to add a little sugar, cinnamon and raisins and make cinnamon-raisins biscuits.  When they came out of the oven I drizzled them with icing.

i have made the recipe as lists and is a wonderful very basic biscuit! a couple times my kids changed up things because of being out of something or another... one time they used snoqualamie falls pancake mix instead of flour and margerine uz they don like shortening or oil and they came out as the sweetest fluffy buttery biscuits i ever had...so i thought to use buttermilk as the liquid and poof that was grand too. the other substiture i remembered if your out of shortening is equal amounts of mayo. (using light is also much more nutritious)

These were just ok. I thought they were kind of dry.  They came out a bit crispy, after 15 mins they were looking too brown so I had to turn it down to 400 for the last few mins.

I made home-made jelly for the first time and wanted a quick and easy biscuit recipe to go with them. They turned out to be very delicious! I made food baskets for my family for Christmas and gave them biscuits along with the jelly and other goodies I had made.

They were pretty plain, the next time I make them i'll try to spruce them up a bit. Maybe with some butter and salt. I'm not real sure what would make them better. I did like them though they were easy and good with butter and jam. They'd be great with gravy too

This is the second time I've made these. I only use half the recipe for two people. I added 1/4 cup of sugar, instead of shortening I added melted margarine. The first time I was able to cut into circles using a drinking glass (I don't have a biscuit cutter). This time it was too sticky so I made drop biscuits instead and they are still very tasty.

I made these with butter instead of shortening and they didn't come out all that well... very bland. I wasn't too worried since I was serving them with sausage gravy. I think next time, I'll add a bit of baking powder and salt.

These were pretty good! I was gonna give them 3 stars because the dough was kinda runny and then they almost burned in the oven. But I think I'll try them again with less milk and shorter cooking time. Rubbed butter on top after they were done and then slathered em in homemade strawberry butter. Yum!

I was a bit disappointed with these biscuits.  They were a little dry and didn't seem to have much flavor. My only modification was to use a tablespoon of baking powder, since I did not have any self-rising flour.  These were easy to make, but lacking in flavor.

I really liked how this recipe turned out. I add sugar to the recipe (i like my biscuits sweet),the taste was so good, i'm going to continue to use this recipe. However, i didn't have the rising flour so i did what the other reviewers suggested and add baking soda and salt. But, they didn't get much larger than the size i cut out. This isn't the first time my biscuits haven't rose any hints/ tips as to why my biscuits are staying flat would be much appreciated.
