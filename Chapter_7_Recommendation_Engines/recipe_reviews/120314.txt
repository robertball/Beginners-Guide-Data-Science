Orange roughy is only tasty with the right marinade to bring out its flavour.  This recipe is excellent.  My husband, who is not fussy about this particular fish raved about it!  It was delicious.  I did make a few changes.  I used tomato past instead of ketchup as I'm not a fan of processed foods.  I also used sesame oil instead of canola and didn't add sesame seeds although I'll do that next time.  It's a quick dish to prepare and guests are certain to enjoy it.  You really cannot go wrong with this one!

I thought this marinade did not bring out the best in the orange roughy.  I have prepared this same fish many different ways and thought this one fell short of my other recipes.

I was suprised how good this is, the ing. sound strange together, I used pineapple juice instead because that's what I had on hand. I'll make this again!

I was worried that the ketchup in this recipe might be overpowering for a mild fish like orange roughy, but the flavor was great!  I used regular soy sauce instead of low-sodium and I didn't bother with the sesame seeds.  This is my new favorite way to have orange roughy.

I was excited to try this recipe, but unfortunaely very disappointed with the results. I followed it exactly as written, however, I left off the sesame seeds at the end. The marinade gave the fish a very strange taste. Our family couldn't eat it. The orange roughy itself tasted fine so I know it wasn't the fish. Just a very odd, unpleasant taste. Sorry.

This marinade is light and refreshing and does not overpower the flavor of the fish.  I added a little fresh basil to the top of the fish before serving and omitted the sesame seeds.

It was good.  I think my fillet might have been a little thick.  Make sure to put lots of marinade I think I spread mine a little thin :)

this was the best!  super flavorful (marinated for 2.5 hours) and easy to make (you should have all ingredients on hand anyways).  this would also be good on other fish fillets but particularly with an oilier fish like orange roughy - yum yum. do not overmarinate!

This recipe was easy to make, I forgot to put the sesame seeds on at the end but really didn't need it, very flavorful.  Will definitely make this again.

Very good.  Used Hake instead of Roughy, but they are all white fish, so I figured it would work.  Definitely did.  Baked at 400 degrees to a internal temp of 145 per the fish package instructions instead of broiling.  Worked out really well.  Forgot sesame seeds and forgot to baste, so I just poured the remaining sauce over the fish after serving.  I may just use lemon juice instead of orange juice next time since I couldn't really taste the orange juice.  Thanks for the recipe!

Funny thing, I didn't know 'Roughy' came in more than one color...Mine happened to be White. This marinade is wonderful. I only left it in for about 15 minutes, and left out the ketchup. Added a little Pickled Ginger juice, and it was fantastic! Thanks so much.

Very easy recipe that is very tasty. I had a blonde moment, and accidentally used worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce, but it tasted great. I also didn't have any sesame seeds on hand, so I left those off. I will definitely be making this again, and I will try it with chicken as well.
