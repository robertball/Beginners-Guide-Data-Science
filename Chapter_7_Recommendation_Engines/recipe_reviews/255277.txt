Having used the foil method for a while now, I can vouch this is a great way to cook bacon, relatively unattended.  Chef John improves, of course, on the standard oven foil method by introducing the simple idea of making valleys to collect most of the grease.  Thank you, Chef John, for all your wonderful cooking ideas and recipes!

If I could give this a higher rating I definitely would!! I LOVED IT AND WILL USE IT ALWAYS!!! It worked like a charm, but my biggest problem was the pinch and fold for the foil. My fingers just couldn't do it with my arthritis so I had to do the old method of accordian folding. It took longer but it worked none the less. Thanks so much Chef John for putting this as a recipe. I would've been lost without it!! I'd heard about baking bacon but I'd never done it. It sure made cooking a pound of bacon much faster, and made for everyone eating together instead of individually, excellent!

Cleanup is a breeze, and I don't get burned by splattering grease. Perfect bacon for a perfect BLT. Nice.

Bacon baked in the oven is the best. I line a 1/2 sheet pan with foil then place a baking rack on top of the foil spray the rack with non-stick cooking spray so the bacon will release from the rack when cooked easy clean up after toss the foil liner and the rack washes up easy( due to the cooking spray).

I bought a cookie sheet pan with a rack from Bed, Bath, and Beyond to cook bacon.  Definitely worth it. Keeps the bacon above the pan bottom and out of the grease , cooks both sides at once, and cleans up very quickly.  I like it better than foil, or parchment paper.

I’ve been baking bacon for 10 years, no muss no fuss but most of all no popping grease on me . I bake mine at 350  , you’ll smell the bacon in about 20 min.  Then you have to check for the chrisp that you like . Save the bacon grease for other uses like green beans.

I prefer to use a pan with a rack and just have the foil on the pan to catch the drippings while the bacon lays neatly on the rack above.

This worked great! I always cook my bacon in the oven, but never thought about doing it like this. I used the bacon to make party-sized BLT sandwiches, which were a HUGE hit~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Perfect bacon with no mess.  Be sure to save your bacon fat!  I pour it off into a small, wire closure, lidded butter/mustard/cheese crock.  Let it cool to room temp then place in the fridge.  Adds a bit of smoke flavor to stir fried noodles, veggies, or meats.

Amazing!! Best method ever for making bacon and clean up could not get any easier! For some reason I cannot cook bacon to save my life, regardless of the method, cast iron, skillet, griddle. I over cook it every time. Until today:)  I followed the directions exactly, my bacon only took 12 minutes to cook (I used thin low sodium bacon) and it came out beautifully! Thank you yet again Chef John.

This is the easiest way to cook bacon and it turns out great. Evenly cooked without the need to turn and move around a pan. Plus you can cook multiple pans for when friends come over for brunch.

This is fantastic. I can’t believe people still use a frying pan. I use an extra large cookie sheet with the heavy duty foil but don’t bother crimping it and then place the bacon on paper towels to cool. I like the flavor and texture the grease adds to the bacon while it sits and cooks in it. I do pour off the grease between batches.

I made changes! I followed your instructions to a T. It ended up with a trashed oven which required cleaning plus a burned on baking sheet. I went from a full sized microwave to a small sandwich sized appliance. I just baked a one pound pkg of bacon and it turned out perfect. How'd I do it read on. As I nuked the bacon I cut the slices in half. Place two half sheets folded paper towels on a seven inch plate crisscrossed. Place four slices (half). on paper towels cover  and nuke 3 min & 15 seconds.   After baking six slices fold the cover and place on towels already on plate. I still beat your published baking time and as far as cleaning the microwave a simple wipe down inside and you're done. No splatters , No burned on oven or baking sheet to scrub. Yes I miss my full size microwave the process would have been even quicker.

Love baked bacon.  The only thing I did differently was line a cookie sheet with foil and place a cooling rack over that to place the bacon on.  It gets extra crispy.

I've been using the oven method of bacon for a while. Thought I would try the pinched ridge version. Didn't like it. I find the oven method creates very tasty, evenly cooked bacon. This ridge method actually led to some overcooked/undercooked areas. I'm guessing not being flat in the grease let some parts get too hot? I'll go back to flat on the foil oven cooking.

I used cottage bacon and as the pieces were smaller, I could have taken the bacon out of the oven 5 minutes earlier. That said, great recipe!

Just when I thought the oven method couldn't get any better, Chef John kicks it up a notch by folding the foil accordion style. The grease drains from the bacon and there is virtually no cleanup! Perfect!
