My husband said he would be excited to have this again. I actually wasn't crazy about it until we froze it...then it was fantastic. For new bakers, a make-shift double boiler is easily concocted by placing a just smaller pot or bowl inside a little larger pot of water. I think an Oreo crust might be even better. Oh, and I just used regular Cool Whip twice instead of chocolate, no problem. Don't be intimidated by all of the ingredients, it's not hard...okay maybe a little time consuming, but worth it. Thanks for sharing!

I used regular cool whip and mixed in chocolate instant pudding mix. It turned out to be a very nice recipe that I am going to use again!

This recipe was quite good -- very rich. However, it seemed like trying to fit a gallon of milk into a shot glass.  One pie crust is in no way big enough for all of what is supposed to go into it. I had to omit one tub of whipped cream and still ended up having extra from each chocolate portion (which was fine when poured into dessert glasses and layered!)

I made this for a friend's Thanksgiving gathering. It didn't seem like it ever got very firm, but it was a huge hit with everyone who tried it. I also used the chocolate pudding mixed into my whipped topping.  My family likes the dark chocolate layer, so we made a pie with just that layer and it was wonderful. I would definitely recommend you use a deep dish pie crust if you make all three layers! The one layer pie fit perfectly into a regular pie crust. Also, substitute a chocolate cookie crumb crust and it's much better. I used chocolate animal crackers, butter, and sugar for mine.

Pretty easy to make--my local grocery store didn't have chocolate whipped topping so I added a little cocoa powder to plain whipped topping instead. My family loved it and I'm sure I'll be making it again! 
Thanks for sharing!

I just have to say that this pie was amazing! I made it exactly according to recipe, only change I made was also making a layer of white chocolate, using your ingredients and method, and dividing all three (dark, milk, white) mixtures in half to fill two chocolate graham pie crusts instead of one. Absolutely awesome! My husband doesn't care much for chocolate, but he practically ate the whole first pie by himself! I have made twice since first finding this recipe, and it is always awesome! Thanks a million!

This was really rich and tasty.  Way too much ingrediant to fit in the pie crust.  I must have done something wrong cause mine never solidified enough to layer I had to freeze each layer.

I really liked this recipe as a base - seemed to be a lot of additional steps (I suppose for presentation's sake).  Here is what I did:  I melted 5 squares of Baker's chocolate (2 dark; 3 semi-sweet) with 2 cups of mini-marshmallows and 1/3 c. of half/half cream in the microwave.  I put this in the microwave for one-minute on high.  I whisked the mixture until all of the marshmallows were dissolved.  I then refrigerated the mix for 30 minutes.  Added 2 cups of Cool Whip to the mixture.  I also added a little bit of chocolate mousse mix from Dr. Oetker (about 1/3 of a package)to help things stiffen up a bit.  Poured into prepared pie crust, topped with remaining Cool Whip.  My sister, the choc. pie connaisseur, thought that this had a really dense, chocolate flavour and would have liked a bit lighter or creamier filling.  However, I thought the flavours were spot on and the texture of the filling was almost perfect--next time, I'll cut out the Dr. Oetker (or cut it down to 2 tbsp).
