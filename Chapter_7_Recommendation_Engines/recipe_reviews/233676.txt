I've been using this for a couple years now I think. At first I wondered how much to use. The entire recipe seasons one pot of chili for me. It's the only chili seasoning I use, it's fantastic. I only use the 4 tsp of onion powder and don't add the extra 2 tsp. listed a couple lines below. It might be a misprint. I make it exactly as written but sometimes omit the bay leaf depending on if I feel like digging it out when the chili is done. It's soooo much better than store bought. I also don't always add the full tsp of cayenne pepper if I want our kids to be able to eat it but I like it that way too.

Oh man this had to have been the best pot of chili I have ever made and I'm pretty sure it had a lot to do with this mix :)  For some reason the onion powder is listed twice in 2 different amounts.  I'm just guessing a typo so I used 4 tsp. of onion powder and 2 tsp. of dried onion flakes.  Also wondering how you are supposed to incorporate 2 whole bay leaves into a seasoning mix.  I still threw one into my chili pot though.  This is a fabulous mix and I will use it EVERY time a make chili!

I substituted white sugar for the brown and left out the cinnamon.  I also added a bit of ancho chili powder as well.  Great combo of ingredients!  Thanks!

Sarah's Chili Seasoning Mix Haiku: "Used a quarter cup, to pound of beef, one can beans. Ratio was good." Made this chili seasoning mix in a large airtight jar and have found that following the basic recipe that one would find on a store-bought packet (one lb. beef, one can beans, one can diced tomatoes, and all the sauteed veggie add-ins that we like) along with 1/4 of this chili mix results in a basic, tasty chili. Thanks Sarah!

Excellent chili seasoning.  I used 4 lbs meat, 1 onion, 1 can tomato sauce, 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 cup water and 1 can black beans.  Also only used 4 tsp. onion powder.  Salt to taste.

Great recipe for homemade chili, especially if you're trying to get away from salty store bought seasoning packets. I didn't have any cayenne on hand so I omitted it and it didn't seem to affect the taste. There's just one thing I wish was mentioned in this recipe: how much meat to use. I used 2lbs coarse ground chuck, 1- 16 oz can (undrained) no salt diced tomatoes, maybe 1/2 to 1 cup of beef broth, and 1-16 oz can of dark kidney beans. Absolutely fabulous!

I made this seasoning last night I used 1/2 cup of dark chili seasoning and for the extra onion powder I used two teaspoons of onion salt. It turned out fabulous my husband kept bragging how this was the best chili ever. He says that every time but he kept saying it over and over this time!! The boys all ate it up too I made southern style corn bread and topped with cheese. Yum! Well done recipe thank you!!

I used this recipe for a double batch (2lbs ground beef) of chili and it turned out great. Probably the best seasoning recipe Iâ€™ve found yet! Definitely will use it again.

Used 1/4 cup of mix per pound of meat.  Used dried onion where onion powder was specified the second time. This will be my go to chili mix from now on.

I liked the idea of being able to diy chili seasoning, however, I did not take the "chili" flavor as one would experience using store bought chili seasoning. There was a flavor missing. Not sure what it is.

I downgraded the amount of chili powder because all I have is Indian chili powder (hotter than Mexican) and because my other half can't take too much heat, and it made an excellent batch of chili!

For the entirety of my husband's life, he has only ever liked his dad's chili.  Made the exact same way, every time.  So to say he is a hard sell is an understatement.  But when I went out on a limb and tried this seasoning recipe, his comment to me was, "make it like this from now on".  And it is quite amazing.  I turned the heat down significantly, but left the rest the same, and it was perfect for my family.  Thanks for sharing!

I pair this with Debdoozieâ€™s Blue Ribbon Chili from this site and it is simply delicious! I alter the following: 3 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp dry mustard; omit the cinnamon and bay leaf; add 1 tsp ancho chili powder and 1/4 tsp dry unsweetened cocoa. Makes 11-12 Tbs, depending how generous you measure. I use half of this recipe per 2 lbs hamburger. With the chili recipe mentioned above, I omit the black pepper and garlic salt, use one can each of tomato sauce and Rotell tomatoes and green chilis, and half of this seasoning mix. One of the easiest and best tasting chili recipes you will find!

I followed the recipe and it is delicious. Fast and simple to make...the result is some of the best chili Iâ€™ve ever made. Do not buy sodium filled packaged seasonings...this is so much better! Thank you for sharing.

Liked the flavor and used about 3/4 tbsp per lb of meat.  Liked the fact I can always have it on hand with my fresh Co-op spices.

I rehydrate guajillo chili peppers and a choice chili peppers to further enhance the, "not out of a packet" chili.  Also, I doubled the Cummin.

Not my usual chili, but it may become my go-to chili recipe.

I have never used a store bought chili seasoning mix so I wasn't sure what to expect. With all the good reviews I thought it would be worth a shot. The salt was a little overpowering. Even though I know that can be adjusted to taste this seasoning is  not for us. I did not like the taste of the chili with this.

This "Chili Seasoning Mix"  makes a chili that tastes just like chili from the school cafeteria or a fast-food restaurant. I personally like a more complex flavor in my chili, achieved with extra cumin, caramelized onions, and a selection of hot chillies. I would not make this again because it is not my taste, but I have to rate it 5 stars because it is exactly what it says it is: a replacement for the store-bought packages. I was expecting more when I very good cook I know said this made, "the best chili she had ever tasted."

Very good! halved it and only used about 3/4 of it with 1 lb beef, 16 oz tomato sauce and 29 oz chili beans.  Added a little crushed red pepper for some more heat.

Made this last week and family loved it. Great flavor, not like store bought mix. I omitted Coriander (didnt have any) and replaced the brown sugar with Agave (dietary issues). Saved this puppy and plan on using it often.
