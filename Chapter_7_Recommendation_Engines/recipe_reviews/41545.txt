Easy to make and delicious.  Use strong coffee for best taste.  Hint:  Don't use a plastic spoon to stir it.  I ended up with melted plastic bits in my first batch.

This was a little too sweet however had a lovely flavour and was thick & creamy. Next time I would reduce the sugar to a quarter cup as caramelizing the sugar intensifies the flavour. The sugar really did get stiff when the milk mixture was added but melted down again as the recipe stated. Would like to try this with chocolate as a flavouring rather than coffee.

Really good recipe! I reccomend adding a dash of salt and VERY strong coffee, the flavour was a tiny bit bland. I did use less sugar and it was sweet enough. The sugar turned hard as  rock when i added the milk but it melted after. Will definitly make again!

This wasn't very hard to make, and my family loved it! I guess it could be too sweet for some people... but not me.

While it came together until the end it is very unappetizing to look at.  Folding whipped egg whites into a hot pudding results in a white flecked brown mixture.  It's very sweet but has very little actual flavor.  I'm sorry to say I had to toss the whole thing down the disposer.  If I  do try again I won't add the egg white at the end and will use an extract or something to give it flavor.
