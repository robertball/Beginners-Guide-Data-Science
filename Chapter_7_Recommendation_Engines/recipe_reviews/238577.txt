I made this  recipe  for my family and I didn't  change anything.  It was very good, better than the box stuffing.
I will make this  again

This is a easy and delicious stuffing recipe, that's very close to the one my mom has used for decades, and her mother before her. I cut this one in half, and added a beaten egg (from her recipe) and actually used the spices instead of poultry seasoning - marjoram, nutmeg, pepper along with the thyme and sage listed. My bread was homemade low sodium white bread. It came out delightful!

I put it in the bird and skip the poultry seasoning.   Awesome, my mom did it this way forever! I never do stuffing outside the bird.

I found soft cubed bread in the bakery which made preparation a breeze for me with this. It was a little dry for our liking so I added some chicken broth. I thought this had good flavor and I will make it again.

I doubled the recipe because of our crowd. Received rave reviews from everyone. I used half white bread and half whole wheat bread, no other changes. Delicious!

Two sticks of butter and no chicken broth? Way too salty too. I didn't even eat it, just looked like bread and butter.

This is the Perfect Stuffing Recipe!!! Sage is key. Love it!!! If you would like this dish to be moist, add 1/2 to 1 cup chicken broth  or the one from the turkey.

I'm not usually a stuffing person, mt husband is, that's the only reason why I made it. But this recipe was awesome. My husband loved it too. I will definitely will be making it again next year.

Wonderful recipe!  I didn’t change a thing, except to add a little more chopped onion.  This is enough to stuff a ten pound turkey.  Perfect!
