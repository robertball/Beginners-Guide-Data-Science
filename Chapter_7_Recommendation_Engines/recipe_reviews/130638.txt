Nice addition to cranberry sauce with the raspberries. I use 1/2 cup of Splenda instead of the sugar with being diabetic and it works just fine. I like it a little tart than too sweet and Splenda takes a little less than sugar also. I cook mine for 15 minutes and it does set up nice.

This is delicious, I like to eat it traditionally on thanksgiving, but because my husband doesn't like "real" cranberries, I always have leftovers. I enjoy eating this sauce over vanilla ice cream.

I made this sauce to go over our Thanksgiving cheesecake.  What a perfect topping for this time of year.  The raspberries add a different flavor to the typical cranberry sauce.  I did scale it back to 1/2 a batch, but should have made more as it is just good with a spoon.

This was a nice combination of tart and sweet flavors. I halved the recipe to try it. It's something different from the usual toppings that you would use for ice cream, cheesecake, pound cake or anything (even pancakes or waffles). I had some over vanilla ice cream and sprinkled it with a handful of chopped walnuts. Delicious! Thanks Denise for this great recipe!

I used raw sugar instead of granulated, and I really liked it!

This is the most amazing cranberry sauce I have ever tasted! It is seriously worth a try! The only change I make is by using half white sugar and half brown sugar.

This is my husband's absolutely favorite recipe. I have made this one several times, and not only do we eat it alone, but we also serve it on Thanksgiving day,  put it on toast, ice cream, even as a cake topping.  The sky is the limit with this one. If you don't like it too sweet, I suggest starting with half a cup of sugar. Once you add the cranberries and they burst, try it and start adding more sugar until you feel comfortable with the sweetness.
