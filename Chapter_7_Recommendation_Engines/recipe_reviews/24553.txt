I doubled the amount of sesame seeds and mixed the sesame seeds into the dough.  I have tried several different flavor combos: mustard, garlic, cheddard cheese, Parmesan cheese and hot with chili powder.

I added more sesame seeds and mixed them with the flour before adding the wet ingredients. The dough so very sticky so I lightly dusted it with flour to knead. Also, I put the dough between 2 sheets of foil, I had sprayed lightly with pam and rolled it out directly on the baking sheet. Then with a pizza cutter made strips and cooked without separating them. After the cooking and cooling period, it was very easy to separate the strips. Easy and nummy!

I give this recipe three stars, because when I first put it on my board to roll it, it was all crumbly-wouldn't stay together at all. I had to add several T's. of milk to get it to stay together.
As for as taste goes, I'm baking the first sheet now.
Not at all impressed. I will not be making these again.

These snacks couldn't be easier to make!  I spooned the biscuit mix into the measuring cup and leveled off the top, and the dough was anything BUT crumbly.  I think adding some cheese or spices (cayenne maybe?) to the dough would really make these sticks great.

Blan, bla, boring. Made them twice. Came out the same both times. Needs jam to make them taste like something! Donâ€™t waste your time.
