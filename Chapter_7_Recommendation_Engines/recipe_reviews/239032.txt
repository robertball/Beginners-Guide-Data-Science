An excellent recipe. I cut this recipe in 1/2 to serve 4 adults and 1 child. I would suggest watching the baking time. The veggies did not take an hour. I would check them at 45 minutes to see if the vegetables are ready to eat. I didn't have any fresh thyme, so I sprinkled dried thyme on the veggies. The roasted vegetables were so colorful and everyone enjoyed them. This is a good way to get your kids to eat vegetables. My 6 year old granddaughter and my husband ate the squash without the usual what is that?  My family liked everything except the green apple. The green apple was a bit mushy. Next time, I will add a Honey Crisp apple and watch the baking time. I am thinking the apple would take about 15-20 minutes of baking.

This was a great recipe.  I did not use white sweet potoatoes (since I have never heard of them and couldn't find them).  I made extra and used them in other recipes.

These were very good. My son and I ate these for days without getting tired of them. The only thing I didn't like was that one of the vegetables (butternut squash, I think) got very mushed and disintegrated.  My son thought that was part of what made the dish so awesome. He's not particularly into root vegetables, so I was glad he liked this so much.  Oh, I had a hard time finding a large enough dish to roast this in. It is very bulky!

This is a huge recipe.  I cut it in half and warmed the veggies in the microwave for a couple of minutes before baking.  I also chopped the pieces closer to an inch and they were done in 30 minutes. The tartness of the granny Smith apples is a great contrast to the sweet potatoes!

Very good recipe.  You can really add any vegetables.  I used carrots, sweet potatoes, red pepper, yukon gold potatoes, onions and apples.  I would reduce the amount of oil next time.

This is an awesome recipe for all! I had never heard of white sweet potatoes but was able to find them and they were sweet like the red sweet potatoes and added a surprise to the recipe as you did not know whether you were going to bite into a yukon gold potato or the white sweet potato.  I followed the recipe and did not have a problem with any items being overcooked. I will definitely make this again and pass it on to my fellow cooks.  Renae

I followed this recipe to a t- except that I could not find white sweet potatoes, so I used red potatoes. I did find the cooking time to be accurate; the directions say to cut everything into 1& 1/2 in. pieces-those are pretty big. The butternut squash did get softer sooner, while the carrots were still pretty firm. I cooked all of the ingredients as directed, and it cme out great! My family, brothers, sisters, nieces, and nephews really enjoyed this dish!

I MADE IT WITHOUT THE BUTTERNUT SQUASH AND WHITE SWEET POTATOES BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE ANY. I ADDED RED PEPPERS, KALE, AND CHARD. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. I USED MY HOMEGROWN THYME IN IT. I WILL DEFINITELY WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN, MAYBE NEXT TIME USING KOHLRABI OR TURNIPS. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE.

Made this for the second time.  I didn't have carrots or regular potatoes so doubled up on the squash and sweet pots.  It was excellent again!
