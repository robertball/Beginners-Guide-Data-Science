I love really really easy recipes that taste absolutely amazing - this is definitely one of them. Cut back on the olive oil, and added a small knob of butter to each packet. Spuds took about 30 minutes to be cooked all the way through Delicious! PS  Don't forget to slice the flower heads off the scapes as well.

We love these potatoes, so much so that I ration the garlic scapes so I have some to use out of season.  TIP:  The mature seed pods, chopped, have great flavor.  The small green ones not so much, but do not waste them.

We had never had garlic scapes before so when I saw them at the Farmer's Market I grabbed them right up!  I added a little red pepper and onion to the potatoes (for color and flavor) and we loved them!  I also used I can't believe it's not butter spray in place of the oil.

This was the best use, to date, of the garlic scapes we grew in our garden!  I made it exactly as written, except for using russet potatoes instead of red potatoes. My husband cooked them for about 30 minutes and the potatoes and scapes were tender and totally delicious! We will definitely make it again with our remaining scapes.

I used fingerling potatoes and did not chop them.  Wonderful!  Easy!  Will repeat.
