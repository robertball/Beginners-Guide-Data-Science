I used pre-made frozen Pillsbury pie dough crust! thaw frozen dough 4 pie crusts and using 2 crusts rolled together  thinly  then line the bottom of a medium cookie sheet with the two thoroughly blended together shaped into about a 2 inch x 4 inch square block wrap tightly making sure I have one made for the top and one for the bottom of my apple slice! After  pressing each crust (2) together place both separately wrapped in cellophane blocks of pastry into the fridge for 1/2 to 1 hour. then roll to 1.8th inch thick place in 8-9 inch W x 13.5-14 inch cookie sheet ! pour in filling of any kind and top with last pastry crust and bake at 425 degree pre-heated oven for 20 minutes to ensure bottom of crust does not get soggy! Turn down oven to 350 degrees and bake until lovely, bubbly
and light golden !

I've seen an almost identical recipe on another site, but it included a glaze (confectioner's sugar, vanilla extract and milk or lt. cream) to be spread over the top while it's still hot.  I thought this crust was very bland; I prefer a buttery crust.  The filling is also bland even though I added more ground cinnamon and also ground nutmeg.  I won't be making this again, sorry.

Add a thin layer of corn flakes on top of bottom crust. It absorbs the liquid and saves the bottom crust from getting soft and mushy.

Reminded me of my grandmother's apples slices. I made a few changes based on my recollection of her rendition. I added the zest of one lemon and cut the water in half and made up the difference with extra lemon juice. I also dotted the upper crust with little pieces of softened butter (about two Tbsp) and sprinkled it with about two Tbsp of superfine sugar. Next time I'll increase the recipe by one and a half times as I thought the ingredients were a bit sparse for a 9x13 pan. Grandma's were thicker as I recall. Great recipe, thanks for taking me back to my childhood!

I just pulled these out of the oven a few minutes ago.   Holy cow, fantastic.  I followed the recipe but used leaf lard.  Probably the best crust I've ever made.  I can't wait to make these again with raspberries or figs.  My wife said there most likely wouldn't be any left by morning.  lol

I would let the apples sit for a few minutes to bring out the juice of the apples. I also changed the recipe to accommodate 18 servings so that it would fit in a jelly roll pan.

It's my Mom's recipe, so of  course I love it. Makes enough to serve a group and have leftovers. So, so, good.
