Steel mill chili haiku: "easy and tasty. Only small swap that I made, frozen corn for canned." I didn't want to use a full 15 oz can of corn (I think beans or meat should be the star of chili, not to far nutritionally-inferior, but humble, filler that is corn) so I used about 1/2 c. frozen. Otherwise, followed recipe letting it simmer longer and serving with our favorite scoopy corn chips. Yum, what can I say - 2 year old ate it voraciously, and the adults ate it with the addition of hot sauce.

The recipe didn't say to drain the black beans and corn, but I did. I really believe this recipe could have benefitted from another can of tomatoes. I used fire roasted because it's all I had, but next time I will add another can of regular diced tomatoes as well. Instead of buying the chili package mix I used 3 T. of Chili Seasoning Mix II from this site. I enjoyed this chili; I just think it needs more liquid.
