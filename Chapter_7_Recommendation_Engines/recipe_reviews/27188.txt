This recipe is just fine but as French woman and a professionel French Chef currently teaching culinary arts at a Community College I often have to distinguish between a crepe' and a pancake. The difference is in the application, to formalise this recipe to a real crepe, use 1 Whole Egg and 1 Egg Yolk, Non-fat (skim) milk and melted butter.
A crepe should have a carmelly taste (oil prevents this) and try to use crepe pan very hot and cook the paper thin batter for one minute and flip for thirty seconds and keep war while doing the others.I should add that it is important to sift all flour, even when it states presifted for it has solidified in the package. This is best done by holding a fine mesh sieve at least twelve inches above the bowl to provide air. Always measure after sifting. To avoid mess, do this by placing a large bowl in a clean and dry sink. When this very basic procedure is followed to the letter, then all of the subsequent ingrediant additions will benefit. Baking, like cooking is an art form and when done with love and skill, then Heaven is within reach!

These are excellent! I added 2 tsp. vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon. I also put mixture in blender instead of whisking which helps. I used 2 sauces inside: Sauce A. 1 1/2 c. blueberries, 1 tb. cornstarch, and enough water to cover bottom of a pan. Bring to a boil, stirring until creates a nice blueberry sauce. Sauce B: 8 oz. cream cheese and gradually add fruit juice (i had leftover from a fruit salad I made but any juice would work) until comes to a desired sauce consistency. These 2 sauces combined on these crepes are delicious! My husband and daughter loved them!

All aunts, uncles, and cousins on husband side of family live in Paris. We visit often and I live on crepes for our entire visit. Our family has taught me how to spot the good crepe stands and this recipe reproduces a great crepe.  One key is to make sure your batter is "runny" enough that you can move it around your pan before it sets up.  If it's too thick you cant get a nice thin crepe.  Great recipe!

Delicious and EASY!  This recipe has been used in my family for generations so we've learned a couple of tricks.  1. I don't believe we've ever refrigerated.  The batter's already cold from the milk so why bother?  2. Spray down the skillet with cooking oil lightly and drop just a tiny bit of butter in the center.  When the butter begins to bubble, the skillet is hot enough to start making crepes.  3. If you have any issues with crepes sticking, just spray lightly again.  Once you get going there's no need to add more oil to the skillet.  4.  The thinner the better, so try to get them as thin as you can!  5.  Flip it when it starts to look like the top is setting.  this will keep it from burning.  6. The first crepe is always a mess up.  That one should come off the skillet and immediately be eaten by you.  7. Make it your own.  It's pretty hard to mess these up so experiment (vanilla, cinnamon, brown sugar, peanut butter, etc) and just add enough milk or flour to give it the right consistency.  I've started using vanilla flavored, vitamin infused soy milk  instead of milk and I eat them with berries to make it a little healthier since I consume these pretty frequently.

One of the easiest, and best crepe recipes around!  If you are pressed for time, use a whisk and bowl instead of a blender; substitute butter for the oil, and you are ready to cook in about 2-3 minutes.  Normally though, try and let the flavour & consistancy develop by standing.

This is a good recipe for basic crepes which I have used often.  For those times when I want a sweeter, dessert-type crepe, I substitute  standard yellow cake mix for the flour, since it contains just the right amounts of sugar and vanilla flavoring.  The result is a lovely, delicately-flavored dessert crepe.

So delicious! I made these for dessert and didn't feel like refridgerating them for an hour so I just made them right away. A yummy addition is to buy a bag a frozen mixed berries, thaw a bowful out in the microwave for 50 seconds, and use a blender to beat with cool whip. Add a scoop of ice cream and it makes a great dessert!

Very good crepes. I like them slightly sweet so I added 1 Tablespoon sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. I used butter flavored PAM cooking spray and about 1/4 cup for each crepe.

Super easy and not greasy! This recipe will replace the one I've been using for years and years. I used whole wheat pastry flour. We stuffed them with cottage cheese and fresh stawberries. A little powdered sugar never hurt either!

I haven't tried this recipe, but I love preparing crepes for breakfast. The recipe I use is slightly different: 1 egg, 1 cup flour, 1 cup milk, 1/4 cup water, 1 pinch salt, 2 tablespoons oil, 1/4 teaspoon vanilla (only for desert crepes). My daughter loves hers filled with cheddar cheese and ham. We like ours filled with banana and covered with whipping cream. My favorite filling is: 2 pealed and sliced apples sauteed in 2 tablespoon butter; when it starts to get brown add 1 teaspoon powdered cinnamon, 1 teaspoon brown sugar, cover and cook slow flame 'till apple is tender (add a little water if needed). Fill the crepes with the apples and cover with whipping cream. Delicious!

I also did not wait an hour, but these were perfect! Excellent taste, great texture, my kids and husband couldn't get enough. I had a large pan, so I used 1/3 cup and they were the perfect thickness.

I haven't seen anybody put strawberries as their topping so I thought I would share! I mix a bit of powdered sugar with cream cheese for the filling. For the topping I slice strawberries and sprinkle sugar on top and let sit. Sugar turns to a syrup. Then just pour on top! Best crepe ever!!

wonderful crepes!  I've been making crepes for years- I was raised on them. Mom calls them paper thin pancakes.  I've always used my grandma/mom's recipe. It's different - you use sugar, no oil and do not have to let the batter set.   I decided this recipe is better! They come out perfect and are simple to make.  Make sure you use a 10 inch nonstick skillet and 1/4 cup of batter. Remember the smaller the pan- the thicker the crepe. They are supposed to be paper thin.  I will be using this recipe from now on. Thank you!

FANTASTIC and very easy recipe!  I just used it for a large baby shower so we could have a crepe bar and it was an absolute hit. Thanks!

FYI: 10 times the recipe makes exactly a gallon of batter... Yes, I was busy over the stove =)

Mmm Mmm Good.  Exactly the same as my Jewish Mom's recipe for blintzes.  Fill with a mixture of cottage cheese, eggs and sugar and bake or fry again to cook the egg.  Serve with sour cream and your favorite jam, preserve or jelly.

This recipes is incredible easy and impressive. Every single crepe turned out! I have been making a lot of spinach/goat cheese crepes. Pour the batter into your pan and let one side cook. Flip and then add a bunch of fresh spinach on top with crumbled goat cheese. Once the other side is cooked I flip each side of the crepe to make a pocket and let the goat cheese inside melt. Delicious!

I found this recipe about 5 days ago. Now I'm addicted to them, I made an apple filling by just slicing up 2 apples, adding sugar and cinnamon and that't it. I made apple crepes by filling the crepes like a burrito. Entire family love em. Oh yes, I'm a 40 year old man, so anyone can make these.

Almost perfect, but one ingredient is missing from the classic: 1 to 2 Tablespoons of powerdered sugar in the batter!  This is per Joy of Cooking, for sweet, rather than savory crepes.  Also, to serve, a bowl of powdered sugar with a spoon for folks to help themselves.  If you want to go for truly decadent, rather than healthy, add a dab of butter before cooking each crepe. The melted butter plus powdered sugar added at the table is ... divine!

I used butter instead of vegetable oil and substituted 1/3 cup of the flour with white whole wheat flour.  The kids gobbled up the whole batch in minutes.  Yum.

The best recipes for crepes so far. I haven't had a need to explore for a better recipe. Will continue with this since it is the family's favorite. Thank you for sharing as you made my crepe-making better.

These make a really delicious and healthy breakfast or snack: the trick is to use oat flour in place of white flour (I grind my own in my coffee grinder). You can also reduce the egg yolks by 1 (so use 1 egg + 1 egg white), and halve the amount of vegetable oil without losing taste. Then, after cooking the crepes, add 3 T light cottage cheese and a few dollups of low-sugar strawberry preserves. Roll up and dust lightly with powdered sugar--beautiful and SO good!

Super easy and as a crepe should be. I didn't bother refrigerating (the purpose of crepes is a quick, no-hassle dessert) but they still turned out wonderfully.

Great recipe. I love that it uses less fat than most. I used white kernel whole wheat flour and only waited 40 minutes on the batter since I was in a hurry. They turned out great. Thanks.

These are so simple and delicious we have them all the time - savory and sweet.

The only add-in I didn't notice in any other reviews that I like to use are assorted extracts depending on my mood... almond, orange, etc

I love crepes, and this is such a perfect base recipe! If you're pressed for time, you can just use an electric mixer on a low to medium setting instead of letting the batter rest for a few hours. So good!

Oh my god!!! I have always wanted to try this at home because the crepes from the Japanese restaurant I always got them from was too money consuming.  =]  I like eating them by folding a big circle of crepe in half, then spreading nutella all over it, scoop chocolate icecream into it, along with strawberry, banana, and kiwi, then rolling it into a cone.  Delicious

Very good.  Next time I would add a little more milk to make them a bit runnier.  Just used a whisk and didn't let them set in the fridge at all.  Had some small lumps but didn't affect the taste.  Also turned them Green for St.Patrick's day and the kids loved them.

I've been making crepes for many years, always following the Betty Crocker recipe.  I was looking for something a little quicker, and found this recipe with great reviews.  Well...not a great idea.  The crepes came out very doughy (followed recipe to a T), they stuck to the pan, and did not have a very good flavor (the dog liked it, though).  I wish I could give a good review, but since I had to throw out the batter and start all over with my trusty BC recipe and wasted time and ingredients, I can't.  Hope everyone else has better results.

I have never made crepes before, but had them many times...these were fantastic and are probably one of the best breakfasts I have made. The trick really was to thin out the batter and to ensure it was uniformly spread out in the pan. I a PC dark choc. spread around the whole thing, then placed fresh sliced strawberries down the centre, rolled it up and then added a few swirls of maple syrup!!! I have a major sweet tooth, but my boyfriend raved too!

These were easy to make and the consistency was perfect.  However, I tend to like my crepes more flavorful. I can't believe I'm about to admit this, but the ones at IHOP are freakishly flavorful, and what I really want to aspire to make one day.  These were a similar consistency, but the flavor just isn't there.  I would suggest using butter instead of oil (which of course makes them less healthy), but I think it would make them taste better.  Next time I make these, I may add vanilla, cinnamon, sugar, etc to see if I can spruce them up a bit.

I LOVE this crepe recipe! I tried a few from this site, and like this one the best. I usually use whole wheat flour for at least 1/2 of the flour called for (sometimes all whole wheat), and so I also use a little extra milk and oil - and them come out great!  Thin, chewy, and tender - perfect! I've found that putting it in the fridge makes them better - not so puffy and hard to get off the pan, so if you have some time, DO refrigerate the batter!  After sitting in the fridge, give it a gentle little stir by hand to redistribute the ingredients. Also, I also tried once using a gluten-free flour mix with soy milk to make it for a friend, and with a few slight tweaks in measurements - they were VERY good!  ...can I just say again, I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!  :)

These were SOO easy to make and they turn out so perfect! They are very light and thin and you can put whatever you like in them! I put the batter in the freezer for about 15 minutes and it turned out fine. Crepes are always loaded with too much sugar and cream. I'm never buying them again! I filled one with banana halves and a cream cheese sauce (2 tsps cream cheese, 1/3 cup milk, 2 tsps sugar and 1 tsp vanilla heating over medium heat and stirring until it thickens) and dusted it off with powdered sugar. I filled another one with  banana halves, grated semi sweet chocolate and cashew nuts bits (pounded in a bag). They were SOOO good! Thanks for this wonderful recipe Erin!

This recipe was so easy and so delicious. Cooking them took a bit of practice. The trick is to not use too much oil and to start tilting the pan as soon as you start pouring the batter.

I can't believe it.  I made crepes AND they were good!  :P  Like others have said, plan on the first couple being test runs, but by my third one I figured out batter/heat/time for my stove (about 1 - 1 1/2 mins each side, with my heat setting at 4).  I added vanilla and cinnamon as the first review lists, but it wasn't nearly enough for me so next time I'll add more.  I keep hearing to use a filling of nutella and bananas so next time I make them I'll be doing this.  I am a beginner cook.  If I can make these, anyone can!  ^5 for this recipe.  It challenged my comfort levels and the food came out a success!

A wonderful and super easy crepe recipe! I followed the recipe to a T for the first half of the batter, including refrigeration time, and they turned out perfect! I filled the first half of the crepes with ham, egg and cheese and even my crepe-hating hubby ate them! Then I added about 3 T powdered sugar to the remaining 1/2 of the batter. They turned out with the same consistency as the first 1/2, but the sweet touch was exactly what they needed when filled with strawberries and fat free cool whip.

Definitely a keeper! I can't wait to have my Mom and sis over for a crepe party to try more fillings!

This recipe is awesome!  It was my first time making crepes and it was so easy.  I made my own filling.  I just diced some potatoes, onion and mushrooms and sauteed them in olive oil and butter, added some crumbled, cooked bacon, some chopped, fresh spinach and some salt and pepper during the last couple minutes of cooking.  It turned out great.  Had enough batter to make dessert crepes with some strawberries, bananas and whipped cream.  Delicious!  My husband loved both of them.  He bragged to the guys at work about them.  I will definitely make them again!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I followed the instructions of the French chef from the first comment! I figured you can't go wrong following the French chef! It turned out absolutely perfect, I sautéed mushrooms with spinach and garlic salt, added feta cheese... As soon as I flipped it, I put the toppings in and turned the stove off, let it rest for that last minute. yummy!!

I love this recipe with the changes that another reviewer said:  One egg and one egg white + replace oil with melted butter.  4 stars because of the changes to the recipe that I incorporated.  Love making these.

I'm French Canadian. I go to Montreal often and to France every other year. This is how crepes are made. Simple and not sugary (except for whatever you choose to put inside.) A weekly fare at our house. Wouldn't change a thing to this one.

Perfect. I used butter and this recipe made my re-seasoned crepe pan very happy. Made us all happy. Thanks!

Tried this recipe last night - easy and the crepes were yummy.  I used butter to grease the pan and I think that perhaps they browned a bit better but can't compare as haven't tried greasing with oil.  In any event, this is now my "go to" recipe & I've tried quite a few!

I thought while I was cooking them, that they looked really greasy. Soaked up some of the extra oil by using paper towels. I was afraid since they didn't look floury white that it would taste too oily, but it tasted great! Such a great breakfast.

Very delicious crepes! I did substitute the milk for skim milk because that is all I had on hand, but they still turned out great! My husband and two picky eaters devoured them! I love crepes because there's so much you can do with them. Will definitely be using this recipe over and over again.

I made a sweet and savory version.  I used the original recipe for the savory and added indian butter chicken I had left over and normally just but whatever protein I have left over from the night before.  For the sweet version I used  a little vanilla and sugar to make it sweeter.  For the filling, I used strawberry jam, cream cheese & some sugar.  This recipe was a little dense for crepes but it still has an EXCELLENT flavor.  :)

Thank you for sharing this recipe. I have twin toddlers, one loves any kind of fruits and the other eats carbs and sweets almost always. I made this in a matter of minutes. I followed the recipe, added some vanilla, just eyeballed it and less than half a teaspoon of powdered sugar. I did not even have time to refrigerate it. It worked great. I don't have any form of syrup or sauce so I used a little bit of grape jelly, lined it with banana slices, topped it with whipped cream, rolled it and voila! Both kids loved it. They are only 4 yrs old and they both had 2 pcs each. I had fruit, desert, and carbs all in one. The other piece had orange slices in it too. Again, thanks for sharing.

Loved these, no muss no fuss. Added vanilla into the batter. For stuffing I used peeled apples + honey sauteed in butter for just the right amount of tang.

The most I know about crepes, I learned off of Talledega Nights.  I havent eaten any nor have I made any, so I didnt have anything to measure these against, except that my family inhaled them.  They were pretty easy and very tasty.  I added vanilla and cinnamon to the batter.  I sprayed the pan once, but put a little pat of butter in the skillet with each crepe.  My filling was a combo of whipped topping w/blueberries, and I topped with a blueberry syrup concoction, along with another little dab of whipped topping.  Then I sprinkled a little Powdered Sugar on top.  These were very good and looked great too.

Undeniably THE BEST crepe recipe. I only let it sit 15 minute, not 1 hour, and it was fine. Although my crepe pan took 1/2 cup batter per crepe, so this amount only produced 5 crepes for me. I will double the recipe next time, it was awesome!

I added a total of two pinches of salt, 3/4 T sugar. If I don't have powdered sugar to sprinkle on top, top with sugar. I spread cream cheese on crepe, then ice cream, chocolate syrup and bananas.

Would love more details about how to use this recipe for a crepe bar.  How far ahead can you make the crepes, how to serve them (without having them stick to each other), etc.?  It sounds like such a great idea but need help with the logistics.

I followed advice from the french pastry chef, who had replaced the vegetable oil with melted butter. Also, used a egg and one egg yolk. Only refrigerated for about 10-15 minutes. Mixture was bubbly at first, but the crepes turned out great! cooked on medium high heat. Buttered pan for the first crepe only, and had no problems with sticking.

Great Recipe!! I used the French woman's advice (1egg/1yoke and butter in place of oil).  The butter makes all the difference! I have experimented with coconut oil/vegetable oil and the caramel taste/melt in your mouth consistency was not there. Another pointer - make sure that your milk/eggs are room temperature so that the butter may blend. Otherwise, it turns into solid chunks. Sifting the flour also seems to magically make them taste better. 

As far as toppings - my favorites used so far are 1. Lingonberry jam and butter (like I-hop). You can make the Lingonberry butter by mixing whipping cream until it turns to butter, then mix in some jam. 
2. Saute peaches with butter and brown sugar and a hint of cinnamon. Then then add blueberries and whip cream.

This was a very easy recipe.  I made them and then cooled them in the fridge. I spread a thin layer of Nutella on them, added vanilla ice cream and rolled them. Then I froze them for an hour. I served them with whipped cream and chopped nuts... my family raved and it was such a simple inexpensive dessert.

We freakin love these! Total winner recipe!
I am a beginner cook trying to impress my wife. I thought crepes would be too difficult for my skills, but then I saw this recipe. I cooked them on a cast iron tortilla pan. Filled them with my homemade raspberry freezer jam mixed with cream cheese and heated. Soooo good! And she was impressed. Next, I'm going to fill them with chopped ham, scrambled eggs, onion and jalapenos, then drizzle some heavily black-peppered white gravy over the top for a breakfast dinner.

These turn out perfect for me every time! I applied some of the advice from other users and made a couple of changes, but they are still super quick to put together. I add a bit of vanilla to the batter, instead of 2 eggs I use 1 egg and 1 egg yolk, and I find cooking life is much easier to sift before measuring. Thanks for sharing!

I had never made a crepe before because it looked so intimidating and difficult.  This recipe was so simple and the crepes were delicious.  I made them for dessert so I added vanilla extract and cinnamon as another reviewer recommended.  Fantastic.

Perfect crepe recipe :) I love it.  I followed the instructions to a t, then sliced half a banana and drizzled it with chocolate, then put that inside each crepe.  Delicious.

These are fantastic! I added a little bit of vanilla as well, and filled them with garlic and herb Boursin cheese-- DELICIOUS!

Super easy. I have made them 2x now, and they are awesome. Haven't had one break yet. You can make them sweet for desert or for a dinner. I stuff them with everything. They are loved by all.

I have been using the BC recipe and I wanted something new.  I tried this recipe and it was fantastic.  We modified it by adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  My kids thought it needed more sugar, and I suggested they tried mine.  I served mine with syrup and some dusting of powdered sugar.  Another one, some cream cheese and some blackberry preserves.  Both very delicious.  I just thought that was a lot of oil and was looking for some modification.  A definite keeper.

Really easy to make, and I have never made a crepe before in my life.  Great to make when you have no idea what to make for breakfast, all the ingredients I already had in the house.  At first I thought they would be too bland but the ingredients that you fill them with make them very sweet.

My mom always made crepes when I was a child, but she made much thicker with sour cream. I made a sauce out of cream cheese and strawberry syrup and rolled it up in crepes.. My husband never tried them before, but he was absolutely in love and always asks me to make them.

These were good and I am not exactly sure how to rate them because this is the first time I made them and it was also on my brand new cookware.  The edges crisped up quite a bit, but I am thinking it was because my skillet is so big, that 1/4cup of batter didn't spread enough and therefore made the edges very skinny.  Next time I am going to try making them on the bottom of my pans, as my cookware's cookbook suggests.  Flavor-wise, they were okay.  Nothing great, but good.  I need to try them again to give them another chance before I'll adjust the rating more.

Nice basic recipe, easy to modify for your specific purpose. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom for a complex flavor and served them with a slightly sweetened cream cheese spread and fresh strawberries. Very easy!

My first time making crepe and this was easy. I added strawberry & vanilla extract a pinch of both to give it a diff taste, so my crepre came out pinkish. I used a skilled but the first didnt come out good czu I was using a big one , so whn i used the small one it was fine. Sauce, strawberry adn blueberry, 1 tbsp corn starch, some sugar, water, strawberry jam. I like the sauce .. I just forgot to get teh whip cream .. I didtn like the taste of teh crepe next time ill add some sugar to teh batter adn vanilla extract. but other than that , this is a keeper!!!!

Lovely! I didn't leave them to sit either, just mixed then cooked. I have a bigger pan so I used about 1/3 - 1/2 a cup of batter for each crepe.

I made mascarpone-cream cheese filled crepes with "Blueberry Sauce" for Valentine's Day dessert. I was forced to use olive oil, as I was out of vegetable, so they didn't brown at all. Pretty bland, but very soft. I will make again with the correct oil and possibly buttermilk

These Crepes were amazing. My family and I are stationed in Italy and our favorite place to get crepes is in Venice, which is about an hour drive for us. I followed the recipe as listed and added about a tablespoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon to the mix and filled with Nutella. The family is convinced that this is the recipe our favorite place uses. Thank you for sharing :)

YUMMO!  Never made crepes before today and this recipe is just too easy!  BTW, did NOT keep in fridge for an hour.  Just kept it in while I cut strawberries and made a sweet cream cheese mixture (1 block 1/3 less fat cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tbsp sour cream, 1 tsp lemon, 1 tsp vanilla- beat well).   I should have made a dbl batch for my family of four!  Can't wait to make this one again with different fillings!

These tasted great. If you let the pan get good and hot, then spray it with cooking spray, then pour the batter in, you shouldn't have a problem with the first one being a flop.

Simple and perfect crepe recipe. I spread softened cream cheese over half the crepe, folded it over and then drizzled over the top with wild blueberry sauce and honey.

I've never made homemade crepes before.  I generally used a modified bisquik mixture in the past.  But i am sooooo much happier with this recipe.  I used egg whites, and melted margarine instead of oil, and it turned out great!  I will use this recipe from now on.  Yumm-Yumm!

Easy and quick! I adapted this recipe with some tips from my France-loving cousin--I added a little bit of vanilla extract and cinnamon, used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour. Instead of oil, I used butter to grease the pan. I never put the batter in the fridge either, although I did let it sit for a few minutes before cooking to let the batter set. The results were wonderful.

Just tried making crepes for the first time.  This recipe is FANTASTIC!!!  The crepes have the same texture and taste as the ones I had in Europe.  I am VERY PLEASE!!  I put strawberries and bananas in mine and topped them with sugar-free syrup and a little powder sugar.  This is a very easy recipe.  Highly recommended!!

This recipe has been in my family since the beginning of time ha ha. My Oma occasionally cooks these for dinner for the family. She'll stand in front of the stove for hours. Time consuming but oh so good. Try it with ground beef. Prepare it the way you usually do, onions, garlic, spices, and then wrap it up in a crepe and drizzle some syrup over top. TO DIE FOR! Giver a go!!

I love this recipe. I've modified it to add a tablespoon of sugar and 1 tsp. of vanilla. It's the easiest thing to make, especially for me because my cooking skill is nil. The crepes come out perfectly.

Hubby requested these for breakfast for Father's Day. So simple to make. I did add 1 tsp. of vanilla. Hubby and daughter just had theirs with maple syrup but I spread cream cheese on them, rolled it up and topped it with fresh strawberries. So good!

Delicious, easy to prepare, and easy to make. They brought back fond memories of my trip to France. I could barely put the finished ones down before I ate them. I have the rest stored in the fridge (I plan to eat them for breakfast for the next week!) and they taste just as good reheated in the microwave. I'll definitely be making these again!

I normally make crepes by adding a little of this and a little of that..I am not one for recipes. I decided to try this because of its ratings and I was not disappointed! This is a recipe I will want to use again. These taste like mine when they are at their best. I can now be sure they will be perfect. ( I did add a couple of TBS sugar as I was making blintz) I think it helped them brown a little too. Thanks

One of my daughter's favorites when she comes home from college.  Of course that makes it a winner with me!  It's simple, different from a normal breakfast, and tasty.  We add fresh fruit and avoid any sugary toppings or garnish.

Shrove Tuesday is a traditional day for my family to eat crepes. I've been doing it since I was a kid, a long time ago! Serve plain with orange wedges and sugar on the table for everyone to dress as they wish. This recipe is the long lost one my dad used! So glad to have it back, with great memories, and more to make. Thank you!

Medium-high heat helps keep them from sticking to a nonstick pan.  You won't need any butter or oil.  Be patient and let them start to release themselves on the edges, then let them go the rest of the way.  They turn out a little more golden that way, but stacking them on a plate keeps them pliable.

Came out perfect replace vegetable oil with the butter and use 1 egg and 1 egg yolk also use skim milk instead, butter your pan after each one you make. These taste better the crepe shop I go to. Spread nutella, straw berries and bananas and fold in half and then another half to form a triangle. Sprinke powder sugar and alittle more chocolate syrup, like Hershey's

I have made these 2 different ways.  Exactly as described and taking another reviewers advise about making it w/1 egg and 1 egg yolk, and butter instead of olive oil.  The second way, making the changes, came out 5 stars but the way it is written came out maybe 3 1/2 stars.  The texture and taste were just a bit off and I found the batter much harder to work w/when flipping it, I basically tore it all to pieces.  But with the changes, it was absolutely perfect.  I had no problems flipping and the texture was spot on

Wonderful & easy!  I substituted a mixture of 1/2 quinoa flour & 1/2 all-purpose flour for the flour & hemp milk for the milk.  My Magic Bullet blended it all up & voila!  We made a platter of sauteed mushrooms, roasted red peppers, diced rotisserie chicken, caramelized onions, sauteed asparagus, and goat cheese, and let our guests stuff the crepes themselves!!  It was a hit :)

This was an easy recipe - I did take into consideration the review that recommended using butter and one egg and one egg yolk and sifting flour. Also I saw a suggestion for making sauces and instead of blueberries I used strawberries (quartered). After my taste testing I decided that the next time I make this I will add vanilla to the batter and I will add a small amount of sugar or sugar sub to strawberry sauce.

Yummo!

Fast and easy. I didn't let mine sit for an hour, I just mixed it all (substituting butter for oil) and made them - and it worked. I did add a little vanilla and cinnamon to the recipe.

This recipe was outstanding! I've always loved crepes and thought I should make a go at making them myself. The only thing I added was vanilla extract and some sugar. I couldn't believe how easy it was! This is definitely a keeper!

I have not tried this recipe yet (I know that is not very helpful) But I just want to say, I have made crepes in the past, and if you don't want to go out and buy all of those ingredients, then you can buy a bag of the pre made pancake mix. Take a cup of that, then add a bunch of milk so that it is a almost water like consistency. SUPER THIN makes it better! Also, instead of using water, use milk. I like using whole milk, because it still comes out thin, but it has a richer taste. The next thing you can do, to add a little bit of flavor, is add 1-2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. That gives it a more powerful, yet subtle taste that is great! Also, f you want the texture to be richer, but still be thin, add 1 egg yolk. And there you go! Just a slightly different and easier version of a crepe. Although really all you need is the pancake batter an d milk., The other stuff is optional. I hope you enjoy!

Oh, and the person who did this, needs to add on a recipe for the crepe filling, like strawberry's and cream cheese??? I don't think plain crepes would taste to great! XD

Perfect recipe; exactly what I was hoping for.  It's so easy and they are just delicious (especially filled with dulce de leche as I used to eat them in Argentina).

Lovely recipe. As one of the other reviewers stated, the pan should be hot before pouring the batter.

Crépes are so simple to make but also so simple to get wrong. This recipe gives the perfect consistency and great taste! I substituted the vegetable oil with coconut oil, which gave the crépes a little flavor. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Just like Grandma used to make, it's quite a knack to get them thin enough but by the fourth they were going pretty smooth.

These were great and soversatile! I added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla for some more flavor, and a touch of mozzarella cheese in the center of each crepe. I also used about half whole wheat flor and half all purpose flour to add a little healthiness. They were still amazing! There is so much you can do with these but even as is they would be fantastic! Thanks so much for this recipe!

Amazing!  I have always wanted to make crepes but thought they had to be difficult.  When I saw this recipe it seemed so easy.  I watched a you tube video on it and then attempted my crepes.  Wow....easy and delicious! My partner was amazed!  Will make again and again.  Maybe will try butter next time.

These turned out great! Definately going to make them again.  I doubled the recipe for my two teens, and I added two pinches of cinnamon and 3 teaspoons of vanilla.  The end result was fantastic.  I covered mine in powdered sugar, which was fitting for the winter season, and then displayed them on a Christmas platter.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have been using this recipe for years... it's simple and fool proof! Making the crepes thin and pretty does take some practice. Usually I toss the first three as they're too greasy and I use them just to soak up the excess oil anyway. There is hardly ever a need to add more oil to the pan unless you're doing large batches - minimal is best. Thanks for this classic! I will continue to use this for years to come.

My first time to make crepes and it was fantastic! They didn't turn out perfect because I substituted all- purpose flour with whole wheat flour & added a bit of cocoa powder but my son loved them especially when I made the nutella-banana crepes.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, will definitely make them again!

This is the first recipe (from cooking books, blogs, magazine, EVER) that I didn't have to change anything. It was so easy to make these crepes, they tasted great.  I added a little bit of vanilla extract for extra flavor.  They were great!

I have never had crepes before and decided this recipe would be best. They were delicious. I followed the recipe and added strawberry syrup (from this website). I definitely think the strawberry syrup is what made the crepes really good. Make sure to cook for threw all the way, a few of mine I cooked really quickly and they were too bready tasting. Great Recipe!

In South Africa we would refer to these as pancakes, and what awesome pancakes they were. 10/10. They are normally served warm,  sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, then rolled up,  I perfer the combination of sugar and lemon juice. Either way, a hit in my family. I doubled the quantity and that alone fed my 2 teenage boys, so next time I'll triple it. Super easy to make, and even easier to eat. Thanks Erin

Yum!  This was my first time attempting made-from-scratch crepes and this recipe was really delicious.  Both sets of Moms loved their crepes at our Mothers Day Breakfast.  We served them with fresh whipped cream and raspberries and I look forward to making these again...there are so many fun things you can do with crepes!

Couldn't be easier!

I added almond milk instead of regular, also a tsp of cinnamon.  First time ever making at home, it was fantastic!  Will definitely make again and again and again!

These ended up pretty good, but at first I did what others said and didn't let the batter sit. Big mistake! After the first three crepes turned out crispy and filled with tiny bubbles (there was no delicate web pattern on these!), I put the batter straight in the fridge for an hour. The rest of them, done the way the recipe says, were still a bit bubbly, but the web pattern tried to make a comeback. Results were tasty, but not a great texture. 

Perhaps those that didn't experience what I did whisked theirs, whereas I did blend mine, which probably caused the bubbling. Letting it sit in the fridge helped, but it seems I over-blended it. Maybe the batter was too thin, too, as I've never had such thin crepe batter before.

Simple but perfect for both sweet and savory crepes. I didn't use a blender, just whisked the ingredients by hand.

Very good!  The only reason this didn't get 5 starts is because I made a few smal changes (added vanilla, sugar, and cinnamon).

Wonderful, I am glad I finally tried to make these.I made a filling from leftover pork roast with gravy. Cut the pork up into small pieces add leftover gravy and a good shot of Madera wine or Sherry. Heat it all up, thicken with a little corn starch desolved in water. Add some sour cream and you have a very tasty filling. I also added some frozen peas to it for the veggie part. It was good enough for company.

A great simple and easy recipe. I made it for dessert added oranges, yogurt, rolled it up and drizzled chocolate syrup all over it. It was fantastic.

This receipe is perfect.  I use butter in my pan instead of oil.  Nothing is better than just PURE MAPLE SYRUP on them, you don't need anything else for breakfast crepes.  Serving them for dinner dessert, then use all your fruits and whipped cream.

I made these for the first time and they came out perfect. I added sugar and vanilla as others suggested and did not refrigerate. I filled them with crushed pineapple, bananas, & sliced strawberries (in a sugar syrup). Then topped with reddi wip and a drizzle of chocolate syrup. Absolutely delicious!  My son is very picky and said it was his new favorite snack.  Thanks Erin.

Delicous as written.  I served mine for a weekend breakfast folded in half, spread with Nutella, then folded into quarters, topped with sliced strawberries and bananas with a dollop of fresh whipped cream, powedered sugar and a drizzle of chocolate sauce.  Absolutely amazing.

Excellent & Easy! 
Did not chill these at all and were still perfect.  Added vanilla as someone else suggested and that was the perfect touch.  
Made these for my aunt & uncle for breakfast today and they loved them.  Pretty sure these will be requested on the regular over here now. 
Thanks for the recipe!

Very good basic recipe. I made it exactly as directed, and my only complaint is that it's a bit bland. That's not the worst thing for crepes, since they're sort of meant to be a blank palette for whatever flavors you want to add, but I did wish for a little more flavor from them. This will be a good base for experimenting, though.

First time I made crepes and with my 11 year old helping it was easier than I anticipated. Added 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and some cinnamon to the blender. We have excellent non stick pans that worked like a dream for these. First one came out perfect as did all the rest. We found spray oil worked much better than butter and was easier to reapply. Enjoyed with Nutella, berry compote and whipped cream for a special (decadent) breakfast. Really delicious and easy - a definite new favorite in our house.   One question, someone mentioned freezing leftovers, but any suggestions on how to store and reheat? Thanks for a great recipe!

I've made this recipe several times. I don't refrigerate and I use a whisk as others have suggested. Fill the crepes with sliced bananas and chocolate sauce, strawberries and whipped cream, or cherry pie filling with whipped cream on top. Excellent.

Very good and simple crepe that can be filled with either sweet or savory meats and/or sauces. I used a whisk since I didn't have a blender on hand and they turned out just fine. I followed the recipe exactly as stated otherwise. I actually like them a tiny bit thinner so I'll be thinning them with a touch more milk next time. Wonderfully easy recipe!

In reading the reviews I almost didn't follow the recipe. I almost added sugar so glad I didn't. I followed the recipe exactly as written. We loved these! We filled ours with vanilla ice cream, bananas and chocolate syrup. Out of this world. Can't wait to have them again tonight. If you are looking for a versatile great crepe recipe this is the one. With the first bite of whatever you fill it with you can tell it can be made to be savory or sweet.

Sadly, my crepes turned out thick, undercooked (or burned), and tasted like flour. I'm not sure if that's a reflection of this recipe (followed to a T) or if I'm just an awful cook. In either case, for future users of this recipe, note that (1) the batter ends up a little too thick to spread . . . so either add less flour or add an extra egg and (2) so it doesn't taste just like flour, add 1 tbsp of sugar in addition to the pinch of salt. I made these changes for my second batch and they turned out a lot better. :)

I made these this morning and followed other's advice by adding 1 Tb sugar and 1 tsp vanilla and they were great! I also did not refrigerate them for one hour with no problem. My mom made crepes growing up, but I never have so I had a few practice ones to start out, but this was recipe was great and easy. No need to look for a better recipe.

This recipe worked exactly as it said it would.  So super simple, loved it.  I've never made crepes before and just came back from a vacation in Hawaii where they served apple-cinnamon crepes at the breakfast buffet and I thought I'd give it a try.  I peeled and sliced up 10-12 braeburn apples, sauteed them in butter, cinnamon and brown sugar.  Then, one by one I made the crapes and spooned the apples onto them and rolled them up like mini burritos. As I went, I used less batter and perfected the thinness of the crepe.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I was always intimidated by crepes, but they are my husband's favorite breakfast food, so I decided to give them a try.  These are wonderful and soooo easy.  I added a touch of powdered sugar and a splash of vanilla extract.  The kitchen smelled fabulous.  Before the hour of refrigeration was up, my husband was stirring, but no matter, even after only about 30 minutes in the fridge they set just fine.  I know this recipes says it makes 8 servings, but it actually fed the two of us perfectly.... is that bad to admit?

After having crepes in France I had to make them. This recipe is simple and tastes close to the French restaurant crepes. I add vanilla to the batter, and use butter to fry them up in a fritata pan. Nutella and banana slices are my favorite combination, but my husband loves the gruyere cheese and turkey.

This is a very easy recipe and the ingredients you can easily find in your kitchen.  Doubled the recipe, added some sugar and vanilla. Put in the freezer for 15 minutes instead of refrigerating it for 1 hour. I did spread mango jam plus a slice of ripe mango and drizzled it with homemade cinnamon syrup from this site.  Very yummy

Excellent recipe - I added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract and filled with (thawed) frozen strawberries and topped with whipped cream.  Easy, inexpensive and every bit as tasty as a local breakfast chain restaurant.

I can never really eat pancakes because they are so thick and make me quite full. I love crepes! You can fill them with pretty much anything. I filled mine with some homemade apple pie filling and mixed some cream cheese with some honey and put that in there as well. It was delicious!

You made this a usefull recipe for newbies. It is good to draw in otherwise timid cooks to try new things.
I ran out of tortillas and used some crepes as enchilada wrapings. Now thats all I use.

I love these. I used a hand mixer and let the batter stand for about 10 minutes. I've always cooked mine for only about 30 seconds to a minute on each side, I've never tried cooking for 5 minutes on each side so I'm not sure how that would work out. This is a great basic recipe, I got 8 picture perfect crepes and filled them with bananas and strawberry jelly cooked up in the same pan for about 3 minutes.

These crepes were delicious! I didn't wait the hour for the batter to set, and used whole wheat flour instead and they still turned out great! I highly recommend the cream sauce and blueberry compote suggested by another reviewer. This was my first time making crepes and the recipe was easy and fun. YUM!

These were quite good, though a little plain for my taste.  On my second batch, I added about a teaspoon of sugar, which rounded out their flavor in savory crepes.  For the sweet crepes, I added some vanilla as well.  My favorite filling: a little lemon zest, a little lemon juice, a sprinkled teaspoon of white sugar and a bit of brown sugar.  I've also frozen a few crepes for quick meals later on.

So easy to make.  Threw in all the ingredients without mixing them, and only mixed them when I'd finished adding all of the ingredients.  I did not refrigerate the batter and it did not seem to make a difference.  This recipe seems to be foolproof.  I grated some emmenthal cheese and after turning the crepe, just sprinkled the cheese on top before folding the crepe over it.  Fantastique.

These were great - delicious and very easy to make!
I made them with the substitutions of whole wheat flour, soy milk, and olive oil.  I also added a splash of vanilla and a spoonful or so of sugar (didn't measure these additions, sorry).  
I didn't have the time to refrigerate them at all, but they still turned out perfectly!

Absolutely wonderful.  I can't wait to have people over for a crepe party! They are going to think I am such a talented cook when they taste these, but they were so easy. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a little sugar and vanilla to the mix. I stuffed them with the filling from the Sour Cream Apple Pie on this site, and topped with a drizzle of maple syrup. I won't be buying these at my favorite breakfast restaurant anymore, since they are so easy to make, and use ingredients that I always have around.

This is the best crepe recipe I've ever had! I doubled it and added 1 T of sugar per recipe and a couple shakes of cinnamon. I used them to make a crepe breakfast buffet. I laid them out with whipped cream, cherries, sweetened strawberries, blueberry spread, home canned peaches, chocolate sauce, butterscotch sauce, and caramel. I loved how easy they were to make. I wouldn't suggest using a Nordic Ware crepe pan (where the top is rounded and you dip it into the batter.) I started out with that but this batter is far too thin. A plain old frying pan worked fine.

Wonderful recipe. I used milk and egg at room temperature. 
Serving suggestions:
1. Homemade chocolate syrup (cocoa powder, little heavy cream, milk, sugar, little cornstarch) + chopped fresh figs - YUM!!
2. Homemade chocolate syrup + sliced banana
3. Blueberry syrup as suggested by another reviewer (blueberries, sugar, cornstarch) + sliced strawberries
4. Homemade chocolate syrup + sliced strawberries
5. Or just maple syrup

Delicious, and so easy.  Usually, I have to throw out the first one or two crepes, I don't know if it was the recipe, or if I finally learned how to make a crepe, but they were perfect beginning to end.

Perfect and delicious.  Made some sweet and some savory (for supper).  Do not change a thing.  Thanks for the post.

Easy, good and practically no clean-up! The kids loved them and had fun choosing what to put in them. A keeper!

Very easy and worked very well.  Filled them with nutella, sliced strawberries, and whipped cream.  Added 1 TBSP sugar and a little cinnamon to the batter.  Delicious.

GREAT recipe.  Very basic, which is how crepes should be.  EASY to make.  This is a keeper.  You can always add flare to your filling but the crepe itself should be simple.  THIS is how it should be.

Awesome!  Very authentic.  I had a hard time finding the right pan.  Stainless steel scalded, my non-stick was too non-stick, so I used my flat griddle with a mold to keep it from running off.  I will be investing in a crepe pan soon!  This is going to be our new Christmas morning tradition.

I made them for my boyfriend and he said they were good,but not as good as his mom's and we all know that mom's cooking is better. I grew up on pancakes as a kid but after making these I now eat crepes, I wouldn't change anything about this recipe, thank you

This was a great easy recipe.  I used butter instead of oil.  Then I tried something fun for tea parties, kids or whoever!  I cooked the crepe batter in a quesadilla maker.  The crepes were in the shape of triangles.  After the maker was very hot, and I poured the batter into each section I flipped the triangles so it would cook the other side really well.  Try it and enjoy...

excellent.. i as well, added sugar and vanilla.. a great savory crepe as follows:

spread NUTELLA (hazelnut spread) over crepe, then fold crepe in a triangular shape or simply roll, then stuff with strawberries & bananas.  drizzle with fudge, dollop of whipped cream and serve with vanilla ice cream.  one of the easiest savory crepes and quite delicious!

YUM! I tried a different crepe recipe last night and it was strange and rubbery. These crepes were easy & came out perfect! I made them for lunch and filled them with ricotta, a little parmesan, and chicken pieces cooked in chicken broth and good marinara sauce.

Try these... you'll like 'em!

This was my first attempt at crepes.  They turned out super!  Thanks!  I kept it light by spreading a layer of cool whip on them and added sliced sweetened strawberries. Rolled them and added a dollop of cool whip. Yum!

Followed the recipe pretty much to the letter, and had an excellent outcome.  I did add a little extra milk and a touch of vanilla.  Made an excellent dessert paired with strawberry yogurt.  Look forward to making this, again.

Awesome, awesome, awesome.  I had no idea crepes were so easy to make.  This recipe yielded eight perfect crepes.  I filled mine with Nutella and bananas and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, re-creating a crepe I had in San Francisco last month.  This recipe is virtually foolproof.  Thanks, Erin!

Excellent and easy!  I made a double recipe and they were gone so quickly, I had to whip up another double batch.  The second batch didn't have time to sit, but was still yummy.  I added vanilla and a little sugar as they were dessert crepes, but will use the recipe as posted for savoury crepes next time.

I was thinking about getting a fancy crepe pan, but thought I'd give my old pan a try and see if it would work for crepes.  I used this recipe and made 8 perfect crepes.  This recipe seems fool proof to me!  I froze the crepes and will fill them later this week with a savory chicken filling using what ever I find in the fridge!

This recipe is perfect as is.  If the first crepe doesn't turn out just right because you undercook or overcook, do not be discouraged.  I always mess up the first crepe and then things go perfectly.

I just made this recipe after trying the “Basic Crepes” from AllRecipes and this was by far better (Basic Crepes called for more flour and no vegetable oil). The crepes were easier to spread thinly across the pan. They browned up nicely and were easily flipped, since the texture was “bouncier”. The texture was wonderful! They were light and spongey. I intended for mine to be for dessert, so I added some vanilla extract. I served mine with whipped cream, raspberries, thinned out Nutella (mixed Nutella and milk) and chopped walnuts.

Delicious! Like others I did not refrigerate. I never plan far enough ahead for that sort of thing, but these turned out beautifully anyway. Didn’t use the blender either, just whisked and poured! It helps to remove the pan from the heat for a minute before pouring the next crepe. It’s easier to coat the whole surface when the pan is cooler. My son has been asking for crepes for weeks and he was not disappointed!

Turned out delicious, just be sure to follow the additional tips from the top commenter who is a French chef. Presift your flour and replace the vegetable oil with butter (because this is a FRENCH food). Also, if you don't have a specific crêpe maker, a low-profile cast iron tortilla warming skillet will work perfectly for the process.

I thought that it turned out great it had the right consistency and was so simple and quick to make. I even  like to add a hint of vanilla to my batter it really just gives it an even greater taste to it.

It is a nice basic crepe recipe, - a 5 star if one uses butter in place of the oil.  Melt a little butter in the pan before making each crepes and the flavor is much richer.  A bit of vanilla and cinnamon is a nice addition if making a sweet crepe.

Never thought I could make crapes on my own so I tried this recipe. So simple and the first one out of the pan was perfect and so were the rest.

Super easy & perfectly delicious. I never refrigerate for the hour - always straight from blend to bake & I've never been disappointed with them.

My family is croatian and I grew up eating these "palacenke" for breakfast. My mom doesn't measure anything so I can't replicate her recipe but this is pretty close. Very good as is! I cut the recipe in half so I wouldn't eat all 8 and good thing I didn't because I would've ate them all. I like my crepes rolled up with strawberry jam. Yum!

I tried the suggestion of cinnimon in the batter, and it turned out way better, than I anticipated!!!! I also, tried having it sit for an hour in the refridgerator, and not having it sit, and it made no difference whatsoever. MY family never got tired of this french delight all week long!! We had them for dinner, dessert, and Sunday morning breakfast!!!!! we tried different crepe fillings depending on the situation. ex: BREAKFAST: butter, blueberries, strawberries cool whip and bacon. (bacon on the side of course)
Thanks Allrecipes! you ROCK!!!!!

I made these crepes for my French class. I had to change some things because my oven runs a little hot and I had only a bit of time to do it, so I didn't put the batter in the fridge for an hour, I put it in the freezer for five minutes. Over all, they turned out pretty well, but they are a tad too eggy.

I made these and stuffed them with nutella and strawberries or bananas. They weren't sweet like pancakes (never had crepes before) or as easy to make, but I got the hang of it after using different sizes and types of pans (no crepe pan on hand), and adjusting the temp on my stove. They passed the kid test.

Great American version of a French crepe. It's quick and tasty. You dint need to refuse greater batter for an hour with this recipe. Although, it does make it easier to create a paper thin crepe.

I made this recipe using the exact ingredients. I beat it with a wire whisk instead of a blender but didn't notice any clumps when I was done. The recipe didn't say what pan size to use but I got 6 out of mine. The conclusion was an absolute PERFECT crepe! I will never even consider another recipe for crepes.

This is the crepe recipe that I have been making for 30 years.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I do not believe that crepes should be flipped...they are not pancakes.  As long as the batter is the perfect thin consistency and you cook it until there is no "shine" on top it will be great.  I also have never used a "crepe pan", only a small skillet type pan like the recipe states.  The trick is in the wrist swirl of the batter when you put it in the pan.  I also brush oil into the pan inbetween each crepe.  And, no blender, as another review stated, a good whisk is all that is needed.  Just whisk your wet ingredients first and then slowly whisk in the flour.  Roll them up with some butter, powdered sugar and for the adults some Grand Marnier and YUM!  They are a lot more labor intensive then pancakes so that is why I always make a double batch and freeze half for another time.  Thanks for putting the recipe in print!

This is the best recipe I've used for Crepes.  Of course that is after taking the advice from Harriet Green - the French Chef.  Which is this - Sift the flour, use butter instead of oil (makes a HUGE difference in the taste- much much better) and 1 yolk and 1 full egg.  Perfect!!!!  I don't add anything as it is perfect as is.  We usually eat it with maple syrup (grade B) and fresh organic strawberries and sometimes homemade yogurt drizzled on top!  YUUUMMM!

Perfect crepe recipe. Definitely mix in a blender (or food processor). I've always made it and used it right away -- although I'm sure it's better to refrigerate it as the recipe calls for, it works without refrigerating it ahead of time, too. LOVE this!

Delicious crepes! I was a bit skeptical about just tossing the ingredients together; I didn't want to have flour clumps in the crepes... These crepes were perfect, very easy to make, very thin, and no clumps! I didn't refrigerate them at all and they turned out great!

Tried it as savory crepes, just added a bit of black pepper and a bit extra salt.
I put ground beef inside them and rolled them then covered all with tomato sauce and Mexican blend grated cheese and in the oven till the cheese is melted :)

This was delicious! The only thing I did differently was I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla. It took me about five tries to get it right, but when I did it was very, very good. I put cream cheese, homemade strawberry jam, and fresh picked blueberries inside. Yummy!

They were quite thick, I added more milk and they turned out fine.  If I had done it again I would have added more sugar as well for dessert crepes.

I just wisk the ingredients instead of putting them in a blender. This recipe is wonderful, also I have never chilled them and don't see why you should.

Wonderful and easy recipe!! I did add a little vanilla and powdered sugar as others suggested.  I also used whole wheat flour because thats what I had and it still turned out fabulous. Stuffed with sauteed apples another reviewer added.  My husband loved them and he does not usually like them!!!!!

Holy moly...just ate 2 of these right from the pan..lol...didn't even bother with filling as I wanted to make sure they were filling 'worthy'.  They are!!  Not a fan of maple syrup since a kid...a little butter and powdered or granulated sugar sprinkled was fine.  But I can't wait to do some yummy fillings.    I did add about 1/2 tsp vanilla and used almond milk as I don't do reg milk.  Can't wait to make these again and experiment with all the options.  Great recipe!

I made this morning for my family. It's an awesome recipe. I didn't let it set for an hour, but it was still delicious. I added a little sugar and vanilla to the batter. I made a marscapone, ricotta, sour cream filling with a strawberry, blueberry, raspberry, blackberry compote for the topping. It was delicious!

Absolutely perfect as is!!! I followed other's suggestions on adding sugar and vanilla, although delicious I wish I hadn't. I made them for two and had leftovers. Had I not added sugar and vanilla I could have made some delicious lunch crepes. 

This was my first time making crepes and they came out perfectly delicious!

It great if for no other reason its so simple. Crepes can be used for any meal depending upon what you put on or "in" them. Do as restaurants do in mix raspberry pie filling with sour cream. Or Nutella and banana for lunch. Or served with sliced Strawberries, drizzled with chocolate and topped with powder sugar. 
I have even used the batter to make omelets. skillet the veggies then pour this on top. My 8 year old did didn't want eggs so this was created.

Wonderful thin crepes. My 10 year old begs to make these with me. We use 2 nonstick skillets to speed things up and keep them warm in the oven, layering them between paper towels.  Serve for brunch or dessert with nutella  and whip cream.  They also work well with savory fillings, like ham and cheese.  Yum!

This is an excellent recipe. I would say idiot proof. Used it today to make a savory crepe breakfast with a roux based cheese sauce, mushroom and spinach compote and ham slices. It really hit the spot.

Followed the recipe as is (wet ingredients first, let the milk and uncracked eggs come to room temperature) and it produced perfect crepes - thin but not so fragile that they just rip apart. To echo another reviewer, you really do not need to flip these so don't frustrate yourself trying!

The review by dancingpony on how to spot a really good crepe recipe is what convinced me to try this recipe. I'm glad that I did. As the batter was being used up, I noticed that the batter towards the end had slightly thickened up, so I diluted it with a dab of milk. This really is a perfect crepe recipe. This is going to into my keeper file. Thanks for sharing it, Erin!

This was my first experiment with crepes, and they turned out fabulous! I really didn't think I'd be able to do it, but making crepes really is easier than you would think. I skipped the combining in a bowl step, and just poured everything into the blender. I didn't refrigerate either because I was too impatient. I threw a few spoonfuls on a big skillet lightly greased with some cooking spray and lo and behold the crepe forms almost immediately! You have to spread the batter right away to make a bigger, thinner crepe because these things cook fast on medium heat! I found no need to flip them. When my first crepe was done, I slathered some Nutella and threw in some sliced bananas. Then, I wrapped it up and sprinkled some cocoa powder and powdered sugar on top. They were so RICH! Next time, I will make them with fruit and homemade whipped cream, and perhaps experiment with some ganache. I also want to try making them for lunch and dinner. The best thing about crepes is their versatility. You truly can do anything with them! Here's to many more crepe experiments in my kitchen!  Thanks for this recipe! I can't wait to WOW everyone with these! :)

This IS a great crepe recipe!  I halved the recipe since it was just for me and my husband and it was still yummy.  I added a couple dashes of cinnamon to the batter too which didn't really change the flavor of the crepe much.  I just happen to love smell of cinnamon.  I was afraid to make crepes because it looked hard to do, but this was SO easy!

I lived in France for a year and used to eat crepes a lot! This tastes familiar and it's easy to make. So easy I've made it many times already. Versatile because you can add a bit of sugar and vanilla for sweet crepes or prepare it as is for a savory crepe. I don't think you MUST refrigerate the batter to make good crepes but it helps you quickly spread it in the pan for a thin crepe (as they are meant to be) before it heats up too much and starts to set.

This was my first time making crepes and I picked this recipe because it uses a blender and the reviews say the batter is easy to work with.  The only thing I changed was I added some vanilla extract.  The crepes turned out really well!  Even the first one was perfect.  I used a pretty small pan, which may have helped them stay together when flipped.  I found that it's important for the pan to be hot enough that it sizzles when the batter goes in.  Even really thin crepes (thin enough to see the small pattern on our dishes) were easy to turn.  I served these with the Lemon Snow filling recipe from this website (which turned out amazing), whipped cream sweetened with powdered sugar and vanilla, raspberry syrup from the farmer's market, strawberry freezer jam that I made last week, Nutella and raw fireweed honey.  My favorite combination was the Lemon Snow with the strawberry jam, my fiance loved the Nutella with the strawberry jam.  Yum yum!  I will make these again for sure and also try them with a savory filling.

Yum!  So simple and soooooo tasty.  I added 2 tsps of vanilla to make the crepes a bit sweeter and they were just divine.  I will definitely make these again!

Ooh, la la! I've made these four or five times now.  Half of the time I refrigerated the batter and half I did not. Could not tell the difference in appearance or taste.  I did slightly brush the skillet with oil for each crepe after having one stick badly.  They were just as good as the crepes we've had on many trips to Europe.  Fill with anything you can think of.  For dinner tonight I will fill with salmon curry and afterwards, for dessert, I will fill with Nutella spread, raspberry jam, and whipped cream.

Simply Delicious! I couldn't believe how well these came out! I made them for breakfast this morning when my cousins were here. They were gone within 15 minutes! Suggestions for serving it is to make a strawberry or mixed berry sauce. Just chop the berries up, put them in a sauce pan, and add about 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and a splash of vanilla. Also top off with whipped cream! Thank you so much!

Made these for 8-year old son's birthday dinner.  Served with many filling options:  ham, cheese, tomatoes, sour cream, fruit, jams, peanut butter, nutella.  I tripled the recipe for our family of 5 and it was just the right amount.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We loved these.  I'll be using this recipe instead of the basic in Betty Crocker from now on.  I also added a little sugar just because I wanted some sweetness.  We had them with strawberries and cream and munster, brown sugar ham, and spinach for brunch today.

I would have never thought to have made my own crepes but then ran across these. Taking the advice of other reviewers I added sugar and vanilla. They were very tastey.

Absolutely fantastic. Easiest Crepe recipe in existance! I added 2 tbsp of cocoa powder and 1 tsp of brown sugar, as well as a dash of vanilla and they were amazing for dessert. We had crepes for dinner for a week!  If you're just starting out, I'd suggest using 1/2 a cup of batter until you get used to it, then go down to the 1/3. It made it a lot easier for me.  Also, line the bottom of your plate with a paper towel just to collect excess moisture.  Fantastic overall!

I enjoyed this recipe, but it's a bit bland, so I added a tablespoon of sugar to the batter and it turned out great!  Also for the filling, I had 8 oz of cream cheese and followed the previous recipe by adding some orange juice to the desired consistency and added some sauteed blueberries to the cream cheese.  After that, I spread the cream cheese and  blueberries on the crepes.  Yummy! :)

So much simpler than I thought crepes would ever be! A non-stick skillet definitely helped, these were delicious made as directed. I served with homemade blueberry compote, lemon curd and sour cream. Thanks for a great recipe.

Just wanted to let all those who are allergic to milk or sensitive to lactose, I used vanilla soy milk (silk) and it worked perfectly. Also, I spread with hazelnut-chocolate spread and fresh strawberries. Yum!! DH was impressed. :)

An easy and excellent recipe.  After flipping the crepe I put a slice of deli ham and a slice of american cheese on it, then folded it in thirds right in the pan a few minutes later.  Great for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  I also like them with fresh lemon juice and sugar sprinkled on them.  So good.

OMG! Super easy! Super delicious! First time making crepes! I've always been afraid to make them...afraid I'd mess up! LOL You can add sugar, vanilla, (I personally added butter flavoring). I also made a cream cheese sauce to pour over. I filled ours with peaches, cinnamon & sugar. YUMMY!!!!

Super yummy recipe! I used spelt flour and had to add some extra to give it a thicker consistency.  I also keep the batter in the fridge, each morning it's ready for me to make a fresh crepe! It goes well with spinach, artichokes and mushrooms sprinkled with cheddar and goat cheese.  I can't wait to try it with banana and nutella or chocolate!

PERFECT! My husband and I put the kids down to bed early, and made a batch of these just for us. We ate them one at a time, fresh out of the pan. My husband loves them with nutella. My favorite was with a splash of lemon juice and a generous sprinkle of vanilla sugar.

Yummy!  Never made crepes at home, but this recipe is really easy and good.  Added a splash of vanilla to the batter.

Absolutely divine! I've never made crepes before in my life, but I was craving them today. I even had to walk down to the store to get some fresh eggs. On the suggestion of other users (and for my own love of vanilla and cinnamon), I added 1 tsp of vanilla (for half of a recipe) and about 1/2 or 1 tsp of cinnamon. I ate them with a home-made sweet lemon cream cheese and sliced mango. Soooo fantastic! I made them for lunch, but I have a feeling I'll have them again for dinner! Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

This is by far the BEST crepe recipe I've ever made!  My family likes vanilla, so I added 2 tsp. My daughters had me make it for them 3 days in a row.  This receipe is a keeper for our family!

Great recipe! I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour and I used Smart Balance (regular) instead of the oil for the first batch. They came out good, but my second batch I omitted the butter all together and those came out even better. Paper thin! Definatley will be making these again!

Absolutely yummy! We made these for Christmas morning instead of our traditional German stollen. We filled them with jam and raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries and topped them with powdered sugar and whipped cream. Our new Christmas morning tradition!

This recipe did only make four large pan size crepes which was more than enough for us two adults and two kids, but next time I would double the batter to have extra.

Updated - I tripled this recipe for our '08 Christmas breakfast which  only made eight crepes!! I'm not sure how that works, but it was the perfect amount with another entree.

This is WONDERFUL! I had a craving for crepes today like no other, had everything in my house ready to go, and this was so easy! I didn't let it sit, but instead cooked it right away and it was just perfect! I commute 62 miles each way to school everyday so this is a definite quick breakfast recipe I will be using! Thanks for sharing! My favorite so far!!

Pretty good- most fillings I use for these are sweet, so I don't add any sugar in to the batter, but some might want to. Very versatile, so many combinations of fillings are possible. Low calorie treat too =)

The crepes were very easy to make and were really good.  I added a bit of sugar and cinnamon to the recipe for sweetness.  Topped with butter, syrup and whipped cream and they were enjoyed by all.  Made 10 crepes.

Perfect!  Absolutely loved it!  Although it only made 6 fairly small crepes, good for 2 people only.

Amazingly simple. Prepare the recipe ahead of time and leave in blender in fridge until it's time to serve. I served these as dessert with guests last night, and had all the fruit pre-sliced. My guests enjoyed making their own, and while they didn't all use the same fruits - they definitely all used the Nutella! I added vanilla and sugar to the recipe for the dessert affect. Extremely easy to prepare and fast to cook, I give this recipe 5 stars.

This was my first attempt at making crepes. The only thing I changed was adding a pinch of sugar. I filled them with fresh diced strawberries folded into strawberry yogurt, and topped them with fresh strawberry halves set in whipped cream . OUTSTANDING! and SO EASY!

Within the span of one day, I have become a crepe addict!  These were easy to make & very addictive.  To make myself feel slightly better about eating an entire batch myself, I used wheat flour instead of standard white flour.  Then I loaded them full of a cream cheese mixture and proceeded to eat them for dessert, breakfast, lunch....help!!

This recipe is so simple and is a regular for family weekends.  I want to mention the serving sizes.  This morning I had my husband and 4 grandkids (ages 2-6)to feed.  I have an electric crepe maker that makes salad plate sized crepes.  I usually serve each person a plate of 3or 4 folded crepes with brown sugar and bananas or strawberries.  My grandkids will average 6 crepes each.  I tripled the recipe and barely had enough this morning.  So a triple recipe made about 35 salad plate sized crepes, which was just enough for 6 people.  I don’t know how they say one recipe makes 8 servings.  It may make 8 crepes but you need more than one per person...for sure.  The thing is that you need to let the batter sit in the fridge for a hour.  This is really important if you use an electric crepe maker because if you don’t follow that step, you will lose the first four or five crepes due to all the bubbles.  So you can’t just whip up another batch if you run out.  Plan ahead and make more batter than you think you will need.

I only had one egg left and halved the recipe and got 4 crepes out of it, folded each in half  and drizzled with nutella and sprinkled confectioners sugar . my very critical son loved it.  Tip - give it a few seconds off the stove when adding next batch ( I used 1/4 cup in crepe pan on med high heat) .  spray then a few seconds to cool so batter will spread better and cover pan to look like a circle versus if pan is too hot batter starts to cook and set immediatley and you may not get best shape. I did not refridgerate no need if using cold milk and egg.  sprayed with butter pam in between . make it super thin so it is more like a crepe and not a pancake and as soon as a hint of brown on edges I flip and it only needs a few seconds on other side if thin and not as long as recipe. watch them.  it works!! I wish it pok pic but he ate them so fast.

After my daughter spent a semester abroad in Paris, she came home with all sorts of new food tastes, lol.Her first of course was crepes.  I went and actually got a crepe pan from William Sonama and started trying to make them.  This was the first recipe to meet her very high fulooting tastes buds, lol.  I think I've mastered the sweet and savory, but the consistency of this crepe is the best so far.  Ty.

Delicious and easy to make.  I grated some Gruyere cheese for the filling.  Excellent and close to what I remember getting from street vendors in Paris years ago when I was there as a student.

A very good base recipe.  I made a  banana mango compote filling then sifted on confectioner’s sugar, and topped with fresh whipped cream and a Luxardo maraschino cherry.

This is the only recipe I use and have used for a long time!  I do switch the milk for silk soy milk due to a milk allergy/intolerance in the family.  It works great with this change. (no-one notices ever)

Delicious dinner crepes! Filled with shredded beef with beef sauce.from leftover roast. Used gluten-free flour, pea-protein milk, and dairy free butter as substitutes due to allergies. Caramelized well just like the picture. Needed to thin the batter a bit due to all the substitutions. Will try an extra egg yolk next time.

It was amazing! I loved it, although I would recommend only 3/4 cup milk. Also, I added cinnamon and two tablespoons of granulated white sugar. They tasted even better than pancakes! Also, I served it with strawberry yogurt, cornflakes, clementines, and a drizzle of honey. But plain crepes tasted great too. So far one of the best recipes ever!!

Very yummy, SUPER easy. I did sub almond milk for regular milk.  

With the second batch I added some cinnamon and vanilla, which made it yummy, too.

Thank you very much for posting this!! The crepes were perfect and delicious!! It made an excellent breakfast!! I added too much oil and I should have brushed the pan BEFORE it was heated (my huge mistake), but they were still very delicious!!

This recipe is so good i had friends over and it was the perfect breakfast.  my only change would be to cook it for 1 minute on low. i do think that the cooking time on the recipe is way to long. But overall this is a great recipe i will surely make it again.

Add either salt for savory crepes or vanilla and sugar for sweet crepes. Overall this recipe worked well and I would definitely use it again.

Tasted absolutely AMAZING! Simple recipe and a great taste. The batter does not need to be chilled for 1 hr. I made this recipe and I didn’t chill the batter at all and it turned out great. Just a tip for you folks who don’t have much time on your hands.

Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe.. and a simple suggestion when adding any filling or a spread.. make sure you don’t add lot of filling as it might ruin the dish... luckily I added a huge spoonful of Nutella only for my first two crepes..  I could only taste extra sweet choco filling.. but from third one onwards I added half a teaspoon of spread and it was perfect

Since I can't eat gluten, I made these with gluten-free all purpose flour.  Holy moly, they were incredible! We had "crepe night", and made savory (sausage, sauteed asparagus/onions/shitake, mixed greens/sriracha mayo) for dinner and sweet (mixed berries with homemade unsweetened yogurt, custard, dried coconut) and it was amazing and super easy. I had 2 ceramic pans going (brushed coconut oil on the first round) and it took so little time. I made the batter in my NutriNinja - so easy to make and clean up. Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe is a lifesaver! Crepes are one of my husband's favorite foods, and when he started watching his calories, he thought he'd have to give them up. Then I found this little wonder. It's the healthiest crepe recipe I've ever come across: only 79 calories per serving  whereas all other recipes I've tried are around 170-200 calories per serving (without the filling). The trick is using whole eggs, subbing oil for butter, and not using sugar. Even with this changes from what might be called a traditional crepe, this is still has them beat. It's  light and airy and delicious. Thank you so much for sharing this low-cal French gem!

I made this for my family. It was disgusting. Batter was slimey and had no flavor no matter what I put in it. Had to throw it all away.

My family was having a breakfast-for-dinner night and I made delicious crepes. They turn out really well if you know how to do it right. I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar just to add a little sweetness. ?? My favorite way to top it is filling it with Nutella, rolling it up, pouring maple syrup on, whipped cream, and for the sublime finishing touch, sliced strawberries and raspberries sprinkled with sugar. These are PROFESSIONAL crepes! They could be in the restaurant downtown Colorado Springs, Paris Crepes! DELISH! Good job Erin! Love these!

Simple, straightforward and great! I used butter instead of vegetable oil and 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk in place of the 2 whole eggs, added a tsp of vanilla extract and a pinch of cinnamon and it came out fluffy, light and buttery! Smelt great too!!

Simple instructions. Loved that I could make it in the blender. Delicious base for many crepe fillings. We used warmed cinnamon apples and lemon curd. Both were a hit for our family.

I used 2 whole eggs, 1 cup milk, 3/4 cup pancake mix, and vanilla extract from Mexico to taste.  On the first crepe, I used 1/2 a tablespoon of real butter in the pan and nothing after that.  I put frozen berries in a pan with some powdered sugar, dash of sea salt and boiled to use as a chunky syrup. Then filled the crepes with cottage cheese, rolled like enchiladas, and covered with syrup.

These were amazing. I shifted the flour, used one whole egg and one egg yolk then I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tbs of sugar. I also added a bit more milk to thin the batter out. The batter smelt amazing and the crepe tasted so good. This is my new favorite recipe. It was super easy to make and very tasty.

It was ok, but  the batter should have made more. Even though I doubbled it they only made  6 crepes.  Also, the musernment should have been in AMERICAN units.

This is my favorite crepe recipe! I added about a tablespoon and a half of vanilla extract and about a teaspoon of imitation almond extract and they tasted amazing with strawberries and whipped cream. This recipe (and the cooking instructions) also works great with all purpose gluten free flour (which cooks slightly differently than regular all purpose flour)

This recipe is absolutely amazing! If you are lactose intolerant and are afraid to have it, just add in soy or Almond milk.(It makes it tastes sweeter). Also, to make it have flavor add in a teaspoon of Vanilla extract. If your crepes don't work the first time keep trying! Overall I love this recipe so much, it made feel like a real chef!

I have been making crepes since I was a child. My Dad was a chef and found millions of ways to make dishes with them. I ALWAYS use butter instead of oil, they are much more rich in flavour. If you use grass fed beef butter (Kerrigolds) they are even better! And also better for you than most oils or processed  margarine. Though unrefined coconut oil in the pan instead of spray adds a nice dimension to dessert crepes.  And unless I am making them savory, always a dash of vanilla. No need to refrigerate. The VERY best way to eat crepes is hot off the pan, sprinkled with just a wisp of sugar and rolled up into a tube. It's a 'thing'. As a girl I would stand by my Dads side as he made crepes waiting for him to screw one up so he could make my little crepe-roll for me. This recipe is okay as is, but butter would make them more authentic and tastier.

This is a stellar recipe and I make it quite frequently. I've even gotten my kid into making them because it's kind of fun. I've filled them with sweets like fruit or Nutella, and savories like ham or turkey. We've even used them in lieu of tortillas for breakfast burritos.

My daughter loved it however I did use a Maseca instant corn flour because I did not have the all purpose flour. Maybe with the proper flour it will taste even better. It was very easy to make. I added strawberries, bananas, vanilla pudding inside. On the outside I spread Nutella, chocolate syrup and because I also couldn't find the strawberry syrup I replaced it with Smuckers strawberry fruit spread AKA jam and topped it with whip cream :)

Delicious and easier than I expected!  I added a half teaspoon of sugar and chilled the batter for 15 minutes.  The first crêpe turned out so-so but beyond that, they turned out great.  It took that one to get a hang of the heat setting and technique.
Using the 1/4 cup as a ladle = 8 crêpes.  We had savory and sweet-filled crêpes.

Some reviews say that it sticks to the pan, which is right, But I used a flat cast iron skillet and made them slightly smaller and it was delicious. I made three crepes, though a bit thicker, and lay each one on top of the other. In between the crepes,  I put two sauces on:
A homemade jam, and a yogurt frosting.
After that, I sprinkled it with powdered sugar.

This recipe is perfect for breakfast or even dessert! They are super delicious with whipped cream and fruit, or even ice cream! They will literally go with anything. Sometimes I just eat them plain!

VERY easy recipe and tastes good too. make sure to actually use 1/4 cup or else they will be to thick, and DON'T ADD SUGAR it will stick to the pan and won't flip easily.

I have never eaten crepes, but my husband loves them!  For some reason, I thought they would be complicated to make.  I tried this recipe.  Not only were they simple to make, but delicious!  I filled them with softened whipped cream cheese, thawed mixed berries and topped them off with whipped cream.  I have a new top 20 favorite food!

Second time using this perfect recipe I made this using the sugar subst. Trivia, 1 packet instead. I use butter and brown it before adding the batter. It gets that golden brown look without over cooking the crepe.

The oil actually works just as well as butter, because with melted butter you'll get some lumps as it cools down in the cold ingredients. So, I stick with the oil. I'm going to season and stuff them anyway, so the smoother the better. The trick is to pour the batter in the pan, lift the pan and weave it side to side until the batter (working very quickly) coats the entire bottom of the pan for a perfect circle. It will be very thin this way and better than most crepes bought ready made in a store. I add the filling while still hot because cheeses and whatnot spread better. This is a very easy recipe but do make sure to let the batter get silky in the blender then let it firm up in the fridge.

Absolutely love these! Versatile for picky eaters; I just put out dishes of filler options and everyone gets what they like. I made them for my son's sleepover and one of the moms called me for the recipe because her son was begging her to make them.

Okay so I am a really big crepe fan. I make them almost everyday and I am always looking for a new and better recipe. I tried this the other day but I didn't use  blender. They turned out AMAZING. I recommend adding a dash of vanilla after adding the oil.

The batter was awful! It was very sticky! Luckily my mother was home and helped me to fix the batter.  Next time i will just use 2 cups of flour. Also i putted in the batter a teaspoon of vanilla and it turned out  great.

I was looking for more of something on the sweeter side because it tasted more like a pancake. I adjusted it a little and added a little bit of brown sugar into the mix, then topped it wiith fresh strawberries as well as carmalized bananas in brown sugar that I had browned in a frying pan with a little bit of butter.

I followed the recipe to a T. Took a suggestion from a review I read to add vanilla extract and cinnamon. The first crepe came out bad, tasted bland, to fix I added quite a bit of sugar to the rest of the mix. Everyone enjoyed the crepes. 4 stars because sugar is missing from this recipe. This recipe is a keeper.

This was so simple to make!   I can't believe I've never attempted crepes before.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I would like to omit the oil next time tho. I used no calorie oil spray in the pan so I don't see why I couldn't use that in the batter also.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil since that's all I have.  Any oil would work. Hey is 6 less calories in each crepe.  Btw-- this makes 8 Crépes and each one is 69 calories when made as directed.   63 calories if made with no oil or oil spray like Pam.

It's my first time making crepes and I didn't alter the recipe at all except that we only had 3/4 cup of cow milk, so I used the other 1/4 as almond milk and it worked just fine. I bet it would be fine if you're lactose free and use almond, but I'm not sure about other milks. Altogether, my family was impressed with these!

My first time doing crepes.  This was first recipe and read the many reviews. And I see why .  the process was  easy  I don't have crepe pan. Or iron.  But in my nonstick  it worked out fine. Just adjusted the temp.  Presetup. Help to make it flow from pan to plate warmer.  Made a dessert fruit for breakfast.  And gona use the others later for savory.  Last night's roast &veggies in crepe . yum. Thanks .

I made this using the suggestion of substituting oil with butter as well as using 1 whole egg plus one yolk.  I didn't have time to let it sit in the fridge for an hour so I put it in the freezer for 10 minutes and it was fine.  My family and I loved the crepes and it was very easy to make!!  Will definitely make it again and again...

I have to put 1/2 a cup of batter in i also put in a little more sugar. Great breakfast if you put frozen fruit in with a mixture of cream cheese, ricata cheese, and cream blend it together until really thick, put this inside and then sprinkle with powdered sugar, or make it a dessert with pudding and whipped cream on top.

I love this recipe. But the first time I made it i did not see where it said refrigerate one hour so I didn't do it. And it came out perfect so I recommend to not refrigerate the 1 hour. (optional)

Excellent!  I've always been too intimidated to make crepes as I've been told they are difficult.  These are so easy, and I always have the necessary ingredients on hand.  I fill them with fresh fruit, top with yogurt, granola, and mini chocolate chips.  Awesome!

This recipe is very versatile! The only change I made was to put butter instead of oil. Unlike another recipe I tried before, this batter was liquidy enough to spread around the pan easily and quickly. It also became crispy and didn't rip when I tried to flip it, even though it was extremely thin. I put nutella and berries inside ! :) Yum!

I made these and put caramel sauce and coconut on them. They're great but make sure you make them extremely thin and they worked without refrigerating them.

Whole family loved it but I found that this recipe made about 5 largeish crepes so the cook missed out. Perhaps needed to make to make them thinner. Followed advice from the comment from the French cook and used butter instead of oil, did not though add an extra egg yolk or sift the flour. Mixed up well with just a whisk. Good idea re: refrigeration prior to using.

This did not go very well for me with a substitution of freshly ground whole grain wheat. If I make it again, I'll give it another chance with store bought flour and see how it fairs.

Turned out great! I did as another reviewer suggested and used one whole egg and an egg yolk. I also used butter instead of oil for the mix. I blended the mix in a blendtec blender. I didn't allow to sit in refrigerator for one hour, only about 10 minutes before I gave in and decided to go ahead and make it, but it turned out excellent!

I've made this 4xs already and they consistently come out very well; my only problem is getting the hang of swirling it just right on my crepe grill -- nothing to do @ all w/the recipe. I've not changed this recipe @ all and follow it to the letter; w/this recipe I've made both sweet & savory fillings and it's just yummyliciousness all around. Thank you for sharing this user friendly, versatile, practically fool proof recipe!

These crepes were super easy and very tasty. I put sliced apples & walnuts (sautéed in butter), thin slice of brie, and drizzled honey inside & on top. Delicious!

The ingredients are simple, and the results are fantastic. I make these all the time. You really don't have to chill the batter. I've used sweet toppings like chocolate chips and berries, also savory like chicken Alfredo. Give it a try!

I have made many different crepe recipes, but this is by far my favorite! Usually the first one doesn't work and it takes a couple of tries to get an edible one, but from the first to the last, these were awesome!

I have been wanting to try making crepes for a long time. The thought of making such a skinny pancake was very intimidating. This recipe seemed simple, I just used my immersion hand blender & I didn't keep it in the refrigerator. But the crepes turned out great! Changes I made were, sifting the flour & adding a dash of vanilla.

I didn't read the full instructions and they still turned out fantastic!  I put everything in the blender (butter, not oil) and whirred it up and started making the crepes.  Filled with fresh strawberries and peaches with fresh whipped cream.  Perfect summer breakfast!  Thanks for the recipe.

Great and easy recipe. However, my son & I tweaked it.  We used three whole eggs instead of the two, omitted the oil, added 3/4 cup of sugar (I know, that's a lot!) used soymilk instead of the one called for, and added about a tsp of cinnamon and we didn't wait the hour! I hand mixed everything, then cooked it like in the recipe. My kid enjoyed it. It was perfect the way it came out, I left it plain. Plus he helped make it, so viola. Thanks for the recipe!!

I wonder why a professional french chef would have the need to look up a crepe recipe... have made this recipe a few times now. the first time I followed it exactly, like usual. came out good. The second time, I added 2 tsp vanilla. Even better. Third time, I used butter instead of oil, even better!

The crepe was yummy, but even though we followed the instructions perfectly, the crepe constantly bubbled on the pan, and we could not get the even color we have had before with other recipes.

Yay! A simple, straightforward crepe recipe that tastes amazing! I adjusted the recipe for 4 servings instead of 8 and regretted it later - once I tastes these I wanted MORE! (BTW: 4 servings makes two crepes) This time, I made Nutella banana crepes, but I want to try some chicken and mushroom pesto on the next go around. The hubby can't wait!

When a picky teenager loves it, you know it's good.  It was so easy, I followed the recipe exactly.  The family can't wait until I make it again.  Thanks you!

I changed the recipe up a bit due to experience making crepes.  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 2 tbsp. melted ghee to the batter.  I also sift the flour and whisk the batter.  I used spelt flour and coconut milk.  After finishing I sprinkle with cinnamon and powdered sugar.

I have made these several times. The last time I accidentally left out the oil, but they still turned out great. Easy recipe that I can get right every time. I add a little almond extract to mine, just to add a little flavor. First one never turns out pretty, but all the rest of them do. Delicious crepes and a new Sunday morning favorite.

This is one of the best CREPES I have ever made. I like it after dinner and lunch as a dessert, topped with ice cream. My children like it with Nutella. ( I have 8 children so all I did was double the recipe.

I generally never wait 1 hour for it to get cold, I probably leave it for 15-20 minutes as  I prepare my fillings. It taste pretty good.

First time to even attempt crepes. They were so simple to make. I put cream cheese in them with peach topping ala IHOP. They were delicious.

I halved the recipe to 1 egg, 1/2 cup milk, 1/3 cup RICE flour, pinch salt, 3/4 teaspoon vegetable oil. I also added 1/3 cup brown sugar. The RICE flour makes this recipe gluten-free, and it works very well! The sugar is because my parents always made them sweet and we ate them plain.

These were my first crepes and they were great.  I served them with a Blue Cranberry sauce (that I found on here) and whipped cream.  We ate them as a desert.

Recipe is good. However, less on the flour and butter, makes it clumpy & oily. Add Grand Marnier and Vanilla extract to give it more flavor.

Looked for a 5 star recipe and found it here....and they turned out perfect first time.  I converted the quantities from cups to metric:  225ml milk and 100g plain flour; sieved the flour; missed out the salt and; used butter instead of oil.  Very very nice and much lighter than the pancakes I have been making for years!

The batter was too thick to make really thin crepes, but it tasted pretty good! The only additions I made was a pinch of cinnamon and a dash of vanilla.

I just made my crepes and they're really nice although next time I'll add melted butter instead of oil. Batter came out more runny than the one I'm used to, but this way each crape was very thin and had a nice crunch. Really delicious. I served them with cream cheese frosting and raspberries. All sprinkled with confectioners sugar. My husband loved them so much I didn't get a chance to make a pic! He ate them all!

Didn't turn out how I had hoped. I wanted to make these as a nice little breakfast for me and my sister, but neither of us liked them at all and we love crepes! I was disappointed.  They stuck and burned and were not as good as hoped. Won't rush to make these again.

Yummy!!!!! This was my first successful attempt at crepes!!!!! Thank you so much!!!!!! The only change I made was substituted the vegetable oil with slightly cooled butter. These turned out fantastic!!! When  topping these babies off with a light cream and blueberries, how can it get better than that!!!! I thoroughly enjoyed these crepes and will use this recipe again!!!! Thanks again Erin!!!!!!!!!!

I grew up with crepes and this is a close recipe to my Mom's.  The key to this recipe is to get a thin batter and turn your pan so that it covers the bottom, also thinning the cooking crepe.  While I agree, dessert crepes may be sweetened I would rather go for the basic eggy crepe and fill with a sweet.  I made these, adjusted the recipe (little changes)and served them at a brunch for my daughters birthday.  We had a savory egg casserole and lots of fresh fruit macerated to go with the vanilla yogurt filled crepes..  Thanks Erin for sharing..

Yes, it works ! I agree though that 1) butter has better flavour than oil 2) the waiting time is essential 3) the thinest the best ! You can add a little vanilla or dark rum in the dough. Hey, I'm French too :-)

I learned to make crepes from my mother, who learned it from her mother.  I have made crepes for my family for nearly 45 years and never had a recipe to follow.  I use eggs, milk, vanilla, sugar and flour (unsifted).  I make them in two different pans - cast iron skillet and a teflon coated skillet.  Both come out perfect.  My husband likes them with strawberries and whipped cream or just syrup.  I prefer them with sugar syrup which is what my mother served.  (2 cups sugar, 1 cup water - bring to a boil, stir until all sugar is dissolved.) It will keep forever in the refrigerator.  I make a huge batch and freeze enough for 8-10 future breakfasts.

I'm sure this recipe makes a great savory crepe, but wanting something sweeter I made some adjustments.  Having only one egg in the fridge, I halved the recipe.  I used butter instead of oil for the batter, measuring out 1 1/2 tsp of melted butter (I didn't half that part of the recipe and it was the perfect amount!)  Following the advice of another reviewer, I added 1/2 tbsp of sugar and a few drops of vanilla.  I love a touch of nutmeg in my crepes, so I added a small pinch of that.  I did use a blender and chilled in the fridge for about 45 minutes because I just couldn't wait.  I heated my pan thoroughly before I started and used olive oil cooking spray for the pan.  A 1/4 cup of batter per crepe worked great for 4 crepes, and each crepe took less than a minute to brown up just slightly on both sides.  Super thin, just sweet enough, absolutely delicious.  I used a small amount of strawberry preserves in each crepe and rolled them up, it was the perfect midnight snack!  One day I'll make this recipe as is for a savory meal.

First time ever making crepes.  Was very straightforward and they came out perfect. My 11yr old daughter loved these things. Made them as a wrap for a sausage egg and cheese breakfast.  Great recipe that I will definitely use again! :)
Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

After I got the first crepe done I had to try it! The tantilizing aroma was bringing me back to a family home in France I spent some time in. I slowly poured strawberry sauce onto the cake and proceeded to carefully roll it, not wanting to lose any more of the sauce than was natural. I closed my eyes and brought the crepe to my lips, even at this point I was instantly transported to the small town in Normandy with the children laughing, glasses of port and the tiniest French woman teaching me the proper method of producing these versitile treats. The very essence of the french family was brought back to me in one bite. Thank you for the share, they are perfect!

Delicious and easy to make! No need to refrigerate. The whole family liked them. I don't have a crepe pane so I used a cast iron steak skillet. Worked perfectly. Great with maple syrup and fresh creme.

I was half asleep when I threw this together. It wasn't until afterwards that I read I should have put it all in a blender and refrigerated it. Despite not following directions this was so yummy. I paid $8 for crepes at a popular local breakfast restaurant last weekend and thought mine were better (and cheaper). Can't wait to try them again and follow directions (not too mention read how others made this recipe even better), how much better can they get? Delicious!

I find that the batter is too thick so I add 3/4 cup of milk and 1 tbsp of vanilla to make them sweet.

Made it to recipe, first time making crepes. Fantastic! I only put them in fridge for 30 minutes, I was impatient. Kids and I loved them!  I only had strawberry go-gurt to fill them w/ and fresh strawberries... then drizzle choc. syrup and powder sugar, perfect ending to our study of FRANCE!

I make these at least 2-3 times a week. My children love them. I do add a little milk at the end (maybe 1 tbsp) if the batter is too thick. Thank you for posting! Excellent!

Made these tonight for a light dinner.  Mixed batter with a whisk and let set on the countertop for about 10 minutes while I made my famous orange butter.  Fantastic crepes!

these crepes are oily and tasteless. There are much better crepe recipes that are just as easy.

These turned out great! It was helpful to watch the video on this site as well. I appreciate the reviewer (it might be the one right before me, the french chef) adding in the bit about the butter and egg. I was not brave enough to do the one egg yolk... but i will try it like that next time. 1/2 tbsp of butter was perfect instead of 1 1/2 tsp oil. I was making dessert crepes, so i added ( i think) 3 tbsp of sugar to the batter. If the pan was not hot enough when the batter was poured in, i found that my crepe likely would break when i flipped it. I made a cream cheese filling for the inside, then drizzled a homemade caramel or chocolate sauce on top then topped it with homemade whipped cream. YUMMM!

I made crepes for the first time today using this recipe. It was simple and delicious. I used almond milk for some of the liquid and added a dash of vanilla. The family gave it rave reviews and I got to use my new crepe pan that has been sitting on the shelf for months. We're all happy!

This recipe could not be simpler, and I was very pleased with the result. The first try I used almond milk and nutella filling, the second time whole milk and strawberry jam. Both were entirely satisfying and quick to produce. Unfortunately, they disappeared just as quickly.

I made these crepes for Valentines breakfast for my hubby ... WOW! So good! They were so quick & easy! I added a cap full of vanilla & a few dashes of cinnamon for some added flavor.

I didn't have any berries in the house, so I just made banana crepes...heart-shaped banana crepes to be exact! [photos #23 up top].

For filling I mixed together Cool Whip, sour cream & softened cream cheese. Unfortunately, I just did this by eye & taste, so I don't have exact measurements...but so YUM! I just smoothed the mixture into middle of crepe, placed a few banana slices on top & rolled it up. Topped it off with a dollop of Cool Whip & heart-shaped banana slice on top. EXCELLENT!

Very tasty & very easy!  I'll definately make them again.  I followed a suggestion from other reviewer and added 2 t. vanilla & a pinch of cinnamon to my mix since I was going to fill w/fruit.  I filled them w/fresh sliced bananas & strawberries.  Some I topped with a warm blueberry sauce that I made by mixing approximately 1T cornstarch into cold water then adding blueberries and cooking til thick and others were topped with a warmed apple syrup.  Both were a hit!  Can't wait to experiment w/other fillings.

Quick and easy and very tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I whisked everything together and put in the refrigerator for only 15 minutes as I cut up strawberries to fill the crepes.  I was unsure as to what size pan to use.  I am used to large crepes, so I used a large pan, but 1/4 cup batter didn't cover a quarter of the pan, so I ended up using 2/3 cup batter which still did not cover the pan.  This recipe ended up serving 3 people, not 8, but the crepes were much thicker than I am used to, so if I had thinned the batter more, maybe we could have gotten 6 or more servings.  I'll definitely make this again as is for a dinner crepe with chicken.  For breakfast or dessert crepes, I would have to add considerably more liquid to thin the batter.

This is a great simple recipe. I use it all the time. I love these little things. When you make them, make lots they go fast. My mom used to make them and freeze them for me to microwave. My 10 yr old put peanut butter on them.

These were great; however, I did add a teaspon of vanilla.  I didn't have vegetable oil so I used olive oil and it seemed fine to me.  I just spread some butter and pure organic maple syrup and it was delish.  I plan on getting some nutella strawberries and making some fresh whip cream. I bet that would be even better!!

A family staple, even my non-cooking husband can do this recipe! I  never wait the time for the batter in the fridge, I just cook them. We wrap the extras in plastic wrap and store in the fridge (although leftovers are a rarity).

Wonderful and easy too!  I did a little research on crepes and found out that if you want them to be easy you HAVE to let the batter sit at least an hour... and pick a pan that the batter and spread out THINLY in to the edges. That said-- these were very yummy!

SO EASY! My 9 year old daughter and I made these this morning!  We put banana's and nutella inside.  Yummy!  We did NOT refrigerate the batter.  Will make these all the time now!

I had to come back and rate this recipe. I made as is and they are perfect.. I have never had success with any crepe recipe until now.. I stuffed them with roasted peppers, eggs, and poured salsa and cheese on top. Thanks for a great recipe.

Used this recipe to make crepes for the first time.  Followed it as-is - I had time, so I did the blender and refrigerating.  The crepes came out wonderful!  I used a ladle to spoon the batter into the pan and also used the ladle to coat the pan.  For some reason, this worked better for me than tilting the pan.  I did find I needed to re-brush with oil every 2-3 crepes.  My 4-year old loved them!  For toppings, we had strawberries, blueberry sauce, cottage cheese, whipped cream, chocolate peanut butter, syrup and whatever else we could find.  Delicious and so easy - will definitely make again!

Very easy and delicious. My husband made them for Valentine's day. We stuffed them with thin slices of banana, drizzled with melted chocolate, and topped with chocolate whipping cream. Way back then, he also use to stuff them with scrambled eggs, and others with a thick jam. So easy, and they take no time to make.

I've made this recipe many times, when I'm in a pinch and need something to offer guests.  Crepes are always a crowd pleaser and super easy!   This recipes tastes great and unlike the other recipes which omit the egg white and use butter, this uses all of the egg and also vegetable oil.  It's is more nutritious that way and also much easier.      This recipe is very versatile.  In my desire to eat vanilla crepes , I added 1 tsp. vanilla, 2 tbsp. sugar, and 1 tsp. molasses.  Fantastic!

Good consistency to work with.  If making a sweet filling, replace a tablespoon of milk with vanilla.

I had always used a melted butter recipe before this, but this one seemed to have better consistency than my other recipe.  Try eating these with a cream cheese, vanilla sauce, powdered sugar,  fresh bananas, strawberries, and whipped cream combination.  Yum!

PERFECT CREPES! I make these for my boyfriend every Sunday for breakfast. I usually fill mine with a berry compote (blueberries, raspberries, cottage cheese, a little sour cream and sugar) and he prefers nutella, banana slices and peanut butter. Adding about 3 tablespoons of cinnamon gives the batter good flavor. Thank you!

Good recipe. Made three changes:  1. Used bread flour instead of all purpose as that's what we had on hand  2. Used butter instead of oil (melted butter before whisking into dough)  3. Didn't bother refrigerating it at all (too hungry to wait so just whisked it all together and threw it on the pan).   Great with a savoury filling!

These are perfect.  After an hours rest, the batter produced gorgeous, browned, soft, delicate crepes.  One batch makes exactly eight crepes.  Great recipe.

Perfect every time.  When it is just for our little family I use whole wheat flour only and, while they aren't as "pretty", they taste the same and work great.  With ww flour and organic eggs and milk, very  healthy with fresh fruit in them.

The flavour was nice. I made a double batch and there were no leftovers. They were a little too thick though but that's likely a cook's error.

Fantastic! I made this per the instructions (but doubled it), but added 2 tsp of vanilla extract and a dash of nutmeg as suggested by a previous reviewer. They browned well and were moist and delicious! I'm a newbie cook and had no problems making these whatsoever.

They turned out awesome! I mixed the batter with a whisk and put it in the freezer for 5min. When they were all done I spread some Nutella, added bananas, wrapped them up, and poured warm strawberry sauce all over (simmer strawberries a little water and sugar). Boyfriend couldn't get enough. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Excellent!  I made 2 batches, the first one as written.  The second one I added vanilla and sugar like others had recommended, the second batch was better.  Do the alterations and these are awesome.  I served with blueberries or strawberries.

Can't believe how healthy AND tasty these are! Most crepe recipes call for a ton of butter... When I first tried these I didn't believe that they weren't terrible for me. :)

i just made these crepes and they were easy and delicious !!!!  To think, I almost bought packaged crepes at the store.  I added sugar and vanilla and filled them with strawberries with powdered sugar on top with a drizzle of chocolate.  Yummy !!  I will certainly be using this recipe often.

Awesome!!  I followed the recipe and added 1 T sugar and 1 tsp vanilla, like another reviewer suggested.  I used cooking spray on the pan each time I made a new crepe.  This was the first time I have ever made crepes, and they came out perfect and paper-thin... I didn't even have any "practice" crepes!  I filled mine with fat-free, sugar-free pudding and chopped up bananas.  Yummy!

This is an amazing recipe!  My mom made us crepes all the time when we were kids and we loved them.  Ate them with powdered sugar and lemon.  Her recipe was equal parts milk and flour and the only other ingredient was eggs.  As I have made them over the years, I thought they seemed a bit thick and on Saturday I decided to look for a new recipe.  I found this one!!  It is perfect, makes the crepes very thin, which is how you want them.  I added about a tsp. of sugar and dash of vanilla.  I ate them with cottage cheese and raspberries, then powdered sugar and lemon!  Both were absolutely delicious.  I am using this recipe from now on.

I just made these and o em gee... it's really good! I think the key is to use the blender to make it thus it achieves the right consistency and distribute the ingredients evenly. Used my crepe pan, and also added 2 tsp of pure vanilla into the batter. Delicious! Thank you so much for sharing the recipe. =)

I haven't tried this yet, but definitely will for a dessert. My Oma in Austria made a sort of "crepe"; we would have them for breakfast and fill w/Fruit Jellies, or spreads, then top off w/some powdered sugar. I imagine you could do the same with this. Yum!

I don't know much about how a crepe is supposed to be, but they are both rubbery and tender at the same time if that's possible. This was a good recipe for me. Thanks!

The perfect crepe recipe! I add a little vanilla and sugar when i'm making them for breakfast or dessert, but make them as written for savory fillings.  My boyfriend declared them his new favorite breakfast (filled with caramelized peaches & cream)!

This was really simple and good. I followed another member's suggestion and added cinnamon and vanilla. Yum! We also had it with fresh lemon juice and sugar and a blueberry sauce I made with frozen blueberries, sugar and a little bit of lemon juice cooked together.

Great recipe!  I made these on a whim, and so didn't have things I would normally use for filling/sauce.  To improvise, I stirred sweetener into sour cream for filling and heated jelly for a drizzle of sauce.  Delicious and easy.

Really loved this recipe. I used vanilla soy milk instead of milk and added more vanilla and they were amazing. I filled them with nutella, bananas, strawberries for a dessert. Then for a breakfast filled them with yogurt and granola. There are endless possibilities. My familiy loved them!

I used these crepes to make blintzes as well as regular crepes.  They are very easy to make, and everyone loved them.

Wow - these were really good and really easy!  My first try at crepes and I will definitely make these again.  I took others' advise and added a Tbs of sugar and a tsp of vanilla.  I then just warmed a cup of Yoplait fruit yogurt for the inside, sliced bananas for the top and whipped topping to finish.  Yum!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Fantastic! Was easy once you got the hang of it. Took a while to get a good one though. I used whole wheat flower and stuffed with leftover turkey, spinach, mushroom and jack cheese. Topped with a garlic cream sauce! Man oh man. Very tasty!

It was good, but not exactly what I was looking for.  SO EASY to make!  It was my first time ever making crepes, so I think it was okay. I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on one side after I flipped it and then put a few chocolate chips on it, folded it up and put on a plate and put a scoop of whipped cream on it, SO GOOD!  My 11 month old ate two of them (without the chocolate and cream). It was a good place to start and I will try again, maybe with some butter in place of the oil, and add some sugar to the mix.

These were pretty good.  Made them and served with some strawberry yogurt, homemade lemon curd, and sprinkled with a touch of powdered sugar.  Husband had his with strawberry jam and lemon curd.  Leftovers kept well in the fridge for a day, and were great with cheddar fried onions, sausage crumbles and chipotle cheese shreds.  Keeping this one in my recipe box to make again.

I added a little vanilla extract - they came out smelling so yummy.  We filled them with warmed raspberries, fresh strawberries with CoolWhip, and warmed blueberries mixed with blueberry syrup.

This is your traditional crepe and it's so delicious!  As other users mentioned, just add 1 TBSP sugar and a tsp vanilla for dessert crepes.  So good!

Ate them as a wrap for sandwich filling and tasted really good. Personally I find the mixture not quite runny enough for me to spread out the mixture in the pan before it starts setting so I'll try adding a bit more milk the next time. It worked out this time round since I needed it to wrap the filling without it tearing.

This recipe is great for a versatile crepe.  I had leftover mix the next morning and made it like an omelette with veggies inside.  Definitly a keeper as far as quick and easy is concerned.

Excellent, didnt use blender-didn't see the point. I just whisked it by hand in a bowl, came out delicious. Don't think it quite made 8, maybe 6-7.
Had it with caramelized apple and vanilla ice cream mmmmmmm

I cannot believe that I successfully made crepes. My parents tried to make them once when I was a kid (I think they were all the rage in the 70s) and they were a complete disaster. Probably due to lack of teflon pans! But mine came out beautifully. The first one was a little tricky to flip, but the rest were perfect. My kids loved them!

Oh boy! These are perfect crepes. Simple original crepe recipe. If you are browsing and trying to decided which crepe recipe to use, look no further. This is the best one i have tried on this site. It's just perfect, very comparble to the magic pan crepes we have here at MOA.

So simple yet so fantastic! I put mandarin oranges and raspberries in one of mine (looked pretty and tasted delicious) and simply put powdered sugar on another. A refreshing alternative to pancakes. This is a versatile recipe that I'll use often!

I expected a lot more from this recipe. I've never had a crepe from a restaurant before and maybe I should have but after reading the reviews I decided to try them. I will try this recipe again though after having one from a restaurant to compare it to and then rate this again. But based on this alone. I found it to be very bland. My children didn't care for it either. So I wasn't alone.

The batter was so easy to spread over the frying pan and tender.

Very easy & very good.  I have never made crepes before, but wanted to try for Christmas breakfast this year.  I only have a normal non-stick pan so I was a little worried, but they came out perfect every time!  I ended up re-brushing the pan with oil before each crepe just to make sure they didn't stick.  I will use this recipe again for sure.

I love ordering these when I go out to eat but the idea of making them at home was intimidating. I thought special tools and skills were required to make them so light and thin but I was wrong! This recipe is awesome and I made beautiful crepes on my first try! I make them all the time now and I top them with some powdered sugar and homemade strawberry compote. Yum!!

SIMPLE AND WONDERFUL!  These came out perfect, easy to make and so tasty!  I did add a little sugar and a couple drops of vanilla, and I didn't refrigerate the batter as I was too impatient to try them out.  The only thing I noticed was that I needed more like 1/3 cup of batter per crepe, perhaps my pan is a bit big.  I will be making these over and over, may even throw a crepe party to show them off!

It was awesome.  I followed the recipe and it came out almost like the crepes I had at the fests in Germany.  I used whipped cream with bananas as topping and some with nutella spread.

Oh my goodness!! Who knew making crepes could be so easy!  I made these for a MOPS meeting, and got many comments about how impressive it was that I MADE them myself... I just kept saying how easy it was. It dirtied two things: blender and pan.  Amazing.  We'll be making these over and over, I am sure.
Thanks!

I've never made crepes before and now I don't know why as these were so easy. I filled them with cheese and bacon filling from this site and a mushroom and watercress filling. All the family really enjoyed them. I'm going to make them as dessert next time. Thanks.

These were the perfect consistency! Not too thick, not too thin. I added some vanilla and a couple tbs sugar to make them sweet.
