I made this recipe in an effort to duplicate a salad I had at my favorite Thai restaurant and it was even better than what I was trying to accomplish.  I used it on lettuce salad and had everyone asking for the recipe.  Thanks!

Super quick and easy - makes a great salad dressing (minus the hot pepper flakes).

Taking into consideration the other reviews of this dressing being too salty, I reduced the soy sauce to 2T (instead of the original 6T) and use 1/2T of powdered ginger instead of fresh.  I keep the other measurements the same.  Not salty and with a bit of tang, this soy-sesame dressing is now a staple in our kitchen - great on meats, salads, veggies and noodles.

Pretty good.  But VERY salty.  Next time I will use either low sodium soy sauce or rice vinegar. Otherwise, a keeper.

This was the perfect dressing for the Asian Pasta Salad recipe also from Allrecipes!  I think it would be too intense for most tossed salads, but was just right for this.

I've used nothing but this dressing for a year-I put it on salads, vegetables, and even meats.  I make a double batch and make sure I always have some in the refrig. I kind of make it a little different each time, now using balsamic vinegar instead of rice wine.

This is okay, but I prefer my version...get rid of the sugar, red pepper flakes and mayonnaise.  Add a 1/4 cup of Canola oil, cut the soy sauce in half and use a tsp. of sesame tahini.  YUMMMY!!! Especially on fresh greens!

This was really tasty.  I put it over a salad of shredded lettuce, strips of cucumber, green and yellow pepper, onion, and chow mein noodles.  I did make a change with the soy sauce.  After reading the other reviews I added soy sauce to my liking which was about 2-3 tablespoons.

I took other reviewers suggestion of cutting down the soy sauce by 1/2.  I did. Note: I also used low sodium soy sauce.  Even with this adjustment it was WAY WAY too salty!  Off the charts sodium alert!!!! What a disappointment.  I had to add more of the other ingrediants just to compensate for the saltiness.  My suggestion would be to mix everything up except the soy sauce - then add it slowly mixing & tasting along the way until you get the right balance.  Plus don't forget to use Low Sodium Soy sauce.

WAY too salty for my own personal tastes, otherwise I like the combination of ingredients. This is probably just better served with the blandest of dishes for extra flavour.

Really, really good! Yes, this was a bit salty, but I used it on a rice salad and it was perfect. Next time I will use a low sodium soy sauce.

I added 1/4  cup of fresh orange juice.  This made it very similar to a restaurant that my family went to for years with our Japanese exchange students. My favorite dressing of all time!!!

Excellent base. I cut the soy in half and also added part Mirin with the rice wine vinegar and lieu of sugar used honey. Also add some fresh minced ginger root and garlic.  Try some roasted ground sesame to get the added sesame flavor. Also makes a great marinade.

I followed the advice and used only 2 T of low sodium soy sauce.  Very tasty.  (Also used honey instead of sugar).  I can't even imagine how 6 T would taste!  Salt fest!

Very good but a little too salty. Will definitely use again but maybe use less Soy Sauce, more mayo, sugar and vinegar. AND I even used lower sodium soy sauce. Otherwise....a great Asian dressing.  A definite keeper!

Like other reviewers stated, this is VERY salty & strong using the recipe.  I toned the salty down by putting an extra Tbsp of sugar and mayonnaise in the mixture.  It was very tasty using those adjustments.

Very good! I would definately make it again. The only difference I would make is add a little less garlic. If you like garlic, though, it will be fine just as is.

OMG...this is SO good!! I've made it many times, and it tastes almost exactly like the dressings I get in the Japanese restaurants I go to, minus the garlic & red pepper flakes. EXCELLENT! Once in a while, I make a substitution by using tempura sauce in place of the soy sauce; use less, however, since tempura sauce is a concentrate. Best thing to do is add it by taste. Mmmmmmm!
