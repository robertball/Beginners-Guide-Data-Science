Delicious frosty treat! I love milkshakes and this really hit the spot. I left out the ice as ice cream is cold enough on it's own. I added the additional vanilla to increase the flavor. I guess this can be as thick or as thin as you like - it all depends on how big your "scoops" of ice cream are and just add the milk until you get the desired thickness. Perfect topped with whipped cream and a cherry!

This is soooo yummy and it makes the perfect milkshake.  My blender is really bad with ice so I leave that out completely.  I do as the submitter suggests and add a dash of vanilla.  My 4 year old loves this. It's also good with chocolate ice cream. Thanks Shannon

Very good. I left out the ice because I hate ice chunks in my drinks.

This shake was so simple and delicious, that I am surprised I didn't think of it myself. I used chocolate ice cream, too, and it was fabulous.

This was excellent. My boys love making this and when they are in the mood for a chocolate milkshake they just add chocolate syrup. Thanks :)

This may be because of variation in ice cream brands, but this did not work out for me at all. It was FAR too much milk and came out runny -- even after I added more ice cream to try to even it out!   I would be really cautious about using this recipe -- in future, I'll start with very little milk and add more by feel.  I still gave it two stars because ice cream is delicious, even made into a runny milkthing.

Okay. I had little tiny chunks of ice in my shake which I didn't like. Not sure if it was my blender not working right or just how the shake came out. Would have been better w/o the ice.

I'm pretty sure I did it right and followed the directions, but mine was all milky and the consistency was like water.

Good milkshake recipe! I used strawberry ice cream and frozen strawberries instead of ice and it turned out pretty good. I think next time I would add more berries or a strawberry syrup for more flavor.

This calls for too much milk for our tastes. I only used half of what is called for, and decided not to pour in the rest. I didn't think the ice cube added or detracted from anything. I used strawberry milk because my daughter wanted a pink milkshake but without strawberries in it.

It was alright, not enough vanilla for me; even with the vanilla extract.
