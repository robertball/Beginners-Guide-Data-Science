Pretty good. I used 1.5x the meat, 2 peppers, 1.5 large onions probably could have used 1 large one, a full pack of sliced fresh mushrooms... made homemade sweet and sour sauce from another Allrecipes recipe... and it was really very tasty!!

Super simple and full of flavor. My wok does not have a cover so I just stir-fried it continually throughout the entire cooking time. I was afraid the sweet and sour sauce would make it too sweet but it was perfect.

Very tasty. I followed the recipe but next time I will chop the ginger instead if slicing.

Delicious. Wasn’t too thrilled when I’d bite not a piece of that thin sliced ginger. But this recipe is great. I’d add extra steak and serve it just over veggies next time. Yum!

Smells fantastic. Added a few bits of citrus to add extra flavour. Perfect and easy to make.... love it
