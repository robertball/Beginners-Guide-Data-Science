As written this sauce is only about 3 stars. Ater reviewing what others had said I altered the recipe and I feel it elevates the sauce to possibly even 5 stars.  The sheer ease of making the sauce and the ingredients makes this a winner.  I skipped the whole roux making and did as follows.     I sauteed the shallots in butter and added about 2 cloves of garlic.  Added the wine and reduced it by about half.  Mixed a few tablespoons of flour into the fat free half and half (didn't use heavy cream no need for Xtra fat) and poured the mixture into the saute pan.   Cooked it a few more minutes until it thickened.  Do not boil. Just simmer.  I added fresh chopped parsley at the very end. Didn't use thyme b/c I thought it might interfere with the lobster raviolis I was using. Very easy sauce and good for practically anytype of light seafood such as sea bass, tilapia and even shrimp. Thanks for sharing.  Will use this recipe again.

Okay, this had a very nice flavor, but I found the directions to be just a bit weird. First of all, why did I have to make so much roux when I only needed two or three tablespoons? And after adding the roux and thickening the sauce, why did it say to cook five more minutes to eliminate the starchy taste, when I already did that by cooking the roux until it was brown to begin with? It's a nice sauce, but I think this recipe needs some serious editing.

This sauce tasted fantastic, however it is not a quick one.  It took me almost half an hour and my fish was cooked well before that.  Now I know, I can plan better. Excellent flavour though.

I love this recipe. I made a rolled chicken breast stuffed with sundried tamatoes, proscuitto, spinach leaves, and feta cheese.  I used this sauce to top it off.

Paslea1987 was the most useful addition to create a luxurious sauce. I added capers instead of Thyme for an extra bit of brine taste. I used a Riesling for extra sweetness in the sauce.

Good basic white wine sauce recipe, added a lot of black pepper salt and a little cayenne pepper and lemon. On the bland side without the additions.

I made this for dinner tonight and thought it turned out yummy! I used a gewurztraminer and the flavor was a little off, but ended up tasting GREAT with salmon.  I also didnt have shallots so I used diced garlic and some onion powder.
