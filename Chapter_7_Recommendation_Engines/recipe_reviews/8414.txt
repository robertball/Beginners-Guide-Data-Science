Lovely and moist. Perfect with a warm cup of tea.
I made an icing with orange zest, orange juice and confectioners sugar and sprinkled with candied orange peel. It was great!

I searched and searched for a decent orange cake recipe -- more specifically, one without liqueur (because if you're making an orange cake, surely you want a fresh flavor!) This one sounded great because it was so simple, yet it gave precise mixing directions -- and I wasn't disappointed! The cake was quite moist and tender, due to the addition of the whipped whites at the end. My guests were very pleased with the velvety texture and smooth, natural orange flavor. I used the 
"Simply Orange" brand for my orange juice, and I used a tad more than 2 tbs orange zest. Also, I paired it with cream cheese buttercream, which complemented the orange fantastically. If you like your cakes on the sugar side, or if you prefer very light, airy cakes, this one may not be the recipe for you. If you like moist, tender, subtle cakes, you've found your recipe!

1/22/02 This cake is simple to prepare, but I probably won't be making this again. Beyond the ease of preparation, my family and I found this to be  very bland. There was very little orange flavor, and I guess I was expecting something more.  The cake was very light in texture, but seemed to be lacking in flavor. Sorry!

I made these into cupcakes and they were really flavourful and satisfying :) I used the juice and zest of two sunkist oranges, which means around 2/3 cup of orange juice and 2 tbsp of zest. The taste was just perfect, not overly cloying on the orange and wonderfully sponge-like. I'll definitely make this again! One thing for those cupcake makers to take note though: they don't rise much, so you would probably like to fill it more than 2/3.

This was very good & I had everything on hand.  I added an orange glaze *1C conf. sugar , 1/4C orange juice, & 1 tablespoon egg white - let cake cool before making.  I used orange marmalade instead of zest & I love it

I husband and me just love this cake. Is moist 
and rich in flavour. I will bake it weekly so that my husband can have it with his daily cup of tea. He is one person who never like any kind of dessert or cakes but I am so glad that he just love this one. Thanks Bee Lian.

My husband has made this twice & I love it. He just sprinkles powdered sugar on top & it is so refreshing. I love the smell in the house while this is baking. YUM. We didn't have self rising flour so used regular the 1st time & the 2nd time he checked & you can add 1 1/2 tsp baking powder & 1/2 tsp salt to make self rising flour (per cookbook).

I made this recipe for a family party and this cake disappeared from the table fast! I found the cake to be moist and flavoursome and did not ice the cake but simply dusted it with icing sugar. Yum Yum. Will definately make this one again.

My husband usually takes something to munch on while in his office as he does not get time for lunch and he just called me to say that he has never had a softer cake before. My toddler insisted on having it for her breakfast.
What else can I say, except - YUMMY!

Very good.  I did not have butter on hand so I used vegetable oil.  I only had one orange so I used the zest and juice of one orange and one lemon to get the right amounts.  I didn't have self-rising flour so made my own by adding 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and a half teaspoon of salt to a cup of flour.  Turned out great.

So easy and good! I've made this twice. The second time, I doubled the recipe to make two 8 inch cake layers. I spread orange marmalade in between the layers. I also reduced the orange peel to one tsp. because the original amount made the cake slightly bitter. I didn't have self-rising flour, so I used cake flour with a tablespoon of baking powder. The cake is great with hot tea!

This cake is yummilcious! I love it. My only complaint is that the recipe makes a small cake. *g* I made it in a bundt pan and covered it with a glaze of 1/4 c. butter, 2/3 c. sugar and 1/3 c. OJ, heated on the stove.

Absolutely love this simple cake - guess loving orange flavor does help, but this is really an almost perfect mixture and I thank you for submitting.  Very good with 7 minute icing.

This was absolutely delicious, perfect as is, no adaptions necessary. I topped it with a light chocolate frosting.  I like all things lemon, so I tried it again using lemon juice instead of the orange juice, just as yummy, used a lemon/orange frosting this time.

I have had so many compliments on this cake.  It's so simple and best of all doesn't need to be frosted.  A simple enough cake to eat as a breakfast cake yet rich enough to serve as an informal desert.  Or put a dollop of whipped cream and some fresh fruit and it's all dressed up.  A fabulous versatile cake.

Very nice and easy recipe.... gives a moist, flavourful cake, great accompaniment to tea or coffee. I used commercial orange juice, which I think gave the cake a slightly bitter edge. Will definitely try again with freshly squeezed orange juice.     Thank you Bee Lian.

Wow this came out really great. The only thing that I would change a little bit, is to add something that really concentrates the flavour, like maybe some orange marmalade instead of part of the juice, because the orange flavour didn't really come through all that much. But it was a good cake with a nice even texture and a beautiful colour.

This is a wonderful cake.  It is a little dense but very good.  It tastes even better after it has been refrigerated overnight.  I used it with the topping from Orange Cream Cake IV: 1 (16 ounce) package frozen whipped topping, thawed; 1/4 teaspoon orange extract; 16 ounces sour cream; 2 cups confectioners' sugar, then put leftover orange zest on top.  I made it two weeks ago, and my family loved it so much I've made it another three times since.  This will be going in my recipe box forever!

A delicate and small cake, which is nicely moist and light. It went down well with my family, and had a good orange flavour.

I'm not sure what happened.  I doubled the recipe to fill the bundt cake pan and it sunk when I took it out of the oven.  The top and bottom were golden brown (baked for about 45 min) the upper half had the texture of raw dough or half baked cake. Is it because I used the silicone bundt cake pan?  Not sure what happened.  The flavor what very good though, just enough orange flavoring.

I have made this cake numerous times since I found this recipe 2 months ago.  Even changed the pan and made orange cake "muffins" instead and brought it to work.  Everyone loved it!

I used to make this cake when my son, nephews and nieces were very very young (14-15 years ago).  It was their favourite cake then. Today, 15 April 2016, I made it again after all those years.  It still bakes well, tastes divine and will once again become a family favourite to a new generation of young nephews and nieces:)

We've been making this cake in my family for years.  It's our favourite orange cake.  So moist and buttery.  I definitely recommend it!

This cake is delicious, I will do it again and again. It is moist and flavorurful. I was thinking to put some glaze on top, but it is great just like that. Great recipe.

The best cake I've ever baked. I add an extra 1/2 a cup of orange juice. The trick is in beating the egg white thoroughly. I once rushed the process and didn't whisk it enough. The result was a crumbly but still tasty disaster. It's a small cake so double up if you've got a crowd to please.

This is a delicious recipe. I will be sure to double when I make it again as it is a small cake and was so good it went too fast. I made cream cheese frosting that I added zest from large orange. Got many compliments.

Great cake.  Made it a couple days before I needed it and had to leave it on the bench but it was still very moist when we ate it.

This is fabulous.  I was in a hurry, didn't read the recipe first and did everything absolutely backwards. The only thing I did right was to beat the whites and fold them in at the end.  Used plain flour and it did not rise much, but the flavor is wonderful and it's still light and moist though a little flat.The sides got very very brown and I thought I had baked it too long and it would be dry, but those crispy sides are so good.  If I save calories by not frosting it, maybe I can eat the whole thing?

I liked this very much.  The orange flavor is delicious.  My family did not go for it, but I think that this will appeal more to adult tastes.

This was delicious! Moist, light, perfect amount of orange flavor. I served it at a dinner party with a dusting of powdered sugar. When serving it, I topped each slice with a drizzle of a simple homemade strawberry sauce and some fresh whipped cream with orange zest. It disappeared immediately, and my family asked me to make it again the next day!

Very good & very moist! I used the zest from a small orange & added a tsp of pure orange extract..had lots of orange flavor w/out being overpowering. I didn't frost mine either...just dusted it w/ some powdered sugar. Thanks for the recipe, Song Bee Lian!

This recipe was easy and delicious. It made a simple nice small sized cake. I added 4 oz. of cream cheese because I wanted it a little denser. I would definitely make it again.

I thought this cake was delicious.  I doubled all of the ingredients and baked it in a Bundt pan.  It is dense, rich, and super moist.  I will be making this cake again and again.  Thanks!

I found this cake to be very crumbly and it had a pretty weak flavour. Don't think I'll be making it again.

I was looking for something flavorful to bake with few ingredients and this cake was perfect! I used fresh squeezed oranges which added to the strong flavor. Wonderfully moist and easy to make!

Outstanding! I whipped this baby up in no time and hubby stated that this was the best cake he's ever eaten (that wasn't chocolate). It's a basic recipe which you can experiment with. I'm sure there are a 1000 ways for me to screw up this delicious cake. Let the adventure begin!

Wow! Great basic cake and nice color with no artificial dyes! 
Changes I made: I only baked 25 minutes and it was done. Used 1/2 cup sugar and added 1 teaspoon pure orange extract.  I only had enough zest for 1 tablespoon. One big orange only makes about 1 tablespoon zest.
Frosted with the frosting recipe from the Orange Cream Cake IV on this site and added mandarin oranges as an accent after drying them with a paper towel.
