I did leave the peppers in for two days instead of the two hours that the recipe suggested as a starting point, but it was not too spicy.   It had just a nice spicy smokey flavor that will be great in a Bloody Mary, or my preferred drink, a Caesar.  I'm going to leave the peppers in for a couple of more days for just a bit more heat.
