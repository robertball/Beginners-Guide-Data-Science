YUM! These were quick and easy to make with ingredients we had on hand. The coconut didn't offer too much on flavor - I enjoyed the light crunch but the kids didn't care for it too much. This was good enough to make a second round so we omitted the coconut and my daughter added honey my son added chocolate syrup and I added a bit of mayonnaise to my own taco. After sampling the kids' version I believe they really took the recipe to the next level and was the perfect touch. This is absolutely going into my lunchbox meal rotation! Thank you!
