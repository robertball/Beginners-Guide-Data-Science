Used rapid-rise yeast which allowed me to skip the softening process.  I mixed yeast with the flour and stirred into wet mixture as indicated by the recipe. It took about 1 1/2 hours to double in size at room temperature. 

Brushed it with butter when it came out of oven and sprinkled with generous pinch of kosher salt for a little extra salty crunch. 

Next time, I'm going to try shaping into a loaf and cooking free form on a parchment lined baking sheet. I want square slices so I can easily pop them in the toaster. 

This recipe is a keeper!

I made the dough according to the recipe, but doubled it. It worked with straight doubling. The texture was perfect. (The first time I made it was a single batch in a casserole dish). For 2018 Christmas I divided the doubled batch and split 3 ways into glass loaf pans. These small loaves are very cute gifts, It is so aromatic, my husband and daughter polished off one loaf before night fall and I am currently making another double batch.  This bread is awesome!!!

Itâ€™s amazing that my 92 year old mother has been making this exact bread since I was a little girl (about 50+ years)!   I have made it several times in the past.  I love it!   Angie must be around 100 years old!   Wow!   Great recipe!

I followed the recipe as written, one of the easiest and tasty yeast breads I have made.  My loaf was high and rounded, even prettier than the picture in the magazine.

This recipe has been around for many years and is my favorite "go to" when desiring to serve a specialty bread for family and friends.  It's that  marriage of  Dill and Onion that create an irresistible gastonomic delight to even the most novice of  palates.  I've only had one failure in the many times of making it which was related to the yeast.  Four thumbs up for this recipe.

This is just like my Grandma Kyes' recipe. I love this bread. My husband even likes it with hamburgers.

Followed recipe exactly, except I used fresh dill.  This was the 1st time I ever baked bread from scratch and it came out great!  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent flavor and texture!  After baking I brushed it with butter, and sprinkled it with a little Mrs. Dash, instead of adding more salt to the recipe.  
This recipe has now been added to my favorite breads file.

Super easy and delightfully delicious.  I substituted 1/2 t of Italian Seasoning in place of the dill seeds and it worked perfectly.  Will definitely make again in the future.
