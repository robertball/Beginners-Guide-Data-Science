Wow! This was impressive. The first batch I  made I grated the tomato and it was a bit too stringy. The next batch I blended the tomato for a few seconds and it was much better texture. Also be careful not to boil too long. I didn't have enough moisture so the jam was too thick.

This is a great recipe. You can use Strawberry gelatin instead of Raspberry gelatin for a different taste, if you have a lot of green tomatoes left in the garden in the fall.

Amazing! I have some raspberry jam I made from fresh picked crop to compare this to and, except for the seeds, you wouldn't know the difference. Worth picking tomatos green on purpose, and not just using the last of the crop! Great for recipes, too. Makes good raspberry dressings.

This was my first attempt at mock raspberry jam. I followed the recipe exactly using my Cuisinart to chop up the tomatoes. I filled  six pint-sized jars. My family likes it pretty well and it is a reasonable substitute for  real fruit jam. And, a fun way to use up all my green tomatoes.

I had so much fun making this FAST recipe. It tasted wonderful. I used Strawberry, rasberry, peach and orange jellos for variety; wow they all worked super!!!! My only problem is they are not thickening. Any help would be appreciated.

Wow, this really looks like raspberry jam.  My daughter loves it on toast.  I am a conisseur of jams, and it is not bad as far as jams go.  Of course I prefer the real thing but it is a good way of using up the green tomatoes.

This is a fantastic recipe. I followed the recipe pretty closely except for reducing the sugar a little.  Put tomatoes(the egg-sized) through the food processor, yielding about 6c.  I added 5 c. sugar to that.  After cooking the requisite time, I added a partial packet of liquid pectin I had sitting in the fridge (I wanted to get rid of it and knew it wouldn't hurt the recipe) along with the jello - followed the rest of the instructions.  Great consistency, great color, excellent flavor.  Raspberry jam is my favorite jam and in my opinion, and not to take away from the results here, this jam is more "reminiscent" of Raspberry Jam rather than seeming to be the real thing.  However, I will use this recipe any time I can get my hands on more green tomatoes.  This jam is certainly cheaper than making real raspberry jam, which only adds to the value of this recipe.  Oh, I got 7-3/4 250ml jars of jam.  Not bad for 4 c. sugar and 2 small packets of jello.  I processed the jars in the canner 10 minutes.  Thanks for such a simple recipe.

I made this last year and we loved it.  Even had to give the recipe to several friends.  I shall now proceed to make two batches using up the remainder of green tomatoes.  Of course, it doesn't taste quite like the 'real stuff' but oleo doesn't taste like butter either.

OMG!!  I can't believe these taste sooo good. And I mean they as I made all different kinds after the Raspberry came outso well.  Gave a jar to neighbor and her 4 yr old gobbled it up with crackers.  Hers was orange Jam.  The only change I made was to reduced the sugar by almost half. I like sweet but it was a bit too sweet. I made this with Orange, Cranberry (had this for Thanksgiving) and Strawberry in addition to the original Raspberry.  Would have loved to give these in jars for Xmas gifts but all gone.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars is for the changes I made, but I give the concept 5 stars!! Due to texture issues, I peeled the tomatoes first, put them in the blender for a bit, then strained out the seeds. I also reduced the sugar to 3 cups, then boiled it on a lower heat until it had condensed quite a bit. We experimented with different flavors of Jello (by halving the recipe, you only have to use 1 box) and, other than the color, they were all great. The red turned out the best as far as color goes. My favorite part is that I can use all the end of the season tomatoes from the garden!

Wow. This is shockingly good. Noone can believe it has green tomatoes in it. I've given it to neighbors, fed it to picky two year olds. No complaints and way cheaper than using fruit if you've got green tomatoes that will go to waste if not used. I will be doing this every year I have green tomatoes. Thanks! Oh, I did cut the sugar to 3 cups after doing a batch with 4 cups and the 3 cups is much better.

Sorry, but I found this to be a poor substitute for raspberry jam.  It had kind of a raspberry flavor, but just not like the real thing.

I shared this with my Father-in-law. We both love that we can utilize all our tomatoes. No more waste! No one has been able to tell that the jam was made without any berries. Love it!

This is pretty good jam,  a little on the sweet side but still not bad. The only problem I had was it was so thick it would not spread, but I put it in the microwave for abot 20 seconds and this did the trick.

I'd give this more stars if I could.  Kids, young and old, love this.  But don't tell the little ones that it's made with green tomatoes.  They'll turn up their noses.  Just tell them it's raspberry and they'll want mo', mo', mo'!!!!

Kinda started out as a joke that i can make jelly out of anything. Well this proved to everyone that it can be done. Fantastic flavor, easy to make, and kids and adults alike love it. Took the sugar down to 3 cups and added 4 tablespoons of pectin. Strawberry and raspberry have been the biggest hit. Don't wait till fall to make this, pull some early and enjoy.  You will not regret making.

I have not made this yet but plan to do it today. I see that some people stated that it did not thicken and I also saw that some were going to cut down on the sugar...big mistake. The sugar needs to be in there to gel it. I have tried cutting down on sugar with regular strawberry jam and it turns out runny...fine for ice cream topping tho.

This recipe was incredible! It taste just like the real thing. I changed it slightly though. I cut the amount of sugar in half and it came out nice and sweet. I think it would have been too sweet otherwise. 
I will definitly make this again, but with other flavors.

I purposefully altered this recipe to fit my craving for a pepper jelly.  I used the green tomatoes and also shredded 1 medium sized Pablano pepper. I omitted the sugar, added the raspberry gelatin as well as 1/4 cup black raspberries. It has the sweetness in the mouth at the beginning and a tang at the end that tastes great with crackers.

Yuck!  Maybe my expectations were too high, but I though this was totally nasty!  Tasted like beets to me.  Might try again (I have a LOT of green tomatoes), but will add lemon juice or citric acid.

I was hoping to like this recipe, but maybe I didn't do something right.  It had the consitency of super thick jello with a weird after taste.  Maybe I didn't simmer the tomatoes enough, but I did set the timer.  I made 1/2 a batch.  It's still sitting in my fridge.  I may throw it out, or learn to stomach it.

I've made this recipe for the past nine tomato seasons, and it is FABULOUS! 

BUT, one word of warning ... FREEZE this mixture! DO NOT water bath can it. 

As a Master Food Safety Advisor with the University of Idaho, I can recommend only TESTED and APPROVED recipes that come from a U. S. land grant university, the USDA or another reputable source. In my research, I couldn't find a tested and approved recipe using these ingredients. 

WHY is this important? You don't want to RISK food borne illness. 

The jelly keeps just fine in freezer containers and you'll enjoy it more, knowing that you aren't risking anyone's health. 

Plus, by freezing, you can adjust the sugar content. If four cups is too much, you can change it. 

I recently blogged about this recipe here: http://blog.mydbsupply.com/raspberry-jam-from-green-tomatoes/

I was very skeptical.  But I thought, what the heck, gonna ditch the green tomatoes anyway.  Oh my gosh - this stuff is AWESOME!  I ran the tomatoes through my food processor til real fine.  The first batch I doubled -  I added a box of raspberry and a box of blackberry jello.  I also cut the sugar down to 3 cups per batch and I did add a box of fruit pectin.  The jam set beautifully.  It is very good!

I made this type of jam years ago.  Using blackberry Jell-o is my favorite.  @willkitty, my instructions say to set in the refrigerator for several hours before using to set up.  I guess it's not supposed to up until then.

Not sure if mine turned out. This was my very first time canning anything and I'm not sure if it is supposed to be runny. I'm nervous. The directions wern't as detailed as I need them. Yikes....

To get this to set up, be sure to completely dissolve jello, stir at least 4 minutes. I just did a comparison between my mock and my real raspberry. The real raspberry has the tart flavor we know love and the mock raspberry tastes like raspberry jello, very sweet, no tartness at all. Kids will love it though.

The second time I made this I used yellow tomatoes and cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups.  That worked too.

This is an outstanding recipe.  I did add lemon juice and canned it rather than freezing. It did not last long and I can't wait for more green tomatoes.  Best "raspberry" jam EVER!

Never made jam before; this was fun and so easy.  After filling, however, I processed in a hot water bath for 10 minutes.  (Worried not necessary but some of the reviewers did the same.()  I also decreased sugar to 3 cups based on posted  reviews; followed the directions to the letter and had enough for 4 jelly jars.  Coincidentally, I made green tomato salsa (canned) using tomatillos which was cheaper and easier than red tomatoes.  Wonder if these could be used.  I think peeling the green tomatoes would be a splendid idea; used  food processor to shred the tomatoes. used about 6-7  medium sized tomatoes; could have processed just a bit more in the food processor as I retrieved some significant bits out of the mixture while in the first stages of boiling.  Great experience and thank you for this recipe.  Next time, I think adding a jalapeno would give it a great kick as well.

My lids just snapped so all I have tasted is what was left in the pot and some drips but I think it's going to be nothing more than dark pink and sweet.  It seemed way too sweet, even though I cut the sugar down to 3.5 cups and added a teaspoon of lemon juice.  I used grape tomatoes so that may be a problem and I used artificial flavour raspberry Jello.

Made this last night and it turned out perfect, I did cut the sugar to 3 cups and it is plenty sweet, I also pureed the tomatoes.  It set up beautifully and was delicious on a toasted English muffin, will be  making this again soon to use up the green tomatoes.  Love the ease of freezer jam !

I make this every year with the tomatoes that are still green on the vine from my garden.  I do not shred but roughly chop the tomatoes. Once everything is done boiling I run it through a food mill to remove the skins and give it a smooth texture.

Great easy recipe!  I live in a high altitude (over 5,000 ft), so I had to adjust the cooking time and processing times by 10 min each.  if you live in a high altitude, remember to do that and the jam will come out fine.

This is ok if you're really intent on not wasting tomatoes that won't ripen.  However, this jam has been sitting for months and we have not eaten it as we do not care for the texture.
