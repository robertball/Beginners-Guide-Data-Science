Recipe was very easy and the cake was good, but not anything out of the ordinary.

Not gross! This turned out great in my opinion.  Soft and moist and flavorful.  A couple of things I did differently:  I doubled the amount of topping.  For an 11x17 pan the amount of topping in the recipe didn't come close to covering the top.  I used walnuts because it's what I had on hand.  Also, I think the cooking time is way too much.  I checked it at 30 minutes and it was done, in fact the bottom was starting to get a little too brown so I probably could have pulled it out a few minutes sooner.  Next time I make this I will start checking at 25 minutes It should be golden brown around the edges and a toothpick should come out clean in the middle. Definitely will make again!

This is amazing! Made a wonderful Sunday breakfast. I didn't have sour cream so I used yogurt instead. Also I cut the recipie in half and had a half a can of sweetened condensed milk on hand so I drizzles that over the top of the topping. The result was a moist coffee cake with a sticky-bun like topping. So good!

This was very dense.  It was ok, but not what I was hoping for.  The day before I made this I had some coffee cake that a friend made from a boxed mix, and it was so much better than this I am sorry to say.  I probably won't make this again as it was just average.

I thought this was fantastic!  I made it on a whim and I had all the ingredients on hand, and I really didn't feel like putting forth a ton of effort.  Well, it tastes great and even better the next day.  I used a smidge  more sour cream than called for, and an extra tablespoon of butter on top.

Wonderful texture and nice slightly tangy flavour to the cake itself. I doubled the amount of topping, and stirred half of it into the cake batter.
