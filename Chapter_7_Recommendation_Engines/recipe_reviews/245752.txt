If you like buffalo dip flavor, these are a great alternative to the whole deep frying and chicken skin. I tweeked Step 3 to dip the cauliflower in the bread crumb mixture and I baked longer than stated to make sure the coating was crisp. I usually am not one of those 'take a picture of my food' people, but I did it for this dish! Would I make it again? Oh yeah!

Absolutely Delicious!   I  took this recipe and made it to a T.  My method was just a a little different. All I did was coat the florets with the mixture and scatter them onto a half sheet pan with a medium gauge  rack on it.  Because there was a lot of liquid that drained through, I dumped the mixture back into my bowl using it to put half of the florets back in while I used a plastic zip lock bag to coat the first batch in the crumbs.  I used half of the crumbs for the first batch, then the other half for the second batch.  I just drained the 2nd batch of florets before putting them in the ziplock.
Once I  put them onto the rack, I made sure they were flat and let them bake for 15 minutes.  When the 15 minutes were up, I  switched the oven to broil, high and let it broil for 5 minutes.
The result was a perfectly breaded and crispy morsel of AMAZING!  I WILL be making this over and over again!  Oh my word!  These are so good!

I subbed pulverized pork rinds instead of the croutons for a lower carb option. Turned out great although not very spicy with Franks sauce. Didn't even need the blue cheese dip. Would totally make again!

I made it twice so far. 
I have not made the blue cheese dressing aspect of the recipe. I lazily stick with store bought ranch dressing. 
The fist time I made the recipe I followed the directions. 
The second time I reduced the mayonnaise by 1 tablespoon to bring out more of the buffalo sauce flavor/spice. I used cornbread bread crumbs in place of croutons.  I also cook them longer, maybe about 25-30 minutes, till they are golden brown. 
I really enjoy this recipe. Thank you

Delicious! I skipped the mayo, unnecessary fat. Mixing the buffalo sauce with one egg worked great. The croutons and Parmesan were a brilliant touch, everyone at work was drooling over these. Next time I make them I’ll probably add water to the sauce, as it ended up being a bit salty for my taste, or I just won’t submerge the full leaflets into the buffalo sauce. Other than that, absolutely delicious!

I didn't see the note about serving with celery sticks until it was too late. That would have been a nice addition but this was still really good. The one and only negative thing I have to say about it is that between the croutons, wing sauce, mayo, and parm it was a tad too salty. Other than that, this was perfect. Thanks for sharing!

I omitted the egg and substituted panko bread crumbs for the croutons and seasoned them with garlic salt, garlic powder, nutritional yeast, and pepper.  They turned out great and my entire family enjoyed them.

When you're craving wings and don't want the fat or are a vegetarian - this is a great alternative snack!  I altered the recipe slightly by using panko instead of the croutons and I used ranch instead of blue cheese which was tasty as a dipping sauce as well.  If you like your "wings" spicy, I would add a little more hot sauce.  I also left the cauliflower in the oven about 5-10 minutes longer (or until they were golden brown).  The results were very good!

This was delicious! After reading reviews, this is how I made them: mixed Sweet Baby Ray’s buffalo wings sauce and one egg (no mayo). Put all florets in sauce mixture and stirred to coat. Placed about 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese in zip-lock bag, added coated florets, and shook bag. Cooked these in a preheated air fryer for 10 minutes (gently shaking basket after 5 minutes) at 400 degrees. Served with celery sticks and Ranch dressing for dipping. My meat-eaters in the family enjoyed them and I will make again!

I did change a few things: added vegetarian "chicken" broth power to the mixture of mayo, egg, and hot sauce ( more than stated) and rubbed the coating into the cauliflower with my hands. Next, it all went into a bag with panko. The crumbs stuck better then any other method I've tried. I cooked them in the air fryer for about 8 to 10 at 380  - 400. We dipped them in ranch because that's what I had. They were spicy and the coating was crunchy. This is the best buffalo cauliflower I have ever made.

These were really good! I didn’t measure out the Italian croutons I crushed or the Parmesan cheese, but it still turned out great. Instead of sprinkling the bread crumb mixture I tossed the cauliflower in them. It didn’t full coat them or stay on completely so when putting them on the baking sheet I had to use a fork to scoop and spread it back onto the cauliflower. Next time I’ll try sprinkling the mixture instead. Definitely a great snack and didn’t even need the dipping sauce to make the dish good.

Fantastic recipe! I followed the recipe with one major exception: I used crushed fried onions instead of croutons for the breading. I’ve eaten a lot of buffalo cauliflower and let me tell you, these are next level!

Thank you sooo much for this recipe! It seems so simple but sometimes you just need the basics to give you the boost. Made 3 times now almost exactly like the recipe, however I added a few tablespoons of olive oil into the mixture, left out the bread crumbs (for Keto wifey), and added parmigiana right to mixture. Also added a few shakes of Frank’s red hot dry. Stir/whipped all together with a good fork and then tossed cauliflower in a bowl until fully coated. She loves it! For dip, I took sour cream and added a few healthy shakes of dried dill and just a few wee shakes of salt.. Yum!

WAAAAY TOO MANY BREAD CRUMBS!  (See photo)  there were so many bread crumbs that after 15min it was clear it needed more time because the majority hadn’t even browned.  I will make this again but I will cut down the crumbs to 1 cup.  The taste is amazing other than that.

I made these cauliflower florets for dinner as a side dish.  I added about 1/8 of a cup more of hot sauce, and I bake them in my smoker outside, instead of the oven.  It's a great way to add a twist to cauliflower.  For sure I'll make them again.

Great flavor combinations. Perfect for Super Bowl. No real need to dilute blue cheese dressing down. Skip that step if you want.

Only thing I changed was used Italian bread crumbs instead of the garlic croutons because my husband cannot eat garlic.   Maybe that would have made the difference but I thought that this was just OK.  I did not measure the cauliflower just used 1 medium sized head.  I had lots of breading left over even though I already decreased the amount of bread crumbs to 1 cup.    The cauliflower did not get crispy but it was tasty.  I did pour more wing sauce over the cauliflower as I was eating it.  I may make this again.

I had one head organic cauliflower. I did not have buffalo sauce so I used about 1/4+ hot sauce, about 1 T Earth Balance, soy free butter, and about 1/4 cup + ketchup. Then used the mayo & egg. Instead of croutons, I used gluten free plain bread crumbs, garlic powder and asiago cheese (grated) - it was what I had. Then had a simple, organic ranch and dairy free Daiya blue cheese dressing (was out of sour cream etc). Tastes amazing!!!  Will definitely make again!!!

These were good, but I made another version that didn't include the breadcrumbs and we liked that better. Some of the breading was a bit soggy after baking for the suggested time.

Delicious! Left the egg and cheese out of the coating and used Italian panko as someone else suggested, still turned out great! It took about 30 minutes to cook. Keeping it in week night rotation.

Turned out delicious! To be honest I didn't really measure the sauce. I just eyeballed it, I like spice so I added extra Franks. I used Panko bread crumbs with some garlic, onion, and a hearty dash of chili powder. Like other reviews I cooked them about 10 minutes long than stated in the recipe. They have a great flavor, nice kick and a crispy outside. I'm going to experiment with different methods to make them even more crispy, but for now I just had to keep from eating them all.

It's a shame because there is a restaurant in town that serves these and I was really looking forward to making them myself. I followed the directions to a T and though the flavor was nice, they had a soggy limp consistency which took away much of  the appeal to this dish. I plan to try it once more in case I slipped up somewhere without realizing it but if the results are the same, I won't repeat this one again.

Made these and they came out fantastic. Changed only a couple things. One, I added the cheese to the liquid mix. Second, I used my Air Fryer to cook them to crispy  perfection.

Actually, I have not made it, but I plan to.   I have 1 little comment re not crispy enough.   Check the temp on your range.   It may not be really 450.   When I make roasted C (which I do all the time), my C is crispy.   I make it with Italian dressing.  They eat it all..pps.   The heads of C we've been getting lately are the size of soccer balls!

My didn't get crispy at all.   Perhaps I needed to cook it longer.

This recipe is delicious!  Thank you for sharing it.  I made it vegan by leaving out  the parm cheese, using vegan mayo, and flour paste in place of the egg.  Still so good, everyone loved them.
