This makes such an adorable cake, and you can use any flavors you like for the cake & pool.  I used a white cake and made a 2 layer rectangular cake.  I placed the first layer on my platter, then placed the second cake layer on top of that.  I then cut the rectangle for the 'water' out of only the top layer and filled it with the chilled blue Jell-O.  This recipe is great for Summer birthday parties!

Living in south Louisiana, we thought it would be appropriate to make it a beach and add chocolate chips to the graham craker/brown sugar "sand" and call it 'Life's a beach and Then You Get Tarballs Cake". (See photo submitted today)  The cake / jello combination was surprisingly delicious!  We did add cream cheese to the whipped topping and some vanilla.  Will definetly make again...need to use up all the 'decorations' anyway!

I had so much fun making this cake! I decided to make this an 'ocean cake' instead of a pool cake.   I did the quick set with the jell-o and it worked great.  I also used crushed graham crackers over  brown colored "Special Buttercream Frosting" from this site to make it look like sand.  I used tie-dyed fruit roll-ups as beach towels, cream wafer cookies as surf boards, drink umbrellas for beach umbrellas, teddy grahams as 'people', lifesaver and peach gummies for floaties, and I put gummy fish and octopus in the 'water' before it set!  I also used some of the cake that I cut out for the water area to make sand dunes!  The kids and adults alike thought this was the coolest cake!

Made this for my daughter about 5 years ago for her birthday pool party.  She requested it again this year for her birthday.
