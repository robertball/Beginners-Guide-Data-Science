Delicious and sooooo refreshing! I did omit the arugula as we do not care for it and had to use some dried mint in place of the fresh. I can't wait to try this in the summer when everything is at the peak of freshness. Loved the flavor/texture combo...a definite keeper~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I left out the arugula (local store was out) and added extra lemon juice. Served it twice and both times it was a hit!

Very good! I thought the onion was a tad strong, will use less next time.

Was really skeptical about the combinations of flavors, but was VERY PLEASANTLY surprised! Really enjoyed this dish, a lot! Didn't use the arugula, but felt like the dish was perfect.

Excellent summer salad. Easy, refreshing & dressing balances a perfect savory sweet. Omitted onions only because trying to duplicate a salad we loved from our favorite Greek restaurant. I will try with onions next time.
