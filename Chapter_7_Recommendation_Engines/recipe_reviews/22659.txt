This was so good!! I used a 2 lb. bag of baby carrots and steamed them for 45 minutes, so they were very easy to mash with a potato masher. I think getting carrots that are already cleaned and peeled was important for this recipe because that way you know you will have the 2 lbs the recipe called for. That might be why some others had that "eggy" taste - mine didn't at all. I used 3/4 cup sugar and that was the perfect amount for me. (I like it sweet!) I also added cinnamon and nutmeg and baked it for an hour based on other reviews. I will be making this all the time now because my two and a half year old daughter who wont even think about eating carrots loved this dish!!

This was good, and almost didn't taste like carrots! I cut the sugar to a 1/2 cup,and added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg.As a past reviewer mentioned grating the carrots before boiling,I decided to try that,and it was very easy to mash the carrots that way.I also followed another reviewers advice to bake for an hour to let it carmelize,that made it good, and it didn't burn!

I love this recipe. I use two cans of sliced carrots instead cooking fresh carrots. I just drain them and mash them with a potato masher. It is a very quick and easy dish.

This souffle tastes EXACTLY like the one made by Piccadilly Cafeteria! DEEEELICIOUS!

There are a two caveats, though:
1. If you don’t have a food processor that will chop the carrots VERY fine, it’s not worth making this recipe – it will taste like…boiled carrots. I thought I could “chop” up the boiled carrots with my hand mixer, but it didn’t work too well. The large chunks of carrots didn’t taste good at all. It also didn’t look very appetizing.
2. If you are halving or otherwise modifying the amounts in the recipe, ROUND DOWN on the eggs. I rounded up, and it made the soufflé very eggy-tasting and too moist.
Otherwise, GREAT recipe!

I made this and had just a few tips.  Definitely use a Cuisinart to blend the carrots after they're cooked.  I tried to use my ricer and the carrots broke it!!  And I cook it at least an hour to get the carmelizaiton that I love so much.  Also, DO NOT substitute margarine for butter.

This recipe became a family favorite overnight!! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used only half a cup of sugar instead of a full cup. I was the only one at the table that thought it was still a bit too sweet. The sugar and eggs masked the taste of the carrots almost completely, in my opinion, so I may use less of those in future attempts. I boiled the carrots for about 30 minutes instead of 15 - they were very easy to mash. All in all, this one's a keeper!

I love this recipe.  I have made it several times.  I use 2 eggs, brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice.  This is a hit wherever I bring it.

Overall great recipe. My boyfriend always gets this at Piccadilly Cafeteria and he was excited when I told him I was going to make it. I read the reviews and cut sugar to 3/4 cup and butter to 1/4 cup. He liked it and said it was sweet enough but felt it needed butter. I will definitely make it again but I will use the full 1/2 cup butter, a bit more baking powder since mine didn't rise very much, and cook the carrots a bit longer (I did 1 hr this time) to see if they'll get creamier. Side note: my sister came to visit and LOVED the leftovers!

This was much too sweet, but not too bad.  If I made it again, I would cut the sugar in half (as other ratings suggest), and add spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.).

Definitely a 5 star!!!
Took this to a BBQ and it was a huge hit.
I read through almost all the reviews before I made it and changed these thing per popular opinion by other reviewers:
used 1/4 cup white sugar + 1/4 cup brown sugar
no powdered sugar
1/4 tsp. cinnamon + 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
pinch of salt
baked for 45 minutes.

SO good!!! And a great way to use up lots of extra carrots!

Note: 2 pounds of carrots is equal to approximately 12-16 medium carrots OR 7 cups of peeled and diced carrots

This one is a keeper in our house. I thought it was a little too sweet as is, but DH loved it. Couldn't get the kids to try it, they were in a no-weird new food mood and couldn't be convinced to try even though they love carrots any other time. Go figure. Baking time seemed a bit short in the dish I used, will try something wider and shallower next time.

I decided to give this recipe 4 stars, but it probably deserved only 3 as-is. My end result was 5 stars, but as written this recipe just wouldn't be right. 30 minutes in the oven will get you mush that won't even hold its shape. It is quite frustrating to think you need 50 minutes to make something but it turns out to be closer to two hours. I make my own baby food, which that knowledge was a big plus in "pureeing" the carrots. I steamed 2 lbs of baby carrots for about 40 minutes. I then transferred them to my food processor and added all the "liquids" (melted butter, eggs, vanilla) first. Once the carrots were basically pureed, then I added the rest of the ingredients. I also added about a 3/4 tsp of cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 white sugar instead of a full cup of sugar (1 cup of sugar is TOO MUCH!). Once it was finally done (about an hour later), it was quite yummy!

If one separates the egg whites and yolks ...beat the whites and slightly beat the yolks before mixing in...makes the product more fluffy....try it....

This receipe can be made diet friendly by substituting the sugar with 1/4 Cup Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking, and the stick of butter with 1/2 cup of apple sauce.  It works great, and saves a lot of calories.

This is a great recipe.  I make it pretty often since my husband is picky about what kinds of veggies he'll eat, but he loves carrots.  Instead of boiling my own carrots, I use 2 cans of canned carrots.  I also use less butter and sugar, around 2 tablespoons of butter and maybe 1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar, and only 1 egg.  This is the kind of recipe that I don't really measure anything, I just mix everything up and pop it in the oven and it always turns out great.

I made this dish for Christmas dinner, and it was enjoyed by my family.  It was light and fluffy and melted in your mouth.  Next time, I think I will add a little cinnamon, though.  I used Splenda instead of sugar, and no one knew except me!  Will make often!

We thought this was good. I halved the recipe since my husband and I were the only ones eating. I did use 2 eggs in it. Didn't feel it was too eggy. Most suffles do have a lot of eggs in them, that is what helps to make them fluffy. I would cook carrots longer next time, I could not mash with fork even after cooking 20 min. and they were fork tender. I ended up beating in my mixer. I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon also. I had used 1/2 tsp. pure vanilla and thought it was a bit strong, I will cut that back next time. I did think it was a bit dry, I will add a little milk or cream when I make it again. Baked in a 8x8 dish. I will butter the dish too, it did stick a little. The 2 of us ate almost the whole dish! Thanks Tammy!

Really enjoyed this recipe and so did my guests!  Followed suggestions and cut the butter to 1/4 cup, sugar to 1/2 cup, and used 1/2 cup egg substitute for eggs.  Some reviewers mentioned it was difficult to mash the carrots.  I would suggest cooking them longer than the recipes says.  Then, I put the carrots, eggs, and butter into the food processor.  It got nice and creamy.  Interesting alternative to traditional side dishes.  I just can't say I'd count this as a vegetable!  :)

This was awesome!  I made it for Christmas dinner as a side.  I made it exactly as directed.  I found that the vanilla was a little strong for our liking so I will cut back on that next time.  Will also try 3/4 cup sugar to see if it makes that big of a difference.  Why not use less sugar if you can?  Thanks for the recipe.  I finally have a way to choke down carrots :)

This recipe rates highest in my book anytime my children eat without a word.They will taste it but after that, anything goes.....this time it went, all of it.  First time I made it exact to the recipe. I didn't find it too sweet at all. I have a sweet tooth. 2nd time, I used fresh whole carrots (3lbs), 1 cup brown sugar instead which added a richer taste.  I also used the suggestions of cinnamon and nutmeg and also the juice from 1/2 lemon.  It was great!  This was so easy to make. Now I will show my daughter so she can make it for me!

I tried this recipe with 1/2 cup of sugar as other reviewers suggested. It was good but still too sweet for my family. Will try again with 1/4 cup next time and a little less butter, too.

I love this recipe. We have had it for the past few years for Thanksgiving instead of sweet potato casserole/candied yams. I always add a little ground cinnamon. This year, I ran out of room in the oven, so I made it in the crock pot (2 hours/High). It worked out perfectly!

This smelled so good while it was baking.  Everyone was excited to try it, but no one liked it.  I can't explain why, but it had an almost artificial flavor to it.  I hate to give any recipe such a low rating, but this was just not to our liking and we usually love carrots.

I made this recipe to have as dessert and can't stop eating it! Sooo good. I used my food processor to slice the carrots and then cooked them in the microwave with a little water. I just kept testing them every 3 min or so till they were very tender. Then put them back in the processor with the melted butter and sugar, till the mixture was very smooth. I added 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice and used 1/2c brown sugar and almost 1/2c white, which does not make it too sweet for a dessert. Frankly I didn't think it was too sweet even for a side dish. I also baked it for 1 hour.

Excellent w/ the following changes:  reduce sugar by half, add cinnamon, salt and ginger and sprikle w/ a bit of brown sugar prior to baking.  I actually went and reduced my other reviews ratings, to make a '5*' really mean something when I review this recipe.  This will be on our Thanksgiving table for sure.

I enjoyed this recipe. I love the carrot souffle at Picadilly Cafeteria, now I can prepare it at home. This is a great recipe. Thanks!

I used half white sugar, half brown sugar and baked it in foil muffin cups. Turned out better than previous attempts.

Great dish! This turned out exactly as I had hoped -- both flavor and texture wise. I followed the recipe as written, and it came out of the oven virtually perfect. I cooked it the day before Thanksgiving and warmed it up from refrigerated the next day.

I just had this at a Christmas party, and loved it even though I'm not a fan of cooked carrots.  I got the recipe and the only difference was that this recipe uses twice the carrots, but I would think that would just make it actually taste like carrots!  Definitely adding this one to my list of holiday side dishes.

A++++++++ THIS IS ALMOST TOO GOOD FOR A MEAL, WOULD BE WONDERFUL ALONE. Great as a side to ham.This dish is very easy to make and quite delicious.  It goes very well with so many things!  It's even better leftover!  Would be a great dish for a buffet, brunch, lunch, dinner or family gathering!  I do blend the carrots because I like it to have a smooth consistency rather than chunky.

My family RAVED about this dish!  It was a wonderful addition to our Thanksgiving dinner.  The only thing I noticed is that the baking time was a little off.  I wanted it to "set" a bit more than it did.  I also added a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger.  It will be a tradition!

Easter seemed like the perfect time to add a new carrot recipe to our family gathering & so I introduced this one to our crew.  At first my picky eaters were cautious, but before the meal was over they were argueing over who got to take home the leftover carrot casserole!  It was awesome & is now on a card in my recipe box - the true proof of a successful & accepted recipe in our home!  Thanks for the new tradition.

ok, mashing the carrots was a pain in the behind.  the end result was worth the effort, though.  i didn't get to taste the finished product, i sent it to a potluck with my non-cooking mother-in-law.  she was inundated with requests for the recipe and she brought home a dish that was completely empty.  i have even received emails from people that were at that party for this recipe.  i was impressed by the reception of this dish and glad i chose it to send with her.

Version one/as is: too eggy, too sweet, too much vanilla.
Version two: cut 3 eggs to 2, cut sugar and vanilla in half. Egg and sugar content were good, daughter and hubby said/I agree the vanilla still overpowers the carrot flavor though it was better.....vanilla needs to be cut in half again.

I made this for Easter and even my picky eaters loved it!  I did take some suggestions from others and used only 2 eggs, 3/4 cup sugar and added a dash of cinnamon.  I also cooked the carrots for 30min.

This recipe is great and it was a big hit at my dinner party.  However, if I make it again I would add only 2 eggs and would add some cinnamon and fresh nutmeg.  I've noticed that several other reviews mentioned using less eggs and adding a little more spice, too.

This is a delicious side dish!  I made it for Christmas and it was requested again for New Years.  The only problem is that I had to chop the carrots by hand and it took forever (obviously Tammy has a food processor).

I made this for Christmas dinner for a change from the regular cooked carrots that we have and everyone raved about it.  I didn't care for it much - it was too eggy for my taste - turned out a bit custardy.  Maybe next time I'll leave out an egg.  But - I'm the only one in our large family that had a complaint.  This is my family's new favorite.

This recipe was wonderful! I made it for a dinner party & everyone loved it. I took the advice of others and used 1/4 c. butter, but I added 3/4 c. sugar. I think the amounts of each can be adjusted to suit personal preferences.

I've never had the cafeteria version of this but my family really liked it.  I did use less sugar per other reviewers and was glad.  My 6 year old asked me to make it again so I'm counting that as success.  I did have to boil my carrots for much longer than the recipes states.  Wasn't clear if they should be very mashed or if there would be chunks of carrot.  Either way I'm sure it would be good.

I have had carrot souffle several times at my local Picadilly Cafeteria and absolutely love it! I decided to make it for Thanksgiving and found this to be a very easy and delicious recipe. The only thing I did different was I used Cinnamon sugar instead of Confectioner's sugar. This recipe was a huge hit with my family and now i will be making it for the office Christmas party. It's so easy, I will be making this dish on a regular basis!  I give this receipe an AAA+++

5 Stars the way I made it, but would only be a 4 as listed. I used others suggestions of using brown sugar & a lot less of it. Also added cinnamon & a dash of nutmeg. Again, w/these changes it is a 5. This reminds me of a sweet potato pie w/o the crust.

12/17/2017 update:  we tried this recipe with my changes using sweet potatoes that are microwaved first.  This was fantastic & not sure which way I like better.  We love sweet potatoes so will be doing this for Christmas this year & probably during the cold winter months.   During the summer months we can use the carrots when they are fresher & sweeter from the garden.

This was fantastic! I used a potato masher to mash the carrots, and although it wasn't completely smooth, the small chunks were soft and we didn't mind.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and only used 2 eggs.  Also baked for 45 minutes.  Might add pecans next time. Thanks for a winner of a recipe!

This is the YUMMIEST carrot recipe EVER! The trick is to use a food processor and puree the carrots. I use 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar the rest is the same. I have catered this dish at rehearsal dinners and its always on our holiday table! A family favorite! My husband calls it carrot candy! HA! Men!!! ;-)

This is just like the "cafeteria" carrot souffle that I love. I have made this many many times and everyone begs for more. The bake time always seems to short when I make it though, so I recommend cooking it longer.

I made this for the second time yesterday for Easter at the request of my daughter who is home on leave from the Marine Corps. It is so good.  It's more like a desert than a vegetable dish.

This recipe was fabulous. The yams are out carrots are in! 
I followed the recipe, but used 6 eggs and used 3/4c dark brown sugar. I also topped it with brown sugar,crushed cornflakes & butter. Delicious.

Perfect!  Just like Picadilly.  I used half brown/half white sugar.  It was so good.  It tasted like a pudding when eaten cold the next day, and it was the first side dish that disappeared on Thanksgiving.  Definitely will make this again.

This was a great way to use up some extra carrots. It made a nice change of pace side dish. It DEFINITELY has the texture of something from the cafeteria! Instead of mashing, I just added everything to my stand mixer and beat. I used honey instead of sugar & omitted the powder sugar toppingn. My husband thought it tasted like a sweet potato casserole but my 16mo daughter did not care for it, at least not this time around. A keeper none the less!

I absolutely loved this! It turned out exactly like the Carrot Souffle @ Piccadilly's.  The only change that I made was using 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar.  Thanks!

My 2 children, age 9 and 6, LOVED it. We made one adjustment. They like carrots from a can, so we used those. We used 5 standard size cans from the grocery store. They even enjoyed helping. We plan on taking this to the church lunch next week. Even their 90 year old grandfather LOVED them.

It was good- seems similar to sweet potato casserole.  My husband, who doesn't normally like cooked carrots, liked this dish.  I used half white sugar and half brown sugar.

I think this is an awesome recipe...my brother-in-law detests carrots but he had seconds and thirds of this.  I have omitted the sugar on top and the vanilla but added about 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon.  It's delicious...a great "company" recipe.

Wonderful!  I've made this dish before and I thought it was too sweet so I took the advise of others and cut down on the sugar.  I cut the sugar in half and did not use the vanilla but added about a tablespoon of dark brown sugar and a tablespoon of cinnamon and it was great.  I used a food processor this time and it made it really smooth I would like a little more texture but the taste is outstanding.

This is fantastic!!!  So good I wanted to eat the whole thing but had to share with my husband.  Tastes like dessert.  I did cut back on sugar and halved the recipe for the two of us. Used two beaten eggs.  Can't wait to make it for Christmas dinner my family and friends will be impressed.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Absolutely delicious. I first had carrot souffle a few years ago in Furr's Cafeteria (only in the South) and it was awesome. Even my 4 year old likes this with a little cool whip on top.  I buy the huge packages of carrots at Costco just for this recipe. Thanks for posting. YUM!!

This was pretty good.  No fireworks but tasty, filling and versatile.  I didn't use nearly as much sugar as the recipe called for because I didn't want it to be a dessert.  So, I only added about a tablespoon of brown sugar.  Easy to follow, not time-consuming, baked very evenly.

I was a apprehensive about trying this recipe at first since I don't care for cooked carrots. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it tasted more like a sweet potato pie than carrots! I also found that if you grate the carrots before cooking it makes mashing much easier! I can't wait to share the recipe!

OMG this was good!  I halved the recipe which was plenty for four of us.  I did also half again the sugar and it still was a little too sweet. I cooked the carrots until tender and then threw everything into the food processor. Will be making this again for sure

Used 1/2 or 1/3 brown sugar.
My mistake was making it a day in advance, so it was completely flat when I served. Guests raved anyway, and asked for the recipe.

Very good recipe! I made this for diner and loved it! Both of my children really liked it, my husband however was not too fond. He said it would have been better if it had been sweeter. That may have been my fault because I changed the sugar amounts in the recipe. I used 1/4c brown sugar and 1/4c of white sugar. I also added a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg and omitted the confectioner's sugar sprinkled on top. I used 2 eggs instead of 3. Will definitely make this again!

Normally, I don't care for carrots.  However, I thought I'd try one more time to find an acceptable way to include them in my diet.  This recipe rocks!  My husband and I just gobbled it up.  I have dietary restrictions, so I used 1/4 cup light margarine instead of 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup Splenda.  I also added 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice (just 'cause I like the taste of it).  Thank you for making carrots delicious!

I really liked this. I used a food processor and made the carrots very creamy because mashing wasn't working for me. I used 3/4 Cup of sugar like some suggested. I don't know if another 1/4 Cup would have made that much difference, though. I added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg, as well.

This was SO good. I only gave the recipe 4 stars because I, like other reviewers, added cinnamon and nutmeg and felt like it would have been somewhat bland without these additions. I also cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, but I don't think it would have been too sweet with the whole cup (but I love sweet things). I will definitely make this again.

This was amazing!!  My three boys -ages 4, 5 and 7 couldn't stop eating it and asked if I could make it again.  They called it pumpkin pie carrots.  I made a few changes - used about 2/3 cup brown sugar instead of white, added cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is an excellent recipe.  I recommend that the carrots be put into a blender or food processor unless you like chunks of carrot.  Even add a bit of cinnamon or allspice if you like a little spice.

This was alright. I cut the sugar, cut the carrots smaller & cooked them longer, but...Well, I guess I should have payed more attention to the title. If you've had the original "Souffle" then you'll notice that this is indeed like something you'd find in a cafeteria! It's not smooth & doesn't quite remind me of a souffle.

I made this 12 servings and cooked in a 3 quart Pyrex at 350 for 1hr 15min and it was AMAZING!  The entire family loved it, even the kids!  I didn't add any confectioners sugar to the top, it was really sweet to begin with!

Way too sweet for my taste (I don't like any "sweet" vegetable dish).  HOWEVER, my husband (who refuses to eat cooked carrots) loved it; he thought it was pumpkin!  In the future I'll add a touch of cinammon and reduce the sugar...

Fiance said 5 stars, but I'm giving it 4 as I'm a non-carrot lover and it didn't really win me over.  I used 3/4 a cup of brown sugar instead of white and added cinnamon.  Next time I'll add the full cup of sugar and probably split between white and brown.  I also took the advice of cooking it for an hour and it came out nicely.  This would be a good Thanksgiving side dish.

Very very good!  I omit the eggs, and add a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, & cloves.  Also good cold mixed with vanilla ice cream.

I may be the only person here who never had this at a careteria, but I'm making up for by cooking it myself thanks to this recipe. I cut down a tad on the sugar since I don't care for it being quite that sweet, but otherwise, I follow the recipe to the letter and it's never failed to satisfy. Excellent taste and texture.

This is so simple to make. I used 3/4 cup of Splenda-blend sugar instead of the "real" stuff (just make sure you read the conversion on the back of the Splenda bag because it's not cup for cup equal). I reduced the amount of sweetner, like others suggested, and I doubled everything else for Christmas. We didn't have any leftovers after the weekend. Everyone seemed to love it.

I halved the recipe and it was great.  I might cut the sugar (it was very sweet) and add cinnamon & nutmeg next time.  I will also try grating to make mashing easier.

As is, this is too sweet so I only gave it 4 stars.  I am the only one in the family that eats carrots so now I make it with one pound of carrots, one egg, a little bit of Splenda brown sugar instead of the white sugar, and I add cinnamon and nutmeg.  It has become my favorite side!

I had alot of carrots to use up so I wanted to try this recipe.
It was good-next time I would cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. Alittle to sweet for me.
Otherwise it's a make again.

Very yummy.  I have made this twice now and will definitely say that using a blender after boiling the carrots is essential.  No matter how much I tried with my fork and potato masher, I could not get break up all of the lumps or grainy parts of the blender-free batch.  It was also necessary to cook the carrots longer than written, but then again, everyone's stove is different.  Thanks, though, for the recipe!  It surely does taste almost exactly like the cafeteria delicacy :)

Ok this is what I used and I would like to say this was very good 2 pounds carrots, chopped and boiled for about 35min.then I added everything to my  mixer and beat
1/2 cup melted butter 
1/2 cup white sugar 1/4 cup of brown sugar and about 1 teaspoon of  cinnamon 
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
1 teaspoon baking powder 
2 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon almound extract
3 eggs and I made my own pie crust and we loved it. So I guess you can say I made a carrot souffle pie to die for this was just that good. Thanks a lot I will make this again,again

This has the potential of being good.  Definitely too sweet, so be sure to use 1/2 the sugar, at least.  Consistency is like whipped baby food, and would be pretty good if you like that kind of thing.  I probably will not make it again.

This recipe is awesome, but instead of using carrots, try baking some sweet potatoes and mashing them up, while still going with the 1/2 and 1/2 on the sugars!  This makes an awesome and healthy souffle!!!!

Great! I scaled it to 2 servings with no problems, baked it in a small loaf pan. Omitted 10X sugar and used apple pie spice instead & used brown sugar instead of white. A keeper.

My family, who all strongly dislike cooked carrots, took to this souffle like fish to water.  I cut the sugar in half (using part brown & part white), and sprinkled the top with pumpkin pie spice.  What a treat!

This stuff is wonderful!! After I cooked the carrots I put them in my food processor, then just added all ingredients while I pureed - I didn't even have to melt the butter, just dropped cubes into processor and the hot carrots melted it. Came out smooth and amazing. My husband suggested next time adding a walnut crumb topping, kind of like sweet potato casserole.

I have mixed feelings about this.  It is not really a souffle (which is obvious from the recipe anyway), and it does not taste like carrots.  It tastes like sugar.  That said, I think if I used half or less of the sugar, it would be a nice mushy vegetable dish for picky eaters.

This is just like a well known cafeteria's carrot souffle!  I was amazed, and so was my family!  This is one of our favorite dishes.  One thing I did a little different is I sprinkled it with powdered sugar before AND after baking.  When you bake it, the powdered sugar disappears into the souffle, so you need to dust it with powdered sugar again.

Really great!  Followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the sugar in half and added pumpkin pie spice.  I also cooked the carrots longer than the receipe stated (30 minutes) and then put in my Ninja to produce a smooth consistency.  I baked for 50 minutes.  This will be a regular dish for company from here on out!

Wonderful! I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, added cinnamon and nutmeg, and baked for 1 hour. Everybody loved it! I'm looking forward to making it again! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I halved the recipe and thought it was very good, but I am glad that I read the other reviews because half the sugar (or less) makes it much much better.  I don't care for yams or sweet potatoes, but would serve this with anything those would go with.

I used the pre-cut baby carrot size bag and it saved so much time.  I think next time I will use the food processor to make the carrots finer.  The carrots were a little chunky using a masher.  Regardless, it was yummy and very easy.

Not only am I new to cooking carrot souffle, I'm new to eating it too. I'd never eaten it before I made this recipe, so I had no preconceived notions of what it should taste like. It’s great! I don’t think there’s any way to mess up this one. I’ve made it twice now, differently, and it’s still good.   I used the calculator to make a single serving in a small ramekin. I made a couple modifications for cholesterol purposes & for speed… un-melted “I can’t believe it’s not butter” instead of melted butter, “egg beaters” instead of eggs, and a bag of pre-shredded carrots. Since I didn’t boil, mash, or blend the carrots, they probably took up more room than usual in the ramekin (one time I poured in a little more egg, the other time I didn’t). One time I used baking powder & I the other time I didn’t. One time I cut the sugar in half & the other time I didn’t. I didn’t have confectioners’ sugar either time, so I sprinkled with brown sugar. I’ve already recommended this recipe to others, and I’ll definitely be making it again in the future.

Yum!  My children had seconds!  I also halved the sugar and used a mix of brown/white sugar.  It was plenty sweet!  Also added 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  30 minutes was a perfect cook time for half the recipe, so I agree with other reviewers that the full recipe may need up to an hour.  Will definitely make again since each of my kids probably ate a whole carrot and not too much sugar since I reduced it!

We loved this! I did only use 1/2 cup of sugar and added a 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. Used my food processor for the cooked carrots and then to mix it all together. Baked it for an hour instead of 30 minutes. I have made it twice in the past 3 days. Once for us and yesterday for company with the garlic cheese chicken rollups and from this site. Carrots never tasted so good. Delicious!

Not a big hit in my family. It was ok. I think it needs some kind of a crunchy topping. I might play around with it a little bit.

I LOVE Piccadilly carrot souffle, and this recipe definitely satisfied my craving! I made a few changes based on other reviews: I sliced baby carrots and boiled for about one hour, then put them in the food processor to puree. I also used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup splenda, and I replaced half of the butter with applesauce. I also added nutmeg and cinnamon to the mix. Baked for about 45 minutes--great!

My husband, my in-laws and I all thought this was great.  I halved the sugar per other reviewers.  I will eliminate the vanilla and try cinnamon next time.  My kids ate it, but were a little freaked out by the psychedelic orange color - LOL.  I boiled the carrots until they were very soft and then pureed with a hand blender.

This is WONDERFUL!  One of my dad's favorite things is carrot souffle so I made this for dad's day and he loved it!  The only thing that I changed was to boil the carrots with a little bit of sugar, vanilla and cinnamon in the water, just adds a little sweet taste.

This is my new favorite recipe; I could even eat it for dessert.  My two young boys gobbled it up as well.  I wouldn't tell them what it was until they finished, since it is hard to get them to eat vegetables.  The only thing I did differently was substitute brown sugar for the white.

This is SO, SO, SO good... and a great way to get carrots into my toddler (although she'll eat them right out of the can). 

This tastes just like the carrot souffle from Picadilly Cafeteria which is always my dessert (when I get the chance).

Regardless, it's FABULOUS and a great all-year-round dish.

very tasty!  make sure the carrots are very, very done or you'll be unable to get a smooth puree.  it's much easier if you use a stick blender.  i also added a little pumpkin pie spice.

I made this in the morning to be a side dish for dinner and it was gone before dinner arrived.  I steamed the carrots for something like 45 minutes and then just used my Kitchen Aid with the regular mixer attachment to mash them (no food processor here).  I aso was out of cinnamon and so I added 1/2 t. of Pumpkin Pie Spice.  Ooo, and I only used 2 eggs, which was perfect.  It did cook up a bit on the "thin" side, using a 9x13 pan and I would say it only makes about 6 servings.  I think I'll double the recipe next time.  Not only did I love it, my one year old did too.

Really good!  My husband actually made this and he left the carrot pieces a little too large, but other than that it was prefect!  I ate it with every other meal until it was all gone.

We LOVED this!  Kids (who are reluctant to eat veggies) ate this all up.  Will definately make it again.  Used 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar -- made everything with the food processor.  Easy and delicious!  Thanks Tammy!

What a great side dish!  We really enjoyed this recipe.  I did cut the sugar in half, but that was the only alteration.  I will be making this for Easter and every other chance I get!!  Thanks!

This is a good kids recipe because it's so sweet BUT it's a little too sweet.  I'd at least double the carrots and keep the rest the same or less.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and we all loved it.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar, because we're watching our sugar intake, and it came out great.  

Thanks for a new and different way to fix carrots!

Wow, this was wonderful!! I made it this morning for an All Vegetarian party at my house and this was gone in less time than it took to actually make the dish! The only problem I had was- I found it hard to mash the carrots so I put them in the blender with the melted butter and about 1/2 cup of milk.... and I sprayed the casserole dish with butter flavored nonstick spray.  Excellent dish!

We thought this was pretty good but was missing something. I added some brown sugar to the left overs the next day and it was perfect. I also tried making a topping for it the next time I made it. I used the topping from Butternut Squash Casserole. I would give it a five star with brown sugar or the topping. Thanks for sharing!(I also use low fat butter and egg whits only and it cooks up just fine!)

I made this for Easter and everyone loved it. I do think the next time I make it I will only add two eggs. It was a little too eggy for my liking but everyone else did not seem to mind it. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This had a unique flavor.  It was good but I don't think I was too fond of the egginess of it.  I might try again just mashing the carrots, adding all the ingredients except the eggs and flour, and serving that way.

I had friends over for dinner and they couldn't believe how good this was! It tastes like a desert rather than a vegetable. I made this with the candied chicken breasts (also from this site) and it was a great combination! VERY YUMMY!!!

Never had Carrot Souffle before so I didn't know what to expect but I have had corn souffle so I decided to try it out.  It was a HUGE hit at the party we had and almost everyone had seconds which is pretty remarkable for my picky family.  Everyone asked for the recipe so not only will we make it again but our extended family plan on sharing it!

This is a good dish for a Thanksgiving or Christmas table.  Tastes alot like sweet potatoes to me.  A little too sweet for a regular side dish and the kids think it looks like baby food but I liked it alot.

This recipe is an okay recipe. You still have to like carrots. I read the reviews and used a scant 3/4 cup of sugar. Prep. time was rather long. I'll probably make it again, though. Two people at the party asked for the recipe.

This is the best way to eat carrots.  I am not one who likes this vegetable as a rule, but I would eat them glazed as my mother would make them. I tried this recipe and was sold on having them this way every time.  They were very easy to prepare and took very little time to bake. OUTSTANDING taste.  Have made them several times just for my husband and myself.  PLAN TO HAVE THEM ON THANKSGIVING.   Know they will be a hit.  Thanks for a wonderful way to serve carrots.

tastes more like carrots than the real thing at picadilly. I think they add more sugar or a secret ingredient. You would never know that there's is made from carrots

I was really excited to see this recipe, but when I made it, I was disappointed.  For the first time ever, my kids told me a vegatable was too sweet.  I think if I make it again I will use half the sugar.

I am originally from a small community in Newfoundland called Piccadilly so the title of the recipe caught my eye.  I made it as a sidedish with my Easter dinner and it was a hit.  I sent the recipe to my mother immediately.  I'll definately make it again and again.

I had gone to Piccadilly Cafeteria while on vacation, and loved the Carrot Souffle. I was thrilled to find this recipe. It was so easy, and tasted exactly like Piccadilly's. Thank you so much!

We're vegan and count calories so we replaced the eggs with flax, the butter with applesauce, and the sugar with Stevia. We also cut out the flour and instead upped the baking powder to two tablespoons. 1/4 cup Stevia + 1 tbsp cornstarch in the blender made a fine calorie-free sweetener for dusting the top. Delish!

Exactly like the Picadilly's recipe.  Sweet and satisfying....a great alternative for those like me who don't like sweet potatoes.  This is a great recipe for special meals and everyone always compliments this one.

I made this for an anniversary dinner I catered and it was  a BIG hit! Everyone raved about it.  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and also because I didn't have any regular butter I used I can't believe it's not butter and it still came out wonderfully!!!

I, too, thought this was best as a dessert. I cut the sugar by half and it was awfully sweet. I put it in a 9x13 pan as others suggested. Flavor was good, but reminded me of the sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving.

I was so glad that I found this recipe for Carrot Souffle.  I made it tonight and after I cooked the carrots I noticed that I did not have any sugar, white or brown.  So I used 1 cup of honey and it was perfect.  For those of you that thought it was to sweet use honey instead of sugar.  It was so good I don't think I will use sugar the next time.

A+.  We make this whenever we have too many carrots now- delicious!  I have gotten by with cutting out a little butter and it's still good.

This recipe is soooooo good! It's definitely a 5 star!! I didn't have two pounds of carrots, so the mixture looked a bit runny at first. Then, I gradually added more flour until the mixture looked right. It turned out awesome!! If I'm not worried about my skin turning yellow, I'd eat this every day!! haha. This carrot souffle is definitely going to be on our menus for Thanksgiving and Christmas!

I wish this were actually healthy.  I started reading the ingredients list, and once I passed the carrots, got turned off.  The 1/2 cup of melted butter, white sugar, and confectioners' sugar definitely had something to do with it!

I added cinnamon and nutmeg.

I chopped the carrots up small and boiled them until soft, then drained waand used a hand-held electric mixer to beat the carrots to a pulp.

The dish tasted great, but I had to bake it for an hour, and it was still very squishy.  I'm not sure if it was supposed to be.

I may add a bit more flour to it if I make it again.

Not my favorite but a good way to use up left over carrots. Mine was a little lumpy. Probably ought to have put it through the food processor.

I thought this was good. I cut the recipe in half and I used a bag of frozen carrots, boiled till soft, pureed them in the blender. 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. I also crushed up some ritz crackers for the top. I would make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was ok, but even after cutting the sugar in half it was too sweet.  And I couldn't get my toddler to eat it, which was really the point. :(

I love love loved this. I don't really know what ot call it though...I wouldn't eat it as a side..perhaps it's more appropriate as a dessert? I haven't taken a stab at trying to make it savoury, but I do add cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg and it's delicious. Never lasts long

Made this recipe over the weekend after having something like it at the Virginia Diner.  Wonderful and a great way to eat carrots!  Had to cook it longer than recipe called for.  My entire family loved it, even my 3 year old grandson.

Really tasty recipe, moist in the middle and firm on top. I made it when I had a kg of carrots that I needed to get rid of at university before I went home - it went down a treat with my room mates! I kept it in for 1hr and added a spoonful of cinnamon, delicious!

Yum -tastes very similar to pumpkin pie!  I had never even heard of carrot souffle before so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I have to admit, I did make a lot of changes but I still wanted to review it since it came out so good!  I boiled the carrots for about 1 hour, used applesauce instead of butter & Splenda instead of sugar.  I added 1 tsp baking soda (although it still deflated during cooling) and used only 2 eggs.  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and a dash of both nutmeg & cloves.  I blended it all up smooth in a vita-mix blender, sprinkled the top with a little brown sugar & chopped pecans & baked it for 1 hour.  I served it very cold with a dollop of light whipped cream. Delicious, healthy "dessert"!  Next I'm going to try making my pumpkin pie this way to cut the calories!  Great find!  Thanks!

YUM!!!! Boiled the carrots for 1 hour as suggested and cooked for 45 minutes for a soft moist dish. Could have let it got to an hour for a nice crispy top. Also halved the sugar and added a pinch of pumpkin spice as per others' suggestions. Looking forward to trying with splenda and eggbeaters for a healthier option.  Doesn't need the confectioner's sugar.

This recipe was super easy and super delicious. I used 2 bags of frozen baby carrots and per the suggestions of others I used 1/4 cup each of brown and white sugar. I actually prepared this the night before so I could just pop it in the oven in time for Sunday dinner. My husband also loved this and I will definatley make it many more times in the near future.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was really good!  I love carrot souffle.  Next time I make this I will try adding the pecans or maybe raisins.

I use 2lb bag of baby carrots and boil them until tender.  Drain the carrots and put in the Ninja blender with the melted butter.  I use coconut sugar instead of sugar and I don't add the flour.  I blend it all up in the ninja and then pour into my prepared pan.  SO DELISH!!!

After reading some of the reviews, I tried the recipe (now twice) using 1/2 the butter and sugar. My 1 yr old loves it along with the rest of my family. I rated 4 stars because I modified the recipe.

This was delicious and easy. I also cut the sugar in half and it was still very sweet. I'll probably cut out more sugar next time. Everyone said it tasted like a sweet potato pie at Thanksgiving.

My family loves this recipe!  Since it's a little sweet, I add a couple more carrots.  Doesn't seem to affect the texture.  I also like to use my food processor to make it really smooth.  Used sweet potatoes once and it turned out good too!

My friends in New Orleans used to order this from Picadilly to bring to Thanksgiving dinner. I've never had it until I tried this recipe. My husband loves this and looks forward to it every fall when I make it for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I add a little more vanilla just because I like to smell it throughout the house as it cooks. We like this more than sweet potato casserole. The leftovers are even better!

My family loves this recipe!!!  I have made it exactly as written and was a little too sweet for us so decreased sugar to 3/4 cup, I have also made it with 2 bags of frozen carrots which really reduced my prep time!  I had to increase my baking time to at least 45 minutes I thought was due to my oven.  Regardless of the small changes this is a terrific side dish and a great way to get my 2 and 3 year olds to eat some vegetables!

I added some pumpkin pie spice and cooked it in an 8x8 glass pan. I had to double the time cooking in such a deep dish. Next time I'll try a shallower pan. This will be great for Thanksgiving or with ham. Thanks!

Loved it!!!  Like some of the other reviewers I used half white and half brown sugars.  It also took about 15 minutes longer to cook which was no big deal it was well worth the wait.  Thanks so much for offering this recipe.

Great recipe - followed exactly and did not change a thing. Had this with Christmas dinner yesterday, but did have to bake it for about 10 minutes more than suggested. Tastes a lot like Piccadilly's. I couldn't find the recipe that I normally use for carrot souffle, so I decided to try this one - then later found my usual recipe and discovered that it was exactly the same as this one- how ironic! :) Super tasty, highly reccomend.

Maybe it's just personal preference, but I really didn't care for this too much (and neither did anyone else).  It was certainly edible, but I just think there are much better ways to serve carrots.  I also had to boil the carrots longer to be able to mash them and by the time they were the right consistency, all nutrients were lost in the water.  Sorry, this just wasn't for us.

Such an interesting dish! The only thing is I would never consider this a side dish to a meal - too sweet. I ate it as a dessert/afternoon sweet and it was perfect as such. If you don't like sweet dishes with your meals, I would eat is this way rather then reducing the sugar.

We were kind of iffy on this recipe.  The taste wasn't bad ~ it was nice and sweet ~ but the texture and appearance weren't that great.  It might have been better if I had used more carrots, but I won't be making it again to find out.

Based on all of the rave reviews, I decided to try this for company.  I followed one of the previous suggestions to reduce the sugar and only used 3/4 cup of sugar.  Still, I found it almost too sweet and if I make this again, I may even reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I thought it was ok (I have to admit I don't really like carrots in general though) and my husband *loved* it!  I do have to admit it's incredibly easy and I loved that aspect. Very nice!

I substituted white for brown sugar and also added a few dashes of nutmeg and cinnamon. Although I prefer to use less butter, it did help with keeping the souffle moist and oiled up the casserole dish to prevent sticking. I will try less butter and/or applesauce next time for a more heart healthy souffle.

Great recipe! Easy and delicious. Some tweaks...like some other reviewers I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. I did not think it was too sweet. Also, I bought two pounds of baby carrots and boiled them for about 1/2 hour - then used a hand mixer to break them down. Easy. Final change- I baked it a LOT longer. 1 hour. I liked having the edges carmelized and the center firm. Will definitely make again.

I first had a side dish like this at Furr's Cafeteria and I was determined to find a recipe.  I made this for dinner and it was great!!  My husband really liked it as well and said I should make it again.  This will be not only a good addition to side dish choices but for holiday meals as well.

It was delicious! I made a couple substitutions because of what I had on hand. I used 2 tablespoons almond meal, 1tbsp gluten free flour. Added a dash of cinnamon, ginger & pumpkin spice. It was delicious! Will be making it again.

was good but a bit plain. I halved the sugar and used brown instead of white. I boiled the carrots for an hour with the skin still on (after being washed with brush) as I love the skin staying on a vegetable if it can. Next time I think I will change the sugar to maple and add some spices.

Never had or heard of carrot souffle but I figured it was a way to sneak veggies to my kids. I will cut some of the sugar next time but otherwise really good.

Have started making this for Thanksgiving ever year. The recipe is good as-is, but a few changes  make it wonderful. The carrots should go through the food processor. I hand mashed mine this year, which is fine, but you don't have as smooth of a  souflee. It's a bit sweet- the sugar can be reduced and adding cinnamon and nutmeg makes it perfect!

I did not know what carrot souffle was until I came across this recipe (looking for ways to use up my enormous crop of carrots). It is a side dish, served warm, the same way sweet potato casserole would be. This recipe is DELICIOUS! I used 6 cups coursly chopped carrots and boiled them about 40 min. I ran them through my food processor to finely chop them before adding them to the bowl. I did not mash them. Based on other reviews, I cut the sugar in half and that was perfect! I also added a little less than half tsp. Cinnamon, a pinch of salt & about 1/8 tsp. Nutmeg...would have been just as good without it, I think, but it sure tasted great with the spices. I baked it for 1 hour as per other reviews and that worked great! Thanks for posting this recipe...I will make it again & again!

Great recipe for carrots! My husband couldn't believe this was made with fresh carrots.... we really enjoyed this. I also added fresh pecans and used brown sugar and not as much as it called for. I also left the carrots a little chunky and not whipped. One of my favorites on Allrecipes!

I followed direction until the confection sugar. I let it cool just a bit, then used a flour sifter to sprinkle sugar on. It's a big hit wherever I take it.

DELICIOUS!  I did boil the carrots for about an hour. After draining the carrots and added all ingredients, including just a half cup of sugar, into my Ninja food processor. This was my first time making, but not the last!!!

I thought this was a good recipe, although a bit too sweet. I served it with grilled whole chicken, and it's a good side. I will try it again, but reduce the sugar in it.  The vanilla was a nice addition. It was not done after 30 minutes and I baked it a few minutes too long but still liked the taste. Even my granddaughter who doesn't like cooked carrots liked it.

i really like this recipe. i added my  own touch to it though, instead of 1 cup of sugar i use 1/2 and 1/2 lite brown sugar. I also 1/2 the vanilla extract and add it to 1/2 almond. the flavor is so good. i boil the carrots until they are mushy, it makes the souffle come out so light and fluffy. thanks tammy for the recipe.

We used a #10 can of sweet potatoes, drained, and doubled the rest of the ingredients to make two pans of sweet potato soufflé for my husband's employees who work the holiday {they can't close ;(  so we feed them a big meal!}
This worked perfectly.

Excellent recipe with the following changes:  1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup melted butter, 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/2 to 1 tsp. cinnamon.  The first time I tried this it was waaaay too sweet, the prior changes made it more healthy and tasty.  I boiled the carrots and then pureed them in my food processor to get them very smooth, no surprise lumps.  Additional note, this took longer than 30 minutes to cook, closer to an hour.

I have been using this recipe for several years now.  My family LOVES it. The hubby looks like a little kid opening presents when I say I'm making this for dinner. Like others I would say to 1/2 the sugar.  I tend to use about 1/2-3/4c of sugar depending how sweet we want it. I would also suggest if you use margarine vs butter to use less. About 1/2 to 3/4 of the amount called for because it turns out almost greasy otherwise.  Only other addition I tend to do that I think adds to it is a dash of cinnamon.  I've had many a kid who HATES carrots absolutely LOVE it and that's making it with the least amount of sugar. I've even added a full TBSP of baking powder vs the TSP before and it turns out so fluffy.

I too reduced the sugar and also used 1/2 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup of homemade applesauce instead of butter due to an allergy to dairy proteins and it was wonderful!!!!

I used 1/2 cup Splenda, a bit less flour and an extra egg - came out delicious!

This one's a winner! I've made it numerous times now.  I too cut the sugar down by using only 3/4 cup, and I added nutmeg and cinnamon to it. You have to make sure the carrots are completely cooked or they will not mash.  Also, it will not cook in 30 minutes in a 2 qt casserole.  It takes close to an hour. This is a good recipe to play around with according to your own taste.  Worth the effort!

My 2-year-old will eat 3 servings of this whenever I make it.  My SIL actually said, "I can't believe this is carrots!"  I cut the sugar in half and double the flour (I use whole wheat flour).  It's awesome.

After reading the reviews, I modified this recipe and it was incredible. I steamed baby carrots until they were mushy, food processed them to make it smoother, cut the sugar down to a little more than in half, and added 1t of pumpkin pie spice. I cooked it for an hour too. Two co-workers asked for the recipe.

Had to do something with my leftover bag of carrots and this turned out delicious.  Used little over half of the sugar called for and was still sweet.  It smelled fantastic while cooking and was delicious.  I can't believe it!  Who'd think something with carrots could taste so good.

A friend made this for a dinner party and she gave me the recipe from this page.  We all went wild over it but there was a handwritten note at the bottom of the page that she used half the sugar.  Thank heavens because even with half its very sweet.

Better than expected!  5 stars.  I used half the amount of sugar and kept the butter the same.  The carrots took FOREVER in the blender, I will shred next time.  I cooked for 1hr and it was not browned, just right.  Next time I'll see if that made a huge difference compared to just cooking for 30 mins.
