I will definitely make this again.  It was very good.  Next time, I would probably mix the raspberries into the gelatin mixture before adding it to the crust.  And my bottom crust got really soggy.  Maybe it's supposed to be that way?  At any rate, no one cared because it was so good.  I made two pies and they were both gone in one day. Do not forget the whipped cream!

I've never made a pie like this before. It turned out great! A previous comment said that the crust was soggy...just cook it longer next time. Cook until it's nice and brown. Mine turned out so good that I'm sure to make it again! I used frozen raspberries.

My family loved this pie!  I just used a premade graham cracker crust to make it extra easy.  Very delicious!

This is a nice, refreshing dessert!  The only thing different that I do is to stir the raspberries into the sugar mixture after cooling it in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes rather than putting raspberries directly on the bottom of the crust.  It tastes wonderful.

I made this pie based on the good reviews, but I was very disappointed.  The pie tasted like dried out gelatin.  I was sorry I wasted my fresh raspberries from my garden.

I wish the gel had more flavor, it was just super sweet and you couldn't taste the raspberry.  Maybe less sugar would help with this.

Excelletnt pie. Added another 1/8 cup of gelatin and water.  Used 3 cups of raspberries.  This enhanced the flavor.   One of the best raspberries pies I've ever had.

A couple of reviews said the pie was too sweet.  I made two pies the same day.  Followed the recipe exactly.  One pie was sweeter than the other so I am blaming it on the tartness of the berries.  One batch of berries must have been sweeter than the other.  Used frozen berries picked from our back yard. Both pies got rave reviews from my children and grandchildren.  I made one pie in a heart shaped cake pan and served it for a Valentine's Day celebration.  Easy.  Everyone wants the recipe!

I cannot figure out what I did wrong but my pie did not set. It still looked beautiful and it was extremely tasty. It wasn't too sweet either which I thought it would be. Maybe that's because my fresh raspberries were so tart. I could still cut a slice and extract it but the filling oozed all over the place, My filling (the liquid part) was about the consistency of sweetened condensed milk.  Not super liquidy but did not set. As far as the cust, mine did not get soggy at all but I made sure to bake it very thoroughly and until very golden brown before I took it out of the oven. Actually, I made 2 pies - one of them I topped with real whipped cream and the other with Cool Whip (family preference). When I ate a piece, it tasted like and kind of looked like a raspberry shortcake.  It definitely was delicious but because it did not set at all, I can only give it 3 stars.  I'm still wondering what the heck I did wrong! I followed the directions!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I actually probably  would have given it 5 stars for the first piece I ate, but the leftovers weren't as good - they got a little gelatinous.  But it was great the first day and it definitely gets 5 stars for being easy!

I get raves every time I make this.  I prefer to fold the berries into the gelatin mixture before pouring it into the pie crust, and a 9 inch, premade graham cracker crust works great too.  Also, I reduce the white sugar to Â¾ cup to let the tartness of the raspberries come through.  This is a simple, elegant, tasty summer treat!

One of my favourite things to do with fresh raspberries. I used half the package of jello, it's almost 1/4 cup and the other half can be used for the next pie. It's a very light tasting pie, not overwhelmingly like a baked raspberry pie.

This was wayyyyy too sweet to the point where I couldn't taste the raspberries. Maybe no extra sugar would make it better?

I love this recipe. I do use the entire envelope of jello.  I have used regular and sugar free jello, both work great. I have made it with several different kinds of fruit, I just changed the flavor of the jello to match the fruit.

Did not like it at all. Was way too sweet and the texture was weird. Glad I tried it but I won't be making this again.

I've been making strawberry pie like this for many years.  I loved the fresh raspberries, they were so fresh right from my garden.  However, the pie crust didn't turn out the way I like it.  I'll probably just follow the directions on the package from now on for the crust.  I did use 3 generous cups of berries as I had a deep dish crust.  All I had on hand was sugar free black cherry jello so I used that and it was awesome. I used 1/2 pack of jello seeing it was sugar free.  Very good pie.

I just made this pie for Thanksgiving! My family loves it so much, they wanted it rather than pumpkin pie. The tart/ sweet combo is amazing. I use a graham cracker crust but other than that, follow as written. Now a family favorite!!
