An excellent dish as is. Instead of using 1 can of drained peas I substituted a thawed 12 oz package of frozen peas and carrots. Also added a little garlic and finely diced yellow onion for added flavor. The whole family enjoyed it.

My mom's version: she uses leftover chicken, turkey or ham(smoked is awesome!), adds a tablespoon of lemon juice and a raw shredded carrot. Canned peas are OK but she uses frozen-they cook in minutes. We do not use onions, it will take a strong overpowering onion smell and taste, especially if you're planning to keep the leftovers for a while in the fridge.  Best if chilled over night to let the flavors blend:you can really taste the difference. Store in air tight containers and it will last for a week in the fridge. (DOES NOT freeze well) Great as a sandwich spread or side dish. your favorite chicken wing or fried chicken dish will go well with it. :)--For those who rated the recipe without reading the directions: tomatoes are NOT used in the recipe, they are only the garnish--

This food is so Delicious and is a good dish for family and friend gatherings or birthday parties. The chicken breast also can be replaced by ham so the cook time would be decreased. Enjoy it!

Olivier Salad is called "Salad Olivier" in Iran, and the version that I learned has grated carrots (optional, but no tomatoes except as a side platter). Iranian cooks typically boil chicken (I use bone-in chicken breasts) to cook it (creating very tender chicken and a delicious leftover stock), and shred the cooked soft-boiled chicken with a fork (rather than chop it finely). Also, they grate their potatoes and hard-boiled eggs (as in this recipe) instead of mash them simply because they generally do not have potato mashers in their market. Iranian cooks very commonly decorate the "mayonnaise topping" with salad ingredients (see the photos). I like to make this salad very rich with a lot of eggs and chicken so that it is a cross between a potato, egg, and chicken salad to make it more filling (the very rich version is my version: not an authentic version). In Iran, Salad Olivier is commonly served with side platters of pita bread and thinly-sliced tomatoes as a meal. The pita bread may be cut in eighths so it can be used as a kind of "salad holder" as it is being eaten, usually with tomatoes. I like to take Salad Olivier to potlucks: it has a beautiful presentation! I tell my friends that it is my "Persian Potato Salad." After Christmas, I sometimes make a turkey version of this salad (not authentic) with my usual leftovers (turkey, potatoes, deviled eggs, and pickles). Salad Olivier tastes best if the filling (no mayonnaise topping) is made a day ahead.

As is, I would rate 3 for "Just OK".  Add some mustard and salt and it will give it the kick that it needs to be a 4.

I put less mayonnaise in it and used deli chicken. Forgot the pickles and tomatoes. But the combination of chicken, egg, potato and peas was rather unexpected for a salad and really good!

Add 1 small cucumber diced 1/4 x1/4' and about 1/4 lb smoked salami diced very fine and you will see the difference. It brings a lot of freshness and taste.
