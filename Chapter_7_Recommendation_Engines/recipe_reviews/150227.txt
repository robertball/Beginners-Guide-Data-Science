The variation I find that works the best for me is just by adding a cup of "smeed" to the batter this is Semolina flour the "fine" one and also by adding 1/2 tsp of baking soda to help the batter puff up. The cheese filling should have some "syrian string cheese" or you can use "mozzarella" if you cant find the syrian one . To the syrup mixture add and additional cup of sugar or double the recommended amount in this recipe (note: the sugar should always be double the amount of water for the right thickness of the simple syrup and it should be made in advance and cooled because you will drop the hot kayef into the syrup after frying and draining)   Also for a more authentic katayed there is an additional or alternative filling which is walnuts,sugar and cinnamon. Opt. If you can find black sesame seeds you can sprinkle a few onto the wet batter for a more authentic flavor of Katayef. I hope this helps for this Ramadan and "Sa7tain" :)

I've tried authentic katayef in the middle east, (usually for ramadan). Something was missing in this recipe. The cheese filling was much too watery.
The syrup too watery and the dough didn't turn out perfect either. The basics are there but it needs a few modifications.
