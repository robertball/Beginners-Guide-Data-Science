I tried this recipe just as it is. I thought it was a great change from barbeque sauce all the time. I do plan on using it again. My wife doesn't care for mangoes, so she didn't care for it. Duh!

This was unexpectedly amazing. I admit I was skeptical and was expecting it to taste just like a teriyaki marinade, but no. The mango came through loud and clear. Everyone just loved the flavor this added to grilled chicken. I ended up leaving it to marinate for a few days as dinner plans got waylaid and had to be postponed. That may have had an impact on the level of flavor. I will be using this recipe again. Brilliant. Tasty and simple.

I thought this sounded like it would be a great marinade. I cut the cherries down to about half a cup since I'm not big on that flavor. Once I had it all mixed up I actually did not like the smell or taste of it that much at all. But I let pork chops marinade for about 30 minutes and put them on the grill with very little of the juice on the them. Then used a honey bbq sauce to grill with them and they turned out wonderful! I would use this recipe again doing the same thing but cutting all ingredients drastically since I wouldn't need as much to use as a cooking base.

The store I was shopping at was out of mango nectar so I substituted peach nectar.  I also saved some dried cherries and topped the chicken with them.  Fabulous!

Very easy and pretty good.  We made it with chicken.  It only gets 4 stars because my husband and I thought it was a little salty, but my picky 3 year old really liked it.  I had the leftovers today on a salad.  I will definitely make it again.
