I give this recipe 4 stars because I did not make it the way it's written.  But what I did make was fantastic. I doubled this recipe and then misread it.  Instead of mixing 2 containers of pesto with 1/2c cream cheese, I mixed 2 Tbsp with 1/2c cream cheese.  The results were delicious and now I can't imagine that doing it the way it's written could be any better, especially since pesto is not cheap.

I made these for a brunch, they were the HIT of the party. I did change the recipe a bit since I could not find the BUITONI pesto w/ sun-dried tomatoes.  I made regualr pesto instead (the ones you buy in the packet and add water and oil). I mixed that with the cream cheese.  Then I bought sun-dried tomatoes in oil (those sold in a jar).  I also used Low-carb wraps to make it on the healthier side.  I can't wait to make them again.

Easy too make and fresh and tasty.  I've made these on several occasions when I had to prepare something ahead of time that will be served outdoors.  I can never find the pesto with sundried tomatoes, so I just add diced sundried tomatoes packed in oil (drained) to the pesto. I also use spinach tortillas to add more color and flavor.

Very good recipe.  I used fat free cream cheese and it was still very good.

This is a delicious recipe which I am enjoying for lunch this very minute!  The sun-dried tomato pesto and cream cheese really make it special.  I used turkey from the deli, swiss cheese, shredded romaine, tomatoes, and red onion on a whole grain tortilla.  I wish I had made two!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This is a really refreshing, light dinner for a warm evening.  We doubled the recipe and and had some the next day for lunch as well.  I was unable to find the Buitoni sun dried tomato pesto, so I used a different brand and it was just fine.
