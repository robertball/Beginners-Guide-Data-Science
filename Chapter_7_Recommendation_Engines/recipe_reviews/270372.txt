I usually don't like potatoes, but this was delicious.  I had cubed hash browns so I baked it for 60 minutes as mentioned in footnotes.  Yummy!

Pretty tasty. The store was out of shredded hash browns so bought diced with peppers and onions. I liked the peppers in it. Itâ€™s quite a saucy dish, with strong sour cream flavor.  I might decrease sour cream next time. I wish it had gotten more crispy so might broil at end or cook at 400 next time.
