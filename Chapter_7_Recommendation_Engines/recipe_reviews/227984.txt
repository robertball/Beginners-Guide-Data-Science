This was really good!  We went blackberry picking and I needed to use them up along with some blueberries that had been sitting in the fridge, so I tried it out.  Quick and easy to make and the kids had fun with it too.  We didn't use the chocolate chips and it came out sweet and crunchy on top :)

Only one review for this recipe?   Goodness, it was delicious!!   Even my cobbler-hating daughter tried it and liked it.... that says a lot!  The white chocolate chip, brown sugar topping was great.     This was a winner in our household.

This is a very good cobbler. The crust is excellent, sweet and crunchy on top and moist on the bottom. Its very similar to shortbread, not the "biscuit- like" crust. This is much better. I didn't make any changes except soaked berries a bit longer.

I thought this would be great, but I was disappointed. As others have said, with the white chocolate chips and the brown sugar, it's just way too sweet. After 35 minutes in the oven, the cake batter was still batter. It sounded so promising.

DH loved it and declared it one of the best ever.  Me, not so much.  I thought it was way sweet and I didn't add the choc chips or brown sugar.  If the blackberries had been more sour it might not have been so bad.  The bottom was gooey and unappealing too.  Oh well.  I'll probably make it again to keep my sweetie happy.

This was delicious! The topping was a little fiddly, but SO worth it! We loved it. :)

Tastes great but came out soupy. I followed the directions precisely so I'm not sure what I did wrong.

Loved this recipe! I used blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries. Also, I didn't have any white chocolate chips so I crushed up pecans and mixed them with the brown sugar for the topping. It was a great recipe and I've already made it twice in 1 week.

Raised in the south, I have eating a lot of cobblers. This was a wonderful introduction to adding blueberries. I did leave out the brown suger but added the white chocolate. Would serve to my mother in law

Way too sweet! Not enough fruit to all the topping. My husband is a dessert freak and he thought it was way too sweet.
