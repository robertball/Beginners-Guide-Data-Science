This recipe makes a nice chicken stock, but it might be more flavorful with a few more vegetables in it, especially celery and onions.
One or two basic herbs, such as bay leaf or 
marjoram, might also add flavor.

I used the remains of a roasted chicken, which was highly seasoned. Worked out well!

I gave this only 4 stars because without seasonings this would be too bland.  I added fresh ground pepper, garlic salt, basil, & pinch of salt.  It was still a bit lacking but a great start.

I used a slow cooker and it worked out well however you must add seasonings--bay leaves, basil, etc. to make this a five star recipe.
