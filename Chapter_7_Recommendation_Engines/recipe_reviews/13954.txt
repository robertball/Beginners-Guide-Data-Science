I debated trying these for a long time before I finally did it.  I was almost positive they were going to be too weird for us!  I give this a 4 instead of a 5 because I made half with black beans and half with kidney beans and the black beans were much better!  Also, mashing the beans after they're in the skillet is a real pain.  Next time I'll mash them first.  I was worried that it was going to be too much cumin and chili powder, but used all the spices just as the recipe suggested and it was the perfect contrast against the subtle sweetness of the potatoes.  Next time I'll use a little more cheese in each burrito.  Served with sour cream.

We loved these & thought they were far from bland. I didn't exactly follow the recipe though. Some spices, particularly curry, cumin & chile powder, need to be sauteed a bit to help release their flavors. So I sauteed my onion for a few minutes, added the garlic (didn't want to cook it too long as it turns bitter), then a  couple of minutes later, added the cumin, chile & cayenne....allowing them to heat for a minute or two. Thsi really pulls the flavor out & makes a big difference.  I used black beans (rinsed & drained & only mashed enough to beak up the beans) instead of kidney beans & I used vegetable broth instead of water, only adding enough to make it the consistency that I wanted.  I used a mexican blend cheese, dark brown spicy mustard & just mixed my mashed sweet potatoes into the bean mixture instead of loading them separately into the burritos. Once assembled, I gave the burritos a light spray w/ olive oil cooking spray, just enough to fake them out & make them think they had been fried. ;o) Served them w/ fresh mango slices & avocado slizes, sprinkled w/ lime & salt. Brigadiero's (from this site) for dessert. I froze the leftovers on a cookie sheet. I'll wrap them separately in plastic wrap & then put them in a freezer bag.  Thansk for a wonderful recipe Karena!

I recently became a vegetarian and I was looking for a good pre-race meal that would provide my body with the energy needed during a triathlon.  This recipe fits the bill!  As the recipe makes 8-10 depending on what size tortilla you use, I have shared these with several of my cycling and triathlete friends and EVERYONE of them has asked for the recipe.  I only made a few changes to this recipe.  I used 1 can black beans, 1 can pinto beans and 1 cup frozen corn as my bean mixture.  Mash the beans with a potato masher prior to adding the corn for better texture.  I also substituted 8in multigrain low carb tortillas for the flour tortillas, as well as 2% sharp cheddar cheese instead of mild cheddar.  Last, but not least, I put a tablespoon of light sour cream on my burrito after it is heated and ready to eat.  These burritos keep very well.  After cooking them in the oven, I let them cool then wrap each one in a paper towel and freeze in a zip lock bag.  To reheat, just remove from bag, leave in paper towel, and heat in microwave for 2 minutes.  These are just fabulious!!!

Very good and very healthy. Flavours were just right. Like other reviewers, I used black beans in place of kidney beans and left them quite chunky when I mashed them. I baked the sweet potatoes and scooped them out and mashed them very smooth with salt and pepper. I used reduced fat old cheddar and whole wheat tortillas. Served with shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes, green onions and green peppers and light sour cream. We both loved them. They are quite large, I couldn't finish mine; next time I may make them in the 6-inch tortillas. I froze ten of them, and both my boyfriend and I are looking forward to taking them for lunches! Many thanks for the recipe!


*UPDATE*
Just a quick note on reheating the frozen burritos...It works perfectly in the oven from frozen. 30 mins wrapped in foil at 350, them 15 mins unwrapped to crisp them up. Better than when I first made them!

This was surprisingly good!!  I made it into a baked casserole, layering corn tortillas, bean mixture, yams, cheese. I used black beans and jalapeno jack cheese, added green bell peppers, increased the spices, and garnished w/ sour cream and green onions. My family LOVED it. Do reduce the liquid by half.

5 Star Concept - 3 Star Execution. There is no place for water in this recipe and including  it wrecked it for the unwitting as reported in their reviews. The correct way to make this recipe is to cook kidney beans from dry goods. 1 lb. makes 6 cups. They will be perfect and ready without mashing or water. 3 large yams skinned, cooked (13 minutes in microwave in Pyrex pot with water) should make 6 cups – mash in a big stock pot on low heat. Make seasoning as a sauce by using exact ingredients plus 2 squirts of Sriracha and 2 tbls of sweet chili sauce and one tbls safflower oil. The end result will be mildly spicy by American standards. To make spicier, add more chili powder, cayenne, and Sriracha sauce in suggested proportions. Pour the sauce evenly on top of the beans in the skillet and stir. 4 tbls high heat safflower is best oil for this recipe. Also, 12 oz of cheese is required. Type of Cheddar is not called out. Sharp is best for this recipe – Mexican blend will work. This recipe will produce exactly the stated dozen 10” burritos. Thus, it will produce (10) 12” burritos (12” flour tortillas are the best value at Costco). If you prepare dish to these specs you will have a fab meal and leftovers while realizing the full potential of the concept, which is excellent.

I make this recipe all the time - it's become a staple in my household. Wonderful!  I would recommend using a potato masher to mash the beans, as this is the most time-consuming part. I also scale the recipe down to make 5 burritos (1 can beans, 1 can sweet potatos, 1/4 onion).

Thank you Karena for sharing this recipe.  I made it as per the recipe, except, I cut the ingredients in half, as this makes a large amount.  The spice level for me was just right, as I like to taste the other ingredients in the recipe and not overpower them with heavy spices.  As my tastes are not the same as yours, I will probably make a few changes, the next time I make this and there will be a next time.  Possibly a different type of bean and try a different cheese, like pepper jack for a kick. I don't normally write reviews for the recipes on here, but I finally felt like voicing my opinion.  I feel that some of the reviews, on this site, not just on this recipe, would be better left off.  Especially the ones that totally re-write a recipe.  My advise to all members, is to keep in mind a quote that I read from Chef Michael Smith.  He wrote " Recipes are how one cook shares ideas with another cook! They're just words on paper; a guideline, a starting point from which to improvise"   These words are absolutely true.  Every recipe on this site, will have alterations done to it, to suit each persons own tastes.  A few tweaks mentioned are good, but if your are going to re-write it...submit your own. Thanks again Karena, and to all the other cooks that have the guts to submit their recipes for us to enjoy.

Awesome, but I would used refried beans next time so avoid the hassle of mashing the kidney beans.

Oh my goodness, these are incredible.  I was sceptical at first - but the flavor of these was awesome.  I actually only started out with about a fourth of a batch, which made four burritos, and used a can of black beans instead of the called for kidney beans.  Also used tomato-basil tortillas and used a Mexican cheddar-jack mix instead of straight cheddar.  I'm making a bigger batch next time, because these were just TOO GOOD!

This is real similar to a recipe that I have from a Moosewood low-fat cookbook.  I have made these frequently...even my meat-eater hubby likes these.  I use black beans and top with salsa and low-fat sour cream.  A winner!

The beans in this recipe were tasteful but if you like your beans spicy I would recommend adding more cayenne pepper.  These were not as good as I thought they would be but they were goo. Next time to cut the time shorter I would steam the potatoes or microwave them first rather then boil water and then wait till they are soft.  No one liked them but me, they are probably a bad idea for picky eaters.

I am always a bit skeptical when trying "vegetarian" recipes.    I was raised a vegetarian and I love good vegetarian food, not just “vegetarian” food.  There is a difference!  These are delicious!  If I had a restaurant these burritos would defiantly be on the menu under the "Really Good Vegetarian Food" section!  Even my husband who does not enjoy vegetarian food really likes them.**UPDATE** OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS!!!! 5 ***** AFTER MY MODIFICATIONS!!!!    I FOUND A NEW WAY TO ENJOY THESE!!! I SAUTEED 2 CUPS FINELY CHOPPED ONION UNTIL TRANSLUCENT IN A LITTLE OIL.  THEN I ADDED BLACK BEANS 39 OZ OF THEM (I HAD A 15 OZ AND A 24 OZ CAN) . I MASHED THE BEANS TO RESEMBLE GROUND BEEF, ABOUT 50/50. THEN I ADDED A PKG OF TACO SEASONING B/C I WAS PRESSED FOR TIME AND A LITTLE WATER ABOUT 3/4 CUP (EYEBALL IT).  I BAKED 4 LARGE SWEET POTATOES MASHED THEM AND ADDED CINNAMON (YOU WONT BELIEVE HOW GOOD IT IS TILL YOU TRY IT) (A LOT OF MEXICAN DISHES ADD CINNAMON)I PUT EQUAL PARTS BEAN MIXTURE AND POTATO MIXTURE INTO SOFT TORTILLAS (THEY WERE SOFT ENOUGH OUT OF THE PACKAGE SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO WARM THEM TO GET 'EM TO BEND . . . BE CHOOSY WHEN BUYING THEM!) I WRAPPED THEM LIKE A PRESENT AND FRIED 3 OF THEM IN A PAN W/ A BIT OF OIL AND FROZE THE REST ON A COOKIE SHEET TILL FIRM AND PLACED THEM IN A BAG IN THE FREEZER.  THIS RECIPE MAKES ABOUT 18. AFTER FRYING THEM I TOPPED THEM W/ CHEESE SALSA AND SOUR CREAM YUM YUM!!!! 5 STARS WITH MY ALTERATIONS *****

I find it irritating that people practically change the entire recipe and then give it a rating. I tried the recipe as written and it is very good. My entire family loved it. Come on people, if you are going to re-write the recipe, add it as a new recipe and don't grade it after you have changed it.

agreed - use combo of beans - red, pinto and kidney. Top with plain yogurt to be healthy.  Lots of "to taste" liberties with this recipe.  Really delish!

I was very skeptical before I made this recipe. I simply couldn't imagine that the list of ingredients would work well together. Well,  I was pleasantly surprised. This recipe is very good.  One thing I would do differently is use small tortillas. These burritos are very filling, and I could barely get through one large burrito.  If you have leftovers, no problem, they freeze beautifully!

Finally... FINALLY! I made these today! Only been about a year since I saved the dang recipe! LOL! I cut the recipe in half after I looked at the recipe ingredients and thought wow - it's only me eating them! not the Canadian Armed Forces along with me! (but boys - you know I would feed you if I could!) ANYWAY, these are all they are hyped up to be and then some!  I did use Black Beans in place of kidney as I was out of kidney and noticed others had either half and half'd them with kidney or used black beans alone...I prefer the black beans personally over kidney anyday.  I did cut WAY back on the water though, probably a mere 1/4 cup as it just seemed like WAY too much liquid for all that was going on in the pan and I skipped the soy sauce altogether as I do not use it (too salty)....I also used 6-inch tortillas and after halfing the recipe, got 7 small burritos out of the deal, served with fat-free sour cream, this actually makes a pretty good 'waist' friendly meal with going really, really light on the cheese and using w/w, low-carb tortillas like I did...kudos to Karena, you definitely have a winner here!

These were fabulous! I made these when my boyfriend's vegan cousin came for dinner (she used vegan cheese) and they were a big hit! I also mashed the beans before adding them to the skillet but kept everything else the same.

I used Black Beans instead of kidney beans - also had to scramble when I discovered that I didn't have soy sauce or chili powder - used sukiyaki sauce and cajun seasoning instead - I liked them a lot more than my kids did - good change of pace - thanks

Wow!  I thought the combination of sweet potatoes, kidney beans, mustard, and soy sauce sounded very strange - but I was pleasantly surprised.  The result was absolutely wonderful.  I love sweet potatoes, and I am always looking for new sweet potato recipes - I love Mexican-inspired food, as well.  What a great dish.  I used corn tortillas instead of flour - I guess that's a matter of personal preference.  Thanks, Karena!

Very good!  I took the advice of others and made the following changes:  black beans instead of kidney, only mashed 1/2 of them, I only needed about 1/4 to 1/2 cup water rather than the 2 cups called for, added about a cup of corn, added about 3 oz cream cheese to the sweet potato mash, and added cilantro with the cheese.  My husband put sour cream on his at the table.  I warmed my wraps in the microwave & just served that way, no oven needed.  I did make some in the oven but I felt the flavor was much better just right off the stove.  My husband loved it and this will go into our regular cooking rotation and I'll be serving it to guests soon!  This is by far the best sweet potato burrito recipe I've ever tried.  YUM!

we doctored this to make it really easy. We used canned re-fried beans, spiced up with salsa, and just put them in the microwave. The whole thing took 10 minutes from the moment we walked into the kitchen. And yes, they are unusual and delicious!!!!

I made this recipe into enchiladas by using the red enchilada sauce recipe on this site. I also added green and red peppers and used refriend beans. I seasoned the sweet potatos (after I boiled them) with cayenne pepper, paprika and a bit of honey . They needed about 16 mintues in the oven but they turned out wonderful. Topped with cilantro this made a very healthy and very hearty meal. I definately recommend it with the sauce. It gives it a very nice taste and texture. I'm considering adding my own recipe to this site after I refine it a bit!

My husband & I love this recipe and I don't even like sweet potatoes! Over the year we have made a few changes:
Use 1 can kidney beans, 1 can of corn (drained), 1 cup of water, 2 cooked potatoes, and 6 tortillas. After heating the onions/beans and adding the potatoes, we then add the water, bit by bit until the mixture is smooth. Sometimes it does not take the whole cup of water. We also put the cheese inside the burrito and put sour cream on top when it's done.

-Wonderful texture; I used black beans and a can of mixed beans.
-My wife, who would neither choose a beans nor a yam recipe, thought this dish was wonderful. 
-We froze them and 'grab and go' for work.
-Mad MUCH more than 10 burritos. Buy extra tortillas.

I have been eyeballin' this recipe for quite some time.  It seemed intriguing... but mustard and soy sauce?... Really?  I finally gave it a try this week.  After all, 1000+ reviewers can't be wrong... right?    I.FELL.IN.LOVE.  Naturally, I changed things up a bit.  I sliced my sweet potatoes into 1/4 inch thick slices, tossed them in some oil, cumin, and kosher salt, placed them on parchment paper on a cookie sheet, and baked them at a 450 degrees, flipping them once, until they were nice and speckled brown.  I didn't mash the sweet potatoes at all but put them in the burrito with the other ingredients as is.  Didn't change much else to the recipe, except "cooking" the cumin, cayenne, and chili powder, which is pretty much a necessity.  I also added some fresh jalapeno, cilantro, and green onion as well.  I've made it twice this week for friends and roommates.  EVERYONE is enamored with these most excellent burritos!

Great recipe! I served it with Newman's Own pineapple salsa and it was fantastic! I scaled the recipe down to three servings and it fed two adults and a child w/ left overs! I did mix black beans w/ the kidney (equal parts) and I left the potatoes and the beans a little chunky instead of mashing the whole thing. Next time the only changes I will make is to not mash any of it (the texture adds to it) and leaving out the cheese (I ended up scraping mine off, I didn't think it needed it).

Definitely DO NOT use the 2c recommended water.  More like 2T.  Otherwise, really good recipe.

I use black beans instead of kidney beans, and love it.  Make extra, they make a great quick lunch or dinner.

I make this dish every couple of weeks, wrap the individual burritos, and freeze them to eat for lunch or dinner on busy days. It's so easy to pop them in the microwave, and it's definitely more nutritious than a frozen dinner! I like to use wholegrain mustard in mine and I replace the kidney beans with black beans. To make these even healthier I use whole wheat tortillas. Don't waste time making sure the beans are thoroughly mashed, and sautee the spices with the onion to bring out the flavors more.

I had everything to make this (really sorry I waited so long) but didn't feel like making beans from dried.  Remembered I had some overdone navy beans in the freezer.  I used those and since they were all mashed added a can of Ranch beans with jalapeños.  Cubed and steamed my sweet potatoes and mixed them in like that instead of mashing. I really wanted more heat so used a can of Rotel instead of any water, will use extra hot Rotel next time.  Used in burritos, as dip for chips, as topping for tostadas.  All VERY good.  Skipped the cheese half the time and didn't miss it at all.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe! I made all the changes recommended by previous reviewers. I added green peppers, added my spices before the beans, used brown mustard, used black beans along with the kidney beans, added a cup or so of frozen corn, and mashed the beans before adding them. I also added about 2T of taco seasoning, and didn't need anywhere near 2 C of water. I served with vegan non soy cheese, spinach, and salsa. I would definitely make this on a regular basis!! It made ALOT though, so I will probably shorten the recipe for future use.

These are fantastic!!! I loved the flavour combination, I would have never thought to combine them. I added corn to the leftovers the next day, and I found that I liked the texture with the corn better.  I am so happy to have found this recipe:)

Healthy & Delicious!  I used black beans and omitted the water.  Turned out great!  Sweet potatoes took a while to cook so next time I might use frozen.  It made a ton and I am freezing for lunches/snacks.

I made a double batch of these and instead of baking them threw them straight into the freezer. Being a student, it was the perfect solution to avoiding greasy over-priced meals at the cafeteria- it would defrost in my school bag over the course of the morning, and was ready for the microwave by lunch! Do season according to your tastes- I needed a little more kick to mine. The name is accurate, these are addictive (the flavour combination is captivating) but the texture is a little too uniform and dense to earn it a perfect rating, in my opinion. Baking them would no doubt help with this, adding a little crispness.

I must say I had to read A LOT of the reviews before I decided to make this.  it has such an odd mix of things but all in all it was good!  I would NOT say its easy to make, the bean mixture was too soupy so when I put in the tortilla it ran all over and I couldn't fold it like a buritto.  I would say do 1/2 cup water at the very most.  You can tell when you are putting the water in how soupy it is.  Other then that I would say its really good!  Packed with lots of fiber and vitiams.

I would have never thought to mix sweet potatos and beans!  As suggested I used black beans which I love.  I didn't even have all the required ingredients and they were still very good.  I microwaved them and put some salsa inside as well.  I have these a lot for lunch!

Helloooo you sweet, sweet potato burritos! It's a pleasure to eat- I mean, meet you. I picked this recipe because of all the positive reviews and because it was easily vegan-ized.  I substituted Braggs Liquid Aminos for the soy sauce.  Next time, I am not going to stuff my burritos quite as much.  I made only 5 burritos with this recipe... 12 is a definite stretch.  But 7 or 8 would have been the right amount.  Also, I used black beans instead of kidney beans-- great choice!  Lots of flavor!  Once you go black (beans) you don't go back!

Awesome.  Note one way to make mashed sweet potatoes is to heat the oven to 400 and bake them for 40-50 minutes.  After letting them cool for a bit, they are much easier to skin and mash.

I've got to admit, I was skeptical...I made sure I had some cooked chicken on hand in case the sweet potato filling was a flop.   We didn't need it!!  I can't wait to spring this one on my father-in-law, he's a sweet potato nut!   Great stuff.

I had leftover mashed sweet potatoes with brown sugar and was looking for something to do with them. I found this recipe and was somewhat skeptical to try it but, I was pleasantly surprised. The sweet and the salty went great together. I will definitely make it again!

These are -so- good!  My friend sent me this recipe, and at first I was a little nervous to try it out.  But when I made it, it was so great! These things are so addictive!  I did have a little bit of a problem the first time I made them, and maybe some of it is trail and error on what works well for you.  I eat the mixture in a pita pouch as well! yum!

I made these last night for my husband and I. I found them incredibly easy to make and very tasty. We like spicy food and so found them a bit bland - I will be making them again and adding more spices, onions and garlic for some extra zing!

Overall a good recipe. I will definitely be making them again.

This is wonderful! Thanks for a great recipe! 

OI used only 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. I made it super easy by using 2 cans of refried black beans and 2 of whole black beans. Didn't have to mash anything. Used no water and can't imagine why it would be used. Didn't even use the water from the beans. Also, cooking sweet potatoes is very simple when you cut them into one inch slices and cook them for 30 minutes or less at 400 degrees. I lightly coat the slices with olive oil and a little sea salt. The skins slide right off after baking. used 2 fat pinches of the cayenne pepper too, and cooked the bean mixture just a couple of minutes after adding the spices. I used Dijon mustard!

The way I like to finish these is by putting extra cheese on top of the burritos and covering lightly with foil, then heating for 25 minutes or so at 350 degrees. Make sure the foil does't stick to the cheese before heating.

I debated making this recipe for a while because the addition of soy sauce and mustard was a little off-putting--when I finally made the recipe I omitted them. I definitely didn't make this recipe as specified--I used it more as a concept more than a guide. I also wanted to make a much smaller amount since there are only 2 of us--12 burritos is a bit much. I used one can of beans and one very large sweet potato (probably like the size of 2 normal ones).
I sauteed the onion and garlic with some kale and I added the spices to that. I used oregano, chipotle powder, cayenne, cumin, and turmeric. Once that was the right consistence I added a can of pinto beans. I just added the boiled sweet potato straight into the bean mixture and blended it up using an immersion blender. Those were the main things that I changed and I think the turned out great. The recipe as written 3 stars since it has some weird ingredients and unnecessary steps (Why would you add so much water? Why put the beans and the sweet potato in separately?), 4.5 stars for how it turned out when I made it.
Served with salsa verde, diced onions, cilantro, and plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.

Oh yeah, WAY better than you'd think.  I also mashed the beans before putting them in my non-stick pan.  The meat-eater in the house walked past the beans simmering on the stove and stopped to smell it and excitedly proclaim, "you're cooking meat!"  He liked the final product, as did the kids.  They were content to eat them without the sour cream and salsa.  They freeze really well individually wrapped in cling-wrap, and I froze some child-sized ones with smaller tortillas for quick kid's meals.  (About 15 minutes in the toaster oven)  Good with white potatoes too.

I was so mad after trying to make this recipe, that I wasn't even hungry anymore. My kitchen is a total disaster from trying to "mash" beans in a boiling hot pan (which BTW, you will need a very large pan if you make the suggested quantity, not a medium pan). I finally had to transfer the whole mixture into a food processor, which made a huge mess. Then I was left with a soupy substance that was way too thin to be the main ingredient in a burrito. I'm still fuming about the mess in my kitchen. It's still cooking in the oven. I thought it sounded gimmicky, and I was right. I'm learning how to find the REAL recipes on this site, and this is not one of them.

I thought these were fairly tasty and very filling, but I was the only one who really enjoyed them.  My family thought it was O.K. for a new, unique meal, but I was not asked to make them again.

One of my favourite recipes from allrecipes.  We make 10 to 15 of these at a time and keep them in the freezer for busy nights when we don't have time to cook.

No. No. No.  I will not make these again.  How can these get such a high rating?  If you want burritos make burritos.  Don’t mix yams/sweet potatoes into them.  And don’t get me wrong I like sweet potatoes and I love burritos.  This mix also had too much cumin in it.   By the way it only made 7 burritos not 12 as advertised.

After the first bite, my husband said, "You should make these three times a week!"  I never would have thought to put these flavors together, but we loved it.  The very picky four year old daughter wasn't as thrilled, but her 7 year old sister loved them.  I wouldn't use as much water next time because they were a tad on the soupy-side.  I like the idea of adding black beans. I'll try that next time I make this (this week!).

Just tried this tonight - I love it! I'm a university student and I don't cook all that often, so it took me a while to figure out the sweet potato.. found it was easiest to microwave it for 10-15 minutes and then scoop it out, then you don't have to mash it. I followed the directions pretty much exactly, except I did add a little less water. Also, I added the water while I was mashing the beans, so it got absorbed better and made the mashing easier. I made these with whole-wheat tortillas, so I can actually feel good about what I'm eating instead of fries or KFC every night... Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this recipe several times and it gets better every time I make it.  My 3 year old even loves these!  I have even mixed everything together into one pan and found that with a few quick stirs, putting the bean/sweet potato mixture into the tortillas was easier this way.  Thank you for an awesome recipe!

I've made this recipe twice - the 2nd time for my doubtful coworkers (one of whom is allergic to gluten) - they still are talking about it, after 2 months (and making it for themselves!)  I cut down on the water added to the bean mixture.  Yum!!

I thought these were OK.  I really liked the bean mixture (I used black), but the sweet potatoes did not tast that good with it (and I LOVE sweet potatoes).  I would rather have extra cheese and no sweet potatoes.  I will definitely use the bean mixtire next time, but leave out potatoes!

Delicious! Make ahead and reheat in oven at 350 for 35-40 minutes. I recommend covering them for the first 30 minutes and then removing cover for the last 10 minutes to make them a little crisp.

Weird, interesting and ABSOLUTELY delicious.  Followed the recipe for spices but used black beans.  Always make the full recipe so I can freeze extra's for lunches.  Very filling and a great non meat meal.

These are terrific! My husband used to be a "meat and potatoes only" kind of guy but I'm slowly converting him. He really likes these! They are super delicious with cholula sauce. The recipe makes several burritos, I wrap the extras in Saran Wrap and freeze them. They heat up nicely in a hot oven, I do 18-20 minutes in a 400 oven for reheat. I was out of mustard this time, still turned out great. Mustard is not necessary, but it does add a little something extra.

truly exceptional! i followed others tips and used  canned black beans. i am a wuss, so i cut down the chili powder and cumin to half. i threw everything in a large pot and pulsed the mixture until semi-smooth. it was served with lettuce and fresh tomatos on top. i let the wife taste the mixture and she hung around the stove,"' when is it gonna be done?"...my highest compliement from her. i know the ingredients sound crazy together, but having a wife who will not eat meat on fridays i'm always looking for something like this. there is going to be 6 left over. gonna be wrapped in alumiun foil and saved for a rainy day. karena hit one out of the park here! GIVE THIS A SHOT.  no suger, salt or butter added. i did use pam to grease the casserole dishes.

I love this recipe. I add a lot more cayenne because I love spicy. I also use a whole roasted garlic bulb. Slightly mash the beans and sweet potatoes. (I like chunky) Mix them all together and freeze in batches. I also do not use water but drain the beans and use about 1/2 cup of the liquid.Oh, 1 can kidney and 2 cans black beans. 1 Can of the black beans I do not mash

My husband couldn't find the words to describe how good these burritos taste.  I found them exceptionally good as well.  I ended up making approximately 30 burritos with the soft taco size tortillas.  I'm going to freeze the rest. I used three cans of black beans and only 1 cup of water.  I left everything else the same except for cooking the spices with the onion and garlic mixture for a couple of minutes.  Absolutely addictive! -- especially the next day.

As written, I found this to be very bland, which was surprising to me given the list of spices.  I ended up adding some Sriracha, lime juice and cilantro, which improved things considerably.  Still, I don't think I'd make this again.

These were so easy! They are good, as so many have already said. I down-sized to stuffing for 3 burritos, but used two 10 inch ones and over-stuffed them. My husband and I split one , and will have the second one for lunch tomorrow. Glad to have finally given these a whirl.

These were fantastic!  It took a while to do all the mashing, but it was totally worth it.  I didn't love them at the first sitting, but after reheating, the flavors had a little party and rocked it right on out.  I froze a bunch and had them available for quick and easy lunch options.

I'm making this for the second time.  Held a dinner party of 8 previously and it was an absolute HIT!!!  Everyone loved it and it even made it into our local fitness training news letter.  I opted to use the black beans as everyone else suggested but the pain was still in the mashing... this time my husband was the genious and suggested putting the beans/cooked onions in the blender with the water, then return to pan the spices/sauces. VOILA!!!! Difficult became EASY!!!! Yummy lunches for the next few days to come :)

Fabulous! Scaled it down to fit my small family. Made some changes: one can of  black beans, one can of sweet potatoes, dried chopped onions and onion powder instead of whole onion, garlic powder, spicy mustard, and 6-in instead of 10-in tortillas.

Loved this recipe for breakfast burritos..I halved the recipe as it was just for me and used taco size tortillas and black beans in place of the kidney. I saute'd  the onions and garlic then mashed the sweet potato & beans together and dropped that in the pan and added the remaining spices to quicken the process.  I made this recipe for less then $5.00 as I had the spices on hand.

I made these for a vegetarian friend and had more than I needed to give her, so I hesitantly tried one. I am so glad I did because this is in my top 10 list of favorite foods and we always have some in the freezer for lunches or quick suppers. I don't mash the beans- I just buy 2 cans of refried black beans and then don't add as much water. I wrap them individually in foil and freeze them in a freezer bag. Bake them at 350 for 35-40 min and you're good to go. Thaw them out first, and you just have 15 min. These really are addictive.

Kind of blah flavor. I guess we are used to more chile. Really like the idea and flavor of the sweet potatoe though! Has great potential, just need to experiment some more.

This recipe has become a family favorite.  As a mother of five children, it is unusual to find a recipe that they all like.  They love these burritos.  I do use less water than called for in the recipe and have substituted the beans with black or pinto beans.  I also use canned sweet potatoes at times.  (This lessens preparations time.)

These are great.  We dip them in a salsa/ranch mix.  I've served them to my whole family of people who don't like sweet potates and they've all loved them!

I am not a vegetarian, but am always
looking for ways to cut down on the meat.
This recipe was super!  I was a little
wary of the sweet potato, but they 
were great.  Just the right balance of
textures.  My husband loved them 
and my 7 yr. old loved the sweet potato
I baked them enchilada style and added
salsa to the bottom of the pan so they
would not stick & also topped them with
more salsa.
Great recipe.  Will definately make
them again.

Wow! This is really good! The sweet potatoes give a nice rich sweet taste to the mix. Very good and very easy to make!

Instead of making my own refried beans - per the recipe - I oppted to use canned spicy - no fat refried beans from the store - and I mictrowaved 3 raw sweet potatoes - although 2 would have been enough - cook in microwave according to directions for baked poatatoes - I did 3 for 6 minutes and then peeled and mashed them.  

This recipe is VERY Yummy and good!  My husband even liked it!  You don't really taste the sweet potatoes in it - but they do take some of the "bite" out of the spicy beans.

I really liked this recipe but the hubs did not.  He is not a sweet potato fan and saw me add them to the pan, so that might have had something to do with it!  He did take two bites, per my request, and said the burritos were not addictive.  I did not add any water to the recipe and mixed the beans with the sweet potatoes (in an effort to conceal the sweet potatoes from the hubs).  I will make this again for my running friends as I can see them liking a high protein meal that is healthy.

These were very good and easy to make. I microwaved a big sweet potato cut in half with a little water in a glass dish for about 8 minutes turning once.The bean mixture came together quickly, I thought i added too much water but i just let it reduce a bit, which made all the spices fragrant. and used some grated almond pepper jack cheese. Instead of baking i used my panini press. I also used only one can of Simple Truth tribeans (black, pinto and kidney)and they were perfect for this recipe. It made 5 burritos in under 25 minutes.. not bad at all.

I was skeptical about this recipe due to the sweet potatoes but my BF was adamant about it. Glad he was, these were delicious! Next time I will use 1/2 black beans, 1/2 kidney beans. 
I added some salsa to the bean mixture & will add cilantro next time. 
Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Yes, this is "weird" in that it is different from your typical bean burrito-- but I thought it was very good for an easy meal for 2 non-vegetarians trying to eat more vegetarian meals. I thought,  "Really, 3 TBSP chile powder" (not a typo) & "TWO cups of water"??  Well, to solve the "bean soup" problem, and the "bland" sweet potato concerns, I cut the microwave-cooked sweet potatoes into cubes, & mixed it with the bean mix, creating the perfect blend of texture, taste, & water absorption for the burrito filling. I put the filling directly into the flour tortillas with the cheddar cheese, because I was on a hot houseboat, & did not want to turn on the oven. Because I had no potato masher or food processor to mash the kidney beans, it took a while longer to mash with a fork, but not impossible(think camping).  I would gladly make this again, especially if the filling I froze, tastes as good as other reviewers proclaimed.

Like many others, I was skeptical about trying these.....but I am so glad I did. They are amazing. I used dark kidney beans and since I didn't have any cayenne, I used just a small amound of red pepper flakes. I think I may try them with black beans next time, because I will definitely be making these again!!!!!!

Fantastic Recipe! I took the advice of some other reviewers and added the chilli powder and cumin to the onion and let it heat up a bit. Then used half black beans and half kidney beans. Once the bean mixture was ready I mixed in some corn. Will be making this again for sure!

I've made this twice, and even though it requires a fair amount of prep work AND is a bit fussy, the end result is well worth it. You taste crunch and sweetness first and you're thinking, okay, that's different, then the spicy bean mixture hits and your mind is officially blown. Caveats that I would offer: 1) Choose the ginormous tortillas meant for burritos, not the smaller ones intended for soft tacos and fajitas. I never paid any attention to what's written on the different bags until this recipe. If you use the soft taco ones, adjust how much you fill them accordingly and -- bonus -- you'll make even more. 2) Eyeball how much water to add to the pan at the end; for me, over a cup was way too much and I ended up with a bean soup. 3) Watch the burrito assembly video tutorial or you'll end up with some funky-looking packages.

I'm not vegetarian but I made these for a vegetarian girlfriend who just had a baby - it's awesome because it A) makes so much B) is filling and good C) will be easy to heat after freezing D) lots of protein for a breastfeeding mom E) it's so easy for an exhausted new mom to eat when she has 30 seconds to spare. The recipe made a TON! I ran out of wheat tortillas (16 taco sized - there's enough for 18 I think) before I ran out of either filling (plan on mixing the extra beans with rice and using the sweet potatoes just as a side to a dinner). I froze them wrapped in paper towels, on a sheet tray then threw them (wrapped) into a Ziplock bag exactly as Toni mentioned. So so pleased with this recipe. UPDATE: I had so much of the bean mixture left over, I froze it for a rainy day. Just made a snack for the hubby who's always starved when he gets home from work - stuffed whole wheat pita halves with 2 spoonfuls of the bean mixture, then a sprinkle of cheddar cheese and froze them. He's so happy!

My hubby and I loved this recipe. Like some other reviewers, I used BLACK beans (1 can ...halved the recipe) and would recommend less water/liquid. I roasted chunks of sweet potato with some olive oil and cumin rather than mashing. Served with sour cream and homemade guacamole... delicious and filling.

I loved these but my husband was not a fan. I made a mistake in blending the sweet potatoes and also blending the kidney beans - so the end result was too smooth. I did not add all the water - and slow cooked the beans for quite a while until it was the consistency of re-fried beans. I froze the remainder of the burritos and took one out for a quick lunch. Very good.

They were pretty good. My kids ate them. I was surprised that the kidney beans worked in this recipe. I will probably make them again, but I'll most likely add something with a different texture (meat?) too, as the whole thing was a little too creamy.

What am I missing here?? Bland, weird tasting burritos. Recipe instructions are bad also. If you do decide to make these, I recommend adding in NO extra water.

WOW!  My family loved these! Only couple small changes, made homemade black beans instead of kidney beans. Made homemade tortillas (why have I never done THAT before! with a recipe here from site). Did not put them in the oven...just filled already warm tortillas as they came off the grill.  Added avacodo and salsa.  Thanks for sharing.  I would have never tried this without all the great reviews!  Just sorry I didn't take a photo!

Made this for dinner last weekend and it turned out lovely. I thought it was kind of a pain to make, what with cooking and mashing the sweet potatoes and mashing the beans and all. They had a nice flavor though, spices were a nice mix with the sweetness of the potatoes. HOWEVER - the recipe states it makes 12 servings?? I halved the recipe and made BIG burritos, and it still made 10!! Another reviewer stated that they freeze well, I hope thats true, because I have 7 of them frozen. Would be a shame to waste all that time if they don't keep well in the freezer. But they were good, and VERY filling! My husband only ate two, and he has a big BIG appetite!
Changes I made:  As suggested by other reviewers, I used black beans instead of kidney beans since i didn't have any kidney beans. 
I added more cumin & chili powder, along with a bit of soul seasoning since it still tasted just a bit bland. But we like lots of spice & flavor around here!
Overall, these were very good, and if they keep well in the freezer, I will be making them again!

So I had some friends over for dinner last night and made these. In case I haven't rated them I must. They are a hit every time. Incredible. Try them. I add about 1.5-2 times the flavorings/seasonings because I like big flavor. I also make one little change in assembly. To avoid big globs of sweet potato I like to smear the sweet potato over the whole tortilla, then the beans in a strip. The beans are right in the middle and the potato looks like pinwheels. Even my guests who don't like sweet potatoes ate an uncomfortable amount of these delectable treats. These are a must try.

I couldn't help but to saute the onion and garlic in 1/2 cup Goya sofrito (freezer section) and 1/4 of a diced Cubanelle pepper, then added 1 can each of drained red and black beans nd 1/2 cup water, roughly mashing the mixture. To 4 baked, mashed sweet potatoes, I added 1/2  tsp. each salt and ground chipotle pepper. Due to unforeseen circumstances I froze both mixtures and thawed them this past weekend (worked GREAT!) For the tortillas, used our favorite Chi-Chi's brand Cafe Style enchilada-size  tortillas (a corn flour and wheat flour tortilla). I prepared 10 Burritos, veggie spraying the seam side, laying the seam side down on a baking sheet, and veggie sprayed the tops. Placed baking sheet in lower 1/3 of the oven and turned burritos 10 minutes into the baking. They were browned/crispy and delicious. My hubby and I gave them 2 thumbs up, adding more spicy condiments as we like to do.  I took leftovers to work this week and throughly enjoyed them!  This deviated from the posted recipe, but I do see that others have made their own versions from this tasty "stepping stone" of a recipe!

I really wanted to like these, and I thought that I would, being a fan of sweet potatoes.  But these were almost too sweet for me.  Maybe it's just because I am used to burritos having a spicy mexican flavor, maybe I just got a really "sweet" sweet potato, don't know, just wasn't a fan of these.  I do like the fact that they are packed with fiber and vitamins and because of that, I may just have to try it again.

This sounds a bit weird, but my husband and I just finished eating these for supper, and any doubts we may have had are gone! Because it's just the two of us eating these, I used two cans of beans (1 can of kidney and 1 can of black beans), and I used two sweet potatoes. I used the same amount of garlic and onion, but for the spices I used 2 Tbs. chili powder, 2 tsp. cumin, 3 tsp. mustard, same amount of cayenne, and 2 Tbs. soy sauce. I also cut the water down to only 1 c. We made four burritos, and have some beans left over. Really, really delicious! What a great combination of flavors!

I have been wanting to try this recipe for the past year.  Finally got around to it and boy they did NOT disappoint.  I like sweet potatoes, but have never tried them in burrito form.  I really enjoyed this dinner, dear hubby, not so much, but he ate it.  I individually froze leftovers for lunches, and they heat up great.

Followed recipe as written.  The 2 cups of water is not necessary.  It turned the beans into a watery mess.  I will make this again omitting the water.

I made this by simply mixing everything together (beans, mashed yams, seasonings).  Cumin destroys this dish.  I didn't even add the mustard.  I stopped there first time.  Second time, I tasted as I went but when I added a small amount of soy sauce, wow, it really destroyed the taste!  So I left the rest out.  It tasted better without cumin, mustard, and soy sauce.  Probably will NOT make again.

SOOO tasty! If you are debating about these you've got to try them. The texture is a bit on the "mushy" side so for those like my husband who like some "chunks" try adding rice.

I made it like the recipe except I used kidney and whole black beans and added some fresh chopped tomatoes to the bean mixture! Next time, I think I will add black olives!  Great recipe!

I was looking for a meatless dinner and had read so many reviews praising these burritos that I decided to make them.  While I like sweet potatoes and kidney beans, I don't care for them together in this recipe.  Over 1200 people raved about this dish, so it must be me and not the recipe.

I didn't particularly find these "addictive."  Matter of fact, I was tired of my burrito by the time I finished it. I love sweet potatoes and burritos but this just didn't do it for me.  I did as others suggested and used black beans instead of kidney beans.  I used all the ingredients except soy sauce (which I don't care for - too salty), used Mexican blend cheese instead of cheddar (cheddar would have probably been better), and I thought the mustard gave it a strange taste.  I wouldn't make these again but I'll admit that they were fun to try once :)

I made a few changes based on other reviews, my own tastes, and to make it slightly healthier (the calorie count on this is a bit high)...I used evoo to sautee a small onion and 4 cloves of pressed garlic.  Then I added 4 cans of black beans, and about 1 cup water (I just added a little at the time until I got the consistancy I wanted), then I added the other ingredients.  I had baked 4 sweet potatoes (not sure how many cups this was, but it's what I used), and went ahead and mixed the potatoes in with the bean mixture.  Then I spread onto whole wheat tortillas.  I omitted the cheese, and baked as directed.  These were wonderful!  My 7 yr old son loved it, and so did I.  Very filling.  I wrapped the extras in a paper towel, and popped in zip lock bags and put in the freezer for lunches!

I used 2 sweet potatoes (baked in the oven at 400 degrees for 1 hr, then peeled), 1 can of black beans, 1/4 cup of water, and eye balled the spices and made adjustments based on taste.

This is absolutely by far the best recipe I've found on this site. Delicious and a favorite among anyone I've served it to- even big meat eaters! Filling, flavorful, fun, this has it all.

Some adjustments I make: I add more cayenne and chili/mustard to the black bean mixture. Gives it a bit more zip, which I like. I whip the sweet potatoes instead of mashing them, adding a bit of cream cheese which makes it all the more delicious!

I made this recipe a long time ago using the advice to mix the bean mixture with the sweet potatoes.  I almost didn't make it again, but I had all of the ingredients on hand last night and decided to give it another try.  Delicious!  Keeping the sweet potatoes and the bean mixture separate made all the difference.

These were different but good. I really didn't see a reason to add water, so I didn't. I halved the soy sauce to cut down on sodium. Also, I just mixed the bean mixture w/ the sweet potatoes before filling.

This recipe is a new favorite in our house.  One change we did make to make things easier was to 'chop' the beans up in a food processor.  Comments to use a fork, potato mashers, etc, were unsuccessful.  But the food processor makes them more like refried beans and easier to work with.  However, the full recipe makes A LOT of food!  I can't stress that enough!  One burrito itself is so filling, and 12 is too much to bake at one time. We baked 6 and froze the other 6 in a casserole dish.  Following KEANSOR's comment to heat from frozen for 30 in 350 then 15 without foil...ours were frozen solid after half an hour.  We kept them for about 50 minutes under foil in the casserole dish, then with no foil for about another 25-30 minutes.  Perhaps it just depends on the oven, but ours definitely needed more time.

It is difficult to find recipes that satisfy my vegetarian sons and my omnivore daughter & husband. This recipe, however, was a big hit with the whole family! To save time, the baking step could be skipped and everyone could assemble their own burrito. We like to add salad greens in addition to the sour cream and salsa. Thanks for an excellent recipe!

This would be a 5 star if there was some sort of texture besides mushy.  The flavor was good and it was super easy to make.  It could use some rice, or maybe throw some tortilla strips in there or jalapeno slices...I don't know, something with a bit of crunch.

These were excellent. I made them as written except I used black beans as we prefer them. Next time I won't mash the beans as I think whole beans would be a good contrast to the texture of the mashed sweet potato. I scaled it down to 4 and had enought filling for 6 burritos - we froze two and ate some cold the next day for lunch, which was great. Served topped with homemade salsa, sour cream, cilantro, and additional cheese to taste.

Very disappointing. First of all, as other reviewers have stated, *do not* add the amount of water as written  or you'll end up with soup. Second of all, flavour just too weird -- not sure at all why some people are raving. Sorry.

These are AWESOME!  I sincerely intended to follow the recipe exactly, but I only had black beans & then I forgot the cheese while I was rolling up the burritos!  Those two things aside, everything else I kept the same & we loved the end result.  They were even better with the salsa & sour cream serving suggestion.  The flavors are delicious together!  I halved the recipe & had enough to fill 10 medium tortillas for a smaller size burrito, so we now have more of these tasty burritos individually frozen in the freezer and we're totally looking forward to that!  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

These were delicious.  I used 3 large sweet potatoes, though another reviewer suggested using canned which might not be bad if in a hurry.  I also used one can of black beans which I pulsed in the food processor and one can of fat free refried beans which was all I had and it was so good I will make it that way all the time though I might try refried black beans to save time.  I used less water, only about 1/2 cup and I would add more cayenne next time and maybe some chipotle in adobo.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Yum Yum Yum! So good!  I halved the recipe since I'm cooking for one and used whole wheat tortillas. Leftover bean mixture tastes great with rice or on chips, or even on it's own as a bean burrito.  I highly reccomend these to those trying to eat healthy but need to curb a mexican food craving.

Final product was decent and certainly very very filling. I wish I had mixed the potatos with the bean mixture before putting it into the tortilla, though. It seemed like the distribution was poor so I never got the flavors together. I also upped the red pepper so it was nice and spicy.  I suggest watching the amount of water you mix into the beans, you may not need as much as it calls for, and also you may wish to let the whole mixture simmer as you're adding spices so they can blend and the whole pot wont be as watery in the end.

Wow, these were interesting and definitely a 5 for both taste and originality!  I made a few modifications that might help other users.  I used black beans, as suggested by other users, instead of pinto.  Instead of mashing the bean/garlic/onion mix, I threw it all in a food processor and blended it for a few minutes.  Also, I used only 3/4 of the water recommended (I halved the recipe, so 3/4 cup total).  I used whole wheat tortillas and my halved recipe made 10 burritos!  I cooked all of them and 6 are currently in my freezer, waiting to be microwaved.  I didn't use cheese, but added pico de gallo and sliced avocado for sides.  They were delicious and you should try them!

These were delicious! I of course like everyone else tweaked it a bit. I sauteed some mushrooms and added those into the burrito. I layered the sweet potato(microwave them for 5 mins with some fork holes poked in the sides,it saves alot of time) black bean mixture, mushrooms, salsa, and some pineapple chili sauce I found on the international foods aisle for a little kick. I added fat free cheese on top and served with fat free sour cream. Very filling, we both ate only one burrito and were stuffed.

My family loved these.  I tossed diced s.potatoes in olive oil, sea salt and cayenne then roasted (and chose not to mash them).  I went with black beans since I always have some in the freezer.  Next time I might try some canned spicy chili beans instead or in addition too the black beans.  I used M.Jack w/Jalepeno cheese instead of the blend.    Yummy.  Thanks.

If you sub black beans, this is very similar to the Sweet Potato and Black Bean Burrito recipe by the Moosewood cookbook series.  These are fantastic.

These are amazingly delisous! I had been wanting to try them for a long time and when I finally did, I was soooo super impressed. I am always looking for new ways to make sweet potatoes since I find them much too sweet plain. I love Mexican food and since I am a vegetarian am always looking for yummy Mexican-Vegetarian options. I will definitely be making these over and over again--even my 4 year old and meat eating husband (who doesn't like sweet potatoes noramlly) absotutely loved them!! Thank you sooo much for such a great recipe.

I decided to make these tonight even though I didn't have any cheese in the house. I used one can of black beans and 2 sweet potatoes. I mashed the sweet potatoes and flavored them with some salt, oil and added a bit of their cooking liquid to help them reach the right consistancy. The beans I did exactly like the recipe except I scaled the ingredients down and I eye-balled the water - I didn't want them to be watery. I spread the beans and sweet potato on the inside of a warmed homemade flatbread/tortilla and then layered chopped onion, tomato and sliced avocado on top. Then finally added salsa and tobasco on the inside. Then I rolled this up and that's it. I didn't bake it, but it was delicious anyway. I loved the combo of the beans and sweet potatoes. I will definitely make this again - next time I'll try them with cheese although it really doesn't need it. My DH commented that the salsa was needed to combat the dryness of the beans and sweet potatoes. Thanks!

I would have given it only four stars, but with my changes it was great!  I used the same amount of sweet potatos but used black beans: one can refried and one whole.  I also used more cumin with lots of cilantro.  They were great with chopped tomatoe and bell pepper!

MMMMMM!!! I'm eating one right now and I am so tempted to heat up another one.  
I simplified the recipe a bit and used a burrito seasoning packet to season the mix instead of the mustard etc.  I also used a mix of half and half black beans and kidney beans and took the suggestions of previous reviewers and mashed the beans before adding them to the pan.  
The delicious sweet potatoes add a great dimension to the burrito!
I used whole wheat high protein tortillas and kept the skins on the sweet potatoes to make them a bit healthier. This recipe is a definate winner.

These are OK. The taste is very different, and they are better with sour cream than alone.

This was not good at all.  Very mushy, needs something to add texture.  Thankfully I served it with Restaurant Style Chicken Nachos and we at those right up.  We do like "beany" things but this didn't go over well.

Wonderful! These are the best thing I`ve tryed next to the artchoke salsa from this site. I also omitted the water,used black beans instead of kidney and opted for canned sweet potatoes. I made extra to freeze and they were great after thawing and then baking. We served these with sour cream,sliced black olives and Chalupa hot sauce. Yum. Thanks!

I'm not sure how to rate this... I followed another reviewer's suggestion and mixed a bit of brown sugar into the sweet potato.  That tasted fantastic on it's own, as did the refried beans and seasonings (I used more seasonings), but together, I didn't like it at all!  I tried it again with salt and  cayenne pepper and cumin in the potatoes instead of brown sugar, and I didn't like that either :o(

Sweet potatoes made an interesting addition texture-wise, but overall made these burritos quite bland.  I would add similar spices to both mashed potatoes and beans before combining for the final burrito product.

This was the most amazing recipe!  I didn't have soy sauce, so I used szechuan spicy stir fry sauce instead.  I omitted the cayenne.  I used canned potatoes.  I cut down alot of time by using my food processor with the black beans.  SO EASY!

Very yummy, there is something about the sweetness of the potatoes and the heartiness of the kidney bean mixture that is truly magical (and these are SUPER SUPER EASY to make).. i've made so many recipes that are difficult that don't taste good at all..FINALMENTE!!!! :-D

i made these exactly as the recipe shows.  They taste like bean burros with sweet potato added, nothing more, nothing less- rather bland, unless you add more cheyenne pepper.   It was a lot of work for something that really should be  quite simple.  Bean burros use pinto beans, you cook them until soft( this does take time), smash them up with a bunch of cheese and salt.  Or you buy a can of refried beans.  I'm more than willing to spend time making a good recipe, and honestly, once you add lettuce, sour cream, salsa , tomatoes and cheese to the top you can have nothing more than a cheese burro and it will taste great.  I ate this without the toppings and with.  Obviously with all the toppings it tasted great, just like a regular bean burro with toppings would have.  Without the toppings it tasted just like a bean burro with sweet potatoes added. I would suggest if you want to have an idea of the taste, just get a can of refried beans, some cheese and cook some sweet potatoes. Put them together and warm through.  My big problem is that this recipe took a lot of time and it really didn't need to.

This was good, I did a one change; I made it with re-fried beans and I'll say that the amount of cumin was too strong; so I would advise to cut down on that. Other than that, go for it.

Love this recipe! I am not typically a fan of any type of canned bean, but this was delicious. For a variation, I did saute some green pepper with the onion and garlic, and threw in some dashes of the dried spices as it cooked. As others have mentioned, you do not need that much water for the bean mixture. I used black beans and reserved the liquid from the can, used that plus just a bit of water. Before eating the burritos, I splashed on some hot sauce -- super yummy!

Tried this last night and it was perfect for not only the vegetarian in my life but the rest of us as well.  Usually the missing meat on our table is obvious but this dish didn't leave us wanting for it at all.  I used 1/2 kidney and half black beans and used an immersion blender before adding the mixture to the onion and garlic mixture.  I also didn't bake them, I put it all out for people to make their own.  Combined with sour cream and guacamole they were delicious.

These were delicious!  I made three changes to the recipe based on other reviewers comments.  I used 2/3 black beans and 1/3 kidney beans, I didn't add any water to the bean mixture and I used more cheese; some Mexican and some sharp cheddar.  I added all other ingredients as outlined in the original recipe.  They were very tasty and a huge hit with my husband and 13 year old daughter.  They're already asking when I'll make them again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought the balance between sweet and savory was excellent! The original recipe makes 12 large burritos so I had plenty leftover to eat on all week. I did use 2 cans of black beans and 2 cans of pinto with jalapenos instead of the kidney beans. The beans are so good by themselves that you could easily just make them as a side dish. This recipe is now a staple in my home!

I used black beans and had hot mexican chili powder on hand so I used that and skipped the cayenne.  It wasn't very spicy, but that was perfect for my kids.. they loved it!  Be sure to serve with avocado!

Really quite good.  I agree with many comments that you may want o add more cayenne pepper to bring the heat up.  The prep time posted is understated, plan on about another 45 minutes to cook the sweet potatoes.

The beans were good and the combo of the sweet potatoes in the beans were good but there was too much cumin and I thought it was terrible with cheese and a tortilla.  I took the burritos apart and turned the recipe into a vegetarian chili which was delicious.

Er Mer Gerd these are so good. I burn pasta and my cereal erupts in flames, but this recipe was so easy even I did it. My boyfriend ate like 10 because he has a fat boy living inside him. I used black beans and added way less water because I thought it was too watery. Turned out perfect after baking though. I also mashed the beans in the skillet because they were easier to mash when warm. Another thing was that I didn't make enough yams; there seems to be less when they are in their mashed form rather than their hard form. Will recommend to other people that are kitchen-.

I screwed these up due to my own mistakes. First problem was that I did not know how to prepare the mashed sweet potatoes from raw ones. second part, my fault entirely, was that I decided to lower the quantity based on one can of beans and 2 sweet potatoes. But I did not remember to reduce the amount of onion. And one whole onion was too much, spoiling the texture and flavor. They might have been good if I lowered the ratio of onion,.

I decided to sub black beans for the kidneys as well. You can go a little heavier on the chili/cumin/cayenne spices as well. I used 1/2 of the mustard and a little less soy.

I found this recipe to be way too sweet. And I love plain sweet potatoes! I think that this recipe is just missing the salt and spice making it taste a little bland. So the next night I added some cooked Spanish rice into the leftover mix and they tasted great after that. It definitely needs a little oomph. I haven't made it since.

5 for great tasting meat free meal! I loved these! For future use I will remember that the amount of beans has to be equal to or slightly greater than the sweet potato. I made some with a little more sweet potato than bean and didn't really like those...I actually prefer about 2/3 bean to 1/3 pot, but 1/2 1/2 was good too! I used purple onion and LOVED the bits or carmelized onion in there...so GOOD!!! Perfect spices for my 5 year old but if it were just me I would add some roasted peppers and up the spices a bit. DEFINATELY will make again. Great to reheat on the go!! Have some in my freezer right now =)

These are delicious!
To all skeptics out there, give these a whirl as everyone who has sampled mine have loved them.
They are great with the usual Mexican food style garnishes: sour cream,salsas, avocado,etc or by themselves. I also agree with other reviewers that they reheat well in the microwave if refrigerated or from frozen if you want to keep a "pre-made" meal on hand for days when you're short on time.

**Tip: if you really want to save time or just like to be a little lazier on occasion, you can forget about cooking the beans/spices and instead warm up a can of ranch style beans. You get the same flavor, less hassle,  and you don't even need to mash the beans before putting them in the tortillas. This is how I made my last batch and everyone loved them just as much.

I used 3 cans black beans and four sweet potatoes.  I ran out of sweet potatoes before the beans.  Used 1 tablespoon ancho chili powder in place of regular.  I added diced raw red pepper.  I topped out of the oven with sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes, green onion, cilantro.  Tasty and makes a lot.  Liked the smoky vs. sweet taste.  Think they would be great with spicy mango salsa.

I thought this tasted pretty good. It seemed like the taste got better as it cooled. I liked how the sweet potato, was more added for color or nutrition, as it couldn't really be tasted. It just tasted like a bean burrito. It even took 1 small sweet potato per serving. I decided to make the recipe, because I was baking a bunch of sweet potatoes, that I bought anyhow, when I remembered this recipe from the recipe buzz. I used the calculate button to change the servings to 2, to try it. The only change I made was using dijon mustard, because it didn't say, and cutting the chili powder in half. I also used Goya pinto beans, because that is what I had.

I made these in quesadilla format for a party, and people loved them! :) I cut down on the mustard and only used half the water with the black beans. My immersion blender made it really easy to mash it up. Will DEFINITELY make these again!

I was really looking forward to being able to use this recipe as a healthier substitute for beef tacos, as well as being on of the reviewers that though it sounded gross thought it was delicious. No such luck. Usually when I dont like a recipe that is generally rated very high and liked by most, I assume I did something wrong, but this recipe I made to A T, and we still didnt like it. Even my guys who will eat close to anything, ate just one and moved on. No one was impressed. The addition of the water seemed wrong to me, as it made the bean mixture very liquidy. Wouldnt make this again unfortunately.

No wonder this recipe has over 1,000 reviews with over 50,000 saving it.  IT'S AMAZING! (Read "BlackEye"'s suggestions on 17 Dec. '10 for GREAT tips).  I made this using homemade black beans (soak overnight, rinse, boil with onion, garlic, parsley, & 2 bay leaves.  Rinse; discard parsley and bay leaves and food-process the rest with vegetable broth to your consistency).  I also slow cooked the sweet potatoes as I think adding water to cook them would leach the rich taste out of them.  I also "veganized" it by using "Daiya" cheese (the ONLY vegan cheese I use) and making my own tortilla wraps.  It's delicious with shredded lettuce and pineapple salsa over it, although next time I think I'll use regular salsa over it because I'd like to give it more "oomph" spice-wise.  Very filling.  EXCELLENT recipe.

these are simple, but amazingly yummy! if you can just imagine the flavors, then this is definitely your recipe. i am doing a cleanse this week where i can not eat meat & this is satisfying! i halved the recipe & got 11 burritos using 'fajita' sized tortillas. i also didn't have much cheese, so only 2 made it. they taste good with or with out. i used 1 can of red kidney beans, 1 can of white kidney beans. i started slowly adding the water by the 1/2 cup after reading it was too much. i used less than a cup, but add up to your desired consistency. i also added more cayenne since i love spicy food & i am the only one eating these. the only other thing that would've made them better is if i had some pico de gallo & guacamole. i ate 2 for dinner, packed 2 for lunch & froze the rest for this week. i am anxious to try them later as some food taste better the next day after marinating in their flavor.

I was very skeptical of this recipe,  but I was proven wrong.  Delicious!  I'll use less water next time, as the beans were runnier than I would have liked.

These were very good and will make them again (especially for the vegetarians who occasionally visit) but I think they needed a little more kick, a little more onion, a little more spice.  Maybe even add a little chipotle powder and brown sugar to the sweet potatoes.  I halved the recipe and it made a LOT.

Boyfriend almost wouldn't even try these, but he did cuz there wasn't anything else I was gonna' make him.  He liked them! I like this recipe because it doesn't have any meat but still tastes hearty.  My bean mixture seemed too soupy so I added a can of refried beans. Don't know that I really needed to do that, but it didn't mess it up.  I love the idea of freezing individually!  Thanks for a great recipe!

loved them!! We had some filling left over, so we just used multi grain scoops to eat it up :)  Also, I mixed the potatos in with the bean mixture before putting them in the tortillas - oh, and I used black beans rather than kidney beans

These were a pretty decent twist on a typical bean burrito, but I wouldn't necessarily call them addicting. Easy to make and a great way to get my daughter to eat sweet potatoes. Frying them is a nice touch (albeit not necessarily a healthy one :D).

Fantastic! My husband and I love these burritos -- and my husband doesn't even normally like sweet potatoes.  He loves this recipe so much, he's sent it to some of our vegetarian friends.  Like other reviews, I used black beans instead of pinto beans.  These burritos freeze very well.

I would have never tried this recipe if not for the many good reviews.  It sounded too strange for my family, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I loved them.  All of the kiddos ate them too.  A good healthy meal.  I was going to feeze the leftovers as suggested by others, but I didn't have enough to freeze.  We gobbled them up!

No one in our home likes sweet potatos but the reviews got me to try it.  My picky eaters really liked them and so do I.  I made half the recipe and came out with 6 huge burritos and leftover filling for another 5 smaller ones.  I didn't get to the store for more tortillas for 2 days to finish them up and there was no problem with leaving the extra in a sealed container in the refrigerator.  I microwaved one for lunch for just a few minutes and there was no mushiness.  Handy for brown bag lunches.  Thank you!

I had it calculate 4 servings and it was the perfect amount for 4 large tortillas.  Excellent spice and taste!!  I am now a believer too.  I used black beans & a potato masher.  I used canned sweet potatoes. I only used 1 TBS of water based on other reviews, but I think it could have used a TBS more. I would wait to throw spices onto the onions till they are sauted because the spices make it hard to tell when the onions are done. Don't forget to turn the burritos mid-way through cooking to leave a nice brown surface.  I served with a topping of sour cream & salsa with side of rice.

Interested in this immediately..Did mostly follow the recipe but used re-fried black beans AND Red kidney beans which I mashed and combined.  I suppose one could buy pre - mashed sweet potatoes but i chose the organic route and bought, peeled, boiled, and mashed. Added diced bell pepper to onion in skillet.  Incorporated a 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese to bean mixture. Topped mix with 4 cheese Mexican shredded cheese prior to folding burrito.  Being it is a savory AND sweet dish combination, I beautified it by adding a spoonful of mango salsa on top finished off with a lovely fresh basil leaf. Offered sour cream on the side as well as salsa verde and/or hot sauce....YUMMY!!

I cut the recipe down to only one serving because I didn't want leftovers in case I didn't like it.  But I loved it - served with salsa and light sour cream, it was tasty, easy, filling, and healthy.  I plan to make more and freeze them for later, but will use less filling for each burrito, because it was huge.  I used leftover black beans instead of kidney beans, Country Dijon mustard, and low-sodium soy sauce.  Next time will use whole grain tortillas to make even healthier.

I thought they tasted good, but my husband could only taste the sweet potatoes and he isn't a fan of them...I think it was more mental than anything because i reduced the sweet potato a bit so he would eat them.

I made this for the first time a couple of years ago looking for something different for my vegetarian lifestyle. My family requests this recipe often and love them (even without meat)! I have made several variations, but we prefer to use pinto beans seasoned with garlic, onions, chili powder, and cumin. I add cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger to the mashed sweet potatoes. The sweetness compliments the heat and garlic flavor in the beans. Mmmmmmm! Thank you for sharing!

I forgot to read the whole recipe and I was sooo excited to try these that I cooked the sweet potatoes, mashed them up ( I left the skins on as well) and add the rest of the ingreds, I put the beans in whole. I also used black beans instead of the  kidney beans, OOPPSS, but it only gave this dish even better texture!  This was really yummy! My 19 yo DD liked it and I even took one of them to Curves so the Lady that works there could have one too. She took one bite and declared it Delicious!  Thank you Karena, another successful Meatless Monday!

These were just OK. I wasn't a fan of the sweet potatoes in my burrito. I think I will stick to my regular bean and rice burritos.

Ok, whoever named this recipe is SO not kidding - these are addictive! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly except I followed the advice of another reviewer and added the spices to the onions and garlic. Then I added the beans and water, then the mustard and soy sauce (which I thought was really weird but you can't taste the individual flavors of these ingredients). Oh I can't wait to eat these again!

These were absolutely wonderful! I did change the recipe a bit, but even my husband (who is not into spicy food) loved them. I used black beans instead of kidney beans (I rinse them to get rid of extra salt). My husband's had cheese while mine had jalapenos. I would think adding black olives to this would taste great. I also added a little fresh mango when I pureed the yams (I couldn't buy sweet potatoes, worked out well anyway) and that was very nice. I think next time I would also bring down the amount of chili powder by just a smidge. Wonderful recipe for vegetarians and very easily made vegan.

FABULOUS RECIPE!!!!! I didn't alter anything except that I used black beans, and mushed them up with the potatoes and then sauteed the entire mixture.  I palm-measured my spices, as always, and the blend of spices was great.  I probably added more mustard than called for, because we love the tang.  I ate so much mixture before it even made it into the burrito shells.  I would give it six stars if I could, what a good idea!!!

These we amazing!  I've been on Allrecipes for years, and this is the first review I've felt compelled to write.  I used black beans, and topped with salsa verde, avocado, cilantro and sour cream, and they were amazing.  I only made half the recipe, just to see how they were, but my room mate and I are going to make a bunch more and freeze them over the weekend.  I can't say enough about how good this is.  So good!

I would probably give this a 2.5.  My family didn't enjoy these and I just thought they were okay.  Nothing to write home about. Sorry.  I used black beans instead of kidney and added some corn.  I think those things improved the recipe.

These are delicious & nutritious!   BACKGROUND: When I was in Ohio visiting my cousin, after a show we went to this hole-in-the-wall burrito joint & she told me "You HAVE to try the sweet potato burritos"! I was game...and they were so yummy....so that's why I looked this recipe up.   Followed it exactly (Trader Joe's black beans instead) and L-O-V-E-D it...whole wheat tortillas too!

Delish! I had a "phew" moment after reading reviews. All I had were black beans and didn't know if they'd be any good, luckily so many reviewers used the same thing. Some people didn't finish theirs and said "Um, they're interesting..", others loved them, as did I. I'm sure I'll be making these again, next time I'll put in the soy sauce, which I omitted this time due to its sodium content. Everyone should at least try these.

I was very disappointed with this recipe!  I used dried pinto beans that I cooked and felt like I ruined them by adding all that cumin & chili powder to them (not to mention the mustard & soy sauce!) all I could taste was the cumin, even after I mixed the sweet potatoes in to see if it would mellow out the cumin.  These would be much better without the spices.  Sorry these were just not good as is.

These are amazing!  I think it helps to add in the sour cream and slices of avocado before baking the burritos.  We added a little tabasco for some heat.  A-MAAAAAZING!

Delicious- I am no stranger to combining sweet potatoes and black beans (I make a quesidilla with monteray jack cheese and green onions) so I knew my family would love this. Changes- black beans, accidentally forgot the chili powder, and started with 1/2 cup of water then eyeballed it to a good consistency which was almost 1 cup water total. I bought 2 pkgs of tortillas (16 total) and wound up making 15 burritos. I froze half as reviewers have said they reheat good.

This is one of those recipes that looked so awesome I didn't even read others suggestions first. And it is awesome but had I read further I would have done a batch with black beans instead of kidney for a more contrasting flavor to the sweet potatoes and I also think I'l start throwing in some corn or something to breakup the texture through out. However, like I said , I just went ahead as is, no changes except used up some left over green onions also, and it was delicious. Victor said, " Definitely one of my favorite meals" Plus we made it together. I made mashed sweet potatoes, He made the bean mixture [under my supervision ;) ] And the we built them assembly line style!

I think that this is a very good base recipe, something that people could add anything to and it would still taste pretty good. I made a few adaptions myself. I used vegetable stock instead of water, i used far less chili powder, and i added a big handful or fresh chopped cilantro and mixed in it before serving. Listen to reccomendations: Sour cream compliments it very well.

Surprisingly very delicious.  My meat eating husband liked it as well.  My sister came over and took a bowl home with her.  I used Kidney and Garbanzo beans because that's what I had on hand.

these were okay...maybe since I eat meat I wasn't to impressed with the flavor. Almost was like eating baby food in a burrito...But I say give it a wurl you may like how it turns out.

These are outstanding!  The recipe is great as written, but these burritos also turn out delicious when the ingredients are switched up (ex: mix in black or pinto beans with the kidney beans). I like to season the sweet potatoes with a bit of cumin, cayenne and chili powder. I often make big batches of these and freeze them--heat in the microwave for about 90 seconds on both sides.

Unbelievably good!  After sauteing the onions and garlic I put them in the blender with the kidney beans and broth.  I scaled the recipe back to 4 servings so I used one 14oz can of beans, a small onion and a big garlic clove.  You can't have too much sweet potatoe with these.  Next time I'd leave out the cayenne, but we didn't think it was overly spicy.  Nice blend of spicy/sweet- my favorite combo of flavors.

This was really good! Even my sweet potato hating boyfriend loved it. I didn't mash up the beans (used black beans) at all, & I added a little pinch of cinnamon to the sweet potatoes...then I mixed the sweet potatoes & beans together before putting them into the tortilla. Oh, also added omitted the water & added a Tbsp of lime juice!

Mmm, delicious!  Of course I modified the recipe a bit for my own tastes and they were superb!  I used canned black beans instead of kidney & I did put them in the food processor first.  For those that said there was something missing...I threw in a chopped jalapeño pepper to the bean mixture and pureed it along with the beans.

I too didn't use all the water called for and I also mixed the bean and potato mixture up together before making the burritos.  I made these into 8 huge burritos and put them in a 11x13" casserole dish and covered them in enchilada sauce and a nice layer of cheese.  I chopped up some fresh cilantro just before they were finished and sprinkled it on top.  

Even my picky kids gobbled them up and wanted more!  I'll definitely make these again!

I subbed out black beans for kidney and changed the way I prepared the burritos ever so slightly, but in the end, they came out wonderfully.  Thanks for finding a way to utilize sweet potatoes in a way that doesn't come out tasting like an overly sweet and beyond rich side dish!

Loved the flavors together, even though I wasn't expecting to! I put kidney beans into sweet potato mash and mixed it all together. It was easy, and still delicious.  You don't need to add all of the water, I think I added about 1/2 c.  I will continue to make it this way.  This does not taste like a Mexican burrito, so if you just try this without a preconceived notion of what to expect, you will be pleasantly surprised!

Delicious!  Following the suggestions of an earlier reviewer, I use black beans instead of kidney beans and vegetable broth instead of water, and I saute the spices with the onions and garlic to bring out the flavor.  I prefer corn tortillas to flour, so I make these as quesadillas instead of burritos.  To do this, I spoon on some sweet potato then some bean mixture, covering half the tortilla, sprinkle on a little low-fat shredded cheddar, and fold the tortilla over. (To keep the tortillas from ripping when I fold them, I heat them a little on each side in a non-stick skillet before adding the filling.) Then, I heat the quesadillas in the skillet on each side until brown and crisp and serve with some salsa on top.

These were really good!I got distracted when I made them and forgot the soy sauce and the cheese, but they were still excellent! I didn't find mashing the beans that difficult like some have stated, I just went at them with the potato masher and it only took a minute or two.

Wow... this was delicious!  The whole time I was cooking, I was thinking, "I don't know about this..." but it came out really, really good.  As other reviewers suggested, I browned the onions for a couple of minutes and then I added the garlic and spices for a couple of minutes.  I added the beans and mashed them a bit - not competely.  Just opened them up some. Then I added 1/2 the water.  I let it simmer for about 10 minutes.  Then I turned off the heat and added the mashed sweet potatoes (which I added syrup to) right to the beans.  I sprinkled the cheese on top, mixed it all together, and then filled the burritos.  Delicious!  Thanks for the surprisingly good recipe! ADDITIONAL NOTE:  I make these all the time now.  I always add the spices to the onions and garlic and let them saute for a minute or 2 before I add the beans and water.  I forgot to do that last night, for some reason, and I followed the recipe as written.  That is, I added the spices AFTER I added the water.  HUGE, HUGE difference.  The spices were kind of dormant.  They weren't really there.  I won't make that mistake again!

This was so delicious!! I really appreciated how much sweetness the sweet potatoes added to the dish!! The only warning I'd give though is, if you make a big batch and are planning to use it over a few days...the beans aren't as appealing and become a bit hardend. So make sure you are making the appropiate amount for the appopiate amount of people if you don't feel like wasting any food or feel like eating hardened beans. :) Only a suggestion....

This is the best burrito recipe I have ever tried.  I am not a bean eater, but since my husband is, I decided to try it out.  I did take the advice given and went with the black beans instead of the red beans.  Now I can't get enough.  I always make extra and freeze it for later.

Haha - with this and other yummy recipes I have weened my carnivorous husband off red meat.  He wants to keep this in regular circulation.  I did have a little leftover bacon in the fridge which I put in one and it was really good and is a great suitable addition for those who need meat...but he said even without was great.  I also had leftover corn which went in another and was good, too.  I will probably always put a little in cause it went well and added vitamins.  Oh, I used black beans cause that's what I had and I like them better than kidney.

These were very good. The beans were delicious--very similar to refried beans but with more flavor. I didn't use all the water called for--I just used enough to get it to a pasty texture. I used a small amount of cheddar-style goat cheese, but I think these would be great without, as well. I also used sprouted-grain tortillas, which got nice and crispy (but not hard) after baking. The beauty of this recipe is that it's open to variation--next time, I'll add green chilies and guacamole.

I have never had the pleasure of a sweet potato burrito until this one. It is truly amazing and I know I will be making this one time and time again! I am a long time vegetarian and wondering how I missed out on this delicious combination. I look forward to experimenting with the spices and adding some fresh cilantro! I just mixed together my mashed sweet potatoes and the bean mixture, then stuffed the burrito. Sweet potatoes are meant for burritos, trust me!

This recipe was strangely…DELICIOUS!!! I was a little skeptical about trying this recipe but with all the high ratings I decided to give it a try.  This definitely has a unique flavor, but it is really tasty and healthy too! I followed the directions exactly.  Next time when I make these I think I am going to follow other reviewers and use black beans.  I imagine it will taste great with them too.  These also freeze beautifully.  To re-heat I just wrapped them in a paper towel and threw it in the microwave for a couple minutes.  Thanks for a FANTASTIC recipe!!!

I have to say I was a bit disappointed, given all of the rave reviews...I thought the bean mixture was fabulous, that combination of flavors was delicious...but the sweet potatoes seemed out of place.  They actually seemed, well, too sweet!  And the amount of bean/sweet potato I ended up with didn't seem like enough to fill burrito-sized tortillas.  Also, it's pretty time-consuming.  I think this recipe would make great bean burritos, but as is it was kinda weird.

I have actually had sweet potato burritos before from a restaurant and loved them. I love the ingredients and the combination. But these were sort of...nasty. Way too much sweet potato taste. The combination was unappetizing. Family would not eat them. Threw it all out. No offense to those who liked them!!  Maybe you are vegans and more accustomed to this sort of food?

This always turns out yummy! I do a couple of small changes that work well. Instead of the water called for I use 1 can of veggie or chicken broth. I aslo add a small can of diced green chilis to the mashed sweet potato before making the burritos.

I thought these were really great. I don't know about the people who say they taste "too weird" - I don't think the flavor is that much out of the ordinary, just something a little different and healthy. I used canned pinto beans, but I may try black beans next time since they are healthier. I think these would be good with bell pepper added, or you could get funkier and add canned nopales (cactus - your friends will think you're super cool if you serve them cactus, and the canned ones will offer a bit of spice as well). DO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF WATER.

My friend and I made this at our last get-together, and it was delicious and made enough leftovers to enjoy for the next couple of days. We used whole wheat tortillas and 1 can each of black, kidney, and pinto beans (drained) because we didn't have enough of just one type of bean and didn't feel like going to the store. Also, we only used 1 cup water, 2 is just way too much. It's great to find a sweet potato recipe that doesn't taste like dessert (although those are good too!). Great topped with sour cream and salsa.

These were wonderful - my whole family loved them!  I was very skeptical, because I thought the combination of ingredients sounded weird.  They had the most delicious, unique flavor.  I used two cans of black beans and one large can of refried beans in place of the kidney beans.  I omitted the cayenne pepper and used more chili powder and cumin than called for.  I decreased the mustard to 2 teaspoons, and mixed the sweet potatoes with the bean mixture before rolling in the tortillas and baking.  Well worth the time and effort!!  Thank you so much for this very different and fabulous recipe!

I wanted to try these since I'm a big sweet potato fan.  They were okay but if I make them again I don't think I'll mash the beans as much so the burritos will have more "body".  Also I might increase the amount of beans or lessen the amount of sweet potato.  My husband took the leftovers for lunch the next day.  He said without sour cream they would have been way too sweet.  I liked the fact that they were very nutritious.

I thought these were pretty good, and have a lot of potential.  I halved the recipe and used black beans instead of kidney beans (taste preference).  I also used less water with the beans.  I found that I put too much of the sweet potato mixture on the tortillas and it was too overpowering.  Next time I would mix the potato and bean mixture together before applying to tortillas, probably in the food processor.  I also forgot to put cheese inside tortillas, so placed on top before baking, would likely have been better with the cheese directly inside.  I poured a little bit of milk over top prior to baking to add some creaminess.  Very good with sour cream.

I admit I was skeptical - mustard & soy sauce in burritos?! But I followed the recipe exactly & just LOVED the flavour of these. Definitely serve with sour cream (bit of salsa). I was hoping my husband who doesn't really like sweet potato would be won over... although he ate them, he did say they were far too sweet-potatoey for him, bummer!

I wish I had read the review first...  I added the entire 2 cups of water and ended up having to spend 30 minutes cooking the bean mixture down so it wasn't so runny.  I also left out the cayenne pepper as I was out.

Like many others, I thought this combo sounded odd, but the reviews were so great...well, it lives up to the ratings.  I think the amounts were good - the filling was perfect for the nunmber of tortillas and I liked the half and half mixture.

I used queso blanco inside the burritos and did one pan of refried black beans and one pan of refried pinto beans.  Topped both pans with enchilada sauce and served with sour cream, salsa, guac, green onions, jalapeno peppers, & crumbled queso fresco so everyone could adjust to their taste.  They were a huge hit with everyone, including my friend who doesn't like sweet potatoes.

These were great...odd combination but very tasty!  Even my meat-loving husband loved them.  I was worried about the seemingly large amount of chili powder.  It turned out really good though.  I used one can of black beans, one can of sweet potatoes and half the amount of all the other ingredients and it was great.  I did use black beans and mashed them before adding to the skillet like others suggested.  Also substitued Terriaki Sauce since I was out of soy sauce, used more cheese in each burrito than recipe said.  Will make again and again.

This recipe was delicious and wonderfully different. I used black beans instead of kidney, otherwise followed recipe exactly. I would definitely make them again. Everyone loved them except my 3-year-old, who took one bite and spit it out, but this was not surprising.

I was worried about the sweet potato/kidney bean combo.  But, it works!  I made the entire recipe, and froze the rest of them.  Defrost them in your microwave and finish them off in your toaster oven for a great 10 minute dinner!

This is a good idea, but it falls miserably short of delicious. The bean mixture was too much work for such a "yucky" outcome. If I made this again, I would use refried beans and NO mustard. I used half the mustard, and it was still way too "mustardy". The sweet potatoes were good.

I am not sure what all the fuss is about.  I thought they were odd and a little sweet.  Maybe its the fact I live in Austin and eat Mexican food all the time.  They did freeze nicely for easy lunches.

Addictive is right! I've craved these since making them. 
I found the recipe when planning a dinner with vegetarian guests. 
Now we don't need a vegetarian in attendance for an excuse to make them. 
With recipes like these, a vegetarian lifestyle doesn't seem like a compromise 
- even to a carnivore like me!

I discovered this recipe years ago and have been making these ever since! My only variation (which is tastier and easier in my opinion) is this:  I use refried black beans instead of the whole kidney beans. More flavorful, better texture, and much easier than mashing whole beans. Just use about 1/2 cup to whole cup less than the recipe calls for and less water.  I also find that Colby Jack cheese is a nice replacement for cheddar, as it melts so nicely and pairs well with the other flavors. Less oily, too. Sour cream on top is definitely delish!

The only changes I made to it was using black beans and pinto beans. I also added some butter to the sweet potatoes. My mistake as others was too much water. I used less beans since I only had the 2 cans and I used the canning juices which although I reduced it still would of been better just a tad more thick. My critique is the sweet potato and finding ways to enhance that more. I thought of cubing and roasting the potatoes instead of mashing or baking it like others had. All in all it is good and will try it again.

This has become a meatless family favorite. Quick and easy. We, too, use black beans instead of kidney beans. Very nice mix of flavors. I hesitated making this at first as well, but so pleased I did…the whole family likes this meal.

made these 3 times with variations. the 3 things that seems to matter the most 
1) a mixture of 2 types of beans,(red kidney and black for me) 
2) something about baking them makes them so much better. get a little char going. come to think of it possibly good on the grill. topped with sour cream and salsa its like a vegetarian burrito that tastes like beans and beef but better. 
3)I added more cheese per unit. nothing wrong with being healthy but we do need some calories to burn 

future experiment: needs a little more contrast in the texture. wanna say cauliflower but dont know why .. hmmm

I was a bit sceptical when I started mashing the beans (it didn't look too appetizing). After adding the potatoes and spices (I nearly doubled the amount of spices and added a pinch of cinnamon) it was already tasty. Together with the cheese they are perfect. I topped the burritos with sour cream and guacamole.

These were very good! They made a lot and were really filling. I did as some other posts suggested and sprayed the tops with just a bit of cooking spray before I baked them for a crispier texture. I will make this recipe again!

Wow! I just made these, so yummy! For some reason I had leftover bean mixture after I made all my burritos, so I just poured that on top of the burritos before adding the cheese (I did use a bit extra cheese too). The sweet potato gives it this nice sweet taste but not overpowering, just enough. I will be making this again.

A bit bland.  If I did it over I would combine the bean mixture with the sweet potato mixture in a bowl first before adding to tortilla.  I also would add green chilies.  My husband used cottage cheese in place of sour cream.

Delicious flavors! I can't resist tweaking recipes so here is what I did.... Added dry spices to onions and sautéed for one minute to intensify flavor. Roasted poblano peppers and layered between sweet potato and beans. Used gluten free tortillas and flipped halfway through baking to get both sides crisp. Served with purple cabbage and carrot slaw. Can't wait to try the leftovers stashed in the freezer!

This has become a "sometimes" go to meal for me. There's a reason there's so many positive reviews! I think it's a great idea for a burrito, tasty, and glad somebody shared their idea. It's good as is and a little avocado doesn't hurt. I will note my SO was not as big of a fan as I was.

I am trying to learn how to cook and this was one of my first true dishes from scratch. Surprised the wife with this dish when she got home from work. She said she liked them; however, I think she was trying to convince me to cook more! They were okay but I would cut way back on the cumin if I made them again. That kind of killed it for me. But that is just my preference. I also replaced the beans with Black Beans. I liked that addition.

These burritos are great! Super yummy and they keep well. I rolled them up in foil and then just pulled them from the fridge and tossed them in the oven at 425 for 30 minutes and BAM - they were done! A super easy way to have quick weeknight meals. I'll try the freezing method next time to keep them around longer. I did, however, omit the water. Thanks for the great recipe!

I just made this for dinner. The only thing different I did was use black beans instead and I just made a single burrito. I had to adjust it some to try to make just one. I had left over sweet potatoes from dinner last night so thought if try this. I LOVED it!!!! Lots of flavor and very yummy! I will make these again to freeze!

Fantastic!  Everyone loved them.  Black beans were my only major change.
I have made this three times.  Tonight I was too lazy and tired to stick them in the oven.  Just rolled them up and ate as is.  My two teens and husband enjoyed them as well.

Nothing weird at all about these! They really are delicious, and even better with homemade tortillas. I really didn't see the point of having the sweet potatoes and bean mixture separate, so I just mixed them together before filling the tortillas. These are phenomenal fried like chimichangas, topped with salsa and sour cream. Yum!

The beans are tasty, but the sweet potato is just bland (gee, I wonder why, no spices). If the beans aren't evenly distributed in a burrito, any bites of burrito that happen to contain all or mostly just sweet potato are blah.

These ARE addictive! So easy - I used canned yams & mostly followed the recipe - only adding enough water to the bean mix so it wouldn't be dry. I can't wait to get more yams to make these again - they will be eaten at least once a week here. I'm SO happy you posted this, Karena!

I made this for my meat eating male friends and all of them loved it!  A benefit of this recipe is that it gets you full fast, eating less, and still enjoying every bite.

I will try this again but will take other reviewers' suggestions (reducing liquid, adding frozen corn, 1/2 black beans, etc.)  I definitely thought the 2 cups of water was too much.  Flavor was pretty good though and I have a ton of food for the week.

I mixed the bean mixture and sweet potatoes together and added it to my browned hamburger meat that was cooked with a taco seasoning packet. It was wonderful together wrapped into flour tortillas and topped with your favorite taco toppings. Packs a little more nutrition and flavor into your tacos!

Surprisingly awesome!  Half the recipe.  This makes a ton.  I halved it and made 13 fajita wrap-sized burritos.... 2-3 each per person and we were satisfied.  Follow the other recommendations: use black beans, a potato masher to half smash the beans when they're in the pan cooking with the onion, and less water.  We actually used about 1/2 cup and tried broth for some added flavor.  This is a wonderful healthy and satisfying meal.  Perfect combo of salty, sweet, and savory!

These were addictive. I had to have two! My wife loved them also, and our picky two year old who only wants sugar filled food all the time enjoyed them. I took the advice of other reviewers and combined the sweet potato and red bean mash. That was easier and it tasted fantastic. I loaded them up with double the cheese and put olive oil on the outside of the tortillas before baking. The sweet potato I boiled, drained and mashed into the beans. I subsequently added no water to the mix. Served with guacamole, newman's own peach salsa, and sour cream spooned on top. yum! I have enough leftovers for the week too!!

Delicious and healthy. This will surely become part of our regular rotation. I topped it off with cottage cheese and salsa and next time will also be sure to add some cilantro.

Really good! and definitely will try it again! I reduced the quantity of cumin and chili powder. Also, I used black beans... I was at first a little bit doubtfull of the whole idea but it turned out really well! I was so surprised with the good combination of the sweet potatoe and the beans!

the thing just seemed weird enough to try. after reading some reviews i went for the lazy route and used canned re-fried beans. i guess that was a mistake.  it was definitely weird alright, but my father enjoyed them but then again he likes broccoli in his spaghetti. i just didn't care for it but i see how others could, i guess is what i'm saying.

Used black beans instead of kidney (only reason I gave it four stars).  It made so much bean filling that I had to freeze some of it for later.  Very tasty and a little different twist on burritos.  The savory/sweet combo was what gave it its uniqueness!

I decided to give these burritos a whirl & froze some individually for future lunches/meals.  I thought they were a nice vegetarian alternative to the traditional burrito, and were overall pretty good....but not so much addictive.  I would recommend giving them a try, but would probably not make them again myself.  Thanks for sharing.

I don't usually review recipes because I generally use them as an idea and then heavily modify. However, as a recently converted vegetarian I made this as is with only one small modification of using vegetarian refried black beans (whole foods) instead of pinto beans. I was worried because the ingredients didn't seem to "go together" in my mind, but based on reviews I gave it a try. LOVE IT!! I make a bunch and freeze some for later lunches. Even my meat eating husband likes them.

These are my husbands new favorite!  I was skeptical at first, but I did what one of the other reviewers suggested & used black beans only & these were delicious!  The spices were not overpowering at all & actually complimented the other ingredients nicely.

This recipe, despite its simplicity, is a lot of work. So it's not for the faint of heart!  It's truly worth all the effort though for two reasons. 1 - it's delicious! and 2 - it makes enough to save for the week ahead. I'm not sure why anyone had trouble mashing the beans as you warm them; I didn't find it much of an effort. I did, however, add chicken to each burrito (some baked chicken tenders which were easy to shred). The result was excellent. I ran into a bit of trouble, though, because I was unable to portion out the sweet potatoes evenly, so the last burrito had a double portion of beans in it. I also had some leftover beans that I saved in a plastic bag that I will use as a side dish some other night.
Karena - Thank you for this recipe!!

This was a very interesting recipe but very yummy. Adding the water seemed unnecessary and created the mix to be very liquid-like which was going to be impossible to use inside the burrito before it baked.  We decided to make this enchilada style and fill the tortillas and then add the rest of the bean mix on top in a baking dish.

I really liked this recipe though I did make numerous changes. The most important one is I used BUTTERNUT SQUASH instead of sweet potatoes!!  I cooked and mashed it just like a sweet potato. I am on a diet that uses Points and with the squash I don't need to count those starchy vegetable points. I also substituted curry powder for the cumin, added 4 tsp. of taco seasoning, used honey mustard, and used high fiber no fat tortilla wraps. Also I used chicken broth in place of water and mashed my kidney beans ahead with a potato masher. I also cooked the filling all together, not separate, and simmered for 15 minutes. I'll definitely make these again!

These are good.  I did add butter, salt, and pepper to the sweet potato mash.  What I like best about these is they freeze perfectly and make for a fast, easy and filling lunch/dinner for days when I'm in a hurry.

This recipe has been a family staple for years now.  It is the perfect vegetarian main dish to serve to 'meat and potatoes' family members, as I have yet to meet someone who does not like them.  I won't tell anyone what is in them until they first try them.  We usually make enough to save for another meal, as they freeze really well.  Easy to make as a vegan dish, too.  There is enough flavor in these without the cheese.

I loved the bean mixture that came out of this recipe! The mustard and soy sauce tasted wonderful in the beans! That part was delicious. However, just adding sweet potatoes made it too sweet and off-tasting. The problem I see with this recipe is that nothing is done to "jazz up" the sweet potatoes. Next time I will make them better by adding green onion and roasted bell pepper and letting the flavors infuse before I combine the two mixtures.

A vegetarian, heavy burrito. It was very, very filling with the starches. I should have QUARTERED the recipe for two people. I did use black beans instead as other reviewers suggested. I liked it — my picky husband didn't (but he hardly likes anything so don't let that stop you). It wasn't as crazy as I thought it would be with the combination of ingredients — they actually complemented quite well.

I thought the texture and tastelessness of the sweet potato was horrible next to the bean mixture. Maybe I would make again with just the bean mixture but I don't think so because this was yuck.

This is a great vegetarian alternative!  Instead of a burrito, I turned mine into an enchilada.

I only made a few modifications. 1) Replaced kidney beans with Black beans.  2) After folding tortillas, I topped with mole sauce (store bought, I'm not talented enough to master my own) then cheddar cheese.
3) Served with salsa and sour cream

I followed other reader's suggestions and added black beans instead of kidney beans and added cinnamon to the sweet potatoes. I made it vegan without cheese but I am sure its great with cheese. I had lots of leftovers so I froze them for my lunches which as of this writing are all gone. Gotta make some more!

We just didn't care for the sweet potato burritos. I felt the potatoes needed more mexican seasoning. A mexican blend cheese would have been nice as well, instead of plain cheddar. I think a chipotle/sour cream dipping sauce would have accompanied these burritos....I don't know why I didn't think of that while making this recipe. Another change I would make is use black beans or pinto beans instead of kidney.

These were great! I used kidney beans as recommended. I prepped the sweet potatoes by baking them in a 450 deg. oven for an hour, then peeling the skins off and mashing. 

I did make a few changes-I sautéed the onion and garlic with the spices first as another reviewer suggested, used dijon mustard, and replaced the soy sauce/cayenne with salt and pepper. I found that it did not need the 2c water. 

When baking the burritos, I lined the sheet with parchment paper and flipped them halfway through to get both sides crispy.

This definitely made enough for 12 burritos made out of 8" tortillas. I ate it with plain greek yogurt, diced fresh tomatoes, and lettuce on top!

There were pretty good. They ended up being kind of bland without garnishes like sour cream and tomatoes and lots of cheese. Will make again, but will def use a lot more seasoning. Great starting point! Thanks!

Just discovered this recipe and they are great! My changes : black beans instead of kidney, a little less water, olive oil place of vegetable oil, and threw in a handful of chopped cilantro! (gotta have cilantro!)  Served with a tossed green salad. Froze the leftovers in individual servings. though I don't expect them to last very long! Thanks,  Karena, for a delicious and healthy recipe!

I was a little nervous about the odd ingredients as I was putting it together, but was amazed by just how good these were!  Only change was using half kidney beans and half black beans.  Delicious!  Husband and 7 yr old loved it too.  Looking forward to using the frozen leftovers when we're in a hurry some night.

I am deeply disappointed in this recipe.  I debated for a while whether or not to make it and figured that it had to be good because of all the good reviews... but that was definitely not the case.  I found it to be bland and the texture was unappealing. My husband and son both agreed and we are generally not picky eaters. We will not be making it again.

I followed the recipe as written but had to subsitute cayenne pepper with red pepper flakes.If you like your dishes super hot/spicy try more spices.I do not so this suited me fine.My daughters boyfriend loves spicy dishes so he just sprinkled some red pepper flakes on top.I left salsa,sour cream,guacamole on the counter for everyone to get creative with their own burrito.I had fun making them and serving them.I loved the compliments I received after too!I never tasted while cooking them so the end result was a delicious surprise.I served this with tortilla chips.

These are absolutely delicious! The sweet potato perfectly balances the spicy beans. I used black beans, and per other reviews, much less water. I topped with sour cream, and left off the cheese. Tasty, good for you, and easy to make!

This is probably my very favorite recipe on Allrecipes. It's very, very good. I like making a double batch and freezing them for lunches. You can take shortcuts here and use refried beans if you want. I do but I still season them with the mustard and soy sauce. I'm making them tonight with butternut squash instead of sweet potatoes. If you are on the fence, give it a try! They are delicious!

As one reviewer said, this was better than I thought it would be. I was looking for something different to do with 1 sweet potato and what I had in the pantry. My proportions were 1 can of black beans, don't like kidney, to the 1 sweet potato and everything else was just to taste. Mashed the beans and added the potatoes to the beans before putting them in the skillet. Cooked the spices with the onion & garlic. I also used brown mustard instead of yellow. The amount gave me enough for 3 large burritos. I also used canned jalapeno (embasa brand) instead of cayenne. Interesting burrito, it did taste good but I'm not sure I will make this again. Don't know, it might grow on me.

I used black beans as suggested.  Using smaller tortilla's I was able to make a larger quantity of snack size,  I tucked in the sides before rolling them up and sprayed them with some pam before i baked them.  I thought I would have some for freezing but the entire platter got inhaled by a group of teens,  LOL  I guess that says it all.  Next time I would use a bit less sweet potato per serving.  Excellent meal or after school snack.

1000+ reviews say it all! I tweaked minimally by using a mixture of ancho and chipotle powders and vegetable broth. I also like using corn tortillas.

These were...interesting. I cut the recipe in half and ended up with WAY more beans than needed. I could taste the sweet potatoes above and beyond everything else. They weren't bad, but I'll probably never make again. A plain bean burrito tastes much better!

These burritos are fantastic!!  I followed the recipe exactly except cutting back on the spices a little since we had only about 4 cups of beans.  I love love the bean mixture and I love even more how it tastes together with sweet potatoes.  The combination is perfect!  We didn't have any sour cream so we ate it with low fat plain yogurt and it tasted great!

Such a delicous way to enjoy a burrito!! I don't make these often, but when I do they are ALWAYS a hit with everyone! I double up the cayenne pepper since I like it spicy, and I also mix the mixtures and cook them awhile together instead of the 1:1 that it tells you do do in the tortillas. Can't wait to make them again!

These are great, my kids love them and you can make two small platters and freeze half for later (they are very filling).  Only thing is I use one cup of water instead of 2, otherwise the bean mix is too runny

This recipe is dynamite! This was the first super-food recipe we tried and It made me a believer that there was healthy-organic food out there that tastes better then the restaurants. Instead of 10" Tortillas we used 8". And we cut the recipe in half, but even still it yielded almost 10 Burritos! I freeze them and eat them for lunch all week at work!

I was so excited to try this since I love Sweet Potatoes. It sound like it was going to be great but it was just okay. I will not make them again. I might have done something wrong but the taste did not pop. It taste like something was missing.

Absolutely delicious!  I will make this again and again.  The only difficult part was mashing the beans.

I thought this recipe sounded good in a very strange way and it didn't disappoint!  I changed serving size to 3, just to try a small batch first and picked some "most helpful" suggestions that appealed to me.

This recipe, as is, I give 4 stars. The water in this recipe makes the filling way to runny. Black beans are much tastier than kidney. I baked the sweet potatoes cut in half on a cookie sheet for an hour in a 400 degree oven. When they cooled, I scooped out the flesh and added them to the black beans I had mashed in the4 bowl. I added all the spices, mustard (I used dry and half the amount) and low sodium soy sauce into the potatoes and beans. I sauteed the onion and garlic in a small pan and added them to the mixture. Before folding them up, I grated just about 1oz of jalapeno jack cheese before folding them up. Definitely don not skip putting them in the oven! They come out warm and crispy. We loved these! My husband ate 4 of them!!

Wonderful, but a little salty for my taste.  I'll probably leave out the soy sauce next time.

These were very tasty.  I gave them to two teenagers (one VERY picky and very skeptical), my Mom and myself....I had to INSIST on my daughter just TRYING a bite of it because of how disgusting they look.  Everyone ate every last bite.  I gave it 4 stars because of the esthetics - I definitely could not serve this to company!  However, they will be a regular on our menu for family.  Thanks.

Well the kids ate it. And they are by far my biggest critiques.  but I did not care for the texture and the taste was a little too sweet. If I try it again it will be with cooked unsweetened pumpkin in place of the sweet potatoes.

I halfed the ingrediants- used only 2 cups of black beans and 1 cup of mashed sweet potatos. They turned out super awesome though! Going to add more sweet potato next time.

These are amazing!!  I used low sodium kidney beans & added jalapenos but otherwise stuck to the recipe... Don't skip the 12 min. baking time as that makes them just a little crunchy!  So good!

These burritos are indeed, strangely addictive. I am fairly sure nobody snuck into my house and slipped drugs into my cans o' beans; maybe the recipe's creator has discovered a new recipe for Crystal Meth by watching Breaking Bad? I will be making these again - and soon!

Awesome recipe.... I modify and use black beans, omit the soy sauce (this is an odd flavor), squeeze a half of a fresh lime into the sweet potatoes, and use a tablespoon (or 2) of hot pepper sauce rather than the cayenne.  We eat the leftovers all week for lunch...so good.  I like extra lime on the side to squeeze too.

The first time my boyfriend and I had these we thought they were just ok, then we realize that they get way better a day or two later as leftovers. I made some tonight to keep in the fridge for tomorrow, when I plan to wrap them all up and freeze for easy to-go meals. Definite keeper!

These were interesting.  Very different.  Different, but good.  My 8-year old made a funny face with her first bite and I assumed she didn't like it.  She said, "It's weird.  It tastes good, but weird."  That about sums it up.  They are very good, but very different.  Definitely a keeper.  Next time I will add less water.  I had to use a strainer to drain off some of the liquid in the bean mixture - too soupy.  I also reduced the amount of the chili powder and cumin because I was afraid it would be too much for my kids.  Next time, I'll use the full amount.  Oh - I also completely forgot to put the cheese in and they were still good!

Easy and delicious- I substituted refried beans for the kidney beans and that worked very well. I have also made this with roasted butternut squash- instead of boiling the squash, I oven roasted them for 20 minutes or so.

My husband is a serious meat eater, but I try to serve a meatless meal once per week. He thought these were ok.  The good thing about these is that they are VERY filling.  My husband typically goes back for seconds and even thirds, but one filled him up.

So amazingly good!! Instead of baking I microwaved them for 15 seconds. I will eat this until the end of time! They keep well in the freezer and are very good even as leftovers. I never thought cheddar cheese would go with sweet potatoes but it is a yummy combo. Next time I will try black beans instead of red kidney. Make these ASAP!!!

I'm still a little mixed as to whether or not this was really great or just good.  I followed other's advice and used black beans, and mashed them together with the potatoes, as I couldn't see a point in mashing separately.  While this did make a kind of gross-colored mash, I'm not one to care much about the color of my food unless I'm serving company, so it was no big deal.  I halved the recipe but found this lacking just a bit in flavor, so I wish I'd left the spices at full measure.  All in all, I was "wow this is great!" with one bite, and "hmm.. it's good, but not phenomenal" with the next, so never could make up my mind.  I think the sour cream and salsa really added that lacking flavor, I don't know that I would have cared for it a lot without the extra condiments.  Still, I'm looking forward to leftovers and I would probably make this again and play around with the spices a little more.

These were good! I couldn't imagine how it would taste but thought since it got such good reviews I'd give it a go and I'm glad I did. I only gave it 4 stars because I made changes.

Didn't use cheese, and really didn't miss (and I LOVE cheese). Use dried black beans. Made a much smaller batch, and it still made tons. Added salsa, greek yogurt, tomatoes, jalepenos and green onions on top. When I cooked the beans I just added seasoning to taste, but left out the soy sauce and cayenne. Added cilantro paste from a jar for the saltiness.

Will definitely make again!

These were so delicious!  The recipe makes quite alot and we had leftovers and they were even better the next day.  To save time the next time I make these, I will try adding the spices to canned refried beans, rather than making my own.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I wasn't sure about this recipe but they were delicious!  I used actual sweet potatoes, not yams, which is just my personal preference.  The ingredients may sound strange, but it's a must try!

These were great. I made them for my carnivore eating boyfriend and he loved them. Ate so much he was almost sick afterwards! His "I don't like sweet potatoes" daughter loved them! I used black beans and mozzarella cheese so they were only 7 points a burrito on weight watchers. Yummy!

This was so delicious!  I did not give it the full 5 stars because I modified it slightly.  I did not use any oil, but sautéed the onion and garlic in water, and I left off the cheese because I am vegan.  I used sparkpeople.com's recipe calculator to determine that one serving is 269 calories as opposed to the 505 in the original recipe. This will absolutely go on my make-again list.

My husband and I decided to eat vegetarian for a week or so, and these burritos were Meal #1.  We both really liked these, although they are not your typical mexican burritos.  First, I scaled the recipe way down for just the 2 of us (One can of beans, Two small sweet potatoes, 4 tortillas, etc.)  I used white kidney beans instead of black beans.  I also mashed the sweet potatoes prior to adding to the skillet, which I think is the easiest way to go.  Even though I went heavy with the cayenne and chili powder, next time I might add jalapenos or green chilies to the mixture for added heat.  Or maybe just use monterery jack pepper cheese.  These are easy to make so next time, I'll make more to put away in the freezer.  These are quite hearty too!  (One filled me, two filled him.)  Thanks for a fantastic, "addictive" recipe, Karena.  Oh, BTW:  He just said 4.5 star!!!

Sorry, but not a fan of these, nor were my kids or sister.  Dissappointing given all the fantastic reviews.  I made exactly as described.  Was thinking all the spices would cause the flavors to mix into something great, but the sweet potato can be distinctly tasted and does not mix well with the black bean flavor at all (and I do like sweet potatoes). The black bean mixture would have been good alone...but be making this way again any time soon.

Really good recipe! To be fair, I eye-balled all the spices, but I aimed for what was reccommended and I thought it could use a little something more. I added cilantro and some chipotle sauce and served with sour cream. The bean mix was too watery, so next time I'll use veggie broth and cut it in half. Very filling and really tasty, nice to do something a little different!

Man oh man these are good. Only made them because of the reviews and they got a thumbs up in this house. I cut the recipe in half and still lots left over. Hearty and very healthy. I served with salsa/sour cream/guacamole and veges and dip. Almost like a fun dinner. Used low fat cheese. Also was not spicey enough so used 1/2 package taco seasoning in the beans. Good goood gooood....

I love these, they are a new staple in my vegetarian household! I do make a few changes though, I cube the sweet potatoes and mix them in with the rest of the "innards" after boiling them. I also leave the beans whole and mix them in as well. I just like more consistency and less "mushiness" in my burritos.

These are wonderful.  beans & sweet potatoes are healthy and these burritos have a sweet taste with a kick.   I baked them for about 30 minutes for a crispier shell.   I tried them with kidney beans, but because I'm not a huge fan of kidney beans and STILL thought they were great, I gave them another go with 2 cans of pinto with jalapenos and 1 can of northern beans. Perfect!  I always have to try the recipe 'as is' before changing it, and I'm glad I didn't turn these down just because they sounded weird.

These were very good.  I did add some pepper jack cheese the second day and that gave it more flavor.  I didn't even miss the meat.  Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I  just love these.  I like to make a bunch and them and stick them in the freezer.  I wrap them individually in a paper towel and then a sandwich bag (I wait for them to cool a little before I do this).  They make a great quick meal and taste as good if not better reheated in the microwave.  Unfortunately, they are so good that no matter how many I make, they are gone within a week!

I thought I would love these.  I took reveiwers' advice and used black beans...our family loves black beans.  But I just wasn't impressed with these.  They lacked flavor and while the ingredients would have probably been great if I had made them as tacos and added some extras like lettuce, avocado, maybe some sour cream an salsa to the "stuffing".  My husband's review was that they were "ok" but don't rush to make them again.  I really wanted to love these.

These were actually really good.  I used black beans and halfed the recipe and it still made a ton!  I used smaller low carb tortillas and mashed the black beans before adding them to the pan as other reviewers had suggested.  My husband and I are big meat eaters and are trying to go meatless one night a week.  We really enjoyed this and didn't even miss having meat.  This will definitely stay in the rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

Amazing!!! I first roasted the sweet potatoes in olive oil and a sprinkle of salt, brown sugar, and chili powder and also used black beans instead of kidney (I always have them in stock in my pantry). It was such a fun and healthy variation of the typical burrito. Will definitely make on a regular basis!

These were pretty good. I used goat cheese instead of cheddar (I think it goes better with sweet potato) and tossed in some cilantro for freshness. Next time I will add some fresh onions before I make the burritos for texture.

These were delicious, only we used 4 cans of black beans (maybe 3 1/2 next time) instead of kidney beans and we did not add all of the water (probably only 1 cup).  And next time I would add a bit more of all the spices.  4 cups cooked sweet potatoes is about 3-4 sweet potatoes (got them wet, poked them and cooked on a plate in microwave for about 10 minutes, turning once).

I used black beans as suggested by other members and they turned out fantastic. I highly recommend trying them for people who don't care for sweet potatoes as this blend of spices changes their taste. For those who like a little more kick I would add a small jalapeño pepper to the black bean mix.

I made vegan versions of these burritos tonight. A few of my friends stopped by and all agreed they were delicious. I read a few reviews and followed various pieces of advice. One was that I added the spices to the onions as I cooked them. I also added some corn, and used black beans in place of kidney beans. Mashing the blackbeans in the can made it easier. I added a few tablespoons of nutritional yeast flakes, and a little extra soy sauce and mustard. I served them with salsa and froze the rest for later! Really good, filling, and easy.

EXCELLENT!!  Beware - these are VERY filling!  I accidentally used pinto beans and used cheddar jalepeno wraps.  I also omitted the water per other reviews.  I used fresh sweet potatoes that I peeled, cut and microwaved, then mashed.  I'm not sure why so many reviewers seemed to have troubles with mashing.  Thanks, Karena, for sharing this recipe!  I will be making it again!

I halved this recipe and I really wish I hadn't. My husband tells me this is his new favorite thing that I make! I think next time I'll just mix the sweet potato mash with the bean mash instead of putting them in the tortillas separately, and I used half kidney/half black beans. Awesome veg recipe! Oh, and topping it with sour cream is a must!

I followed this recipe to the letter. I was skeptical, and for good reason. The seasonings are very overpowering. The sweet potatoe gives a subtle sweet taste and the beans (mashed in food processor) give it great flavor however, the chili powder and cumin are too much. It does not blend well. We added sour cream and that helped slightly. I will not be making these again, but if I did, I would use at least half the amount of spices. The upside is this is a great recipe for vegetarians, with slight modifications.

These were okay, but not as exciting as I had hoped.  The only change I made was to use black beans as some other reviewers suggested.  I thought that the sweetness from the sweet potatoes was a strange contrast to the saltiness of the black beans mixture.  It was fun to experiment with something different, but I don't think I'll make these again.

Absolutely delicious! Only difficulty was deciphering how many sweet potatoes will yield 4 cups. :-/

I am in LOVE with these! One tip I would offer is to mix the cheese and sweet potatoes in with the beans before placing the mixture in the tortillas. It makes prep time easier and I think it ends up tasting better. My 10 year old loves these! Serve with sour cream and taco sauce.

These are really good. I wanted to give them a try but was a little unsure about them so I had a backup dinner plan if they didn't turn out well. They were easy to make and turned out great. A few changes made just because of what I had on hand.... I didn't have an onion so I used dry onion flakes, no chili powder so I used a little extra cumin and used Italian cheese blend mix. Will defiantly be making these again.

Yowza!!! A #1 hit in my house and the ONLY thing I altered was to use a vegan substitute for cheddar cheese. ADDICTIVE is right! And they freeze so well! THANK you for putting THIS where I can find it!

Really liked this as a chip topping, but in burrito was a little too sweet for my liking.  But loved the fact that it was rather good for us.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong or what, because based on the reviews, I expected these to be more amazing.  They were okay, but not something my family will probably ask for again.

This is a delicious recipe, even with the odd combination of ingredients!  I used refried beans, so it was quick and easy.

I used black beans with some corn mixed in, per other reviewers.  This was an okay dish, but it really needed salsa on top to add a vinegar-y/acidic note.  If I make these again, I will add salsa inside.  I feel great after eating them, they are healthy and satisfying.  But, hubby said that unless I jazz them up, he didn't need to have them again.  He usually loves anything I cook, especially meatless meals with beans.  The kids liked it at first, but then started saying it was too sweet.  I think they realized it needed an acidic high note too.

I saved this recipe a few months ago and hesitated making them because I wasn't sure how the flavors would mesh.  I too used black beans after reading another person's suggestion, and used jalapeano & cheddar wraps for some and flour tortillas for others.  Both were great!  My suggestion for this recipe is that you need to include tips on how to prepare mashed sweet potatoes for those who don't know how to.  The recipes I've used in the past are very sweet (too sweet for this) and I would have appreciated the creator's insight on how they cooked them.

I was skeptical but I really liked how it came out! Instead of kidney beans I used pinto because they're not only my favorite bean but the bean typically used for refried beans so it made these burritos more like Mexican food. Also, I didn't have prepared mustard and left that out and it still was full of flavor.

This tasted good, but really seemed like a great option for vegetarian burritos.  You know... like a vegan would say, "This is an awesome recipe". But an average omnivorous person would say, "It's okay, but I wouldn't make it again."  If I'm cooking for vegetarian guests, there's better options out there.  (e.g. quinoa with black beans)

AWESOME! I am trying to add vegetarian options to my family's rotation of weekly meals. I think it's called being a "flexitarian". Seems like a good idea.

This was surprisingly good. My husband doesn't like sweet potatoes, but he took the leftovers to work and said we need to put this recipe into the rotation! A local restaurant makes sweet potato burritos with lavender and I might try using this recipe as a base.

Yet another recipe going into my recipe file! As with others, I'll be using low carb tortillas due to being diabetic. I also plan to use black beans since I love them.

Surprisingly delicious, and we're not vegetarians! I used Okinawan sweet potatoes (purple), and pinto beans and black beans instead of kidneys. I used a food processor to "mash" the cooked mixture. As others suggested, left out the water and shoyu. I, too, liked the balance of sweet and savory. I'll definitely make this again.

A new family staple.  My husband wishes I'd make this every week.  They freeze well if you wrap each in foil and then can be taken for lunch at work and reheated in the microwave.  The only change I've made after making this many times is that I substitute fat free refried beans for the kidney beans and use one can of black beans (unmashed).  It just saves so much time since I don't have a large food processor any more and I really can't tell any difference in the taste and I'm all about the easy time saving shortcuts.  Try this one. . . you won't be sorry!

These were really good and you can make little changes to suit your taste.  I'm not a kidney bean fan, so I used pinto beans.  Black beans or small red Colorado beans would also be good.  Next time I'll add a minced jalepeno to the onion since I like things spicy!  I had a little trouble rolling these up because I had so much filling, so you might get an extra tortilla or two to take care of the excess.  I served these with some mexican rice and a salad and my family was VERY happy!

These are a really great vegetarian main dish! I used 1 can of black beans & 1 can of dark red kidney beans because that's what I had on hand but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitely make them again although next time I might omit the mustard and tweak the spices a little to turn up the heat. The creamy sweet potatoes really compliment the combination of spices already so I'm not sure how much tweaking would be needed.  I would also like to try using lentils in place of the beans.  So many possibilities!

Unless I find myself one day with a huge supply of sweet potatoes and kidney beans I won't be making these again. Husband really hates these, I think they are edible... I'm definitely not addicted though. I wanted to like these but the taste is just weird. :'(

Some love this. I thought they were only ok, but they definitely are healthy! I really did not like the mushy texture, nor the chili powder. (I assume recipe meant the kind used in chili con carne, as opposed to red chile powder.) Made it taste like  pureed chili con carne. I think it would've been better with powdered chipotle (smokey!) & red chile.  I didn't see the the Intro's serving idea 'til now, because it wasn't in Ingreds. list nor in Directions. Yes, salsa & green onions would give it much-needed taste & texture. Next time I'll try this with black beans & chipotle & New Mexican red chile powder.

This recipe has become a staple in my home.  We are budget conscious, health conscious, and ecologically conscious. This fits well with all of those needs, and is very tasty!  We usually make a double batch,wrap in aluminum foil, and freeze most of them, so we can grab one any time we are hungry or toss one in the lunch sack. They take being frozen very well, almost no loss in flavor.  A few changes we make:  1) Homemade tortillas. They taste better and (for those of you that care) don't have a bunch of dough conditioners and preservatives. They are easy to make, flour and shortening.   2) Dried beans, not canned. They take longer to make, but we use them because they are less expensive, keep longer, and don't have as much salt. Plus, we can buy organically.   All in all, even when limiting produce choices to organic options, a double batch of these things costs us about $30. The ingredients are all very cheap. At 24 servings we usually end up with about 18 burritos, for $30.   They are nutritious, cheap, easy to make, and taste great. A winner!

These were a nice surprise.  I don't normally care for sweet potatoes, but the black beans were a great contrast to their sweetness.  For 8 jumbo burritos, I used 1lb dried beans and 2 medium sized sweet potatoes.  These were great for dinner and even better as leftovers (I froze half the recipe individually and brought them to work for lunch).  My husband has suggested that some jalapenos mixed in with the filling would make these taste even better.

These are really good, easy, healthy, and inexpensive. We aren't big sweet potato fans but they were still delicious! Very filling as well. I used black beans as recommended by reviewers. I made 1/3 of the recipe, which made four big burritos. I had some leftover which my friend fed to her one-year-old in the form of mini burritos. The baby loved them, too! As my husband finished his burrito he said, "These are really good!"

Delicious.  Only made three modifications:  used chicken stock instead of water (and only enough to moisten beans sufficiently); used black beans instead of pintos, as recommended by previous reviewers; and added a handful of chopped fresh cilantro to the beans.

Unique, vegetarian and simple. Made mine with homemade black beans, they were seasoned already, so  I cut down a little, adding about 2/3 to taste. Great.

I was hesitant to make these b/c the recipe calls for an interesting blend of ingredients (soy sauce and yellow mustard in a burrito??).  however, I am glad I tried it.  The bean mixture is actually VERY good.  I think I went a little heavy on the sweet potato b/c mine turned out a tad too sweet to be GREAT but they are good, especially when topped with salsa and sour cream.  I just made mine and haven't frozen or reheated any yet so I can't comment on that but if they are as easy to freeze and reheat as the other reviewers say, this is a terribly EASY make ahead meal for those times you are short on time.  I think I will try this recipe again sometime only I will go a bit easier on the sweet potatoes and heavier on the bean mixture (I had a LOT of the bean mixture left over so I'm sure I didn't use enough in the burritos.  I'll most likely top the burritos with the extra when I reheat them tomorrow.) If I could,I would have given this a 3.5 star rating b/c it is better than average but unfortunately that is not an option and I have to err on the side of 3 due to the slight over sweetness.

awesome!!! Thank you, I love these. I use scallions instead of onions. I cook dried kidney beans in the pressure cooker, then add all the ingredients together.

Used black beans instead of kidney beans.  Did not pre-warm the tortillas. After assembling them, I placed them in a 9X13 pan with extra cheese on top. Wonderful.  Whole lunch room was jealous.

I only tried this recipe because of the great reviews it received...if it were just left to the ingredients, I would've skipped over it.  It was absolutely delicious!  All of my kids and their friends loved them too.  I'll definately make these again.

I scaled the recipe for 5 servings and the proportions were actually perfect. Instead of kidney beans, I used half red kidney beans and half black beans. There wasn't any heat though (which was fine for my son), so I added some jalapenos to my own. Served with green onions and sour cream, with a side of Mexican rice.

WOW...Is all I have to say. these are amazing~~! I also used black beans and mashed them up previously before sauteing. I added 1 1/2 cups of water to the mixture in the frying pan. I dont use soya sauce. i use braggs all purpose seasoning to save on all that extra sodium.I would recommend making this recipe.it made more then 12. i got a total of 19, and happily have 16 in the freezer for future quick dinners!!

This is an unusual, but delicious recipe. I only had 1/2 the chili powder and the burritos still had plenty of flavor.  I also used whole wheat tortillas and served these with sour cream and slasa.  I'll definately make these again!

Spectacular!  Although I do admit to changing the recipe a little to suit what I had on hand.  I used curry powder instead of cumin, and used one 19oz can of kidney beans and one 19 oz can of black beans.  The sweet potato was huge, so I might have used more than the 4 cups.  I also liked the idea of corn as used in one of the reviews, so added some of that.  Mashed the sweet potatos in a pot, added the beans.  Fried the onions, garlic & spices in another pan, then added the bean/potato mixture to the pan to combine.  Great stuff - I'm looking forward to freezing the leftovers and having them for lunch.  I'll make this again with different variations and will try to follow the actual recipe as well, just to compare.

We really liked these. Was curious about the soy sauce and mustard, but they did add another layer of flavor. Halved the recipe, except for using 2 cans of black beans.  When making the burritos used twice as much of the bean mixture as sweet potato & sprayed them with cooking spray before baking as another reviewer suggested.  They were not bland at all and the right proportion of beans and potato.  Our version made 7 medium sized burritos.

I made this with a 16oz bag of black beans (cooked on stove per directions) and then  I put the beans in a food processor before mixing with the garlic/onion mixture.  These are actually quite good!  Will be making again!

These things are awesome!  My husband can't get enough of these!  He had a great idea to make them in enchiladas. So I baked them in green enchilada sauce and covered in cheese.  Served with sourcream.  That was the bomb!!!

Yum, yum, yum. I made 1/3 the recipe using 3 sweet potatoes and 1 can refried black beans in lieu of the pintos. I also subbed some chicken stock for the water to thin the beans a little. Served these with diced tomatoes, sour cream, and salsa and I LOVED the flavor combinations. I'll make these for my veggie friends.

DEFINITELY mix the beans and sweet potatoes together. It makes all the difference. Also, Please add some salt. The recipe doesn't call for any.  I added 1/2 teaspoon and it was perfect.  Without it, it was perfectly bland, for all the people who said it was missing something that they couldn't put their finger on, it was SALT, it brings out all the other flavors. Start with a 1/4 tsp, add more to your liking. I fried these up in a skillet and served with sour cream, cilantro, salsa.  With these changes it goes from a 4 star recipe to a 5 star.

We had these last night and they were good, but I added a couple of things to "kick it up a notch". As written, I would give it a 3.5 because I think it's a little bland. I added three chopped jalapenos to the onion and garlic mixture which helped. I substituted black beans for the kidney; and the sour cream added at serving is a must! I baked mine for health reasons and the tortillas were a little tough (they were whole wheat too which could contribute)but I'm sure deep frying would make them crispier. I baked my potatoes the night before and peeled and mashed when ready to assemble; I also mashed the beans in a bowl before adding them to the skillet, both which helped make it less difficult. I will try them again; all in all a nice, healthy meat-free meal.

I discovered this recipe a year ago and my husband can't get enough of it.  I have to make it once a month and they are great to freeze so he can heat them up anytime.  Friends and family all ask for the recipe.  So glad I found it.  I leave out the onion and the dish still tastes great. I've used sweet potatoes and then yams, sweet potatoes are the best if you can find them.

Came out pretty darn good. I wouldn't give it 5 stars but I'd make again. Makes quite a few burritos, we had it for 2 days and still had some left over. Good for freezing. Didn't use all the liquid (and substituted veggie broth for the water) as we like our consistency a little thicker.

This was really satisfying and tasty. It is very starchy between the sweet potatoes and the beans, but really delicious with a little hot sauce on top. A nice combination of flavors -- mild and sweet with the addition of spicy hot sauce.

yum yum yum yum yum! It took me a long time to try this recipe but I'm glad I finally did.  I used whole wheat tortillas, sauteed the spices a bit, didn't mash the beans incredibly- but I think it was pretty true to the recipe :) Topped with sour cream, cilantro, and scallions. Will be making again!

Followed the recipe exactly. The amount of water sounded like too much to me. I wish I would have gone with my instincts, and added only half (or even less)it was so liquidy that I boiled down some, and then added the sweet potatoes to thicken it up. I actually preferred the TASTE better, mixed up. I used 1/3 cup mix to each 10" burrito and it made 24! I think more filling would have been too much for our preferences, but maybe my tortillas were smaller than other burrito tortillas? They had a terrific flavor and I will make again. But, I would prefer adding at least some black beans, like others have used. Oh... and for those of you (like me) that have never cooked sweet potatoes before... (thanks to "bellydancer" for the info) wrap individually in foil and bake @375 for about 45 minutes for med- large ones and PUT A PAN UNDERNEATH BECAUSE THEY LEAK A SWEET STICKY JUICE (makes sense..."sweet" potatoes) THAT IS A REAL MESS TO CLEAN OFF YOUR OVEN.

These are a staple in my house - I make a big batch and freeze them.  I use WW tortillas and low sodium soy sauce.  I have made them both with black and kidney beans, and I prefer the kidney beans.  These are healthy and delicious!

I debated for a long time before trying these.  They sounded wierd to me but all of the great reviews finaly convinced me to try them.  They weren't horrible...but they weren't good either.  I used whole wheat tortillas and black beans.  Maybe my family isn't a fan of sweet potatoes but my 3 year old daughter would not eat hers.

My review isn't really a reflection of the actual recipe but I think this recipe allows for the ideas to flow!
I didn't have any kidney beans or sweet potatoes, so I used a mix of baked beans and chickpeas and mashed potatoes.
I had not soy sauce, so left that out as well.  Anyhow, I made homemade tortillas, and a roasted corn, tomatoe and onion salsa to serve the burritos with.  A big dollop of sour cream, and you have one of the most CHEAPEST meals ever!  With my homemade tortillas, and homegrown corn and tomatoes, this cost $3 for the WHOLE meal!!  Very good too

Holy cow, these are great!  I have 3 small children so I used canned sweet potatoes (I rinsed them off in a colander) to save time.  I also changed the beans to black like many others suggested.  My burritos were pretty big and my husband ate 3 and he kept saying, "These are sooo good!"  There is something really good about the combination of flavors!  Thanks!!!

I was leery as well to try out this recipe, but glad I did. I'll probably add more cayenne next time to give it a little kick. These burritos are awesome!

Holy smokes, these rock. I topped mine with sour cream, salsa, and chopped fresh cilantro.  My carniverous husband even loved them.  Nice change of pace and great use of sweet potatoes and kidney beans.

This recipe is 5 stars...with a couple additions.  I pretty much followed the amounts of all ingredients, but did halve the amount of water.  Don't be afraid of the soy and mustard, it gives it an unusual taste, and one that goes great with the sweet potato.  I also added a little syrup to the potatoes as others suggested.  But what I think made this recipe 5 stars was adding sauteed onions and peppers (with some garlic salt, garlic powder and fajita seasoning, and serving it with avocado, sour cream and salsa.  I think the cheese and sour cream can be optional as long as you have avocado though.  I also chopped up some tomatoes but they didn't really need that.  Next time I think I will put the peppers and onions right in the burrito, and maybe just use a bigger tortilla.  Anyways, great recipe, my boyfriend and I both loved it-thanks!

Great dish - I would definitely serve this to my vegetarian friends. The spices were a great combo with the sweet potatoes. I did make minor changes - I used black beans instead of kidney beans, and cut back on the water (like other users suggested), and I thought those were great changes. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were interesting.  I added the cinnamon to the sweet potatoes and I don't know if I'd do that again if I made these again.  And I think I dirtied every dish I own making these for some reason.

I really loved this--the bean mixture really complemented the sweetness of the potatoes.  I used black beans, put the cheese inside the burrito, then wrapped each burrito in foil.  This way, I just popped one in the oven whenever I wanted one.  Serve with sour cream and salsa, too!

Great using taco seasoning and a little added chili pepper as well.  Being a grad student, I don't have a lot of time so on Sundays I make up a bunch and store them in the freezer for a lunch during the week.  Delicious!

Wow, these are unusual but pretty good.I used black beans and found that they freeze really well. Wrap them up individually in pieces of paper towel and freeze them in a plastic bag. Put one in the microwave, still in the paper towel, for about 2 minutes and enjoy! I find they taste better after being frozen, which is odd, but hey it makes a nice quick lunch.

Delicious! As per other reviewers, we used half kidney beans and half black beans; other than that, I made the recipe exactly as posted, and it turned out perfectly. The combination of these two flavours is divine! We'll be making these again, for sure. We ate a ton of them today, and we've frozen the rest.

This recipe was very good. I liked the level of spice and the mustard was a nice touch. I used black beans as was suggested in another review. I cooked the beans myself instead of using canned and used the broth from that instead of water when frying the beans. These are great for my student budget.

I made this recipe for the second time tonight and we just love it!  The only change I make is to cut the recipe in half (it makes 8 burrito's if you do this) and I use black beans instead of kidney beans.  The end result is delicious and full of fibre; a keeper for sure!!

I made these tonight. I used two sweet potatoes and a can of black beans. This made 6 burritos with some of each mixture left over, which my boyfriend will eat as a meal itself. I also omitted the water, because I didn't want the bean mixture to be too runny and messy. I added mushrooms because I had some left over. I forgot the cheese on the inside, so I put it on top and popped it back in the oven (after I turned it off). I dipped the burritos in sour cream, and I loved the mixture of hot and cold, sweet and spicy.

not that this really needs another review, but I loved these! I halved the recipe and it still made more than 6 burritos. I used half the water called for and that was more than enough.

Very good, especially with some modifications.  I sliced the sweet potatoes instead of mashing them so as to avoid the baby food feel.  I cut down on both the beans and potatoes and instead added peppers, cilantro, green onions, olives, and tomatoes before placing it all in the oven for around 5 minutes.

I decided to go with what some of the other reviews said, and used BLACK beans instead of kidney.  I think that it was FOR SURE the right thing to do.  
Add more cayenne if you like it spicier.
 I put sour cream, chopped green onions and cilantro on the side for other to use as they pleased..oh yes, and also some fresh salsa..MMM..KEEPER! Thanks :)

I've made this many times and I think it's my favorite recipe I've found on this site.  So different and so delicious.  It'll surprise you.  I usually sub half the kidney beans with chili beans.

Great. Sticks to your ribs kind of food. Don't wrap until ready to eat and use the microwave instead of the oven. The oven makes the tortila too hard & crunchy

I ran out of tortillas, so I used pita bread instead, and spread the bean and sweet potato mixture over the top and ate it like a tostada.  I actually prefer the pita over the tortilla!

Tasty and healthy. The burritos were liked by all who ate them. In addition to the sweet potatoes and beans, I cooked brown rice and added a couple of tablespoons for some added texture. I agree with some reviewers that the sweet potatoes seem a bit bland. The recipe doesn't specify how to get "mashed sweet potatoes" so the first time I boiled them, mashed them, and used them plain. The second time I baked them, scooped out the flesh, mixed it with a little milk, lime juice, cumin, and fresh cilantro- a better result in my opinion.  Served with pico de gallo and guacamole. Best of all, 12 burritos was too many, so I put the extra, unbaked ones in the freezer. Cook them in the microwave for a minute or two and then bake as usual and they taste just as good as  the freshly made.

This was a great recipe. My husband really liked it. I added quite a bit of cayenne as my husband likes his food very spicy...Also I used whole wheat tortillas and L/F cheese...Thanks for a great recipe!

YUM!! This recipe is the BUSINESS. My family loved them! It goes without saying that those who will love this best are those who enjoy sweet potatoes and burritos. It definitely sounds unusual and may seem too weird until you try them. We want more! Great to freeze as noted by others, quick and easy to reheat. Nice to have non-meat alternative that is filling and pleases my husband.

I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out because some of the ingredients were a bit odd, but these were so good!  I halved the recipe and will be freezing them for lunches.  Next time the only thing I will change is to make them less spicey.

I used black beans instead of kidney.  Also, I opted for a more traditional flavor & used cilantro instead of mustard & soy sauce.  These were really good & easy to make.  Thanks for this recipe.

Man, these were delicious! I don't even like beans and this tasted so good. The sweet potatoes and kidney beans are a strange combination, but together they make a unique flavor that's truly addicting!

i scaled these down to 4 servings; i also omitted the onion since i can't eat the darn things. i was soooo interested in how these came out, since this particular recipe seems so contraversial! so let me add to some of the caution -- the flavor here really is unique, a very odd balance between the sweet potato and the mustard/soy sauce/bean mix. mostly i think that if the mustard was scaled back even more, as well as the soy sauce, the flavors might work a bit better together, as they'd be more subtle. i personally liked it, but i know there's no way my family would. i also added very little water, as suggested, and i more smooshed than mashed to give it a good chunky consistency and maintain distinctness of the flavors. if you want something unusual, you should at least try these. like i said, i liked them, but i'll never make them again -- mostly because the family wouldn't approve of the flavor, and because it's just too much work for something i'll probably never crave. still, ingenuity counts for something - so 4 stars feels right.

Very good recipe. Even my husband, who isn't a big fan of sweet potatoes, went for seconds.  I read the comments before making and decided to go with black beans.  I'm glad I did.  The beans alone are something I would make again, for various mexican dishes. Much better than refried beans. 
I didn't add any water at all to the bean mixture. The brand I bought had a thicker liquid that didn't drain completely. What little was left in the can was all I thought it needed in the pot, even one cup of water would have made it too soupy.  So, keep that in mind when cooking.  Add a little bit of water at a time and see how it goes from there.

I enjoyed this recipe, my family said it was so-so. I think the key to this recipe is that you have to be a sweet potato fan to begin with. I enjoyed the surprise sweetness in the background of every bite. I read all the reviews before attempting this and made some modificatons as suggested by other reviewers. I will make this again for myself and freeze the leftovers for quick lunches.

I scaled this down to serve four ( got six overstuffed burritos) for the bean mix I only used half of the beans and estimated the spices and used vegetarian cheese. All in all I would say it was a nice change of pace but I don't know if I would consider them addictting. Definitely needs to served with sour cream otherwise too sweet.

Very yummy recipe!  The only addition I would make is to chop up a chipotle pepper or two (the kind canned in adobo sauce) and add to the sweet potato mixture prior to assembly.  Adds a nice kick!  We eat mashed sweet potatos like this all the time as a side dish, so it seemed a natural match for burritos.  Add some of the adobo sauce too!

I wasn't totally smitten with this recipe, but my boyfriend loved it, so it gets a four star average.  I normally love cumin, but it just didn't work for me in this.  I will attempt to make this again, but will cut back the cumin and omit mustard (I hate mustard) and add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to complement the sweetness of the potatoes a little more because that was the prominent flavor.  I also thought that one small onion was too much for me, so I’ll cut way back on that as well.  I mashed the beans and potatoes together and I loved that flavor before I added most of the spices.  I also added some sautéed spinach to the mixture.  I think that this recipe will stay in my menu rotation, but I will make some changes until it suits my tastes.  It’s a great idea though.  Sweet potatoes are one of the ‘wonder foods’, so I’m always looking for new and interesting ways to incorporate them in my diet.

This is one of my families all time favorite recipes.  It is a little time consuming so if I need to speed things up a little, I use refried beans instead of the kidney beans.  Depending on what I have on hand, I often use half kidney, half refried.  I also add taco seasoning to the bean mixture.  Add hot seasoning if you like it spicy, (we don't) this recipe is not spicy at all.  I serve with chopped tomatoes and light sour cream.  To make it a little healthier, I use low fat cheese (mexican style), and whole wheat tortillas.  I also never substitute yams as I only like sweet potatoes.  (There is a difference)  My kids love this recipe.

I cut the recipe in half, but used a little extra sweet potatoes and beans. Definitely used black beans as the flavor goes really well with sweet potatoes. I used 1/2 the amount of water but kept all the other seasonings the same. Added cilantro. I think next time I will try mixing the beans and sweet potatoes as other reviewers have mentioned. My family said to definitely make again.

These were good, but the texture of the filling was a little bit too soft - maybe I'll add some more beans next time.  Also, I think the cheese is a must - it really rounded out the flavors and made for a more satisfying burrito.  I halved the recipe and was able to make 8 burritos.

I did not care for this recipe and certainly would not call these burritos addictive.  There was something very odd about the combination of tastes of the sweet potatoes with the cumin etc. I will definitely not be making these again.

Oh yeah, I could see how these would be addictive.  Yum!  I threw in some red, green and yellow peppers with my onion and garlic, and used canned chili beans instead of kidney.  I added a little cilantro as well and ommitted the soy sauce.  Added a dollop of sour cream right inside the burrito and these were delicious!!  Very filling...

Really lovely.  You'd want to be careful though; too much sweet potato in each wrap can make them a little on the sweet side.  More bean than potato makes for a really delicious dinner... Everyone in the family loved these!  The bean part has made me swear off canned refried beans forever!

Really great! I make bean burritos all the time -- the change with this recipe is the addition of sweet potatoes. What a great idea! I did use canned refried beans instead of mashing my own, and added cilantro to the top of the folded burrito, along with a sprinkling of cheese. Sour cream & salsa a must. Excellent recipe.

My girlfriend pointed me towards this recipe. After trying it a few times it has become a staple for us. I have switched to using canned black refried beans, since I’m too lazy to smash them myself. I haven’t tried canned sweet potatoes yet, but plan on it. I added hot sauce and extra garlic to mine and serve them on whole wheat tortillas.

This recipe was the first I’ve tried at allrecipes, but now it’s the first place I turn. Thanks to all of you. It is because of your great reviews and suggestions that I find it so useful. Thanks.

This is the second time I've made these and this time I made some changes to the original recipe to gear it more toward my liking. First - I halved the recipe as the recipe makes alot of filling. I used black beans instead of the kidney beans because I prefer the taste. (The skin is not as tough and mixes better).  I mashed the beans by hand (I like the earthy texture).  And like other reviewer, I didn't add the entire amount of water.
To the sweet potatos, I added 1 TBl soy sauce, some cayenne pepper and 1/2 tsp curry powder.  Instead of the cheddar, which seemed too grainy for the mix, I topped with swiss cheese instead and melted.  I also used sour cream last time and this time added plain yogurt and some fresh chopped cilantro to the burrito.  I hope you enjoy it...this is a keeper for me.

A family favorite. I don't use as much chili powder as it becomes too strong for my son.

These were so yummy.  I can also think of a lot of ways to use the sweet potato/bean mixture -- as a dip, or perhaps baked in some sort of casserole.  I will be experimenting!

We've been making these for a while now and they always go down well. We break the beans down in a food processor before adding them to the pan, and we mix the potatoes and cheese into the bean mixture rather than layering them separately. Delicious with sour cream and guacamole.

My meat-eating husband was a little apprehensive, but ended up loving these burritos.  I followed others advice and used black beans instead of the kidney beans, but other than that left it the same.  I highly recommend these for weeknight meals because they are so quick to make.

I loved them, my teenager thought they were ok, so only four stars. There a great instant cheap lowfat freezer food. I doubled the recipie and froaze them when they came out of the oven on cookie sheets so that they wouldn't stick together. Then stored them in the resealable bags the totillas came in. Great for on the go.

A relatively quick & easy recipe--& tasty too!  I don't usually like vegetarian dishes, but this is one I've added to my "tried & true" collection.  Sweet potatoes mix with mashed kidney beans in a delectable sweet & tangy sauce.  Try it--you'll like it!

This is a wonderful recipe.  My husband and son-in-law loved it.  I had to make more within four days and also made extra to freeze this time.  The next time I'm gonna add shredded chicken.  I prefer dipping them in sour cream instead of salsa.  I also added a little sugar to the sweet potatoes.

These are great! I love the contrast of the spicy chunky beans and the sweet potatoes. My 2 year old likes these. So does my husband, and he usually dislikes sweet potatoes.

When it says addictive, it means it.  I considered making these two night in a row!!  I decreased the water, used black beans and increased the amounts of spices- very delicious!!!I loved the unusual combination of beans and sweet potatoes.

I made these even easier by using a Taco Seasoning Mix instead of all the spices listed and added a can of peeled & chopped tomatoes (didn't add any water).
They worked very well and saved time. Tasted great with loads of cheese inside and sour cream on top when served

I made these with black beans, as others have recommended and I also left out the water (used the water that came in black bean can). I didn't have any cayenne pepper, so added some tabasco for zing. Very good. I served with sour cream and salsa.

Nevermind the naysayers...this recipe is the bomb. Do heed the advice of many of the reviewers: substitute black beans and reduce water. I added chopped spinach for flavor, color, and vitamins. They were excellent. Methinks a fruit salsa might go well with these as well...
Don't be afraid to play around with spices and go ahead and dare to add the mustard. It sounds a little iffy but I hate mustard and it really added a kick.

Taste was great, but don't use as many beans as it calls for.  Use more potatoes.  Didn't use chili powder, cayenne, or cumin, but the taste was great anyways.  Use sour cream as a topping if you like.  Pampered Chef's Stoneware Bar Pan was perfect to make them on.

Addictive is an appropriate adjective for these burritos!  I added a can of drained, rinsed black beans the second time I made them, and it was a big hit!  Also, the recipe is easilly made a little zippier with the addition of more garlic and chiles!  My three-year-old loves them!

I make this almost every week. But to make it more easy, I take a can of pinto beans, grind them up in the blender, and then mix into the sweet burritos. Or just use a can of refined beans.

I deceased the recipe to 4 from 12 burritos and used canned black beans and roasted fresh sweet potato.  I served with sour cream, guacamole, chopped lettuce and tomato on the side and sprinkled shredded cheese and bottled tomatillo salsa on top. It was really good!  My meat loving Latin husband really liked them too!

Just okay. Too much sweet potato and the flavor combo for the beans didn't work for me. I had to cover them in chimichurri sauce to make them taste better.

Love, love, love this recipe. We've made these at least a dozen times  over the years and they're a hit every time. While always delicious, these burritos are in a league of their own if you can get your hands on some really good sweet potatoes. Its hit or miss for us at the grocery store. 

Our other tweaks: We  tend to use Black Beans instead of Kidney Beans. We like to mix the sweet potato and the bean mixture prior to spooning into the wraps. Also, we always serve the burritos topped with spicy mango salsa. Sooo good. 

Thanks for the recipe!

My husband turned his nose to these until he tried them.  These were delicious & will be made regularly.  Only change I made was using black beans instead of kidney.  I top these with fresh avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro, garlic pico if you will.   Also, I froze a bunch & they reheat wonderfully. Thank you for the amazing recipe.

This recipe is delicious.  I'm not a huge fan of sweet potato, but it works beautifully in this recipe.  It's delicious and I've made it several times.  I make the burritos and freeze some to pull out for a lunch or dinner at a later date.

I made a half batch with one can of black beans. I added my spices to the onion mixture for added flavor.  Used only 3/4 cup of chicken stock instead of water, and added a handful of cilantro to the mix. I also blended my sweet potatoes with my bean mixture. After the 12 minutes in the oven I added cheese to the top and put them under the broiler for 2 minutes (sprayed with cooking spray before the cheese) to crisp them up!

What fun, different burritos! I substitute black beans (personal preference) and don't mash the sweet potatoes but cube and roast them with the spices in a 450F oven. And instead of putting them in wraps I like to put the bean mixture and sweet potato cubes over rice with salsa, avocado and sour cream on top to make rice bowls. One of my favorite lunches! I make them all the time!

This hits the make-ahead lunch trifecta of healthy, cheap and tasty. I used black beans instead of kidney, mashed them prior to adding them to the pan (as a reviewer suggested) and I added more cayenne to suit my taste. Sure, you could jazz it up a little more (as many reviewers had), but as a simple and easy recipe, it's a winner!

I really like this recipe and it is very simple. I have made it with canned sweet potatoes as well. This isn't quite as good, but it makes it easy to have the supplies on hand.

I wasn't sure how well the flavors were going to work together, but they were amazing!  I used 1/2 black beans, 1/2 kidney beans and left out the water, but otherwise followed the directions as written. Served with salsa, sour cream and cilantro.  This is definitely going into the meal rotation.

These were quite good. I really liked, and almost loved them. With just a little bit of work it would be 5 stars. First of all based on reviews I decided to go with black beans rather than kidney beans. I also cheated and bought low fat refried black beans so I didn't have to mash them. Because of this I didn't add the water to the mix and I'm glad I didn't. Due to the advice of other reviewers I added the chile powder, cayenne and cumin to the onions and garlic to let them heat up. I also am not a mustard person, so the only one I had was dijon mustard. It was perhaps not the best choice, it made for a very odd smelling mixture but once everything was put together it was fine. I did have a bit more than the required sweet potatoes, but since I love those that wasn't an issue. I would totally make these again! I'll just be more careful with the mustard and I use a lot of cayenne because I love it. I served it with some guacamole and I plan to freeze leftovers.

I make these all the time! As a career woman in my mid-twenties, it's super-easy just to eat out all the time. I make a double batch and keep them in my freezer. I don't think I put as much filling in mine(and probably use smaller tortillas)because I end up with around 20 in a single batch. I make and cool the filling(I just mix it all together instead of layering)and make half in whole wheat tortillas and half in white(that's what my boyfriend likes) and keep them in the freezer so we never have an excuse to not eat healthy. :)

These were fantastic! Two things a cook must be aware of though... First, unless you want a really mushy burrito, omit the 2 cups of water. I made the recipe with no additional water and it turned out perfectly. Second, they improve with age. The first one that came fresh out of the oven was unimpressive and I wondered why I went through so much trouble. But the second one, re-heated after sitting in the fridge for 12 hours, was amazing! I made half the recipe and had plenty leftover to freeze, and the other reviewers are right, they freeze very well. I plan on making this recipe again. Frequently.

Edit: I made the entire recipe and it got me 19 large burritos. I'm not sure how the author of the recipe managed to fit that much filling into 12 burritos.  Still delicious, just be aware this is a huge recipe and you'll probably need extra tortillas.

Fabulous dish. Changes: I really don't understand the dry mustard.  It took me an hour to get that flavor out of the dish. Used corn tortillas and made it into a casserole   UNBELIEVEABLE!!! Black beans works great.  Would recommend this dish to anyone and everyone!

Really good! I  did what another reviewer did and just mixed the beans in with the sweet potato mixture. That way, for me, there's only one container to deal with. I also added the spices to the onion when it was almost done sauteeing and let it cook for about a minute, to bring out the flavors of the spices. I also subbed chicken broth for the water and black beans for the kidney (seems more Mexican). I look forward to making it a meal with the fixings as I only sampled out of the pot (couldn't wait). Thanks for the nice recipe, Karena!

Husband and I are doing the 10 day DANIEL diet and was led to this recipe as a suggestion for a meal using WHOLE GRAIN TORTILLAS and no cheese for the sake of the diet. First seeing the strange sweet potatoes with beans concoction made me nervous that this would be one of those 'just tolerate each bite' meals. Especially without cheese! But I was shocked that each bite was quite enjoyable so long as it contained equal amounts of both the sweet potatoes and bean mix. And then I wondered what some spring mix lettuce and tomato would do and threw some on my second burrito. OMG, it was FABULOUS! Wish I'd have thought of it from the start. They were so perfect as is that there was zero longing for cheese or even meat! Like I said, I'm shocked. These will be on our regular menu from now on!

These were surprisingly outstanding. My husband was fasting from sugar and meat while I found this. He lived off these, happily. I was very hesitant about the ingredients working together. I would have never thought to put them together, but they are very happy together. I only had one can of kidney beans and one garbanzo. I blended the chick peas before I added them to the mashed kidneys and it turned out wonderful. We can't normally can't eat burritos or quesadillas without sour cream and salsa but there was no need for anything extra. I made a bunch of them at once and wrapped them in plastic, then aluminum so he could grab 'n go. These were great and I'm making them again tonight.

Used refried beans, just easier, and changed chili powder to Chipotle chile powder.  gave it a richness in flavor straight chili powder doesn't have.  Stuck burrito in microwave for 40 sec rather than oven.  YUMMY

These are really great.  I did follow the suggestions by Black Eye and omitted the water and added shriracha and sweet chili sauces--excellent.  (I did use drained, canned black beans for expedience...)  Also, I don't heat them in the regular oven.  Don't want to dry them out, So I just wrap what I'm serving right away in damp paper towels and microwave for 1-2 minutes, add a dollop of plain Greek yogurt topped with a bit of salsa fresca and--yum!  Since there's just the two of us, I take the rest (don't bother heating), wrap each one in a fold over sandwich bag and put them all in a gallon size freezer bag. These freeze and heat up beautifully in the microwave.

These couldn't be more delicious. I used canned black beans and smashed them beforehand with a potato masher. Then, I added them to the onions and garlic. After I started, I realized I didn't have chili powder, so I used taco seasoning instead. I also used frozen mashed sweet potatoes from Trader Joe's. I just heated them up and assembled everything according to the directions and Voila - deliciousness!

These are a great! They are a little soggy when you skip the baking step, so if you freeze them like I do, grill them first and then freeze to reheat in the microwave.  That really helps to firm them up. What a great way to get so many healthful foods that are so delicious together! Thanks for submitting this recipe.

We were very skeptical of how these would turn out when we saw what we were mixing together, but in the end, we gave them a chance and my whole family thought they were amazing! Even my 4 year old scarfed a whole one down himself! This recipe is awesome! I will make these again.

This was pretty good! We had an abundance of sweet potatoes and it was really great to have something interesting to make with them. My changes: black beans (didn't worry about mashing to mush to keep some texture) and added kale after the onions before the beans ( also added texture and some greens!). Other than that followed it as is. I'll make this again!

So great! I used black beans per other reviewers suggestions and added them with the can liquid instead of adding water and it worked great!

I liked all of the taste separately, but not so much as a whole.  I am glad I read the suggestions from others.  2 cups of water would have been too much.  I also used refried black beans.  I think I will doctor my refried beans this way from now on because they were delicious.  The sweet potatoes are always good.  I made it as a casserole like other.  Wish now I hadn't.

Fantastic. I have been using a smoky chipotle paprika spice in place of the chili powder on occasion, and that is also excellent. I make these often.

Made this for a gathering last night and all I can say is WOW! These are so simple and absolutely delicious! Followed other reviews regarding the amount of water. All the carnivores raved and asked for the recipe so many thanks for sharing!!

This is pretty yummy. I thought it was really odd putting mustard in the smashed beans with everything else, but it was amazingly good.  One of my favorite bar foods at my local joint is the "sweet potato and goat cheese quesadilla". I easily used this recipe to recreate my fav. bar food at home.

I was so very skeptical of this! A family member is on a vegetarian diet for medical reasons for a while. I reluctantly tried one of the burritos and it was truly one of the best burritos I have ever had of any type!! I took one home to eat the next day and plan on making more on my own.

I've ended up making large batches of these about twice a month and freezing them in pyrex to take to work for lunches (they reheat well). We really liked the interesting spices on the beans combined with the sweetness of the yams. I add sour cream.

The blend of spice is perfect. I used Dijon and tamari and chill flakes. I would put less sweet potato than the bean mixture in proportion, lots of cheese, spinach and maybe some bacon in it ;). Served with some sour cream, obviously!

One of my favorite recipes ever! I add the spices when I'm cooking the onion and garlic, and I add a little extra onion.  Otherwise, I make it exactly as written. DELICIOUS!

These were certainly yummy, though eating them made me realize what I like about the "regular" meat burritos I normally eat . . .the texture!  These would have been amazing if they had contained shredded chicken, though I guess that somewhat defeats the purpose.

Either way, these were good.  Not sure if I'll make them again as is (I'll probably end up adding some sort of meat), but the flavour combination definitely works.

Prepared per directions.  Would be great with some avocado or guacamole as well.  Thinking of trying them as enchiladas too.  Awesome vegetarian selection!

We loved these! We have recently began a vegan diet so we did not add the cheese or sour cream and they were delicious!!!!!! So tasty. I had some fresh cilantro I needed to use up so I added that and it was even more wonderful. Definitely going to make some more and freeze to take to work to reheat. Amazing!

This recipe is actually really good. Somehow the combination of sweet potato and cheese and slightly spicy beans works. The burritos reheat surprisingly well, so I often make a batch and take one every day for lunch.  If you use smaller tortillas, these burritos also make good snacks. Anyway, give it a try.

This recipe was way better than I thought it was going to be.  I was looking for a vegetarian meal so I thought I would try it.  It was so good!  I will definitely make this again.  It was so fast and easy.  I used black beans instead of kidney beans as I read that in some of the reviews.  Also probably added more cheese than called for but other than that I followed the recipe.  Served it with a bit of sour cream and YUM!

Very good! I made them with black beans and smashed them prior to adding them to the onions and garlic. Also I halved the recipe and it still made eleven 8 inch burritos, though I must admit my burrito folding skills are not very good. These were very tasty! Thank you!

Upon my first bite I was slightly put off by the flavors, but as I kept eating I came to realize that they really are addicting! It tastes mostly like chili really, because of the beans and seasonings used, but still pretty tasty after that first bite!

I made this without tortillas, Almost like a layered casserole. The spices were nice, but the taste was just too weird for me. I used black beans, as suggested by other reivewers, but the sweet potato flavour was just too overpowering for me (and I love sweet potatoes).

These were straight up disgusting. Bad combination of flavors, tasteless, not even close to worth the trouble it takes to make them. Pass on this one.

A lot of preparation but truly easy. Surprised at how well the seasonings hid the sweet potato taste. I'm considering making a fall variation to this recipe. Less chili and cayenne pepper and more pumpkin spice.

I had extra fillings left over. I'm glad I cooked some beans this week for several different recipes (yeah me for planning ahead). At the farmer's market I bought sweet potatoes but wasn't sure what I would do with them. I cubed and froze them. So this morning I cooked the sweet potatoes (used some water & used that water residue in the recipe for added vitamins. I went light on the cayanne. This is so mild I could feed it to my toddler. BUT has enough flavor that I"m very happy to recommend this recipe to others. *as the beans were finishing up, I did squeeze half a lime on them as beans*. Other than that the only other change was I added broth and sweet potatoe water instead of plain water. Since I am freezing these I took someone's advice and added cheese on the inside and did not bake these. Wrapped in foil for baking in the future. Cooking the beans yourself from dried and this is not an expensive meal at all and yielded more than 12 burritos.

This was way better than expected!  I'm on a health kick and I am terrified of eating less meat, but this burrito didn't bother any of us as far as flavor, we all loved it.  I used about 4 good sized sweet potatoes, boiled them and mashed them.  I used about 3 cups of kidney beans and added almost all of full seasoning and the beans were flavorful.  I used 1 cup of water and it seemed like too much so I strained out the water until the beans were thick.  Good stuff!

These are pretty much the best burritos ever!  I make them in large batches and freeze them individually for work.  The only thing I do different is add green peppers and extra cumin.  The recipe as written is awesome also.  Thanks for sharing this one, it's the best :)

These are so very good!  I made the recipe exactly as stated and honestly wouldn't change a thing.  I was skeptical at first but glad I took the chance on them!  I will even be referring back to this recipe for the bean half to use as a refried bean side dish to other Mexican meals.  Thanks for the recipe!

I liked it but hubby wasn't a fan.  I followed other suggestions like mashing beans ahead of time and i put the whole thing in my FP to make it more uniform.  I didn't add a lot of cheese trying to save calories but it would have been yummier with more (-:

These were delicious!  I scaled down the recipe to only make 4 burritos and wish I had made more.  The changes I made were not using chili powder and using a big tablespoon of cayenne pepper and oregano, omitting the soy sauce and mustard, and using 1 can kidney beans and 1 can pinto beans (I had leftover beans).  They were spicy and delicious.  Even my husband enjoyed them.  Next time I'll make a full batch and freeze the leftovers.  We served them with sliced tomatoes, cilantro, and sour cream.

These really are addictive! They have a little spicy kick, but not too overwhelming. This recipe made a huge batch, so I wrapped several in foil and froze them. For an easy lunch, I defrosted in the fridge overnight, wrapped in a paper towel, and microwaved on 1/2 power for 2 minutes. An easy, satisfying, on-the-go lunch!

These were pretty tasty! I was worried they were going to taste like straight sweet potatoes, but the flavor was actually quite balanced. I used half kidney beans and half black beans, and added some extra cumin. Mashing the beans is not fun, but the texture is much better when you do. I think I will freeze a couple for those nights when dinner-time sneaks up on you; they should heat up very nicely.

Surprisingly, these are a hit even with people who hate sweet potatoes! We've made these for years, after finding the recipe on a listserve. We do change a few things though - We simmer the beans for another hour because it makes it easier to mash, and add more cayenne powder to spice things up a bit. We also cook the onions down more, so they are clear but soft (I dislike the crunch of raw onions!) 

When we make these, we tend to double or triple the batch, and freeze what we are not eating that evening after cooking. Lunches are as easy as thawing in the fridge overnight, and maybe a few seconds in the microwave at work. 

The copy I have does not include soy sauce, will add some the next time we make these!

I LOVED these.  I always enjoy a dish that opens up my taste buds.  You got to experience a little bit of everything with this dish.  I am rating 5 stars - but I did make a few changes that in my opinion were necessary.  I used black beans instead of kidney beans - I put them in the food processor to mash before cooking.  I used chicken broth instead of water and I only used 1 1/4 cup of broth.  This is going on my monthly menu - it is a nice healthy meal that everyone enjoyed at my house!  Thanks for the recipe!

EXCELLENT!  Made "as is", but substituted the kidney beans for black beans! Never really have had kidney beans in mexican dishes.   Not quite sure if all of the water is needed-used 1/2 of what was called for.  Served with salsa and sour cream on the side.  Delicious!  Loved the combination of sweet and spice!  Even my 12 year old loves these and a great way to get sweet potatoes in him!  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe!
Does make quite alot, but love that I can freeze and reheat!

I used black beans. Next time I will add more spice and a little bit extra sweet potatoes. The beans were so flavorful they overtook the sweetness of the potatoes.

Had some sweet potatoes, wanted a fun recipe to try and found this. Best decision ever! I had some personal tweaks to it though. I used Cuban style black beans, no cumin(didn't have any), no soy, no mustard, only 1/4 cup water and did vegetable broth instead, added some shredded chicken, and decided to ruin the healthiness of it by frying them. Holy  these are good. I'm interested to try them unfried next time. I also didn't have sour cream or cheese, but this way, it wasn't even necessary.

These were really good.  I followed the recipe except I added the juice of one lime, which worked really well, and added a little hot sauce because I was out of cayenne. Personally, I wanted a little more crunch or texture.  I think next time I'll saute green and red peppers with the onion and maybe even add a jalapeno.  I also think I'd add cheese to the inside as well.  Then I think it could be five stars.  Thanks for the recipe!

This burrito recipe really suprised me. Who knew sweet potatoes could taste like anything but the  marshmallowy, brown-sugary goodness they are known and loved for? I used 1 Cup of water instead of 2, 2 Tbls of low-sodium soy sauce instead of 3 Tbls of the regular, and medium whole wheat tortillas. The filling was enough to fill all of the tortillas in the bag with some left over. I now have 10 burritos ready to take for lunch in my freezer. I used black beans which I mashed before adding to the potato mixture. My Mr. scowled at the concoction I was stirring up until he taste-tested the filling. He too is now a fan!

Pretty darn good! The sweet, savory, and spicy flavors all play off of each other very nicely. I used about twice the cheese the recipe called for, and I'm going to add some more cayenne and maybe some hot sauce next time. I boiled and mashed fresh sweet potatoes and added a little salt. Might add some more spices next time too.

Some of the proportions were a bit off for me; I used half the water called for in the beans and still had more than enough filling, so I made two extra burritos. 

Overall, tasty and unique but a bit time consuming to make.

with modifications this could be 5 star... It was a great starting recipe... I have now made it three times since coming across it here! My fav, is using black beans and cutting the recipe in half, or make it all and freeze the rest! so good!

I was looking for a Halloween themed/colored dinner and came across this recipe...WOW! My first truly vegetarian meal too! We did substitute black beans for kidney beans. We layered rice, potatoes & beans into the tort and were pleasantly surprised! A great healthy meal that everyone will love!

I have to say, this did not sound good to me at all, but my wife was excited about em, so we gave it a shot.  Turned out to be quite a pleasant surprise.  As others have suggested, we tried it with kidney beans first and black beans second and we prefer the black beans.  What is amazing is that you can freeze them and simply warm them up in the oven and they are 99% as good as fresh.  With guests, we suggest serving decorative design of cholula sauce on the bottom and the combination is exceptional.

These are okay, the bean mixture definitely needs to be highly seasoned to balance out the sw.potatoes and, oddly enough, the mustard is a nice touch (I used grainy). I'm not a fan of kidney beans so used canned romanos and added the chili powder and cumin while sauteeing the onions as I don't like the harsh taste of those spices mixed straight into food.

Tastes good.  Need to mix the bean mash and sweet potatoes more evenly together, before placing in tortilla.

These really are addictive! I make these every 2 months or so and double the recipe so I have a lot to freeze for quick lunches.  The only changes I make are to use fresh sweet potatoes that I boil and mash,  and I puree the beans in a food processor with the spices and water, then add them to the onions in the skillet and cook just until warm.

I'm really surprised we didn't like it more.  It was kind of bland, and I was really expecting it to wow me.  I'll read some of the custom versions and perhaps give one a try.

Delicious!  We used small flour tortillas to make more of a "snack size" burrito, froze a bunch of them wrapped in paper towels and they make a very convenient, healthy snack when we're not in the mood to cook.  Two makes a meal.  Yum!

I am really impressed with this recipe. My boyfriend was skeptical, but after he finished the first burrito he ended up having two more!

I used kidney beans and black beans. It turned out great!

My husband loves these things! It's one of the only meals he cooks. He makes enough to last us a few days because he loves them so much. The flavor is outstanding and it's an inexpensive trip to the grocery store. This is now a family favorite for us.

I really enjoyed these burritos.  Subbed black beans for the kidneys, omitted soy sauce because it sounded weird.  Only problem was the rest of the family... they are haters of anything new!  Probably best to steer away from this with picky eaters in your house!

Fantastic! Combined this recipe w/ the Moosewood Restaurant version. Kept the sweet potato mixture separate from the black bean mixture (didn't blend together) and had no problems mashing the black beans in the skillet with a potato masher. Had more than enough filling for 10 pk of 8" tortillas - the extra filling AND the burritos freeze well.

I guess I'm a Tex-Mex purist because I just couldn't do these. I ate 3/4 of the burrito, thinking my taste expectations would adjust...but, no. Sweet potatoes are awesome. Burritos are awesome. Together...not so awesome.

We thought these were very good - who would have thought to use sweet potatoes along with beans in a burrito? I, too, used black beans instead of kidney beans. I'll make this again for sure!

Addictive is right, these were really good and addictive.  Even my picky, not so adventurous 4-year-old ate the whole thing.  They were super easy and quick to make as well.

These are awesome! They are always a hit!  I've made them several times and started experimenting with ingredients. I always leave out the beans (not a huge bean fan). I've started leaving out the cheese to cut down the fat and they are still just as delicious. I've also put black beans in them and that's good too!!

Excellent! All three kiddos ate them. I am going to try frying these next time.

FYI: Mashing the beans takes awhile. Well, at least it did for me!

This was super fabulous. As many other reviewers said, half the recipe. I still managed to make 7 burritos. I also used black beans instead of the kidney beans as I felt that it would be a better match. To mash them the beans, I used an immersion blender in the pot and it worked very well. I didn't use all the water either, only about half of the amount.

Oh man....these are SO GOOD! I'm not much of a bean or sweet potato fan, so I wasn't anticipating anything great when my sister had us over for dinner. I was hooked by the first bite! These are so worth trying - even if it's "not your thing."

One of my family's favorites.  Like the others have said, black beans are tastier than kidney beans in this one, and it helps to pre-mash them.  I usually drain the beans and put them in a microwave safe bowl, microwave them for about 60 seconds, and then mash them with a fork.  I'm not a big fan of mustard, but it adds a nice flavor to the recipe.  It's great for my vegetarian friends, and you can also make it vegan if you omit the cheese and check the ingredients on the soy sauce.  They freeze pretty well, too.

YUMMY! Quick and easy to make. I varied it a little and blended the sweet potato and bean mixture together in my stand mixer, as I couldn't find my potato masher anywhere. 
I sprayed a little cooking spray on the tortillas and baked at 425 for 8 minutes, flipped and cooked for 4 more and they turned out crisp and brown. 

The left overs heated up well the next day.

I didn't have enough tortilla shells, so I froze the rest of it. I will update after I thaw it and try to use it again.

Yum!  I had a hard time managing my potato to bean ratio, but I really liked how these came out (skeptical husband gave them a 3 out of 5).  I'll try experimenting with other reviewer's suggestions to make these 5 star.

These were so good!!  We are vegetarians Monday thru Friday.  This was a big hit!  I loved them.  I used black beans and added a can of sweet corn to the mix.  I also only used about 3/4 cup of water instead of the 2 cups that the recipe called for.  I topped them with salsa.  I left the cheese out and glad that I did.  They were good without it and I do not need the extra calories I would have added.  I cannot wait to have the leftoves for lunch tomorrow.

Only change I made was used black beans instead of pintos. Baked them and then froze what we didn't eat for later; they reheat really well. These really are addictive!

This was great. I love cooking with cumin and this recipe caught my eye right away. I upped the spices a bit and didn't have kidney beans but I had cannellini on hand so I used those. They worked perfectly. I did mash the beans before adding to the pan. The burritos were great but I didn't have enough tortillas, so I used some tostada shells: warmed the potatoes and cheese on there first, then added the beans. I also added cilantro on top of mine. So good!

Used black beans (didn't mash them), per the reviews of others, added some frozen corn, and mixed the entire thing together instead of putting the beans and the sweet potatoes on separately. I made home-made flour tortillas, which really put these over the top. We didn't miss the meat at all...and that's saying something for my meat-loving man!

Want to give 3.5 but can't. Not sure what I did wrong with these, they were a bit bland for me. I did use black beans instead of kidney beans as some suggested. Maybe I'll try a spicy dipping salsa next time

Great recipe!! We use black beans instead of kidneys because we prefer them. We also mash the black beans before putting them in the pan. MUCH easier that way. They freeze beautifully! We make them often and stock the freezer for the kids.

Absolutely addictive, I have made over 200 of these over the past few years.  I prefer these to have curry instead of cumin, either way they are definately 5 star worthy! Thank you so much who ever it was that originally posted this one!

These are amazing! I made them with boxed mashed Sweet Potatoes and they were still very, very yummy! I used refried beans instead of Kidney beans because that was all I had. Delicious!

We do not eat beans so we edited it quite a bit.
 
 Start by cooking rice, letting it cool. Saute the onions and garlic then add the rice to make it like fried rice. Cook 1 can of corn, drain completely and place in large bowl. Add the chili powder, cumin, soy sauce, mustard and used a good amount of cayenne pepper. Mix completely. After the rice mixture is cooked, let it cool a bit and add to the corn. 

 Then I boiled some chicken while the sweet potatoes are boiling in another pot. I always make my sweet potatoes with a few tablespoons of butter and some maple syrup. When the chicken is done it's  shredded up then mixed in the rice mixture.

 Put the sweet potatoes on the tortilla first then the rice mixture, top it with cheese if you really want but i've had people love it with out.

I was a bit apprehensive about these burritos, but I decided to just make a small batch and try them out anyway.  I am so happy I made these! The flavors are unusual but surprisingly very tasty; definitely not a dish for picky eaters.  I followed the recipe to the letter and think it's five star worthy.  Next time I'll do as other people have suggested and try it out with black beans.  Overall, a very filling burrito that tastes a lot better than one would think. Thanks for the recipe :)

My kids and I really liked these, even my picky three year old who usually doesn't like sweet potatoes. My husband did not like them at all, however.  I used black beans instead of kidney but otherwise followed the recipe.

Definitely an interesting idea...but the end result was a little bland. Lime and cilantro helped make these edible. I'll probably try again but with A LOT of adjustments.

These are definitely different but so tasty. I left out the soy sauce and added a chipolte pepper seasoning instead. Also used a mix of jack & cheddar cheeses and black beans instead of kidney. Served with a touch of sour cream. My meat eating husband loved them...YES! I'm trying to get him to cut down his meat intake!

Very tasty! As per other reviewers, I used black beans and mashed them up before putting them with the sweet potatoes. I used canned sweet potatoes and they worked very well. I also sauteed the spices with my onion and garlic. Lastly, I used mexican cheese blend. Froze leftovers and will be eating these again! Very cheap to make and makes a lot!

I did as others advised and made extra to freeze. They were delicious the first and second time around. I was hesitant to make them at first because of the combination of sweet with the beans but couldn't have been happier that we tried them. Don't skimp out on any of the spices the combination is perfect!

It's a burrito with sweet potatoes in it, not too addicting to us. My kids dipped them in ranch, my husband and I used a lot of salsa and taco sauce. Goes to show everyone has different tastes. Sorry, but we won't make them again.

My vegetation and non vegetarians daughters LOVED these!  Great to freeze.  I think some of the reviewers were mistaking Yams for sweet potatoes.  You really need to use sweet potatoes and kidney beans. If you want to use black beans, as someone said they did,then yams would be better

I just want to say that I have been making these borritos for a couple of months now.  I always freeze them and it's so convenient.  I absolutely love these borritos.  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.

Figured I would try this since I like beans AND sweet potatoes, but have never eaten them together. I halved the recipe since 12 was too much.  I used corn tortillas instead of flour.  I thought the mixture was pretty bland and definitely needed something more to it. Maybe someday I'll experiment with this...maybe even leave the sweet potatoes cubed instead of mashing them.

If I could give this more stars, I would! This was such a unique blend of ingredients and the flavors were excellent! I did use black beans instead. I would recommend mashing the beans before mixing them with the other ingredients and don't add all the water at once, just keep adding until it forms the right constancy. These don't take long to wrap up at all, so I would add the beans and potato separately as the recipe suggest. They don't need to be mixed together, I think it would mess with the great flavors they both produce when they are divided.  I served it with some sour cream. I can't wait to have these again. They live up to their name!

In a word, Delicious.  I listened to some of the other comments and decided to use a mixture of 2/3 refried beans and 1/3 black beans instead of the kidney beans.  I also used half the amount of water when making the bean mixture.  Lastly, I doubled the amount of cheese and used a mixture of 1/2 pepper-jack and 1/2 cheddar.  They came out delicious.  In the future I'll also add in more spices to give them an extra kick.

Awesome. I split the recipe in half but would make the full batch next time and freeze half.  I used 2 cans of black beans and one can of dark kidney and not as much water as it called for.  Would make these again and again!

My boyfriend and I both enjoyed these as a change from the typical burrito.  They didn't "wow" me, but they were certainly tasty & unique.  I omitted onions & used black beans instead of kidney beans.  Also scaled down the recipe for the two of us to each eat two by using 1 can beans & 1 large sweet potato.  Divided all other ingredients by 3.

These got a bit of a lukewarm reception at our house.  Bf said they were "weird" which I sometimes think is his euphemism for "don't like".  He still ate them, though, and these are incredibly filling--usually he'd eat two burritos (at least) in one sitting but he only managed one tonight.  He also muttered about the lack of cheese--which I did put in--but I guess he wanted more.  I like this combo, and I think I'll end up eating the leftovers.  I did freeze about 8 of them--the rest I'll eat for lunches during the week.  I ended up with less sweet potato than the kidney bean filling, so I had about 4 burritos without the sweet potato.  I guess those are bfs!  I tossed in more cayenne than I intended, but it really didn't make them too spicy, for which I'm grateful, as we aren't huge spicy food fans.  All in all, I guess bf isnt' thrilled by the sweet potato, so if I make again I'd have to cut down or leave out the sweet potato (yes, I know, that makes this recipe not live up to it's title!) and add more cheese for the bf.  I do like the method of baking to crisp up, although I broiled for a couple of minutes as well to brown.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful! For large tortillas, use 2 servings of filling.

Holy cow are these ever delicious!!! And cheap! And easy! I swapped out kidney beans for black beans (personal preference) but that's the only thing I changed (for once). The seasoning sounds weird (soy sauce? mustard?) but totally makes sense in the final product. My boyfriend doesn't really like yams but he loved these! (also, divided recipe in half because 12 burritos is far too many for us two). Sweet and well-spiced!

This is a weird combination, but very tasty.  I made my own refried bean recipe.  Delish and filling. I also used whole wheat flour tortillas.

Finally tried out this recipe last night.  They were really nice and I will definitely make again. I used two cans of black beans and one can of kidney beans. I found it easy to mash the beans right in the pan (I noticed other reviewers saying they mashed before due to difficulties).  I also added the mashed potatoes to the bean mixture before putting into tortillas.  The recipe makes a large batch and I could not get all the mixture into the Old El Paso tortillas I had.  Next time I will either use much larger or more tortillas or cut the recipe in half.  Tip: easy with the cayenne I put a tad too much and they were spicy.

LOVE THEM! I am super happy because I really want to start cooking with less meat and more nutrition.  I served them to my beef&potato Dad and Uncle and they loved them too. (I didnt tell them what was in it until we were done lol) Anyhow, I am not a vegatarian and neither is anyone in my family so I suspected that i might miss the meat...NOT EVEN A LITTLE! This recipe is perfect just the way it is although I did not need to add the water to the beans.  I smothered mine with salsa and topped it with sour cream, fresh onions, and shredded lettuce (added texture) with a side of Spanish rice! Yummy! This will be a routine meal for sure! And HEALTHY! YAY! 

P.S. I have discovered that these are a little weird tasting if you just plop the potatoes and beans down and two separate piles.  They need to be smoothed out into layers for even distribution.

Very good!  My fiance and I were both very happy.  I used black beans instead of kidney beans, whole wheat tortillas,  low-fat cheddar and topped them off with salsa... delish! Can't wait to make again!

I used the recipe almost exactly, except I replaced the kidney beans with refried black beans.  I served it with Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, Trader Joe's hot chipotle salsa and roasted cauliflower.  SO delicious!  This will definitely become a go-to recipe for me.

Super tasty!  This makes a lot of beans...so keep that in mind.  Also, you may want to limit the water to make it easier to put the beans into the burrito.  So tasty, enjoy!

I followed the suggestion to use black beans.  Excellent advice. I did however add 2 tablespoons of ground coffee to the black bean mixture when it was heating to add a little robust flavor( I add ground coffee to regular re-fried beans) and it was excellent. The sweetpotato was surprisingly complementing as I'm not a big fan. I had leftovers so I froze the burritos for a quick heat and go lunch for my kids. Very good from frozen

I thought these sounded so bizarre that they must be good in a weird way...but they were mostly just weird.  I really wanted to like these, but I think the recipe would need some major adjustments to make me want to try them again.  Maybe it needs some acidity and brightness - like lime juice, maybe some cilantro??  Needs something though.

I made these for lunch today.  Even though I wouldn't call them "addictive", it WAS a wonderful additional way of getting sweet potatoes into the diet.  My husband enjoyed them and took seconds.

I pretty much made these to the letter of the recipe.  I did add the full amt of water and felt it was too much.  I simmered for a while to reduce, then got impatient and added some of the mashed sweet potato to thicken it back up.  The first time we ate these I thought they were pretty good, but lacking something.  After eating the leftovers a few days later, I changed my opinion.  These are yummy.  Next time I'll add some pureed chilies in adobo to up he spice and smokeyness.  That's just personal preference though.

These were tasty, but the recipe calls for too much water. I halved the entire recipe as there's only two of us. One cup of water was too much; the beans ended up soupy. So I ended up boiling away about half the liquid. Next time, I'll use much less water.

This was good, OK flavor, nothing stand-out-ish to me.  I don't think I would make this again, but if I did, I would definitely cut down on the amount of chili powder; the flavor of the sweet potato was really muted and overpowered by the chili powder. This recipe sounded so great to me, so perhaps I am overly disappointed as a result of having had such high hopes for this, but I think a rating of 3 stars appropriately conveys how I feel about this: average.  Thanks for the recipe though... it seemed like a unique and tasty recipe idea.

These were ... interesting. I think the soy sauce + chili powder + mustard kind of threw my taste buds for a loop.   I halved the recipe and used a mix of black beans and kidney beans because I had an open container of black beans in the fridge already. There was way too much water and I had to boil it down quite a bit to get it to an ideal consistency. The bean/sweet potato combo is certainly an intruiging one. I think I liked it? I'm still torn. I also didn't put cheese on it, I'm lactose intolerant, but I did top it with salsa and a sour-cream alternative. I think it needed the "wetness" of the salsa.   Love the concept but need to play around with this one a bit more.

These were pretty good! I used black beans as others had suggested. I'll admit I was a little leery with this...even while it was cooking I was still having 2nd thoughts...but the end result was delicious! the kids weren't too thrilled but I will make them again! :)

we didn't believe this would be good, but it really was!  the recipe makes a huge batch so we ended up making extras and refrigerating them for quick on-the-go lunches.  i added a little extra cumin and a teaspoon of ground corriander.

As a vegetarian, it's often hard to find a dish that will satisfy meat eaters.  This is it!  This is a vegetarian dinner party dream.  It's simple enough that everyone likes it, but different enough that you still get props for being a great chef.   Delicious.

I love these burritos and my meat-loving boyfriend liked them too (a very rare occurrence for a vegetarian meal)! I will say that I think the prep time should be a bit longer because I made the sweet potatoes beforehand and that took about an hour in the oven. You might think it's weird that you're adding mustard & soy sauce to the beans but it totally works.  I made my own salsa (very spicy) to go along with these and it pairs really well.  This is definitely going in my normal meal rotation...

I gave it a four to not affect it's score as I modified it, and I wanted to put my input in on the modifications. Used instant sweet potatoes, not bad, but fresh probably would have been better. I used black beans and corn instead of kidney beans. Overall, I'd give it a 3, it was just ok, fairly good even, but not great. maybe if I had made it as written it would have been better

I'm not a burrito fan but I do love sweet potatoes, so I thought I'd try these.  Glad I did, yum!  I mixed together the sweet potato and beans (I used black beans) all together and topped with a generous amount of cheddar cheese, then rolled up the burritos (I used Del Rey tortillas, which are my favorites).  I also drizzled with olive oil to add color and crispness to the tortillas when they were in the oven.  I used the recommended spice mix and that was good, added taste but wasn't overwhelming or too spicy (I don't like spice but if you do you might want to add some spice with a little more kick).

My family LOVED this recipe and I have the pickiest kid. Meow! I did alter slightly - Went with someone else's idea of mixing beans/corn as the bean mixture. Totally amazing!!! 2 cans beans/1 cup corn. Yummy! thanks for sharing.

These were wonderful and a real treat for my family.  I was suprised that the sweet potatoes didn't overwhelm the flavor.  We did punch up the spice a bit as we like food HOT!  Froze many of the burritos that were left over and we will see how they taste later.

Amazing! I loved this recipie and so did my husband. They do freeze well which is great since it makes so many of them. I just used black beans instead of kidney beans-turns out great.

These are good, really good.  I was doubtful that anyone else in the family would like them, especially my husband who "hates sweet potatoes" but even he liked them!  The only person who didn't like them only likes cheeseburgers anyway, so she doesn't count :)

The flavors in this burrito are perfect!  Served for some friends and everyone wants the recipe.  Well worth the cook time... and reheats well in the microwave.   I didn't add all the water it called for... no other changes.  Although someday I may try adding coconut milk or mango salsa.  LOVE THIS!

Very wary of this dish, but I had leftover sweet potatoes and wanted to use them.  Great!!!  Yummy!  My husband, who needs meat in every dish, said that he liked them too.  Made 1/2 the recipe, used 2 cans of black beans and less chili powder than called for, and I still had 1/2 of the burritos for leftovers.  I'm going to freeze, as per other reviews.

I thought this was actually very yummy! I followed the bean mixture recipe and it was delicious! I had some leftover and used it as a dip for tortilla chips. Loved it.   I did use pinto beans and kidney beans - what I had on hand. I used only 1 cup of water and it was WAY too runny, I had to simmer for awhile to get it  to thicken up a little. Next time I will probably only use 1/2 cup.  Thanks!

I was pleasantly surprised about the unique flavors of this dish!   The burritos are very healthy and are a great change if you are looking for a vegetarian dish. The only changes I made were using black beans instead of kidney beans & I baked the sweet potatoes and then just scooped them out.....  I served them with sour cream and salsa.  Although I enjoyed them, I sort of feel like they are missing something- maybe I'll play around with the spices the next time......

These were very good, and wonderfully different Burritos!!!  I changed the quantity to 10, but used the same amount of spices as if it was 12.  I found that this made a whole lot more than just 10.  The spices were very nice, but there was way too much chili powder in them for the hubs and I (and he loves spicyness!)  I will use this recipe again i'm sure.  We love sweet potatoes...... Thank you!!!

I usually like to try things that are different and I am a vegetarian, so I thought this might be neat. There are a few things I wish I had done differently, but honestly I won't make it again.   I think 2/3 cup of water was waaay too much to add to the beans. Also, the beans were bland. Could have used some tomatoes and more seasonings...  The sweet potatoes were a little bland too.  Cheese was the best thing going for them and I don't like to use a ton of cheese since it's not the healthiest thing out there.  Overall, it was ok. I won't try it again.

Although this recipe seems a bit unusual I still decided to try it and I'm glad I did!  I cut the recipe down to 1/4th since it's only me.  I used one can of kidney beans and one small sweet potato.  I mashed the beans while they were still in the can but they don't necessarily even have to be mashed.  It was a great recipe, I only wish I had sour cream to add to them!

I really wanted to like this recipe, but it just didn't come together like I wanted it to.  It's really more of a 3.5 as written, but it has potential. First of all, I used black beans as recommended by other users.  I also subbed in chicken broth for the water.  Next time I will save myself a WHOLE lot of trouble, and just buy refried black beans.  I second guessed using mustard & soy sauce in the beans, and now totally wish I hadn't.  In my opinion it threw the flavor off. Second, I added cumin, chili powder, butter, brown sugar, & cinnamon to the sweet potatoes before mashing them. Third, next time I will probably use a Mexican cheese & not cheddar. Like I said, great base for a recipe but way too many tweaks to give this four or five stars.

Big hit with the family. I don't eat wheat or beans so I made it into a meat casserole and it was delicious. Substituted a pound of ground beef for beans and water. Layered the meat then cheese then sweet potato and baked for 15 min. I'll be putting this in regular rotation.

Love them! Made them vegan without the cheese. I did a rough mash of the kidney beans and left the water out entirely. I'm excited to have these in the freezer as a standby for days I am unable to cook!

I also used black beans instead of kidney and whole wheat tortillas. Also only used 1 cup of water. 2 would have been way too soupy for me. First time I ever cooked with sweet potatoes! Thank you for this VERY tasty recipe!

I was hesitant on this one. I am so GLAD i tried it..I like Glopsy's idea of using black beans! I froze a bunch and they made a great lunch.   I will make them again & again.

Good combo of goodness.  Used different proportion to suit my likes/needs.  Overall odd, but good.

these were delicious! I froze them and brought them with me to work for lunch. WARNING: they are spicy! Definitely not meant for those with sensitive taste buds.

Yummy! I don't know the difference between sweet potato and yam, but I used yam and it was FANtastic! I used some of the suggestions posted below (used black beans, added a can of corn, sweated the onions first then added garlic and spices and let get cozy with one another for a bit before adding the beans) and it turned out great! Just waiting for the fam jam to get home and hear their verdict!

Not sure what all the fuss is about.  These were edible, but the left-overs went to waste and I don't think I will make them again.  Followed the recipe exactly.

This was a bit hit with my husband and I.  I used whole wheat tortillas, low fat cheese and low sodium soy sauce and kidney beans to make it a bit healthier.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.  I will continue to use it as well as modify it in different ways.

Delicious, I used black beans instead of kidney, and threw them in the food processor with water to save time. Left out the cayenne, it still had lots of flavor and even my kids ate it up, yum!

Karena your a genius!  This is amazing!  Who would have thought beans and sweet potatoes?  I used black beans and mixed everything together and I had some fresh green chilis, but used the same spice mixture.  Next time I will make it a bit hotter but other than that it was great!

These were good - I pureed the beans and estimated the seasoning. I had extra of the bean mixture leftover, but that is because we are still learning to like beans and are doing a little bit at a time. I froze the leftover bean mixture to use for next time!

I thought these were out of this world.  I took the advice of someone later on and sauteed the onions, garlic & spices first, then added black beans instead of kidney beans.  Awesome - just awesome.  I had some of the black bean mixture leftover, so I poured it over the top of the burritos and sprinkled some more cheese on top.  So delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I made this exactly as stated but I left out the water in fear it would be too runny. The first time I made it, it came out great! I made it again and for some reason it was not as flavoful. It was sort of bland but I think I did something wrong. I will definitely keep trying though because these are GREAT!

I've been trying a little experimentation in the kitchen and this recipe got several "Wow! This is awesome!"s from my boyfriend. I'll have to admit it was pretty darn tasty...I didn't have chili powder so I used crushed red pepper, smoked paprika, and garlic powder in its place. I also added a little more cayenne pepper than the recipe required because we like it hot. I used  kidney beans and those tasted great, but next time I'll try black beans, because there will definitely be a next time!

This is an interesting burrito.  I had some sweet potatoes to use up so I decided to give it a try.  It was an interesting combo of sweet and savory- which I like.  My bean mixture was a little watery (to watery to use as a filling) when I added the water.  I really needed to let that cook down a little before making the burritos.  I made half with colby jack and half with mozzarella (my husbands preference)  Next time I make these I will mix the potatoes and bean mixture together because even though I layered one on top of the other prior to wrapping up they seemed to separate in the burrito with one side being potato and the other black bean.   I can see why these are called addictive because the more you eat them the better they seem to taste so don't judge on the first bit alone.  Thanks for sharing.

Very easy to make and very tasty. Didn't change a thing although I did use frozen sweet potato chunks that I cooked in the microwave. I would also used canned sweet potato chunks to save time.

This is such a delicious recipe. I have a friend for whom I made this recipe a year ago and she still reminisces about the burritos! I usually make it with half kidney/half black beans as I'm a big fan of black beans and I mash them before adding them to the pan. These are great to freeze and reheat for lunch.

Love these! I made the mashed sweet potatoes the day before and kept them in the fridge - this cut down on the preparation time the next day. Although the chili powder may seem like alot, don't worry, it's not too spicy!

I don't know that I would call them addictive, but they were really surprisingly good. Next time I make these, I will make the beans spicier, as the sweetness of the sweet potatoes kind of took over. The only thing I did differently was to leave the kidney beans whole, as I did not think the overall texture would be pleasiant with everything mashed. All in all, this is a recipe I will make again, so thank you very much for the recipe!

These lived up to their "addictive" name.  I made them for dinner the other night, and after reading some of the reviews I substituted black beans for the kidney beans.  Other than that, I left the recipe as it was written.  They were DELICIOUS!  My 3 kids (2 adventurous eaters and one picky eater) were not big fans, but my husband and I couldn't get enough of these burritos.  I served them with salsa, fat-free sour cream, sliced avocado and cilantro all on the side.  I also served a black bean and corn salad with it. The next morning I realized why they are called "addictive" sweet potato burritos.  I opened the fridge to make breakfast and saw the leftovers.  I contemplated, then took one out, heated it in the microwave and had it for breakfast.  Even better than the night before.  I will definitely make them again. Oh - it also made way more than 12 burritos.  I probably could have gotten 15-18 out of the amount of potatoes and beans I had leftover.  Not a problem though....next time I'll make as many as I can and freeze them.

Hubs loved these, I'm afraid I didn't. The kids thought they were ok. Between the mashed beans and the mashed sweet potato, the texture of these is very pasty and mushy which didn't appeal to me. The bean mixture was mildly flavorful on it's own, but once the sweet potato was added in, that was all I could taste. I always appreciate a healthy vegetarian option though, so thank you for giving me one to try :)

The flavor was okay--I upped almost everything and added ginger to give it something special. I prefer burritos with distinct ingredients & varying textures, which does not fit well with this recipe.

Yummy! Cooked the sweet potato in the microwave, scooped it out and lightly salted. Mashed pink beans in some olive oil and garlic...added 1/2c. water and taco seasoning. Put on the tortilla potato, bean mixture, salsa and cheese and chowed down. So good and cooked in less than 15mins! Next time I'll add some avacado!

This is great!  I followed the recipe except did not add the water to the beans and added some shredded chicken to the burritos.  The entire family raved about them, even the resident 6 year old who hates everything except pizza.

Kinda a lot of work to get everything together, but these are delicious!  My picky and mainstream eating wife even thought they were good.  I'd eat them weekly if I could.

Well, this is quite an interesting dish. I liked it and I didn't. Some of the flavors were just off like the soy sauce, mustard, and the sweet potato didn't quite go with the rest. I found it quite offputting until I brought out my bottle of Tapatio hot sauce and it turned out much better, still the sweet potatoes just don't go. I think a better choice would be a plain white potato and add some seasoning to it too. I ate mine but I'd have to make some changes before I'd eat it again. It has some definite potential though.

I have had this recipe in my recipe box for almost 9 year, but I finally took the opportunity to try it.  I only wish I'd tried it years ago!  It was so good, even my daughter who doesn't like vegetables asked for more.  The salsa and sour cream blended deliciously with the sweetness of the sweet potatoes, and the recipe was very easy.  I'm so glad I finally gave this recipe a try!

This is such a fabulous recipe.  We make them all the time.  Always with black beans.  Otherwise, the recipe is perfect as is.  I make way more and freeze them for later.  I make all my friends try these and they always ask for the recipe.  :)
. ..Years later and I still love love love these!  Perfect blend of flavors.  My favorite dinner recipe

These were amazing.  Like other reviewers, I used 1 can of black beans, and I also used 1 can of pinto beans and some frozen corn.  I ran them under hot water and then mashed them.  I also put the spices in with the onion and garlic to let them cook before adding the beans.  I also mixed the mashed sweet potato in with the bean mixture.  For the sweet potatoes, I baked them for almost an hour in a 375 degree oven.  They came out fantastic and I am looking forward to eating the leftovers!

Not so great.  The black bean paste would be a good spread on a sandwhich, but the sweet potatos and the black beans as the man ingredients make for a very mushy burrito.  Its the fresher version of what you'd get from a prepackaged frozen burrito... which is fine, if that's what you like; I personally like more vegetables.

These burritos were good. Next time I make them I plan to add some more veggies to the burrito and some garlic. Over all a tasty recipe.

These were really good!  My husband and I were pleasantly surprised - especially him, who scoffed when he heard there was no meat in his dinner.  I gave it 4 stars only because I think next time I'll add something with a crunch to vary the consistancy...  maybe corn?

I really liked these! I used black beans as suggested but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Mashing the beans with your hands works great. I will be making these again in a big batch and freezing them. They are great in the microwave from frozen. **UPDATE: Using a blender to mash the beans in a huge bowl works great! Use the high setting - they all mash up in a couple minutes.

I wasn't sure I was in love with this recipe when I made it, but I enjoyed it much more the next day.  Eating it with sour cream is a must, though.  It just doesn't taste well without it!  I will try these again with more cheese and maybe some hot sauce to spice it up.

Used half kidney beans and half black beans. Doubled the chili powder and cumin. Mixed the cheese in with the bean and potato mixture at the end and put into burritos and ate them as is without baking them.  The mustard I used was really strong, so will either use less mustard or a different kind next time. Was a nice burrito and will likely make again.

Wow! Like others, I was afraid of this one at first. What a great recipe! I also prefer black beans so I used those instead. They were a huge hit!

This is good, but the flavors are more subtle than our family prefers.  I made the beans with bacon grease for more flavor/fat since we didn't have any cheese in the house. This is very good with plain yogurt (instead of sour cream) and avocados.  Obviously, it's chock full of vitamins.

I made these to have one for lunch, and I put the rest in the freezer to have on hand. I used black beans instead of kidney (just a personal preference), and I omitted the water because I didn't see much need for it. I also mixed in a little sour cream with the bean mixture to make it creamy. These are pretty good. I think I would prefer something with a crunch in them, so I might experiment with ingredients next time. Great idea, and a lower fat option to beef and refried beans. Thanks!

Pretty good. Out of 5 in our family I was the only one that liked it. I am a potatoe lover where no one else is. I added hot sauce to it to give it a kick and that made it even better. Great recipe and for me I will make again. thank you for sharing.

We all loved these (kids raved more than the adults!). I used 1 can black beans and about 1 1/2 cups of corn as well as the sweet potatoes. I agree with others who said to mash/mix it all in one pan - then fill, add cheese, and roll. I also added salt and pepper. Made 10 large burritos. We will be making these again!

I am re-rating this, as the first time I tried it I was really disappointed.  All I could taste was sweet potatoes.  Sometimes I like them, here I did not.  However, I had made a freezer full of them.  The next time I tried the author's suggestion of frying them up like chimichangas, and tried a tangier less tomatoey salsa.  It made all the difference and this time my whole family loved it and requested seconds!  On second thought, we will keep this recipe!

What I would say has already been said in all of the 5-star reviews, but ... USE YOUR HANDS TO MASH THE BEANS ... it makes it a lot less time consuming!  Fabulous recipe.

Great recipe - inexpensive and easy to make. I used black beans instead and they turned out wonderful. The recipe made about 14 that I put in the freezer to take to work for lunch when I am in a hurry!

I have been making these for years because my son is a vegetarian and I'm always looking for new ideas.  They are delicious!  I use canned vegetarian refried beans and usually make a double batch and freeze them.  They reheat well.

we make HUGE batches of this and freeze it in snack-sized bags. they're the perfect size for one serving and thaw just in time for lunch at the office.  one thing we do differently is that we just mix the beans and sweet potato mix together. the taste is the same and it makes storage a lot easier. the first time we made it, we used more beans than called for, but it turned out great anyways! this is a definite "repeat offender" in our kitchen. :)

Yummy burritos. This is a good starting point for a lot of variations of different beans and squashes, like pintos and mashed butternut. Thanks!

These are fabulous!  I used the modifications suggested by Toni below and used 1 can black beans, 1 can pinto beans and 1 cup frozen corn (thawed) as my bean mixture.  I also reserved the water I boiled the sweet potatoes in and used 2 cups of the broth in place of the 2 cups of water.  I could only find 8 inch tortillas so the recipe yielded about 20 burritos for me.  Freeze the leftovers and 2 minutes in the microwave is the only thing between you and a tasty snack!

I used 3 cans of beans 2 kidney and 1 black, did not measure if that was the correct amount.  Used 2 nice size sweet potatoes which I boiled until soft then skinned and mashed.  Added the potato into the bean mixture and made 10 soft taco tortilla size burritos and had enough mixture left for 6-7more. Very good flavor, we will make again!!

Weirdly delicious- you wouldn't expect it to work so well as a dish! I am married to a chef, and he loved making this. We used fresh sweet potatoes from our CSA box. Very simple & filling.

This recipe was ok. I made it as specified and didn't think it was as great as others. Maybe if I had had some salsa verde with it, it might have been better.

These were good--our whole family of five enjoyed them.  I especially like how nutritious the recipe is with beans and sweet potatoes as the main ingredients.  Would be interesting to add corn or chopped spinach to the recipe to add some texture.  Also, I found the amount of water to be high, so I reduced that a little.  I will likely make again!

I gave these 5 starts, my huband gave 4! I love the combination of flavors. Here are the minor changes I made to work with what I had: -I used 2 cans black beans, 1 can kidney -I used 3 medium sized sweet potatoes With the  above amounts I got 10 burritos w/ a little bit of beans left over. -I didn't completely mash the beans so a 1/2c. water was just right. -I didn't use mustard, but loved the combination of the other flavors.  Like the recipe says, they do freeze well. I wrapped them in foil and then put in a ziploc bag. To reheat I just opened the foil a little and put in oven (I think at 375) for about 20 minutes. YUMMY!

I've made this recipe at least 5 times and it always turns out great. I usually use black beans because I always have them but either one is a good choice.  Don't skip the mustard, it really makes the flavor great!

Convinced myself to try it and glad I did.  This recipe was a hit with the whole family.  Most of the boys had seconds. I couldn't bring myself to add the water to the bean mixture.  Not sure what the point was.  It seemed like a mistake in the recipe.  Anyway it was great without it.  I also backed off about 30% on the cumin and chili powder and it was just right for us.  We're not vegetarians but it's nice to know that we could be! 8-)

Excellent! As if these didn't have enough fiber as stated, I used multi-grain tortillas, but other than that followed recipe exactly.  Very tasty and filling!  Used a potato masher to mash the kidney beans, but I purposely left a few of them whole for texture.  Will try black beans next time as I think they'll work well, too!  Thanks for sharing!

I loved these.  I'm not a fan of kidney beans so I used 1 can of black, 1 can of pink and 1 can of white beans.  I have a dairy allergy so I left out the cheese.    I didn't add water (didn't find that necessary), just mixed the sweet potatoes, beans and sauteed onions and spices.  I also added saffron brown rice to the mixture.  I may omit the brown rice next time, my husband said he would prefer without it.  These were so yummy AND healthy.  They're going in my monthly rotation.

This recipe is one of my and my husband's favorite vegetarian burritos.  They are fairly easy to make, healthy, and wonderfully delicious.  Have made them many times.  Be careful not to add too much water or you will need to let it simmer off a while or add something like masa to thicken it.  We like to make the whole batch and wrap them individually, keeping them in the fridge for an instant, yummy lunch!

I wouldn't make these again.  The bean mix was good, but adding the sweet potatoes ruined it. I'm not too sure why the recipe asks for so much water - you only need a bit. The amount of cumin in the recipe is also excessive.  Bland and boring.

Maybe it should be only 4 because I didn't use kidney beans, but then again that might be good too.  Like many others, I was a little hesitant about the recipe, but glad I got over it.  These burritos are yummy, yummy, yummy.  I wanted to take some to work to share with co-workers and my husband doesn't want them to leave the house. I don't know how you could call these bland, I have a diminished sense of smell/taste and these have a wonderful mixture of flavors.

Very delicious! I made this as a birthday dinner for my meat eating husband and he loved it. I used kidney beans and black beans and it turned out wonderfully. Strongly recommend this dish. Can't wait to make it for dinner for our son when he can start eating solids.

This recipe was excellent!! It sounded so weird at first but i had at least 5 other people try it, and all loved it. This included a 1 year old and his mom who "won't eat anything healthy"!! Our grocery stores don't have sweet potatoes so I substituted yams and it seemed like it'd be the same. I did freeze some, and they can come right out of the freezer and into the microwave....perfect!!!

this is seriously the strangest recipe i have ever made...it's just strange that these ingredients are together in this recipe.  i was really hoping this would be a good one to get my kids to eat more veggies, but it didnt go over very well.  the flavor was fine - nothing exciting and just kinda odd.  my husband said "interesting".  adding water to it really confused me as to why it was necessary - i added only half the amount indicated.  i would prefer not having the filling so loose and it would be better if it was thicker in the burrito and maybe less likely to squoosh out so much...so dont add water if thats your preference too.  i used refried black beans so there was no mashing and it was extremely easy to prepare.

I didn't use the soy sauce, but added a 1/2 tsp. sea salt. I also didn't use the called for prepared mustard. I used a pre-mix seasoning pack (all natural) that I already had on-hand, instead of combining the spices myself. I added extra onion (sauteed), and used longhorn cheddar and jalapeno Jack cheddar combined. Topped with picante sauce, chopped tomatoes, and shredded lettuce. Put out bowls of chopped chives, jalapeno's and sour cream on the table for serving. Very yummy! (Also followed the advice of other reviewers and used black beans, not kidney beans).

I really enjoyed this recipe and followed the directions as is.  I was rather concerned though with the bean mixture when I added in the water.  Mine was quite runny and didn't start to thicken at all until I added in the spices.  Even then, it was still runnier than I would have liked.  Next time I would reduce the water slightly, add in some peppers and/or other veggies.  I'd also bake a little longer so that the tortilla gets a little crispier and possibly add more amounts of spice.  All in all though, it was great and I'll do it again for sure.

We all liked this recipe, even my meat-atarian parents! My only thing with it is a) they were a bit hard for me to roll up (probably due to lack of experience) and b) I would have liked the filling to have more spice. Overall good, and I will be making these tasty treats again.

Wow wow wow... I actually can't remember how I ended up seeing this recipe because I was looking for desserts. This was awesome and everyone loved them! I used 3 yams and 1 sweet potato and used 2 cans of black beans instead because it was all I had. These were awesome and definitely a keeper!!

Absolutely awesome! I followed almost exact... slight modifications I'm sure as a result of modifying for 1 (used one sweet potato and made 2.5-3 burritos, depending upon how much filling you use). I thought they'd be good by oh my! Such a fun, unique recipe!

I bake my sweet potatoes first at 450 for 1hour.  No poking holes, no butter, just the potatoes.  They come out perfect.  Then, I put them into the tortilla with everything else and broil them for a few minutes until the tortilla is crispy.  awesome.

These were fantastic!  The only changes I made were substituting honey dijon mustard for the prepared mustard, and cajun spice blend for the cayenne pepper.  Also, I added only one cup of water at the end instead of two.  I felt that adding the other cup would make the mixture too runny.  I used a cheddar blend of cheeses, instead of cheddar only.  I can't wait to make these again!  These would please anyone, even the pickiest vegetarian!

Changed it put a bit but the concept is awesome. 1 can of black beans, heated with 1 garlic clove, pinch of curry powder and ground cumin and lots of chili flakes. 3 big sweet potatoes boiled with a clove of garlic, salt, pepper, paprika and mashed. Made about 7 or 8 good sized burritos, enough for 3 or 4 people. To assemble: I put a layer of beans, a layer of potatoes and some cheese on top. Folded it and placed on a lightly oiled sheet pan. Baked at 350 for about 10 minutes. I served it with sour cream, cilantro and a homemade pineapple salsa! Yuuummyy.

These are delicious! I mash up the kidney beans in the food processor and add the sweet potatoes to the bean mixture to make it easier. I always add a big handful of cilantro, which I think makes this much tastier.

These were very flavorful and very filling.  My husband even liked them even though he doesn't like sweet potatoes because there were so many other flavors.  I used the black bean version that other readers recommended.  I found the sweet potato burrito filling a little bland and added garlic salt to a second batch.

These were very good, and, yes, as others mentioned, very addicting! My husband says they taste like Taco Bell (don't know if that's a good thing or not), but the subtle sweetness added by the sweet potatoes is great. I didn't have kidney beans, so I made 1/2 with black beans and 1/2 with pinto beans--you can't go wrong!

This is a delicious recipe! I used black beans, but can see how kidney beans might compliment the flavors in a different way. This was so yummy and filling, my boyfriend loved it too. I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is amazing. I followed other reviews suggesting that I mash the beans before - works out great. I also use black beans i/o kidney beans. I share this recipe w/all of my vegetarian (and non-veggie) friends. Absolutely delicious!!!

Awesome! Different tast and texture but absolutely delicious.  I used black beans instead of kidney and mashed it all up together so it would be easier to put together.  It made a lot so I had several burritos left over.  They were wonderful heated up the next day!

I liked these, though I am going to tweak a little further. I did use black beans, and mashed them OUTSIDE the pot before adding. The amount of water was too much for the beans, so I will use half next time. Sauteeing the spices first seemed to make more sense. Next time I will add some oregano and coriander as well. Half a block of CREAM CHEESE, smeared on the tortillas before the other ingredients, was a REALLY good compliment, and we preferred this to the ones without them. In fact, the cream cheese could be mixed into the potato for richness and flavor. (I did not make this up; my favorite vegetarian restaurant is famous for a similar recipe).

absolutely delicious! For the Sweet potatoes bc baking is time consuming and can be messy I would recommend boiling. (when cut into chunks it only takes about 15 min to cook!) Used black beans and just mashed them right with the sweet potatoes

I expected these to taste a lot more unusual.  They were delicious just as the recipe is written. Next time, I'll probably use canned refried beans to speed things up on a weeknight. The seasonings were just right; I'll make this again and not change a thing!

Brilliant recipe! A few things that I do differently - I use more kidney beans than recommended and I usually add avocado into the burritos before I put them in the oven. Yumm!

I made this last night for dinner and it was great. The only change I made was I omitted soy sauce, I didn't have it on hand. My boyfriend is a huge meat eater but he ate this last night and Loved it! He brought the leftovers to work today. I am definitly making this again : )

Super yummy, very filling. They are even better leftover and reheated in a toaster oven, and so they make a great lunch for at work.  I think I might try black beans next time since I prefer the flavor of them.

These are wonderful.  My kids eat them, the adults love them, and they are healthy.  We make them often. I make changes all the time to adjust to our tastes and what we have on hand and they always turn out.  I am so thankful for this recipe- It brought new flavor that everyone loves.

My new favorite recipe! I made only 6 servings, and still had a lot of filling leftover. I'll use the leftover filling to make quesadillas or empanadas later this week. Next time I make this, I'll add cilantro too.

These are truly addictive!  

I follow the recipe except I leave out the chili powder (I don't like chili powder).

The first time I made this, I wasn't too sure about the first few bites.  But it grew on me and the next day, I was craving them again.  Thank goodness for leftovers.  My picky 5 and 8 yr olds like it too.

Some reviewers said the baking doesn't matter but I say it's essential!  Gives all the mushy potatoes and beans a little crunch.  I tried them once without baking (when I was in a hurry) and I'll never do that again...they still had great flavor but they do need that crunch!

Great recipe!!

My husband and I both liked this.  I think that next time I might mix the potatoes with the bean mixture, that way you don't just get a mouthful of potatoes when you bite into it.  I halved everything to make six burritos instead of twelve, but could have used a little more spice.  But yummy overall, will make again!

These were good. I would say 3 stars, but my boyfriend thought they were super duper, so I pushed it up to 4 stars based on that. =) I'll try this again, and possibly tweak the recipe a bit to add a bit more flavor. Thanks for sharing!

These are so good!  I added a little extra cayenne to satisfy my spice craving and served with a simple salad.  This makes a lot.  Once I had a lot left over and took the left overs to a party and cut the burritos into bite size pieces for the guests.  They were gone in no time.

Weirdly awesome. I used black beans instead of kidney beans, and it was so tasty I probably won't ever try kidney beans. One of these is very filling.

I love a good burrito and am always looking for a new variation but this recipe really did not do it for me.  The flavors just did not mesh well together at all.  Sweet potatoes do not go with savory black beans and cheese.  I did like the black bean part of hte recipe though and will use that again in other burritos.

It took me awhile to get the nerve up to try these,  but I was hooked after my first bite! The spices mixed with the sweet potato make a perfect fall meal!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't read it carefully enough and combined the beans with the potato and it came out very well.  I nuked the potatos with the skins on, pureed them in the cuisinart and then added the beans to the cuisinart and buzzed them a bit,  Made the work very easy.
Thanks a lot.

I tried this after reading a review. My family rated it about 3 1/2 but I added half a star for nutrition and innovation! It's a very acceptable recipe for a non-meat meal. And I thought it very tasty if not addictive. I did spray the outside of the tortilla with vegetable spray to give it a little crunch.

I wouldn't call this addictive, but they were ok. I added more spices, corn, salsa and of course cilantro. I also used 2% cheddar cheese. 
It is a healthy, quick and easy meal and I probably will make it again.

Didn't turn out too good for me. Too much carbs and not enough veggies. And the texture reminded me of babyfood.

I have to say...after reading all the great reviews about this...I was a little disappointed.  I followed the directions exactly, but I found the recipe a little too bland and chunky. Although, the addition of some sour cream did help...

Yum!  This is a great recipe, although I am giving it 5 stars based on the following changes recommended by other users:  I used all black beans instead of kidney, used half called for water, added grilled veggies (onion, bell pepper and mushrooms), and lightly sprayed each burrito with cooking spray before baking to give it a more crispy,fried-like texture.  This recipe is quite a bit of work, but worth it becaue you get so many meals out of it.  I make a big batch, freeze left over burritos individually in a vaccuum seal bag, and microwave in a paper towel later for an quick easy meal.  I serve with avacado (if I've got it) and salsa.  Delish.

I used corn tortillas and it turned out well. They will just get crispy edges so you might cook it for less time.

These were great! I followed the recipe exactly but instead of making burritos, I made quesadillas. As another reviewer suggested, I mashed the beans and made the filling in a bowl then added it to the onions and garlic. Thanks for the terrific recipe!

The spicy kick of the beans mixed with the sweetness of the sweet potatoes combines nicely, especially when served in homemade whole wheat tortillas!

I really looked forward to trying this one.  When I first made it I realized that I was missing ground cumin (after I had everything mixed).  Do not omit that spice, it is key to the taste of the Burritos.  I went out and added the cumin the next day and that helped a great deal but I still felt like something was missing but could not put my finger on what it could be.

Wellll, obviously I'm one of the few who didn't find these all that great. First of all, I just want to say that I made these exactly as stated, and my DH and I love sweet potatoes and love Mexican, so we thought we'd be crazy about these. But IMO they lacked something, not sure what, maybe more spices. DH said they were just kind of blah and I had to agree. Sorry for the bad review :(

"Wow" I made these for a dinner for a vegetarian and they were delicious!  We only managed one burrito each with salad because they were so filling.
I made a few changes which were use half and half black beans and kidney beans then mashed them up before adding to mashed sweet potatoes.  
I also sauteed the onions with garlic, chili powder and cumin then added the soy sauce and a little sugar, mixed all the ingredients together before filling the tortillas.
I also put, five minutes towards the end of cooking, some grated cheddar cheese onto the burritos before serving.  To say they went down a treat was an understatement will definitely be making these again.

My boyfriend wanted to make these for dinner for us one night and I was pretty skeptical. The ingredients didn't really seem like they would go together that well... I was pretty surprised once I had some. 

They were AMAZING! They are truly addictive.

Thanks for the great recipe :]

Yum! This was so good...I love sweet potatos and this is a great (and unusual) way to use them.  I followed the recipe with one exception, I took the advice of another reviewer and added the spices to the onion and garlic to sautee and help release the flavors.  Other than that I followed to a tee.  The only thing I will change next time is how I asemble the burritos...I spooned the bean and potato mixture beside each other and it didn't mix enough.  Next time I will spoon the beans and potatos on top of each other so the flavors mix more.

I really did not know what to expect with these, but they were so good! At first bite you're a little apprehensive, then you're like "hey this is good!" I made them exactly as written except I used black beans. I also used homemade tortillas which made them really good. They are seriously addicting (I had 3! What can I say, I like to eat)

This is my favorite recipe of all time.  I LOVE IT, and everyone I've fed it to loves it too.  The only substitution I make is using refried beans instead of the black beans.  Such a GREAT IDEA!  Thank you!!!

I've had this recipe in my box for 4-5 years and now I'm regretting that I didn't make it earlier!  I added the water to the beans before I added them to the pan and then I used my immersion blender to mash them -- this was super easy!  I used black beans instead of kidney beans.  Also - before I baked the burritos, I spread a thin layer of margarine on the top, baked them for 8 minutes and them broiled them for the rest -- the top became very toasted and delicious!

I just made these burritos, and they were phenomenal! i also used black beans instead and pureed them in a food processor first. i also did not have chili powder so i substituted for wasabi powder and a little bit of jamaican jerk seasoning! they were to die for. i dont know what anyone was saying about needing sour cream or hot sauce because they were perfect on their own. i froze the rest and cant wait to heat them up for a snack or a meal when i dont feel like cooking!!!!

I made this for my boyfriend, and he LOVED it. He's requested that I make it a repeat in our rotation. I did use black beans instead of the reccomended bean, but outside that, I thought this was fantastic!

I just didn't like these.  I tried to, but I couldn't.  My daughter didn't like them either.  Thanks anyway.

This was excellent!  I mashed my sweet potatoes and kidney beans together before adding both the the onion/garlic mixture and that worked great.  Didn't need to change or add a thing.  I highly recommend these!

super good!  i used 1 can refried black beans to make it easier and left out the water.  stupidly i only bought 1 sweet potato so i had to half the recipe.  should've read the reviews before i made it and let the spices saute too.  still it was great with sour cream and gaucamole.

These were really good.  I used black beans.  I think next time I will mix the beans and sweet potatoes together to get a more blended flavor, and I will definitely add more cheese.  Great vegetarian option.  Thanks!

I have to admit, I too was not too optimistic about this recipe but it turned out well. A nice blend of flavors and something I can easily make when I get home from work. Stayed well the next day. Thanks for the recipe.

We liked this recipe a lot...but we didn't love it.  Based on all the other reviews we thought they would be really great.  Although they were good, and very filling, they weren't great in our opinion...and we like sweet potatoes.  And burritos.

These were okay.  I really don't like sweet potatoes, but I have been seeing this recipe on here for years and finally decided to try it since it was hyped up so much.  I would have given it 3 stars just because of the sweet potato taste... but I guess when making something with sweet potatoes, you would expect that taste, haha.  If you DO like sweet potatoes then these would be a high 4 or 5!

This was pretty good!  I used canned sweet potatoes for maximum cheapness and speed, and mashed the beans with my mixer before they went into the frying pan with the garlic and onions.  Also, I only used one cup of water, but I'm pretty sure I had more than 4 cups of beans all told.  Just eyeball it - it should be a bean paste, not soupy!  Also, I used a very large frying pan, not a medium one... this is a large quantity of stuff to mix together!

Finally, I held the burritos together with toothpicks as they baked, so they kept their shape.

This tasted great, but next time I would put in some rice or quinoa for more texture- rather than it just being all mashed up stuff.  

I used kidney beans like the recipe called for, and they are relatively easy to mash if you mash them first.  I also added a small can of mild chilis.

Ive been so excited to try this recipe out. It turned out awsome. It took alot of work but in the end it was well worth the time. I also sub. the blk beans, sauted the onion with garlic and spices and used less water...In the end there were no leftovers the family loved them too much. Im glad to add this recipe to my collection.

Awesome!  My roommate made something like this once, and when I saw the recipe I had to try it.  I made a few minor changes:  I used all black beans--and after I had cooked the sweet potato, I put the beans and potato in my food processor and blended.  This was a huge time saver.  I also added almost 1/2 tbsp of cayenne pepper---which gave it a real kick.  When I sauteed the onions and garlic, I added a jalepeno and some green chile--which spiced things up.  The recipe made wayyyy too many burritos for me--so I wrapped the extra burritos in foil and put them in a container in the freezer.  I can pull one out and pop it in the oven if I'm running short on time!

Wow, these are awesome! My husband was quite skeptical, since he doesn't LOVE sweet potatoes. But we loved them so much! I used a lot of the reviewers' tips (sauteed spices with the onions; mixed sweet potatoes into the black beans).  I used black beans instead of kidney, and whole wheat tortillas; reduced the chili to 2 Tbsp, and left out the cayenne, since we're not so into spicy. I baked 3 medium sweet potatoes (50 minutes at 350°) to make the mash; I also upped the cheese to 12 oz. This made about 18 burritos for us. So fantastic, and my 18-month old agreed!

Strange, but satisfying.  I used soy cheese and made some guacamole to go with it, and I substituted the kidney beans for pintos.  I would make this again!

This turned out really good. I cut the recipe in half and used 2 parts Black Beans, 1 part Kidney. I also recommend at least partially stirring the bean and potato mixture together before assembling burritos. From the suggestion of other reviewers, I added a little syrup to the sweet potatoes, and will NOT be doing this the next time around. I served with guacamole and that was all it needed! The only complaint, preparing the cooked sweet potatoes took awhile.

After reading the reviews, I decided to make this for my sister's family to freeze and serve later.  I used black beans instead of kidney beans and added a bit of cinnamon, clove and a touch of brown sugar to cancel the bitterness of the beans.  I also added silken tofu to the mashed sweet potatoes (for extra protein).  This made ten burritos.  Everyone LOVED these!  No one could tell there was tofu in it and my sister has begged me to make it again when I visit.  Next time, I will try them myself!

As my first vegetarian meal, I'll have to say it was surprisingly delicious, easy, and filling.  It's going to be a common meal in my house... even my meat loving boyfriend loved it and asked me to make it again!  I also took the advice of several other users and used black beans instead of kidney beans, and added a little sour cream on the outside of the burrito (after the baking).  Yum!

My husband and I were really excited about trying these, we love trying new foods. Try as I might, I just could not like these. I really really wanted to like them, but they were incredibly bland. To be fair, I didn't use soy sauce due to a food allergy, but did add quite a bit of salt. The texture was fine, but there was no particular flavor or flavor combination that stood out. They were a little better with salsa, but not much. I could probably try a few alterations to make them more flavorful (this was our dinner table conversation, 'how to fix the burritos') but they were too much work for something we really didn't enjoy.

I really liked contrasting sweet and savory of this dish, though I think I used too much sweet potato per burrito. I also changed the beans to be half black and half pinto, which worked well.

This is an excellent recipie! I changed it up a little by making them enchilladas- when you put them in the oven, just pour a can of enchillada sauce over them, and grate the cheese over it. Yum!

These were awful and so bland they need something else in it, also something to make them more textured, the filling reminds me of baby food. I won't be making these again.

Awesome recipe! I've made this many times for my family, my three-year-old asks for it often. I like to use half black beans and half red kidneys. I throw the mashed sweet potato in with the beans before filling the burritos just for convenience. They are very filling, and make a lot. I like to bake them (or use a countertop grill) and wrap the extra burritos in foil and freeze for an easy lunch. By the way, any extra filling can be used like refried beans, really good spread on a tortilla and fried with cheese quesadilla style. One of our favorite recipes of all time!

Excellent twist on the classic bean burrito. Great for lunch leftovers. We didn't bake these, just filled the tortillas "on demand" and warmed in the microwave. We also mixed black beans and kidney per other's suggestions.

Holy Frijoles! This was so good!  I gave the recipe 5 stars against my policy not to give 5s to recipes that I adjust, but they are so good I couldn't give them a 4!  I followed the reviewers advice and added maple syrup and cinnamon to the sweet potatoes.  I used canned black refried beans-why mash?! I pushed the onions aside in the pan and  "toasted" my spices before mixing in the beans.  My husband said these were "phenomenal" and "gourmet"

Fantastic! I made these and did add a little butter and cinnamon to the sweet potatoes and black beans to the bean mixture and it is fantastic.  It made about 20 burritos and the taste is so good.  No cheese or anything extra needed as these are great as is.  Thank you for a great recipe.

A college roommate got me hooked on this recipe almost 5 years ago! They are fantastic- a great balance of flavors and they are wonderful frozen. I find that the higher quality corn tortillas work better (flour ones tend to dry out if you are freezing) and the recipe usually yields more like 15 burritos.

These are pretty good. Not as fantastic as everyone else seemed to think and we LOVE sweet potatoes. One mistake I think I made was using the large tortilla wraps. They would definitely be better in a smaller size. Very good lunch option though. I loved how you can freeze them wrapped in paper towel, then micro them for lunches or a quick supper. This is a keeper.
Update: no - I prefer using these with large tortillas, but how I fixed my problem is that I just mix the potato in with the bean mixture before putting them in the tortillas. This solved the problem of getting one bite of beans then one bite of potato. I LOVE these. I'm never without them in the freezer for a meal on the go.

Well....these could be good I suppose. The first problem I had was adding 2 cups of water to the beans...why? It would be soup! I was going to because I like following exact directions before reviewing but that would be too icky so I left out the water. I didn't want the beans seeping out everywhere. The second problem was the consistancy of the sweet potatoes after I baked them. I love them and give them to my kids just baked all the time but when you mash them, they need a bit of liquid in there. Otherwise not too appealing and not very spreadable inside a tortilla. So I added some evaporated milk to smooth them out a bit. This is a very odd recipe as it is. WAY too many beans per potatoes. Especially if you add 2 cups of water. I mananged to save this though but will make a few revisions if I make them again...IF I ever do. Just ho hum and the directions were somewhat weird.

Children said that it tasted weird.  As far as the directions: It was difficult to mash the beans; I ended up putting the mixture in the magic bullet to mash the mixture.  Step 3 said to divide the bean mixture, etc.  I wasnn't sure what that meant, so I just put everything together on the same tortilla.

My family (all meateaters except for me) loved this one. Use fat-free refried beans instead of kidney if you don't want to mash. I spiced it up a bit more than the recipe called for.

AWSOME I used pinto beans made from scratch then I rubbed butter on the tortilla and baked.  Tastes like a deep fried.

Good burritos! I only give recipes a four when they have to be altered a bit. These were GREAT when using 2 cans of black beans instead of 6 cups kidney beans. This was a quick meal that my whole family enjoyed.

Well, the sweet potatoes gave these burritos an interesting "bite", but I wasn't a fan.  My hubby liked them better.  Something was missing... maybe next time I'll put tomatoes in them to give it some more dimension.  A+ for effort though!

Good, but it's hard to get over the sweet potato. My husband LOVES any kind of tex-mex food and he agreed that these were good, but we'll stick with regular refried beans next time.

I made these this week, and we really enjoyed them.  I substituted vegetarian refried beans for the pinto beans, and added fajita seasoning instead of the cumin, chili powder, and cayenne (fajita seasoning contains all of those spices already). I also cut out the cheese as husband is lactose intolerant.  We both thought they were different, but good, and will probably make them again.  Also great because you can freeze the extras!

I read all the reviews and was hoping this would be a really good recipe. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy these that much. The bean mixture was really good, I used black beans and kidney beans, mashed before hand. The sweet potatoes were just too much. I cut down the sweet potatoes in the burrito to maybe 1 Tablespoon because it was just too sweet against the spicy bean mixture. I loved the bean mixture and will use again but not with the sweet potatoes.

I only made two alterations.  I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings and added 1/8 tsp ground cinnamon.  The beans and potatoes were great wrapped up in a whole grain tortilla.  Thanks for sharing!

An OK recipe.  I liked the idea of using sweet potatoes, it does make for a different dish. However, I don't know if this is something I would make again.  I just wasn't thrilled with the over all taste.

my boyfriend and I loved these!! we used the black refried beans (low fat,check the can!) and these turned out perfect. we'll probably use the smaller tortillas and not the burrito ones bc they'd end up too big and with too much leftover tortilla. you have to of course grill these after you wrap them, the wrap is extra tasty toasted and grilling them just merges all the yummy filling to gether. thanks for the recipe

I was skeptical and looked at this recipe many times before I finally decided to try it. I would give it 3 1/2 stars because I tweeked it a bit and it could use some more. Added some cream cheese to the potato mash and extra cheese inside the burrito. Sour cream on top definitely made it tastier. Cilantro would be good in there next time. I used black beans instead of kidney and just warmed it in the microwave when assembled. My husband (who is not vegetarian) liked them and doesn't even like sweet potatoes. We will make these again!

This was a good, simple, quick burrito. We substituted black beans and added a jalapeno to the smashed sweet potatos. Hits the stop for Mexican and you do not feel like you just ate a plate for grease.

I like burritos and sweet potatoes so I decided to try this recipe even though it did seem like an odd combination.  Another reason I decided to try it was because almost all of the reviews raved about the recipe.  

I was disappointed in the results.  The burritos didn't taste bad but I wouldn't describe them as "addictive" nor were they anything out of the ordinary.  I did follow the directions exactly EXCEPT I used canned sweet potatoes instead of fresh and I added the sweet potatoes to the bean mixture instead of layering it with the bean mixture on the tortillas.  One of the reasons I added the potatoes to the bean mixture was because the bean mixture was far too watery.  Inspite of the disappointing results, I may try these again--using fresh cooked sweet potatoes, cutting down on the water, and following the directions for assembling the burritos.  If the results are the same, however, I won't keep this recipe.

These were very tasty! I ended up using almost equal parts of sweet potato and bean mixture. I tossed a splash of enchilada sauce into the potato mix. I also did not use water to the beans. I used salsa and some fat free half and half. It added the moisture that was needed and made it a bit creamy. I could imagine adding some cream cheese to either part of the filling to add some yum. This is a good basic idea. You can really make it what you like. It's going to be on the menu for next week! Thanks.

My freako husband doesn't like sweet potatoes, so when I make these they're all mine.  They freeze beautifully, and knowing there's one waiting for me at lunch always gets me through the morning.  I like them with about half as much sweet potato as beans - completely delicious.

OMG. These were amazing. So easy to make. The flavours were wonderful. My husband raved about them for days afterwards even though they were so easy to make.  Will make them again....and again...and again... :)

I liked them, but my family did not.  They freeze well, so I froze the leftovers for lunches.

We loved this recipe!  I used two cans of refried beans and one can of red kidney beans, used 1/2 cup of water only, left out the cayanne pepper and pretty much followed the recipe as written.  I served it with sour cream and salsa on the side.  It made about 12 burritos-I was able to freeze 1/2.  Enjoy!

As written, this recipe contains flavors I love, but the amount of cumin seemed to overwhelm the sweet potato.  Still a great concept, though; I'll just adjust the spices accordingly next time I make this.  Thanks!

I would agree with most of the other people here and say this is a tasty recipe, but it needs something to make it a little more full-bodied and a little less mushy. I am going to try adding some rice next time.

i was a little hesitant to try these as i wasn't sure if my partner and i would like them.
but they were a pleasant surprise.
i scaled the recipe down to 4 servings but it could have fit into a couple more tortillas.
we added some salsa and sour cream to them after they came out of the oven as well and that improved the taste a lot. i don't think i would have liked them as much without that.
i also used black beans like others have suggested and then used a hand mixer since it was really hard to mash them. i probably won't add quite as much water to the bean mixture next time either.

I initially liked this a lot, but after dinner it really upset my stomach.  I tried it again with the leftovers, with the same results.  My family thought it was just okay, not great.

Very easy to make, but I was expecting more in the taste.  Toasting the tortilla in the oven makes a difference - good touch.  Maybe next time I'll add corn, guacomole and a little sour cream.

These burritos were DELICIOUS!  So easy to make, too.  I used fat-free refried beans and sprinkled extra cheese over the top before baking.  Then I topped with salsa and sour cream.  MMMMMMMM

These are yummy. I did modify the recipe for my taste and for simplicity. I added the chili powder, cumin and salt to the onions and garlic. Then I added two cans of regular black beans without draining, as well as one can of refried black beans with jalepenos. I mixed this up, with no additional water, and then added the sweet potatoes. On top of that mixture i added a tub of spicy pico de gallo salsa. I omitted the mustard and soy sauce.Because I'd roasted the potatoes earlier in the week, this recipe went pretty quickly. The burritos were spicy and yummy, I made 12 and still had enough mix left over for bean dip.

I very nearly chickend out of making these, the combination just seemed so odd. But the remarkable number of glowing reviews made me put aside my reservations and make them, and I am really glad I trusted everyone! These were terrific! The sweet potato with the spices and the cheese was unusual but quite delicious. We had the burritos with salsa, sour cream and avocado,and all the flavours worked very well together.

This has become the recipe I turn to whenever I want "refried" beans.  So easy and versatile . . . works well as a burrito filling on its own with tomatoes and cheese, as a dip, or as a spread for tortas.  Great with black beans too. A true staple.

The flavors in this recipe did not balance or blend well.  I made this exactly as stated.  It looked very tasty, but I was left wishing I had something else to feed my family for supper.

Mmm... A very nice change from the basic/boring bean burrito! Will certainly make it again. Thank you for that different and tasty recipe! Changes: I saute the onions, and then blend everything (1 14oz can red beans 1 14 oz can sweet potatoes, rinsed). Top with cheese, roll in a tortilla, and lightly fry on both sides (or use no oil in a nonstick saucepan).

These were great.  The only thing I would recommend is that the sweet potatoes are mixed with the bean mixture before putting into the tortillas.  The flavors taste better blended well, rather than separate.

These burritos are so yummy.  The unlikely mixture of ingredients compliment one another perfectly.  This recipe makes really large burritos or more than what it indicates.  If you like Indian food, you'll love these.  They were a great change of pace for my vegetarian family.

I made these burritos the other night and couldn't bring myself to try them until the next night.  I ended up really liking them, but was just apprehensive at first and I am not what you would call a picky eater.  I am not crazy about beans and the sweet potatoes to me are okay (unless you are eating them with a lot of butter).  However the ingredients ended up working nice together and tasted good.

This was really good, especially since I love sweet potatoes. Unfortunatly my husband found out he didn't like sweet potatoes when he tried this recipe. I just leave the potato out of his portion and it still makes a great bean and cheese burrito, much better than store bought pre-packaged kind.

I also use black beans instead of kidney beans because it just tastes so much better.

really amazing.  i tried this recipe with fresh and canned sweet potatos, and i must say that there IS a difference!  yes, it saves time, but the canned are not nearly as good.  sometimes, i'll add about a tsp of cinnamon to the beans (i prefer black to kidney) and sub the cheddar with pepper jack.  good stuff.

This has to be my all time favorite.  I like that it is good, healthy, etc.  It is very easy to freeze the remaining without the cheese on top and then let them bake while I get settled on a busy evening.  It reminds of similar ones I had at a popular Mexican restaurant in Chapel Hill, NC>

Omit the water if you decide to make this.  The water just turned the beans into a runny mess.  As for the recipe....kind of bland and too much work for what it is. I hate rolling burritos

May sound funky, but just try it! It's great! I go heavy on the sweet potatoes. Feel free to substitute beans of choice. Makes plenty. I put monterey cheese in & on it.  I like things hot, so I add hot sauce & cracked red pepper before I microwave them. Top with salsa, light sour cream & cilantro. Yum!

These are very good.  I am not giving it four stars because I think that the recipe is a little flawed.  There is too much bean mixture and it calls for too much water for sure.  However, the flavor of these burritos are delicious and interesting.  One suggestion: use canned sweet potatoes because then you don't even have to cook them before you mash them.  Major timesaver!

The bean mixture was great and I'll use that part of the recipe again, but we didn't care for the sweet potato part at all.  Burritos shouldn't taste sweet...

We liked it with more sweet potato than the bean mix.  I halved the bean mix and still had too much.  It's a good idea to freeze.  But remember to freeze before baking... not after.

We really loved these.  I had to reduce the water to one cup, otherwise the beans would have been far too watery.  This may have been because my beans were mashed by hand and pretty chunky.  Otherwise, just fabulous.  Going into regular rotation!

Absolutely delicious and also very healthy.  I prefer to not mash the beans as they add a bit of texture.

This recipe seems like a weird combination of food, but it really works very well. Both my children and I loved the burritos although my meat-loving husband passed on them. I did find it difficult to mash the beans in the skillet and think that I'll try to mash them first in food processor or blender when I try this recipe in the future. Overall, a really good and hearty recipe!

I substituted black beans for the kidney, otherwise kept everything the same. It was delicious!! A big hit with my 1 and 3 yr old and my husband. A nice meatless alternative to our traditional Mexican-style dishes. Thanks for sharing!

These burritos were okay but they certainly were not addictive at all. My family was not willing to eat the leftovers which is not the norm in my house.

It was interesting but I'm wasn't all together thrilled about it. I may make again but will try some of the suggestions other reviewers have made if I do. Better than a bean burrito but not really addictive.

My husband I enjoyed this but we didn't care so much for the texture.  It was definately something different and I probably would try it again.  Great for lunches the next day and better because the flavors had more time to blend.

I try to cook vegetarian at least twice a week and was starting to have trouble finding new recipes.  This was GREAT!  Not the easiest thing to make with a 16 mo old under my feet, but worth the trouble.

These were ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!  I nuked the sweet potatoes to speed process up.  Also, I made it in a layered casserole instead of individual burritos (also to save time).  Even my two year old loved them!

This is a wonderful recipe. I love sweet potatoes and make them for my baby, so decided to find a recipe that uses them.  This is great!  My kids and husband love them.  We add lots of cumin and some cilantro.

Great!!  Only complaint is that the time is a little off, as the potatoes add about ten to fifteen minutes of prep time.

Not good at all! I made these and they took 2 hours! Tasted really bad, sweet and spicy do not go together. Plus, it made way to much. Just ask my freezer.

Superb!!  The name tells it all!  I used refried black beans instead of the kidneys and water. Also, used canned sweet potatoes.  They were delicious.  I  deep-fried them and had to go to the store to buy more tortillas because I didn't have enough. Made 20 burritos. Very rich and very filling.

A good recipe, I used canned sweet potatos,mashed.  They were very good, but next time to make it even easier I will use canned mexican refried beans.  I also recommend a thin layer of the sweet potatos and beans, not really thick.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband loved these, of course he loves sweet potatoes.  I think maybe next time I'll put some mexican rice in them or perhaps serve mexican rice with them.  We used black beans and served them with D's Famous Salsa, (Allrecipes), and sour cream.  It's a keeper.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe that my husband and I both really like.  The more times you make it, the easier it gets to assemble.  Haven't been able to freeze any (I make 6 at a time), because we eat all the leftovers too quickly.  My husband's on a low fat, vegetarian diet for health reasons and this recipe really fits the bill!

I can't believe anyone would badmouth this recipe. I'm a college student. I make these once every couple of weeks and I'm set for days. Cut the water, kick it over to black beans and spice it up another notch if you have a problem. Other than that there's no reason to hate. The flavors awesome, my neighbors and roommates are always bugging me about this stuff.

I am eating these for lunch right now 2 days after making them.  Would you believe the flavor is actually better today?  Even my kids said so! Adults, make sure you top it with the suggested sour cream, salso and green onions.  It tastes wonderful that way.  My kids told me this was one of the best veggie meals I have made! I omitted the mustard. I started to put it in, then I scraped it out as it smelled like a bad mix for our tastes.  I used canned sweet potatoes. I actually mixed the bean mixture with the potato mixture.  Enjoy this wonderful recipe!

I used 1lb of dried black beans. After soaking they only take 15 mins. in a pressure cooker at 15 lbs of pressure. My whole family loved them. This will be on our table again soon.

These burritos were great, and the leftovers the next day were even better. I made only half the recipe and even then made only half into burritos, saved the rest for lunches. Used less water, black beans, added cilantro, chopped spinach and fresh tomatoes on top. Very good. I also used Mexican cheese instead of cheddar and sprinkled it on top rather than include it in the baking.

this recipe was excellent. a cafe here in chicago, earwax, has been offering this dish, and i am glad i found this recipe to replicate it at home. i omitted the water, used the liquid from canned sweet potatoes instead (but not a whole lot), and added some lime juice and goya adobo and lots of garlic and chili powder to kick it up. i fell over from being so full, my roommates liked it, and my co-workers who sampled my lunch are now singing the praises of my culinary skill high and low. thanks!

Half the water worked well for me.  Also, pay attention to the spicyness.  The recipie as is was quite spicy for me, and 2 of the 3 other people i was cooking for.  If you don't like your food really quite hot, I would halve the chilli powder as well.  I will definitely make this again.  They really are great to freeze and re-thaw.

i used pita bread and baked my sweet potatoes.
to assemble i put first mash sweet potatoes, then
bean mixture and then cheese. then baked them
according to directions. had sour cream for topping. people raved about them and i had to make
extra.

These may sound like a good idea, but we didn't like them. We are vegetarians, and love sweet potatoes, beans and burritos, just not together like this. The mustard was a bad idea. My husband who is not a picky eater, and always cleans his plate when anything with salsa is on it, had me take it away after a couple of bites. Live and learn.

Excellent! Even my husband, the meat lover, enjoyed them. I used less than half the amount of water called for.

This recipe is delicious! I substited canned black beans and canned sweet potatoes and it was ready in no time. I also only used about 1/2 cup water. I add jalapenos to make it a little spicier. My boyfriend loves this recipe as does everybody else I've served it to!!

These burritos were tasty, however the bean mixture called for too much water so i had to add a fourth can of cooked kidney beans.  Prep time was longer than i expected.  Lots of fun, though.  Overall a good recipe.

I didn't think addictive was an appropriate word for these burritos. "Average" would have been more like it. We "liked" these burritos, but we didn't love them. They were not flavorful enough even though we added all the fixings. We could taste the Sweet Potato, and it didn't compliment the beans very well. I would only make this recipe again if I had Vegetarian guest over for dinner.

My family gave it mixed reviews.  More of a 2.5 on average.  Lowest of 1 and 2 five star ratings.  The 1 rating is my daughter who is a super taster...with very ‘selective’ preferences.  So, I was excited to read reviews where the kids enjoyed this meal, but alas, the selective tastebuds strike again!

I made these for a vegetarian friend and she loves them!  Since she is convalescing, I packaged them individually into freezer ziplock bags.  When she wants one, She takes the burrito out of the plastic, wets a paper towel, wraps the burrito in it and microwaves it for 1-2 min.  My husband and I are omnivores and we, of course, loved them too.  I made them just as the recipe suggested.  TWICE so far.  Delicious Fresh or reheated in the microwave.

I was expecting more.  I made them for the first time for company and was a little disappointed.  They were bland, not much flavor or pizazz.  I guess I could have added more of the  seasoning but I probably just won't make them again.

These were delicious! As I saw on the reviews, I also used black beans. I only needed about 3/4 cup of water, not the 2 cups listed in the recipe. We also reduced the cheese a bit as well, but also found they are delicious without cheese. Great recipe!

I've made this recipe several times.  As writtten I give it 4 stars.  I prefer using black beans in place of the kidney beans.  And I don't completely mash them.  I like some chunks left for some texture.  I also like to use a flat out (or healthier tortilla wrap) than what was suggested.  This is definitely a go to, easy recipe I have made in heavy rotation.  Thank you for the recipe.

These also turn out great in the air fryer!

Delicious! After reading reviews, I substituted the kidney beans for black beans. Other than that, I followed the recipe and fully enjoyed the results! It sounded like a weird combo, but I ended up enjoying it immensely

I made an easier version of this recipe for 4 people. After sauteing the onion and garlic I added about  1/3 cup of water and mixed in peeled, cubed sweet potatoes along with chickpeas (which are easier to digest). I used more potato than peas. While it was cooking I graded cheese. When it was done, about 20 min later, I added 1/3rd of the rest of the ingredients and mashed it all in the same pan. We spooned the mixture into tortillas. Served it with the cheese, sour cream and salsa. Excellent vegetarian meal and the cumin gives it a wonderful flavor. Thank you for sharing.

Everyone loved it.  It was proclaimed the best meatless I meal that I ever made!  I couldn't find kidney beans and sout cream, so I used white northern means and plain greek yogurt.  My family wolfed them down, and we  happily ate the leftovers for a couple of days0.

Getting into vegetarian cooking has been difficult, but these burritos are easy-pasy. Plus they taste great! We normally make these for our meal prep once a month or so. They cook up quick which is also a huge bonus. I always eyeball the seasoning and just do it to taste.

Oh dear Lord, these are good. I made the recipe exactly (except I only used about 1/4 c. water) and these were truly a religious experience. I've been putting off making these because I really thought the sweet potatoes would be too sweet and weird. They're not! Also, you may think adding mustard and soy sauce are the oddest thing ever, but these ingredients totally work and make the filling irresistible. The only negative thing I can say about this recipe is there is a very real danger of eating half of the filling out of the bowl while preparing the burritos. It takes A LOT of restraint. And need I state how healthy these are? I think I just did : )  I ate these with guacamole (although it isn't really needed.) Yummmmmmmmmy.

These are excellent. I used black beans and much less cheese than the recipe calls for. Also, I sauteed the spices with the onions and only added enough water to make the bean mixture spreadable. Yummy.

I've made this dozens of times. One of my favourite vegetarian recipes. Kids love it too. We often swap black beans for kidney beans or do a half and half split. Otherwise we make it as listed.

Delicious!  I did have to use black beans because it's all I had, but I kept everything else the same and these were amazing. Even my kids, who do not like sweet potatoes, loved these and ate up all the leftovers the next day.  Thank you so much for this recipe! A keeper!

It was great for a vegetarian dish but for a regular dish it was just OK. I would definitely serve it with salsa, shredded lettuce and sour cream.

Added mushrooms to the onions. Added only enough water to the onion and bean mixture to moisten it. Used an Adobo pepper in Sauce but could have been spicier. Forgot the onion....too bad.

I did the recipe as written and my friends loved it and asked where I got the recipe from. One friend is interested in giving it to her vegan family.

I’ve made this recipe a few times, and it’s always a crowd pleaser! The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because I now leave the soy sauce and mustard out. It was still delicious, just a personal preference. I’ve also made it with black beans, kidney beans, and mashed lentils. The options for this recipe are unlimited and always turn out great!

I followed the recipe as is and found them just ok. Next time I’ll add more cheese, chicken and not bother with sweet potato. Good basic recipe that I can use again with alterations.  Thanks.

The title is right - these are addictive.  Also very “make ahead” friendly, they crisp right up after thawing and baking again at 425 for 12 minutes.

This is a good recipe! I'll diffidently make it again. Next time, I will chunk the sweet potatoes instead of mashing them, saute some pepper slices (to add color and crunch), and I might even add some steak strips.

These were really good. I used black beans and shredded Mexican cheese blend. And since we are all carnivores ;) I added pulled pork bbq to ours. Will definitely make again!!

I was skeptical of this recipe, thinking it would be bland, and was so pleasantly surprised at how it turned out! Only did a few things different than the original recipe: 2 tablespoons of chili powder instead of three, cooked the onion first, released the flavor of the garlic by cooking it for a minute with the onion, then added all the spices to the onion garlic mixture to release the flavor of the spices. I added all remaining ingredients to the warm pan to mix, but omitted the water as I didn’t want the same mashed consistency of the potatoes for the beans. I only roughly mashed the beans once added so there was more texture. We froze the remaining burritos for lunches/snacks as needed so we’ll see how that turns out too!! Will definitely be making these again. I’ll probably add green pepper next time too

I've made a lot of delicious recipes from here with 1K+ 5-star ratings and have been very pleased, but this one disappointed me. This recipe was very bland and I will not make again. The title "Addictive" is a total exaggeration. No rehab needed. One hit and I quit cold turkey.

We love these and make them regularly!  I follow what other reviewers have said and use less beans and split half kidney and half black beans.  I like putting extra cheese on top and inside because I love cheese :-) We also wrap them up and freeze them for easy lunches and dinners later!

Very good recipe, the texture was a bit too mushy in my opinion (I don’t like the taste of baby food in my mouth) LOL! Was a great leftover meal I have to say, will DEF be making this again. Stay groovy fellow recipe reviewers!

Easy and healthy.  I "mashed" the beans and sweet potatoes in a food processor, which made it even easier.  Can use either the bean mixture or sweet potatoes as sides.

This has become one of my favorite recipes. I usually use 2-3 types of beans instead of all kidney beans. I don't mash the black beans if I use them.

I took the advice of some of the people that made this after reading  quite a few reviews.  I used 1 can of kidney beans & 1 can of black beans as this is what I had in my pantry.  I did not add any water to the beans. This would have made it too soupy.   One reviewer added chopped cilantro to the bean mixture and I did this also.  Good idea.   I was surprised at how well the mustard & soy sauce enhanced the flavors.  I will make this again.

We all loved this recipe!  I made the fillings (used 1/2 red and 1/2 black beans and only one cup of water) the day before because I had to go out on the day we were having them.  When I got home, I assembled the burritos quickly, baked them, and served them with salsa, sour cream, guacamole, and chopped lettuce and tomato.  Accompanied them with Vegan Paella from this site.  A different, fun, great meal.

YUM! These were simple to make and so tasty. I did add the spices to the onion and garlic as I think cooking them a little brings out the flavour. I substituted a tin of refried beans for the kidney beans, so only added half the water, and used Tex-Mex cheese blend.

These are really good! The recipe makes a lot of burritos, I think I made 10 in total with smaller tortillas. With sour cream and salsa on top, we all enjoyed these, very much. Will definitely make these again!

I too left out the cayenne, as I have small kids at home.  I found the filling a bit runny, probably because I used canned kidney beans, so if you are using canned kidney beans too you may want to cut back on the water.  Otherwise these were perfect!   The bean filling is so flavorful, really it is all you need the sweet potatoes are an added bonus!  Great, will definitely make again!

Refried beans  can be used in lieu of red kidney beans, if so no water is needed.

These are great!

I used low-sodium soy sauce, 1 can each of low-sodium black beans, chickpeas, and kidney beans, and whole wheat tortillas. I only had honey mustard, and that added an interesting dimension to the flavor!

Will definitely make this again - both my husband and I loved it!

A new favorite at our house.  Added some avocado at my husband's request.  Reduced beans to 1 cup and doubled the sweet potatoes.  Turned out wonderful.

When I saw this and wondered if these flavours could be good together.  I decided to go for it omitting the mustard and soy sauce which sounded terrible to me and am sorry to say no they don't .  Sweet potatoes and chili beans are not a good combination.  3 out of 5 of us ate it anyways because we don't waste food here.  I think this recipe must have come about  as a creative attempt to use what was left in the fridge so I gave an extra star for that it is creative.  You could do this with     russet potatoes and it would be good.  Also you do not need to drain your beans and add water.  I used two cans kidney and two cans chili flavoured red beans.

After adding water we cooked a little longer until it started to cook off .  Served cayenne pepper on the side so my 2 year old could eat it too and everything was delicious!! Kids were going for second servings.

i scaled this down to make just 1.  i enjoyed it.  i might make more; i have enough fixings for at least one more.  i was surprised with the soy sauce and mustard additions to the beans, but it worked!  the beans were my favorite part of this recipe.  i also used black beans instead of kidney beans.

This was good, however it was just a big pile of goo. I would have liked it if the consistency of the beans and potatoes were a little different.  I think next time I might just cook the potatoes,  cut them but not mash them. I added sour cream as well.

I made this recipe because  my daughter is a vegetarian.  Well, I know this recipe has high ratings but we thought it was average, its very bland. I used black beans instead of kidney beans, instead of layering the sweet potato and the beans, I mixed them together.I cut  the recipe in half but I did follow the recipe to a tee, it made a lot of filling even though I cut the recipe in half. I did not use all of the filling I am going to let it sit in the fridge & see if the spices meld. If it doesn't next time I will increase the spices. I like the idea of using sweet potatoes as a the main filling but for us it needs more spices.

These burritos are delicious! I used black beans instead, a cheese blend, added jalapenos, and then topped with sour cream, avocado, and hot sauce. Broil for a few minutes at the end to make them crispier, which makes them easier to heat up as leftovers the next day without them getting overly soggy.

I did make this pretty much as written. I used pinto beans instead of kidney since I don't like them. Came out great. We dressed ours with some salsa and a bit of cheddar cheese on top.

Delicious!  I had a taste for more of an Indian flavor so I substituted Garam Masala for the Chilli Powder and increased the cayenne pepper to 1 tsp.  I also used a variety of beans and used food processor to avoid the  mashing of the beans in the pan  and added only about 1 cup of water, but think it would be good with coconut milk too :)  I added avocado and served with chopped tomato. .

This is one of my absolute favourite recipes since I tried it three years ago. Over the years to make this recipe quicker I've developed a cheat, which is to mix all the spices and seasoning in with the sweet potatoes or yams when I mash them and just use a can of refried beans. I also add about 2 tablespoons of cumin and some other spices for fun (sometimes some, including cracked pepper.

My family loved this!  They were skeptical but loved it.  I added a can of undrained green peppers and made a mustard substitute (my husband hates mustard) 4 tbsp mayo,3tsp garlic salt, 4 tbsp chili power, 4 tbsp turmeric.  I omitted the water and used black beans and the Mexican blend cheese.  Thank you for the recipe.

My family was surprised by how much they liked this!  I used black beans instead of kidney and combined the beans, mashed sweet potato, and seasonings. Quite filling.  One was enough -- especially since we eat late at night. Leftovers the next night were great!  350* covered in foil, then foil off to crisp the tortillas.

These were good. We used pinto beans and added a jalapeno pepper to the sauteed onions. I would also say that the ratio of beans to potato is key. As a potato lover, 2 cups for 8 burritos would not have been enough.

I don't have canned beans where I live, so I prepare the kidney beans in a pressure cooker. I throw in the garlic and onion while cooking and then put them in a blender with the rest of the spices instead of mashing them. I use plain Greek yogurt as a sour cream substitute and sharp cheddar cheese. I put the burritos together while everything is hot and don't bother warming them up in the oven.

Delicious! I am not a fan of kidney beans so I made mine with black chili beans (with liquid) and therefore only added 1 cup of water. I like my food spicy so I used chipotle garlic salsa for a topping; I will probably add more spices to the bean mixture when I make it again. Thank you for sharing, this will be a go-to workweek meal with plenty of leftovers!

I have been contemplating on making this for a few years and finally made last night.  I have to admit I was a little disappointed.  My hubby liked it but I wouldn't make it again.

I liked them, but hubby and son just ate them because they were what was served. Used black beans because we like them better than kidney beans. Also sped up the process by microwaving the sweet potatoes in their jackets and scooping the pulp issues not the food processor instead of boiling/mashing.

If you are hesitant about trying these because they sound weird, well, they are.  I debated about making these because they sounded strange. But with all the glowing reviews, I figured there must be something magical in the combination of the sweet potatoes, beans, and spices that I was missing.  Well, there was nothing magical or addictive about these for us.  They just tasted like sweet potatoes...and...beans.  Not awful, but definitely nothing special and yes, strange.  I was surprised that with all the spices that I found they were a little bland.  I wanted to make these in an effort to get my kids to eat something healthier. They like sweet potatoes, they sort of like beans, and they love my cooking, but they HATED these.  They ended up eating frozen burritos instead. So much for my efforts. Won't be making these again. Sorry!

I tweaked the ingredients a bit to my liking (omitted cayenne pepper, used less chili powder, added more garlic, and used my preferred tortilla). I'm the only bean lover in my family so these are great to freeze all the rest individually wrapped in foil. :)

This was awesome. I added a cilantro seasoning cube, and used dried black beans(after soaking them and boiling them to softness), also used quite a bit more chili powder and cayenne cuz I like a little more zip. I didn't bother mashing the beans I just mixed them whole with the mashed sweet potatoes and seasoning and it was delicious! Would definitely make again!

Hubby thought they were great and I liked them - addictive, no, but definitely interesting. I did change the recipe a lot, but wanted to let people know it's worth trying and have an open mind about the flavors. I used taco seasoning instead of all the single seasonings, and black beans, which I smashed about half of and just dropped the potato in to incorporate. These are very filling, which is great if you're watching your calories, carbs, anything that tastes good but you're not supposed to eat.......Thanks for the recipe and giving us something really different!

These are great as is, but I add a bit extra cumin and cayenne. Then I use vegetarian recipe crumbles in the bean mixture. Wrap them in foil and bring them to whoever is throwing the barbecue. Throw them on the grill for a few minutes, and perfect!

I was a little skeptical - but with such a high rating and SO many reviews, I tried it anyway. Five stars! I did substitute black beans for kidney from the suggestions of other reviewers and my own preference. I've been eating the leftovers all week now! This will be in my rotation for sure, particularly since they are not a whole lot of work to put together.

Served with sour cream and guacamole and they are heavenly. Added bonus! Put the leftover filling in an omelet with cheese and serve with sour cream. Trust me, you will definitely thank me! :)

Interesting, but not a favorite. Made a couple of small changes - added spices just after garlic and sautéed  for a couple of minutes before adding beans. Also did not heat up in oven, as it didn't seem necessary, and made a half batch.  Not sorry I tried it, but probably won't make again.

I usually make the recipe the first time I try it as-is, however I discovered after I started that I had no onions! So I took 2 T of minced onion (dry spice) and microwaved that for a minute with 2T water. I added it to the beans on the stove as I smushed them, then followed the recipe after that. (Anyone else think this could be accomplished by using refried beans instead?) Anyway, it was good! Surprisingly so. I would make this again.

A four only because on the second try, I made some changes that gave a result we liked better: black beans instead of kidney, not mashed at all. Added a bit more spice and then wrapped each as a nice, closed burrito. These are fantastic stored in the freezer for lunches: 2 minutes in the microwave and the tortilla is crisp and the filling is hot. Yum.

Made these at the strong recommendation of a friend. I liked it but my kids didn't. This could be my fault as I followed the recommendations of the previous reviewers and used 2 cans black beans (rather than kidney), 3 large baked and mashed sweet potatoes, only 1 tsp chilli powder and no cayenne as I was out of it. I also added 1 can of corn (including the juice). I did mix the entire thing together too so it was one layer and less mess eating and assembling. Personally I liked the combo of beans and sweet potatoes and with the sour cream on top it was really good for me. Unfortunately I won't be making again anytime soon as the kids won't eat it. This made a ridiculous amount. I made 20 6in burritos and still had half the mixture left, when I ran out of cheese and tortillas.

I exchanged the kidney beans for black beans as my family prefers the black beans. And I actually found a can of smashed black beans seasoned with chili peppers, tomatoes, and garlic. Plus I bought whole wheat tortillas.  And my family likes a few more things in their burritos so I chopped up some black olives, avocado, brought out sour cream for anyone who wanted to add these to their burritos. Who knew black beans and sweet potatoes taste so good together?!  We really enjoyed these. I will definitely make,these again. Next time I plan on turning a few into chimichangas. This was a great vegetarian and healthy and very filling meal!

Total hit even with my picky mother. I let the bean mix cook down a bit and it was delicious. I will be making it very soon again.

I am not sure if I did something wrong with the beans, but I ended up adding dehydrated beans to mine to get the right texture, and not using all the water.  
I am doing them again this week, as they are really, really, addictive.

The first time I made this recipe, I stuck to the directions and the family enjoyed them.  The second time, I substituted cans of fat free refried black beans, sautéed onions, and added the spices.   I mixed the mashed sweet potatoes with the bean mixture together with the cheese.  This made is easier for me to assemble them and not run out of sweet potatoes. I served them with salsa, sour cream and additional grated cheese.  Meat eaters and vegetarians loved them and requested the recipe.

I love this recipe and have made it several times since finding it.  I think how well it turns out depends in part on the quality of your ingredients.  I use really good whole grain mustard and good spices and it's always very flavorful.  I also simplified the recipe a bit and I just cube the sweet potatoes,   toss in a small amount of olive oil, season with salt and pepper (and sometimes paprika) roast until crispy and use them like that.  It cuts down on the work of boiling and mashing and adds a nice texture  and smokey flavor.

I originally made this recipe for the first time last year. Since then I've made it at least twice a month, I love it! I will say that the only thing I changed was that I used all black beans. I think the flavor combo is fantastic!

Amazing!  Everyone loved it.  I did use black beans and both Tomato Basil and Spinach Tortillas.

If I was making these for just myself, I would have added jalapenos and extra cayenne pepper.  But I like super, fire hot food.  I just added srirachi sauce to mine and it was perfect.

I made the same swap as many users and switched for black beans. I also think the recipe writer must fill their burritos much fuller than mine - I would need 24 tortillas to use all the filling. The recipe was very tasty and is not too difficult to make. Thank you!

My boyfriend made these for the two of us and his vegetarian roommate and we all loved them!  The only reason it gets a 4/5 is because I didn't realize they were 500 calories per serving and I definitely had two last night!  Still delicious..just have to watch the portion sizes!

This recipe was great!  However I did make a few changes to it like everyone else.

I added 1 lb of ground beef, cooking that till brown first and then adding onion and garlic, following recipe.  

Then 2 cans kidney beans, and one can black beans.  

2 cups chicken broth

Then I peeled  & cubed the raw sweet potato and added it like that to the recipe.  I added all the spices except the mustard.

Then simmer on stove for 30 minutes, slightly smooch some of the recipe.  Then add to warm tortillas, put leftover sauce over tortillas and sprinkle with cheese.  Bake allotted time = YUM and easier

Fantastic recipe! It was a hit with everyone. The only thing I did differently is after putting the onions and garlic in, I put the rest of the spices in to sauté them and bring out the flavor. Then I added the mashed beans. It was great!

I mixed the bean mixture and sweet potato mixture together so I could check the seasoning. Put a bit of oil on the wraps and broiled on high for the last two-three minutes. Was tastier with some added hot sauce, plain Greek yogurt, and extra cheese.

Served extra bean mixture on the side heated up next to burritos with sprinkle of cheese on top.  Would be good with green chilis and brown rice in the burrito as well.

The burritos are very filling and they work well for leftovers. Like others here I used a kidney bean/black bean mixture. 

My biggest issue is the recipe calls for a medium skillet to cook the bean mixture. I always need a large skillet when I cook these burritos.

Was looking forward to using up my leftover sweet potatoes on this, especially after reading all the rave reviews. I guess it's an acquired taste. It's OK, but I wouldn't call them "addictive" by any stretch. I did have to add extra spices to get some kind of flavor out of it. And yes, two cups of water is way too much--I had to let the bean mixture simmer a while to get the extra liquid out. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, but was not impressed. Sorry.

Better than I expected. Followed the recipe, but was a bit low on chili powder. I also used half the amount of water as it seemed excessive, and per other reviewers I used black beans. I made an avocado cilantro sauce to go on top, which really made it great. If I make it again, I think I will mix the sweet potato and black beans together, omit the water, add sour cream into the burritos, add cilantro, and possibly add some smoked peppers. I might also use 12 inch tortilla shells. I would also double the amount of avocado sauce.

For anyone interested, the avocado sauce I made was just an avocado, 1/2 c water, 1/2 tsp salt, 3tbsp cilantro, 2 tsp olive oil, a clove of garlic, a pinch of pepper, and a tbsp lemon juice... just blended it until smooth.

Loved it! Instead of kidney beans, used 1 can pinto, 1 can black beans, and 1cup corn as another reviewer suggested. Otherwise followed the recipe as written. I've never been a big fan of sweet potato but my husband is, so I gave this a try.

This recipe is great!  I cook mine more like smothered burritos with canned green or red enchilada sauce (or both!) and more cheese on top (the more cheese the better!).  I also used black beans instead of kidney beans.

With the beans I put 2 cans of black beans 1 of chick peas and 1 of lentils. Mashed them up before I put it in the pan. Once in the pan I put 1/2 cup of chicken stock and about a cup of water and stirred it frequently. They were in the pan for about 15 min. Then I added all the seasoning while still in the pan.. Instead of cumin I put curry powder. And the other spicy thing I put just a little bit of paprika. Make sure you use normal mustard. I used Mexican four cheese. Also took advice and sprayed the parchment lappet with olive oil pan to make it a little bit crispy. The beans mashed by themselves with the spices  and a can of sweet corn make an exccelent bean dip. Also dsweet potato goes best with these.

Delicious and very filling. I used black beans because that is what we prefer here. Very good vegetarian dinner. I was doubtful at first but gave it a try given all the raving reviews. I will redo this often. Thanks for this great recipe.

I was hesitant to try it at first, but the good reviews finally won me over. Using dry black beans instead of the canned kidney beans was the only change I made. The burritos were good, but certainly not "can't wait to make `em again good"! In spite of the cayenne, chili powder and mustard, they were still a bit bland. I'd suggest to anyone getting ready to make the recipe to have your favorite salsa on hand.

This was good but nobody loved it.  It's interesting enough that I want to make it again, because it's outside the usual routine.  It's also nice and healthy!  I used black beans instead of kidney beans and mashed them before adding them to the pan.  This recipe doesn't have much of a sweet potato flavor, which was an advantage because most of us aren't big fans of sweet potato.

Loved it!
I was looking for a recipe sans meat, sometimes i just want something different. I did make a few changes to match what i had on hand but i will be making it again for sure. I used a sweet potato and butternut squash since i had one that needed used up. Just threw them both in the microwave peeled and put them in with the onions, mashed them then i used a can of re fried beans since that's what i had. It was sooooo good! Even my husband that turned his nose up when he saw what i was doing ended up eating three. I baked mine with a little salsa on top with the cheese. I love being able to utilize fresh veg's, this was very filling as well.

Hmmmm   Somehow my family and I didn't really care for this.  Could have been because I used corn tortilla instead (since that's all I had in hand) But the filling was too spicy for us and didn't taste bad but wasn't that great to make me wanna make it again...

These are fabulous! Looking for a way to use extra sweet potates and using what was on hand we substituted black beans and corn tortillas, then ate them as chalupas. Just kept everything hot and layered it on toasted corn tortillas, topped it off with guacamole. I will most definately be making this again!

Easy to make. Great meal for a "Meatless Monday" dinner.  I too switched out the beans to black beans and to get more out of it added brown rice to the potatoes and beans and cheese mixture.

Finally took the plunge and made these. They are SO good!
I followed the recipe, except cut the water in half. It just seemed like it would be soupy.
I had Daiya cheddar and Tofutti sour cream, and used them,  but I really think it would have been just as good, without!

Definitely making these again!

Thanks, Karena :)

These are awesome. I'm vegan so I omitted the cheese. I added a tablespoon of nutritional yeast to the beans. I also used black beans because I'm not fond of kidney beans and I left some of the beans whole for some texture. I put a couple of dollops of vegan cream cheese before rolling up the burritos. I topped them with sliced avocado. So delicious and filling I think I could easily serve these to my carnivore friends

I thought this was delicious!  My husband made this last night, and boy was it tasty.  Such a simple, healthy, delicious meal.  I would definitely recommend this dish.  He bought extra sweet potato's, so we can have another night this week.  And it was so filling too!  Gave me lots of energy the next morning when I ran.

I was looking for a healthy alternative and this was just darn good.  I didn't have kidney beans so had to substitute Garbonzos and black beans.  My family absolutely loved it!  Place quartered sweet potatoes in the crock pot for 8 hours on low (4 hours on high) and they'll be done in time for dinner.

My whole family loved these. Even my 13-year-old daughter who hates beans loved them. She said they tasted just like burritos to her. Due to soy allergy I used coconut aminos instead in place of soy sauce. Just thought I would throw that out there in case anyone could use the tip. This recipe made alot. We have an entire pan for freezing and some left-over for lunches tomorrow. I used 3 cans black beans and 3 large sweet potatoes. Served with sour cream and and pico. I was very nervous about this, but so glad we gave it a go.

My boyfriend summed it up best when he described the bean filling as having "too many spices and not enough flavour." The filling just tasted a bit odd and not-right to me. I made this for my boyfriend and roommate (using all the suggestions offered by other users) and all three of us ate in total silence.  The dish was just too labor-intensive for the mediocre-tasting end result.

This in our regular recipe rotation.  I like to substitute a can of refried beans for one can of regular beans in order to make mashing easier.  Also, the full amount of water seems like too much.  The soy sauce and mustard sounds really weird but it works.

I used both kidney and black beans, added cayenne to desired heat, and only put a small amount of water (pretty much to get the consistency I wanted).  Also sliced up some avocado.  Delicious!

Really easy recipe. I added fresh cilantro, which is always a nice touch. I will also try black beans instead of red next time, but they taste great and look nice.

The beans needed more kick and the sweet potatoes needed an extra something. Have made these many times but with an extra tbsp chili powder and switched kidney beans to black beans. Also added 1 tsp cinnamon and brown sugar each to sweet potatoes.

Enjoyed this for one meal, then for several lunches after freezing in paper towels/baggies. It's a distinctive taste/texture, so I do recommend freezing, since too much in one week would degrade the initial interest.

All four of my kids loved it.  I used black and kidney, sweet potatoes, and butternut squashed (left over from the night before).  It turned out great!

The only way these could be made better would be to mix the beans and sweet potatoes before loading the burrito. As written, we got one side beans and one side potatoes. Very far from bland.  I loved these.

Very good idea.  We always have sweet potatoes in so this recipe made sense to me. I would add salsa to the burrito before eating, as these are mildly flavored in my opinion.

This recipe has potential. I made it just as posted here, and I felt the cumin was over powering and the beans were too liquid-y. (I'm not a big cumin fan, so it's prob. just my me). I'll make again but next time I'll tone down the cumin and just use 1 cup of water. Might just use canned refried beans too if I'm short on time.

Even the kids, who do not like sweet potatoes, REALLY liked this!  Two things I would do differently.  I would use less than the 2 cups of water as the bean mixture needed to be thicker.  I would also mix my sweet potatoes and the bean mixture prior to putting it in the tortilla so when you roll it up it is evenly mixed.  Many of our bits were just sweet potatoes.  But it was still GREAT!

Everyone liked this. Not something to rave about but they are worth trying. They are a good healthy change.   We will fix them again. The only thing I did different from the recipe was I only used about 1 3/4 cups water instead of the 2 it called for 
I froze 6 of them to have later.

YUM!!!  I really loved this recipe!  It was a hit with my husband and 5 year olds also.  I used 6" organic whole grain tortillas so I had a lot of burritos.  They were just the right size for the twins.  I served with jalapenos, sour cream, salsa, and sliced avocados.  Some reviewers mentioned that mashing the beans, (I used black  beans by the way), was the hardest part.  I just used my potato masher right in the pan like the recipe said and had no problem.  You don't need to smash them so much that they are mushy.  I love this recipe because I have lots left over to freeze and use on a night when I don't have time to cook!!!

I don't normally change a recipe the first time I try it, but tonight I had to.  I chose to use black beans instead of kidney, and since I was out of chili powder, I used spicy adobo chili powder.  My husband had recently smoked a pork shoulder, and we had already shredded it for barbeque.  So I added some of the pork to them, and assembled them like enchiladas.  I had some bean mixture left over, so I added water and poured that over the enchiladas. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes, served with sour cream and avocado slices.  Delicious!!

These burritos are always a hit, with vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike! The only change I make is using black beans instead of the kidney beans. The flavors are amazing together and this has become one of my go to recipes.

Made 4 of these tonight, with extra onion and garlic because I was low on beans and potato. Still worked out really well! Have frozen 2 of them so looking forward to having them next week. Used just the ingredients stated and loved the taste. Will definitely be doing these again.

Delicious! My fiance (who is a bit picky) really liked these burritos! I didn't add any water and my beans turned out perfectly! I would even eat the beans plain on the side. Next time I am going to also add corn and rice into the burritos and freeze them.

Made this for my son who has become a Vegan....He loved the sweetness of the sweet potatoes contrasted with the bean....Had to leave off the cheese off his. Me, I loaded my with cheese and topped with sour cream! The recipe is HUGE so, if you are making for 4 people, you can easily 1/2 it.

Ok I read the reviews and I was so excited to make these and had high hopes. I followed the recipe and applied a few of the top suggestions. I LOVE sweet potatoes, but this did not have near enough flavor! Maybe with something else added in the burrito and less sweet potatoes, MAYBE. But after eating these, I don't have much desire to put sweet potatoes in a burrito again. Sorry - obviously I am in the minority here.

I made the recipe following the directions exactly and as such I give it 4 stars, next time I will make some changes. Mashing the kidney beans was difficult and really messy. I will use refried beans next time or just leave them whole.  I also found the water unnecessary and I just had to drain it off in the end. Finally I found it way too spicy but that is my taste, If you prefer things mild, skip the chili powder altogether or just add a pinch.

I never write reviews however I don't think I have enjoyed a recipe so much as this one.  As a few others had I changed it just enough to suit my taste, black beans and frozen sweet potatoes with cinnamon and maple. Awesome!! So yummy!  Thank you so very much for taking the time to submit your recipe.

This was just okay. It's a good way to use up sweet potatoes but I wouldn't serve it to company. This recipe will not go into our permanent file.

This was great!  Spicy, flavorful, and filling.  I did not use two full cups of water, more like 1/3 of a cup, and I half-mashed both the beans and the sweet potato to give some texture.  My only gripe:the tortilla got crisp in the oven.

Will make again! My picky meat-lover husband loved them! I used canned yams, and mix of black and kidney beans. Also added a little cinnamon. DO NOT use all the water the recipe states, just use what you need for the right consistency. I topped these with sour cream (actually Cream Mexicana) and that is the cherry on the top!

My husband and I loved these.  I used pinto beans instead of kidney  and they were perfect.  Not that I wouldn't have used kidney, I just didn't have any.  Also used taco cheese instead of cheddar...  The rest was all the same and they turned out awesome!

Fairly easy and good base recipe.  Served the burritos with homemade salsa.  Next time I'll blend the sweet potatoes with the kidney bean mixture for a more even distribution and add some shredded cheese inside the burrito.  Will also spray my baking sheet with cooking spray since it's not teflon.

I am brand new to vegan eating (for health reasons,) and going into it kicking and screaming. Picked a recipe that had high ratings in hopes I could find something palatable. Even so, didn't expect to like this as much as I did. I didn't have enough chili powder so that got cut back to 1 heaping Tablespoon, but that was plenty for me.  Didn't even miss the cheese.  I might even try this on guests!

I omitted the cheese and sour cream and added shredded savoy cabbage (tossed in olive oil and rice wine vinegar) and chopped cilantro. It added a little crunch and the cilantro was really good it it. I'll definitely be making it like that every time!

I forgot to mention from my post that for added flavor I used the sauce from the canned chili beans instead of water.  It also made a real difference.

Sounds strange, but so good! The only changes I made was I used black beans instead of pinto and did not add water. I also sprayed the burritos with cooking spray before putting them in the oven so it crisps up a bit. Makes 20 burritos! They freeze great though. Just take them out and put in the oven again. Serve with sour cream and siracha a must

These are definitely interesting. I think I do like them but the flavor combination is very unusual. My husband didn't quite know what to make of them, either. My two preschoolers did not like them. I probably will not make this recipe again.

These are terrific for my taste- I really like them although my husband rates them as just OK.  I usually make a big batch and freeze half of them in individual wrapping for quick and easy lunches. I microwave them right from being frozen. Good with the kidney beans as written, but also good with black beans. Thanks for this one-- yummy!!

I was a litte leary to try this because I've never tried this ingredient combination before.  But with all the good reviews, I decided to give it a go.  For some reason, I ended up having a lot of beans leftover.  The beans looked as though they had too much water and I had a hard time putting very much on the tortilla.  Good flavor though.  The sweet potato overpowered the beans (maybe because I did not use all the beans).  Maybe next time I will add less water and/or mix the potatoes in with the beans so that the flavor is more evened out.  Very filling, healthy, and inexpensive!

This is really yummy! A fair amount of work but the burrito filling has a wonderfully complex taste! I went a little short on the cheddar cheese and that was a mistake! The cheese really sets this off! I use part kidney beans and part black beans!

I absolutely love these. Easy to make but the best part is the fact that they freeze great and work perfect to take for lunch. I like to wrap mine in plastic wrap and then aluminum foil and then freeze.

I was a little disapointed.  I wasn't crazy about the flavour of the beans and spices. I did use black beans but I think it was more the mix of spices I was not crazy about.  Maybe if I used a taco mix from the store to add to the beans it would have been better.  It was ok but I am not addicted...I was really hoping this would be great as we are trying to incorporate vegetarian meals on our weekly menu.  My 3 yr old did not like it at all.  Wont be making it again.

I've been making sweet potato burritos for a while now but this new spin on the recipe really took them to the next level.

This is especially amazing using Sierra Nevada Pale Ale mustard.

These are fantastic and the recipe calls for ingredients I wouldn't have ever considered blending. In our house, we prefer these a bit spicier so I add a little more cayenne than recommended.  They're great with salsa, sour cream, and/or green onions.

This recipe is great for making and storing in the freezer for when you need somethign quick. Not only is this recipe healthy it is delicious too. I like to use Balck Beans instead of Kidney. The first time I made this I made a mistake and mixed the sweet potato mixture with the bean mixture, (you are supposed to layer them seperatley in the tortilla) but it was actually really good that way. It wasn't very appealing to the eye but my taste buds were happy.

Very yummy and the recipe makes a ton! For us Southern folks, I would suggest more spice. They were pretty mild, even for my kids, but we are pretty  used to spicy food.

Sounded awkward, but fantastic flavor combos!  Next time I will definitely food process the beans, as mushing them was not as easy as it seems it should be. I peeled then boiled the potatoes in quarters before mashing, but you could also poke a couple holes in the skin and microwave them, then scoop the flesh out.

Liked the sound of this recipe, made it as written, liked it but then made it with a few changes others may like also..
Diced onion, garlic and 1 jalapino all the same size with veggie chopper. Cooked in canola oil until soft, add 2 cans black beans drained, only 2T chili powder along with the cumin, 1T of mustard, omitted the cayenne but added 1T of cilantro along with the soy sauce. Diced the sweet potatoes in the same dicer added 2 cups of chicken broth instead of water to them and cooked in microwave until just getting tender...Added to bean mix and cooked until most moisture has evaporated then rolled with cheese and baked as directed...YUMMM

These were tasty, but it took so long to cook the sweet potatoes (baked in the oven), that I will probably not make them again unless I have leftover sweet potatoes from another side dish. Does anyone have a suggestion for a faster way to cook sweet potatoes? I liked the spice combination. I'll save the recipe, but it won't be an "absolutely-must-have" for the menu rotation.

Very tasty though not what I was expecting.  I wish there was a touch more sweet potato than bean mix in each burrito.  Used black beans and made 1/2 a recipe.

I love this! I would have never thought of mashed sweet potato with beans in a wrap. Its great!
I used black beans and partially mashed them as well.
We had some left over shredded spicy chicken so I added some of that to the wrap as well before baking. But I have since had these without meat and they're still great.

Wow, these were a hit!  My 11 year old daughter is veggie, husband does not like beans,  and other daughter is  8 and sometimes picky, but all voted "make again" on these!  I cut in half just in case they did not fly, but will make more to freeze next time!  I put a lot less chili powder.  Was that susposed to be teaspoon?

I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this recipe.  Aside from greatly reducing the number of servings, I made this exactly as written.  I used one can of kidney beans, 1 large and two medium to small sweet potatoes (microwaved until soft, peeled and ran through a potato ricer).  For the spices, I reduced the serving number to 4 on the site and used those amounts (plus a little additional soy sauce).  I only had medium sized tortillas so I rolled them to the size of enchiladas and ended up filling a 9X13 pan.  My reductions made a meal for two with enough leftovers for my lunch.  Next time I will toast the spices for a couple of minutes with the onions and garlic prior to adding the beans and potato to develop the flavors.  I would definitely recommend giving this recipe a try!

So good they don't need the cheese.  Everyone I've served these to love them too -  I smother them in Franks Red Hot sauce - mmmmmmm.  They also freeze like a dream.  Wrap them individually in plastic wrap, then cook for 4 minutes on high (turn over half way through).

We love this recipe! I make a big pot of black beans which we eat fresh the first night and then I use the leftovers for this recipe. I always make extra and freeze the leftover premade burritos. We aren’t vegetarian, but i am happy to have a healthy non-meat dish my kids love! I leave out the cayenne because my kids can’t handle spicy food. They get excited when we have this and are happy to have a yummy standby in the freezer.

I just made a bunch of these to help me survive the first week back to taking and teaching classes; so far the verdict is pretty good, though I don't know if I'll feel the same by Friday. I really should have splurged for the larger flour tortillas instead of getting the 39 cent little corn ones. Instead of packaged burritos I have little containers of sweet potato tacos essentially.

I was so excited to try these based on the reviews, but I just wasn't crazy about them.  The sweet potato was almost too sweet in contrast with the other ingredients.  I will say, though, that the kids liked them more than me.  If you make this, use larger tortillas - 10 inch was too small to roll well, either that, or make more than 12 of the 10 inch size or you will have way too much filling leftover.

I have made these three times already, but have modified the recipe slightly - I placed two sweet and one baking potato in a ziploc bag, closed partially and microwaved to save time.  I used black beans and kidney beans because I love black beans and I omitted the soy sauce and added green salsa instead.  I didn't bake them at all either.  When I wanted to eat them, I just heated up a small portion and put it in a warm tortilla. Yummy!!!

So good! I used 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of black beans, and they came out so good. I will never buy canned refried beans again and will just make them using part of this recipe.

These got better and better the longer I ate them. I don't know if I had hit the cheese or what but they were really good.  I didn't use as much spice as it called for which was a mistake so use as much as it says.  Also I think 2 cups of water was a little too much.  One cup would have done fine.

Yum!! I don't know what I thought, but I never thought these would taste as good as they do. I changed the recipe a little, just to fit what I had in the pantry. Mashed up some kidney beans, because I only had one sweet potato. Then added whole black beans. Running low on the spices I needed, so I just added my favorite hot sauce. Haven't baked these up yet, but the one I tasted was so delicious!

EDIT: After looking at this recipe again, I'm a little confused by the portions that the recipe calls for. I guess I only made 8 burritos, but I used one can of white kidney beans, mashed, and one can of black beans, whole. Plus ONE large sweet potato, which was about 1 1/2 cups. I'm not sure why you'd need so much filling as this was more than enough for 8 tortillas and I imagine could have filled 12. Still a fabulous recipe though!

These are excellent. The sweet and spicy flavors go well together and they are easy to make and super healthy. I will be making them again. 

One complaint: two cups of water seemed a bit much. It took awhile for the water to boil off so the beans could thicken back up and I'm not sure the result was much different than if I had used less water. I'll be trying that next time. Otherwise, a perfect recipe.

I liked these but my family did not.  This is a great alternative to meat and so handy to freeze for quick lunch/dinner/breakfast. Have a TON of sweet potato left overs -so will be making some sweet potato bread and sweet potato french toast!

Overall, these were pretty good. I think the bean mixture could have used a little more flavor. I used fat-free cheddar cheese, which tends to be a little bland, so that probably didn't help either. I think next time I will add a little cinnamon to the bean mixture to make the spicy flavors pop. Thanks for a good base recipe!

I love these!  They freeze really well and make for great week-day lunches.  Last batch I gave half to my mom and she is raving about them.  I make as the recipe is written, but am never very precise with the ingredients, and they always turn out good.

Amazing with black beans. I kept the texture a little lumpier, served with salsa, and kicked up the spices quite a bit. Yum!

I think this was okay. 

I think mixing the beans with the sweet potatoes would have produced a better outcome with taste. If I try this in the future, I will do that. Very filling

I rate these a 5 but only if you use black beans. Also good with pepper jack rather than cheddar. A good salsa on the side is a must! They truly are quite addictive.

My fiance and I really liked these. Four stars because we used black beans instead of kidney like other reviewers said. We also didn't mash the beans, but left them whole. Quite tasty and filling.

These are super yummy! I would like to find some way to put more veggies in them without changing the flavor too much. I guess I can just eat them on the side. So good!

I made this recipe recently as a starter for a dinner party and it went down a treat.  However there was way too much chilli powder for the irish palate unfortunately and I had to scramble big time to rescue it when I tried it initially as there was no way we could have eaten it - I actually partially rinsed the beans in a sieve with fresh water to remove alot of the chilli-heat.  If making in UK/Ireland (or anywhere you're not used to eating "rocket-fuel" )- I'd suggest you start with 1 tsp of chilli powder and work your way up! Gorgeous recipe though and I will definitely make again (... with a qtr of the chilli powder recommended!!).

I love sweet potatoes- I'm always looking fo rnew ways to use them. This recipe is creative and it tastes great. My only suggestion would be adding something a little crunchy for some texture. Overall, love them!

made with black beans as everyone suggests and this is DELICIOUS. i thought the ingredients were weird and i thought 2 cups was too much water but it all worked perfectly. i used dijon for the "prepared mustard" because it's what i had on hand. i will definitely make these again.

I accidentally used no-sodium beans which gave it little flavor;  I had to add a can of black beans and  about a teaspoon of sugar substitute.  That seemed to do the trick.  And yes, these are addictive!

Yum!  Very healthy and relatively easy dish.  I only used about half the water with the beans for fear they'd be too runny.  Also, although 3 tablespoons of chili powder seemed like a lot, the beans were flavorful, but not too spicy.  My 2-yr old loved it!  This recipe makes a lot so next time I will probably make half a batch for the 3 of us.

To say we love these would be an absolute understatement!  I made only minor changes due to personal preference...omitted the mustard and subbed low sodium black beans for the kidney beans.  These are TRULY addictive!!

These were very good, but the sweet potato was just kind of a sided after thought, all the flavor is in the beans and it is good without the sweet potato, but interesting way to eat a sweet potato. I have tried the sweet potato mixed in as well and I like it this way better.

This was very tasty and really easy to prepare. I made it as a layered casserole with corn tortillas and it was great.  (I got the idea from a suggestion in an earlier post.)

These were good, but a little bland for my taste, even with the addition of some frest diced jalapenos.  I would also recommend not mashing the beans to give the burritos a variety of texture.

My family and I liked but didn't love these. I followed the recipe but cooked the bean mixture longer to get rid of the watery consistency. My husband added lots of jalapenos on top of his, and my daughter added green peppers! I think next time I'll add some peppers or even green chilies to the onions as I saute them. Also, used a few corn tortillas after running out of flour ones and they were even tastier, I thought.

Although my family did NOT like these, I thought they were very good.  And even better the next day....lucky for me, since I'll be eating all the leftovers.  I did only use 1 cup of water in the bean mixture, and it worked very well.

Very tasty!  I had to add extra water and probably ended up with the full amnt of chili powder.  Also about an extra tsp of soy sauce and extra cumin, a bit of salt and pepper.  Painted a bit of olive oil on top before baking and served with yogurt and green onions.  Seth, Chloe and Dad REALLY liked a lot, I liked them as well, and Liana did OK.

Wonderful recipe and easier than I expected.  I did miss read the directions where it reads "stir in beans and mash" I thought it meant to add the mashed potato.  So.. it was a bit watery and the beans were not mashed, but my husband (the dedicated carnivore) loved this dish and I can see myself cooking it once or twice a month.

Faaaantastic!  I used 1 can of re-fried black beans and and 1 can of regular black beans that I rinsed and mashed slightly before cooking them all together with a handful of frozen corn.  I also halved the seasonings that went into the bean mixture and only added as much water as I wanted.  Served with sour cream on the side.

Was a bit hesitant at first with the sweet potato but ended up making them and couldn't stop eating them! My family loved them. So delicious!

Honestly, I just didn't think this combination was appetizing. I was disappointed after so many good reviews that I really just didn't like it. And I followed the recipe exactly.

These are really delicious. I love the sweetness of the potato with the savory from the beans.  I used black beans.  Love this recipe!

I've had this recipe saved for over a year, I was scared to try it.  Finally bit the bullet, and I am so glad I did!  It was great!  I doubled the recipe and froze half...the were both sooo good! I would use less water in the beans though, ours were a little watery

Tasty. Husband didn't like them so much but he's not a fan of sweet potatoes. I loved them. I used black beans because I didn't have kidney beans.  They are addicting. Though people not used to vegetarian dishes may find the texture a little weird. Next time I'll add some curry powder next time and some red pepper powder for a different kind of spice.

These are amazing! I was surprised at the quantity that this recipe makes! There's enough there to fill a lot more than 12 burritos! This is certainly a recipe I will be making over and over again. It's so simple and easy, and tastes wonderful! I did add quite a bit more spices to this recipes, and did this during the first stage of cooking the onions and oil.

these weren't as good as i was hoping but maybe i just need to try it again and make them better. i was out of cumin, so that may have been part of the problem. they didn't have enough flavor and i tasted too much of the sweet potato. my son didn't like them but my husband did. i will give them another try. they weren't bad, just weren't really good.

I was really excited to try this recipe because I love sweet potatoes and I love black beans, but this was not fantastic. I make better black beans and sweet potatoes by themselves. Probably won't make it again

So good, so easy but a little time consuming to cook the sweet potatoes, etc. Used 2 huge sweet potatoes & it came out to the 4 cups called for, so that was lucky! Used 3 cans of kidney beans, 1 can of black beans (ran out of kidney beans). Will make again! Whole family loved them!

Great vegetarian meal.  A little heavy on the carbs, so next time should add some more veggies into the burrito.  Black beans were better than kidney beans & I mashed up before putting in the skillet.  Served with greek yogurt and guacamole.  Would have given a 4.5 if possible...

These were great. Left out the mustard and cayenne pepper and cheese. I alo used oil oil instead of vegetable oil and black beans instead of kidney beans. The flavors were really nice and I'm sure I'll make these again.

These burritos were good... I wouldn't say they are addictive though. I used black beans instead of kidney beans based on what other reviewers said... and I also cut the recipe in half. Leftovers were good too!

I thought these made a very good vegetarian meal! The flavor was unique, and very good. (Unfortunately, my husband & son weren't that thrilled with them.) But after I enjoyed them I had leftovers and my pet-sitter ate them & she said she loved them too! I also used black beans as many suggested, and cut down a bit on the amount of beans & water. It still made a lot and they are quite filling! If you enjoy a meat-free recipe that is tasty & healthy, give these a try!

I made these and they were VERY good the first time around and WAY better the second time around! I took one of the other reviewers advice and froze them wrapped in paper towels to reheat later in the microwave. It was a process to make but so worth it! Fantastic!

I was really excited when I found this recipe because I had plans to make a batch and freeze them for lunch at work. I wasn't expecting my husband to even try one because they don't have meat. But to my surprise, he loved them too and ate most of them before I had a chance to bring them to work. I guess that means they were a hit!

These are awesome and also pretty quick. The longest thing was to peel, chop, cook and mash the potatoes!  I was a bit wary of the ingredients added to the beans so cut back mainly on the soy sauce and chili powder as I would rather use more cayenne pepper instead of chili powder next time (for a sweeter taste) and I also used less water. I used the kidney beans as directed but think it would be great with black beans too. So happy with these, great recipe! I also used Kumera instead of sweet potato.

Great recipe!  I added about 1/4 to 1/3 of OJ to give it a little sweet and fruitiness to it.  In my opinion OJ gives sweet potato anything the extra bit it needs

These are awesome!! Although I did change a few things. I used black beans instead of kidney beans and I only used 1 cup of water (2 seems like it would have been way too much to cook down). I also used wheat tortillas and they tasted great, but it was much harder to fold burrito style. I would stick with flour tortillas

so easy, and so yummy.  I made these for my sister first, and then made a huge batch and brought it into to work.  Everyone is a fan!! I used black beans instead of kidney beans, and just seasoned with taco seasoning to make it even easier.  One of my favorite dishes!

A great idea with very basic ingredients that you may have around the house, especially if you have a tight budget. I gave it 4 stars, because it tasted like it was missing something. We ended up mixing ranch and taco sauce for a dip and it hit the spot for us!

These are good. The taste is unique but quite tasty. I made them one evening, baked half of them, and froze the other half (before baking) for easy weeknight dinners. I never would have thought to add those ingredients together (mustard and soy sauce in a burrito??) but it was good. I did sub black beans for kidney because I like them better.

they turn a bit soggy whereas I thought they woukd be crispy./ The filling tasted better on its own than actually inside the burrito.

really tasty even though I was too busy talking on the phone while I was cooking, forgot to mash the kidney beans and mixed all the ingrediants together. I used whole wheat wraps, and would use a tad less chili powder next time.

This was absolutely fabulous. They freeze well, so they're excellent to keep on hand. They would be gigantic with 10" tortillas- we use the medium- sized ones and that is plenty for a meal after toppings are added. Like other reviewers, I used black beans instead of kidney beans and was pleased with the results.

These are really good. I used whole wheat wraps and black beans instead of kidney beans. I prefer the burritos with about twice as much bean mixture as the mashed sweet potatoes. These are also good with montery jack cheese instead of the chedder.

I made this as a casserole, used refried beans and microwaved the sweet potatoes.  The pairing of flavors, especially with the spices sauteed with garlic and onion, was delicious.  Will be a regular at my house.

Like a couple others I wasn't so sure about this recipe, I had to think about it for a while.  After weeks of debate I made them, I have to say WOW!  These burittos were very good, I loved them.  Like others I used black beans and whole wheat tortillas.,

We loved this recipe as is! I was curious about the odd combination of ingredients, but it comes together nicely and tastes fantastic. While cooking, I was concerned that the amount of liquid in the bean mixture seemed like way too much but it turned out fine the way I assembled the burritos. First,  I spread some of the sweet potato mixture onto the tortilla, then added the bean liquid on top of the sweet potatoes, then a little cheddar cheese. After folding them burrito style, I used the leftover bean mixture to pour over the top, then added more shredded cheddar. I served the burritos with sour cream and Near East brand spanish rice. Thank you so much, this was a great recipe Karena! :)

Good, solid recipe- I used black beans instead of kidney and didn't use sour cream at all.  I had no garlic, so I used garlic powder and all turned out well.  I would definitely make these again as they were relatively fast and very easy- the unique combination was very refreshing!

Definitely good, but 3 tablespoons of chili powder was way to much for me.  I only used 2 TB and I was still smoking... eventually watered it down to make it more comfortable!

I spread the sweet potato on the tortilla first. Then I place a lesser amount of bean mix on top of potatoes. A bright note to the texture and flavor.  goog recipe but beans were work.

I loved this recipe! Didn't have the chili powder so used a pinch of red chili instead. I also put the cheddar INSIDE the burrito and baked. It was great with sour cream! Will definitely make this again!

these were amazing! I made them on the weekend and have been craving them ever since! I only had two sweet potatoes so decreased the spices by a little bit, but not much, and I used black beans instead of kidney. seriously delicious, will be making again very soon!

So interesting! I enjoyed the flavor, and one was certainly enough to fill me up! I even used smaller tortillas than it suggests and ended up making more. These are now frozen and I look forward to heating them back up in the near future, when I don't have time to cook!

These are a staple on taco night.  My husband refers to them as crack burritos.  They're seriously addicting and heat well for lunch the next day.  We add a lot of cheese to ours inside the burrito and on the outside and it's great with some hot sauce.

I was a little skeptical at first, but curious to try these. I used black beans instead of kidney beans and THEY ARE SO GOOD! The little heat + cumin flavor is great against the sweetness of the potatoes and they are very filling. Yum yum yum.

I used one large can of black beans and one regular can of pinto beans and one cup of water.  I thought these burritos were pretty good!  They were quite filling and I didn't notice that there was no meat.  My husband and daughter enjoyed them as well.  I baked and froze the extras and look forward to having them soon.

I'm a super picky eater (have been most of my 38 yrs) and so is my son...I wasn't sure if I was going to like these, boy was I pleasantly surprised.  THEY ARE GOOD!  We enjoyed them tremendously!  I took the advice of others and substituted the beans for black ones, and one can of kidney.  Yum!

OUTSTANDING! I used black beans instead of kidney, because I like the flavor better, and I brushed them with vegetable oil before baking - other than that I followed the original recipe.  The spices and seasonings are the perfect complement to the sweet potatoes.  I served with fresh avocado slices and sour cream.  I'll make these again in the near future!

Yummy!  I used 3 cans of beans (2 kidney beans and 1 black beans) and only added about 1/2 cup on water.  I have no idea why you would need to add 2 cups of water!

These were pretty good.  We are not vegetarians, but I am trying to learn to cook a little heathier for our family, so cutting back on meat.  I halved the recipe, made these with black beans and cut back on the chili powder b/c my husband doesn't like things too spicy.  I used one large tsp & will add a little more next time as it was not spicy at all.  I did not tell my husband there was no meat in these and when I asked what he thought he said it was alright but "missing something".  I then told him there was no meat & he said that was what it was missing.    I still thought they were very good & will make again.

I used black beans instead of kidney halved the recipe, but used the spice amounts for the full recipe.  I think there is too much water in the recipe, but that was easily remedied by reducing the mixture down.  The blend of flavors was good.  Next time, I will use Whole Wheat tortillas. Thanks for sharing.

I thought these were very good.  My husband liked them but didn't rave about them.  He is not a big potato fan though.  I will definately make them again though!

I really liked these.  I used whole wheat tortillas and a dried bean mixture (cooked) cause that's what I had on hand.  Alittle less water would have made them less soggy on the bottom.  I mixed the mashed sweet potato into the bean mixture to thicken it cause it seemed too watery.  The total mixture made 13 burritos with extra filling.  Probably could have gotten 16 with less filling, making them easier to wrap.  Very unique taste.

Very good and super easy.  I thought the spices sounded excessive but I followed the recipe and they were spot on.  I served with sour cream and salsa.  I think these would great too with some kind of mole sauce.  Next time.

Interisting twist, turned out really well, will probably omit the beans next time and add more veggies though (just b/c we prefer em' crunchy).

Yummy! Made a half recipe with black beans and no cheyenne pepper but otherwise to the letter and they were soo good! Put some avocado slices with lime spritzed on them on the side and this was one of if not the best recipe Ive gotten from this site. Try it--you wont be sorry. (and Im not a vegetarian)

I suggest this recipe for those who like sweet entrees. I didn't like the sweet potato portion of this recipe (it's not bad, its just a personal preference) but I really liked the bean part and when I make this recipe in the future I will eliminate the sweet potato (I might try it with regular potato).  Changes: I used black beans instead of kidney beans like the others suggested but I didn't have enough so I used 1/3 chickpeas as well. I also only used 1 cup water and used a hand blender to mix the beans/chickpeas/onions/garlic mix. This recipe makes more bean mix than sweet potato so you can't really do half half with each mix.

Like others, I was a bit nervous to give it a try......glad we did.  Somehow I was out of Chili powder so I added curry instead and a little salt (had low sodium soy sauce).  We also added some chopped tomatoes and jalepenos to the beans (cooked them w/the spices) and threw in some cilantro and sour cream with the sweet potatoes.  Layers were sweet potatoes, cheese, slices of avacado, and beans.  It was a nice change from your regular burritos.  Must be catching on, Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives had bean and sweet potato burritos on their eppisode last night.  We'll definately be making this one agian, thanks Karena!!!!

These are AWESOME!  I made them for a girl get together and my husband ate the left overs and loved it so much i made them as dinner again three days later at his request!  I used spicy brown mustard and then siracha instead of the cayenne pepper ONLY because that's what I had.  Made with black beans and kidney beans and both were great!

Wonderful!  The flavours are delicate and unique.  My kids enjoyed it too.  I used mostly black beans like other reviewers suggested and a couple cans of chili beans.  Seemed to work well!

We make this recipe almost every week.  It is awesome!  We put them in low-carb wraps and add turkey sausage, which makes it PERFECT. The meat adds a really unique flavor and it evens everything out.  Unless you prefer the vegan version...I would highly recommend adding all natural turkey sausage.  :)  Thank you THANK YOU.  We pass this on every chance we can!

I always make these with black beans. Great recipe and fun to play aro und with. I've added jalapenos and it's very tasty. I make a sour cream and sriacha (just mix the two) dipping sauce for these and they are amazing.

These burritos were pretty good, easy to make, and filling too. The three of us (my housemates) all thought they were missing something though...we decided steak would probably make it better. We followed the recipe fairly true, and would recommend this recipe as a good basic recipe from which you can easily add some personal touches to.

Wasn't sure my family and I would like these, but we loved them (even my meat loving husband!). My 4 year old and 22 month old gobbled them down. I used black beans instead of kidney beans as suggested by other ratings, and add all the spices in the beginning with the garlic. I will be adding these into my meal rotation!

Absolutely delicous! I used refried beans instead of kidney beans and I mixed the sweet potatoes and the beans together, added a little cilantro and cheese and stuffed the tortillas with the mixture. I forgot to add the soy sauce and mustard, it was fine without it and honestly those ingredients sound a little weird to me anyway.   I froze some of the leftover mixture to use another day. These are definitely a keeper!

Wow, these are phenomenal!!  The kids loved them, too!   When I discovered I only had 2 cans of beans (black and kidney), I followed others' suggestions and added 1 cup of frozen corn.  Will make these again soon!

Not addictive at all. Slightly below average. I think I might  start over and use no mustard or soy sauce, just pinto seasoning and sweet potatoes and all the fixings. Of course salsa, maybe better that way?

I had smaller tortillas and only used about half the recipe. I mixed the surplus mashed sweet potatoes and bean mix together with some cheddar cheese on top and baked them in a small casserole dish at 350F. Both the tortillas and the casserole came out quite well.

Love, Love, Love these! Have made them several times and continue to love them.  I "health" them up by nixing the cheese and using nonfat plain yogurt as a "sour cream".  So good!

Truly addictive. I have over a dozen in my freezer. They're best fresh from the oven, but they microwave well for a very easy and healthy lunch.   I've made the recipe over a dozen times. It is great as is but it is also very forgiving. My favorite version is to make a pot of curry couscous with chopped and sauteed onion and bell pepper added to the couscous. Then add the sweet potato mixture, couscous and cheese to each burritos. Better and healthier than anything at Chipotle. Black beans and corn instead of the kidney beans are fantastic too.

I used Black Beans.  This was an excellent recipe.  I used my food processor to mash the sweet potato.  I also used it on the black beans (used Pulse, in order to avoid over-doing it).

SO GOOD - but it takes a lot of time to put these together! I only changed a couple things: I added the chili powder, cumin, and cayenne with the onion (and some extra vegetable oil) at the beginning to let the flavors mix. I used black beans, but only had 4 cups - it was still plenty!! Next time I won't add as much water - it was a little soupy but that might be because I didn't have enough beans. TRY THIS!

Pretty good. We enjoyed these, but I felt like there was something missing. Maybe some more spice to it, but I'll definately keep this in mind for future dinners.

My husband LOVED this.  I found it to be just 'meh'.  I used black beans because that is what we prefer and cut back on the cayenne a little because of our kids.  Otherwise, I made the recipe as stated.

My husband and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this! I use black beans instead of kidney beans, I mix everything together, and I also chop up a can of black olives and add it to the mixture. I make this every week and we haven't gotten tired of it yet!

Thought I'd give this a try due to all the rave reviews.  I never have been a fan of sweet potatoes, so I probably should have passed this one up.  My husband wasn't very enthused about them either.

The flavours in this are amazing.  I actually deviated a fair bit.  I mixed and mashed the beans {oh ya I used black beans as that's what I had on hand} as directed in the fry pan with all the same proportions of spices.  (made only 4 servings, for myself.) Then put the bean spice mix on top of a Baked Sweet potato, and toped with the grated cheese.    This was Amazing.. I loved it.  Can't wait to eat my leftovers tomorrow.  I will make it into Burritos when I buy tortillas.

These are fantastic.  I highly recommend making these and freezing them for a quick, nutritious, healthy lunch/dinner on the go.  I use whole wheat tortillas, one can of black beans and one can of kidney beans.  Fabulous!

These were really good, even my meat eating husband liked them.  I didn't have kidney beans so I substituted black beans instead. Smothered in salsa verde with sour cream and they are addictive.

These were a great no-meat burrito with plenty of flavor. My kids (12, 9 and 7) even surprised me by liking it. I followed the recipe with the exceptions listed below.I added more cheese than called for (I always do in Mexican dishes). All of the following changes were suggested by other reviewers: I used all black beans, as well as heating the powdered spices in the skillet for a few minutes to release their flavors. Mashing the beans in the skillet with a potato masher makes the job easy. I also made it as a casserole (seemed easier), and reduced the liquid by half. I think next time I'll keep the casserole format, but increase the liquid to the full amount just to see what happens. It was a little dry.

Yum.  I never would have mixed sweet potatoes with mexican flavors with mustard with soy sauce, but it works well here.  Putting it on the monthly rotation.

Sweet potatoes don't show up here much so I used yam and it was an odd flavour with the mexican bean mixture.  The beans were nice but could have used more spice to make up for the yam.  This is very healthy though so will probably make again with some adjustments.

These are so good...I made as written and as others have said the most difficult part is mashing the beans. But they were so worth it! My husband was very skeptical but he loved them and asked me to make another batch so he could take them for lunches. I will definitely use again and again. Thank you!

Very unique but delicious!  The sweetness from the potatoes is unexpected, but works well with the bean mixture.  The only addition I made was to add sour cream to the top.  Very good, will make again for sure! Thanks!

I was highly skeptical - it seems like such an unusual combination of ingredients.  I made them with black beans instead of kidney beans, and they were quite tasty! I enjoyed the sweetness of the potato contrasted with the spices.

These were really good! I took the advice of other reviewers and used black beans instead of kidney. I also mashed them before putting them in the pan, which seemed much easier. I'm giving this a 4 only because 2 cups of water is way too much! It was so runny I had to use a slotted spoon to save the actual bean mixture. Luckily it still turned out delicious. I even put the leftovers over chips (I ran out of tortillas) and it tasted great. I'll definitely make these again.

Like the others, I added one can of black beans in with the two of kidney. I also omitted the second cup of water because I found the bean filling runny with just one cup of water. They were fantastic!

I tried this recipe several months ago and have made it twice since then.  Love the sweet potato and kidney bean combo.  I eat a lot of black beans so the the kidney beans were a nice change from the ordinary.

I liked it, but my boyfriend said it was "okay." I prefered I just put the bean mixture (I used black beans) and tomatoes with cheese and skip the sweet potatoes. I'm always looking for great sweet potato recipes but this one was less than awesome.

I was very skeptical about making these but they turned out wonderfully! The only thing I changed was to halve the water, but I used all the other ingredients as written. Served with sour cream and melted cheese on top, they made a wonderful vegetarian change to our usual burritos.

This was easy to make and everyone loved it!  I used spicy black beans and a chedder/jack cheese combination, definitely delicious and easy to play around with the spices to fit your taste.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

These were really good.  I used black beans instead of kidneys, and added some jalepeno pepper jack cheese to the cheddar.  I also upped the spices.   I cut the recipe in half, and only got 4 good-sized burritos out of the mix (which was perfect for us anyway).

I was curious how these would taste and surprised that I really liked them. I used kidney beans but I think next time I will use black beans instead. They were sweet and I used a little less chili powder than it called for. I froze the leftovers for lunch during the week. I will definitely make them again!

This is a great recipe.  I love freezing them and popping them into the microwave for a quick meal/snack!  I usually use half kidney beans and half black beans.

I loved this recipe. I ended up having to use boxed sweet potatoes only because I did not have the spices I needed, but I figured they would be in the ones from the box. I also mixed the sweet potatoes and bean mixture together at the end. These came out great to me, I will make again, and next time I will do it with the spices and real sweet potates, im sure it will be better. Also, it goes great with sour cream, if you like it that is. Yum!

I used canned sweet potatoes, drained.  For me it made the burritos way too sweet.  Other than that, I loved the mix of flavors.  I chopped and dropped in the pan so my garlic didn't have a chance to burn and the water had a chance to evaporate and thicken the mix.  I just mashed everything with a wooden spoon in the pan.  I also added the potatoes to the bean mixture.  I'll probably try this again and bake/boil the potatoes.

only added about half the water and instead used a can of black beans with the juice. didn't have cayenne pepper so I used Frank's Red Hot Sauce which is made with cayenne pepper and it was awesome- added a spicy flavorful touch.  Wasn't sure why they needed to bake so long though.. 8 minutes was enough and made the tortillas crispy- thought I would've liked them better soft at first but the crispiness was pretty good.  These burritos were absolutely amazing my boyfriend and I loved them so much and can't wait to make them again.. so healthy and good you can't beat it.  Thanks for the recipe- verrry addictive.

The bean mixture was delicious and I will definitely be using it again....but the sweet potato seemed a bit out of place and didn´t necessarily blend well with the spicy beans.

I used black beans and whole wheat tortillas.  They were totally addictive, and froze and reheated just like a regular frozen burrito.  Yummy yummy.  I will definitely be making these again.

The sweet potatoes and kidney bean mixture go well together.  However, there just seemed to be something missing for me!  Only one change to the recipe: I omitted the water as the beans seemed to retain some of the liquid from the can.  Not quite "addictive" for me but the recipe is worth a try for a unique, week night supper!

Not the best. I used a little more spice than called for & they were still bland. I had such high hopes for these, but they really weren't addictive at all. Just okay.

Great recipe! Filling and flavourful. I thought that the texture may be mushy with the sweet potatos and beans, but it was not. The only change I made was black beans instead of kidney and I did not mash the beans. Will make again.

I was hesitant to try this recipe, but it exceeded my expectations! I used black beans because I like the flavor better, and omitted the soy sauce and mustard. The flavor was great, and my three year old loved it! I will definitely make this again!

We love these burritos! My changes: I always used black beans and whole spelt tortillas. YUM! If you're looking for alternative ways to cook with sweet potatoes, try these! tonight!  edit: These can have a mushy texture so I came up with a "corn relish" to add to the burrito to add some crunch to it. It's a great addition to these burritos!!!  1/4 c frozen corn, 2-3 TBSP diced minced onion, 3 TBSP diced bell pepper, 1 1/2 TBSP honey, glug of balsamic vinegar, salt & pepper. Combine in a bowl, let sit while you make the burrito filling, then add to burrito before you wrap it up.

This was very yummy and different.  I was pleasenty suprised that I liked it so much.  I agree with others that it is hard to mush the beans after they go into the pan, I ended up dumping the beans, onion and all into the food processor to mush.  The sweetness of the sweet potato went great with the tangyness of sour cream.  This is definately going into my go-to-dinners cookbook.  I wanted to use blackbeans instead of kidney beans but didn't buy enough, so I used a mix.  It turned out great.

Soy sauce and mustard in a burrito? Sweet potato?  With all the rave reviews, I had to try these.  I'm glad I did.  Really good. I cut the recipe in half.  I used one can of refried beans and only about 1/4 a cup of water and no cumin. After I baked them I served with salsa and sour cream.  I thought they were great and husband said they were good but not great.  I think I will try with a bit less sweet potato next time. I don't try to roll these burrito style. I just fold two sides of the tortilla over the filling and secure with a toothpick.

It was good. At first I didn't think it was all that great, but with each bite it got better. Will make it again. It is quite simple and healthy and a great no meat option.

Perhaps if I would have cooked up my own sweet potatoes and mashed them this would have tasted better. I love the sort of sweet/salty taste. I used canned sweet potatoes and mashed them. My 12 y/o vegetarian daughter ate them, but thought the sweet potato taste made them weird. It made so much that we only did half of the mix as burritos, and used the other half as dip for chips.

Yum!  I followed the suggestions of the other reviews and used black beans, roasted the sweet potatos on a baking sheet in the oven, added cilantro, rice and bell pepper, and Newman's Own pineapple salsa.  Instead of mashing anything, I put half the recipe in the food processor pulsed it a few times, and left the rest chunky.  I also omitted the water.

I made these for an employee appriciation brunch at my restaurant and they were not a big hit.Followed the recipe exactly except for using black beans. The recipe did not sound that great, but the good reviews it got convinced me to give it a try.Just an average run of the mill burrito,have had way better.

someone madethis for me and i loved it so much that i asked for the recipe. The recipe she gave me is exactly like this but it adds ground beef to the mixture- which i also used when i made it. It may sound like an odd combination but it's a great dish

Awesome!  I made a casserole out of this and everyone thought it was DE-LISH.  I added green peppers to the bean mixture and used only half the water. I layered the ingredients (beginning with sweet potatoes) and ended up using 3 tortillas which I cut into squares for easier serving.  I baked the casserole at 350 for 1/2 hour.  Served with a side of "Secret Ingredient Pico de Gallo" and "Churros" for dessert (both from Allrecipes).

Awesome. Haven't tried freezing, but have every intent. The mustard (I just used French's!) and the soy sauce manage to do a decent job of faking a long-cooked taste in a meal that takes maybe 15 mins active time, 40 mins-hour overall (to soften & mash the potatoes). Have not tried freezing, but plan on it.

Addictive is right! I loved the strange but surprisingly pleasant combination of sweet and tangy flavors. My 17 year old son loved them. My husband loved them. I loved them and, most difficult and important in our house, our toddlers loved them. We can't get my two year old to eat anything besides fish sticks, hot dogs and cheese, just about.

Really great recipe. I was worried the mash would taste too sweet but it's very subtle. unless I'm cooking for a large party, I would cut this recipe down in half. I have a massive pot of the filling now. I misread the instructions and mixed the beans with the mash before adding the spices but it works fine together.  I'll definitely make this again and for when company is over!

I love this idea- sweet potatoes in a burrito sounds weird at first, but it is SO delicious.  I make it with black beans- personal preference.  Sometimes, instead of rolling these up into flour tortillas, I'll use corn tortillas and make little pies with them. I mash the sweet potatoes, then I layer one corn tortilla with sweet potato, black beans and cheese, put another tortilla on top and layer it again.  I then bake them at 425 for 7-8 mins until they're a bit crispy. And either way, I always serve this with fresh avocado.

We thought this was not very good. The taste was fine it was just the texture. There wasn't enough difference between the mushy beans and the mushy sweet potatoes. Was not a big hit in our household.

It works perfectly in the oven from frozen. 30 mins wrapped in foil at 350, them 15 mins unwrapped to crisp them up. Better than when I first made them!

I feel on the outside right now but I thought these were okay. I did scale the recipe down to 4 and made 5 burritos. It was the bean mixture that I didn't like. The cumin was too powerful. I will tell my vegetarian sis to try them.

These are the best burritos ever. I skip a couple of steps by simply mashing black beans with mustard and soy sauce, then stir in mashed yams and a couple of handfuls of fresh cilantro.

These burritos are absolutely amazing.  I make them with black beans, due to personal bean preference.  My husband and daughter are addicted and I love that they freeze so well.

My husband and I were really excited about this recipe, unfortunately it fell a little flat. The concept is fantastic, but the recipe needs a little tweaking. We've experimented with some different herb combinations and have tried feta, cottage, and mozzarella cheeses. I would recommend any seasoning or addition that would play up on the savory flavor profiles.

These burritos were awesome, only comment is that I accidentally used an extra 2 cups of beans and the 2 cups of water that the recipe calls for still made the beans a bit more liquid than i would like. I think it should be 1 to 1 and 1/2 cups water instead.  But they were still delicious!

I love sweet potatoes and this recipe defintely doesn't disappoint.  The only changes I made were to use cannelini beans which I prefer to kidney beans (I think it's easier to mash them while still in the can rather than in the pan) and I omit the soy sauce. I have made this recipe several times and everyone has enjoyed it.

Interesting... I love sweet potatoes so I wanted to give these a try.  A different blend of flavors than I'm used to, but tasty nonetheless.  Not going to be a regular, but will likely make them again sometime.

Wow! I would have never thought of putting sweet potatoes in a recipe like this & I am glad I tried it. I stayed true to the recipe with the exception of the kidney beans: I didn't have enough so I used a mix of kidney & black. The potatoes add an unexpected sweetness to the dish & the leftovers were great, too. This is definitely going into my regular rotation of dinners.

I really enjoyed eating these! This recipe is super-easy and delicious.  I didn't have cayenne, but I did have chipotle pepper which I added to the spices for the beans.  As finishing touches, I added sliced green onions and chopped parsley (I would have used cilantro, but I didn't have any on hand).  These were great reheated or even served at room temperature. Thanks for this healthy and tasty recipe.

I followed this recipe completely - with the exception of using black beans like some of the other reviewers suggested.  I didn't care for it much because it turned out a bit bland.  Others in my family loved it.  It seemed like a good idea.  I think it's a matter of personal taste.

It is very hard for me to get my husband to eat anything without meat and he really liked these. It made so much that I had enough for lunch three days in a row! The only thing I changed was that I used black beans after reading other reviews, I also put a little bit more chili powder to spice it up more. We didn't even used the sour cream or salsa. They were excellent! Thanks for sharing!

Refreshingly different. I used black beans and was pleased with the lovely color contrast. I served the burritos with couscous on the side, and everyone in the family thought it was a delicious meal.

Used Yams instead of Sweet Potatoes b/c that is what i had on hand. I adjusted the amount of spices due to using less ingredients and omitted the onion. Added a little milk and butter to the mashed Yams.

These are a big hit with both the sweet potato hater and the spicy food hater in our house!  Just the right combination of flavors to please everyone.  I would cut the recipe in half if you don't want left-overs, because this makes plenty!

Loved these! I used black beans per the suggestion of others. Instead of adding any water I just used all the liquids from the can of black beans. I ended up with a very nice consistency.

I was very leery of this recipe, but decided to give it a try anyway.  I chose this for dinner last night, cutting the recipe in half as there are only two of us in my home.  I figured I'd have plenty left for lunch for a couple of days.  NOPE. My husband ate 3 full burritos, he just kept going back for more.  I managed to salvage enough to make lunch for the two of us today. 

I do think there is plenty of filling that I could have made 8 burritos instead of just 6 the the halved recipe called for.  The filling literally spilled out.  I think I'll try black beans next time. I did it with pinto beans this time, but there is always room for improvement.

We try to do a couple of basically vegetarian meals each week, and this is one I will repeat.

These are delicous!!!  I like serving them with fresh salsa.  I also took the advice from other users and used black beans instead of kidney beans and did not mash them.  My husband loves this recipe too!

I love sweet potatoes, so when I saw this recipe, I had to try it.  We thought it was really good.  Just enough spice.  The only thing I did differently was that I mixed the sweet potatoes and bean mixture together.  We tried them separately on the first run.  My husband and I both thought that they were better mixed together.  Thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe! for a little extra kick you can throw some chopped fresh chillies into with the onions (before the beans and mashing stage). 
I also layer salsa inside the wrap and have sour cream on the side.
they freeze really well too, just wrap individually in foil.

These are truly awesome.The sweet potato makes for something unique and tasty.Sounds strange but the blend of flavors is great.The other reviewers are right, they are great to make ahead, freeze and then micro for a great home cooked meal.  I like them with a few tortilla chips and Newman's pineapple salsa. I also thought that was a strange combination but I tried it per another reviewers suggestion and it's wonderful with the sweet potato taste.

I had high hopes for this considering the unique ingredients. I used canned yams (rinsed to get rid of syrup) and took the tip to mash beans before going into pan. The bean mixture was so watery from 2 cups of water so I added the sweet potatoes to it. (the recipe is not clear). This was a lot of effort without much payback of results. Not planning to make again.

Very good; made with Santa Fe beans (chili powder, kidney and pinto beans). Bought the sweet potatoes in a can so it was easy to mix & I left the beans whole. Very good with corn tortillas, would highly recommend.

Followed the recipe except for substituting black beans for the kidney beans called for in the recipe.  Overall, I enjoyed the burritos, but not enough to justify the work that goes into the preparation.  I probably won't make this one again.

I tried  these out of pure curiosity and they ended up being better than I expected! I followed the recipe exactly other than making a smaller batch and using black beans. I thought the bean mixture was excellent. I will definitely make these again!

Interesting...  I have seen these talked about on the Recipe Exchange numerous times.  After months, I have finally gotten around to making them.  They were really simple to make.  I LOVE sweet potatoes and I love refried beans (I used black beans BTW).  They were ok... Both the Hubby and I felt they were missing something.  We added tabasco and sour cream.  Husband thinks they need meat, but what meat I don't know.  Unless I can find something else to add to these, I probably won't bother making them again.

Gosh, I really was hoping to like this recipe.  Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't used so much sweet potato... that was all I could taste as the dominent flavor.  BF and I ate it for dinner, but have a feeling the leftovers will not get eaten. :(  I'm giving it 3 stars because I do think it has potential as a recipe.

I love these. Couldn't get enough!!! My picky 12-year-old loved them; my 7-year-old hates tortillas and wouldn't try them. My husband thought they were okay, but he's VERY picky. I LOVE THEM!!!

I really liked this recipe, although I did like several others and substituted black beans for kidney.  Next time I will make sure the sweet potatoes are hot when I put the burrito together.

Followed recipe and the flavor was weird. Definitely don't crave these burritos and won't make again.

This recipe was great!  Super easy-the only change I made was to use 1 can kidney beans  and 2 cans black beans.  These are definitely going to be a frequent meal!

Love it! We prefer black beans to kidney beans, they go great with the sweet potatoes. And there are all kinds of ways to play with the spices and garnish. Would be great with grilled onions and extra cheese . . .

I've been making these for a couple years now and everyone just loves them. I bake my sweet potatoes for 2.5 hrs on low before starting w this recipe. (They're usu left over baked sweet potatoes from a previous meal.) Use a potato masher on the beans. I combine the kidney bean mixture and sweet potatoes together before filling into burritos. I also prepare extra grilled onions to fill the burritos. I top the burritos w enchilada sauce and cheese, then bake. Fabulous! Even people who do not like beans enjoy these. Makes a wonderful 'bean' dip too.

This was pretty good but I'm giving it a three because I really felt like the potatoes were too sweet and overpowered everything else. It wasn't a great flavor combo.  The bean mixture was the BOMB!!  I used all black beans but other than that followed the recipe and my son and I were eating them with a spoon out of the pan.  Next time I'll do just the beans with the fixings.  This makes ALOT of food, I had 6 huge burritos so depending on your need you might want to cut the recipe down.

Delicious. I doubted whether or not I would like these but they were sooo good. I made the six cups of kidney beans myself, in the crockpot and then I mashed them using the food processor before adding them into the onions. I only added in 1 cup of water, which in my opinion was not even needed since my beans were already kind of liquidy. I followed the rest of the recipe as stated except I used 2 parts bean mixture and 1 part mashed sweet potato for every burrito. Used whole wheat tortillas and served them with guacamole, sour cream, salsa and stir fried veggies (I used green & red peppers + broccoli). Would make these again, even my picky brother loved these, thanks.

The food turned out AMAZING...but getting there was more difficult than I had planned. I didn't know how much work was involved in mashing sweet potatoes...I put them in the microwave for about 13 minutes, cut them in half, and then scooped out the inside. I also didn't know how many potatoes it would take--I used 5 BIG ones and it was a bit too much. By the time I had finished with the potatoes, I didn't do much bean mashing (I used black beans...like 5 cans.) They were fine not mashed. I don't know why it calls for 2 cups of water...after one the mixture was all soupy! I only put in 2 tablespoons of chili powder because I feared the spiceness, but I should have used all 3. Its wasn't enough spice. Instead of putting together burritos, I just layered everything in a pan: tortilla, beans, potatoes, cheese. I was SO worried about how it was going to taste...BUT IT WAS DELICIOUS. Four girls...and we almost ate it ALL!!!

An absolutely wonderful recipe! My family was a little skeptical of the idea of sweet potatoes and kidney beans at first, but they LOVED them once they were cooked. I would recommend cutting back on the amount of water that's put into the mashed kidney bean mixture; I probably used less than half of a cup. Otherwise, the recipe was great!

At first I was afraid to try this recipe because of the sweet potatoes, but I finally did last night.  It was great, my husband asked for seconds (very unusual as I'm new to this cooking thing).  I sent some leftovers to my mom who enjoyed it as well.  I am very likely to make this again.  Thanks!

This recipe was a little weird.  I liked the flavors,but next time I will add more cheese and use less sweet potato.  It is definitely good enough to give it another try.

These were good.  I was a little nervous about trying them because of the sweet potatos, but I figured I would give it a shot.  I cut the recipe in half and still ended up with 10 burritos, but I think my tortillas were smaller than the recipe called for.  I enjoyed the flavors and served them with fresh salsa a low fat sour cream.  While I thought that they were tasty, my husband has requested that next time, we add some chicken or steak strips for variety.

I want to give this 3.5 stars, it's an odd mixture but at the same time oddly good. I used 1 can black beans and 1/2 can kidney beans. I followed all other directions exactly - they looked great! My family ate them, even my 10 month old, but nobody raved. My husband would like me to keep this recipe and add less potato and more bean mixture thinking it would be a bit better. We'll see!

I would give this 5 stars except the kids hated them.  I forgot to add cheese, it was still yummy.  Thinking about making them and freezing for lunches for ME!  Too bad kids won't eat them.

This is a fantastic recipe. I have made it for my meat-eating friends and they love it. This is also great for me since I cook for myself and I can save the bean mixture and reheat them anytime. Usually I omit the sweet potato for convenience, but it tastes just as good with it.

Very good, I'd add more spice to them next time but I say that about everything lately. 

Will likely freeze the leftover filling for future burritos.

Surprise!  These were really yummy.  A lot of work, but good.  I baked them the first time I made them (for the crispy outside) but if you don't mind a soft burrito, save the time and the pan!  I like this recipe so much, I've even used just the bean mixture for burritos.  So tasty.  Don't leave out the mustard!

I don't often disagree with a recipe rated so highly, and I really, really wanted to like these, but they just were kind of odd. The flavor wasn't bad, exactly (although without the sour cream and cheese it would have been), and we did eat the ones that I made for dinner (I only actually made 3 after my DH tasted the filling). After dinner, I was asked never make them again, and to please delete this from my recipe box...We really enjoy mexican food, and he pretty much said let's just make bean burritos next time because they taste better and are less work. ;-( oh well... I was actually impressed that he even tried them after I told him what was in them - he gets BIG brownie points for that!

These ARE really addictive!!  Like others, I used black beans.  The flavors (and texture) really work well together.  I would have given this 5 stars but even though I followed the recipe, I had way more beans than sweet potatoes when all was said and done.  Regardless, this was great and I will definitely make again!

These were awesome, my whole family loved them.  I substituted the kidney beans for black beans (boiled them, used the food processor to puree them then added them to the pan). Served topped with Newman's Pineapple salsa and they were absolutely divine.

This was a very yummy recipe however we did make modifications.  We added brown sugar to to the onion mix, red hot sauce,  granulated garlic and at the end we also added boiled chicken cut up into bite sized pieces.  Because I bought whole wheat tortillas, they wouldn't fold, we made quesadillas.  This was very delicious!  I would definitely recommend to others!

After all the five star reviews, I had to give these a try. My family wasn't exactly impressed. I made half with black beans and half with kidney beans. We didn't care for one over the other. Other than bean flavor they seemed quite bland. I doubt I will make these again

My family was hesitant at first, but after i made this recipe we had seconds. I have made it like 3 times in the past 2 weeks! I absolutely LOVE it! All you need is a side of sour cream... and Yum!

I made these for a couple of people, two were vegetarians. The vegetarians LOVED them, but the eat lovers seemed to want something more. i thought they were delicious. I used the black beans instead also, and I added the spices in the pan.

My husband is not a huge fan of sweet potatoes, however he loved this recipe, which is the main reason I gave it a five star rating - I also enjoyed the burritos and will definitely fix it again.

I figured beans and sweet potatoes must be complimentary to get such great reviews.  I guess our family didn't "get it". The bean mixture was good, but the sweet potatoes didn't lend much.  Oh, well, it was different.

These were okay...I did follow the recipe exactly and they were very filling! I was definately not wowed by them and probably wouldn't make them again. I have been dying to make this recipe and was kind of disappointed with the result. It was easy and different but not my favorite and I love sweet potatoes.

A little different, but very good. I used black beans instead of kidney, and added a bit of salsa to the bean mixture. They were a big hit!

These were just okay.  I added the spices early when I sauteed the onions to "release their flavor" like others recommended but I still thought it was kind of bland (and I'm not a typical spicy food eater either).  I'll probably make them again, next time doubling the spices and using SHARP cheddar.

I made these last night and they were delicious.  I cut back the recipe a bit since it was just the two of us.  I thought it would be OK with or without the sweet potatoes.  I also tried just mixing the bean mixture and sweet potatoes together with some cheese and dipping tortilla chips.  That was also delcious.  Thanks for the great recipe!

SO GOOD! i made a couple small ones for my 15 month old baby & through them in the freezer. they warm up very well in the microwave. i dip them in a cup of water before nuking them, to keep them from getting dry and crusty.
GREAT RECIPE!

This is worthy of earning a spot in my rotation.  Very filling.  I totally agree with those who recommended that the onion/garlic saute' include the spices as it gives the opportunity for the flavors to blend vs. adding them afterward.  Eyeball the amount of water and decide what works best re the desired consistency.  I scaled recipe to 4 and didn't use all of the recommended 2/3 cup of water.  The other nice thing about this recipe is it's obvious flexibility - I'm going to experiment with other spices.  I added just a touch of curry powder and it was a great addition.  I could make a meal on the bean mixture alone!

These are soooo good. I don't recommend removing from heat before adding spices though, it will be really watery. Add your spices and let it all simmer until you have a nice thick mixture. Also, don't worry about mashing the sweet potatoes, just microwave them and cut them into cubes - I also sprinkle them with a little cinnamon.

Having a newborn baby at home I looked for an easy recipe with ingredients I had on hand and found this one.  The fact I could eat with one hand was an extra bonus!  I totally simplified this recipe due to time contraints and not being able to eat anything spicy at all or else the baby is upset all the next day.  The changes I made to serve 2 adults are: 1 can refried beans with about 1/2 cup of water, 2 sweet potatoes microwaved until soft, cumin, soy sauce, and mustard, I eyeballed the last 3 ingredients.  I warmed the beans, water, cumin, soy sauce, and mustard on the stovetop until warm then added sweet potatoes.  I stirred until blended and put directly into flour tortillas.  Then added a little bit of both cheese and sour cream, rolled them up, and microwaved for 30 seconds.  Husband said was a little bland but he understands why since I am breastfeeding.  For his second burrito I added lettuce and tomato.  We both really love this fast meal and will make again soon.  I liked mine better without cheese.  Thanks to all the other reviewers who encouraged altering this recipe safely.  It would be really hard to mess this one up.  It isn't sweet at all and I only had one pan to wash!

This was AWESOME.  My husband and I thought they tasted like samosas.  I did serve them with a little sour cream.  I can't wait to have these again tomorrow.  The only thing I changed was the amount of water.  2 cups of water sounded like too much to me so I only addded one cup and that seemed to be plenty.  Thanks for this recipe!!

I used a half and half mixture of kidney and black beans after reading the reviews and I thought these were only ok, not as amazing as I'd hope.  I topped them with green onion, sour cream and salsa and that made a big difference.  I froze the remaining burritos and I think they're better warmed up in the microwave than when I first made them and used the oven.

I really thought I'd like these more as I do love sweet potatoes and beans.  I took the advice of others and used black beans and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I think it might've been the soy sauce that threw things off for me.  They were certainly edible though and better reheated.  All in all a nice change from a normal burrito but I wasn't blown away.

Strange...very strange...but also, true to name, they are addictive. I only gave them a four because they are a bit of work for the end result, and because even though I sauteed the spices with the onions beforehand (as suggested by other reviewers), I still found them to be a bit bland. 

One piece of advice is to only add as much water to create the consistency you want. I also used black beans instead of kidney beans, and mashed everything up together.

I decided to make these even though I don't like sweet potatoes. And they turned out really good. I do agree that they need more cheese. And I had a lot of the bean mixture leftover so maybe I did something wrong. So I put them in a tortilla with some salsa. I did add extra cayenne pepper to the bean mixture, and it was really hard to mash them in the pan. But I don't actually have a masher so that could have been the problem.

I was a bit leery of trying this receipe, but we were looking for something a little different in our vegetarian diet and these didn't fail to delight!  I made them exactly as the receipe stated -- a lot of work but well worth it in my opinion.  Next time, will probably make a double batch and freeze half to microwave later for quick, easy meals.  Yum!

This recipe was very nice! Dear husband usually tells me if something is weird, and he actually really liked it.  I used the black beans as suggested by a few previous posters, and also I cooked hte spices with the onions and garlic before adding the already mashed black beans.

I made these today for my daughters to have in the freezer...they are vegetarian and my husband and I are not. I had to try one of course to check seasoning and decide if I would ever make again.  I do not like sweet potatoes but I thought these were delicious!  I was very pleasantly surprised considering how very easily they came together.  I threw black beans, kidney beans and canned cut up sweet potatoes in the food processor and pulsed until it was all mashed but still retained some texture. Next time I think I'll brush the tops with some vegetable oil before putting into the oven to help brown the tops since they were a bit pale.  Excellent recipe.

Great balance of flavor and ingredients.  I ate this for dinner, then lunch, then dinner again and didn't get tired of eating leftovers! The only thing I'll change for next time is adding rice. I'll be experimenting...

I have been making these burritos for a couple of years and think they are wonderful!!  Who would have thought such a seemingly odd combonation of ingedients would taste so yummy.  One of our regulars.

We've been making these for years now and I don't know why I haven't reviewed them before!  They are wonderful and definitely addicting as the name suggests!  Everyone I have served them to has loved them . . . although most of us do agree they must be served with sour cream.  Otherwise, they just seem to be missing something.

Like others, I debated trying this recipe for quite awhile before I decided to try it out for dinner tonight.  It was good and worth making again with a little more tweaking.

I cooked the sweet potatoes with a couple of whole cinnamon sticks that added a delicious aroma and nice taste.  I followed the advice of others and added just enough water from the cooked sweet potatoes to give it the right texture.  I added some pumpkin pie spice, maple syrup and balsamic vinegar to the sweet potatoes and stirred them into the bean mixture.  I served them with cheese, sour cream, cilantro, and a black bean and corn salsa.  I think that next time, I'll leave out the mustard (overwhelming taste) and add more spices.

These were pretty good.  They weren't quite as good as I thought they would be...the sweet potato needed something, it tasted super plain next to the PERFECT bean mixture (so good I'm going to use this recipe on it's own!).  They made so many and were easy to bring for lunch.  They were also pretty inexpensive.  Thanks for the recipe!

We did not care for this. My husband and I have very expansive tastes, but this just missed the mark for us. Had very high hopes, and needed to use up some sweet potatos in my pantry.

I think next time I make this I will add a little more sweet potato and a little less of the bean mixture.  I did 1/2 of each and the bean mixture was overpowering.  I would also cut down on the chili powder because that is all I could taste.  Will try again because I love sweet potatoes, but hope it comes out better with these changes.

Very good and very spicy!  Just the way I like it!  To those who can't stand the heat, simply top the burrito with sour cream as my girlfriend did. I tried it and I have to admit, she was right!  Excellent recipe!

These were really good.  I had to supplement part of the sweet potato with carrot, but it was still good.  I think the prepared mustard gave it an odd tang, so perhaps I'll leave that out, but this was a great way to eat healthily and seasonally.

I loved this recipe.  I added a bit more spices and mixed the refried beans in with the sweet potatoe mixture.  One night I served it as part of a casual dinner with vegetarian friends.  I had a a "burrito" bar that included this filling along with a more traditional beef filling, sour cream, cheese, salsa, chopped tomatoes, etc. Everyone got to assemble their own which was fun for the kids.  Everyone was happy!

Nice contrast of flavors and not too much hassle to make.  Being a beginner I followed the recipe (except for using black beans).  I found the burritos a little bland, but with sour cream and salsa they tasted great.  Next time I will likely add more spice during the prep.  The great thing about this recipe is that you can freeze the burritos and pop them in the oven for weeks.  They taste just as good after freezing.

I made these for my writing group and they were a HUGE hit. I pretty much followed the recipe-- but I did make the sweet potatoes with some butter, a little sugar and cinnamon. They came out wonderful and I had so many extras I sent people home with a couple each (and I have tons left for myself).

I give these 4 stairs only b/c they were a little too labor intensive for me to make often. Peeling the sweet potatoes, boiling them, and then cooking the beans and filling the burritos was a lot to do in my little kitchen!

Cut the recipe in half, and we had to sub 1 can of black beans for kidneys cause we didn't have enough- these came out awesome. A new family favorite- next time we'll probably quadruple (the recipe instead making only half the recipe there were NONE).

These were great, though I don't think they were as amazing as everyone else was saying.  I used black beans rather than kidney beans like others suggested.  These were definitely better after a day or two for lunch.

These were addictive...who would've thought?  I altered this a bit...used black beans instead of kidney.  Sauteed onion and garlic, and added a chopped green chile.  Then I added chili powder, cumin and a little cayenne to the pan, followed by the beans.  I mashed them slightly and added just a little bit of water (maybe 1/2 cup).  Then I added in some cilantro and lime juice.  I did not use soy sauce or mustard (that just sounded too weird).  I served the burritos with a little light sour cream and salsa verde...they were delicious!  THey are definitely going into the rotation at our house.

YUMM!!!  My kids (3girls 6 & under) loved these.  I made them a second time with chili beans...yuck!  Not a good idea!  But when I made them with 1/2 black beans and 1/2 kidney beans...perfect!!!  I love how the sweet potatoes and bean mixture compliment each other!  Very good recipe.

When I made these I didn't tell my boyfriend what was in them for fear he would think they were too "weird". After sampling he said they were great and he was surprised but the ingredients. To tell you the truth I was surprised by how good it was as well.

A seemingly odd combination turns into a beautiful blend of flavors! My husband and I LOVED this recipe. I used Kirby brand black beans, as they are already very flavorful by themselves. Sour cream is a must for this recipe, as it blends everything together nicely. Try it, you'll love it.

These were good, but somehow I expected more of a distinct differance of sweet and savory. I think next time I will maybe add a bit of cinnamon and maple syrup to the sweet potato.

I gotta say I'm not a big fan of this one.  It sounded so good but found it didn't have much taste to it and really didn't thrill me enough to make again.  Sorry!  I really wanted to like it!

Good, but in need of a little more taste, which was easily accomplished by pouring a little salsa over the baked burritos.

These burritos are terrific.  I cut the recipe in half and used other reviewers suggestions and used black beans instead of kidney beans.  They are so filling and rich.  I will definitely make this again.

Loved these!  I used black beans instead of kidney beans and kept them somewhat whole to add texture.  Next time I will try adding frozen corn for a bit of a contrasting crunch.

I used one sweet potato and one can of kidney beans.  Sauteed onions with curry and cumin and added a little red pepper.  Fried the tortillas in oil first, then wrapped and baked for 15 min.  Excellent.

We liked these!  Somehow I had never thought of having sweet potates with cheese, which worked well, especially with all the other flavors.  Made good leftovers too!

These were pretty good - not sure I'd call them addictive, but def healthy and tasty. (And easy) I did use the black bean sub as suggested - next time I might leave the black beans whole, and just mix the bean mix together with the sweet taters before stuffing. It needed a little "something" else, but I can't quite decide what... I'll have to experiment and find out!

A little bland, but good with lots of salsa and sour cream. The cheese gives it the most flavor, but I did like the filling. I love sweet potatoes so I enjoyed trying this recipe! Thanks!

This was OK as is. I didn't have any green onions, and my husband's vegan, so no sour cream. Maybe with that or adding some cilantro or something would have punched it up a bit, but we both agreed that the beans were good, the sweet potatoes were fine, but all together it just wasn't worth a repeat at our table.

These were good, but they didn't 'wow' me.  They could use a little something else.  Maybe a chopped jalepeno pepper with the onion mixture to give it a little zing.  I will make again but also think about what else I can put in it to jazz it up even further.  I served mine with fresh chopped parsley which was good.  Cilantro would've been better.

I made these w/out the soy sauce or cheese (trying to reduce fat, calories, and sodium) and all I had on hand were small whole wheat tortillas. These came out great but it would have worked out better w/ large tortillas...the small ones are hard to roll.

These were delicious and healthy!  The first time I made them, I made the mistake of using canned sweet potatoes in syrup thinking that I could just rinse that off...wrong!  This second time, I used fresh sweet potatoes and they made a world of difference.  We wrapped them in whole wheat tortillas and between that and the recipe as is, we got 46 grams of fiber in one serving!  Watch out now.  This will definitely be a staple in our house.

These were pretty good, very filling, and pretty easy to prepare.  I was  excited to find a recipe that moved away from meat and instead had a healthy alternative like sweet potatoes.  I  used whole wheat tortillas and black beans.  The end reult was definitely different than what I'm used to, but was still really good - and I don't like sweet potatoes very much. I think the only change I would make it to add more texture - it was too smooth inside the tortillas, almost a pureed feel. Maybe next time I'll try mashing the beans less and see if that helps.  All in all a very good recipe - I'll be making this again.

Very, very good.  Per other readers' suggestions, I also used black beans instead of kidney beans.  The combination of the beans and sweet potatoes makes an interesting and delicious combination.  I’m not a fan of sweet potatoes, but these burritos were very tasty- a great way to reap the benefits of sweet potatoes without eating them plain.

We are trying to convert to a more vegetarian diet.  This recipe will really help in the process.  I can see vegetarians really enjoying this recipe.  Also  understand why carnivors would find it lacking.  It is a keeper for our new vegetarian lifestyle. Followed the recipe to the T.

Delicious.  Instead of baking them, I make the burritos with the filling and put a sprinkle of Kraft Tex Mex cheese in the burrito.  I then wrap them up and put them in the freezer for fast and delicious lunches.

I think I may have done something wrong, but these did not turn out to our taste at all. It was overspicy and with an mildly unpleasant texture.

I made some changes according to suggestions by others. I added some fire-roasted green chilis to the beans, and I used black beans instead of the kidneys.  Perhaps could have done without the mustard.  All in all, good...yet strange.

This recipe was simple and DELICIOUS! I don't even like sweet potatoes but decided to try something different and LOVED them. My husband and gals at work really liked them as well.

This was pretty good, but not as flavorful as I would like.  Next time I will double the spices, and maybe add some salsa directly to the filling.

4 1/2 stars. This was very good, not too hard but could use some oomph. I cut the water down to one cup and cut back just a little on the spices, mustard and soy sauce. Next time I will use all the spices recipe calls for.

DELICIOUS!
I made a much smaller batch.
Didn't use any cheese.
Didn't have soy sauce on hand so I added a little bit of salt at the end.
Didn't even bother baking at the end, just spooned into a whole wheat tortilla warmed in the microwave.(Next time I will try baking.)
Wasn't spicy enough for my taste so I added tabasco and jalapenos.
Yummy!

I was a little worried about making these and serving them to my 'meat-eating' husband. They turned out to be a huge hit! My only suggestion would be to really mash down the beans. I didn't like bitting into the smooth texture of the potato to find lumps of bean.

We made these using only half the water called for in the recipe - the consistency was just right.  The spice mixtures were fine for our tastes.  Overall, a thumbs up from the kids and hubby, too!

this was good, for texture I mashed only half of the beans, for flavor I used the liquid in the can instead of water and left out the mustard (because I don't like it).

This recipe caught my eye as it is sweet potato (satsumaimo) season here in Japan.  I halved the recipe and used a can of refried beans in place of the kidney beans.  I was a little worried about the amount of chili powder, so I halved it, and even then it was far too spicy for my husband and I.  I'm not sure about the mustard flavour myself, but my husband had no complaints.  I would make this recipe again, but would definately adjust the spices.

Can't say that these were to my liking.  I made them for my family and one was enough for all of them.  The flavors and textures in this burrito aren't very appetizing.  I won't be making them again.

Pretty tasty and easy. Didn't quite live up to the hype, but I'll make them again. I prepared my beans from dry beans, allowing 2hrs simmering time to soften and then used the water from bioling in the recipe.

Loved 'em!  The addition of the mustard and soy sauce seemed odd, but the burritos tasted great.  I forgot to add the cheese inside the burritos, so I sprinkled it on top with some fresh cilantro.  It made for a great presentation.  I added the full cup of water...you just have to make sure the beans are mashed a bit and cook 'em long enough to absorb the water.  I used sweet potatoes (not yams) and added them to the bean mixture before filling the burritos.  Because I was skeptical of the recipe, I only made half (which made 8 burritos).  Next time I'll make the whole amount!

These were really good, our family is trying to incorporate more veggie meals and this one was truly tasty, fast and easy.  I ground the bean onions and garlic in the food processor to save time and energy and provide a nice texture.  Thanks for this recipe.

I really liked this but agree with some of the others that it was alot more work than I thought it would be.  Also, I think I used too little sweet potato, but they still came out pretty good.  Also, I made the 12 yield, but ended up with 20 burrittos!!

These were good, but I was hoping that the sweet potato taste would be a little stronger.  I used canned sweet potatoes, so maybe the real thing would be better.  But I really liked the combination of flavors, especially the soy sauce!

yep. REALLY GOOD. I'm going to have to make these often. I added more cayanne because i'm a fan of spicy food. Had no cumin(for some reason), not a big deal. Make these if you want something easy, delicious, filling and flavorful. Not for people who like bland food.

Great great great!  We make this recipie at least twice a month and love it.  It is quick and easy and very tasty.  I agree with the others to reduce the amount of water to 1/2 cup.  Enjoy!

this recipe blew my mind.  there is a fantastic restaurant in my town called The Prickly Pear that serves fun variations on southwestern cusine, and this recipe would fit perfectly on the menu.  it's definitely of equal quality, but you can make it at home!

This is yummy.  Surprisingly, the cheddar cheese and sweet potatoes taste great together.  I cut the recipe to make 4 burritos and used one can of kidney beans and 2 medium sweet potatoes.  It was great reheated for lunch the next day.

These are _fab_ burritos.  I had originally been looking for a sweet potato recipe besides "candied sweet potatos".  When I came across this one I had to try it.  It rocked.  Seriously great burritos- the colors too! They even LOOK cool. This recipe really spiced up what would have been an ordinary weeknight dinner (they're easy to make too!).

this was a good idea, as i love burritos and LOVE sweet potatoes.  I improvised a little bit with corn in the beans and sour cream in the potatoes.  It was wonderful.

Sounds funky, but so yummy!! I found this recipe searching for something to make for my vegan sister.  It's SOOO delicious!  My husband is definitely meat and potatoes, but even he loves this one.  I've tried different kinds of beans and it turned out just as great- though I did try canned sweet potatoes and didn't like it quite as much.  They freeze great and always get raves.

I first tried this recipe a few years back, and thought it was a nice change of pace from usual vegetarian fare. Since then, the beans from this recipe have become a staple in our diet. I serve them with regular burritos, over rice with cheese, onions, salsa and sour cream, as an accompaniment for fajitas, and also as a base for homemade chili. Any combination of light or dark kidney beans or black beans can be used.  I always get raves.

Very unique!! I loved these and so did my boyfriend who thought he hated sweet potatoes (I tricked him..haha). I added butter and salt and pepper to the sweet potatoes before I added them to the burritos. Good left overs too!! yum yum.

My roomate thought I was crazy when I made these, but soon she was raving about how good they are! Great combination of different flavours. A half recipe works really well, and I would suggest omitting the water, as the filling is smooth enough without any added liquid, as suggested by other reviewers.

I don't know.  I was very excited to try this recipe and it certainly was ok - but not great, imho.  I added extra spice to it to try it give it some more pizzaz, but it was too bland for us.

It was still good, with salsa & sour cream, but i'm not sure I'd bother to make it again.

I used 1 can of fat-free refried beans and one can of black beans.  I also cut the sweet potatoes into small chunks and roasted them instead of mashing.  (I'm a lazy cook at heart.)  These are delicious and have become a staple at our house!

I have made this meal dozens of times.  We all love it.  We eat them as tacos instead of baked burritos because it's faster.  Stab the sweet potato a few times and stick it in the microwave for a few minutes, warm up homemade frozen black beans and this becomes very very fast and excellent.  We usually just have them with salsa, sour cream, and cilantro instead of the soy sauce mix, for a more traditional taste.

these were pretty good...but when you got a bite of just sweet potato it was kind of weird.  maybe it would have been better if there was some spices or something added to the sweet potato part, it was sorta boring

These were awesome! I love sweet potatoes and I love burritos, so these were great. They weren't really like burritos in the traditional sense, they were more like a delicious concoction in a tortilla. I didn't follow the recipe to a T  - I didn't have enough kidney beans so I added in some romano beans and black eyed peas that I had on hand. I also played with the spices/seasonings a bit to suit my tastes.  I served it with low fat sour cream on top. Delicious & nutritious!

Very good.  My 4 yr old didn't care for them.  I don't think she cares for cumin, so I'll leave that out next time and add enchilada sauce over the top with some cheese.  I'm sure she'll eat them.  Hubby and I thought these were great.

My first attempt to make burritos, and what a success! These were so delicious! I served them up with a bit of sour cream and spicy guac- mmmm! I made a huge mess in the kitchen though, which probably could have been avoided by being more prepared and organized. I found I had to add extra water to the bean mixture because it thickens up very quickly. My SO who dislikes sweet potatoes really enjoyed this- he said the taste blended well and wasn't too overpowering. Will make this again!

These were fabulous! I substituted black beans (2 cans) for the kidney beans, made 12 burritoes and froze 6 of them. A month later, we defrosted and ate them, and they were still excellent. Any recipe this healthy and "freezeable" goes into my permanent file!

These are so healthy and tasty, it's hard to pass them by.  I'm always happy to find recipes that use sweet potatoes in a savory way.  I used black beans per previous reviews and Queso Blanco.  The seasoning in this recipe was fine, but not as punchy as we would have liked.  Will try adding chipotle chilis in adobo next time.  Thank you, Karena!

My husband and I both loved these burritos.  They froze well, and were great as leftovers.

Thisis the first time I am making a burrito. I was very skeptical and wondered if my husband would like it. Nevertheless, I followed the recipe (only reduced the amount of chilli powder as I had some hot chilli powder from the Indian store. I used black beans instead of kidney beans, did not add garlic as a personal preference. Added some lemon juice in the end. )Served it with hot salsa and sour cream on wheat tortillas. It was great and easy to make dinner. My husband said that he would like it if I made it again. Good recipe.

These were great!  I took the advice of many reviewers and made them with black beans.   I also added one small can of diced green chilies.  It added a little bit of flavor but was not to over opowering.  I also used whole wheat tortillas and they were great.Like one reviewer said get extra tortillas because the filling will fill alot more than just 12 tortillas, I actually got 24.  My sister who is vegan loved them (I mader her a few without the cheese).  Thanks for the great recipe.  I will definatly make again and they are a great food to make and put in the freezer and to talk in lunches.

The bean mixture was good.  Mixed with the sweet potatoes was just too much!  Also, the chili flavor made me think of...well...chili.  So I used the rest in a vegetarian chili.  It was great!

This is my husband's and my new favorite... the instructions were a little confusing (whether to add the sweet potatoes "mash?" to the beans , or to try to mash the beans??)  In the end we put it all together and they really were "addictive" even as leftovers! :)

interesting- I wasn't sure if I would like it, but because it sounded healthy, I tried it.  Not on my top favorite list, but as far as nutrition and convenience are concerned (thanks for the advice to freeze them for future lunches) this definitely works.

This was a major hit at my house.  My husband dislikes sweet potatoes - and he loved it too.

It made me realize I could eat vegetarian and not even miss the meat (or chicken).  I did have difficulty mashing the beans.  And, I used buena vida fat free tortillas, which evidently were not big enough because I had a lot of filling left over.  Additionally it was not possible to fold them due to the smaller size.  So I spread the leftover filling on top of the tortillas and sprinkled extra cheddar over everything.  Really it was more like I made the recipe into enchiladas.  But we will be eating this meal regularly.  I would recommend to anyone.

Yummy recipe. I don't eat meat so this was the perfect recipe for me. Mashing the kidney beans wasn't much fun, but the result was a delicious burrito, although I did add some extra spices to the beans for flavouring. It made at least 12 meal sized burritos, perhaps more. I wrapped and froze them individually and microwaved them as needed for a quick lunch or dinner. Will definitely use it again!

Love at first bite. Who knew that sweet potatos and black beans mix so well together! The black bean mixture alone is *excellent*. They freeze so well too. Perfect to have for dinner and then lunch a few days later. This recipe goes in the "keep forever" section.

Good stuff! I quartered the recipe and still got six burritos - although I did use smaller tortillas. I thought the flavor was missing that extra "something," but regardless of that, it's a yummy, satisfying meal - definitely a keeper.

Maybe I should have scaled it down but 12 burritos was too overwhelming.  We'll have leftovers for weeks!  I also need to learn how to fold burritos (for a Californian, I should be much better at this!)  My family was less than thrilled and they're usually pretty easy to please!  TOO MUCH WORK FOR TOO LITTLE REWARD.

We are trying to incorporate more vegetarian dishes into our diets and this recipe is a winner.  It is filling and delicious.  I love that you don't have to really measure.  I make it a little different every time and it is always good.

These were excellent!  I made them for a vegetarian potluck, and EVERYONE wanted the recipie (even the non-vegetarians!).  You can hardly taste the sweet potatoes, yet they add a great texture and makes them very filling.  Give them a try!

Though this was fairly easy to put together, the end result left a lot to be desired.  My 3 year old wouldn't go near it, and my husband, who eats anything, took one bite and then ate soup and salad for dinner.  Definitely NOT a keeper.

I loved this recipe for being something different and for being a good meatless dish.  It was a little bland, but sometimes that is nice for a change and it could easily be spiced up.  Couldn't get my 2 year old interested in it though.  Everyone else liked it!

These were alot of work.  We didn't care for the flavor.  They weren't terrible but just didn't fit our tastes.  They may be better with black beans.  Salsa and sour cream made them alot better tasting.

I tried the recipe with refried beans- It was not so incredible.  It tasted like a regular burrito.  Next time I will try regular black beans.  The tip about microwaving the sweet potatoes was a huge time saver.  Thanks.

My husband actually loved this!!  That means it's a good recipe.  I'll make a few changes next time I make it though...I'll mix the potatoes ans the beans together and puut more toppings inside the burrito for extra flavour.  But this is definitely a keeper!

I'm in love! Great recipe! Easy to pull together (with a side of saffron rice, perhaps), and great for preparing ahead of time. A few tips to make it even easier: Microwave the sweet potatoes until soft (about 15 minutes), then just scoop them out onto the tortillas. I have also substituted  refried beans when I ran out of kidney beans. No mashing, and they give it a slightly different flavor and texture. I have a freezer full of them right now for quick lunches and dinners.

I really enjoyed these and so did my vegitarian daughter.  It wasn't quite a winner with my husband, though texture of food is a big issue with him.  He said it was too mushy. 

I really enjoyed the flavors and I know I will make this again, when Daddy is working.  :)

These burritos were great.  My husband loved them.  I used black beans instead of kidney (easier to mash) and I ended up not needing to add ANY water to the beans.  I cut down a bit on the mustard as well.  Other than that, I made no other changes and they were great.  A fabulous vegetarian meal!  Thanks!

This recipe is AWESOME!  It's so easy to make, great frozen then reheated.  Don't be fooled by the seemingly large number of sweet potatoes and beans you'll need.  It's correct.  Fantastic easy recipe.

Very tasty - makes quite a few burritos, so better for parties of more than two, I'd say.

Excellent! The flavors where unusual together, and a perfect blend. I used whole wheat tortilla's and they tasted great. There certainly where not any left to worry about freezing.

The adults and kids in the family really loved these.  I became frustrated mashing the beans--so may use already mashed refried beans next time.  Also, too watery, so I just mixed the potatoes with the beans before spooning onto the tortillas.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The sweet potato balanced out the spicyness of the black beans perfectly. My husband didn't care for the sweet potato though. So I will make his with just black beans next time. I halved the recipe and it made 8 burritos.

I've made this recipe twice, and liked it a lot.  I substituted black beans for kidney beans, and it was great.  Also the original recipe calls for too much water.  

The sour cream and salsa really round out the flavor in the dish.  I prefer a tart green salsa to offset the sweet flavor.

I'm turning over a new leaf by eating better.  Have also included my roomate and 16 mo. old son.  They both loved this recipe as well as myself.  Great flavor and easy to make.  Even the leftovers were good the next day!  Would highly recommend this recipe.

I liked the recipe.  I didn't try it on my husband or kids, because none of them like sweet potatoes.  I cut them in half and freeze them, and they make a nice, filling no-meat lunch.  I used canned kidney beans, drained, and the amount of water was right.  Had to use canned yams, because no fresh were available.  I haven't tried canned re-fried beans, but I don't think the taste of sweet potatoes would go with pinto beans as well as with kidney or black beans.

I certainly like these baked to a crisp in the oven prior to eating!  And wow, are they filling!  Made a ton really easily and will try them after being frozen to see if taste is as good.

I added a lot less water when I made it, and also a LOT less chilli, I thought 3 tablespoons was a little much! But apart from that it was delicious, I'll definitely be cooking them again!
