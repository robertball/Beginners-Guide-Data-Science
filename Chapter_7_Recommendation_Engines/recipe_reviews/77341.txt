This was phenominal!  I had people in pain, it was so good that it hurt! For the crust I used half a cup of oats, a quarter cup of crushed graham crackers and a quarter cup of shredded coconut (dessicated coconut).  I also sprinkled the top layer with coconut along with the walnuts.  Fantastic! The gooey layer of condensed milk is a taste that can't compare with anything else.  OBVIOUSLY I will make these again and again and again....  **Note: be sure to grease your pan well

So easy to make, so delicious, and looks great on a cookie tray! I followed the recipe exactly...but to make things easier, I lined my 9x13 pan with foil and sprayed generously with cooking spray. I ground up the walnuts for the crust in my food processor. Once the bars came out of the oven, I sprinkled on the choco chips, then put back in the oven for less than a minute, this really helped melt the chocolate and made it easy to spread. Also, I topped my bars with toffee brickle bits instead of nuts. One more helpful hint - I had trouble getting my chocolate to set, and you can't cut these until the chocolate has hardened. Once the bars have cooled, place them in the fridge for about 30 minutes to set the chocolate, then cut. I cut mine into triangles...so pretty. Thanks for a great recipe that I will make again! Everyone thought these cookies were delicious!

These taste delicious, but were a little thinner/flatter than I expected.  I think next time I will double the caramel layer so you notice it more.  As it is the chocolate kind of overwhelms the toffee flavor.

Major yumminess!   They're very rich.  I cut them into small bites just big enough to pop into your mouth.  I think only about 1 1/2 cups choco chips are enough.    But really, how can something have too much chocolate?  ;-)

These were very good, but I would use milk choco chips next time.  It was just too much with the semi-sweet (and I only used 1.25 cups, not 2).  The chocolate kind of "hides" the caramel.  I put this in a 7x11 instead of 9x13, which worked very well.  Otherwise it would have been too thin (thanks to reviewers who pointed this out).  My condensed milk kind of curdled too on the stovetop, but it turned out ok.  I used whole wheat pastry flour and rolled oats.  Next time, I would omit the nuts on top.

The end result was delicious but I encountered some problems while making these bars. First off, I don't think I baked the crust long enough and I think I might have over cooked the condensed milk as it started to almost curdle and then when pouring it over the crust, there was not enough so I ended up using two cans of condensed milk. Overall the ended up tasting awesome especially for those that love the condensed milk gooey-ness. They were baked for my family reunion christmas party and I ended up getting lots of compliments and they were devoured fast.

I followed the recipe to a T and this is not something I will make again. I lined the pan with tin foil and also sprayed the foil and they are a mess to get out. They are very rich and almost like candy bars but too rich for me.  The 7 layer bars are so much better and I felt this was a waste of ingredients. Sorry.

Very, very good and rich!  I let the crust cook a little too long and the edges were hard.  I set my timer for 10 minutes and that seemed a tad too long...so maybe closer to 8 or 9 minutes next time.  I loved the condensed milk layer.  Definitely for those who have a major sweet tooth.

this is the exact recipe that I have been trying to get from a friend but always forget to ask. A couple things to remember, though...the milk does NOT take 15 minutes, more like 5 and to keep the chocolate flavor from overwhelming it, I like to just sprinkle the chips, keeping their shape and not spread them. Thank you Eagle!

I HAVE USED THIS RECIPE FOR OVER 15 YEARS. IT IS THE BEST. I have varied it by using white chocolate chips and drizziling milk choclate on top.

I made this bar the first time today.  When they tell you to press firmly in the pan, be careful how much you press it down.  It got so hard, I had a hard time getting it out of the pan.  I sprayed the pan beforehand, as was told, but also floured it.  That usually makes for easy removal.  It didn't help.   I used chocolate chunks because I didn't have a full bag of chips.  If you like chocolate, you'll like the chunks.  Also, next time I make these I will do the bottom 1 1/2 times, i.e., 9 tbsps. of margarine or butter, 1 1/2 cups oats, 3/4 cups brown sugar, etc.  I found the 14 oz of sweetened condensed milk (step 2) enough, unlike another review.  I did add extra nuts to the top too.  It's a good bar!

I really wanted to like this recipe but its too rich and sweet for my liking. I followed what many reviews said by putting less chocolate chips in recipe and yet the chocolate was still overbearing. Well my grandma loves it so I guess Ill make this for her but it wont be something I'll make for myself.

This is most definitely the 8X8 recipe, not 13x9. It ended up so thin that I ended up cutting & stacking them. Tastes fine, but it really thin and looks like a mistake unless they're stacked. 

If I make it again I'll either double the recipe or press them into an 8x8 instead.

I must have done something wrong?? I followed the directions exactly but I really don't think they turned out very good. The crust is mushy and gross. My Mom's recipe is much better than this. I'm disappointed :(

These were FABULOUS!  I made them as a gift for my secret Cupid at work.  He was so excited to get a homemade treat.  He ate them all right away.  Couldn't get enough.  Of course I saved some for myself.  So delicious!!!!!

Verrry good. All of the aspects of the recipe mixed together wonderfully. It was very thin, though and I might double the recipie for the filling and bake it longer. Either that or use less chocolate chips as the chocolate flavor somewhat took over. I followed the recipe exactly and don't regret it, though. It was still amazing. I'm making this for a friend in the hospital. Hopeshe likes em! They sure loook good :D

It doesn't get much better than these!  They are absolutely fantastic, fast, and easy to make.  I use 1/4 cup of flaked coconut in the crust like another reviewer suggested and nummy!  A definite keeper.

I loved the crunchy texture of these bars and they tasted good, but I found the toffee layer got kind of lost between crust and chocolate. Next time I will probably double the toffee part and/or reduce the chocolate chips.

Baking/ cooking  times were a little off for me. Each step took about minutes less. The only substitution I made was using a scant 1/2 cup pecan meal for walnuts in crust. A little difficult to get out of pan, but really tasty.

I use Hershey's chocolate bars instead of chips.  Put them on as soon as the bars come out of the oven the second time.  They smooth out easily and are delicious!

Really good - and easy!  A bit too much chocolate for me, but my co-workers who gobbled it up didn't seem to think so!  Quite rich, but great with a cup of coffee.  Interestingly several called it the "peanut butter thing."

This was so easy to make!  I didn't have a candy thermometer...instead I just watched for the dark amber color to appear (about 10-15 minutes).  The only thing I would say to do is be sure to spread the toffee out with a spatula after pouring it onto the parchment paper.  I let it spread on it's own and realized when I broke it apart that the middle was a lot thicker.  Also, I toasted slivered almonds on 375 for a couple minutes to bring out the nutty flavor.  Everyone loved it!

I made several types of cookies this Christmas.  These were the favorite, by far!!!!!!!!  A little like cookies, a little like candy, they literally melt in your mouth!

These were great!  I'm just getting ready to make a second batch so that we have some to give away this holiday- we've eaten most of the first batch!  I like them as much as I love the caramel shortbread squares on this site.  I didn't change anything.
