I am giving this 3 stars because it helped me develop my own great recipe. This was a good concept but I changed it quite a bit.  First, I wilted 3 8oz. bags of baby spinach adding no butter or oil, put in strainer and pressed water out.  Then I sauted 8oz. sliced mushrooms with the 1/2 onion called for, added 1 minced garlic clove the juice of 1/2 a lemon and a few drops of worcestershire sauce (last 2 ingredients were suggested in one of the reviews I read).  Mixed spinach into mushroom mixture.  Put in casserole dish and topped with the cheese.  I did not use any butter and only a tiny bit of olive oil with the mushrooms! It still was a little greasy I guess from the cheese.  But the flavor was fabulous.  Next time I will omit the cheese called for and just sprinkle with parm-regg.  Thanks for the base recipe but I can't imagine all that butter.

As written, this recipe had flaws which, even making changes, only made this an ordinary dish. Too much butter, so I adjusted for that. No seasoning, so I added some garlic. Also, I didn't see the need to cook the spinach separately from the mushrooms--a pointless extra step that just takes more time and dirties an extra pan. I just cooked the mushrooms, onion and garlic first, then added the spinach to the same pan--and frankly, I should have left it at that and stopped there. Finally, other than to melt a mild cheese (I also adjusted for that by using a sun-dried tomato/basil cheddar) I don't see what the purpose is of placing already cooked spinach in the oven--except to overcook it. This has potential, I guess, with a pretty major overhaul, but as written it's just not that great a recipe.

Really loved it, but like everyone else, I made changes. First, I halved it which was perfect for just me and leftovers (someone suggested serving it with shrimp over rice, which I plan to try b/c it was so good). I also took others advice and just sauteed the mushrooms, onions, and spinach in the same pan with a light layer of cooking spray instead of butter. I didn't remove the stems (it seemed like a waste of time and still tasted fine). I added a splach of worchesterchire and lemon juice before putting it in the dish to bake. Instead of cheddar, which I think would overpower the flavor of the veggies, I used a small amount of swiss and covered the rest in an italian blend of romano, parm, mozz, and guyer.

This recipe was a little too salty and greasy for me.  The flavor of the mushrooms and spinach together was really good.  Next time I think I will use about half the salt and velveeta instead of cheddar.  I think that will help cut down on the grease.

This is fantastic! My family flipped over this recipe. We'll definitely be making it often. I altered it a little based on the reviews. I used more cheese and less butter. Next time, I won't use any butter. I also skipped the salt entirely and threw in a little lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce based on a previous suggestion. I love it! Thanks so much for submitting.

this was very good. I used a small dash only of salt and it was fine. I also omitted butter and did a light drizzle of olive oil instead.  I don't think this dish needs any butter anyway due to getting enough oil from the melted cheese.   If you LOVE onions to death like I do plus are a spinach fan then you should be amazed at how great this tastes.  I really took a bite of it and said out loud, "this is good!" 

great recipe -- the flavor beats your expectations because it was just too easy!

This dish was very flavorful, but it was really greasy.  It would be great served on brushetta.  I just couldn't handle all the grease.

I really wanted to love this recipe.  These are some of my all time favorite foods so I started with strong positive bias.  Alas, it just tasted like spinach, mushrooms, onions and cheese.  Sure, I know that's what it is, but I was hoping for that magical transformation when a combination transcends its ingredients.

I brought this to a potluck, and everyone wanted the recipe (even some of the non-cooks, since it was so simple).  I used 2 packages of frozen leaf spinach instead of fresh as suggested by another reviewer, added garlic powder, and didn't bother to cook the mushrooms first (though this releases quite a bit of liquid).  Also, I definitely think it's better with Swiss cheese than cheddar.

I signed up for an organic delivery service and had a lot of left over spinach, most of which was quite wilted.  I decided if I cooked it as instructed in this recipe it probably wouldn't be so bad. I was right!   This is a great recipe for anyone that has an abundance of (not so) fresh spinach they would like to use up. The casserole was tasty!  Not too salty either as others had mentioned.

Very good, quick and easy! Use any type of cheese (I used mozz/provolone mix) preferred.  I added a little panko on top for some crunch. This will make a good quiche filling.  Next time, will use less butter and will saute mushrooms and spinach together (less pans to clean).

I served this last night and it was a hit. I did a few things differently, probably like other reviewer - I did not read them all.  I used 2 bunches of fresh spinach, which I wilted and squeezed to remove water.  Then I sautéed the mushrooms together with the onions and some garlic.  I cut back the butter poured over the spinach to 2TBL and next time, I will cut it again or perhaps leave it out all together.  I think the cheese adds enough flavor that all that butter is just not needed.  Above all, this is easy and tasty!

Salty AND greasy!  I had to this out! Maybe without the salt it would taste better but it would still be super greasy. I tried this because we all love it when I use very little olive oil and sautee mushrooms, spinach and onions. I figured this would be a little twist on an already good thing...WRONG!!!

The recipe as posted is a good combination of flavors but seemed cumbersome  --  I followed suggestions offered by Mattsbelly & others and then added a bit of leftover cubed pork loin roast to make it more of a main dish  --  mixed some grated asiago into cheddar topping  --  quite tasty.  Thanks to everyone providing reviews  --  very helpful.

This was super easy and super good!  Although I thought my big bag of spinach was more than enough,  it was only 12oz.  But I like mushrooms,  so I just went for it. I can't eat cheddar,  so I topped mine with thin slices of Swiss cheese.  I also sauteed the onions and a clove of garlic with the shrooms.  My wonderful husband said it was "magnificent".  I will be making this again,  perhaps with the proper amount of spinach. :)

My family and I all really loved this recipe! I didn't put the 4 TBLS of melted butter in it and also I didn't have enough cheddar cheese so I used half mozzarella...it turned out wonderful. It wasn't greasy like some others said about theirs. I think next time I'll add some cut up chicken breast to it.Its a keeper for us! Thanks for sharing!

This was good but a little on the salty side.  I didn't bake it with the butter to make it a little more on the healthy side.  I will make again but eliminate the salt and saute the mushrooms with garlic.

I made this for a side dish on Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. I did use frozen chopped spinach and only butter to saute onions, which I mixed in the spinach and a little to saute mushrooms with. We will make this often.

What a wonderful side.  Have made this twice at different homes and got rave reviews both times. Quick and easy to make it doesn't get much better than that, and the blend of flavors is outstanding.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Using the modifications from others (less butter, different cheese) this can turn into an awsome side dish. I used the left overs to make an omlete the next day.

It's a very good dish but definitely, should be eaten as soon as it is done.

Thanks for the contributions people!

I added a pound of cooked baby shrimp to the casserole and used a little less cheese. Served on top of cooked pasta, it reminds me of Macaroni Grill's Shrimp Portafino without the pine nuts. Will make it again with pasta to absorb the butter and cheese.

I sauteed fresh garlic and used a lot less butter than the recipe called for.  It is a very good side dish but I would like to find a way to get some of the grease out of it.

I thought that this was a really easy dish to make.  The only change I made was that when you saute the mushrooms, I added chopped garlic and some italian seasoning, which gave it a little more flavor.  Either way it was great and it got my family to eat spinach!

I skipped the butter per reviews, and was happy with the results. I used a bag of Mexican grated cheese (b/c it's only 1/4 cheddar), and had no problem with grease. I added lots of garlic salt, basil, seasoning salt, and about 2 T. of sour cream, and 1 T. of mayo into the spinach after draining. I used portobellos and loved the flavor. I still prefer spinach souffle, but this was a delicious change for us. Thanks!

This is not only an easy recipe to do, it is very tasty as well. I cooked it for a dinner party and my guests raved over it. It goes well as a side dish with any meal, and I plan on serving it again very soon.

I thought this was terrific with a few modifications.  As others mentioned, less salt!  Also, I just tossed the sliced mushrooms, spinach leaves and onion in a microwave steamer and steamed them all together with a couple Tbsp. of butter.  I added a couple slices of cooked bacon, chopped, to the casserole and only used half of the cheese.  It was very tasty and the family loved it!

First, the spinach and mushrooms don't really need to be cooked before the oven. I think this would be better with no cheese at all (hard to believe, I know). Also, I think some other spices besides only salt would be good. Like some garlic and lemon juice. Overall, it had potential, but, as written I probably wouldn't make it again. Thanks, though!

We love this recipe.  I cut down on the butter a little and didn't use any salt.  Thought it was great and spinach is not usually one of my favorites.  I've tried it with both frozen and canned spinach and still loved it.  Thanks.

This was a good base to come up with my own recipe. I changed the dish quite a bit, but it turned out great. 1st, I sauteed the mushrooms with olive oil and not butter-I added 1 tbsp of worcestershire and a tsp of soy to the mushrooms. I added a clove of minced garlic and sauteed with the onions. I used the cheese I had on hand which was a mix of parmesan, mozzarella, and provolone. I did sprinkle a little cheddar on top. Was delicious!

As a suggestion to save time I'd sauté the mushrooms with the onions. And yes do add a clove of garlic minced to the wilting spinach.   On the salty; if you are not using unsalted butter, reduce your salt to 1/4 teaspoon.  On the greasy.  You may want to cut the butter used to maybe 3 T. total.

Really tasty..  The mushrooms cooked in butter are all the butter you need. It will still be plenty tasty. I've substituted frozen spinach in a bag for even easier. Very good.

My husband and I loved this.  I didn't know how to wilt spinach, but the package said to put it in a big pot on the stove with a tablespoon of olive oil over medium low. Stir stir stir, it doesn't take long to wilt a minute or two.  Also, I thought the recipe really didn't need that much butter (I reduced it by half).  I would also recommend draining off the juice after sautéing the mushrooms. I would also reduce the salt by half because of the cheese.  Otherwise,  the taste was delicious!!

I eliminated the butter and added red and green fried peppers to the recipe.

I was pleasantly surprised at how fresh this tasted. Definitely use fresh spinach!! It makes all the difference in the world.
Delicious with any kind of chicken. Probably any entree!

By itself this wasn't anything noteworthy, but the next day I used the leftovers on top of rice and that was pretty good.

I originally made this in October and it turned out great.  Everyone loved it.  It was a little watery so you just need to make sure the spinach is well drained.  Will be making this again for Christmas

tastes good, but the prep could be alot simpler. I think next time I won't precook the spinach or mushrooms and see how it turns out...

Nice side dish. Not exceptionally fabulous, but it's still a nice recipe for guests to try.

It is much too salty.  Next time I'll use 1/2 the salt.  Otherwise, not bad!

Less BUTTER, but other than that AWESOME. I didn't have any fresh spinach so I used Frozen buyt still wonderful. I sprinkled red pepper and crushed black pepper over the cheese, let it sit 10 minutes and served. MM MM Good :)
