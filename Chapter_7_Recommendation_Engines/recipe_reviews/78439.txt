Made this several times and loved it each time.    Did use less eggs.   Put the stuff in a small food processor to cut down the work.   Usually eat them all up at once ---but had a few left over from a couple days ago put the in the refrig.    Ate one today ---cold---were even better than when fresh out of the oven.   Will be making this often.  Do NOT use plain bread crumbs as they will taste bland ---really need the seasoned bread crumbs.

Very pleased with this recipe. Been looking for something to do with veggies to make quick snacks. I put the mushrooms & onions in a small food processor, used only 3 eggs, added 1 tbsp sherry, and used combo of romano & gorgonzola. Only add bread crumbs until you have a sticky consistent, not dry. I made large & small balls & they were all very tasty, rest in the freezer.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I'm a college student, and I work part time, so I dont have much time to prepare big meals, or create big grocerie lists. All the ingredients were things we have around the house and they dont take much to prepare either. I love them! I added a little more parmesean and used freshly minced garlic instead of the powdered kind. Thank you so much! You just introduced me to one of my favorite recipes.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  I recommend using 1 or 2 cloves of garlic rather than the garlic powder, though.  A GREAT meatless meatball option, nearly as good as my Italian grandma's meatball recipe!  I also used crushed up Club crackers, 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 tsp dried marjoram, 1 tsp dried basil, and a pinch of ground red pepper in place of the seasoned bread crumbs. I also reccommend allowing the mixture to rest for 10-15 mintues before shaping into balls to allow it to hydrate, though this is not absolutely necessary.

These are amazing -- I added a little bit of white wine I had leftover, and boy did that bring out a nice flavor! Though mine didn't ball up very well, they still turned out delicious! Perfect little appetizers.

I am not a huge mushroom fan; although, I had some mushrooms left over from another recipe.... These Mushroom Stuffing Balls are so tasty. I highly recommend this recipe!

Delicious.  I also used minced garlic rather than powdered.  Ended up using only about 1 1/2 cups of bread crumbs and they turned out delicious.  I used portabellos and didn't have parmesan so used what cheese was on hand.  Very very good.  Thank you!

This recipe was horrible.  I was very excited to make this, but they were really dry.  Once they cooled off they were even worse.  Recipe needs adjustments.

Tastes more like a quiche than stuffing.  Wouls try using one egg and maybe triple the bread next time.

They were delicious, especially for the mushroom lovers. i put 3/4 the bread crumbs amount, i think that i've should put it all, the paste were sticky, and they lost their spherical shape and flattened a  little pit in the oven, but all in all they're tasty delicious balls.

Great recipe! We made this as an appetizer to pork tenderloin.  It was absolutely delicious!  I can't wait to try the recipe again and throw in some of my own ideas.

Thanks KCONFER!  I know why your father loves this so much.

Really enjoyed these.  They go well with an assortment of appetizers.  I did cut back slightly on the bread crumbs as the first time I made them, they were somewhat dry.

Quite good, a little dry but would be really exceptional used as meatballs with spaghetti sauce.  I used real minced garlic with basil and oregano leaves instead of parsley flakes.  Very good warm.

THESE ARE AWESOME!!!  The first time I made them, I didn't have bread crumbs so I had to improvise.  What I did was crush up seasoned croutons and they worked very well!! I will always use the croutons now.  I've made these for my Christmas party and our Super Bowl party and have gotten rave reviews.

Pretty good!!! I can see how this can be an okay crowd pleaser. Next time, I'm going to include chopped green onions. There's something missing when I initially tasted it... would make it again!

This was surprisingly good. My husband couldn't stop eating it. Honestly, I didnt expect it to turn out so good. I also used a few of the balls in an Indian style gravy (Kofta curry). That was great too. Will reduce the amount of onion next time though.

I have made these several times.  I like purple cabbage, as it hides better, and was what I had on hand the first time I made them.  They are great, and friends love them too.  How great is it to get fiber and crunch in your sandwich.

Mixed reviews from my family.  Sorry, I did not like these at all.  My wife thought these were just OK.  My wife and I agree that these seemed like too much bread crumbs and not enough mushrooms.  I would have rated this at 2 stars, but my mother just absolutely loved these and kept raving about them.  She said these mushroom balls tasted so much like meat that she wanted to use this recipe for meatballs, the next time we eat spaghetti. My two kids 2 and 5, whom are usually picky, gobbled everything up and wanted more.

Very different appetizer!  The second time I made them, I added Chinese seasoning and served with Teriyaki sauce.  I plan on using this recipe in my stuffed zucchini this summer - WAY better than regular stuffing!  Thanks!

It is a little too oily, and just doesn't quite work. I ended up wrapping these in dinner rolls and they tasted a little better. Then again, I was extremely hungry... I will not be making them according to this recipe again.

Excellent!  I made a couple of changes. I used about 12 oz mushrooms, 3 tablespoons of butter, 1 cup bread crumbs, 1 clove garlic that I grated into the mixture, I only used 2 eggs and I added 4oz of pureed tofu to add some protein. I also used some Kirkland no salt seasoning along with the parsley.  My 3 year old ate 5 ! and my husband and I think they are very yummy.  Can't wait to make again, next time I will try adding some spinach.  Great snack for anyone.

This recipe is AMAZING. I made them for a wine tasting and had so many friends ask me for the recipe. They were great. I made them again with a yogurt/lemon dressing and loved them once more!

I am giving these 4 stars even though I didn't like them because everyone else in my family did, A LOT.  I think the main thing that upset me was that after I baked them a huge puddle of melted butter was covering the cookie sheet.  I poured that off (so maybe they were actually healthier minus the butter?), but it kind of grossed me out.  They looked a lot better when stuffed into tomatoes.  Anyway, as I said, my family liked them, so I'll probably make them again, and I am sure if I hadn't seen the puddle of butter I would have enjoyed them more too.  :)

I used this recipe as a filling for whole mushroom caps with a little mozzarella cheese underneath. It sounded like a good idea but wasn't a huge success with my husband. I thought it was just okay. The mixture was a bit dry and tasted mostly of the bread crumb seasoning. I used my food processor and I think I chopped the mushroom too finely and then had to add too much bread crumbs to hold the mixture together.

This tasted very good.  I thought the batch felt extremely dry after using the required amount of breadcrumbs, so I had a half brick of light cream cheese left over that I added to the batch to make it less dry.  I also added about a 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese to the recipe.  My husband enjoyed them very much, and since I have some of the batch left over, I'll add some horseradish to them for some extra kick!

I made these for a party.  I found them extraordinarily dry and bland, but they appealed greatly to some of the more finicky eaters among my guests.  Probably a nice fallback vegetarian recipe for anyone without an adventurous palate.

Wasn't bad, but wasn't thrilled about it either :( I did give two stars though just because we did eat it.  I think next time I'll just make a batter and just throw them in the deep fryer.

I used only 5 T of butter and 1 1/2 cups of crumbs.  I chilled it for a bit (figuring that the chilling of the butter would firm it up for rolling the balls).  They rolled beautifully and kept their shape.  These tasted good; very similar t stuffed mushrooms since it is pretty much the same ingredients.  I'll definitely make them again.  I do think there was just a little something missing though...some spice or flavor that would kick it up one more star...I'm still thinking about it.

From the previous comments, I used 2c breadcrumbs, 3 eggs, little less parm cheese and added shredded mozzarella cheese. I served it with chipotle mayo for a dip.

These are awesome warm!  I served these at Thanksgiving last year.  I could not bake these little guys fast enough! They were a hit, everyone enjoyed and there were no leftovers.  Had I made more, nobody would've had room for the ham.

Unfortunately I had no onions to hand so had to leave them out of this recipe which it desperately needed. Despite my lack of onions, the end result was pleasing. I found the recipe very very easy to make with simple every day ingredients. I seasoned with Italian herbs and only used two eggs. I probably could have done with a little more cheese and garlic, but I know for next time. I served this as a side dish to some simple pasta and pesto. My only grievance with this dish is that is is messy to make.

After cooking in the over, we browned them in a frying pan with garlic and butter and then served with Thousand Island dressing on the side.  Was delicious

excellent recipe.  I made it for a appetizer potluck and the mushroom balls were enjoyed by all who had them. Even  folks who detest mushrooms were shocked to learn the ingredients of these tasty snacks.   I stuck to the recipe for the most part.  I used three eggs rather than four and 1/3 cup butter rather than 1/2 cup.

We really enjoyed these!  I only used 2 T. butter (I'm always cutting down the fat if I can)and 2 eggs and added a large clove of fresh garlic and some poultry seasoning.  Putting the mushrooms, onion, and garlic in the food processor makes it so easy.  I also added only enough bread crumbs to make it slightly stiff.  My husband thought it was a restaurant quality appetizer!

Good stuff and different from your average fare.  I didn't use the full 2 1/2 cups of seasoned bread crumbs based on previous reviews and only used 3 eggs. My food processor made light work of the fine chopping.  I used fresh garlic as well. Because I think I used too many mushrooms, it was a little 'wetter' than it should have been.  So, I stuck them under the broiler for just under 3 minutes to get a littler firmer and have a nice brown top.

Husband liked them, I didn't try them. (Don't like mushrooms)Be sure to chop the mushrooms and onion into very small pieces. Or it's hard to shape in a 2 inch ball. Will make again.
