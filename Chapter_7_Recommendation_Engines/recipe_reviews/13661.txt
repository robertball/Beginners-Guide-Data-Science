I have used this recipe countless times and always have fantastic feedback.  To make the relish sweeter, add more apples and/or raisins rather than sugar.  The apples will sweeten it naturally. I typically double the apples.

Add walnutes or other nuts if you want a little change as well.

This relish is also great with vanilla ice cream (warm the relish a tad).  Almost like a pie/crumble without the crust!

OK - I cheated.  My rating above is for a dramatically changed recipe.  As written I'd give it 2 stars - "tart" is an understatement - and I LOVE cranberries.  This recipe does, however, make the basis for a terrific cranberry relish.   I added sugar a little bit at a time to taste - probably more than 1/2 cup, reduced the vinegar by half, left out the cinnamon and cloves because I was looking for an unspiced relish.  I chopped the apple because I wanted the different fruits to be of similar size.  Crushed some of the apples at the end which made the sauce nice and thick.  With these changes everyone loved it - especially on top of pumpkin waffles or oatmeal.

The title says tart and it really is. I ended up adding a little sugar to it. The recipe doesn't say to remove the cinnamon sticks, but I did before serving.

I found this way too tart. I ended up adding about 1/2 cup more sugar and then got raves on it. Next time I make this I will just eliminate the vinegar.
