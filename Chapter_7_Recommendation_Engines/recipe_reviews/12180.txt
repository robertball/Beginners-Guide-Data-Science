My daughter and I made this recipe with a homemade butter pie crust. It turned out to be delicious although my daughter wouldn't eat it because there was a vegetable in the pie.

Very good! I changed it a little bit by adding 2 cups of sugar instead of one and a half. I also added 4 cups of rhubarb and not 3, plus 1 cup of raspberries. Tasty!

This was my first time ever baking with rhubarb, or even tasting it.  So I didn't know what to expect.  I found that the filling wasnt quite enough, but other than that, the recipe was good.  I gave it 3 stars, not because of the recipe, but I am undecided about rhubarb.

This pie is my absolute favorite pie to make! I use my fiancee's great grandma's crust recipe. The first time I made this pie, I used this recipe. It turns out AMAZING every time. Thanks!

The pie is absolutely delicious, best I ever had! The bad news is it is watery. I made two more one with 2 tblsps of flour and the other with 2 tblsps corn starch.....still watery. What am I doing wrong?

I can't believe anyone ADDED sugar! I used 4 cups of rhubarb and nutmeg and all I could taste was sugar!!! Very runny.

Delicious and easy! Will definitely be making this recipe in the future. We've had rhubarb growing in our garden for a while now and I finally got around to doing something with it. I am really glad I did, because this was a very easy recipe to make, and it tastes, oh so good! This considering the fact that I did not even use new rhubarb shoots, but older stems. The filling still turned out really well. The pie took 55 minutes to bake instead of 45 as it says in the recipe, and the pastry (I used Krusteaz) on top still did not look brown (gotta remember to whisk with egg next time!), just pale yellow, but I made sure that the pie was cooked through by sticking a knife into the filling part. Also, the pie is very leaky once you cut it, it may be because it needs to go into the fridge after it cools, or perhaps I should add a bit more flour to the filling next time. I did not find the pie to be too tart unlike some other users. I think 1.5 c sugar is plenty for 3 c rhubarb. The most enjoyable part of making this (other than tasting it) was weaving the top crust. All in all, just stick with this straight forward recipe and you can't go wrong!

Makes a great pie for person who loves sour! I took it to a potluck and got a few compliments. If you want, I would suggest  something to balance it out, like cinnamon or nutmeg, but it's fine the way it is.

Very good. I made it twice.  Once with the microwave and once entirely in the oven.  If some found it runny, they may not have baked it long enough or not let it cool long enough.  It needs to bake at least 15 or even 20 minutes after coming out of the microwave.  If you bake it entirely in the oven, you need to give it an hour and a half,  covering the edges if necessary.  Let cool 3-4 hours, the longer the better.  The recipe itself is a really good one.

It had pretty good flavor. Very runny even though I added almost 3/4 cup flour to the filing. Still sweeter than I would have liked as well. Next time will decrease sugar by half and add tapioca to absorb moisture. But it was still gone within hours.

I love this recipe because of it's ease!  I used the Pillsbury rolled pie crusts that are so easy (ready made).  I also sometimes add some strawberries, cherries or mulberries.  Always yummy!

This tastes great, but it is just plain too runny.  I have made it several times, trying different amounts of thickener, but it doesn't help.

Great, easy recipe!  I stole an idea from another recipe of using kitchen shears to cut up the rhubarb so it took less time.  We used 3 c rhubarb and 1 c fresh raspberries.  Mmmmm... got tons of compliments!
