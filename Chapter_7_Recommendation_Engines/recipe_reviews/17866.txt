Great cake!!  I used a lemon cake and added a few tablespoons of fresh lemon juice in place of some of the water in the cake.  My coworkers gobbled this up and my boss wanted the recipe after I took this to a work luncheon.  Will definitely make again, very refreshing and light tasting!

Delicious!! Used lemon cake mix (and the lemon pudding!)...perfect - you HAVE to use lemon cake mix. Also, we like to eat cake cold, it really is so good right out of the fridge, you've got to try that. Made an American flag on top w/ strawberry slices and blueberries for the 4th of July yesterday...so cute! :) My sister said that this is now her favorite cake of ALL TIME!!

I made this for my daughter's birthday and everyone loved it!  Used 9 x 13 pan, lemon cake mix, and lemon pudding.  As someone else said, be sure to beat batter for the full time and cake will rise nicely.

I used a lemon cake mix and made it according to the directions on the box except I added a box of instant lemon pudding mix and the juice one lemon. Then I used lemon pudding instead of vanilla with the Cool Whip for the topping. Excellent! My husband loves lemon desserts and thought this was very good. Not too sweet. Very fresh and light. Yummy!

This is a truly wonderful cake. Any person who would rate this cake only 3 stars probably didn’t cook it correctly! I used a lemon cake and vanilla pudding for the frosting.  I do not have lemon extract, so I used zest and fresh juice of 2 lemons.  If you are substituting for the extract, it is important to taste the frosting and make sure it is lemony enough. If not, keep adding zest and lemon juice until it is.  I split the cake into 2 layers and sprinkled yellow non-parielles all over the top and served each piece with a fresh raspberry. (See Photo.)

I had trouble making the cake because i tried to use 2-9" pans instead of the 10x15 dish... they were so moist that they fell apart when i tried to take them out of the pans! But once i reconstructed them, iced and refrigerated the cake, WOW! It was fabulous. I used lemon cake mix instead of yellow, and also lemon pudding in the frosting instead of vanilla. It was a hit!

A hit with my family!  Light, moist, and flavorful.  As others suggested, used lemon cake and lemon pudding, also substituted 1/4 c of water for lemon juice, and also zest of one lemon-divided between cake batter and icing.  Made a tiered 9" round cake, and layered with raspberry filling.  Simple fruit filling recipe: use Polander seedless all-fruit spread, any flavor, microwave jar for approx. 30secs, and add in small box jello, in same flavor as fruit spread (I used all sugar free and fat free add-INS), whisk, cool completely (can even place in freezer for 10 mins), then spread on cake with desired layers.  So quick and simple-intense fruit flavor, and perfect spreadable texture, without soaking into even this moist cake!

I'm an avid baker, and this is a fabulous recipe. Everyone loved it when I served it at my husband's birthday party. I increased the amount of lemon extract, grated lemon rind into the whipped cream, and shaved some white chocolate onto the top. Best cake I've ever made!!!!!!

The cake was very nice.  I used the lemon cake mix like everyone suggested and added the juice of 1 lemon plus the zest of 1/2 lemon to the water.    The only problem I had with it was that it didn't grow very tall.  I used the required 10x15 pan and the cake was only an inch thick.  There simply wasn't enough batter.  I was making it as a birthday cake for my FIL and was forced to make another batch and it ended up being an enormous layer cake...which worked out good considering I was feeding a party of 18 people.  I used a whipped citrus frosting (lemon and orange) instead of the cool whip, which gave it a really nice touch.  Overall it was a real hit with the crowd.

This cake is amazing! I've made it several times and always receive amazing compliments.  But i also made some adjustments: whip your own heavy cream instead of cool whip, then blend in mixer with pudding mix, don't fold - the texture and rich taste is as good as any professionally done bakery.  I also grated two lemons into the whipped cream.  

Also and per other suggestions, I used 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice as a substitute for full water in the batter. 

I make this as a double layer cake.  Don't expect to rise - it won't.  But do mix at high speed as suggested to aeriate the batter.  The outcome is a nice size double layer cake that has a very light texture - not heavy like a pound cake.

Emjoy!

This was a hit for my Mother in laws B-day. I didn't use the whipped cream topping in the recipe made a sturdy Whipped cream frosting on here.  Also subbed in 1 whole egg and 2 egg whites instead of 3 egg whites.  With the water I subbed part of that with 1/4 cup lemon juice.  Was very moist and delicious made in a 9x13 was perfect.

I made this for my son's 23rd birthday.  Lemon cake is his favorite and this was the BEST lemon cake I have ever made.  I had a bit larger sheet cake pan, 11 1/2 x 16 1/2 so I doubled the recipe.  I used Lemon cake mix as suggested by others with lemon pudding in the cake wth about 1/3 of a cup of lemon juice to replace some of the water.  It turned out perfectly.  For the frosting I used one lemon pudding mix and 16 oz of cool whip with about 2 TBLS of fresh lemon juice.

MMM Yummy....

Whipped up 4 egg whites (instead of 3) separately and folded them into the rest of the combined ingredients.  Fold them in well.  This helps to make cake a little fluffier since the added pudding mix makes cake denser.

I left out the non-fat milk and used lemon cake mix, not yellow.  I sliced the cake to make 2 layers and spread lemon pudding filling in center.  Going to try raspberry spread next time (1 small jar seedless raspberry preserves + 1 box raspberry jello as suggested by another reviewer).  Used "Cream cheese frosting II" recipe and made a flag with blueberries and strawberries for the 4th of July.

LOVE this recipe, however it is a MUST that you use lemon cake mix and lemon pudding mix for BOTH puddings in this recipe. The batter is so light and fluffy and the cake turned out the same! It was moist and delicious and I don't usually like cake. The first time I made them into cupcakes and put a layer of the frosting in the middle, but this time I made two 9" round cakes, cut them both in half lengthwise, put two layers of the frosting and one layer of canned lemon pie filling (similar to lemon bars) in the middle! It was GREAT!

My family absolutely loves lemon cake, so I have tried a lot of them. Based on recommendations from others I made the following modification, and was told that it was the best lemon cake they had ever had! I used the lemon pudding and lemon cake mix, added zest of one lemon, subbed 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice for 1/2 cup water, added 1-2 egg yolks, and best my egg whites separately to a soft peak before folding in. I also used the cream cheese frosting II recipe from this site and added the juice of one lemon. Fantastic!

I made this for Easter and it was delicious. I too used a lemon cake mix and substituted an 8 oz carton of real whipping cream for the frozen whipped topping. I whipped the cream and added about 1 tablespoon of sugar and some fresh lemon zest before adding to the rest of the frosting ingredients. This cake will be my new favorite for company.

5 star recipe! I'm sorry but I would never add oil or whole eggs to this recipe as was previously mentioned. It was so delicious as is.   Very moist and just the right amount of lemon flavor.  I made this for my sons 25th birthday (he wanted something out of the ordinary and I'm always up for something new.) He said this was the best cake he ever had! I will definitely be making this cake often!

Why is this recipe in the 'healthy living' category?  Cake mix, instant pudding, and whipped topping????  Yikes.

i love this recipe and my friends are still talking about it months after i made it for them!   My substitutions: lemon cake instead of yellow, and 2 tablespoons of lemon extract and the zest of 1 lemon (instead of leamon extract).   this cake  turns out to the PERFECT consistency- moist and fluffy.

I made this because I was craving a lemon cake and my favorite recipe is from scratch, but I didn't have time for that.   I was a little concerned about the texture from reading reviews but it was wonderful. 

 I used a yellow cake mix, a small package of pudding (lemon) instead of the larger one because I picked up the small by mistake, and I added 1/4 cup of oil and used 3 whole eggs (I was not concerned about fat/calorie content for this occasion).   I used fresh lemon juice from four lemons in place of part of the water. 

I did not use the frosting in the recipe so I cannot comment (I subbed a cream cheese lemon frosting).  I made two 8" rounds and used no-sugar-added blackberry jam as a filling between the layers.  It was amazing and fast -- I am not one to like anything from a box but this, I would do again.  

The only thing I'd do differently, especially if I were taking the cake to an event, is probably double the recipe -- even the 8" round layers were pretty thin and it made a very petite cake.

I followed to the tee and did not like the heavy, congealed feel this cake had. Seemed more like I was eating bread pudding. It did not have the knockout lemony kick I was hoping for either. Had to fill the cupcake tins almost to the top, the first batch were well below the paper. Also did not pull away from the paper very well. So, wouldn't recommend cc paper.

I made this cake for the first time today. It was wonderful. Very easy. I used lemon cake mix and lemon pudding. In the filling and in the cake. I used fresh squeezed lemon in the filling in exchange for 1/3 of the water. I also used 1 whole egg and 2 whites instead of 3 whites.  I used fresh squeezed lemon instead of extract. It was a great success . Best Lemon cake ever.

This cake sounds fantastic, but mine was not.  I followed every direction, every suggestion, and my cake was flat and hard.  I'm even a baker (as my job)!!

Tastes like... pudding and boxed cake mix. I made this for a friend's birthday and am a bit apprehensive about giving it to her. I can see how people would enjoy this texture, though for me, the pudding is an overtly obvious ingredient.

First off I would like to know why they show a layered cake but the directions tell you to use a 10x15 pan. My cake looks nothing like the picture. Has anyone made their's in layers? I made the cake like the directions said but used lemon cake mix. The cake tasted good but was very flat. The frosting is delicious and low in fat. I might try to make this a layered cake next time.

I baked this cake today expecting to be wowed because of the many positive reviews but was somewhat disappointed. I followed the recipe except I used lemon cake mix instead of yellow. The cake turned out rather flat and dense. I whipped my own cream topping and added the vanilla pudding and lemon extract. I thought that was good but I like a stronger lemony taste so next time I will use lemon pudding instead of vanilla. I liked the concept of the cake so next time I will not skimp on calories. I will give it another try baking but next time I will bake it the traditional way with whole eggs and oil.

Not very lemony, and textures seems rubbery.  Beating vanilla pudding for 2 minutes makes it too thick and does not fold into whipped cream well.

I absolutly  LOVE this cake! Its so moist you would never know it  is light. After trying many from scratch lemon cake recipes on this site, and not finding what i was looking for I tried this one.  It was the simplest and best tasting.  This is exactly the taste I was hoping for.

Made this cake for my dad's birthday. He ALWAYS asks for a yellow or vanilla cake, so was surprised this year when he branched out with lemon. I tried this recipe because it sounded mild, and he LOVED IT!!!! It's his new favorite cake. He took some to work and it was quickly devoured. Even my mom, who doesn't like lemon, thought this cake was good. One variation -- I used lemon cake mix and french vanilla pudding instead of yellow mix and lemon pudding. I'll be making this cake every year from now on! Thanks for sharing!!

Made this for Easter.  Used lemon cake mix and sugar-free instant lemon pudding instead of the vanilla as suggested by others. Also used light cool whip.  Beat it for 4 min. as directed.  Baked it in a 10x13.  Super easy, and relatively light.  All loved it, especially the younger ones.  Served it with fresh strawberries.

Cake was delicious and moist.  However I wish I would have opted for the regular pudding versus the sugar free.  My guests complained about the after taste.

Not at all worth the praise it's received. Weird texture. Crisp top, creamy center. Didn't hardly rise at all. Completely bland. Used lemon cake with lemon pudding and somehow they taste like nothing. Frosting has no body. It's the texture of watery soft finger paint. It's runny and not very sweet. Lemon pudding, plus extract, plus zest, but it's still rendered tasteless by the whipped topping base. Tried to stiffen it with 2 cups of powdered sugar, and it's still runny and eerily light. Cake and frosting together was like inhaling high calorie air. No taste, no texture, waste of calories. Waste of time and energy. Glad this is my test batch before my real party because these tasteless air bombs will not be served. Just plain gross.

I can only review the cake portion of this, not the frosting.  The "doctored" cake mix recipe was great!  This has got to be the most moist cake that I have ever made.  It was delicious and I will use this recipe for different flavored cakes in the future.  I used a lemon buttercream recipe for the frosting instead of the pudding/whipped topping.  Next time I will try that instead, but really like this cake with the buttercream.

this is "okay".  tasted medicinal and artificial to me, but it's made from packaged ingredients, so one can't expect much more than that.  it's okay in a pinch, but nothing i would bring to a party to "WOW" anyone with.

This was a very good (not great) recipe.  I used a lemon cake mix like others had suggested and even replaced some of the water with lemon juice.  This gave me a great lemon flavor.  The cake was moist but the texture a little off for me, probably because its a "light" cake.  Overall good.

Just a suggestion but what about using Jello Lemon or Lemon Cream instant pudding instead of Vanilla! I often make Lemon Cream instant pudding, throw in some fresh blueberries and crush Archway Shortbread Cookies (I think they're better than Walkers!!!!) Oh, and add 4 oz of Marscapone to instant pudding after it's made.

I am afraid to say that I was disappointed with this recipe. It just didn't have that refreshing lemony taste that I was looking for even though I doubled the amount of lemon extract called for. I took it to a family gathering and brought most of it home.

Yummy! But for even more lemony deliciousness use a lemon cake mix in place of the yellow mix - you will be so happy you did! I also added some fresh lemon juice to the water (totaling the 1 3/4 cups called for in the recipe) and some lemon zest. This is so refreshing, light and delicious there won't be a crumb left on the plate, guaranteed!

This cake is super yummy and moist, it almost has a cooling effect when you bite into it. This will be a repeat in my line up for sure, I also crumbled up some lemon cookies on top for a little extra depth. Very refreshing dessert!

This is so delicious. For some reason, the cake pulled away from the sides. It was ugly, but so delicious. I added some juice from a real lemon and some zest to the batter. Very moist. I also used 3 whole eggs which made a denser cake. My family loved it. Great with canned lemon frosting.

Best Lemon Cake recipe I've tried from this site!  I just made the cake, not the topping.  Very moist and flavorful, plus super easy when time is limited.  I did cut the water down to 1 1/2 cups and used 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice.  I also used lemon cake mix as other reviewers suggested.  I accidentally used 3 whole eggs instead of egg whites, but it still came out great.  Use the Buttercream Icing recipe from this site to frost it ~ Outstanding!  Made one 9-inch round double-layered cake that the family couldn't stop raving about.  We can hardly wait to make it again.  Posted a picture of it as well.  Thanks!

I love this cake.  I followed the recipe except the sugar free pudding, I am anti-artificial sweetners.  I did two 9in rounds and layered.  My coworker loves lemon and strawberry so I put frosting in middle, topped with fresh strawberry slices, added second layer and frosted the entire cake and lined the top edges with fresh sliced strawberries. I also added the lemon zest, and it was awesome!!!  Everyone at work devoured the cake :)

Delicious!

Caution: Check the size of your cake mix before you start.  A lot of the big brands no longer sell 18.25 oz cake mixes.  They're almost all 15.25 oz.  Your cake will be heavy and wet if you don't adjust your recipe.  I added 6 tbsp of all-purpose flour which worked well for me.

I'm guessing that's why most of the bad reviews are newer and the best reviews are 2012 or earlier.

I also made my own lemon pudding (because I suddenly had three spare egg yolks) which I then mixed with the 'whipped topping'.  

It was fantastic!  I like the topping for this rather than standard buttercream icing and might adjust it for use with other cakes.

I am the first to admit, I am NOT a baker. Cakes have always intimidated me (not sure why really). My husband has been begging me to make him a cake, more specifically a Lemon cake, so after scouring the internet for over an hr I settled on this recipe. I read most of the reviews prior to starting this endeavor and so glad I did. Here are the tweaks I made...I, too, used lemon cake mix (instead of vanilla). My husband was very specific on "wanting it lemony" so I used 1 cup water and 3/4 fresh lemon juice (about 5 lemons). I also made this in 2-9in cake pans, cooking about 25 min. I used 1 egg and 2 egg whites (the cake did turn out pretty dense like a pound cake). I didn't have lemon extract, so used 1/2 tsp lemon zest (thank GOD for google). Best part of all, I used real heavy whipping cream (1 pint) instead of cool whip. As an experiment (yeah i live on the edge as a rookie) I took 1/4 or so of the whipped topping and mixed with about 2 tbsp of red raspberry preserves and put in the middle layer (of the 2-9in cakes) SO GOOD! Even my picky picky husband was impressed. Kudos to me!

I was glad I read some of the reviews before making this cake.  The reviews were helpful and gave me an idea what to expect, for instance that the cake doesn't rise like you would expect it too.  some people said they doubled the recipe. I chose not to knowing what to expect. I was not disappointed, and it was delicious!

This cake is so awesome! Everyone loved it, and it was super easy to make. I also appreciated how it was on the light side, too. I used lemon cake mix, and I think it was perfectly lemony. I made it in a 9x13 pan and it came out fine. I used extra frosting (it was great frosting, too!) to decorate with raspberries. It was more on the spongy side because of the pudding, but that made it unique from the light tea- style cake that I was expecting. I think it has something to do with how long you beat it for. Thanks, I'm keeping this recipe!

Yummy cake! After reading many reviews, I made the frosting with sugar free lemon pudding and used part water part lemon juice for the cake along with a lemon cake mix. Tasted moist and delicious!

This is very worth making. I really loved the dense texture of this cake. I was working on a birthday cake for my grandmother with instructions to make it a lemon cake. It doesn't bake up very high, so I ended up doing two 9"x13" layers with blueberry pie filling in the middle. Used a lemon cake mix, added the juice of two lemons as part of the water requirement and also zested the lemons into the batter. Also added a teaspoon of lemon extract. Instead of the topping here I did a swiss meringue buttercream. SO GOOD!

Easy recipe, but...the texture was too spongy & "wet". Those that said it was great, what are they comparing it to? I even added lemon extract & zest to the batter, still was bland. My husband loves sweets, but he didn't like it. I wouldn't make it again. Kroger lemon cake is much better..& after all, isn't that what we don't want? Homemade shld be better than storebought

Super moist and great flavour. I made it with a raspberry filling. I also added 1 tablespoon of lemon extract to the cake batter while mixing. Not only did I make this as a cake but also cupcakes. Both were a hit.

I love lemon so I was very exicited when I saw this cake and all the great reviews. I read all the suggestions and modifications and found the cake was easy to make, it expanded perfectly when I whipped it well and was not too thin. The problem I have with this cake is just a matter of personal taste. I like a sweeter cake, and this cake was light and fluffy, almost like angel food cake. I think if i used whole eggs instead of just whites this would help it though. I also was not fond of the pudding mix taste in the frosting, it tasted too artificial for me. And I like more of a buttercream frosting. I would not make this cake again, but I see how people who like the taste of lemon and want a lighter cake would like this.

I loved this recipe! I don't even like lemon cake but this came out fantastic! Very moist! However, I didn't use the frosting recipe.  I made a lemon cream cheese frosting.  Perfection!

So good!  I made the topping a little more lemony.  I put a few strawberries on the top.  I loved them on the cake, I may add some in the middle layer next time.

Everyone loved this cake. I made two cakes and layered them with raspberry preserves between the layers. I used 1/4 cup of lemon juice and 1.5 cups water. Also lemon cake mix. I frosted with sturdy whipped cream frosting from this site. Great!

Thx for sharing this yummy treat! Followed most of the recipe but I used a 9x13 pan, added fresh lemon juice to substitute for some of the liquid & served with lemon scented coolwhip with no pudding for the topping only inside the cake. Refreshing!

I made this for a co workers birthday...and lets just say, it was a huge HUGE hit. I colored the "icing" just like regular icing and decorated it like a regular cake!

This has become a favorite in our house. Like others, I use lemon cake mix and add grated lemon zest to the frosting, but otherwise follow the recipe. The result is a light, cool, and refreshing cake. Excellent!

This cake is wonderfully refreshing! The batter is thicker than "cake" batter - but don't worry - it comes out very moist. I cooked in a 13 x 9 pan and it was fine.
I've tried it with lemon cake mix and it was great. Do add the lemon zest to icing - it really makes a great difference!

I only made the cake portion. Felt like I was cheating using a mix but I knew it would be good. The cake was very moist and had a mellow flavor. It did come out very flat, but that's not as problem. I used lemon cake mix with lemon pudding. I filled with homemade lemon curd and lemon cream cheese icing.

I made this for Easter dinner, everyone loved how cool, light and creamy it was.  I made it using 3 disposable aluminum 8-inch round pans, anticipating problems removing them.  NO PROBLEMS!  I doubled the frosting recipe and had plenty, plus used lemon cake mix and lemon pudding mix throughout at the suggestion of previous reviewers.  It was great, thanks!

This cake was excellent!!  It was one of the best cakes I've ever had (and I'm usually not really crazy about cakes).  I made it for work and everyone loved it!  When I told them that it was low fat, they couldn't believe it.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes lemon.

This cake is seriously awesome if you pay attention to a few details . The most helpful review was the one that mentions making sure the cake mix you buy and the instant pudding you buy match the measurements the recipe calls for.  My lemon cake mix was not the proper weight so I added some flour to make up the difference. And my pudding mix was too large so I only used a partial pack.  Also,  using fresh lemon juice for half of  the water the recipe calls for makes an amazing difference!  I also added lemon zest of two lemons into the mix.  Seriously incredible tasting cake. Use a lemon flavoured cake mix for sure.

Tasty as is, but I made some taste & texture changes. >>>For the cake, I used lemon cake mix; added lemon juice & lemon zest; whipped the egg whites to soft peaks. This batter was very stiff, so I added milk until the batter was more like regular cake batter. I avoid dairy, so used coconut milk. Rice, soy, or almond milk would also work but change the taste. >>>For the topping, I increased the lemon extract and the milk (coconut milk again). I don't like sugar-free products so used regular instant vanilla pudding mix (3.4 ounce package). Note that even though I used non-dairy milk in the topping, the frozen whipped topping does have some dairy in it. >>>My picky eaters (mother, husband, and two young adult sons - yeah, poor me!) all loved it. >>>Exact amounts of my changes are in MyRecipeBox http://allrecipes.com/customrecipe/64199787/super-lemony-lemon-cake/detail.aspx

I took the advice from some of the reviews I read and used Duncan Hines lemon cake mix, and a small box of Jell-O Brand lemon pudding mix. I used one egg and 2 egg whites, I substituted a forth of a cup of the water for bottled lemon juice, and I followed the cooking directions as noted and my cake fell. I mixed it one minute on low and four minutes on high. I don't know what went wrong. I preheated the oven, but used a nine by thirteen pan, because I didn't have a ten by fifteen pan. I WANT try to make this again.

I have made this recipe twice and both times everyone loved it. The first time I made it I used white cake mix and lemon pudding mix. I had lemon frosting on hand and used that. I followed the other reviewers' advice to make sure the cake was mixed for the right amount of time and used a 9 x 13 pan. The cake was super moist. The lemon frosting give it an extra lemon flavor. The second time I made the cake I used lemon cake mix and lemon pudding mix. I made the frosting with whipped topping and lemon pudding mix. It also came out moist and with a great lemon flavor that is not overpowering. Thank you LaDonna for this wonderful recipe. It will be my go to recipe when I want to make a lemon cake.

I followed the recipe exactly, including beating it for as long as the recipe states, and while it tasted fine, the consistently was more like an over-baked cheesecake.  Just too gooey and dense to call it cake.  Bummed because I doubled the recipe. I make cakes every week, and I won't be keeping this recipe.

I wanted the cake to be almost completely sugar free so I used sugar free yellow cake mix and sugar free lemon pudding (both of which I got at my local King Soopers store). Besides those two changes I followed the recipe for this cake to a tee and it came out AMAZING. The cake was really moist and it didn't crumble or anything. The topping was extremely delicious. My coworkers gobbled the cake up really quick. 

I am going to try this recipe again, but with sugar free chocolate cake and sugar free banana cream pudding to make a chocolate banana cream cake. I hope it comes out as delicious as this one did.

Thanks a ton for the great recipe LaDonna ^_^

This cake is amazing just as is!  The fat free whipped topping is actually even better than regular in this recipe!  I am constantly being asked by relatives and coworkers to make this cake, it is so good.  And since it's so easy, I don't mind :-)

It was ok but nothing special.  You can taste the difference between a cake made from fresh ingredients and one made with no cook pudding mixes and frozen whipped topping.  You get what you put into it.

Made this for mother's day.  Used Lemon Cake Mix but otherwise made as written.  Well, almost.  I prepared a Lemon Curd as a filling, however will chill next time before placing top layer.  The pudding cake is so dense and moist that it squished out all of the lemon curd so it was a bit more like a sauce than a filling, but it was really delicious!  Will make this again!!

This is a dense cake, more like a pound cake which I liked even though it didn't rise as I hoped, I baked it in layers. After tasting the batter,I added additional lemon extract. I also frosted a light layer of lemon curd on the top of each layer before I frosted it with the whipped topping mixture. It was still disappointing, as far as lemon flavor was concerned. I wanted something more tart, kind of 'hit you in the face' lemon!

This is a good cake and surprisingly dense (the pudding I suppose!).  I liked the frosting, which was just light and perfect.  Like others, I used a lemon cake mix.

This was so good and so easy!  I made it for my husband's birthday and did a layer cake with 2 9-inch rounds.  I made it exactly as written except I used lemon cake mix and used 2 whole eggs instead of 3 egg whites.  It cooked in about 24 min.  I didn't notice any aftertaste at all in the frosting, surprisingly, because usually I detest "sugarfree" stuff.

I didn't have a 10 x 15 pan so I used my 11 x 17 and cut the cake into 4 layers. I frosted between layers and it makes a beautiful 4 layer cake. It doesn't raise high at all so making the layers worked great for me. I make this cake often and everyone loves it..they think I bought it from a high end bakery!!

I made this cake today. As advised by other readers I used lemon cake mix, lemon pudding mix and added 1/3 lemon juice. Trying to make it more yummy I  added  1/2 vegetable oil and used 3 whole eggs. The cake was good and moist but not "lemony" at all.

Simply delicious. Great texture. I spread each cake round with a thin layer of lemon curd - before frosting it. As I do not like the frozen whipped toppings, I used an alternative frosting from Epicurious (#100975) which was amazing. Whipped cream, powdered sugar and lemon curd. Very light - and PERFECT. YUM!!!!

Delicious. I tried this cake, making only a few minor adjustments. In the batter, I added a couple of tbs fresh lemon juice in place of water, as well as lemon rind. For the icing, I used real whipped cream, no pudding mix, but folded in some more lemon rind and 2 tbs. seedless rasberry jam. The cake itself was lovely, moist, flavourful and dense. I didn't try the original icing recipe, as I don't like the artificial taste of the cool whip. My brother who is a professed "hater of all things lemon" actually ate 2 slices. If that doesn't tell you it's good, don't know what will! Great summer recipe. Super easy

Made this on a Friday to be served on Saturday as others suggested it is better a day later. Very good recipe! The cake is so moist...like others, it will be my 'go to' recipe for cakes from now on. The frosting is pretty good, but I prefer a buttercream more. But it is good and creamy. I used regular cool whip and whole milk instead of all the light stuff.

Everyone LOVED this recipe! We are big lemon fans and the tartier, the better for us. So I used lemon cake box mix and added a couple tsp of lemon juice and then I also added a couple tsp of lemon juice to the cool whip. Made it taste so much better! Definitely making again!

I made this cake for my husbands birthday & it was delicious! I didn't make a layer cake but cooked it in a 9 by 13 pan. I also used fresh whipped cream instead of cool whip b/c I always sub those in every recipe & I used dried lemon essence instead of lemon flavoring but otherwise I didn't change anything & everyone loved it! Light & creamy, the perfect balance between the sweet & tart.

Cake was good.  My family did not care for the icing.  I may use the cake recipe again but search for a more traditional icing.

Very tasty cake, but flat. I'm wondering if it's because not all cake mixes are created equal (some just require water and some need eggs, milk and oil). There is a good base here. I just don't know why mine is so flat. I took care to carefully mix the cake too.

i followed the previous poster's advice and used lemon mix with lemon pudding.  i also replaced some of the water with juice from a lemon.  we stored the cake for a day in the fridge, then topped it with homemade whip cream, strawberries, blueberries and lemon zest.  it was perfect for a baby shower. it looked and tasted great - moist and soft.  next time i will try and make it even more lemon-y.

This cake turned out GREAT. My whole family loves this cake, and it is very low in fat and calories. :) I did what everyone suggested and used a Vanilla cake mix instead of a Yellow one. Absolutely wonderful! Lemony and delicious!

Wonderfully simple and delicious. I used a lemon cake as other mentioned. I also added some lemon zest to the frosting. This is a very light and flavorful cake. I added some candied lemons to spruce it up, but next time I will through some raspberries on top to gussy it up a bit.

I served this cake to some girlfriends who came over for movie night.  Between the four of us and taking leftovers to their husbands the whole thing was gone!  This is the lightest most fabulous cake I have ever tasted.  I did make a few substitutions.  I used lemon cake mix like another re-viewer suggested.  Also, because I love lemon so much I also substituted the vanilla sugar free pudding for lemon sugar free pudding in the frosting and I omitted the lemon extract.  I already have a request from my girlfriend’s husband to make this for his birthday cake in two weeks.  I will be making this cake for years to come.  Great job LaDonna!

You cannot go wrong with this recipe. It is very quick and easy (great for last-minute gatherings) and it is always the talk of the party. Even my best friend, who dislikes cake so much she has always had "birthday pie" had two slices!

Also used lemon pudding instead of vanilla pudding, and lemon cake instead of yellow cake.  Was great.  But need to beat on high for time specified.

I made this lemon cake tonight - turned out great!  I did as others said and used a lemon cake mix along with lemon pudding.  It turned out great - and it looked very pretty too!  I put it in a 9x13 pan and it turned out fine.  I love that the topping is not overly sweet either - I also used fat free cool whip and we thought it tasted fine.  I will make this again!

This is a VERY good cake!  The frosting is amazing!  On thing to note though...I baked it in a 9 X 13 pan for my daughter's birthday and it didn't puff up as much as I expected.  In fact, I thought it had fallen.  I was going to throw it out and make another but cut a piece out of the center first and saw it was fine.  I'm SO glad I didn't throw it out because it was a BIG, BIG hit.  Next time I'll be prepared!  It's a VERY moist cake and super yummy!  I'm looking for an excuse to make it again!

I made this for my mom for her birthday and she loved it!! I did make some adjustments though. I used a lemon cake mix and I used 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice in place of some of the water.  I made my own frosting. One 8oz package of cream cheese, 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice and 16oz cool whip. Blend the ingredients together and spread on cake. Refrigerate and serve.

I made this cake wrong by accident and it still came out great.  I was in a hurry and my little kids were "helping" me.  The recipe doesn't differentiate  between the cake ingredients and the frosting ingredients, so I accidentally added the milk to the cake ingredients.  I added it again to the frosting.  I was worried on how it would turn out as we had a group of people coming to dinner, but everyone raved about it.  I think I will make it wrong again next time.  :)

I am so sad ! I baked this for my mil's bday because lemon cake is her favourite. I know she tried so hard to eat it and be nice and say it's nice. I tried it and wanted to spit it up. The taste was so gross and artificial and It was not light and fluffy.. It was wet and dense. I followed the recipe except for the lemon cake mix and lemon pudding for the whip along with the lemon juice addition for the cake.

I should've followed my gut instinct! How could boxed mix + pudding mix taste fresh? :(

I had no idea why it would have such rave reviews. :( so sad for me..

This recipe was amazing. I don't even like lemon! I added half a lemons worth of juice and zest instead of the lemon flavor for the frosting and it was perfect. Used other's suggestion to use lemon cake mix and also added additional zest and juice to the batter. Make sure you mix the cake for recommended time and you should have no problem with it not rising. Great recipe!!

I followed the directions to a T, and the results were very disappointing.  The texture is very odd, the the flavour is just as unappealing.

My family loves this cake.  I put it in a 9x13 every time and it is perfect.  I also make a strawberry version.  Change the cake mix to strawberry and the pudding to strawberry creme and omit the lemon juice for in the icing. A chocolate version with crushed Heath Bar on top is very yummy as well.

Made this for Easter.  I used a lemon cake mix and then followed the above instructions.  For the frosting, I used lemon pudding and fresh squeezed lemon, since I didn't have zest, and folded it in to the cool whip.  It was so good.

Everyone loved the cake. It was moist and lemony and light. Will definately make again.

I have used this recipe a lot.  But I have a problem with the frosting not being thick enough. It is always runny even when I fold in the whipped cream. So I chill it and than it is thick enough to frost. I follow the attached recipe and I'm just wondering if there is a typo with the milk amount.  Very delicious cake though now my daughter wants this to be her birthday cake instead of chocolate. 
I appreciate any help on this! Mary from Minnesota

Unfortunately my cake didn't rise but it tastes delicious--very dense and moist! I baked it in a 9x13 pan and the height is a little over an inch, so I cut in in half to make 2 squares.  I spread lemon pie filling over one layer, topped that with some of the frosting, added the top layer and frosted the whole.  Extremely lemony and good--I'm wondering if the fact that I used packaged 100% egg whites instead of actual eggs made the difference...

took the advise of other reviewers and used a lemon cake mix.  since duncan hines has reduced the amount of product in their cake mixes (from 18.25 oz to 16.5 oz) i used a 3.4 oz package of lemon instant pudding to boost the lemon flavor.  family loved it!  next time i'm going to add some lemon zest to the cake for a more intense lemon flavor, then decide which way i'll make it after that.

This is delicious and refreshing.  Everyone loved it and many asked for the recipe.  BUT.... I have found that using the 15-16 oz. cake mixes makes a difference -- the cake is much thinner and not as moist.  Boo to the manufacturers for making this change.

This cake was light and delicious. I used a smaller pan (instead of the sheet cake pan) so you do have to cook it longer. As others suggested, I used a lemon cake mix and then lemon pudding for the frosting. I used fresh lemon juice and put some lemon zest in the frosting. As a topping i put blueberries and strawberries.  I would make this again.

I prepared this for my friends and myself and it was delicious! They could not stop raving about it and they took most of it home when they left! It surprised me because it was so easy and delicious! Great with  a summer meal! I topped the icing with whole fresh blueberries and took it to another level!!

Fantastic cake! I used lemon cake mix & lemon pudding, and I also sprinkled a tad of lemon zest on each one after frosting them (I made cupcakes for my son's 7th birthday party). They were a huge hit! Very moist and fluffy, and super easy to make.  I will definitely make this again!

I love lemon and this was soooo yummy! I, too, used Lemon cake mix, and I used instant lemon pudding for the frosting.  I then made this in 2 9x13-in pans and layered them, using a can of Lemon Pie Filling  I found in my pantry.  I took this to treat day at work and had none left over.  I know it was delicious simply by the number of requests for the recipe.  I will definately make this again.

I used two cake mixes and made two 9x13 cakes because the new mixes are only 15.25 ozs. I also used lemon pudding for both the cake and frosting. I layered the cakes with frosting between and it was excellent. Had many compliments.

Very, very good.But, after adding 1 oz. of pudding mix to the whipped topping,icing was very thin and runny,even after 20 min. So, I added the rest of the 3.4 oz box of the pudding mix(couildn't find a 1oz. box)and it was fabulous.

I only had regular milk and regular instant lemon pudding mix and it turned out GREAT.  I used GodivaGirl's recipe Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting to top this delicious cake off :)
Thank you!

The changes I made: lemon cake instead of yellow, lemon pudding (not sugar-free, instead of vanilla for the topping), and no lemon extract in the topping. I baked the cake in a 9x13 pan, it is the biggest I have. My husband and oldest son went WILD for this cake. I thought it was a bit too sweet (but can't really figure out a way to decrease the sugar, since everything is pre-packaged), but still very tasty!

i made this and thought it was ok, not the magical, life-changing lemon cake i was expecting. 

i think the vanilla pudding in the icing, the recipe calls for, takes away from the lemon cake's taste. next time i will use lemon pudding, as others had suggested (i forgot, while I was ta the store. whoops!)

nonetheless, good cake with the potential to be GREAT cake.

This cake is awesome!  I didn't feel like buying the lemon extract so I reversed the flavors.  I used a lemon cake mix with vanilla pudding and lemon pudding with cool whip for the icing.   Thanks!

I made this for my grandmother's birthday and it was a big hit!  I used lemon cake instead of yellow cake as suggested and it was a good balance.  I don't care for lemon desserts but I thought it wasn't too lemony; it was nice.  If I were to bake it again I'd add a little oil in place of some water in the cake batter, and a bit more milk in the pudding/icing mixture.  But overall it was delicious!

I made this cake for my brother's birthday and everyone in our family LOVED it! I paired it with a chocolate butter cream.  The cake has a very light lemon taste so I think I'm going to try adding some extract to the cake next time to give it more of a lemon-y taste. But over all very yummy :)

Made this cake as a double layer in 10 inch round pans. Didn't have any problem with the cake rising. I'm sure if I hadn't beat the cake for the full 4 minutes, it would have been smaller. Husband remarked that it was sort of chewy like a sponge, definitely not light and fluffy. Also placed greased parchment paper in the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking as mentioned in another review. Used Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting by Carol for filling and icing. Also used yelow cake mix as per the recipe, not lemon. Was nice lemon flavor without being overpowering. Pretty good.

Tried this using Lemon Cake.  It was absolutely delicous.  Very light, with the perfect amount of lemony taste.  I will be making this again and again.  Quick and Easy!

Delicious and light. I'm a huge lemon fan and thought this cake could stand a bit more lemon flavor. Maybe I'll add zest next time like other posters mentioned. Still, very good!

Delicious. I used lemon cake mix like most of the reviewers. Baked in 9x13 pan for max time. For the frosting I substituted a packet of lemon kool aid for the lemon extract and instead of whipped topping I whipped my own cream without adding sugar.

This recipe was such a big hit! I made it recently into two 8-inch round cakes and took each cake to a different event....everybody loved them! They are a perfect dessert for summer, so light and airy. I make it following the recipe exactly and I sprinkle lemon zest on the top of the cake for decorative purposes.   You MUST try this cake (if you like lemon, of course)!!!

I love the soft texture of this cake.  I use this as a base recipe for all other boxed cake mixes.  I use the water, eggs or egg whites and the cake mix.  I like this better than using the traditional ingredients.  I make this cake all of the time, but have only made the frosting one time.  I usually just make my homemade vanilla frosting and add some lemon extract to it.  Great cake!

This was a great tasting (but not too sweet), easy cake to make.  And it's less fattening too, with no oil or yokes and cool whip as the main ingredient for the icing.  The consistency of the icing was excellent for decorating.  The only thing I altered was that I used lemon pudding instead of vanilla for the icing.  I made it in two 9 inch rounds.  It was Springtastic with raspberries as a garnish.

This was so easy to make.  It tasted so much better than you would expect box mix to taste.  Note, please DO mix for as long as suggested, especially for the cake batter.  It makes it thick and moist and wonderful.  I made mine into a layer cake, and it was perfect.  As suggested, I substitued everything "vanilla" for lemon flavored things :)

If I could give this cake more stars I would!!   I was given the job of making the dessert for my mom's birthday.  Usually we go out to dinner/dessert or just have an ordinary chocolate sheet cake.  This year we wanted to do something different.  After reading all of the reviews for this cake, I wondered if it could really be as good as people raved.  It was even better.  I followed the recipe almost completely except that I used a lemon cake instead of a yellow cake.  And I also used a 9X13 instead of 10X15.  It was so moist and delicious.  I'm not always a big dessert eater, but I had 2 pieces the night of the party and then 2-3 more the next day.  Everyone in the room, when they sampled the cake just declared loudly, Yum!!  Thanks for posting such a delicious recipe.  I will definitely make again and again and again.

DELICIOUS!!! And LOW in FAT!  I did use lemon cake mix and added lemon pudding mix as well. And for the frosting I used lemon pudding mix again. And make sure you do mix the batter for the full amount of time! This cake was deliciously moist and the icing turned out unbelievable! It just melted in your mouth. A Definite Keeper!

I love doctored cake mix recipes.  This gave a great moist lemony flavor to the yellow cake.  It was not as intense as a traditional boxed Lemon cake mix, which is just what I was looking for.  I would use this again.

This cake is so easy, and turned out very moist and delicious!  I used lemon cake mix with lemon sugar-free fat-free pudding mix, and the lemony taste was just right.  Instead of using this frosting, I  whipped up a batch of the Luscious Buttercream Frosting on this site and added 1/2 tsp. lemon flavoring and a touch of yellow food color.  It was SOOOOO good!

Hi, I made this cake today. I found the Lemon topping i put on it as prescribed by the recipe was very nice and refreshing, but i found the cake it self was not all that fluffy or diffrent when I added the pudding then if I would just made the cake regular from the box and added the whipped cream/lemon extract topping. It was okay nothing to die for.

It was my first time baking a cake, and it turned out DELICIOUS!  Everybody in my family loved it!  I used 2 lemons (zest and juice) instead of lemon extract.  I also made lemon curd for filing.  I would definitely make this again!

I made this for my fiance's birthday, and we both loved it. I used lemon cake and all lemon pudding, and sliced strawberries over the top. Really delicious, and easy to make!

It's also a bonus that it's lighter in calories than most cakes!

Absolutely delicious!  I fixed this for a July 4 cookout (using lemon pudding in the cake and icing) and had lots of rave reviews.  I made it in a 9x13 sheet pan and the texture was great.  I wasn't able to find the smallest pudding packages so I just used half of a regular box in the icing.  Definitely a keeper!

This cake was so completely delicious!  Perfect for summer with it's cool, lemony flavor and light texture.  It almost tastes like a wedding cake - so moist and divine!  I substituted yellow cake with lemon cake mix and added some lemon zest to both cake batter and icing - turned out incredible!  HIGHLY recommend this cake - every single person was begging for the recipe!

This recipe is so quick and easy! It was a hit at the party!  I used the lemon cake and pudding like the other reviewers but I made sure my wet ingredients were all at room tempurature before mixing them in.  Be sure to beat the batter for 4 minutes as directed to ensure a fluffy cake!!

This has become one of our favorite cakes - it is outstanding!  I used a lemon cake mix (the "supreme" kind) and it wasn't too lemon-y.  It's hard to resist!

I used a yellow cake mix, as I prefer a lighter lemon taste. I did substitute lemon pudding mix in the frosting, though.  The cake was good, but not worth the five stars many have given it.  I guess the nice thing about it is that it's not overly sweet.

I didn't read the reviews first and used yellow cake mix...it wasn't as lemony as I would have liked. Next time I'll try lemon cake mix and lemon pudding. I used two 9inch round pans for a two layer birthday cake. Very easy to make and I will try it again with suggested changes.

I made this cake for a surprize party along with a traditional chocolate cake.
The lemon cake disappeared before I had a change to cut into the other cake.  The only suggestion I would make is to change the cake mix to lemon and add a 1/2 tsp of lemon extract.  The frosting I also change to lemon.  This is a great cake and I would recommend it to anyone.

I thought this cake was delicious!.  I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan.  When it cooled down, it flattened a little and sunk in the middle.  I just slapped on more icing.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

The cake is so moist and flavorful.  Got rave reviews!! Turned out a little brown so it needs a glaze or fosting.  Goes well with a cream cheese frosting.

This is an excellent recipe. I followed the advice of others and made it with 
lemon cake and pudding mixes. Loved the topping because it wasn't like that sweet icing stuff. Everyone loved it.

I cannot express how much this recipe is loved in my circle of family and friends! It is the absolute hit of every function I make it for. My best friend, who has "birthday pies" because she hates cake even loves this cake! What's best, it's super easy to make! Try this cake, I'm sure you will love it as much as we do!!!

Refreshing and delicious.  I followed a suggestion on another review and used a lemon cake mix.  I didn't have any lemon extract, so I mixed 1 can of lemon pie filling with the whipped topping for the topping on the cake.  I didn't have a 10X15 inch pan, so I used an 11X14 inch pan which worked just as well.  This cake was very moist and was a big hit with my family.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe.  It will be great for summer get togethers!

Delicious lower calorie cake! I used a package of sugar free instant lemon pudding mix in both the cake and the topping. I did not add the lemon extract to the topping. I used 4 egg whites instead of 3 and used 1 1/3 c water (wanted to compensate for cake mixes now being 3 oz smaller than most recipes list). I loved that the cake had a light texture and a very fine, almost smooth crumb, but was not at all gummy or rubbery. A delightful dessert.

I’ve been making a version of this cake for years. This recipe will produce a delicately flavored lemon cake, however it was written years ago before the sly cake mix people made the mixes smaller.  Prior to 2011 cake mixes were 18.25 oz. Now they’re 15.25 oz. I know, I also feel betrayed.

I made this recipe two weeks in a row for my 9-year old lemon-loving son who requested lemon cake as his birthday cake (made cupcakes). After reading many of the reviews along with trial and error, I can say without hesitation that whipping the egg whites first and then folding them in is essential to the consistency of the cake. Additionally, per many recommendations, I used lemon cake mix & part real lemon juice in lieu of water (I juiced three lemons, then added water to equate to 1 3/4 cup). To save time, I used store-bought lemon frosting so I can't comment on the topping.

I used whole milk instead of low-fat milk and the icing was a little lumpy but still good. It’s best to get low-fat milk, but if you can’t, it’s not bad.

This was an ok-tasting cake, but it sank within minutes. It ended up being very dense. I used lemon cake mix as other reviewers suggested, which I recommend - I don't think it would be lemony enough otherwise. The "frosting" was horrible because it was so runny and made the cake even more gooey. With quite a few improvements and changes, this could be a good recipe… I'm sorry to leave a negative review. This cake just wasn't what I was hoping for.

I am diabetic so I made this using sugar free white cake mix. You can find this at grocery stores in the regular cake mix aisle. I also used sugar free pudding mix. This cake is awesome! I definitely could not have eaten it without changing to sugar free ingredients. I will make again!

I used a glass pan, so the cake took longer to bake. Also, it made it a bit dense. I’ll try a metal sheet pan next time. To make the frosting even more delicious, I used homemade whipped cream instead of Cool Whip.

This cake turned out beautifully!  I used a lemon cake mix with pudding already in the mix, lemon pudding instead of vanilla in the topping, and lemon juice instead of lemon extract.  I will make this one again!

Didn't like the heavy consistency of the cake. Also quite flat looking and not visually appealing either. Wouldn't make it again

I made this cake for my 4 year old’s “yellow” birthday. She didn’t care for it, but she’s 4 and has poor taste. Everyone else loved it, especially the light frosting. I accidentally got cheesecake sugar-free pudding instead of vanilla and worried it might be strange, but the results were great.

If you love lemon cake you will love this recipe.  Its easy to make and so flavorful.  Plus the frosting is so light and the cake is incredibly moist.  Even the people I served it to who weren't big cake people said it was amazing.  A definite keeper.

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday and the whole family loved it! It has a nice light lemon flavor. I also used lemon cake mix and then lemon pudding in the topping as well. It's a nice summertime dessert served cold.

Absolutely the best light summer lemon cake ever! Added 1/4c lemon juice to cake batter, used lemon pudding in both cake and topping, and added 1/4c lemon juice to topping. Not too lemony at all! Perfect!!!!

This cake was awful! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out awful! I even made it again thinking I must have sober something wrong but no, I was so embarrassed to serve this at our family get together. It's like a super dense sponge...like a thick foam mattress.

Yes, I will make it again. It was light and had a very lemony taste which I like. I should have looked at the number of carbs in it. I'm surprised there were 30.

I followed the directions as closely as I could, the exception being that I split the batter into 2-9" round pans. The toothpick was clean after 25 minutes, but once cooled the cakes had a strange slimy texture on the outside of them, almost as if they were under cooked. The frosting was not my favorite either. My fiance (the birthday boy) likes a really tangy lemon frosting, but after tripling the amount of lemon extract it still didn't have the tang I was looking for. I ended up making a lemon cream cheese frosting instead. All in all, the cakes tasted really good, but I definitely would make some alterations if I were to make this again.

ANY Cake recipe that has it's first ingredient as a "yellow cake mix" should be thrown out as a "recipe".. Oh, unless you consider opening a can of pork n beans and heating them up as cooking.

Made it today for family gathering and was asked to make it for a birthday party in a few weeks.
Changes I made: I added a thin layer of strawberry jam between layers and secured with toothpicks until I was ready to add topping. Removed toothpicks before topping and served with assorted berries on the top and sides of serving plate for a more festive presentation. 
Notes: very dense cake, more like pound cake than box cake mix is typically. Does not rise very much. Kept refrigerated before and after adding topping and berries, chilling enhances refreshing aspect of this dessert.

Made this using the lemon cake mix and fresh lemon juice as suggested by others.  I was making two 8 inch layered cakes, so I tripled the cake recipe since others commented it didn't rise much and split the extra between the four layers.  The cake layers were the perfect size.  Used the raspberry filling suggested by others, and made Martha Stewart's lemon cream cheese frosting (doubling the amount of lemon juice).   Everyone raved about how great it was.  Even had a baker tell me it was the best lemon cake she had ever had.

This cake is so delicious!  After reading several reviews I used a lemon cake mix and lemon pudding for the cake and frosting. I added lemon zest to the frosting as well as topped it off with zest. My husband loved the cake. I wil be making it again.

I made this for my daughter's 15th birthday. This cake definitely does not rise very much but it tastes great. My husband said that this was one of the best cakes I've made. I did as the other reviewers suggested  and made the frosting with lemon pudding and added lemon juice to the mix. I thought that it might be too much lemon but it wasn't at all. The frosting is light and creamy.

5 stars!! This is an excellent cake. I really like the frosting! Delicious!
I used real lemon. I was a bit confused because on the cake mix box, it said to use oil, so i added oil, but not alot. I like the pudding idea in both the cake AND the frosting. I used 3 whole eggs, as i like the nutrition in eggs. Of course, my cake was dense and not fluffy line the picture shown here, but delish nonetheless. Thank you for this recipe!! Will make again soon!

Made this for Easter dessert, was delicious! Had a great lemon flavor. Folks even went back for 2nds. As others have recommended I used a lemon cake mix and followed directions on box but cut water down by 2 tablespoons and added 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice. Made in 13X9 pan. 
For the icing substituted lemon pudding for the vanilla and was very tasty. This is a keeper and will make again.

This was just okay to me. I love to bake and I love a good lemon cake so I tried this out for my Moms birthday.  It didn't hot that "amazing" spot that I was hoping it would. Tasted good but not as good as other cakes I have made. The search for an amazing lemon cake recipe continues ...

This was excellent and a hit at a recent funeral potluck.  I used lemon cake mix (what I had on hand, with no pudding in cake batter); and followed remainder of directions closely.  Delicious, light, and very easy!

My cake turned out very flat and mushy in the middle. The problem is that there is no oil.

Loved this recipe! I used it instead of dessert cups for strawberries in syrup . Yum! The whipped cream topping is fabulous as well and I will make this to use on other desserts in the future. Definitely a recipe to keep. I did not make any changes to the recipe. Thanks for posting this!

Very easy to make and delicious when done.  I added more lemon into both the frosting and the cake mix to make it even more flavorful.

I made this yesterday for our  family Easter dessert and it was a HUGE hit.  We all had to have seconds.  Wonderful, simple to make, light and spongy and just the right amount of "lemony"!!  This recipe is going into my "keepers"!!  Thanks LaDonna !!

Bummer!! I was hoping my cake would turn out as great as the others, but it was a mess. Tasted more like a warm pudding than anything else. Perhaps I undercooked it, but I had to make an entirely new cake bc this was a mushy mess.

My guy (a lemon cake fan) really liked the cake itself. I switched out the yellow cake mix for lemon but otherwise baked it as instructed. It took 40 min for the toothpicks to come out clean. This rose nicely in the oven but fell when it cooled. The result was a dense cakey brownie consistency. I didn't care for it at all, especially when I wasted egg yolks on it.

I made the frosting with the lemon extract, regular instant lemon pudding, and homemade sweetened whipped cream. Oddly enough this was my favorite part. The topping is a nice touch but next time I might leave out the pudding mix entirely and just make lemon sweetened whipped cream for a topping. Some fruit might help too- some sort of berry I would think. My guy didn't care for the topping though. Go figure. 

This recipe gets 3 stars across the board. If it were up to me I would score it lower but the mister, a known picky eater, liked it so I have to give credit for that.

Wonderful Cake!  This cake tastes like a little bit of sunshine.  I made it for our daughter's birthday and my mother loved it so much that she requested I make it for her birthday as well.  I used 2-9" round pans and the trick is to really let the cake cool completely before constructing it with the frosting/topping. As for the frosting/topping - I used Lemon Instant Jell-O pudding rather than use lemon extract. It is our new "go to" recipe for a fantastic cake.

Too fake tasting, no natural lemon coming through at all, even when using lemon pudding mix, 1/2 lemon juice instead of water and lemon extract in both the cake and frosting. Also, the lemon cake mix said it already included pudding. Not sure if that affected the baking time, but it took more like 40-45 minutes for 2 8" rounds.

I made this cake last night and it was amazing.  I added some lemon juice and lemon zest to the cake mix and I substituted the water for buttermilk, which I had in the fridge. Also, like others did, I used a lemon pudding for the topping, lemon zest and a little lemon juice along with the cool whip and mixed it all up. The cake was light and fluffy. I baked the cake in a decorative bundt pan. My guests all wanted seconds. This is a great recipe

I was confused after reading all the reviews of this cake, so it was with some trepidation that I made it for my husband's birthday. I used the Duncan Hinds Supreme lemon cake with lemon pudding and lemon juice in place of some of the water. Some reviewers found the cake light and fluffy, others said it was dense and heavy... I wanted something in between, so I used one whole egg and two whites, and carefully adjusted the liquid so that the batter wasn't too thick or thin. The topping was coolwhip and instant vanilla pudding (not sugar-free).  It came out fine, and everyone liked it a lot, even though it wasn't chocolate ;-)

This cake turned out great, and the whole household enjoyed it, apparently it is getting added to the Thanksgiving menu as well. The only adjustment I made was to substitute Carnation milk instead of the suggested nonfat milk - everything else I kept the same. My hubbie took it some of it to work the next day, and I ended up sending the recipe to one of his co-worker's to share with their family, and another requested that I bring one to their next gathering!

I know I'm in the minority here, but I found this cake incredibly dull.   The cake is not noteworthy, the frosting is light, but odd.    It seemed like a recipe you'd find on the back of a pudding box or something. This is not going to move out of the cake pan very fast, so I'm saying goodbye to this recipe.

Not that good, the cake is very dense, did not rise, and the only chg I made was added lemon zest and the juice of one lemon. The frosting was ok, but I did not see a 1 oz package of pudding, the smallest one is 3.4 oz in regular ( I don't like the sugarfree ones). Plus frosting not thick enough to hold a two layer cake together, taste good though.

Awesome cake and a big hit with co-workers. The perfect summer cake. I did what one reviewer suggested and used the juice of a lemon for part of the water and topped it with strawberries. Will most certainly make this again.

This recipe is outstanding. I love the texture of this cake so much, I use the base ingredients to start nearly every cake I bake now. I just change up the cake flavor, pudding flavor, and have used several different extracts to create other creations. Any time I make this, I'm always asked for the recipe.

Really good - I modified for a teacake - like dessert.  I made per the directions but I only put about half of the batter into a 9x 13 lined with parchment.  When cooled, I cut out circles with a narrow wine glass so that they fit a regular-sized cupcake cup. I then topped with the frosting and refrigerated.  It served well with cake balls as a dessert.  It did not rise a lot but I wanted it that way.   Very spongy and nice.

this is so moist!! Great recipe, easytoo. I didn't have a 1 ounce paskage of pudding for the  frosting so I used a 3/4 ounce package and it was fine. It's a "do over " in my house.~ I think next time I'll do a chocolate one for the kids.

My husband loves lemon cake, and the lemony-ness of this one was a hit!  I'm not familiar with 1oz. packages of pudding mix, and couldn't find any, so I used the regular 3.4 oz. pkg of instant lemon pudding mix, and increased the milk to 1 cup. Turned out great!

Used lemon cake mix and pudding mix as mentioned before. No big issues with the cake rising properly due to thorough mixing. Added zest and juice from real lemons to the topping instead of extract. Yum.

I haven't even tasted the cake yet, but I licked the bowl and it was amazing, it is our dessert tonight, I topped mine with strawberries as the store didn't have any raspberries in.  I also used lemon cake mix.  I also used the instant sugar free lemon pudding for the frosting, the bowl was finger licking good!!!  I will come back after eating it to let you know how awesome it tastes

loved this cake, the only thing I changed was adding an 8 oz cream cheese to the icing, I don't normally like lemon but this cake has changed my mind. I have made it several times and it doesn't last long in my house or work.

Super moist! I made these for my daughter's birthday with lemon cake mix and 1/4 c. lemon juice added to 1 1/2 c. water. AMAZING! (I used a different icing, so the 5 stars are just for the cake.)

I was surprised at how absolutely delicious and moist these were. I also used lemon pudding mix in the frosting and subbed some lemon juice for water. I don't do dairy, so soy milk worked just fine in the frosting. This made 18 cupcakes and one 8x8 cake for me. I could never eat just one; very dangerous for the waistline to keep around!

The frosting is what I had problems with. The pudding lumped up. I think it needed much more milk. The pudding mix says 2 cups milk; 1 1/2 cups for a mousse that includes the pudding and 1 1/2 cups thawed free Cool Whip Free.

I made two 9-inch round and made sure to cool them well before i tried removing them as i heard they tended to fall apart that way. i also made it by having a third layer made of a white cake mix with some added melted white chocolate and homemade white mini white chocolate chips to the batter as i felt it would compliment the light texture well. then, after i frosted the whole cake (i made double the frosting) i took some white chocolate shavings and covered the sides of the cake with them. The cake looked and tasted AMAZING and everyone was complimenting its light texture!!!

This was sooo  good!  I brought it to a family reunion and it was gone in 15 minutes.  Everyone raved about it.  It was a very hot day and the cool whip topping wasn't very fluffy (it melted) because of that, but it still tasted great.  In hot weather I may use another type of frosting, or maybe even a glaze because I can't imagine putting anything too heavy on the cake.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious!! Everyone who tried it loved it.  Very easy to make also.  Next time I might try it with a whie icing and add the lemon extract to that.  I don't care for whipped topping very much.

This was so easy to make and very yummy!  I did as others suggested and used lemon cake and lemon pudding.  I used the juice of one lemon (about a quarter cup) in place of some of the water.  I didn't have any lemon extract, but used the zest of one lemon.  I thought it was good that way :)  I might use half of the cool whip last time.. I thought it was too much of the topping.

This cake was a hit at the office!  It's especially tasty when it's super chilled with extra lemony coolwhip frosting.  I wasn't able to find the lemon cake mix that a lot of people suggested but I did use lemon pudding for both the cake mix and frosting.  So quick and easy to make!  Light, lemony and refreshing!!!

I made this for my sons 9th bday. I doubled the recipe to make it two layers.I also decorated it with strawberries and rasberries like the flag. It wasdelicious!! The whole cake was eaten in the same day and that's unusual for us. I've always bought my sons bday cakes and end up throwing the leftover cake out. Everyone loved it and I think its because it was really lite and not too sugary and sweet tasting. Great cake for hot summer/ july party. I will be making this again.

I took this cake in for my birthday buddy at work and everybody raved about it and wanted the recipe.  I altered it slighty by adding a couple of teaspoons of lemon zest to the batter.  Instead of using her icing, I made a standard cream cream icing which I thinned by cutting back slightly on the powdered sugar and adding two teaspoons of organic lemon concentrate.  I also added a couple of teaspoons of zest to the icing.  For some color I sprinkled it with yellow colored sugar.  Right before serving I garnished it with fresh raspberries.

THis was very good! Changed it a little because I combined it with another recipe on here (Pineapple Lemon Cake): Used 1 1/4 cup pineapple juice instead of the water and added the drained, crushed pineapple to the whipped cream mixture. Made it fattening, ie, whole eggs and regular milk and regular pudding mix (used lemon pudding mix) (: Also added coconut to the top of the whipped topping mix.

Kudos, LaDonna. This is a delicious cake. It is my husband's annual birthday cake. Lemon is his favorite and the flavor of this cake is excellent. I also love the whipped topping because I'm not a fan of traditional, super-sweet frosting. Thanks for sharing!

This cake is GREAT. I love that it is made without oil, with no yolks and is almost fat free. It is springy and light and a perfect summer treat. I was concerned that I mis-read the recipe and was supposed to make the cake mix by the directions then add the ingredients, but no, it turned out great. I used lots of lemon juice instead of the extract. Will try with Lemon Cake Mix next time.

I modified the recipe so that the bread was lemon bread and I replaced some of the watter with lemon juice and my family could not get enough. 20 servings lasted only 1 day.

soooooo good!!! I made this even more low fat buy using non fat frozen whipped topping. I also used lemon cake mix and lemon pudding mix.  I made this and bought another one for a baby shower and eveyone ate this one and asked for the recipe!!! so moist!! oh, I also used a 9x13 cake pan and the cake rose great. you definately need to mix it for the full time suggested.

I also used the lemon cake mix - I mixed according to the directions but the cake still 'shrank' after I removed from the oven, which really is not a big deal. This cake was MUCH MUCH better after being in the fridge all night - tasted like a different cake on day 2! I really like it and is a GREAT alternative to the fat and oily other ones!! I will make this again, soon.

I did not make the frosting that goes with this cake, but the cake part was very good! You would never know it's low fat :) I might try next time with a lemon cake mix for more lemon flavour. I topped with Lemon Icing from this site.

I made this cake for a Fourth of July cook-out and put fresh blueberries on the top with a red star in the middle. Everyone thought it looked great and tasted delicious! This definitely a keeper!

This was just ok.  It was nothing special, and most people at the picnic I brought it to weren't interested.  Probably won't make it again.

This was great! I actually messed up the recipe and added 3/4c of milk to the cake batter. This made for a very moist and dense cake - still great tasting and I think  I like it better this way. I also used a lemon cake mix. Everything turned out wonderful.

This cake was light and very good. I took the advise of some of the others and only used 1 cup of hot water and used yellow cake mix. This one will be a keeper.

This was good - very light tasting - but not out of this world good.  I did use lemon cake mix and lemon pudding, although I could not find a 1 oz. pudding box as the recipe says, so I used the regular 3.4 oz. box.  Also baked in a 10x13 pan and it came out perfect in size.

Nice & Light tasting.  I did not have yellow cake mix so I used lemon and I used sugar-free instant lemon pudding mix along with the sugar-free vanilla pudding which is what I am assuming the recipe meant.  Will make again.  Thanks LaDonna

This is a very easy recipe.  I used lemon cake mix and lemon pudding instead of yellow cake mix and vanilla pudding.  Turned out delicious!! Be sure to beat cake mix as directed.  It gets really fluffy.

This recipe was okay, but not great.  It was not very lemony - mostly a vanilla flavor.  If I were to make it again, I think I'd try using a lemon cake mix (instead of yellow cake), and lemon pudding mix in the frosting (instead of vanilla).
