What can I say other than it was really good and everyone ate every bit. I did also make a pan with 1/2 potato and 1/2 cauliflower that worked nice as well. Some liked using just cauliflower even better than using traditional potatoes. Either way this recipe is a total keeper and next time I'll try and take a picture to add  :)

This is cauliflower boiled in cheese. I made it according to the recipe, and it had large amounts of extra liquid (a combo of grease, water, and cream) that was really, really gross. I didn't even add any salt and it was waaaay too salty. The garlic couldn't even save it! This was a waste of a lot of good cheese. Too bad, because I really wanted it to be good!

This is really cheesy! I halved the sauce part as I didn't have a large head of cauliflower. I reduced the salt and pepper to 1/4 tsp each. I used 6 oz shredded cheddar and 4 oz shredded Italian mix cheese (by weight) and only sprinkled a couple of tbsps of Romano cheese on the top with the smoked paprika as there was already a lot of cheese.
Mine baked in 30 minutes at 375 as I had it in the oven with the other side dishes I was making.
I made this for the Allrecipes Allstars Canada April Challenge #ARFaceless
