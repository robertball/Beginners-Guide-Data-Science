I am laughing reading these reviews, watching the pains everyone's taking to assemble it right!  Hehe.  Anyway, my "build" idea is this (seems complicated, but it's not).  Heat the empty tray under the broiler.  Meanwhile, LIGHTLY toast the bread -- you just want it dried out, not actually toasted.  Butter the sides of the bread that will face down.  On one slice, stack corned beef, sauerkraut and cheese on top; on the OTHER slide, stack beef, cheese, then kraut on top.  Take the baking sheet out, place the two stacked halves next to eachother, and broil.  When done, slide them off with a spatula, top with dressing, and combine.  Now you have altnerating layers of heaven, and the bread should be buttery, crunchy, not burnt, and not soggy.  GREAT recipe! :)

Great sandwich - definitely the "Real" deal! This is a classic and I guess that's why it's one of my favorites. This was so good and so easy to make. If you use good quality ingredients you'll end up with a good quality sandwich. I toasted by bread lightly first with a bit of butter then assembled it and heated it in the oven until the cheese was nice and melty. I used "Thousand Island Dressing II" from this site. Perfect for a quick meal - YUM!

Oh my gosh, this is soooo good! One of my absolute favorite sandwiches! That being said, here is my method for making "grilled" sandwiches- toast the bread in the toaster, assemble the sandwich, place it on a plate in the microwave for 1 minute (or less). You get the toasted texture and melted cheese without frying it in butter. This also works for grilled cheese, tuna melts, etc.

This was a great recipe.  I followed chefsingledad's suggestion on how to assemble it.  Only disappointing thing was the kraut and meat was cool, while the bread and cheese were hot from broiling.  Next time I will microwave th kraut and meat first to be sure the whole sandwich is nice and hot.  Thanks for a good recipe!

You are really missing out on a great recipe if you don't try Pam Anderson's Classic Reuben Sandwich.  You really need to use a skillet to get everything heated just right.  The ingredients are similar but the cooking techinique makes a HUGE difference.

My hubby and I just got back from a trip to Nashville where he swore he had the best Reuben sandwich at a place called the Palms....until now! I put this together following the advice of other reviewers, with the exception of using smoked turkey and pastrami because that's the way he likes his, and wow what a sandwich! He even woke up in the middle of the night talking about it! I used the marble bread and toasted it a bit before putting it in the oven. It turned out wonderful!

Sensational!  I used lighter colored Rye bread due to preference.  I buttered the top of the bread (so the bread doesn't fall apart) and broiled them until lightly crispy and then assembled the sandwich and warmed.  You have to be really quick or the bottom piece of bread will get soggy.  It's best to make an extra sandwich rather than piling it high.  I use to cook my sandwich on a skillet but this is a lot quicker and much tastier!

Great recipe!  The dark rye is oh-so-essential, but it's tough to gauge the degree of browning.  Keep an eye on this fellow in the pan ;-)

This indeed is the real thing! I too spread a little butter on each slice (so that the bread would be "toasted") and used a larger baking sheet that could hold 6 ruebens and flipped after 2 minutes to evenly broil both sides. Also, I used deli-sliced swiss and when they were done, I re-opened the sandwiches carefully to add the thousand island dressing on the sandwich. Corned beef is not my favorite meat...but who can pass up a sandwich this good? Thanks Al!!

Al, thank you, thank you, thank you!  Rubens are my favorite but I was never able to do them right at home.  I always fried them but my cheese didn't melt and my sauerkraut was cold.  Broiling is definately the trick.  YUM!

My mother made these for us all our lives growing up....but never 1,000 Island dressing!  Don't know where that comes from but a real rueben sandwich has spicy or regular mustard......everything else is perfect.....but as far as a true german rueben.....lose the 1,000 island dressing

While at the supermarket the other day I wasn't sure what to make for dinner but then got the idea for Reuben sandwiches. So I bought all the ingredients I thought I'd need.  When I got home I hopped onto AR just to make sure I had everything right.  I didn't think I'd ever follow an actual recipe for a sandwich but after reading the reviews I did follow a few of the suggestions... I pre-heated the cookie sheet, made sure to butter the bread, and alternated the corned beef, sauerkraut, and cheese on each slice.  Baked at 350 for a few minutes and then turned to broil for another minute or so.  Came out toasty on the outside and warm all the way through!!

Sorry, folks, but a Reuben is, by definition and tradition, grilled. A panini press will do this quite satisfactorily--and easily. Serving a Kosher pickle spear with the Reuben is also traditional.

I made this more like a grilled cheese by buttering the bread and pan-frying it.  I also used pastrami.  Wonderful!

It's a great recipe, but I can't give it 5 stars, because Russian dressing beats the thousand island variety hands down, especially when it comes to this amazing sandwich.  Oh yes, and the bread?  BUTTERED.

I love reubens and this recipe is  especially delicious.  But I never really cared for the traditional corned beef, (deli, baked, or boiled) - too tough.  So I bought a fresh slab from the meat dept., threw it in the crock pot with some water and the seasoning packet and cooked it on low for about 8 or 9 hours.  EXCELLENT!!  This made great sandwiches.  I will never eat corned beef or reubens any other way.  I too buttered the bread and made the sandwich like I would a grilled cheese, in a pan.

This recipe is good but to make it easier to assemble, I squeeze dry the sauerkraut and mix the 1000 Island dressing with the kraut in a bowl. Then go as the recipe states or use a sandwich grill or electric skillet instead of the oven-broiler. This is a sandwich for a celebration and not for everyday. (This sandwich was named  for Mr. Reuben (note spelling) Kulakofsky in Omaha Nebraska whose midnight poker group invented it in the 1920s.) Enjoy it as if you just won the poker game ! Thanks to Reuben.

Loved this idea. I am assuming on the recipe the sandwich is broiled with ingredients on both slices of bread and then combined. The bread doesn't get toasted this way. ChefSingleDad's review helped tremendously. I was making a pan full and didn't want to stand there pan grilling 2 at a time. I didn't toast the bread first and forgot to heat the pan, but did heat the corned beef up. I put the reuben together first. The bottom didn't get toasted enough using this method without flipping them over. And the inside was not hot enough although the cheese did melt. I may try the broiling again with toasting the bread first and heating up the insides before assembly and flip when one side of the bread is toasted, or heat the pan which should toast the bottom then. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great.  I took some ideas from other comments.  We used corned beef which were leftovers from a dinner, so it wasn't the deli thin-sliced kind.  The taste was superb.  Instead of buttering the outsides of the bread, olive oil was brushed on the outsides and the sandwich was cooked for a few minutes on each side using an electric skillet.  

We really enjoyed this Reuben.  Thank you!

Good sandwich, quick and easy to make. Followed some of the suggestions. Lightly toasted the bread then buttered it before putting it in the oven.

Really good.  It would have helped to have more specific assembly instructions.  I had been having a reuben craving and I this was close to what I wanted.

Sorry, this did not work.  I even followed ChefSingleDad's suggestions to get it to come out crispy.  They weren't soggy, but I still had to fry them in the pan.  If you're going to eat this many calories, it has got to be good.

Had a reuben at a diner in Maryland with cole slaw instead of sour kraut and munster instead of swiss and have been making it that way ever since.  This is good but not even close those substitutions.

I chose THIS recipe as my favorite, over the other ones here on allrecipes.com, because this one suggests the DARK RYE bread. To me, this is the most important part! It's not a true Reuben sandwich if you don't use dark rye (in my opinion)!   :-)

I didn't have to toast the bread first (I was going to based on other reviews, but I forgot! The bread came out crispy anyway.) and I spread butter on the bread before broiling.  Also, I put the thousand island on before broiling.  They turned out great!

The reason I like this recipe over the other ones here on Allrecipes is because this one suggests the dark rye. To me, its a very important part, and really just completes the sandwich. I do mine on a stove-top griddle and its a cinch to do.

This was really yummy. I fed it to a bunch of sports watching men and they all wanted seconds. The recipe is almost perfect...something was off just a tiny bit and I can't put my finger on it. Perhaps it was the dressing I used.

I almost didn't post a comment for this one because I failed miserably in making it and it came out too wet.  I was very  upset because this is my DH's favorite sandwich.  I even paid special attention to the comments other reviewers had made ( specially Chefsingledad's).  I gave it 4 stars because I have every reason to believe that it was me and not the recipe that went wrong.  I will however try again sometime (when I'm less traumatized) by failure...  :(

3.18.18 A local German restaurant serves a Red Reuben, so that’s what I turned this into today.  The only changes are using sweet-sour red cabbage (I had some Uli’s Apple Red Cabbage in the freezer, a recipe from this site)) instead of sauerkraut and some German mustard instead of thousand island dressing.  You’d be surprised how good this combo is.  I used rye bread, not pumpernickel, and grilled this stovetop rather than broiling.  Not rocket science here, just a tasty deli sandwich using corned beef left from yesterday, St. Patrick’s Day.

I heat the kraut and the meat in the microwave before I assemble the sandwich.  I also prefer it using Orowheat or Arnold brand Extra Sour Rye Bread.  I lightly toast it first, then spread one side with butter, assemble the sandwich on the non buttered side and broil them using my tongs to turn them half way through.  Hot throughout and perfect every time!

Living in a higher altitude I broiled for 4 minutes. Scorched the top. Note to others that 4 minutes may be too much. Needs a little more flavoring. I doubled the cheese but didn't taste it. Lacks a little, but still fairly decent.

Better if you use a paninni press or some other kitchen grilling implement ( even a frying pan would work) and butter both sides of the bread before you put in the press.  Try a pastrami reuben for a very tasty alternative to corned beef

Never until I landed in Ontario did they even suggest putting 1000 Islands dressing on it - all the ingredients are fine - the only thing to add is your preferred mustard variety

Mmm...I love reubens. What makes this even better is using Dorthy Lynch dressing instead of thousand island. Unfortunately, it is hard to find outside of Nebraska.

I substituted Sourdough Bread, I used Hellman’s Mayonnaise on bottom slice, layered corned beef, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, very thin layer Stone Ground Mustard. In saucepan, heat butter (real salted butter best). Toast each side. It was delicious. Served with Roasted Red Pepper & Tomato Soup with a dollop of sour cream, garnished with shavings of green scallions

Bottom piece of bread was a bit soggy.  I buttered the bread and put that side down on the cookie sheet.  Then put a layer of  homemade Thousand Island dressing, then the corned beef, then the sauerkraut and finally the Swiss cheese.  I broiled this then topped with another slice of rye bread that was buttered on one side and had the homemade Thousand Island dressing. So based on my changes the soggy bottom slice of bread may have been my own fault. In any event VERY TASTY.

my local deli was out of corned beef So I had to buy the can which was my fault.  I did not care for this sandwich but will try a gain with better meat next time.

OOOOhhhhhhh, so delicious!  I made this using leftover corned beef and sauerkraut.  We loved it.  I served this with 'Cranberry Waldorf' from AR and we had a wonderful meal.

Quick easy recipe and it tastes great. I tried what Chefsingledad said about using the butter but it actually made the bottom pieces some what soggy.  I would suggest just lightly toasting the bread and NOT using any butter when putting it on the baking sheet.

The method seems faulty as mentioned by others. I was concerned after reading "soggy" reviews so I broiled just the bread first. When I flipped it the bottom was already soggy. I then lightly broiled that side to dry it out and added the sandwich fillings. I used regular rye bread, shredded corned beef I had cooked, and reduced the amount of dressing(homemade).

This is so good. I cooked my in Forman Grill like a paninni. It's great with horseradish on the side.

This one will be perfect if replacing thousand island dressing with Russian dressing.
