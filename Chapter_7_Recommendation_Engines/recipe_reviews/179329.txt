I use both Absolut raspberry and cranberry vodka in this mix, and I double the shots. Potent and very good.

First "tini" I ever made. Couldn't find raspberry liqueur so I substituted pomegranate liqueue. Fantastic!! Now I know why they say "shaken, not stirred"; there is a difference. If you are going to makie martini's of any kind, get a shaker.
