This recipe was incredibly simple. I added a lemon syrup made of 1/4 c lemon juice and 1/4 c of sugar. Placed on low heat until sugar dissolves and pour over cake. I also added a lemon glaze made of 1 c confectioner's sugar (sifted) 1 3/4 Tbs of lemon juice whipped together until smooth, and poured over a completely cooled cake. It was outstanding. Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe makes an excellent pound cake in my estimation...there's just not enough lemon flavour to justify its name.  That's the only reason for four stars instead of 5.
I added lemon zest to the batter; then drizzled a lemon juice/sugar solution over the fresh-out-of-the-oven cake and the lemon flavour was still very subtle.  However, that being said, this is still an excellent pound cake and I won't hesitate to use this recipe again.  

By the way, I didn't cut in the butter as per instructions. I creamed the butter with sugar & egg, added the extracts, then added the dry ingredients alternately with the milk.  Took about 50 minutes until done.

This recipe has compelled me to write a review!  Do not make this cake. I did not care for this recipe. And if I could have given it a negative star I would have.  It took over an hour and a half to cook, not 30 minutes. The crumb was uneven in many places as well as flavors. And of course the crust was hard as a rock, but amazingly despite the 1hr 45 min cooking time , the inside was moist. I was forced to make a glaze because the cake isn't sweet enough.  The Glazed Lemon Bundt Cake is much better.  All that said...  I wish people on this site would rate recipes only if they've actually used it as is. Frankly I am tired of people listing the dozen or so changes that they make to a recipe then giving it 4 or 5 stars!

This recipe works best for muffins! I used the same ingredients, but first mixed the flour, b.powder & salt. Then, separately, I creamed the sugar and butter and added the rest of the ingredients to this. I then folded in the dry ingredients to the wet. They made 12 muffins and cooked in 27 minutes. I also added a lemon glaze on top, and they were delicious!!!

I think that you might have been using a convection oven because I had to bake this cake for at least 1 hour. I added a little more lemon than the recipe calls for and it turned out fantastic!! Thanks Kimberly.

This cake is really spongy and moist. I used cake flour instead and it turned out just sooo delicious. I baked it for 55 minutes but it didn't matter. My boyfriend is a picky cake eater, but he ate half loaf after he gave it a try!

Great texture and VERY easy to make.  I also used 1 1/2 recipe to fill a 9x5 loaf pan and it baked about 70 minutes. I found it had a little too much salt and would have liked more lemon flavor. Added lemon zest and next time will add more and maybe some lemon juice.  Could change the extract to almond, toss in some mini choc chips and have a totally different yummy cake!

I added lemon zest and juice from one lemon as other reviewers did, which punched up the flavor considerably.  However this loaf took MUCH longer than 1/2 hr to cook, more like an hour.  It rose nicely in the oven, but when I took it out it fell considerably and became a condensed lemon puck!  I think it might have something to do with the cutting in of the butter and not creaming the sugar and butter together??  What other cake/loaf recipie cuts in butter?  Too many changes are needed to make this recipie worthwhile - I would suggest trying another.

Good recipe- I made 1 and a half the ingredients because I had a bigger loaf pan (9" by 5") and then cooked it for 1 hour and 10 mins. I also used cake flour (made the cake light and fluffy) but had no lemon essence so used one lemon and some zest of the lemon. This may not have been enough lemon for me but as I also made a lemon syrup to pour on the cake straight after it came out of the oven (see previous reviews), this really zinged up the lemon flavour. It was GREAT!!! and I will definitely make this cake again and again!

One correction: baking time is 75 minutes. Besides that, this is the best pound cake I've ever made or had.. totally out of this world! And I make over a dozen type of pound cakes. I didn't have lemon extract, so I substituted 2 teaspoons of Limoncello.

This was exactly what I was looking for.  I have now made it twice and my kids and bf loved it.  It took longer than 30 minutes to bake though - more like 45-50.  The second time, I added one cup of frozen cranberries for extra tartness.  Easy and delicious.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

It tastes really good, but I must be doing something wrong because it is not done in 30 minutes.  It takes 50 minutes for this to bake. Has anyone else had this problem?

Excellent! Used the juice of one lemon instead of the extract (just because I had one in the fridge), so I baked for an extra 10 minutes to compensate for the extra liquid, what a great, not too sweet treat!

I am giving this 4 stas because it was so simple to make and very good. It was,however, more like a quick bread than a cake - hence, the instructions for cutting in the butter. I noticed some people decided to beat the butter with the sugar, as they would with a cake but I found it worked fine as written. Keep in mind that this method requires a light hand (as in making biscuits) so if you cut in the butter, I would recommend making a well for the wet ingredients and mixing only until blended. I did add a sugar and lemon juice glaze as recommended by another user and this did add a nice lemon flavour. Good recipe - will make again.

I double the recipe to put it in a bundt pan and i made a lemon glaze and a  drizzle.  Every one wants me to make them this cake.  Also instead of the lemon extract i use about 5 tablespoons of lemon juice.

this is the best pound cake recipe I have found so far. following suggestions from others, I baked it for 50 mins. and it turned out just right. I prefer less lemon taste so I only added vanilla extract.  Great with fresh Northwest berries and whipped cream!

I'm not reviewing this recipe for the lemoniness of it but for the actual cake recipe.  I wanted to make a ound cake and only hade enough eggbeaters left to equal a little over 1 egg so this recipe was what I needed.  I did 1 1/2 times recipe for 1 9 by 5 loaf also.  I skipped the whole lemon idea and used butter, vanilla, and almond extracts instead.  Baked 70-75 mins and it was very spongey and delicious.  Will keep in my recipebook!

I really didn't care for this recipe. It lacked flavor and was on the dry side. I cooked this for 50 minutes as others had to do. I've made pound cake numerous times and this didn't measure up. I don't think I'll be playing with this recipe since I have a light version of pound cake that turns out well, but requires light sour cream. Sorry Kimberley, I wish I could be more positive.

I agree, the cake took about 50 mintues to cook.  But it was worth every minute.  I am usually not a pound cake lover.  But I figured I would give it a try.  Boy was I surprised.  This cake was great.  Easy to make and delicious.  My husband ate nearly the entire cake.  I would definitely make again.  However, I added a lemon glaze to the top for that extra lemony flavor.

Not a bad recipe. I creamed the butter and sugar first, then added the egg and stirred it good, then the other moist ingredients, then added the dry to that.
 Also, I used 1/2 tbs of vanilla extract and the juice of one lemon (about 1/4 cup), no lemon extract because I didn't have any. It could've used a little more lemon juice probably, but it turned out good. 
I baked it for 50 min. and I coated the pan with sugar before pouring the batter in, and sprinkled sugar on top before baking- gave it a nice crust.

Added lemon zest and did the glaze as suggested by another poster. Still didn't have enough lemon flavour for my taste but it was good none-the-less.

I baked this in mini (like 4x6ish) loaf pans and it came out great nice and fluffy. It tastes more like an angel food cake than a pound cake, but that's cool, i like angel food cake a lot too :)

I was disappointed that there wasn't more lemon flavor to this cake.  Next time I make it I might try using fresh lemon juice or making a lemon glaze to pour over it.  Outside of that, it was good just not excellent.  I had to bake mine for 55 minutes before it was done which is normal for a pound cake.  The writer must have intended this recipe for a convection oven with the 30-minute directions.

This was so thick it crawled up my beaters. It said to POUR the batter,I had to add 3/4 cup more milk to it and was not done in 30 mins either.

Okay - I may be over-doing the stars just a tad...I think it's 4 1/2 stars really - but ONLY because this cake is a little too crumbly to be truly called pound cake.  But other than that, the recipe is extremely easy (I am a terrible cook/baker) and tastes delicious!  The only thing I did differently was use Orange Extract instead of lemon because that's what we had.  It was unbelievably yummy!  I had to whip something together last minute to meet the requirements of a surprise chocolate fondue party.  This cake won everyone over (except for the slight crumbly-ness...)

Not exactly a pound cake when done.  More of a crumb cake.  Far too dry for a good pound cake & the timing on the recipe was about half as much as it should've been.  Won't be archiving this one.

Well I followed the direction, exactly for a change. Cooked for 1 hour like most people suggested, I have a convection oven, used a toothpick and well I got a sloppy mess! even the parts that were cooked had a less than desirable texture. I'm going to try a different recipe, for the same thing and see if I get a real pound cake. I will add a photo as well,

I think cakes with more eggs actually taste better. But I also found a way to make this one more moist and taste more of lemon. Every 10 min I'd take the cake out, pour lemon juice on top and cover with thin layer of confectioners sugar. The top got a bit of coating and everything else got very moist.
I also tried same cake with orange juice and it got even better.

This cake was okay when it first came out of the oven but it wasn't very flavorful and it became dry soon after.  Maybe I did something wrong but I thought I followed the directions exactly.  I've made much better cakes and I made a lemon cake the following week that was to die for so I'll stick to that.

The recipie needs a lot of work to be able to produce a good pound cake.  I reduced salt to 1/2 tsp.  Also, cream the butter with the sugar first, then milk/eggs, then drys.  I used 2 tsp lemon extract and could barely taste it - use more! I baked for 55 minutes (toothpick finally clean) and the cake turned out dry and crumbly.  Definitely use a lemon glaze.  I am going to try this recipie again and will revise my review later.

Yummy fabulous cake! Took longer, I agree - about 50 minutes or so, but was scrump-dilly-umptious! I served this at a tea party, dusted with powdered sugar, sliced thin, and surrounded by delicate lemon slices and eye-catching ripe strawberries. Had to send the 2 leftover slices home with a girlfriend! My (picky) husband was disappointed...and you know that is always a good sign!

It took 60 minutes to bake, but came out very nice.  It wasn't too crumbly for my taste, though. I didn't have lemon extract so I used the grated rind of one lemon and that worked out fine.

I'm 85 & tried making a cake and this was it.  First time it through me off becase of cook time (30). It looked raw so left in and 30 min later was ok.  Recipe should state "30 for round pan and 50-55 for loaf pan" fpr us new guys.  It will cause no confusion.  Seen others having that  same problem.  Second one I made 2 in seperate bowls  just using REAL lemons and it really turned out GREAT.  I added few raisins (love them). Don't know how to add photo. South Philly Joe

I must agree with other negative reviews.  The cake took well over an hour to bake.  Cutting the butter into the dry ingrediants was an odd step for this type of recipe.  The flavour was lacking, and the cake had a hard crust, and a dry interior.  I was attracted to the reciepe, because I didn't have a lot of eggs.  Sorry I will not be making this one again.

good texture, not too heavy but not light either. since i like a lemony cake, i reduced the milk to 3/4 cup and replaced with 1/4 cup lemon juice. i also put in the rind of 2 lemons. the cake was then lemony when it came out of the oven. but since i wanted it even more tart, i poured over some lemon juice+icing sugar mixture on top (juice of 2 lemons, then 4 to 5 tsp of icing sugar). i used trim milk to lessen the fat. next time i will also reduce the butter and see how that will go.

This cake came out very dense and dry and while baking didn't brown at all. If I were to make this cake again, I'd cream the butter and sugar first, add the egg and then the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, instead of the way it was suggested in the recipe. Also, all I could really taste was the butter. It's too bad that lemon cakes need lots of eggs, because this one-egg recipe definitely needs improvement.

EASY for a first time baker.  Need to made it more lemony somehow.  I doubled the amount of Lemon extact but it could still use more.  Lemon Icing will help but I'd prefer to have the cake taste more lemony.  Maybe some lemon zest next time?

I doubled the recipe, beat sugar and butter for about 5 minutes in the mixer. 
mixed only one tsp salt and 2 tsp. of vanilla and 1 tsp. almond flavoring. added it to 2 eggs and 2 cups of milk(approx.) zest of lemon and its juice. put it into a bundt pan and cooked for 1 hour and 15 minutes. mixed another lemon juice with icing sugar, made a runny glaze and poured it over it when it came out of oven, served it with fresh strawberries and fresh mint with ice cream! DELIOUS!! the best!!!

I'm giving it full stars because I didn't follow the directions, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and say any flaws were my fault. I creamed the butter and sugar together, as I've never seen butter CUT IN to a cake? Then added egg and extracts (plus zest and a bit of juice), then alternated milk and flour/baking powder/salt. I was a little leery when I finished the batter because it looked a little thick for cake-- almost very sticky wet cookie dough, not at all pourable. But I spooned it into the pan, and it was fine.  It turned out okay, but even with zest wasn't at all lemony. And I wouldn't call it pound-cakey either-- it wasn't dense, it was a bit crumbly, and didn't have a very rich taste. It was a nice, faintly lemony regular cake that happened to be in a loaf pan. :P Cupcakes (with more lemon punch) might be the best use of this recipe?

This is a simple and fantastic recipe! I agree with some of the other reviews; you should add more flavoring than called for in the recipe.  I also add a lemon glaze on top that really sets it off!  Consistency is the key with this cake, and it is one of the most consistent I've made.

Good loaf. This "cake' was not dense enough to be considered a "Pound Cake" but was quite nice. I enjoyed it a lot. (3 stars for improper designation)

This cake was easy to make but I have a problem with the salt taste after it finish baking. I think the one teaspoon is to much. I will make it again but the salt will be reduce or eliminated. Thanks for sharing.

Not spectacular but not terrible either. I substituted lemon juice(3tblp) for the lemon extract(1tsp), maybe that affected it more than I thought it would because it wasn't very lemony at all. It took about 65 minutes for it to be baked all the way through, and since it was a very pale loaf I brushed it with a little melted butter before the last 15mins of baking.  I also made an easy lemon glaze which I poured a bit on while it was still warm in the hopes it would sink into the cake a bit and the rest on when it was cooled.  Not a bad cake but not a great one either, however if I am ever looking to make a pound cake when I don't have many eggs I would likely make this again.  My fiance seems to have enjoyed it quite a lot, so maybe it's just me :P

I used one member's recommendation to use cake flour instead of all purpose. It was so moist! I cut the sugar in half so it wasn't too sweet. I baked it for about 35 minutes. It turned out just right for me!

I looked  this cake. It is easy to make and taste great. I did make a small adjustment however. The cake was a bit to dry so I added a bit more milk and it  came out very moist and lasted longer. I also used this as my go to batter for my pineapple upside cake and it tastes great.

Perfect, exactly the kind of pound cake I wanted to make. Using only one egg did not compromise the quality, taste, or texture of the final product.

My 6.5 year old twins would give it more stars if they could (100 was one amount they said!).  Easy to make!  We did not have lemon, so we omitted it.  We also used a bundt pan, so it cooked for 45 minutes.  We made Vanilla Glaze to top it.  YUMMY!  Will make again and again!

This was very good.  It was fluffier than the standard pound cake.  I made cupcakes with the dough and cooked them for about 25 minutes.  I didn't have lemon extract so I used lemon juice to-taste.  I also made a syrup using lemon juice, lime juice and sugar, heated until the sugar dissolved.  I dipped my cupcakes in this and it gave them an excellent flavor.  It was a little messy, but very tasty.

Great pound cake. I cooked it for almost an hour not the 1/2 suggested. I baked it in a loaf pan. the comments about it not being lemony enough are correct. I will definitely up my lemon flavouring next time I make it. However this recipe is a definite keeper. Loved it for texture and quality.

Just made this and it came out wonderfully! I added the zest of one lemon, and 1/2 tsp more of the lemon extract, but the lemon flavour is still quite subtle. I'd add more next time. Also, would be great with some dried cranberries, or poppyseeds added to the batter. Mine turned out more cake-like than a dense pound cake. Great easy recipe!

Very good, despite my best efforts to mess it up! The loaf baked so slow--had to keep putting it back in for 10 mins at a time. Finally ended up at 75 minutes, then it wasn't jiggly in the middly anymore. It's moist and tender. I added the zest of 1 lemon, and used cake flour. And one of those cheap foil pans because I didn't have an 8x4". It came dangerously close to overflowing, I think a 9x5" would have worked. I would definitely recommend this recipe. Thanks!

This was fairly dry for us. We did the two different glazes that the first comment suggested and it added quite a bit of flavor. We are going to try another recipe out....

This was an amazing cake!!! I will make this many many times to come. I changed minimal ingredients... I used half and half instead of milk, "I can't believe it's not butter" instead of real butter  and added the zest of one lemon and the juice of half a lemon. It turned out so moist and lemony that it was gone before it ever cooled.

I followed the recipe exactly except I put 2 teaspoons of lemon extract in the mixture and I still really couldn't taste the lemon flavor. Also, the directions say to bake for 30 minutes but it ended up taking more like an hour before the middle was completely cooked so make sure to do the toothpick test!

Like the others, i used lemon juice and tasted better, also the cake cooked around an hour to have a crusty top. This recipe is very simple, i've repeated it several times and my kids loved it everytime....thanks for this fantastic easy recipe!

The best pound cake I've ever made or even eaten! I nixed the milk and lemon extract, and substituted fresh-squeezed lemon juice (same amount as milk), and zested the lemons used. I've made it twice already, and gotten raves each time- once from my uber-picky brother-in-law, and again from my impossible-to-please mother-in-law. 
Lemony, light and delicious!

This turned out pretty good! It was really simple to make...I did make one change. I added a vanilla pudding cup to it since I didnt have any vanilla extract and it made it really moist. I served it with fresh strawberries and whipped cream, my family loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked the texture of this cake.  However It was not lemony at all.  I made a glaze for it using the juice from 1 lemon, and 1 cup of icing sugar, I brushed it all over and it melted into the cake.  This made it very delicious.  I also used the left-over glaze and drizzled it on a slice before serving. Everyone enjoyed it this way.  When I make it again I will also add some lemon zest to the batter.

This did not turn out well for me at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought the batter was too thick but left it as it was.  The cake was not done in 30 minutes so I kept adding 10 minute increments.  When the toothpick came out clean, the pound cake was very dense and hard.  I thought it needed more eggs in the batter.

I did have a similar problem with the baking.  It took much longer than the 30 minutes and at the same time(like the other posting) if you bake it longer the cake crumbles.  I will make this again.  I like the flavor of the cake and the ease of the recipe.

I've made this several times now & my 3 guys seem to like it, as do I. It's a moist cake, & it has a nice lemon flavor. It's kind of a light cake, not overly sweet & not overbearing with its flavors... subtle, I guess. Something that pairs well with a glass of ice- tea.

Love this recipe.  It is easy and always bakes up beautifully.  The only adjustment I have made is for high altitude.  Increase the baking temperature by 25 degrees and 50 minutes baking time.  I have made this more than once and it can be tweaked but really doesn't need it.

Very good recipe. I used some tips from others to tweek it a little. I creamed the butter, sugar, and egg together rather than cutting the butter in. That was added to the dry ingredients and then I added the milk and extracts. I used 1 1// tsp of lemon extract. I used a 9x5 pan and cooked for at least 60 mins and I have a convection oven. For a topping, I made a glaze with 1/2 cup powdered sugar with 1 Tbsp lemon juice which I put on while it was hot and then added once again while it was cool. The texture of the cake is delightful! My family very much enjoyed it.

Quick, easy and very, very tasty!
Decided to try it on a hot July afternoon in Texas!  Why?  It sounded so good and it was.  Made it nearly exactly as written with a few changes.  Here they are:
1. Sifted the flour.
2. Used the zest and juice of one large lemon which made it so much fresher than using an extract.
3.  Did not have that size loaf pan.  My cake pan sub chart suggested an 8" round which I didn't have either, so used a 9.5" round.   Worked just fine.
4.  Baked in a convection oven at 325 for 38 mins.  Began checking at 30.  Top was not golden but bottom was.
5.  Cooled in pan 10 mins., then turned out on a rack.
Lovely golden color, very moist and tasty and spouse enjoyed it also, especially with ice cream on top!
If you like lemon this is for you.  Enjoy.
Thought about adding fresh blueberries too as I love the lemon/blueberry combo.  Next time.
Thanks to Kimberley and her grandmother for this wonderful recipe!

I give this recipe 4 stars because I did have some changes, biggest one being I did all vanilla because I didn't have any lemon. I know that's a big change! But as far as the bake itself, it definitely takes longer than 30 minutes at 350. Mine took 45 minutes at 350. The outside becomes crunchy and golden browned while the inside remains tender, fluffy, and utterly delicious. It's not the sweetest cake, but I really like that about it. Perfect treat with tea! 
Also, as there were no instructions as to cooking inside or outside the pan, I immediately took it out of the pan to cool to stop browning. I think you could possibly get by with a 40 minute bake if you left it in the pan to cool.
And, don't bother trying to cut that much butter into the batter - use your fingers to break it up into the dry ingredients.

The recipe ingredients were very simple...not a whole lot of eggs, unlike traditional lemon pound cakes.The oven temperature was way off by 30 minutes??.So my lunch got interrupted, because I had to watch this wet mess carefully after 30 minutes.Me knowing my temps, I chanced another 30 minutes, which topped out to an even 60 minutes.Well, see my pics, beautiful.I don't like a pound cake that look burned or over cooked.This would've been a 5 star had the temperature been correct.Keep practicing??

I followed this recipe loosely (sorry) but loved the results: I replaced the 1/2 cup butter with 2 tbs butter and 6 tbs vegetable oil. I also used light brown sugar instead of white sugar, left out vanilla and lemon extract but zested and squeezed in juice from half a lemon. The lemon flavor was noticeable but mild, I might use more juice next time.

This recipe is actually quite good. Its easy to make and tastes delicious! I didn't add the lemon extract as I had run out but the vanilla was just fine  and everyone I served it to loved it. It goes really well with a dollop of warm custard on top.
It does need to bake for about an hour, not 30 minutes.

This was my first attempt at baking a pound cake and it was absolutely delicious and surprisingly easy.  I sifted the flour only because I think pound cakes can sometimes be too dense.  Unfortunately, I did not have lemon abstract, so I used the zest from 3 lemons.  The lemon flavor was very subtle so I made a lemon syrup with the juice from the 3 lemons (about 1/2 cup) and 1/3 cup of powdered sugar.  I used a full cup of milk and did not beat the milk/egg mixture in little by little as the recipes instructs because I read the instructions after it was added (oops)  but it still turned out very moist and delicious.  The bake time was WAY off.  It took a little over an hour for the cake to set.  Fantastic!

I made this cake last night and it turned out very moist. I added lemon juice to the mixture and created a glaze with powder sugar, lemon juice and water. I can't give it 5 stars because I needed to cook it for 45 minutes on 350 instead of 30, but overall it is a keeper. The lemon flavor isn't "in your face" which is how I like it. If you want a stronger lemon flavor try adding more lemon zest or even a packet of lemon pudding mix.

I tried this recipe without changing ingredients and quantities. I didn't have lemon extract and I don't like it so it is the only ingredient I didn't add. The cake turned out great. I was better than what I expected. It was soft inside and very tasty. I put 4 stars because the cooking lasted a little bit more than 30 minutes. More 35 to 40 minutes. It became one of my favorite recipe for cakes. Plus I like the idea of not having to prepare the batter in two different bowls.  Very easy to prepare and it tastes good.

I followed this recipe exactly as shown. However, I used a round pan, not a pound cake pan. Cooked in exactly 30 minutes, regular oven, rose beautifully and tasted excellent. Also was very moist. Added vanilla frosting and sprinkles :) yum!

I agree with many others that the preparation for this cake batter is a little odd. But, I followed the directions carefully and am delighted with the result. I used a pastry blender to cut the butter into the flour and sugar mixture until the texture was like coarse crumbs. I did not have any lemon extract. I added the zest from one lemon to the dry ingredients. And I used another reviewer's suggestion of adding two Tablespoons of Limoncello to the wet ingredients. I baked my  poundcake in a decorative, small bundt pan. It produced an adorable, tender cake that looked like it came straight from the bakery. I will keep this recipe handy for whenever I need a quick cake and don't have time to soften the butter.  I love the recipe and thank Kimberely for sharing it. It was so easy to prepare. My baking time was about 50 minutes.

I have made this recipe several times.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because I followed other suggestions and used lemon juice and zest and cake flour.  DELICIOUS!!! Oh, it does take about 45 minutes to bake.

I tried this recipe following it exactly.  It was not done in 30 minutes, and the crust was rather tough.  The cake was not sweet enough.  It was easy to make and would be good in a pinch, but if I make it again I'll be sure to either bake it on 375 or for 50 minutes or more before trying to take it from the oven.  It was very moist on the inside. I do not know if humidity affected the making of this cake, but it was a very damp, humid day when I baked it.

Thank you to all the reviewers who added their comments Because They Were Helping. I tried the recipe as is but after tasting the batter I knew it needed more so I added another3/4 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup of lemon juice( I really love lemony cakes). With the changes the cake turned out wonderful. This is a good base cake but you definitely have to  spruce it up. I gave it four stars because of the changes I had to make.  I will definitely make this again.

I just made this recipe. The milk made it soupier so I had to add more flour and rearrange the recipe. I baked y cake in 40 mins and still haven't had a chance to taste it yet. As soon as I get a chance to taste the pound cake I will give another review.

I really loved this cake and so did the little ones.  Recipe is fairly easy and quick.  The baking time took me about 60 minutes, not 30, but after the baking, the cake was really delicious, crusty on the top and nice, soft, and moist in the middle.  Will definitely be making this again.  Instead of using lemon extract (I didn't have any on hand, I used actual lemon juice and lemon peel.  It still turned out great.)

Very good lemon pound cake.  I did add two tablespoons of lemon juice and the zest of one lemon, since I love lemon.  Thank you Kimberley for such a delicious and easy recipe.

I have to give this 3 stars because I didn't make it exactly as written and so I can only vouch for part of the method. I added an egg as I doubted only one egg would make a great cake (sorry). I added a full cup of milk as well as teaspoon of nutmeg and cinnamon. I rubbed in the butter as stated and beat the eggs before milk to it then added the vanilla. I then added this to the butter/flour mixture and beat (not mixed) until well blended and most lumps were gone. The cake was fantastic. A bit sweet but moist and dense and delicious. Very pound cake like. So while I changed some things, I can say that the method works.

I made this and it came out wonderfully. Like others say below the cooking time does need adjusted - just bake it until a toothpick comes out cleanly in the middle (it should only be about an extra fifteen minutes; check every five because ymmv). I will be making this again!

I used this recipe to make gluten free vegan  orange cupcakes. Swap all purpose for your favorite GF blend flour and OJ instead of milk, shortening for butter, 1/3 cup applesauce for the egg and its an allergy friendly treat for everyone!

Great recipe =) Nice and moist, and good for cupcakes too. The only modification that I make is adding 3 tsp of lemon essence into the cake batter, rather than 1 tsp (as we prefer the flavor to be stronger).

This cake is delicious ! I used a gluten free all purpose flour. You can use 1 tsp vanilla extract and 2 tsp lemon extract to make up for the "pasty" flavor some gluten free flours have. I always top my poundcakes off with a powdered sugar glaze....this cake is a winner !

I started making this before I realized I was out of lemon extract.  I used 1/8 tsp or so of sweet orange oil instead and it was fantastic.  (I just added a little bit at a time and then tasted the batter until it was orangey enough) It took about an hour to bake, but it came out perfectly.  I added a lemon glaze made from pwd sugar and lemon juice, and served this at a cookout.  Everyone loved it, both kids and adults.

this was heavy and ended up tasting more like a corn muffin. would probably be good as muffins with fresh fruit. i won't try making a less ingredient pound cake again.

This recipe actually took 55 minutes to cook, not 30.  I added a lemon glaze frosting over it, which gave it some flavor.  Without it, I wouldn't have even been able to taste any hint of lemon in this lemon pound cake.

The cake was delicious.  I had no lemon extract so I added about 1 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp lemon zest.  Had to add more milk as the batter was too thick.

I agree with the other reviews, this cake definately needs some more lemon. I would recommend adding some lemon zest and definately a glaze. I used 1 cup confectioners sugar and 1 3/4 tbsp lemon juice as recommended in another review but added a little lemon zest to give it even more zing.  I 1-1/2ed this recipie for my larger loaf pan and it took 70 minutes to bake. Turned out yummy!

The inside is moist, and the crust is crisp like shortbread. I used extra lemon extract in place of the vanilla, and I found the lemon flavor to be just right. Be sure to soften the butter well to help it incorporate nicely. Also, the cake took 55 minutes to bake in my oven, so don't count on it taking only 30. I was well worth the wait though.

i made this recipe to the t, well the only things i changed was i used 2 teaspoons of lemon extract instead of 1.  I also drizzled it with a lemon juice/sugar glaze as other reviewers suggested.    There was plenty of lemon flavor, but just like others said, this "pound" cake was way too crumbly.  Not what comes to mind when i think of pound cake.  More like sweet, lemony, cornbread.  Don't think i'll be making this one again, sorry.

Not what I expected.  The one egg is crazy. It tasted like sweet corn bread.  My granny said pound cake needs at least 6 eggs and a pound of each ingredient  to be called pound cake.

Very good pound cake, with a few changes. I add a couple tablespoons of lemon juice to the batter and after it's finished baking I top it with a lemon glaze while it is still warm. Very tasty!

My fiance is *really* picky and he said this was the best pound cake he's ever had.  I used CAKE flour though, may have made the difference?  Also, it took 45 minutes in my gas oven to finally bake but I have to say....... this was to die for!  Will be making it again, thank you for the wonderful recipe.

not enough lemon flavour. Made again using ideas from other reviews.  I added lemon rid and lemon juice to the batter and added a lemon glaze. Was much better. It did get dark quick but it may be my fault. I will make again with the extra lemon

Easy to make, decent flavor, but rather coarse and not quite sweet enough for me. I added the finely grated rind of a lemon, so it was nice and lemony. However, for my money, the Buttermilk Pound Cake II recipe is a far better cake.

This is excellent!  The only change I made, instead of using lemon extract, I zested a whole lemon into the batter.  I did not have eny extract.  It had a great tart flavour.

Excellent!!!  Haters can hate....they will never go away, but this recipe was great.  If you can't bake well, it will not work for you.  I see that there are a lot of creative individuals out there who make the most out of it, by using their own little twists...congrats to you, for being positive with it!!  To the others...don't hate on it, just know that it's not the recipe for YOU.   My kids enjoyed it.  I too, added a little twist with lemon, and a little less sugar, but it still turned out great, based on the original recipe. It does seem to be a different type of pound cake, but still great, in my opinion. Cheers to you, for a wonderful recipe.

It's a good recipe if you're out of eggs! I felt the need to upgrade it: I gave up the lemon essence (natural stuff is better by far!) & added 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice + rind.Instead of milk I used 1 cup orange juice + rind + 1 tbsp honey + 5 mashed dates + 1 finely grated carrot. I used wholemeal flour + 1 tsp baking powder + some crushed almonds. I made muffins instead of cake and they were yummy as well as healthy (my kids took them to school)

This was just okay to me and my family. Like others said it needs more lemon, and it bakes for an hour, my mom suggested putting a glaze on top. Also mine came out a little crumbly, but with a little TLC this could be a five star pound cake!

Great except for the salt.  Adding salt ruined the flavour.

I thought this had no taste what so ever! It didn't even have a lemon taste to it and I put more than what the recipe called for.I gave this three stars because my three year old son and husband liked it.

I have made this about 5 times now but I add about three tablespoons of poppyseeds.  My mother-in-law says they taste just like what she used to get back home in Austria.  Definately not as heaving as a pound cake, delicious!

This was ok...I too had to cook it much longer (1 hour & 15 minutes).  I added poppy seeds.  It rose nicely, but was a little too dry for me.
