I found this recipe while looking for meatless dinner ideas.  I wasn't sure how my kids and I would like it, but we like all the components, so I gave it a whirl.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth for the rice, because that's what I had on hand.  I also used chicken broth for the rice so we wouldn't feel like we wanted to add extra salt later on.  I did have to substitute peanut oil because I was out of sesame oil, so I made up for that by adding some toasted sesame seeds as a garnish.  Overall, we really enjoyed this dish, although I did let the eggs cook a little too long and the yolks got dry.  There was a lot of the rice and lentils left over, so I mixed them together took it to work for lunch the next day and added some yellow mustard to it.  It was SO good that way!  I'm sure I'll make this again soon.  Thanks for a healthy, inexpensive meal!

This is a pretty good meal! My family liked.  I'd play with it a bit for a little more flavor, but I also omitted red pepper flakes and used chicken boullion. I'd like to add sauteed onion and garlic to this next time. It's very good as is though! :)

I tried this recipe because I'm pregnant and I want to eat more lentils. My expectations were that it would be mediocre, but I ended up loving it! My husband, who thought he would hate it, ended up liking it. Its perfectly spicy, and a really great blend of flavors.  I did end up cooking the lentils a little longer to make sure they were soft.

I think this is great.  I was looking for a quick curry recipe where I didn't have to make the curry from scratch.  It tastes great with chickpeas too.

I make this quite frequently - once every week or two.  I leave out the vegetable bullion and don't feel that the dish suffers at all because of this omission.  It's a quick, easy, supper solution that tastes really good.

Delicious, nutritious, easy, and cheap- can't get better than that. The only change I made was I used vegetable broth for the water and left out the bouillon. Thanks for sharing!

I could see how some people may really like this... but our family just didn't like something about it.  Its texture wasnt desireable to me and I didn't care for the dominant taste of the lentils either.

Some major plusses for this dish include relative ease to prepare, health benefits and low cost.  However, I just found it too bland.  My husband said it was like eating gruel.  That was a bit much, but it needs something more.  I'll make a variation again but definitely with onion and garlic and possibly some tomato sauce.

I love eggs with rice, and I love lentils!  I was looking for a curried lentil recipe and this one looks great.  I see tomorrow's breakfast right here on this page!  Added cheese will be a must for my family, too.

I love lentils, I love brown rice. I adore using curry powders in my cooking. This dish was really bland. I recommend at least triple the amount of curry powder and some tomato sauce/paste and a touch of sugar if you want a delicious curry flavored dish. A little lemon would do wonders as well. Some people like bland, if you're into that though, why even bother with a recipe?

Yum!  So delicious and different from the same ol', same ol'.  The egg really makes it wonderful and rich.  Even my teenage boys who are not known for their sense of culinary adventure at this and loved it!

I'm an Appalachian fellow raised on Pinto Beans and Cornbread (and a side of onion). I married a Gulf Coast lady who introduced me to Red Beans and Rice. This Lentils and Brown Rice recipe is going to make for a great take-off as I meld the various recipes.

Hum, can't say I understand where the other reviews quite got so excited.  My husband and I were both unimpressed.  It was bland.  Edible and we would do it again if somehow we only had lentils and eggs in the cupboard, but I won't be hanging on to this recipe.

You are brilliant.  High flavor and nutrition for low cost and effort.  We all really liked it--kids got less seasoning than parents but could probably meet in the middle next time we make it.

Surprisingly good! I did make a few changes.  Sauteed 1/2 cup onion in the oil before adding lentils, added fresh tomatoes (canned would be good too) about 10 min into cooking so they stewed a bit.  Will add carrot medallions next time.  Also drizzled a little agave nectar over it at the end - needed a little sweet to go with the spicy.  Good recipe.  Will make this again!

This is a good recipe. I make it all the time. I  use brown lentils, olive oil, vegetable broth instead of water/bouillon, omit the red pepper flakes and adjust the recipe for 1 serving.

simple and delicious.  The egg was a great surprise for our family.  My parents are used to eating lentils with more liquid but enjoyed this drier version just fine.  Thanks!

I am surprised this recipe rated so well. I did omit the bouillon cube and added about 1/4 cup chopped onion and salt to the curry and oil and sauteed' a few minutes before adding the water. The finished result was quite dry and bland. I do like beans and rice and the egg was a nice addition to this type of meal. I might try it again with more spices, maybe some more chopped vegetables and a bean other than the lentils. It is a healthy and hearty meal which is why the 3 star instead of 1 or 2.

This was surprisingly good! I added a little extra curry because I knew I'd want more curry, my husband liked this with yoghurt on top :)  oh I also added some extra water because I wanted my lentils nice and soft for my 13month old daughter, both her and my 3.5 year old enjoyed this as well!

The recipe is filling, but could use some work. It could use some flavor from other Indian spices and defenitely less heat. Too much red pepper for us.

Very basic but satisfying.  I really liked the addition of the egg with runny yolk - it worked really well.  Yes, the dish could be boring to some, but you can add additional spices and herbs if desired.  We always have the ingredients on hand, so dinner is always possible at our house.

This was awesome!  Cooked it almost exactly to the recipe.  I used a cup of veggie broth in lieu of water because I had it and I used chicken bullion because I didn't have veggie.  My three year old loved this.  Very easy, quick and economical! (I'm from South Louisiana, I also added Tony's.  We add Tony's to everything)
