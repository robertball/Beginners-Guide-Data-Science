These are so addicting! A great way to sub in sun-dried tomatoes if you don't have any on hand. These do take a while, but are well worth it. The house smelled so good while these were roasting.  The only issue I have was the cook time/temp. Thankfully I didn't let them go the full 3 hours. At 2.5 hours, about 1/4 of the tomatoes and garlic were already dried to a crisp. I still ate the crispy tomatoes (not the garlic), but having them shriveled, yet still slightly juicy inside is what I was looking for. I would definitely start checking them at 2 hours, and maybe lower the temp to 200F. These would be excellent in pasta, or served over grilled fish. They have such a nice concentrated tomato flavor. The possibilities are endless!
