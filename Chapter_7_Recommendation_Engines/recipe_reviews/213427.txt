Well, I should start by saying that I didn't use Irish whiskey, as I couldn't find any, so I used Scotch. But even so, the stew needed at least 1/3 a can of tomato paste for flavor, as there wasn't a ton there, and even though I tossed the lamb chunks in flour and browned them beforehand, it really wasn't very thick. I think with modifications, this could be a really nice recipe - the whiskey is a good background flavor.

A standard slow-cooker lamb stew with the addition of a shot of booze. Hardly original, but the booze does not spoil it - nor does it add that much to it. An edible dish, but not worth MY time to change from my tried and trusted recipe I have been using for years. I emphasise that this reaction is based upon MY taste characteristics. Others may find this good, particularly those who have not had a lamb stew before.

We had it for a St. Patty's Day party and it was awesome although I did change it up a bit.  I added 1/2 cup of dry white wine and upped the Irish Whiskey (Jameson).  I also used yellow boiler onions instead of cut yellow onion.  Everyone loved it and the woody flavor from the whiskey was an interesting touch.  We served it with Irish Soda Bread and it was great!

I added 3 parsnips, chopped and a rounded tsp of rosemary and upped the thyme to a full tsp.  The flavor of the whiskey, while not overly strong seemed to mask the flavor of the parsnips and herbs.  IMO, adding Guinness would be better.

This was a solid recipe.  Everything in it was fine, but the overriding opinion was that there was something missing.  Others have suggested that tomato paste or white wine would work, but neither of those resonate as the missing ingredient.  It was very, very good, just a touch bland for our tastes.  Maybe dill, maybe rosemary... It is definitely not the last time I'll make the recipe, but I want to figure out what that last ingredient might be first!

I am not the seasoned veteran cook that some of the reviewers must be.  I wouldn't know a basic lamb stew from a gourmet one.  But I do know that my wife and I love this recipe.  The last time I made it I used a lamb shank and put it in whole.  I cooked on high for four hours and then took out the shank and took the meat off and diced it.  It put the bone back in the pot along with the meat.  The flavor is in the bone.  I use scotch because that is what I have and it is similar to Irish whiskey.  We love this recipe and I will make it many more times.

I made this dish with a crock pot for the first time. I did add turkey breast, string, tomatoes and yams. My Caribbean spices. My family loved it!

This is a good base to start a stew, however, it is a bland dish, based on my taste profile. It is hardy and makes more than it looks. I did add more than a "pinch" of the seasoning to add more flavor to it, but sadly it didn't work out. Looking at some of the other reviews looks like they may add more flavor out in this and will be worth a shot next time.

It was a good stew. I used left over leg of lamb and cooked on stovetop rather than slow cooker. I only used 2 potatoes instead if the 5 the recipe called for. Good flavor. Will make again.

It was wonderful! I used a few dashes of Worcestershire, a little red wine, and Lairds Applejack Whiskey because I had no other whiskey. I put a little more in then I was supposed to, but it came out wonderful with a little hint of sweetness from The Applejack. I also used part potatoes and part turnips. Yay!!!
