Ken, You are Amazing!! This pesto Rocks!! I made it just like it was written. Be careful with the salt, I used kosher salt and along with the cheese, I thought it was a little too salty,my fault. I Still loved it. We don't like our food screaming hot so I made it with 2 tbs of chopped canned jalapeno peppers. I made grilled carne asada  to go with this and wrapped the meat along with the pesto in corn tortillas. Fabulous!! Thanks again Ken!

The salt may or may not be needed depending on the Cotija you use.  Some can be overly salty.  A good sub would be Romano cheese if you don't have Cotija

I've made this twice and the only change was to not use the full amount of oil so I wouldn't feel bad eating it all in one sitting. First time I topped blackened chicken breast,pasta and halved cherry tomatoes with this for a very easy and yummy meal. The second time my father ate most of the batch himself on tortilla chips after saying he didn't like cilantro. Very good!

Fantastic, just as I expected! I had to use Parmesan because I couldn't find cotija, but it was still AMAZING! Served over seared Tuna Steaks. Can't wait to use it again.

This stuff is awesome! I followed the recipe exactly, and served it with fetticuini noodles and chicken milensa.  The flavors went so well together, the spicy balanced out by the garlic and cilantro!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Easy and Delicious. I used a jalepeno instead of a serrano because I am a wimp and subbed some of the olive oil with chicken stock to cut calories. I served this over grilled chicken breast and it was wonderul. I can't wait to have leftovers later this week

Great recipe, the only thing I did different is toast the pumpkin seeds before blending. Just toast until they pop. It brings out a more authentic Mexican flavor.

Outstanding!  I used parm (couldn't find cotija) and a random pepper from our garden.  I just kept adding pepper until it was right.  I'm bummed that I didn't think of making this before!  So many wasted half eaten bunches of cilantro. :(

This is excellent - I didn't have pumpkin seeds on hand or Cotija Cheese. I substituted the cheese with Parmesan.

Amazing!  I admit I was wary, even with all the 5 stars, but I made this one weekend while the kids were at their dad's, and ADORED it!  I had some left when they returned and 2 of my 3 boys were giving it praises.  Thanks Ken for a great recipe!

So good! I was looking for a simple recipe to use up some Cotija cheese we had left over from another dish. I made a few changes to avoid going to the store. I didn't have any pumpkin seeds on hand, but I did have unsalted roasted sunflower kernels so I used those instead. I didnt' add any salt at all, since the cheese is pretty salty. Also, I didn't have a serrano...just used red pepper flakes. It was a pantry dinner kind of day.
Can't decide what I am going to put this on for dinner yet...you could pair it with so much!

We really enjoyed this as a topping for Barramundi.  I just dredged the fillets in flour and seasoned salt, then pan fried them until they were golden and flaky.  Added this fabulous pesto to make a delicious dish!  I made this ahead and it was still good.  I think the flavor might have been stronger if I hadn't waited to use it, but it was still wonderful and a nice change from basil based pesto.  Thanks for sharing!

I used this recipe as more of a guide on what to put in. I did it to taste - more of some ingredients less of others. I will say that I used far less oil than was called for. It turned out great! Also - try adding a couple spoonfuls to a mashed avacado - YUM :)

I love cotija and pepitas so i was loking for something to do with them besides on my salads. Found this and liked it, i did add some lime juice because mine was kind of thick. I also didnt add salt because of the cheese and my pepitas were salted. Now to figure out what im going to put it on

This is amazing.  I substituted in pistachios and Parmesan (what I had on hand), and it was incredible.  Used it couple nights on chicken breasts and again on pasta, and froze the rest in ice cube trays to be able to use whenever!  Great way to use up cilantro!  Definitely a new favorite :)

I've been making this for 20 years! Always a hit, especially with people who don't like basil pesto! Queso Fresco works too if you don't have Cotija.

try using scapes 1 pound with 1 1/2  cups cojita cheese a Serrano pepper, cilantro to taste and a little cholula and blend with olive oil.  No salt needed. When done, freeze in ice cube trays, pop them out and store in zip top bag in freezer for easy portioned servings. Oh and you can add some Greek yogurt or some sour cream or creme fresca to make a great spread. Yum!

Delicious! I subbed jalapeño pepper because it's what I had. I subbed nutritional yeast for the cheese because half our family is allergic to milk products. I will definitely make it again!

This was by far my favorite recipe I’ve found on this site. I used 2 jalapeño’s because that’s what I had, I cut the cheese because I’m avoiding dairy. I’ve made this multiple times now and I eat it several times a week. Thank- you so much for such a healthy, inexpensive, easy recipe!

Very good. Used grand padano for the cheese. Used jalapenos instead of serrano and left all seeds in - it still wasn't spicy enough for me so I would try a hotter pepper next time. Doubled the recipe but reduced total salt to 1/4-tsp; reduced the oil a little bit, but added the juice of a lime. I had fresh garlic with large cloves (4 cloves = entire head) - I used 6 in total (1.5 heads). We love garlic, and this was very garlicky. Delish! Will be serving with carne asada tacos tonight.

I was scouring the web for what to do with my insane excess of garden cilantro and made this tonight. SO.GOOD. and oh so easy. Our whole family is obsessed. Just threw it all in my ninja food processor and there you have it. As some of the other reviews suggest I substituted the cheese for Romano cheese, pepitas for pine pine nuts, and the pepper for canned jalepenos and because it's what I had on hand. We are a little bit whimpy on spice and two tablespoons of the jalapeños was perfect. I also only did 4 tablespoons of oil and just a splash of chicken broth to reduce calories- definitely maintained a nice smooth texture and not too watery. We put it on grilled chicken breasts for dinner and practically licked our plates clean. I'm sure we'll use it for pasta, fish, and a million other things.

We made the Mexican Pesto to have over tilapia fish and it could not have been better.  We even have enough extra for dipping some tortilla chips.  Very easy to make and has great flavor.  We used Jalapeno instead of Serrano because we like the flavor of them better.  Add a little more of whichever chile you use for that extra bite of spice.

I have made this recipe twice now and it is great. If you love cilantro this is your sauce. The first time i made this, there was too much garlic for my taste, I cut it then to two cloves.  For a spin on this recipe I added some avocado and used goat cheese. Turns out tasty. I did follow the recommendations and used 3 tbs of chicken stock and 3tbs of olive oil.  Great recipe!

Delicious!  I didn't have cotija cheese so had to sub with the wonderful feta cheese from costco(TNUVA).  I made the mistake of not adjusting the salt as the pepitas I bought were salted and the feta has lots of salt too.  Next time I'll just omit the salt.  I was a bit hesitant at first to make this but now I'm looking for food in my kitchen to dip it in.  I think I'll sneak it into tomorrows breakfast sandwich as it would be great with eggs but definitely chicken, steak or pasta.

This is the best pesto ever!!! And I've made my fair share. I eyeballed the oil, substituted jalapeño for the chili and added 1/2 a lime. I don't typically salt my food, so left it out. Thank you for sharing!!! I'm gonna put this on everything!

I roasted the pumpkin seeds, serrano pepper and garlic.  Will use this for a lot of things.  Used it like the tomato sauce of pizza, with a flour tortilla for the crust.  Added a few chopped vine ripened tomatoes, chicken and panela cheese.  Pretty tasty.

Super Fresh!  Mistakenly bought a habanero instead of serrano, so it has some kick, but is delicious!  Also omitted the cheese due to dairy allergy in the family.  Great pesto!

Ken, this is so very yummy!  I made this tonight and just wanted to leave my dinner at that!  I did use a jalapeno rather than a Serrano because of the heat.  So very yummy!

Okay I have made this pesto twice already.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and it was good but it was my first time tasting pesto so I could not measure it up against anything.  The second time I made it I used everything but to brighten the flavor up I used half the olive oil and the other half I used lemon juice.  I did not have anymore Serrano peppers so I used 3 dashes of red pepper flakes and it came out so fresh and so great.
