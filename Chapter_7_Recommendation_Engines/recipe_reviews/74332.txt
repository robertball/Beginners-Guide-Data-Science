The salt measurement is WAY TOO MUCH here.  The submitter must have made a typo.  There is NO way it should be 2 TABLESPOONS.  I'm not even sure it should be 2 TEASPOONS. I used 1/2 tsp. of salt.  I also did mine on top of the stove on low and let it simmer for four hours stirring occasionally.  This is a five star recipe with a few changes besides the obvious salt.  I used olive oil vs. canola - about half of that.  In addition to the 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes I added a 28 oz. can of tomato sauce and used a 6 oz. can of tomato paste vs. the tomato puree.  I also sauteed the onion in 3 cloves of garlic and left out the garlic powder from the sauce.  I cut back the black pepper to 1/4 tsp. and added 1/4 c. of red wine. This is a wonderful thick, rich sauce.  I served it with homemade meatballs and sausage.  It's even better the next day!

This sauce was SO salty.  I'm sure it is supposed to be 2 TEASPOONS of salt . . . I had to add tons of extra tomato sauce to try to neutralize it!  Other than that, the flavor was very good.  Also, it really doesn't need to cook 8 hours in the slow cooker, it was very thick and dark and starting to burn after 5 or 6.

This is simmering now. I used extra virgin olive oil instead of canola oil (I don't keep canola oil on hand) and I sauteed what my husband calls "a boatload" of garlic in with the onion instead of using garlic powder. I did not add all the salt or pepper called for, just a pinch of salt and a fair amount of fresh ground pepper. It smells great. Very simple to make. I'll update my review once we've tasted it with our meatballs. EDITED: Pretty good.

We found this marinara to be the best yet. I doubled the recipe (except for salt) and tossed in the slow cooker a large bag of frozen meatballs. This was a "yummer!"

Based on previous reviews, I changed salt to 2tsps instead of tablespoons. I LOVE this sauce! Ease of  prep/cooking and it filled my kitchen with a wonderful Italian aroma for the hours it was in the crock pot. I doubled the recipe and it freezed well. This tasted like an authentic Italian sauce without the fuss. It is now my go-to marinara recipe.

A great basic marinara recipe!  I adjusted the salt to 2 tsp., as many other cooks did (pretty sure "2 Tbsp" is a typing error).  Instead of garlic powder, I used frozen garlic cubes that I get from Trader Joe's (1 cube = 1 clove).  Used 4 cubes, as we love our garlic.  Accidentally left slow cooker on high for the first few hours, but after a good stirring & another hour & 1/2 on low, it was lovely & thick, with a rich tomato flavor.. so perhaps that was a happy accident, as we were able to eat a bit sooner.  I'd actually cook it that way next time, too.  An excellent topping for thick-gauge spaghetti, & wonderful partner for Meatball Nirvana meatballs (which are a *must-try*!).

Just made this and it is EXCELLENT!!! I agree that Emibanana must have made a typo with the salt measurement, so I used just 2 tsp.  I was looking for a low-sugar marinara sauce, but of course can't find it ready made.  So I made this without adding sugar, just a little Splenda (it probably really didn't even need that).  If my basic math skills haven't failed me, my calculations say that this has less than 2 grams of sugar per 1/4 cup serving.  Perfect for me.  Plus MUCH better than any jar sauce I've tried!!!

this was a very nice and simple sauce. I used a can of diced tomatoes and tomato sauce, as that was all I had, but the spice mix was just right. I finished it with a splash of balsamic vinegar - used this as the sauce for chicken parmesean. Thanks for the easy pantry alternative to storebought sauces

I took the advice about reducing the salt.  Used 1  TBSP and should have used 2 tsp.  I'll do that next time.  I ran out of garlic powder, so used some of that and some minced garlic (the kind in the jar).  Didn't have any basil, so used some "Italian Seasoning."  Used a can of tomato paste instead of tomato puree; it made a nice thick sauce.  I also reduced the sugar to 1 TBSP.  I added a "slurp" of red wine.  I cooked it on the stove for about an hour (because we were hungry) and it was good.  I would make this again.  I plan to freeze the remaining  sauce.  Thanks

this is a very nice sauce that will work for many pasta dishes. change the amount of salt to 2 tea spoons and you will be ok. as many others said it must be a misprint as the table spoons will kill this sauce. i would recomend the slow cooker way as this will really brino out all the flavors. you may also want to remove some of the oil that will come to the top at the end of the 8 hours although you can just mix it back in if you like. i prefer to remove it myself

This is an awesome recipe.  Just made it and it was delicious.  I read other reviews and lowered the salt to 1 tsp. and it was good.  It was really very (spicy) hot, but I might've used tablespoons instead of teaspoons for the pepper.  But I like spicy so all is good, but I use teaspoons next time.  This is a keeper!!

Great base recipe.  I needed to make a few adjustments though.  I doubled the recipe, but reduced the salt and pepper.  Also, I added a couple tablespoons of Balsamic vinegar and olive oil directly to the sauce mixture rather than use the oil to saute the onions.  The onions were also added chopped and raw to the sauce mixture with a teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  Great base recipe, thanks for posting it.

I've made this quite a few times and really wanted to like it! The base is excellent, however the huge amount of herbs used aren't to my liking. I have adjusted the ingredients based on my preference, but I prefer to rate a recipe on the way it was written without including any variations I may have made. As it is written, I give this recipe 3 stars for personal taste.

I reduced the salt as previous reviews recommended. I liked it, but found it a little too strong on the oregano flavour and will cut back on it next time.

I'm willing to give this another try someday, but what a disaster! Followed the recipe exactly, and all I ended up with was burnt sauce. I had the crockpot on the right setting and for the correct amount of time. But about an hour before the timer was to go off, I started smelling something burning. And sure enough, the outer edges of the sauce were black. And the bits I could salvage just tasted heavy in seasoning. No lightness, no real flavor or depth. Just an overpowering taste of the spices. Other people rate this sauce high so it must have been my mistake somewhere, but the result I got was awful. What a disappointment.

Like others, I disregarded the salt measurement. I actually did very little measuring of my ingredients when I made this, but it came out wonderful! Throw all the ingredients in my crock pot in the morning and when I got home, boil some pasta and have a wonderful dinner! I have actually HATED making spaghetti for a long time because all the jarred sauces I have used never tasted right to me. This one actually tasted better reheated a day or two later! I am keeping this recipe close at hand from now on! I'm very thrilled to find this incredible sauce!

My family LOVES this recipe. I use olive oil instead of canola, about 2TBS dried italian seasoning and minced garlic. The tomatoe puree I use a 6-8oz can. I generally make meatballs with this one and throw them in to cook with the sauce. I have a BUNCH of PICKY eaters here and NOT ONE COMPLAINT from any of them lol. This recipe freezes VERY WELL, great for my husband to take out of the freezer on nights I'm not able to cook and VIOLA instant dad success on dinner..

This is an amazing recipe! Extremely easy, and delicious. While some reviewers complained about the herbs, I have to say that they MAKE this. I doubled the recipe, but DID limit the salt due to reviewers pointing out the typo. [seems someone at Allrecipes would correct this?] Also, in the doubling, just used 3 T of the garlic powder, dried oregano and basil. I used 1 T of salt, 1 T of pepper, and limited sugar to 2 T due to dietary restrictions. Served this to my husband - who is picky - to rave reviews.... then again at a dinner party, utilizing frozen leftovers. NO MORE JARRED SAUCES! Yay!

This recipe is currently in the slow cooker, simmering away.  I doubled my batch but I still only used 1.5 tsp of salt and 3 Tbsp of sugar.  Threw in a few sprinkles of thyme and rosemary too.  I gave it a quick taste test before sealing the lid on the crock; tastes amazing already!  Thrilled to use it in tomorrow's lasagna!

We thought it was great! While we added it to pasta noodles, we also put a bowl of sauce on the table just for bread dipping. We added parmesan cheese to it and used a little less oil.

You need to add more sugar than the Receipe calls for. Other than that, the sauce is awesome.

AI will NOT buy jar sauce ever again!!!! I would smother  ANYTHING in this  sauce!!! I'd already increased the amount of crushed tomato and oregano, before reading about the salt, I stumped my toe on the sugar, added 2 T of basil & 1 ts fennel (to enrich the Italian flavor) so it all came out PERFECT! Thank you!!!!

I will definitely make this again. Just made a few changes: 5 cloves of fresh garlic and the onion in the food processor sauteed with a couple of tablespoons of olive oil (1\4 cup of oil is way too much), only used 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 1\2 teaspoons of salt and a 28 oz can of puree. I cooked it for about 3 1\2 hrs on low and it was perfect.
