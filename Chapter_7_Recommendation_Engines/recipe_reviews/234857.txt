WOW, these were delicious. I think I like them better then traditional potato. I did not have green onions, so used sweet instead. Cannot wait to cook up again. Super easy and fast. Great side dish. Thank you for a great recipe.

This is yummy.  I did alter a bit. And when I say a bit, I mean a lot.  I sauteed the carrot and onion after shredding both in my food processor.  I also added about a 1/4 of a head of cabbage cut up and sauteed with the carrot and onion.  Once the veggies were soft, I added the other ingredients from the recipe.  I also added some garlic powder and used coconut oil to fry the patties.  These were great!

These are absolutely delicious! My only change was...I didn't have green onions so chopped up regular ones. I would have liked to have more, but my son gobbled them all up before I noticed. I will be making them regularly. Thanks  for the recipe!

We are big carrot eaters, so this recipe and versions of it are in regular rotation at our our house.

I usually blend all the ingredients together, then use a very thin layer of olive oil. The result is more like a pancake and less like hash browns.

The recipe is good as it is, but adding a spice like cumin or ginger, or an ingredient like jalapeño take sit up another star.

Serve with applesauce and pork or top with a fried egg, it’s quite versatile.

Delicious! I have made it several times. I used yellow onions because I did not have green onions in the house. I also need several batches with corn starch so that My gluten free yes good Easter. There was no significant difference in taste or texture using the cornstarch.
