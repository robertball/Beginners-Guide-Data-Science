I had this years ago so I was happy to find this recipe again!  A good option here for taste and presentation, swirl some caramel around a pretty glass before adding the ingriedients.. (caramel apple) :)

The kids come running for this one!  I must admit I eat my fair share too! Don't make more than a day ahead, it doesn't keep long, can get runny.  I used to make this without the pudding, but that is the key to the "carmel apple" flavor of this.  I am glad I found this recipe and tried it with the pudding.

This was tasty! I used SF pudding mix and FF whipped topping, and you couldn't tell the difference. We actually didn't care for the Snickers bars in this, as the texture was too chewy, but that's our personal opinion. We really enjoyed the apples mixed into the pudding mixture and it tasted like caramel apples, so that was fun. All in all we enjoyed this, and I would make it again, but I would find a replacement for the Snickers. Thanks for sharing. :)

I make this with Vanilla pudding.  I also mix everything the night before except the apples.  This allows the carmel from the snickers bars to add extra flavor to the mixture.  Big hit every time I make it.

Been making snicker salad for years.  A MUCH easier version of this is just to use Snickers, apples & cool whip, with a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Forget the pudding & milk.

I follwed the recipe exactly except I only had 4 chocolate bars, next time i'll add 6 like the recipe calls for.I made it to send to my sisters B-day  party, the next day she  called me to let me know every single guest loved it! I loved how easy it is to put it together, I had it ready in less than 10 min....

Great recipe, we've made it for years and serve it as a dessert.  We use vanilla pudding instead, and with a drizzle of caramel ice cream topping the butterscotchy flavour isn't overpowering.  
As parents we probably won't serve this every day, but we can help our kids learn how to include sweets in a healthy diet - by exposing them to treats from time to time.  Thanks for posting!!

I made this today for a cook out at a neighbor's.    Even though this is called a "salad",  we all agreed that it tasted like a dessert.  But either way; it was a great hit.  Thank you for posting, lojoyner.

Honestly, this sounded really gross to me. My stepmother served it in the fall and swore everyone loved it. Well, I made it for my Christmas party, and she was right. Very, very good. Passed the recipe on to lots of guests.

I have been making this for years at every family  gathering , everyone loves it. I always double the recipe. to cut the apples faster I use an apple slicer then I put them in a dicer that I purchased at Walmart. It is white oblong, it comes with 2 trays.  It always takes between 15-20 minutes to make to entire recipe. I always make the night before so it will be really cold.  While my daughter is taking the wrappers off the minature snickers I cut them in half. We cut the apples last, as I am slicing them she puts them in the dicer, this is a lot of fun for the kids :)

I don't know what I think of the butterscotch pudding for this recipe - I use vanilla or white chocolate pudding and do a mix of green and red apples.

This sweet Apple salad has been a kid and family favorite for years.  I strongly advise using vanilla pudding mix and fold in a can of drained crushed pineapple.  The pineapple puts this over the top.  Great recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

I've made this a couple times, it's really good.  I'm not a big fan of butterscotch pudding and I rarely buy it, so I used vanilla, as a few others did.  I also only buy the six-serving size pudding mix, so I used that and added an extra half cup of milk.  For the whipped topping, it comes in 8 oz containers so I just put in the whole thing.  I also buy the fun size or miniature Snickers, freeze them, then hit them with a hammer while they are still in their wrappers.  Then I just dump them right into the pudding mixture--no need to cut them up and make a huge mess on the counter.  I put in the whole package (it says nine servings are in the bag).  I cut up 4 apples.  I feel guilty throwing the vitamins that are in those yummy apple peelings down the disposal, so I don't peel my apples, just wash them and then chop them up.  They taste great and my family loves them.  Plus, then you don't need to feel guilty about putting candy bars in your salad!

I use vanilla pudding and skip the milk. I also use 6 Snickers and 6 Granny Smith apples so it's a little thicker/not so runny. This is a family tradition and always loved by guests when I make it!!

This is a great salad. I was excited to try this version with a box of pudding mix in with the topping but I definitely prefer this made with only the snickers, apples and whipped topping (I like the frozen kind in tubs). With only whipped cream the flavors meld better and it's lighter. The ratio of apples to candy is perfect for me. Thanks so much for sharing!

This is my contribution to Easter dinner, except I'll use Milky Way candy bars because of peanut allergies. I ran a test run for myself this week, and MW works just fine.

Great recipe as is.  ButterScotch pudding is what makes this recipe great. To make breaking the candy bars easier, freeze candy bars ahead of time, when ready to put the bars in, put them on a solid surface and hit with a hammer. Breaks them into nice small pieces.

I make this often. Cheesecake pudding  is far superior but you don't need the milk. Just apples, snickers, cool whip and cheesecake jello.

Very tasty.  Definitely serve right away because the apples start losing their water and can make for an unappetizing dessert.

I didn't have the recipe that my sister usually makes and my daughter loves; however, she liked this version just as much if not more and my husband's family was raving about it. It was a good one to have her make as well (14 yrs old).

I only made with cool whip in years past, but the pudding is necessary for the creamy consistency. I would prefer a different flavor than butterscotch.

I doubled the recipe and did 1 butterscotch and 1 vanilla pudding. Brought it to my other half's Easter get together and it was a huge hit. They said it was the new favorite and this was now my signature dish to bring to holidays. They've just done apples, snickers and cool whip or just added the vanilla pudding in the past.

Used 1/2 the milk and made mix and refrigerated overnight. Added apples a couple hours before serving. Very very good

I made it with vanilla pudding. It was a hit at my grandson's birthday party. There wasn't a single bite left. This recipe will be a regular in our family.

I was so excited and interested to see a variation on this salad (Yes, it is called a salad. No, no one really thinks it is one since it has SNICKERS in it) using the butterscotch pudding. I did make it and it was delicious!  I think it requires some more apples to balance the flavors; but as written it is a solid four star recipe.

I changed the instant butterscotch pudding mix to instant vanilla pudding mix. I loved making this recipe and I will make it again. I will mention to my friends that they should try making it some time in the next two weeks (before Halloween).

Too bad this is fattening.  But I guess everything that taste so delicious is!  :D    This is easy recipe and great for any type of celebration or get-together.   Careful... it could be addicting ;)

Not much left! Threw this together pretty quick for an after dinner treat. It was a hit. Probably should have let it set longer in the fridge. Tasty!!

The kids loved this recipe! I used White Chocolate Pudding instead of butterscotch and bought a bag of snickers mini's instead of cutting up bars. I really liked it too, it reminded me somewhat of a caramel apple.

This tastes amazing! Definitely a delight for the taste buds! Try making it with vanilla pudding instead of butterscotch, and be sure to cut the Snicker pieces very small otherwise a single bite might be a little overkill for taste.
