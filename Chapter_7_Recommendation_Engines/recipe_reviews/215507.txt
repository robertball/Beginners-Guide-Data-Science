This has become one of my go-to recipes. It's quick, healthy, and a great way to get some greens into the diet. You can also add some meat, but its very good without.

Excellent.  I made this last night and my friends loved it!  The only change that I made (not on purpose) was the use of goat cheese.  I served the tacos along with a spicy pumpkin soup.  It was a really nice pairing.

This is so good, I've made it a weekly meal. I've left out the chicken broth or subbed with a splash of white wine. No salsa & still came out yummy Both kids 8 & 5 loved it.

First, may I recommend that you drain the chard after you cook it.  I didn't and it made for very soggy tacos.  Other than that, I like this recipe.  The only thing that I think I would do differently is to maybe add a splash of lemon or lime to the taco for a little zip.

My husband nearly choked when I told him we were having meatless tacos for dinner.  But after dinner, he couldn't stop saying how fantastic these were and that these were definitely a "do again".  I don't often make things more than once, so it's a privilege for a recipe to be added to the "do again" file.  
Note that a pinch of salt really is just a small pinch of salt.  I added a large pinch and it was borderline excessive.  I guess it depends on how much salt is in your chicken broth, too.  Also , next time, I'll use less red pepper and instead of mincing the garlic, I'll smash the gloves and pluck them out before I build the tacos.  
Also of note, I was only able to get 5 tacos out of this recipe which was fine for me and my husband.  If I were serving 4, I'd double the recipe.
Thanks for a great meatless taco recipe!

Thanks so much for sharing this! Never would have stumbled upon this in my kitchen experiments with mismatched ingredients, but I love it - for its taste, presentation, and use of ingredients I've been storing in the freezer for way too long! :)

Great recipe!  I tweaked it by adding fresh corn off the cob at the same time as the chard.  I also added some cumin, chili powder, and pepper for some extra flavor.  With a homemade salsa of tomatoes, red bell pepper, avocado, LOTS of cilantro, and lime, it was perfect. I didn't even need the cheese! Add a dash of Cafe Rio's tomatillo cilantro creamy dressing if you have one in the area!

i cannot overstate how much i LOVED this.  i doubled the chard and the chicken broth, and added a cup of leftover pre-cooked rice during the last cooking cycle to add some bulk.  used mozzarella cheese (something mild is key) and put on wheat/black bean tortillas with salsa.  loved loved LOVED. 

the filling is fantastic and i will probably eat it by itself tonight with a side of grilled chicken or something.

unfortunately, neither of my non-picky eater toddlers would touch the chard (i made theirs into a quesadilla) and my husband said it needed crunch.  maybe some raw chopped onions and tomatoes?  or put into crunch taco shells?  so... 4 stars for the peanut gallery.

Way better then I would have ever thought. I am trying to find some kid friendly vegetarian meals. One of three of my kids would try this and she had seconds! I had to make a second batch we ate so many!

Really tasty and quick to prepare.  I used feta cheese as I could not find the fresh cheese specified at any of the supermarkets in my area.  My husband enjoyed these, too, although he thought they were not "hearty" enough for a meal and said they were more like appetizers.

Very good base recipe! I used collard greens and spinach instead of the chard. I would have used veggie broth instead of the chicken to make it truly vegetarian but I was out so I used water instead. I also put some fresh homemade salsa, avocados, cilantro, black beans, and squeezed fresh lime juice on ours. With all of those extras it felt heavy enough for a main dish. Next time I'll add some corn to it and skip the queso fresco (expensive although good) and just use whatever cheese I have on hand. I also served it with spanish rice II from this site. Excellent! Thanks for the recipe.

This was VERY yummy! To make this a vegan meal, I substituted the chicken broth with vegetable broth and the queso fresca with tofu and it was fabulous! I warmed whole wheat tortillas in a little coconut oil and topped with homemade salsa fresca and these tasted like fish tacos! Excellent, fresh and so healthy!

I had no idea if I would like this or not because swiss chard does not sound like it would go in taco shells.  AMAZING!!  I made my own corn taco shells and my own salsa.  SO GOOD!!!  Can't wait to make it again, thanks!

Tasty... and different twist on eating greens. My father did not particularly like them but he is a special case :D.   Otherwise, I loved the queso fresco and salsa.

This is a tremendous dish, but it was my first attempt at chard, so there were some lessons learned.  We used jarred minced garlic and hard tacos instead of soft, which cut down on the time immensely -- took us probably about 40 minutes total.  Canned or frozen yellow corn would be a great add!

Recommendations:  
1.  Double or triple the chard.  We got four bunches of chard from our CSA and put in the largest and the smallest -- it amounted to about one heaping dinner plate of leaves -- but the result was more "onion tacos" than "chard tacos."  The contents filled six very skimpy tacos.  Next time, I will plan on filling a medium-to-large mixing bowl with chard.
2.  I would NOT recommend subbing in a more flavorful cheese (like feta) as another reviewer did.  The queso fresco serves to balance the spice in this dish.  If you want to use normal taco cheese, cut the pepper.
3.  Even with all that additional chard, I may cut the pepper just a tad next time.  It was quite spicy (and delicious!).  My mouth was still tingling after a glass of milk, a salad, and a yogurt-based dessert.
4.  I cut the spines out of my chard leaves.  I don't know if this was necessary, but I figured it was better to be safe than sorry in this case.  Would love to hear from other reviewers!

Swiss Chard Tacos win! I didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised. I agree with other reviewers to drain the chard after cooking to avoid the soggy taco bottom. I also added a few dashes of cajun seasoning to flavor it up a bit. Served with homemade salsa fresca this was a great success.

Something went a little wrong somewhere and our tacos ended up really juicy. I think if you plan ahead of time and have a few additional ingredients (rice would be yummy) this could really be a hit. Also I had a hard time finding the crumbled queso fresco cheese and had to use a substitute(shredded mexican blend) which may have not added to the dish like it was supposed to...

These tacos were delicious.  My husband liked them too.  I picked some chard from the garden this morning.  I did tone down the red pepper flakes to 1 teaspoon.  It was still a little hot.  1/2 teaspoon would be perfect for us.

This recipe was very easy.  I think I will like it much better with less heat.  I reduced the red pepper flakes to 1 tsp. and that was still way too hot for me. I want to taste the Swiss chard and cheese. I will try it again but with a pinch of red pepper flakes.

These tacos are absolutely delicious! This was my first time eating chard and I loved it. I lightly fried the tortillas to make them stronger and more flavorful. Since the tablespoon of pepper flakes already made it pretty spicy, I used medium tomatillo salsa to give it a little zing without adding a lot of heat. Yum!!!

This was yummy...but I added a little chicken.(shhh) I cooked the chicken with cumin and cayenne pepper. My kids didnt only want Chard so I had to mix it up a little. I heated the tortillas in the skillet and added some fresh tomatoes and cilantro. We left out the onions but it was still yummy. The chard is very spicy. We had lettuce, queso fresco, and black beans.

Love this recipe! It's easy to make, tasty and surprisingly filling. Our family prefers hard taco shells to corn tortillas, but it's good either way.

This was really good and not something I would think up myself.  I had some red chard I needed to use up and it turned out delicious.  I did not add broth, just a little extra olive oil.  I used red onions and feta, plus added a little cumin and chili powder like one reviewer suggested.  I will definitely make this again.

Delicious.  I added some leftover chicken to make the recipe more satisfying to my meat eating husband and teenage son.

These were great. Will surely make again, probably tonight.  Like the queso fresco because it adds a little saltiness.

This was very yummy! I made a couple small changes -  I used vegetable broth since we don't eat meat and  I only used about a teaspoon of the pepper flakes and it was still hot; I will use a bit less next time. Will definitely make again.

Oh wow! This was good. I’m a Texan, and this had enough kick to satisfy. I served it in taco shells.

I have made this recipe many times.  Loved the taste, but could never wait long enough to cook off all the liquid, so I always had soggy tacos.  The 5 minutes quoted cooking time is not nearly enough to evaporate the broth.  Best to drain the ingredients the best you can before adding to the taco.

This is very good! I thought it would be okay but woo it was yummy! I added cumin seeds when sauteing the onions to add some more spice. I just added red flakes to taste, knowing how much spicyness I like. Yumm. I will definitelymake it again

Was good but not as flavorful as I had hoped. It was my first time using chard in a recipe, so worth the try.

I added red pepper during the onion step and only a pinch of red pepper since I didn't want it too  spicy. Threw it on top of rice with some fish and fresh diced tomatoes - so yummy! I can see how the fish isn't even needed.  Definitely want to put it in a taco next time.

I am on a low-carb program, so I've substituted Lo-Carb wraps for the corn tortillas. They're made by LaTortilla Factory, and each, 8 inch wrap is 60 calories, 6 carbs net total (carbs, 15g minus fiber, 9g, = 6 carbs), less than 1g sugar, and 5g of protein).  I love these wraps and they come in other flavors, too.
