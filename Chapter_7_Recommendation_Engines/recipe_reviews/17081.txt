Loved this pie! I just wanted the lemon flavor so I left out the fruit cocktail. I only used one pie shell for a thick, creamy pie. Really refreshing on a hot summer day!

This makes a nice little dessert and I imagine would be great for summertime or workplace potlucks.  It is a tad sweet, however the lemon juice offsets this somewhat.  I substituted most of the lemon juice with lime juice (as I didnt have lemon).   I messed up the crust and only added 1/2 the required butter, so the crust on mine was kinda dry and falling off the cake.   I give this 5 stars though really feel it's 4 1/2. It's good, but a bit rich! But it is soooo easy. Mine was ready to eat within a couple of hours :)

My family loved this dessert. I omitted the lemon juice, thought it was lemony enough.  Very quick and easy to make just remember to do it the night before to allow time to freeze.  Very cool and refreshing on a hot summer day.

I have made been making this for years.  I have never used fruit cocktail.  I prefer to use blueberries.  Be sure your berries are well drained AND dried.  (Paper towels will do the trick).  There is nothing better than lemon and blueberries.  This recipe is requested over and over again and I am always happy to make it.

We liked the desert.  I left out the fruit cocktail.  The only thing to remember is to take it out of the freezer WAY before you need to serve it. I bent several utensils trying to cut it and get it out of the dish.  15-20 minutes was still not enough to cut it easily.  I will probably make it again.  It's cool and refreshing.  Note: 2 packets of the Honey Grahams was enough  crushed for a 9x13 dish and the 1/3 cup for the topping.

This is a great summer treat  I left out the fruit cocktail.  Next time I will add more lemon juice, I love a strong lemon flavor. Also very easy to make. Thanks for the recipe.

This is mild lemony creamy pie... so good we didn't wait for it to thaw but ate the first slice frozen. Soooo simple to make. I did not have fruit cocktail at the time but will make it with next time. I also did not use 9x13 but a ready-made graham crust which made a nice high pie.
