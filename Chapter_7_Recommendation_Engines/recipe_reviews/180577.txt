No pumpkin spice creamer on our shelves yet but I really wanted a really flavorful pumpkin spice latte. SO, I used a sugar free dry french vanilla creamer and added two heaping tablespoons of homemade pumpkin pie spice to the mix. This was just what I needed. This was a little sweet for me so next time, I'll cut back on the sugar or eliminate it completely.

I cannot find any powdered pumpkin spice creamer!  Coffemate makes the liquid kind, and I've been to 3 stores so far with no luck.  I'd like to make this and give as gifts, so if anyone has suggestions on where to find the powdered Pumpkin spice creamer, I'm listening! Hence the 3 stars--have not tried it because I can't find the key ingredient.

All this really tastes like is a coffee with some fake tasting creamer in it.  If you like the taste and mouthfeel of instant creamers than you may like this. The Coffee Mate Pumpkin Spice Creamer doesn't have a strong  flavor on its own.  Diluting with vanilla creamer dulls the pumpkin flavor even more. Try it before you give this as a gift.  I scaled this down to one serving and even used instant espresso, but it didn't do a thing for me.

I think this is ok, but it doesn't have that rich taste you'd expect. I had to invent my own pumpkin spice powdered creamer. I used instant espresso instead of regular instant coffee and that certainly gave it extra richness.  I ended up adding some whipped cream and sprinkled extra pumpkin seasoning on top. All-in-all it is simply a watery flavored coffee. Maybe using liquid creamer would help give it some body.

I used the calculate button to make 2 servings to try this. There must be a missing ingredient or an incorrect calculation somewhere. This tasted like watered down coffee with powdered creamer. Maybe milk would have been better than water, maybe more flavorings, or more sugar. As is, it is just not good. I was really hoping to like this and make a big batch up before trying a single cup.
