Cake mix cakes usually don't impress me, but this one is tasty!  I didn't have lemon yogurt so I used part vanilla yogurt and part sour cream.  I also used orange juice for the water.  I grated a little lemon peel as well into the batter.  After it cooled, I mixed fresh lemon juice, brown sugar, honey and a little milk and poked holes into the cake and drizzled the glaze over top.  Definitely a keeper!

This was very easy, and very good.  I made a lemon glaze for the cake by combining lemon peel, lemon juice and powdered sugar until I obtained my desired amount and consistency.  A VERY tasty dessert!

Very good! Very moist, to the point of being nearly gooey. I made the glaze someone else suggested, with powdered sugar, lemon juice, and lemon peel grated--but this recipe really doesn't require any topping. I used plain yogurt and doubled the lemon juice. Thanks! this is a keeper for sure.

This recipe is extremely easy and fast.  Make sure it cools completely in the pan or transferral to a cake plate can be a mess.  (my mistake)  I also made a little frosting for the top which gave it a delicious and beautiful finish.  I'd love to try it making my own yellow cake, but the store brand was just fine.

Yummy and very moist!  I made my own drizzle of confectioners sugar, milk, and left over lemon yogurt.  Thanks for the great treat!

I added lemon zest to the batter, but still wasn't as lemony as I was looking for. Also, was looking for a denser cake, while this one is pretty light. I'll keep looking, but if you're looking for a slight lemon taste and a light cake give this one a try.

This is a great, truly quick cake.  I added the lemon zest from the lemons I used for juice, and made them into mini muffins perfect for my two-year-old.  They are zesty and yummy!  I could have added more zest for added zing, but these are great...

Loved this! Really easy and quick, better totally satisfying.  I couldn't find lemon yogurt (6ounces), so I subbed vanilla and used lemon cake mix instead of regular yellow.  Still used the same amount of lemon juice.

Also, I used this for muffins instead of a cake.  Let them bake for 15 minutes at 325 and they came out super moist and tasty!  Everyone loves them so far.

My son loved this and gave it a big "thumbs up" with a mouthful of cake. I used sour cream with some lemon extract in place of the yogurt. I also used pound cake so it was a little heavy and certainly didn't rise much, but it was very moist and had great flavor. My husband doesn't like lemon poppy seed so he didn't care much for this, but the rest of us did. Thanks for a such an easy recipe for a nice quick cake.

I would forgo the glaze. Found it overwhelming, and the cake really doesn't need it. Next time, I think I'll just dust it with confectioner's sugar. Cake was a little "wet" but that may be because I had trouble measuring the yogurt. It's only available in 6 oz containers around here; I was assuming 8 oz would be 1 cup, but it seemed to take more than 1/3 of the second container to fill the measuring cup. But my daughter, who asked for it as a 19th birthday cake, didn't mind.

This was a very easy recipe to follow and turned out wonderful.  The only things i changed was i used vanilla yogart and cooked in a 9 X 13 pan.  Took only 30 mintues to cook and turned out WONDERFUL.  I didn't add a topping but might next time.

I made this into a layer cake with Sturdy Cream Cheese Frosting from this site. I'm usually a bake from scratch person so I was surprised at how much I LOVED this cake. It was phenomenal! I can't wait to make it again.

I made this cake for dinner at a neighbors. It was delicious. Nice and lemony . I switched things up by using lemon cake mix and vanilla yogurt. Added lemon zest to the mix. I also had fresh blueberries on hand and put those in. I cooked it in a springform pan and made a lemon glaze with confectioners sugar, lemon zest and lemon juice and drizzle it over the top. Yummm!
