A very good and delicious twist to pasta.  We played ‘guess the ingredient’ and my family never did guess the pumpkin in the sauce.  I made the recipe as written, tried it on some pasta, and then added 2 ingredients.  It was fine as written; I just knew my family would like a little spice.    I added some red pepper flakes (1 T.)  for a little zip  and some fresh spinach for added veggies.  I will make this again, although I will be using spicy Italian sausage, next time.  We liked the addition of spinach, so I would use that again.  My pasta was medium shells as that is what I had on hand.  Thanks jmcnutt28 for this recipe, we enjoyed it.

I partially grilled chicken sausage, sliced and finished cooking with the onions. I used one whole onion and fat free half/half. I added some cream cheese, red pepper flakes, and spinach. My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe!

I'm giving this a 4, but I made a few small changes that could have adversely affected it.  I used 1 cup of sour cream and left out the half-and-half.  I also used sweet Italian turkey sausage instead of regular Italian sausage, hoping to appeal to my toddler.  I added spinach leaves just before serving, which really brightened it up, and I also used about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese.  I will make it again, next time using the half-and-half and the regular Italian sausage, and expect it will be 5 stars.

What a great dish. I made this for lunch today and my family loved it. I served it with a Cesar salad, the artichoke Parmesan French bread and for desert I made the coconut flan! All from this site everyone just enjoyed it. Will definitely make this again. Thank you again for sharing a great dish...

This was such a quick recipe to make and so delicious!  I used mild Italian turkey sausage (always our preference),  added kale after the onion had cooked for a few minutes and seasoned the kale with the nutmeg and cinnamon before adding the other ingredients.  I also added a few shakes of  red pepper flakes and 2 teaspoons of brown sugar while sauce was simmering.   I topped the dish with toasted chopped pecans, fresh diced tomatoes and Parmesan.  Will definitely make this again.

This tasted great.  I boiled the onions with the broth, doubled the sour cream, and left the half-and-half out.  I also used 1.5 cups shredded Parmesan.

This was OK, but I probably won't make it again. The nutmeg was overpowering, so if I did make it again I would half the amount.

Great recipe. A+ for versatility. I really wanted to make it tonight and had to make some substitutions. I made it with steamed hubbard squash as I didn't have canned pumpkin handy. I used the food processor to puree the squash along with a 1/8 cup of apple cider.

Also, I used Italian(hot) chicken sausage as a substitute for the pork sausage. 

The sauce was creamy and delicious. I like to use an Argentine Parmesan for the grated cheese. Does a nice job of blending with sauces.

This pasta dish is supremely delicious. More than what the photos lead on. Prepare to be amazed. We love pasta dishes, but my husband doesn't do so well with tomato sauces - this was an instant hit.

This was so easy and good! I made a few changes that I think made it better and healthier too: I replaced half and half and sour cream with 1 cup plain yogurt. I added about 6 oz frozen chopped spinach to sausage mixture. And I used spinach feta chicken sausage instead of Italian.

This is in regular rotation during fall/winter. We love it!  First time I made it, I hid the can of pumpkin so my husband wouldn't see it (he doesn't like anything healthful contaminating his pasta).   The dish smells wonderful when it's cooking-I told him it was a new sausage & pasta w/cream sauce dish.   This is a delicious & quick meal.   Dish is delicious as written - if you like a little kick, add cayenne pepper.

What a fantastic recipe.  I have never tried anything like this before but tonight I stepped out of my comfort zone and was I glad I did.  My wife and I just loved it.  This is an absolute keeper.

Somethings just don't belong together. I love scotch, I love bourbon and I love beer...just not together in the same glass. I love pumpkin and I love pasta with Italian sausage...just not together in the same dish. (:o(

Loved it!  Made it as directed and it came out perfect.  Expected halfhearted likes from the kids and they all raved about it instead.  Definitely a 5 Star rating.

I have made this three times. Each time I felt like there was something missing but couldn't figure it out.  I made it today one more time and left out the nutmeg and added in about 1/2tsp yellow curry powder and its perfect!!  Absolutely delicious. I think next time I'll try tossing in some baby spinach.

Very easy to prepare and very tasty! I did not see the other reviews until after I prepared the dish but would definitely have enjoyed the addition of spinach for a pop of color and added nutrition!

I found this to be delicious and flavorful!  I could taste the pumpkin, but it was not overpowering, making a very simple, elegant pasta dish, good enough for company as well as a quick weeknight dinner!

This was a very different recipe, but it was surprisingly tasty. I used sweet Italian turkey sausage with the casings removed (the recipe didn't specify whether to use sweet or spicy) and Greek yogurt instead of sour cream (tastes EXACTLY the same and fewer calories!). Also added garlic salt and extra parmesan cheese, which enhanced the flavor. I feel like it needed something, maybe a vegetable, but I'm not sure what. In any case, this was a great fall/winter dish -- very creamy and savory. Next time I will add an extra sausage link.

This was just plain weird tasting. I thought I was going to have to throw it all out, but oddly enough the parm and italian seasoning on the end saved it somewhat to at least be edible. Won't make again!

This was delicious! Our local market sells a spice called Simon & Garfunkle (parsley, sage, rosemary & thyme) and I added a teaspoon of that.  I also used a whole onion, hot Italian sausage and added about 6-8 oz. spinach. It was perfect for a cool autumn night. Will definitely make again!

Both my husband and I loved this recipe.  I used evaporated milk instead of the half and half, and fresh pumpkin instead of canned.  We'll definitely be making it again.

I added a pinch of cayenne because I like a little heat, and I put the Italian seasoning right into the pot. It was very good!

This was an amazing recipe!
I realized why it doesn't work for some, you must use a true italian sausage. That flavour is what balances out all the other ingredients along with the Italian seasonings. 
I did cut back a little on the cinnamon and nutmeg and for my taste was awesome! 
Instead of using just pasta I elected to use a 5 cheese tortellini, was amazing. As others said my wife couldn't figure out the main ingredient, pumpkin...she never takes a second helping, but she did and we heated up the rest for lunch the next day. Sauce thickened up the next day so a little water helped to create the texture desired. 
You won't be disappointed!

This has quickly become a family favorite.  My stepson asked for the recipe and has made it numerous times.  I'm now sharing it at my (step)granddaughter's bridal shower.  I often make it with low or fat-free dairy ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is really good. I added some extra white pepper just because I like it but followed the recipe exactly. Ii will definitely make again. I think I will add some pepper flakes next time and cut back on the nutmeg because it's not my favorite flavor which is why I gave it a four. Thanks for a great recipe I will make many times.

Made this for dinner tonight for my family of nine. Out of the nine of us, only one liked it. My kids are mostly teenage and young 20-something boys who usually eat anything. Only my 17-year-old would eat more than a few bites. For anyone thinking of trying this recipe, I'd suggest leaving out the nutmeg and cinnamon completely.

I made this for a fall garden club meeting for 28 women.  Most everyone liked it and "licked their platters clean."  I used penne 
Pasta as recommended in another recipe I have.  I will make it again, but not regularly, as the taste is delicious but not common.  Definitely a fall recipe.

I followed the recipe with the exception of using low sodium chicken broth and the addition of a little cream cheese, which I add to a lot of things, to create a smoother, slightly richer sauce.  I added the nutmeg and cinnamon a little at a time to avoid overdoing it.  I probably used a little better than half of what was listed for each.  Excellent recipe, especially for Fall.

I made it with chicken sausage which gave it an odd texture that I was not a fan of.  Had a good flavor.  Next time I will try at as directed.

Totally enjoyed this recipe. I did use about 2 pounds of sausage though. I served it to some friends and everyone really enjoyed it.

Very good, and easy to make. I pretty much followed the recipe, except I used fresh, oven roasted carnivale squash, because it's what I had on hand. I also added a jalapeno pepper to give it a little warmth. This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was good and pretty pumpkin-y, actually! Both the pumpkin purée and the nutmeg were evident flavors. I did think that the dish was a bit bland and missing some dimension. I did make some slight changes to the dish but nothing that would significantly impact the flavor: used farfalle pasta, and added the Parmesan and Italian seasoning to taste. The Italian sausage was tasteless, but this wasn’t the fault of the recipe: I shouldn’t have used the cheap grocery store version. If I made again, I might try adding some spice such as red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper, and better quality sausage.

I didn't have Italian sausage, so I omitted it, thinking the sauce would be just as good on its own. Well, that sausage is a major flavor element. Without it the dish is edible but kind of blah. Now I know.

My family really liked this. I made it as stated, except for using plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  It was delicious, but I felt like it was missing... something. I will definitely make it again but I'll experiment a little to see if I can make it even better.

Great sauce! I served this over gnocchi instead of pasta and jarred the remaining sauce (about half) for future use. 

I don't like sour cream so I omitted it and the sauce still tasted great. I make use 100% heavy cream instead of half and half next time to make up for this omission.

My two year old loved all of the "sneaky sausage" in the sauce!

This is a really good comfort food for a cold fall or winter day! Super easy.  I added well chopped spinach and used only half of the chicken broth called for as the sauce would have been too thin then.

This dish is incredibly delicious and so easy to prepare.  If you love pasta and want to try something different, you should check this out.  It may seem like pumpkin pie when you peruse the ingredients, but it is savory.  I made no changes to the ingredients or amounts.

First round was good, a little strong, as my family said, it tasted more like a dessert, so I will have to adjust the amount of pumpkin(less) and sausage(more) in it, I suggest doubling the sausage and maybe half or 3/4 the pumpkin, I will also add something spicy to it or try hot Italian sausage ¿

This was definitely worth a try. It has an unusual taste to it that we found very fall like. I might use less nutmeg next time as my family felt it was really a predominate flavor. I didn’t salt the sauce during cooking, preferring to salt at the table. Salt did perk it up a bit.  We will make this again.

I would make it again.  I used half sweet and half hot Italian sausage and added pork stock instead of chicken.  Just a little at a time until I got the desired consistancy, also used Asiago instead of Parmesean.  All round a very nice comfort food dish.  I will make it again.

Came out really good.  Pretty much followed recipe except used Greek yogurt because I didn't have sour cream in the house. I also added some baby spinach toward the end.  I had extra canned pumpkin from a big can after making pumpkin bread.  It reminded me of pumpkin ravioli that I've had in various Italian restaurants. Will make again. Thanks for sharing this recipe

I used half of the nutmeg and cinnamon than the recipe called for, as I thought it might be more than I'd like after reading through the reviews.  I'm glad I made the choice, but plan to experiment with that more.  I added crumbled chicken sausage and fresh spinach and liked that modification.  Overall, a good recipe that I would try again.

Pumpkin is one of my favorite vegetables and this pasta recipe was amazing.  I will definitely be making it often. I prefer fresh pumpkin so I used that.

I thought it was easy and good.  Not great but good.  Maybe some veggies like squash or broccoli or kale might have made it more tasty?

Made it for dinner tonight and it turned out great. Wife thought I had flipped when she saw the pumpkin can while I was preparing the sauceWe like spicy so I bought “hot” italian sausage and used six large cloves of garlic.  Added another half teaspoon of cinnamon but couldn’t find freshly grated nutmeg so I bought whole nutmeg.  Couldn’t figure out how to grate it without skinning my knuckles so I used 1 tsp powdered nutmeg.

I made this almost the same as the recipe, substituting milk for the half and half. I also added extra parmesan cheese and mixed it in. It was terrific! It almost fooled me into thinking it was a cheese sauce like mac n cheese. I will definitely be making this again. I didn't think the nutmeg and cinnamon would go well in a savory dish, but it worked. The spices we're not overpowering to me.

This got better the more I ate it. A nice variation on usual pasta sauce, and it was easy to put together (no more than 30 minutes total.) I don't see our family craving it, but I'll make it once a year in the fall.

I will make this again, yummy and creamy.  Cut back on nutmeg, just not a fan, and used hot Italian sausage. We all agreed it was a tasty fall dinner. Pretty easy and quick. Not only was the sauce flavorful but a lovely color. Good eating!

I added a small can of prepared spaghetti sauce and I loved it. Other than that I really like this recipe and it was at the perfect time, I had roasted pumpkin and didn't have a clue what I was going to do with it after Halloween.  I don't eat sweets, so this was perfect.  Thank you Allrecipes for sending this to my inbox.

It turned out to be different than expected.  I first made it as the recipe states to add Italian seasoning and parmesan over the top, but it still seemed to be lacking something.  I took the advice of others to add curry which was better.

Both my husband and I loved this dish. You can most definitely taste the pumpkin. Made the entire box  of pasta, added only three fourths of it to the sauce.

I used turkey sausage and also added a pinch of red pepper flake and some fresh spinach at the end to the sauce. Next time I will definitely add more garlic (because I usually always do) and probably just try all sour cream (for convenience sake).

I've made this recipe three times, trying to get the amount of pasta right.  If you use the whole box, the flavor gets lost, so either make more sauce or use less pasta.  I recommend 2/3 - 3/4 of the box.  One of my kids really liked the flavor, and when I made it for book club, they liked it, too.  Half of the group went for seconds.  I liked and and would make it again, but my husband is not a big fan of cream sauces.  Good luck!

I prepared it as written the first time and the family really enjoyed it. any leftovers were gone by the next day. I added root vegetables to it the second time and used Turkey sausage in order to make it a bit healthier - still a hit. I did add Italian seasoning to the pan rather than sprinkling (with a touch more majoram-our preference) and omitted the additional salt. I might try pureed butternut in it as well.  I usually accompany it with a pear and gorganzola salad. This recipe is a nice alternative to the usual pumpkin curries I make throughout the fall and winter. Definitely worth a try!

I will most certainly make it again. I made the following changes. I used turkey sausage crumbles instead of bulk Italian sausage, Greek Yogurt  instead of sour cream, and served it over Spaghetti Squash.  My family loved it.

This is delicious. Very straightforward/easy recipe., a perfect quick fall weeknight supper. The flavor reminds me a bit of pastitsio, which I love.  Used reduced fat versions of half 'n half and sour cream.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made this for dinner on a whim. It was a delicious surprise!  The only change I made was the pasta itself.  I used angel hair.  I will definitely be making this again!  It is company-worthy served with a salad and crusty bread.  Next batch, I think I'll try adding portobello mushrooms to the sauté.

So honestly I will say that I liked this recipe and I followed it exactly (which I hardly ever do) but it wasn't much of a hit. I think next time I will spruce it up by tweaking the recipe a bit.

This is amazing! I found this when I had a pound of sausage and no red sauce on hand. I added a little sugar. It's just a family preference that pasta sauce is semi sweet. My toddler surprisingly loved this as well. My husband was the only one to say it was only ok but he still ate 2 bowls. :-)

Love the originality of this recipe. My family greatly enjoyed this dish. I was a bit hesitant at first, as I've never used pumpkin in a main dish before, but the final result was absolutely delicious.

This was an interesting mix of ingredients for a sauce, so I felt compelled to try it.   I followed the recipe completely and it wasn't bad.   Flavors blended well and it's a nice change from a normal red or white sauce.   However --- the recipe does make a LOT and the sauce is very very rich.   Had a plate of it and was feeling stuffed.   An hour later, I can't even fathom wanting more of that for leftovers tomorrow.   Just too heavy for me, so I won't be making this again.

Great recipe... I made some changes as well. Instead of Campanelle pasta I used egg noodles. I also added Mushrooms and spinach and deglazed the pan with white wine. Turned out nicely and my girlfriend loved it!!

I thought the cinnamon and the nutmeg would be overpowering, but they weren't. The addition of italian seasoning and parmesan is a must. But even still, I feel like this was lacking any sort of freshness. It's just kind of heavy and not anything special.

So yummy, great for a fall day. I used turkey sausage too lower some of the calories- still had great flavor. I also added pumpkin pie spice- a lot! I love pumpkin! I didnt use the full can of chicken broth, only about 3/4 of a cup. I also only used the half/half cream instead of the sour cream. It was aleeady SO creamy and rich. Instead of normal pasta noodles i put this sauce on top of 'Zucchini noodles' you can geat the recipe from this site. It was a filling and delicious low carb pasta dish!

I used chorizo sausage as that is what I happened to have on hand already and light sour cream. Even though it seems like an odd combo the flavors mixed together very well and tasted delicious. Topped with freshly grated parmesan cheese, fantastic!

I love this, and while this is not my family's favorite meal, it is becoming a fall staple meal for us...... It is quick, nutritious, and a warming, filling meal that stays with you.  A quick salad, maybe some bread on the side, and that's all you need. More veggies are always welcome, and frozen broccoli goes well with this, etc., but this is fast, warming, and my husband who (still) hates pumpkin smiles and can put up with both me and this dish!

This tasted bland the first day - BUT AWESOME THE SECOND.  I used mild Italian sausage and may try spicy next time.  Only used half the amount of nutmeg & cinnamon - scared it might taste like pumpkin pie.  Also used full cup of sour cream instead of half half-and-half.

I've made this twice. First time used sausage and it wasn't really good. Made it the second time with just hamburger and it was amazing. A healthy sub for the sour cream is plan greek yogurt!!

This was a change of pace for us but not something we will repeat. The sauce was OK but we needed something else/more than cinnamon and nutmeg to flavor it. I did like the pumpkin added, it made the creaminess nicely complex. Thanks for sharing.

Quick and easy, and tasted great. I left out the cinnamon and nutmeg, since I don't generally like that in my squash (though I know many others do). It was delicious. I might use yogurt instead of the half and half and sour cream next time. I suspect this is the sort of thing that can take a lot of different variations and additions, which is always nice to have.

So delicious!  You could change up the sausage and make it more vegetarian-friendly, but we loved the blend of flavors!  I added a bit of heat with chipotle pepper, but you could leave this out if your family doesn't do spicy

very savory.  My wife and I enjoyed it for dinner.  This made enough to have leftovers for lunch the next day.  I added a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little spice and will use more onion next time.

Tried this exactly as written and served with a mixed green salad plus a family favorite cottage cheese, fruit, jello and whipped cream recipe.  The pasta dish received raves from everyone, even my picky brother-in-law.  Will be making this for special occasions. Hink.

I thought there was a missing flavor here...can't quite come up with what it is.  It did make a nice, creamy sauce.  I might try it again.  Does anyone have a helpful hint on what to add?

This was pretty good.  The only change I made was using vegetable broth instead of chicken and it still turned out creamy and the mixture of flavors were just right.  My daughter complained simply because she dislikes the strong smell of garlic but even she said it was good.  I will definitely try this again.

Wonderful. Followed the recipe as written. When I read the spices to be used, I couldn't imagine the combination tasting like a pasta dish. How surprised I was. It's like eating a creamy mac and cheese only better. As the dish sits, it thickens. You can solve this easily by thinning with more chicken broth. A great cold weather comfort food.

This was yummy, but I have to mention I didn't follow the recipe as written: I used fresh, steamed pumpkin (not canned): I forgot the garlic (instead sprinkled garlic powder in); I added maybe an extra 1/4 c. half-and-half to make it a bit creamier.  Still really tasty!
