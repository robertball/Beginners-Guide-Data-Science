I tweaked these cookies to make them more chocolatey, and it worked.  I probably would've been fine with the nutella chocolateyness, but I'm not a chocolate person.  I decided to add both cocoa powder and chocolate chips to address that issue.  I subbed cocoa powder for a 1/2 cup of the flour and added 1 cup of chocolate chips.  The dough was dry, probably bc I subbed the cocoa powder, so I used 2 eggs total to address that.  I'd probably only use 3/4 c of chocolate chips next time if I use them; a little too many chocolate chips for this dough.  The dough does not spread even though I didn't refrigerate it.  I must say I'm surprised by that bc of the oils in the Nutella.  Regardless, I just dealt with that by squishing the cookies flat on the baking sheet prior to baking with a spatula.  I baked mine for about 10 min.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'm excited I've found something to use our Nutella in.  We love it but often forget about it!

I made the balls smaller than golf-ball size and the first batch started browning on the bottom very quickly at 400. I reduced the heat to 375 and played with baking times in subsequent batches. They're nice and chocolatey but I might even add a teaspoon or 2 of cocoa next time. I'll need to play with this recipe because I think the ideal product will be like a brownie. I just haven't gotten there yet. I also added some toasted hazelnuts which added to the Nutella goodness!

I live in a "Nutella as a Staple Food" household, so I was so excited to find a Nutella recipe for cookies. I followed the recipe exactly as it said give or take a few cooking minutes. But I am really disappointed with the cookies. I guess I was expecting something with a strong Nutella flavor, so the weak chocolately flavor really burst my bubble. The cookie also came out really flat. And while I am at it, I may as well add that this serves WAY more than just twelve. This could be a great recipe if someone did some major revision.

These cookies might taste good if you just imagined them instead of actually baking them. They look more like meatballs than delicious pastries. Follow each direction exactly and you will achieve the same masterpiece we did.

I added 1/2 cup cocoa powder to this recipe, and baked at 375 instead of 400. I love these cookies|!

These were not very good. I took the advice of the reviewer above me and added two eggs and I used some good quality cocoa powder in the mix and some chocolate chips. The taste of the chocolate and nutella barely came through. They were relatively tasteless ;(
