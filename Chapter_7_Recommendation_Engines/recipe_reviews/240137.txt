This recipe looks simplistic but these sweet potatoes are sweet, sticky, and sublime. I gave it only four stars since it needs a few tweaks (at least IMO) to get it from good to great. 
First, the proportions. The sauce given is enough for five large sweet potatoes. That's the perfect amount of coating. 
Second, to up the flavor I added 1 tsp. of salt and 1/2 tsp. each of black pepper and garlic powder.
Last, I found it needed to cook for an hour, not half an hour, to get really soft and delicious. 
Once you make these changes, you've got a winner. Every member of my family loved it!

For me, the correct ratio was 2 tablespoons of honey to one tablespoon of olive oil for each sweet potato.  Also, I baked it for an hour because I preferred the sweetness of the carmelized sweet potatoes; I used a lot less cinnamon and seasoned with kosher salt and pepper â€“ personal preference.  These were addicting!

I really liked this recipe! It was easy to follow. Easy to do. And the family loved it. For mines I cut 2 apples to put in with the sweet potato. I also mixed the cinnamon in with the oil and honey and then put it in the oven. I did not feel that i needed the extra round of oil and honey after it was out. So I just used the 1/4 oil and 1/2 cup of honey. Delicious!

I'm not a sweet potato fan, but I'll eat them like this. Very delicious.  I followed the recipe, except after 30 minutes I flipped them to coat the underside, and decided they needed another 20 min. We like them soft. They were perfect.  I did not use the cinnamon as we do not like it.  I did not drizzle with honey at the end as it didn't need it.  I will definitely make this again.  Because I cooked it longer, it did burn the pan a bit.  Next time I'll line the pan with foil.

These were easy and tasty, but I took the advice of one reviewer and cut down on the honey and olive oil a bit.

I loved this recipe.  I did not add the cinnamon as we have a family member who is allergic to it. It was great without it. Had to eat it last on the plate though because it was so decadent I felt like I was eating dessert before eating dinner.

Loved this recipe after tweaking just a little. Roasted the potatoes shaken with olive oil and sprinkled with kosher salt for about 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes, then coat 2 unpeeled apples cut into bite size chunks (doesn't seem to matter what kind but I like tartness to balance the potato) with 2 tbs each of honey and maple syrup and add  apples to potato sheet, drizzle remaining syrup mix over apples and potatoes, roast for 20-30 minutes until apples soft.

I found this recipe was a bit too sauce-y. I think next time I will try it but with half the oil, honey and cinnamon. Otherwise the flavour is really good!

Made it tonight but totally forgot to dust with cinnamon.  Still wound up being really good. I cut back the amount of honey and olive oil but kept the 2:1 ratio. They got really nice and caramelized.  We will definitely make again.
