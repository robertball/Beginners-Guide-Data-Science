I'll be honest. I started out having my doubts about this recipe. However, I think it's perfect and I am not even big rosemary fan. I did squeeze the liquid out of my zucchini and used the cheeses I had on hand. This does make 16 muffin cups. Not 6! They were moist and ready for me at 20 minutes. Everyone ate 2 including my 6 year old. Nothing I would change about this recipe. Thanks!

really great idea. could be fantastic little brunch items.  here are my suggestions: 1) add salt 2) reduce rosemary 3) don't need all of the quinoa - maybe 1/2?  4) maybe a dash of tobasco in the mix? just to kick it up a notch?
My batch made 9 very full muffin cups. The tops with the crispy parmesan are yummy -- so, maybe instead of 9 heaping muffins, try 12 not-so-full muffins. that way you'll have more crispy top per muffin. I'm going to give them another shot.

There turned out AMAZING!! Added a little garlic and it gave it the perfect balance of flavor with the fresh rosemary. DEFINITELY making this regularly. Perfect for mornings when youâ€™re running out the door

Yes, I used this recipe as a starting point. I did not keep it vegetarian. In place of zucchini, I used finely chopped vidalia onion. In place of black beans, I used a half cup of diced baked potato and a quarter cup of diced ham. In place of parmesan cheese, I used  new york sharp cheese. And omitted the rosemary. It was delicious, a real hit. When I get the other ingredients together, I will make it vegan italian. Very good recipe!

Easy to make and healthy;  unfortunately very bland. Next time I'll increase the egg, decrease the quinoa , saute some onions with the zucchini first to add flavor and maybe put some cheddar cheese in the mix.

Great recipe!  Be sure to press the shredded zucchini to drain of the excess liquid and add some extra Parmesan cheese to the top for a nice brown finish and crunchiness.  I find that the recipe makes enough for 12 good sized muffins.  Don't skimp on the zucchini!  They cook best in my nonstick Wilton muffin tin.  We like to have them on trips as breakfast travel food because the muffins are good cool though best five minutes out of the oven or reheated briefly in the microwave.
