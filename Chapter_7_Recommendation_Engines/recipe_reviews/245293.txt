After all recipes managed to delete my entire account.. I tried to search and find my recipes. This is not the correct picture for this recipe but it is mine. This is the first attempt at making this and my family loved it but I appreciate all the reviews.

It was good, I did have to add a little more flavor to it, but with the right amount of seasonings, I would make it again

This was a very easy recipe to put together.   I did add more cheese and added chopped bacon, to the top.  Came out pretty good.

This really has potential but as it is,  lacks the great flavor I expected.   I love cauliflower but this recipe need a little boost in the flavor department.
