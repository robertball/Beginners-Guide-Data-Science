Full of flavors!  I did make a few changes-added cauliflower to the broccoli to equal about 2.5 cups;  instead of cream of mushroom soup, melted 1T butter with 1T flour then added 3/4 c veggie broth and 1/2 c half and half and simmered for 5 minutes; instead of french-fried onions I used 1/2 c chopped onion, and topped the whole dish with homemade seasoned bread crumbs.  We will definitely use this again!

My husband, stepson and I all loved it and went back for seconds. Definitely will become one of our regulars.  I halved the amound of fried onions to cut down on fat and calories and opted for 1 medium onion sauteed in a little olive oil instead.

Excellent taste.  Not much difference between this and a broccoli/cheese or green bean casserole.  Instead of the additional french onions on the top, I used some bread crumbs and added them the last five minutes of cooking as directed.  I used maybe 1/3 cup.  I just trimmed and steamed the broccoli by placing it in a bowl with a bit of water and cling wrap over the top for 3 min in the microwave.  Does the same thing as a steamer insert.  I'll use more broccoli next time as I don't think 2 c. is enough for my taste.

I thought the recipe was very good.  I however use a lot of spice.  So I added 2 chopped cloves of garlic, 1/4 teaspoon of tarragon, 1 tsp of parsley, 1 tsp of basil, and used homemade chicken stock for the Quinoa.  My family ate it all.  I have two girls 14, and 11 and they asked next time to make more. :)  So it was successful.

Very good. Something different than the boring, standby rice casserole.  The only substitutions I made were to cook the quinoa in chicken stock (as I usually do), and I topped with bread crumb topping for the last 5 minutes of baking instead of more onions.  This is one of those "flexible" recipes.....easy to add your favourite veggies and spices.  Will definitely be making this again, but will add 2-3 large cloves of garlic (chopped) next time.  We are meat eaters in this house so this is a side dish for us, but it could easily be made into a one pot meal by adding shredded, cooked chicken.  I gave it 4 stars because it needs garlic, the kids weren't too fond of it (but to be fair this recipe is very similar to the rice version, which they don't like) and because the presentation is, well, "looks like slop" my husband said.  But its yummy slop!

LOVE, LOVE LOVE it! Although I made some changes.  I sauteed onions, red, orange and yellow peppers and then added the quinoa.  I used broccoli, cauliflower and carrots because that was all I had.  We had 2 meals out of it and Quinoa will now be a staple in our house.

Very yummy!! I might have cooked the quinoa a bit less next time because I like it a bit more 'poppy' or crunchy, but I enjoyed it much better than regular rice and I am a big fan of rice.

Yummy! I used plain greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. I cooked the quinoa chicken broth for more flavor. I added some extra mushrooms I had in the fridge. I forgot to add lemon pepper and it was still great. I did not have any fried onions so I used bread crumbs instead. Thank you for sharing, I will definetly make this again =)

This was one of my first tries with quinoa. I went with the basics on the recipe. I included the quinoa, broccoli, cheese and sour cream. I then used 1T butter and 1T flour for a rue. Then added in 3/4 vegetable broth and 1/2 cup half and half instead of cream of mushroom. I added breadcrumbs on top and left out the French onions.

Yummy!  Took some time, but easy to do ahead, just through in oven when needed.  I stopped using canned cream of mushroom, celery, chicken, a while ago. I keep a dry mix in my pantry that I made myself.  It tastes amazing, and only a few ingredients that you CAN pronounce!  I substitute plain greek yogurt for the sour cream, and added other veggies.  I also used the cheese I had on hand, brie, and cheddar; what a great combo!  Finally, I omitted the fried onions, used just a little panko bread crumbs on the top.
One negative observation, the appearance!  It looked like a pile of mush, but a very tasty one!

Good, but it seems like it needs more moisture. Also seems to be a funny taste with the lemon pepper. I'd try it again, but maybe add in a bit of milk or something to create more of a moist consistency.

A lovely and different side dish (or for me, an entree'/one dish meal)!  I doubled the recipe, but forgot to add the second can of soup--it turned out OK, and maybe the other can of soup would've made it too salty?  I thought the lemon pepper taste was a little funky--next time I prepare I'll just use fresh ground pepper, and if missing flavor maybe add fresh squeezed lemon.  Easy to modify for even lower sodium and fat based on ingredients used...a keeper!

Very good. I added a little shredded mozzarella cheese to the recipe and used crackers for the topping since I didn't have the onion topping.

So good! I think I like this better than the standard broccoli, rice and cheese casseroles. I followed the directions but it might be fun to add other veggies to the mix. I will be making it again.

Love this recipe.  Made it once with the lemon pepper and now without.  Everyone liked it better without in my family.
I make a double batch and freeze half - take it out of the freezer the night before and a super easy homemade meal for nights when the kids have activities.

This was really good! Used it as a side dish to chicken and a main course for the vegetarians in the house. I will be making this again and may try using cream of broccoli soup in place of the cream of mushroom. Thanks for the recipe!

We found this recipe is good. I plan on trying it again with a bit of changes. I might use half a can of cream of mushroom instead of a full can. And maybe a bit less sour cream.

Excellent recipe and super versatile!  I accidentally pimped it out a bit by throwing in some pre-cooked vegetarian chxn (I swear, I thought I saw chicken in the recipe the first read-through... I'm used to getting carnivorous recipes and vegetarianizing them) and substituted alfredo sauce and chopped up mushrooms in place of the cream of mushroom soup (I realized too late that my parents didn't have any on hand).  Anyhow, it's delicious, super easy, and difficult to screw up!

I modified it slightly. Added cooked chicken, used Creme of Celery (instead of mushroom) and pureed the broccoli.  This recipe s absolutely delicious

I made the mistake of using vanilla flavored yogurt (to substitute for the sour cream)!  LOL LOL. Still ate 2 servings, though. But now that I read the nutrition facts, I can see why it's yummy, but could be healthier.

Super yummy!!! I enjoy flavor so I made the following changes: I cooked quinoa in chicken broth instead of water, sautéed broccoli, cauliflower, onion and garlic in place of the steamed broccoli, and I probably added more cheese than the recipe called for (but didn’t measure it so not sure). It’s fantastic!

I followed someone's comment of replacing cream of mushroom with 1TBSP flour, 1TBSP melted butter in a pan, 3/4cup vegetable broth, 1/2cup milk but I doubled it as I was making a large batch (in a 9x13 pan). I used 2 crowns of broccoli. I sauteed a bunch of mushrooms (sliced, then cut the slices in half) with an onion (instead of french onions) and added it to the "cream of mushroom". I still used a cup of quinoa and thought that was a great ratio so if I made the smaller version, might use less quinoa. I didn't steam the broccoli long enough so it wasn't as tender as I would have liked it, but that was my fault. Topped with more cheddar cheese and then the french onions for a nice flavorful crunch on top. It was SO GOOOD!!! And filling! I wanted to keep eating it even though I was stuffed. My dad also liked it a lot (I made it for the two of us).

This was so easy and really yummy. A great vegetarian comfort food. I left out the Lemmon pepper but added garlic and onion powder. My husband loved it and this will definitely be one of our go-tos!!

I made this in my instant pot. So easy! I just mixed everything except the fried onions and cheese. I cooked it for 10 min on pressure cook. Once cooked and pressure released I added cheese while keeping warm then added the onions and crispy peppers when serving.

DE-LISH!!! I was tired of raw broccoli, and quinoa can be so bland. I cooked the quinoa in veggie stock. I had no cream of mushroom soup so I used the 1 tbsp of butter/1 tbsp of flour/broth/half and half that another reviewer suggested. I put in enough broth/half and half to match the can of soup. I also wasn't feeling the lemon pepper seasoning that I have so I used garlic and onion powder instead. Other than these 3 things, I made the recipe as written and I absolutely love it!  Very tasty, satisfying, and can be refrigerated and cut nicely into squares to heat up individual portions.

The recipe was easy to make, but would recommend steaming the broccoli longer.  Also used Daiya veggie cheese in lieu of real cheese.

my son is vegetarian and I am always looking for something that he can eat and the rest of the family will enjoy too.  Everyone thought this was really good and wants to have it again.  A winner.  Easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't put the oil in with the quinoa ( I forgot).  He had it as his main dish and everyone else had it as a side.

I made the recipe as directed with the exception of the French fried onions (because I didn't have any).  My family, including my very particular spouse, raved about it. They all asked when I was going to make it again WHILE we were still eating. I wish it were healthier! I would gladly take recommendations from other users on how to trim fat/animal products and sodium but in the meantime it makes a great 'once in a while' dinner.

Why do so many people change the original recipe then rate it as if they actually prepared it as written?!  It's almost an entirely different recipe now. At least give the original one a chance before you change it so drastically. This one is so good you don't need to - I left out the lemon pepper the first time because I didn't have any so now I leave it out every time I make it.

I had to omit the lemon pepper and sub in regular sautéed onion but I imagine those listed ingredients would only make this tastier and it's already a 10 in my opinion. This is an easily adaptable recipe depending on your vegetable/seasoning preferences but it is truly delicious and comforting as written.

We served this side with bbq chicken and the flavor  was a really nice compliment.  I enjoyed the pop of the quinoa as a great bit of texture not normally found in a broccoli and cheese casserole.

I was tempted to eat it before I put it in the oven!  Very versatile recipe because other vegetables could definitely be added!  I sliced in 3 small carrots and squeezed in fresh lemon juice into the soup/veggie mix before I stirred in the quinoa - so delicious and nothing overpowers.

This is my new favourite quinoa recipe!  (next to my half and half oatmeal)  Most of the recipes I tried just seem to be "quinoa with other things", where the flavor of quinoa sticks out.  This dish has a well blended flavor of its own.

My new favorite comfort food. Had to make a few adjustments since I didn't have everything on hand. So, this is what I did. Sautéed a leftover onion, roughly 1/4 c., in some butter with 2 cloves of garlic. I used 2c. frozen broccoli and 1/2c. Greek yogurt. Omitted the lemon pepper. I reserved a little bit of the cheese to throw on top for the addition 5 minute bake along with a little pinko for that crunch. If I didn't have any self restraint, this dish would be half empty.

This was GREAT!  Added a few chopped onions and an extra cup of veggies (cauliflower and carrots) and everyone loved it.  A nice change from a rice or just cheese/broccoli situation.  I did take reviewer's advice and used some chicken broth when cooking the quinoa.  I think next time I will make a cream soup substitute that is healthier and add mushrooms to the mix.  Really good base recipe - you can use any cheese or veggie combo.  Thanks!

Changes I made - used fat free, plain Greek yogurt, omitted the lemon pepper, used 4 cups of broccoli. Other than those changes, I made this exactly as written. Next time I'll leave out the salt "to taste," as the fried onions gave this dish plenty of saltiness. Otherwise, this is a great alternative to mac and cheese.

I made it with 1/2 onion mixed with dish rather than the fried onions and added a can of sliced mushrooms.  You could also top with breadcrumbs.

Yum! perfect sisr roasted red peppers and sundried tomatoes....  What a nice addition! A green salad with/balsamic to cut the gooeyness is the perfect side. A Very tasty and flexible recipe :)

Awesome. I seldom follow recipes, use them more as a guide. I made my own cream of mush soup which made it taste even better and I added a little more cheese, my kids love cheese.

Very yummy!  I did sautéed onions as the onion in the mixture instead, as others suggested, and didn't put a topping.  Didn't use lemon pepper.  Added mushrooms and garlic and extra broccoli.

I cut up and browned chicken breast in olive oil and added to this, as I wanted a dinner casserole. My hubby, who is not a big quinoa fan, loved it. My 4 & 9 year old granddaughters ate it without complaints too! That is a huge accomplishment at my house.  I used seasoned salt, no lemon pepper ( hubby not a fan of that either, didn't want to press my luck). I will definitely make this again.

Love this recipe and we eat it often.  The first time I followed exactly.  You can reduce cheese and fried onions slightly to take away some of the calories.  Also, make sure you WASH your quinoa throughly you don't want to get a gritty bite.  Great recipe!

Pretty easy, fairly healthy, and delicious!  Used broccoli-cheese condensed soup (out of cream of mushroom) and cut the cheese down a bit. Loved using quinoa instead of rice.  Might add a little more onions next time for a stronger flavor. Even the husband approves!

This is delicious. I used red quinoa, and chopped up some white onion that I sautéed with some garlic to use in it instead of the french fried onions (though I still put those--and additional cheddar--on top). I also added a little extra broccoli and omitted the lemon pepper. Excellent recipe, will make again!

This is a great recipe! Made a few changes though: didn't have fried onions, so I chopped 1 small onion and added that to the broccoli mixture. I topped it with panko bread crumbs the last 10 minutes. definitely making this again!

Excellent recipe!  Made this pretty close to as written, just a couple of sustitutions based on what I had in the pantry and we all enjoyed it very much. I can see that this will lend itself to variations in the future.  Thanks for the post!

We substituted breadcrumbs for the fried onions, au gratin cream sauce for the soup, & creme fraiche for the sour cream, also added garlic flakes. I did cook the quinoa first but not the broccoli so I kept it in the oven longer.
My husband thinks a meal w/o meat isn't a meal so he was really hesitant. This was our first dish with quinoa & we were pleasantly surprised!  This is now on our go-to dinner list! Thanks for sharing
