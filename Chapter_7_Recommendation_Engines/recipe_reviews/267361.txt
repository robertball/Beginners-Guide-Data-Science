I'm sorry, but 4.1g is hardly "high protein".... the carb/protein ratio should really be within 2:1 or 1:1 to be considered high protein and this is 8:1  These numbers are really just low-calorie  I won't bother making it.

Great chocolate muffins! And so fast and easy to make! I used a mashed banana in place of the applesauce, and that worked perfectly. I would definitely make these again! Thank you for the recipe!

9.1.18  Whoa, these are some awesome muffins, high protein (definitely an asset) or not.  One bite with those melted chips inside, and I was hooked!  I filled the muffin cups about two-thirds full and ended up with eight muffins.  They had a good rise, are extremely moist and tender, and have a very rich chocolate flavor. Only change I made was using vanilla Greek yogurt (what I had on hand). I gave each muffin a dusting of some powder sugar, but I could see sprinkling a few chocolate chips on the top of each muffin before heading into the oven to style them up even more.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, this one’s a definite keeper.

These were great for a snack or breakfast option. They had a nice chocolate flavor that was not too rich and are definitely best eaten fresh from the oven while the chocolate chips are still a little warm and gooey.  I’d make these again!

Made as listed.    Actually wasn’t too bad.   Everyone in the house was pleasantly surprised.   Has good flavor.   Not super sweet.   I will def make these again.   
The recipe doesn’t make very many at once.   My suggestion is to double the recipe.

These muffins are good but need some tweaking. The kids loved them, which is shocking for something that is pretty healthy. I made two batches, one with just chocolate chips per the recipe and one with chocolate chips and peanut butter chips. Both were good and I preferred the peanut butter addition. The only complaint is where the tweaking part comes in. The consistency was more chewy than fluffy and the muffins stuck to the wrapper, so they didn’t easily peel.

For a Chocolate Muffin with a bit extra protein, these were okay. My son gobbled them down a couple for breakfast but didn't ask for more. I did make these with Gluten Free All Purpose Flour and Vanilla Greek Yogurt. I added a few extra dark chocolate chunks on top prior to baking. The muffins were soft and moist as would be expected when using greek yogurt and applesauce. They tasted okay but left a "icky" aftertaste, I'm assuming from the protein powder.
