These cookies are addictive but I don't know about healthy! My mom used to make a version when we were kids to use up the bits and pieces left from boxes of cereal. I used less honey 1/2 cup and made numerous substitutions but keep measurements the same and they came out delicious. To make a little healthier we substituted kashi for rice cereal and flipped the amounts for the chips. Overall a fabulous treat.

A lot of substitutions and omitions - I ended up using peanut butter honey chocolate chips oatmeal and vanilla. They fulfilled the craving! I'm much more prone to the peanut butter balls with powdered milk I think the powdered milk adds a certain sweetness and texture that I like. But these are definently a go when I'm out of it like today!

I really enjoyed making the cookies. You could really taste the butterscotch. They come out really rich. Try not to put too much butterscotch. I made less cookies than the recipe said we would.

I love this recipe! It's very versatile I can substitute different combinations of granola and chips and it comes out awesome every time. I call them Energy Bites didn't think my kids would be as interested if I called them Health Balls. I make a batch almost every week great after school snack. Thanks so much!!!
