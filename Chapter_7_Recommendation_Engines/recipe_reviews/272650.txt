Be sure to chop the strawberries into the smallest strawberry bits you can make.  Large chunks of strawberries can make for soggy muffins.

banana flavour was a bit overpowering, might use slightly less next time. strawberry texture was okay, could be better. overall great!

These are fabulous and so easy!!! I used 2 medium/large bananas because that is what I had so ended up baking for 25 minutes instead of 18 to get them done but so worth the wait. My husband devoured them. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the great recipe!
