This is a fine recipe with one exception. The trick to french fries that are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside is to first soak then in cold water. Dry thouroughly. Fry TWICE...first a short fry (like blanching vegetables, but in oil), drain and then fry a second time until golden and crispy. This should give the desired results. My friends know I can't eat a soggy fry... and I love fries ;-)  )  Happy frying.

Out of curiousity, I divided my potatoes into two batches and soaked one batch in cold water only, and the other in cold water with the sugar added. I must say that the one soaked in sugar water did come out crispier. The difference in the taste was discernible at best, but you can totally tell that one was crispier than the other, so I would suggest that you use sugar as listed in the recipe. Wonderful french fries. Finally I can forget buying thosed frozen ones. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. It is a keeper.

Planned on fries tonight and decided to experiment.  Per Martha S. I've been soaking my potatoes in cold water for at least 2 hours before cooking.  I tried cold sugar water, warm sugar water and cold plain water.  There was diffinately a difference with the sugar water which my son noticed as well.  There wasn't much of a difference with warm or cold sugar water, but our preference was the cold.  It just may have been the first batch we cooked.  Will be doing the cold sugar method from now on as these were good. At first I didn't think it would work because the potatoes were crisp in the plain cold water and interestingly, the sugar water made the potates softer before cooking.

This is the way to make homemade fries as in a restaurant. It's in the sugar, guys! However... if you want them a bit crispier, here's a trick: first blanch the fries in hot oil for 2 min. Remove, let cool. Return and fry till golden brown.

Okay gang for those who think it's odd to soak them in warm water...well the warm water is merely to dissolve the sugar.  After the sugar is dissolved I add some ice and then do the soaking.  These fries are the best.  I have baked these (spraying with pam & seasoning w/ garlic salt) as well as fried them and they are always a hit.  Thanks Lorelei!

Soaking potatoes ahead in warm water with sugar worked wonders, but borrowed technique from Alton Brown by first frying at 320 deg. until potatoes just began to float, removed from oil, and drained then increased frying temperature to 375 deg for a second quick fry (watch the fries carefully - the difference between crispy fries and shoestring potatoes is just very far apart!).  Had been looking for a "perfect" french fries recipe for a long time and this one is the closest to perfect yet!

Such lovely, crispy fries! I will never use another recipe! The only change I made was that I drained my fries on a paper bag rather than paper towels; doing this makes them not as greasy.

Excellent! The sugar water really does work...I cut my fries very thin because I like them xtra crispy and making them the normal way you pretty much have to cut them very thin to get them crispy...Big mistake when using the sugar water! They were TOO crispy...I cannot wait to make these again...I will just make sure to cut them a lot thicker this time!

I was surprised by how well these fries tasted. I only ate a few (need to lose weight)but my husband inhaled the rest. He said they were the best fries he has ever had (thats a big compliment because he doesn't really like french fries). I followed directions and they came out great but instead of seasoning the fries with salt I used McCormick Grill Mates Roasted Garlic and Herb seasoning. It tasted great on the french fries. So I would suggest instead of just using plain salt on your fries, go to your spice rack and pick out a nice spice mix to put on your french fries. Seasoning salt tastes good too.

I made two kinds of fries tonight to go with our fish dinner. These by far are "THE BEST" fries - homemade or otherwise! My family loved them!! Crispy outside-soft inside! Whenever I'm in the mood for "fried" fries - this is the recipe I'll use! Thanks!

White Vinegar works like the sugar does, it pulls out the carbs so they can get crispy.  Put a couple capfulls in the water, enough to just smell it, and you won't taste it after you fry.

I have not tried this, but in the 60's I was a fry cooker at McDonalds. We would cut, wash, (3 times) and then blanch them. (325 degrees) After they were blanched, we would let them cool, then refry them at 375 degrees til golden brown. The secret was in washing them, and drying them. The bottom of our sinks were covered with starch, and thats what we tried to get rid of. After three washes, there was little or no starch left.

This is my go to recipe for homemade french fries. I usually soak in sugar water for at least 1/2 an hour or overnight in refrigerator (water should be clear) and then drain and absorb as much of the water on a reusable drying mat and allow to dry as much as possible. I keep one just for these fries.  Always do a long fry (about 6-10 minutes depending on how thick your potatoes are cut- we prefer large wedges) and then just before you're ready to serve, refry till golden brown, about 2 minutes. not sure if it matters whether you do long or short fry first, but the long fry first makes most sense if you're doing fish AND chips.  I've done both with great results.  Prefrying the potatoes ahead of time helps speed up dinner time. Perfect and delicious every time! I cook for 5 hungry kids so anything I can do ahead helps. 
To save paper towel, line a large platter with folded newspaper under a of couple of pieces of paper towel.
Also, a large cast iron pot for frying is best. You can sustain the temperature of the oil better and fry larger and fewer batches. 

For those wondering what to do with the leftover oil, let it cool, strain or pour into a covered container and store in the fridge for your next time you need to deep fry something. I find reused oil actually makes the food taste better and it browns the food better as well. I add fresh oil to top up because you will lose some each time you fry and you have to get rid of the brown bits which causes the oil to go rancid.

This is the secret to the perfect french fry.

1)soak overnight in cold water with 2 tablespoons white sugar.
2)Dry with paper towel
3)blanch in vegetable oil with burner on medium until just before they turn brown - then remove to paper towel.
4)Turn burners to high and cook until fries reach your desired brown hue.
5)Enjoy the deliciousness

OK, I see alot of great reviews. Today I experimented with different temperatures and thickness of potatoes. I must be doing something wrong. My fries either came out soggy or soggy and dark. If I kept my temperature at 365 they would burn before the cooked inside. If I lowered the temp. they would be soggy. Please Help!

Another trick for draining is to use a cooling rack over paper towel or cookie sheet. I do this anytime I deep fry! It really works!

the two key things here are the sugar water and cooking twice!!! I will admit i was skeptical especially when i saw how soggy the potatos were out of the sugar water and then after they cooled from being in the oil after dipping the first time. but they came out perfectly crispy after the second dip in the oil for a few more minutes.  One other note...if you've tried french frying potatoes at home you know that cooking them takes forever..this method speeds it up greatly we did two batches in less time than it normally took one.  good recipe..finally good fresh cut fries at home!!!

I dissolved the sugar in the water, and then put a few ice cubes in with the potatoes, as per others' reviews. I let them soak in the fridge for a few hours before first blanching them in oil, and then doing a fry. They were great!

The sugar really does make all the difference!  You do need to fry twice though.  About 2 or 3 min the first time and let them cool.  Then fry them again till golden.

How have I never known that fries should be soaked in cold water prior to frying? I stopped making homemade fries years ago cause they would always be soggy. I knew I was doing something wrong but had no idea what..till today. I soaked them in cold sugared water for 2 hours,dried then fried. They were perfectly crisp outside,perfectly golden brown, none burned and they were absolutely delicious.I will NEVER buy those frozen fries again!

I did the quick fry and then a second fry. Delicious.  My husband and I both thought they were as good as Five Guys or better. I used red potatoes.  My mother always soaked her french fries in ice water before frying to get them crispy.  The sugar water lends a sweet flavor to go with lightly salted fries.

If you are looking for fries that taste like the street vendors or a steak sandwich place these are it. They are slightly crispy on the outside but very soft on the inside. Make sure to use the large "russet" potatoes as suggested. They are the best for baked potatoes and fries. The fries are actually quite easy to make to. I just fried them in my mini deep fryer one batch at a time. The timing is very precise to about 5-6 minutes per batch. Make sure to have a salad or something else, because these are hard to quit eating.

I followed MarylandGirl's advice and fried my potatoes twice.  Since I don't have a deep fryer, I just used a heavy saucepan and set the heat to medium and fried/blanched for about 3 minutes, drained, and cooled.  I then increased the temperature of the oil by turning up the heat to med-hi and fried a second time, 3-4 minutes.  The sugar solution is a great trick, only I used ice cold water and soaked for almost 30 minutes.  I will use this recipe and technique again.  Thank you all for sharing =)

I have tried endless times to make home made french fries and they never get close to crispy!  This sugar trick definitely works and I also think you need to make sure the potatos are thoroughly dried with paper towels.  We double fried them in the deep fryer which made them perfect!  So many great tips on this site!  Glad I am a member.

I doubled the recipe and followed the suggestion of frying twice.  I soaked the potatoes in the warm sugar water.  Dried fully and then put in the fridge until I was ready to fry them.  Fried them in a fry daddy for 1-2 minutes and did all potatoes.  Then went back through and refried for 2-3 minutes or until golden.  Salted and put in oven on 175 degrees to keep warm.  These turned out great.  The taste was really good and they were a little crispy and soft on the inside.  Will make these again.

I really liked the soaking in sugar water. I was able to cut & prepare these way ahead of time. And when fried, they came out crispy & good. I added some seasoning when they came out of fryer.

Terrific. Customize seasoning to preference. I like to add chili powder and seasoning salt for something with a burst. But still great as written.

My difference, I double fried mine, like Paula does, and I see from the reviews that Alton does also (I only recently started watching him) I also saw a tip in one of the reviews to use the salad spinner to drain the water. How clever! I forget about that little spinning wonder sometimes.

These french fries taste just like New York Fries!! I like to spice them up with a little bit of paprika and cumin rather than salt! So yummy! I have made these over and over again!

The sugar solution is great. For the first time, my wife has loved home cooked fries. I fried them twice though. Froze them between fryings. That seems to make them more crispy on the outside while keeping the inside soft. The kids like them better than at the "M" place! Thanks for the idea!

These were delicious. My whole family loved them. Quick and simple and a great side for lots of dishes. We added salt, pepper, chili and garlic powder to them for flavor (I add that to all the fries we cook). Will definitely make again!

I've always soaked potatoes in ice water before frying them to make them crispier on the outside and creamier on the inside - but the addition of the sugar really helps!  Try sprinkling a little lemon juice over the potatoes and stirring them as soon as they come out of the fat.  The lemon juice seems to turn a little sweet, and really flavors the potatoes.

Dragged out the old Frydaddy the wife hasn't used in years.  Perfection on the first try! Combined a couple tips from other reviewers to make the process go smooth and easy.  Tossed the potatoes in the water and put the bowl in the refrig for about forty minutes and used a salad spinner to save on paper towels. Drained the finished product on a paper towels on top of newspaper.  Thank you Lorelei.

The sugar makes the difference, but if you really want to make the best fries, fry them in beef tallow.  That's what made MacDonald's fries taste so special before they caved in to extremists in 1990. Lard is almost as good and readily available.

I soaked mine in cold water to remove the starch.  Fried twice (first to blanch, then to crisp) and skipped the sugar solution.  Also, I only used 1 cup of vegetable oil.  They turned out wonderfully!

Thse fries turned out terrible for me. I do better off when I don't soak the potatoes. Maybe I didn't use enough sugar in the water but I will not be trying these again. The time it takes for the potatoes to sit is the deterrent for me. My 4yr who adores fries wouldn't eat them.

Really good!  My family liked these better than the frozen type.  I took some other reviewers suggestions and fried 2 min. in 375 oil; allowed to cool for about 10 min. then put back in the fyer for an additional 5+ min.  A keeper!

I tried this with making homemade hashbrowns this morning. After chopping up the potatoes, I let them soak in the sugar water solution. By far the best fried potatoes I have ever had. I will be buying frozen potatoes NO more! Brown and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! Perfect! Worth the effort!

I really liked these, you have to cook them longer that suggested, and the trick is to cut them thin. I also fried them twice as suggested, and kept them in the oven on a rack to keep warm, the longer they were in there the more crisp they got.

My whole family really liked these fries. HOWEVER, for me they took forever and a day to cook. Fortunately I had horribly misjudged the time the entree was going to be done, so I was able to leave these in longer. Maybe 3x longer. BUT it could be that I had my potatoes cut much larger than the person who submitted this recipe did. So basically, the larger the cut, the longer the cooking time. The only ones that got crunchy were the little pieces, but that was ok. They really tasted like steakhouse fries. They were very good. My daughter (6 yr) has requested that I make these everynight. Ya right, like that's gonna happen. =  )

Delicious. I had to make fries for more than 2 people so I doubled everything. Water sugar and potatoes. I soaked the potatoes for about 2 hours and then drained them and dried them a bit with a towel. I went with the hint of blanching them for a few minutes and then pulled them out of the oil. Once all the batches were done I could quickly get them crispy and brown. This took about 3 to 5 minutes per batch for the amount I Deep fried. They were so good my husband said that if there had been a five gallon pail full he would have still ate everything there. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I agree With another poster that the warm water is used to dissolve the sugar. I did this with one cup of warm water and then added the rest of the water as cold. I also put a layer of ice cubes over the potatoes as they were soaking. Then when it was time to take them out they were nice and cold.

These fries rock!! I had planned on making them last night, but after peeling, cutting and soaking in the sugar bath-our dining plans changed.  So.... they held in the sugar bath in the fridge till tonight. Patted them dry, fried them up, salted them and polished them all off!  I even greatly increased the amounts of potatoes but my family of 5 did not even leave a spud rubble!  I am a believer in the sugar bath now!  Thanks for a great recipe!  (Oh, and I cut them quite thick-they were better than the county fair fries!)  Yum!

I haven't exactly used this recipe but it's just like the one my Mom passed down to me 40 years ago and with a little tweaking I made it my own and it's just like this one so I know this is worth 5 stars. ?? I find using vegetable oil like this recipe calls for is the best. I use it too. It's light and not heavy like olive oils and others can be. I also use a Westmark Potato Slicer and set it to make the fries thin like Mc Donald's fries except I leave the potato peel on. Mc Donald's removes the peel. The real secret is the sugar water. Trust me you will not get fries that taste sweet! Not in the least bit! In my 40 years of making them I have yet to be able to put my finger on exactly what the sugar does but I think it helps keep the fries light and not oily, fry up crisp and taste absolutely perfect! This recipe is worth all 5 stars and more!

I wanted this to work so badly. Recipe as written did not give me crunchy french fries. Recipe as modified by others (2 minutes in oil, then remove, then the final 5 minutes or so) also did not give me the french fry of my dreams. Could be my potatoes, could be operator error, not sure. I'll try again.

Okay, so my cooking skills are sub-par to say the least, but this is by far the most amazing thing I have ever made with my own two hands in my entire life. These french fries are pure bliss. On par with my all time favorite McDonald's fries. Thank you!

Soaking the potatoes in water- sugered or otherwise removes some of the starch which is why they get crispy- less gummy starch.  The twice fry method helps also.

I tried these last night.. great recipe!   I soaked them for about an hour. Drained well, then layed them out on a towel while the oil heated (used Canola oil). I blanch fried them and it worked perfectly! Light, crispy fries.   I didn't get an overly sweet taste.. just clean potato taste came through

Pretty good fries but be sure to cut the potatoes the correct size as the larger ones would not crisp up.

Really good! I baked mine ( trying to cut down on the fat n calories from deep frying) and they still turned out great!!!! I can only imagine what these would taste like if I were to actually fry them!  The only thing I did different as far as the recipe was I did cold soak them before since I had cut the potato's in advance. Then did the warm water with sugar! WONDERFUL!!!

Good recipe--although the cooking time seemed a little short to me.  At 5 or 6 minutes, these were still pretty "pale" in color.  I fried mine for more like 8-9 minutes with excellent results.

A great way to make fries. We had always done the short fry kind of like a blanching, but we had never tried with the sugar, this works great! I dissolved the sugar in warm water then cooled it off with ice. I will make fries like this from now on.

Made these for Thanksgiving for the picky grandkids.  After I finished frying them my grand-daughter requested I fry hers a little more crispier so being the grandma I am I did.  I noticed in doing this they turned golden brown and nice.  They were good originally but better after second fry.  I seasoned them with Lawry's Ranch Flavored French Fry Seasoning.  Some of the adults could not help themselves and said they were delicious and tasted like Red Robin restaurant fries. All and all a good recipe.

mmmmmmmmmmmmm. I've made these 4 or 5 times and they are always great. I usually dissolve the sugar in warm water then add ice cubes to cool it down before I soak the potatoes and I fry them for 2 minutes, take them out and then fry them for another 6 or so minutes and they are perfect. Better than McDonalds. :)

These are the best, very similar to McDonals's fries. My family loved them and want to know when we will have them again.

Worked like a charm! Kept the fries lighter and crispier than ordinary frying. Must have been a chemist that figured this one out.

Very good. I ran out of time so they didn't dry completely, but they were still good. I probably should have cooked them a bit longer, also. I will use this recipe again. Very good!!

Great french fries!! Better then the frozen, and better then the fast food fries. I followed the recommendation of another reviewer, and blanched in hot oil for 2 minutes, then drained for 1 minute and back in the oil for 5 minutes. Came out crispy and golden brown!

Wow.  I'll never buy bag fries again.  I actually kept the skin on them and cut them like silver dollars.  There's this diner that we love that cuts them like that.  I didn't have vegetable oil so used canola.  They did take a little longer to cook probably because of how I cut them.  I don't have a fryer, so used a sauce pan on my stove med-high as the other reviewer suggested.

Perfection!!!

I don't have a deep-fryer, but using a medium-sized pot with oil heated on medium high worked perfectly.  I fried mine until they were turning golden brown; they were only slightly crispy, but we like them better soft so they were perfect.  Can't wait to try this recipe with sweet potatoes! Thanks.

The sugar has to be the trick here because I have never achieved the crispness that these fries have.  I did cook a bit longer, probably about 10-11 minutes.

Wonderful potatoes! My husband loved these too! Super easy to make. I used nature's seasoning for the seasoning and it was very good. 6 cups wasn't enough to cover the fries in my deep frier, so make sure you check to make sure they are covered before you start your timer. Thanks so much Lorelei!

Amazing fries!!!! No need to go out and get fast food fries after you've tried this recipe. I tried it today. I went with the cold water 1/3 cup sugar instead of the warm and had the time to let them soak for 2 hours. I cooked them in two batches, the first was cooked twice around 2 1/2 min each time and the second was cooked 5 min straight up. The first batch came out extremely crisp, had that perfect light brown color and tasted fantastic, the 2nd batch came out a bit lighter but were just as good, I had no preferences between the two.. I WILL make these again and again and keep them as a staple in my household for years to come. Thank you for this recipe :)

It worked for what I needed - something to fill a french fry craving when there were no frozen ones in the house.  However, they were kind of soggy.  They tasted good, if a little oddly sweet, but they seemed to get soggier the longer they cooked.  I may try the ice cubes in the water, or the hot oil blanching suggested by others if I try this again.

I have tried the sugar water method before, did not notice any difference than just using cold water. I am a fan of Good Eats, and agree with Alton Brown's method of twice frying. I also use his method of starch conversion for hashbrowns. Placing them in a cold environment (in the fridge) over night. I still soak my fries, but i use salt water , then rinse, and a finally use a salad spinner to help dry them. 

I then use my fryer at 320F and fry for 5 minutes, drain on paper towels, and cool until close to room temperature. Then i fry again at 350F until golden and crisp.

The trick to crispy and less greasy French fries are to cook them twice as stated by others.  I then dry the fries on paper towels over newspapers or paper bags...they absorb the grease better & fries are nice & crispy.

First of all, the fries turned out great.
Here are a few changes I made:
-I peeled, cut and soaked 15 potatoes (our whole family LOVES fries.)
-I fried them 2 times.
-I kept them warm in a warm oven while fixing the rest of supper.
-not ALL of them were crispy, but they were all nicely browned & none were soggy. (This is the way the family likes them. : )  )
-And I plan to reuse the oil tonight to fry breaded fish!  (Good recipe & no waste!) Thank you for such a good recipe!

A lot of our fries were soggy and not very crispy.  If I make these again, will turn the fryer down to 350 degrees.  Served with spicy fry sauce from this site.

These were good!  I'm used to getting crunchy fries only from blanching and frying twice.  They are delicious but they usually require more time than I am willing to dedicate to french fries.  These were great--soak in the sugar water and drain and then fry...they get crispy quick and are ready by the time the burgers are done!

VERY tasty! You get a slight sugary taste (obviously), but with enough salt, you are good to go! ;)

This is the best recipe for french fries ever!  They take some effort to make but they are well worth it.  The sugar solution makes these fries sweet and delicious.  I always sprinkle generously with cheese before serving - perfection!

Amazing how much crispier they get in the sugar water solution. I made this for my family with beer battered fish, and the fresh cut fries really stole the show. My mom wanted more, and quickly so she ignored my advice about soaking the potatoes and threw them in the oil right after cutting. They turned out terribly soggy, and no where near as good as the first batch.  Anyway, like others have pointed out, the fries do not have a noticably sweeter flavour, just a very crispy outside.

Making these right now and they are very good. I seasoned with seasoned salt as soon as they came out of the fryer. I think the key to frying anything is the right temp of the oil, using fresh oil and not overcrowding the pan. And I did fry these a bit longer than 6 minutes. The first batch came out kind of soggy even though they were cooked on the inside.

I soaked for 1 hour in cold water with the sugar.  Fried in my Fry Daddy and they were PERFECT!  I'll use this method from now on, they weren't greasy at all and so much cheaper than store bought fries.

These were very good. I never heard of soaking your potatoes in sugar. But from here on out this will be the way we make our fries. They definitely ended up much more crispier than they normally do. Thanks for this tip.

None of us cared for these at all. They didn't get crisp at all, so it wasn't worth adding sugar to an already super starchy food.

Really made a difference!  I dissolved the sugar in about two TBS of warm water, then filled it the rest of the way with cold water.  They really used less oil! I was very pleasantly suprised.

Been doing this for years! I guess I never considered it a recipe:) The only thing I do different is soak the potatoes for an hour instead of 15 mins. Also we always use more like 6 potatoes  because 2 just doesn't make enough. Of course that means more water and more sugar:) Thanks for sharing!

I tried this with butternut squash last night and it worked like a charm!  The squash didn't crisp like a potato would, but they weren't full of grease either. I'm giving it 4 stars until I try it with potatoes.

Very good, I soak mine in cold ice water for at least an hour, and then do the double-fry method.  When finished I usually season the with Seasoned Salt.

These were really, really yummy! I will make these every time that I make homemade fries. I did make one mistake, I substituted canola oil for the vegetable oil, trying to make a healthier fry. They were good, really, but I think they would have been crispier and would have stayed crispy longer had I used the vegetable oil. Still, I could not stop eating these. I made meatball sub sandwiches and these fries were the perfect addition to this meal.

Used the mandolin to make "McDonalds" sized fries. Made the sugar water up in advance and then chilled it. They turned out great! In the past, to get fries like these, I had to parboil or double fry the potatoes (which both are really a pain).  For all of you that added that extra step, you might give the recipe a go as written, it will save you alot of time.  By the way, the cooking time was right on for the size of fries I used.

Thank you so much for this idea! These had a nice crisp edge to them, but a soft center... my favorite! I should've done them in two batches, though. It took a long time for them to brown, and they didn't do so uniformally. We sprinkled these with salt, pepper, Old Bay and garlic powder. Delicious!

Very good french fries. Never heard of soaking in the sugar solution, but it works.

I could definitely tell a difference by soaking them in the sugar solution, but they still weren't as crispy as I wanted... They were still very good, though. Thanks.

Great french fries. I cut the potatoes on my mandoline. fried them all twice. first for 2 minutes, then until golden brown. I did double the recipe and we were  still a little short for five people. Next time I will cut suger in half. They were very good, but a fuzz too sweet.

I also did not use the sugar. I used a fryer, fried for a couple of minutes.  Took out, drained on paper towels till cool.  Then deep fried again.  Sprinkled with salt.  To Good.  If using a skillet do not fill past half way mark.  Great post.

There really is no reason to add sugar to the potatoes.  I did as another reviewer suggested and fried the potatoes in a deep fryer, took them out, drained on paper towels and then fried them again.  Sure enough, they were crisp the second time!

This recipe was perfect! My french fries definitely turned out crispy and yummy!  I used the Pampered Chef Ultimate Slice and Grate and used the julienne blade which made for skinny fries, but we like them that way! I think that the size of them helped in the crispiness of them.  Make sure to salt immediately after they are done.  I used a deep fryer and they were done in about 5-7 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were ok. Like another user stated, they took FOREVER to cook. Most of mine did not get crunchy either. I will probably just soak them in plain water next time. ***Update 8/16/2011 - made them again, I don't know what I did differently this time but they turned out wonderful. (I think I let them soak for a half an hour - maybe that was it? ) Thanks for the recipe!

I'm giving these a 2, not because they taste bad, but because I really didn't see how soaking the potatoes in sugar water really helped.  They tasted fine, but I really have had better results just soaking my potatoes in cold water(no sugar) then frying.  Mine didn't get crispy like other reviewers stated theirs did.  I won't use up the unneccessary sugar next time.

I only soaked them for 13.5 minutes, but they didn't get very crisp.  Soggy, rather.  I tried cooking them longer than recommended, probably 10 minutes, but they were still soggy.

I followed the recipe, and cooked it the time specified.  I was using my deep fryer outside, and unfortunately, it was not very well lit area.  I didn't want the fries overcooked, so brought them in after 5-1/2 minutes.  They were fully cooked through, but not at all crispy.  My fault for not getting a better light.  I will use this recipe again, but adjust cooking time.

Didn't need that much oil for frying. Needed to cook longer than 5-6 minutes but maybe the oil just hadn't gotten quite up to temperature yet.

Previously I had mediocre results with my french fries. Then I saw the curing in sugar instead of vinegar. Then I read the McDonald's recipe and wasn't crazy about the addition of corn syrup on top of the sugar. I read this recipe and wasn't surprised that users weren't getting stellar results from the absence of blanching. So, going along with Cindy Chaney's knowledge and my failures I used only enough hot water to completely dissolve the sugar then added the rest cold water and set in the fridge for the 15 minutes. Removed and patted dry and returned to the fridge while my oil heated to 375. I then blanched the potatoes for exactly 2 minutes. Removed and patted dry. During that time my fryer was able to recover it's 375 temp so that 6 more minutes made perfect, restaurant style french fries. And didn't taste the sugar at all! I gave this recipe 5 stars because with mine and Cindy's knowledge of french making, I've finally come up with a recipe that makes stiff fries without having to over cook them to get restaurant texture french fries.

This recipe is excellent.  I'd like to add that you can substitute salt or soda for the sugar.  What actually transpires when you soak the potatoes in the sugar/salt/soda water is that the water is more dense with the additive.  Water tends to move from an area of less concentration to an area of greater concentration.   In other words, the water is somewhat leeched out of the potatoes to try to equate the amount of water between the two.  When fried, that will make the potatoes crispier because there is less water.

Great technique!  My fries came out more crispy after soaking in sugar water for 15 mins.   I suggest spin in salad spinner then use paper towels to remove excess water.   Also for extra crunch I fry for 2 mins then remove, let cool for 10 mins then fry second time like others have suggested.   I also use the deep fryer for even cooking.

These were great!! I didn't have a deep fritter so i used a deep stock pot, before adding the pre soaked fries to the pour i seasoned them with onion powder and accent salt,i also left the skin on because i just love the taste of thick steak fries and potato skins.

My family loved them!
The soaking in the sugar solution did wonders, but I borrowed Chef John's tip and fried them twice, first to soften, then a second time to make them crisp. Lovely, crispy, delicious.
Definitely one for the ages!

Dee..Lish...Us!!!!!
I made a batch of these to try them out before making them for dinner.  I cut mine into Cottage Fries though.  I left a few out after the first fry to try the double fry.  The first ones were soo good though.  Can't wait to try the second ones and will definitely be making these for dinner tonight!!

WOW.  These fries are incredible.  The 2 minute blanching is one of the keys to make them perfect.

This recipe is perfect! The only thing that I changed is I cut my potatoes Julianne style. They turned out deliciously crispy, almost just like at McDonald's! My hubby loved them too.

Such great fries! Have to get the oil hot hot hot! Then they will crisp up nicely! I blanch mine in the boiling sugar water first, and will try the second fry next time. It might be great to fry a big batch, then freeze what we don't need for the night and have our own frozen fries for quick meals.

Surprising how wonderful these fries are!  I highly recommend it and do not skip the sugar soak - I agree with other chef it is the difference in the crispiness

Very pleased with this recipe. Simple and delicious. Imparts a slightly sweet taste to fries. Will definitely make again. 
I made a larger batch and used less oil by frying in deep non-stick skillet rather than deep fryer.

Great recipe. I was skeptical at first but greatly surprised when they turned out perfect. Even my kids loved them and they are teenagers who are very picky about their french fries. I tossed the fries with seasoning salt and pepper before frying. Delicious!!

As a true french fry artist knows, to get them crispy, you need to cook them half way, take them out and let cool down, then plunge them in the rest of the way. Older potatoes work better.

These didn't turn out very crispy for me.  I followed the recipe, but for some reason they still came out limp.  I was bummed because I love love love french fries and I really hoped to be able to make them at home instead of buying bagged ones.  Oh well.

I doubled this, since my family size is large. It was really a good, simple recipe! We could taste a bit of the sugar but it made them yummy. My family love them and ask for more! I will make this again. Thanks so much for sharing! :)

My husband has hated homemade fries for the 40 years we have been married. I made these tonight and he loved them. They were crisp and not at all greasy. A real winner and so easy. Who would think soaking them in sugar would change how they fry. Makes me wonder what else this might work on.

These are easy to make and do turn out firm.  I do wish I had a fry daddy so I could set a temperature, as for now I have to test one fry then adjust the heat till one comes out right.

While these are good, I really didn't notice much different between them and the fries we already make.  We don't soak ours at all...merely cut washed potatoes into fries, dry them off and put them in the deep fryer and they come out crispy and good.  While I wouldn't use the recipe again, it's not because I didn't like it, per se....I just didn't see any difference in the finished product.

These were so good.  My husband and kids said they  were as good as In n Out.  I didn't have vegetable oil so I just used peanut oil.  I'll never buy another bag of frozen fries!

I really didn't notice a significant difference in frying time because they were soaked first or that they were any crispier than just frying them normally.  But we do love fries!!!  Thanks for sharing

Not being able to eat french fries at most restaurants because they are either coated in flour or cooked in the same grease as other breaded things, I have been searching for a way to make crispy fries at home.  This is it!  I am so happy to finally be able to enjoy fries every once in a while again!  Thank you for the recipe, I'll be sharing it with my whole family.

My husband loved the flavor.  However, I was unable to determine if my oil was hot enough. Therefore, not quite crispy but that is due to my skills and not a reflection on the recipe.

Not sure if we did not let them cook long enough or what but they where not that crisp. Not bad but not great.

these are the money makers for sure!  I've been making these for a while now and allways had an empty basket when done.   I found that if your let them sit in the solution longer the fries get sweeter!

I love french fries! My sister hates them, and neither of us could get enough of theese. * Like some of the other women, I used warm water to dissolve the sugar, but let it cool before I added the potatoes.

I can't bring myself to rate this less then 5 stars til I have prepared it correctly.  Mine turned out very flimsy and I realized that I had not dried the potatoes after soaking like I was supposed to.  Will try again soon and rate again.  The flavor was perfect BTW or I wouldn't even be willing to try again.  I can't wait to see if I get crispy fries.

These are outstanding!  I have made these many times over and my family always gobbles them up.  My son even said they are better than any restaurant french fry he has had!  I took another reviewers suggestion and blanched them but other than that I followed the recipe to a tee.

if you don't dry it well enough the oil wil pour out of the deep fryer.  I don't know if the sugar is  what makes it crispy.  I had to double fry mine.

These were great!  I did take a few changes from prior reviews.  I mixed the sugar water, making sure the sugar was completely dissolved, in the morning. Then I refrigerated it, so it would be cold.  I also fried them twice, as many suggested, and they crisped up beautifully.  Very very good.  Thanks!

These are very good. Soaking the potatoes in the sugar water adds a sweetness to the potatoes that is delicious.

Not too bad for my first attempt at home-made fries.  I'm not sure if it was the recipe or if it was me, but something needs a little work.
