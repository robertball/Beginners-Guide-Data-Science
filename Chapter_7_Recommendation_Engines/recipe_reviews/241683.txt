This recipe has AWESOME flavor. I loved the anise. (I added a bit of plain tomato sauce just because I didn't want it so thick, but that was just a personal preference.) SO GOOD! Thank you for sharing! =)

We really enjoyed this recipe. It has a different flavour as described but it is traditional enough to please a family of Italians. I'm not a fan of anise flavour but it works here. The shining aspect of this sauce is the consistency. The ratios and type of ingredients produce a thick sauce perfect for clinging to pasta or to use in lasagne or other recipes because it doesn't drip. This is definitely a keeper recipe.

This sauce is okay; nothing extraordinary about it.  I did forget to put the tablespoon of sugar, so that's possibly why! LOL

This is delicious, and just so easy. Even easier if you use a jar of spaghetti sauce and extras if you want. Making it in the slow cooker makes it turn out rather like a ragu, and you donâ€™t have to have the oven on for hours. Thanks for the recipe.

This is not as spicy as I would prefer but very much to my husbands taste.   Hearty and filling.  Would make it again for sure.

This is a very flavorful recipe.  Easy to make, I had everything on hand, in fact I doubled the recipe so I would have some to freeze. I choose to make this meatless. Which is a nice option. This is a thick sauce.  I prefer a little smoother texture so I might add a little red wine to thin it out.  Will definitely make this again.
