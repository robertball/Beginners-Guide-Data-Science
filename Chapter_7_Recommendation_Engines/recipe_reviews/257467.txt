This is perfect for those Bloody Mary  mornings.  Next time I will add some crushed red pepper flakes.

Well...I didn't make this exact recipe but I have used spaghetti in frittatas for decades.   Whenever I have leftover spaghetti, I love rewarming the spaghetti in a skillet and after it is warm, I'll add  the eggs.  I prefer to keep the spaghetti in the center most part of the skillet so it is surrounded by the eggs.  When it is cooked on the bottom, rather than trying to flip it (the eggs are usually still a bit too runny on top to make this an easy flip), I finish it in a pre-heated oven.  That way, the frittata puffs up somewhat and is cooked all the way through.  Make sure you use a skillet that has a bake-proof handle.

I made this for breakfast and all I can say is....yum! I used angel hair instead of spaghetti and added chopped garlic and a chopped Serrano pepper. Easy to make and a great dish for brunch or lunch or dinner or anytime. Can't wait to make this for my grandkids, I know they will love it.

I'm always looking for unique recipes to use up my girls eggs and this was perfect for that. There is a lot of flavor yet the eggs stay the star of the show just as they should. I was also impressed by how well the leftovers reheated. This is a great recipe and one that is sure to impress your guests!

This tasted fantastic! I had a problem getting it to set up though and it didn't fully release onto the plate making this more like egg spaghetti, but it was delicious nonetheless and my son loved it, which is awesome since he doesn't love veggies. He ate this with no problem though. I think I would need to play around with the cooking times and probably use a different pan next time, but there will be a next time!

This recipe was easy to make and kid friendly, although they were a little puzzled at first by the pasta/egg combo.

I made this for a light super recently. It was a perfect light meal on a warm summer evening. I used angel hair pasta instead of spaghetti simply because I prefer it. We enjoyed it and I will make it again.

Followed the recipe exactly.  It was very bland and dry, but has potential to be great if I personalize it.  I'm going to try it again but maybe add a Mexican flare to it!

Made this for a friends family.  She is vegetarian, her husband and young kids are not.  They LOVED it!!  They said it was my best attempt so far to find something they all liked! Made it as directed, but added a little canned corn when I added the peas.
