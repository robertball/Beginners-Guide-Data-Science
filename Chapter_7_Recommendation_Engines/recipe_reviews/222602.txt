Pretty tasty - much healthier than frying. Next time I would leave the sugar out - it made the filling just a tad too sweet for me. I might add a little fresh ginger along with the garlic. Mine took about 20 minutes - turning after 10 minutes. Keep an eye on them - they can go from just right to too brown in moments. Thanks for the recipe Elle.

Great basic recipe--
 I was pleasantly surprised with the results of oven frying in this recipe. However I preferred to skip the cans and use fresh ingredients such as grated cabbage and bean sprouts. Instead of sugar, I used a bit of sweet chili sauce. I also made a dipping sauce of soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds and sweet chili sauce and we enjoyed these for the main meal. Thanks!

Taste much better than deep fried. I ledt out the sugar and brushed the tops with olive oil mixed with a little fresh ginger. Sprinkled with sesame seeds. YUM

I was uncertain about bell pepper, and brown sugar, in egg rolls.  My instinct was correct, they were the strangest tasting egg rolls ever.  Second time I omitted both ingredients, added napa cabbage and thinly sliced snow peapods.  Also a small amount of Five Spice powder replaced the cayenne.  The trick is to let the filling cool almost completely before trying to fill the wrappers.  Doing it when it is still hot makes the wrapper get soggy.

I tweaked this quite a bit on everything but the sauce. I used a Rainbow bagged salad with what I thought was shredded cabbage, red cabbage, broccoli, and carrots. It was actually shredded cauliflower, red cabbage, carrots, and broccoli florets. Oh well, still put it in there. No sprouts or chestnuts(forgot them at the store). I also used roasted peppers. This is the same as the TOH recipe I always used, and I still love it! So easy and tasty for a quick meal. I made a mayo, coarse mustard, and dijon dipping sauce for it. Thanks for the recipe!

These were terrific.  Love baking them instead of frying.  The filling adapts well to changes.  For example, I used a bag of "coleslaw mix" (shredded cabbage with some carrots) instead of bean sprouts and water chestnuts.  I saut√©ed the cabbage mix with onions, mushrooms and seasonings.  Added shredded leftover chicken.  Think this would work well with sausage, pork, even hamburger.  I added just a bit of sesame oil to the cornstarch mixture.  Lots of room for personal tastes without losing the intent of the original recipe.  I did use the cooking spray and my Silpat sheet.  Would like to try brushing on some peanut oil instead.  Did not add the sugar, since we served with sweet and sour sauce.  Thanks!

We enjoyed the idea of baking these instead of frying for a healthier version.  Egg Roll filling always reminds me of soup... add whatever you like or what you have on hand.  I did skip the sugar; added some finely shredded cabbage, fresh grated ginger, bamboo shoots, and bean threads instead of bean sprouts.  Turned them over half way thru baking, watch the timing.  Served these with homemade Plum Sauce from this site. These made a very nice, tasty meal for Chinese New Year. Thanks for sharing, HoneyBooBoo.  This is a keeper

This was my first time making egg rolls and I like the baking idea.  However, I didn't care for the filling.  It tasted like carrots and that's about all.  Will check other recipes.

I chose this recipe for the method as I wanted to make egg rolls but did not have a deep fryer. For the filling I used 1 bag of coleslaw mix, 8 mushrooms, 2 green onions, 2 cloves of garlic minced, 1 tsp minced ginger, 1 tbsp soya sauce and barbequed pork finely diced. I flipped them half way through and sprayed to make crispy both sides, 14 minutes was perfec. This made 18 egg rolls which I served with plum sauce that I added Sambal Oleck to to make spicier.

I tried this recipe for girls night an it was such a great choice! It's become a favourite amongst my family and friends. We made the recipe with spring roll wrappers instead of egg roll wrappers and it made almost 40 spring rolls. I also made them with fresh ingredients as well, I thought it might be a little better. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Really good!  I did substitute the chicken with salmon and I added shredded green cabbage.  Next time I think I will just have them be veggie egg rolls.

These were just ok.  Family wasn't in love with them.  The filling was good, but the wrapper was too chewy.

I had to make substitutions because of dietary issues. No peppers, water chestnuts, or sugar and I had to use rice wraps. The filling was a nice consistency with a good crunch.  Rice wraps do not do the filling justice unfortunately.

I changed some of the ingredients. I used broccoli slaw, which has all of the vegetables you need already cut perfectly. I added shrimp instead of chicken and used Old Bay seasoning, black pepper and salt for seasoning. I don't like soy sauce so I used worchester sauce with water instead. I saut√©ed the veggies and baked the shrimp with the seasoning on them until they were firm. Put both mixtures together and put them in the frog to cool for an hour. Then wrapped them in the wrappers. Ended up making 6 egg rolls. Came out great but I'll add more seasoning so they can be a bit spicer and I'll include the chili pepper. They needed the kick.

Made twice, both times used the coleslaw mix and sliced up water chestnuts, added chicken the first time but it was too much so the next time left it out, was better without.

I made these vegetarian without the chicken and used all fresh vegetables.  Omitted the sugar and made a light dipping sauce like Jan suggested.  Very good!

Loved this idea, but while I didn't have an issue with the filling as written or tweeked to personal tastes as I tried several variations.  We just couldn't get past the taste/texture of the baked eggroll wrapper.  Great idea just wasn't for us

Disclaimer: I am only rating the sauce. It went perfect with the ingredients I used for the filling! I used white sugar instead of brown and flour instead of cornstarch since it was all I had. The filling stayed together nicely and was neither too sweet nor too salty (which is usually my problem making Asian food). Thank you so much Honeybooboo!

Fun to make, yummy to eat.  Needs a good dipping sauce like Asian mustard or something with ginger.  Slice the water chestnuts really thin and follow the "finely diced" instructions on the chicken.  I cut the carrots to 1 cup, subbed jalapeno for the bell pepper, and added sliced mushrooms (good call!).  Don't spray the edges much with the cooking spray or they will get too brown/crispy.

I've never made egg rolls before, but I loved how I didn't have to fry them. I kept the sugar and I only had to cook them for about 12 minutes. I also wish I had used fresh bean sprouts since I try to not cook with canned food (with BPA,) but I have no idea where to get non-canned water chestnuts. I didn't even add the chicken, but I like how flexible this recipe is.
