Perfect dip! A local irish pub serves a curry dip with their fries and I was craving it. THIS was exactly what I was looking for. It's great with veggies, and french fries, and tonight I am going to use it with fried zucchini. Thank you.

I decided to try this dish because both my girlfriend and I love asparagus and curry.  I ended up very disappointed with the final product.  The asparagus ended up being delicious, but the curry dipping sauce wasn't what I had in mind.  The spiced in the dip tasted good, and for a while we thought the dip was ok, but then the realization that we were eating spiced mayonnaise and sour cream set in.  I don't think this dish is horrible and I believe many could enjoy it, but it’s not for everybody.  I'd recommend avoiding it if you are not a huge fan of mayonnaise.  For those who do like mayonnaise based dips, I’d recommend adding some garlic, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper to spice things up.

Wow! How can something that tastes so great be so easy?!!  This tastes just like the dip that Melting Pot Restaurant uses.  It's great on steamed or grilled veggies and even chunks of grilled meat. For the most healthy, I steam the veggie and use light mayo and light sour cream--still delicious.

Serves as a good base - but I added a lot of other spices to make it taste better. Granted the curry powder I used wasn't the best or fresh so that might have something to do with it. I added fresh pressed garlic, paprika, salt and pepper. I also might use yogurt instead of mayo, but keep the sour cream.

The 5 starts are for the curry dip-it was delicious. I too added honey and salt & pepper with a tich of cayenne.  I made crab cakes and served this dip and it went beautifully well together.  Also good on the asparagus.  Anything left I smeared onto sandwiches for lunch the next day.  So, so good.

I thought this recipe was pretty good. After a while I was more into the asparagus. After the asparagus was gone, left with allot of dip, I roasted some yellow squash and then added some honey to the dip. The honey brought a whole other layer to the classic curry flavor.

This was soooo easy and very delicious.  Different, too.  I served with the balnched asparagus, and added red and green pepper strips, and cherry tomatoes to the platter for a Christmasssy feel.  Well done, touche!

Very good, though I reversed the ratio of mayo to sour cream b/c I'm not a big fan of mayo. I also used Light mayo to reduce unnecessary fat.

I haven't made this with asparagus, but I really like this curry dip. So simple, and yet very nice with veggies (especially cauliflower!) or even chips.

Very Unique and I think you can have it as a light sauce on sautéed asparagus too.

I loved this, but my husband would've preferred them warm.  I steamed the asparagus instead of boiling and added garlic powder and a dash of cayenne pepper to the dip. Will make again.

Pretty good. I used this as a dipping sauce for fondue. It was a little thick and I ended up thinning it with a little milk.

So tasty!  I've been trying to reduce my fat intake and made this with lite mayo and fat free sour cream.  It was terrific.  One modification ... I would reduce cook time on the asparagus to 5 minutes (thin asparagus) to keep it crisper.

A great base and a very easy and pretty appetizer. Added salt, pepper and a little lemon juice to enhance the flavour. Many variations are possible. Thanks!

Two things:  you must love curry, and you must use a very good curry powder.  I am only now getting into curry, and though I  like it, I wished for another flavor to mingle into this.  It is very creamy, it has a good body for a dip, and it is very easy to prepare.  Thanks for the idea!

I was looking for a curry dip like the one served at The Melting Pot. When I first made this version, although it was delicious, I was a little disappointed because it didn't seem to be what I was looking for. I put the leftover dip in the fridge and was very happily surprised the next day when I tried it again and discovered that the flavor had exploded!!! I highly recommend letting this beautifully simple delicious dip sit in your fridge overnight!

This was wonderful. I'm not a huge fan of mayo or sour cream, but it tasted great on asparagus and even on a sandwich! So simple to make!
