I made this for recipe group this week. It was pretty good- but I thought that the end result was very lemony and sort of overpowered the other flavors. Also, I only have an indoor grill, so I had to make do with that. I served it with the curried rice pilaf from this site (which I highly recommend). Overall, it was a healthy dinner and we liked it- I think next time I'll just go a little easier on the lemon juice. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was a hit.  I ended up using boneless, skinless breast meat and marinated it overnight.  Threw it on the G. Foreman Grill.  The chicken was flavorful, moist and juicy.  Suggestion - Try using the leftovers in a Med. inspired pita pocket.  I smeared the pocket w/ hummus, filled it with leftover chicken cut up into strips, grape tomatoes, mix green salad, cucumber slices, kalamata olives and some crumbled feta cheese.  DELICIOUS!

I made this for recipe group. I'll admit, I was a little skeptical about the yogurt. DH doesn't like yogurt (IF he knows it's *in there*). I didn't tell him about the yogurt and the chicken didn't taste like yogurt. The spices really came through and the chicken was moist and delicious. The recipe didn't state whether to leave the skin on. I rubbed marinade under the skin and grilled it with the skin on to keep it moist. My chicken marinated for over 24 hours due to a change in plans.

I made this with boneless chicken cut into chunks and scewered, it was DELICIOUS. The chicken was so moist and tender and the smell was brilliant. I actually used 2% yogourt. I have made this twice in the last week as my daughter doesn't eat beef and I'm always looking for new ways to bbq chicken.

Despite all the fates conspiring against this getting made, we had it this evening.  I used BLSL and had to marinate about 30 hours because plans changed.  Then I had to bake the chicken because there was no gas for the grill.   The chicken came out mildly flavorful which was nice, but I doubt it would have had much flavor after only 8 hours.  I also baked it in the marinade, which I would not have been able to do had i grilled it.  I particularly liked thelittle bursts of ginger flavor.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this as the Recipe Exchange Group Recipe for the week of August 23rd. I had to bake this chicken in my oven instead of doing it on the grill at the last minute. I can't swear to it, but I'm fairly certain that baking this chicken instead of grilling it negatively impacted the flavor. Which is to say, the finished product, for me, had very little flavor to speak of. We sliced our chicken up and had it in wraps; the remainder is bland enough that I'll recycle it into other recipes without even needing to rinse it. Normally I'd call this a 3-star recipe, but I can't bring myself to do that this time since I was unable to cook it according to instructions, and I'm sure that had an impact. Thanks for the recipe!

Cubed boneless skinless chicken breasts and marinated. I added some garam masala to the marinade for a south asian flavor. The final result was moist and delicious chicken after grilling it on my foreman grill!

Trying to eat as clean in my house had gotten boring, but this marinate is easy to make healthy and makes SUCH a huge difference --- it was unbelievably good! I marinated my boneless skinless chicken for 2 days in it, and it was amazing. Def a fav in my house now.

Good flavor, I used leg quarters instead of breasts, so it took much longer to cook. Had to add about 15 minutes to the bigger pieces. Served it with buttered potatoes and home canned green beans!

I was looking for a recipe to use the rest of the plain yogurt I just used for another Indian dish.  This is a very good recipe.  Simple, super easy and great flavor.  Thanks for sharing.
