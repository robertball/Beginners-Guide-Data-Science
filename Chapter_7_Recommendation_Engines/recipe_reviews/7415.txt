what a wonderful joke, delicious too!!I've made this twice now.I bought the smallest cat box I could find, and the first time, it barely covered the bottom. The second time I made up 2 vanilla cake mixes and one chocolate and it filled the pan alot better.Also, the second time, I added the pudding before it set and it was alot easier to mix.It was a big hit both times however, got lots of laughs.I would love to meet the twisted mind who first thought it up...genius.

I have found when doing this cake that  the plastic liner makes it tough to scoop so I do not use the liner for the recipe.

We laughed the entire time making this cake.  We couldn't believe how "real" it looked!  We followed others advice:  no liner, peanut butter sandwich cookies, cheese cake pudding and crushed up butterfinger bars in cake.  Use the 4 inch long tootsie rolls and mircrowave for about 15-20 seconds.  Let them set a few minutes and then take off the plate.  They only needed a little shaping.  
It ended up tasting pretty good!  You will never have more fun making a cake!

Got gross reviews and that's what it's meant for, right!?  This is the second time I've made this and to make it more tasteful I used two boxes Marble cake mix and two chocolate ready made pudding containers. I also used a tub of Creamy Fudge frosting which I microwaved and mixed with the pudding.  This definitely moistened it and made it taste more like "chocolate cake" than dried cake with some pudding globs. I took the leftover frosting and drizzled on top of the cake before putting the cookie crumbs on it.  You could use any type of cake mix and frosting because it's basically hidden underneath the cookie crumbs anyway.

Overall, this recipe was a great effect.  It really "grossed" everybody out, but it really was tasty.  But it wasn't as realistic on the first try, so I made some changes to the recipe.  First, I got rid of the chocolate cake mix and opted for another white mix.  Then I used Oreo cookies instead of vanilla creams.  I still used a few vanilla creams with the green food coloring mixed in.  And lastly, I sprinkled the whole thing with powdered sugar to mimic the baking soda that lots of folks put in their litter boxes.

I served this tonight at my girl scout troop's halloween party and it was a huge hit.  The pan is almost empty.  The cake tasted great and was perfect for the kids, but of course, the real knock-out was the way it looked.  It was truly disgusting and had the parents gagging and snickering.  I used Little Debbie brownies, rolled into poop-shapes, instead of tootsie rolls, which I thought would harden too easily.  They looked even more realistic than the tootsie rolls.  I also used an entire cup of cookie crumbs, dyed green, for the topping, and it looked really authentic.
Great recipe!

This was the most creative cake Iv ever seen!  I made this for my husband to take to work today, he called me at noon and said everyone was cracking up and loved it.  I didnt use a liner and it still looked fabulous.  I did crush up a Butterfinger and add it to the mix for some extra flavor.  I used 4 vanilla snack packs, and it was the perfect amount!

I "serve" this cake up every year for our Halloween Party, and will be doing so again this year!  Props totally make the cake!  I really go for the gross-out effect and roll some of the pooh in the cookie crumbles.  Not the tastiest cake, but the effect is what does it.  Got a great photo last year of my cat peeking into the pan (while everyone ran to keep her out!)!  Thanks Dee for always making my Halloween Party a hit!

Fun cake to make, tastes okay, but most people wouldn't get near it.  A lot of work for something almost no one would try.  Couldn't get past how gross it looked I guess.  Terrific for Halloween, or any time you want high "gross out factor" but expect it to be decorative, not dessert.

I love this cake!  I first made it for my good friend's (who is a wrestling coach) Halloween party for his wrestlers, figuring they, being middle school aged, would appreciate "toilet humor".  They loved it and, surprisingly, it tastes GREAT!  I can't get over how yummy it tastes and how realistic it looks.  I'm always looking for an excuse to take this somewhere (though it never fails someone asks if the box/scoop are used......gross).  You really can't beat this for a Halloween or Fear Factor themed party.

This was a really fun cake to make and eat!  I followed some other reviews on the recommendations as follows:  I used Little Debbie brownies.  They are easy to handle and mold.  And you can get quite a few poops from one package of brownies!  For the litter I used almost one entire pack of Golden Oreos and crumbled them in the food processor.  I used one box of Butter cake mix and one box of Devil's Food cake and baked both of them together to save on pans and clean-up.  I just baked them for a longer period of time.  (You're going to crumble the cake and mix it together anyway...)  I used one pack of Vanilla pudding and one pack of Butterscotch flavor.    For the added reality effect (as if this needs more reality?) I used my fingertips and made paw prints.  LOL  It tasted good, and in my opinion it tasted a lot better the next day after the pudding was able to soak into the cake!

This is a favorite at my job.  It grosses out all the new people but those of us that have had it before love it!  I use 1 marble and 1 chocolate fudge cake, cheesecake pudding, add crushed butterfingers, and drizzle chocolate frosting over it all.  For the litter I use peanutbutter and vanilla oreos.  I add green foodcoloring to some of the vanilla ones, add blue to some, and leave some plain.  One tip - be sure you don't over heat the tootsie rolls.  They get too hard to eat.  Enjoy!

OMG...what a riot.  it was sooooooo realistic and disgusting looking.  My son came in with my gson right after it was finished.  My gson (4 yrs) saw me picking at it and eating it, and lost his friggin mind!  "Daddy! Gma Dee's eating cat poop!"  It really frightened him.  I had to hold him, show him, and even then he wasn't too convinced til I showed him how I made the poop outta tootsie rolls... He pointed his finger at me and said "Gramma, don't ever do that to me again."  And btw, if you heat up the tootsie rolls really hot, to a ''wet'' consistency, you can scrape it off and it looks like the 'cat' had diarrhea..  Gross, yes but that's what this cakes all about!  Just be CAREFUL. REALLY hot tootsie rolls blisters if it gets on your skin!  Happy All Hallows Eve !!

this is too funny!  i had seen this recipe years ago, tomorrow is treat day at work......lol..... and i work at a mental health center!  they're going to know i'm not right!  :D  anyway - the finished product looks absolutely "real"!  we taste tested the "cake" and it's great.  i used 1 carrot cake and 1 butter cake, and 8 vanilla snack pack pudding cups.  i did not mix any poo into the cake, i don't think the chocolate would add anything to the flavors of the spice/butter cake.  and the suggestion for the little debbies brownies as poo is purrrrrfect!  hahahaha.  i also didn't add any cookies to the cake mixture as i really think it would make it too dry.  i used all of them on the top of the cake mixture, then sprinkled the "green" cookie litter evenly over the entire cake.  also, i actually only used one brownie for all the poo that was needed.  some pictures seemed that lots of tootsie rolls and brownies were overkill and didn't look as "real".   I mean who lets their litter box actually get that filthy.  I cant wait to take it tomorrow, if anybody asks about the litter box and scoop, i'll tell them i washed it first!  (i'm still laughing) and thats the truth!  have fun with this!  happy halloween everybody! :D

Easy, easy, easy to make.  I made mine as a cake underneath the cookie crumbs so guests could actually cut into something and eat a slice of substance.  Has the same look as the pics.  Was a big hit.  Will definitely use next year!!

This is the best poo cake ever! I brought this cake to a party for someone who is a cat fanatic and she absolutely loved it. It was definitely huge hit with all the guest.   Instead of using German Chocolate cake, I used Spiced cake instead. Yes, this cake is very easy to make. I find it helpful to bake the two cakes and make the pudding the day before.

Great for a Halloween or April Fools Party!!!  Tastes great too.  everyone gets a kick out of serving themselves with a kitty litter scoop.  Presentation is everything with this dish!!
******************************
I made this again this year for my Halloween party and it was SUCH a hit!!  I made 1 box yellow cake with 3 eggs and no oil (I replaced the oil with water).  I also made a devils food cake the same way.  I used a little more than half of the devils food cake and all of the yellow cake.  I mixed in 2 boxes of sugar free vanilla pudding as well as about 12 butterfingers that I crushed up in the food processor.  I would use even more butterfingers next time!  I used about 8 sandwich cookies, which I also crushed up.  Finally, I microwaved 3 sizes of tootsie rolls for 25 seconds then easily shaped them.  Everyone loved the taste and the presentation!  I found the smallest pan at Petsmart and just ran it through the dishwasher twice (just to be sure!).  Hope everyone enjoys this great recipe--thanks so much for submitting it!!!

I made this this morning and it's great! In answer to a couple other reviews - don't leave out the pudding, it's just too yummy with it.  You won't get the same effect at all with plain cake. But I'd say you only need one package of pudding, or barely over one.  Also, heat the tootsies on LOW heat, just until they're a little soft, and they'll soften up in your mouth okay later.  I didn't use all the cookie crumbs, in fact only about half of them, and I needed way more than 3 drops of coloring to turn the 1/4 cup green.  Everyone loves this, it's fun to make and look at and eat!

This was a big hit at a birthday party for a cat lover. Like other reviewers, I modified the recipe. I bought the smallest size litter box, perfect for a 13x9 cake. I simply made the cake as normal (1 box), sliced in half and filled with vanilla pudding (2 boxes), iced the cake (I used coconut pecan), then covered with crumbled vanilla wafers (1 box), etc. You can really just make any cake and follow the directions for the litter topping and droppings.

Didn't have a pooper scooper for my picture today, but who cares. LOL!! This was a blast to do. I wasn't planning on doing this recipe this year, but at last minute my in laws came over for a visit and brought my kid a huge bag of candy...then went running for this recipe and found I had everything on hand. I used a Triple chocolate cake mix. Didn't have all enough vanilla sandwich cookies so I used a few duplex ones and it worked well. My oldest saw what I was doing and she suggested I use something that looked like worms that cats get, so I put in abouta cup of rice crispie cereal into the cake mix after mixing the pudding and cookie mixture together. It was soo much fun. I already was told by my sister...great job but was too gross looking for her to even eat it. hahaha I think I LOVE this recipe... ;-) And I have to say..my cat Mr. Jingles looked at it, was confused and then the look on his face was "I didn't do it" hahhahaha!

My son's school holds a fall festival every year and his 6th grade class hosts the cake walk. I made this and it was a HUGE HIT!  Parents and children were constantly coming to see it, and it was the last to go onto the "walk".  The line was so long, attendees had to choose numbers, as they all wanted the "gross" cake. Great fundraiser for the class!

My 8th grade daughter took this as an object lesson for school.  She had to demonstrate 'something' and she spoke on how to clean a kitty litter box for her example...using this edible cake.  a BIG hit with the students and teacher as well.  She got an "A"! but grossed everyone out when she ate one of the 'poop-ies' at the end of her talk!

Fun to make, realistic outcome. Went to a Halloween party last night and took this over. It was a HUGE hit! It was also very tasty! I made some changes: I used 2 chocolate ready-made pudding containers and a whole tub of chocolate frosting which I mixed with the batter before putting it in the litter box. This made for a moist, rich chocolaty taste. The rest I followed as per the recipe. You can't get an easier decorated cake than this!

I just made this recipe for my daughters 11th birthday party at a skating rink and it was amazing!!  She loves it when I do crazy things with her cakes and this one was her favorite.  I bought the litter box at Wal-mart for $1.97 and it was small enough to hold one chocolate and one vanilla cake crumbled up.  I used cheesecake flavored pudding and I mashed the cake down and iced it with chocolate icing, and then topped it with the crumbled cookies and tootsie rolls.  You can use any cake you like since you can't see it because the cookies cover it all up.  Everyone thought it was delicious!!  I will certainly make this cake again, and I would not leave out the frosting if I were you, it made it taste more like cake.

I have been wanting to make this cake for ages.  I substituted banana pudding and banana cake for the white/vanilla options and I think it added a lot to the overall taste.  As with the other reviews, the final result was just too realistic for most people to be willing to try it, so in the end I had to throw away most of it!  So if you feel badly about throwing away food, you might want to make something else.  But if you making it just for shock value, this is your recipe!!

Disgustingly good, and room for artistic license! Very moist cake and the left overs keep nicely. Of course it's just a matter of someone keeping their gag reflex down long enough to cut into it....

Great idea!  I made this for my daughter's 13th birthday and everyone loved it.  The girls ate it with the lights dimmed, as they had a hard time getting over the visual.  We waited until just before the party to mix the cake and pudding together so it wasn't so mushy.  We also added a few drops of black color to the white cake mix to make it more gray.  So much fun to make.

This was a hit at a birthday party. The only thing I did differently was used one cake and no pudding. This recipe makes a lot and we are  small family. We followed the rest of the recipe as stated

I have made this recipe every year for the last 4 years, and plan to use it again. I work in a classroom with all boys. I love to gross them out at Halloween. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe said. It was so gross on the outside and inside of the cake that they wouldn't eat it. So I now make the two cakes without mixing them together. I just stack them in the kitty litter pan and spread the pudding on the top. This way they can see that on the inside, it is indeed a cake. The recipe is perfect both ways. 
Note: You have to serve it in a (new) kitty litter box with the scoop and the poops. :)

I made this cake for a Halloween party and dressed up as a cat.  It was a hit!  Everyone laughed at it, but also dug in to try it.  
This would be great to make for a cat lover's birthday, too!

This is such a funny idea - perfect for Halloween.  Four stars just for the idea.  Given other reviewers' opinions of the taste, I'd say anyone else trying this can save themselves a lot of work by not worrying about the pudding.  I used just one french vanilla cake mix, crumbled the top of it a bit (keeping it in the 9x13 pan), and added the crushed cookies on top.  The three people who were brave enough to try it all said it was good, and it was a lot less work than the original recipe seems to be.

What a fun cake, speciallly since I love cats and have several friends that do also.  I usually crush my cookies in a ziplock bag with a rolling pin, makes for an easy clean-up!  I also add chocolate covered raisins in it and on it~quite realistic  ~^..^~
By the way, this is a great cake for those not so fond of cats too  :)

This cake is great!  I get requests for it every Halloween.  I only put the tootsie rolls on top for decoration otherwise its too chewie in the cake.  I have used extra cookie crumbs and food coloring which makes it look more authentic.

People were so grossed out, they almost couldn't eat it, but it actually tasted good! One extra detail I added was to use some of the extra yellow pudding poured strategically on top of the cake with the melted tootsie rolls.  It looked absolutely disgusting!

I used Little Debbie Cosmic Brownies (colorful chips removed) for the poops this go around.  Did Tootsie Rolls last year.  Brownies work MUCH better!  Smeared a little on the side of the box and refrained from adding too many.  If you notice, if you put too much poo in the cake, it looks artificial.  My picture is currently 149 and is a green box with ingredients around it.  The camera flaked out and made everything yellow, but I was rushed because everyone wanted to start eating the cake.  I also put the box on newspapers...that was a really nice touch.  It was a major hit this year.

I followed the recipe except for using French Vanilla Pudding blended with a brick of softened cream cheese for a little more flavor.  It looks totally authentic!  I had "sparkling sugar" (large sugar crystals) in blue that really added something.  I was asked to bring this for a cookout hosted by a 21 yr old co worker....I think it's going to be a big hit!  It tasted just ok while I was making it last night, hoping more flavor will have developed overnight.  Will update tonight after cookout.  My pic is #135.

My daughter made this for our Halloween party tonight. My son walked in saw it on the counter and thought it was the real thing. Our 7 yr old grand daughter was a bit hesitant about trying the cake. It was great :) Daughter did make a couple of changes she used Nutter Butter cookies and like another reviewer suggested Little Debbie brownies. A little extra touch she drizzled a bit of Hershey syrup down the side and smooshed a brownie into it. If you are having a big party this is perfect, you might not want to make it if the party is small. I posted a picture of the cake on my Facebook page and ppl started to comment on it right away.

Was a little skeptical about the taste based on reviews of others here, but it really was good! I used a chocolate fudge and yellow cake mix and cheesecake pudding and it was delicious! Defintely takes some time to make, but the look on everybody's face when they see it is priceless! The green food coloring is essential.

This cake was much better for the viewing, and the joke effect. I did not like the flavor of the cake. If I ever make it again, I will use only Vanilla cake or try something different. Maybe a boxed carrot cake with raisins for an even better "Kitty Litter Cake" effect! I would use oatmeal cookies, instead of peanut butter cookies for the top, and not add the Butterfingers. After suggesting these changes, I will now have to try it that way!

this did not turn out well for me... i had way too much pudding, 1 package would have been plenty. I felt the two color of cakes brown and yellow did not look like litter.  The green coloring really made it look weird and not like a litter.  the tootsie rollsl totally worked though and no more than 10 seconds per candy! i burned myself :)  So overall it was an interesting concept, it tasted great but didnt look like I expected it to.

This cake was great and perfect for our special occasion. 

We purchased a small litter box and matching scoop for less than three bucks at the big W. We used one spice cake and one classic white. We did not end up using all of the pudding. Skipped the liner and just mixed the cake and pudding all together in the litter box (saved on clean-up). This was a big hit! Thanks for the recipe :)

This is great.  I made for a white trash party this summer and some people couldn't eat it, it looked so real!  If you are in a hurry... I didn't make a cake, I used a pre-made brownie, covered with the crushed cookies and used little debbie brownies to make the poo.  Very fun, thank you.

Definitely would make again, very tasty, and realistic looking.  BUT....I wouldn't crumble the cake next time.  I would layer it with pudding in between  and use the cookie crumbs on top.  It tasted great, but because it was crumbly it wasn't easy to eat.

I made this for a Halloween party one year, and NO ONE WANTED TO EAT IT. It looked that authentic, I guess :) But I ate it, and persuaded some others, and it was excellent. I used a throwaway foil broiler pan so as not to have to buy an actual cat box (though the simplest kind  isn't that expensive) and lined it with a small white trashbag to look like a litter liner. It looked great and I reverted to about 11 years old while I was shaping the tootsie rolls. 

And, hilarious visual aside, it tasted great.

This cake looked so repulsive some people had to think twice about eating it since they knew I had a cat. I loved it.

I couldn't find any german cake mix so i made brownies and crumbled them and was still a huge hit. I only used a half a box of pudding mix (my husband got the rest), just enough to keep it a little moist and it was perfect. I'm glad I made extra "poo" because everyone wanted a piece. I was told it should be made for every halloween party for now on :)

I gave this to a cat-loving friend for her birthday and it was a great hit.  I wrapped the box up like a gift and had her open up the scooper first so that she'd think it was a box of cat toys.  The best reaction was from the waiter at the restaurant when he looked and saw it on the table!!

I made this to surpise my guests for our New Year's Eve party. A big hit! I'd recommend using blue food coloring to represent kitty litter sparkles also. I also baked the two cakes in the oven at the same time (two different pans); this saved time. It was great! Great taste and definitely a conversation piece for the party!

This cake is very realistic and delicious.  I foster kittens, so I've made this cake quite a few times for the shelter, rescue friends, and the vet.  I make it exactly as the recipe says except I don't use a liner for the litter pan.  It's time consuming, so I make the cakes and pudding the night before and also crush the cookies.  The next day, I just have to assemble and it's done.  It always gets the intended results and comments from my friends :)  I love to make it and gross everyone out!

I have made this cake for my hubby and his co-workers for several years. They love it. Last year I made it for my co-workers who thought it was a riot. Those who could get past the site of it, thought it had a great flavor. I am making it again this year for both my hubby and I to take to work and an additional one for my son to take to his job. I have used several different variations with cake mixes, cookies and pudding and they all turn out great. Last year, I only had flourescent green food coloring and what an effect that had! I would encourage anyone who tries this recipe to use the litter box and scoop because no matter which cake mix, cookies, pudding or color of food coloring, the "eeewwww" can be heard all around and those who like sweets will like this cake! Definately a Halloween tradition in this household!

Idea was good, but final product wasn't as good. I made it as indicated, but next time I will just use one cake mix and frost the cake as normal, and put the "kitty litter" topping on top of the frosted cake. Crumbling up the two cake mixes was messy and even messier to eat and not very appetizing.

This was the perfect end to my April Fool's dinner! I used 1 box deluxe carrot cake w/raisins, 1 box yellow cake & French vanilla pudding. I used about 3/4's of the pudding. It actually tasted really good!  The best part was that I used Little Debbies brownies (per reviews) for the poo.  I tried the tootsie rolls but they were hard to work with & weren't nearly as realistic.  When I dyed the crumbs, I dripped the food coloring onto the side of the cup and then stirred the crumbs around. As the crumbs pass the coloring they pick up a little color. It seemed to distribute the color best that way.  Thanks for such a fun recipe!  About 7 out of 10 guests were brave enough to try it :o)

I made 2 last year.  One for my work and one for my husbands.  Everyone was a little scared at first because it REALLY looks like kitty litter when you serve it in the pan.  But it was all ate very quickly and everyone loved it!

I made this cake for my daughter's 6th birthday party (at her request).  Everyone thought it was the cutest thing they've ever seen and, once they got around the whole "kitty poop" gross-out factor, they all thought it was delicious.  I didn't use the german chocolate cake mix, though.  I thought it would darken the "sand" too much.  Instead, I used a spice cake mix and a white cake mix.  This got me the perfect kitty litter color.  The green-colored cookie crumbs really add to the realism!  Be careful not to put too many Tootsie Roll "droppings".  I think I used a total of 12, rather than the entire 12-ounce bag.

Made this for my son's 9th b-day party @ a bowling alley. It so rocked! "Has this litter box been used?" is asked repeatedly...haha...my boys gleefully tell them 'YES'!(brats)....
I used a small kitty litter box, 3 cake mixes( 1 chocolate, 1 butter, 1 white), used all of the pudding, mixed in Heath toffee bits and what butterfinger pieces I had left, and extra cookie crumbs. Then after pressing it into the pan, frosted it with tan tinted fluffy frosting(I personally think tinting is an unnecessary step), AND I drizzled butterscotch sundae syrup over that before proceeding. It finished up beautifully with a runny #9 in the middle...And the poop scoop tucked neatly in the corner. The best part is that it tasted awesome! It is rich though, and will serve quite a crowd. The reactions alone are sooo worth it! LOL!

Made this for a birthday party at work....Having cats myself, I decided to make the poo a little more realistic so instead of just using the Tootsie Rolls, I used a few maryJane's and Bit-O Honey's for a bit of color variation.  I also used a few differnt Tootsie rolls sizes for the sculptures!  What a hit! It was fun to see which of my colleagues were brave enough to try it and once they did they really loved it!  Also, I used the white cake mix with puding in the recipe and a spice cake mix.  I ended up using the whole spice cake and just half of the white cake.  I added ~ 1.5 cups of pudding and it was a perfect texture!  Just moist enough and I think the ratio of white to spice cake made for a nice flavor.  I decided to kae everything up the night before and assembled the cake just before bring it in to the office.  This is a keeper....I have never seen so many people stop by for a party before...word traveled fast about this cake!  A true hit! 
Thanks!

my guests loved the way it looked! However I did not think it tasted very good. Also be sure to buy a very small litter box. I bought a medium sized one and the cake was way to small.

This is absolutley hilarious and a great idea.  It wasn't difficult to make but it did take a bit of time, but was worth it as it looks so real!  I used a bit less pudding than stated but made no other changes.  It won first prize at a Halloween Potluck at work for Most Original and tasted good too.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was so much fun! We made it for my daughter to take into work for Halloween... she works in a vet's office with 5 kitties who have the run of the place, so it was the perfect choice! We are currently in the middle of a kitchen remodeling project and have no oven, so we purchased ready-made triple-chocolate and vanilla poundcakes, ready-made pudding cups and the cake was delicious! I can't wait to experiment with other flavors of cakes and perhaps thin icing or glaze in place of the pudding.

I made this for my Veterinary Office to thank them for a surgery. They all got a great kick out of it and told us that it was pretty good, having been made with paws (we told them it was a gift from the cats!). The office loved it and the look on everyones face was priceless! I also used an aluminum roasting pan (the kind you buy for turkeys) with the litter-box liner and it was the PERFECT FIT.

I could only find tootsie roll migees so I combined some to make bigger poos. I also tried to bury them in the cake crumbs a little for an authentic effects. I used green coloured coconut instead of the extra cookies. It was a hit.

Had the desired reaction I was looking for at a Halloween party- folks were repulsed! : ) I was worried by how dark it was at first, but the cookie crumbs on top took care of that. I used 3 snack packs and only about 8 t rolls (a couple were the larger kind - wanted it to be realistic looking, and my husband would faint if our cat's litter box was that "filled!")The one draped over the edge was the clincher! Used liners, scoop and dishpan that I got from the Dollar Tree - those items will be packed up in the attic w/our Halloween decorations to be used next year!

This was a big hit for my son's 7th birthday. I halved the recipe and made it in a small litter pan. I added some black paste food colouring to the white crushed cookies (turned them grey).  This really looked like litter. I also added one crushed oreo cookie to the white cookies. I made small poops to top every childs serving with. I also cheated and just used four prepacked pudding cups and one package of marble cake mix.

This is a funny cake to make.  My brother refused to eat it, but everyone else in my family tried it.  It is a tasty cake, but not something I would make just for the taste of it alone.  If you need a cake for shock value and taste-this is it!

what a hoot! this was fun to make, though by no means quick, but the end result was certainly worth it. i'd make it again. it looked real enough just lining a large cake pan with a small garbage bag and using a regular scooper. but knock yourself out w/the real thing if you want. the green crumbs are the best - i'd make more of these next time for an even grosser effect.

It is quick & easy to make and is great as a decoration, but it just doesn't taste good.  Even the kids didn't like it.  They would much rather have dirt cake w/gummy worms!

This was so gross looking but the kids LOVED it!!!  I used tootsie rolls and brownies for the poop.  I think the pre-packaged brownies worked best.

This is the recipe I was given, but since I have developed my own version. I just crush up sandwich cookies, half chocolate, half vanilla and put them in the litter box. Then I make a recipe of a simple fudge (Betty Crocker kids cookbook) that is just melted chocolate chips with condensed milk and vanilla extract stirred in. While the fudge is still warm, I put it in a cake decorator with no tip on it and pipe out "poops" into the litter box. As the fudge cools, it hardens. Looks almost too real!

One of the "Cooks I Like" made this, and that's how I found the recipe. Ya'll must have good senses of humor to make and serve this. Love the pictures of your cats looking at your masterpieces. Very funny.

This cake is delicious!  I've made this for the past 5 years for April Fools Day.  I don't use the liner. And instead of tootsie rolls, I use the Little Debbie Fudge Brownies. Cut them up and roll them.

Fabulous! I made this for a co-worker leaving with a note that read "take your  and git"--it was a great hit. Reading other reviews I used double the white cake and found out when adding food coloring that the color does not impact all the little crumbs. It takes a little bit to get them distributed. I also mixed in a little blue. The intended recipient was fooled at first glance and it was an office hit!

What a hit for Halloween!!! I used brownines for the base (the mix was on sale), and instead of using the pudding, I frosted the brownies with choclate frosting to keep them moist and to give the cookies something to stick to.

Absolutely Hilarious!  It looks way too real & most people get eebie-jeebies at first, but once they taste it they can't stop!  It is a divine recipe that will be the hit of the party.  It was my brother's 21st birthday cake; he got a real kick out of it.  Enjoy!  You won't be sorry!

I used my own better than sex recipe for the base recipe but absolutely loved the idea.  I tinted cool whip blue for a topping and ground up nilla wafers for the litter.   I added blue food coloring to powdered sugar and blended it with a hand whisk.   I then mixed the sugar and nilla wafers together.   There was some bright blue pieces, just like in fresh step kitty litter.   I put this on top of the cool whip and it looked great.

I work "for" over 500 cats (we had over 800 cats only 2 years ago) and someone made this cake at least twice for our Cat Party.  Both time I wasn't able to attend but everybody raved about this cake so the rating is coming from my 40 co-workers/cat caregivers.  I must say the thumbnail picture for this recipe is right on!  I have to make this myself and bring it back to my friends and family since they think I'm the Crazy Cat Woman...  like it's a bad thing... :)  Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent surprise factor, and very moist! Our variation on serving: We used an aluminum pan and found a metal scoop. I'm not sure that it is wise to use plastics that aren't food-grade. :-)

Grossed out the whole party so it did as intended.  Very easy to make and the kids had a blast forming the "poops".  I didn't use the liner and cheated with a package of individual pudding cups.  Thanks for the nasty idea!  :D

This cake did what I was hoping for...totally grossed out my kids!  They seriously thought I had placed the cat box on the counter!  However, I was not at all impressed with the flavor of the cake.  I followed some of the suggestions and used chocolate pudding and 1 each choc/vanilla cake.  I also limited the number of tootsie rolls as they are very difficult to eat with cake!  I also had trouble getting the 1/4 Cup of vanilla cookies to dye green.  Someone suggested Nilla Waffers next time.  Will make again for shock value, just wish it tasted better.

I made this for an office Halloween party 6 years ago and it was a hit! Not many people tasted it (due to it looking really nasty), but they still loved it. To get in the theme of things, my co worker and I dressed up as cats. :)

Cake was a hit! I made it with the chocolate cake recipe on the Hershey's cocoa, silver white cake from Betty Crocker and cheese cake pudding. I used black coloring in the cookies (Golden oreo's) to make them darker, worked like a charm!

This will be the fourth year in a row that I have made this cake for my husband and his co-workers. They have come to expect it @ Halloween. Rarely does he bring home any leftovers. We have experimented with the recipe...they all turn out great. This year I will be making THREE of them!!!

This cake gets a 5 stars for presentation (it is SO gross looking!) as well as taste!   I did not use the german chocolate cake mix though.. I used chocolate fudge cake mix.  It made the litter box look even more disgusting.. like it hasnt been changed in a very long time!  I also used Oreo vanilla cream sandwich cookies - good brand and it turned out wonderfully.  I did end up using almost all the pudding - it wasnt soggy at all, but just moist and wonderful.  And, I only used about 7 or so tootsie rolls - buried some and laid some on top, looked very "real"! It makes A LOT of kitty litter though!  I made it for an April Fools Recipe Exchange that we had with our playgroup and the moms loved it!  Topped it off by presenting it in a small kitty litter box and scooper.. was nice. This is an excellent recipe - highly recommend!

We loved making and eating it! My daughter agreed it would look more real without the dark cake. I will next time use only 2 white or white and spice cakes instead of german chocolate. Also double the amount of vanilla oreos (just use a whole package). And double the amount colored with green to 1/2C.  We will use all of the 2pkgs of pudding too.  Fun and yummy!

I didn't eat it...made it for hubby to take to work for Halloween gag.  But he reported that they liked it!  I did one spice cake, one french vanilla and one butter golden.  I did large crumbles of each cake in a large foil disposable pan.  Since I made an extra cake, I used 2 puddings.  I crumbled two fullsize butterfinger bars and did a light light layer of tub buttercream frosting on top just to add some flavor.  I had some Little Debbie brownies on hand anyway, so I warmed those in my hands for a few seconds and then formed them into the poo.  It really is a rare delight to giggle while working in the kitchen, lots of fun making this!

Great cake for a good laugh. Lots of fun to make. I would use some frosting & more pudding next time. The little debbie brownies can be very ralistic! & this recipe can really be used with alot of differant cakes mixes & pudding.

This was SO much fun at an adult Halloween party. I had to sick a couple of my teenage nephews I recruited to help set up to try it so the adults would go near it! Once it was carved into- it was GONE!

This came out great. I used cheescake pudding and peanut butter sandwich cookies as suggested. Followed the rest exactly. Everyone was absolutely horrified and amused by its appearance. Once someone tried it, almost everyone did and said it was one of the best "cakes" they've ever tried. thanks for the great Halloween Party centerpiece.

I've made this before a long time ago for an office party.  Everyone loved it!  It was so realistic looking.  I used vanilla Oreos, and I also hung a tootsie roll off the side.  I also had the scoop right under a turd/tootsie roll.

I've made this recipe several times over the past ten years. It always causes a stir and there are requests for the recipe. I needed to email it to someone, so checked this site to see if it was available. This is exactly the same recipe I've always used. It gets every dish in the house dirty, but it is so worth it! I use two very small cat boxes and split the recipe - one to take to the party, one to keep at home! As one friend stated, "It looks SO GROSS, but tastes SO GOOD!!"

Great for Halloween.  Loved the concept of making it look like kitty litter, but I did not like the way the cake tasted nor did I like the texture. The second time I made this, I made my own trifle, but followed this recipe for putting the crushed cookies on top to make it look like kitty litter.

Presentation good, taste not so good. I altered the recipe and and added an extra cake. I used 2 3.5 boxes of jello, guess I should've used one. The consistency was gross. I probably will not make again becasue it was extremely time consuming and not very good. Everyone did get a good laugh out of it though.

This looked really disgusting!  The people who had the nerve to try LOVED IT!  I made 1 changes.  I used nutter butter cookies in place of the vanilla.

My friend and I made this cake for her to take to her staff party, and some of the staff refused to touch it, it looked that realistic! It was extremely easy to make, actually tasted quite good, and the gross-out factor was impossible to beat! We bought the kitty litter box and scoop, and the Tootsie Roll poops really finished it off. Highly recommended for any age, but I bet it would be super fun for kids to make with their parents!

Not the greatest tasting cake but the visual makes it a hit :)  I first made this for our April Fools dinner and my kids loved it.  Now I make it for my church & school cake walks and it's always the first cake chosen by the winner.

Made this cake for my husband's birthday. Too bad I can't download the picture that showed his reaction to the cake!!! It tasted great, too. I was very careful not to add too much pudding since I had read that it can get too soggy. VERY REALISTIC!!!

This was so much fun.  Made it for a "cake auction" with a bunch of military folk in Misawa Japan... made well into the triple digits.  Everyone had a ball with this one, and my friends and I had so much fun making it.  We even bought a covered litter box.  Good times for all.

What a hoot!!! This cake is just as much fun to make as it is to eat.  I must admit that I was skeptical as to how the cake would look, but it was so realistic that some of my coworkers wouldn't eat it!! (and these people work in an ICU at a busy downtown hospital).  The clincher is digging it out with the pooper scooper.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I can't wait to next Hallowe'en to see who's next to be grossed out!!!

My granddaughter and I made this cake together for her 11th birthday.  What a fun way to make some deposits in the memory bank.  It was also a lot of fun listening to her plan how she was going to surprise her guests.  I recommend all you grandpaws have as much fun as I did with your grandchildren.

This looks so just like a very used litter box, especially if you shape the tootsie rolls as suggested.  It actually tastes pretty decent but only a couple of brave guests (out of about 20) would actually eat it - it looked a little too realistic.

I made this for a work party - it was really good and moist, but everyone seemed very wary of it because of how gross it looked. I had to take more than half of it home. Despite that, I think it's a wonderful recipe and I would make it again -- even not for a party!

Oh my gosh!! What a fantastic "trick". I made this for work and it was a hit. They troughly enjoyed the trick with the kitty litter pan, scoop and rolls. There were a few who wouldn't try it, but those that did went back for seconds. My son helped me to prepare the "treat" and said that it looked real and that it sure was gross. This is the first year I have made Kitty Litter Cake and let me tell you, it certainly won't be the last.

I couldn't bring myself to put the cake in the kitty litter box, so I put it in a disposable foil roasting pan.  I did use a poop scoop, though.  It was great seeing my coworkers reactions to it - I told them the green bits were deodorizing sparkles. Lots of fun, but a few people did decline to eat it!

This is a great cake! It was easy to make, but I didn't put enough pudding in it, so the cake was crumbling off the fork when people ate it. I brought it to a Halloween party and people thought it was disgusting, but funny. When I told them what was in it, they tried it and liked it. I'd say it was a hit. It's definitely a fun dessert!

A really neat recipe was a hit at my Halloween party.  Tastes great.  I did make a few changes I used a plain chocolate cake instead of german chocolate cake and did not have the green food coloring but it turned out great.  An inexpensive cat liner is a white trash bag and it worked well and didn't have to worry about added chemicals.  Everyone was hesitant about trying but loved it.  If you want to shorten the time in this recipe I had both the white and chocolate cake made at the grocery store bakery and then put it all together.  It was wonderful..I will do this again every year.

This is one of the best cakes I know of. I actually have this recipie at home, and have made it several times.  I have kinda of a funny story I'd like to share about this cake.  My best friend just loves this cake, so last year for christmas my mother made it for her.  She wanted it to cool quickly, so she covered it, and set it on the back porch to cool down.  SHe goes out there, a little bit later and notices a hole ripped on the covering.  She takes it inside, take off the cover and sees a (real) cat's paw print under where the hole was, and one tootsie roll missing!  We had such a great laugh over that one for months!  (at least the neighboors cat had a nice treat to eat for xmas!)

Made this for a friend's birthday who always "tricks" everyone around him - made him eat a fork full after blowing out the candles.  Everyone is still talking about it.....and it tastes good too!  Get a bunch of friends together and make one for someone you all "love" whose always goofing on everyone else!  No need for ALL those tootsies - a few go a long way.

This is GREAT!!! I made it for work today (Halloween) and everyone was afraid to touch it! Once the brave people tried it they loved it.  The cake was so much fun to make! Even my husband got into making the "Tootsie Roll Treasures". We laughed and laughed as we put it together.  We colored all of the cookies with the green food coloring and we took the suggestion of sprinkling powdered sugar on top, boy, it just added to the realism!  Thank you for a wonderful, easy and fun, fun, fun recipe!

I was excited to make this but it turned out to be complicated. Then My kids wouldn't eat it. It grossed them out. It took me forever to make the "poops" and I hope I never see this recipe again. Too bad Dee.

Loved it! I always read reviews. To gain additional tips and add ins etc when it comes to recipes. Glad I did!  I didn't use a liner. I went to the dollar general and picked up most of the items there...The kitty litter pan most likely will be bigger than a really small one like this recipe calls for so you will need 2 boxes of white and one Devils food cake. I used 2 boxes of pudding however I think it could of used a some of a 3rd? Maybe not up to you.... And get an extra package of cookies (just use off brand vanilla sandwich cookies) Use little Debbie Brownies and roll them into 'turds' for easier,faster and more authentic looking outcome. I also took a picture with my cat  looking up at the camera over the litter pan... Lol it was a riot...It's a really delicious recipe but you could substitute really any flavored cake that you wanted (vanilla,yellow etc) with one box of the dark. This is a great 'gag' potluck dish because it makes a lot!!

I made this for my book club and they all loved it!   First, I went to the dollar store and found a small dish washing pan instead of a kitty litter pan, since they are too big and got a cheap new kitty litter scooper there.  The cake  fit a little better in the smaller pan.  Also, one thing I did was I used 2 boxes of white cake mix instead of the german chocolate. I did it because one of my friends doesn't like chocolate, but it turns out, the "litter" looks WAY more realistic without the chocolate.   Then I draped one of the "poops" over the side of the litter box.  It was a HUGE hit and I have to say, this is ironically one of the moistest and yummiest cakes I have ever eaten!  LOL!

I made this cake several years ago for a staff meeting. The couples house that we were at the wife was allergic to cats. Everyone wanted to know where the cat was since there was a litter box in the house. No cat! If you follow the directions closely this cake turns out looking just like a kitty litter box. The best thing is getting people to try it and everyone loved it. Too funny!

Really easy to make, but you do need to buy a new cat box & scoop.  It was a great hit at our foolish food party at work on April Fool's Day, but I had to convince people it was actually delicious.

Have made this several times over the past 10 years and everyone loves it.  As a cat lover and rescuer, my Mom made it for my Birthday yesterday and she served it on cat dishes purchased at Dollarama ... my friends each took a cat dish home.  Life is indeed good.

I followed the recipe but used some regular Oreos with the vanilla cookies so that the color would be a little more realistic.  Looks great!

I have been making this for years, and is a hit with most people (with a sense of humor).  

The pudding makes it sooo moist & tasty. 

My only word of advice is to avoid 'double stuffed' vanilla sandwich cookies.  It takes away from the crumbly litter look.

I made this recipe and i felt that for all the work I put in, the taste was very bland It looked great, I made it for a potluck at work but thank goodness I tried it first! The texture of the pudding/cake mixture would have been tolerable if it tasted better, but it didn't so it was almost inedible.

Loved the idea.  Taste not that great (tasted like a box cake without frosting).  Didn't look nearly gross enough though.  I will try again with variations...

This was a cinch to make and so much fun!!! I used 2 vanilla cake mixes and 3 butterscotch pudding cups. I crushed up a whole bag of golden oreo cookies and put food colouring drops on 1 cups worth instead of the 1/4 cup. I had a larger kitty litter pan though so it needed more and I probably should've used one more cake mix. It was still amazing!!! I made it the day before and left it in the fridge over night. It was so moist and delicious at the party the next day!! The Little Debbie brownies worked really well too. They don't harden up like the Tootsie Rolls would. Some people had a hard time eating it but those who did thoroughly enjoyed it! I'll be making it again and again :)

This cake was fun to make and everyone thought it was totally gross (in a good way).  My 8 y/o son wouldn't eat it because it looked so real. LOL. I didn't care for the taste personally but the effect was awesome.

This cake was a blast to make and I won the office Halloween potluck contest!  I used pre-made chocolate bundt cake and sugar free angel food cake for the base and used 4 small sugar free vanilla pudding cups.  I followed other suggestions to skip the liner and added crushed Butterfingers to the cake and topped with crushed peanut butter sandwich cookies.  I thought a little poo went a long way so I only used a few cat turds.  Using all pre-made ingredients helped make this a quick weeknight creation.

Made this for my mom's birthday because she loves our cat so much...we all had a good laugh! After getting past the fact that it looked gross it was a wonderful and moist recipe. I loved the idea of having the pudding in the mix to keep it moist. It was just as much fun to make :)

I work with children and make this every year for April Fool's Day.  The kids really enjoy it.  I found that crumbled marble pound cake is an easy way to avoid baking.  This way the children can help make it.  I omit the Tootsie Rolls and use strategically place chocolate chips instead.  GREAT FUN!!

I made this cake last halloween for an office party. In place of German chocolate and white cake the recipe I had found at that time used Spice cake and Butter cake.  It was a yummy combo, and the Ewww! factor you get with this cake is awesome for Halloween!

I made this cake for a Halloween party a few years ago. It was so realistic, no one wanted to try it.  Those who were brave enough loved it.

This cake is so cute and was such a hit!! I brought it to my office of Halloween...everyone had to take pictures of it before they ate any of it and I had to give the recipe to a few others at the office....they made it as well and sent me pictures...I am making it for my granddaughters birthday in a couple months....perfect for a bunch of 7 yr olds!! lol

I love this recipe.  I mixed some of the crushed colored cookies in the top inch or so of the cake where it looked more realistic and berried a few of the tootsie rolls a bit.  It taste just like the ones my aunt made for Halloween parties growing up.  Amazing!

I made this for a Halloween party when I first got my little girl. I took it to a party after work and placed it with all the rest of the food. One of the guys asked why was there a cat litter pan with the food. I told him my little girl had a kitten and it died ( weeping ) as I told the story how I just couldnt throw out the pan. ( weeping ) and took a bite of the poo. ( weeping harder ) the man ran to the bath room to throw up. By now I was laughing so hard at him, he thought I was crying real hard. He tried to comfort me asking his wife what should he do. I told him it was a joke and this year guess whos getting Kitty Litter cake for her birthday party.

The overall effect and reaction you get from this cake is priceless... The taste is only so-so. I'm pretty sure it needs a saltier flavour to compliment all the bland sweet going on. If I were to make this again, I would use peanut butter sandwich cookies and/or butterscotch pudding. I hope I have occasion to make this again. I would love it if disgusting cake was actually dreamily delicious!

LOVE this cake!! Very moist and fun to make! My kids love helping me make this and think Mommy makes the coolest cake ever. When I make this I either use French vanilla or cheese cake pudding and just regular chocolate and yellow cake mixes. Made this for a friend and on request used white and lemon cake mixes and it was delicious as well. Entered this cake in an Ugly Cake Contest and won!!! So it is now officially an award winning cake!

For more gross-out factor, make some butterscotch or pumpkin instant pudding & dribble it to simulate having a sick kitty...I've won contests using this method!

I made a cake like this once, don't remember the recipe exactly, but the only difference I noticed off the top of my head was that instead of german chocolate cake mix, the other recipe called for some kind of spice cake mix. But anyways, the cake looked just the way it was supposed to, I had made it as a joke for a local dessert beauty contest. I couldn't convince anyone that it was really cake!!! After making a double recipe, when we picked it up to bring it home, only one slice was gone, and it was sitting untouched on a friend's plate. My brother and I ate most of it (big as it was) on the way home that night. It was probably the best cake I have ever eaten, very moist and good, and I usually don't even like spice cakes! Do try this :) EDIT: Just remembered, I used some green and some blue food coloring, it really helped to have both colors :)

I made this for the Halloween office party two years ago and it was a hit to look at.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed making the little chocolate turds and green litter grains. As for taste, it was okay.  Scaled back on the pudding or else it would have been too soggy.  Taste way okay but considering what many people were seeing, they were expecting something bad and it was not.

This cake was an absolute hit!  I modified because my bf can't do chocolate, so I just made a carrot cake, crumbled and mixed with 1 box instant vanilla pudding, crushed peanut butter sandwich cookies mixed with cinnamon for color and for litter-look, and heated up and shaped little debbies brownies (only 2 packages, so 4 brownies) and formed into the lovely poo topping!  Leave the nuts on the brownies and when you bite in, it may be crunchy (uggh)!  The 2 of us giggled the whole time, what fun it was to make, and tasty to boot!

5 stars for the look of shear disgust on guests' faces. Made a better than sex cake - complete with heath bars and cool whip.  Covered the cool whip with the sandwich cookies.  Next time I would still make the better than sex cake but I would cut it to fit the litter pan.  I would then frost it versus using Cool-Whip.  Used Little Debbie brownies - they turned out better than the tootsie rolls.

I thought this was so clever..Beings my husband for got my BD, this was my ultimate revenge as his was yesterday. I didn't have a reg. litter pan, so I used a foil pan and lined it with a white plastic bag. Then set it on a tray. The bag hid the tray. 
I did not crumble my cake and made a reg. cake and put Bavarian Cream filling on the cake.  I saved some of the cream to mix with the 'litter' which was amde with peanut butter sandwish creams and vanilla Wafers.  I crumbled up quite a few together and took a small amount out and added the green food coloring. Then I took another small amount of crumbled cookies and added powdered sugar to make some white sand. I then added the filling to make the clumping of the litter and sprinkled it all over. I made the 'poop' from the Little Debby Brownies. I shaped it and put in various places. I added the scoop and put a couple of the 'turds' in the scoop. Then I sprinkled the white cookie crumbs in various places along with the green ..Everyone here had a great laugh and thought the whole thing was very tasty. The party was a great success and my husband loved it. Now, I will amke another one next week for his work..

When I tell people about this cake, they scoff.  But when I serve it they ALL come back for more and most ask if they can take some home.  That is how good it is.  It looks funy, the taste is surprisingly grand and, though it does take a while to prepare, is really delicious fun.

I love this recipe/idea. Ive made one for 2 birthdays and a high school graduation! When I made it, I didnt crumble the cake or add the pudding. It was much quicker and alot less mess to just bake the cakes, put one layer in and frost it and add the top and frost it. We used vanilla sandwich cookies one time and peanut butter the next. Was amazing! Love it!

I read many reviews and was hesitant to make the cake as stated in the recipe.  I decided to try it "as written" and was thrilled with the results.  I loved how the crumbled cake looked litter-like. I didn't add as much pudding as the recipe called for as I had very moist cakes to begin with.  The kids LOVED it!  After the "eeeewwwww" they all scarfed it down.

Really sick recipe.  Our family just couldn't eat it, eventhough it tasted very good.  I think the pooper scooper was the kicker or maybe it was the softened Tootsie Rolls....eeeegag.  I did crumble some crushed cookies on top with a little green food coloring.  I also put newspaper under the pan.

This cake is just so WRONG!! hehe.  My kids wanted to make a cake for the cats birthday and I stumbled across this funny recipe.  What fun we had making it.  After we sang to the cat my kids kept asking..mommy can we eat the poop now!  I sure hope they do not go into school and tell their teachers that mommy served them poop last night.  The only change was that I also added in a few drops of blue food coloring because our cat litter has blue and green specks in it.  I needed more cookie crumbs as well to completely cover the top.  More like one and a half packages.  So much fun.  Dont forget the pooper scooper-that was the funniest part.  I laid mine on top with a few stray poops in it.  So real looking!

I made this for my 10 year old son's birthday party.  The reaction to the cake is fantastic.  This is definitely a great Halloween cake, but next time I will go with the "idea" of the cake, but not the assembly.  It didn't have a great deal of taste, so I'll probably put a cake in the litter pan with some brown/tan icing, then sprinkle cookie crumbs and top with the terds.  I will do this again for sure, with modifications for flavor.

I made this before and it was very well received. However, I was very worried about the taste, so I baked a chocolate cake and put a few choc chips in the batter, and I used a marble  cake. I crumbled up both cakes in pieces and I sprinkled most of the white cake mix on top. I also spread a layer of Cool whip over top of the first layer of cake, then I drizzeled a little chocolate syrup over the next layer. Some crushed generic white and black oreo type of cookies were sprinkled over the top with the toostie roll poos. I would suggest reading recipes for something like Better than sex cake or others like it and then follow the recipe to make sure the desert tastes good, then I would tend to the crumbled cookies and special effects on top as you could do this type of LOOK with any flavor of cake, even a pumpkin cake.

This is one of my fav Halloween recipes. "Cat Box Cake" has been made for many parties and is always a hit. It looks so real that some people couldn't eat it, others (like me) picked out the Tootsie Rolls and snacked on them. My husband and I have had way too much fun shapeing those Tootsie Rolls & draping them over the side of the litter box, is a very disgusting touch! Have fun and enjoy!!!

This cake is so fun!  I made it for a potluck at work today.  Huge hit!  The taste is fine but it's such a novelty.  Everyone loved it and several people were so grossed out.  I had a lot of fun making it as we all did eating it.

Very gross but cute idea. My friend and I made this for her daughters' halloween party. Very easy to put together. The kids were grossed out at first but then dug right in, most went for the "poo" first.

This was such a great idea! I made in honor of my sisters cats bday. (I needed a reason to make it! LOL) It really grossed out my dad. I used a cardboard box and a kitty box liner for a realistic effect.

I made this for my daughter's 7th birthday party to go with her Kitty theme, and guests are still asking for the recipe 5 years later!  This is the best novelty recipe I've ever made: it looks absolutely revoltingly realistic, but tastes so good people ask for seconds.  You can substitute flavors on the cake & pudding & cookies, but don't skimp on the props: brand new litter box, plastic litter box liner, and scoop.  Amazing!

I made this cake for my girlfriend for valentines day with a heart made out of the poo.  She loved it and couldn't stop laughing.  Great idea.  Tastes OK, just a little mushy for my liking.

This is the funniest cake ever!  Easy to make and the kids love to pretend they are eating a piece of poo.  I throw in a few miniature Baby Ruth's also.  Halloween is on Tuesday and I already have multiple requests to bring this special treat. A big winner!!!

I took this to my in-laws' last year on Halloween.  They were truly grossed out!  The idea is great, but I must have done something wrong, because it was really mushy and not all that tasty.  So five stars for the visual effect, but only three for flavor.

As with other posters, this cake was the Hallowe'en highlight at my office last year. People were howling with laughter and wincing with disgust. Only a few braves males (plus me!) tried it, a few took pictures, definitely a hit. And it tasted great, and the leftovers lasted FOREVER! Definitely try this--even when baked in a normal cake pan without plastic liner, the effect is unforgettable and will become the stuff of legend!

I made this for my and my husband's offices on April Fool's Day.  It was a HIT at both places.  People were surprised that it actually tasted good.  Somewhat time consuming to make, but worth the effort, when you see everyone smile.  

TIP: I dyed the cookies blue, not green and used only one package of pudding and it was still quite moist.  Enjoy the laughs!

I halved the recipe, using one box of marble cake, per another reviewers suggestion.  I also used chocolate snack pack pudding, since that's what I had at home.  I used a foil roasting pan, which looks fine as a litter box, plus I baked the cake right in the pan.  Pooper scooper is an especially disgusting touch.  Great fun for halloween!  Thanks Dee!!!

I made this cake for my dad's birthday which is the day before halloween.  It was a riot.  My mom was too afraid to eat it until after I ate a piece first.

I made this for a Halloween bash about a year ago.  Everyone was grossed out by this cake they were teasing each other to eat it.  But once they did, yum! It truly does look like kitty litter!  I went to the dollar store for my props (scoop, litter box) which really added to the effect. It was also fun to make!  If you're looking for something for your guests to talk about, make this!

I made this with my daughter for a church function and we has the greatest time with this recipe!  It was really fun, expecially when we were forming the "poop", we got really creative.  Not only was it fun, but it got rave review at the church function.  Everyone loved it!!  Thanks Dee!

I took this to a costume party this year and it was a hit!  Even though everyone thought it looked gross they were digging into it - with the pooper scooper of course.  Great recipe - I'll definitely make it again.

I made this cake for a Halloween party (I went dressed as a cat).  It was an absolute hit!  Everybody was completely disguisted at how realistic it looked, especially those with cats, but almost everyone tried it and loved it!
I highly recommend this!
(Only for those folks with a sense of humor!)

It was a hit! I loved watching people’s reactions. I’ll save the litter box and scoop and make it again. I used moist cake mixes and didn’t need 2 boxes of pudding. 1 box of pudding is enough with moist cake mixes.

This made the best April fool's prank! Our cat has been pooping in the flower beds lately, so I mentioned to my sons before school that I was putting a litter box out in the garage for him. (They of course had no reason to make sure I actually did). Then in the afternoon I ran in with this box saying,  "Look how much poop is already in the litter box!" and picked one up and ate it. 
The boys loved it! I did make the poop from Little Debbie brownies and it looked a lot more realistic than most of the other photos. The taste was much better than it looked, of course. We all had two scoops of litter box apiece!

This was fun to make with my daughter. She had to make something for 3rd grade Halloween party. Her teacher asked for the “grosser the better” desert, and they would judge.. she won for the best gross looking. Not many kids tried it. You will not need two boxes of pudding mix. I wish I would’ve  read further on before mixing it in. it ended up a little on the soggy side. I did bake the cakes a day ahead and it made the mixing the cakes easy. I also used crushed gram crackers .. for the topping

So perfect for a Halloween potluck. It ended up being very realistic and it really tasted good. We increase the recipe by adding an extra white cake and it really helped a lot with the looks of it.

Made this for our office Halloween costume party and it was a hit.  

 I used the store brand cake mixes, white and Dutch chocolate.  When I put the crumbled cake in the pan, it was so small that I added a yellow cake mix.  The only green food coloring I had was neon green. Here is  a picture of the finished product.

I didn't buy a new kitty litter box.  I just washed out an old one (with scoop) that I had no use for (my beloved Maine Coon recently passed). She would have loved this cake. My  guests were none the wiser and I saved at least five bucks. This cake is a delight!! Highly recommended

It didn't taste as good as I had hoped, but it did look like a dirty cat little box.  We bought a new cat little box and scoop to top it off.  Very funny reactions

I have made this several times. I make it from scratch (pun intended) and use white cake mixed with pound cake for a better texture. I use pastry cream instead of pudding and when the guests get past the look, they all say it tastes like cookie dough cake. The tootsie rolls are usually left behind unless there are children at the party. Last year I made it for my daughter-in-laws 30th birthday. 3 people out of 30 tried it and loved it. I made it this year without the litter box and tootsie rolls and the same people devoured a double batch and asked for the recipe.. This had endless flavor combinations by changing the cake flavors and pudding flavor and the cookie flavor, I'm gonna try a chocolate one next

It’s definitely a show stopper! The impact, the first reaction is great!! The cake taste is ok. I made it exactly as recipe called for. Be careful not to over microwave the tootsie rolls as they will get too hard to eat. 10 - 15 seconds was adequate for my microwave. If I make this again I will use two white cake mixes - the chocolate mix made it too dark in color for kitty litter look.

I made this as a prank for a co-workers birthday.  It does look like kitty litter!  I did miss having frosting on the cake, but that might be my personal preference.

I crumbled the cookies in a zip lock bag and used a rolling bin.  My friend thought it was real poo.  I found a litter pan small enough to make half this recipe made by Armand and Hammer, size small. Wonderfully fun recipe I have wanted to make for years but never had the right venue till now.

My husband found a smaller kitty litter box and scooper (in bright pink) so I only made one box of party cake mix. It fit perfectly and my cat obsessed daughter and her friends loved it as her 13th birthday cake.

I told my granddaughter I was going to make this for her birthday....I did and she loved it! So easy! The only thing I did was use ready made pudding (easier)...you only need a 4 or 6 pack.  I also didn't have food coloring because I was out of town.  It's not necessary.  This cake is sooooo good, too! Very moist.  So much fun to make and then to see their reaction!!

OH! If you can't find a small enough kitty litter pan, you can always use a reusable plastic container, like GLAD.  

This is a DEFINITE cake recipe I will be making over and over!!

This is so much fun to make and tastes awesome.  Only bad thing is that it looks so realistic some people have trouble eating it.  Perfect for Halloween Parties!

This is a great prank cake, and it tastes pretty good too.  My 8 year-old grandson and I made it for his grandfather's birthday, and the whole family was 'wowed.'  One 10 year-old wouldn't even eat it.  A couple suggestions.  I used a very small kitty litter box, did not use all the cake, added prepared pudding (4 small ones - easier for the 8 year-old chef) and mixed it by feel to the right texture.  I think I would add the butterfinger to the blonde cookies to give them more zip.  I also found it very difficult to get Tootsie Rolls!  I guess they are an old-fashioned candy.  I went to 5 huge stores, and finally found a mixed bag of treats.  And it's Halloween season.  You might want to order the Tootsie Rolls ahead of time.  I didn't try the Little Debbies, because the only ones I found of those were full of walnuts and while they might have looked like "poops," the Tootsie Rolls clearly were better.  For a gag and reasonable dessert, this is fantastic.

I'm giving this five stars for the idea, but I didn't follow the cake recipe. I made this for a small birthday party, so it would have been way too much cake for us as is. I made a yellow cake in a lasagna pan (a little bigger than a 13X9 and much deeper) and layered that with chocolate pudding. Then I did the crushed cookies and tootsie rolls on top. It looked great and came out delicious. Thanks so much for sharing!

I have made this several times for my kids at school, ages 5-11. They always love it. It actually tastes really good!! I do a few things differently to make it easier. I use a mix  of green and blue sugar with  the crushed cookies to eliminate the food coloring. Also I have much better luck with Little Debbie Cosmic Brownies for the turds. I pick off the colored candies, cut a 1/2 inch piece off the narrow end, roll it in my hands. It only takes a second.

Everyone loved it! The best part was the one person who refused to try it because it looked to realistic.
I used three cake mixes, and premade pudding.

Great cake to get party talking! Only thing is, even I who made it , could not eat more than 3 forks full. I was the only one that ate a tootsie roll. Most went in garbage. Still fun!

I love this recipe - I make this low carb with Carbquick and Splenda which mean I have to make a vanilla and chocolate cake from scratch then use and sugar free cookies and sugar free pudding, but the results are worth it: a gross halloween cake that taste great and has the benefits of being low carb

Tons of laughs at party. Because the appearance is what's most catching about this cake, I will do the following short cuts: after baking the cakes, crumble and pour into litter box; pour just one 3.5 oz pudding box over cake as amount called for was way too much and made cake soggy; after separating the 1/4 cup cookie crumbs, squeeze a few drops of green food coloring on the side of the dish and stir; use chopped butterfinger bars after pouring rest of cookies on cake; use Little Debbie brownies instead of tootsie rolls. Rated 4 stars as I felt the original instructions were too laborious.

This cake LOOKS awesome!
I prepared as directed, but next time I will do it a little differently. As is, it is very bland-and tootsie rolls are only good for decoration, who wants to eat tootsie rolls with cake? I like another reviewers idea of adding a container of chocolate frosting, I think it really needs that. Also, I may use mini Snicker bars mixed in and figure out how to make it a chocolate peanutbutter flavored cake instead of plain chocolate and vanilla. Over all A for presentation, but C for flavor.

This is a great Halloween cake recipe. I will definitely get rid of chocolate cake mix and opt for another whited mix. It's entirely too dark. I've made it before and it turned out great. This time it was all dark. Great recipe though.

So glad to find this recipe for this after losing mine. Came out wonderfully. Did not use liner, and I used yellow cake because that was all I had and it still came out great. I used a little more green food color in my cookie crumbles and used all of the pudding. Like someone else mentioned, I mixed pudding in right away.

I have made this several times.  You will get mixed reactions.  Some will dive right in, some will pass and some will be selective.  They will eat the litter but not the poop.  Also a variation I have done is to make it with out the poop and put in drink umbrella's a candy that looks like starfish etc. or just the umbrellas.  Make it look like beach.  Use your imagination.

I have done this for my mother in laws bday cake! She thought it was hilarious and we have inside jokes about her and her cats litter boxes that made this just perfect!!!    I am a cupcake baker and so I of course used cupcakes instead! Her favorite flavor I make is my Raspberry Lemonade cupcakes. I baked, filled, and frosted the cupcakes then lined them up in a dish pan. I took a lemon sheet cake I baked separately and crumpled all over the cupcakes to cover and hide them. Then I took the tootsie rolls, rolled them in my hands to shape them and scattered them. I included a picture on the photo page as well. Under porsha8390. But it worked very well and I didn't have the mess of cutting or scooping cake slices out of the odd shaped dish pan. **note: I used a dishpan because I didn't want to buy a huge $9 litter box- I knew she wouldn't reuse the box**

My Girl Scout troop loved this April Fool's Day dessert a few years back. They thought it looked totally gross but since they made it themselves and saw exactly what went in it, they had no problem eating it.

I found it odd to use a chocolate cake mix for this. I have never seen dark brown kitty litter. And for the use of 2 boxes of vanilla pudding mix is a bit much. One would suffice, as you said in the recipe, Moist, not soggy!
 Other than that, it has been a riot as I got to make it with my 7yo and 5yo Godsons. They had a blast rolling out 'kitty leftovers'.

This cake was a big hit at my Halloween Party. I didn't use the litter pan or pooper scooper because that was to gross but I followed the recipe just like it said and everyone loved the taste.

I've made this many times. Always a gross hit. My daughter is in charge of the poop. This time she totally melted one tootsie roll so she litterally (ha) painted it on the side of the box, much to my dismay. Then she took the black Halloween cat and backed him up next to the litter box. YUKKO -- too realistic. I'll get a pic one of these years.

My husband was totally grossed out when I made this for a work Halloween party...but everyone at work LOVED it.  This was actually the biggest hit and people couldn't stop talking about it and taking pictures!  I made it pretty much as is except I used the brownies as well. It was going to sit for awhile and I didn't want the tootsie rolls to break a tooth.  I found this a bit dry even though I used 2 large boxes of the vanilla pudding.  It was also hard to stir but over all a very easy recipe for a beginner like me!

I have made this cake for work at Halloween a few times. First time it was hardly touched because it looks so real. That was ok because it was eaten at home. People at work just didn't know what they missed, lol. Then I took it again the following year and more was eaten as word got around of how good it was despite the look. I have been asked to bring it to the potluck at work this year. So going to do it and see how much is left, lol. I'm really hoping that I get to bring some home.

I made this last year and everyone just loved it! They've asked me to make it again this year. The only difference is I use SF cake mixes, SF pudding, and I also take the frosting out of the cookies. But I do that to make mice to put on another cake. YUM!

This cake is disgusting but delicious!! lol I made it for a Halloween Party that my husband, son and I went to and it was a huge hit....however, it looked so gross and realistic that only a couple people tried any haha!! Only 2-3 scoops were missing when we went to leave the party....Highly recommended, this is very fun and it does taste really yummy too! I used golden oreos for the sandwich cookies.

great recipe. I also used 3 cake mixes due to the size of the cat box (or downsizing of mixes). 2 whit & 1 german choc but used 1 vanilla & 1 banana pudding to make it more interesting. it was a huge hit once they got passed the way it looked :-)

I just made the cake tonight but have a question if anyone can answer:  I'm not serving it until tomorrow, so do I refrigerate it until then?  I'm concerned about the pudding in it, but also concerned the Tootie Rolls will get too hard.  Thoughts?

Presentation was awesome! Taste was ok. I actually used the Little Debbie brownies. Smashed and rolled they looked perfect!  I made Halloween eve dinner for 6 teens and 6 adults. This cake was the talk of the night. Thanks!

This cake took a little bit of work, but it was well worth it.  I made two changes with this recipe.  I used already made pudding instead of the instant vanilla pudding mix. The mix in the box clumped on me while cooking.  I also didnt add as many tootsie rollls.  Just a few pieces on the top of the cake.   It was sooo funny to see  the reactions of people when they saw this cake.  They thought it was real.

I gave this 3 stars because I made lots of changes.  I was preparing this at the last minute and couldn't make it to the store so I didn't have the ingredients on hand.  I had to make a chocolate and a white cake from scratch.  For the crumbs on top I made sugar cookies and ground those up real fine.  I also thought it would be dry without some kind of frosting on the cakes so I just put some Hershey's fudge on the top instead of adding the pudding.  I also didn't have any tootsie rolls but I did have little Debbie brownies so I rolled those up into the turds.  I am so happy I did because I thought the tootsie rolls would be to hard and chewy for a cake.  After all of that it was fantastic.  I took this to a Halloween party and everyone thought it was cool.

This cake has been served at so many Girl Scout parties and personal parties - I don't have to follow the recipe anymore. This has been specifically requested for each event we have attended. There are no leftovers to bring home!

What a hit this was with a bunch of 9 year old boys and the B-day boy's little sister!  It makes a lot of cake . . . more than we needed, but the reaction it got was priceless!

it really does look just like the picture!  what a great cake--the look itself was enough for my eleven year old boy to reconsider eating it!  (dont worry, he ate it!)  the cake was a snap to make--the only modification was I used the full white cake and only about 1/2 of the chocolate cake.  What a hoot!  thanks for sharing!

the overall effect of this cake is great! I made it for my daughter's birthday party, all the girls were grossed out and thought it was great at the same time. I used cherry chip and rainbow chip cake mixes for this and white oreos my daughter doesn't like pudding either so I mixed it together with buttercream frosting, I found it very messy to make, but the girls really liked it so I guess thats all that matters right?! will probably make again for halloween.

followed this recipe loosely, turned out great, but would use spice cake instead of chocolate for color change.

I was so excited to try this, but the results were not as I expected. First it made so much, two cakes is a lot. I thought the chocolate cake did not look like the kitty litter, I did not see using chocolate. The poo looked great. Only need to micro the tooties a few seconds, and they were easy. I threw away so much, it was not worth it, but the taste was ok.

This cake looks so realistic!  Had a great time with it!  So easy to make!  Recipe is very "forgiving" & like others, you can basically make whatever cake you want underneath.  I will definately make this again!  Thank you!

Awesome recipe to bring to parties.  Catches everyones eye and becomes the talk of the party.  I made this twice this year.  The first time to celebrate our kitten's first birthday with the kids and then by special request to bring to a halloween party.  Thank you for the great recipe. It also tastes good if you can get over the gross factor.  Had fun eating it in front of my 4 and 6 year old.  They thought it was disgusting looking.

I had this at my daughter's first birthday party.  It had a great visual impact and I would make it again for Halloween or a kids party.  However, I thought it just tasted okay, not great.  I definitely think "Mud" tastes better.  It was still fun and easy.

It was a GREAT hit with my 5th graders! The reaction alone is a worth 5 stars!!  However, I'm going to rate it on taste... it was a little rich and kind of dry.  I did not deviate from the recipe one bit.  Next year, I'll try the recommendations of others.  Thanks for the INCREDIBLY fun recipe!!!!!!!!!  My students LOVED it!!

I made this for a Halloween carnival last year as part of our "gross foods" table, and it was such a hit! A lot of people refused to try it, but those that did thought it tasted great. I've been asked to make it again this year, and I can't wait to do it again!

UPDATE - remade for my my son's preschool class & did 2 marble cakes, creamy chocolate frosting mixed with 2 boxes (of made up) box chocolate pudding with the Oreo vanilla cream cookies on top & the teachers said it was really good!  Some kids did eat it & said it was good & asked me to make it again!  Love this fun/gross cake!  1st review:  Made for work & got lots of "yucks" and laughs at the gross factor.  I made a chocolate cake & used chocolate frosting as one had suggested to make it more like a cake.  Used graham crackers on top.  Although I got lots of compliments on the appearance, I will probably cut the cake vertically next time and put in a layer or pudding to spice it up.  I also think that I would use the vanilla sandwich crackers and be sure to use the green food coloring.  I was not a big fan of the graham crackers on top.

I tried this, but what I did to make it a better cake (for those who are not real chocolate fans) I used a spice cake, white cake, and yellow cake. I found it to be delightful.

I love this recipe...I have to make it a lot for our youth pastor. I use a spice cake instead of the German chocolate, and on occasions our kitty has spelled out words with her droppings!!! This is simple and my daycare kids love to help mix it all up!!!

This was perfect for our annual halloween party. It looked absolutely disgusting and we had a great time making the tootsie roll terds. I rated it 4 stars because the taste was just okay. I will definitely use the concept again next year, but maybe a different kind of cake.

This was so fun to make and was a hit at our family Halloween party.  I liked that this cake wasn't really rich, because with all the candy and treats at Halloween we didn't need a rich cake.  I would make this again!

I make this cake every year for Halloween.  It looks so disgusting and realistic that most people won't touch it! I definitely recommend serving it in the kitty litter box with a kitty litter scoop.  Also, hang some of the half melted tootsie rolls over the side to make it look like the cat almost missed the box.

Made this and it got some laughs but some were too turned off to eat it.  Probably because they know I have cats!

I used angel food cake, cookies and pistachio pudding, no liner, but did use the new pan and scooper.  Very realistic!

Gorgeously disgusting looking cake. No one wanted to eat it because it was so realistic. My 5 year old nephew even started crying when we tried to make him eat "cat poop"! Once people actually ate it they liked the taste. I was too grossed out to finish it, as the texture is bizarre. This is a keeper.

This was awesome, I made it for a halloween party and once everyone got past the way it looked they loved the moist cake. I made sure not to crumble it too small and sparingly used the green food dye.  The tootsie rolls I used the full size ones and just gave them a little shaping while they were warm.

This was the most fun recipe I have ever done!  I took it to a Halloween potluck at work last year and even though a few people thought it was too gross to eat, those who tried it loved it. It looks so much like a real litter box; especially with the tootsie rolls!

I've made this cake twice, once with all the kitty poo flair and it was delicious but too many people were grossed out and there was a lot left (more for me)...the second time I made the basic recipe but didn't add the poo or put it in a litter box, I used m&m's on top instead for color fun and it was a big hit.  Will definitely make it again.

Great recipe!  I made it for an adult camp out.  Too many tootsie rolls for my taste, so I only put in half a bag and added chopped walnuts and coconuts for added texture and flavor.  It is incredibly authentic!!

Not owning a cat & only smelling the litter boxes of friends cats when we visit.  The cake must have been very realistic.  No one at the family halloween party would try the cake untill I told them what it was made of.  Great Idea!!

The cake was a success!  Too much of a success though,  I had a birthday/halloween party for my son and only the girls (ages 8-10yrs) would try it!!  The boys (ages 7-9yrs)were too grossed out to try and eat it!! But definitely a memory maker!!  Halloween is suppose to be gross and scarey!

This cake looks very realistic (therefore = truly disgusting looking). I've made this twice, for a halloween work party and for my brothers birthday, and both times it was a hit. It's easy, and tastes really good once you get past the appearance. Some people had a hard time eating the tootsie rolls ;).

I didn't know how this was going to turn out. I made it
for my Halloween birthday treat at work and everyone loved it!
While making it, when I got to the part of melting the tootsie
rolls, I sat in my kitchen and giggled to myself. It was so much
fun to make! --and eat!

What a riot!  I made this cake for my sister's birthday.  I had it sitting on my kitchen floor.  She laughed sooooo hard when she saw it, we forgot to sing Happy Birthday.  Superisingly, it tasted pretty good too, if you can eat it. lol.  Thanks for the recipie Dee.

I did this cake as a joke for work last year, and people are still talking about it! What a hoot!
