I didn't have enough cream cheese to make my regular cheesecake so I tried this recipe.  Excellent!  Easy!  I left out the lemon and topped with cherry pie filling.  I ended up baking for about 35 minutes.  Take it out while the center is just jiggly.  Also try putting a large pan of water in the oven while preheating and baking.  The moist oven helps cut down on cracks.  Turn the oven off and let the cheesecake sit in the oven while it cools off to help avoid cracking.  Another reviewer mentioned having trouble with lumps in the cheesecake.  The cream cheese needs to be at room temperature before creaming with the sugar.  That should take care of the lumps. Great recipe and not nearly as time consuming as a traditional cheesecake.

This cheesecake is beyond compare !!!! So creamy and it tastes like you have been baking it for hours. To those who say that the filling doesn't fill the pie crust up try this; After you have put in all your ingredients into your bowl, beat it with a stand mixer or a hand mixer for a least 12 to 15 min, believe me when I say "it will be worth your time" and dedication. Also, use a water bath, of boiling water. Fill  the pan up only to the half way point of your cheesecake. If you over feel the pan your cheesecake will be a total lost I learned that from a friend, but it was a good laugh. Than when the  time is up turn the oven off and let the cheesecake sit in the oven until the oven is cold. Oh yea I toped my cheesecake off with a sauce that I made from strawberries this summer.If I could give it more stars I would.

This is a very easy recipe, and it comes out very creamy and tasty. Just cut back on the sugar, otherwise it will be very sweet (I've been using half a cup of sugar instead of the recommended 3/4, and it's just perfect). I also skipped the lemon zest and everybody loved it!

This was good...unfortunately I have already tried Chantal's New York Cheesecake from this site....and it was absolutley delicious.  I truly liked that one better, but this was good too.  I don't think this was as creamy even with mixing it for 15 minutes...and the flavor wasn't as intense as we would have liked.  Thanks for the post.

Fabulous!  I changed the recipe a bit: I omitted the lemon, used fat-free cream cheese, and topped it with light cherry pie filling. It turned out wonderful! Perfect for those who love a creamy, light, but not cakey cheesecake..it didn't get super-firm. My whole family loved it even though I made it with fat-free cream cheese; they couldn't believe it when i told them! I will definitely make this again.

This was my first time making a cheesecake and everyone loved it!  It was absolutely delicious and creamy.  I took some of the advice listed and omitted the lemon zest and also let the pie cool in the oven for about 1/2 hour before removing it and letting it cool completely outside on my countertop before putting it in the fridge.  By doing this I avoided cracks on my cheesecake.  I'm already getting requests to make another one. Thanks Karin for a great and easy recipe.

My oldest son and I made this cheesecake together. We made the graham cracker crust from scratch and we used reduced fat cream cheese for the cheesecake. This was very simple for his first foray into cheesecake--we all were quite pleased with the results. I made a mixed berry topping to spread over the top, it was excellent. It's already half gone.......my husband had "extra" late last night.

Simple,basic recipe...comes out a little too flat,if you want a higher cheesecake you have to double the recipe. I made a homemade graham craker crust and added some small choc. chip morsels.

I make this creamy cheesecake all the time with a graham crust purchased.  The difference is I add 1/2 cup of sour cream to it.  It is sooo delicious this way and i have made it sooo many times.

We used extra lemon zest (because zesting is just that much fun!) and it was delicious.  The cooking process took slightly longer than the recipe recommended but I believe this is because I put the rack too high in the oven.

Without question, this is the easiest and best cheesecake recipe I have found to date. It is so creamy and so super easy. I did follow the tip to beat it with a stand mixer for 12 to 15 minutes and I did use a water bath. Absolutely fabulous! One little aside - I made an extra cake in a square pan. After cooling, I cut the cake into little squares, plopped them in cupcake papers and froze them in a plastic container. Now, I can take out one or more squares at any time and enjoy delicious cheesecake with no mess. Thanks so much Karin for this great recipe.

This basic, standard cheesecake recipe was just what I was after. I knew instantly that 3/4 cup sugar was too much; I reduced it to 1/2 cup and it was fine.  I wanted this as a lemon cheesecake so I reduced the vanilla to a teaspoon while increasing the lemon zest to a hefty teaspoon.  I baked this in a mini cheesecake pan, using a ground almond/butter/sugar crust.  I topped them with fresh lemon curd and served them with fresh raspberry sauce (not that that was necessary at that point).  These were fine restaurant dessert-cart worthy - elegant as well as refreshingly, citrusy delicious.

This made my husband so happy it ought to be illegal. Is it the best cheesecake? No. But its VERY good, and VERY easy to make on a weeknight. I also used low fat cream cheese, reduced fat crust, and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. Still excellent, even with some of the calories missing :-)

I followed this recipe exactly to a T. I didn't do a water bath. I didn't leave it in the oven. It didn't crack or fall -- I was so pleased. I topped it with a simple combo of sliced stawberries and sugar, and then added whipped cream on top. Now, I am headed to the gym ...

I'd like to put half a star more though... It's just that with the orginal recipe and the 9 inch pan it was too thin..! The texture was perfect so I don't think I missed or passed on cooking or heat... I just added 4 oz more of cream cheese and 1/2 egg more. I also beat the eggwhites first, then the egg yolks and a little sugar, then alternately add the softened cheese and remaining sugar. Everyone loves it! Thanks for posting such a delicious creamy, rich recipe!

This recipe was so light and fluffy, and very tasty! I made mine in a smaller 8inch round spring form pan so it would have a little height, but because of that, I had to increase the cooking time to 1 hour. The texture was so fluffy, that it was very appealing for me because I am not a cheesecake fan ( I made it for my husband) and the density of some, can be overwhelming. Over all, this is a great basic recipe, and can be added upon to change things up a bit.

This was SO easy to make, and SO creamy and delicious. I didn't even bother to top it with anything :) I had a graham cracker crust to use up and am so glad I found this recipe. It took a little longer than half an hour to cook for me.

Delicious and easy. Cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. I also had to cook it for an additional 20 mins for it to firm up, then chilled for 5 hrs. Will definitely make again!

I love this recipe, it was so easy and quick, and my family loved it!  I omitted the lemon zest, only because I had no lemons, and used a small amount of lemon extract in it's place.  I also will anilla sugar instead of regular sugar if I happen to be short on Vanilla...I also on one occaison used chocolate cream cheese...just yumm!

Great recipe if you have no idea how to do it. This was the case with me. I searched and saw alot of different recipes, but could not figure out what was special about each so went for simplicy and it proved to be a great decision. I will try other recipes, but this works great. Thanks Karin.

I usually make more involved cheesecakes but I wanted something simple for a change. I met a great bunch of ladies and I have taken this cheesecake to them twice and each time it was gobbled up. I've also made my family this recipe twice & they loved it too. It's definitely simple and it's creamy, as the title claims. My 4 year old daughter can easily help prepare this since there is not much prep work. It's now my go-to cheesecake recipe when I'm on the go. Be sure to work with room temp ingredients though. I don't think it's mentioned anywhere in the instructions.

Loved this cheesecake!  It was very creamy and very delicious!  This was my first time making a cheesecake and I followed the very simple directions and made a BIG HIT with my family!  I didn't use the lemon zest because I didn't have any but it didn't make a difference because it was still awesome!!!  After making this simple and awesome tasting cheesecake, I feel like I'm ready for "Top Chef".  LOL  You've got to try it!  If you think you're 'baking challenged', try this cheesecake and you won't disappoint yourself or anyone else! :)  Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe! GOD Bless yoU!!! :)

I've never ever baked a cheesecake of any sort before and I sure am glad I found this recipe! I did cut the sugar down to 1/2 C per other reviews. And, I beat the mix for a little better than 10 minutes. I'm not sure why? There were no lumps in the mix after 3-4 minutes, maybe even before that. I used a blueberry topping and we sure did enjoy this. Thanks Karin for sharing!

Absolutely loved it!!! I didn't have lemon zest,  so I used a bit of lemon juice. And I swirled in some raspberry preserves. I've never had such a creamy cheesecake before. Yumm!

I followed suggestions and decreased sugar to half a cup, beated mixture for quite a while with my mixer and then put a shallow dish of water in the oven while preheating.  This turned out a perfect light textured cheesecake.

This is the same recipe my mom has used for years, but hers calls for 1 tsp lemon juice instead of zest and has a sour cream topping.  (Also hers says to bake 40 minutes and cool five hours.)  I have made it several times and it's easy and delicious, the only problem is that is never lasts long!  I prepare it with Graham Cracker Crust II from this website.

Soooo good and very creamy. I let mine cool in the oven with the oven turned off after 20 minutes. Not a crack in sight! I also cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup. Very good!

This is a great cheesecake.  Its really, really quick.  The only problem I had was that it was a bit too lemony for my tastes, but I adjusted that the second time by reducing the amount of lemon peel.

I made this for dessert on Christmas Eve, it was amazing - rave reviews from everyone.  Thanks for sharing it, Karin! 

For the crust, I used 1 1/4 c. graham crumbs, 1/4 c. butter, 1 tbsp. white sugar about 1/4 c. crushed pecans, and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Baked at 350 for ten minutes, then allowed to cool before putting the cheesecake mixture in.  

Turned out delicious, I just wished I had a bit more time to let it cool in the oven (with the oven off) to prevent cracking....but there were pies waiting in line for the oven, so them's the breaks!

This was the first cheesecake I have ever made, so I didn't really know what to expect.  I put just a splash of lemon juice instead of the zest (because I didn't have any).  And even though I baked it for at least 35 minutes, the middle still wasn't done.  Next time I will try leaving it in the oven as others have suggested.  Great flavor and tastes great with the Blueberry Sauce from this site!

A great, easy cheesecake. I use a store bought graham cracker crust to save time, and omitted the lemon zest. Definitely make sure to soften the cream cheese well before mixing, otherwise you'll end up with lumps. Also, I had to bake mine for much longer than the listed 25 minutes. In all it took about 45 minutes in the oven and even then it still looked jiggly. It ended up setting fine so I'm not sure what happened. Either way, this is a great recipe!

One of the best cheesecakes we've had.  I made my own graham cracker crust and baked this in a springform pan.  After the 25 minutes of baking, I turned off the oven and left the cheesecake in for about an hour.  I had no cracks and a very creamy cheesecake.  I topped mine with some leftover lemon buttercream frosting and fresh strawberries.  It was delicious!

This was such a wonderful cheesecake...definitely recommend.  It is a fluffier cheesecake, not a dense or thick cheesecake like some might prefer.  I brought this to the beauty school and it was eaten before our first break!!

Everyone loved it!  I did not add the lemon zest.  It is very sweet but taste great.  It cooled overnight in the fridge then we added cherry pie filling on top.

I have made much more elaborate and time consuming cheesecake recipes in the past, but this one is just as good and so much easier!  Super creamy!  I substituted splenda for the sugar.  The second time I made this, I used almond extract instead of vanilla. Yum! You cant go wrong with this one!

Loved this cheesecake! Just what I'd been looking for! Creamy without being runny; fluffy without being too dense! Now, I can't wait to make it again and play with other flavors added! Oh, and I did as other reviewers mentioned - beat 10-15 minutes and added pan of water in oven during preheat and baking. Delicious cheesecake!!

This is just like the recipe i use for mini cheesecake cupcakes on this site...i omit the lemon and use half cup sugar and only 1 tsp vanilla becuase i dont like it too sweet. i bought some strawberry topping because i was too lazy to make my own... i havent even finished cooling it yet but it tastes great!!  it was so easy with the storebought crust and topping, and i also used fat free cream cheese. as for chantals cheesecake i tried that one -- it was good but nto great or maybe i did somethign wrong. the only thing i took away a star for is that its a bit TOO creamy and soft, i like creamy and a little bit firm so i might add sour cream next time

**This was fantastic! I cut the amount of sugar to 1/2cup which was perfect. I added a tiny bit of almond extract and the 2tsps of vanilla. This is a wonderful simple and versatile cheesecake; you can drizzle chocolate or caramel sauce or even fruit.

this recipie should tell you how to take care of the cream cheese lumps otherwise it stinks. my family said it was good but the lumps were very different. and one more thing use 4 egg whites instead of 2 eggs it makes the cheesecake whiter and not so fattening. bye and enjoy

I took this to a family Christmas gathering and got good reviews.
I agree with some of the others though, a little too much lemon for my taste.  The lemon taste was not bad, just not what I expected.  I would use this recipe again, I would just reduce or omit the lemon.
Very easy to make!

I tried this recipe for thanksgiving and it turned out ok. I tried it again tonight and adjusted the recipe and it came out great! I used three pkgs of cream cheese instead of two, one cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cups, 3 eggs instead 2 and a tsp of lemon juice instead of zest or extract. I also baked for 30 min and it was not flat nor were there cracks!

The "extra creamy" taste described is just that it's a bit undercooked in this recipe.  The edges were a "normal" cheesecake consistency, which I like better.  That said, many people seem to like the gooier filling, and it is a delicious and simple recipe, similar to other "cheese pies" and simple cheesecakes.  4 stars for the cheese/egg/sugar ratios (I flavored with 1 tsp. vanilla and 2 tsp. lemon extract) and I would make a similar cheesecake again, but add 10-15 minutes to the cooking time.

This was so easy!  I used a shortbread crust, put a pan of water under the pies, and turned off the oven after 40 minutes (for 2).  Never made cheesecake (except from a box) but this is the one I am sticking to!

I'm a huge cheesecake fan, but oddly enough, this was my first time making it. Being from New York, I've had some of the best cheesecake around. After a couple of alterations (only 1/2 cup of sugar, no lemon zest), the end result was lovely! It's such a simple recipe, but it definitely compares to some of the best cheesecake I've had.

The very best cheesecake I've ever made/eaten!!!  I didn't have the lemon zest or extract and I made my own graham cracker crust!  I did put a pan of water in the oven when I pre-heated the oven and baked for 35 minutes instead of 25.

Awesome cheesecake! Quick and super simple! I omitted the lemon since the hubby is not big on anything lemon. After 25 minutes of baking @ 350, it wasn't done. I turned off the oven and continued to 'bake' it as the oven cooled. It came out perfectly!

Very basic but great cheesecake! I omitted lemon zest however because I was going to make strawberry cheesecake. I think this is great for starters.  I have been using this cheesecake for years and have added chocolate chips, caramel, and pecans before and it made a great turtle cheesecake.

It is a very good cheesecake - thick and creamy, but it wasn't anything spectacular for me.  My husband rated it a 4-star.  I baked it for the 25min, but then left in my oven as the oven cooled for about 30min and it came out perfectly cooked.

This recipe is super easy!  If I forget to use tricks to eliminate cracking,  I cover the cheesecake with chocolate syrup drizzles, carmel syrup, and snikers candy bar chunks. Yummy and pretty! Sometimes I substitute lemon juice for the lemon zest.

This recipe is super easy to make, literally fool-proof.  I always get complimented whenever I make this and people are shocked at how unbelievably easy it is to make.  It's not too sweet so it's easy to dress it up with any fruit toppings.  The only alteration is I find it takes more than 25 minutes to bake; I usually bake it for 40-45 minutes.

5 stars for ease, 5 stars for taste, 5 stars for ability to customize to your taste! I made one lemon, the other I added about 1 tsp of raspberry flavoring, added about 1/4 cup cocoa and garnished with raspberry jam that had been warmed in microwave. Drizzle a little of melted chocolate chips over that and wha la! It went over so well, and it took so little time! Thanks so much for such a easy, tasty, versitile recipe !!!

We made this cheesecake for Sunday dessert! Easy and very creamy! I added 1/4 cup of canned peach juice in the light syrup and cut the vanilla down to 1 teaspooon! Great flavor! When it was finished cooking, I added peach slices and added 2 tablespoons of spiced rum to the peach juice and drizzled it over the top. Awesome dessert!

KARIN! you're a GENIUS!
I had neer made a cheesecakre before, I was always so intimidated, no this recipe is great and soo easy. I was able to triple it with no issues. I was worried about a soggy crust so I put a pan of water one rack under the cake, no cracks, no soggy crust!
I am making another one as I write this review! THANK YOU so much for the easy and wonderful recipe. I honestly can't tell you how much my family loved it! and they are PICKY.

I registered as a member just to rate this recipe.  It was wonderful.  I love cheesecake and have never successfully made one, that is until now.  I used a chocolate cookie crust, and added in about 1/3 cup of honey to replace the sugar.  I whipped it for at least 10 minutes as suggested by another review, it was very rich and creamy.  I also cooked it in a water bath.  If you are looking for a simple cheese cake try this one, it's worth it.

Wow this was REALLY good!  I used half a cup of sugar like others suggested and it was still sweet enough.  I also used an oreo cookie crumb pie crust and topped it with whip cream and strawberries.  Five stars for sure!!

Simple ingredients and very easy to make, with a suprising result: It tastes so much nicer than the cheesecakes sold in cafes or bakeries. I omitted vanilla to focus on the mild flavor of lemon only. Should reduce the sugar though; 1/2 cup is sweet enough.

This is my first go at cheesecake and it came out as promised, smooth and creamy.  I used yuzu citron in place of the lemon and reduced sugar as suggested by others.  Also used the pan of water in the oven per other comments and had no cracks.  Will definitely make again.

This is a easy recipe!!  From previous experiences I added alittle bit of eagle brand condensed milk and I didn't have any lemon zest so I just used alittle lemon juice.  People can't get enough of this when I make it.  My friends won't even eat cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory cause they say its not as good as what I make!!  I've also made it with splenda instead of sugar and turned out well.

This was truly creamy! I omitted the lemon zest, added about 8 oz sour cream and reduced the sugar to half a cup. Mixed for a good 5-10 minutes. No water bath required, baked for 35 minutes and there were no cracks! Superb!!

It turned out very well.  I added the zest from the lemons, vanilla and put 1/4C sour cream in the batter.  The use of sweetened condensed milk here was genius.   The mouth feel is silky and it stays moist without the water bath.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The texture was unusual. It did not have that typical delicious cheesecake flavor. My husband seemed to think it was okay, though. I will remove it from my recipe box and look for another recipe.

My whole Family loved this!! I didn't have all the cream cheese I needed so I used a cup of yogurt that I put through a cheese cloth, and it worked very well! It was creamy and soft. I didn't put in the lemon zest, I just left it plane and topped it with melted chocolate.

This tastes great and was easier than even cheesecake out of a box. I will omit the lemon zest on the next round and play with different flavors.

I followed the advice of others and mixed the ingredients for 15 min. This defiantly made the mixture much smoother.  I also reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup and added lemon extract instead of the zest.  Topped it with caramel sauce and whipped cream!  Delish, this is a keeper recipe, much easier than the other bake cheesecakes I have made in the past.

Wonderful experience! 
Easy and delicious!
I used a Toaster Oven and Blender, which made it so effortless for an Octogenarian!I did add a half cup of Sour cream,as suggested by another review, 1tsp of Vanilla and 1 Tsp lemon juice, and cut back sugar to 1/2 cup..I so enjoy the review of your recipes...I used the Blender on lowest setting and all ingredients were at room temperatures..Also prepared a reduction of fresh strawberries,sugar,vanilla and water, which will be spooned on top when served.Many thanks for this fine recipe..PJG

This is very close to my go-to cheesecake recipe. Mine uses 1/4 C less sugar, 1 tsp less vanilla & no lemon. The lemon adds a nice touch of tanginess. I'd love to try it with lime.

This was a quick and easy recipe for a really delicious and smooth cheesecake. I added a little bit of almond extract and it was great. I will make it without next time, and maybe try a strawberry topping!

Delicious and Creamy just like I wanted.  I made it for Christmas, left out the lemon, and only used 1/2 cup of sugar. Toped it with cherries.   It was so good it was gone before I knew it.  So easy to make.  Love it.....Wela5

I did the recipe as was except for the lemon peel cause I didn't have any lemon but I had lemon juice so I used 1 table spoon of that. Other than I followed to a T and got quite a few compliments on how good it was. I paired this with a home made graham crust from this website too; soooo good. Thanks, will be making this again for Christmas.

I would give this more stars if I could!  I have been making this for 10 years.,This has become my go-to cheesecake. Love it! I use low fat cream cheese and add 8 oz. low fat sour cream or Greek yogurt to have it even creamier. The lemon zest and the vanilla are essential! The problem is it never lasts...Sometimes I add a reduction of fresh strawberries as a topping. Yummy!

It tastes like a lemon cheesecake. Tart and delicious. I baked my cheesecake for about 45 minutes before it was done. Also, I put 1/3 cup sugar instead of 3/4 cup. Next time, I shall bake longer and put 75% less lemon zest.

This recipe is ok. I usually make Krafts New York Style cheesecake but I didn't have all the ingredients. This will work for tonight but I won't be making it for guests. I probably should have read reviews and reduced the amount of sugar.

The cheesecake was very good, and while it didn't have a distinct flavor, it was creamy and delicious. It did take longer than 8 hours to set (about 12.) I recommend blueberries on top of the cheesecake, but put them on after the cheesecake sets. I used "Graham Cracker Crust I" and was very pleased with the results alongside the cheesecake.

I love this cheesecake.  I never seem to have lemon zest or extract so I use 1/4 t. Almond flavoring.  I bake it for 30 minutes and I use Graham cracker crust I from this site.  I never have to buy any gift for my sister in law anymore cause all she ever asks me for is this cheesecake. To prevent cracking, I put a pan of water in the oven while it is preheating.

I made this with a homemade chocolate graham cracker crust and added layers of caramel. I had to bake it for more than the recommended 25 minutes and used lemon juice instead of lemon zest but overall it came out delicious. I will def make this again. great and easy recipe

Amazing! This recipe is so easy to follow. It came out super good. I only added 1/2 cup of sugar and it came out delicious. I also forgot to buy the prepared graham crust, so I just made my own graham cracker crust and used a spring form pan and it came out just fine. It was really creamy!

I've been making this cheesecake for 3 years now.  It always gets rave reviews and my husband's family looks forward to it at every holiday dinner.  I made 1 small change though.  I thought the lemon flavor was really overwhelming so I have used almond extract in place of the lemon.

I loved this recipe! I used frozen cream cheese and it worked wonderfully. I also used a premade crust that you buy in the store. Super easy!

This cheesecake has the most amazing texture! So creamy! I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and baked it in a 10-inch graham cracker crust for the same amount of time. It still worked fine for me.

Ideal beginners cheesecake. Made a crust of 2cps crushed graham crackers, ½cp brn sugar, ½cp butter and a tsp. of cinnamon and that added a touch of heaven to an already good recipe. Great starting point for other flavors.

This recipe yields such creamy, decadent, and rich cheesecake. Yet it's so simple that anyone can do it! I substituted lemon zest with orange zest and it turned out to be delicious too. In addition, I used Neufchatel "cream" cheese that contains 1/3 less fat than normal cream cheese and the cake still tasted rich and creamy, just as cheesecake should. Yum!

It was very good, for a quick and easy cheese pie dessert. Add an extra grate of lemon. I have also changed extracts and prepared pie shells. Make sure you beat well and as all cheese cakes bake it in a water bath.

This cheesecake was good. Very simple to make but I wish I would have read others reviews before I made it! Not as creamy and smooth as I would have liked, I should have beaten it for 10-15 mins like others suggested. I followed the recipe exactly- and it was not too sweet or overpowering with lemon flavor. Still not exactly what I am looking for, I am trying to find a recipe similar to the cheesecake they serve in Greece....SO creamy and light, it is fabulous, but I will continue my search!

This was very good- but I'm looking for something creamier...my goal is to find a recipe that tastes like the Original Sara Lee cheesecake! I made this with 1/2 cup of sugar as suggested by others-might leave it at 3/4 next time. Beat for 10 minutes & omitted lemon. I put a pan of water on the bottom rack of oven, left the cheesecake in for 2 hours after cooking, & finished cooling on a rack before chilling. It really is very good- maybe I will add some sour cream to try to get it to the consistency I'm looking for.

this is certainly a creamy dessert, and soooo easy to prepare. I made my own graham cracker crust and used chocolate cream cheese. my daughter said it tasted like a pudding and not a cheesecake. I am not sure if it was the chocolate cream cheese or her "picky" taste. anyhow it was lovely, will make again for sure.

Very creamy & easy. This was the first time I made a cheeseckake so instead of investing in a springform pan, I used a graham cracker prepared crust.  I served it at Easter dinner and it was a surefire hit.  I topped it with cherry pie filling.   I will remember this for a delicious & fast dessert and shall looking for more chhesecake recipes.  Thank you.

I had read reviews where some said this was too thin. So, I added another 8 ozs of cream cheese and increased the sugar to 1 cup and had to bake 45 minutes, but this is wonderful!  It came out pretty thick and creamy!

It did not come out like I expected.  I expected it to be thick and creamy, but it was not creamy at all and the  was thin. I used the suggested 9" pie crust and the final product was maybe only 1/4 inch thick. However, it was quite simple and easy to make.

For a simple cheesecake recipe it turned out quite good.  It is the Philly 3-step cheesecake recipe with a few variations....and the variations make it much better.  I never liked the 3-step cheesecake because I felt the texture wasn't right...usually too dry, but I think with the reduced bake time on this one, it made it a lot more creamy, especially after it had been sitting with the cherries on top for about an hour before we served it.  It has more sugar in it than the 3-step, and I think it was a little too much for me (I did use Splenda/Sugar blend)...I think I will try reducing it to about 2/3 c. next time, but other than that I will definitely keep this one for when I need a quick baked cheesecake.

This was delicious. I didn't have the lemon zest so I left it out. We had a jar of lemon curd in the cupboard so I topped it with that..YUMMY. My family was fighting over who gets the last piece.

I really liked the flavor of this cheesecake. I used it as the middle layer of a cake without the graham cracker crust and the texture and flavors blended well. I will make this again without using it as a middle layer of a cake.

This was the best cheesecake I ever made! I doubled the recipe and was so glad I did. The lemon zest just sets it off. This will be my go to recipe from now on. DEFINITELY make sure that all of your ingredients are room temperature and you will have a fantastic result. Thanks!!!!

Yummy,  1/2 cup of sugar is all you need, I'm glad I read the advice. I substituted lemon zest with orange zest and love it.

I don’t have a springform pan and my wife really likes cheesecake,  so I decided on this recipe  because it called for a prepared crust. I let the cream cheese come up to room temperature’ish and let my stand mixer mix everything with the paddle attachment for 6 or 7 minutes. After the timer went off at 25 minutes I just turned it off and let it sit until cool, no cracks! Perfect cheesecake! Not as pretty as a springform pan would do but everyone still liked it.

My family raved about this truly creamy cheesecake. It is softer and moister than traditional cheesecake, just how we like it. I poured it through a sieve and used a water bath in the oven, two techniques that  ensure even more creaminess. I used graham crackers to make homemade crust, and topped it with strawberries. This will be my go to cheesecake from now on.

I mixed in some homemade blueberry pie filling with the cheesecake mix and baked it in. Other than that. I followed the recipe exactly and I have more blueberry sauce for topping later.

I really loved this recipe and highly recommend it to anyone. It’s so easy, and tastes so good! Everyone who at it totally loved it! By the way, lemon juice works fine if you  don’t have lemon zest. TRY THIS, IT’S AWESOME!

I made it to the letter but put a little water in the sheet pan as others suggested. I think the lemon zest (or lemon juice if strapped) adds depth to the already great flavor. I've tried my hand at other cheesecakes and my mother in law said "this is the one!" She's right: so easy and so tasty I will never try another recipe.

It is a really good recipe, but I tweaked it for my grandson.  I used caramel flavoring.  I had a little left-over Dulce de leche which I used for a topping and made a ganache from the recipe on the Allrecipe site.  It was poured over the Dulce de leche.

It was a lovely recipe  as  I don't like sour cream in my cheesecake, nor do I want to make one for a large group.  

This was large enough to feed 5 people dessert and two pieces to go home with my grandson to share with his girlfriend.  ;-) She loved it too.

Very easy cheesecake to make and yummy.  I did not have vanilla extract so I substituted it with 1/4 tsp of maple extract and 1 tsp of maple syrup.  I did have to bake it a bit longer. I will make it again

I haven't made cheesecake in quite a while, and this one was so easy and delicious, that I'll be making it again and often! I made this with a gluten free graham cracker crust, and it was wonderful! I did read other reviews, and letting the filling mix for 10 mins or so using my stand mixture did contribute to a smooth, creamy cheesecake . Thank you for the recipe!

This was an easy to make and delicious cheesecake. I made two of them. I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup as others suggested 3/4 cup is too sweet. I substituted almond extract for the vanilla extract in one of them and it was delicious! I will make it with the almond extract in the future as it gives it a nice flavor.

My first ever cheesecake and it was great!  I added about 1/4 cp of sour cream, a splash of lemon juice.  I also used gluten free shortbread cookies as I have celiac disease.  I used a 10" pie dish and after chilling the pie, I put a can of cherry pie filling on the top.  My husband like it so much he didn't want me to share with the neighbors!  He wants me to make it again right away so as soon as I can get to the market, it will definitely be on the menu.  Thanks for the wonderful receipe.

Baking is not my forte, but the only sweet thing my husband likes (loves!) is cheesecake - especially peanut butter, and I've been promising to make one so I chose this recipe because of its simplicity.  If I can make this, anyone can!  I used a store bought oreo cookie crust, omitted the lemon zest, used a slightly heaping 1/2 cup of sugar, and I did use a water bath.   I added a 1/2 cup of crunchy peanut butter to the mix (next time I would use 3/4 cup) and beat it longer than normal but not the full extra 12-15 minutes one reviewer suggested.  I cooked it for about 27 minutes (depends on your oven I suppose).  I didn't let it sit in the oven once off, but took it out and let it cool for about an hour and then put it in the fridge.  The mixture filled the pie crust almost to the top once cooked.   I wanted a hard chocolate and peanut topping so I used 8 individually wrapped dark chocolate squares, broken into pieces, and melted on low heat with about 2 tbsp of smart balance butter and about 2 tbsp of the crunchy peanut butter until it was melted and removed from heat.  I sprinkled some of the crushed peanuts on the cake and then drizzled the chocolate sauce over the cake until it was covered and then topped with the rest of the peanuts and put it back in the fridge.  It was a hit!!!   I think I will beat the mixture longer next time because it seemed to be more dense than traditional cheesecake, but that may be due to the addition of the peanut butter??    Thank you for a w

This is the first cheesecake I made. After reading some long and involved recipes, I decided to go for an easier one. This is delicious and soooo easy. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I kept the sugar at 3/4 cup because I substituted 1/2 cup of cocoa powder for the lemon zest.  It was perfect! I will definitely make this again.

This was absolutely delicious! I made it for my lemon-loving daughter and her lips were smacking. I did use more lemon zest than called for...much more...but other than that it was the same. I also followed a review that suggested whipping for 12 to 15 minutes and it was delightfully light and creamy. A very thin layer of the microwave lemon curd from this website and a dollop of whipped cream finished it off. I made it gluten free by making my own crust using gluten-free graham cracker crumbs but unknowingly made it too thick and although tasty, it was a bit heavy for such a light treat (my mistake). Next time I will make a thinner crust and save half the crumbs for another time.

I made this as is for my Mom's 60th birthday party, and it was a hit! Delicious & so creamy, not to mention refreshing with the lemon zest. The only thing I do with all my cheesecakes is 1.) place a pan of water on the bottom rack 2.) turn off the oven and leave it in there for an hour to cool. Just never had a cheesecake fail me that way ?? Thanks for such a great recipe!

This was easy and delicious.  Like other reviewers, I made mine in an 8" pan for some height.  I made the graham cracker crust using 1 1/4 graham cracker and 1/4 cup of ground pecans, with 5 TBLS melted butter, 1 TBLS sugar. Baked on 350 for 10 mins. I also added a 1/2 cup of sour cream to the batter and left the sugar the same.  Added about 1/2 teaspoon of lemon rind.  Baked mine in a water bath at 325 for 1 hour and then turned off the oven and kept the door ajar for about 15 mins and then removed it an cooled on a wire rack.  Came out perfect!!
Will be making this again in the future!!

I have made quite a few cheesecakes for my Oma and husband. I didn't have everything I needed for the traditional cake I usually make but this recipe sounded good. I did a recipe and a half being I did have 3 packages of cc and some of the reviews said that it didn't fill the crust enough so I tried to do it 1 1/2 times but left the sugar at the 3/4 cups and it is perfect! And it has a great taste and texture.  ??

Very easy to make. Modified it a bit with ingredients on hand. Didn't have sugar so used sweetened condensed milk and because of that the cake was a bit more dense but creamy and delish. Would do it again in a heartbeat!

I've been making this for years as my go-to cheesecake recipe, and I just now decided to rate it while it's in the oven. It's simple but perfect and the lemon does add nice flavor without any tasters being able to pinpoint that there's lemon in it. To keep the top from browning and cracking, simply having a pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven while baking is a must that I learned from another reviewer years ago.  It will turn out picture perfect.

I made it twice, 1st. time it was too much lemon. The second time I cut the lemon zest in half, followed the rest to the T and it was delicious!! Perfect, just what I wanted. Will be making it again, highly recommend.

I made this last night and the taste is pretty good. I took the advice of others and mixed the filling for 15 minutes but still it had some lumps. I think next time I make this I'll leave the cheese out until it's not just soft but room temperature. It needed more time so I baked it for 33-35 minutes and then turned the stove off leaving it until the oven cooled. Lastly I cut back on the sugar per another's review and I would have to say 2/3 cup is a good amount.

So easy and so good! We think it's better with less lemon, but still great. Next I'm trying without a crust at all to see if it will cut & serve as solid pieces without one. I love that the recipe is flexible & workable based on preferences.

When I made it I put some orange zest into it along with some of its  juice and it turned out great. It's summer where I live so I froze it and it made it seem so much better with the heat outside. This is literally the best cheesecake I've ever had let alone made.

So simple and delicious!  Made my own graham crust from recipe off the crumb box - just graham crumbs and butter (didn't even add sugar, but you could). Overall maybe a little heavy, but really delicious. Googled "strawberry sauce" and found a really simple one: just mostly-thawed frozen strawberries, a little sugar and a splash of lime juice.  Perfect!  Will definitely make this again.

Love it! I'm a newbie in baking and love eating cheesecake! I tried making this today and it turns out fabulous! 
I use 400g of cream cheese and baked for about 35mins at 170c and 1min at 210c for the color, using a convection oven.

I have made this 5 times now and they just seem to be getting better! I have been playing with flavors.  We have a very well know Cheesecake place in NYC won't mention any names on Cleveland Place where I bought a banana Cheesecake for around $40, well I used banana extract and my family couldn't tell the difference oh wait theirs came with chocolate gram crust. Thats been taken care of!  I did the 15 min beating and water bath and today's was a coffee with chocolate gram. I kept all the same ingredients except lost the lemon zest when changing flavors and I added an extra egg and 8 oz of cream cheese to give me a little more cake the baking time also increased to about an hour give or take.

This is soooo good. I used only 1/2 cup sugar and whipped it for 10 mins. It turned out so creamy and a bit ligher then one would normally expect from cheesecake. My husband almost ate the whole thing in one sitting and begged for me to make more two days later. Thanks Karin!

Delicious!  I used 2 blocks of 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it still turned out creamy and wonderful.  The zest of lemon is perfect!  I agree with others - reduce sugar to 1/2 cup.  Tastes just as great with the reduced sugar.

I didn't use any zest, but this is the best tasting, easy cheesecake I've seen. It is so smooth and creamy, and just as tasty as NY style without the huge quantity and expense. Perfect for our family.

Everyone seemed to like the cheesecake.  Next time I will not add the lemon. Also, I blended the mixture for at least 10 minutes as other reviewers had suggested.  The recipe still didn't come out as dense as what cheesecake normally does.  Maybe that's why it's called "creamy" cheesecake.  I topped mine with some blueberry topping.  It reminded me of a blueberry cream pie.

I thought it was great.  It was smooth and thick.  I did substitute 1/4 teaspoon of eggnog flavoring for the lemon zest. Baked with a pan of hot water below rack.  When cooking time was up, turned off oven and let it cool down with cheesecake inside.  Only had one tiny crack.  Serve w/o fruit on top.

WOW. I can't believe how easy this was and how few ingredients! I made this for Valentine's Day dessert and it was really, really tasty. It can be made a bit lighter too with low fat cream cheese and a reduced fat crust.

I substituted Splenda for the sugar to keep this on the healthy, low-carb side. It turned out to be just as light and creamy, and my family said they preferred this over heavier cheesecakes.

This was very easy to make and tasted really good. I hand mixed with a whisk, left out the zest, used a store bought crust and baked in a water bath. Thanks!

Delicious, far nicer then the store bought one I had the other week. First time I used light cream cheese and was more then happy with the result. This time I used the full fat which was creamier.......think I prefer the lighter one. Either way, very easy and topped with Supreme Strawberry Topping I also found on here, I even impressed myself! Thankyou for the recipe, it's a definate keeper.

This was my very first time making a cheesecake. First off it was easy as pie.  Secondly, it was the best.  My picky daughter loved it.  That cake lasted less than an hour.  This is Best every recipe

My first attempt at a cheesecake turned out really well thanks to this recipe. I thought it tasted great, and I don't even like cheesecake that much. It did crack, but presentation wasn't that important. I made the Supreme Strawberry Topping from this website to go with it. Yum!

I did as several reviewers suggested and beat the mixture for 10 - 15 minutes, also baked it in a water bath.  It was very good, but personally, I didn't see much of a flavor or texture difference between this and a no-bake cheesecake.

for my first cheesecake I was pretty darn proud of myself. No cracks due to anothers suggestion for a water bath. I must have made too much crust or something so I'm going to double the filling. Definately doing this again!
