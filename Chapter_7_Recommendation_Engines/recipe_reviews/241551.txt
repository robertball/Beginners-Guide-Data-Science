Amazing!! I took this to a potluck and since it was a new recipe and I'd never made it, I wasn't sure how well it would be received, but everyone loved it. Even the young children there had multiple servings! I made it as directed, except that I used salsa instead of picante sauce because I forgot to get picante sauce when I went shopping.

I loved this! I preferred it as a dip and used lime tortilla chips to cut down the heat, but it was delicious!

I'm addicted to this dish. Its healthy , easy , and delicious! I used lime juice instead of lemon, left out the garlic, used salsa instead of picante, and used chopped scallions instead of a yellow onion  and it turned out great. I like that I can tweak the ingredients to my taste.

Simple and delicious! I only used 1 avocado, and thought that was plenty. Also, I had to cut back on the cilantro b/c of the guys, but the flavor still came through nicely. The whole family really enjoyed this. I will def be making this again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe is easy peasy to make and is delicious!  Served it as a side with burgers and hotdogs and guests loved it. 
I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.  I did use mild picante sauce as I don't like my food too hot, and it gave just enough of a kick for me.

I didn’t make any changes to this except to use lime rather than lemon. It was fantastic and could be a great dip with sturdy chips, a salad with a taco dinner or a stand alone meal. Don’t wait, make this dish now!
