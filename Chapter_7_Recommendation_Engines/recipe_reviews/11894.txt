This is a great [almost one pot] meal!  I had to do some substitutions based on what I had on hand, but it's a great base recipe!  I saw the recipe lacked any seasoning, so I sauteed two cloves of fresh minced garlic with the onion - and increased the onion to one small onion.  I didn't have pimiento, so I also sauteed diced green pepper with the onion until soft.  I used Chinese Mie noodles (Ramen), low-sodium Cream of Chicken soup (I think this is much better than Mushroom would be!), milk instead of water (much creamier!), sharp cheddar (a little extra) and added ground white pepper and celery salt.  I also let the mix simmer on the lowest heat for nearly an hour waiting on my husband, and as I tasted it every 15 minutes, it got better and better.  Leftovers will be great!  Everyone in the family loved it!  I served it with shredded cheese and a sprinkle of parsely on top.

This is an awesome recipe!!  I agree ~ it tastes as though you have worked for hours when in reality it is so super easy!  The first time I made it exactly as written and received rave reviews from my family.  The next time, I played with the recipe just a bit: I didn't have any fresh parsley, so I added in about 1/2 cup frozen broccoli florets (thawed) with the ham and also tossed in a few sliced mushrooms (from a jar); I was a little low on cheddar cheese, too, so I added some Parmesan.  It still turned out wonderful.  I love recipes that give you some freedom to be flexible (and still taste great!)  This one is definitely a family favorite!

I was surprised at how good this tasted with my revisions--skip onions; use low fat marg.; use low fat mushroom soup; reduce water to 1/4 c.; add 1/4 c. dry white wine; add 1/4 c. parmesan.  Very flavorful my way.  I didn't use the parsley or pimento because I didn't have it.  You do need those two ingredients for color purposes only.  I'll definitely make this again.  Even my husband enjoyed it!

This was exactly what I was looking for to use up the Easter ham leftovers.  I doubled the recipe to make 8 servings, and I used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup to cut the calories.  It had a great creamy cheesy mild taste, and the combination of ham, cheese and cream of mushroom made it plenty salty without having to add salt.  I added just a little black pepper and garlic, and it was perfect.  This was also a very quick dish to prepare on a school night.  Thanks!  5*****Stars!

GREAT RECIPE - This is also good because you can do it all in one pot other than cooking the noodles. I doubled this recipe. I changed/added a few things. I added minced garlic and black pepper which were not listed for extra flavor, chicken broth instead of water (this does not need salt due to the salt in the condensed soup). I used ham steaks (chopped)and sauteed all vegetables, ham and seasoning together before adding the soup, chicken broth and cheese - add extra cheese. The family really enjoyed this one (sauteed mushrooms would be great in this but my son would not eat it if I had added them). Since we are ham lovers we will make again and again. Thanks Susan.

I thought this was pretty good.  I gave it 5 stars because of how easy it was and its a good one for putting your own twists on.  Great for a busy weeknight.  I did change some things based on what others said and it was actually great with the changes.  I douubled the recipee and used 4 cloves of fresh garlic and 8 ounces fresh mushrooms which I sauted with the onions.  I used a full 2 cups of shereded mozerella and provelone cheese. (It was what I had on hand) I omited the pimento and instead added a 16oz bag of chopped mixed veggies.  Instead of water I used chicken broth and added just a tad more than the recipee called for.  I also used the whole 16oz box of spaghetti. I used ham, but i bet chicken or turkey would be good too.  Thanks for such a great recipee.

A good, easy, and fast meal.  Per other reviewers, I too used 1/4c water & 1/4c white wine, but I think chicken broth could also be subbed instead or you could use a splash of white wine while sauting the onions.  Also, I added some fresh/sliced mushrooms (in the saute') and added parmesan to taste. Good and would make again.

Wow! What a great recipe. I was skeptical at first with canned soup being the main base for the sauce but it did not taste like that at all! I did tweak the recipe a bit. 2 TBSP butter and 1 TBSP EVOO to saute onions in, adding 1 clove minced garlic at the end of saute time, cooking just until fragrant. Increased the water to 3/4 and added 1/2 cup of sour cream to the base. I wanted to increase the sauce so I could increase the pasta. 6 ounces just didn't seem like enough for a family of 4. I used at least 8 if not 10 ounces of linguini. I used 1 1/2 cup of left over smoked ham (yum!) and omitted the parsley and pimentos. Instead, I added about 2 cups of small, crisp steamed broccoli florets at the end. I also seasoned with some cracked black pepper. My family raved about this. I like to try new things fairly often. Some get the go ahead to try again, some go in the trash can. This recipe went right into my recipe book as a family favorite. Thanks a bunch!

This was very easy.  Great for kids but bland for adults.  I added extra cheese and left out the pimento.

Was not in the mood for another ham sandwich, so I was pleasantly surprised to see this recipe on the main page. With less than $5, i was able to transform leftover ham into a nice pasta dish for four. I did exact recipe  and giving it a 4 as is...then later added sauteed mushroom and pepper.  Cream of mushroom w/ roasted garlic was on sale, so I used that.  Next time I would like to use cream or half and half and maybe parm reggiano, for another twist to this nice base dish.  Served with toast spread with homemade roasted garlic butter.  In the category for easy peasy and done in a jiffy, this get's a 5.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it is excellent.  I did place the entire mixture into a greased casserole dish and covered it with about a cup of mozzarella cheese and baked it at 350 until bubbly, then broiled for a few minutes until the cheese was melted and browned.  This extra step moved it from Excellent to FABULOUS!

Yummy! Super quick and simple to prepare...and a nice way to use up leftover X-mas ham. Adjustments that I made were, using unsalted butter as I felt the ham and cheese added enough saltiness to the dish. Used milk instead of water and a mixture of cheeses (Cheddar and Swiss) as I did not have a full half cup of either. I also seasoned it at the end of preparation with black pepper and a bit of nutmeg to accent the creaminess of the sauce. Another trick, is to reserve a bit of the pasta cooking water and add it to the pasta/sauce mixture if it needs a bit more moisture to coat. Thank you Susan for posting this recipe!

A pretty bland recipe.  It definately needs some pepping up.  I didnt have pimentos, I added mushrooms and broccoli flourets and sauteed garlic.  I substituted the water for white wine, and added some cajun seasoning for a little kick, not too much though.  It still needed something though, more flavor.  I think maybe the cream of mushroom soup was too heavy.  Might make it with a roux and some cream next time and some more herbs.

This is actually a very good recipe and a great way to use up leftover ham.  Quick, easy, with endless tweaking possibilities.  First of all I didn't measure anything and began by sauteing way more than the 2 tablespoons of chopped onion until slightly carmelized (we love onions).  Stirred in cream of mushroom soup, substituted milk for the water, and the shredded Cheddar.  For a bit more umph added Parmesan cheese to this mixture as well, heating until the cheeses melted.  The rest goes as written in the directions.  Enjoyed by all, even the picky 5 year old who can find a speck of onion in anything.  Will definitely make again when we have leftover ham.  Thanks Susan, fantastic recipe!!

With the changes I made this deserves 5 stars.  I used cream of chicken soup with at least 1 c. milk (no water) and parmesan cheese instead of cheddar.  I added peas for color, some minced garlic, and chopped tomatoes at the very end.  I used more ham, a bit more pasta, and no parsley or pimentos.  I just used what I had on hand and my DH and I both thought it turned out great.  Thanks for the post!

I followed other reviewers and used milk (2%) instead of water. It made it thicker.  Also added mushroom and minced garlic to the onions.

Loved this. Of course, I love tetrazzini's and casseroles in general. Easy to make...quick...tasty...etc. I hate recipe changers, but I did double the spaghetti noodles and added a touch of garlic and a little more onion. Remember, it's good the way it is. I just happen to like onion and garlic more than most people. Also, add a little milk if using more noodles to keep it creamy.

Soooo yummy!  I didn't have any parsley or pimentos, so I didn't add those, and I used about half of a large onion because I LOVE onions.  Also, I used half a cup of milk instead of water, but I thought it looked a little too pasty, so I added about 2 tbs. of heavy cream.  I also used Ronzoni Garden Delight pasta...I like using it for the colours when I have an otherwise monochromatic dish.

Made exactly as written, this recipe is good, but a little bland.  I added minced garlic with the onion and sauteed.  I also used a "fiesta blend" cheese and added grated Parmesan.  I omitted the pimento peppers, and added dried parsley, instead of fresh.  With these modifications, we really enjoyed it and I will definitely make this again!  My picky son even enjoyed it!

OK taste but texture was too sticky/gluey...not creamy enough. May taste better using Cream of Chicken instead of Cream of Mushroom soup.

I used mozzarella because I didn't have any cheddar and I added a good handful instead of just a 1/2 c. Left out the parsley and pimento. Definitely one to put in my rotation! Super yummy dish. Thanks, Susan!

Unfortunately, I have to disagree with the largely positive reviews on this recipe. I had to make a few alterations based on what was to hand and other reviews - sauteeing the onion in olive oil rather than butter and adding minced garlic and white pepper. 

Before I even got this out of the pot, and onto a plate, I didn't want to eat it. It smelled and looked unappealing.

This was heavy and odd. I think it is more suited for turkey of chicken than ham. It cooked quick, but I had to add a lot to bring up the flavor, like garlic, green onion, sauted mushrooms, no pimentos. The ham just felt out of place. Waste of good ham.

I have been making this for years - one of my first recipes - from a Campbell's cookbook printed in 1972. Tonight I also used milk rather than water, and White Zin for the wine. I usually add a lot of onion. Tonight I also added some chopped celery, green pepper, small slice of red pepper,a little garlic, and a lot of pepper. It was delish as always. Even if you follow the recipe to a T, it's great!

Very good. Four stars because I also make a chicken tetrazzini, and in comparison I like the chicken better, but that's just a matter of personal taste. That said, we ate it all and said "yum". I did make some of the changes suggested by other reviewers; more onion, chicken broth instead of water, no pimento, added black pepper. Also added garlic & fresh mushrooms when sauteing the onion. Next time I'll add more mushrooms. Parmesan on the top. I will make it again. Delicious way to use Easter ham leftovers.

This was fast , and easy .  Made twice . First time as written . Kinda bland.  Second time , I used a lot more onion , two cloves minced garlic, and chopped , red pepper .  Milk , instead of water , and  two pinches of red pepper flakes.  Took the left overs to work , and it re-heated very well.  The girls said looked and smelled really good . Will make again .  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was good, the kid really liked it.  I made it as is, for the most part and them added sauteed mushrooms to the adult half and some extra cheese.  I also used milk instead of water as many reviewers recommended, seemed to thick with only 1/2 cup so I added about 3/4 cups milk.  This is very nice for a quick meal and a great way to use up leftover Easter ham!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I thought this had a rather odd flavor and my husband commented that it just didn't seem to go right with pasta.  He ended up putting it on toast and said it was great, but I didn't get a chance to try it that way.  I don't think I will make this again.

This was amazingly delicious.  I left off the pimientos since I did not have any and added chopped carrots that I cooked a bit beforehand.

This is a GREAT recipe to use leftover ham! I froze my leftover ham, and when I needed a quick dinner, I could have this on the table in 15 minutes. PLUS the other ingredients are ones I always have on hand. Perfect for chilly winter nights! I didn't use the pimento either, but added green onions.

Okay, I changed this quite a bit, but that is the good thing about this recipe- it is very easy to adapt.  I used vegetable penne pasta instead of the spaghetti.  I used colby-jack cheese cubes instead of the cheddar.  I used red onion, and basil instead of parsley.  I did not have pimentos, so those were omitted.  But the key thing I did was add 3tablespoons of white wine vinegar right at the end, and mix up.  This added an extra zing and great flavor.  I also served with crushed red pepper on the side for myself and husband, since we like some spice.  This was soooo good!  A good recipe to fool around with.  I will try using different cheeses, noodles and meats soon.

Very easy to make! I did use Pam instead of butter to cook the onion and it worked just as beautifully. I also omitted the peppers since i didn't have any and one last change...i served the sauce/ham over rice instead of mixing noodles into it. It was delish as a sauce. Will definitely make again!

Awesome recipe.. I did change a few things.. added sour cream, milk and flour mixture to replace the mushroom soup... added pepper, cilantro, peas and some corn. Instead of the spaghetti I used thin egg noodles.. this was YUMMY!   Will make again, and again;)

This was good. We had bought a Honey Baked ham and had a lot left over so I searched for things to make with it. The ham definitely made this recipe. I did add a touch of white wine and used milk in place of water. I added a small amount of sauce to my noodles as it was quite rich....but good.

This recipe was awsome the only difference was I added a little diced celery and for the cheese i added about a 1/4 package of mexican velveeta and diced some roma tomatoes to it. Was it ever good. The husband just loves it! A glass of wine topped it off:) Thank you for the recipe:)

Wow!  I could not believe how fast this came together.  It was a perfect comfort food for the day after Easter.  I used shallots (no fresh onion in the house) and added a little garlic as per others' reviews, then a dash of black pepper and dried parsley because I didn't have fresh.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Try adding a half cup of celery to the sauteed onion and then a 1/2 cup of cooked frozen peas.  Makes a great dish for leftover holiday ham!

Mmmm. Added peas and a dash of cheyanne pepper. Also added white wine and italian seasoning. Sooooo yummy! I found I only needed about 3/4 cup of ham. I didn't have parsley or pimento.

funny thing, I was making broccoli cheese soup while making this dish - preparing meals for the week. I ended up putting the 2 cups of milk for the soup into the tetrazzini. To fix my mistake, I let it reduce for a while and it came out great. The flavor is good. However, I thought the ham made it really salty - hence the 3 stars. I did add thawed frozen asparagus so it would have a veggie. I'm thinking the next time I make this I will use chicken instead.

Loved this!  I had been looking for something to do with leftover ham and I finally found it.  I didn't have pimento so I didn't use it.  I used white wine instead of water and I used half of a small onion.  My hubby even loved it...which says a lot.

This recipe was fast and easy to throw together.  I didn't put in the pimentos or parsley. Hubby and I chose to add a little extra flavor - he added a dash of Tobasco sauce and I chose black pepper.  Next time that I make it, I think that I'll use more onions and some sweet peas.  A little garlic might be nice too.

Yummifulness!  Only change I made was  double the recipe, and to add 1/2 to 3/4 cup chopped frozen mixed peppers... I asked my mother if pimento peppers were hot, and she said they were... so I didn't use them, because I don't do "hot" also I just guessed on the onion and the shredded cheese ;)
I made homemade cream of mushroom soup to go in it :)

I also left out the pimento.  Who the heck likes pimento?!?  I substituted diced chicken for the ham and also tried it with the ham.  Liked it much better with the chicken than the ham.

I did not have spagetti, fresh parsley or pimentoes so I used bowtie pasta, dried parsley flakes and peas as substitutions... In place of water, I used milk for a more creamy texture... This was suprisingly delicious; my family ate every last bite. Great way to use leftover Easter ham!

This is surprisingly REALLY good!  I used leftover ham from Easter, and followed the recipe exactly as stated.  The only thing I had to substitute was the peppers, I used green bell peppers instead b/c I had some.  Will definitely make again!

Would I go out of my way to make this....No...but if I had leftover ham I would. So this was nothing special to me but Hey it was good! I did double the recipe so my second cream of was celery. I also used milk instead of water which made it creamier.

We loved this recipe, even the kids!  Would be very easy to modify to use whatever meat you have on hand.  Also, we made a little more pasta than the recipe called for, so we just added a little milk and a little extra cheese to the sauce.  Turned out great!

This recipe was thick and creamy but lacked in flavor diversity.  It melded into one non descript cozy flavor but didn't have the zest to make you crave it again.  My kids loved it and it was easy and quick to make so I will do it again but I'll have to spike the recipe a bit to step it up a notch or two.

This was very good!!  I subbed chicken broth for the water (added a little extra), and used fettuccine noodles(what I had in the cupboard), and subbed chopped leftover green beans for pimento (didn't have) and put about a tablespoon of minced garlic, but otherwise followed to a T.  Will definitely make this again...thank you very much!  a GREAT way to use up my leftover roast ham.

This is a great recipe!  Super easy and my picky 4 year old even ate it!  I did have to modify the recipe slightly because of what I did and didn't have on hand but I like this recipe because it's a good 'basic' recipe that you can modify to your own family's tastes.  I had to use cream of celery soup because I didn't have cream of mushroom on hand.  I also added a sm. can of mushrooms and some steamed peas.  I did 1 c. instead of 1/2 c. of shredded co-jack (we live in MN and you can never have enough cheese in any recipe :0)!)  I added 1 tsp. of minced garlic in with the sauteed onions as well and used milk instead of water to make the sauce more creamy, as many other reviewers suggested.   Also, didn't have fresh parsley so used dried parsley.  Overall a good basic recipe that I can modify to what I have on hand.  I think it would be good with leftover turkey or chicken too!

This was a great recipes, I did modify it a bit though, reading other reviews. I first sauteed the onions and I just two cloves of galic along with the butter. I did use the cream of mushroom soup and sub. the 1/2 c of water with milk, for a creamier base. Added the ham and used parmasan cheese rather than the cheddar cheese. It turned out great.

My husband loved this meal, but thought it was even better when he added garlic salt to it afterward. However I didn't enjoy it nearly as much - I guess the creamy/cheese taste bothered me a little. It's not something I dislike that I would never try again though - just tasted different.

This was a good ham recipe - and it really couldn't get much easier.  I did add some peas for color, used reduced fat soup and cheese, and didn't have pimento.  Great quick meal for a weeknight.

I have made this several times.  It was tonight's choice because I didn't want to turn the oven on in this heat.  I make it exactly as written, just omit the pimentos.  We all like it and it is super-easy.

I didn't read the other reviews before trying this recipe, but I totally agree with all of them. It was so easy to make and it tastes absolutely wonderful. I also added fresh sliced mushrooms to mine, plus we tried a little of the sauce as a dip to try it out first..Wonderful dish.

Another great recipe found on allrecipes.com.  I needed to do something with leftover ham.  Excellent flavor.  I too skipped the pimentos (though I am curious to try them next time), added minced garlic, and used an Italian Blend cheese.  I also used milk instead of water.  Will definitely use this one again!

I needed to use ham leftovers and found this great recipe! It was very easy and fast to make!  After reading some of the reviews I decided to use fresh minced garlic and black pepper while sauteing the onions. I also used 1/4 water and 1/4 white wine in place of the water.   It tasted delicious and everyone loved it. I served it with a nice salad and white wine. This recipe would work with chicken or shrimp in place of the ham, with any complimenting vegetable.  The recipe served 4 people. Next time I would double it! Thank you Susan!

I found this recipe when looking for things to make with leftover Christmas ham. It was great and super quick! I added a couple tablespoons of sour cream for tang, 1/4 cup water, 1/4 cup chicken stock and added some pasta water to cook off the noodles in the sauce. Good go-to recipe for leftover ham.

This is so good!  Had leftover ham from Christmas to use and I'm glad I chose this recipe to use it!  Turned out very creamy and comforting.  I followed the recipe as is except for adding the pimentos.  Didn't have them on hand.  This got excellent reviews from my kids, so this is a keeper!

I needed something to make on a school night with leftover ham from Thanksgiving. I had all of the ingredients except for the peppers. I don't eat mushrooms so I used cream of chicken. This was done in about 10 minutes. My kids couldn't believe it was done so soon. Perfect Monday night meal! I will have to double the recipe next time. We are ham lovers and my kids are very simple, picky eaters and they were pleased. Thanks for the simple but flavorful meal.

This is our after-Thanksgiving meal that we most look forward to. My kids think it is better than the actual Thanksgiving meal!

This was so great!  Per other reviewers' advice I used 1/4 c white wine and 1/4 c water.  I also added peas to the mix.  It was a hit, and it tasted like I put way more effort into it than I actually did!  Next time I am going to try it with chicken or turkey to see how that works - I bet it will be great that way.

We just loved this recipe.   I did not have any pimento so did not added.   Had some sauted mushrooms on hand and added them.   This is a fast and easy meal to prepare and will make again.

This is a great recipe for when you need a good hearty meal that is quick to make. I followed the suggestions of others and added a bit more onion and 1/2 teaspoon fresh garlic.  I also used 1/4c water and 1/4c white wine.  This gave it rich flavor that everyone loved.  I served it with crescent rolls and peas.

I gave it 4 stars, but everyone else either tolerated it, or didn't eat it.  I really wanted to like this since it was easy to make and it is a good way to get rid of leftover ham.  Maybe I'll make it again when no one else is around.

Tasty. A great way to use up leftover ham from Easter dinner. I left out the parsley and pimentos and added frozen peas and carrots. I also used a full pound of spaghetti and 2 cans of soup. The family gobbled it up!

Kids loved it, adults liked it, always a note of success.  I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom which made it a little thicker than I expected, shouldn have used 3/4c water.  I also left out the pimento....but....when it came time to clean up, there were no leftovers!  Worth a try for a last minute meal.

Found this recipe while looking for something to do with some leftover ham.  Used this recipe as a starting point and embellished it.  Added garlic and mushrooms to the onion.  Also added some peas.  I had cheddar on hand, but decided on fontina for two reasons, I needed to use it and thought it would go well.  

I realize it’s unfair to rate a recipe that I altered so I gave it 4 stars.  I predict without the changes, I would have given it fewer stars.

Took advice and doubled the recipie (could tell by looking at the amounts it was not enough to feed 3.5 people). Used my homemade chicken stock in place of the water. Used chopped green olives instead of the pimentoes (ick). Oh, used a combo of motz and colby cheese (what I had). This was an excellent combo and I WILL be making this many times more! TY

This recipe is basically a requirement every time we have leftover ham. It's easy and delicious and everyone in the family loves it. I up the cheese (mom always said you can never have too much) and leave out the parsley and peppers since we just never have them on hand. I also substitute milk for the water and up it a bit so it's not quite so thick.

Great recipe base!!! I made my own changes that included the white wine to the onions & garlic. Using mostly evaporated milk instead of all water and a cheddar & parm cheese mix. No salt needed & small pinch of black pepper. It was a nice change for my picky son to actually clean his plate & request another helping!! He didn't even mention the chopped Italian Parsley! Enjoyed every bite & added to my favorite recipes!! :)

Personally, I DO NOT like pasta, but my family does - so we go with it.  I used low fat egg noodles.  Next time, I will add celery with the onions.  My husband likes this, but he likes anything.  It is a hit with him.

Excellent and easy. Added about 1/4 c. chopped green pepper with the onion.  Used a little white wine and milk instead of 1/2 c. water.   Also added about 1 c. frozen green peas (thawed) at the end with the pimentos, parsley and pasta.  Quite colorful and tasty.

What a great idea for a sauce!! It was so creamy & tasted great! I didn't have onion so I sautéed minced garlic instead. Yummy. I will definitely use this recipe again, maybe w/shrimp or chicken.

Easter Ham leftovers filling your fridge? Try this Ham Tetrazzini and they will quickly disappear! I used whole-wheat medium shells instead of spaghetti, mozzarella in place of cheddar, doubled the ham, plus 1% milk instead of water, and it was delicious! First sauté fresh mushrooms and garlic for added yumminess :)

When I first saw this recipe, I chuckled a little at the simplicity.....yet once I made it, it was AMAZING!   Pretty much made as written....did add garlic with onion (probably more onion than asked for), milk instaed of water (KEY for creaminess)....and a little liberal on the cheddar...lol.  But this was seriously really tasty and a GREAT way to repurpose ham!!!  I new fave!!

This turned out great and I used my leftover Easter ham.  I used half & half instead of water. I would suggest at least using milk (cream would be awesome).  I added peas as well and did not have pimentos. I think sauteed mushrooms would be yummy, but my kids don't like them. I used angel hair pasta (a whole box) so next time I think I would either make less pasta or more sauce. Yummy, easy dish!

I made this tonight for my daughter and I to use up some leftover Easter ham. I really wasn't expecting much, but was I wrong! I sauteed the onion in butter and crushed garlic. I only had Ziti pasta, so that's what I used. I threw in whatever shredded cheese I had on hand, cheddar, mozz, and a Mexican blend. I didn't have any fresh parsley, or pimento peppers on hand so I added some leftover chopped green beans to the onion garlic mixture for about a minute.  After everything was mixed up, I then added some blue cheese crumbles. It was delicious! Thank you Susan for a tasty, adaptable recipe!! I'll be making this one again.

I thought this tasted pretty good. It was so quick to throw together to! I really liked that it did'n't have to go in the oven, and be baked after it was done, dirtying more dishes. The only change I made was using butter with canola oil and reduced fat cheese. I didn't have all the ham suggested, but it didn't see to be a problem. After I started making it, I realized I didn't have the pimentos or a good subtitute either. It is a tad salty, but when is cooking with cream of soups ever not. It is creamy though. It reminded me a lot of turkey tettrazini which I really like. Thank you

EASY and tasty way to use leftover ham.  I didn't have the parsley or pimento peppers, but it was good without them - even better when I added just a bit of prepared mustard (apx 1 tsp).  I will be making this again whenever I have leftover ham.

4.5 Stars: This was super easy and I thought the sauteed onions made a big difference. I used a ham steak and probably had more ham than called for, but it was a good amount. I added a little extra cheese, too.

I didn't have the pimentos or the fresh parsley.  I did however add garlic in with the onion as I was worried about the lack of spices.  It still was a little bland for my families tastes.  They all agreed that it was good but could have used a little bit more.  Will try next time with some more garlic, celery, and Parmesan cheese.  Very quick and easy

This was amazing for how simple and quick it is! I was astonished. I did add some garlic powder (lack of garlic cloves)with some other seasonings and sauted green bells with the onions. My family loved every bite of it even the very picky eaters. I will be making this again in the near future.

I LOVED THIS! I took a suggestion from someone here to change the water to chicken broth. And I didn't have a pimento so I used a dying red bell pepper I had in the frig. This was a hit with my husband who is a very critical person of food. I loved it myself!

Fantastic! So quick and very yummy! The whole family really liked this. I did take advise of some reviews as well as making more servings than the recipe calls for.  I used a whole package of whole wheat noodles. I used a half an onion and added garlic. I did used the can of cr of mushroom soup and 1/2 a can of water (so slightly more than 1/2c) a cup of shredded cheddar, about 1/2c white wine, and a 1lb ham steak; I did add the pimento and parsley too.  Oh and I added a half bag of frozen broccoli.  Not only was it delicious, it looked so terrific too.  Maybe not a fancy meal but very good and most important to me was how quick it came together. Definitely having this regularly!

my family and i really liked this dish (including my very picky almost 2yr old) It came together really quick great way to get rid of left over ham. I doubled the reciped and used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken since that's all i had. I left the pimentos out and used angel hair pasta and  added some salt and pepper. I'd definately will make this again.

I used broccoli instead of parsley and pimento peppers, and no onion.  Served over rice instead of noodles.  Husband and kids devoured it!  So easy, and saved my bacon on one of those "Aaahh, it's 4:30pm and I still haven't figured out dinner!" nights.  Thank you Susan!

Good recipe, I'll make it again. I made it in my crockpot instead of the stovetop. I skipped the onions, butter, pimento and fresh parsley completely. In the crockpot I mixed the cream of mushroom soup with milk instead of water, added the ham, used mozzarella & romano cheese instead of cheddar, added a can of mushrooms & some onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, and dried parsley and let it all cook for a few hours. Then I cooked the spaghetti, mixed it with the sauce and topped with fresh grated romano.

Yum.  As some others have advised, I used 1/2 white wine and 1/2 water, and it gave it a lovely flavour.  Also added two cloves of garlic in with the onion, because... well... I love garlic!  Doubled the cheese, but that was because I misread the recipe.  The hardest part about this yummy dish for me was getting it to the table for the family, rather than eating it straight out of the pan after I tasted.  Delish!

This was a great recipe.  I, too, made a couple changes for my taste.  I sauted lots of minced garlic (about 2 tablespoons.  My family loves garlic) with the onions.  Then instead of water, I used about 3/4 can of chicken broth because I had more noodles and needed to get more sauce than the original recipe.  I also followed another review and chopped up very small fresh broccoli pieces and added about 2/3 cup when I added the ham. This was perfect for my taste, but if you like your veggies soft, then the broccoli should be added with the soup so it can cook longer.  I added pepper to the finished product and parsley for the final touch.  Since I cooked this dish for a potluck dinner, I used fetticini noodles so when I reheated it, I didn't end up with a dried-up mush pile.  I also added some milk upon reheat to moisten up the dish.

this makes a quick, tasty meal!  I was able to use up some leftover angel hair pasta, and it went over really well with my husband.  Changes I made:  I doubled the cheese, and used half sharp cheddar, half cheddar/jack mix.  I added 1/2c green onions, and a little minced garlic while I sauteed the onions.  I also thought it looked a little dry, so added about 3/4 c milk while it simmered.  Yum!

I made this recipe for my family a few days ago with leftover ham.  I normally stay away from recipes with canned soup, but this sounded so easy and different for a quick meal.  It was a big hit and I will be making this again.

This was really good!  My alterations were adding garlic, bell peppers, a bit more ham & cheese.  Added some cajun seasoning and used egg noodles. I didn't add the parsley or pimentos.

It seems really versatile to add whatever you have on hand.

after a long afternoon of negotiating for a new car, i was frazzled. dinner was overdue and the kids were hungry. i had looked at this recipe the night before and decided to try it. what a hit! it was quick, easy, and delicious. i subbed fat free half and half for the water, which gave me a thick, creamy sauce. thanks for helping me to use those easter ham leftovers.

I enjoyed this recipe very much! My hubby wasn't as thrilled but he doesn't have a taste for trying new things. I subbed 1/2 cup water with 1/4 water and 1/4 cooking wine and also added some parm cheese. I also used cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom. This recipes also gets an A+ for leftovers. It does not lose it's creaminess after reheating. Yummy!!

One of those 'couldn't be easier' recipes...I also added a clove of garlic and freshly ground black pepper.  Because I didn't have the mushroom soup, I ended up using cream of chicken - still thought it tasted great.  Hubby loved it, too.  I will definitely be making again!!

This was soooo good.  Rich & creamy.  Great way to use left over ham.  I diced up some leftover ham and threw it in the freezer and pulled it out for this recipe.  Next time I think I'll add some frozen peas and mushrooms. Real good.

Very tasty!  I left out the pimento and parsley since I didn't have any on hand, and I sprinkled a few dried bread crumbs over the top just before serving.  I also added a little more ham to mine to make my hubby happy.  Great recipe!

Very easy to make.  I left out the pimento and parsely.  A definite repeat.

Darn good recipe...though, like many pasta dishes it accepts tweakings. I added Mushrooms and certainly used Pimento's and fresh Parsley as called for which helps a lot. Broccoli is NOT an instead of ingredient...it's just an added one...as I did for some additional green (besides Parsley) and nutrition. I added Cayenne Pepper , giving it a mild heat bite (be careful).

Not sure why anyone would say it doesn't have much flavor.  Now to be fair, I did substitute chicken broth for most of the water.  But that was the only thing I did different besides leaving out the pimentos because my kids would never eat it.  I did have a farm-raised smoked ham that was fantastic to add to this, but this turned out incredible.   Can't wait for my kids to try it for dinner tonight. (I had to cheat and grab a little bite for lunch after tasting the sauce)

This was delicious and very easy to put together in a hurry. I changed the amount of spagetti to about 10 ounces which I don't believe changed the outcome. This will go into our regular rotation whenever we have ham leftovers. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is quite bland; doesn't have much flavor.  My daughter (6) is accustomed to meals with flavor and she didn't like this.  It needs some adjustment.  I might give it another try and add sour cream when adding the soup, add minced garlic with the onions and don't cook as long, add some ground pepper.  I also had put in chopped red pepper to replace the pimentos which may have contributed to the blandness.

Just made this dinner with leftovers.  It was AWESOME! I did make a few changes. Added 2 cloves of garlic as per other comments and used both cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup. I also used leftover cheese dip (processed cheese and Rotel tomatoes)from New Year's Eve party as there is no shredded cheese in the house. Left out pimentos & parsley, used milk for a creamier sauce. Topped each serving with Parmesan cheese. Served with leftover french bread with garlic butter and steamed the leftover veggies from the party on the side. Wonderful use of the leftovers. Only took soup & spaghetti out of the pantry. Everything else was leftovers.  Love this recipe!!!

I was looking for something fast for dinner with ingredients I had lying around and came up with this. It was fast and pretty good too. I will definitely make this again however, I think I will try it with some white wine for a bit more flavor in the sauce. It was in need of a little more oomph to be a 5 star recipe.

Very easy, good way to use up leftover Christmas ham. Doubled it up used, one can cream of mush, one can cream of chicken (cause I accidentally opened it) milk instead of water and threw in a bag of frozen peas. Tasted good. Will make again for sure. Thanks!

OMG it was so good with the changes I read or added. Did not try original recipe after reading suggestions but it is probably good too. I used casarecce pasta (sort like a ziti but not as heavy) instead of spaghetti, thick julienned the ham instead of chopped, fat free cream of mushroom and cabots 75% fat free cheddar.  I did the 1/4 water & White wine, added the 1/4 parmesan, I sautéed the onions with sweet red peppers chopped, garlic and added some green peas. Only from my experience with cheese sauces and fondues I added a little nutmeg and mustard after the cheese. I decided to cook in casserole dish in oven so added a little fresh ground black pepper and dried fried onions on top..... Yum!

I have leftover ham every time I make a ham.  This recipe is my family's favorite way to use up that ham.  It's quick and easy and even easy enough to change up so we never get tired of it.  Mostly we just add leftover veggies to it like broccoli and peas or even carrots.  Very fun meal.

This was really easy and like the others, I made a couple of adjustments to the residence.  I used cream of chicken soup, a little extra sharp cheddar cheese, Italian seasoning, and about 1-2 tbs of horseradish mustard.  It was awesome!!

Really enjoyed this as a good way to use left over ham.  I also had mushrooms in the refrigerator, so made the mushroom soup from scratch.  Chives abundant in the garden right now, so I think that would be good sprinkled on top when served.

Great recipe!!  Thank you for sharing!  Quick, easy, and simple to add/substitute ingredients - I used cream of chicken, 3 cheeses (sharp cheddar, mozzarella, parmesan); added 2 tbsp of greek yogurt, fresh mushrooms, and topped with diced tomatoes and parsley.  Mahalo!

This is an excellent easy recipe. I used ramen noodles and added a bag of frozen california mix veggies, a small jar of mushrooms, extra onion, and a lot of black pepper. I also substituted milk for water, and cream of chicken for cream of mushroom soup. My family loved it.

Thumbs up from everyone. As is the mushroom overpowers the cheese and the sauce is too heavy. Add milk to dilute, salt, pepper, and could add more cheddar. My kids wanted more ham too. Next time I'm going to throw in dome peas which would add veggie and color.

Delicious! I used chinese noodles (chow mein) and took another persons suggestion of using milk instead of water and sharp chedder. We also used a shallot instead of regular onion and added some red pepper flakes and lots of fresh ground pepper. It is a keeper

This pasta recipe was very good. I used an entire onion, red bell pepper, garlic and green peas. I also used some "Slap Your Momma" to add some spice along with celery salt and black pepper. I also used fresh vegetable fettuccine (green and red). The dish itself is very good and an excellent way to use left over ham. I think that a tubular, sturdier pasta might make more sense than my fresh pasta since the sauce is a bit dense and weighed down my pasta. We will eat left overs tomorrow so it was very economical as well. Thanks for the recipe.

Really good base recipe for personal tastes.  We doubled the cheese and used Swiss in addition to cheddar. Also added garlic, bell pepper, broccoli, mushrooms, and black pepper.  Subbed milk for the water and the result was creamy, cheesey, saucy goodness.

this was VERY tasty - I doubled up on everything and used 1 lb of rigatoni instead.  I didn't have the  pimientos thought so skipped that ingredient.  Next time I think I will try using cream of celery soup or cream of asparagus just to give a little more 'veggie' flavor.  It was also incredibly easy - everything is cooked in one pan, then you add the cooked pasta and you are done!

This was quick and easy.  I too adjusted a few things. Instead of water chicken broth, to onions I added broccoli, peppers, and frozen peas. For spices I used garlic, marjoram, thyme, pepper and cajun.  It was delicious.  My husband can't wait for me to make this again. It was a big hit.

I doubled the recipe the first initial time, and it was wonderful.  I added a four cup of chopped red onion for kick and added 3 cups of ham.  And added peas instead of pimento.  Delicious!!!

Quick, easy, & tasty recipe. Because I like to encourage eating veggies, I added a cup of carrot/peas. Put the frozen veggies in a colander and thawed under running water, then added to partially sauteed onions and finished cooking, Omitted the pimento, only because I didn't have on hand.

For some reason, this tasted better to me than the usual cream soup casserole. I did bake it for about 25 minutes, and I used milk instead of water.

This was great comfort food.  I, too, had some left over ham to use up and saw it on the buzz this morning.  I added about 1 tsp of minced garlic along with salt, pepper and a pinch of cajun seasoning while sauteing the onion in only 1 tbls of butter.  I used chicken broth instead of water and and 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  It's more than 4 servings for us but that's perfect, I'll have lunch left over.

I was really surprised on how easy this came together.  It was quite tasty.  I think the addition of 1/4 c. of white wine added some flavor to the cream sauce.

This recipe was really easy to make and follow.  The whole family enjoyed it and it was a great use for leftover ham.  All in all a wonderful "pantry" dish.

This was a great recipe for using leftover ham. It's very versatile too, any extra ingredients you have on hand you can toss in and it tastes great. I used the Swanson flavor boost pouches in the sauce, and fresh garlic. It turned out great. The ham I made wasn't that great, so it didn't taste the best, but the tetrazzini itself was really good. Chicken and turkey go great with tetrazzini too. Next time ill use those rather than ham. Altogether a great, easy recipe, I'll definitely make this again.

This was so easy and delicious! Modified using Swiss cheese, peas and utilized pasta shells versus spaghetti. Family loved it! Made it twice post-Christmas using up holiday ham.

Declicious! And a great way to use up some of our leftover Christmas ham.  I made a few adjustments, based on what we had on hand.  We didn't have onion, so I used celery and garlic instead. I used half water and half white wine. And I tossed in some parmesan cheese and some white pepper, with just a dash of cayenne pepper for added kick. Loved it!

I love that this was super easy to make with my leftover ham. I made it as a one pot meal so few dishes. The 3 toddlers here all had seconds (it is pretty bland, maybe because I did not use pimentos). Adding mushrooms works well if you are a mushroom fan like me.

This was good and easy.  I made a few modifications in doubling the recipe.  I used the mushroom soup but also used a container of Herb & Garlic Cream Cheese cooking sauce.  It gave it a bit of punch.  Also added a bit of pepper.

Thanks for the recipe Susan. It is a good base idea to use left over ham. For my family's preferences and to use what I had in the kitchen, I replaced the peppers with mushrooms and added fresh oregano and black pepper. Thanks again, we really enjoyed it.

This was OK for a quick meal that uses up leftover ham, but it wasn't anything that I would make again.  Kind of bland, not that much flavor.  Kids weren't crazy about it and neither was I to be honest.  But it was quick and easy to make so that is a plus.

Good recipe for those in need  a quick meal. Instead of canned soup, used leftover whipping cream, real mushrooms, red peppers, garlic and some other herbs to give it a bit of zing. Kids loved it.

I have been making this casserole for years - it's one of my comfort foods. 
I always top it with cheddar and sometimes bread crumbs and bake it at 350' for 30 to 40 minutes to finish it off. I have to force myself to stop eating more - it is that good!

Great meal! I used 1/2 c. chicken broth instead of water and roasted red peppers (1/2 c). I also added 1 t onion powder, 1/2 t pepper, and 1 t of garlic sauteed with the onions.  Then I added some cooked broccoli pieces at the end and it made a tasty, colorful dish!!

Excellent, easy, inexpensive - yum! I didn't have pimentos, used dried parsley, shredded cheddar jack & no water. Topped with parmesan cheese. I also used wide egg noodles instead of spaghetti noodles. Soooooo good even my picky 3 year old loved it. Thanks for sharing!

I have a very picky eater at home, so I left out the pimento peppers. My picky eater actually ate it, so in my book this is a winner. I gave it four stars because it was a little bit bland, but maybe the pimentos spice things up.

I used some left over Thanksgiving ham from the freezer.  Like so many others, I made a few revisions – more onion, a couple of garlic cloves and some fresh mushroom slices, olive oil with the butter and simmered for about 45 minutes to an hour on the lowest heat after sautéing the garlic and onions and adding the soup, chicken broth instead of water and the cheese.  We had it over angel hair pasta and it was sooo yummy.  Thank you for a delicious recipe that is so adaptable to what each cook as available in their pantry and refrigerator.

I made this last night and I thought it was a great leftover ham recipe.  I followed some of the other reviewers and added garlic and increased the amount of chopped onion.  I also used cream of chicken soup because I did not have cream of mushroom on hand.  I am looking forward to the leftovers tonight!

This was very good - I know this will sound weird but I had a little leftover marinara sauce and stirred that in before baking and it was great!

My family really liked this. I doubled the sauce though, because it was a little dry when I first put it on the spaghetti. When I make this again, I think I am going to omit the whole butter and onion step. There is really no need for it. Loved the leftovers the next day.

I was skeptical but very pleasantly surprised. I will be using this recipe again the next time I have left over ham to use.

This was simple and quick to put together.  I used angel hair noodles and cheeses (Parmesan, cheedar and jack) I had on hand to make a half cup.  I also used milk in place of the water.  While it was pretty good, I doubt I will make it again.

I am giving this 5 stars b/c each the 4 members of my family thought it was great, and I was sure my husband was going to turn his nose up at it. I have to say that I was skeptical b/c the base was soup, but the flavor was there. Really creamy, too. Great way to use leftover ham, and it couldn't have been easier to make.  I followed the recipe exactly - always do the first time I make anything.  Thanks for sharing!

I used almost fat-free mushroom soup and only 1/4 C. cheese. My husband and I have weird hours, so he eats a lot of left overs. He talks about this meal every day when we chat about what he ate for dinner that day. Kudos.

I added a little milk at the end because it seemed dry.  I used whole wheat wide egg noodles.  My little kids did like this recipe.  I thought it lacked flavor.

Quick and tasty! I did omit the onions, sauteed 2 cloves of garlic in a skillet with my frozen cubed ham in 1 T. butter, omitted the pimentos, and used dried parsley. I also used 1/3 of a cup milk instead of the water to make a creamier sauce. It was very smooth and flavorful, thanks!

This is a fast meal and kid pleaser.  My son liked it more than my husband and I.  I usually keep a bag of chopped ham in the freezer to make a fast meal and this recipe was a nice addition to my ham recipes.  Thanks.

I made it pretty much as the recipe states. My husband and I agree it would be better on ravioli. It’s pretty thick for a spaghetti sauce but it is delicious.

Turned out pretty good, and used up the leftover ham we were getting tired of eating! Looks like lots of people make changes to this recipe. I did change a couple things as well. I added minced garlic and used roasted red peppers since I had no pimento.  Other than that, after cooking on the stovetop, I put it in a pan and added some Parmesan, additional cheese and some fried onions on top and broiled it for a couple minutes. Added a little crunch to the top and made it more casserole-esque. But I think everyone would have liked it either way.

I doubled.  Used 1 can cr chx and 1 can cr mush soup and 2 c triple cheddar cheese.  Instead of water, I used 1/2 c chx broth and 1/2 c milk.  I also added some garlic and pepper.  I had planned to add peas but forgot.  My husband thought it was too creamy.  Kids ate it.  I thought it was fine for an easy meal, but nothing I will rush to make again.

Great base recipe. Quick and delicious. I used milk instead of water and added garlic when I was cooking the onions. You could add so many things to change up this meal. I will definitely make again.

Great, easy dish. I used a can of cream of chicken/mushroom soup, added a very few extra veggies that I sauteed with the onion and used half wine, half milk instead of water. We'll have this again and again. Thanks for the recipe!

Substituted milk for water and added a can of mushrooms. After all was combined,  placed in casserole dish, topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and baked for 20 minutes. Great ham dish.

This was amazing. I used the recipe as a base and added the following: sautéed onions with garlic and mushrooms to add a bit more flavor. I then added about 1/2 cup of cream cheese, substituted chicken broth for water, added about 1/2 cup of shredded Parmesan cheese and increased the amount of cheddar. I then added a bit of fat free half and half. Mixed it all together, put in a casserole dish covered with mozzarella and cooked till top browned.

Great quick, easy recipe that’s very tasty. I will definitely make this again. I had garlic mushroom soup on hand and no pimentos but it was great. My husband liked it too. Next time I’ll try it with the pimentos, they would really add a nice flavor. Thanks for sharing!

Enjoyed making this quick concoction. Added a splash of white wine, plus chicken stock, and peas because we didn't have fresh parsley. Put dried parsley through  the mortar and pestle and I think the parsley is a key flavoring to this dish. A dash of seasoning salt finished the dish.

My husband and mother in law REALLY loved this; both had three helpings!  I actually poured all into a baking dish and topped with butter coated panko for a crispy element then popped it under the broiler for a few minutes until golden brown. My husband said it would be even better to top instead  with buttery Ritz crackers (add extra butter by browning broken crackers in pan with butter then putting on casserole then under the broiler.)

Delicious recipe.  Added green pepper, 1/4 cup onion, 1 tsp minced garlic.  Used 1/4 c. white wine and 1/4 c. water.  The rest of the recipe was the same.  Loved it.  Oh, I didn't use pimento.

I made it as per the recipe but without the permento's. It was ok but i will definitely add seasoning and maybe see if the kids will let me get away with adding some steamed veg. They approve of it and want it again.

Loved this! I was out of pimento so I used a tiny bit of siracha and some freeze dried peppers. I like to add French fried onions on top before putting it in the oven for extra crunch and flavor.

Made it with leftover Easter ham. I did take the advice of various reviews and changed the recipe a bit. I used milk instead of water, added minced garlic, a whole onion and yellow chopped pepper. I also used more cheddar cheese and parmesan. Just eyeball it in the pot for thickness and add more milk if necessary. It was good!

I’ve made this a few times now. I did increase the amount of cheese, used milk instead of water as another reviewer suggested and used an additional cup of ham.  A nice quick meal!  I did find it a little bland the find time I made it but have been experimenting with different spices to give it a little kick. On the rare occasion we have leftover bacon I will dice that up and throw it in as well.

My first Tetrazzini.  It was great, but I had to make lots of substitutions cause we are cleaning out the refrigerator for Snow birding. 1. Canned cream soups are too salty for my 60+ diet. I sautéed the mushrooms and onions adding canned evaporated milk. 2 I used cream cheese that was on hand. Served 3.

This is a great pasta base. I’m was honestly better than expected! I had a ton of leftover ham and needed to do something with it. This was easy (had everything on hand) and pretty quick. I think I would enjoy chicken in this sauce instead of ham.

This was a quick perfect meal for leftover Christmas ham. I made  a few changes for allergy friendliness (and I’m super picky). I used cream of chicken and I also used elbow macaroni instead of spaghetti noodles. I noticed there wasn’t any seasoning so I added pepper in the sauce as well as salt and (since we have pasta) garlic salt. I also added shredded cheese once plated and my son LOVED IT!!

I used white wine in place of water and added some milk. Also I did not have pimiento so I used red peppers and sautéed them with the onion. I used dried parsley because I did not have any fresh on hand. I followed JulieCC's advice and added garlic too! Turned out great!!

This is almost exactly how I've been making mine for 30 years. The only thing i do differently is add a tbsp of worcestershire sauce and I use golden mushroom soup. My family loves it everytime I make it.

I  didn't have pimentos, so I added extra herbs (fresh oregano and basil).  I'm not a great cook, so I'm pleased with how it turned out.  Easy - tasty  - definitely a keeper.

This dish is perfect for what it is. Good, crowd-pleasing comfort food and most importantly quick and easy. I enjoy cooking healthy, exciting recipes with lots of prep work. There are also times when I'm feeling lazy, not in the mood to experiment and just want to make something easy that pretty much everyone will like. Everyone loved it and asked for me to make it again so that makes it five star for me. It is a little bland for most adult tastes imo but it makes a good base to customize to personal tastes.  I personally would add a little more cheddar cheese and veggies (broccoli, cherry tomatoes, basil, whatever you have in your freezer) and some fresh parmesan cheese and pepper.  This is going in my favorites, thanks!

I recommend seasoning it to your taste, but delicious. I used the noodle water with cream of celery. Next time I'll season it more though.

My family did not care for this recipe.  We found it to be a little too rich/heavy/creamy for our taste.  It did have good flavor  and would be fine for folks that are accustomed to this type of meal (we tend to eat lighter/fresher).

Tried this to use up leftover ham from Easter dinner.  Husband raved about it and said he hoped we have leftover ham more often.  This will have many reruns at our house.

This was great just changed things up a bit . I didn't have any fresh parsley or pimento peppers so I added some frozen peas and carrots also used low fat mushroom soup and low fat shredded Cheddar cheese. Definitely a keeper for my recipe box especially since I have always found it difficult to find good recipes to use up leftover ham

Made this with some left over ham from New Years and it was wonderful. I didn't have mushroom soup so made my own cream sauce with rue, cream and white wine. I also added fresh mushrooms and fire roasted peppers instead of pimento. It was great!  thanks for this it goes into rotation .

Added celery  and bell peppers and increased the onion to the saute. Otherwise made as directed. It was a hit with a side salad and garlic toast.

Simple, easy and tasty.  You could easily add a vegetable (like broccoli) to beef up the portion sizes or add some garlic for more zing.

I used spaghetti squash, and next time would like to use more flavors.  My husband and I think gouda cheese perhaps! And, I accidentally got cilantro instead of parsley which was yummy!  Maybe I will actually try the parsley next time.

I made this tonight. I made a few changes to my own tastes, but not many. I added some garlic and pepper, used chicken broth instead of water, I used Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese and doubled the amount, then added peas and about double the ham. I also ended up needing almost double the chicken broth (or water) than the recipe called for. It really is a good recipe and I'll make it again.

I kicked up a bit because I was afraid it would be too bland. I substituted blue cheese for the cheddar, added some fresh garlic, a touch of ground cloves and cayenne pepper, and a pinch of korinje cinnamon. Added a half of a vidalia onion and a half of green bell pepper, minced. I omitted the pimento. Subbed milk for water and threw in a splash of German brandy. Used farfalle pasta instead of spaghetti for a different mouth feel. I love to play with basic recipes like this!  Great way to use up the ham I had in the freezer.

This is a great cheap meal.My husband loved it. The only thing I changed was I used milk instead of water for a little more nutrition. Next time I will add a couple of tablespoons of green peppers for more flavour.

I will make it again. I modified it by doubling the diced ham, adding a small package of frozen peas and about 1/2--2/3 cup of white wine near the end, stirring until peas are thawed and the sauce is blended and smooth. Served it with a healthy serving of freshly ground black pepper and some freshly-grated parmesan. This one's a keeper.

It was delish!!! After reading some of the reviews, I did make a few changes. I used milk instead of water. Added a few cloves of garlic to the onion and butter. And used shredded romaneo cheese along with the shredded cheddar.  One can of cream of mush and one can of cream of chick. (I doubled the recipe).  Yum yum!! 
Great way to use that leftover ham :)

The whole family loved this dish. It's a great way to use up leftover ham. I did not have pimento and thought it needed something green so I added a cup of frozen peas at the end and some quartered cherry tomatoes, about eight. I will make this again.

This recipe was decent but rather bland. Most of the flavor came from the ham, which is not ideal for a pasta recipe. I subbed milk for the water and threw in seasoned salt, celery salt, fresh ground pepper, paprika, and 4 minced garlic cloves to add some flavor. I also added parmesan. Served over whole grain spaghetti noodles.

Followed another reviewer's comments to use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, sauteed 1 small onion, 2 garlic cloves and  1/2 of small bell pepper in butter. I also used 2 cups ham instead of one.  Still needed a little more seasoning so will play with it a little more next time.

This was such an excellent meal that filled my family up. I only adjusted and added a few things that others had tried. I added broccoli, a little garlic, mixed shredded cheese (mild cheddar and sharp) used Cream of Celery instead since that is what I had in my pantry and added a little milk ( 1/4 water, 1/4 milk) and mixed in the can of Cream of Celery and then added it. I served with homemade biscuits and a toss salad. This is a keeper for sure since I don't even have left overs. :-)

I used Cream of Chicken soup, white wine, garlic, celery, red pepper, cheddar cheese, and a dollop of Dijon mustard. added 1/2 cup plain yogurt.

Changed this up a bit because of the ingredients I had on hand. I used a half onion, doubled the ham, added mushrooms and used red pepper instead of pimiento. I added 1 cup of old cheddar and some fresh pepper.  It was quick and easy. I served on Linguini instead of spaghetti.

This was great! I used a can of cream of chicken/cream of mushroom because i didn't have a can of regular cream of mushroom and i didn't have an onion but it was excellent! I didn't add any extra seasoning and I didn't think it needed it. Maybe it was the type of ham i used but it had a wonderful smokey flavor to it and was incredibly creamy.  Will be adding this to the monthly menu!

Sooooo full of flavor but also quick and easy.  I sauteed the ham right along with the onion to give it some texture and flavor oomph.  Variations - I used half white wine half water for the liquid, added a combo of shredded parmesan and shredded cheddar, cream of chicken soup and rotini pasta  -- just because those are things I had at the time.  This recipe is so flexible and would work with many different combos/add-ins depending on what you have on hand.   The family gave it great reviews -- it's a keeper!

I made a huge ham for Easter and wanted to find some recipes to make with all that leftover ham. This was FANTASTIC! I followed the recipe exactly and it was absolutely the most delicious dish I've made in a long time.

I made this tonight for dinner with leftover spiral ham.  I added chopped red pepper instead of pimento, I added chopped garlic clove, milk instead of water and more cheddar cheese and frozen peas. My family loved it.  It's a great way to use up leftover ham.

Pretty good. Followed the suggestion of doing 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup white wine and adding an additional 1/4 cup of parmesean cheese. Next time I would add some mushrooms. I skipped the pimentos and as a result it needed some extra flavoring. Will need to try some seasonings next time!

This was really good. I didn't have pimentos but I diced up half a bell pepper, half an onion, a couple teaspoons of minced garlic, and sautéed that in butter until tender. I also added Parmesan cheese. My husband is a picky eater and he loved it! He thought the sauce would be good as a dip, too.

Added some garlic, green and red peppers as well. Was edible but would not make again. Would probably be better with a fresh made Alfredo sauce rather then the mushroom soup.

I made this dish last night and lovvvved it! However, I added more cream of mushroom, more cheese and added peas for a pop of color. More importantly, it was a quick fix and turned out to be a crowd pleaser, (my husband.) ;-)

We tried this recipe last night. As it was all I had on hand, I used cream of chicken soup instead. Also, per reviewer's suggestions, I sautéed a whole onion and added minced garlic. Finally, I deglazed the pan with a 1/4cp. of white wine. To get some vegetables into my husband, I threw in 1cp. broccoli, which added pretty color. This recipe was a big hit! Satisfying, comfort food and a great way to use up leftover baked ham.

We really liked this!  All I changed was: Added a chicken bouillon cube to the water, and added garlic to the onion saute.  Other than that, made as directed.  Hubby said this one's a keeper.  I could see adding veggies as other reviewers suggested.  Will try that next time!

I made this tonight and after reading some of the reviews, I used 1/2 yellow onion chopped and 2 cloves garlic sautéed in butter, I added a can of mushrooms, chopped, 1 tsp pepper,  2 cups chopped spiral honey ham and then added 1/2 cup of white wine, 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup chicken broth and the cream of mushroom soup.   I shredded 1 cup of white sharp cheddar cheese and let simmer for 30 minutes.  Serve over pasta and it was awesome!!

The family loved it.  I played with the recipe a bit but I think it is surely just as good as written.  I didn't have pimento so I used a red pepper that I sautéed with the onion (also tossed some minced garlic in because why not) and what was left of a bag of frozen peas.  Also, I used 2 cans of soup because I wanted a lot of sauce.  And, I only used the cheese as a garnish, with the parsley.  I am sure it would have been better if I used the cheese in the sauce, but I was trying to save some calories.  Also, I only had Angel Hair pasta.  I think this needs a thicker noodle though.

Great recipe, especially for ham leftovers.  I used red bell pepper.  Although I am sometimes wary of recipes that use cream of mushroom, I thought this was great.

This recipe was a perfect find for extra ham. The taste was so great! I followed this recipe exactly for ingredients but used a different pasta type, mac style, since I had extra already boiled. It reminded me of those boxed type "helper" meals but with so much more. I'll make this again!

I usually don't make anything calling for canned soups, but it was in the cupboard, I had all the ingredients, annnnnd it was THE BEST! I used what I had on hand, rotini pasta (to hold more of the yummy sauce), sautéed fresh spring thyme with the onions, and splashed a bit of cream in at the end. Oh, and boiled some frozen peas with the pasta, to get those veggies!
After that, we immediately took half to in laws and some to our elderly neighbor, it was that good. Thanks!

l didn't have the peppers or the parsely on hand and the sauce was bland without them.  Next time I'll have to plan ahead so we aren't missing them.  Otherwise, we enjoyed the dish.

We used golden cream of mushroom instead, added a bit of minced garlic and substituted milk for water.  All and all it was really good but wish we would have used thicker cubed ham.  The ham we used was sliced thin so not enough of a meat taste.  This is quick and easy to prepare and is nice to add to the rotation of meals.

It was pretty good - I added fresh garlic and cut up asparagus and it came out great.  Great meal made from left over Christmas ham.

This is a hit in my house! Made a few changes though. I boiled the pasta in half chicken broth and half water, reserved some afterwards and added it in with milk instead of water to make a little less thick. I also didn't have pimento or parsley on hand so I added broccoli for color and nutrients ;) in addition to the cheddar I added some parm and it came out great. We will definitely be adding this to our weekly eats.

We liked this and its a good pantry ready dinner, nothing fancy but it was quick and satisfying.  I didn't have pimentos or fresh parsley, so I left them out.  I used linguine pasta because its what I had on hand.  I also added some frozen corn to it because corn and ham are always a good combination in our house.  My 5 year old and 2 year old both loved it and ate seconds.

used a leftover grilled pork chop that i cut up into cubes for the ham, bowtie pasta for the spaghetti, didn't have any pimento peppers, and i threw in some sweet corn.. i ended up adding onion powder and parmesan, then worcestershire, and finally, copious amounts of black pepper in hopes of saving it.. bf said he liked the end product and said not to change a thing..

I was looking for a recipe with some left over ham I had. I found this recipe searching through this site. It was very easy and I had all the ingredients on hand. My family loved it and incidentally, friends of mine showed up, they joined us for dinner and they loved it as well. I did add a little more onion than the recipe asked for but everything else was done according to the recipe above. Great recipe!

I did not care for this recipe. I rarely make anything with "cream of..." soup, but wanted to use up the leftover Easter ham. Will NOT be making this again.

Followed the recipe to a T (weird, right?) It was just alright. My 2 year old scooped it up, and my super picky 4 year old tried it. Si for that I'm rating it higher. I got about 6 bites into it and kept thinking.. "I don't want to put more of this in my mouth." It was a quick, decent meal for Easter ham leftovers, and I might be ok with eating this once a year. Think Kraft Mac n Cheese with a heavy dose of pimento flavor meets angel hair pasta. My tip: add double the ham, it's the only thing that gives the meal any texture.

I really enjoyed this.  Personally I added more ham hand onions and didn't use pimiento, and only 1 tsp of parsley.  But overall I loved it.  Thanks for the recipe =D  .

I made a few small changes to this recipe and it was ok. I used Mozzarella instead of Cheddar, and diced red pepper instead of Pimento. My fiance and I liked it but thought it was a bit bland. I will try it again but make a few changes.
