This bread is so delicious and easy to make.  I was afraid the with 2 T. of anise seed it would be a bit too much spice but it turned out so good!

Everyone loved this bread and the glaze was an extra special touch! I loved it warmed with honey butter!

Amazing fresh out of the machine! The Glaze makes it. It didn't mention, but I slightly chopped the nuts with their skins on (I had trouble skinning them), all turned out well.

Great taste, both of bread and of frosting!  The bread texture is smooth, even with half of the flour as whole wheat.  Great recipe!

I made this and it was amazing! A little bit challenging though for a novice baker like myself.

Great flavor. However, I took out the anise seeds and cinnamon, as I like neither.
But oh so wonderful. And don't forget the amazing eggnog glaze!
