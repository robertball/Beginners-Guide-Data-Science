Really great flavor, especially for a meatloaf.  I did cut this down to feed only 6.  To cut down on the grease, use ground chuck or sirloin beef and use lean pork sausage and I trimmed the excess fat off of the bacon.  Mixed a little chili sauce into the ketchup to give the glaze a nice kick.  Nice time I might mince some jalapeno peppers in.

Well, I did not put in the spinach, black olives or pistachios - my family wouldn't go for that in meatloaf! However, with bacon and jack cheese, I don't think this meatloaf CAN go wrong! I did add some garlic powder, worchestershire sauce, and 1/2 can of Hunt's meatloaf tomato sauce (and put the other half on top of the meatloaf).

I'm always looking for different ways of making the same old meatloaf and this was certainly it! I used turkey sausage and added a bit of cayenne pepper, I skipped the nuts and the meatloaf seasoning mix as there's way too much salt in that for my taste. I made up for it by adding my own seasonings. Yummy and thanks!

This is a totally awsome recipe! It has alot of depth and flavor. I did leave out the pistachio nuts and instead of ground beef I used ground turkey to cut cost. The flavor remained consistant and it still had a nice moist texture. Once again it is a very succulent recipe that 6 out of 7 of my family members enjoyed and said we'd definately make this again!

I cut down this recipe significantly to feed two people for dinner and to have left overs for dinner the next day. We both thought this was a tasty meatloaf.

This is quite the meatloaf!  Like many others I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings, but still had a large meatloaf on my hands.  Large but delicious!  Other than leaving out the pistachio nuts I kept to the recipe, but next time I would probably add my own seasonings instead of the prepared ones, most to cut down the salt.  We enjoyed this for 2 dinners and are still enjoying the sandwiches.

I have tried many recipes for meatloaf.  This is the meatloaf ever. It is a favorite and we will make again.  I modified the recipe for 6 servings and even that left ample leftovers.

Great recipe. Cut it in half and still had 2 good sized meatloafs. Thought it might be interesting to try this is 2 types of pans - the standard 13X9X2 baking dish worked fine. We'll see how the bread pan works ;)

I did make a few changes (I know this annoys people - oh well). I didn't have pepper jack, so used blue cheese and it was fantastic. Also substituted cocktail sauce for 50% of the ketchup (would have used horseradish if I had it). I loved the little extra kick. I also forgot to buy "meatloaf seasoning" so had to look up what was in it - just as easy to list out the raw ingredients. 

Fantastic meatloaf - possibly best I have ever had. Addition of pistachios is great idea. Was a little afraid of the olives (I hate olives), but out of respect for the recipe I kept them in (although I did pur√©e the olives).

Updated to say this was a pretty awful meatloaf. Four years later, my family still teases me for the "spinach meatloaf" I made on that fateful winter night. There was simply something weird about spinach in a meatloaf, and how it soaked up all of the fat from the ground beef. The taste was peculiar. I'm a very good cook normally, so my teenagers in particular love to have something that turned out badly to tease me about. At least there's that!

Here is my original review:  I followed the recipe almost exactly, with the exception of cutting the servings to 8 and not using the meatloaf seasoning packet but, instead, using onion powder, garlic salt, garlic powder, salt, pepper, paprika, celery salt and a dash of cayenne red pepper. Which were the ingredients listed on the meatloaf seasoning packet I saw at the store. I used about 1 tsp of each for the half sized recipe I used. I also left out the pistachios due to a nut allergy in the family. I thought the pepper jack cheese was a good addition, along with the black olives, but the spinach seemed odd to me.

This recipe is amazing. I left out the spinich, olives and nuts to keep the household happy. It was amazing. I did a layer of shredded pepperjack in the middle instead of the cubes which worked out really well. I cut the recipe in half and had enough to make two loafs and about 4 meatloaf burgers on the grill. It makes a TON of meat even when cut in half! Can't wait to make this one again.

Best Meatloaf I've ever had! My prep time was closer to an hour, and baking time to 180 deg was nearly two hours for a "6 serving" size.

I am not on a low carb diet, but my son is.  So I tried this when he came home, best meatloaf I have ever had!  Do not leave out the pistachios, even though they are a bit expensive.
Wonderful!

Kid tested and family approved.  I have the pickiest eaters in my family and everyone likes something different. This was a hit with everyone!  I used almonds instead of pistachios because it was what I had on hand and it turned out fine.  I also chopped the spinach and olives finely so I could hid them from the kids. Great flavor and was easy to prepare.

I haven't tried this yet, but it really looks delicious so it will be the next meat loaf I make. I saw many comments about how big it was and scaling it down, etc. Thought I'd mention that when I make my meatloaf, although I don't usually use 11 pounds of meat, I do mix up a hearty amount and I bake a portion that is good for dinner and an extra few sandwiches, then I put the rest, proportionately, into ziplock freezer bags and freeze them. It makes an easy meal later. You just have to thaw it in the fridge and put it into a loaf pan to bake.

This is a delicious recipe! Even with the pistachios, which I will say, I was very skeptical. We are not meatloaf eaters. Honestly, can't remember when I made one, before this recipe. Everyone loved it and has requested it many times since. The only thing I did differently was not use "meatloaf seasoning." I looked to see what spices were in it and added them individually, so as not to have the preservatives.
