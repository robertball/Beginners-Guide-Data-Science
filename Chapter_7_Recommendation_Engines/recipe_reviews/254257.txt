I made this yesterday for my daughter & I to enjoy at our Labor Day barbecue.  One thing I can say, from experience, is that you need a powerful blender, (I burned up my 2 yr. old Blendtec),  as this is thicker than a milkshake, as written, so I added about another 1/2 cup of schnapps.  You also have to pour the champagne in stages and stir in between, (because of the carbonation).  I will definitely make this again, just have to break it up into 2 or 3 batches.
