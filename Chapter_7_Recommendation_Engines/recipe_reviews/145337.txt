My kids thought these were great! I used my own homemade strawberry freezer jam. They came home at school and told me everyone wanted to have a bite of their "peanut butter and jelly burritos". I'll use this again. GREAT bento lunch addition.

This is not a bad little dish for kids.  I like to make them and pack them in my sonâ€™s lunch on occasion so he is not eating the same thing at school every day.  I would recommend these.  You can try a few different types of preserves.  Next time I think I will use raspberry preserves to try something a little different.

My five year old enjoyed making these with me. I will refrigerate longer next time before cutting. The flavor was great!

I made these for a kids' party and ended up not serving them because they seemed a little off.  I think if I were to make them again, I would use sliced strawberries or something - just too gooey and sweet (and I used low sugar pb and j) and the cheese and peanut butter just didn't quite go.

My daughter loves these in her lunch.  I add fresh fruit to make them more nutritious. She loves to make them herself too.

My kids loved this!! Especially my picky 4-year-old. Didn't have tortillas so just put ingredients between two slices of bread and cut into little squares for a snack.

These were good. I took them to a pool party and the kids (and moms) gobbled them up.

I mixed the cream cheese and peanut butter instead, spread on some preserves (not a ton) and added fresh strawberries.  I have made this often (without the peanut butter) for school lunches or car trips, and the peanut butter addition was a nice twist.
