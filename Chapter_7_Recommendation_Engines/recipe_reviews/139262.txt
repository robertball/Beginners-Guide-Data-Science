Very good. I am a Palestinian and we cook this all the time. I double the Cumin. and get rid of the cayenne pepper and use regular pepper. Also no need to puree, if you leave the soup on low heat for 15 to 20 minutes the lintels will dissolve completely. I add the onions last because I like the crunch.

This soup is delicious. I did alter it a little. If you saute onions, garlic, celery and carrots and add them at the end, it makes it that much better. Then I let it simmer a while longer until the vegetables were soft. Loved it.

I really like this recipe..and after I "Owned" it, I liked it evern more!! First of all, not everyone can deal with spicy..no worries about eliminating the Cayenne Pepper, lemon pepper is so much better! I also absolutely love the texture of the lentils in this soup, so blending them and ommitting the reason this soup is so good feels wrong, I instead sauteed the onions with carrots and garlice, and pureed them and added them to the soup. I also browned some chicken breast bits and threw them in as well. Doubled the cumin and omitted the cilantro. Great recipe!!!

This soup is fantastic.  It tastes just like what I enjoy from our local Mid-Eastern restaurant.  I highly recommend using lemon juice or a wedge of lemon for a garnish.  

My personal preference is to serve the soup with a little long-grain rice like Basmati or Jasmine, fresh cilantro and a dollop of plain yogurt.

I have been looking for a traditional middle-eastern lentil soup for ages, and this one is PERFECT!  

I substituted veggie broth for the chicken broth to make the recipe vegetarian.  2 cups of red lentils worked well for me with 6 cups of broth.

I think the reviews are a little overrated, since I felt the lemon was quite overpowering.  The soup is very different before and after the lemon is added.  One should add it gradually, to taste, I think.

This soup is super quick and easy. We usually serve this with hot naan and sometimes over basmati rice. It's delicious!

I loved this recipe. I cut the portions in half for a single persons portion. I minced the onion and garlic very small and added them to cook for about 15-20 minutes longer. Because I cooked the lentils longer and stirred frequently, I chose not to blend and get more texture. I used store bought lemon juice and only used about half of what the recipe called for. No time for fresh cilantro, so I added coriander for the minty flavor and it was perfect.

Delicious. I used brown lentils (that was all I had).  Cooked as directed, did not puree/blend at the end.  So lemony and fresh tasting!  Would be wonderful with chicken in it, but is great on its own.

This is good! I basically used whatever I had, which meant I added cauliflower and carrots to the sauteed veg.  I also only had canned lentils, and no cilantro, but it still turned out yummy! I also had to use lime juice instead of lemon and veggie stock instead of chicken, but this versatile recipe handled it all great! 

Thanks!

This has been a favorite in our family for some time - we dont use cilantro we use middle eastern mixed spices, garlic, pepper and lemon.  for added flavor you can add some carrots and potatoes to the soup and blend right along with the lentils.
Everyone from Grandma - right down to my kids love this soup!

Had wanted to replicate a Lebanese Lentil soup from a nearby restaurant. This is even better! I didn't use the cayenne, used vegetable stock instead of chicken (as we're vegetarians) and used parsley instead of cilantro.  DELISH! The lemon juice and cumin MAKE IT!!

I cooked up the onion and some red peppers in some olive oil and once everything was cooked I pureed it all.  Next time I'll add more stock as it came out too thick.

My Lebanese family makes this as well, only, vegetarian style.  No chicken broth.  I do saute garlic, onions, celery and carrots. And the key ingredient for us is swiss chard and potato diced added at the near end.  The last ingredients to add are cilantro and lemon juice.  YUM

Oh my goodness was this good. My Egyptian husband says that this is a dish the Orthodox Christians eat during fasting season. He said it was better than his mother's. Followed the recipe to a t--but next time will add more lemon. The pepper was so mild I fed it to the 2 year old.

I really liked this.  I dry-roasted the spices in a pan before adding them, just to release a bit more flavour.  Also, I'd add the lemon juice to taste, as the lemons we get here in my neck of the woods are very acidic/bitter -  I'd go gradually!  Wonderful recipe, thanks!

Perfect! I replaced the cayenne with fresh ground black pepper so it wouldn't be too spicy and added 3/4 teaspoon salt, but otherwise I kept everything else the same. It was thick but not too thick and had delicious flavor. The cilantro and lemon juice really add the perfect final touch!

UPDATE:  Made this again and made some more changes.  First, I used 8 cups of homemade Vegetable Broth (Worlds Greatest Vegetable Broth listed on this site).  Then I added 1 carrot (cooked the SWEET onion until translucent, then added the garlic and finely diced carrot).  I upped the cumin to 2 tablespoons and added just a little less than a 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper and 3/4 teaspoon turmeric to the mix.  Did NOT add the white pepper this time around (good call on my part).  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of salt because I didn't salt my broth.  I added about 3/4 cup lemon juice (freshly juiced), but continued to added more to my bowl separately.  My husband said I NAILED it.  He loved the added heat and said it was perfect.  Thank you for such a great base recipe that allows changes easily.  While it is not exactly like the soup we get at our local Lebanese restaurant, he LOVED it.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Great base recipe.  Had to make some changes.  First, I used vegetable broth (going vegan) in place of the chicken broth.  After simmering for 20 minutes, I noticed the soup was way too thick so I added the rest of my broth (I used a total of 64 oz. of broth) and it was still very thick so I added some water (maybe 2 more cups).  PERFECT!  I let it simmer some more while I finished the rest of the prep.  We felt it was a little bland so we added a lot more cumin - sorry, didn't measure, just kept adding until we liked it.  Left out the cayenne pepper and used white pepper instead.

Delish!  I used Split red lentils - so they cooked a little faster.  Also, did everything right in the stock pot.  Sauteed onion, garlic, 2 carrots and 2 celery stalks in olive oil.  Then added stock (used 2 boxes = 8 cups) and then added rinsed lentils.  cooked everything until tender.  Then, did a quick whir with the immersion blender.  Added less lemon juice.  Fast, easy, inexpensive and healthy.  A winner!  PS: Could also be served over rice.

This was a big hit in our house. Reminded us alot of split pea soup with a slight kick. It has a creamy smooth consistancy and pairs well as side dish to a baked potato, sweet potato or even a ham sandwich.

Easy and good.  Added a couple sticks of celery too, and had folks add their own lemon and cilantro.  A keeper and healthy too.

Wow - surprisingly good -- like split pea but lighter and no need for the ham fat.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly -- I cooked the lentils in chicken broth -- I think a 30 minute simmer is too long -- then sauteed onion, carrot & celery in plenty of olive oil.  Added the cumin (twice as much), some salt & pepper to the mix, then lastly added the garlic to saute.  Threw all of that in the lentils and added lemon juice from a jar.  Yummy!

I saw no reason to cook the onions and garlic separate...I sautéed them first and added the spices, broth and lentils.  I used about 1/3 c lemon juice at the end and a liberal amount of cilantro.  This soup is excellent.  It Is also attractive and I would not hesitate to serve this to company.  Thanks, JENP1.

This was really delicious up until I added the lemon juice, it was way too much for me and drowned out all of the other flavors. Doubling the cumin helped. Next time I would only put a tiny bit of lemon, otherwise it was really delicious and healthy.

This was good and spicy.  I added 1 cup of chopped celery and 1 cup of chopped carrots and sauteed them with the onions in 3 Tbl. of butter instead of olive oil.  I added the garlic when the onions were translucent.  I was nervous about adding the full amount of lemon because others had said it was too strong.  So I only did 1/3 cup of lemon.  I couldn't taste the lemon at all so I will do 3/4 cup next time.  I'm glad I added the celery and carrot.  I think the soup would have been a little boring otherwise.  It was pretty spicy for my kids, but they still enjoyed it.  I did add a little sour cream to tone it down a bit and that tasted good as well.  We aren't cilantro fans so we didn't add any.  I will definitely make it again, but I will probably add a little less liquid next time.  I think I'd like it better more as a chili and less of a soup.  It was pretty thick as written, but I'd like it even a little more so.  Yum!  good recipe.

After reading everyone's reviews, I realized just how versatile & forgiving this recipe is...use what you have & don't worry about what you don't!  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken stock.  Added some sliced carrots and celery as I sauteed the onion and garlic (if you get a bit of browning on the veggies it brings out more flavor).

I reduced the cumin to less than half of what's called for, and added dried thyme & ground coriander (sorry, I didn't measure...just a good shake into the palm of my hand).  Fresh tomatoes cut into chunks & added at the finish are wonderful...along with a bit of coarse sea salt.

Sadly, the cilantro I had on hand wasn't the freshest, so I decided not to use it...also left out the lemon juice...but will try both next time.

This has just enough heat to not be overwhelming; this comes from someone who doesn't like hot, spicy food...in fact my husband was surprised that I was enjoying it, since the heat was just right for him :)

Thanks for this recipe...it's found a permanent home in my recipe box.

I love this recipe.  I throw diced hot peppers (chiles) in to saute with onions and garlic (instead of adding cayenne pepper later on).  I also double the cumin and don't use the lemon juice.

This delicious soup is ridiculously easy; I did not bother blending it, and we enjoyed the texture. I did not use cilantro, and it did not lack anything. I did add a tiny bit of coriander as suggested by another reviewer, to make up for the lack of cilantro. So easy, so delicious!

Great recipe. Really yummy, and pretty easy, especially if you skip the blender, which is unnecessary.

Next time I will try a little less lemon juice.

Really good and easy!   Followed recipe almost exactly, just subbed fresh parsley for the cilantro.   I added lemon juice.  I actually tried a taste w no lemon juice, then one with the fake lemon juice (didn't do a thing), then the fresh lemon.   Definitely use fresh lemon!   Yum!

So delicious! I loved the lemon flavor and I think this will be in my regular winter rotation. I added some small star pasta that I had on hand to make it a little more of a complete meal. I think next time I might add some chopped celery and carrot too. I decided not to blend it just due to personal preference. I found that 2 1/2 lemons gave me the juice I needed. Also, 1 lb of lentils was about 2 1/2 C. I did have to add about a quart of water because it got pretty thick as the lentils boiled.

This recipe is easy, delicious, filling and comforting - and so cheap to make! I halved the recipe because I live alone (there are plenty of leftovers for the week). Since I didn't have cayenne on hand, I used black pepper, plus a little ground red pepper for kick. I will definitely be making this again! It's hard not to over eat it :) I think this would be great with carrots, too.

So tasty! I didn't have cilantro, so used about 1 tsp of coriander, and only added a couple tablespoons of lemon juice, as my husband doesn't like lemon flavored things. This is a really easy and delicious recipe. For those who have made this with green lentils, really try to find red ones... they cook quickly and become so creamy. Definitely a recipe to make again and again.

Tastes like Schwarma in a bowl!  Yummy!  I followed this recipe exactly except I added one chicken breast.  It could stand on its own though without the chicken.  Add the lemon!  It sounds strange but it tastes good.

This soup is incredible, smooth (didnt need to mash the lentils) and very tasty. I dont believe in meassuring things (unless ur baking) so I liberally added incredients to my liking. Lots of cumin and cilantro, also used pork bones and half a habanero. The lemon juice is definetly needed, I kept feeling like the soup was missing somethings until I added the lemon juice. It was perfect, one of the best lentil soup I have ever had. thanks for a delightful recipe.

My  husband is Egyptian and a total foodie. He said this soup is better than any soup he's ever had. He prefers it not pureed, but I like the smoothe texture better, so I just puree my serving with my imersion blender. Thanks for sharing such a yummy recipe!

Very good!  I decided not to puree the soup because the texture reminded me of split pea soup, which we like.  If I make it again, though, I think that I would puree it per directions.  The flavor is very lemony, which we liked, but I would caution you to use less if you do not like a strong lemon flavor.

This soup was excellent and very easy to make - this recipe is a keeper!  I also did not need to puree the soup, I just let it cook for an hour or so and time did the work for me.  I mistakenly forgot the lemon juice and it was still wonderful.

This was incredible! Tasted just like the lentil soup served in an Arabic restaurant. I did not have the red lentils on hand so I used regular lentils and added a little turmeric to give it some color. I also halved the recipe with no problems.  The cilantro, cumin, and lemon flavors all compliment each other perfectly in this soup.

I made this with dinner tonight and we liked it a lot. I used just 1/4 tsp cayenne and it was plenty spicy for us (I have a 5 year old daughter), 2 Tb oil, the juice of just one medium lemon, more salt, vegetable base instead of chicken, and 2 chopped carrots. Also some extra cumin: it's hard to get too much of this awesome spice in my household. I did not have any cilantro on hand so I skipped it but it was great anyway. Highly recommended for weekday supper; try with salad and a baked potato. Easy, high fiber, and healthy!

I've made this recipe three times now and it always turns out great.  The cilantro gives a crisp, fresh flavor to offset the heat of the pepper.  Delicious!

This soup is seriously good. I made a few alterations after reading other reviews:

1) I used onion, carrot, garlic and celeriac (I had one lying around) and sauteed this. When it softened I blended it and added to the cooked lentils. I did NOT blend the soup at the end as I wanted some texture from lentils. (note: when cooking lentils for the first 20 mins keep an eye on it as I kept having to add more water to it and stir frequently to stop it from sticking and burning)

2) I used about 1/8 c lemon juice (I made half the recipe) - it's better to add less and then add more when you serve if you think you need it. 

3) I added 1/4 tsp lemon pepper and slightly more cumin as I love cumin. 

4) I served it with a sprinkling of paprika and shredded fresh mint which really adds to the flavour.

This was a delicious and refreshing recipe. I followed Ahmad Ghosheh's advice and forwent the cayenne pepper in favor of black pepper. I was looking for a lentil soup recipe that would mimic my MIL's (she's Egyptian and I LOVE her cooking), and while this didn't taste the same, it was a great alternative soup. Definitely had that delicious middle eastern tangy/savory flavor. Loved it!

This soup is incredibly flavorful, much more so than I expected it to be. The only changes I made were to cook the onions and garlic in a large pot, add the spices to the onions, and then add the lentils and broth to that pot, in order to save the flavors and juices from the onions and garlic. I also threw in half a cup of bulgur to the lentils and broth in order to add a little more protein and fiber. I did not puree the soup. The soup is good with or without the lemon juice. Without the lemon juice, you get more of the cumin flavor. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

What a fantastic recipe! Thank you SO MUCH.
I agree with some posters about the Cayenne pepper though - whilst I like spicy and did eat ALL of it, my Hubby and kids couldn't eat it - too spicy. So next time I might try just a bit of fresh cracked pepper. Otherwise perfect!

I've made this soup many, many times now. I love it. My friends love it.  I made it for a friend who was recovering from heart surgery and he not only loved it, but asked for the recipe and now makes it himself. I usually skip the cayenne pepper, as I'm a cumin fiend!  I also don't puree this soup, as I think the texture is perfect the way it is.

My boys loved it! Followed other suggestions by doubling the cumin and black pepper. Threw a pat of butter into the bowl before adding the soup to make it richer for my kids. Added a sprinkle of ground sumac on top to give it that extra authentic flavor. Great recipe!

Wow this was so simple but so good!  I added the lemon to taste and ended up adding just over 1/4 cup.  I did use the immersion blender but you could certainly get away w/out it if you diced the onion small enough.

very good but excellent for our taste preference with few changes others mentioned.  First we added sauted onion, celery, carrot and quartered grape tomatoes at the end and stirred them in to maintain some crunchy texture.  We also added 1 1/2-2 x cumin and extra hot Hungarian paprika, again our pref for spicy things.  Per others rec to 1/2 the fresh lemon juice and add to taste worked for us and we stopped at 1/4-1/3c.  Thanks for great recipe as with all recipes, they have to be tweaked to everyone's own preferences.

I added a bit of turmeric and included some extra vegetables I had around.  Turned out great, would have been good without the additions as well.

This is very similar to my the soup at my favourite Lebanese restaurant. It's just so comforting. I followed the directions exactly and was very pleased. I want to make some fattoush with this... what an authentically yummy lunch that would be!

this was super easy to make and tasted good too. I too didn't blend all of the soup.  I blended only about half of the soup so there would still be chunks.

I am giving the recipe 5 stars because it is a great basic recipe from which many variations are possible. As written I am sure it is delicious, but I completely went rogue on this one and did my own thing just using the recipe only as a guideline. I wanted something a little heartier so... I browned lean ground turkey in a little oil and added a chopped red onion near the end. Added the spices (3x as much cumin and and equal amount of ground coriander) after the onion got soft. Deglazed with some vermouth and reduced. Added the garlic and heated that through. I subbed black pepper for the cayenne and added a finely chopped potato and some chopped celery leaves. My red lentils were pre-split so they cooked quickly in the chicken stock, but I also added a 15 oz can of tomato puree and a can of petite diced tomatoes with onions and all the juice from it.  I squeezed 1/3 of a lemon into the pot and wedged the rest of it and served it, the cilantro and some finely chopped fresh cherry tomatoes on the side. It turned out beautifully and was very filling.

we used Green/Brown lentils from the pantry, which seemed to hold their shape more and gave the soup a more chewy texture. It was more like a dhaal than a soup, but either way, I love it!

Flavor was not all I hoped it would be. I added a lot more of each spice, and it still did not taste like the lentil soup I ate in the middle east.

This was a great recipe and super easy! My whole family loved it..especially with the Cumin for taste. I had red lentils in my cupboard for months and now I had to go buy more because they wanted me to make it again! No need to change anything.

I had a bag of red lentil in the house and wanted to use them. I stumbled upon this recipe and gave it a shot. Although I didn't have lemon juice nor cilantro and replaced the onion with green onion, it tasted wonderful. Also my lentils were tender after 18min.

This soup is delicious. My only comment is while it's fine to garnish it with lemon wedges, I would not squeeze those lemon wedges into the soup, as it is overkill. We added all the cumin and extra cayenne because we love spicy food. We're going to be eating this a lot. Thank you JENP1!

very good! I did not puree but let it cook a little bit longer and the lentils were mushy enough. I also did not add all the lemon juice based on other reviews.

Since this was last reviewed in '08 I thought I would just add a note that this recipe still holds up in 2011.  I had only a handful of red lentils, so I made a very small batch and estimated the seasonings.  Delicious.  I didn't get the color shown in the picture but the flavor was terrific.  So quick too.

great recipe on its own but also open for modification. I made with diced carrots with red onions (will try white onions next time for softer flavour), scallions towards the end and extra cracked pepper! so delicious and soothing on a cold day!  EDIT: I tried green lentils yesterday but had trouble getting them to the pulpy/melting consistency of the red lentils. Stirred in some canned corn, ground coriander and fresh coriander to garnish. delicious!

This soup is divine! I made it vegan by using veggie stock instead of chicken. My red lentil fell apart in the pot, so their was no need to blend anything in the end. I did have to add more water to keep the lentil from clumping up, and to make it more soupy. I had no cilantro, so I added a dash of coriander instead. This soup is very flavorful and nutritious. Love!

I needed to add extra chicken stock as this dried up pretty fast while simmering...the ratio was closer to 1 cup lentils to 4 cups broth. I added the cumin to cook with the onion/garlic to get it in a bit earlier and also left out the cayenne and cilantro. Great soup and will make again!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I loved the flavor components and the texture of this soup.  It is also a really easy dish to make.  I doubled on the cumin, cayenne pepper and fresh cilantro, and I added a bit of curry paste to it.  Definitely will make again!

This soup is great! It has a wonderful flavor and texture. I used vegetable stock and a lot less lemon juice (around 1/4 cup.) I decided not to blend it because I liked the texture the way it was when I took it off the stove. I'm sure it tastes just as good blended.

Thank you, Thank you!!! I lived in the middle east for a little while and there was this Lebanese resturant that we used to go to and this taste exactly like their lentil soup. I have been searching for this seems like forever. I am in heaven. Thanks again!!

i really liked this. the lemon was wonderful.  as others recommended i added celery and carrots, doubled the spices, subbed coriander for cilantro (didnt have any), and added 2 more cups of broth. these small changes resulted in a very flavorful soup. i may try this in a crock pot next time

My husband and I love the lentil soup at various middle eastern restaurants in our neighborhood, so I've been looking for a recipe to make something similiar.  This was perfect!  I did make a few small adjustments though.  I used a little more chicken stock (8 cups), a little less lemon juice (1/4 cup), swapped out tumeric for the cayenne pepper and served with lemon wedges.  Absolutely delicious!

I love this soup! I followed the directions exactly, except I only added 1/2 C lemon juice, instead of 3/4 C. The peppery flavor with the lemon is fantastic! It's a great cold-weather soup.

Wow!!! Talk about comfort food.  This is right up there with mashed potatoes, Texas Chili and Black Beans and Rice.  It was smooth and creamy, spicy, and (yea) healthy.  I look for foods for my family that meet 4 criteria: tastes good, good for you, easy to make and cheep.  This is a keeper!!

Delicious!  This will be one of my go-to soup recipes now.  I did have a hard time finding the red lentils (had to go to an ethnic store since they were not available in my chain grocery store) - but it was well worth it.  Thanks for a delicious, easy recipe.

I made this soup at the coffee house and everyone loved it, it sold out! I did make some changes. I added 4 chopped carrots,it added some sweetnes and 2 cups of hummus for thickness and more flavor. this has become a regular on the menu.

Growing up in Lebanon, and tasting many different kinds of lentil soups I would say that this one is my new favorite! I did not alter this recipe except for adding a bit of chili powder & flakes since my husband and I like our soups spicy! Thank you for the great recipe, will make now all the time!

AWESOME!! I adjusted to 6 servings, added a tsp of salt, used regular pepper instead of cayenne, and added in a couple shakes of turmeric. I also added the cilantro at the beginning and let it cook the whole time. Its very easy and super yummy, my husband loved it!

Tasty, easy, kept well in fridge but did need a little water added the next day.  Didn't change a thing in the recipe and likely wouldn't.  Served with naan bread; complimented it nicely.

This is pretty close to how I make mine, though I skip the garlic, and add finely diced carrots, celery, zucchini, and a little tomato paste ... I also use ample salt, turmeric, and cumin (Cayenne pepper does not seem like a great fit to me) ... lastly, I don't bother with a mixer, just dice your vegetables right, and the texture is just fine ...   This is very robust, healthy food, and goes with almost anything .... Even my hard-to-please children love this one.

Very good. Doesn't really need blending. I had to seriously scale back the recipe as I cook only for myself. I used the tool on this site to re-calculate but the lemon taste was strong so next time I will use less. But I will be making this again.

KILLER SOUP!!!!  I love this.  It is completely simple to make and the taste is amazing.  A tiny bit too hot for my heat wimpy hubby but that is easy to fix for next time.  My only change was to add about 4 stalks of celery to the onion and garlic sautee.   Love this ~ Thank you!!!!!

My entire family loved it. I followed the advice of others and added carrots an browned chicken. Was a terrific meal. I would add more liquid in the future and will not puree. I put it in the blender and I think a hand blender would have been a wiser choice.  My husband said this has been his favorite recipe I have tried so far!

Yum! Loved it! Spicy and filling. I didn't add the cumin, since I don't care for the taste of it--added a little turmeric instead. Will be making this again!
EDIT-So I made this again today and this time I broke down and added cumin (1/4 tsp)--made it taste even more excellent! I LOVE this soup.

Even after making this a no-fuss soup, it is still very good. I had to add about 3 cups water to keep it from drying out. I also used beef broth since I didn't have chicken. It still tastes very good, but chicken would be better. I also used dehydrated onion, minced garlic from the store, dehydrated cilantro and lemon juice. These all worked well and I didn't have to wait until I could get to the store! I also messed up and put the cilantro in with the other ingredients. If this soup can still be this good, imagine what it would be like if I made it right!!

I love this soup so I'm giving it five stars even though I had a few problems with it.  I had trouble getting 3/4 cup of lemon juice from two whole lemons so suggest using part fresh squeezed and the rest from a bottle.  My soup didn't come out very yellow (red lentils are yellow) and I wonder if I didn't blend it well enough.  I liked it a bit "chunky", as did my boyfriend, but the color was a bit difficult to swallow!  I had red lentil soup at a restaurant once and it was spectacular.  I think this recipe could be too!

Loved it!  My riffs on the recipe:   Add 1tblsp sweet curry to oil w garlic. Then add finely chopped cilantro leaves, shallots, mushroom, onion, celery and carrot to sautée.  Put all into boiling lentils. Lentils will soften after 20 min or so. Add juice of 1/2 lemon to soupHand blend some - not all.  Leave some pieces of veggies. Garnish w cilantro leaves

Delicious soup. I wound up having to sub in shallot and harissa for the white onion and cumin because I ran out of both without realizing it but the soup still came out amazingly well.

This soup is ridiculously good!! I did sauté diced carrots with the onion and garlic. Did not have fresh lemon or cilantro, so instead I put in a hefty amount of lemon pepper seasoning, ground coriander, and some smoked paprika, leaving out the salt, cayenne pepper, ground black pepper, fresh cilantro, and lemon juice. So basically subbing what I did have to mimic the original of those particular ingredients, while trying to stick as closely to the recipe as I could! And I ate so much of it I was almost miserable, that’s how delicious it was!! Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!

Most of my changes were because I'm too lazy to go shopping. Also, if it helps, I'm not normally one for spicy. I find that the additions I made resulted in a soup that was warmly spiced but not HOT.

I doubled the amount of cumin, plus a little bit more, added a little water, and used one cup of veggie broth because I didn't have enough chicken. I also used waaaaay more garlic than the recipe calls for. Also I added some chili powder. I juiced 3/4 of a lemon because that's what I had without going to the store. This  is AMAZING. It feels like a warm hug to your stomach. I will be making this in this way for a long long time.

I loved it. Its simple, yet flavoursome. I decreased the lemon juice to my own taste. I can see this to be firm favourite in my home.

This soup is very easy to make and turned out pretty good. I used a slow cooker so I didn’t need an immersion blender. I added carrots and a little curry powder. I served with lemon wedges so everyone could add lemon juice to taste. Thanks for the recipe:)

I made it according to the recipe, and the lemon juice overpowered everything else. I used bottled juice because I didn't have fresh lemons, so perhaps that was where I went wrong. It tasted amazing before I put the lemon juice in, so I really regret that I didn't just skip it. I would warn you to add the lemon juice to taste! Also, it needed more liquid than called for, but that could be because I live in a dry climate.

This is delicious... After living in Lebanon for years with all the wonderful cuisine, I was hungry for this soup.  I added more cumin to the recipe and cooked lentils with Maggi Cubes to get the full flavor. Made huge pot and it was gone before I could have a second bowl. I will make again and again.

Delicious! The proportions in the recipe would make way more than I wanted, so I cut them down at random rates.  I would be careful of how much you want to make in relation to what the recipe asks, and coordinately scale it down, rather than just guessing. Mine was a bit too dry.

Excellent soup.  I made it vegan by using a vegetarian broth, and added 2 sliced carrots to the onions and garlic when sauteeing.  Blended it to a very smooth puree.

I changed the spices to 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 1/8 tsp garam marsala, salt & pepper. I added 3 grated carrots. I also only pureed 3/4 of the soup and added it back in. Best lentil soup I have ever had!

I used a vegetable broth mix with water to make it vegan. I also didn't add the lemon or cilantro to it because I not that crazy for either. Instead I added some cheese, which I wouldn't do again. 
The soup really does need the sour flavor to compete it. To do that  I think I'll try some yogurt or sour cream as a garnish.

Is this ever delicious! I rough chopped the onions and garlic and some carrots and sauteed them, then added to the soup at the end.  Did everything else according to the recipe, except I used low sodium chicken broth. The soup is surprisingly savory and rich tasting.

This recipe is delicious, simple, and fast. I did not make this exactly as written, but I think this is so wonderfully simple that you can adjust easily to taste. I did not have any cilantro, so I added spinach instead. I omitted the cayenne and opted for black pepper. I added the lemon juice 1/4 of a cup at a time, and stopped at 1/2 a cup. I did not bother blending as the lentils had cooked down enough for me. I will be making this more often.

This is the best soup ever and is super easy to make! I do add carrot and celery with the onion and I omit the cilantro because I personally dislike cilantro. Otherwise, I follow this recipe exactly as written and it comes out great every time!

Great Recipe. Here is what I added: increased the cumin by 0.5 TBSP, added a teaspoon of tomato paste, teaspoon of Moroccan spice, half a  teaspoon of tumeric, teaspoon of dried mint. I also added 1 carrot diced and 1 celery diced, as well as 2 cloves of garlic. I sautéed all of the vegetables with the onion, then added it half way through. I pureed half of the soup, and left the other half as is to give some texture.

This a great soup - very flavorful, tasty and fast! I have cooked it for a few years now and never get tired of it. I only omit the pepper because my kids don't like spicy. I double the cumin as others have recommended and never blend the soup. The lemon and the cumin make this soup, I make sure to use both of them as fresh as I can. It also freezes well for those nights when you need to feed little ones quickly!

Oh boy this is good and EASY! I used brown lentils instead of red (don't think it really matters) and I increased the cumin and the lemon juice during pureeing until I was happy with the flavour - no real science behind it.  Also added extra broth because after pureeing I found the soup to be too thick.  Instead of cayenne I used home-made chili powder that I made from chilis I grew in my garden.  We don't use cilantro in my household so I substituted with parsley, which in my opinion is more traditionally middle eastern.  Sounds like I deviated a lot but really I didn't, just tweaked here and there to my liking.  Will definitely make again.

I love lentil soup. But not this one.  The lemon juice is overpowering, and I don't care for the cumin in this soup.  I will not make this again, but stick with the excellent Greek Lentil Soup recipe that I found on this website.

I didnt do a pound of lentils (just enough for me) and I used a pressure cooker and added some chicken sausage and left out the cayenne (and forgot the lemon) and used fenugreek leaves instead.

It was more like a chicken dal and super delish!

Is quick and easy but I'd omit the cayenne next time. It makes the soup the wrong color, too brownish rather than yellowish.  I also put it into the Vitamix and it became too smooth. I like to see some texture of the lentils.

Thank you! I've been looking for a recipe like my Syrian family makes and this is exactly what I have been looking for! I also throw in a small handful of rice along with the lentils if I'm having it as dinner instead of an appetizer.

L-O-V--E. This was fast, easy, and delicious. I have to admit, I used bottled lemon juice since I didn't have fresh, but I can only imagine it would be even better with fresh! As a note, 1 lb of lentils equals about 2 1/4 cups.

Just made this soup! I added grates carrots and doubled the cumin. Used one pot first to sauté the veggies then set the in a plate to cook the lentils. I used the cayenne because...we like spicey. I used my submersion blender but only buzzed my soup a little to keep some texture.

Exact same soup I grew up with and wow! I had missed this soup so much. This is tasty stuff. My only suggestion is don't add all the lemon juice at once. Add some and taste. I use a lot less lemon juice but this may be personal taste. Thanks JENP1

I agree with Amahad about the cayenne and cumin. But I use fresh tomatoes while simmering and do purée. My ex Mother-in-law is Egyptian and she taught me her way. She sauté some tiny noodles in butter and adds after it purée 's just to soften.

I was looking for an authentic Lebanese Lentil soup, this is an excellent recipe.  I did find that there was too much Cumin and Lemon so I scaled the Cumin down to 1 1/2 tsp and the lemon to 1/3 cup and it is now perfect for my taste. Tip:  don’t let it simmer for more than 20 minutes or it will be too thick.  It is great on a cold winter Canadian day!

Very good soup and easy to make. Instead of chicken stock I created my own stock with Edward&Sons "Not-Chick'n" bouillon cubes.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was great. The lemon was a bit overpowering, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.  Next time I make it I plan to cut that back quite a bit.

Red lentil soup is awesome.  If you haven't had it, try it.  Omit the cayenne though.  You might want to add a bit more cumin.  I also omitted cilantro (imo, it tastes like soap).  I used vegetable broth in order to make this vegetarian.  Also, if you cook this a little longer, pureeing the soup is unnecessary -- red lentils will quickly dissolve on their own with no assistance.

Great flavor; halved the recipe; found it a bit too thick; will add more liquid next time.
Second time I made it:  Made fresh veggie stock; 1 c lentils, 1 TBSP cumin, no cayenne, baby spinach, TBSP lemon juice (bottled) - not 3/4c and Matouk's hot sauce (1/8 tsp) at end after pureeing

Well done as a base starter. As per suggested, I doubled+ the cumin to get it closer to the Lentil soup that I'm served at a local Indian restaurant as that is what first hooked me! I also used vegetable broth as that is what I had in stock. I did saute 2 celery stalks and 2 carrots with the onion and put 4 cloves of garlic- I can never have too much garlic. I let simmer for about 30 minutes, then added the sauteed vegetables and let simmer for another 45minutes to an hour, until the carrots were completely soft. I used the immersion blender to puree and wow. Wonderful. I add cilantro/lemon squirt only when served and not in the entire soup.

Very good soup! While the lentils simmered, I dry-toasted the spices (double cumin + crushed coriander and smoky chipotle paprika), then added the oil, onion, and garlic. When the lentils were nearly soft (20 mins?), I added cubed carrot and sweet potato for about 15 mins, then leftover chicken at the end, and served over couscous. Next time, I'd add a dried dundicut pepper to the simmer time to add a bit of overall heat and flavor. Also needed salt and pepper.

The recipe was a great starting point for me to build upon,  My daughter is a vegetarian so I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth, and I added cubed potatoes, diced carrots and threw in a can of pinto beans.  Awesome, hearty soup!

SOOOO GOOD!!!  I used brown lentils (that is what I had) and I just added the onion and garlic after 20 min instead of cooking them. I didn't blend because I like the texture of the whole lentils.  Will definitely be making this regularly!

Cut out the pepper and doubled the cumin. Added the onion/garlic at the end. Had to add waaay more broth to make it more like a soup than dal (indian curry).

This satisfying dish is a favorite 'go-to' when I'm not feeling motivated to cook.  I sub veg. broth for chicken, leave out the cilantro, and often add carrots (and rarely do I blend it).

I have been making this, both as-is and with modifications, for years. I love love love it! Especially now as autumn air gets brisk and the wind howls...it's so nice to have a thick,  warm, spicy, and comforting soup for a meal. Like others, I don't bother pureeing the soup, I greatly increase the spices, and use as much cilantro as I please (which is a lot). The last time I made it, I added 1/4 cup of cooked coarse brown bulghur in the last few minutes (for four servings of soup). Delicious!!!

I didn't puree, just kept it simmering for a while. Also added carrot and 2 stalks of celery. I loved it. Husband said it was good. 2 year old did not like. Too sandy tasting for her, perhaps?

Tasty and healthy! I made a few modifications to taste...Added an additional cup of stock because I cooked the lentils for longer time on a low simmer. Also added 2 stalks chopped celery and 2 chopped carrots to the stock/lentils for additional veggies and flavor. Upon tasting, I added 1T thyme, 1T oregano, and about 2T of vinegar for some bite. Family inhaled it with crusty bread and we had enough left over to freeze for a cold fall day.

I followed the recipe to a "T" and I found that the soup was way too thick, almost a pastey texture.  When I served it I had to dilute it with alot of water.  Other than that the taste was okay.  I won't be making this again as I have better lentil soup recipes in my repertoire.

Love the soup, reminds me of Dahl (Indian cuisine). I added 1 Jalapeno pepper as I like a little heat, 1/2 red pepper, 4 carrots and mixed in curry as well as cumin. I used 4 cups (2 cans) of broth and 2C of water in place of the 6C. Also used 2T of olive oil instead of 3T. Great recipe-- very adaptable. Thanks!

I debated between 3 stars and 4 stars because as is, it overwhelmed my taste buds a bit.  Ultimately I chose 4 because I think I can easily make it into a truly enjoyable recipe.  I made the recipe pretty much as stated, except the store here only carries the standard brown lentils.  I also followed the advice of increasing the cumin, used 1 1/2 tbsp rather than 1.  When I ate it, all I could really taste was the lemon.  I could tell there were other flavors there, but the lemon was very over-powering (and I do like lemon).  It's a very strongly flavored soup and needs something to cut it.  One reviewer suggested serving it with a long grain rice (e.g. basmati), and I think I will try that tomorrow night.  In future, I may do 2 tbsp of cumin and will definitely add only 1/2 cup of lemon juice and taste it before adding more.

I liked this a lot.  I'm  not sure if I made the recipe exactly, because I made a smaller portion, and didn't carefully measure everything, but it came out great regardless!  The only things I know I changed are that I didn't use cayenne pepper, I just used a little bit of black pepper, and I omitted the cilantro because I hate it.

Yummy, healthy soup.  Took others suggestions and sauteed and puree the onion, garlic, celery and carrot before added to the cooked lentils. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent soup! tastes just like the one my mom makes(she is egyptian). I did double the cumin and garlic and used vegetable broth (for lent).  I also used the lemon pepper instead of the cayenne(making for 2 kids under 5).  It did need some salt and ground fresh black pepper.

I love this soup! It has such a delicious ethnic flavor, but not too overwhelming for people that generally eat plain dishes. I love the thicker consistency it has after blended, what a great idea! The only thing I added was cubed chicken to make it just a tad heartier and it was absolutely perfect!

This soup was flavorful and delicious and so easy to make! I was able to make it with items we had around the kitchen.   Following other reviewers I added 2x the amount of cumin and added some coriander. Also I added extra cayenne to make it spicy. Did not puree the soup and added parsley instead of cilantro since I had some.  To make it vegetarian I used vegetable stock instead of the chicken broth.   Will definitely make this again!

it tasted pretty good, but it was a little thick. i would make it thinner and soupier. it was more like hummus texture. it could be my skills that did it, but i followed the recipe to the letter. ended up putting water in it to thin it, but overall ok

Perfect! I'm so happy I found this. I've been looking for a recipe for a soup I had at a restaurant, and this is it! I doubled the garlic, cumin and cayenne pepper, because I love spicy things. I used dried cilantro instead of fresh, 'cause it's what I had. Also, I have no lemons, so I skipped the juice, although I KNOW it's a must. Still great without it, but it will be even better with it. My three year old is gobbling it up! Thanks so much JENP1!

This filling soup with a bright and spicy flavor is about to become a staple in our home. Those who don't prefer spicy should adjust the cayenne pepper accordingly or skip it altogether. This soup could easily be made vegan as well, simply by using vegetable stock instead.

This soup definitely merits 5 stars for flavor, ease of preparation, nutritiousness and bonus points for inexpensive!  The combination of the red lentils, cumin, cilantro and lemon are fresh and earthy at the same time.  I would say all the ingredients are key to the success of this soup.  I used vegetable stock instead of chicken and only used the juice from half a juicy lemon. I did not bother blending it at the end and I really enjoyed the thick texture.  Great comfort food!  Ate with a buttered whole-wheat baguette and it was hearty and very satisfying.  I will definitely be making this soup again Thanks for a great tasting and easy recipe!

Surprisingly delicious! And I say surprisingly because that first taste blows you away! Tastes nothing like I thought it would from the smell and look. Like others have mentioned, go easy on the lemon juice. Maybe even 1/2 cup is too much. The cumin is a must. Do not leave it out or substitute it. It is very filling, so if you're dishing up a bowl the size pictured, that's going to be your main course.

Yum!  The first time I made this, I squeezed fresh lemons and the full 3/4 cup was too tart after I added the cilantro so I just use 1/2 cup.  For bottled juice, I use what the recipe calls for.  I hate cleaning the blender so I use an old hand-cranked egg beater in the pan-- I like the lentils less pureed so this works fine.  Chicken or clear vegetable broth works good as a substitute when I don't have any stock on hand but stock tastes better.

YUMMY! As a veggie, I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth. I also listened to other reviewers and replaced black pepper for the cayenne. Top this soup with some feta... SO GOOD!!! :)

This soup has loads of flavor... but... a little TOO much flavor for us. I would definitely make this again, minus so much lemon. The first couple bites tasted really good. But the more we ate it, the less we liked it. I would definitely recommend to go easy on the spices!

This was great! My boyfriend doesn't like it too thick, so we added extra water and it was perfect. I was suggested to add a cup of rice for texture so i'm going to give that a go next time.

I pureed the onions and garlic like another reviewer recommended.  The texture is great- the spice combo is great (though I'll probably double it next time, as my honey & I love spicy!)  This is going straight to the recipe box!

This soup is awesome.  It tastes great and it's healthy.  I've been looking for more recipes to incorporate healthy ingredients and this fits the bill. I ran out of cumin and added 2 carrots, and it tasted delicious. Thanks for a yummy recipe Jenp1.

Very yummy! I sauteed the onion with a carrot first. The soup did get too thick for my liking, but I just added a bit of hot water to thin it out. I served this with Authentic Lebanese Fattoush from this site.

We made this for dinner tonight, I sauted the onion and garlic along with a cubed carrot and added to the lentils just before serving. I let it cook until the lentils dissolved instead of blending it. Used only about 1/2 cup lemon juice and added cubed marinated chicken breast. It was quite good. Healthy and filling and easy. We will make it again. Thanks!

Love It! I was looking for something to serve over rice and this looked like it might work. Another reviewer mentioned that he/she did that and so I went for it. I am cooking for one so I downsized recipe and made some reviewer suggested modifications: 2 15 oz. cans 33%less Na Chicken Broth 1 cup split red lentils (that's all supermarket had) several baby carrots chopped and thrown with above to cook as recipe indicates. For onions I used probably half a med/large onion (eyeball it) sauteed and then near end sauteed 1 large and 1 smaller size garlic clove shredded small. This thrown in with above as per recipe and then added a little more than 1/2T cumin and 1/4 tsp cayenne.   Boiled a bit longer than indicated bc I didn't plan on blending and threw in some dried cilantro (didn't have fresh on hand) and some bottled lemon juice (several squirts.)  Served this over basmati rice.  This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I made this last night exactly as the recipe says, minus the cilantro because I didn't have any. Everyone agreed that it was delicious! The cumin and cayenne added just the right "kick", and the lemon juice gave it the right "lebanese" feel.

I add a large can of diced tomatoes - juice and all - and it is fabulous. The soup also works with brown lentils, but you have to cook it for 1 1/2 hours or longer to soften the lentils.

very good; the lemon gives it a lot of zip, have tums on hand for the after burn. i added chopped ham left over from Thanksgiving, and it was great.

Great recipe.  I made some modifications:  I doubled the recipe.  Sauteed some diced carrots with the onion/garlic.  Reduced the  lemon juice and added extra cumin/cilantro as these are my two favorites.  Will be making this again.

This soup was amazing!  I couldn't stop eating, and I'm craving it now that it's gone.  Next time, I think I'll add less lemon juice, though.
