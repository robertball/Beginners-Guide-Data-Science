this was great. I (a light weight) found the vodka strong, my boyfriend thought I should have at least doubled it!  easy to adjust quantities to meet your needs, but the flavors are just perfectly combined.  Highly recommended! :)

Oh my...this is excellent. I halved the vodka because I am a light weight, but otherwise made as directed. This is so ONO and simple.

I used Smirnoff Whipped vodka and homemade lemonade (made with Truvia). Both my husband and I adored this cocktail--the Whipped vodka was AH-mazing in this. After we finished off the first, I turned right around and made another. For us, the vodka amount was just right though the second time around we added another glug. ;)

Excellent! Can be made with watermelon as well, just sub frozen melon balls for the berries. Thank you!

I thought this would be fun to make for a 4th of July party, but our family includes several lightweights and non-drinkers as well as some teens, so I made it alcohol-free.  I am sure with the alcohol, the proportion of ingredients would be great, but it needed something without the alcohol.  I added another 1/2 cup of strawberries and it was perfect.  A real hit at the party!

Not bad  it's OK as is.  I added 1oz to the mix and garnished with a slice of Lime.  I looked that much better.
