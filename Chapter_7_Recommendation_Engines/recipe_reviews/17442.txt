Yummy! I made this cake with a little bit of changes. Used evaporated milk instead of milk,also  added a teaspoon of honey, some raisins and almond. Changing milk to evaporated milk made the cake a bit richer and moist, if you like your cake a bit dense. I tried using regular milk and the cake turn out like any normal cake.Easy,no hassle and delicious! A keeper indeed.

When a friend returned from a Grenada vacation and gave me a little souvenir basket of nutmeg, mace and other spices, I looked on the Web for a Genadian recipe to make to thank her.  I found this Genadian Spice Cake. (None of my several Caribbean cuisine cookbooks had anything like it.)  It was fabulous!  Gloriously fragrant and moist.  A total delight on the first try.  It will surely become one of our family's stable sweet desserts/snacks.

HUGE hit with adults as well as with children.  Very fresh, delicious flavor, almost like pound cake.  Recipe doubles just fine.

Very tasty cake!  I loved the different spice combination with the lime zest much better than the more traditional American spice cake (most have too much cinnamon! for me!)  I baked in a loaf pan, but a tester came out clean after only 1 hour.  I found the cake to have the texture of a dense pound cake.  I might experiment using another white cake recipe with this spice mix.

The flavor of this cake was pretty mild. Just "Okay". I even added a little extra spices due to other reviewers commenting on the lack of spice.   I baked mine in a round 8 or 9 inch baking pan for 35 minutes. Put a tooth pick in and it came out clean. When I cut it there was still some raw dough in the center. I put it back in the oven but it wasn't quite right, of course. The top was getting brown so if I make this again I will put some foil on top to try for a better result.   I gently scooped the flour into the measuring cup as I always do with baked goods. The result for me was that the cake texture was soft and tender. Less dense than a pound cake but more dense than a white or yellow cake.   I also found this cake to be a little too sweet for my preferences. Next time I'll withhold some sugar. I even put a tablespoon of lemon juice in because I had no zest. So I found it particularly too sweet. I also found it to be a bit too oily. I wish I'd subbed half a cup of apple sauce. I think with some fiddling this could be a very good recipe. I also think it could make a delicious sweet bread if pecans were added and it was baked in the loaf pan as directed. I may try this again at Christmas time and see what comes of it.

Oh yes - this is a most excellent cake. I didn't have a lime handy so I zested a clementine. I also used fat free plain organic yogurt instead of milk to make it moister with a tighter crumb and baked it in an ungreased 9" springform pan (lined the bottomw with baking paper). It was perfect. Nicely spiced as is and the orange gave it a hint of sweetness. Drizzled the plates with honey before serving. DH ate 3 slices, and he's usually a chocolate guy. Thanks for the keeper!

This cake is AMAZING. It's just perfect. I didn't have any allspice or limes. I used lemon zest instead. The outside is crispy and the inside is supermoist. I think 90 min was too long. Nextime I will bake tor 75 or 80 min.

This a GREAT recipe!Perfect for "cake" people and  non "cake" people ( being one myself!) I made a few changes based on some other reveiws. Used evaporated milk in place of the reg. ( adds creaminess and moisture)and since i had no limes in the house had to use some bottled lime juice in place of the zest.Also upped the spices, by adding the amount written on the recipe and then adding an extra half of those amounts. I was going to make an icing or glaze to go with this, but once i tasted it with some powered sugar on top, it was all over... it was too good as is to mess with any further!! I LOVE this recipe!! Perfect!

This was very easy and tasted wonderful. I used pumpkin pie spice in place of nutmeg, and doubled the spice. I put it in a pie pan and cooked it for about 25-30 minutes. Very moist cake. Will be making this again. Thank you for sharing.

The lime zest & spices create a unique loaf cake.  I used room temp. butter (instead of chilled) to cream with the sugar, and I substituted half applesauce for part of the butter.  I also cut back a little on the sugar since I am a high altitude baker.  My loaf was done at 60 min. so be sure to check on this as 75 - 90 min. seems way too long.  The loaf was beautiful and tasted great with a cup of coffee.  I'll make this again.  I could see serving this with grilled pineapple and a little whipped cream.

My in-laws raved about this cake.  It is definitely spicy and moist.  I didn't finish my piece, so that's why I am only rating it as 4 stars; maybe I just don't care for spice cake.

I used this recipe to compliment a large caribbean barbeque and it was the perfect cake for the job. I loved the lime zest that was well tasted in the cake, but not over-dominant. Garnished the cake with slivers of pineapple, and lime slices. LOVE THIS CAKE!!

This was great! I put it into a larger pan and it cooked for less than half the time the recipe says which was fabulous. I sprinkled it with sugar on top. I also  made a topping for it that sticks with the whole theme. I sliced fresh peaches, and let them sit with fresh squeezed lime juice, some spiced rum, and sugar. It was awesome together.

Swoon. Am eating a slice as I type. I replaced the milk with coconut milk as suggested by a couple other reviewers. This simple to make cake is one of the most delicious things I've eaten. I baked it in a medium square tin and it only took 35 min to bake. Oh, I also added 1T of lime juice. I love this cake!

Amazing! I love spice cakes in general, but this one was fantastic. I didn't have any limes, so I used orange zest instead. I also used coconut milk instead of regular milk as I already had some on hand. I added a little more spice and used a butter-substitute. I halved the recipe as I wasn't sure how it would be, but it turned out great! I couldn't stop eating it until it was gone! Definitely a keeper.

I've been making this cake for years now, and it always turns out great.  I always change the kind of zest I use to whatever I have on hand and it still turns out delish every time.  My hubby likes this a lot because he's not into super sweet stuff.  Thanks for providing a such a wonderful recipe!

Very good.  My daughter had to do a report on Grenada for school, and we made this cake as part of her presentation.  Very easy because everything is already on the shelf.  75 minutes for baking seemed just enough time.  Recipe simple enough for my 9 year old.  Will definitely make again.

Amazing cake, perfect for autumn and along side mulled apple cider! I added swirled chocolate ganache to the top of mine for a pretty pattern and a bit more sweetness , though this cake is great without any powdered sugar and extremely moist! Good base for an apple upside cake, or a coffee crumb topping would be nice, could do allot with this recipe!

A tasty cake. I added a splash of honeyed whiskey to the mix, along with some fresh ginger. The lime flavor wasn't vert prominent. Next time I'd use more lime.

Made this for my nephew's birthday. He is a big spice cake fan. I used evaporated milk rather than plain and baked it in 2 cake pans for 25 minutes. It came out perfect. (I frosted it with "Coffee Icing" by Carol on this site and that is to die for!) I am not rating it with 5 stars because it has far less spice taste than a box cake. I think it is a sophisticated looking and tasting cake however.

I didn't make this recipe, but I assigned it to a guest at our Taste of the Tropics dinner party and she made it.  Everyone at the party ate it and enjoyed it, and usually there is someone who passes on the cake (I have no idea why anyone would ever do such a thing!)...but it was very yummy and the perfect ending to our tropical and slightly spicy meal we had (Trinidad Stewed Chicken).  She cooked it in a round cake pan instead of a loaf pan so it didn't need as much baking time and we served it with vanilla bean ice cream.  I will make this myself sometime!

Made this and took to work for our monthly breakfast.  It was very well received.  I baked just as directed (this first time).  Next time I would probably up the spices also.  But really good!

This cake is delicious.  I doubled the spices and used evaporated milk as others had suggested.  The cake was nice and dense and only needed a dusting of powdered sugar to make it perfect.

I took this to my supper club for latin night.  I made it as written except I substituted coconut milk for the regular milk.  Also sqeezed a key lime in.  Baked for 55 min in a bundt pan and sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Was a big hit at the supper club.  Nice and moist, pretty dense with a crispy outside.  Used the Passion Fruit Mousse recipe as a "topping".  I didn't like it together but others did.  I think it was great with no topping.  I would make this again.

This is good - really moist - but don't shy away from the spices.  I think it needs more of a kick, personally.  I made a cinnamon-vanilla glaze to top it.

Beautiful flavor.  I took Zakiah's advice and used evaporated milk and the cake had the perfect moisture on the inside.  The outside came out a bit overdone.  I adjusted the time to 70 minutes because I was using a bundt pan but this was way too long.  I will try again and bake for 65 minutes for this type of pan.  Excellent flavor.  Thank you Holly.

I followed this recipe without making any changes.  I felt that it didn't have enough spice added to it.  For reference,  the spice was about half or less than half of the amount you would taste in something like a store-bough banana nut muffin.  It wasn't even close.  If you like the amount of spice in a banana nut muffin, add more to this recipe.  Doubling it would probably be good.  The lime zest also didn't come through enough for me.  Next time, I'd probably add more to it.

This recipe is a great blend of spices with the contrast from the citrus lime flavor.  
Used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  Recipe turned out closer to a pound cake than a fluffy cake.  

We added a lime juice and powdered sugar glaze to the top to add a little more zip.  Really did not need it as the cake was soo tasty all by itself.

Will definitely make this recipe again.

I made this for my cooking group's Caribbean dinner.  It was very easy to make and a great finish to the meal.  Everyone liked it.  I should have stuck to the recipe though.  Several reviewers suggested doubling spices, which I did, and they were overpowering.  The group suggested maybe somewhere in between.  Next time I will soften the butter.  Having it chilled made no sense.  I used a 9" round pan and baked for 45 minutes, and it was perfect.

This is a good spice cake which resembles pound cake. It baked in about 70 minutes in a 9X5 for me, and I probably should've pulled it out five minutes earlier because the edges got a little dark and crunchy. I didn't have a lime so I used lime juice. The flavor probably wasn't as strong but it was still good. I served it with Jay's Jamaican Jerk Chicken.

The flavor of this cake was good however the texture was a bit dry.  We used spices we brought back from Grenada and instead of the loaf pan, we baked the cake in a 9" round cake pan.  We dusted the cake with powdered sugar then, to combat the dryness, we served it with whipped cream.  It wasn't difficult to made but really not worth the effort of making again.
