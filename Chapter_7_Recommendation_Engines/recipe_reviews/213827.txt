I was a bit uncertain about this recipe, even while it was baking.  I had never baked a bread on the stove top.  Well, I followed the recipe exactly.  I did need to add a lot of flour to the surface.  The dough was a bit too moist for kneading.  However, it turned out really well, and it was very easy to make.  It's definitely a classic.  Variations in the future may include currants or maybe some whole grain alternatives.

finally, someone actually knows trad Irish bread does NOT contain raisins or caraway or butter, perfect recipe, though I do 1 cup white unbleached flour, 1 cup brown flour, thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful flavor and texture for such a simple recipe. I've tried several Irish soda bread recipes and this has trumped them all. I did not have actual buttermilk so I used the old milk with vinegar trick. I always feel like I'm cheating when I do that. *laugh* One note: I followed the instructions to add some flour to the cast iron griddle. I found this not only unnecessary, but rather unpleasant. The flour burns which is unsightly and doesn't taste very good. After the first batch I wiped my pan clean, wiped it lightly with oil and much preferred those results. My pan is seasoned enough that it's probably fine without doing any of that so I will skip it altogether in the future. Great recipe!

Thank you so much for posting the un-Americanized version of soda bread. I'd been trying to find a real recipe for several days and managed to stumble upon this one. Such a relief!

Wow!  Got rave reviews for this one.  I added a tsp of Splenda brown sugar for sweetness. I used a george Forman grilling machine with the pizza plate in and cooked it on medium for 30 min.

This is very delicious. I made no changes, and would make exactly the same again, which i plan to do very soon. Everyone in my family liked it also. I liked the fact that it was very moist, although I covered it while it was still warm to make sure that it stayed moist and also softened the crust somewhat, since that was what I was looking for that particular day...
This bread would be wonderful toasted for breakfast with jam, but ours did not make it long enough for that!

This is very simple to make. It's a fine bread, maybe something to go good with a soup or something like that.  I just found it very plain.  I used some honey butter and that was a good addition, but on its own I found it rather bland.

My best friends mom made this for breakfast every weekend.  This is the "real" traditional Irish Soda Bread.  We cut each wedge down the middle added a little butter and retoasted in the frying pan.  Yummy

I've never made soda bread before so this was my first. I actually baked this rather than fry it. I'll try frying it next time. But I think either way is fine because this bread is delicious. It doesn't need to be americanized by adding sugar. It's fantastic the way it is. It's traditional Irish bread and wonderful. I'll be making this again and very often.

Very nice!  I added my picture with the fish plate above.  I like these with whole milk yoghurt and jam.  Yummy.

They are very like Scottish baps, very simple to make and with a plain but good taste.  I can definitely see making these very often.  I initially made some too thick and had to finish the cooking in the oven, and used a think steel pan to cook them.  I would think a thick cast iron skillet would be better for holding the heat more evenly.  Very delicious and fun and quick to make and I also appreciate not having the sweetness or the 'American-ized' version.

My Irish hubby and I loved this. Was looking for something very simple, without sugar or fruit in it.  Tasty.  We had it for our New Year's dinner with black eyed peas and colcannon.

I have tried this recipe but have been cooking it in the oven for about 1/2 hour at 350. I sprinkle the cooking sheet with flour and put it in the oven as it is warming up so it is hot by the time I am ready to put the bread in the oven. It is wonderful...does not need sugar...needs nothing. I will get a heavy skillet just so I can try it on stove top. It is perfect! I love that there is minimal ingredients and has such full taste. I added caramelized onions for a change up. If you can add raisins and currents why not onions? Tastes great but then you cannot have leftovers with jam in the morning.

This was very good and easy to make.  I made it exactly according to directions and it turned out wonderful.  I was a little skeptical using a "skilllet" to bake it in, but it turned out perfect.  Delicious served with butter and jam.  Will make again.

I am really happy I tried this recipe for 2 reasons... 1) multiple reviewers state it is authentic Irish and 2) I've never used the cooking method before.  I followed the instructions to the letter.  (photo contributors to date could not have - recipe is for quartered circle)  It was good, but flavorless. I think I need an Irishman to tell me what topping to use, as this bread is analogous to water crackers -- whatever goes on it will shine.  We tried butter & honey which, while tasty, didn't seem like the right match. I won't be making this again for a family dinner, but I will keep it in mind as THE perfect choice for a thematic party or school event for "pioneer days".

i just made this recipe this morning and it is wonderful - a true irish soda bread ... a simple basic recipe (that can in fact be easily amended to include any americanized or modern variation of your liking) ... i did bake it in the oven whole, cutting a cross on its top, 30 minutes at 350 preheated degrees ... it has a really great flavor and texture, good alone or great with whatever accompaniment you like (butter, cream, honey, sweet sauces, savory sauces) ... given its ease and taste you should never buy this from a super chain commercial homogenized grocery store - ever ... thank you for the recipe :)

This is the way I have been making it for years and it always comes out perfect!  It was passed down to me and I passed it down to my children and my grandchildren too.  For the kids I do put in some raisin for theirs.  Try it, you'll like it!

Don't know what I did wrong, but I measured exactly and got a big lump of dough that was too runny to be formed.  Added another cup and then simply dumped the whole batch into the cast iron fry pan.  yuck

I know everyone's saying "oh, it's so REAL",  but I can tell you that it's not what my gran makes. When I asked her why mine came out so plain, she said "We can afford eggs & butter now that the Famine is over" and gave me her recipe- so thanks! If you like your soda bread plain, that's fine. I notice all the reviewers that say they love soda bread without fruit or butter in it, go on to tell us about all the fruit and butter they put on TOP of it while eating! I'm just cutting out the middleman, lol!

My husband loved this recipe! I've tried the 'other' recipe for easy soda bread and it was good but
It isn't traditional. Real soda bread has no sweetness or eggs in it. This was easy and quick.
I don'thave a heavy pan so i just lightly greased a roasting tray and popped it in a 175°C oven for
25-30 minutes. We ate it warm with a lovely Guinness stew. Looking forward to toasting up the rest with jam for breakfast tomorrow!
Thank you!

This delicious soda bread was exactly what I was searching for...very simple and authentic.  Everyone from age 2 to 70 loved it!  Consistency was perfect even when I increased the recipe size to serve 6. The only problem I had was my fault--I put the flour in my stainless pan too early and it burned a little.  I might try to bake it in my stoneware next time.

This is what I was looking for and remember from my days of visiting Ireland.  It's very basic as that's how much of Ireland's food was for so many years.  Like another reviewer, I was reluctant to make this bread stovetop, as I have never made bread that way.  I was pleasantly surprised with both batches I made--the 1st I had forgotten to add the baking soda due to being distracted by my young son.  No worries though, all have enjoyed in our home.  I topped them with a little irish imported butter this time, but I think I'll try them with jam or apple butter or something else I find yummy to go with.  Super simple and really doesn't take long. Made this to go with the "corned beef & cabbage I" from this site to celebrate St Patty's day.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!

I made this for my brother's traditional Irish boiled dinner and it turned out about how I thought.  It's rather plain but would be great with jelly or some other spread on it.  My only complaint was how sticky the dough was as I was trying to knead it.  I had to add a LOT of flour and work with it more than I would have liked because I was afraid of making the dough tough.  It could have been because I didn't have buttermilk so made sour milk instead, but I've never had any problems substituting that in a recipe before.  Overall, it was a decent bread and I really liked cooking it on the stove top since I've never done that before.

I chose this recipe over others offered on this site b/c it contained no sugar or fruit. I made two mini round loaves and baked them off in the oven b/c I don't yet own a cast iron skillet. The bread that came out was dense, by oh my gosh was it satisfying! Breaking off pieces from the and watching butter melt just before popping it into the mouth--was heavenly! The loaves freeze well too; we just took out a few slices and topped with butter and maple syrup.

I'm told I'm part Irish, but I don't have an Irish granny who passed down recipes. It was fun to give this a try to see what my ancestors might have eaten. I was surprised it was so good for so few ingredients. I had only a small iron skillet handy, so I halved the recipe, and I used powdered buttermilk. Seemed to turn out fine, although next time I'll press out my dough a little thinner - I had it too thick. Another reviewer mentioned the flour in the pan and the trouble with it burning. I agree, even though it might be the authentic approach. Like her, I'll rely on the seasoning of my pan or perhaps a slight bit of oil.

Great recipe.  Simple and quick.  I did baste it with melted butter every few minutes and then when done.  I cooked it on a pizza stone as well.  The boys loved it nice thick dense bread.  Good for a winter's day with soup.  Or on St. Patty's Day.

This is a good, traditional recipe. I prefer to bake soda bread in a dutch oven, so I can't comment on the skillet method.

I  bake it in a baking bowl that ai spray or old and dust with semolina flour. I use a sharp razor or knife to cut the cross and bake at 375 for about and hour make sure it thumps on the bottom. Put on rack and let cool and I use real high quality butter with it. I don’t like the stuff in it. My gram didn’t do it that way except for some chives or some good cheddar when we ate it with soup in the winter. I still do it. I lost my recipe and remembered the 4-2-1 when I saw this one. Back in business. Thanks.

I couldn’t believe how good this was. So few ingredients, I was sure I was going to mess it up. I didn’t and it was great. Perfect biscuit for any meal!

Simple is the best place to start, for those of you who burned the flour, if you bake it, use baking paper.

This is a very good recipe. I am not Irish and have never had Irish soda bread, but was curious and looked for one that was traditional, without yeast, baking powder, etc. It is a simple bread, but is good and easy to make.

I followed the recipe exactly as written (except for the flour in the pan, as I have a lovely seasoned cast iron fry pan) and the bread was delicious.  I will be using this recipe when the hubby wants biscuits.
