Hubby and I enjoyed this very much! I'll admit that I didn't exactly measure the amounts of Bailey's and hazelnut liqueur so much as eyeball the amount in each glass, but it was still tasty! I'm a huge fan of cinnamon too--so rimming the glasses with cinnamon-sugar really adds to this drink (I might even sprinkle some directly into it next time!). Overall, a nice, delicious, and warming way to start off a cold and snowy Sunday morning! Thank you!
