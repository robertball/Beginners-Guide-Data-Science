Eggs in a basket are my husbands claim to fame.  I must note that after cracking the egg into the hole, we do find it necessary to flip them to make sure the white is thoroughly cooked. We used provolone cheese, as that is what we had.   American sliced cheese is usually what hubby uses.

I added a bit of salt and pepper to mine. I made this last night for a late dinner and it was so good I made it again for breakfast. The muenster cheese was a great touch and it melted perfectly.

This was a nice change for egg in a basket. I like to flip mine and cook the egg on both sides. Also I toast the middle piece at the same time and use it to dip in the yoke.
