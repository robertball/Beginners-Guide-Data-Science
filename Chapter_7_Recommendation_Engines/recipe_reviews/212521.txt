My whole family loves Indian food and we eat at various Indian restaurants frequently. My son finally got the courage to try his favorite dish, shahi paneer, at home. This recipe was good, but not great. After searching other similar recipes and experimenting, we found it is missing a key ingredient which gives it it's special flavor: garam masala. Near end of cooking we add 1/4 - 1/3 teaspoon of this and it is fantastic. Also, most shahi paneer recipes include a couple tablespoons of cashew paste. You can make this by soaking approx 12 cashews in boiling water, draining, then pounding into a paste. Lastly, for a creamier sauce like in restaurants, increase water or cream/milk by a cup and lightly puree prior to adding paneer. With a couple tweaks, this is a great and easy recipe.

This was delicious!  Very east to make (homemade paneer is easy to make, too!).  The only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is that the spice level here is very very mild.  I would at least double the amount of spices used here to give it more of an Indian flavor.  Nonetheless, it was delicious!

This was good, I definitely ate all of it within a two day span. I did give some to a friend and sister, and they LOVED IT. I made some modifications:  I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the fresh pureed, which I found made it too tomato-y. I added more cream to balance out the thick tomatoes, and didn't have to adjust the spice balance. It was perfect. Since I didn't want to eat too much fattening dairy, I used chickpeas instead of paneer, and it was just as delicious. Will use this recipe again, only I will follow the exact directions with the tomatoes! Or...use only half a can of crushed rather than the whole darn thing at once.

This was really good. I used diced tomatoes and 1/2 can (about 7 ounces) of tomato sauce instead of the tomatoes (no pureeing) and used 1/2 Half and Half and 1/2 evaporated skim milk instead of the cream to bring down the calories. I also added some potatoes in with the tomatoes because I didn't have that much paneer on hand, and it was delicious and a bit heartier. I found it slightly bland, so I added about 1/2 tablespoon of Garam Masala to kick it up, which immediately did the trick. Really good recipe.

I've been trying to find this recipe that actually tasted right.  This is the closest I've come!  It was excellent!  I added 1/2 t. garam masala, 1/4 c. chicken broth, peas, and some crushed red pepper.  Will add more crushed red pepper next time as I think it could use more spiciness to it.  But so, so happy to finally find a keeper!

Very tasty dish. I made this with homemade paneer (Rasgullas recipe), but you need about 2l milk to prepare paneer. I served this with rice, everyone liked.

This is amazing! For those of you who mentioned that your homemade paneer fell apart during cooking (make sure the paneer is refrigerated long enough), I fried my paneer cubes first which makes it hold up a bit better. I used coconut oil and fried them for just a few minutes, until they started turning nice and golden brown, and then took them out before adding the onions and garlic. I also followed the advice of others and added about a half teaspoon of garam masala and I also added about half a teaspoon of ground ginger. I used canned pureed tomatoes (about half the can) for ease. Since my favorite shahi paneer dish at a local restaurant uses cashew paste, I decided to make my own (just soaked a small handful of cashews in hot water, drained and pureed) and added it in with the sugar, water, salt and paneer. Delish!

Made this tonight, quick, yet still holds authentic flavour, will make again for sure.  Only change was the use of pureed tomatoes instead of fresh.

Very good. I have to say though, I had a vague idea of what went into pneer and when my   unopened litre of milk started to curdle i just put it straight into a clean cloth and ended up with something a bit like cream cheese (I left out lemon or vinegar!), very creamy and not sour at all. Then i followed this recipe after searching for something to make with my paneer look-alike and ended up with a very tasty curry :) thank you.

This was my first attempt at making Indian food at home.  I got impatient with my Paneer by Amibould & didn't end up frying it.  It fell apart a little and didn't have that nice texture on the outside- totally my fault.  I fried the (uncooked) leftovers the next day and they turned out better.  Also, I think I'll chop my onions instead of slicing them because they were a bit stringy/messy to eat, like noodles.  I might look for a spicier recipe or just up the spices on this one next time.

This was good. I used half paneer and half chick peas. I found that the spices needed to be doubled for my taste though.

Great recipe! I doubled the spices and threw in some chickpeas and frozen spinach when I added the tomatoes. Will definitely make again. Served it over brown rice and with naan.

I am a South Indian and we use to have shahi paneer only at indian restaurants. And we all love it... I tried this recipe and came out as good as we have at restaurants. Thank you for the recipe... I most of the time make shahi tofu and my family and friends just love it...

All three kids gave this at least a 9 out of ten stars!  I need to remember to double the recipe for my family of 5.  I also added at least 1/2 cup more cream as suggested by some others.

This was a pretty easy recipe to follow for my first time making Indian food.  It was quite a bit milder than I expected & I will probably increase the spices nest time.  I think it would have benefited from more cooking time as well.  I used fresh pureed tomatoes and I don't think 3 - 5 minutes was enough time to cook the tomatoes before adding the paneer.  Overall a pretty good dish.

Wonderful base, however, I did saute fresh, minced green chilies, clliantro & ginger with the onions & garlic. Added fresh, pureed tomatoes. Didn't have cream, so I used 2 TB sour cream, about 1/2 C of 2% milk & 1/4 C of cashew paste (thickener). I used an electric grinder on 15 cashews (from trail mix I had on hand:).  You can also chop nuts fine and grind to a paste by hand. If you don't have a pestle & mortar, use a heavy duty ice cream scoop and small, sturdy bowl. I love this thickening agent which has great flavor! I had to add a little more towards the end to our liking. Also, added 1/2 tsp garam masala. Peas would be great in this recipe.  Topped with fresh cilantro and served with roti.

I liked this and so did my husband but the spice level was way too low for us - it didn't taste "authentic" enough.  I did add 1 tsp garam masala at the end but next time perhaps 1 Tbs. garam masala along with a shake of cayenne would do the trick heat-wise.
A delicious dish - thank you for sharing.

LOVE this recipe. It's the first base for a curry I've found that tastes like restaurant quality. I've changed paneer to chickpeas + peas to make it a bit healthier. It's still DELICIOUS. I double the spices, put 1.5 times the garlic, and use half a can of crushed tomatoes instead of fresh for convenience. The rest is just perfect.

Really great and simple. I made some minor modifications based on ingredients I had on hand (I used canned diced tomatoes mixed with regular tomatoes), but it was still fantastic.
