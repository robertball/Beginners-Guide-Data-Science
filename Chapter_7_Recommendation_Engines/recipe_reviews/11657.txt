These are definitely not "snaps", they are quite soft and cake-like. However, that's just the way I like them! I doubled the ginger and they had a delicious spice. Great recipe.

I didn't have any cloves, but I substituted with an equal amount of allspice. The cookies came out a little overdone, but I don't have an oven thermometer so I can't be sure if it is the fault of the recipe or if my oven cooks too hot. Overall these cookies are delicious!

Overall this recipe was very good but they are definatly not ginger snaps there more like ginger cookies they are very moist and soft in the middle but they do have a nice mild taste to them. But since they were not "snaps" I ended up using a cookie cutter and made gingerbread men and using buttercream icing to decorate them so there more fun for my children.

I made these for my son's friend who loves gingerbread. I used brown sugar for the white and added 1/8 tsp salt since it was unsalted butter.
I yielded 52 cookies, at 10 minutes they were soft and chewy at 12 minutes they were crisp like ginger snaps. We liked them either way.
Dough is quite soft and sticky, I froze the log to make it easier to slice.

Nice tasting (I grated the fresh ginger root and used a little molasses instead of the honey.  I may add a pinch of creme of tartar the next time (to get the 'snap').

I made these as stated in the recipe, and as the other reviews have noted, they are soft and cake-like.  These cookies had excellent flavor and were quite addicting.  I prefer a little crunch, so the next batch I baked an extra two minutes and it came out fine, not quite a snap, but some crunch.
