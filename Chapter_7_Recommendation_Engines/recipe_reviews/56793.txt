my husband is Indian and this just didn't have enough "kick" for us. If you like it mild then it should be good for you.

This is a nice, clean and simple side dish for an Indian meal. Some of the reviewers are wanting it to be something else. Please note that the recipe calls for cumin *seed*, not ground cumin, which would definitely overpower this dish if mistaken. I made this recipe as written, salting to taste, and enjoyed it very much with Steve's Chicken Korma from this site. Thanks for the recipe!

way too much cumin.  if you try this, I suggest cutting the cauliflower as small as possible. it was difficult to toss the seeds and oil to get the vegetables fully covered.  I might try it again.

I liked this because it was quick and easy.  I used garam masla instead of cumin.

This was alright. Be careful though, when it says the seeds will pop, they aren't kidding! They are like little tiny molten BB's if you leave them too long!

I followed the recipe closely, but I found the finished dish bitter and almost inedible. I will not make this again.

I was using up leftovers, so I tried this with shredded cabbage in place of the peas.  It was very, very good, but I will experiment with adding a little "heat" to it next time.

Made this last night with Chicken Makhani (Mitch Ferguson) and it was delicious!  I didn't have cumin seeds, so I added ground cumin when I added the vegs and gave it a stir.  I can't wait to try it with the cumin seeds.  Thanks

Yummy, quick, and easy, my favorite kind of recipe!  I left out the cumin and mustard seeds and added parmesan cheese at the end.  Delicious!

I modified this recipe by adding 1/2 tsp of each: salt, chili powder, ginger, tumeric. It tasted so much better

Not bad. A little too much cumin I think though...and I love cumin! I used one can of peas plus a can of diced tomatoes and let it all simmer a while until the cauliflower got nice and mushy. I have better ways of fixing cauliflower, but I may try this again since it was very easy.

Very tasty. Made as a side for other Indian dishes, so appreciated that there were only 2 spices. Adjusted a bit by decreasing cumin seeds and sprinkling on some turmeric.

It was flavorful, but a little too salty...and I only used half the recommended amount of salt. I also cooked it much longer then called for. The cauliflower was still quite crunchy, but the peas were overdone. If I make it again, I might precook the cauliflower a bit.

I've used a recipe for cauliflower alone which is virtually identical to this version with its addition of green peas. It's quick, easy and very tasty, although some may be put off by seeds sticking between their teeth. Although not ideal, the recipe can be paused after seeds begin popping in the hot oil. By the way, you don't want all of them to pop. Take your skillet off heat, then reheat and resume after you get a few fresh pops. Also good to toss the veggies about when you add them to the skillet to distribute seeds and oil. A garnish of chopped cilantro works nicely, especially for my cauliflower only version.

Oily taste - Perhaps one should decrease the vegetable oil to 2 tablespoons or use olive oil instead. Cumin seeds were straggling all over my plate to where I wanted to corral them in a cream sauce.

Delicious.  Used olive and fresh peas, added the garam masala and paprika recommended by another reviewer.  Didn't have cumin seeds, so used about 1/4 of the amount in powder; might have been okay to add a little more.  Otherwise just as written.  Thanks for the easy, tasty recipe.

made this using some of the suggested modifications (tomatoes, masala, etc) and it still turned out pretty bland -- the only one in our family to really enjoy it was my 13 month old daughter!  That's the only reason I'm giving this 3 stars.  Maybe some curry powder and chickpeas might have helped...some potato...I don't know, but it needed SOMETHING!

Maybe it was my fault, but this just didn't turn out so well.  I used canned peas and it was just a mess.  Maybe you should try it using fresh peas -- let me know how it goes.  My husband would have my head if I made this again!
