Had a difficult time finding nice basil this time of year - December - and it was a bit messy to make with oily fingers from the marinated cheese, but the guests ate them right up and everyone said they were delicious. Yes, I'll make it again.

Super simple, yet impressive appetizer. I love caprese skewers, and especially the presentation of this recipe with the halved tomatoes and wrapped mozzarella. I drizzled balsamic glaze and olive oil on a serving plate, then placed the skewers on top, then sprinkled with freshly cracked sea salt and black pepper. Delicious!
