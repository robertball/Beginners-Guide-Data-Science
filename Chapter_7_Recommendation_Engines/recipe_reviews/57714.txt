This is fantastic.  Now all my southern friends prefer my greens to theirs.  The only changes I made were using smoked ham hocks and smoked neckbones (not the salt pork).  You can get these at all supermarkets (at least in the South).

I have read all the reviews and I am so grateful everyone loved this recipe. I am sorry my Gramma Ollie couldn't be here to taste them herself. Just to clarify a couple of things:  I use chicken bouillon cubes and rinse the salt pork before hand. I have used smoked hocks with great results and bacon when I'm too lazy to find them. I also recently discovered that balsamic vinegar on these is the BOMB! But I use pepper sauce too. Thanks for all the great feedback and suggestions!!

Wonderful way to cook greens of all types.  I use 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar along with the red wine vinegar.  I allow the pot liquor to cook at least 3 hours prior to adding greens. Also the left over liquid can be frozen for use later.  I remove the meat and other large solids prior to freezing.

Makes a great meal!

My mother and grandmother made collard greens every New Years Day for as long as I can remember as these are just as good (if not better).  The hamhocks are crucial to the recipe and I would suggest cooking them in the stock for at least an hour before putting the greens in.  Thank you for the recipe!  Warmed vinegar on the side is also a great plus!

This is one of the best "Greens" recipes ever...and this is from a girl born and raised in Georgia. Be sure and freeze the "pot liqour" as a base for future soups.

Made two modifications to this recipe.  1. Used a mix of greens - one bunch each collard, mustard, turnip and kale. 2. Used 1/2 tsp of my Dad's creole seasoning  I omitted any extra salt or pepper and did not include the vinegar. Also, sauteed onions in a tablespoon of canola oil along with a couple of cloves of minced garlic and the creole seasoning before adding ham hocks, salt pork, chicken stock and bay leaves. I let this cook for about 2 hours to really get the pot liquor a nice flavor. After adding the greens I let this cook for another 1-1/2 on low. Chopped up the meat from the salt pork (removed all the fat) and from the ham hocks and added that to the finished greens.   My husband loved this the first time out of the pot. Thanks for the recipe and all your suggestions!

I am a Texas hillbilly and have eaten greens all my life. This was delicious even to my city slicker kids. They ask me to make them again. Who needs red wine vinegar? These are delicious right out of the pan.

Ive made greens before using a Rachel Ray recipe but and they were "ok" but these were great. You definatly need the ham hocks - my husband gobbled them up. Thanks so much! Served with Fried Catfish and cornbread!

The ingredients are right on, but not the cooking directions.  First, cut the salt pork in slices or chunks and boil in a separate pot until almost tender, but not quite and pour off the water and set aside. Now, wash your ham hocks off and put them in a pot, cover with water, bring to a boil and cook over medium heat for about fifteen minutes and pour the water off.  Then, start a fresh pot with water to cover and cook until almost tender, but not quite done.  Then, add your remaining ingredients and salt pork with your greens and bring to a boil.  Simmer about an hour, or until the greens are the way you like them.  Some people like them chewy, so take a few out after about 45 minutes and taste them for tenderness..  These steps are necessary to keep from having your greens too salty.

This recipe is very easy to follow all you need is to start it with enough time before hand, I couldn't find the right kind of meat at my grocer so I substituted a smoked ham hock and didn't even defrost before adding it.  It turned out wonderful and had great flavor plus it was really simple!

Delicious. I made these w/ the leftover honey-baked ham bone and they came out great! Didn't need any extra salt because the ham and chicken broth are already so salty.

I am a country girl at heart and this recipe truly delivered a nice updated taste.I let these set for awhile to absorb as much flavor as I could get and then reheated just before serving. We  have had greens at our new years dinner since I can remember these where a hit even with my teens. I will have these as a stable on our table.
Thanks for the recipe.

This was very very good, I didn't have the ham hocks to add but for sure will next time.  The flavors were very good, be sure to either make your own chicken stock or use a reduced salt one or this will be too salty.

My son-in-law loves collard greens from his childhood. He loved these! I used smoked ham hocks and omitted the pork salt; everything else was per the recipe. James added more hot sauce to suit his taste.

I added thinly sliced radishes and chopped hard boiled egg to each bowl, topping the greens. I also rinsed what salt I could off the hocks. This was sooo good. Definately a keeper!

My first time making collard greens and I'm so pleased with the results. I was at the farmer's market yesterday and I couldn't pass up the .50 per bunch of beautiful collards. I immediately came home and found this recipe. I had a couple of smoked pork bones in my freezer which I used instead of ham hocks and no salt pork. Everything else I followed in the recipe except that the greens really took over an hour to get tender but I did have a huge pot full. My husband kept telling me that he hated collard greens. After his first bite, "honey, your greens are really good".

I added bacon to finish it off, and I used white vinegar instead of red wine.  Tasted great!  Now all my west coast friends know what the fuss is about.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first time I have EVER cooked collard greens I am truly happy with. I am a cooking novice so I had to throw the first batch out: I used chicken broth instead of chicken stock, which made the greens too salty; they were inedible. After I searched this site for a basic chicken stock recipe, however, my greens were absolute perfection. This recipe rocks.

This is it: this is the one for me.  I think I'm going to marry this recipe, because I will never use another greens recipe for as long as I live.  Now, not only is my husband happy I can make something that actually tastes good, but my kids eat it, and I don't think I've ever had greens anywhere near as good as this recipe makes them!

I made this recipe exactly as written except I used turkey necks instead of ham hocks and it was the best greens I've ever made. My Louisiana husband who has not like any of my attempts at greens for over fifteen years said they were slamming.

this recipe is wonderful..especcially since greens are sooo healthy for you..my mother (born and bred arkie)always had jar of hot peppers on the table to use the juice for the greens. also one little tip. if you cook just plain greens when in a hurry...just a pinch of nutmeg  while cooking will take away any bitter taste and you can never tell it has nutmeg in them..i never cook greens without a little red pepper flakes either.

THYME4MA said that, "balsamic vinegar on these is the bomb".   Was that instead of the other vinegar or, after the greens are cooked?

These are the best. We have family and friends that gorw collards and very year I'm asked to make these. I can't wait, in a few more weeks, I can make these bad boys. I like others used red wine vinegar, I love pepper vinegar and I'm sure that would work too.  just cause that is what I had, and I used fresh salted pork, not store bought.

Very good - similar to what MIL used to make. I skipped the salt pork because I didn't have any and used a ham shank because I did. Thanks for the recipe!

I was a little skeptical of the sugar in this recipe and tasted it at intervals to see how the sugar blended. By the time it was done cooking you would never know there was sugar in it. The only things I will change when I make it next is to leave out the salt pork and use smoked hocks. I also chose to leave out the red pepper flakes and the vinegar because I used Tobasco sauce which is my personal favorite.

Wow, these are the best greens I have ever had, and I am southern-bred so that says something. I mixed a half a cup of these greens and a bit of country sausage with my grits for breakfast this morning. Dee-lish!

These were great!  I'm not southern so collard greens were a bit of a mystery to me.  Not anymore!  I did have to make some adjustments.  I used leftover Christmas ham, cubed, and a total of 1 quart of liquid for 1 pound of collards (one can of lowfat chicken broth, a can of water and a bouillon cube).  I completely forgot the vinegar, but it didn't need it.  It was delicious.  I'm going to try the leftover liquid with some Brussels sprouts.

This is the best greens recipe I have tasted.  Don't leave out the salt pork. I made these for a fish fry the night before.  Everybody raved about these greens. My husband's family didn't think I had it in me.  I also added smoked neckbones.

This was my first time making Collards and i tell you, being a southern gal... This is the best! I will never go back to can greens again! Like others i only used about a pound of ham hck... left all the other salty stuff out. There's no need. Really the chicken stock flavors it!

I have made this recipe multiple times for racing and football tailgates. I sub out the pork fat and red wine vinegar with ingredients which make my greens the "Italian" collard greens.  Awesome recipe.  I get requests for it all the time.  Thanks for sharing this base recipe,

It is extremely flavorful and soft. Will definitely make it again. I did serve it with a drizzle of balsamic reduction which added just the right amount of acid to balance the dish

I've made this 3 times in less than a month and it's a HUGE hit! The only change I made was to use smoked bacon in place of the salt pork. It seems to give it a little better flavor and a little less fatty taste.  Excellent as a side or main dish!!

Real Deal Greens!!  I used smoked turkey legs because I 'm not a fan of pork (except bacon!); otherwise no changes and it  brought me back to North Carolina with every bite.

Excellent!  I forgot the chicken broth but did not need it.  What I did do was to start with the pot of boiling water and the ham hock, allowing it to boil for long enough to really flavor the water.  I did not have any bacon to add but it wasn’t missed after water well-flavored.

I made the recipe as is with the exception that I added just a little bit of smoked Seminole garlic.  Our whole  family had just spent a week in the Charleston area for my folks 50th wedding anniversary.  Most of my family had never tried collard greens, but did for the first time on vacation.   We had a celebration gathering back home yesterday and I made this dish to share...this is my first try at collard greens.  I was happy that the recipe was fairly easy to make and that all of my family who tried it said they really liked it and now I will be expected to bring it to all future family diners.  :).  I may substitute  very thin shredded carrots for the white sugar...as I am someone who prefers carrots as a sweetener over sugars...an old Italian tradition/trick.

Not really, but I would recommend browning the country ham before adding it to the broth. It just looks kind of watery and pink instead of crisped and browned. It would "appear' much more appetizing and not change the flavor all that much if any.

My first attempt at making greens came out wonderfully. The only thing I added was a finely minced onion that I sautéed in the pot with a little olive oil before adding the broth to the pot. I also used smoked turkey legs and neck instead of pork. I will definitely be making greens more often because of this recipe.

I agree the ingredient list is almost perfect (I use bacon, rather than salt pork), but the directions are not quite how I cook collards.    I generally cook six pieces of thick bacon in a skillet, saving 2 Tbsp of  oil and the cooked bacon.  Add the bacon grease and the onions and the torn greens (not sliced) and wilt the greens.  Add the ham hocks, stock and bring to a boil then drop to a simmer.  Simmer until greens are tender  Add the crumbled bacon and serve with PEPPER sauce and cornbread,..  Or crackling bread, if you really want Southern.

Best greens ever.  I used smoked ham hocks instead of the neck bones and did not include salt pork. I had some turkey in the freezer and added turkey meat.

To reduce the fat and salt content, I substituted chopped turkey pastrami for the salt pork and the ham hocks. I also used reduced sodium chicken stock. If you don't want the hot spicy kick that the red pepper flakes provides, you can substitute any decent dry barbecue rub that doesn't include really hot seasons such as pepper flakes. The barbecue rub provides a really nice flavoring.

Absolutely delicious. My entire family loved it. The only problem was the salt pork. It was way to fatty and was like having chunks of fat in the greens. I mixed it with black eyed peas and rice.

I have tried several different recipes for greens.  These are the best I have ever eaten.
I liked it better with out the vinegar.

Left out salt pork (not neccessary) and used a leftover Honey-baked ham bone.  Wonderful.  Did not need the sugar because the ham bone added enough sweetness.  I think using chicken "stock" and not chicken "broth" also made a difference.

I made my version of this recipe a bit healthier (and spicier). I put 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. Omitted salt pork and used smoked pork hocks for flavor. Didn't need any vinegar, it's perfect as is.

I usually just make greens with hamhocks or neckbones with salt and pepper and they are so good made the basic way! However, these were delicious! I am torn as to which way I like better! I did save the 'pot liquor' and use it again, but the flavor wasn't as good . Wonderful recipe! Thank you :)

I just started making/eating greens and found this recipe.  I used Andoulli chicken sausage to try and reduce calories and it was fantastic!  I froze all the leftovers for future lunches.
