Fantastic change from hum drum tacos!!! Slice after cooking into finger size food and serve with various dips for a great appetizer.  You will be glad you found this simple yummy.

This recipe was great, and healthy too. I altered this a little by substituting yellow peppers for the green and adding sliced mushrooms. The sauce never thickened, but I'll probably use a little less water next time. Awesome flavor. I chose to serve this in sun-dried tomato and basil tortillas, which worked well.

Ummmmmm - I love these!  We use fat-free tortillas and sour cream to make a VERY healthy and delicious meal!  I get rave reviews every time I serve these - even from those "full fat" people who have no idea that I'm using fat-free ingredients.  Hee-hee...
