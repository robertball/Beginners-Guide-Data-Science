This turned out pretty good. As mentioned by the recipe submitter I substituted parsley for thyme. Not that it needed it but I added toasted sesame seeds to the sauce because I was going for a more Asian flavor to pair with my sides. The one thing I did not like was the cinnamon.

My family loved this recipe it is similar to one that is on food network which uses cumin instead of cinnamon. I cooked a 1 pound piece of salmon skin side down for 7 minutes in a cast iron skillet then moved it to the oven for 10 minutes then I covered the salmon (still in the cast iron skillet) with foil for 10 minutes. Perfect! I will definitely make this again. The sauce on the salmon paired nicely with a rice pilaf.

This was great, and SO fast and easy.  I’ve made it twice, and my husband loved it.  I shared it with a friend, and she loved it too!  We both made the recipe exactly as directed.  Why fool with these recipes before you even try them?  That doesn’t seem like an honest review for the first attempt. 
 I also appreciate suggestions for changes, but only after the reviewer tried the original as it  was written.  We thought this was a keeper!

This one is  a winner just as written, and will be my go-to salmon recipe on busy nights, or for friends whom you know like salmon.
