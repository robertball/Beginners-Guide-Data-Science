Basic good taste, easy, fast, and something a little extra for a holiday.  Shall we try shamrocks for St. Patrick's Day?

Simple and easy and very tasty! My 8 yr old helped with these since he's learning to cook and he enjoyed them too! These are creative too since you can shape them in many different shapes. We made circles too since my 20 month old is learning shapes...what a great teaching tool!!! Fun and edible!!! Very tasty!!!! Thanks so much craft foods!!!

Four stars for the idea...very cute...I arranged them in a wooden bowl for an attractive addition to our Valentine's day dinner. The thyme was a little overpowering however...unless you are a big fan of thyme I would suggest omitting it, or using it very sparingly.

Fun, easy, and cute!  I used butter spray and garlic salt instead of the parm.
