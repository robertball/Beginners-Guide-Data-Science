I made it nearly exactly as suggested and it was terrific. I did use the hot version of Rotel, which gave it just the right amount of spice. This one is definitely a keeper!

Good taste but it needed something.  I used it to top my burger and loved it!

I won't make this again. The rice was still crunchy after the required amount of baking time.  Too much liquid made it soupy. The leftovers we used as a filler for burritos, but I still didn't like it.

I made this today. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. It was a hit. I'll definitely make this recipe in the near future.
