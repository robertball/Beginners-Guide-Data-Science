Very nice!  I used applesauce in place of the vegetable oil and cut down the number of egg yolks to one without compromising flavor, texture, consistency,etc.  Very flavorful bread which presents beautifully!

Fabulous recipe!!! Smells absolutely heavenly while baking. I substituted apple sauce for the oil, and only used 2 eggs. I made half the batch in a mini-muffin tin, and the other half in a loaf pan. Excellent! I will definitely make this again!!

I made so many loaves of this bread.  I brought it into work and after 30 minutes it was completly gone!  The coconut makes it so moist without giving it a real coconut taste.  I highly recommend this wonderful bread.

dark and somewhat dense with a very good texture.  
The light coconut flavor sets it apart from all the hundreds of plain-ole pumpkin breads out there.

This would have deserved 5 stars in my book if I hadn't altered it as much as I did.  This recipe seems to fall in line with sugar and oil as most other quickbreads but I personally feel those standards are too sweet and too oily.  I cut the sugar in half and used 1.5 cups of yogurt in place of some of the oil and added just 4 tablespoons of oil. Also I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1.5 cups of AP flour.  Let me tell you, I make QB's all the time and these were light and fluffy, almost like a cake and they were delicious.  I love cooking with pumpkin and always looking for new recipes. In case someone follows my lead, I didn't add water till the very end to thin out the batter and it only ended up being 1/3 of a cup.

Made this twice, second time a double batch.  Nothing but GOOD to say about this recipe.  I leave out the clove and add a little extra of the other spices.  Took out enough batter before adding the coconut to make one loaf and it was great, too. I don't even LIKE pumpkin, but I like this.

I made exactly as written and I think it turned out very good.  I did have to bake it about 10 minutes longer than indicated

Delicious!  The only change I made was using 1/2 C oil and 1/2 C applesauce.  Thanks for this recipe.

I didn't get a whole lot of coconut flavor from this - my own fault, my cocnut was a tad OLD & as a result dried out & not so potent. It was still very good, was a hit for the brunch to which I brought it. I am going to have to try it again with new coconut. PS used fresh pumpkin that I puree myself each fall. Wonderful.

AWESOME!!  This was a wonderful bread and I'm not even a huge fan of pumpkin!  It was very moist and flavorful.  I made them into "mini" breads and also made a decorative bunt cake out of it.  They all came out wonderful and everyone loved them.  I will be making this again soon!

This bread is great.  I thought to myself pumpkin and coconut?  I'll give it a try, sounds interesting.  Wow!  What a great combo! I made bread and muffins.  My family and friends where looking for more!  Thanks for sharing.  I will be making this again!

This bread is delish!  Very moist and spicy.  The coconut adds a surprising texture and flavor.  I can't make anything by following the recipe exactly, so I made the following changes:  decreased the white sugar to 1 1/2 cups (will probably try 1 cup next time), substituted 1 cup applesauce for the oil, increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp, and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar combination on top before it baked.  It took quite a bit longer to bake than the recipe said (about 1:15 or 1:20--I lost track). It's delicious after it cools, but even better the next day.

Wonderful recipe. The flavors worked very well together and it makes the kitchen smell divine. Adding coconut to a pumpkin quick bread was a refreshing new take on fall favorites. I'm looking forward to using this recipe again in the next few months.

This was a big hit at my work but I wasn't the most fond of it.  It was a little to spicy for me and I usually will eat anything that has pumpkin in it, so a I am used to those flavors.  I'm not sure why I wasn't thrilled with it.  I did cook it in a shallow cake like pan and cut it into squares so people could eat it by the bite instead of the slice.

I'm surprised the "review numbers" on this one are not a lot higher. I had to use up some pumpkin puree, and since I had coconut too, I decided to try it. This is FANTASTIC!! I just used 4  teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice (since I didn't have cloves or allspice) and I used 1 cup of walnuts. It does take the entire hour to cook, and I had to do an extra 5-10 minutes to make sure the middle of the loaves were done. This will become a regular for us.

Oh man, I just made this loaf...wow!
It is sooooo good. This is the kind of loaf you don't want to make too often because you end up eating the whole thing by yourself. Thanks for the recipe.

This is good bread and very moist.  I ended up with three loaves (using 4.5 X 8.5 inch loaf pans).  I froze two and am hoping the other two will be just as good!

My husband loved this.  I made it one night planning to freeze one of the loaves, but by the time they cooled my husband had already finished the first one and half of the second.  Great recipe, I will be making this again.

Made this bread last week. Halved the recipe though as only half the family enjoys pumpkin :). It was soooooo wonderful! some pumpkin breads tend to taste better after a few days on the counter, however this one was irresistable right out of the oven! its a keeper & I will be sharing!

I made this pumpkin bread and the only thing I changed was the white flour to whole wheat flour.  It was very moist and delicious.  I gave one to my mother who shared it with some other relatives and now they all want the recipe.

WOW! this is like the best thing I have ever made. I love it and so did everyone else. Only thing I changed was using coconut oil instead of vegetable and didnt have walnuts so i used chopped pecans. And I also made my own pumpkin puree instead of buying the can.So good. I will definitely be making this again.

Thank You Donna...I made this yesterday morning, first thing. My little cottage still smelled like the warmest holiday wishes after the 11 PM news and oh my!, the rave reviews! "where'd ya get that recipe?" I followed the recipe substituting only canola for veggie oil. It's wonderfully moist and sinfully delicious..I had to share cuz my healthier lifestyle would have been sorely tested with this in the cupboard

This bread was really good.  I made one loaf and 12 muffins and served them as dessert for a fall dinner. I took the advice of cutting back the sugar to 1 cup of white and 1 cup of unpacked brown. Also used 1 1/2 cups of yogurt and 4 tbsp. of oil to replace the 1 cup of veg. oil.  We had the bread with whipped cream and my husband has already asked me to make this again.

This was a very tasty bread and had a nice chew to it from the coconut.  In-laws liked it quite a bit.

A nice pumpkin bread, but not my favorite. I followed the recipe exactly, though I omitted the nuts (I don't like them in breads). Despite what other reviewers said, I could not really taste the coconut--all it did was add an interesting texture to the bread. However, the pumpkin flavor was very tasty and slightly spicy, and the bread itself turned out incredibly moist. If I did make this recipe again, I would sub in raisins for the coconut. However, I think I will stick with my personal fave recipe, also found on this site--Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread.

Finally - a bread that I can make & it turned out! I made this for Thanksgiving & it was a huge HIT. I loved it too. Great flavor & very easy. I took the suggestion of other reviews & only used 2 eggs and substituted the oil for applesauce. I also had to cook it for 70 minutes. VERY GOOD ! Thanks for sharing.

I made this gluten free using pamela's baking mix in place of the flour.. I also used coconut oil in place of veg oil and cut the white sugar by 1/2 a cup.. And it is so yummy.. I made one large loaf and 4 small loafs.. Needless to say i sat here and at one small loaf almost immediately.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe

I make this every year around the holidays and it is always a big hit.  I haven't done it with the coconut but will try - instead I add 1/2 package per loaf of peanutbutter chips -- it's wonderful with a hot cup of tea or chocolate.

Wonderful bread! Great flavor and texture. I used canola instead of vegetable oil, and pecans instead of walnuts and it came out great. I will definitely make this again.

So Delicious!! Didn't have enough eggs so I found through a google search to sub 1/3 cup mayo per egg, so I used 2/3 cup mayo and 2 eggs, and then I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder to help leaven since the mayo wasn't going to do that like an egg. It worked great. I made one 9x5, one 8x4 and two 2 1/2 x 4 loaves.

The first pumpkin bread I've ever eaten, much less made. Holy cow, this is wonderful. I used only brown sugar (had no white), added raisins, and used applesauce in place of oil. I didn't have ground clove, would've been perfect if I had. Great recipe, thanks for sharing! Oh yeah, the coconut...perfect add texturally, didn't overpower with taste, only added slightly. This recipe is totally in the keeper box!

This was a really good pumpkin bread and I don't even like pumpkin! I think that the coconut wasn't really necessary as I didn't get any coconut flavor at all, but my boyfriend liked that it made it more chewy. I also used a full cup of walnuts and it had the perfect amount of crunch for my taste. I will definitely be making this again although I may try it without the coconut or perhaps use some coconut extract to bring out that flavor more.

This was delicious. The only change I made was that I used 4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices. Each of those spices cost about seven dollars each. It was cheaper just to use the pumpkin pie spice

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and made the following changes:
Used applesauce in place of over half the oil. I would have replaced all the oil if I'd had enough applesauce.
Used only half the white sugar called for.
Skipped the allspice because I didn't have any. It was still plenty flavorful; I wouldn't have wanted it to taste any more spiced.
Used 3 1/2 cups whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup flax seed, and 3 cups white flour, instead of all white.
Increased the grated coconut by 1 cup, since other reviewers said they couldn't taste it much.
Reduced the eggs from eight to six, on the suggestion of other reviewers.
Used 2 cups walnuts (I'd probably make it 3 next time).
The bread is delicious and has a nice texture. I'll probably use the recipe for muffins next time. It would make AWESOME muffin tops!

This recipe turned out very nice. Consistent texture. Nice flavour. I added chia seeds for crunch. Because I used my own pumpkin purée instead of canned omitted the water.

This bread is great. I omitted the nuts. I prefer to use dried cranberries or chocolate chips in place of the nuts but it is good without. I also prefer vegetable oil but it is also great with the vegetable oil that it calls for. I am not sure if the recipe intended sweetened or unsweetened coconut shreds but I always use the unsweetened and it is great.

Delicious! I did decrease the sugar to 1 1/2c white sugar only, next time I think I would do half white & half brown,  1 tsp salt & only used the end of a bag of unsweetened flaked coconut & used homemade pumpkin pie spice, about 2 tsp, 1/2 c oil & 1/2 c applesauce (tip if you only need about 1/2c applesauce for a recipe buy a jar of babyfood applesauce)

I forgot to add the water, but it still turned out great!  My husband and I both loved it.
