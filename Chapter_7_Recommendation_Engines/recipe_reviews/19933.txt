Here is another good Persian recipe!  You can't go wrong with this.  Remember...the longer you marinate the better!

I love saffron, and this recipe was divine.  I served it with an herbed rice pilaf, and it was super delish. I marinated overnight, and suspect the longer it marinates, the better it tastes.  Helpful hint: I made the onion juice by chopping an onion and then squeezing the juice out with my potato ricer.  It worked pretty well.

This was a nice dish.  I made the onion juice by finely grating an onion.  Although this was good, the onion was more prominent than I would have liked.  But it was a tasty dish.
