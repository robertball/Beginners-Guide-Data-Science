I used mini marshmallows because that's what I had. These were good, easy and quick to make.

These were delicious! I love  classic s'mores, but these have the added crisp and saltiness from the pretzels! To make these even quicker and easier, I used chocolate syrup in a bottle to drizzle over top!
