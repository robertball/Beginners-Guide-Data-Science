This sauce is certainly yummy. I wanted it a little thicker so I added 1 more teaspoon of cornstarch to a little water and stir in to hot mixture. Another note; the cornstarch should be mixed with water when putting the ingredients together. Otherwise you'll get lumps. I saved the leftover sauce to use with my turkey burgers. Thanks.

It's pretty good. I agree with the lime over the lemon. I also added seafood seasoning to the fish and some fresh garlic minced up.

This was great! The only thing I changed was that I used lime juice instead of lemon as that's what I had on hand. I will be making this again. Delicious :).

This was a simple and great tasting. My wife loves Salmon and I surprised her with this dish. She LOVED it. Definitely will make it again! The only thing I had questions on is the sauce. It says it will "thicken". Mine didn't really get overly thick when I made it. I think next time I will mix the cornstarch in a bowl of cold water before I add it to the mixture. The recipe didn't delineate how it is to be done. just said add.

I had no lemon so I used fresh squeezed orange.  I also added a bit more starch to make sauce thicker.  The salmon came out perfect.  I enjoyed this meal very much and will be making it again.

I had everything on hand which is always a great start! I had to add a little extra cornstarch to get my sauce thick enough. Plenty of sauce to use and put on some rice, quinoa, or whatever side to soak it up. Would make again for my salmon.

Heavens to Betsy is this a tasty recipe! Followed the instructions and loved the end result. We baked our salmon in tin foil packets for easy clean up (yay!).

Lovely! I had a beautiful sockeye filet tonight and decided to try this based on the good reviews. I didn't change a thing outside of the lemon. Like another person, I only had a lime so I had to make do. I don't imagine it would come out much different with a lemon. I will definitely make this again.

Wow!! My husband loved this dish!! I put white rice and a spinach salad with it; viola! My husband thought it was a gourmet dinner. The only thing I changed was the lemon; I didn't have a fresh one so I used bottled. Definitely a simple company dish.

It's truly delicious.  For me the cook time varied a little because (while I don't want my filet dry) i do like it a little more cooked than the recipe says.  So, i just popped it in a few minutes before pouring the sauce and following the recipe ensuing steps.
