I did not use dijon (didn't have any on hand), used only two shallots, used Knorr concentrated broth packets and added frozen broccoli at the end and covered, just long enough to steam the broccoli. 
The flavor was unbelievably savory and the broccoli added was a great way to get my kids to gobble up their veggies.  
*Tip, only brown the pieces of beef quickly on both sides.  It will cook the rest of the way during the steaming of the broccoli.

This was an excellent and quick week night recipe. I added portabella mushrooms to the mixture. Make sure you butter your noodles. Next time I may add some heavy cream to the sauce.

This was really good. I made some changes as follows: Used 2 lbs of sirloin steak, 10 shallots, 1 tub Knorrs beef homestyle stock (couldn't find Swanson). I wanted more sauce so I used 3/4 cup of red wine and 2 tbsp of vinegar, no mustard. After it reduced, I mixed in the Knorrs beef stock. When it was incorporated into the sauce, I added about a 1/2 cup of water to dilute the strong wine/vinegar mixture. I then used cornstarch to thicken at the end. This ended up being a perfect size meal for 4 people. Pretty simple and tasty recipe!

Wondering if anyone else made this and found that there was not enough sauce and the beef was tuff.

I tried adding some fresh mushrooms and broccoli for a complete meal, and was very dissapointed.  No one in my large family liked it.  I think there is too much wine in the sauce as it seemed to overpower everything else.  Also, the Dijon didn't compliment the other flavors.  It was just kind of out there.

I might make this again.  The sauce was good, but not as flavorful as I was expecting or wanting.  If I do make it again, I'm doubling the sauce.

This was very tasty.  I halved the recipe and had to use a concentrated au jus sauce because I didn't have the Flavor Boost.  It came out great.  I like my beef on the rare side, so I only cooked it long enough to brown it, which made it come out just right at the end.  Can't wait to make this again!

I can only rate this 3 stars at the moment. I think the recipe, as written, calls for too much red wine. I couldn't taste the mustard at all. The wine and balsamic overwhelmed it. I'd suggest 1/4 cup wine and perhaps 1-2 teaspoons of balsamic. The meat did come out very tender. I liked it over the noodles. Could not find the Swanson Flavor Boost so used Knorr Homestyle Stock (beef) instead. DON'T USE THIS. It was SO strong it made the dish hard to eat. (my review is not based on this swap, though, it's based on the wine/vinegar taste). Ends up we don't like shallots either, although we're huge onion fans. Will tweak this recipe to fit our tastebuds. :)

I almost didn't add the mustard but it worked out fine. I used onion instead of shallots and added garlic and mushrooms. Served with microwaved baked potatoes and carrots for a quick and easy last minute meal. Had leftover steak in omlettes which was really good.
