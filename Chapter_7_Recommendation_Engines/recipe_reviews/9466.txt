I'll give the recipe 5 stars but I think that the instructions need some clarification. I have a good heavy medium 1 1/2 qt sauce pan that I used to melt the sugar in. I used a 3qt pan for the sugar/heavy cream mixture. I considered a 3qt pan a "large" sauce pan. Not so. When making this, keep in mind that when you add the baking soda, the mixture is going to "bubble up". It's going to bubble up A LOT!!! This bubbled up and OVER the top of my pan and all over the top of my new stove and ran down into the burners. I spent the 20 minute cooling period cleaning up the mess. Once I got it all under control, the candy was good. I would use a pan closer to a dutch oven sized pan next time. Yes, I will make it again, but I'll be a little wiser about it. :)

I thought it was relatively easy to make. WE loved it. My husband said it reminded him of soft, fudgy peanut brittle. I think it tasted like a cross between caramels and fudge. I will make it again! CB

This is traditionally called Aunt Bill's Brown Candy in Oklahoma.  Is super delicious, but hard to make and can go "bad" quickly if not beaten continuously.  Worth a couple of tries to get it right.

Its hard for me to rate this recipe, since I couldn't get past the first step.  The two cups of sugar, in a heavy bottom saucepan (non-stick), on low heat never melted - after an hour, it got hot and turned into brown 'chips', but never melted and it remained on low heat the whole time.

This candy is good & fairly easy to make.  The biggest problem I had was getting the candy out of the pan - I probably didn't use enough butter.  Also, like another reviewer said, use a big pot - I had to move the mixture into a larger pot during cooking.

When I put the melted sugar into the cream and sugar mixture, the melted sugar became one big lump.  Perhaps the other mixture wasn't warm enough.  However, I kept at it stirring until it all smoothed out which took some time.  Good result.

This is a great candy recipe.  My mom got this same recipe out of a newspaper in Massachuesetts.  It was called Oklahoma Brown Candy.  It has become a family tradition at Christmas.  It is my son's, now 20 y.o., favorite.

We loved the flavor of this candy, but I think maybe this recipe isn't quite as clear as it could be.  Stovetop candy recipes are so much about feel and experience that they can be hard to write down!  This only partially set up for us, and the texture was a little grainy.  I think we needed to let the sugar melt more (it does take a long, long time, so be prepared), and I also think we should have made sure the cream was at least at a simmer before we added the caramel (which promptly congealed into a big gooey lump instead of combining).  I would also advise waiting for 30 minutes before you start beating; ours was still pretty liquid at 20.  There's another recipe on this site called Aunt Bill's Brown Candy that I think I'll use next time - same basic ingredients, but more specific directions about some of the procedures involved.  Thanks anyway though!

I grew up in Oklahoma making this with my sisters and our grandfather every holiday.  The only negative thing is you can't stop eating it!!

Some recipes just bring back nice memories. Difficult to be objective and rate only the recipe, when emotions are involved :) Using the wooden spoon  to stir is also a very good idea. If you are tired of looking for one, there is a limited time discount on Amazon for a set of two.

I also couldn't get the sugar to melt by itself for a very long time. Finally gave up and tried adding it to the other mixture just to not entirely waste all the ingredients.

It didn't work. Was very disappointed.

My grandma made this candy every Christmas. Unfortunatly I never got the recipe from her so my children missed this treat while growing up. My grandchildren will be introduced to it this year with stories about my grandma and growing up in Oklahoma. I'm so happy to find this recipe, thank you!! Now I've just got to resist the temptation to gobble it all up before Christmas.
