This is a very tasty beef curry! I made it according to the directions. I had to order the fish sauce online, because my local grocery store doesn't carry it. I served it over jasmine rice that I cooked in a microwave oven.

Fabulous! I used orange pepper instead of zucchini for colour and upped the red curry to 4 tsps and with the coconut milk it was perfect heat.  Loved the lime zest! I used about a half cup more of chicken broth so it was more saucy and put the mixture over vermichelli rice noodles. So good!

I tend to use a lot more of the red curry paste (half a jar)....and I add cornstarch at the end to thicken it up (3 or 4 tablespoons).  I also add yellow squash or broccoli with the zucchini.  

My boyfriend requests this at least once a week.  Its a huge it!  Love, love, love this recipe!!!

Really tasty!  I used venison cube steak because my husband and I are always looking for new ways to cook all of his deer meat.  Also, I left out the fish sauce because it only called for one Tbs and I could not find it in the grocery.

Excellent taste and combination of flavor!  I was skeptical of the cilantro and lime, but it was perfect!  I added red peppers and potato as we don't like zucchini and I can't believe how well it came out!  Will make again!  Thanks Deb!

The engridients compliment each other and the asians mix of flavors marry as an asian dish should. My friend Neelu from india was suprised. she thinks Im the only american lady that can cook indian foods correctly! thank you deb, it was very nice..The lime zest was a bit too much, but for the most part ,you did well.  sincerely, candy wallace

This recipe is great and very straight-forward.  Depending how thick you slice the beef (against the grain of course), it may need less time in the sauce.

Thanks Debola for this recipe.  It was very tasty and zucchini is perfect for this dish.  Like you say, be sure and have everything cut up and ready before starting as this dish comes together rather quickly.

Delicious, quick and uncomplicated dish! I was surprised at how good this was. I made it with out zucchini since I did not have any. Like another reviewer, I used some orange and yellow bell pepper. IMO, it was probably a better choice. I recommend increasing the red curry paste to 1 T. It is the star of the dish and is the basis of the flavors. DO NOT SKIP THE FISH SAUCE. It adds depth and balance. If you cannot find it, substitute some anchovy paste. I did not have any cilantro, but hubs does not care for it anyway. The lime zest at the end, paired with a squeeze of lime juice at serving time adds a beautiful finish. My side was Jasmine rice cooked in the remainder of the chicken broth I used for the curry. Next time I may serve this over cellophane noodles or udon noodles. Thanks Deb!!

We really enjoyed this recipe although I don't think it would taste very good with only 1 tsp of curry paste. I did marinate the meat in red curry paste and minced garlic for 24 hours. We added our own assortment of veggies(peppers, onion, scallions, mushrooms, water chestnuts, and baby corn) and added 2 tbls of curry paste instead of 1 tsp. We made the sauce as directed except for the extra curry paste. We loved the sauce and I think anything would be good in this sauce. Love the way the cilantro adds flavor to the dish. Was very nervous to add it but so glad I tried it as it was fabulous. My children loved it also.

I added more curry paste as suggested and diced onion instead of scallion.  For vegetables, I used assorted peppers, green beans and cauliflower.  I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar.  My only dislike was the lime zest, I will omit the next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for the first time today, and it was really good, but was lacking in spice. Next time I will have to add more spices and red curry paste.
