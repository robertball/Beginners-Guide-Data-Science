I have made this recipe twice.  The first time I made it exactly as written and it was very bland.  I agree with other reviewers who think that it is a starter recipe...it just needs some flavor added to it.  The second time I made this, I added some seasoning and some Italian cheese blend to the dish and my family enjoyed it.

As a recipe starter or for someone just learning to cook, this meal as written is just OK.  I seasoned my chicken quite well, and I used chicken broth I'd made myself from Roast Sticky Chicken from this site--so those ingredients contained a lot of flavor.  I had to use capellini rather than noodles, since that is the only pasta my husband will really eat, and I did use a heavy dose of butter with that.  The Parmesan cheese adds a little more flavor and salt.  It still cried out heavily for more flavor, so I added a few leftover caramelized onions from my fridge.  In the end I had to add some more of my favorite condiments.  I recommend starting out with this recipe but having in mind and handy all the flavorings that you know you love with the ingredients.

As written, this gets three stars. I added in a lot of things. This recipe calls for no seasonings. I am guessing because it is meant to be base and they are assuming that you will add in what you like to suit your own tastes.
I started out by seasoning my chicken breasts with salt, black pepper, thyme, rosemary, and minced garlic. I also cooked the noodles in chicken broth for added flavor and added salt & pepper when I tossed them with the butter and parm. I then followed the recipe as written.
The carrots took 8 minutes, not 5, to heat and cook through. The noodles and carrots were very good - however I don't care for pan cooking chicken breasts this way. They always seem to come out dry. I suggest pounding your chicken flat before cooking it. But if I make this again, I will cook my chicken & carrots with the broth in a slow cooker on low for 6 hours and then place on top of the noodles.

I added salt, pepper and soul seasoning to this and enjoyed it. My sons ate multiple bowls of it, which is why I'm giving it 5 stars. They love chicken but have never been fans of carrots.  In this they loved them!

I love this easy recipe. Perfect for a college student or beginning cook!! I cut up the chicken into bite size pieces and mixed it all together. I also added a little thyme and cayenne pepper.

I did make some changes because the recipe seemed bland.  Fresh garlic. Fresh carrots and celery, which I micro'd 2 mins before putting in pan, and mushrooms. Chicken was moist. But this was more like a flavorful soup. I don't think I would make it again, I would just make soup. Maybe thicken up the liquid to make a gravy to pour over.

This was a really good recipe!  The only changes  I made were that I cubed the chicken instead of having whole breasts and added mashed potatoes, which was a great addition.

I really liked the simplicity of this recipe. However, I salt and peppered the chicken and added garlic. The seasoning helped build more flavor.

It was okay but it needed more herbs. I will try to add more next time, for it won't taste plain. My advice is to play with this recipes.
