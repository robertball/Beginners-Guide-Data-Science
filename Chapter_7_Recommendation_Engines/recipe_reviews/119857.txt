I made a few changes to this recipe.  I mixed a pkg of lipton onion soup mix and 2 cups of water into my cooked ground beef and let it boil for a few minutes then drained the water off.  I then put that into my 8x13 greased baking dish and put  thin layer of cheddar cheese.  Added a layer of mashed potatoes to the top and another lay of cheddar cheese then backed for 15 minutes at 350.  My family LOVED this recipe with the changes I made.  We will definitely try this again and may make a few more adjustments.

this was fairly good although i found it a bit bland. i like that it was similar to a shepherd's pie without having a tomato sauce base - not my favorite thing. if i make it again i would add diced garlic and onion to the beef mixture and perhaps other spices to give it more flavor.

Really simple recipe. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. It tasted really good.

I made this tonight, and it was yummylicious!!  A couple changes I made, based on reviews; I mixed in a pkg of Lipton onion soup mix in with a can cream of mushroom soup, minced a clove of garlic in with the meat while it was browning and it was fantastic!  I used more than 1/2 c of extra sharp chedder cheese, and I baked it @ 375 for 40 minutes.  That gave the top a crispy and lightly browned finish, that made a wonderful contrast to the creamy goodness under it.

I made this for my husband who loves ground beef - I'm a chicken kind of girl, and normally hate ground beef.  But, I actually really liked this!  I did do a few things different!  I followed someone's suggestion to cook the meat with Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix after browning, etc. Also..... when I first read the recipe and it said french style green beans - I thought it said French Onions.  So, I used both.  I mixed the green beans in like it calls for but I also put french onions on the top with the cheese!  My husband and I loved it and so did our 18 month old daugher -so that was impressive!!!  I will for sure make this again! :)

I absolutely love this recipe. I made it for the first time about a year ago and have made it MANY times since. I usually mince up some garlic and onion to thrown in the meat mixture for some added taste and there's rarely any leftovers. My Husband would eat this everyday if I'd let him!

Quick, easy, and delicious! I As suggested by others I did add 1/2 package of onion soup mix and chopped garlic to the hamburger. Topped potatoes with Frizzled Onions (from this site) and velveeta cheese.

I cooked this for Thanksgiving and we loved it!  I browned the meat with onion soup mix as well as chopped sauteed onions and Cream of Chicken Soup (my boyfriend doesn't like mushrooms) and it turned out great!  The ground beef in the green bean mixture really put a nice twist on the regular Green Bean Casserole recipe.  I also added French fried Onions to the top before baking as well.  I am new at cooking and I will definitely make this again!

I had some leftover mashed potatoes and found this recipe in the search. I didn't have any hamburger but was looking for a side dish anyway. I used 2 cans drained green beans in place of the frozen and did everything else the same. After I topped with cheese I added about 1/2 can of Frenches fried onions. It tasted like a green bean casserole with mashed potatoes and cheese. I think I will try it again without the onions.

Just got done hogging down a plateful of this.  It's really good!  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef because of personal preference.  Since ground turkey can be a little bland, I seasoned it with adobo, cumin, and cayenne before mixing in the cream of chicken soup and beans.  Also, had to use canned green beans because I didn't have any frozen.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was a little bland and once my kids saw green beans they didn't care for it.  But they ended up liking it after they added a little cajun seasoning.  My husband and I enjoyed it very much!

A really good dish! As suggested by other reviewers, I added some onion, garlic, cayenne pepper, and even a squirt of ketchup. It was a great meal during the cold winter. My only warning would be to not add too much cheese to the top. Too much of it can really overpower the meal and make a weird texture when it is reheated.

Very good!  I did make a few changes as suggested by a few reviews.  I added one packet of Lipton Dry Onion Soup Mix along with some chopped garlic to the hamburger.  I also used 1 cup string beans & 1 cup corn.  I tripled the cheese (my fam loves it!) and threw on some French's Fried Onions on top.  Delicious!

It was delicious and so easy!  I added about a tablespoon of some Indian spicy BBQ powder to the ground beef while cooking which gave it a bit of a nice kick.

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe!  Although I used onion gravy mix instead of the cream of mushroom.  I thought it gave it more of a flavor.  I also added some of the crunchy onions to the top for the last 5 mninutes.

Used this dish last night for our Cub Scout Blue and Gold Dinner and it was a hit. I did some modifications to the recipe like adding a pack of Lipton's onion soup and 2 cups of water after browning the meat. Let that cook together for a few minutes and then drain liquid. Then I continued with recipe but used canned green beens instead of frozen.

Even with my attempt to jazz up this dish, it was still on the bland side.  I combined a number of others' recommendations, such as adding onion and garlic to the meat, adding an extra layer of cheese and sprinkling in some french fried onions.  Oh well!

This was a staple in my house growing up, but sans green beans.  I sometimes include them and sometimes leave them out if I'm feeling particularly naughty. (What can I say? Not a big fan of vegetables in general.) Like others have mentioned, you'll probably want to spice up the beef a bit.  I use minced garlic and cayenne pepper and sometimes chopped onion.  I like serving this with baked beans if not using the green beans.  Eating a spoonful of baked beans along with the meat and potato pie is a great combination of tastes.

I made this recipe just as written, except for using 1 can of French style green beans instead of frozen. Hubby and I thought it was okay. I'm not sure if I will make it again...maybe if I have left over mashed potatoes to use up.

This is total comfy food and so perfect when you've got left over mashed potatoes altho for a dish like this, a good brand of instant would work just fine. I added my usual garlic and onion powders and used ground turkey. Next time I'm going to use taco seasoning in the meat and pepper jack cheese for a different twist. Thanks so much for posting a quick and easy week night meal!

This was OK. Nothing spectacular. I did use cream of mushroom soup because we like it better. I think this is one of those dishes that you make when you thawed some ground meat and don't know what else to make. I'll save this recipe for one of those days.

Followed recipe pretty closely except used 1 can of cut green beans and 1 can of corn for the vegetables.  Seasoned my ground beef with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder and all-purpose seasoning. Would make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and quick dinner. I prepared it ahead of time and then we went for a motorcycle ride and when we came home, I popped it in the oven, and yummy! Thanks!

Very good recipe.  We don't eat meat so I left it out. I also used the Cream Soup Base recipe from this website and sprinkled some french fried onions on top.  This recipe would also be good using broccoli with the soup or with a cheese sauce.

I make this at least once a month. It's easy, flavorful, and cheap! This is one of my husbands favorite "comfort" dishes. I've used frozen peas, carrots, and even mixed veggies if I did not have frozen green beans on hand, and it was delicious all the same!

This was really good, an really easy! Perfect comfort food for a cold, rainy night. The cream of chicken soup added a nice flavor to it, i'm glad I used it instead of subbing cream of mushroom soup. Like most recipes, I seasoned according to my family's taste (s&p, onion, garlic powder, and some Italian seasoning). Although I made homemade mashed potatoes, I think it would taste just a good with instant to save time. I'll definately be making this again. I'm willing to bet this will also be a recipe that tastes even better the next day!

Threw this together a few days ago for dinner while I was finishing up the holiday baking.  Used 2 cans green beans instead of frozen, instant mashed potatoes and stirred plain french fried onions into the meat mixture, then topped with cheddar fried onions rather than cheese (had partial cans left from Thanksgiving).  This was really good and filling.  Had more flavor than I thought it was going to, and husband agreed we should make this on a semi-regular basis since it's quick, easy, filling, and most importantly, it tastes pretty good.

This was easy but just OK in terms of taste. It was strange at first and then you got used to it the more you ate it! I think it was the frozen green beans? Might be better with a cream of mushroom or celery soup. Cream of chicken & hamburger is just odd to me. Not sure that I would make it again.

This recipe was so easy and tasted so good! Only change I made was I used one can cream of chicken soup and one cream of celery because that was all I had. I did add a couple spoonfuls of sour cream to the potatoes. Will make this one again! Thanks for the great recipe.

This was great.  My picky husband is a meat and potato guy and he loved this.  It was very quick and easy.  Definitley will make it again.
