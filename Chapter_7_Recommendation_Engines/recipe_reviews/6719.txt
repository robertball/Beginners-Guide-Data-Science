I made this just before Christmas, froze the two loaves, and just took them out now.  I really like this recipe, as it is a good moist bread.

I had a small bit of pineapple juice leftover from another recipe and used it for part of the milk.  I also used reconstituted dried cherries instead of maraschino cherries.  I did not sift the flour.  I baked the loaves in 4 small foil loaf pans which worked fine.  The bread seems a little dry to me but is tasty.  I don't know if I'd ever make it again but I'm happy I tried this recipe.  Thanks.
