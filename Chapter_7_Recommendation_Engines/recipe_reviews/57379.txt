Very easy to make and taste good.  I'd make just a quick modification in making them next time though.

Instead of pouring the candy over the pretzels, next time I'm going to try dumping the pretzels in the candy then spreading them out on the baking sheet.  It was hard to get them evenly coated quick enough for the candy not to set.  Once they're in the oven, you do have a chance to fix some mistakes when you stir them, but it definitely firms up quickly.

I think I took my candy a few degrees too far, but they turned out nice and salty sweet.  I made half a batch and it more than filled a cookie sheet, so if you make the full batch you might want to prepare two sheets for your pretzels.

These are a little too gooey. Too much coating for my one pound of pretzels (maybe even too much for the called for 20 ounces). I would also us salted instead of unsalted butter. Not sure if I would make these again.

Great and much easier than I expected. The coating didn't get hard very fast so it was easy to stir. They did turn out sugary rather than glossy but were delicious. Can't beat sugar and salt.

We added cinnamon to ours (yum!) and mixed the pretzels with the coating in a bowl first and then put them on the baking sheet for better coverage. We did have to bake them about 10 minutes longer. Loved the idea. We will definitely make them again. Thanks for the recipe. The coating reminded my family of my homemade caramels.

Definitely my favourite recipe.  I make it every time guests come over and have actually become known for this dessert! So glad to have come across it.

I used double the amount of pretzels.   Omitted salt. Used salted butter.  Soft ball stage on candy thermometer.
