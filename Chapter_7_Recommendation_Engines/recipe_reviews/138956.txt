This is the best mornay Sauce I've ever eaten! I tried it over chicken cordon bleu as suggested and it was awesome! Even the kids loved it. I also tried it on fresh string beans. I will be making this very easy but tasty cheese sauce many times!

I am  always cooking the same thing everything night. So when I tried this recipe to spice up my chicken, my family was so excited!! This sauce is delicious! I made it with chicken and even tried it with hamburgers. On an evening with my friends, I made it as a dipping sauce with vegetables. What a hit!!!

Wow, this was great.  I stuffed some mushrooms with wild and white rice, onions, garlic and parsley, added a little of this sauce to the mixture.  I stuffed the mushrooms and placed in a cassarole dish and poured the remaining sauce over them and topped with some more swiss and parm cheese.  Baked at 350 for about 25 min.....yummmy

This is a pretty good recipe that I make with homemade chicken cordon bleu. I omit the green onions and also give it a good sized splash of dry white wine because we like the depth of flavor it adds.

I never even knew what mornay sauce was until I stumbled across this recipe. I'm not a big fan of swiss cheese, but it sounded like it would go perfectly with the veal chops I was going to cook, and my suspicions were correct. I followed everything in this recipe, and my sauce came out a bit too thick and grainy, but no one made any complaints. I think I may end up cutting the Parmesan down to 3oz next time, as I suspect that the Parm is my culprit for the grainy texture because I may have been a bit over 4oz. I ended up adding about 1/3 cup of milk to try and thin the sauce out a bit, but with all that cheese it would have taken more to get it the consistency I wanted. I even cooked the roux longer to ensure it wouldn't thicken the sauce to a molasses like consistency with all that cheese, but no luck. It may sound like complaints, but I have nothing to really judge my sauce off of, as I don't often eat french cuisine. Despite this batches shortcomings, I'll be using this sauce again and again.

Made this sauce yesterday.  I didn't think I would like it because I don't like swiss cheese, but my hubby does.  We both LOVED this sause.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Will make again often!

This was easy and just incredible!  Served it over medium shell pasta with grilled salmon and broccoli.  It was so good, everyone coated the whole meal with this sauce!

we loved this recipe!  the only bad thing is that after it starts to cool on your supper plate, it starts to get grainy.  but that is not the fault of the recipe, it's just the way parm cheese can be sometime.  especially if you aren't using really good quality parm.  we ate this over grilled (garlic/herb) chicken breasts and penne pasta.  SO GOOD!  I used extra green onion, b/c we love green onions!  yum-yum!!!

This was Sooooooo good. I made it with mushroom filled ravioli. I did'nt have parsely so I left that out. I also thought it was a little bit to much green onion so I cut that to half. It was great! My husband and I went on a date a few years back (a very fancy expensive resturant)and had something very close to this. We loved it so much. Thanks for helping me re-create that special day. Next time i think i will try toasting the ravioli then pour the sauce over that.

My husband made this and it is the best I have ever eaten.  He made the Chicken and Cheese Stuffed Jumbo Shells from this site and used this sauce to bake instead of the tomato called for in that recipe.  I cannot express how rich and cheesy they were--I crave this stuff!

Haven't tried this yet. But sounds good. I just found a great KY Hot Brown bake I'd like to try this with.
