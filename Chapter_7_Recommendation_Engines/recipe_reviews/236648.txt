I'm dieting so I used a spray or two of canola pan spray instead of the butter, skim milk, doubled the cinnamon and sugar, but used Splenda instead, chopped up half a banana into the mixture, and used 100% whole wheat bread, 50 calories a slice. An extra sprinkle of cinnamon and Splenda before microwaving made a sweet crunch on top. This gives you around 250 calories, so you could add juice or a smoothy as well. There's also lots of for room to experiment with other spices and mix in's. I liked the addition of fresh fruit, but nuts, chips, or dried fruits with other spice combos would work too. Just a cup and spoon to wash when you are done!

The whole purpose of anything you cook in a mug in the microwave is to make eating quick and easy. This recipe does that with a few easy-to-remember ingredients that cook up just fine in the microwave. The cinnamon is perfect for me, but if I were to fix this again, I would add a little more sugar. Like another reviewer, I stirred the bread into the liquid. Seems as though it would set better if all cubes were slightly moist. Most mug recipes are for eating quickly or on-the-go, but this morning I wanted to treat myself, so I turned my French toast cup out onto a pretty tea and toast set and slowly enjoyed my breakfast.

It was quick and tasty. My 15 mo old liked it too. I made just as stated, but I stirred the bread around instead of just pressing it into the egg mixture; wanted to make sure it all got coated. It took 90 seconds exactly in my microwave. I poured some real maple syrup on top, and it tasted somewhat like french toast. I'll make it again sometime. *update- I've made this a few times now, and I leave out the butter and just use cooking spray in the mug, and I leave out the sugar. Comes out perfect. So quick, just pour some syrup on top and eat it straight from the mug.

I made this with two end slices of whole wheat bread and it hit the spot! I was in the mood for something sweet but didn't want to get the pan out. I added some walnuts and chocolate chips between the two ripped up slices of bread and I think the added crunch from the nuts helped a lot. I doubled the sugar and actually dumped it out of the cup onto a plate to eat...doing that I found the egg was still quite runny at the bottom, so I microwaved it on the plate for another 30 seconds. All in all, a nice easy way to have french toast without too much hassle!

It was pretty tasty, though towards the bottom of the cup it was a bit soggy. It might of been because i used whole wheat bread, but it was still good. I mixed in the bread like some others did, but I think that just made it into a bowl of mush... I'll tweak the recipe next time I make it: probably add more bread and won't mix it as much.

Yummy and easy! 

I put in extra sugar and left out the cinnamon and vanilla. (With real maple syrup on top, who needs those?)

Next time I'm gonna try throwing in some bacon :) 

Thank you!

I used this recipe as a base and instead of cinnamon I used chocolate chips. Turned out good, but I should have mixed it more probably. Helpful recipe!

I used a small baking dish instead of a mug and sprinkled confectioners sugar on top. My new favorite breakfast.

We all loved it... a rarity in my house. To make things easier I sprayed the mug with cooking spray and replaced the milk, cinnamon, sugar and vanilla with flavored coffee creamer. Yum!

Loved it! The only difference I did was add a pinch more of cinnamon and sugar and added some sliced walnuts and a little bit of semisweet chocolate chips. I tune topped it off with some syrup. Very tasty! I did read reviews beforehand and added a third slice of bread to reduce the sogginess. I highly suggest this!

Pretty tasty. I didn't use butter but cooking spray & whole wheat bread (1 end piece & 1 middle). If you keep in mind that the bread is going to be absorbing all the ingredients which will make it a little soggier than normal french toast. Perhaps add more bread or denser bread? I would make it again.

I followed directions and mixed it a little and came out soggy so I decided to cook it a little more added maple syrup and did not like it.

I used more sugar than the recipe called for and added syrup before eating it. It was pretty good, just a tad soggy. Maybe adding another piece of bread would help.

Came out really flavorless and it could probably use a lot more cinnamon and sugar. Was also a little bit too soggy for my taste.

Tasted bland; I think it needs a pinch of salt.  I'll add it to the milk-egg mixture next time to see if it helps.  Otherwise, it was ok.

This turned out delicious! Made exactly as recipe states. Definitely going to make again..maybe with raisin bread!
