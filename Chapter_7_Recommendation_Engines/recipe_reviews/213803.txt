Exactly what I was looking for! I had whole fried tilapia in an Asian restaurant once and was sure that there was something trickier than just frying it; but no there isn't! I used canola to health up the frying and fried until super crispy 10-12 min. I was in a hurry so I didn't make paste but used Asian Rooster sauce and premade garlic-chili oil. The fish is sooo much more tender this way! THANK YOU!

Much better grilled and just as "stunning at the dinner table".  Fried.... Very Unhealthy. Sauce is tasty, tasty.

The fish was delicious and crispy.  Make sure you ease back on the soy sauce if you are using regular instead of light.

I used croaker instead of tilapia and added oyster and Asian chili sauce to kick up the flavor.  Great taste!
