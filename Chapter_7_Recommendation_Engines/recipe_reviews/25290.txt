I made this for a womans potluck we have every month. It was the hit! Everyone, even the kids loved this! I will definatly make this recipe for weeknight dinners too. This is so easy and so tasty! I added a little garlic salt to this. It turned out so good!

My family liked this... I assume it's a full package of frozen spinach, not 1/3 cup????? I used one small box of spinach.  Added a touch of garlic powder, and threw a couple of layers of phyllo with olive oil on top just to entice the kids.

This recipe was very easy to make.  But we didn't like the texture and it had a bland taste to me.

I needed a new recipe to take to work for our Thanksgiving lunch. It was very easy to make and "everyone loved it". I had to give out the recipe over and over. I loved it. Will definately make it again.

Very easy to make & tasted great.  Since I don't care for swiss cheese I used a shredded 4-cheese combination.  I wouldn't call it cheese "squares" however - when I cut it in squares & removed from dish it was more like a casserole.

Not a bad starting point, but this would be incredibly bland as written. I added salt and freshly-ground pepper, garlic powder, half Swiss/half extra-sharp Cheddar cheese, and I used fresh spinach instead of frozen. There's definitely a lot of room for experimentation.
