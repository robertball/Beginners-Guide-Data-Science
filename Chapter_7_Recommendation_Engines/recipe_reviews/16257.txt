I use frozen veggies (no cooking or thawing ahead of time) instead of canned and use a red bell pepper and purple onion for more color.  I love this on hot summer days.

I love this salad.  I make it just as written.  The sauce is meant to be a MARINADE not a dressing!  Good grief people!  I serve it with a slotted spoon and it's the perfect addition to a summer barbeque.

This salad is delicious, but made too much dressing for me.  Next time I will only make 1/2
as much dressing

This was way too SWEET for us.  My husband couldn't even eat it.  I tried to salvage the dish by adding more white wine vinegar.  When I tried it the next day, it was a little better but I wouldn't bother making it again.

I have been looking for this recipe or one similar since my mother-n-law died. She made this from memory so it wasn't in her recipe stash. The only difference is she used apple cider vinegar.

This recipe gets 5 stars with my changes; omitted bell pepper and substituted chopped water chestnuts for celery.  Our dinner guests raved about it asking for the recipe.  This salad is really better in a day or two.  It does make a lot of dressing but it's great sopped up with some good sour dough bread!  I'll be making this in place of my usual 3 bean salad.  Thanks.

Love this type of salad ... you can make a little or make a lot - depending on what the need is for.  It's refreshing for summer get togethers.

I love this salad! I accidentally used regular white vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar and it turned out great. I also subbed Splenda for the sugar.

Have made this for years and had lost the recipe.  We used APPLE CIDER vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and cut the sugar by about half.

I love this salad...Made it today for the Thanksgiving Dinner at the clubhouse...Just before bringing it over there, I chopped up some leafy green Romaine lettuce, put it in a crystal bowl then put about 3/4ths of this salad on top of the lettuce, lightly mixed it up so that it soaked up some of the dressing and it was a huge hit... :)

Here are a couple tips. Leave out green beans. They don't add anything to this dish. I used 3/4 the amount of sugar - you might get away with half if you are watching the calories. Most importantly - wait. Wait 48 hrs minimum for the marinade to set. 24 hours is not enough. The salad is still fresh tasting after 4 or 5 days so just wait a couple of days before eating.

Made this salad for a bbq and my family loved it. The reviews were right about the sauce, it was a little much. I won't add all of it next time when I make it. It was so good. Definitely a keeper ??

I have made this numerous time for family gatherings and covered dish dinners. I use Splenda instead of sugar quite often. I use apple cider vinegar most of the time. I also use yellow and red bell pepper to make it more colorful.

This is a perfect salad to take to a "carry in". There is nothing to worry about if it is a hot day.  I've had many requests for the recipe so I know I'm not the only one who thinks it is keeper.

I don’t often feel the need to go on any site and rate a recipe BUT this recipe was FREAKING AMAZING!!! So lookout here I am giving it a 5 star review. There were things I did differently some because I had no other option and some because I well just dang wanted to. Haha. To begin with our store did not have any celery. I had to use an English cucumber in replace of the missing celery. The same went with the shoe peg corn. Even though our store had the corn they did not have the amount called for. All they had were 11 ounce cans. Knowing that my husband and I love corn I just threw both darn cans in! My husband recently had weight loss surgery (actually it was one year ago February and he has lost a whopping 175 POUNDS!!!) and plain sugar isn’t healthy for him or me for that matter so I used Splenda instead. The last thing I did differently is I did not mix my required ingredients and mix them on a stovetop. Listen it is hot as all get out here in Oklahoma and I was NOT going to crank on our stove!!! I just mixed my required ingredients in a microwave safe glass bowl and nuked it for one minute and forty five minutes. Hey it worked great don’t knock it. Anyway this recipe like I said is AMAZING and will now become my go to dish for any upcoming family get togethers.

This is a great recipe but i don't like the green beans.  I leave them out.  The texture doesn't fit with the rest of the vegetables and doesn't add a needed flavor. You can also cut down the oil used by half.

I have been making a salad like this for years and prefer equal parts sugar, vinegar and oil (1/2 cup each).  Also reduced the salt to a half teaspoon.

Have made this at least 3 times.  Last time I used French style green beans. Think I like them better.  Took to my club mtg. last night and most of it was gone!!  Had one ask for the recipe!

My mother used to make this salad! I was so excited to find the recipe! I  used less sugar. You can use the microwave to heat up the dressing. I also used diced orange bell pepper instead of pimento. It is easy and fast to put together. Make sure to marinate overnight!

Great salad especially for summer because it has nothing that would spoil or go bad if not kept cold. No dairy.

I’ll certainly make it again and I didn’t change a thing. I did drain the salad before using it so it wasn’t messy or drippy. At first everyone thought it was a bean salad and I kept correcting them. Once they tried it - poof it was gone!

The saucepan ingredients are used to MARINATE the veggies, peas, whatever you put in it. I had a recipe that directed a draining of the marinate through a colander or something that separates  the marinate from the veggies. I personally prefer draining away the marinate. The flavor and enough of the marinate remains with the veggies. 
      I used Splenda instead of sugar and used 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup. I have used white wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar and white vinegar. I like them all and I use what I have, sometimes mixing one with the other to get the measurement needed.

A church family member of ours made this for a covered dish luncheon last Sunday...and let me tell you, I waited through the entire luncheon while keeping my eyes on the dish just to find out who made it and just had to get the recipe. It was such a great salad. The only change she made was instead of using the white sugar, she used a sugar substitute called Swerve in case you have diabetes or are watching the extra sugar intakes. 
Either way I loved this salad and I think it should be served at every get together and church luncheon on God's green earth.

Tasty & delicious! Quite refreshing! I took this dish to an outdoor picnic where food safety was a big concern. Several compliments on this dish too! Thank you.

This is excellent we did not have time to stay in the fridge for 24 hours. I guess maybe 1 hour. But it was delicious anyway tomorrow it will be out of this world.

I had this at a luncheon today and I had to get the recipe.  What a wonderful salad for summer, so light and refreshing.  I will make this on pot luck day and take it to work.

This is an old recipe that I've been making for years.   It's sweet and just the right amount of crunch.  plus you can add or subtract ingredients to your own palate.   Super for meals with lots of people.

As written 4.5 stars (too sweet and a little mushy for me). I cut sugar to 3/4 cup, used 15oz bags of frozen corn, frozen beans and frozen peas and added 1/2 cup red bell pepper for color. 5 stars with adjustments. Great recipe

My mom made this salad for every church potluck. It's one of my all time favorites! I use shoepeg corn, LuSeuer  sweet peas and french-cut green beans. Never made it with oil though, I don't see the need.  Serve with a slotted spoon.

Love the combo of veggies, but agree with other reviewers. Maybe 1/2 the sugar would be more to my liking.

If you find the dressing to sweet try using apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. It gives it a little tang.SCD
