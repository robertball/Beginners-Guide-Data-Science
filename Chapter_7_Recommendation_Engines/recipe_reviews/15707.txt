Made it twice, the first time as written.  Yuck-- why tolerate the health hazards of hydrogenated fats? Second time, made it with butter (as pound cakes were originally made) and of course skipped the butter flavoring.  Ahhh... much better!  So one star as written, but 4 stars with my alteration.

This was yummy!  Very quick and was it moist!  Tastes best when warm. It has become one of the desserts of choice at our weekly barbecues.

I cut this recipe in half to try it out. The cake fell after I removed it from the oven, but was still very tasty. I used butter-flavored shortening since I didn't have the butter flavoring. It was very moist and tasty. My husband gave this two thumbs up.

Unfortunately my rating is low and do not often do this but suggest that butter is used.   Otherwise this cake tends to have little flavor and dry out too quickly.    It certaily warrants 5 stars with butter and I am adding it to my files.

This is a very nice cake, great with ice cream while it's still warm.  I didn't want to make a trip to the store, so I used sour cream instead of buttermilk and I only had 1/2 cup of shortening, so I used it and added 1/2 cup of butter.  It turned out great.  Maybe I cooked it a little too long, 1 1/2 hours was a bit much for my oven, but the recipe will work great when I use it again with a shorter cooking time.

I really liked this cake.  I was looking for something to make to use up the buttermilk I had and tried this.  I made it for supper when my extended family was comming over.  I did not find it dry at all as other reviewers had stated.  I even made it the night before.  I kept it in my cake caddy and it was still nice and moist when I was ready to serve it.  I heated it up  and served it with vanilla ice cream.  It was really yummy.  My sister asked for the recipe because her boyfriend liked it so much. I think that next time I make it I may try pouring a chocolate glaze of some kind over it or making cupcakes with it.  I will be making this again really soon.

I made this with butter instead of shortening and omitted the butter extract.  I also don't buy buttermilk and always substitute with home-made - (1 tbsp fresh lemon juice and 1 cup of milk, stir and let stand 5 min before adding).  I also used 1/2 semi-sweet & 1/2 milk chocolate chips as my hubby like things very sweet. He loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great cake!  I used chocolate chips and when served warm, it tastes excellent.  As it aged, the cake staled a bit but when fresh it was perfect!  Plan to make again.

Didn't turn out in comparison to other pound cakes I've made.  Flavor was okay but tasted more like a yellow cake than it did a pound cake.  Also, and most disappointing, the chips sank to the bottom of the pan leaving a gooey, sticky mess.  The batter seemed fine so I don't know how this happened.   I will stick to my old recipies.
