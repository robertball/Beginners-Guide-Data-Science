This recipe is great! The only modification I made was using a lemon cake mix because my husband likes his lemon cake lemony!!  In my oven 20 minutes was perfect. The cupcakes were very light and moist and the icing was just right too!

I made these and they came out perfect. If you let the eggs come to room temperature, it will make a huge difference to the recipe. I did a lemon filling and it was even better with a layer of rasberry seedless jam and it was the best.

These are seriously some of the best cupcakes and best frosting we have ever had.  And they came out looking fantastic!  The frosting is perfect for piping, holding its shape just great.  I could not have been happier with this recipe and will for sure be making it again!

The sponge was great. The icing however left little to be desired.

These cupcakes are amazing.  They were light and fluffy.  The only change I made was I didn't us as much icing sugar.  I cut it down to 3 cups as I didn't think it needed the extra icing sugar.  They were a big hit!

I have made these several times, both as cupcakes and 9 inch rounds and they have been a huge hit every time. I especially love the icing, I spread the leftover on graham crackers and it is delicious!

My mom bought the ingredients. She couldn't find lemon pudding, so we swapped and did vanilla pudding with lemon cake. Yield was 24 regular cupcakes. Perfect frosting with fresh squeezed lemon. Cook time 23 minutes. Prep was easy. Frosting held up so well. Awesome.

Good flavor exactly as written.  Not fantastic, but really good.  Only "change" I made was to add a little zest to the frosting and a little more to decorate on top.  Made mini-cupcakes.  (Recipe made 36 minis;  baked for 12-13 minutes in case anyone is interested.)

These taste great, however the cook time is WAY off!  First of all, I only got 12 small cupcakes out of this, not 24.  If the recipe is for mini cupcakes, it should say so.  Secondly, it only made 12 but they were all burnt at the bottom after 21 minutes cook time. I will definitely make these again as they are so easy and have a good flavor, but I'm definitely changing the cook time.

Delicious! I have made these several times now... the last time adding a few sprinkles of raw sugar on top of the frosting. The little bit of crunch was just the icing on the cake... so to speak. :)

These cupcakes were wonderful. However it made more than a dozen, but that was actually a good thing! I added some lemon zest to the batter and used can cream cheese frosting that I flavored with some lemon zest and lemon juice, thicken it with a little powdered sugar. My family loved it!

I used a lemon cake mix, and I added a little extra salted butter and some lemon zest to the frosting.  I will make it again.  Using all egg whites makes these very light and fluffy.

Amazing lemon flavor with a few adjustments.  I substituted the white cake for lemon cake mix and I added 1 tablespoon lemon juice.  I also used room temperature egg whites.  These cupcakes baked perfectly after 20 minutes.  For the frosting, I followed the directions but added a splash of vanilla.  I severed these cupcakes chilled and my family absolutely LOVED them.

I used lemon cake mix instead of white and made 18 rather than 24 cupcakes. I ended up with twice as much frosting as I needed, that part of the recipe could be halved.  Everyone who tried them loved them!

Very yummy! I made changes because I've never been good at following directions (subbed buttermilk for half the liquid and added a squeeze of lemon juice).  I also made a batch with lemon cake mix and a lemon buttercream frosting for my non-cream cheese loving friends (as crazy as that is). Both received great reviews. Not quite as good as the cakes from scratch, but pretty close and much easier!

I am not a cake fan, and I don't usually cook with boxed mixes, but everyone I've made these for has raved about how good they are. You could vary the flavor by using different cake mix/pudding combinations.

I thought the cake was too dry and the icing was too rich. A little bit of the icing goes a long way, the flavor wasn't anything to write home about. My family loved them.

I LOVE these cupcakes!  The flavor is so bright and refreshing and the cupcakes are moist.

These are one of my favorite spring/summer treats to take to gatherings because they aren't your typical cupcakes

Occasionally I use Neufchatel instead of cream cheese to cut the calories just a tad

These cupcakes were a little time consuming, but delicious. I would suggest baking them for only 21 or 22 minutes, not the full twenty-five. I put a knife in the middle to check it, but the cupcakes seemed like they needed to bake longer when they were in fact done. I think this has to do with the pudding being added, but I am not sure. This was the first time I made a cake with pudding mix. Other than that they were wonderful. I think next time I will add the lemon zest to the cake mix for a little extra lemon flavor.

Easy to make and very tasty with a little something extra. Made it for a group picnic take and went over very well. I used a lemon cake mix and sprinkled some extra lemon zest to the top along with a candied lemon gummy wedge.

Great recipe.  All my co workers loved them,  I made larger cupcakes and adjusted the cooking time of course.  Great flavor and very moist.  Winner

These were wonderful.  Made them for my daughter's bridal shower and everyone raved about them.  One recipe made over 50 mini cupcakes.  I followed the recipe and did not change a thing.  I felt the lemon flavor really came through after the cupcakes sat . (Taste tested a cupcake prior to the shower and then had one at the shower - lemon flavor was definitely stronger.)
