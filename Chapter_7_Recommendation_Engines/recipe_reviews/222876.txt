Needed my oven for other sides for Christmas, so I thought I would try a slow cooker Pinic Ham for my Christmas Ham, wasn't so sure on this but tried it anyway.  This was so easy only three ingredients.  I will never cook another pinic ham any other way....my family agrees :). probably will never cook another spiral precooked ham ever again either. PS: used a slow cooker with a temp probe which worked well, set the cooker for a 10 1/2 lb ham to reach 160 as this recipe stated, the packaged ham said to reach 145 degree, probably should have split that temp degree but still this is a 5 star recipe.

Made this recipe just today.  It was a hit with my entire family.  Can't imagine why I would ever cook another ham, any other way.

Since I totally HATE chai (yes I know, the rest of the world loves it), I left the chai latte out and simply added a little water and a little ground cloves in it's place. Truly amazing! I think the brown sugar/pineapple taste become more incorporated into the ham as compared with the traditional baked method. Outstanding the next day for sandwiches too

A delicious recipe; quick and simple!
We cooked this a couple days ago and it was amazing!
We used the left-overs to make fried rice.
The ham and pineapple made the rice have a Hawaiian taste.:0)

I made this the other night.  I have got to say, it was one of the best things that have come out of my crockpot.   I was unsure about the Chai tea latte conc., because it smelled sooo sweet and spicy....but it was great.  It also made the house smell like fall.  The taste was wonderful, the sauce with the pineapple was wonderful....the kids love it.

Made this for Easter, loved that it was fix it and forget. Used only about 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar and it turned out fantastic.  Love the glaze, thickened it on the stove with some corn starch.  Everyone gave it high marks around my table.  Didn't even know that Tazo had a Chai concentrate before this!  I used the Decaf.

WAY too sweet. Between the chai tea and the pound of brown sugar, the sweetness was overwhelming.  I doubt if I will try this again, but if I did, I would halve the brown sugar.  I had a 9 lb. ham too.

Extremely easy, moist and delicious while freeing up the oven for other Easter dinner dishes.
Will definitely make again.

It sounds weird to add chai latte in but trust me it keeps the ham very moist.  I was also a bit worry with adding do much brown sugar in the slow cooker but the ham came out just right, not too salty nor too sweet.  My guest who are picky eater enjoy it too:)

I really don't know why anyone would ever want to cook a ham any other way.   This is incredibly easy and outstanding.   I've already made this 5 times and just started another cooking this morning.   I'm so happy I think I will smooch the chef.

This ham gets rave reviews every time I make it.  I use a 7 pound whole ham and cut the brown sugar down to 2/3 of a  bag.  The combination of sugar, pineapple and chai tea gives this ham a great flavor.

I loved the flavor this had! I was a little hesitant about the chai concentrate,  but it added a good spiciness to the sweet. I believe I made a mistake with the meat, though. I couldn't find anything labled picnic ham, and after researching on my phone mid-grocery, it seemed like it was just a pork shoulder. I'm going to try this again with an actual smoked ham, I think the flavor should be fantastic, but it was delicious as a roast. Just make sure you add 3-4 hours for the cooking time if you try it my way.

I made this for Easter Dinner. Everyone LOVED it! This is such an easy, delicious way to make ham for a group of people and it frees up the oven! I paired this with a pineapple stuffing and it was wonderful!

This was very good! I would have never thought to use chai to make a ham, but it makes sense as the spices are perfect!  The only reason I'm rating this 4 stars is because the amount of sugar, even if made in the slow cooker, would be way to sweet to us (used a 6lb ham). I had a chai tea mix so instead of making or buying my own concentrate, I followed another reviewers tip to add the mix to the pineapple juice. I baked this in the oven  and ended up using 2 cups pineapple juice, 2 tbsp chai tea mix (my brand said 1 tbsp p/1 cup liquid), and used 1/2 cup brown sugar. Baked at 325 with about 1 cup water in bottom of pan until internal temp reached 135F (let rest and it came up to 140F). This is one of the best hams I've ever had and next time will try it in a slow cooker! Thanks for the recipe!

It was great. Used less brown sugar and substituted a little chicken broth. Turned out very well and less sweet.

My favorite ham recipe!  Used a full cup of Chai. No other changes. Make sure to cook on low so it doesn't dry out.

At first I was skeptical with such little ingredients so I made it and brought it over to my friend's family and told them they were my test subjects.  To everyone's surprise it turned out amazing and definitely the only way to cook ham now!  Slight changes are I used 2 cups of light brown sugar not packed, 1 can of crushed pineapple and omitted the chai tea latte. I also  reduced the cooking time to 5 hours instead.

Picnic ham is my all time favorite but for some reason I can't always find it in my area. However, I do have one in my freezer at present and have been contemplating fixing it in my slow cooker so coming across this recipe is perfect timing! I have never had Chai tea so am not sure what to expect but live and learn!  ;)  Thanks for the recipe!

I forgot the tea extract, but used a habanero jam w/ the pineapple instead. Put in my slow cooker on low for about 7 hours (came out slightly over cooked, but I had errands to run). Really good sweet, caramel, and smokey flavor (think that might be the ham itself).  Simple and easy, carved it up, and threw the rest in food saver bags for easy freezer meals!

So good and easy!  I've made this several times and it's always good.  The time posted may be for a raw ham, I used smoked bone in hams and 3-4 hours on low is plenty.

We made this for a normal week night dinner,  and the entire family called it a success. We ended up using a larger ham (9lbs) and cooked for 8 hours. While the ham doesn't end up with the crusty outside, it falls apart and is incredibly tasty. One person found it a little salty without the sauce, but after adding that it was perfect for them. We'd definitely do this again.

This is so easy and the ham comes out so moist and flavorful.  I mix the pineapple with the chai mix and pour it over the ham.  A great recipe - thank you!
