I made this without the annatto powder. Okay, so I found this recipe to take a while to make and use a lot of dishes. I also found that it needed LOTS more salt, so I added a few pinches of salt and about triple the fish sauce. Also, my rice burned on me so next time I will reduce to a very low heat after it boils. Lastly, this recipe needs WAY more than 5 cups of water... I must have used 15 and next time will probably use about 20-23 - it boils down quickly so it requires a lot of water. Overall, the taste was fine and it's a nice recipe for a different type of cuisine.

this was wonderful... tasty and garlicky.  I used sliced fried garlic on top and sliced the eggs on top for presentation
