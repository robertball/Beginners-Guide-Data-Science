Pretty easy to do though a bit time consuming relatively to buying paneer from the store.   I made it to use in palak paneer and it all turned out great!

I  have wanted to try making paneer, and I came across this recipe.  It really was easy, although time-consuming because of heating a whole gallon of milk at a fairly low temperature .  It turned out well and has a good taste, faintly lemony.  I did use fresh lemons in it.  I might add a full teaspoon of salt the next time.  My only complaint with the recipe is that it does not state when to remove the milk from the heat.  I turned off the stove when I started to add the lemon juice, and it seemed to work fine.  I didn't know what to expect with the curds, but they were very small.  After taking some time trying to scoop them up with a slotted spoon, I ended up pouring the rest into a large wire strainer, which expedited the process and probably removed more water than the spoon would have.  I let it set for about 2 hours, and it was firm and could be sliced with a sharp knife.
