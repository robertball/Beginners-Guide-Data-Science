Was very good.  I mixed the onions straight into the beef, instead of in the middle.  Used Amberbock as the beer, but would definitely cut it down to 1/4 of a bottle.  Cooked it on a Foreman, so the soggyness wasn't too much of a factor.

Be careful on the beer, i used 1 lb of ground beef and put 1/2 a bottle of sam adams in and it made the soggiest burgers ive ever had... the finished burger was mush (what didnt fall in the grill). If i would have used 1/4 bottle it might have tasted decent, but the beer taste is really strong. ill try again.

These burgers were very tasty and a welcome change of pace.  The beer added a really good tang to them and putting the onions and peppers inside added a real zing.   I however took the seeds out of the peppers so they weren't as spicy.

these are really good!
not the kind of burger that you would want to have all the time, but a really nice change.  My roommates loved them! They're really moist and they have a definite beer-y flavour...the onions and peppers are great in them : )

I also put in a half bottle of sam adams, having not read the reviews until afterwards, unfortunately, they were so soggy they fell apart as I turned them over.  I wouldn't make this again, but enjoyed the experience.  They were way too greasy for my taste!

Nice moist burger.  I didn't use onions, because I don't like them.  I didn't use all the beer which was good because you don't need it all.  You could really taste it, but I used Guinness, so it was all good.

What a disappointment!!! The burgers fell apart and we only used a quarter of a bottle of beer. Also the bread crumbs gave it a very odd texture. This was not the burger we were expecting!

Wild combo for sure! I used 3 lbs of gr. beef and 1 bottle of suds, Terrific! I added dried onions and saved the fresh onions for the garnish, along with pickled jalapenos. Keeper:):) Thanks John
