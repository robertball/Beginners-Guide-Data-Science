I added more rice vinegar, honey and a little tarragon. Whole different level. I'd give it 3. 75 stars without the extras.

Another winner from Chef John. Easy, fast, delicious. Had no rice vinegar, so used red wine vinegar. Had no Sriracha, so used Texas Pete. Happy wife. I'm happy. Everyone's happy.

Very easy and delicious.  My go to recipe.  I have used Durkee's Red Hot Sauce or Honey Mustard Dijon when I don't have ingredients on hand.

This has become our 1st choice salmon recipe. We used to always grill (which is terrific), but winter weather drove us inside. The recipe is foolproof, but I find that with thicker salmon, I have to cook it on a lower oven rack first and finish it under the broiler in order to have it cooked through.

good, simple recipe. I added honey for a bit of sweetness and doubled the siracha - it was not too hot.

This was SO good and insanely easy and cheap to make! Very little prep involved and cooks in a matter of minutes! 

Will definitely make this again.

I love how easy it is to make but it was very bland. I ended up adding a teaspoon of lemon pepper after it was cooked to give it a kick in the rump. Even still, I don't think I'll make it again.

This was soooo good!! The glaze was super quick and easy to pull together, and added a great flavor to the fresh salmon.
This will become a regular dish for us!

Delicious! Added a little extra sriracha (we like heat!) and as others noted, about a tablespoon of honey. It was PHENOMENAL! Very excited to see what else we can make with the glaze.

Nice flavor.  I thought the chili paste would make it hot, but it really wasnt.

I did substitute harissa paste for the chili paste because that's what I haon on hand

Quick and easy in the broiler, but it didn't say high or low in the directions. So I did it in high. I didn't use any herbs (where did it say that in the recipe?) and skipped the hot sauce--I've used Nagano seasoned rice vinegar with French's Dijon mustard with chardonnay and a hint of honey. I've used Aldi's Sea Queen frozen wild pink salmon instead of fresh.  But overall it was delicious.

I have cooked for years, but never cooked salmon. The only thing I did different was to lower the rack one notch. Great recipe!

Not bad! I used Tabasco sauce, not Sriracha sauce sauce because we don’t like it. I will make again using a little honey to sweeten it a little.

Spectacular. I think I made a mistake by adding too much sriracha because the salmon doesn't need that much spiciness, but my husband loved it like that. An instant favourite. Perfectly cooked salmon.

This was so simple and so delicious! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.
