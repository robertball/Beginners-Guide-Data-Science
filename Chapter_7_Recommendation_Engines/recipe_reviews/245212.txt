The recipe submitter stated that this recipe was for the glaze and that cook time will vary depending on how you like to cook your ham. We actually like to smoke our hams so my review is based on the glaze and not the cooking method. The glaze was amazing! It created the best "bark" of any ham I've ever made. The bourbon and horseradish mustard are dominant but blend absolutely perfect with the ham. This will be my go to glaze for ham from now on regardless of which method I cook it. .

Iâ€™ll do this again for sure. I might tamper with it a bit. Maybe half the cloves. But overall very pleased with my Christmas ham and what certainly will turn into string beans and ham. The neighbors will be happy too. I share.

I made the recipe exactly as suggested and my wife and I both loved it. I will definitely make this again!
