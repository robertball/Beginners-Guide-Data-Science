This recipe was very good, however I was a little disappointed that the Russian dressing overpowered the cranberry flavor that I was expecting. If you're looking for a real cranberry flavor, this is not the recipe for you. Otherwise the meatballs and sauce are very flavorful. More of a sweet/sour/chili sauce flavor.

I made these for a shower and everybody there raved about how good they were.  The meateaters there could not believe they were vegetarian and were eating these over the meat choices available!

These were delicious! Being a vegetarian, I always see these at potlucks but I never could try any until now!  We made the meatballs one day in advance and then heated them with the sauce the next day. (we had cut down the recipe and had it along with a fondu for a romantic dinner.) My husband liked them so much he suggested we make a big batch and freeze them to keep them handy!  I would not change a thing!

The cranberry sauce is fabulous, especially as a holiday main dish (you might want to double the sauce recipe if you like a little extra to dip in)- but don't stop there! Throw these wonderful "meat(less)balls" into tomato sauce for a sub sandwich or pasta topper - oh, the possibilities!

I was happy with the way this recipe turned out, although I did make a few changes. I used Morningstar Recipe Crumbles rather than whole patties and slivered almonds instead of walnuts because that was what I had on hand. I also substituted sweet and sour sauce for both the chili sauce and the Russian dressing called for, and used slightly less cream cheese and round crackers than the quantities given. Finally, I used Honey Bunches of Oats instead of regular cornflakes. The mixture didn't hold together well enough to be shaped into meatballs, so I ended up plopping them in the baking pan like cookies, but they tasted great. My brother said they didn't taste anything like regular meatballs, but he ate them anyway, and my mother loved the sauce. Thanks for the recipe; I will probably make it again and try it with more of the original ingredients next time.

My 3 year old would only eat these meatballs last christmas eve.  He was the only one who liked it because of the sauce I used.  I couldn't find russian dressing so I ended up getting a bottle of sweet & sour (some unknown brand that was left on the shelf, at the grocery store, christmas eve).  Next time, we're going to use a BBQ sauce.  The meatballs turned out great, we're just working on the sauce.

Mixture came out too wet. I had to add more crushed corn flakes and crackers. It would have been helpful to add the ounces used in the veggie burgers since sizes can vary quite a bit.

I made the sauce for this recipe and substituted turkey meatballs.  Was a great success and the recipe was asked for over and over.

Sooooo good!  I could eat these all the time!  Made them for a party - most people thought they were real meat.  I used a package of "buger crumbles" instead of the veggie burger patties.

These are AWESOME!! I served them as a Thanksgiving appetizer and the meat-eaters were just as impressed. I had a hard time crumbling the patties (maybe it is just the brand I buy), so next time I think I will just buy Smart Ground or another ground beef alternative. But there will definitely be a next time!! Thanks for the great recipe!!

My kids and I love this though we have adjusted the sauce.  I use a favorite sweet and sour sauce that we have.  We've also used different nuts.  It's now a staple for us.

Love these veggyballs!  Changes I made to up the fibre/health factor:  replaced corn flakes and crackers with crushed PC ancient grains organic cereal; used milled flaxseed and wholegrain rice to replace half the chopped walnuts. Thanks again for this contribution--I may never go back to meatballs again!

Loved this recipe, but would leave out walnuts, use Ritz crackers, freeze after cooking without sauce.  Defrost in refrig. adding sauce, overnight. Warm up before party.

I like quick & easy so I used Mama Lucia frozen meatballs,which we love. I didn't have russian dressing so I took the advice of another viewer and used some BBQ sauce. also added a wee bit of heat with hot sauce,& a dash of worchestershire sauce. Turned out great! Husband loved them,taking to a after Christmas party this eve! Let ya know later how the liked them!

By boyfriend made this recipe for me, and it turned out so good! He's not a cook, and he didn't really chop the walnuts making them hard to shape into balls, and added the cranberry sauce to the mixture instead of using it for sauce (like I mentioned, not a cook). With all the mistakes, it still turned out excellent! Makes quite a bit of balls, and they are very rich, but a declicious treat that is fun to make and practically fool-proof. Other users mentioned that the Russian dressing was too overpowering, but I did not find this to be the case. Perhaps because we had double the cranberry sauce, one can in the mixture and one can for the sauce. I wouldn't recommend this though, the extra can in the mixture makes it too sticky to form into proper balls. All in all, 5 stars because it seems like no matter what you do throw it all together and you have a great meal for meat-eaters and vegitarians alike!

These were just good for me, not outstanding. Maybe I'm just not accustomed to the texture of whatever the veggie patties are made of. I agree that the balls should be drizzled, as I found the color of the cranberry sauce not-so attractive, and with the balls all mixed in there, it was blah looking (to me). I'm going to try them for a shower, and see how they go over. The flavor WAS really good.

Big hit! Even amongst heat eatters!  I would however, cut the sauce by half and have it on the side or lightly drissle.

I just put these in the oven for the third year running for our Superbowl eats.  I LOVE these, and so does everyone else.  Just like others have said the meat eaters enjoy them just as much as the vegetarians.  I've followed the recipe to a t and it always turns out great.  Thanks for this keeper recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I made it with Trader Joe's Nirvana veggie burgurs and it was a smashing success at my party. Highly recommend it although it's a lot of work making it.

I don't usually eat vegetarian food on purpose, but found out about Gardenburger's Mama Mia meatballs.
I used left over homemade cranberry sauce left over from Thanksgiving. Maybe I won't be so hesitant to try veggie foods now. Thanks for the recipe!

Yes I have tried this recipe.  Just got married and my huband eats rice, beans, cabbage, broccoli, spinach, spagetti, pizza ... catch my drift. Nothing of variety, so I am challenged to be creative and increase the food options. Fortunately he saw me put putting the corn flakes and the veggie patties during the preparation otherwise he would have quickly stated, "What's that you're putting in there, I don't eat that." Fabulous. I molded them large and used only 4 patties just in case he did not like it. He loved them. Thanks. I can now start to increase our options and it makes me feel good knowing there is something out there I can cook that he eats. They really came out perfect and of course, I left out the dipping sauce because... "I don't eat that."

Thank you for posting this recipe!! I had been looking for a *very* long time for a veg substitute for my late grandmothers meatballs, which were my favorite food ever as I was growing up (unless it was tied with her lasagna)! *This* recipe was the one that finally satisfied my cravings! I used bran flakes instead of corn flakes (because I had them) and ketchup instead of chili sauce, and I made (homemade) tomato sauce (because otherwise they wouldn't have been my grandmother's). I am still drooling!
