After reading reviews I learned three things:
1- use liners
2- 350 degrees for 20 min
3- add 1/2 tsp cinn and vanilla.

VERY good! I had no spilling and the muffins were moist and flavorful. I win!

A word to the wise: don't fill the tins with the jam directly in the middle!  The jam bubbled up through the top of the muffins, creating a small mess.  I bet putting the jam in sooner/deeper would have alleviated this somewhat.  Trying to be as health-conscious as possible, I subbed applesauce for the butter, and they turned out fine.  A good, healthy muffin, with a nice taste.  Oh, and I think raspberry jam tastes the best.  :-)

I followed this recipe as written. It directs to either grease your muffin tin, or line with papers, and I chose to grease. Well, the jam seemed to sink, and all but two of the muffins lost their bottoms in the pan, and as I seem to be the only reviewer who had this happen, I'm guessing I was probably the only one who didn't use liners. The recipe also directs to make a depression in the batter to drop the jam in to. I'm also guessing this contributed to the problem. I baked them at 400 degrees and they were a little over done at 20 minutes, so I can't imagine how overdone they would be if baked at 425. 350 to 375 for 20 minutes would be acceptable for these. Problems aside, these weren't outstanding enough in any aspect for me to attempt again.

I followed the recipe closely, only using "soured" lactose-free milk and vegetable oil in place of the butter because I was feeding a child with a lactose sensitivity. I used a homemade strawberry freezer jam in these muffins. I did bake the muffins at 350* for 20 minutes, based on other reviews I'd read. For me, these were a mess. I had the same issue that another reviewer had--the jam bubbled through the muffin batter and made a mess all over my muffin tin and in the oven. I don't know what I did wrong but I'm not patient enough to try these again. Not only were these pretty much unedible, I had quite the mess to clean up after.

I burnt my tongue eating these hot out of the oven and still couldn't stop!

Oh and as for the concerns over jam bubbling to the top:  mine was right at the top (barely covered with batter) and still didn't bubble over.  In fact it sank during baking and ended up close to the bottom.  So I would say it's safer to add it closer to the top than at the bottom.

The recipe is way off for temperature of the oven and for time baked. Do not, if cooking at 425 leave these muffins in for anywhere near 20 minutes..you will get hockey pucks

So good! Next time I might try less butter to make them a little healthier but as written they are seriously good! It only made 9 muffins for me. Oh, and I baked them at 350 not 425.

I had doubts about these but they turned out awesome!  I used ground flax in place of the wheat germ and a little bit of applesauce in place of some of the butter.  I used orange marmalade for the filling but I think some sort of berry would be even better, like strawberry or raspberry.  This only made 10 muffins for me.

omg! thank you so much for this recipe! my husband and my in-laws loved it. Unfortunatly I didnt have whole wheat flour so I used all purpose flour and I didnt have any jam on hand so I just made my own jam from dried figs (water,squeeze of lemon juice,sugar,chopped dried figs) And wow! it tasted so good. My husband loved them and even my picky mother-n-law said they were more than good! Oh and btw, I did add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon cuz i love it, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla, turned out perfect and it was my first time making muffins!

These muffins were so delicious!  I made half the batch as mini muffins, baked for 15 min and they turned out great.  I filled the muffin cups half way before adding the jam (with both the regular-size and the minis). It was perfect.

holy COW these are INCREDIBLE!

I would love these even as a stand-alone bran muffin, but the surprise in the middle just blew me a-WAY!  i used homemade concord grape jelly.  the muffins were moist and the tops were crispy and awesome.  now i just need to figure out how to get MORE jelly in there without it spilling over.  wow wow WOW!

i didn't have any jelly spilling over issues.  i filled the cups 3/4 full, made a little dent, then put the jelly close to the middle.  some of it oozed to the sides when i spooned the extra batter on top, but as long as this happened within the paper liner, it all baked okay and didn't bubble up out of the top.

I'll definitely double the recipe next time.  This only made 6 regular sized muffins.  mmMM!

After reading the reviews I decided to forget the jelly and add candied fruit.  The wheat germ gave the muffins a gritty texture that I didn't care for and I think there should have been some cinnamon or nutmeg added for flavor.  It sounded like a good idea but just didn't do it for us.  Thanks for the chance to try something different.

On the good side, these are a healthy way to make muffins but still keep a fun bit of yum to them. I didn't have any problems with my muffins bubbling over, but I made mine a bit small because they were destined for my preschooler's class. I made mine with homemade strawberry jam and that seemed to work well.  On the bad side...come on, 20-25 minutes at 425*F for muffins? Who does that?? I put mine in at 400*F for all of 18 minutes - against my better judgment given the normal baking temp for a muffin recipe - and they came out overdone, though still reasonably edible. I wish I'd listened to myself at put them in at maybe 375*F. Also, the batter was bland when I mixed it up, so I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon before baking.  Overall, I'd rate this at 2.5 stars. I might try this recipe again with some adjustments, but I wouldn't really recommend it as written. There are better ways to make a healthy muffin.

[Modified from ange82's review]: 
(1) Grease and FLOUR muffin tins. 
(2) 350F for 20min. 
(3) Add 1/2 tsp cinnamon and vanilla.

If you don't have liners, flouring the tins is way cheaper and just as good! 
Everyone raved!!

These were super yummy!  Of course I can't leave any recipe alone, so I made a few changes.  I had no wheat germ, so I used a package of instant plain oatmeal and a few tablespoons of ground flax seed instead.  I also used Smart Balance spread instead of butter to cut back on the cholesterol and fat.  I only had soymilk.  And I added the zest of 2 lemons and about a 1/4 cup of unsweetened shredded coconut to the batter.  I used raspberry jam and had no trouble with the jam bubbling to the surface.  When they were done, I drizzled them with a glaze of lemon juice and confectioners sugar. My kids went NUTS!  Very good!

I should have read reviews - one said not to leave in at 425 for even 20 min. or you will get hockey pucks - WELL - I left in for 25 min. and mine got a little brown and chewy. Not unedible, but not great either. I won't make again. I have a muffin recipe that is a peanut butter batter that has jam in the middle that is better than this. Although not as healthy!! :-(

I love the idea of making muffins with mostly healthier ingredients, and I had great hopes for this recipe. Unfortunately, they were not as good as I expected. They were good, but lacked flavour like other reviewers mentioned. I did add some vanilla, but that was not enough. Other than that, I followed exactly. Did not have any problems with the jam seaping through, and I tried putting the jam differently for each muffin! Some near the bottom, some near the top, and some half way. As long as you cover the jam well with the rest of the batter, you should be fine! I made half with apricot jam and half with raspberry jam. I liked the raspberry better. Thanks for sharing, great healthy snack or breafast or dessert muffin.

First off, I should note that I made these before the recipe was fixed... baking soda was not listed and baking powder was listed twice. I had a problem with the bottoms being overdone, but I also probably put less than 1/2 of the batter into the pans before putting in the jam, since the review that I read, had a problem with jam oozing out and I didn't want that to happen. I used apricot jam and the basic flavor was good. I think I will try them again, putting a little more batter in the bottom of the pan and using the revised ingredients may help too!

I just use flour and no wheat germ. They turned out great! I might’ve put a little extra jelly on them. I cooked them two minutes shorter than the minimum time and they were slightly overdone.

Besides following other suggestions of adding vanilla and cinnamon, I gently mixed the jam into the batter before scooping into the muffin tins -- way quicker and easier, plus it gives you more jammy goodness in every bite!

These muffins are the easiest ever to make and they taste amazing. My kids finish them off in no time….I've made them several times and they consistently come out tasting great!!!

I halved the recipe, sub butter with vege oil, brown sugar with Stevia. Didn't have any buttermilk so sub with low fat milk mixed with lemon juice. Made mini muffins and they are not much of a surprise as the jam bubbled over lol! They get a thumbs up from my 9yr old and I do enjoyed them too. Will definitely make these again. Ty for sharing :D

Though not pretty (mine came out flat), they were one of the tastiest bran muffins I've had.  My husband and kids gobbled them up.  I decreased the baking temperature to 375 as others suggested, and mine were done in 20 minutes.  The jam did sink almost to the bottom, but not enough to make the muffins stick.  I may try leaving out the jam and mixing in raisins next time.

I thought these were excellent, and so did my family. I followed the recipe as is.
The wheat germ added a great nutty taste, and the muffins were moist.
My baking time was shorter than the recipe listed- so watch them in your oven!

These were pretty good, but a little sour tasting to me.  Next time I think I will try with regular milk and a little more brown sugar.

WONDERFUL muffins! I love the warm jam in the middle! Very moist!!  I love to bake, and these will definitely be in the regular routine now!  The ONLY think that I changed was the baking time.  At 425, I baked them for only 17 minutes.  They were great!  Thank you for this recipe!

Yummy!  I did make some adjustments for health reasons and out of default when lacking some ingredients.  I substituted cornmeal for the wheat germ, I actually really enjoyed to texture it gave.  I also substituted vanilla yogurt for the butter = my new favorite thing to do.  I also used the new Splenda brown sugar.  I was very pleased.  I kinda ran out of batter to top the jam on a few of the muffins and that is when the jam ran over.  If you completely cover the jam, no fuss!

Super simple and super delicious.  Followed the recipe to the "t" and as another reviewer wrote...the jelly did not bubble up but sank more to the bottom.   Great healthy alternative and just as good as a jelly donut!!

This recipe is a keeper!!!  I made these without jam (nobody in my household likes jam), and they were very moist and delicious.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and omitted the wheat germ, adding another 1/3 cup of whole wheat flour instead.  We ate them plain (no butter) with dinner and they were a hit!

Really tasty muffins.  I didn't have a problem with the jam bubbling over and will add more to the centre the next time I make this recipe.  I also added some cinnamon, dotted with jam and sprinkled flax on top.
