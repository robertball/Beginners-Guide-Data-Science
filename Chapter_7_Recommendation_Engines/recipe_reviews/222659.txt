Tomato and basil are a classic combination and when paired with fresh mozzarella you have something so simple and so delicious you could make a meal out of this all by itself! The addition of good quality balsamic vinegar gives it that little added "pizzaz"- perfect served with Italian bread and a nice wine!

A lovely Caprese Salad - perfect for those wonderful summer tomatoes and garden basil.  Use a good quality balsamic.  I made this for Faceless Frenzy July 2012 - it had no reviews and no picture.  Try it, you will love this salad.

Made this tonight for my daughter who is always raving about the Caprese Salad where she works and claims to never be able to get enough of it.  I served the salad on a bed of fresh baby spinach and garnished the sides with avocado.  I also added one clove of minced garlic to the dressing which made for a beautiful and satisfying salad.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I use a little "Krazy Jane" salt~it's a combination of garlic & onion salt.  I mist my olive oil for less calories & then I use the Balsamic glaze over it.

Wonderfully simple. I even forgot to get the fresh mozzarella and it was still just as good! Also, I used sweet grape tomatoes and halved them. Delish!

Same ingredients, different presentation can boost the flavor for those who found it lacking.  Only "real" tomatoes - homegrown or farmers market, heirloom preferred.  Instead of "side-stacking" as shown, arrange individual slices on plate/platter and salt/pepper to taste. Top with cheese, drizzle w/oil & vinegar and garnish with torn basil leaves.  I sometimes drizzle w/just the oil and "flick" the balsamic vinegar on with a pastry brush.

Do yourself a favor and use a different dressing recipe.  The vinegar is crazy over powering; that's all you can taste.

I subbed fresh lemon juice for the vinegar and 3 corn cracked pepper, but this is a traditional delight, especially in the cool evening after a hot summer day.  Simple and delicious!

Very tasty!  I love fresh veggies and when I can get some yummy sweet tomatoes I will think of this recipe!  Simple and flavorful - great for a lite Saturday lunch or just a great side dish.

I think I've made this 5 or 6 times this summer.  It's an excellent recipe as it is written.  My only suggestion is to purchase a good balsamic vinegar - it makes a big difference.

Excellent!  Also nice as an Italian dinner appetizer by inserting very thin sliced Genoa salami in between the cheese and tomato.  I never have leftovers and it's frequently requested by my guests.

Used all ingredients as per recipe. We loved it and do not feel the vinegar was overpowering. Using a good quality balsamic vinegar is key. Thanks for a great recipe , will be using over and over in my family.

I  used my home brewed apple cider vinegar, in place of balsamic which can be overpowering.  Black Krim tomatoes from the garden also help with their big flavor.

I regularly use this recipe with some additions . I double the dressing and add a clove of garlic and some fresh basil and blend with my immersion blender then serve it all over greens of your choice and add some garden cucumbers and peppers chopped small for a little extra pizzazz!! Presents beautifully and never disappoints!!

Next time I will cut the olive oil, balsamic, salt and pepper in half. The full recipe leaves a runny mess on the bottom of the serving plate.

Based on an earlier comment, I reduced the balsamic vinegar by half and it was wonderful.  I will definitely make it again.

I have made this twice now and it is just delicious. This time I only had one tomato, but I had a whole bunch of grape tomatoes from my garden.  I sliced the tomato and alternated the tomato with mozzarella slices in the middle of the plate and halved the grape tomatoes around the sliced tomato with bits of mozzarella on each half. I used aged balsamic vinegar in the dressing. Just divine.

This is a pretty standard recipe for Caprese salad. I like to serve it on a bed of mixed greens. If you don't like so much vinegar, use white balsamic vinegar, or just use less of the dressing. You also can just drizzle a little of the vinegar and olive oil over the salad, no mixing needed.

This is a great appetizer to share or as a light lunch.  I went a little less on the balsamic vinegar and was absolutely delicious.

I served this recipe over Labor Day, used rich, red Jersey tomatoes and picked my own basil to make the vinaigrette.  It was sensational.  The only change I would make is to dribble less vinaigrette over the tomato/cheese slices.  I tended to use most of what I made, and I didn't need it.  Also, the picture at the top does not show the vinaigrette of this recipe--it lacks the balsamic vinegar.  I'm sure it would be delicious as well.

I made this recipe exactly as written. I used fresh tomatoes and basil from our local farmer's market, and locally produced cheese. My wife thought that the fresh basil was slightly overpowering, and left it on her plate.  But, I thought it was perfect just as it is.  I wouldn't change any part of the recipe. I'll definitely make it again.
