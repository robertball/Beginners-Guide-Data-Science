Having made it again a couple of times, I've discovered that my blender does not handle the rind well at all. Next time I'm going to zest the lime then peel it.

This was SO refreshing! The combination of the ingredients seemed odd but went together perfectly! I absolutely recommend this. Oh can't wait to make it again.

Very odd combination but it was ok. Would be great to use up extra basil from plants.

This was refreshing and yet odd. I did add a tablespoon of fresh parsley and lemon juice with the honey. I made some ice cubes from mixture. I will make this again.

Surprisingly good. Like others I was skeptical about the ingredients but decided to give it a shot. I had frozen green grapes and based on one review I read added a frozen cube of lemon juice that I had on hand. For this reason I did not need to add ice cubes but I did need to add water to get my blender going since it is just a plain 'ol blender. I omitted the dates and added a tablespoon of honey. Very refreshing!

I love the idea but as Nicole said my blender wasn't able to grind up the rind very well even after I had sliced the lime into small segments. For those using honey I would double it to 2 tbsp instead as it is quite tart (I did add a few extra green grapes tho). I would also zest the rind instead next time. I might try adding yogurt as well to make it creamy.
