Super simple and full of flavor. I do not follow the Paleo diet and did serve this over pasta for my husbands sake but my review is not based off of the pasta. I went on a group lunch at work to an Italian restaurant where I only got soup and salad but most of my coworkers got chicken marsala. I had made it before but it had been quite some time so I got a wild hair to make it again that night for dinner. This was excellent! It does take a little time and pampering but it is worth it. The sauce is so rich and full of flavor. The one thing I thought it could have used was a little tang to give it some zip so I might try adding some capers next time. Regardless, this was excellent as written. I promise you won't be disappointed!
