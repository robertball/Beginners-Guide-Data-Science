This recipe rates 5 stars made without any omissions or substitutions. (I find it irritating when recipes are rated after they have been changed to the point that it is no longer the same recipe) This is quick, easy, filling, and has just the right amount of heat.

Great!  The only thing that was missing was to turn the burner down to between Medium and Low after you bring it to a boil.

This is a great, easy recipe!  I too left out the cilantro.  I used a can of corn, drained, in lieu of fresh corn.  Instead of garlic powder I minced a couple cloves of fresh garlic and sauteed it along with the onions in the beef.  We had ours served with tortilla chips.  Next time I'd like to substitute some of the meat for black beans.  Great taste and so simple!

TIP*  Make sure to turn the heat down after you cover the pot to cook the rice!

This is really good.  I left the cilantro out of mine because I don't like it, but I did everything else the same.  I used as a filling for burritos and added extra cheese, sour cream, salsa, and onions.  Really easy meal.

My family thought this was very good.  We put it in flour tortillas.  I followed everything on the recipe, except I used a can of corn, which did just fine.  Will make it again!  (When I do, I may use instant rice.)

My family and I loved it!  Even my two year old cleaned her plate!  I did, however, add taco seasoning in with the ground beef and nix the green pepper.  We served it in flour tortillas and thought it was like Taco Bell burritos - only better!

Easy, filling and popular with my two toddlers. I substituted enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce and I served it with tortillas.

Oh so yummy! Very tasty and filling. Switched up on some of the spices as follows: (i) added fresh cilantro (about 1/4 bunch) instead of minced cilantro {cooked w/ onion & green pepper}, (ii) reduced beef broth to 6 oz., and added 8 oz. pack of Classic Fajita Skillet Sauce w/ Chipotle + Lime {by Chef R. Bayless; available @ Whole Foods}, and (iii) substituted 2 tablespoons “Taco Seasoning” from this site and eliminated chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, & salt from ingredients list (already incorporated in “Taco Seasoning”).  Thanks boris for a great concoction.

Great recipe! This recipe makes a very flavorful and satisfying entree. I prepared this dish exactly as written and served it with Homesteader Corn Bread on the side (recipe in the bread section). Husband and son also REALLY enjoyed this. Thank you for the great recipe!

Very good, amendable recipe - I used regular brown rice, just increased the cooking time.  I also added 1 can pureed kidney beans to stretch the recipe - gave it a very creamy texture.

This is my second time making this for my husband.  My first time was about 4 months ago and ever since he has been asking me to make this again.  I finally got around to it again and LOVES IT!!!  He said he can  eat this every day.  I do add sour cream and taco sauce to it.  But other than that I followed the recipe.  Excellent dish and easy to make.

Made this last night and was very pleased.  I used 1 bag of success rice and added a can of rinsed pinto beans.  I also used a taco season pack because I was out of chili powder.  We sprinkled cilanto and cheese on top and a dollop of sour cream.  I'm going to try this next week with Asian flavors and swap out corn for zuccini or asparagus.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is a great one-pot meal that's fairly simple to make.  I changed the amount of spice in the recipe, because we don't like really spicy food.  I cut the chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, and black pepper in half, and it was still a bit spicy for my young kids.  So...if you don't care for spicy food, you'll definitely want to tweak the spices.

Fabuloso!  It is really easy, tasty and filling. I made a few minor changes.  I added 1/4 tsp cumin and 1/2 packet of Goya Sazon Con Culantro Y Achiote. I also used 1 drained can of whole kernel corn instead of fresh corn. I threw it all in the rice cooker. I also left out the cheese. I will definitely make again.  I served with Mexican Corn Bread (recipe on allrecipes)

Great! The only thing different I did was use a big can (25oz)of diced tomatoes in tomato sauce and a big can (8oz)of green chilies. I also added cumin and used instant rice. It was done all together within 30 mins. This should be called Mexican Rice Dinner. Great and we'll be making it all the time now!

Made this for dinner last night but subbing left over chicken and chicken broth for beef. it was so good. everyone loved it even my kids.and to find something all 4 kids like is a challenge. I served them in wraps with cheese, lettuce and sour cream. will make again. the only problem I had was that I had to cook longer because the rice was not done in 25 min. next time I will either use minute rice or pre cook the rice a little first. all and all a winner in my house.

I rate it about a 4.5 and only because the rice was not as done as I had wished.  I followed directions and did not change anything except not adding corn.  (oh I may have added an extra 1/2t of chili powder).  Very flavorful.  Loved by everyone and plates were completely clean!  (not any left at all on plates).  I decided to only top individual plates with cheese, as my daughter is not a cheese fan.  I served with corn bread which went very well.  The rice was a bit spicy, but not too much. I am not sure how to get the rice more tender.  Next time may add a bit more liquid.  Very tasty!

very very good. I was moving and had to find a recipe to use up some of the stuff I had in the house so we wouldn't have to move it. this used up a lot of my canned goods and is very good and very filling. I did change some stuff on it. I was out of picante sauce and used taco sauce instead. I added a can of pinto beans. I was out of onion so I did onion soup mix and added a package of taco sauce. this is the bomb. easy filling and worth doing again.

Overall good taste...I like my rice drier and the grains more separated...perhaps less tomato sauce would have been the way to go.

Thanks for the great recipe.  I enjoyed this recipe but I cook as I go - even mixing recipes  sometimes to suit what I'm looking for.  Just thought I'd add that a can of mexican corn is great to throw in if you don't have fresh corn kernels.  This time, I left out the hamburger {and apparently forgot the cheese both times) and it was a great side!  To those of you who do review and mention additions or changes - I really appreciate the input because sometimes there is a review with a great idea that I would maybe not have come up with.  But, I do agree that one shouldn't change the entire recipe then say it tastes bad and give a bad review.  This is a keeper in our house!

Another family favorite from Allrecipes! I do this a little differently after making it a few times though. I've found that the rice does not cook through and tends to be crunchy when following the recipe. So I combine everything and cook according to the recipe, EXCEPT for the rice and cheese. I cook the rice separately and add it to the cooked mixture. I put it in a baking dish and bake for about 20 minutes at about 350. Then we serve it and put the cheese on top of each serving. You can also put the cheese on top of the casserole during the last couple minutes of baking.

Excellent recipe! I added in some black beans and omitted the cheese. Served in tortillas like a burrito and they were gobbled up.  Make sure you use a HUGE pot as this makes a lot - more than 6 servings for my family!

This turned out even better than I thought my boyfreind liked a lot, he said it had just the right of amount of spices.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.

I needed to use up some wild rice and ground beef so I went looking for a recipe that seemed quick and easy. I didn't have all the ingredients -- no bell pepper, no corn, no cilantro -- so I just used those that I had on hand... Since everything was leftover, I simply put the beef in the skillet, added the onion, and then dumped in the diced tomatoes and salsa, and then added the spices and finished with the cooked rice. Oh, I also substituted 1 tbsp crushed chillies for chili powder (which may have been a bit more than was necessary as it was quite hot)... In spite of all these 'adjustments,' there is no doubt that this recipe is a keeper! Even my 3 year old thought it was YUMMY (albeit a bit spicy for tender taste buds)...

I just made this and am enjoying it for dinner right now. This is delicious and very easy to make! I am vegetarian, so instead of ground beef I used one of those soy meatless ground "meat" packages that simulates ground beef and it came out wonderfully. I did not have chili powder on hand, so I used a bit of cyan pepper instead. These were the only deviations from the original recipe, and it is a meal in itself. Serve it hot off the stove, sprinkle on a lot of shredded cheese, let it get melty and enjoy. It could be a good side dish, but I'm eating it in a bowl on its own. I also plan to use some as burrito filling. Excellent dish.

Very hearty and filling meal. I use half a packet of taco seasoning in place of the spices. Also good to create a burrito and serve in soft warm tortilla.

Very good!  My husband turned his nose up at it at first thinking it was the Texas Hash his mom used to make.  He said this was much better. I did make a couple of changes - no green pepper and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh tomatoes.  Used canned corn, too.  It was a little spicy, but even my two year old liked it - so it's not too spicy.  Great served with those thick Mexican tortilla chips.

I really LOVED this recipe.  Didn't change much, other than I didn't add cilantro because I don't like it, but thats just me.  I ate it with shredded cheddar, sour cream and pickled jalapeno slices...OH MY!  It makes a lot though....which is great!!!

The mexican rice was okay. I toned down the veggies and spices so that my kids would eat it and there was still a lot of flavor and kick. I served it in flour tortillas with sour cream and sliced avacados. I'm sure I'll make it again when we need something a little different.

Great recipe, I left out the chilis and uset canned diced tomatoes instead of salsa because that is what I had.  I also added black beans and used instant brown rice wich cut down the cooking time.  It was very good, my kids loved it.  I made enough for two meals for my family of 5, leftovers were also great.

This was very quick and pretty good.  I didn't have salsa, so I added another can of diced tomatoes and a small can of sliced black olives.  I didn't have cilantro, so I added parsley instead.  Even my 21-month-old daughter liked it!

This was a great recipe for stuffing burritos. I did make some changes, though. I am allergic to peppers, so omitted the peppers and chilies and I used canned diced tomatoes with onions. I also added a little more rice, as I wanted to make sure it wasn't runny for the tortillas.
I would definately make this again...it was hard to stop eating this! Thanks, Pat!

Excellent and easy recipe - I didn't alter a thing!  My husband enjoyed it so much that he brought extras to work, for the guys to try it out.  It is great to find something so easy with a 7-month old keeping me so busy. It was so good that I will even try it out on my most difficult critic, my 12 year-old!

I left out a few things from the recipe, given the picky eater I'm feeding and the type I am: bell pepper, salsa, cilantro. However, this is a spectacular dish. I served it on tortillas as a burrito/taco filling and just loved it. We had it for lunch the next day as well. The rice was just a little spicy, but not too much and covered with yummy cheese. For anyone who likes a zesty little mexican dish, this is definitely for you!

Delicious! Our picky kids actually enjoyed it. We also chopped the bell pepper finer in a food processor to "hide" the fact that there was bell peppers in it. This would be great plain, but we spooned it onto tortillas. It would also be great in a taco bowl shell with avocado or guacamole on top, black olives, and we're considering adding some black beans next time around.

Great dish and really easy.  I can my own salsa, so added that instead of the tomatoes to add more kick..  Hubby loved it.  Was even better when it was eaten as leftovers.

sorry but this is NOT Mexican rice. It's a casserole.

Good, quick and easy. I added the rice to saute with the veggies before adding the liquids as I find this gives the rice a better taste. Seasoning can be adjusted to taste.

This review is long, long overdue - I’ve been making Maria’s rice for 7 or 8 years now. It’s become a favorite of my family, and is always a hit with company. I follow the recipe exactly as written, except I don’t add the Serrano pepper. It has just the perfect amount of crisp texture, delicious flavor, and perfect consistency. ??

Great recipe!  After years of buying the Knorr Rice Sides and having them always disappoint, it donned on me that I should try making Mexican rice from scratch. Duh.  So glad I found this recipe and tried it first because it'll be my go-to. It's so easy and delicious. I took the top reviewers tweaks (saute onions first, and used taco seasoning instead of the other spices) and it turned out perfect!

I made this recipe with less corn for out tastes, but the flavor overall was just great.  Will definitely make again, great accompanying dish for lots of Mexican recipes.

I was unsure how my family would like this but it was a hit! You can add anything you like really as it is a flexible recipe. I scaled to 9 servings as my ground beef was 1.5 lbs, but only used 1.5 cups of uncooked rice as that was all I had. I also added some black beans I had in the fridge and used Southwestern style canned corn for the frozen. Omitted cilantro as we don't like it and used oregano instead. Skipped the cheese, we didn't miss it, would definitely make again.

My son and husband absolutely loved this recipe.  The only change is that I used Jasmine rice as that is all that I had on hand.  Husband ate it as-is and son put it on a tortilla shell with lettuce, onions and hot sauce (which he puts on EVERYTHING).

I used this as a side dish to accompany fajitas and eliminated the ground beef. Worked great! This will be my 'go to' side for Mexican meals.

I'll start right off by saying that I get annoyed when I read a review for a recipe where a gazillion changes were made. I want to know how the recipe tastes as written! That being said, I made changes to this recipe, mostly because I didn't have everything on hand and I preferred a different cooking method for rice. I omitted the ground beef because I was looking for a side dish for some flank steak. I also omitted the green pepper, but only because I didn't have any. I cooked the onion in olive oil until it was soft. Then I combined the onion with the dry rice in a 9x13 baking dish. At this point I also added a can of diced tomatoes, a can of diced green chiles (I didn't have any tomatoes with green chiles), a can of yellow corn and a can of black beans. In the same pot I cooked the onions, I heated the beef broth and the tomato sauce and all the spices for a few minutes until it was hot. Then I poured it onto the rice mixture in the baking dish. I covered the dish with foil and placed it in the oven at 350 degrees. The only downside is it took forever for the rice to bake (a little over an hour) but once it was done the rice was perfect and the flavors were amazing. And there was a ton of it. This recipe gets credit for the combination of flavors. I used the cooking method from the "Classic Rice Pilaf" recipe I also got from this site. I might cook up some ground beef tomorrow and use the rice I made to make burritos!

I was using leftover taco meat, so I didn't add any of the spices because the beef had already been seasoned. I only used about 3/4 cup of meat, so I added a can of pinto beans in with the broth.  I used fresh tomatoes, no corn, and didn't really measure anything except for the rice and broth, and my husband said, "I LOVE this," which is the first time he's used "love" for something other than salmon.  I'm going to add all of this recipe's ingredients to my grocery list so that I can try the original version!

Agree with others that it was easy but I also found it to be on the bland side. The suggestion to add taco seasoning  when browning the meat is a good idea that I will consider next time.

Wonderful! I made this exactly as written and it made a wonderful meal; all thumbs up around the table. I served it with flour and corn tortillas and saw my grandson making his into a big burrito. What a great idea! I found that after simmering for the called for 25 minutes, the rice was undercooked. I added a cup of water, returned the lid to the pot and continued to simmer for an additional 10 minutes, and this time the rice was cooked perfectly. This will be saved to my recipe box and become a part of my regular rotation.

Used beans instead of beef and chicken broth instead of beef broth but it was great! Make sure you turn down the burner to low after adding the rice though....

Daaang this is tasty! When it comes to food, I am cheap and lazy, but still like to eat relatively healthy and good. This meal is a winner for all criteria. Being cheap, I made a few changes and it turned out phenomenal! Spicy Italian sausage was cheaper than beef, so I used that. Didn't buy a bell pepper, and used some chicken stock bouillon that was laying around the house. Also didn't buy salsa. 
Even with the omissions it is wonderful, and sort of tastes like a restaurant enchilada or other delicious Mexican dish. 5 stars

This is a really good recipe. I did use ground turkey instead of beef and i did not add onions or bell pepper because my honey doesnt like either of them but i did too my portion with some chopped green onion, i also used hot picante sauce which added some spice yum.

Delicious! I added more cilantro than what was called because I love it.  Don't let it cook any longer than the recipe, mine got a little dry.

Great recipe that feeds a crowd. Substituted shredded chicken breast  for hamburger. Add 2 cans beans (black & pinto) along with jalapeños. We've eaten it as a main dish. Other times put mexican rice in a flour tortilla with shredded cheese.  Needed a potluck crockpot meal so assembled tortillas & wrapped each one  in aluminum foil. Tortillas were a hit at potluck

I put this together for want of using an avacado!  It is a great backup to some guacamole.  I didn't use the corn, and added some chile sauce and more salsa.
It was a hit with the family.  Even better as warmed up left-overs.  And thanks for the one dish clean-up.

This recipe is awesome although I did make it with Chicken instead of beef.  I used a rotisserie chicken and chicken broth.  I also added a can of black beans and served with tortillas and sliced avocado.  Everyone raved about them  The next day I made chicken nachos with the little I had left over.  I used tostito's queso cheese, black bean garlic chips, and topped the chicken mixture with sour cream, lettuce, and tomato.  The best chicken nachos I've ever had.

This is so good that I can't even wait until it's done cooking to review it! I just had a taste with 3 minutes on the clock and as expected the rice is not quite done, but the flavor, WOW. I used canned corn (drained) and I only had a small can of tomato sauce so I added a little extra salsa and in place of the beef broth I used water and two bouillon cubes. It is delicious. Thank you!

I've seen several comments regarding the rice is not cooked enough.  Only two or three people have remarked you need to turn the heat way down after adding the rice.  Otherwise you boil off the liquid.  After bringing the mixture to a boil and adding the rice, I return it to a boil cover and then turn down to very low.  If you were making real mexican rice (without all the goodies) you would turn it off and just let it set for 15-20 min.

Couldn't believe it when my picky eater 8-year-old tasted it and actually LOVED it!!!  It was a hit with all of us, which may be the first recipe that fits that description.  My husband's words "This is a keeper!".  Thanks for sharing it!

This was a really tasty Mexican Rice recipe!  I omitted the ground meat, as I was looking for a fun side-dish for taco night.  It was excellent; I will def make it again.  (I used a spicy tomatillo salsa and my homemade beef broth).  Thanks!

Wonderful!  I didn't have tomato sauce on hand so I opted for another can of diced tomatoes (this one without the peppers), pureed it in the blender (because hubby doesn't like an abundance of cooked tomatoes).  I made beef broth with water and Better Than Bullion, but only 1 cup as the second can of tomatoes added so much more liquid.  

Simple to prepare.  Awesome flavor!

I loved this rice! I have made it as a side dish and also used it in stuffed peppers. It is so versatile. I did leave out the cilantro just because it isn't my favorite and added black beans when doing the peppers. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!
