Substituted King Arthur Gluten free flour.  Added a sprinkle of light brown sugar and cinnamon on top of the crust before baking.
Very easy recipe to make, but it took over an hour to bake at near sea level elevations.  It's still very wet, as in there is liquid under the crust.
VERY sweet.  VERY VERY sweet.  VERY VERY cinnamon -y.
The crust is wonderful.  I poured it over the top, and it left about an inch clear around the edges.  That filled in as it baked.  The top and edges are a chewey, crispy goodness.  I'll be using this elsewhere.
Next time:
I'll cut the cinnamon by half.
The initial butter in the casserole dish will be a quarter cup (half stick).
I will cut the sugar in the peach mixture down to a half cup.  
I'll probably drain the peaches as well, both to cut the sweetness and liquid.

I followed the recipie as it is written and explained. I made this for a group of folks and its being requested again! Hahah. Comes together for a great looking and tasting product.  Does it make people smile when they first bite into this cobbler?  Yes. Yes it does.

Pretty awesome.  I used one stick butter total and used a larger can of peaches mostly drained.

I'm not a big fan of canned anything so I used a jar of peaches (19.5 Oz) packed in syrup. This is a really easy recipe for a busy weekday night. Makes a good tasting dessert and it's almost identical to the one my  grandmother used to make.

Probably not.  Looked beautiful but the peach flavor didn't come through well enough.

All I had was a can of Peach Pie Filling and fresh peaches. I thinly sliced fresh peaches and added to the pie filling, then followed the recipe.  I was worried that it would come out too "gummy" but it came out to the perfectly thick consistency that we prefer in a cobbler, and the crust was so delicious!  (So...to all those wondering if they should add cornstarch, try making this with peach pie filling!)

Didn't use nutmeg. Yes, I'll try it again. The second batch didn't come out as good as the first. It was funny. I might try with a different fruit. I don't like peaches, but I had alot of peaches so I decided to do something with it. I can say that the church raved about it. I took some to our pot luck.

This was my second try.  This time I used two cans of peaches instead of one, but I drained the heavy syrup from one can.  I added about 1+ teaspoons of corn starch in the liquid.  This really helped with the consistency of the dish.  Thanks for the recipe.  We love it.

Made it exactly as recipe suggested. I will never make it again. It was floating in liquid!

I made and ate it. I sprinkled a little nutmeg and cinnamon into the batter mix. I was worried when the batter sank to the bottom on the mixture, but it baked up. Delicious and awesome recipe

I followed the recipe exactly. The taste is great! I had to cook it  for about 30 mins more than the recipe said because the crust  wasn't completely done.

It's amazing.  I would definitely add more peaches to it though.  I made it with fresh peaches, so no heavy syrup added to the mixture.  Tasted fabulous.

I followed this recipe for the most part. I did accidentally grab the extra large size can of peaches, and had to eyeball approximately what half of the can would equal to fit this recipe. It's possible I added too much of the heavy syrup from the can into the recipe as the end product had quite a thin liquid consistency that I don't really care for. The taste is amazing and the breading is outstanding. I just wish the peach liquid was more thick. Perhaps cornstarch might thicken it a bit. I did sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of white sugar over the top of the cobbler before baking, and that ended up with a beautiful crispy crust on top. I will make this again for sure.

I used peaches in light syrup instead of heavy syrup and it didn't come out as thick as I would have liked. If I were to do it again I would either reduce how much of the syrup I include or eliminate it all together. I also included fresh cherries. Tasted great but the cherries made the peaches turn red so it looked funny.

I have tried approx 4-5 different peach cobbler recipes in search of a cobbler similar to what my mom made when I was younger. This is by far the closest I have come and it was very easy to make.
