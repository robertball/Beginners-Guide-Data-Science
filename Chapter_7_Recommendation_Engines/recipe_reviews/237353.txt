My original way of making egg salad sandwiches just went out the window!! This is a fantastic recipe with a nice twist of avocado to it. I was looking for something a bit more than traditional and I found it, very tasty as well. I doubled the recipe and with that I added two tablespoons of olive oil mayonnaise ( only because I like it with it, recipe does NOT, need it, for I tried it with out the mayo also). I also added just a splash, splash only  of lemon juice to keep avocado from browning as it chilled. This recipe is a definite keeper. LOVE IT. Thank you for posting it. Tip keep the pit of the avocado with the finished salad and the keeps from browning too,,,

Fixed a half batch of this for my lunch.  It was delicious.  I mixed it up the night before so the flavors had all night to meld.  Loved the crunch of the celery and onion in this egg salad.  I had this with crackers and stuffed a stalk of celery.  A great lunch option that I will be making again.  Thanks, Karen S. for sharing your recipe.

I doubled the recipe (so I have some for leftovers, including lunches at work), and made this for supper tonight. It tastes pretty good! I would make it again!

I will probably continue to sub avocado for mayo, but the sweet relish was not good in this recipe. I tried a splash of lemon, a little garlic powder, a little paprika, a little fresh cilantro--basically I threw the cupboard at it to add a little flavor. I'll continue to play with the recipe till I get it how I like it. I agree with the other reviewers that this is quite bland, but I don't miss the  mayo.

Th is was great. I did fry up the onions for 3-5 minutes and then let cool as my tummy needs onions to be cooked.  Was very yummy. Served it on top of a big slice of tomato.

I did Ms. Kansas' tweaks with double quantity, still 1 avocado, splash of lemon and mayo (I agree the mayo is not needed, I just prefer a creamier egg salad). I used Vlasic Sweet Relish and felt that the pickle sweetness was overpowering to the other flavors, so next time I'll probably try regular relish or half quantity. But definitely this recipe's a keeper - especially if you need to clear out some eggs quick out of the fridge.

This was a delicious lunch and works great as a quick in between snack if spread over a few crackers. I omitted both the relish and celery. Kept the onion and added 2 tablespoons of mustard and a little bit of garlic powder. A little salt and pepper is a must as the 2 main ingredients would be bland without. I put it on a sandwich with some tomato’s and basil leaves...Magnifiquè...
P.S. Next time I would add one more egg to balance out the avacado

I was looking for a way to enjoy egg salad without all the fat from mayo, and I've found it, although I'll make a few changes next time. I followed the recipe exactly, and found (like others) it was a little bland --- going to try a little more onion next time, or a touch more salt. Will likely also omit the sweet relish next time, as I didn't feel it added much to it.

I couldn't bring myself to add the relish to this as i am trying to not eat any sugar, and i just am not sure how that would go .i did however add a small squeeze of lime just for some tartness. Everything else i followed and seasoned with salt and pepper. I used 6 eggs and 1 large avacado.  Really there is no missing the Mayo. My 3 year old even loved it and thought i was fun cause of the colour.

Great recipe.  A small bit of minced red onion gave it a little extra flavour.  Thank you!

Made this because I'm trying to get more monounsaturated fats in my diet, but this was a bit too bland for me- I missed the zip and creaminess that even a tiny bit of mayonnaise would offer.
