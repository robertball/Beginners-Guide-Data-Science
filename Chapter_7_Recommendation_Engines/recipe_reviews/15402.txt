I don't own a bread machine, nor do I want one, but I've gotten pretty good at adapting bread machine recipes to make the bread by hand.  I started by warming the milk and applesauce (it is what I had so I used it) together in a measuring cup on high for about 1-2 minutes in the microwave, or until the mixture reached 115 degrees.  Then I added the yeast directly to this and let it rest for a few minutes.  I then added 1/2 C. of all-purpose flour and 1/2 C. whole wheat flour, the oats, , sugar, oil(instead of the shortening), and 3 T powdered gluten and mixed on medium for 2 minutes to a thick batter.  I then added the salt and another 1 C. of whole wheat flour and mixed for one more minute.  Then I changed to the dough hook, added the rest of the flour until kneaded about halfway, then finished kneading by hand.  I let rise for one hour, punched down, then put it in my greased bread pan and rose for about 40 minutes more (until about an inch above pan) and then baked at 350 for 35 minutes.  Yummy, soft, and great texture, great for sandwiches!!!  I will use this one again!  This is a good recipe even if you don't own a bread machine!

THis was very good.  I made as directed, except I used applesauce instead of apple juice because I didn't have any juice.
turned out great.

Lots of texture, very soft, a bit sweet - yum!  Good for dipping into some chicken noodle soup or eating plain.  I put it in my bread machine and set it for a medium loaf; the bread came out really light and rose up almost over the pan.  This is truly one of the best breads I have made with my machine.

No one in my family (2 adults, 3 adult children, 2 inlaw people; one infant, too, and one on the way, but both of them are still too young to "weigh in" on either Oatmeal or anything else! LOL) likes Oatmeal, but EVERYONE in my family likes Oatmeal bread. And this is a VERY GOOD recipe. Like at least 1 other reviewer, I don't own a bread making machine (never have). But using the ingredients stipulated and "working" the loaves in the same way I've always done (punching it down twice, letting it rest between "punches" and then kneading the hey out of it), I got 2 very nice sized, very tasty, loaves out of the recipe. Oh, yeah, I used "Old Fashioned" Oats rather than "Quick Cooking" and we all enjoyed the little bit more CRUNCH that afforded.

Four stars because I altered the recipe a bit. This is a *great* sandwich bread. Fine crumb and slices easily, I love it.  I don't have a bread machine, so I made this the old fashioned way. Used 1.5 cups graham flour, 1.5 cups bread flour, and regular rolled oats. After I placed it in a greased bowl to rise, I covered it and put it in the fridge overnight. Then in the morning I punched it down, shaped it into a loaf, put in a greased loaf pan, and let rise another hour. Then baked at 350 for 30 minutes. The overnight rise was great - it made the oats dissolve into the bread and it's not 'chunky' if you know what I mean.

This was so good! My whole family enjoyed it and we liked it even more than the top rated oatmeal bread on this site. I'll be using this from now on - it's perfect with dinner and kept well the next day. Thanks!

I've made this a few times.  I put it on the dough cycle and then use my oven after letting it rise in the loaf pan for 30 min. or so.  Very light, tasty bread. Thanks!

5 stars all the way.  I put this on the dough cycle of my bread machine, then shaped and let it rise about 40 minutes.  Didn't want to open up a whole carton of apple juice, so opted for applesauce instead.(Thanks to those of you who mentioned using it)  I would never have thought of using the applesauce, so I learned something today!  Will most definitely use this recipe again; the taste is so very good.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Really tasty-slightly sweet but not too much. Had a hard time putting down the loaf. Had to switch out the apple juice for a mixed berry - it's what I had on hand - and it was still great. I chose this recipe because it used all purpose flour and I was out of bread flour but I was not disappointed at all. Will make again and again.

Nothing special about this bread.  Turned out a little dry and crumbly.

I used 4 T. dry milk and water in lieu of milk, 2 T. margarine, 3 c. bread flour and 2 t. bread machine yeast.  Being impatient, I added 1 T. water which caused the top to deflate!  I would try this recipe again and be a bit more patient before adding additional water.

Pretty tasty ... the center of my bread collapsed in the bread maker - I probably just need to adjust the ingredients a bit next time.

Very good-- I made the dough in my machine and then let rise for an hour and baked.  I had an apple to use up, so I added one medium shredded apple to the mixture, and it was nice and moist, not too sweet.  The bread was great for chicken salad sandwiches.

Love this.  I make it with wheat flour and add cranberries and walnuts in the final kneading stage.  It's super dense and SO delicious!

This bread is great!  I didn't make any substitutions and family loved having a nice piece with dinner every night with a splat of butter.  GREAT!

It tasted great but it fell while baking. The only thing i changed was using bread flour instead of AP flour.
