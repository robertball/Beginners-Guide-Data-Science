This recipie was super easy and yummy!  I made it for lunch and it was perfect!  I also added a tomato to liven it up a bit more!  Be sure to used plenty of lemon pepper for more taste!

Pretty tasty, though I did take some liberty with the recipe.

I used a mix of pastas, spirals, egg noodles, and whole wheat egg noodles, for more of a salad feel. 

I cooked the broccoli in a separate pan with a thin layer of water. I never boil veggies because it leeches the nutrients.

I used most of a fresh lemon and a liberal amount of pepper on the chicken as it cooked in a separate pan. 

When I mixed it all together it still wasn't strong enough so I added a great deal more pepper, lemon, salt, some fresh cilantro, and a healthy dose of olive oil. Now that's tasty! 

Next time I'll try cooking the broccoli and chicken in the same pan for a while to mix flavors.

I thought that this salad was pretty bland. I had to add a lot of salt and seasoning to it to make it flavorful.  I liked that it was pretty easy, though.

This was an awesome summer salad.  It was very refreshing. I added peas, shredded carrots and cherry tomatos as well to add a crunch.  I recieved many compliments on this salad.  I also added fresh lemon juice to the dressing.

I like it too. I cooked everything separate for 10 minutes then combined in a large bowl with marinara.  Prep time: 15 min; Cook time: 10 min

- Broccoli (cut in small florets)
- Chicken breasts (seasoned with Lemon Pepper)
- Pasta (Barilla farfalle)
- Warmed some Marinara  while slicing the chicken into small chunks. 

Throwing everything into the bowl, and mix with serving utensils. 

Bonus: Serve with garlic bread.

Once you've added your seasoning and oil to taste, I think this is REALLY good.  But you do have to like pepper or forget it.  Also, add halved cherry tomoates for color or other veggie of coice.  Suggest using tricolored pasta for color if no tomatoes available.

I chopped the raw chicken into bite-sized pieces, sprinkled liberally with lemon-pepper (aka use lots!) and added fresh chopped garlic and salt.  Fast and easy, but missing something.

I used olive oil instead of canola oil.  I also added a bit of red pepper flakes and fresh avocado.  Next time will add bacon as well. Overall very tasty simple light summer recipe.

This was pretty good, but not fantastic since it was a bit of a simple recipe. Still, I enjoyed it over two days. I made it exactly as written, but I paused to think about how to cook the chicken (the recipe was a little vague). I thought of poaching, then I just pan-fried the chicken breast halves on medium heat, with some vegetable oil cooking spray in the pan. It took a while to ensure the middle was no longer pink, so the outside was a bit browned (which I liked). A lot of my broccoli florets were kind of large, so I cut them into two or three pieces. I'd also never used lemon pepper before, so I got some just for this recipe. Since there wasn't really a dressing in this salad, just a little oil, the lemon pepper added a nice flavor to the mix. This was nice, and it's worth making again sometime, but it didn't wow me.
