I didn't have vanilla yogurt nor a lime, so I substituted lime yogurt instead and it was delicious.

This was pretty good and a nice variation from traditional chicken salad.  I did use only a 1/4 cup of yogurt and then added a 1/2 cup of Miracle Whip.  The chicken was herb-roasted from the night before and this added a wonderful flavor.  I would definitely make this again.  I served it in lettuce wraps.

Was Ok. One would think with the snappy ingredients that the flavor would be more bold. Might need more ginger/lime, etc.

Mixed reviews at our house: I would recommend using very high-quality yogurt, as it is a predominant flavour.  The combination and volume of yogurt and mayonnaise can be a bit much for some people, but the snow peas and chicken go well together.

Very Good!  I used the dressing from another salad in Allrecipes, Sesame Pasta Chicken Salad.  It is a sweet and sour type dressing.  I will definitely fix this again.

Wow, this probably IS the best chicken salad I've ever had! I used green onion instead, and I used lime juice instead of the zest. I suggest adding a bit more lime if you like; I did and it turned out really nice!

This was a hit at my house. We added radishes instead of water chestnuts due to them not being available in my area. I used plain yogurt instead of vanilla. The falavours were delicate and fresh. I ended up doubling the ginger and lime zest but it was delicious as written. Just great! Thank you Barrett for your recipe, we will be using it often.

This was a nice twist to the traditional chicken salad. I didn't serve it with crackers or on a sandwich. I just had it plain and tossed some crackers in it for an extra crunch. I've used water chestnuts and loved the lime zest for a kick. I do have enough for leftovers since I had half a salad.
