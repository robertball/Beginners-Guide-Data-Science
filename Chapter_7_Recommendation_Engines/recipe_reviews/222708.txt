When I saw "1 Tbsp Peanut Butter" and "2 Cups Spinach" I was quite skeptical.  But just that little bit of peanut butter really does take over the flavor of the smoothie.  Delicious!  And if you are a parent, this is a GREAT way to sneak some raw roughage into your child's diet.  Incidentally, the reviewers who use Vanilla yogurt instead of plain are right, that does enhance the taste a bit.  But I tried it both ways, and found both quite good.

I make this same smoothie every day.  Just now saw the recipe on here.  If you like PB, you'll love this - and it's packed with nutrients - like a whole meal in one :)  If you want to make it even MORE healthy, add some flax seed.

This tastes like peanut butter mostly.  I think next time I will use regular vanilla yogurt instead of greek.  It's sweeter and cost less.  It does not taste green nor can you feel any spinach in your mouth when you drink it.  I don't eat green vegetables and this is a great addition to my diet.  Kids will love it.

Disclaimer: I tweaked a touch, only b/c of what I did/not have onhand. I used fresh spinach that I froze just for this recipe, did not have the yogurt, threw in a few strawberries and used Smart Balance pb. I always add cinnamon and vanilla to my smoothies. After blending, I took a spoonful, sampled it, pulled the spoon away to look at it and said (to no one in particular) - "No way...!" This is downright yummy! I was sad when I finished it (though a bit relieved, as I was quite full!) Intended to add protein powder to it, but I couldn't find where hubby put it - will add next time (ie - tomorrow!) for the protein punch. Spinach...who would have ever guessed...?

Fabulous!  Best smoothie recipe yet with spinach.  I needed a healthy drink since I cracked my tooth in half today and can't eat anything until I get to the dentist.  It may become my new dessert. I substituted fat-free vanilla yogurt for the plain since that is what I had on hand and I think it added just the right amount of sweetness.

This is a yummy little smoothie!  I did not have a banana so I used an apple.  Worked great.  Also added 1 Tbsp of ground flax seed and used unsweetened almond milk.  I used plain greek yogurt, which I eat all the time.  If you use vanilla yogurt, keep in mind that you're adding a lot of sugar.

This is my go-to green smoothie. I add a scoop of my vanilla protein powder and love it. Sometimes I use frozen pineapple instead of banana. Also can sub almond butter for peanut butter. Super nutritious!

I also like to put 1/4 cup of oats in there, blend them before everything else (to make it powdery), then I add frozen banana, peanut butter, greek yogurt, almond milk, and spinach. Delicious!

I tasted banana and peanut butter the most. If you want spinach masked then this is the drink for you.

I've added another T of peanut butter and a scoop of chocolate protein powder.  You can also use parsley which has a milder flavour.  (My parakeets like the stems, so I have to use up the rest!)

I love this smoothie!!! i substituted frozen pineapple chunks for the frozen banana, but still used fresh banana for creaminess. I loved how the peanut butter added a depth of flavor. Wonderful as a snack or post-workout energy boost. 10/10 would make again!

I made this exactly as written, including the optional ice cubes, gave it a taste and thought it was pretty darn good as is.  However a handful of black grapes were calling out to me from the freezer asking to come to a PB&J party.  I can't imagine that a few strawberries either fresh or frozen wouldn't be very tasty as well.  :-)

Kinda tasteless the first time I had it. Which is not a bad thing cause you aren't tasting spinach. I am going to double the peanut butter next time. Another good way to add sweetness is by using vanilla almond milk rather than non fat milk

Came out a very pretty green, but it was very thin. I followed the recipe exactly, except I had run out of frozen banana and didn't know it, so I used a fresh one, so that's probably why it was so thin. The reason for only three stars wasn't the thickness, but the taste. I tried it and it reminded me of Slimfast, only with peanut butter. It had that powdery taste to it for some reason, and wasn't sweet enough. I wound up having to add some sweetener. I stuck it in the freezer, so hopefully it freezes well. I will give it another chance before I say I won't make it again.

I made this the way it's listed above (which is good) and then I changed a few things which made it great!! I use the following in place of similar items above: Almond milk, Vanilla yogurt and a small apple (instead of a banana). My teenager now asks if she can have one every day.

The perfect blend of peanut butter and banana and all the health benefits of the spinach! I froze my banana and spinach as the submitter suggested and omitted the need for ice. This is one of my favorite green smoothies.

Excellent way to get the daily value of greens! I drink one every day. I measure the yogurt (~112 grams) and spinach (~60 grams) on a scale. I also increase the peanut butter a bit to a heaping tablespoon. I occasionally add 1-2 tablespoons of chia seeds for additional fiber.

It creates 2 servings so I often half the recipe to make a single serving. I usually make it in the morning, drink half and store the rest in the fridge for lunch. It doesn't taste quite as good after storing since the banana ice cubes melt, but it's more convenient to make two servings at a time. 

Tastes great, I was surprised to see peanut butter in the recipe but it really does a lot to mask the spinach taste and the ingredients all go well together

I made it as written and it was surprisingly good. I thought the peanut butter with the spinach would be weird but it was really good.

Made according to recipe, very nutritious and low in calories, but not as flavorful as I like my smoothies to be.  I put it back in the blender and added some vanilla, cinnamon, dates, and avocado for a little more flavor and creaminess.

Delicious. Almost hard to believe it's healthy! Next time I'm cutting down or cutting out the peanut butter to reduce the fat. Might replace it with honey or agave nectar.

Totally delicious--creamy and thick. I added vanilla protein powder. Also heeded advice to liquefy the spinach, yogurt & milk first before adding the banana and peanut butter; this kept me from adding too much milk & ensured the spinach had no oversized bits. I've eaten this for breakfast 3 days straight! Now I need more bananas...

For an even healthier boost, add 1 tsp pure unsweetened cocoa powder, 1/2 tsp of turmeric, 1 tsp of chia/flax seeds. I also added to mine grade B maple syrup and kale instead of the spinach. I also use organic whole milk yogurt.

Finally a green smoothie recipe we like! Super versatile to switch up ingredients  as long as  you add that peanut butter & banana. I swapped spinach for kale (which is even harder to mask in a smoothie!), added a handful of grapes, a handful of frozen strawberries,  a spoonful of applesauce, etc. Every time it turned out great & my two year old called it "ice cream." I've already shared this with several moms. Thanks for the recipe!

I made it with almond milk, and about one cup of spinach and no added ice (because my blender was too small).  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, and I really like it.  It's creamy, smooth, and very filling.  It tastes a lot like a peanut butter banana smoothie.  The spinach doesn't interfere.  I'll definitely make it again.

Made this recipe today and it was delicious! I was surprised by how filling the smoothie is. The only substitute I made was using unsweetened almond milk in place of the dairy milk. I will definitely be making this again! I am shocked you couldn't taste the spinach at all.

To cut the calories I use about 1/2 c. almond milk + 1/2 c. water in place of the milk and PB2 powder instead of traditional peanut butter. I usually throw in some flax/chia too. This is a tasty and filling meal replacement!

Delicious!  And it provided me with protein and calcium from the milk and yogurt and a serving of greens plus protein from the peanut butter.

The peanut butter overwhelms it. I think I also made a mistake by using Kroger brand vanilla yogurt... SO MUCH SUGAR! It wasn't terrible... I mean, I finished it and I didn't hate myself, but it wasn't tasty. I'll try again tomorrow sans peanut butter.

Really, really good. A perfect balance of ingredients. The peanut butter is almost an aftertaste more than anything. The spinach is simply creamy and colourful. I used coconut milk instead of milk so I got a bit of coconut taste which I like. This is a definite keeper. Thank you for the recipe.

This was tasty, and I will make it again.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5?  Pretty high calorie count.

I've never tried a "green smoothie" before and I loved this. I used unsweetened almond milk and sunflower seed butter because that's what I had. I'd like it a little colder so I think I'll include the ice cubes next time. Very tasty!

I'm just starting my path into healthier eating, so I proceeded with caution. I varied the recipe with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter, organic vanilla flavored soy milk, 1 mint leaf, and about 1/4 of a cup of orange juice. Oh. My.

Surprisingly really good! Didn't expect the PB to over power the spinach but it really does. I use just almond milk though, no yogurt or regular milk, and it still came out delicious!

Made my own dairy-free changes and this smoothie recipe came out great!
I used vanilla soy milk and simply omitted the yogurt. None of the flavors are overwhelmingly strong - there's a slight spinach flavor (despite the very green color) and you can taste the peanut butter even more, but overall, the flavors just come together really well.

I think that my yogurt brought a strange flavor to this smoothie. It did taste mainly of peanut butter and banana, but it also had a strange sour flavor. I might try it again with different yogurt.

Delicious! The peanut butter does mostly mask all the other flavors. My 16 month old son loved it too. I served it in a sippy cup that he couldn't see through, since he is getting pickier about trying new things.

We loved this recipe! My husband and I are trying to eat healthier, but he is not fond of vegetables. He was pleasantly surprised that this tasted so good and was healthy. He can't eat banana's so I substituted it with a pear. I used lite vanilla yogurt since that's what we had. Overall, this was very good and is a keeper!

I loved this.  Never thought of putting peanut butter in a green smoothie, but it works really well.  I kept to the recipe, except my banana wasn't frozen.  Still worked fine.  Used Greek yogurt which I'm sure helped thicken it.  The amount of peanut butter is just right; it's subtle, but you can definitely tell it's there.  Very good smoothie that I'll be making often.

This was so delicious!  My one year old chugged hers down!  I chopped up my banana first and froze it with the spinach.  I didn't add ice because I wanted it a little more liquidy for my daughter.  Next time I think I'll a little extra peanut butter

I only gave it 4 stars because I am going to add an additional TBLS of reduced fat peanut butter. It's my first green smoothie. I used kale rather than spinach as I like the flavor better.

This was my first official green shake (with spinach) and I loved it! I did, however, make a few changes. Instead of fat-free, I used the better (and healthier) whole milk and whole-milk yogurt, vanilla flavored. I also used "power greens" instead of pure spinach, but the mix is mostly made up of spinach anyway. You can find it at Whole Foods. 

I was very skeptical, but after the first sip I knew I would be making these as often as possible!

I've been making this smoothie at least 3 times a week since I first tried it. I made it for my dad, mom and son, and they all like it without the peanut butter better. I like it with and without:) Great way to get veggies into diet.

This recipe is great! I made it for my husband after he had dental work done and couldn't eat solid food. It's a great way to get a vegetable in liquid form while still tasting great. I usually do not care for spinach but I drink this smoothie too and don't taste the spinach at all. It tastes very good--a great healthy snack for kids too who are picky eaters.

It's pretty good! This was our first smoothie...we got a new blender! My 3 year old had a few sips and said it was good but didn't want to finish her cup. My 1 year old LOVED it!! She drank it up so fast! We used vanilla yogurt instead of plain for a little more sweet.

Ok one word...YUM, ok I did not follow her recipe at all except as a starting point, but still sooooo good.  My mom told me about these 'green smoothies' last year and i thought "oh, mom you are gross!"  but now with PB and banana I am a believer!  Thanks!!

I thought this was an interesting smoothie. I made a 1/2 recipe and I still got close to 1.5 cups adding the optional ice. I did think it tasted mostly of yogurt and peanut butter. I couldn't really taste the banana. The only change I made, was using vanilla yogurt because I didn't have plain.
