I've made this 3 times in the last 2 weeks. These are very good & pretty but the recipe is wrong in 2 ways. First, 1" balls would make a LOT more than 36 balls. I'd say mine were 1 1/2 " & made 40-44. Secondly, it takes a lot longer than the time given to finish these! HINT: Use a heaping regular teaspoon & another teaspoon to aid in scooping out the warm mixture.  Scoop from the sides 1st. Scoop a few at a time onto wax paper to cool enough to shape.  To add a bit of color after rolling in confectioner's sugar,  I dipped the tops in melted butter then colored sugar.
