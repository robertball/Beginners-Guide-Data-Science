I'm one of those people who likes my ribs made a certain way (in the smoker) with certain seasonings, so I was a little skeptical that these would be good. I've had bison before (roasts and burgers), but never had bison ribs, so I was excited to try them. The sauce was flavorful and very different than what I'm used to having with ribs. It was a nice change of pace! The ribs were somewhat tender, yet slightly hard to get off the bone. I marinated the ribs for about 6 hours. I will definitely make this recipe again, however next time I will cook the ribs in the smoker and serve them with the sauce. The sauce was very citrusy (I used freshly squeezed OJ) and reminded me of something you'd eat in the fall. This would be a perfect meal for a warm fall day. Make sure you grill over indirect heat or else the sauce will burn and the bones will turn black.  I didn't need to brush the ribs with extra sauce while they were grilling.

This was my first taste of bison and I invited some friends to give it a whirl also.  It was a wonderful evening with everyone enjoying these delicious ribs.  I followed the recipe exactly, marinated the ribs the full 24 hours.  The general consensus was the marinade/sauce needed a little heat, but they were still very tasty and everyone was looking forward to having them again.  It was a great evening with great food.

I used this for pork and beef ribs - it was amazing!  I was nervous about boiling the meat first but it made grilling the meat so much easier with no burning.
