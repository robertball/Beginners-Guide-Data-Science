Really easy.  Was looking for a way to quickly make some chicken for dinner. Did NOT make the teriyaki sauce, used a jarred sauce I already had.  Chicken was falling apart.  The sauce is thin, but made a delicious addition to the rice.

This made an easy, quick meal. It  could have used a little more flavor, and the sauce was very thin even after sauteeing five minutes.
