First, these are very good cookies.  But after reading the other reviews I made the following changes; I substituted half the butter for margarine and added 1/2 tea. salt.  I also used old-fashioned rolled oats.  And I baked for 11 minutes and cooled on rack for 1-2 minutes.  My cookies did not spread ... they were about 2 inches in diameter after baking.  I did get a little over 4 dozen.  Very very good cookies!  Thank you for sharing!

These were good.  If I made them again I would make sure that the toffee bars were in large chunks.  I used toffee bits and I think the toffee was a bit lost in the finished cookie.

This is a very good recipe for a chewy oatmeal cookie, I partially flattened some for a crisp cookie. My husband and neighbors went wild for them.

This is an excellent cookie!  I followed the directions except for I added a 1/2 teaspoon of salt and I used four Skor bars that I crushed.  It is true you really cannot taste the toffee but it definitely gives dimension to the cookie that it would not otherwise have.  I also plumped the raisins in water before adding to the recipe.  A+!

A huge hit!  When I went to add the toffee bits, I was surprised to see that I had cinnamon chips instead.  I added them anyway and the cookies were fantastic!  Next time, I will make sure I have toffee bits and try them that way!

After reading the reviews I did change the recipe a little. Instead of 1 cup butter, I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening. I also added 1/2 tsp salt. I used a 8oz bag of Heath Toffee Bits and quick cooking oats. My cookies did not spread or stick to the parchment paper. I only let them cool for 3 minutes on the cookie sheet before moving them onto a cooling rack. I will definitely make these cookies again. But I will increase the rasins to 1 1/2 cups.

Incredible!!!! I did not find the toffee bits disappeared at all. I chilled the dough first to minimize spreading. The butter makes these! I don't recommend skimping it will affect the texture

These were great!  I don't know if I made them a little larger than in the recipe, but I found they needed to bake for closer to 13 minutes, instead of the 8-10 called for.

Also, I couldn't find plain toffee bits, so I tried these with the chocolate covered toffee bits, and got rave reviews on them.  I will definitely add this to my cookie recipes.

This recipe is a hit every time.  They always turn out soft and chewy, never hard and dry.  There are no changes needed.

Probably the best oatmeal raisin cookies I ever made. Moist and tasty. Everyone loved them. However, I needed to up the cooking time to about 12 minutes.

I always read the reviews before making a recipe and I agree with everyone, you need to add 1/2 tsp. of salt. The only thing I did differently from the recipe other than the salt was added golden raisins.  I believe that this is a very versatile recipe and you could add just about anything and it would still come out delicious.  I like using a cookie scoop for uniform shaped cookies.

I made this recipe for a church organization ceremony and everyone loved it.  Most liked the fact it was chewy, some thought it had coconut in it??  I don't care for raisins, so added chopped pecans, instead.  I am making this again for a couple of other occasions.  Delicious  cookies!

Great Recipe!  I baked these just as directed.  My whole family gobbled them up!  After reading the other reviews I was worried that they would spread out on the pan when baking so I did refrigerate the dough overnight before baking. (which is something I usually do anyway because the cookies just taste better if they 'rest' first.  (glutens mixing and so forth..))  But they were great.  Looked great and tasted great!

These are GREAT.  I definitely suggest buying actual Skor candy bars and breaking them down [I put them in ziplocks, covered with towel, and hit with a hammer.. very therapeutic!  Haha] that way you get a lot more toffee taste ad delicious chunks of it!  I've tried different variations of ingredients like replacing the raisins with a cup of chocolate chips, but they ended up too rich for my taste [but chocolate lovers LOVED them].  Try keeping the raisins and adding a 1/2 C of white chocolate chips!  Overall GREAT recipe.

I added 1/2 tsp of salt.  Instead of toffee, I used i pkg. of choc chips, and old fashioned oats.  They were great!  Took 11-13 min to bake.  Cool on rack.

These were good cookies for the holidays.  I don't think they were outstanding because you couldn't taste the toffee flavor that well.

These are by far some of the best cookies I have ever baked. Quick, easy and truly yields 48 as it says (I even made mine fairly large). 

I sent some to a neighbour to thank her for an emergency vanilla loan and her husband said they reminded him of some his mom used to make! Compliments dont get much better than that!

This cookies disappear everytime I make them. I did take the advice and I have put the raisins in water to let them plump before using them in the batter. 
SO yummy!

These were very good cookies even though I really couldn't taste the toffee. The only change I made was adding a 1/2 tsp of salt. Everything else I kept the same and my cookies did not come out flat at all. I made the dough and baked it right away. They did bake for about 11-12 mins.

Delicious cookie!  I used Hershey's Milk Chocolate Toffee bits and it worked out great.  You won't really be able to taste the toffee but the cookie is still pretty good.  For nice chewy cookies, refrigerate at least for 1 hour and bake for 10 minutes.  I will definitely make these again.

Made these tonight. I followed the recipe exactly however I didn't really care for them. They weren't bad but they feel like something is missing. If I make these again I would add some salt and some allspice.

Darn, these are good!  I used Crisco in lieu of butter, added 1/2 teaspoon salt, and used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour plus one cup regular flour.  I push the dough into a small ice cream scoop (maybe 2 tablespoons) which simplifies consistent size, and baked 15 minutes.  They did not spread, so may fiddle with the recipe a bit next time I make them (and there WILL be a next time!).

These are my husband's favorite cookies! They have all of his favorite cookie ingredients: oats, dried fruit, spices and toffee. I added 1/2 tsp of salt, and used dried fruit bits, since that's what I had on hand. Seriously delicious! They needed 10 minutes in my convection oven. At 8 minutes they were still under-cooked, even after they sat on the hot cookie sheet for a few minutes. I've added the recipe to my family favorites! Thanks for a winner! Update: We had to pause our TV show so we could fill our craving and bake these cookies. We were out of toffee chips, so we used butterscotch. Delicious!

This has to be one of the best oatmeal raisin cookies I have ever had!  My family inhaled them!  After reading previous reviews, I did make the following adjustments:  Instead of 1c. butter I used 1/2c. butter and 1/2c. butter flavored Crisco, 1/2t. salt, 1 1/2c. raisins, and an 8 oz. package of toffee bits.  I changed quantities of a few ingredients but used the basic recipe! I will definitely make these cookies again!

Very, very good. Perfect texture. I used what i had left of a bag of heath toffee bits, so not a whole cup. I would like to try it with chocolate covered toffee bits next time. I don't think it really needs the raisins, but that's just personal perference.

Best oatmeal cookies I've ever made! I've substituted raisins for cranberries in one batch, and olso toffee for butterscotch chips in another batch. It is a very flexible recipe if you want to mix it up! They are always moist and chewy and I use Splenda for the sugar and the Splenda Brown sugar blend for the brown sugar! YUMMY

this is a very tasty cookie,  Next time I make it though I will reduce the butter to 3/4 cup since the toffee has quite a bit of butter already.  They were really hard to get off the cookie sheet and the cookies had no real substance so if we might want to increast the all-purpose flour up to 1 3/4 cups.  I used crumbs from our famous Enstroms toffee candy.

These are so wonderful! I just pulled the second tray out of the oven and the first batch is already gone! It is hard to tell the toffee pieces are in there but I think if they weren't the cookie would really be lacking alot of its taste. This was one of my husbands favorites so far. I used golden raisins, since thats all i had and they were great.

Substituted chopped walnuts for the raisins.  The crunchy nutty flavor was a delicious contrast to the oats and toffee sweetness!

I made these yesterday and they were fantastic!  I was out of raisins so I left them out.  I also added 1/2t of salt because I think all cookie recipes need salt.  My family and my daughter's friend devoured these cookies, they're gone already!  And we actually liked them so much without the raisins that I think I'll leave them out next time too.  Awesome recipe for a chewy, delicious cookie.

Barely a hint of toffee made these amazing!  I used quick oats instead because that's all I had.  They were a little flat but still soft and tastey!!

made according to recipe but what I got was a chewy cookie that spread out too flat, was too sweet to taste all the wonderful flavors and fell apart when removing from the cookie sheet. By increasing the flour to 2 cups, decreasing the sugar and toffee and chopping the toffee into larger chunks, I got a wonderful cookie that looks and tastes great.

Very moist, nice chewy texture, great for adding whatever mix-ins you prefer. I didn't have enough butter so I only used three quarters of a cup, kept everything else in same proportions, very flavorful. I also used what I had on hand to mix into dough - dried cranberries and Heath bar toffee bits, yum. I added a dash each of nutmeg and cloves because I like those flavors with the oatmeal. Baked at 350 for 8 minutes and let cool on pan for two to three minutes. No problems with flat cookies nor with sticking to the pan! Highly recommended.

A very nice cookie. Unfortunately my toffee chips were old and I did not realize it and they gave the cookies a very bad taste.  I had to discard the whole bunch! So make sure to smell the toffee pieces first and don't add if they smell the least bit off! I will try this recipe again with fresh toffee pieces!

My favorite type of cookie is oatmeal raisin and this recipe unseated my mother's cookies.  I love this recipe.  I haven't changed anything on the recipe - I use a bag of the Heath toffee bits.  Yes, they do melt into the cookie, but they add sweetness and texture.  Thanks for sharing!

Very Good Recipe!  I am on my third cookie. I changed a few things:  I did not use raisins and used an 8 oz bag of Heath English Toffee Bits for the toffee.   Definitely will make again.  I am taking some to the bus to give to neighbors.

I just made this recipe. Upon other reviews I decided to do half butter and half Becel. I also cut back on the sugar (3/4 C brown and 1/4 C white). And since my husband doesn't like raisins I did not add them. These cookies turned out great! Very chewy and yummy.

Awesome!  I am not a fan of raisins in cookies, but added them anyway b/c my family likes them.  They were delicious-raisins and all!  I am at a higher altitude and therefore modified the recipe a little.  I reduced the white sugar to a shy 1/8 cup.  Also, I increased the flour to closer to 1 3/4 cup.

Hmm, I wasn't quite as excited about these as others, but they are good cookies.  I made just as directed, and used parchment paper on my pan.  Even though I generally like my cookies a little underbaked, I still found that I needed to bake these much longer than stated on the recipe.  They flattened more than I would have liked, and were a little difficult to get off of the sheet in one piece.  Like others have said, you don't really encounter actual toffee bits in the cookies - they sort of just melt into the cookie and add an extra sweetness.  Maybe I'm used to using quick oats in cookies, but the rolled oats almost added too much of a raw, nutty flavor for my taste - at least for a cookie.  I might make these again, but I'll still be trying other oatmeal raisin recipes too.

Absolutely fabulous recipe. I looked at all the reviews and considered some of the changes proposed but didnt end up changing it at all!
I used Heath toffee bits, and I think more than the flavour it helped tremendously to get the perfect texture for the cookies, crisp tops and chewy light insides. I also smooshed them a bit on the pan before baking so they would spread. 
Apart from that the only thing I did was soak the raisins in hot water at the start of making the recipe and until I added them in. I might use more raisins for next time but thats just a personal preference

Good cookie.  Like others I lost the toffee bits.  I could not taste them.  It was just an oatmeal raisin cookie.  I did have to bake mine 12 minutes.  If your going to add something in addition to the raisins I would suggest chip size.

These are great oatmeal cookies.  I added 1/2 tsp salt and used 5 Heath bars, broken into large chunks, for my toffee and I refrigerated my dough for over an hour before cooking.  That may have been key in keeping them from spreading too much because they did spread, even being chilled.  I'll make these again for sure.

I didn't change a thing, only that my toffee bits had chocolate in them, but how can chocolate be a bad thing? 
I let them in the oven until the edges stated to brown (12 minutes in my oven) because I like cookies to be just slightly crisp but chewy.

Made these cookies but incorporated suggestions from some of the other recipes on this site, such as: added 1/2 tsp. ginger and 1/2 tsp. cloves, used quick cooking oatmeal in place of rolled oats, added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and another tsp. cinnamon.  Couldn’t find toffee bits so used cup of salted caramel chips.  When all the ingredients were mixed, the dough seemed awfully dry.  Had a little problem getting the pecans mixed in at the end.  We like soft cookies.  As dry as the dough was I was afraid the cookies would turn out dry and crumbly.  Looks like my fear was well founded.  When the cookies are cool I think we’ll have a good supply of dunkers... but they’re tasty dunkers.  Note:  Recipe is missing instructions for when to stir in the raisins.

Good basic recipe, but it needs 1/2 tsp. salt.  Extra-thick rolled oats enhance the flavor and texture of these.

Love this recipe!  Best oatmeal cookies I ever made.  The only change I made was replacing the raisins with chocolate and butterscotch chips.  Also used a cookie scoop to pack the dough into tight balls to prevent too much spreading.  You could probably also roll them into balls before baking.  So good!

I wanted to make them and couldn't find then the toffee pieces so I used  chocolate chips. They were excellent.  I have to find toffee and they will perfect. They are not too sugary how oatmeal cookies can be some times.

I loved this cookie!!! It will be a regular in my cookie baking for certain!  I did add 1/2 tsp of salt to the dry ingredients.  I always feel a bit of salt brings out the best flavor in sweets!  Keep the dough chilled and  bake on parchment  lined sheets for a perfect cookie!!!

Great cookie. The only substitution was replacing the raisins with walnuts (I ran out of raisins). Next time I will make sure I have raisins. I got 5 dozen cookies from this recipe and my family and friends devoured them! This is a keeper.

Lemme do you a favor:  use parchment paper!!!  After two batches on a greased aluminum baking sheet I finally got the bright idea to use parchment and it was a revelation!  The cookies held their shape better and cooked more evenly, and they slid off like a dream.  These are very, very sweet, rich cookies.  They are delicious but very sweet.  Still, for a treat, they are fabulous!

I thought these were too sweet. I wanted a flatter cookie so I decreased the brown sugar 1/2 c and white sugar to 3/4 c. Helped some. I did add 1/2 salt. For my oven (that is gas, and a year old) I found if I did not bake the cookies for at least 15 min at 350 they fell apart. Pretty good tasting cookies, maybe a little bit more salt and cinnamon.

These were excellent cookies, I made then exactly as the recipe was written. I baked them for 8 mins, they spread perfectly. I let them sit on the cookie sheet for 4-5 mins. Now it's 2 days later and they are still chewy and delicious! Thank you for this recipe!

Addictive cookies.  We like best if you leave out the raisins and I bet would be divine if you added mini chocolate chips.

Delicious, by far the best use of the toffee pieces to date.  The cookies are flat, chewy, and some parts are even a bit crispy.  All the things a good cookie should be.

These cookies are definitely delish. I will probably add 2 tsp of cinnamon and a little bit more sugar. Next time, I will add chocolate chips. I will be making these again!!

These cookies are great!  I passed them around to my neighbors during the Thanksgiving holidays.  Now I'm getting requests for them.  I added a little salt too.  Used Heath Bars...froze them for a bit and chopped them in the food processor.

I have made these for the Family and for the people at my shoulder rehab and they were a great hit with all who ate them. The 1 thing I do different is I grind the toffee candy almost to powder to betterdistribute throughout the mix and also th create a crispy toffee bottom to the cookie.

This recepie is definitely a great last minute desert idea as well. I had my uncle and aunt over for dinner and had the cookies and some strawberry ice cream for desert. They took the rest of the cookies home! A few helpful hints: use a toffee bar and break it up in chunks. Also, please use the 1/2 teaspoon of salt as suggested in other posts and leave the dough in your refrigerator overnight. The cookies seem to come out even better

Good... actually didn't have toffee bits, so I threw in chocolate chips and vanilla chips. My coworkers gobbled them up!

I love love love this recipe and so does everyone else! I just wish I could get them to not be flat. I did alter the recipe just a bit. Instead of 1 cup butter I did 1/2 c butter and 1/2 cup shortening. I also added more raisins and Heath bar pieces. DELICIOUS!!

Cookies were okay. next time I will add more toffee bites and allow the butter to soften over night. The cookies did not spread out properly.

These were pretty good, but I wish I would have read the reviews first and subbed 1/2 of the butter for margarine.  My cookies spread ALOT and aren't the prettiest finished product.  However, the taste factor is there & I guess that's the most important part.  Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies are the best. Everyone who tried them loved them but could not figure out what was in them to make them so great. I prefer oatmeal choc. chip vs. raisin cookies because of my giant sweet tooth but these have taken my old recipe's place!

These turned out to be GREAT cookies.  I took the advice of others and used half butter and half margarine.  I also added the 1/2 tsp of salt.  I then looked in my baking drawer and saw I had some vanilla chips so I thought I would throw a handful of those in as well.  These were GREAT!!!!!!  Thank you for the recipe!!!

I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but I haven't been able to make any kind of Oatmeal Raisin cookies turn out right in my last 5 or 6 attempts. I thought I'd try these because the toffee part sounded good. I actually used crushed up Werthers Original candies...you can definitely taste them in the cookie, but they kinda spread out to the edges and stuck to the cookies sheet.  They probably would be good, but as usual my cookies turned out very flat and sticky and a lot of them fell apart when I tried to get them off the pan. I'm blaming myself, not this recipes. Any pointers on why my cookies are flat??

Used a bit too much butter & the 1st 2 pans had spread very thin & crumbly so small tin foil pie pans with side up higher the batter stayed put better. Makes a lot of dough, skor chocolate pieces were used instead of toffee candy but they were still good!!

For the past 5 weeks, I have been making a different cookie recipe as an outreach to the high school I work with.  I made these cookies and the kids thought these were the best ever!  Just be careful not to overcook!

Excellent taste and consistency, easy prep, and quick bake time.  The boyfriend loved them! I will make this again!
