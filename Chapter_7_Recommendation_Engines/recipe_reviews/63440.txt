I've also made this with chicken and it turns out great.  Love the sweet/sour taste.  
Catalina dressing is a version of french dressing you put on a lettuce salad. I've also used Russian dressing.  These are tomato (ketchup) based (orange/red in color)...I think the catalina has a little more of a "bite" to it than the french.
I found a recipe for catalina dressing so you have some idea what the ingredients are or perhaps if you cannot find it to purchase, you can make some.

Catalina Dressing:  1 cup sugar, 2 teasoon salt, dash paprika, 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon celery seed, 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard, grated onion to taste, 1/2 cup white vinegar, 2/3 cup ketchup, 1 cup vegetable oil.  
Put all ingredients into a blender and mix.  Store in a jar in refrigerator.

I wish this site had a message board area where we could ask questions about ingredients or a process in a recipe we don't understand.

These were delicious.  My only comment is that the sauce mixture made an awful lot.  I would probably half all the ingredients for it.

Wonderful! The sauce can accomodate up to 6 pork chops nicely. We love this recipe. Such a nice change from the usual pork chop dish. We love this over a bed of white rice. If you can't find Catalina dressing, use Russian, it is close, just not quite as spicy. I also seem to have trouble finding Apricot Jam so I substitute preserves and it works just fine. I season the pork chops in salt, pepper and garlic powder prior to browning. You can add a splash of soy sauce to this if you want to. This has a nice sweet and sour taste to it, my mouth is watering just writing this!

This was wonderful. I took others advice and lowered the temp down to 350. I also used boneless pork chops. YUMMY!!

I am going to make this again and again!
So tender!!!

I made this exactly according to the recipe, except that I followed the advice of others and reduced the temperature to 350 and cooked for about half an hour. If your chops are less than a full inch thick, be sure to check them early; mine were probably closer to 3/4" thick, and I felt they were a tad bit overdone, even with the reduced temp/time. 
I couldn't find apricot jam and had to make do with preserves, but I don't really think that makes much difference. 
While the taste was a little more fiery than we usually care for, we did eat it all up in one night, and I will probably make it again. I think the Catalina dressing AND pepper together were what made it a little on the too-spicy side for us; next time I'll skip the pepper and see if it makes a difference. I may also use more apricot to make it a little sweeter.

You can alter this recipe by using a boneless pork roast instead of chops and the flavor is still wonderful.  Also, try using french dressing or fat free dressing, you will also get tasty results.  One of my favorite recipes.

My husband and I cooked this together, last night. We thought it was easy to prepare and was very tasty! We will be making this again except my husband would like to try adding some real onions into the mix. Thank you for the recipe!

Overall the recipe was good however the catalina dressing and onion soup over powers the dish. I cut back the dressing and added a little bit of onion soup mix. I love apricots so I added extra jam. I would try this again but I think I'll marinate the chops in the sauce.

This made a lot of sauce - and the apricot jam dominated the flavor. Couldn't taste the onion packet or the garlic at all.
I also recommend cooking at a lower temperature for MUCH less time. But all in all,I will not cook this again.

We grilled our chops instead of baking and they were outstanding!  I seasoned and marinated them overnite.  After grilling, I reserved some sauce and we spooned it over the meat and rice...DE-LISH!  I have 3 kids and all loved it.  The little one however, did not care for the sauce added after cooking (he thought it was too 'spicy'.  Will make again & again!  Thanks!

My huband likes bone-in and I like boneless. This was a great recipe for the both of us. I added 1/2 of a cup of chopped green peppers. It was great. It would probably be great for chicken too. I will make again soon.

I didn't use some of the main ingredients, but used the basic recipe and idea, and it came out great.  I seasoned and browned the pork chops per the recipe.  Then I mixed about 1 1/2 Tbsp of apricot pepper jelly with  1/2 tsp of garlic paste (per porkchop) and put this mixture on top of the chops before baking.  This made a very tasty sauce.

Our kids didn't much care for it...maybe it's b/c I used orange marmalade instead of apricot jam.  We may try it again with the jam instead of marmalade.

I felt this was a good recipe.  The only thing that shocked me was the nutritional information.  622 calories, and 40 + grams of carbs?? I substitued the called apricot jam with a sugar free version.  I also used low cal catalina dressing.  The taste and flavor were very good.  I am diabetic so there was no way I could have eaten it as was.  Thank you for sharing.

Very good and so simple to prepare.  I used frozen chops and a slowcooker, omitting the oil.  Put the chops in first and poured the sauce over the meat.  Cooked on low for 8 hours.

Excellent!!!  The only way these could be better is if you marinated the chops in the sauce for a few hours (which I will be doing soon)!  I halved the sauce, used 3 boneless pork loin cuts baked for 20 minutes, and served with plain white rice.  Fast, easy, and delicious!

This was really good! I didn't have any Catalina Dressing on hand so I used French Dressing and it tasted great!! I cut the sauce mixture in half (only had 3 pork chops) and it made more than enough.

Delicious, easy recipe. I followed it exactly so I could give an honest review, and if I make it again I may add/change some seasonings and proportions for my own tastes, as is normal - but if you are looking for a way to make pork chops more interesting, this is great. It's a sweet, tangy taste that you can alter depending on how much apricot vs. how much dressing you put in. My only advice is be aware that this recipe makes a lot of sauce, so you might want to alter the measurements depending on how many chops you are making. I made 6 medium-sized chops and there was plenty.

This tastes fabulous! The only reason I wouldn't give 5stars..is that unless you read the reviews..you would have shoe leather.  Luckily I read the reviews and reduced temp to 350 for 35 min. Still a bit too long, would use 350 for 25 min. (Of course I had no bone in my pork). But the flavor was awesome. We loved using the extra sauce on brown rice. And the recipe is very forgiving. I used whatever tangy tomato style dressing I had and it turned out great. Whole family gave it a thumbs up! I also would make less in a larger dish for more glazing than sauce.

This was a really good recipe, just not quite what I rank 5 star.  My kids (9,12) had to be coaxed into using the sauce over their brown rice, and then were going back for more.  My husband says 4 star and so be it!  Thanks for sharing. I made as called in the recipe...watch your meat as cooking time is largely dependent on this size of your chops.

YUMMY!  I thought I had apricot preserves but all I could find in my fridge were peach, still came out awesome.  I didn't have Catalina dressing so I googled it and made my own really fast in my blender (I just did NOT want to go to the store.)  I also forgot to add the clove of garlic but seriously, it was SO GOOD anyway!  Thank you for posting this recipe, it was so fast, easy, and tender.  Serve this to people you want to impress!  Oh, and I served it with steamed basmati rice and steamed broccoli.

My husband really liked it, but my three children did not. The kids said the sauce was too sweet, my husband had no complaint. I followed the recipe exactly, except I did change the oven temperture to 350 degrees, and baked for about 45-55 minutes or so.

I've made this twice.  The first time, I used ultra-thin boneless chops and baked 20 mins at 350 and it was pretty good.  2nd time, I used boneless 1 in. thick chops, baked 30 mins and they were terrible!!!  The sauce got oily, the chops were too dry, and there was zero flavor!  IF you make this dish, try the ultra-thin chops, it absorbs the flavor better.

I wasn't sure if I liked this recipe at first, but it definately grew on me and I did have seconds.  My husband rated it a 3 star because he didn't care for the sweetness.  I really liked the rice with it because it was great with the sauce.  I cooked mine at 350 degree for 35 minutes and the pork wasn't dried out at all.   I did enjoy this meal, but probably won't make it again because the rest of the family didn't act excited over it.

This recipe is excellent!  I used garlic salt and pepper to season the pork.  I baked it on 350 for 30 mins and used the extra sauce for a rice (other reviews had mentioned that it makes too much sauce, but I thought it was a perfect amount).  My boyfriend is a very, very finicky eater, and he loves this recipe!

Outstanding! This is the second time I've made this dish and the family raved about it again! I will definitely add this to the monthly rotation. Last time I paired it with Rice-so-Nice also found on this site. This time I made Yukon Gold mashed potatoes with steamed baby carrots in butter. Rats....no leftovers again. :-(

This is an excellent recipe, however, it should be changed.  My chops did come out tough.  The learned cooks here call for a reduction in temperature and cooking time.  There is indeed way too much sauce.  It is great sauce, but throwing away a cup and a half is simply a waste.

I think this is a truly great, quick recipe -- very, very tasty.  But PLEASE change it so that new people are not overcooking the meat.  I had a large package of chops, and I used the other half in Lemonade Chops, which were tender.

I will be making them again, but with the suggested adjustments!

After reading the reviews I decided to reduce the temperature to 350.  The result was really tasty, moist chops.  My family loves this and requests it all of the time.  A definate keeper!  Thanks for the recipe! :)

We made this tonight. It was very good. I added some soy sauce and dried onion & mushroom soup. Served it over white rice... my husband said it was "a keeper". As a newlywed, that is a big compliment!

Really good, could use a change in the cooking time and temperature, like 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes.  Sauce went really well on rice.

Wow. Fast and easy.  I used 4 boneless chops and made 3/4 of the sauce recipe.  Baked in a 9x9 pan for about 25 minutes.  This will become a staple in our house.

This was very easy to make.  My husband said it reminded him of sweet and sour pork.  Very flavorful!  However, it would have been better had the meat turned out to be a bit more moist.

What a terrific recipe! I sprinkled the chops with garlic powder, salt and pepper when browning then followed the rest of the recipe exactly. These have to be the best baked pork chops that I have ever tasted! The sauce is great over white rice. Just add salad and you've got an easy, tasty meal.

I use to cook a recipe very similar to this in Australia when I lived there, but used chicken breast and Apricot Sauce or tinned Apricots instead of apricot jam. 
With the onion soup it gives it a sweet and sour flavour. ~ Going to try it tonight for tea
Many thanks for reminding me of it. It's juicy.
(Can anyone please tell me what Catalina Salad dressing is? never seen in here in the UK)

These are delicious. To save some calories I use Polaner Apricot Preserves with Splenda and I use fat free Catalina dressing, and no one in my house can taste the difference. This recipe makes a lot of extra sauce, we usually make cous cous or rice with it to soak it up. It's also great reheated.

This was soooo good! I will certainly be using this recipe again. For a little added flavor, I sprinkled in two pinches of dried rosemary and a couple dashes of salt-free all-purpose seasoning. It certainly impressed my dinner guest, too! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Oh man this recipes was so easy and yummy!  It's very savory and tangy at the same time.  I used apricot preserves as that's what I had on hand.  Very good recipe-thanks!

I gave this three stars because I wasn't disappointed and I wasn't wowed. It was a good recipe, but I probably won't repeat it.

My family really likes this recipe, but like other reviewers I use Italian rather than Catalina dressing. It's just a taste preference. Otherwise, this is a great recipe. If you have leftovers, they're tasty heated, shredded and on bread as chicken sandwiches the next day!

A nice change to the usual pork chops.  I tried grilling them, and didn't put the sauce on until close to the end.  Unfortunately the sauce didn't stick on as well.  Next time I will try leaving the sauce on the whole time while grilling.

Taste great with a mixture of sweet and sour.  The apricots add just the right amount of sweetness and aid in the carmelization effect over the porkchops! Next time I will try boneless pork chops and will send a review!

This is a very OK dish; not bad, not spectacular.  I prefer my pork chops to have a lot more spice and flavor, but if you enjoy milder food you might like this.

I agree with the other reviewers that 350 degrees for 30 min. is the right choice for 1 inch thick boneless chops.  However, I didn't really like the taste much and neither did my husband.  Not sure what was wrong.  It was edible, but not "good".

For me, this was just okay.  We normally use this recipe for chicken, minus the garlic(Baked Apricot Chicken) which my family absolutely loves.  My kids did not care for the pork/apricot mixture, but my husband liked it....he had 3rds.  I used apricot preserves and 1/2 russian dressing, 1/2 catalina.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and baked at 350 for 30 minutes which was just right....I used boneless sirloin chops.

I really like this recipe.  I have substituted french dressing for the catalina dressing, and I don't think it makes a huge difference.

This recipe was ok - but I couldn't taste the apricot jam at all!  The flavour of the onion soup mix overpowered the flavour of everything else in my opinion.  So while it wasn't disgusting...we probably won't make this again.

Delicious.  It has a very good flavor.  I used the sugar free apricot jam.  My husband said he liked it... once in a while though... since the flavor is sweet.  I would make it again.

Sauce was more like barbecue sauce than anything and very thick. Pretty easy to make in a hurry and throw in oven. Will probably make again for something different, but will reduce oven temp. and baking time a little. They came ou too dry.

I do not understand how this recipe got such rave reviews from other users...I suppose it must be an acquired taste?   Luckily, I had leftover lasagna to feed my less-than-pleased family.  I will not even try to tweak this recipe to our liking.

Delicious! There's too much sauce, so cut the ingredients to 3/4 or 1/2 of what is recomended. I also used Apricot Preserves instead of Jam, those juicy bits of apricot really added to it.

I think cooking the meat at 400 causes it to be tough.  If I were to make it again, I would use a lower heat and cook longer.  The sauce tended to carmelize at the high heat too.  I am not sure I would make again.

Thank you EBSEPKE! My husband "swore off" pork long before I met him, but I was dying to try something new! He LOVED this dish! He's now open to trying ANY pork dish. I've prepared this with bone-in and boneless chops. Both work great, just be sure to adjust your cooking times accordingly!

I only had 2 pork chops so I halved the recipe . I also used half of the Catalina salad dressing and substituted with BBQ sauce. Only baked for 30 minutes but may reduce that 5 more minuets Overdone pork is dry Enjoyed the recipe

Thank you to everyone’s previous reviews about halving the sauce, it definitely makes a lot!   I used boneless pork cutlets, cooked at 350*F for 30 minutes.  The sauce was delicious over rice; my husband and I also think it would be good over salmon.

Absolutely simple and delicious. Had this for a Friday supper with friends and it was all gone! Served with a side of stir fry veggies stir-fried in sesame oil with a hint of cayenne, sprinkled with sesame seeds. Was a nice counterpoint to the sweeter entree.

Made this for the first time and it will for sure be a part of our dinner meals again.  I read in other reviews where it made too much sauce.  Not for us !  I served mine with rice and the sauce is so yummy that we loved it just the way it was.   A sweet/spicy meal is a nice change.   Just try it if you're on the fence - you won't regret it.

I cut the time to 30min at 350 degrees as other suggested since the chops were thin.  They cooked well and were moist.  I did think the Catalina dressing was overpowering and would cut it back next time.  I thought it was ok but my picky 6 year old loved it.

This was good. I made it as written except I used Russian dressing, and per other reviews I lowered the heat to 350 for 40 minutes. I'll make it again!

Good recipe. My husband and picky 2 year who hates pork loved it. I did add a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce, another clove of garlic and about 2 tablespoons of spicy mustard. It was awesome. Next time I am going to try it on the grill. Will defiantly make it again!

This was great! The whole family loved it. I did reduce the temp to 350. I used bone in chops. I didn't bother to brown them first, just put them in the pan poured the sauce over and stuck it in the oven. It came out wonderful. We will definitely have this again.

I was trying something different -admittedly. Too different for me, just not a flavor I liked.

These are soooo good. I am in LOVE with apricot/savory protein lately. I prefer thinner pork chops to the in-bone ones, but that's just personal preference.
