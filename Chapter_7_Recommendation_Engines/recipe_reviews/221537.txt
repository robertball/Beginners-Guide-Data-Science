WOW! This was really easy. Used avocado oil instead of butter, canned mushrooms instead of fresh (all we had on-hand). Also didn't have the mushroom soup so used onion soup mix and added about 2/3 cup of water in addition to the 1 1/4 cup of Marsala. Added a splash of Marsala wine near the end of cooking to give it a little kick! Served it over rice with a fresh salad. Delicious!!!

This  was my first time trying it. I had never made any version of chicken marsala previously, and my wife and I really loved it. I had never sauteed mushrooms until tonight. It all went well. I used chicken tenders and cooked for about 25 minutes. I tasted them after finishing them and added a little bit of garlic salt, which was a great addition. I also used 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning and more butter than the recipe mentioned. Good groceries!  Update 2/25/18. Made it again. Used a little over a tablespoon of seasoning in the flour and added garlic salt and black pepper to my taste. Also used 2 cans of the golden mushroom soup, which helped balance out the strong marsala taste. It produced a good blend between the soup and wine flavors.

I rate it five star when the amount of wine is corrected, as several have pointed out; from many other Marsala recipe's, this should be 1/4 cup, not 1 1/4 cups!
I had no Marsala, so substituted 1/4 cup of regular wine and 1 tsp of rum.  I also used canned mushrooms and regular mushroom soup.
VERY tasty - so good, in fact, that I had 3rds!!

This was simple, good and moist but I made a few
 changes.  First, I used skin on chicken thighs. I was generous with spices.  After browning I put in oven on 350 to keep warm while cooking other items.  Also, used good chicken broth thickened with corn startch for the wine mixture. Simmered for about 40 minutes. Turned out great. Thicker meat slightly increased cooking time. Surely well worth the  time.  Great week night dinner.

Quick and tasty! I used chicken breasts cut in half so I didn't have to pound them. The sauce was very tasty (I had to use half wine / half beef consomme since I didn't have enough wine). I reallllly loved the fresh mushrooms and the sauteed onions in this - they were so delicious! My son really enjoyed this dish as well.

Easy to follow recipe.  I served mine over egg noodles. I made some chicken base to mellow out the Marsala   My daughter said I needed to cook out the Marsala a little more (she is a chef). I will make this again.

This recipe had way too much wine for us. We couldn't get past the overpowering wine flavor, so we ended up dumping out all of the sauce and just keeping the chicken and mushrooms.

It had a good flavor to it. I used a dry Marsala wine, maybe next time I'll use a sweet one. Overall, it was a good leftover also

I followed the directions exactly.  It was just OK.  As written I won't make it again.  It is way too heavy on the Marsala and it needed more spice in the flour mixture.

I went the super easy route and used canned mushrooms.  It still turned out wonderfully and was a hit with fiance who loves chicken marsala.
