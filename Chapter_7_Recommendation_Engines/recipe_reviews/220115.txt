First, I want to say that this is as good (or better) than any red beans & rice that I've ever had.  However, there were some red flags when I read the recipe, and although I don't like doing this the first time making a recipe, I did make some modifications.  First, the beans are soaked overnight, so 3 qts of water is WAY too much.  I used 2 qts, checked the beans at 1-1/2 hrs., and they were done (not four hours).  Even with 2 qts of water, it still took close to two more hours to cook down the liquid to a serving consistency.  The creole seasoning that I use is Tony Chachere's, and in looking at the ingredient listing, the first item was salt.  IMO, you don't need 2 tbsp of salt.  In fact, I didn't think it needed any and added no salt significantly reducing the sodium content.  Creole seasoning is spicy, so again, I questioned 2 tbsp of pepper, and only added one.  You can always add more if needed, but you can't take it out, so I wasn't going to risk messing up the entire dish.  Please do NOT skip the creole seasoning, because I think it's the magic of this recipe.  I also was concerned about four stalks of celery, so used three.  I used Johnsonville Chicken Hardwood Smoked Sausage which worked perfectly and saved some fat and calories.  Don't mean to be critical of this recipe because with these changes, this was five stars for us, but as written, only can give it four.  I'll be interested to see what other reviewers have to say.  Thanks Paige for sharing your recipe.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much! It has a great flavor and a nice kick to it. The only thing different I did was cook it in a crockpot but I think next time I'll use half the salt and pepper it calls for. Definetly satisfied my taste buds though!

DO NOT add salt - creole seasoning is salty.  Especially not 2 tbsp. And honestly, if you like really spicy food, 1 tbsp of black pepper is more than enough (everyone else, stick to a tsp). I make a vegetarian version - take out the sausage and add 1 teaspoon of hickory liquid smoke.  I also find that after a full night's soak, I only really need about 2 quarts & 1 cup of water. I like to "mash" some of the beans to help it thicken (2 quick up and down motions with a potato masher in the pan about 30 minutes before you eat, then stir, turn the heat off and let it sit on the stove).  So a fair number of modifications, but this recipe got me started on making red beans from scratch and the way I make it now, I LOVE it.  I'd give it 5 stars if the salt and black pepper weren't so far off.

Wish I had read the reviews before making this. The alarm bells should have been blasting in my head with the amount of salt called for. I have never used Creole seasoning before and didn't realize that the main ingredient in it is salt. A bit spicier than I had hoped but I figure the hubby will still eat. Oh well....

Great recipe! after a recent trip to NOLA, i was craving some good cajun tastes and this hit the spot!  since i have a pressure cooker, i just added all the ingredients (minus the sausage), cooked them for 45 minutes, let it cool, added the sausage, then simmered.  Too easy!  Great left over as well!

Really really good!  I did as another suggested though and cut the pepper by half and omitted the salt as the 1st ingredient in my creole seasoning was salt.  I also used only 2.5 quarts water since it seemed like a lot of water.  Next time I will use 2 quarts only.  I used turkey smokd sausage which came in a 13 oz package so next time I will double the sausage as there really wasn't much.  This was so easy and tasty!  Hubs loved it and went back for 2nds which is rare!

Good recipe. I agree with those suggesting cut back on the water, salt and pepper.  Especially if you are using Andouille sausage, which is pretty much the way to go.  Of course you can make it with any kind of sausage you want, but if you do you are no longer making Creole Red Beans and Rice.

I wish I had read the reviews before making this. Way too much liquid. As well, as I couldn't find Creole spice so I used Cajun spice and felt that it could have used more flavor. Otherwise it was a good recipe.

This was way too hot for me.  It was ridiculously hot actually. It was pretty and I just knew it was going to be marvelous but I took one bite and that was all she wrote.  I used Tony "somebody's" Creole seasoning (full amount) and full amount on the pepper.  I used smoked turkey sausage which was really good.  I did not add the salt.  I wish I'd known about the extreme heat that would come out of that Creole seasoning jar.  It was unbelievable. I'm giving it 3 stars for attractiveness, ease of preparation, and the fact that my boyfriend suffered through 1 bowl and said, with sweat running down his face, "that was good.  Hot but good."

This recipe has potential!
I started following it as-is until I read that it takes 2 TBS of pepper. I don't like the flavor of pepper, so I didn't add any. While it was cooking, however, I began to read the reviews and so sampled some of the liquid the beans and veggies were simmering in. HOLY SALT. I cut a few potatoes into quarters and threw those in there. Everything has finished cooking now, and thankfully, the potatoes absorbed a good portion of the saltiness. When I make this again, I'll not add any salt- it's truly unnecessary for flavoring the dish. As others mentioned, the three quarts of water was way too much after soaking the beans. I took half of it out while cooking, and everything was still rather soupy, so I mixed a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken the broth/sauce. The flavor has a lot of kick and I'm eager to make this again. The changes I'll be making are: Half the amount of water (I'm not sure this won't still be too much but it's a starting point), no pepper, and no salt. With a few tweaks, I think this will be great!

I used a whole bag of dried beans, soaked overnight, and 2qts (8cups) water. I used vegetable base for that amt of water and used a recipe for creole seasoning I found on this site (except that I did not add salt and pepper, just the white pepper)  Salt and Pepper I just ground some in, the same amount I put in all my cooking. So no extra salt and the amount of creole was just right (total about 2tbsp of spices) I used a smithfield smoked sausage, but next time I might use 2 diff kinds like another reviewer. It's still very watery, took about 2 hours to cook. Must remember to give it a few blasts with the immersion blender to try to thicken. The liquid looked like dirty dishwater but a slotted spoon helped.  I love it, cheap and easy and open to lots of experimentation.

This was really GOOD! Even the boyfriend said multiple times how yummy it was,which is unusual. Read the reviews thoroughly, used chicken stock instead of plain water, no salt just creole seasoning. It did only take 2 hours,not four but our beans weren't very old either. Will definitely make again, especially when the budget is tight. I think I spent $8 on all the ingredients,and will get at least 6 servings.

Very good except for the salt. I put in less than half required, and now I'm trying to soak up the salt with potatoes this morning! Too much salt! Also, I soaked the beans for two days, and then had to cook them on low in the crock pot overnight in order for the beans to soften up. 4 hours on low was not enough time for these beans. But overall great flavor in this dish.

I will cook this again, but will not cook it as long next time. We like our beans a lot firmer. I cut way back on the pepper and salt, which was a wise thing to do.

I used this recipe the first time I ever made red beans and rice, the family loved it.  We just made one substitution, instead of using smoked sausage we used ground sausage and it worked just fine.

I read all the reviews and made the modification as needed. I only used 1 tablespoon of black pepper and 2 tablespoons of Creole seasoning, and 8 cups of water. I did not add any salt at all. Overall, I thought it was a little too spicy still (even with the modifications). I may not add any black pepper next time. It is also somewhat watery even with only 8 cups of water. I cooked it in the slow cooker for about 7 hours (1 hour on high, 6 hours on low). I don't think 6 hours on low would have been enough on its own. Good flavor, but spicy (we had to eat a lot of rice to compensate). I wonder if I need to smash the beans up next time to make it less watery. Made a lot of red beans. In my 6 cup GLAD container, it filled up 3 of them (each container is good for 4 servings of beans). I guess a lot of leftovers. Will probably try freezing some as well.

Great recipe!  Definitely leave out the salt, half the pepper, and reduce the water to 8 cups.

This was amazing! I did not add salt or pepper. I boiled 2 chicken legs in chicken broth and creole seasoning. About 15 minutes into boiling, I added chicken andouille sausage. After about 10 minutes I took the sausage out and chop that up. I then took the chicken out and took the skin off and chop that up.  

My beans only soak for 3 hrs. I then cook them for 1 hr in 1.5 quarts of water. Next I added the vegetables, chicken and andouille sausage to the beans. I let all of that to cook for about 3 hrs or until the beans soften. Once it was done I added about 2 tablespoon of flour to thicken it up some

It is delicious, but a little salty which is due to the creole seasoning. I'm hoping once I have rice with it, it will help!

My kosh! This is better than anything you get eating out. My husband is amazed at the great dishes I keep SETTing in front of him - all made from this site. This is one that he absolutely loved. made with spicy sausage added to the bang. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a very good recipe!  I cut back on the salt and pepper and "fiddled" with it a little.  I simmered three smoked ham hocks and used the water from those, then used the meat later.  For a little extra zing I threw in a can of Rotel tomatoes and habaneros.   Thanks!

Wow, this was good!  I have to say I did alter it a bit, just because I have to feed small children who don't deal well with spice.  I used 1 1/2 tbsp of salt, 1 tbsp of pepper and 1 1/2 tbsp of creole seasoning.  It was still very warm.  I also cut down the water a bit, cause it was a bit runny for me. I will definitely make this again!

I used less creole seasoning and no additional salt and pepper.  Prefer a cast iron Dutch Oven to slow cooker. Great ideas and variations. Thanks!

My family and I are always trying to expand our flavor pallet and this recipe looked delicious compared to the recipe the wife had.

I let the beans sit overnight as described, but I changed it up from there and put it all into a slow cooker on high for 6hrs and then low for 4hrs.

I had no choice but to try the "soup" as it smelled awesome. Has a nice kick to it, but over the rice you don't get that flavor kick unless you eat it in a bowl like my wife did with rice and some of the soup.

Instead os using water to boil the beans I use either chicken stock or I add Better than Bouillon Chicken Flavor.  It gives it a better flavor without the spiciness.  We individually spicy up our own bowls because we all like a different amount of heat.

After soaking the beans overnight and adding the water dense veggies,  you only need to add enough water to cover the beans.  It was very good though and makes a huge amount of food.

It's very important to use Andouille sausage for authentic flavor. Also my dad started to bake the sausage first to keep the beans from becoming greasy. Most importantly,  you have to make this dish on a Monday for tradition. :)

We liked it.  When making it in a pressure cooker, even 2 quarts was WAY too much water. I don't buy celery often, so I used extra, I wasn't going to use it for anything else.  I don't think that made it any better, but I also don't think it didn't make it any worse. :-)
