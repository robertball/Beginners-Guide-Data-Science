I was looking for ways to use up fresh zucchini & summer squash (aren't we all?!) so I had to try this.... It's great! I used yellow squash instead of zucchini, and lime instead of lemon. At first I was concerned that the recipe doesn't specify exactly how much squash to use (size of squash can vary greatly!) but I think the measured amounts aren't critical here - just go by taste. My husband, who doesn't like to eat anything weird, said it was the best sorbet he ever tasted. We actually made two batches... the first batch we did not strain the pulp out (why waste the zucchini was my thinking)... It tasted fine, but took over a day to freeze to a scoopable texture. IT'S IMPORTANT TO USE FRESH SQUEEZED lemon/lime and freshly grated zest for best flavor. (When grating fresh zest, be very careful not to grate too deeply because the white part is bitter. A microplane grater really helps.) Also, do not add too much zest to the recipe or it can taste too intense. The amount stated in the recipe is perfect.

The mixture wasn't at all juicy after blending, so I did what another reviewer suggested and did not strain out the pulp before freezing. The lemon and mint go well together, and the sweetness was just right, but I didn't love the texture.  I thought about thawing, straining, and refreezing, but I don't think I'd get enough liquid out of the pulp to bother.

I had a friend give me a giant zucchini and was looking for some fun stuff to do with it.  I was pretty excited to try this recipe, besides if I can get my little man to eat veggies for dessert I'm stoked.  

I made a few modifications to the recipe.  I filled my blender with peeled and seeded zucchini, added 3/4 c lime juice, about 2 t lime zest and 1/2 c fresh local honey.  Blended, strained and froze.  I omitted the mint as I didn't have any on hand.  

It came out perfectly tart and very refreshing for the hot summer nights.  Nicely balanced and my little man LOVED IT!  Had a few other friends try it before I told them what was in it and the consensus came back with an astounding "NOM!" followed by "Really? Zucchini?"

Definitely going to add this one to my recipe box!

Incredibly easy and delicious!  Refreshing and no veggie taste detected.  Recipe does not yield much.  I recommend you double or triple the amounts to make the efforts worthwhile.  It would be great to find a use for the pulp that is discarded.
