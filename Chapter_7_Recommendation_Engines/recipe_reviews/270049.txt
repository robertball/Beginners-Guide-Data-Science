This was super easy to make, and very tasty.  The sauce is great!  Here's some things I did different. After I took the chops out of the frying pan, I added the pan drippings to the sauce. I just couldn't dump them. I think it added some more flavor. I only put half the sauce on the chops when putting in the oven, and used the rest of the sauce on the chops when serving.  The next time, I will only make half the sauce since I only make 2 chops for 2 of us.  I'll keep this recipe.

This made for some pretty tasty pork chops! The only thing I did differently was to use 1/2 cup of honey (I ran out), and that was plenty sweet--I think 1 cup would have made it too sweet for my tastes. It's also super quick and easy to throw this together--so great for a weeknight! Will definitely make again, thank you!

Halved the honey, and it was plenty sweet. Easy and excellent flavor! Can probably use it for chicken, too.

This was a delicious and easy recipe. Like others, I used less honey (partly because I was a little low on my supply) but it was plenty sweet. I probably used more garlic than called for also, since we are big garlic fans. I was actually looking for a garlic and pork chop recipe when I found this.  Served with rice and green beans and it was a lovely meal!

Used center cut bone in pork chops. Very good. Nice change for pork chops. Probably adjusted the cooking time a little because of bone.  Didn't change anything else. Will do this again.

I loved it. My wife did not. If you enjoy a sweet and spicy Asian flavor this is it. Honey and cayenne with the ginger providing a nice cross over. Based on the cooking method the chops will stay extremely moist. Try to pair it with an Asian vegetable medley. ONLY ADJUMENT I will make next time is to DRAMATCALLY reduce the sauce/glaze mixture. I cut in 1/2 this time with four 1 1/4" plus porkchops and still had too much. Also used more crushed ginger not dried ginger.

THIS IS OUTSTANDING AND EASY. I am single so I reduced the glaze ingredients to taste. After first using chopped garlic (my friends & I found fresh garlic too strong) I used garlic powder. Garlic flavor without the bad breath. I always make rice and a sweet potato with this. It is quite easy and loaded with flavor IMHO

I liked the sauce. I like garlic and the health benefits. I would marinate the meat the night before then bake and baste. Eliminate a step of frying and tenderize the meat at the same time..

I used complete seasoning instead of black pepper and I stewed the pork.

This was really good!
Next time, Instead of baking it, i'm going to grill the pork and serve the sauce at the table. I didn't feel baking them gave them any extra pajazz. 
I did add sambal instead of the Cayenne.  Wonderful sweet/heat! I caught my husband eating the sauce after I prepped it.

This recipe was so good. Even my children, who do not like new things or pork chops, liked it.

Second time I pan fried rather than roasted. Turned out better. Used pineapple juice to marinate chops that had been previously brined for 2 hours. Used PJ in sauce. Cooked to 140F, made sauce and returned chops to pan with sauce to finish cooking to 145. Heated pineapple rings in sauce. 
Next time I'll add honey to sauce when it's almost as thick as I want (don't like to cook honey).
