This could be a 5 star recipe but only if you use 1 cup Arborio rice.  Three cups rice would be enough for 12 servings.

Fresh and delicious. Don't let the fear of having to stir keep you from trying this. Risotti are wonderfully easy and this combination won't let you down. I added zucchine and squash. Thank you for the recipe.

great simple dinner.  cut the rice in half, if using arborrio, and still add a bit more broth, and it is a winner.  if it were not for that mistake in the recipe, it would be 5 stars.  Also with the rice cut down, 1/2lb of asparagus is pleanty.

This turned out really nice. I scaled the recipe down to 1 cup rice but used 2/ 32oz containers of veg broth for the whole process to get the rice to a good texture. Did add a little veg for  nutrition and to make it a meal. I added a few mushrooms to the onion mix in the beginning because they needed to be used.  I shredded zucchini and squash, sweated them in a colander while I made the risotto.  I chopped the shrimp for dietary needs as well as the asparagus. I added a lot more minced garlic too...we love it... Had to throw in red pepper to the risotto, more towards the last addition of broth! I added a little seasoning (Lantana all purpose)  to the broth wile it heated for extra kick (for the rice and the shrimp boil).... after boiling the shrimps and asparagus in the remaining broth I drained them in the colander with the rinsed shredded  squashes.....then just added everything to the rice. Didn't have all the parm (my bad) so subbed the last of the feta. Didn't change too much....just a fan of using what we have and not wasting food :)

Delicious! However, the ratio of rice to liquid needs to be about 1:3 or 1:3 1/2 (I heat up enough for 1:4 to be safe) which would mean 9-12 cups of liquid rather than 4, and a HUGE amount of risotto.  I also reduced the salt - otherwise loved this dish and will certainly add it to my recipe box! Thanks for sharing!

This is delicious IF you make the following adjustments: just one cup of rice is just right for 4. 2 T butter rather than 3,and much less salt and pepper—1 T of each is far too much!

This one is a keeper.  The rice was a bit too firm but that's because I was in a rush and added the cheese and butter a bit too soon, and regretted it because it just started sticking to the pan.  Next time I'll cook it a bit longer before adding the shrimp and asparagus. Easy and flavourful.

I substitute the Chicken Broth into vegetable broth and added more Parmesan cheese for added flavor.

It was great!  I had to use more chicken broth than what the recipe called for, but other than that no changes

I made this without the asparagus just with garlic shrimp and it was amazing. It’s easy to make.
