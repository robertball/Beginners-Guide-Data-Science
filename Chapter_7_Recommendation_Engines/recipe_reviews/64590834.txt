I've made another version of Gado-Gado before, and it's one of my favourite salads! This one was different from other versions which I have made, but excellent. The only change which I made was to marinate the tofu with soy sauce, lime juice and some honey before frying because I (we both actually) really don't like plain tofu. Will make this again! Thanks for posting. Made this for Culinary Quest 2016 / Indonesia for team IHp

My fiance grew up in Indonesia and he gave this a thumbs up (and went for seconds!). I did make a few changes to the sauce after trying the finished product as I think it was missing something. After a generous splash of sambal and kecip manis, it was perfect. We also had to sub spinach for cabbage as mine turned out moldy.  Thank you for the recipe! - sofieatoast
