This is best recipe I have made so far this year!! If you are making jams as gifts you should add this to your list for sure...it is amazing!!.. I made this  again but for some reason it seems thin.. I think I may have put less Amaretto in last year..3TBS..

Fantastic. Mine turned out a little thin I used 4 oz of peach jello for the pectin and a little less sugar. Next time I will use a full 6 oz. I plan to use mine on ice cream- yummy!

I love peaches and I love amaretto. This just didn't work for me. The jam never set up, and I couldn't taste the amaretto. I made a batch of  plain peach jam right after I made this, set up fine. I'll pour it over cream cheese and serve with wheat thins, I like the idea of stirring it into yogurt. We'll eat it but I won't make it again.
