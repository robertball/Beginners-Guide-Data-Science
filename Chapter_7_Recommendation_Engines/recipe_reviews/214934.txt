Overall, very good! Plus it's a great way to use up leftover grilled corn. I subbed cucumber for the green pepper as a personal preference. And I definitely agree with some of the other reviewers that this needs lime juice.  I also added a bit of sugar to the "dressing" and let this set in the fridge for a few hours to let the flavors blend together.  Very simple, very tasty and bursting with color!

I used cherry tomatoes sliced, omitted the green pepper, added an avocado diced, lime juice and lime zest and it was outstanding.  Definetly needs the lime and avocado.

I love this recipe.  I make it slightly different.  I use red or yellow bell peppers because I can't stand the taste of green peppers, and I add about half a small container of feta cheese to the salad, and a few dashes of cayenne pepper.  It is perfect to accompany a barbequed dinner!

I was looking for a way to use up some frozen cobbettes and this seemed like a good way. Actually it turned out absolutely fantastic. Aside from using the cobbettes (which we did grill) the only adjustments I made were to add a splash of lime juice as others suggested and to use more tomato. We absolutely loved it!!!! We can't wait to try it with fresh corn and see if it can actually get better!!!

I have made a version of this for years,  but this recipe is lacking a key ingredient which is the juice of 2-3 limes. I also only use red peppers as they are milder. A trick to this for the corn is to roast in husks in oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.  Husks and silk fall off and the taste is just as good, if not better than grilled corn.  Bon Apetite!

I didn't prefer this by itself, but I put it on nacho's with some cheese and spicy sauce and it added so much depth of flavor to a finger food. Tasty!

This salad rocks! I was looking for a healthy, tasty side dish for a camping trip with family and I found it with this salad. I added a chopped avacado, fresh lime juice and jalapeno. Everyone loved it!

What a good hearty stew is to the cold winter months, this refreshing Grilled Corn Salad is to a hot summer day! I made fish stick tacos and used this salad as a topping for it. I squeezed some lime on. The lime,tomato and chili pepper all came from my back yard. It was a quick and simple to put together. I had grilled off the corn last week and used that. I had everything on hand and tasted terrific!Thank You Amber, this will be a regular around my table!

Love grilled corn! I added an avocado, and mixed about 2 T lime juice, 1 T sugar, and about 1/4 C Olive oil for the 'dressing'.  I also sprinkled with Queso Fresco because cheese. The grilled corn flavor was awesome, and the avocado added creaminess. I'll definitely make this again!

A very tasty salad using all the fresh produce of the summer.  We liked the combination of the ingredients in this salad.  The leftovers held up well for lunches the next day.  I do think fresh squeezed lime juice would add another dimension to this salad.  Thanks AMBERT77, for sharing your recipe.

Loved this recipe.  I did add a vinaigrette (with lime juice) for the dressing and additional peppers (red, yellow).  This was a huge hit and great with all the corn available this time of year.

Very tasty salad. I grilled 2 extra corn on the cobs last night. I made the recipe to feed 2 people. I got enough corn off the cobs to actually feed 4 people. I put extra tomato in the salad. Hubby will not eat any color of bell pepper so had to leave it out. I tasted it and it really did need lime juice so added some to the recipe. The roasted corn has it`s own natural sweetness so it was perfect. I will be making this salad through out the summer.

Wasn't as flavorful as I was expecting. I added some cucumber, but think it could have done with a little balsamic.  Will add next time.

Great taste and beautiful color. Made several variations. Used 1/2 frozen corn because I didn’t have enough cob corn. Added lime. Used coriander since it’s out of season to get cilantro. Used white onion since red onion out of season. Still tasted great. Will pair with great northern beans made into baked beans for meal prep.

Do not be fooled by it's simplicity. This easy salad is BIG on flavor. Make sure you let it sit in your refrigerator as specified. The flavors really develop and make a wonderful tasting salad that's healthy and flavorful. I made it exactly as directed and my family devoured it. This recipe is a keeper.

This was good and I will make it again but with the following changes:
add 2 avocados, juice of one whole lime, a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and a smashed clove of garlic.
I let the favors meld overnight. Make sure you add enough salt and pepper as it really needs it. 
This was turned it up a notch!

Added lime juice and lime zest as the other reviewers suggested and it was phenomenal. I added a touch of poblano pepper, green onion, and red bell pepper. Fantastic dish I will make again and again. Was great as an addition to fish tacos.

It was delicious. I used red pepper instead of green, just my preference. I added one sliced avocado and lime juice   Rave reviews from friends at bbq. I think the lime juice just adds that extra bit of zing and freshness. Great summer salad. First time I’ve grilled corn and it was fabulous!

Grilled the jalapeño,  tomato and onion to add a little more smoke. Squeeze of lime and some salt really made it pop.  Didn't have cojeta cheese so I used feta. A great bite and contrast to the sweet corn.  This is super fast and tasty

Outstanding! I used orange peppers, grape tomatoes, and made it a day in advance. I also added some lime juice as suggestd by others. Just before serving I added slices avocado . This will be a summer staple!

We love it.  I was out of tomatos and substituted an avacado, and used red and orange peppers for color.  I used cold leftover grilled corn from a previous dinner, and served the salad cold.  Have made it twice already, really good and easy - and easy to just wing it :)

This is a very good recipe especially with fresh corn arriving in our Texas grocery stores currently. I left out the green bell pepper and added fresh lime juice based on other reviews and since I brushed the ears of corn with olive oil prior to roasting I found that the dish did not need the 2 tsp. of olive oil. Also, just because I was in a hurry, I used a corn holder in the end of the cob to aid in cutting the kernels from the cob while they were still hot. It also helped to cool the corn down faster so that the remaining ingredients could be added. All in all this great recipe  for all that summer corn that’s here and more on it’s way. I will definitely be using this recipe again. Thanks Amber.

Only thing I would do to this recipe is make more!  We added part of a jalapeno to it.  Will probably add a whole one next time.  But will definitely make it again.

It is fresh and delicious.  Very colorful. I will absolutely make it again! One thing I did differently was to soak the avocado in lemon juice so it wouldn't turn brown.

Very easy! I used fresh basil instead of cilantro since that was ready in the garden. I just microwaved my corn (in the husk) instead of grilling.

I thought the taste was just blah. I added extra salt, pepper, olive oil & lime juice, but it really didn't help. I love cilantro in salsa, etc., but it was just overpowering in this dish. I will keep trying to find a good corn salad, won't make this one again. Sorry.

I made this for a summer cookout gathering and it was a big hit.  This will become a staple for all future gatherings. I followed many of the suggested enhancements, doing the following: I used frozen roasted corn instead of grilled. I also added the juice and zest of two limes, one can of drained & rinsed black bans, two avocados and feta cheese.  For the dressing, in addition to olive oil, I added approximately 2 tbsps of a citrus salad dressing.  I added garlic salt, cumin and paprika.  I was very generous with both salt and pepper.

I really liked this, used it as a side and also added it to a mixed green salad.  You can do somuch with this, add zuchini, cheese, bacon or whatever ;youhave.  I also liked the taste of the cilantro, added a little bit of fresh lemon juice. Awesome

Be careful about adding cilantro---a little goes a long way. I added additional chopped tomato, and some sugar  to refine the taste.

It was delicious almost immediately but even better when I let it marinade for 2 days.  I used red peppers instead of green (personal preference) and added just a bit more sugar.  Great for camping because I made it ahead of time.

I took  the green pepper out and it was great.  With the pepper,  you might as well have made and all-pepper salad because that is all I could taste.

It was good. Thought it need an acid to bright up the flavors, so I added some basalmic vinegar to the leftover portion. Killed it! Will make it again only next time add the acid at the beginning.

EASY GOOD FRESH CONVENIENT  I followed recipe with our own preferences. Easy to adapt to what you like. Red pepper,
parsley, a few red pepper flakes. Even a few peas.Used the real lime juice and zest.  Feta or Tex mex. cheese. Keeps for several days stored well in fridge. Apart from dinner,,just nice to snack on.

it was good but I think it is missing something...like more acid and salt.  I think I will play with this again. I like that it is a great seasonal fresh salad.

Th only change I made was to use frozen Trader Joe's roasted corn!  It is already nicely charred, and off the cob.  It's delicious in the recipe, AND makes it super easy to make.

This was awesome as a topping on a Cobb salad. I omitted the green pepper and added cucumber, lime juice, red wine vinegar, and a little sugar. I did not have fresh corn so I used 2 cans of fire roasted corn instead and it came out GREAT! I will definitely make this again.

I used frozen corn and added a can of black beans. Also used about 1/8 tsp garlic powder and two dashes of red pepper flakes as well as four dashes of Tobasco. Good, but was screaming for avocado.

We made it just as written --we did refrigerate it for almost 5 hours so all the flavors blended before serving.  It was delicious-a great summer side dish.  A definite repeat !!

I tried this recipe for dinner tonight and got rave reviews. After reading some of the other comments, I cleaned out the crisper and added red and yellow peppers instead of green, a can of black beans, cherry tomatoes, lime, balsamic vinegar, and feta. Sadly I was out of cilantro, but it was still delicious. We will be able to enjoy the leftovers tomorrow. Thanks for the flavourful summer dish.

This was delicious! Only thing I will do different next time is not add the green pepper. I think that overpowered the corn. Thanks!

Oil the corn before grilling. I added some italian dressing to the salad too or just add cumin and chili powder and lime juice. I also added an orange pepper instead of a green one. I'll also try adding an avocado and black beans or maybe feta cheese next time.

I didn't have the ears of corn or the green peppers but I took frozen corn and "grilled" them in my cast iron skillet with a tiny bit of EVOO.  It toasted and grilled them perfectly!  I then added it to the remainer of the ingredients in my salad bowl, garnished with cilantro. YUM! Too bad the portions are too small. I would double, even triple the recipe!

5 stars with the reviewer-suggested addition of lime juice (I used 2 small). I also added jalapeno for a little kick and green, orange and red peppers for color (as well as both yellow and white corn). I put in two small avocados as suggested, but it was prettier before adding the avocado, which gave it a creamy consistency. Personally, I don't think the avocado added much to the taste; it didn't detract from the taste either. Next time, I'll just leave it out. I served it at dinner for 8 people. Everyone that tried it really liked it and went back for more.

Very nice and easy salad. Great way to eat cilantro I made it with fresh organic corn which can be eaten without being cooked at all and it was great. Added a bit of lime juice which was in place. Can vary the vegetables , adding cucumber and such. Well be made again!

This is almost exactly my recipe for Maque Choux. I don't put creme in my Maque Choux, so this is pretty much it. Had it last night with shrimp and grits. Everybody loves it. I - like some other reviewer added smoked paprika and didn't think it went very well. At times I have added cucumber, olives, pineapple, tomatoes or avocado. I think it looks best on a plate with red bell pepper or tomato.
