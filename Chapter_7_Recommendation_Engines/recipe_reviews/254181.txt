I hate to give this such a low rating, but this cake just did not work for me. I thought that there would not be enough leavening in this cake (with only a 1 tsp baking powder and a 1/4 tsp baking soda, and not using real eggs), and I was right. This cake barely rose at all, thus not only making it dense, but also not allowing it to cook properly. I had to cook it at least 20-30 extra minutes, and it still wasn't fully done the center. I think adding in at least 1 1/2 tsps EACH of baking soda and baking powder might help, and maybe using real eggs as well.  The whole wheat flour, the zucchini, and the blueberries all weigh a cake down, so extra leavening (especially in the absence of any kind of fat) is necessary. The taste is pretty good, but overall, I will probably not make this again.
