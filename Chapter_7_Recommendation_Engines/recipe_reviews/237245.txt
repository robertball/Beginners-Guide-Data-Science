This was a pretty nice dish, especially considering how easy it was to make. I learned how to roast cauliflower in only 20 minutes and that adding spinach to marinara sauce is a good easy way to get some greens into the diet. I found the recipe after watching Cook's Country and they recommended Barilla shelf stable 3 cheese tortellini in a taste test. I bought it and didn't really know what to do with it. I don't care for vodka sauce so I used a good brand marinara. I also used a 6oz bag of spinach and the whole head of cauliflower. Just had to chop the cauliflower smaller after it was done roasting.

I was excited to make this dish as it sounded delicious. Unfortunately my husband and son did not like the roasted cauliflower. I personally think it would have been better steamed as the roast flavour was competing with the cheese tortellini and the sauce. As well, none of us were keen on the fresh spinach in my marinara sauce. We tried!

It was ok.  We think we would have preferred traditional marinara sauce.

This was very good! The cauliflower seemed a little out of place but when everything came together it worked. Will make again!

This was excellent.Tasting the sauce as it cooked I added more garlic,onion powder (too lazy to chop)and I used Rana cheese ravioli (not frozen)only cooks for 3 minutes.I also added a whole bag of baby spinach (rinse and drain well) to the sauce just before the ravioli per another review so it doesn't get too soggy. Thank you for a great recipe!Oh,I also used fresh basil from the garden :)
