I love clam sauce but the version I've always use has wine in it, which my husband doesn't like.  I tried this recipe as an alternative and I'm so glad I did!  I did make a few changes-- less oil, shallots instead of onion, a little less garlic, no red pepper, heavy cream instead of half-and-half, 4 cans of clams (2 minced, 2 chopped) and I, too, used some cornstarch to make this nice and thick!  It was plenty for a pound of linguine, and was delicious the first night served AND left over... This is my new claim sauce recipe!!

I thought this was a very good recipe but my husband and I thought about a couple of changes we would make.  First of all, we both love spicy food but many people don't so we would cut the red pepper flakes in half.  We also found it abit oily so we would cut the olive oil in half too.  And the last change we would make is that we would have used heavy cream instead of half and half to make for a thicker sauce.  But it truly was a very tasty dish.  Thank you for sharing it!

WHOA! I'm absolutely convinced that two tablespoons of red pepper flakes was a typo. She had to have meant teaspoons. The initial flavor of the sauce is amazing until you get the hot flavor of the flakes. Between 0-2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes make this dish a wonderful keeper in our home. I also cut the amount of oil in half and used heavy cream. Other reviewers complained that there weren't enough clams in the recipe. However, if you're concerned about picky eaters, the amount in the recipe is plenty.

Note: if you have already followed the recipe exactly and find that it's too hot, adding some extra heavy cream and a half cup of freshly shredded parmesan cheese definitely cools it off without losing any flavor.

DELICIOUS! I like my Clam sauce a little heartier, so I used heavy cream substituted chopped clams. I thickened it up with heaping Tablespoon of cornstarch, dissolved in water and stirred it in the last several minutes of simmering. Also... if you've never tried fresh pasta, you don't know what you are missing!

Great recipe... THANKS!

1T butter, 1 T evoo, 2 10oz cans clams and 2 8.5oz bottles clam juice. Added 1 T flour after cooking onions before adding clam juice.  Reduced down by 2/3rds before adding half and half and clams.  Cut pepper flakes to 2t (just right). Cooked pasta al dente then dumped into sauce to absorb and thicken. Very nice.

I was actually looking for my recipe to email someone, and this comes close - to address people's comments here, I make it like this, but start with a roue of butter and flour - you could use cornstarch.  Then it gets thick without trying to reduce it so much. Classic recipe, to me...

This was delicious. Took some suggestions from others and decreased the amount of oil, also thickened the sauce with a couple of tablespoons of flour (added it after sauteeing the onions) We couldn't stop eating it.

This recipe was good and quite easy.  I only used 1/2 tsp of pepper flakes and it was pretty spicy, next time I'll use 1/4 tsp. I also only used 2 tbls olive oil.  I added 2 tablespoons of corn starch at the end to make it more like a gravy.

I was concerned about how non creamy it was and added a little parmesan cheese to thicken it up. Next time I plan to cut the olive oil and use heavy cream as the other reviews suggested. Still really good though!

Really, really fantastic.  I made this for 2 people so I used enough EVOO to cook the onions and garlic, the juice from 2 cans of clams, then added 4 tbsp of FF half and half mixed with 1 tbsp of cornstarch and let it thicken for the 20 minutes.  I added the clams to warm through and dumped it over the fettucini serving with with fresh parm and parsley.  I was absolutely impressed with myself and my husband said it's 100% company worthy.  Thank you!

This was a good recipe and I like spice, but two tablespoons was FAR too much of red pepper flakes!  My stomach is still burning 24 hours later.  I would cut the red pepper flakes  to 1/2 teaspoon at most!  I added parmesan cheese to thicken it up, and I agree with the other reviews about using heavy cream instead of half and half.  The recipe itself was good and I would try it again with the above listed changes - maybe even adding a few mushrooms.

OMG! This has become a constant request in my house! I think my hubby thinks it’s my recipe but it’s not! The only changes I make sometimes are to add baby shrimp (if I have some) and or add some finely chopped mushrooms. Oh and I use heavy cream. This recipe is the best!

With a few changes because of tips/availability this was the best linguine and clam sauce I've ever made!..  I halfed the oil and red pepper.  I didn't have 3 cans of clams so I used two cans of clams and  re-filled one can with chicken broth and used that; added a handful of chopped raw shrimp during the last 5 minutes to give them time to cook, thickened with 1T cornstarch mixed into 4T half and half, stirred in  and simmered until thickened!  Serve topped with crushed black pepper, parmesan cheese and parsley!   Delish!  :)

I have to say we loved this one. I did make a few changes. I didn"t use all that olive oil, just enough to cook the onions and garlic in. I also added some wine before the the clam juice and let the alcohol cook off. Last but not least I used heavy cream because that is what I had in the frig. Wait there was one more thing,,,fresh peper. I add it to almost everything.

Totally Awesome!  It was a wonderful recipe that my whole family enjoyed - even the kids.  I did take the suggestion and use heavy cream and I added about a 1/4 cup of dry white wine when simmering the clam juice. I can't wait to make this for guests!

FANTASTIC! I used 1/2 stick of butter and a nice splash of extra virgin olive oil to cook the onion mixture. Then I added like a tablespoon or two of flour and let that cook for a minute before adding the clam juice and 1/2&1/2, which allowed the sauce to thicken up nicely. Also, I only used maybe 1/2-3/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and that was perfect for us. This was enough sauce for 1lb. of linguine. I will be using this recipe ofen! Thanks for sharing. :)

The sauce was very runny and presentation looked bad.  I don't know if I would make it again, if I did I would use less olive oil and heavy cream for a thicker sauce.

I love the recipe and same with my fiance' and younger sister.  I make this pretty regularly.  I did change it to some of the reviews suggestions.  I use heavy cream instead of half and half.  I use 2 cans of minced clams and 2 cans of whole clams.  I add all the juice and let it simmer.  Added 1 shallot to the onion and used minced garlic.  Every time I make it everyone has at least 2 plates full of the linguine and clam sauce.  Thanks for sharing.

really excellent sauce!  I served it for company (using heavy cream as other reviewers suggested) with salad and garlic bread.  I thought the heat was great but it could certainly be too much for some so be careful.

I have never had much luck making White Clam Sauce but this was easy and very good. I took everyone's feedback and did not use as much red pepper. It was a hit.

Cut olive oil to 2T or use 1/4 c. butter. Use baby clams not minced Use heavy cream and add 1 T flour or sauce puddles on the plate under the noodles. Use fresh parsley and/or basil during last minute of cooking.  With these modifications the recipee was excellant!!

I was really not that thrilled by this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted like red pepper flavored cream.  My hubby said it was OK but he would not be upset if I didn't make it again.  OOh well back to my search for a super white clam sauce recipe.  :(

I have made this recipe multiple times.  Family loves it.  I use 4 cans of clams- 2 minced and 2 chopped.   I usually use 1/4 cup or less of olive oil sautéing onions with shallots and then adding the minced onion.. sometimes adding a splash of white wine and using all the clam juice.   I also just add a pinch of red pepper flakes if any at all due to kids eating the recipe.I also substitute with heavy cream.   Today going to add some shrimp prior to adding the clams.  This is my staple recipe.  Been making this recipe for at least 6 or 7 years...Can tweak the way you would like.  Sometimes add some fresh squeezed lemon at the end.

I wasn't feeling motivated to make dinner last night after a long day, but I had this planned and am so glad I prepared it!  My first time making clam sauce and it will not be the last.  I made mostly as directed - I think a tad less oil and added a slurry of cornstarch/water to the cream sauce near the end as other recommended.  My husband said "wow, this is delicious" and my stepdaughter took her first bite and said "mmmmmm.... so good...."

Awesome! I didn't have any onions, so subbed onion powder. I also didn't have any Parmesan so skipped that. Also, I used fettucini rather than linguine. I added about a cup of cherry Moscato wine as well. I added a pound  of fresh mushrooms cut in half with the chicken broth and half n half. Wow- we'll be making this one a lot!! SO GOOD!!!

Very tasty!  I cut the garlic and olive oil in half, and added 1/2 cup white wine with the clam juice.   Cut cream down to 1 1/2 cups if  you like - there's plenty of sauce for 6 servings.

I am a life long lover of clam sauce. From a VERY young age I grew up eating and LOVING my mom's angel hair with white clam sauce.  When I grew up, she passed her recipe on to me.  Last night I couldn't find the recipe and decided to look online-this recipe looked pretty good so I figured I'd give it a try.OH MY LORD!! THIS SAUCE IS AMAZING! It blows my mom's version out of the water! (sorry mom!) I only put a little red pepper flake in  as I am not a huge fan of it and, like others,I would suggest using A LITTLE less oil. Until last night,I had no idea that all these years Ive been missing out on truly delicious white clam sauce. If you want to experience an unexpected flavor EXPLOSION then look no further! A-MA-ZING!

Well... I have made this recipe as stated and with changes due to our preferences or.. what we had on hand. And.. it is amazing either way.  Changes I made... used 16 oz of pasta rather than 8 oz; added additional canned clams; used butter instead of evoo; used heavy cream (lordy the calories) and steamed fresh clams and served on top in shells for a nice presentation.  We do love this sauce and it is now our go to clam sauce.  It's very versatile.  Thanks Linoleum for passing along to us!!!  Next time going to try no fat cream or 1/2-1/2 and see how it compares

Best recipe EVER. I've made this several times. I too cut down on the oil a bit and add extra clams and garlic.I think next time I'll try a little cornstarch to thicken it up.

This sauce has a really good flavor, but I think it has a little too much oil and is a but runnier than I would like. That said, it tastes really good and I have made it several times.

This clam sauce was yummy to me, but my husband said, and I quote "I just can't eat this".  His loss in my opinion!  The only thing I did different was to cut way back on the amount of olive oil.  Way to much, not needed.

I only put a few tablespoons of olive oil in the pan and sauted the onions and garlic.  Other than that, followed the recipe EXACTLY!  It was INCREDIBLE! It was like an AWESOME Italian or Seafood restaurant quality meal AT HOME!  Big hit!

This recipe was pretty good.  I, like others, prefer a thicker sauce.  I halved the olive oil, used heavy cream instead of half & half as suggested, and it was still a little too runny.  I added about 2 tbsp of corn starch to thicken it up.  The taste was great though.

This particular clam sauce was spectacular. My finance and myself both loved it. Although we would personally add heavy cream and more garlic, it was absolutely delicious and easy to make.

Agree totally with decreased oil.  1/4 c almost too much.  I always add an anchovy or three to oil.  They melt and add nice flavor. Being a WW I stuck to Half and Half vs cream.  I had to save a lot of points for this dish but YUMMY!!  I so wanted to drink the remaining broth but that would require 20,000 steps to budge it off my butt.  A KEEPER!

Five stars using the recommendations of others. Less oil, heavy cream and shallots instead of onion.

I added 4 tbsp of butter, used less red pepper, added a little black pepper, added pizza seasoning, and a little chicken bouillon . Delicious definitely making again!

It was delicious. I used some butter, a little more cream than the recipe called for, I also cracked a few egg yolks and a few tbl. spoons of flour into it to help thicken it up. I did not use any wine. I used an extra cup of chicken broth that really rounded out the flavor. I also added 1/2 cup of frozen green peas. It was crazy good!

Fabulous!  I used 4T of butter in place of the oil and more garlic than called for.  After reading other reviews I added flour to the butter and made a roux and a bare sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes.  I added 1/2 cup Chardonnay in addition to the clam juice. Used a mixture of heavy cream and 1/2 & 1/2.  This covered a full pound of pasta nicely - I had enough sauce sauce for two more servings AFTER we went through all the pasta.  This is definitely going in my keeper box.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!!!!!

Great flavour! I cut the portions back to 1 and used 2 large cloves of garlic, we love garlic, and 1 can of clams.  I was in a bit of a rush to get dinner on the table so I let the clam juice simmer for 5 instead of 10 and in step I let it simmer for 10. I scooped the pasta out of the water and into the skillet to allow the pasta to absorb some of the flavour. I also added a ladle or two of the pasta water. I'll make this again. Thanks!

It's an easy recipe to make and it coordinates well with the making of the pasta, but it's bland.  I added extra garlic but it lacked flavor.  I will try it again with some freshly cracked black pepper, italian herbs, etc.  I think it has potential but is pretty much flavorless...

Made exactly as directed, added a little sprinkle of salt- the kids and doug LOVED this.  Used with 2 packages of buitoni linguini and good sauce to noodle ratio, plenty left over.  Be sure to let the noodles sit in the sauce a bit before serving, as they soak up some of the goodness and results in a perfect consistency to the sauce

We're lucky to live where we can get excellent quality fresh live manila clams and we're always looking for new ways to eat them. We substituted fresh steamed clams (we steam them in white wine, garlic, and butter most often) and used bottled clam juice in place of the canned clams and reserved liquid from the canned clams. This recipe will definitely be in rotation from now on!

Very good.  I am rating this as made from the recipe as posted.  I then made some changes on the next batch that I with a few changes made it even better.  My hubby gobbled it up and I was amazed by how much he liked the modified version.  I will post that version later.  Thanks for a great starter recipe.

I liked the recipe, but I changed a few things:
I felt that the half and half was too 'watery' so I used 3/4 cups half and half and a cup of heavy cream.  I added a pinch of red pepper, not 2 tbs of flakes.

Great recipe and easy to make! Whole family enjoyed it. NOTE: At some point recipe was modified from 2 Tbsp or red pepper to a pinch of red pepper. Most reviewers recommended between 1 and 2 tsp. I did follow another reviewer's suggestion and used shallots instead of onions and used 4 cans of clams (2 chopped, 2 minced).

This recipe was wonderful.  Only things I added were fresh crumbled bacon when I added the cream, and 1 tbspn lemon juice to the clam juice.  I also thickened the sauce with a little corn starch.  I had so much left over, I made clam chowder with it and it was delish!

My dh adores this dish!  I always sprinkle some cayenne in it instead of red pepper flakes, just enough to have some bite.  I think it needs either more cooking time or some cornstarch in order to make a thick sauce, but it tastes great whether it's thick or not!

Just made this for lunch for our family.  I followed the direction exactly and used 2 tablespoons of red pepper but it was too much.  I felt like it was all I tasted.  Next time, I would reduce it to 1 tablespoon or even less so we can taste other ingredients more.  I also thought that it made a lot of sauce (more than we needed) so we would increase the amount of pasta so we can enjoy the left over.

Great recipe, just made it tonight.  Used less than 1/4 cup of oil and added 1/4 stick of butter.  Also used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half.  Added two cans of whole clams, drained.  Didn't use any pepper since we're not spicy food eaters.  It was a huge hit with the family and in-laws.  Will make again.

This was good... but 2 TB red pepper is WAY too much!! I used 1 1/2 TB and it was burning as it went down. We had to eat it with bread.
I might try it again== maybe with 1/2 teaspoon red pepper instead.

This recipe was great! I did / would change a few things - I used 1/2 stick of butter and 1/4 cup olive oil instead of oil only. Also, the crushed red pepper was a little much for me so next time I will use 1/4 to 1/2 the amount. The sauce is not very thick - next time I am going to add a teaspoon or so of cornstarch to make a thicker sauce.

I found that this recipe was tasty but called for WAY too much red pepper flakes!  I used one tablespoon instead of two and it was still overly spicy.

Very good. I put less oil and and some roma cheese when cooking it to thicken it.

My mom and I decided to make this and try it for dinner tonight.  It was as easy as can be to make and really good.  We are adding it to our list of favourites.
