My kids devoured this recipe!  I cooked it in an electric pressure cooker for 45 min (from frozen chicken pieces) and could have done it for 30 min.  Don't forget to allow time for the PC to pressurize!  I'm still learning.

Oh, and the sauce was worth the wait!

My family is a huge fan of chicken so we are always looking for different ways to make it. I made a few changes to the recipe. I'm using chicken legs, as it was all I had on hand, i added a little onion powder and at the end I put in broccoli and carrots after I removed all the bones.

I made this per recommendation from my dad who made the night before and said it was excellent. I would definitely agree. Followed recipe to a T and it came out so tender it fell apart. I haven't really cooked a lot in my pressure cooker but found this to be so easy. Hubby said it was little too sweet so maybe I will cut back on the sugar. But I thought it was perfect. Update** A little trick I learned, have a second burner waiting heated to desired cooking temp and move the cooker to that burner after pressure is reached. Cook according to the timing directions. This helps to prevent burning. Thanks

Great recipe! I used 1 package of frozen boneless, skinless chicken thighs from Costco (I did cut the sugar to 1/2 c); I cooked it for 30 minutes in the pressure cooker. Once the chicken was done I took the chicken out and put chopped broccoli, onions, red bell pepper, and carrots in the steamer basket with all the broth. Steam for about 3 minutes. Add the chicken back to the pan, toss everything together and serve over rice. 
I will make this again!

I used my new Elite 10Qt Pressure Cooker. This turned out fantastic! I used boneless skinless breasts. My pressure cooker automatically sets the time and it cooked frozen breasts in 8 minutes and they were moist and tender. It seems some may have cooked theirs too long and thus the dryness. 

After spooning out the breasts, used some of the leftover broth to cook rice in the pressure cooker. Served with stir fry veggies! Fabulous!

This was a great starter base.  I made some changes... Used fresh pineapple, ginger and garlic instead of powder.  Also used defrosted chicken breast instead of thighs.  Added thinly sliced carrots. Cooked in pressure cooker for 9 minutes.  I wouldn't recommend longer cooking for breasts to avoid the meat getting tough.  I used tapioca starch instead of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Served it with green beans and rice.  My kids loved it.  We all had seconds.  Next time I'll add some yellow onions too.

Made the recipe exactly as described, using bone-in fresh chicken with the skin and the chicken was overcooked.  I'm going to cut back on the cooking time a little.  But the sauce was off the hook good.  I didn't thicken it with the optional ingredients but next time I will.  There is so much sauce that next time I make it I'm going to use the sauce for something the following night, maybe as a finishing sauce for marinated, grilled flank steak.

Easy and quick, but great taste.  I reheated the left overs with sautéed broccoli and vegetables and it was even better!  If your in a hurry to make a great meal, this is it.

We LOVED this recipe!  I gave it only 4 stars because the chef who posted is cooking it way too long.  ONLY COOK 8-10 MINUTES to keep chicken tender.  Cooking for 20 minutes sucks the life out of the chicken and makes it tough.  I read other people's reviews and looked in my pressure cooker manual which said to only cook thighs 8-10 minutes, so our chicken breasts and thighs were incredibly tender and moist.  Wonderful flavor.  I also didn't like all the pineapple mush at the bottom of the pan.  I took it out with the slotted spoon.

I made this tonite and it was great!  I love thigh meat, so I use only that.  I am notorious for taking a recipe like this and embellishing it a bit.  I added more veggies ( onions, celery, carrots and broccoli) to this recipe and yum!  What a meal!  I also used fresh ground ginger, my fav new spice!  Kids loved it!  Just the right amount of sweet, but not over the top.  Next time I will serve it over Basmati rice!  Great electric pressure cooker recipe!  Will make this again!

The recipe is delicious. I used exact ingredients, but added green pepper and onion. I did mine in a crockpot and chicken was wonderful.

The flavor is tasty, I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the chicken was a little on the dry side.  I used chicken breasts.  I did have trouble releasing the pressure when done, so that might have contributed to the dryness.  I would make this again.

After reading the reviews, I reduced the soy sauce and brown sugar to 1/2  cup each,  and the pineapple to 1/2 of can. Increased the broth to make up the liquid. And it was really yummy. It would have been too sweet and too strong on the soy sauce, otherwise.  You definitely need more cornstarch-  1/2 cup cornstarch in 1/4 cup water to thicken gravy. Would make it again!

This was a good recipe.  My chicken was dry as well, but I did use chicken breasts.  But, the sauce was yummy.  I will definitely make this again and next time, I would uct the chicken into bite-size pieces and see what happens.

So I started making this and realized it said PRESURE cooker and not SLOW cooker. So I put all the ingredients in and put my slow cooker on high for about 6 hours. This was amazing!!!  Will make again.

Oof, this was really good!  The only change I made was in the cooking time.  I cut it to 14 mins.  The chicken was so done, it was falling off the bones.  Next time, I'm going to reduce it to 12 mins.  

The pressure cooker really seals in the flavor like the chicken had been marinated overnight.  I served it on top of jasmine rice (also cooked in the pressure cooker).  

The other thing I did was that instead of making the gravy in the pressure cooker, I took the juice and put it in a pot on the stove and thickened the gravy there.  While I did that, the rice was cooking (1 min in the pressure cooker).  Oh, I will say that the gravy didn't thicken hardly at all with what was in the recipe.  I might add just a tad more.  

I loved it and will definitely make it again.

This was so easy and yummy! My kids and husband went crazy over it! I used frozen chicken breasts with the sauce in the pressure cooker. I let the pressure cooker fully pressurize and then cooked it for 25 minutes. For me, there was a little too much ginger but my family didn't think so. I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup instead of 3/4 cup. I just try to use less sugar if possible in all of my cooking. I honestly think it would have been great without brown sugar at all. Thanks for such a delicious, easy meal!

Wow the sauce was amazing! I did reduce the brown sugar 1/4 cup, substituted the garlic powder for a few crushed garlic cloves, & next time I will decrease the soy sauce a bit. There is definitely plenty of sauce which is great because I love tons of sauce & just smothered the chicken thighs in it :)

This did not turn out well at all. The sauce burned in the bottom   of the pan. (I suspected it would with that amount of sugar.)  I didn't cook it  the full time and the chicken was dry. This may be good if it was baked but is hard to say I wasn't able to taste sauce.

This was AMAZING! I used FROZEN boneless, skinless chicken breasts, because that's what we had. I added a bit more brown sugar to the sauce (AFTER cooking) because my super picky 6 year old prefers sweet to savory. He LOVED this, and so did we! We ate it for almost a whole week (changed sides & veggies) and NO ONE got bored! Much more than "just" a keeper; this will be my new go to meal if I forget to defrost something. I can't WAIT to try it with pork! I had all the ingredients in the pantry. Super easy, fast and delicious!!!

When the recipe was posted the AllRecipes team changed a few things. It was supposed to be only for an electric pressure cooker (any brand including Instant Pot) not a stove top. 20 minute cook time is for thighs so they fall apart and leave the chicken in the pot to break it up. Quick release pressure. It takes at least 3 or 4 Tbls of cornstarch mixed with a little water to thicken using the brown/saute setting. If you use breasts reduce the cook time in half.

My family loves it!  I didn't have chicken broth so I dropped in 3 chicken bullion cubes.  Substituted a large can of mandarin oranges instead of the pineapple this time and got even better reaction from the fam.  Also needs about a cup of corn starch for a thicker sauce.  Oh yeah, I used a pressure cooker instead of slow cooker.  Cooks in 18 minutes.

Retiree. First time, new pressure cooker, stove top. Followed the recipe exactly. Working wife walked in the door and it was ready! She couldn't stop telling me how much she liked it. I saved the sauce and will use it for something else. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this yesterday, so good.  I did cut the sugar and pepper in half.  Used five pounds skinless thighs and pulled the bones while shredding..  There was still plenty of sauce.  Not dry at all. People using chicken breasts will have dry meat because they cook much faster.  No reason to rate the recipe down when it was your change that caused it.

I've made this a few times now. I add whole baby carrots to cook with the chicken. It's an awesome addition! I also add the cooked rice to the sauce in the cooker with the chicken so it's all mixed together and the rice soaks up some of the sauce. Mmmm Mmmm, good!

Wow! Easy.  Chopped chicken to even sizes.  Browned in instant pot while prepping other ingredients.  Minced the ginger with knife and had few big chunks.  It is slightly sweet, but I like food like that.  Also, I was always brown with the Crisco used for baking.

We really liked this recipe however the Soy Sauce is very over powering.  I will be trying this again with less Soy Sauce. I used an electric Pressure Cooker.  After I cooked the 2.35 lbs. of chicken tenders (15 mins), I removed the chicken from pot and added 2 cups of rice instead of cornstarch.  After the rice was done I threw the chicken back in while the pot was on the warm cycle.  The chicken was not dry at all!  I will be making this dish again and adding veggie too.

I used a fresh pineapple instead of canned.  Personally I wouldn't mind if it was a bit less sweet; perhaps next time I'll only use 1/2 cup of brown sugar.   My wife and I loved it though, and I'll definitely be making this again and again.

This turned out great! Since we can't use soy sauce I substituted with 1/3 the amount and used Brags. I will definitely be using the teriyaki sauce on other dishes since it tasted so good!

This was so easy to make and turned out perfect.  For my family of 4, it was a crowd pleaser!  I did not change the settings though.  I cooked the chicken on high pressure for 20 minutes and it was perfect!

I am trying to use my pressure cooker more, and so I tried this recipe. I used an 8 oz can of pineapple instead of a 20 oz., and I also reduced the amount of sugar in the recipe to cut back on the sugar content.  I also used a combination of chicken breasts and boneless thighs (trimmed of fat) to make the meal a bit larger.  I added some hot pepper flakes as well.  It was still pretty sweet even with these reductions. 

All in all it was an ok recipe. I should have made it with some steamed broccoli for some crunch. It was a tad bland in that everything was the same consistency (I served it on rice). I'll make it again and try it with broccoli served alongside it.

This was so good! I also used a package of boneless skinless thighs from Costco, for 20 minutes. Separately steamed some veggies and mixed everything together once the sauce was done. Served over white rice and the family loved it! Will definitely make again!

Made to recipe.  Was short on ginger so only one tablespoon went in. It has a bit that wasn’t expected.  Will definitely make again.

This was a hit with our company. I did decrease sugar to 1/2 cup after reading many reviews, and I cooked it in my InstantPot for 10 minutes, that was more than enough. To thicken the sauce, I simply put the instant pot with sauce (chicken removed with slotted spoon) on the stove and added the cornstarch

Halved the brown sugar.  Used canned sliced pineapple but did not put it in to cook with the chicken.  Used chicken broth instead of stock because that is what I had on hand.  Set the Instant Pot for 12 minutes; chicken was done.  Took the chicken out and tried to cook the rice in the Instant Pot.  Messed up the proportions by using 1 cup of rice to about 2 cups of liquid.  Did not finish cooking and had a lot of liquid left over, so drained the rice and put it on the stove with a little more liquid.  Took the rest of the liquid and added corn starch to make the best sauce!  The rice was very good once it finished on the stove and dinner was a success!

Tried it tonite, with 3 chicken breasts.  Instead of garlic powder, added 1 tsp. fresh garlic and a bit of onion powder.  I probably didn’t allow enough time to really thicken the sauce, bit this is definitely a dish that I will make again.

Yalllllll I thought I was doomed

Realized after starting that I was missing not only broth, but ginger AND soy sauce!! I was panicked 

Substituted the ginger and soy sauce with Dale's as it's primarily soy sauce with some ginger garlic onion etc
Substituted broth with some chicken knorr and water 

It came out so good still! And the chicken so tender
I'm sure the original recipe is even better

Moust & Delicious! On my insta pot there isn't a function to lower the temperature. Instead I lowered the pressure. I didn't put in the whole can of pineapple, just some juice and a few chuncks.

I followed the ingredients as listed on the recipe, but 2 TABLEspoons of ground ginger and garlic powder was too much. I will definitely just use 2 TEAspoons next time I make it. My pressure cooker instruction booklet said to cook boneless chicken thighs for 8 mins on high pressure and that time was plenty.

I loved this dish. I listened to other reviewers and ended up using 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup soy, as I knew my wife and I would like a simpler taste. I used a lemon balsamic vinager along with a dash of Crown infused cinnamon maple syrup.  For broth I used 1/2 teaspoon vegetable boullion and 1/2 teaspoon beef bouillon.  Lots of chopped fresh garlic, ginger, and pineapple. The two breast’s went in whole then after 15 I shredded them with fork and let them rest in the juice and then spooned over dry basmati rice. Yumm, the pineapple made a great side, all was eaten.

I made this dish and it was delicious! The entire family agreed it was full of flavor and very moist! The only change I made was that I used coconut aminos instead of the soy sauce. Will definitely be adding this recipe into the rotation.

This comes out so tasty and I love that it only took 20 minutes in my electric pressure cooker (I thawed my chicken thighs first). The only substitutions I made were worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce and finely chopped mandarin oranges instead of crushed pineapples. I served it over rice and a side dish of mixed Asian vegetables. I ran out of time to do the cornstarch the thicken the sauce but it was delicious even without that step. I will definitely make this dish again,

The family LOVED it!  I love that I had everything on hand and it was super easy to put together.  I did take the advice of other reviewers (I always read the reviews!) and reduced the sugar by half and reduced the cooking time.  My Cuisinart pressure cooker did the job in 8 minutes.

I saw the comments about being too sweet, so I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  Also my daughter doesn’t like pineapple so I pureed that before adding it.  And we like breasts, so I used frozen chicken tenderloins, cooked as suggested. Added broccoli and carrots on the side.  My family loved it.  This is definitely something I will make again.

Wow. Amazing. I followed the recipe, but I did read the reviews and decided to take all the advice. I used thin chicken breasts and cut them into bite sized chunks, and I only cooked for 14 minutes. One thing that made this easy is I made the sauce in a super tall cup with a hand blender. That made it easy and fast. Make sure to also use the juice from the pineapple can!

This turned out very well.  Everyone agreed we would have it again.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and shredded it once done.  Chicken was moist, sauce thickened right up as promised with cornstarch. This was a great 20 minute dinner and would work well if you added broccoli to it.  I added a bit more ginger than the recipe called for (because I spilled it) but it came out just fine. It had a bit of a kick to it, but we liked it.  Very simple, very quick. Definitely going into our dinner rotation!

Too sweet. Not terrible, but not the “teriyaki” flavor I was expecting or hoping for. I probably won’t make again.

I followed the recipe as written with the exception of mincing fresh ginger (I did not have ground ginger on hand), marinating the meat in the sauce for two hours, and using chicken breasts. That last change is the important one. If you are cooking chicken breasts the timing of the cooking is critical. I cooked a little over 3 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken breasts that were halved in 10 minutes and they were slightly overcooked. 

The timing on thickening the sauce is inaccurate. It took about twice as much time (6 minutes) with twice as much corn starch. That said, the rating is four stars because I liked this recipe a lot but my wife did not. Five stars should be for a recipe that will be a crowd pleaser but some might find it a bit too sweet.

Followed the recipe and it just wasn't proper teriyaki. I made 2 small changes:  I used gluten-free, reduced sodium, soy sauce. I reduced sugar as recommended by other reviewers. It was still too sweet. Also the chicken didn't soak in the flavor, either.  
My recommendations would be: Add fresh garlic and ginger (minced) instead of the grounded or powdered. Only use 1/3 of recommended sugar if using gluten-free soy sauce. Lastly, double the sauce (without cornstarch) and use half to marinate the chicken the night before. Add cornstarch to the non-marinade half of the batch, if you'd like.

Other than this being way to sweet, it was pretty good.  I used both chicken breasts and thighs (hubby doesn't like dark meat).  I'm waiting to see how it is as a leftover dish to see if the spices meld together better.  I think grated fresh ginger and minced garlic would enhance the flavor.  It's worth another try.

I used chicken breast instead  (because it was a better price, weird huh.)  I cut them into 2x2 inch pieces. I have an instant pot and just used the soup button with no adjusting, I  used a quick release, then I used the Saute function to thicken the sauce. Turned out pretty good. I think it would be better with chicken thighs though.

I really REALLY liked the sauce's taste--but it does fall short of both the dark color and sharp bold taste of teriyaki sauce.  I'm planning a next time, using frozen Asian stir-fry veggies and serving this recipe over LO-MEIN noodles; that should hit 5 stars. LOVE the convenient ease--and amazing speed--of pressure cooking!!

This was a really good recipe! A couple things I did that really worked well: first of all I trimmed a ton of excess fat off the meat before cooking. Don't worry about trying to get it all off, or you'll be there all day! ;) Doing this at the beginning will eliminate the need to skim the fat off the top at the end. Secondly, I added a tsp of red pepper flakes to the sauce mixture and that really added a bit of a kick to the dish! I have a Pressure Cooker XL and as far as I can tell, there is not way to lower the heat during the process of cooking (I'm totally new the the pressure cooker thing, so I could be wrong?!), so I cooked it for 18 minutes on the chicken setting and it was falling apart good! Definitely a keeper recipe!

It was a good recipe although not necessarily a great recipe. It was easy to prepare and tasted fine.  I did cook the chicken for only 10 minutes instead of the suggested 20 minutes and it turned out great.  This is an easy dinner to whip together for the family although I didn't feel it was good enough to serve it to company.  I cooked this one in my Instant Pot.  And if you don't have an Instant Pot yet, I suggest you do a little research and see if it might be a useful tool in your kitchen, too.

I used boneless skinless breaths and it was absolutely delicious
We had leftover sauce so saves it to use for leftovers !

I made no changes and it was fantastic!
This was my maiden voyage with my electric pressure cooker. This was a winner!
Plenty of leftovers too :D

I halved the amount of ginger because I'm not a huge fan of the flavor.  This recipe was DELICIOUS and tender.  I ended up using a second pan to boil the teriyaki sauce and corn startch mixture.  My kids loved it.

This was super easy, and tasted great!  The only difference was I used Braggs aminos, as I was out of soy sauce. I had fresh ginger, so used half fresh ginger and half spice ginger. I served over rice with steamed broccoli...omg, simply awesome!

Simple and Fast.  I served it over rice and the whole family enjoyed it! 
It was a little watery, so I'll have to play withit the next time I make it.

Made it exactly as the recipe says, except I had to add a bit more cornstarch for the sauce to thicken properly - al least for my taste. It was very, very good. Tender and moist and put over rice. Yum. It's a keeper!

It was my first time using the pressure cooker so I was really nervous and exhausted. The recipe over all was really simple to make. Next time,  I would use boneless chicken breast or just cook it a little longer. My husband is picky about undercooked chicken. Need to get use to the pressure cooker.

Only change I made was to add a whole  can of chicken broth (low sodium), some dehydrated garlic & onion.Sauce was great. Chicken was tender. Used boneless, skinless chicken breasts  because that is what I had. Will make again.

Great for a first time recipe in the Instant Pot.  I only made two changes. I had a 2lb bag of frozen chicken tenders, so I added in raw broccoli and carrots, and I reduced the cooking time to 15 minutes.  The chicken came out tender and tasty, and, even though the sauce is strong, I think it is perfect for pairing with a bland medium like white rice, brown rice, etc.

Would make again, added chopped garlic from jar and really thin slices of ginger.  Sauce was really good.   Ended up freezing leftover sauce in baggies for  a quick sauce with white rice.

I was a little worried about the can of pineapple, but after reading a bunch of comments that was never a complaint from anybody. I did add a chopped onion and some frozen broccoli. The rest of the ingredients, I did exactly as the recipe called for except I used fresh ginger and lots of sirarcha and boneless skinless chicken thighs. I set my pressure cooker on stews/soup which cooks for 8 minutes. It turned out perfectly. So delicious. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

This is essentially a sweet & sour chicken recipe, not teriyaki.  The sauce was okay, but too sweet for my taste and lacked the depth of flavor of true teriyaki.

Followed recipe to a "T" and my family of 5 gave it 5 stars.   My daughter threw in some peanuts and I thought that was a nice addition, but this recipe doesn't need additions to be great.

The only thing I did was added 1/2 cup of soy sauce instead of 3/4.  I probably could have used even less.  Otherwise I did exactly as it said and it was awesome!  Next time I make it I am going to add some crunchy veggies and maybe cashews or something just for some extra health!

This was a huge crowd pleaser. My wife and kids all enjoyed this. I decreased the ginger a little but added  about 1.5 teaspoons of  siracha to give it a little heat. This meal has officially been added to my family's dinner menu.

I only changed it slightly instead of chicken broth I added a cup of water and tossed in two bouillon cubes. I also added an onion chopped into bite size pieces. This was my very first electric pressure cooker recipe and I loved it. I used my 10 qt elite and the chicken was perfect not too dry either. Great recipe will make this again for sure.

Loved this recipe ... added a sliced onion on the bottom, cut way back on brown sugar (used about 1/4 c) and added a healthy squirt of sriracha. I had a combo of boneless thighs and breasts and cooked for 20 minutes.  Delicious!

This really didn't work for me.  It just tasted like pineapple and soy sauce.  Way too sweet.  Needs much less sugar and perhaps just 1/4 can of the pineapple. Next time I'll use fresh minced garlic and grated ginger as well - I think these pack a punch in the pressure cooker and are much better.  (It's clear my expectation of the teriyaki sauce is different from what this recipe makes.)

This was my first attempt and using a pressure cooker so I was expecting it to take less time that it did.  I only had 1.5 lbs of chicken thighs so I did change the original recipe slightly. I only gave it 4 stars because it was spicier than I expected, I think next time I'll cut the ginger in half and do a mix of thighs & breast meat and there will def be a next time.

Pretty darn tasty! After reading the reviews, I decided to use 1/2 cup each of brown sugar and soy sauce. It was a mild teriyaki flavor and I served it over rice. I also used boneless chicken thighs and it only took ten minutes in my electric pressure cooker. I will definitely make this again on a work night when I need something quick.

I crushed pineapple leftover from another recipe. Since I had 2 lbs of chicken thighs, I cut everything else back. However, I further reduced the liquids from what would have been 1 1/2 cups to 1 of only soy sauce and chicken stock combined. I left out the sugar and used fresh garlic and ginger. I reduced cooking time to 15 minutes because I was short of time and it seemed that would be long enough to assure the chicken would be done. I ended up with tons of sauce which 2 tbls of cornstarch barely thickened, and if I'd added the sugar, the sauce would have been way too sweet. The thighs were also a little dry. I like the idea of this recipe--quick and easy--so will likely try it again further reducing the starting liquids, increasing the garlic and ginger and cutting a few more minutes off the cooking time.
