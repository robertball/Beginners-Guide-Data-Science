Try with other varieties of mustards....Edouard Fallot's mustards are also from Dijon and come in amazing varieties....mustard w green peppercorns, or basil, or tarragon.  Available in gourmet stores and very tasty!  Also varied this recipe as my daughter doesn't care for mustard and substituted small dollops of Boursin cheese instead - it was well appreciated!

It was delicious! I wouldn't change a thing! A great way to use leftover ham. I will make this again.

This was a great dish to make with a low amount of ingredients but pretty tasty. I put a bit too much salt in mine. But otherwise healthy, thanks mate!
