This dish is not terrible, but should not really be called arroz con pollo.  It is more like a blander Americanized version of chicken and rice.  Where is the chorizo?  Where is the oregano?  Where is the cumin?  Where is the lime juice?  Where are the peas?  Where are the olives or capers?  I realize arroz con pollo is not a recipe that is set in stone, and that it has many variations, but if you want a more traditional dish, you need to go beyond this recipe.

The Idea behind Arroz con Pollo is a one pot dish, as many of you from Spanish decent already know. The recipe is fine to follow but instead of removing as you cook, just keep adding the ingredients as you go, then add your rice and stock, Oh and also remember a whole cut up chicken works as well; if not even more flavorful.

This was great!!  I omitted the tomatoes to make it more like the restaurant Arroz con Pollo, and it was!  I used bone-in chicken breasts, so I had to cook the chicken a little longer.  Also, I cut down the oil to 1 tablespoon to reduce the fat.  Wasn't even missed!  The second time I used boneless chicken breasts (big time saver), and olive oil instead of vegetable oil - noticeable difference in the flavor!!  Will do that again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe, but it's better if you cook the chicken with the onions and leave the chicken in while adding the rice, etc.  This allows the chicken to absorb the flavors of the other ingredients.

Thanks Carol, great recipe! The first time I made this, I felt the white wine and green pepper overwhelmed the other flavors. The second time I cut the white wine in half and omitted the green peppers. The third time I made it, I omitted the wine, the green peppers, and added some grated cheddar cheese. Wonderful! No leftovers on the third try.

Very good recipe...Not a traditional Arroz Con Pollo recipe though but a good alternate.  I marinated my chicken for a few hours(any liquid works-buttermilk, italian dressing etc..) then browned chicken on both sides in oil then added peppers(used red), onion, garlic and did the rest as listed but never removed the chicken from the pan-I let it finish cooking in all the liquids with the rice(rice is put in uncooked not cooked) and it was super moist.
I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of stewed and I didn't have saffron so I used Abodo and extra Hungarian paprika(probably a little too much-it was spicy!) and I skipped the parsley.  Very good dish with great flavor.  Will make again and I look forward to the left-over tomorrow!

This was really simple and good.  One suggestion I have is to warm up the chicken broth separately and allow the saffron threads to soften so the flavor is better distrubuted.  This shouldn't necessarily taste like spanish rice so I don't agree with some reviews adding cumin, but I would add a squeeze of fresh lime and substitute the parsley for cilantro.

This was OK, a bit bland. After seeing the price for the saffron ($16) for a small bottle, I used tumeric ($5) like someone suggested. I kept the chicken in the skillet the whole time. Healthy 
meal.

I thought this was really good, and easier than some arroz con pollo recipes that I have seen. As a chef I have to tell all of you that substituted tumeric for saffron, and then complained of lack of flavor, that this is the problem!! Saffron and Turmeric are NOT interchangeable.  Turmeric will give you the yellow color, but almost no flavor.  Saffron imparts a very unique flavor to food that cannot be duplicated!! To get even more flavor out of it warm the chicken broth and steep the saffron threads in it for a few minutes before adding it to the other ingredients.  This will result in more flavor as well as a more even, brighter yellow color.  The only thing that I would add to this recipe is some coarsely chopped green olives. Chicken thighs could also be substituted for the breasts, for a moister, less expensive chicken option.  Remember this is Spanish style arroz con pollo, and if you are looking for this to taste like something from a mexican restaurant, this may not be what you are looking for.  This did taste similar to paella, and arroz con pollo that we had in Mallorca Spain!!

New cook here, just wanted to say I was really impressed with how quick and easy this recipe was!  I didn't have any saffron, so I used a little tumeric just for color, and also substituted 1/4 c. apple juice, 2tbs. vinegar, and 2 tbs. lemon juice for the white wine.  We all thought it was pretty darn good just the same!  Thanks Carol.

Wow!  Couldn't care less if this is traditional or not, it tastes fabulous!
Didn't have any saffron, and the store didn't either, so I used a package of saffron rice and it worked beautifully!  Will definitely make again!

The flavor of this dish was incredible! I went out and bought the saffron for it ($16.99) and am so glad I did! Added a little chile powder, oregano, cumin and a can of peas. Delicious... thank you so much, Carol!

Cooked it and served it in my cast iron skillet with the parsley sprinkled on top.  Looked very pretty on the table.  Tasty.  My family is Colombian, and they are used to having this with prunes and olives stirred in.  I used 1/4 cup tequila instead of wine.  Also doubled the paprika.  Served with steamed broccoli on the side.  Yummy.

One of those dishes that you can't stop eating.  My husband requested that I make it once a week.  My 11-year-old son is a very picky eater and whined about what I was making all afternoon before dinner.  He actually admitted afterwards that it was "not bad."  (A huge compliment.)  I did not use saffron because I didn't have any, but I wouldn't change a thing.  This dish gets even better when it sits a little bit, so you can prepare it and keep on warm until you are ready to eat it no problem.

I'm a novice when it comes to cooking but I was able to make this one and it came out yummy.  I served it to my girlfriend and her three kids and it was well received.  BTW, I'm Italian descent so I don't have a long standing family tradition as to what is, "Arroz Con Pollo", so I could just accept this dish for what it is, good ingredients and flavors that is mostly healthy. :)  Buon Appetito!

This was excellant,  I did use hungarian paprika instead of the blander regular and I used a white wine substitute. This is a great recipe to use that saffron that is sitting in the back of your spice rack.  I did grind my safron and let it sit in a cup of hot chicken broth before I added it as others have suggested. Thanks

Delicioso!!!  Decided to try this recipe just because its title has my name in it.  But when my family tried it they gave it 5 stars. The only difference was that my husband wanted arroz con pollo but with the bone in the chicken so I cut up some chicken thighs and cooked.  It took a bit longer because of the way the chicken was being cooked.  Then right before the rice was done I transfered it to a baking dish, spread it out and arranged the thighs on top, covered it with foil for another 10 to 15 minutes and it came out perfect.  Great taste, I have family coming over next weekend and I think I'm going to impress them with this recipe.

Even though I had to improvise a little, since I didn't have the exact ingredients on hand, this meal was delicious! Mr. PickyPants pronounced it "yummy." We love rice, so this recipe will stay in my rotation.

P.S. Like most other reviewers, I didn't have saffron on hand. I used about 1/4 t. cumin instead -- I like cumin, and didn't mind if the rice wasn't yellow.

don't listen to MLEESS, she/he is obviously confused and doesn't know their recipes/ethnic foods.  The one she/he is thinking of is Paella, Arroz con Pollo (MLEESS you paying attention?...) translates to chicken with rice... (not con (frijoles..peas, not con chorizo)  this  recipe is great, the perfect simplicity of it makes it AUTHENTIC

I cook the chicken differently which takes longer but it comes out more tender and flavorful. I end up with a sauce that I later pour over the rice. Anyways, Carol's approach to arroz con pollo is easy and authentic. Tostones go perfectly with this (who am I kidding? tostones go with everything!!) and slices of avocado, mmm.

I've never had "original" arroz con pollo, so I can't compare this recipe to that.  Regardless, this was delicious and pretty easy to prepare! I took several readers' suggestions and added a can of chopped green chiles and 1/2 teas. of chilie powder.  Also let the chicken simmer along with the rice as suggested, which made the chicken very tender.  My husband, who NEVER cooks, wanted the recipe so he could make it for his buddies. It is now one of his favorites. Thanks, Carol, for a real keeper.

My husband begged me to find this recipe.  My kids and husband loved it!  I have never been a fan of this dish so I'm taking my opinion out of the equation and giving it the 5 stars that they insist it deserves.

Absolutely delicious!  The only changes I made were I used diced tomatoes with garlic (I didn't have any stewed tomatoes) and I added about 1/2 c of chopped Portuguese smoked chourico.  Seasoning was just perfect!

Fantastic!  Nice and easy recipe for someone just starting out like me.  The only thing I did differently was keep the chicken in the whole time.  That way the flavors from the wine and the tomato got absorbed.  Otherwise, a sure-fire hit :-)

This was very good.  I'm not good at going strictly by a recipe, but did not change much in this one.  I didn't have saffron, so substituted tumeric as suggested by others.  I added some cayenne for "kick". I used chicken thighs (boneless) because the meat is more tender and seasoned with adobo/garlic powder/salt/black pepper before browning.  Other than that, didn't change a thing.  It was really good.  I'm not sure it's truly "arroz con pollo" but we are keeping this recipe.

Extremely tasty and easy dish!  I substituted 2 packets of Sazon Goya seasoning for the saffron and 1/4 cup water + 1/4 cup white grape juice for the white wine.  Absolutely delicious...

This recipe is awesome!  It's just as good as the Arroz con Pollo at any Mexican restaurant!  I added sliced mushrooms and didn't have white wine so for that I substituted 1/4 c. vermouth and 1/4 c. water.  And I do think that the saffron is an important ingredient...not only for color but its flavor which gives it a really nice earthiness.

This is a good recipe and makes a lot I do use bone in chicken and yellow rice with the saffron already in it, a lot cheaper than buying saffron, thanks for sharing I have made this many times and am asked to pass recipe on.

Delicious!  I left out the tomatoes and used red peppers instead of green.  I also left the chicken in the entire time instead of taking it out and putting it back in.  I had a little less than a cup of rice, so I was worried there'd be too much liquid at the end, but it was fine.  I also steeped the saffron in the broth before adding to the mixture.  Very tasty, and I'm sure a one dish meal on it's own, but we had some veggies and rolls with it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was an easy, healthy, and tasty dish. The only change I made was that I put in a dash of cumin instead of saffron since saffron is so expensive and I didn't have it on hand. 

The texture of the rice was great and the cooking time was accurate. I'd say the primary flavor was from the tomatoes, so if you like a spicy dish or if you are not a big fan of tomatoes, you might want to tweak this. My husband suggested that next time we make this, we might add some roasted pasilla peppers to get a little deeper flavor and some heat, since this dish is not hot at all. Overall, good flavor and a nice, homey meal.

I modified this recipe in great deal after reading a few previous reviews. Instead of using chicken breast I used whole cut up chicken. Also, I replaced paprika to Mexican chili powder. Finally I added capers and some pork sausages and omitted salt quite a bit. It turned out super delicious and tasted much more like the authentic style I used to eat!

Read through all the reviews to see if any other people were strapped like I was... no white wine, no chicken broth, no stewed tomatoes, no saffron - but drawn to this recipe even so. No white wine was not a problem (so fear not!) Stewed fresh tomatoes myself in water with chicken bouillon cubes -- worked perfectly. Used turmeric instead of saffron. Used poblano pepper as did not have bell. Also kicked it up a lot with Creole seasonings and crushed red peppers.  Cooked chicken as directed, then heated up with a little oil to give it a crunchier bite and texture. We LOVED this recipe and I will definitely be making it again. Will make it next time according to directions, but loved how flexible this was.

nice. i swear this dish gets better/spicer with age.  my substitutions include jasmine rice for long grain, a can of peeled tomatoes (chopped) for stewed tomatoes, water and bullion for chicken broth, and chardonnay for the wine.  i'll definitely try this again.

I use this recipe all the time.  I have never used saffron in it and I think it tastes wonderful.  If I don't have wine on hand, I substitute with beer.  Also, I like using diced tomatoes instead of stewed.

This is one of my FAVORITES!!!  I add red and yellow peppers to make it more colorful, but otherwise follow the recipe as written.  It's also GREAT as leftovers the next day (if there is any left).

This is one of my favorite recipes that I make often.  Because saffron is hard to find and a bit expensive I use Goya flavor packet.  I also make this with chirizo instead of chicken.  I have made this for company, and everyone loved it.

Loved this dish! I couldn't find saffron at my local market, so I substituted and used one cup white rice and one cup saffron-flavored Mahatma rice...delicious, my family couldn't get enough of this tasty dish.

I'll sidestep the "is it authentic" debate since I've never eaten arroz con pollo before.  I will say that I thought it was really good.  As some suggested, I left the chicken in while the rice cooked.  Some suggested adding peas near the end of the cooking time so I did, but I don't think they really added anything and I would probably leave them out if I made it again.  Overall I thought it was a really tasty dish.

Pretty good but I use Goya yellow rice (Mexican flavored) and add a hot pepper or two for more flavor.  Also, I don't chop up the chicken and I use whichever chicken part is cheap that week.

Here's how I solved the saffron issue (expensive/readily available): I used saffron rice. The brand I used already had garlic and onion in it, so I did not add any more. I also chose stewed tomatoes that already had green chili (versus bell) peppers mixed in. These changes simplified the prep and the result was very good.

I found this to be just an "ok" meal... seems like Spanish rice with saffron & chicken.  I had to add extra seasoning & more water/broth to cook the rice.  There's a recipe on this site labeled "Original Spanish rice" which is MUCH MUCH better... just add chicken. Beats this recipe by a mile!

I would give this 3-1/2 stars.  It was good, but not great.  I did leave out the tomatoes 'cuz in Honduras where I live, the Arroz con Pollo doesn't contain them.  I would use this as a base recipe and modify to fit my families taste.  Thanks for submitting.

I have a few things to say... one person was talking about chorizo and capers and olives ... that must be the Puerto Rican kind because we are Cuban and while we do use cumin, we do not use all that other stuff.  If you want to try something the way my abuela does, use beer instead of wine and use fresh saffron.  It's expensive but tasty!  We don't use parsley nor paprika.  We do put vigo in or bijol and we also put a packet of Sazon con Azafran.  I do put some fresh lemon on my chicken and sprinkle cumin on it.  These are just ideas to incorporate.  Incorporate some or just a couple.  Salud!

I love this recipe. I increase the amount of salt and spices, probably because my tomatoes have no salt. It's an easy recipe to play around with and is always a hit when I have unexpected company I have to cook for.  Some of the reviews and substitutions here are... interesting... to say the least. If it tastes bad after you substitute half of the ingredients, I don't think it's the recipe's fault!

Tastes absolutely authentic.  I have tried many variations of this dish and this one is one of the best.  A less expensive alternative to saffron is sazon goya with tomato, available in the hispanic section of most grocery stores. I use beer instead of wine (the tradition in my Cuban family).  I also used whole chicken breast tenders and left them in to boil with everything else.  Awesome!

Made this for my cooking club where the theme was comfort food with a twist. The recipe on it own was a great, easy dish, however, I did make slight adjustments. I boiled my chicken in a dutch oven with adobo seasoning for an hour on low-medium then shredded the chicken. I placed the chicken on a paper plate then sauted the veggies, added the rice (which I used Vigo yellow rice), added two extra cloves of garlic and a tsp of cumin. When the rice had 5 minutes cooking time left I added the shredded chicken. After this, it was 5 stars!

This is one of the main staples in our kitchen.  Try it with bone-in chickin to have a more moist meat.

yum yum.  this is very easy and extremely tasty.  i do not use alcohal w/my cooking so i just subbed extra broth.  i may just cut down on taht extra liquid next time, the rice was a tad on the wet side when the dish was ready.  but that had no impact on the flavor.  this was sooooo delicious!  i could'nt find saffron @my store so i used some tumeric for color.  hopefully i can find saffron in the near future so i know what that adds.  a big hit w/the family and at work.  i referred my co-workers to this recipe.  it's so good.  thanks.

I read all the reviews and took note of the comments about saffron either being too expensive or not available, using turmeric as a substitute and saffron rice packets. The real stuff is expensive, if it is not, then you have a cheap substitute. I would suggest you may wish to search hard and get some and then try the dish again. Although Carol's recipe is not the same as mine (each spanish speaking country has its own version) there is a tremendous difference in taste when you use the real thing. Just a pinch wil do and as others suggested, let the saffron meld with a bit of warmed broth for 15 minutes before using. It will be well worth it. BTW - the 3 star rating is because I was forced to provide a rating in order to submit my comments.

Made a few changes, used brown rice, had to double the amount of rice as this rice didnt swell and absorb liquid as well as white rice. Had to cook 40 min. to allow time for moisture to absorb. I doubled the saffron, used olive oil instead of vegtable. Pan was too shallow to ad the meat so I mixed it all in a baking dish for 15 min. at 350 and served. When rice didnt absorbe I had my doubts but this turned out great. Nice flavor, everyone asked me to make it again. I will be buying an oversized deep frying pan so I can leave chicken in while cooking.

Although I liked this recipe a lot, I changed it up a bit. I left the chicken in the whole time, I added canned green chiles instead of bell peppers, I didn't add the saffron or stewed tomatoes, I added fresh mushrooms, and I added in some chile powder and cumin. Although I wouldn't relate this dish to mexican food, it was definatly somthing I would make again.

I thought this was a nice, simple and easy meal; I was in the mood for saffron and this satisfied my craving...the rice was creamy and the flavors were nice (I used extra saffron, omitted the tomatoes).  You could really add many different veggies, for variety, ie) we ate it with broccoli and it was very good.   I would also try artichokes or palmitos.  Also, I used brown rice because we prefer for flavor and nutrition, but it requires a little extra broth and longer cooking time.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I made it all in one pan.  Cut the chicken in chunks, browned it a little first in the oil. Added onions, pepper and garlic and let that brown a little.  Added the rice and let it cook a little then added the rest of the ingredients as listed.  Really nice flavor and very easy to make.

Added chourico and cut the chicken in half.  Super yummy and very easy to make.  I also left the meat in the pan while everything cooked.  It definitely added more flavor and it did not over dry the chicken.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. Nice and mild for the kids.  However, there is an arroz con pollo crock pot recipe I've been making for years that calls for peas, chipotle peppers, and adobo powder.  Next time I will probably combine the two recipes since I personally really enjoy it my "old" way too.  This is a really excellent recipe though!!

This was very good! I used brown rice, already steamed, and used canned diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  I also added a tsp. of Mexican oregano.  I think next time I'll use hot smoked paprika on the chicken, just due to personal preferences.  Great dish!

I made this for the first time tonight - followed the recipe to a T, except used diced tomatoes instead of stewed, because that was what I had on hand.  It was really tasty, and even my (ahem) culinarily challenged (read: picky) husband had two helpings.  We will definitely make this again!

This dish was fabulous! The only thing I did different was added a spice called sazon. I also put sour cream on top and sliced up an avocado. It was THE BEST! I can't wait to eat it again.

This is my 2nd time making this and it is so good!  I  didn't  make  this  the  first time  with  saffron  (  so  expensive )  or  white  wine  (  personal  perfence  )  and  I  used  roasted  garlic, YUM! Ricky Ricardo sure knew what he was talking about.I forgot to say that I would add extra rice to this recipe.

Great start for an awesome recipe.  Needed some heat for me so I added chili powder, crushed red peppers and some cumin.  Also used tumeric instead of saffron, and brown rice instead of the long grain rice.  Great leftovers, too!

A very nice, easy-to-do weeknight recipe.  These are ingredients I generally always have on hand, except for the saffron (which I now do!).  A solid 4 star for this family.  I understand that it's not really an Arroz Con Pollo, but who cares when it is tasty.  Plus, if an ingredient is missing, i.e., bell pepper, parsley, wine, it would still be tasty.  Why is it not a 5 star for us?  I reserve the 5 star ratings for those very few recipes my family would be happy to eat once a week or more and always request.  This is a recipe they'd be glad to see once a month.  Great work, Carol!

This is yummy and healthy and comes together quickly.  I didn't have a green pepper or white wine, so I subbed carrots and vodka (weird subs, I know--but it turned out excellent anyway).

this recipe has everything that i look for - versatility, ease of preparation, and it's good for you too! i had to make several changes based on what i had, and since i wasn't too concerned with making it a true "arroz con pollo" it didn't matter. i used all chicken broth (no wine), tomato sauce instead of stewed tomatoes, and 2 boneless chicken breasts. i added oregano, cumin, and used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. DELICIOUS! we really enjoyed this and i wil definitely make again.

I liked the recipe.  I made some changes, including using turmeric, dry mustard, and cumin instead of saffron (approx 1/8 tsp each).  I was going for the taste of Costa Rican arroz con pollo, which uses Salsa Lizano (these spices are some of the key ingredients).  The taste was not exactly what I'd hoped for, but it was good and my guest enjoyed it.  I also used red peppers instead of green.  Lastly, I dumped the chicken, onions, and peppers in a large pot, added the rice (I used 2-1/2 cups), sauteed for a few minutes, then dumped in a box of chicken broth.  Overall, I liked it, and the changes were relatively minor.

Good base recipe but not spicy enough for my liking so I took the suggestions of others and added chili powder, cumin, and hot pepper sauce to give it more kick. I also added some frozen peas and some lime juice. I made it all in one pot and kept adding ingredients as suggested by other reviewers. I used brown basimati rice, so doubled the cooking time. I'll make this again with the modifications and will either use less liquid or add more rice to make it a little drier. Easy one pot meal.

This recipe was a huge hit with my hubby, he told me to definitely keep the recipe and make it often. The kids, not so much! My daughter and 4 year old son ate this on flour tortillas, they liked it that way. My teenager did not love this. I have just started the South Beach Diet so rice is a no-no. I reserved some for my dinner before I added the rice to the pan, I thought it was good, not fabulous, but really good. I did not have any saffron, could not find it at the store, but next  time that I make this I will be sure to have saffron on hand.

Great!! I use a can of Rotel in place of tomatoes and bell pepper, makes it very spicy, oddly enough. I love this recipe, easy, great leftovers. I use boneless chicken thighs instead for more flavor.

This was good. I did as others suggested and just kept adding the ingredients to the pot for a single-pot meal. I wasn't about to send $30 in my supermarket for saffron, so I tried this with a bag of saffron rice instead. It was very good. I would like to try with real saffron and probably will at some point, but for a quick weeknight meal for cheap, the bag of saffron rice worked great.

This recipie turned out very well -- even my picky daughters liked it and I really thought that they'd turn their noses up at it. The only change that I made was to use tumeric instead of saffron (I didn't have any) and substituted additional chicken broth for the wine. Very delicious and quite easy to make -- definitely a keeper!

I didn't remove the chicken from the pan after it was browned so that it could absorb the flavor of the onion, garlic, etc. I added cumin seed, capers, and lime juice to taste.

Great recipe.  I used thighs and wings on the bone instead of boneless chicken and simmered it for 20 minutes with the rice mixture.  Also, I took out the chicken pieces at the end and put it under the broiler for a few minutes to make it crispier.  Delicious!

My family and I absolutely LOVED this recipe.  Barely three bites in, all of my children were asking to have it again. I did add mushrooms, because my favorite arroz con pollo has mushrooms in it.  This recipe is definitely a winner, and will be made time and again in my house!

This is really average and suprisingly bland.  Either find another recipe OR plan on spicing this one up with your favorite peppers and/or hot sauce.  I was disapponted.

I thought this was quite tasty, but I had some issues. I used brown rice, which I think is why I had problems with the recipe.  It took almost two hours to get the rice soft enough to eat.  Once it was cooked though, it was delicious.  I also used red bell pepper (I think green tastes like dirt) and low sodium chicken broth.  So anyway, I think the issues I had were my fault, not the recipe's.

I thought this recipe was awesome.  I took a few suggestions from others and added one or two of my own.  I used tumeric vs. saffron, AND used the saffron rice pkg suggested by others.  The bag I used was well over the 1 cup the recipe called for so I did not add additional rice, but I did end up using the entire bag.  I also used far more garlic than the recipe called for as we enjoy a lot of garlic in our food.  I also used some smoked sausage with the chicken.  My husband and I decided next time we would use 1/2 chicken and 1/2 sausage.  The recipe was not lacking anything in the flavor department.  It was very flavorful - excellent.  A definite keeper in our book.

This was really good but it needs something.  I might try it with chile peppers next time, or possibly less tomato.  Edit : With some diced chilis, shredded Monterey Jack cheese and some corn it was a five star!

YUMMY...this was so delicious !! I did not have saffron...but I used the small package of " saffron yellow rice with seasonings" and at the end I added about 1/2cup of cooked white rice,(just to make sure there was enough rice for this dish) and this was so delicious. I did pre-cook my chicken first on top of the stove with a little water in the frying pan. This definitely is a keeper in our house. The left overs tasted just as good..Thanks for this recipe !!

I made this for the second time and we love it.I like that it is a one skillet meal. I added a little cumin and I put the chicken back in when i added the liquids so it would absorb more flavor.I used diced seasoned tomatoes and saffron rice which is a less expensive way to go if you don't already have the saffron seasoning. I found saffron rice 2 for 1.00 and its easy and tastes so good.I also used fresh, chopped cilantro on top instead of parsley because i love cilantro and it's sooo good. Thank you for submiting a delicious, easy recipe!

Great recipe. Almost like a good old Newfoundland pot of chicken soup that's been used for years. We use boned chicken legs(after boiling)instead of chicken breasts.

This was very good, even my two year old ate it!   i like that it is low-fat yet rich in flavor.   My husband and I added some hot sauce at the table. I did make a couple of changes.  Didnt have saffron so I omitted it.  I also didnt have green peppers.  I threw in a couple of table spoons of salsa so that I got a few pepper pieces in.

It was OK.  My husband thought I should cut back on the stewed tomatoes next time.  Also, I will probably cut back on the wine too.  Will try to make it again in a couple weeks with those modifications.

I did not use saffron because it wasn't available at my supermarket.  This was excellent.  I know it will become a regular meal at my house.  It was relatively quick and very easy.

Incredible!  I made a couple substitutions based on what I had on hand (tumeric for the saffron and wine vinegar+sugar for the wine) and it still came out amazing.  My boyfriend insisted I save this recipe... and make it often.

OK,  I've made this for dinner about 30 times... It's time to review it. Definate 5 Star! I gave my Grandma frozen single servings of this for Christmas a couple years ago, and she want's it again and again.  It's good, it's easy, I drink the wine while I'm making it...  Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent!  Even better the next day.  I added cumin, a diced habanero, a dash of cayenne.  Also I used brown rice & it worked fine.  At the end I added half a can of petite peas.

This was very nice, but being from Miami, it is not like the Cuban style Arroz con Pollo I am used to.  The flavors were milder and I will try in next time without tomatoes.  I added just a hint of red pepper to spice it up and to enhance the other flavors in the rice.

A tasty easy midweek meal.  I added a packet of Goya sazon and a chopped onion to the chicken.  I also substituded an 8oz can of whole green chillies (chopped) for the green pepper, which gave it a little kick and I used fresh cilatro instead of parsley.  Next time I make this I will add more garlic.

This recipe was delicious. I doubled the recipe to feed my large family, so I had to make it in a large pot. There ended up being too much liquid, but I skimmed some of it off and it was fine. I also substituted brown rice for the white rice to make it healthier, and used a combination of white meat and dark meat chicken.

This was delicious and so easy!!  I only made a few revisions:
I added about 1/8th tsp of cumin and turmric.  I also had to add quite a bit more salt than the 1/2 tsp the recipe called for.  Alerted by other's reviews that the recipe was bland I made sure to taste it all the way through and found myself adding more salt almost ever time.  I would estimate I added about 1 1/2 tsp total.  Which is not a lot for 4 people but next time I'll try to figure out how to add less salt.  I'm thinking of using scallions next time to add more flavor.

This was delicious.  I made with brown rice instead of white rice.  I left out the wine and saffron and parsley since I didn't have that on hand. Also I used red, orange and yellow bell pepper. It was delicious and tasted very fresh. I brought the leftovers the next day to work and everyone commented on how wonderful it looked and smelled!  It was wonderful!  My whole family enjoyed it!  Thanks for the recipe! Will definately make again and I don't think I will change what I did, why ruin a good thing.  If it is not broke don't fix it right?

No, it's not traditional arroz con pollo, but it's still pretty delicious. I followed the advice of other reviewers and left the chicken in the pot the entire time, which I think was a wise decision (and less hassle that taking it out and putting it back in later). Super easy and super satisfying, plus I'm certain you could add more veggies and it would be just as good.

Could use a little more flavor. It was a little on the bland side.  There were good flavors surfacing through, but it could have used a little more punch.  We added red pepper flake to the servings on our plates, and that helped.  I probably wouldn't make it again.

So, so, so yummy. I have a friend who loves it when I make this so much, that he calls sometimes just to ask if I'll make him some to take to his house. He's even offered to pay. LOL. My family loves it as well. Thank you for such a great recipe!

I've made this two times and then I found the "Easy Paella" recipe on this site and made that. I found that I liked different things about both recipes, so I combined them. I think the Paella recipe had better seasonings and used sausage. While the Arroz con Pollo recipe uses tomatoes for an authentic flavor. I basically made this recipe, but seasoned it according to the Paella recipe and used smoked Hillshire farm sausage in addition to chicken. I also found it needed more liquid to cook correctly (for 1 cup of rice) so I added 1 cup of v-8 juice in addition to broth and wine - and I omitted the tomatoes. combining the two recipes gives the best of what both have to offer! Hope this helps!

AMAZING! Have made it quite a few times now changing it to what I have in the house (always adding more cumin than asked for, my fave spice!). This recipe is a winner every time. Best part is my hubby said its better than his mothers, who is from Panama!! I am sure he wont let her in on that, lol

I loved this recipe! It was super quick and easy to put together. It also makes excellent leftovers. It showed it on it's on to server, but I had tortillas on hand so I went ahead and served it with that. My Husband does construction so having a little more carb for him is ideal:) Hope u enjoy it as much as we did.

I thought this was just ok--I did eat it the first night I made it--but had some the next day and thought it was much better--one day makes a huge difference in taste.  I did use brown rice (healthier) and had to double the chicken broth in order for the brown rice to cook properly.  I did not add the peppers as I don't like them and added some cumin--a nice change.  thank you!

This was good, but nothing to brag about in my book. For the taste, I would have preferred it not take as long to prep or cook. Family ate it, but I've got other dishes like this that are just more flavorful.

This recipe was easy and came out great.  I added chopped chorizo sausage when I sauteed the green pepper, onion, & garlic.  Then I put the chicken back in with all the additional ingredients.  I also added a can of chopped green chilis.  Substituted tumeric for saffron as others did, and didn't notice the difference.  Also, topped the dish with a squeeze of lime and some sliced avocado.  My husband really enjoyed this, and even my kids liked it!  I will definitely be making this again.

We loved this dish! Following the advice of previous reviewers, I left the chicken in the pan and continued adding the ingredients. I also added peas (because I had some on hand) and accidentally left out the wine, which seemed to make no difference. MOST IMPORTANT: I brined the chicken ahead of time, which gave it a wonderful tender texture. After cutting it into chunks, I put the chicken in a quart of water with 1/4 salt, 1/4 sugar, and a tbs of cumin for 45 minutes. Yum!!

I made this like someone else with saffron rice and not saffron and it was not good.  Only one person out of 5 in my house would eat it.   My husband has had real saffron and thinks it would of been better with that.  I do not think I will even try it again with real saffron, I  have  tried better recipes from here.

This recipe  was a big hit at our house! I cooked everything altogether and it turned out fabulous and very tasty! I know for sure it is good when my husband, who is the cook in the house says it is.  Thanks for sharing.

This was really tasty, especially with a mustard curry sauce we made. I was hoping for another style of chicken & rice (a bit more Cuban) but this Mexican style dish was fantastic as well. Would be great with fajitas or a big Mexican feast.

I made this dish for dinner last night and we enjoyed it especially my husband. I didn't have white wine or saffron and so I didn't add it, but it was still very good. Thank you for this recipe. This will be added to our dinner list now.

My family all enjoyed this and asked for seconds. I was happy to find saffron in my grandmothers cabinet, I wasn't looking forward to finding it or spending alot on it. I added diced tomatoes that had garlic and olive oil, and that added to the flavor. I removed the chicken for 2-3 minutes just to add the liquid ingredients and the rice. I then placed the chicken atop the rice, in order to cook through, but also so the chicken could continue picking up all the flavors. I know I will be making this again. Maybe in a week or so.

A+++++++ This is one of my all time favorite recipes that I've discovered on allrecipes.com  I've made this dish countless times and always feel proud to bring it as a dish for various events. Sometimes I mix it up a little because I'm out of certain ingredients, but I try to keep it exact as it don't get any better than that!

The flavor in this dish was fantastic...of course, I burned my rice on the bottom, but, amazingly, it didn't ruin the taste of the rest of it.  Even my somewhat picky oldest daughter liked it and asked for seconds.

I prepared this recipe as written with the exception of using cooking sherry for the white wine; consequently I decreased the salt to half of what is called for in the recipe. This was really good!  It was easy to prepare, simple ingredients and tasty.  I think a key is to avoid overcooking the chicken when you are initially cooking it. I will definitely make this again.

Made this as a "one skillet method" just adding ingredients as they cooked.  Finished the dish with juice of a lime squirted on top. Excellent!  We all loved it.

This was so popular at my house, we had it 2 nights in a row! I made it as a one pot dish and while it is quite tasty, I agree with others that it is lacking "something".  But it's very easy and a crowd pleaser, so I'll keep testing it on the family.

We loved it...however, it's very similar to my jambalaya...and I add a ton of other things to it...so I guess I prefer that. But this is good if you just want a basic chicken and rice dinner. The flavor was great.

I liked this but it needed a little extra something, it was tasty and I am glad I made it, a good one dish supper. But I am not sure if I would make it again without making some slight changes first. I think adding cheese at the end would be a good thing, I might try that next time. Thanks for a good one dish dinner!

Pretty tasty for first run. I used 1 1/2 lb chicken. Doubled the garlic and paprika. Skipped the wine. I used a white queso cheese on top which made all the difference. I cooked with the tomatoes but took them out as I don’t care much for them. I will definitely make this again. Cast iron of corse.

I liked this recipe. I didn't have saffron but it still came out pretty tasty. I added a bit of mixed vegetables for a full meal. Next time I'm going to add just a tad bit of tomato sauce "para color," as my mother says.

I omitted the tomatoes as suggested by other reviewers. The flavor would have been nice, but I didn't want the rice to be mushy. I may try it again, but using the tomatoes in place of some of the broth.

The only things I did differently was double the recipe, so I had to use a pot instead of pan, and added the chicken back to the pot before the rice started boiling--so tender. This was amazing!

Good basic recipe. However, to make it more authentic and like my Cuban mother made it. I substituted the stewed tomatoes for tomato sauce and substituted the green pepper for a whole pimento pepper. Added ground cumin and oregano. Instead of white wine I added a bottle of beer and decreased the broth to 6 oz.  Now that is a Cuban Arroz Con Pollo!

I grew up on Gramma's Arroz con Pollo (y Chorizo) and this recipe is by far the best I've used. I double the rice and spices because my kids cannot get enough of it. I also add Chorizo to the pot since I love that, too. I've made this dozens of times. I usually leave out the green peppers and sub in green peas (for color and veggies).  Excellent (and fast).

Carol's Arroz con Pollo Haiku: "Warmed saffron in broth, but did the rest as written. We loved this, Carol!" Delicious meal that reminded me of paella, but not as labor, or ingredient, intensive. I don't really have any arroz con pollo experience to compare this to, so whether it's authentic or not, I can't agree or disagree w/ many of the reviews, but I thought it was terrific. But other than it needing a bit of salt (and my warming the saffron in the chicken broth separately), I was faithful to the recipe and loved every bite.

I added spicy smoked sausage and 1/2 more cup of rice and doubled the chicken broth. Also added three small heirloom tomatoes (diced). Tasted fantastic and my husband loved it so much, I'm making it again tonight!

It's a good base for a recipe but, sorry it's really bland.  I used boneless/skinless thighs but would use bone-in thighs next time.  Used cilanrto instead of parsley.  Had to add a lot of salt and pepper, and used stewed tomatoes with green chiles instead of the standard and it was still a bit bland.  My whole family put hot sauce on it for some kick.  

That said, the base recipe is excellent.  Just needs a bit of extra flavor elements, which is great because you can improvise.

Didn't have wine, paprika and saffron so we didn't use it in the recipe and it still turned out fantastic!

This was fairly easy to make and came out really tasty. I even got hubby to eat some and he is not a big fan of rice.

Absolutely Delicious Quick & Easy! I didn't have all of the inexpedience so i substituted tomato sauce for the stewed tomatoes, garlic powder for minced garlic, 2c frozen chopped peppers&onions and left out the saffron and parsley.  I also added a bit of cayenne pepper to the chicken to give it a little kick. This came out fabulous! However the only complaint I have is that I had a hard time getting the rice completely cooked. It was close, but ended up being too undercooked and had to chew on a few rice pieces here and there. I used regular rice because the recipe didn't say instant..but maybe now I'm thinking it was supposed to be instant or maybe my heat was too low. Either way, it was still very enjoyable and I will make this again! Next time I may cook the rice a little before adding it to the pan.

This will become a staple for me. The basics of the recipe are just great. As another reviewer suggested, it doesn't have a typical Arroz con Pollo flavor, so in place of the paprika and saffron I substituted cumin (1 teaspoon) and oregano (1/2-1 tablespoon, I didn't really measure). I also added a small package of frozen peas to the recipe between browning the rice and adding the broth and left out the tomatoes because of preference.

A nice, filling, one pot supper. Nothing spectacular. I used turkey instead of chicken, turmeric instead of saffron, and yellow pepper instead of green. I also added a teaspoon of cilantro. Use just 1 T. of olive oil instead of 3 T. of vegetable, and keep the chicken in the pot as you add the other ingredients. Beware - this burns quickly so keep a close eye on it.

Exactly what I was looking for to use up my leftover chicken!  I only used half a green pepper, substituted Spanish Paprika, added 1/2 cup of frozen corn and added 1/8 tsp of cayenne for a little tingle on the lips :)

I thought this was really good!  I was a little hesitant based on some of the reviews, but overall I thought it had great flavor.  I did use a yellow pepper instead of green, tumeric instead of saffron, and extra salt and pepper.

This is a great one pan meal. I add cumin, diced green chili, and lime juice to mine. I also use cilantro in place of parsley, just because we love it. Really good with sliced avocado!!

Made this last night and it turned out great! Definitely add the extras seasonings other reviewers talk about (cumin especially). And I used half of a green, red, and yellow pepper for more color. I also took the chicken out and put it back in when I put all the liquids in. Turned out perfect! And no one mentioned the other plus to this recipe - EASY CLEAN UP! Will definitely make again!

This was a little time consuming since it was my first time making it but it was well worth the wait!!  My husband and I loved it.  It was even better as leftovers the next day.  Can't wait to make it again!

We liked this - good flavor and nice for a simple, weeknight meal. We had it with a salad with Zesty Salad Dressing from this site.

I basically combined this recipe with Chicken with Rice (Arroz con Pollo)( from this site also).  Used boneless chicken breasts, but all of the seasonings of the other recipe.  Cooked on stovetop, got rave review from everyone!

Delicious home cooked meal-good & healthy for the family (not a company meal). I followed some of the advice - cut to 1 TB olive oil. Kept chicken in pan while adding the rest of the ingredients as instructed. I also simmered the broth with saffron. It ended up being very flavorful, and we are usually of the "not enough flavor ilk". If you don't use stewed tomatoes there may not be enough flavor.

Very good. I followed this recipe exactly and it was great. I definitely will make it again. After taking a few bites, I did add some more fresh ground pepper, but maybe that's just me. Next time I will probably add more parsley too, but I love parsley.

This was a great meal.  My fiancee likes his food very spicy, so I added 2 hot peppers.  I also couldn't find saffron, so I substituted turmeric for the saffron.  I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is now going to be a staple in my house.  Everything in it I already have on hand so it's perfect for nights that I don't have a lot of time.  I've made this recipe as is and with some variations and it's great both ways.  I've added 1/4 teaspoon cumin, 1 can sliced black olives and double the garlic.  YUM!  Thank you Carol!

This is a latin dish and each latin country makes it in a different way. I did have before the Colombian version of this recipe and it was really good, it does not have any tomatoes so tha's why I omitted it. I cooked the rice by itself, sauted the onion/garlic/vegetables (carrots and red bell pepper) in a different pan and used leftover of a roasted chicken, this way the vegetables were nice and crispy. Thanks!

Made this on Cinco de Mayo for my husband and sister. It was quite good, and they absolutely loved it.  I had planned on leftovers for the next night's dinner, but we only had enough for one lunch!  I added cumin as others suggested.

I could tell by reading this that it was going to be too bland for our taste, but a VERY GOOD jumping off point! For people who like more plain food, you will like this as written. I added 1/2ts each onion powder, cumin and chili powder and 1/4ts cayenne. Also, chopped up a stalk of celery, a whole vidalia onion, mushrooms. Threw it all in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours total. Halfway in I added a drained can of black beans and 1c frozen corn. Mixed 1tb Masa into 3/4c heavy cream and stirred it in. Served with sour cream, chopped avocado, tomato, squeezed lime juice over, salt and pepper... FABULOUS!!!

Very good... works well if you substitute one pound of ground chicken or turkey (browned w/ paprika and spices like recipe, then added onions and peppers, et all and sauteed all together, added wine and broth then continued with recipe as written).

Nothing bad, but nothing special. Couldn't single out the taste of the white wine so in my mind it's a waste of white wine.

My wife and I both enjoyed this. The kids were not crazy about it.  I used spanish paprika rather than plain paprika for a smokey taste. I added 1/4 tsp of both cumin and chipotle powder for a little heat. Could have increased just a bit.  After adding rice and liquids, I added chicken back into pot for the simmering time. Next time, I'll add chorizo as well.

I added cumin in place of the saffron, cilantro for the parsley, and water for the wine, then added mushrooms. I added the veggies a little later in the process so they were a bit firmer the second time and it really did the recipe justice. Everyone loves it and it's a regular in the rotation now.

Excellent, easy recipe for the arroz con pollo novice. I made this recipe for my husband's office and most of his co-workers are from Cuba. They came back for seconds.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I don't think the white wine really adds much, I would just use more chicken broth the next time.  I was trying to recreate my grandmother's Cuban recipe here - I would use more garlic (maybe twice as much) and some cumin.

I feel the rice to chicken proportion was off - there should have been more rice.  Other than that - this is a great recipe.  And remember to stir often so you dont burn the bottom.  I would even suggest letting it boil - and when the water starts to get low - turn off the stove and let it sit a few minutes.

Really easy and tasty and healthy too! I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and added diced green chilies and some chili powder. Would like to add frozen peas next time too. I didn't have any saffron either, so I would like to see what that adds to the flavor. Will definitely make this again!

This did not work out for my family unfortunately.  I was the only one who liked it and even then had a hard time wanting to eat it all.  I made according to directions for the most part except for using the saffron rice pack I bought at the store. It just didn't taste very good to us.

It's good, but it needs a little something more. Maybe more saffron? I think I would put double of saffron, and more wine. Definitively.

I used the suggestions of others - no saffron, added 1/2 chili powder & diced green chili's. Also left the chicken whole and added them back in the pan while rice was cooking & added con queso cheese.   It turned out pretty good.   The rice was not as dry as I would have liked and lacked a mexican flavor I had hoped.  The base was ok and could use more tweaking.   Maybe I will have to try the real thing.

Great recipe!  I would have rated 4 1/2 stars because (like other reviewers have mentioned) it does lack just a little something.  Next time, I'll also try using 1/2 chicken, 1/2 Italian sausage.

I've been aware of this recipe since I was five when I was old enough to somewhat understand and begin to fall in love with the "I Love Lucy" show. However, all these years later, this was my first attempt at making this dish. Although I added just a few more seasonings, it was wonderful. My family truly enjoyed it and I thank you Carol for submitting it. (Thank you too Lucy!)

Like many others, I used saffron rice instead of using plain rice with saffron.  Saved $$$ and it tasted really good.  I also added a jar of salsa to the liquid so the amount of liquid was correct, but with salsa flavors.  We did brown the chicken pieces first, and then I put them back in the pan to steam with the rice.  The net of it was super moist chicken morsels mixed infused with the safron rice.  It was soooooooo good. My kids, ages 9 & 14, loved the dish too.

Great recipe.  Thanks for submitting it.

Amazing!! I've messed arroz con pollo up before so I was a little hesitant to make this recipe. It turned out great. I didn't use the saffron and I added a jar of monterary jack queso cheese to the dish and it tasted just like the real thing at the Mexican restaurant that we love to eat at. Thanks

this recipe was alright.  It lacked something.  I made it per the recipe, but it didn't taste right.  So I added some lemon pepper, cumin, and garlic powder along with some red chile flakes, and it tasted a little better.  Will not make this again.

This was very good but the chicken was too dry for me.  Next time I'll use thigh meat. I added a can of tomatoes with chillies (Rotel-like) instead of stewed tomatoes.

Made this vegetarian by using Quorn tenders in place of chicken and vegetable broth.  Cooked everything in one skillet per review.  Also used one can of green chilis in place of bell peppers b/c we didn't have any on hand.  It was hot and spicy (to me) just cooked.  Husband loved it.  I loved it cold the next day eaten w/ chips.  Will make again.  Thanks!

This was pretty good.  It probably would've been better if I had been able to get the wine bottle open (ended up substituting it with water).  I also used zucchini instead of green pepper, and added a little bit of chili and cayenne for a kick.

what a delicious yet easy dish to make! i've just made this for my second time and these are the changes i made: using a handful of sliced frozen peppers (i had no fresh ones), half the amount of white wine, and a can of diced tomatoes instead of stewed.

I left out the saffron and tomatoes and used a goya seasoning packet on the chicken - this was delicious- even my picky husband gives it 5 stars!! Maybe next time I'll try adding pigeon peas.

Rice was great!!! Chicken was a bit bland though.

I thought this recipe was EXCELLENT! It reminded me of a Paella that I had in Spain, minus the larger meat pieces (e.g. thighs, drumsticks, etc) and shrimp (worth mentioning for those interested some ideas) that the particular type that I tried had in it. I will DEFINITELY be making this again.

This was recipe was very accurate and equally delicious!  I also found it pleasantly surprisingly easy.  I doubled the saffron to 1/4 tsp., and added 1/4 tsp. cumin as well...just personal preference.  My parents, husband and brother all had seconds and were absolutely impressed, as was I!

Great recipe!!  I followed the recipe to the letter except I added a small habanero pepper and I used brown rice instead of white because it was what I had on hand.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks Carol.

I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except used 2 chicken bouillon cubes and about 2 cups of water instead of broth, and added a can of peas, liquid and all, at the end.  Delicious!

I omityted the saffron (don't have it).  My husband and I really liked this - the kids weren't so fond of it.

I thought this was a lovely Spanish dish - I loved the mellow flavors and enjoyed it very much as compared to the more Mexican versions I am used to. This will take up residence in my recipe box.

I added 3/4 cup black beans and 3/4 cup frozen corn in addition to someone's suggestion of oregano.  We liked this, but I think it would have been boring without the beans and corn.  Tasty!

Did not care for this recipe.  Something about it did not taste right.
