Awesome! I doubled the chimichurri recipe as I wanted to serve extra on the side with grilled steaks.  Absolutely delicious!  Served with a simple spinach salad  and everyone enjoyed a fabulous meal.  Very easy to make and so tasty!  I did add more garlic and a dash of red pepper flakes as my group loves deep rich flavors.  Try this as written, you won't be disappointed!
