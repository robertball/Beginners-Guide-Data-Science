I was surprised to like this way of eating an oranges as much as I did. The flavors didn't seem like they should work but they do.  I think I would slice the orange, peel it and remove any excess pith.  It would make eating less mesy.

I liked this recipe, the combination seemed odd to me but I ended up liking it. I didnt measure how much olive oil I used, I just drizzled some onto the oranges. Next time, I'm going to remove the entire peel from the oranges, having them on made them messier to eat.
