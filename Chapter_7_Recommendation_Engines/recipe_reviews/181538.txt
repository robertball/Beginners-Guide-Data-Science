Here's a tip for those who had trouble with the wild rice cooking.  If you use "cracked" wild rice instead of whole wild rice, it will cook in about the same time as the brown rice.  Enjoy!

This had good flavor but be warned mine was not even close to being done in 1 hour and 15 min.  Took at least 30 min more and had to add some beef broth as the liquid was absorbed before the rice was fully cooked.  Nothing like messing with your main entree when your side needs another 30 min. to finish cooking.  This caused me much grief.

Great ingredients! Wild Rice is always tricky when it comes to cooking times. You don't want it to be crunchy or like mush so it is best when it just "pops".  There is nothing like this great grain.

This is a delicious dish. I added walnuts instead of almonds and it worked out great.

This was a big hit! Changed it up by using chicken broth to cook it in the rice cooker & added red & orange peppers, too.

This is very good if you love wild rice.  As stated by Patti, it took mine about 1 1/2 hours to cook and I had to add more liquid to prevent it from becoming to dry.

Loved this recipe!  I used chicken broth instead of beef consomme and had to cook it at least 30 more minutes, adding more chicken broth but it was incredibly good!  Fixed it for Thanksgiving and there was very little left over...

I have now made this recipe 4 or 5 times. Every time it has been a huge hit!!! I recently visited friends in Florida and made it for a large group. There was not a bite left over! I did add a little extra broth because I like my rice a bit softer. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks so much for sharing!

Just ok.  The wild rice definitely takes a while to cook.  Longer than the recipe indicates.  I didn't feel it was worth it.

This was very good. I used shallots instead of green onions, and I cooked it in a skillet on the stove top and then transfered it into a baking dish after all ingredients were combined. I also baked it for an hour and a half, based on the other review. It turned out great. I made it with the balsamic pork loin recipe also on allrecipes and they went very well together.

Made this for Christmas Eve to go with salmon.  Everyone loved it.  I thought there was a bit too much butter, though.  Tonight I am going to try it with chicken broth rather than the consomme (as someone suggested) to go with roast chicken.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

I already made this twice this week because my family is in love with it and it works for everyone's taste buds.  I used shiitake mushrooms.

I suck at cooking and I made this for my girlfriend and I and it turned out AMAZING. It tasted soo good, it tasted like a home cooked meal my mom would make, and it was actually so easy it just takes a long time to cook but ya I would recommend making this. Thanks you to the OP

Delicious recipe. I used chicken broth instead of the beef consume and I added a cup more of the broth. The rice was cooked perfectly.

The wild rice didn't cook all the way, even though I cooked it for at least 30 minutes beyond the recommended time. Any longer, and the brown rice would've been mushy. I had to add a bit more liquid (water and beef bullion), and the flavors came out ok. Were I to do this again, I would par-cook the wild rice.

So tasty! We really enjoyed this dish. The rice was still a little crunchy, so may need to cook it longer next time. It does make a lot.

I have a lot of family in Minnesota. Whenever we visit I bring pounds of rice back. I wanted something different using this wonderful food. This recipe has already been shared with family in Minnesota and will be my go to wild rice recipe from now on. I didn't change anything. My family of four polished the whole pan off during dinner! Definitely the best wild rice I've had!

This is the best rice dish I have ever had! I have made it several times and it has been a hit on several occasions, and rarely any leftovers.  I use broth (chicken or beef) in place  of the consume and it takes about 90 minutes to cook, but it is definitely worth the wait!

I needed a dish to take to the Wild Game dinner at the sportsman club and I didn't have any wild game to use so I thought this would a nice compliment and it was!  I was happy with the way it turned out and will make it again. There was just enough left over for a supper.  It makes lots so will probably cut in half to make it for us to eat at home.  I used beef broth instead of consomme and cooked it for 6 hrs on low in the crock pot  as I needed to keep it hot & for easy transport . Thanks for sharing

This was pretty tasty.  My son didn't like it as it wasn't Uncle Ben's wild rice package.  It makes a huge amount so be prepared.  I had some black wild rice from Trader Joe's so used 1/2 C, 1/2 C of some Minnesota wild rice, and 3/4 C brown rice.  I cooked it on the stove stop for 1 hour and 30 minutes.  I did add an extra 1/2 C water toward the end of cooking so it wouldn't be dried out.  Now wondering what to do with all the left-over pilaf as there is a lot.

I used only the 1 C brown rice and followed the rest of the directions but cooked everything on the stove top in a covered saucepan on low heat for 45 minutes. It came out perfect, and tasted great.

I used quick cooking wild rice and short grain brown rice and it was not done in 75 minutes.  I let it go about 20 minutes more and the grains were still crunchy but I prefer that over mushy.  I am not a fan of wild rice but somehow I ended up with some so I thought I'd give this a try.  It was edible but I don't think I will make it again.
