The term bread is a little misleading.  It is very sweet.  Almost like a fruitcake.  The amounts are a little overkill.  I halved this recipie and still ended up with two full loaves.  Watch the cooking time.  These cook quicker than the alloted time.  Use the toothpick method.  With the bread almost being dessert like, I will try it next time with a little sugar on top. Thanks

I only gave this recipe 4 stars because I think the amounts must be off somehow. While the bread did turn out delicious, I had SO much batter, there was NO WAY it was going to fit in only 2 loaf pans, let alone the smaller, 8" kind. When I was mixing it up I wondered if someone was playing a trick on us with these amounts and directions.I wound up using 2 very large loaf pans and put the rest in a 9x13 pan. The name is a little bit misleading too because this is really a rich, sweet, quick bread rather than buns. The bread IS good, especially with butter but next time I bake it, I'll cut the ingredient amounts in half and I bet I'll still wind up with two loaves.

Did not have "dark brown" sugar, so I added molasses to the light brown sugar I had. I also used extra vanilla (cuz I love vanilla) and ommitted the raisens or mixed fruit (yuck). I have to say, mine came out VERY sweet. I will make again but adjust accordingly. Oye.... no molasses, will stay with 1 tsp vanilla and maybe cut back a little with the sugar...

Time for baking is definitely not 90 minutes if you make for two loaves.  At 40 mins the sides were getting dark brown but the center not done. I am thinking I might have to lower the oven temp to 325 because my loaf pans are "dark".  I will also add the fruit to the mixture AFTER I add the liquid ingredients next time because after baking my fruit still had dry flour attached to it.  After reading these reviews, I was expecting the bread to be alot sweeter.  I guess maybe that is the difference between light brown and dark brown sugar.  I only had light brown and used that.  I am going to try this recipe again tonight but first I will be stopping at the store for dark brown sugar!

Beer smell was too strong while bread was warm. Later when it cooled down it was much better. I made half of the size and it took as few days to eat it. It is very good with milk and some butter.

This tastes great! 
I halved the recipe and used a large round pan. The batter looks a bit runny, but it bakes excellent. Be careful though, 40 minutes in the oven are enough. I used dried figs instead of candied fruit, but I'm sure all raisins would be okay too. Try it!
