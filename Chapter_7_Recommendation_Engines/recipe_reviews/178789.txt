I followed the recipe exactly. This was very good and easy to make. I ate some warm and some cooled, it tastes best when cooled.

This is an ideal recipe for company, just be sure they like pumpkin.  This is an easy, very attractive dessert that you can make in very little time.

I decided to make this recipe to bring in fall!  My husband doesn't really care for pumpkin and he thought they were great.

I made this for my brother-in-law who is allergic to nuts and his vegan wife, so I left out the pecans and eggs.  I skipped the icing (to make it vegan) and dusted it with powdered sugar.  The recipe still turned out very well!  Perfect vegan recipe for the fall!

I liked this. It didn't so much remind me of a pastry, as I just consider them lighter and more crispy. However, it was like a handheld pumpkin pie in flavor and texture. Make sure to have a measuring tape on hand as I needed it to measure the square, to mark where the filling goes and to do the same thing with cutting the strips. I found a sharp knife worked best for that over scissors also. Make sure to close the perforations well or they will tear open when crossing the strips. The whipped egg white on top and the icing were nice decorative touches. I put the icing on after it cooled on a rack for 5 minutes. It was the perfect consistency with the portions suggested for milk and powdered sugar. If truth be told, the pecans on top are not needed. The icing hardens to quickly for them to stick and they cover the pretty icing and dough design.

I used ready rolled puff pastry as it was more like the pecan Danish recipe I have been looking for, the rest of the recipe was made exactly as stated. They were perfect and didn't last until the next day as they were so good. I made 6 quite large Danish pastries, I could've made 12 smaller if you are able to resist them but we would've just ended up eating 2 in one go as they were delicious!

This turned out beautifully, and I received compliments on the dish.  I made the recipe exactly as directed, and I found that it would be helpful to lightly dust the pan with a little flour before placing the dough in the pan.  This would keep the dough strips from sticking to the pan after cutting, and then tearing when lifted to twist.  Even though pumpkin is not one of my personal favorites, this was tasty and a nice presentation.  This would also work with some apple pie filling, I think, by leaving out the egg, sugar and spices.  One can of pumpkin would easily be enough for two braids.

I will definitely make this again!  Very quick and easy and a delicious quick breakfast to throw together on the weekend.  You could do this for a crowd in no time flat.  I used the seamless crescent dough, substituted pumpkin pie spice for the spices (1-1/2 tsp), didn't mix the nuts into the pumpkin, just sprinkled a few walnuts (chopped & toasted) on top and instead of milk, used maple syrup in the glaze.  There are only two of us in the house and this was gone in no time flat.

Easy, seasonal, and tasty. What more could you want? Oh and it was pretty. I made it for a potluck dessert, and when topped with fresh whipped cream it was great. It has also been a great breakfast this week as a pumpkin coffee cake :)

Not sure how I've never reviewed this before, but I make it every year for a bake sale at work and it's always the first thing to go! It's super easy to make and looks very impressive, like you spent way more time on it. And it's delicious!

This is the EASIEST recipe I've ever made. The first time I just folded the crust over onto itself & the next time I sort of braided it. Made two for Thanksgiving dessert, we'll see how everyone likes it. I know my husband & I both like it cold.

Really good.  I used the whole can of pumpkin and doubled all of the filling ingredients like brown sugar and spices.  I then used two cans of crescent rolls or two puff pastries and made two of them.  So quick and family ate them both in two sittings.

OMG this is absolutely delicious!  I made it as a dessert for our Christmas dinner and everyone loved it!  For those saying you must love pumpkin, that's kind of a given since it does have pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices in it!  No one found it overpowering or thought there was too much filling.  I made this the night before, let it sit on the counter until dinner the next day and it was perfect un-heated.  I used the crescent dinner rolls and they worked like a charm.  This one is definitely a keeper!  fyi - I made this one exactly as stated in the recipe.

This was okay but I would much rather use the pumpkin for pie.

This is tasty. I did feel the filling was a bit overpowering though. When I make this again I will cut the pumpkin to 1/2 cup so the filling is not so thick. I am going to make this again with an apple pie filling. Thanks for a great idea!

Not the greatest pumpkin dessert I've had but it was descent.  Really have to like pumpkin b/c the filling is certainly dominating- not overpowering but really there.  Easy.  We liked it much better after it cooled, and even the 2nd day after sitting out on the counter.

I followed this recipe as instructed, but the glaze needs some vanilla extract. The pecans need to be toasted before being sprinkled on top of the braid, and a pinch of salt would be helpful in the filling.

I tried this on a whim, and was very pleased with the outcome. I had almonds on hand, and used those instead of pecans. Minimal prep, and a wonderful return! You must love pumpkin. My 6 year old and I loved it. It does not reheat very well, so try to enjoy it the same day.
