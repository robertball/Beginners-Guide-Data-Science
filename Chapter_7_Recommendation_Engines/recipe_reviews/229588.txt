I used spiced rum instead of the Amber rum.I also ended up doubling the recipe to fill my deep dish pie pan. I covered the edge of the crust immediately and during the entire baking process, which took forever. I'm sorry I didn't keep track of the time to include it here, and I think the next time I try this recipe I will try 1 1/2 times the recipe instead of the 2 times. Everyone at my house loved it!!!
