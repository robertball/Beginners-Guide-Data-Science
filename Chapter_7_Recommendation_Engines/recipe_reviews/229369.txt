What a wonderful recipe. This is my first attempt at ever making eggplant parmesan. My husband picked two eggplants from the garden, so I thought this would be a good way to use them up. What drew me to this recipe is, the eggplant is baked and not fried. My husband and I don't care for fried foods. I followed the recipe pretty closly, but I went by another review and baked the eggplant for 7 mins on each side.1 8oz bag of shreeded mozzarella cheese was enough. The pan was pretty full, and i was afraid it wouldn't be cooked enough, so I put it in the oven for 50 mins. It was perfect. My husband loved it. I made a salad and served Italian bread with it. We have enough eggplant for leftovers tomorrow night. Thanks so much for such a great and easy recipe. This will be a keeper in my home.

I was extremely happy with this recipe!  I tried to make Eggplant Parmesan only once before.  I fried it and it was a soggy, oily disaster.  This recipe was amazingly simple and very, very good.  The eggplant stayed firm and crisp.  The only changes I made was to bake for 7 minutes each side before assembling (instead of 5) and I used homemade tomato sauce instead of a jarred variety.  Actually, I forgot to peel it too, but it made no difference and didn't detract at all.

I want to start off saying this recipe is very forgiving! It was absolutely wonderful and I was pressed for time, so I didn't skin the eggplant, nor did I sweat it for (3) hours. I only sweated for (1) hour.  I did follow other suggestions and baked the eggplant at 375 degrees for 15 minutes per side. I wanted them really firm so they wouldn't get soggy sitting in the marinara while baking. And they didn't burn. They were nice and crunchy, and I can't cut slices precisely so some were thicker than others and none of them burnt! I don't know about others, but I needed more marinara sauce than (1) can.  But I like mine saucy to slather on my noodles. I served over angel hair and I'll say it again! I loved it! And this is my first time ever making or trying eggplant Parmesan. But other than the prep instructions I followed this recipe to the T. This is going to in my cook book! To note, I used Sea Salt to sweat them, and I don't like salt and didn't think this tasted salty at all.  It might have been because I used Sea Salt which isn't so "salty" tasting.

I liked this recipe very much. The eggplant wasn't soggy!  I halved the recipe, so I only had one layer, but it was perfect. We are not huge red sauce fans, so we went light on it and two of my kids ate it. And I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I previously thought I didn't like eggplant and this recipe totally changed my mind.  After getting one in our CSA my husband decided to give it a second chance and we realized we had everything we needed for this recipe and gave it a shot.  It's delicious!  We only salted ours for about 20 minutes and it wasn't bitter at all.  I didn't have Italian bread crumbs, so I used regular crumbs seasoned with garlic and onion powder, oregano, and parsley.  We had fresh mozzarella so we sliced that as one of the layers and used the parmesan on top.  We also used fresh basil because we got that in our CSA also.  Completely delicious and I already bought another eggplant to recreate the dish sometime later this week.  Thanks for making me an eggplant convert!

Awesome recipe!! I made this for my mom's bday as this is her favorite dish...it was excellent..loved baking eggplant and didn't take away from flavour at all...in fact made it better...not greasy!! I made and cooked it the night before and wasn't sure how it would turn out..took out of fridge about 1 before reheating...reheated at 325 for about 45 minutes.  I got nothing but compliments for this dish!! Will definitely make again!! Baked eggplant for 10 minutes on each side..

This is the first time I cook eggplant at all. This recipe was simple and delicious. My picky preschooler liked it, also my toddler: that is a testimony enough. Because I was not sure how they'd react to an eggplant dish, which is not typically on our menu, and I only had one eggplant, I added some pasta to it. I boiled some whole wheat rotini (about half of a box) and layered sauce, pasta, cheese, then sauce, eggplant and cheese. I had some leftover from the bread crumbs and Parmesan mixture and I sprinkled that on top. It was delicious fresh, and the next day as leftovers too.

I made this for my dad's 88th birthday. I have my own recipe, but this one takes less effort. The secret is to use good sauce and bake it long enough. My Italian son said this was the best thing that happened to him all month.

A simple, easy recipe that  looks beautiful and tastes fantastic.  Thank you to the reviewer who explained that male eggplant isn’t bitter like the female eggplant. If the mark at the end of the eggplant is round, it’s female and has more seeds. If the mark is elongated it’s male with less seeds and a sweeter taste. This info saved me tons of time since I didn’t have to salt the eggplant and wait 30 minutes to draw out the bitterness.  I followed the recipe exactly as written with the exception of baking it 12 minutes on each side since I cut my slices on the thicker side.  I served it with garlic bread and a salad. It was a total hit!

Just awesome!  Liked baking the eggplant versus pan frying.  Original recipe says 5 minutes per side and it takes at least 8-10 minutes per.  Will definitely make again!

I've made this multiple times. I love the method of baking rather than frying the eggplant. It's quick, simple, much less messy than frying the eggplant first, and delicious.

Great recipe for baking eggplant verse frying. My final product was too salty but that's because I didn't take into account the saltiness of the cheeses, parmagiano reggiano and mozzarella. I've never made an eggplant without ricotta but will again as it was delicious and we didn't miss the extra calories! All I can say is beware the salt. You can always add but, unfortunately, never take away.
Also, I only had one nice size eggplant and made this in an 8x8 pan. Could feed 4 easily with a dish of pasta on the side.

I didn't sweat the eggplant or salt it but followed the rest of the directions.  This is a wonderful, meatless dinner!!  I used a jar of marinara sauce and it was wonderful.  Homemade spaghetti sauce will ge wonderful too.

I followed the recipe closely the first time I made this except I used both fresh mozzarella, provolone  and  parmesan  cheese In between the layers. 

It's an easy dish to make and yet very satisfying. I also made homemade sauce with cherry tomatoes cut in half, onions, carrot, garlic and canned San Mariano tomatoes very easy too goes great as the sauce.

This recipe is phenomenal!  I "sweated" the eggplant for 2 hours, then made the recipe as directed, baking the breaded eggplant 10 minutes per side before assembling the casserole.  My friend, who often orders this in restaurants, said it was the very best he has ever had, and it was an eye-opener for my husband and me as we LOVED it!  I had '"doctored" the Aldi jarred marinara sauce with onions, garlic and herbs a couple of days before in order for flavors to meld.  This was like lasagna without the heaviness.  I will make this again and often, especially when eggplants can be gotten through farmers' markets.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

I use this as the base for my recipe.  I love how the eggplant is baked and not fried,  it is still as delicious and crispy as if it were fried!  I like to add ricotta sometimes and I make my own sauce but I love the s recipe alone for the prep of the eggplant and the layering!

brown eggplant at least 8-9 min a side!  Two small eggplants made enough for a 3/4 full large white casserole.
Tom loved this!

Baking the eggplant meant it was crispy but did not suck up the oil as it had when I tried a different recipe which called for frying. It turned out actually better than some restaurant versions. Using a bought ragu sauce certainly makes it quick and easy to prepare. This will be a frequent dinner in this house! Thank you.

I made this tonight, and it came out fantastic!  I didn't change anything, I just used the best ingredients I could get my hands on, and this is the best recipe for this I've tried yet.  I think I'm done looking at others, this suited us fine.

This is an excellent recipe. Baking the eggplant versus frying was key to eliminating the greasiness that some recipes have. I didn’t leech the eggplant for 3 hours though, seemed excessive. I did 30 minutes and turned out fine. I used about double the sauce and cheese, as I guess I had exceptionally large eggplants. Used Italian seasoning instead of basil. Received raves and will definitely make again.

This was my first attempt at making Eggplant Parmesan and thought it was pretty good.  My problem was that I used what I thought were 2 "medium" sized eggplants but they must have been "small" because I didn't have enough to do 2 layers in a 9x13 dish, even though it made enough to fill a 18x13 baking sheet.  Anyway, I did 2 layers in an 8x8 dish but then there was way too much cheese and sauce.  Since there was just the 2 of us it was plenty though. So, basically, next time, I'll half the recipe and use a lot less cheese (maybe 4oz and only on top).  Oh, and regarding other reviewers suggestions I baked the eggplant slices 10 min per side which was perfect. And mine wasn't salty at all, after sweating the eggplant I squeezed the slices in paper towels to remove all the excess liquid.  Flavors were good so I'll give this another try.

This recipe is absolutley DELICIOUS!!  We have a couple of authentic Italian restraunts in the area and my husband and myself said it was even better than theirs!!!  The only changes I made were only letting the eggplant sit with the salt on it for one hour and I used a garlic and herb pasta sauce instead of garlic and tomato. I also added extra cheese

I have made this recipe several times. I always use fresh garlic and fresh basil in the sauce and I don't use as much mozzarella cheese as suggested. My daughter loves this dish and cries when it's all gone (she was 4! :) ). Making it doe the in laws tomorrow! I serve over fresh spinach as we try not to eat too much pasta.

Delicious! I love the crispness of the breaded, baked eggplant.  I made this per the recipe and it turned out great. I packed this for a week of lunches, as I prefer vegetarian breakfasts and lunches, which are hard to find on the go.  It actually made six nice sized portions for me. I may try this again adding more vegetables, eg. mushrooms, onions, green peppers.

I made this and my kids, parents and grandmother loved it! It tastes so good!!! Great for everyone- I can't believe my 9 yr old daughter loved it! She asked me to make it again... so I was very happy that everyone loved and it tastes delicious

I didn't read the recipe ahead of time so i didn't know the eggplants had to dry for 4 hours- I still cut them up, salted them and put them in a colander but instead of the 4 hour wait- i used the microwave defrost button about 8 minutes and also patted off the excess water with paper towels- the eggplants came out perfect!

This was my first time make Eggplant Parmesan and this turned out amazing.  I used my own homemade marinara (which has a lot of garlic and basil) so I did not add the extra.  However, I did add a garlic powder to the breading which added a little extra flavor.  I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who want to try and make Eggplant Parmesan

Nice, easy and quick to prepare.  Very tasty.  Served it over bow tie pasta.  35 minutes was a bit long - will try 28 next time.

This was the best eggplant parm I've ever made! I only let eggplant sweat 15 min. I baked slices in oven for 10 min on each side (instead of 5). And then I baked the whole thing about an hour but I covered it with foil once the cheese browned-- it needed it as after 35 minutes the eggplant really wasn't soft enough. It came out amazing and my husband and teenage boys who "don't like eggplant" ate it and said it was really good.

Used sliced fresh Mozzarella and Provolone cheeses between layers and topped with shaved Italian cheese blend so mine was very cheesy, like a cheese lasagna. Will definitely make again!

Overall it was good, but although I baked the eggplant slices for 10 minutes each side, they were still not done enough to my liking.  (Maybe I needed to slice it thinner.)  Also, I used my favorite pasta sauce and it turned out a bit too thick and a bit salty - next time I would thin the pasta sauce with some water.

Nice change from fried - less mess, less calories! Needed 3 eggs, beat with ~1/4 c water, and 3 c. unseasoned crumbs to which I added fresh chopped herbs. Took about 35 min on each side for the slices to be done, making it a great dish to work on while getting other tasks done. A keeper!

Only 2 of us, so I halved the recipe. Using an average size eggplant, had enough left over to freeze for 2 future dinners. Still used full jar of sauce because half jar did not seem enough. Will make again.

This was pretty tasty. If i were to do it again, i would bake the eggplant much longer (maybe 30 minutes? I did 15). Also i added sliced kalamata olives and marinated artichoke hearts on the layers. Strangely, i am inspired to fry the eggplant, so tasty.

I didn't peel the eggplant because I read a review that said they didn't and it turned out great so easy is good. I used almond flour instead of breadcrumbs to make the dish low carb and I added Italian sausage. it was delicious. myself and my girls loved it.  thank you for the recipe

This is an excellent recipe!  I baked the eggplant 10 minutes per side as well.  And just added extra cheese because my family loves it!  It was better then any eggplant I've ordered out at restaurants!

To bread the eggplant, I used gluten free bread crumbs and added just a little corn meal to the mixture.  I baked the eggplant for about 7 minutes per side and it was delicious - when putting it in the casserole dish, I didn't even use all of the spaghetti sauce since I didn't want it to be soggy.

This was really good. I haven't done a baked eggplant parm before, but this was actually crunchier than my usual fried version. 

Modifications:
-I baked the breaded slices for 10 minutes on each side at 350 and noticed the bread crumbs weren't browning. So, I adjusted the oven temp to 400 and gave them about 4 minutes on each side (watch so it doesn't get burned!!) and that was perfect. I got my crispy, browned, but cooked eggplant.
-I only had mozzarella on hand, and that was just fine taste-wise, though I added a little more salt than usual so that I'd still have the salty flavor that parmesan cheese usually lends.
-I had panko bread crumbs (not Italian) so I just seasoned them up with some dried herbs, salt, and pepper.

OVERALL= YUM!!

My wife loves Eggplant, and I made this recipe for her for our anniversary. Everyone, even my carnivore son who is convinced that vegetables are not food but what food eats LOVED it! My Son-in-law raved about it. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of using a store bought marinara sauce( Newmans Own) simply because it's my families favorite sauce, and I tend to like the convenience of jar sauce over making my own. Regardless my family which has two younger children ( Ages 3 and 9) fell in love with this dish, and it's since become a part of the family recipe box. Thank you to the Author for an outstanding recipe!

This was my first time using an eggplant. I did do the salting for about 3 hours, and followed the recipe as written.  My family thought it was pretty good, but the eggplant slices that were underneath were too soggy and had a weird texture.  Next time I will probably make a single layer so everyone can enjoy their eggplant.  Good flavor combinations.  I served it over Mafalda pasta (which is similar to tiny lasagna noodles), and this texture worked well with the main course.

Terrific recipe! This recipe made an eggplant lover out of me. I was skeptical about eggplant as my first attempt years ago tasted , as I recall, much like a sponge). This was super easy to make, too. Came out perfectly! Will definitely be making this again and have added it to my "favorites" file! Thank you for sharing it!

This was my first attempt at making Eggplant Parmesan and it was great! I used homemade spaghetti sauce instead of a jar to regulate the salt. I did notice that when baking the eggplant it took a little longer than 5 minutes to crispy mine but other than that I had no problems with this recipe! Will definitely make this again!

Delicious!  Several steps to get this recipe fully complete, but it's worth it.  I ended up with a huge amount of eggplant parmesan, so I divvied it up and froze several portions.  Hubs doesn't like it, so it will be all mine.  I ate it over spaghetti and gave him some sauce and meatballs over spaghetti to make him happy.  We were both happy for dinner that way.  :)  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe and fairly easy. Only thing is that it definitely takes longer than 5 minutes a side to get them golden and slightly crispy. I had them in 10 minutes and they still weren’t brown so I put them under the broiler.

Wonderful recipe! My family loved it, hubby got seconds! Grandkids said it tasted like lasagna, ( their only reference other than pizza of Italian food lol ). Even my finicky, none veggie eaters loved it.

It’s delicious. But it’s better if the eggplant is fried and a bit crispy before continuing

Husband said it was the best eggplant parm I've made yet. I made it exactly as written as it was really good. I'm not a fan of store bought sauces but I used Aldi's and it was good. I think next time I will my own marinara and see if I get the same results.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

I tried it, but I still say frying the eggplant is better.  Had to put it back in the oven after 30 minutes because eggplant wasn't cooked through.

I followed the directions but changed my breading to keto-friendly. I loved it! Thank you for providing a great recipe so I could use my first ever homegrown eggplant!

Also due to time, I didn't sweat it for 3 hours, more like 1. I left the skin on as others said and it was fine but I'll probably peel it next time for ease in cutting with a fork.

Great recipe! I’ve never baked the eggplant before assembly. It was really good that way, baked enough so as not to get soggy once you put the dish together. I followed this recipe and made my own gravy. It was a hit! Thanks for sharing it!

I ended up using almost 2 cups of parmesan and 3 jars (24oz. each) of sauce. Using only the one jar barely covered the bottom of the pan and the first layer of eggplant slices. As for the parmesan, the amount in the breadcrumb portion was fine, but again, 1/4 cup to cover multiple layers of eggplant in a 9x13 pan just doesn't come close to covering the eggplant. I mean this is eggplant "parmesan". Other than those two quantity issues though, this recipe is DELICIOUS! My family loved it. It made a great semi-vegetarian (cheese) option for our diet. I do think next time I'm going to try it with cubed eggplant and maybe add a few other veggies in it just to experiment.

I will definitely make this recipe again. My change was a big one: I used my homemade tomato and zucchini sauce. It was delicious! My husband even commented on how good it was. We are not regular eggplant eaters, but our store had beautiful ones on sale and I couldn't resist. I'm so glad I didn't!

I followed the recipe except used panko breadcrumbs and used convection oven to brown. It seemed the temperature was too low to brown them, so  I had to brown twice as long.  Switched to regular oven. Baked 30 min  and the eggplant was overcooked and chewey. Sauce was  dry. It was awful.  Seemed temperature and timing was all wrong. Not sure what else it would be.

I make this all the time.  Sometime I cut the eggplant in thin slices and other times larger slices.  It is good either way. ***Make sure you rinse the eggplant after salting or it will be overly salty.***

I have made this several times.  I never peel the eggplant and use unseasoned panko instead of Italian breadcrumbs.  I make my own marinara sauce during the 3 hour wait for the eggplant.  Also, fresh mozzarella is better than grated.

Eggplant was hard. Followed directions but did not cover with foil. Is this why?

This is excellent. Several years ago, I had a similar recipe that called for wheat germ and Parmesan, rather than breadcrumbs and Parmesan. This reminds me of it and next time, I may try wheat germ for nostalgia’s sake

UPDATE. the second time I made this I used fresh mozzarella and it was unbelievable. Best eggplant Parma I have ever had.

I used fresh, thinly sliced mozzarella on each and sprinkled fresh basil on top. Fresh is always better! It’s a great recipe to use eggplant. Just make sure to let it sweat with salt, rinse and pat dry before egg batter.

Somehow It posted my review before I was done... I tried this dish for dinner because I heard eggplant parm could induce labor. So far, no baby but it has only been 15 min. Anyways, my husband was very skeptical, yet we all ended up loving it. Even our 1 1/2 year old loved it. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars was that it turned out pretty soft. Many other reviews said it would be crispy. Ours was not. I think next time we will try to bake the eggplant by itself for 15 min a side. We also had ours on top of angel hair past and that was a perfect meal. Thanks for the recipe.

I put a lot of salt on the sices and placed them on paper towels for an hour and a half and it absorbed all the moisture. I made my own garlic basil marinara sauce from tomato paste. Great dish! I will definitely be making this again!

I made it as written, used Prego Roasted Garlic and Basil pasta sauce.  I salted the slices and let sit in a colander for 45 minutes, then rinsed off and dried on paper towels before baking.  I baked at 375 degrees for approx 15 minutes, to get them nice and crispy.  Was super easy and very tasty.

Yummy! I coated and baked mine on a wire rack, at 400 for 30 minutes. Then covered them with warm sauce. This gave them a crispy coating. Delish!

I did not alter the recipe; I may make it again but would make a few changes... maybe a little cayenne in the breading and some additional flavoring the sauce in the form of some onion. A solid general eggplant parmesan. One other thing was it made enough for 6 six servings, but my wife and I found it did not reheat well at all. I served over top of some angel hair pasta.

The recipe is fine if you rinse the salt off the eggplant after drawing the moisture out of it.  Miss that step and it is too salty.  Lay these over a bed of zucchini noodles and you have a vegetable feast.

My daughter and I made this and it turned out wonderful. The only changes were that we made it in a lasagna pan so the layers came out different. Also, we added more fresh basil than it calls for because we love the flavor. It makes a very hearty meal with crusty Italian bread and a crisp romaine salad.

I had to halve the recipe because one of my purchased eggplants was bad inside. I ended up with one good-sized eggplant yielding 24 slices which made 12 neat little stacks rather than a full casserole. That was perfect as a side dish for six to eight instead of an entree. I almost gave it only four stars because 28 ounces of sauce was only enough to cover the bottom of the dish thinly with two cups and then allow for a rounded tablespoon on each slice as I stacked them. If I had used the full two eggplants, I think It would’ve needed one to two additional cups of sauce. That said, it was still good and my 3 picky grandkids thought it was “ok”. I baked the breaded slices 15 minutes without turning; I turned only 3 of them as a test and couldn’t tell the difference. The lighter-filled 9”x13” dish was done in 25 minutes.

We loved it! I was skeptical but it was great. I didn't peel the eggplant. Didn't feel like it. Per other reviewers advice I only sweated the eggplant about an hour and baked the slices 10 min on each side. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Definitely going into the rotation.

This recipe was great! I've previously made the dish where the eggplant was fried and much prefer this one.  My eggplants were large so I used 4 eggs and 2 cups breadcrumbs to coat, I also increased bake time to 10 min per side to ensure crispiness.  Other than topping with fresh basil no changes were made and it was delicious.  Thanks!

This is a new favorite. I skipped salting the eggplant and I think it caused me to have to bake the eggplant longer to get it crispy. It was super yummy .

Great recipe!  This was my first attempt at eggplant parm and my family could be happier!  I did add provolone cheese on the first layer but held true to the rest of the recipe.  Thank you for a truly wonderful meal!

Very good however I would double the sauce mixture because I ran out of sauce. Also, I used more eggs to dip the eggplant in.

Need 4 eggs and 2 cups of breadcrumb mixture.  Maybe my eggplants were too big -- It was yummy!

My husband and I enjoyed this meal. I did salt the eggplant slices and let them set for 30 minutes, rinsed them and dried with paper towel before dipping into beaten egg. I used Emeril's Marinara sauce.  I will make again.

I can't think of a single complaint?! So thats 5 stars! The only thing i did a tad different was i sliced the egg plant thinner than instructed and really let it brown good on both sides...I probably spent the most time doing that. I also set oven to 375. I also didn't have it swimming in sauce because i didn't want a bowl of mush....so I added more sauce on top after. It was amazing!

I put cooked spaghetti squash on the bottom and added Tofurky Italian Sausage, cooked and sliced in small pieces throughout. I also added fresh oregano and basil and used vegan mozzarella cheese also. This was a delicious dish. I also cooked it about 10 minutes longer.

So good! I would suggest 3 eggplants if you plan on making 16 ounces of pasta. I needed extra pasta sauce as well. I made the recipe as above (with the addition of some chopped onion) then made pasta like usual. As soon as I drained the pasta I dumped in a bag of spinach and can of diced tomatoes. I put that over top the eggplant parm. Can go right into freezer.

We really enjoyed this! Very quick and good. I only "sweated" the eggplant for 30 minutes and it was fine. Next time I will put more sauce on top of the last round or maybe put tin foil on it in the oven. The top was a bit rubbery in spots. I think the secret is really good jarred sauce.

Delicious!! But I wonder about pics...pomplemouse looks like they made spaghetti. Campbell,,,WTH is that? Ashleyr's looks like meatloaf. Nickb, hebbies and Haleys, who puts green tomatoes on top? Strange. Francis honey, that looks like biscuits & gravy.  Gigi... on top of broccoli or salad? Really? Weird. And Lou, you had the prettiest!  Everybody else's looks good.

I liked it, but adapted it for a low sodium diet and had no complaints. I replaced bread crumbs with Panko plain crumbs, used a no salt added Marinara, no salt tomatoes and lo sodium mozzarella from the deli, sliced thin. 
I did use the salt on the eggplant slices, but just a tiny bit did the trick!

Easy recipe, I liked the fact I didn't have to stand over the stove and fry the eggplant.   It did take more than five minutes to brown the breaded eggplant in the oven.  More like 15-20 minutes at 350.  Other than that, the recipe was delicious!

Delicious and very easy recipe. The only things I did differently was to salt the slices for 1 1/2 hours, then I rinsed them thoroughly and patted them dry before dipping them I'm the eggs. I also baked the eggplant slices for 8 minutes on each side instead of 5. My husband and son loved it and asked for seconds. I will definitely make this again!

I will make this again but will rinse all the salt off instead of just wiping it off. Cut the eggplant 3/8ths instead of 4/8ths inch.

Delicious!  Modified to make a very small dish.  Layer of sauce, 4 eggplant slices on top of that.  Then topped each slice with:  a little Parmesan, a little mozzarella, a little sauce, a little Parmesan, a little mozzarella and then topped with fresh chopped basil.  YUM!!!!

I made this with a fresh tomato marinara and it was just amazing.  My husband thinks I walk on water right now.  I baked the eggplant about three minutes longer than the recipe indicated but that may be my oven.  Absolutely delighted.

Love this! My husband is a chef and loved it too. Suggested searing the Eggplant in small amounts of olive oil, then bread,etc. I added some slices of heirloom tomatoes on top with more cheese and garlic powder. Definitely will save this one.

The only change I made to this recipe was adding some red pepper flakes to the sauce - has to be "arrabiatta"!  Love it, it was great.  Definitely will make again.

A little salty.  Maybe only leave the slices in the salt for about  45 min.  I turned up the heat in the oven when baking the eggplant slices to make them more crispy, and added extra shredded Parmesan.  I cooked fettuccine to put on my dish.  Excellent!  Most rewarding aspect- I grew the eggplant.  Thank you for a simple, great recipie!

This was my first attempt making anything eggplant. I love my mother-in-laws eggplant Parmesan and this was nothing like hers :/ I did not peel the skin off of mine (I meant to and realized after slicing it all up that I forgot!) so my mother-in-law told me just to remember for next time! Everything else I followed to a tee, but my eggplant was a bit hard/not on the mushy or soft side the way I like. Anyone else have the same issue? What did I do wrong? Was it supposed to be covered or uncovered?

Really good!  I added a layer of ricotta between the eggplant, just wonderful.  Fresh basil in the ricotta layer probably would have made it even better, but I didn't have any.  Next time!

I usually spend hours peeling, slicing and frying large amounts of eggplant to freeze to use in eggplant parmigiana. This was so quick and tasty. Froze in freezer bags. Just pulled them out when ready to assemble parmigiana, assemble and bake. My new go to recipes and a lot healthier too.

I loved this recipe. I am not a very good cook but even my daughter who is a cook loved it.  It's delicious forgiving without a big mess to clean up.  I usually fry the eggplant in oil and hate the cleanup.  This is terrific , I will make this again and again. 
Thank you

Many people have noted that this dish is salty. Here is a tip to avoid that. After bleeding the eggplant (I bleed it for roughly an hour), rinse off the eggplant with water and then dry them with a clean towel. That will get all that salt off the eggplant and your dish will not be overly salty.

I have made eggplant parmesan in the past, but this is the first time that I made it and loved it!. I would have given it 5 stars, but since I had to modify the recipe a little, I only did 4 stars. I cut the eggplant a little thinner and only let it sweat for about 45 minutes. I did have to cook it about 15 minutes per side, instead of the 5 minutes in the recipe, which was the biggest change; made planning dinner a little tricky! Now that I know, I will budget the extra time in without a problem. I am sure my measurements were off with the cheese and sauce, I just eyeball it to how I want it! Delicious! Already packed the leftovers away to bring for my lunch tomorrow.

Liked it a lot. Followed recipe pretty close, and it turned out just a biiit salty, but not too bad. I would definitely recommend going easy when salting the eggplant before sweating. I only did so for about an hour and a half, worked out fine. Also, have a second jar of sauce handy just in case.

Skipped the sweating, eggplant was a little firm but not bad at all.  Didn't use all of the sauce but wanted it when I put this on angel hair pasta.  Didn't use that much mozzarella but increased the parmesan.

This dish was delicious. The only thing I had an issue with was the cooking time. It says 35 minutes but the pan was full. I checked it at 35 minutes and it was not done yet. I will do what another poster suggested and bake it an additional 15 minutes or so. I did cover it for most of the baking time so the cheese would not burn.

I am rating this a 5, but please keep in mind that the end result is going to greatly depend on your sauce brand!  Those that complained it was too salty...well, duh, don't use a salty spaghetti sauce.  The eggplant itself was really good.  I loved the technique and not having to fry it.  I had one very large eggplant, and that was enough for this dish.  I also made my own breadcrumbs in the blender with saltine crackers b/c I was out.  That worked fine.  I baked my coated eggplant in a 375 oven for 10 minutes each side before they got brown.  I kept the oven at 375 for the final 35 minute bake.  Unfortunately, I only had a "cheaper" brand of spaghetti sauce in my cupboard, so I was disappointed in supper for that reason.  I know it would have been phenomenal with a phenomenal sauce.  I'll plan better next time, but this was kind of a last-minute decision meal.  Overall, I would definitely make this again!

Never eaten or cooked eggplant in my life. Made this dish for my very picky father and he said it was a 9 3/4 out of 10! I added fresh basil in the layers and also spruced up the bread crumbs with added rosemary and basil. We both absolutely loved it!!

I wanted to try eggplant some way that didn't involve frying it, but this recipe is not for me. I've only had eggplant once before and it was fried and good, but both my husband and I took one bite of this and couldn't eat it. I followed all directions but eggplant was mushy. Fortunately I also made a few zucchini slices the same way and those were delicious.

My first review posted before I was done- trying again. This was definitely a hit. Like some others I increased the bake time for the eggplant- about 8-9 min per side. I also added zucchini, sliced lengthwise. I think I liked the zucchini better than the eggplant, but both were good. May try a fradiavolo sauce next time. Nice healthy & flavorful dish.

Been making eggplant Parmesan for years. This is the most awesome recipe yet! Loved baking the eggplant (been frying in coconut oil but eggplant absorbs too much oil). Love the combo of bread crumbs and parmasean. That is a great idea. Grow my own eggplant. Make my own marinara sauce.  This recipe brings out all the best flavor so in one mouthful. Made two pans. Plan to freeze most of it in two-serving dishes. Thx for such a great recipe!

slices in colander  - but next time I will give it a go.  Give this a try -
you won't be sorry.  I'm sure the left-overs will be Great tomorrow.  Thank you.

Iit was very chewy. The breaking was nice though. If I try it again maybe I'll slice the eggplant thinner.

I love this recipe. I kind of deconstructed it because I am allergic to tomatoes and needed to control the amount of sauce per serving. It is very tasty and I will do it again!

I had never made Eggplant Parmesan until I tried this recipe.  It was good.  But I think the eggplant needs to be seeded and fried, my eggplant pieces were too rubbery and the batter didn't stick as well as it should have.  I forgot to use the extra tablespoon of salt and didn't miss it at all.  I will be trying this again but I will be frying the eggplant pieces.

Maybe wasn't our thing? I followed the recipe to a t, but it just wasn't substantial or satisfying. I think next time I'll just fry the eggplant slices individually & serve over pasta with marinara

I was skeptical that my 10 year old would eat this.  But she did and loved it!  This is going to be another staple in our diet!  

Ran out of parm and just used shredded mozzarella.  Still turned out yummy!

It was great. It was easier to bake the eggplant than frying it. I used 3/4 of a large eggplant and made homemade breadcrumbs with 2 pieces of bread + parmesan + Italian seasonings in food processor. I was able to stretch 1/2 a jar of pasta sauce. Delicious- it's a keeper!
