This is the exact same recipe that I have for Cola Burgers, and I have to tell you........ they are awesome! However, there are a couple of secrets I will share. Try not to over mix it. And PLEASE be sure to cook the burgers SLOWLY. This keeps them juicy! And if you are lucky enough to have any leftover, they taste just as good the next day! I hope you like them as much as we do!

To avoid the falling-apart problem, allow the meat mixture to sit in the fridge foar about 20 minutes before forming into patties, then let the patties sit in the fridge for at least 15 min before puttin on the grill.  Delicious!

The best burger recipe on this web site (and I have tried at least 4 others). These are by far the most juicy burgers we have ever made. I had 2 people ask for the recipe at our BBQ. I tripled the ingredients that were actually mixed in with the meat for 5 lbs. of ground beef (made 12 good size burgers after cooking). We skipped the brushing the burgers with the dressing and they were still great. I added a pureed medium onion to the ground beef mixture, because we like the onion flavor, but not the onion chunks. I didn't have french dressing so I replaced with ketchup and we still loved them. I will try it with french next time to see if it makes a difference. Thanks, Shay - I have been looking forever for a burger recipe with great flavor that doesn't get dried out.

This was really good!I did however add some chopped onion & garlic powder. I didn't have any French dressing to put inside but ran to the store & picked up some, so I did baste with it. Ev1 enjoyed them. Not dry @ all.

Amazing, I made this at school, I topped it with Sauteed mushrooms, onions, cheese, lettuce and pickles, and they sold out within minutes. I have people begging me to make them again!

This grilled hamburger recipe is by far one of the best I have tried.  I followed the recipe to the exact measure.  I loved the finished product and so did my family.  The burgers were flavorful and juicy.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I made these tonight and they are nicely moist. I had to make a few substitutions, but they still turned out yummy. I used 7UP in lieu of cola and I didn't grill them...I fried them by getting my frying pan screaming hot, then lowered the temperature to medium heat. I added garlic powder and chopped onion, too.

The burgers tasted good and I'll make some again next time but the burgers crumbled as i was grilling it so i mixed in some flour to the next batch before grilling...and that seemed to do the trick for me.

Our family of five LOVED this recipe!  My pickiest eater begs me to make this.  Refrigerating did help it stay together.  But you do have to be careful for it to stay together on the grill.

Love these burgers!! I made them a little while ago for my family. They loved them. The "special sauce" you baste the burgers with goes great on the burger itself, instead of ketchup.

These burgers are great. My 2 younger boys (4 and 9) aren't burger guys but they eat these burgers like it's their last meal. These burgers stay very moist and are very tasty. I'm not sure which burgers idonteatblue made, but I find it hard to believe it was these.

I don't get all of the rave reviews.  These burgers are mediocre.  Not enough flavor.  If you use this recipe, season them up.  Otherwise, they're bland, boring burgers.

My guysare not big on hamburgers, but they really liked these.  I used Bacon flavored Western Dressing (all I had no hand) and didnot change anything else.  I did put the meat in the fridge for 20 minutes as suggested by another reviewer, then formed the patties and put back in fridge for 15 minutes.  I cooked them on the stove and basted as I flipped them.  Will definitely make these again!

I really liked to flavor of these burgers.  Their texture was somewhere between a regular burger and meatloaf because of the egg, and my husband didn't like them because of that.  But I did!

We really love this recipe. It is really juicy and not at all dry. I went ahead and prepared the patties ahead of time and refrigerated them so I would not have the problems of the meat falling apart like others had said. I had no problem at all. Everybody at our cookout is asking for this recipe!  We seem to be KING OF THE GRILL..and honestly..we are newbies..LOL.

Great, juicy burger! I have a tendency to overmix my burgers but these stuck together very well and had a great flavor. I didn't have French dressing so I used Western instead. Topped with some home made onion rings and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, awesome :)

Don't let the ingredients scare you....Moist, Delicious Burgers...The Hit of the Party!

Just handle with care as they tend to fall apart easier than the regular ole' burger.  Remember to oil the grill!!!

These are good as is, or dress them up with your fav. fixins'!  YUMMY!

Thought I would give this a try.  I reduced the amount of cola and dressing and substituted italian bread crumbs for the saltines. I also added garlic, onion, and parsley.  Will definitely be making this again!!!

Made exactly as written and they were excellent!  After making the patties I put them in the freezer until I was ready to cook them.  I can see how people complained about them falling apart.  I did not have that problem, and I think the key is to not over mix the meat, keep them atleast refrigerated right up until you throw them on the grill, and don't OVERFLIP them!  Once or twice should help them stay together.

If taste were the number one thing you rated this recipe on it would be a 5, but after reading the reviews and making the needed adjustments it was difficult to get it to cook without falling apart. I have frozen the extra raw burgers and will attempt to bake those burgers to see if I can keep them together since it  seems to be the flipping that causes it to fall apart. I might attempt it again and put flour in it as one review suggested or maybe even bread crumbs.  I made this again with frozen burgers and had no problem with it falling apart.

I have tried countless burger recipes, and this by far is the best!!! I was weary since there were not spices, but I have never made a more juicy or flavorful burger! I was forced to make a few substitutions since I was missing some ingredients...I used barbeque sauce in place of the french dressing, and Ritz crackers instead of saltines. I broiled them at the same grilling time recommended. I then used a combo of american and port wine cheese, which was so tasty I decided to mix the cheese combo in some milk in a sauce pan, and used that for cheese fries. So yummy! Thanks!

My husband and I tried to make these and about ruined our grill.  My husband was NOT HAPPY!  They wouldn't stay together and disentigrated into a bunch of tiny pieces through the grates of the grill.  Maybe we missed a step somewhere or something, but I even went back through and reread the recipe and all the ingredients and amounts and think we made it right.  Maybe these would be easier to try on a foreman grill or something.  I don't think we will be trying to make these again.

This is the best burger recipe I have tried so far. Burgers turn out very tender and juicy and will remain so even if you refrigerate any left overs for the next day. A family favorite!

Great Burgers.  I usually just like plain burgers - but these are light and great tasting.

My family loved these!  I got a great deal on lean ground beef at the grocery store, so I made a triple batch of these and packed them up in freezer bags for individual meals during the week.  It was a great timesaver..I'd just take out a package, thaw them briefly in the microwave while my Foreman grill heated up!  I also added some chopped onion...and would recommend it

These were just okay for me.  I don't like French dressing, so I used Ranch dressing instead, but everything else stayed the same.  I didn't think that flavor was that strong or noticeable, but maybe that's because I didn't use the French dressing!  Thanks for sharing.

My husband says these are a 5!  Although some of them stuck to the grill (mostly on the hot spots and next time I will avoid those), they were INCREDIBLY moist and juicy!  These are best cooked slow.  We slapped some provolone on and we were GOOD TO GO!  YUMmmmY!!

Delicious! Most of ours fell apart, too. I refrigerated it and then again after I made the patties, but it still fell apart. It didn't matter. It still tasted the same and was wonderful! We'll definitely be making these again.

Not a big fan. Burgers were too soupy. Even my husband, who will eat anything, didn't finish his. I like the taste itself, but just would cut down ALOT on the liquids.

We really didn't care for these burgers at all. We all love hamburgers here, and even my hubby said these burgers were bland. I also noticed they fell apart quite easliy while cooking. Sorry but I don't think i'll make these again.

I loved these burgers. I live in a house with two very picky males and they also just loved these burgers. I did make a few alterations. I used light Spicey French dressing and I added 1/4 chopped yellow onion, and 5 cloves minced garlic (we are garlic lovers) Also I wanted to use Bread crumb instead of crushed saltines but it turned out I was out of bread crumbs so I crushed some garlic herb crutons in a food processer and used those instead. Again these turned out great, way better then the BBQ place next door.

These burgers are amazing!  We've had them a couple of times, and each time they were gobbled up and enjoyed by all.  They make the most juicy, tender and flavorful burgers.  The only thing I do differently, is I leave out the parmesan cheese as my daughter is allergic to dairy.  I don't know if I will ever make any other kind of burger!  DELICIOUS!!!

The burgers did not hold together, they charred on the outside.  They were way too sweet.  How can you serve a burger that is in pieces?  Husband and kids greatly disliked it, since "hate" is a word that is not used in our home.  I think that says it all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

These were nice and moist, but you really couldn't taste any of the other flavors added to the recipe.  A lot of extra calories added, for not much extra flavor.  Next time I would just try adding the cola and an egg to the beef and you would probably have the same effect.

This recipe was good, but not great. I cooked these for my coworkers for lunch today and one coworker said they were too "mushy." Personally, I didn't think they had enough flavor. Other than that, they were very juicy and tender! I think this would make a better meatloaf recipe though- which is what I am doing with the leftover mixture for dinner tonight :)

These were great!  Since it's winter in Michigan, I fried mine in a pan!  I forgot to get the saltines, so I used the only other crackers I had.  Mozzarella Cheez -Its turned out to work just perfect.  Like I usually do, I used ground turkey in place of beef.  I'll be making these a lot for sure!

This is slow and I can only make one burger at a time,my burgers are 5-6 oz though(to heck with those quarter pounders) I have a 5qt crockpot that I have used a couple of times for burgers. I put an inverted microwave dish from a frozen dinner in the bottom and punch holes in it so the fat drains through. I form and season my burger from ground turkey in a small sauce pan and if it wants to fall apart when I try to tranfer it to the crockpot, I just pop it pan and all in the freezer for 15-20 minutes. It takes about an hour on high to cook but, they're pretty tasty and moist.  just check it from time to time with a meat thermometer,(165* or better). Towards the end you can lay a slice of your favorite cheese on it. Happy Burger Baking!

The flavor of these were good but they fell apart on the grill.  I even refrigerated them like some of the reviews suggested.  Maybe use more crackers next time to bind them.  Not sure.

Really good, juicy burgers.  I was worried about these with my picky kids but even they loved them.  Thanks for an awesome recipe. Tonight, I shaped the mixture into a meatloaf and baked it for 1 hour at 350.  The Best meatloaf EVER!!

These are easy to make and we had no trouble with them falling apart during grilling. We did do as one reviewer suggested and mix the beef mixture up and refrigerated for about 20 minutes. We then formed the patties and refrigerated for additional 15 minutes. This may or may not be why we had no trouble with them falling apart. They were, however, a bit bland for us.

We loved these!!! I left them sit overnight in fridge and then grilled them on my George Foreman grill. They came out very moist. The extra french dressing/cola sauce was nice as a dipping sauce too for the burgers.

Instant hit! I also let the ground beef rest for about 45 mins. an had no problem with the patties desintegrating. Very flavorful!

Very tasty, but fell apart.  I will try again with some of the variations mentioned in previous reviews. I wish there were a 4.5 star rating.

I made these burgers last night and thought they were great although I was a little surprised at how soft they were. Maybe next time I will cook them just a little longer.

My husband and I rarely agree on the number of stars a recipe should receive - but we did this time. These were so moist, I did not need to put anything on them but American cheese. I used buffalo instead of beef and left out the parm cheese because that just sounded gross to me.
 I will never not use this recipe!

OMG....these are the BEST burgers we have ever had.  I have an ultra picky family and these burgers were a hit.  Used the recipe as is.

We served this at a barbeque for 12 on Sunday and everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe. "Try it, you'll like it!"

I followed this recipe to the tee, however when I finally ate my burger I didn't notice any cola taste. If anything it was rather bland and a waste of my time. Perhaps it was just me, but I won't be trying this one again.

I reduced this recipe to four servings and had to use Thousand Island dressing instead of French dressing.  (I didn't realize we were out of French.)  We thought they were good, but next time I'm planning on using the French dressing to see if they are even better.

Couldnt taste a huge difference between these and a regural burger.  I used plenty of french dressing and then used ranch to dip rather than ketchup. they were good
