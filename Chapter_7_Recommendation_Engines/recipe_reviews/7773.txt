I made this cake last night.  It was absolutely delicious - light and fluffy, almost caramel-like in flavour.  The only change that I made to the recipe was to use real maple syrup instead of imitation, and to use about 1 1/2 tablespoons instead of 1 teaspoon.  I also made the maple butter frosting and it really made the cake something special.  I have already had requests to make it for several parties in the near future, and given the response, I will definitely oblige!

I have to respectfully disagree with the submitter's remarks that this cake requires no icing - oh yes it does.  On its own it is fairly flavorless and a tad dry, even tho' I watched the baking time carefully.  A solution might be to add another 1/4 cup sugar, or maybe another egg - or swap out the milk for buttermilk or sour cream.  Or use half butter, half shortening.  Any or all of these suggestions might help, but you shouldn't have to toy around with this type of recipe.  It should already be trustworthy.  I am in no hurry to make this again or even have another piece.  (I didn't even finish the one I cut for myself)  My 3-star rating is generous.

Good and easy recipe.  I topped with Maple Icing from this site (my favorite icing!).  Used a little bit of whole wheat pastry flour.  Loved the walnuts!

I made this with PECANS and won a blue ribbon at our County Fair with this a few days ago.    I added a bit more milk & baking powder.  I also used part butter pecan flavoring and part maple extract.  I doubled it to make an 8" layer cake, and then I used my own cream cheese icing recipe to top it, and pressed pecans on the sides.    It was great -- we sampled what was left after judging.

This cake is truly wonderful. Light, fluffy, moist and the maple flavour is just right. The nuts really add a special touch to it. The taste reminded me of the Maple Nut ice cream I bought from the store a while back. I frosted this cake with Maple Butter Frosting (also from this site) and this took the cake from heavenly to divine! Loved the recipe, thanks for sharing :).

I thought this cake was a fantastic base recipe...my roommate is a maple addict, so I made it with a few variations--didn't have the baking powder so i used yogurt instead of the milk and baking soda for the powder (old standby substitution), maple syrup for the extract (obviously cut the sugar), and a little less flour as the other reviewers suggested. I also used egg beaters and light butter to make it a little healthier. it was light and delicious, and I frosted it the next day with the cream cheese maple icing on here.  as long as it was well-covered it stayed absolutely fine (this is a week later), so maybe that was a fluke for some people.  At any rate, a delicious recipe, especially with a few changes.

I made this cake for my mom for her birthday. Came out very well.  I used an extra 1/4 cup of milk since some people said theirs came out too dry.

This turned out absolutely wonderful. I used almost all organic ingredients. Instead of plain milk, I used lowfat buttermilk and I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts. This was a snap to make and really rose beautifully. I used a simple maple icing to go over the top of this. My husband cut into it this afternoon and just fell in love. It's wonderful as is, but this would be great with a little cinnamon and nutmeg, too.

This is really good with the maple frosting, and stays good without losing any flavor or texture for several days.  A nice side item with breakfast. Thanks for the recipe :)

Very easy to make.  I made these as cupcakes it made 11 large cupcakes. Cooked them for 30min Followed the recipe exactly and found these were very good not a super moist cake but not really dry either.  adjust maple flavoring to taste as is its not very mapley. (is that even a word? lol) 
Will make again. ps. I topped with the Maple Butter Frosting from this site.

I had much higher hopes for this one.

I followed the recipe exactly.  The only change I made was to substitute pecans for walnuts (my boyfriend doesn't really like walnuts)  I cooked my cake for exactly 40 minutes, checking it beforehand to see if it was done earlier.  At first glance it looked like it came out perfectly. It certainly smelled divine.  

However, after tasting it, I was a bit disappointed.  I used the Maple Butter Frosting from this site on it, and everyone agreed the frosting was the best part of the cake.  My cake came out very dense and a bit dry.  I'm willing to concede that perhaps it should have come out of the oven a few minutes earlier, but based on the texture of batter before it was baked, I tend to believe this is just how it's supposed to be.  I'm sure some people enjoy a cake with this texture, it's just not my thing.

This was pretty good, but I wasn't overly impressed with the texture or flavor of these.  I made this into 14 cupcakes that baked for about 17 min.  I used 1 c milk, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1 tsp of vanilla.  Something just seemed missing.  I made the maple cream cheese icing from this site, but preferred them plain.

This smells so good and has a delicious buttery, maple flavor.  I purchased maple extract just to make this recipe and followed the recipe as written.  I'll make this again.

I give it a 4 1/2, but the cake is a tad bit dry. Will reduce the flour next time to see if that helps! That said, the cake is gone at my house!

This was a good cake, but very dry.  I only cooked it for 35 minutes and it still came out extremely dry.  I used the maple icing from this site and don't think it would have been very good without it.  I love that it only makes a half of a sheet and it's very easy. Thanks!

Good flavor but the consistency was more like bread or crumb cake. I added 1/4 cup of half & half in addition to the milk and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup. I used male syrup instead of extract and added 1 tsp extra of male syrup. I also reduced the baking time to 35mins. but it still came out a bit dryer than I expected. I topped it with the maple icing from this site which went nicely with the cake.

Very good.   I made 42 mini cupcakes baking them for 15 minutes.  The Maple Butter Icing is delicious and it was just the right amount for the cupcakes.

This cake turned out dense for me.  I was surprised after seeing so many 5-star reviews and claims that it was fluffy.  I baked it in a 9" round pan, which perhaps was a mistake.  The crumb was coarse, and the texture was more like a muffin than a cake.

I cooked for the minimal amount of time and it was not under or overdone. The texture of this cake was very heavy and kind of dry, like banana bread except not even slightly moist. It was not cakelike at all. I disagree with the poster who claimed it did not need icing. I made a maple buttercream icing which was pretty good but even it could not save this cake. No one finished their slices and the remaining half of the cake went into the trash.  I really wanted to like this recipe I like maple but I cannot recommend it and I will not be making it again.

This was amazing! I made just a few changes for my needs. Used the recipe as a base and just substituted the sugar with pure stevia, substituted all purpose flour with oat flour and added 1/4 cup extra of fair life milk for extra moisture plus a bit more pure maple extract for more of a maple flavor. It's was super moist and absolutely delicious!! I'm giving some away so I don't eat it all! I will definitely be making this again!

Way to dry and dense.  Maybe using cake flour instead of all purpose.  I am not into heavy duty cakes.  My husband tried it, said not to make it again.  But, I will give it a whirl again with the cake flour and real maple syrup.

i substituted a couple tablespoons maple syrup for the maple extract as i can't get that where i live.  because i made this on christmas day, i added some freshly grated nutmeg and cinnamon.  this is such an easy recipe with ingredients that i usually have on hand, will definitely be making this again and often.  :)

This recipe is so GOOD!!!  I used splenda instead of sugar to try to get it a little less of a guilty indulgence!  Very tasty and super moist... I also did add a little extra maple extract for more flavor! (personal choice) This is just an all around awesome cake!!!

Wonderful taste, great texture. Cream cheese icing and/or Apple-cinnamon fill makes this recipe pop! My only warning: the time on the cake was different for my oven. It baked for 30 min, and was slightly overcooked. I would watch what your oven does, but the taste... AMAZING!
