This ended up way better than I thought. I had never cooked or eaten swiss chard before, but I love carmelized onions. I'm also not a big olive fan (though I like olive oil, go figure) and couldn't find any capers. So I cut out the olive, cut out the capers. The salt I just eyeballed, and more or less only used slightly more than I'd use for any vegetable sweat. 

I couldn't believe the flavor and the aroma, I could have eaten a whole pan of it. My wife loved it too. This one will become a regular.

One thing I'd advise is to make sure you don't rush the onions. It can take a long time (longer than is indicated on this recipe) to properly carmelize them on low heat, and if you put them on high heat they'll just burn. So don't be suprised if it takes 30 minutes.

This was delicious. I cut out the olives (don't like 'em) and the capers (didn't have any), added garlic ('cause I love it) and it was still wonderful. Making it again tonight!

I have never been a fan of what I call "healthy vegetables". But, I have to admit that this was good tasting. My husband just loved the taste of the dish. No capers, kept everything else but added no salt. The Kalamata Olives were salty enough and they flavored the dish just right.
We found fresh Kalamatas in an open deli case next to the meat dept. in our natural foods store. 
Be sure to let the onion carmelize, it helps with the taste of the dish.
Easy to prepare, good tasting, even to me!
Overall, a great recipe. Thanks

This is now my favorite side dish ever!  Since the greens have such a strong flavor, the smokiness of the olives and the acidity of the lemon were perfect!  My husband and I ate it all in one sitting - but hey, it's greenery, you just can't feel bad about it!  Thanks!!

excellent recipe and reviews. DOn't forget to rinse the capers and olives to get rid of the briny taste.  i served this with seared diver scallops, a rice pilaf and some french bread. Magnifique!

Used 1/2 the lemon and was better.  Also used 1/2 lime which gave it a sweeter taste.  Yum!  Also, instead of sugar, used a tablespoon of fresh juice from grapes and another day used unsweetened applesauce to caramalize onions.  Worked great!    Also tried recipe with collard and kale.  Was great too!

I've got to say, I have a REALLY hard time eating leafy green things. I hate green salads; mainly eat greens either cooked or juiced. So when I give this recipe five stars, it's more like ten stars when adjusted for my extreme-anti disposition.   I made it with these ingredients exactly. The only change I made was to slow-caramelize the onion (took 30-40 minutes).  I'm not a huge olive, caper or salt lover, but man the sweet-bitter-salt-acid combo is PERFECT. This would be pretty average if you took out one of those elements, I do believe. I ate some by itself, and some spiced up w/ pepper flakes on a little chipotle tortilla with pepper jack. Both ways were marvelous.

A friend found this recipe for me after I tried swiss chard for the first time.  She has a great recipe eye, because my husband declared this the best chard I have ever made!   I served it with grilled, thick cut, brined pork chop and mushroom couscous. Fabulous!!

Terrific. I didn't have capers on hand, so I did without, but it was a perfect blend of salty and sweet and the chard flavor was subdued and delicious.  Recommended.

this was good, only a little too salty.. the combination of the olives and the sea salt and the 2 TB of capers made it so.. next time I will either reduce the sea salt or the amount of capers..thanks for a quick and easy way to use up the last of the garden's swiss chard.

Like a few people mentioned below, I left out the olives and capers, because I did not have them on hand. I made sure to add enough kosher salt to season the dish though. Even without the olives and capers this was a DELICIOUS way to serve swiss chard. The tiny bit of brown sugar goes a long way, and is the perfect amount to season the onions and chard. I went the extra mile and added sausage bits and halved cherry tomatoes to the dish, then served it over bow-tie pasta. YUM!

I tried this last night and thought it was horrible.  I really do love wilted greens and cook them in many ways, but wanted to find a new way to cook them and thought this sounding interesting.  Unfortunately, it was just weird. I used a rather large bunch of chard, and I found that this was way too sweet.  I didn't have any olives, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written.  Maybe the saltiness of the olives would have helped a bit, but I'm not sure.  I won't make this again.

it was ok.  needed more than 1 bunch of chard to balance out the olives and capers - or perhaps my stores bunches are smaller than others.  As it was, the olives and capers (both things I love) were completely overpowering.

Really yummy~ my favorite way to do greens. Also good with mushrooms added! My favorite way to use the leftovers: reheat with a can of tomatoes, garlic, Italian herbs, splash of milk, and several Laughing Cow sun dried tomatoes wedges. Then toss with gnocchi pasta.

I'm not a big fan of chard, but it came in our produce delivery.  This was good--even my almost 3-year old son ate it.  We didn't have olives or capers (and don't care that much for them anyway) so just left those out.

A welcome change from the usual things people do with greens (bacon/vinegar). No one likes kalamata, so we skipped those. Enjoyed the salty capers with the sweetness of the sugared onions.

Very different and interesting! My daughter was the first one to volunteer to try it and she really liked it! We even left out the capers and olives and it tasted pretty good. Looking forward to trying different types of this recipe. We now have a new veggie in our family menu and we will be growing it in the garden this year!

I made this as a side for Christmas dinner (with a beer can chicken, pork loin pot roast, mashed taters, spinach lasagna, tri tip, broccoli and a green salad).

Everyone that tasted it really liked it.  My father in law asked for the recipe.  I doubled the recipe except held back the extra capers.  

Carmelizing the onions on high heat is the trick.  I also sliced the olives as opposed to keeping them whole.

Great way to get your leafy greens and introduce folks to a new veggie they may not have tried before!  thanks!

Love the combination of slightly bitter from chard and the sweet from the caramelized onions.  left out the capers because I am not a caper fan, and it was still wonderful.   A keeper.

Loved it! Next time I will cut the olives up a bit (it was not specified, so I used them whole). I used yellow chard because it was what my CSA delivered and I couldn't figure out if there was a difference or not.

I didn't have any brown sugar, so instead I added regular sugar, which worked out great - love the mix of sweet and salty. Also didn't have olives or capers, so I added chopped sugared dates. Delicious!!

I also tried it again recently and added sliced almonds. Was perfect.

This was really tasty even though I had no olives. I eye balled when it was wilted enough but yet with some firmness when the red stem portions were more flexible for serving.     I rinsed my capers before using (only needed 1/2  the amount) and didn't need any salt. i only used 1/2 a lemon for juicing.

I didn't care for the sweet flavor of this dish. The carmelized onion was sweet enough without the brown sugar added. Also I found the olive taste a bit off putting. This was my first time making red chard. I loved green so I was hesitant to give this recipe a lower rating. Maybe I just don't like red? Hubby didn't care for this one much either.

Unlike most of the other reviewers, I didn't have olives but had capers.  This dish was amazing.  My husband raved about it and, though he loves kale, is usually a harder sale on the more earthy chard.  I didn't put lemon over the top because I didn't have any but I did add half a can of white beans to stretch the dish a bit and because my children love beans.

As I occasionally do, I craved greens this morning, went out to my tiny garden and picked a bit of chard, to try this recipe. I had no olives on hand and my chard was green, but followed the rest as written. I really liked it! Wonderful flavor combination. This was the first time I have eaten chard. I will try other greens cooked in the same manner. Thank you!

This was very good.  My fiance and I ate the whole thing. Alterations- I used a red onion and lime instead.  I had no capers or olives, next time I look forward to adding the olives.

Thank you to whoever posted this recipe!  We get a farm share each year and one of the things we end up with tons of is chard.  Other than cooking it with a little butter or oil, it was tough coming up with something to do with it, plus we didn't really enjoy it.  This recipe is so yummy and has a great combination of different flavors!  The onions, olives and capers are such great additions that the focus is taken off the fact that you're eating chard. LOL!  I do recommend tasting it before you add the salt because the olives & capers add a bit on their own.  Also get your onions nice and carmelized before adding them - it makes the dish sweeter.  Because of this recipe, we now enjoy chard instead of just tolerating it!

Delicious recipe! I omitted the olives, but do look forward to making the complete dish very soon. (Tonight, the chard served as a bed for Sesame Tilapia from this site, a superb combination which my family adored -- olives might've been overkill.) Thanks sooooooooo much, Syd!!!

This made a very tasty side dish - served warm and pared with a marinated grilled chicken breast and whole kernel corn, it scored high marks with the family.

I varied from the recipe in that I excluded the capers (not a huge fan and didn't have any available), and used shallots instead of yellow onion.  I also zested a lemon - adding the zest in the last couple of minutes, along with a tablespoon of vermouth.

This was a very good dish, and will prepare it again.

Yum. I will be making this again. Haven't cooked with chard for years. I did use coconut sugar and only half a lemon but it made a wonderful  zingy side dish with rice and other vegetables!

I was very excited to try this recipe as I've never had swiss chard before.  I was given several bunches so the first batch was prepared as written.  The result was just OK.  To me, it lacked a little something but was a good basic recipe.  I wanted something more savory.

Now the second batch was really good after I made substitutions and additions.  Instead of olive oil I used seasoned pork belly fat that I had left over. I used 1/2 tbsp of rice wine vinegar instead of lemon juice and omitted the brown sugar.  Added 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1 small red jalapeno seeded and sliced, 1/2 large red bell pepper diced, 1/3 c diced celery, 1 pinch of chipotle powder and Badia Complete Seasoning to taste.  I used all the other ingredients.

I served the 2nd batch with herb-parmesan crusted flounder and honeyed white rice.  Yum!

All the men, when pressed to make a choice, preferred the 1st batch but oddly enough all the women preferred the 2nd.

I'll definitely make it again with the subs.

I made this exactly as stated, it was delicious! I put over sliced polenta and put a little Parmesan on it. I can see where if you don't like olives or capers you might not like it. Next time I will rinse the capers, forgot but rinsed the olives. I might cut back a little on the lemon juice next time and see how I like it.

I really enjoyed this. I agree it doesn't need salt when using capers. I added heart of Palm - out of olives- and it was delightfully different.

This was a great way to introduce a new green veggie into our diet and try something new for my family. I didn't have olives but didn't miss them. I reduce salt to half that amount, but I kept the capers (they are salty enough already). I added a little extra brown sugar to the onions. I only had maybe 3/4 of my chard still good, the rest had gone a little bad, so I SHOULD have reduced my oil amount, but I added too much, so mine was a little oily and doesn't *look* as pretty as the picture, but it tastes wonderful! I kept a few red stems but not all. I added TONS of pepper because we like pepper. The lemon juice was lovely, too. Overall, great side dish!

Scrumptious! That picture doesn't do it justice...makes it look like an onion dish. I used daintier sliced onion, but regardless, the flavors are **delicious** together. Very good recipe I will use again and again. 

Hey, why do people still rate a dish if they've changed more than 50% of the ingredients? (i.e., "This was delicious. I cut out the olives and the capers and added some other junk...") What?! Can you guys just re-enter the dish the way you changed it, and then rate it?

What a great side dish!  When I added the brown sugar to the onions in the pan, the smell was amazing!  The combination of the sweet onions, briny olives and capers, and the zinginess of the lemon was so refreshing.  I grilled up some turkey kolbassi and served it on top of the chard.  Simple and easy summer meal!

Very simple. I too cut out the olive and the capers. I used a generous teaspoon of sugar for a medium-sized onion and rainbow chard. I also added lemon at the end for a sweet and sour taste. The onions will take a long time to caramelize as other reviewers mentioned - you can skip the complete caramelization process and the end result is still tasty, with the sugar blending in nicely. The fragrance of the onion complements the chard well.

This was the first time I tried cooking red chard, and I really enjoyed this.  I had a friend over for dinner and she kept raving about it.  The only thing I did was use a sweet wine (Muscato) instead of dry by accident!  It still turned out delicious.

Fantastic!  I started out trying it because I had a surplus of chard in the garden, and knew I should eat some greens; I ended up staring down at my plate and wondering where all the chard went.  This is the first cooked chard I have ever truly enjoyed.  Thank you!

delicious-was looking for a recipe to use rainbow chard from farm coop and this was a winner-only had half a lemon and no capers-does take a while to cook down onions on low heat but is worth the wait!

I am NOT a fan of cooked greens, but these were really good.  I received some rainbow chard in our CSA basket, so I was looking for a good way to use some.  This was a good fit.  I fixed it exactly as written except I added some garlic scapes that we also received in the basket. I love olives and that was a strong taste.  I think if you don't like olives, you might want to cut back on those.

Really Good. Chard is super healthy. Chard has shiny green ribbed leaves, with stems that range from white to yellow to red, depending on it's mood. It has a slightly bitter taste. Fresh young chard can be used raw in salads. Mature chard leaves and stalks are best when cooked or sauteed where their bitterness fades. Swiss chard is high in vitamins A, K and C. It's also rich in minerals, dietary fiber and protein.  Here's a Stir-Fried Swiss Chard and Red Peppers recipe form The New York Times that could only be improved in both taste and nutritional value if you sprinkle some FitFlax™ with Roasted Golden Flax Seed and Chia Seeds on top.

Left out capers and olives (just didn't have them) and it was amazing!  Was delicious fresh out of the pan, but even better after it was room temperature.

The olives make the dish! Did not use capers or sugar, and added sliced chard stems. Delicious. Thank you!

Amazing! I omitted the olives, used basalmic capers, and a dash of white wine at the end. YUMM!

Another delicious way to prepare this awesome veggie! I left out the olives because I didn't have any. I would add a little more brown sugar next time to balance the bitterness of the chard and lemon. I let my onions get really caramelized by leaving them on low heat for about a half an hour.

This was good, but the olives and capers were to much for me. I am going to try this again without them and halve the amount of olive oil.

AMAZING! We used more brown sugar and omitted the olives, but added fresh jalapenos at the end (with the seeds).  I would happily make this dish every night with any dinner, but it was a marvelous side dish with slow cooked whole chicken.  WOW.

This is REALLY good!  I caught myself eating the leftover bits out of the pan with my fingers before I cleaned up the dishes.  The kalamatas; take them or leave them.  I didn't feel they added much flavor or complexity to the recipe.  Also, with the capers and olives, I omitted the salt.

I just made this with honey mustard chicken and it was wonderful! I've never cooked Swiss chard before so this was my first try. I used rainbow chard (instead of just red) and I didn't have a yellow onion so I used a red one instead. I think it will be better with the yellow as indicated so I'm looking forward to cooking this again.  Next time I think I will use a little less lemon, as mine came out a little too lemony with the whole lemon.

Really good! The combination of the lemon, pepper, and salty olives and capers give this dish so much flavor. We used Rainbow Chard, since that's what we had, and it was a beautiful meal. Thanks.

Really good recipe!  I cut back a  little on the capers and olives per other comments, the original recipe would be good but too salty for me.  Some of the stems on my chard were really thick, I cut them off and added to the onions earlier than the leaves.

THIS IS AMAZING!! I had never tried chard before and had some from the farmer's market. I have now made chard 2 times in the last week thanks to this recipe. I increased the sugar and omitted the olives. I also used red onions. Thanks for sharing!

Very good!  Agree it is a little salty, so next time I won't add the full amount.  Also I didn't have kalamata olives so I just used black olives, and they worked just fine. Thanks!!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made it alongside the Apple Cider Sauce and Pork Loin Chops recipe also on this site and some roasted red potatoes. I used red onions and I added a couple of tablespoons of garlic flavored red wine vinegar at the end instead of the olives/capers/lemon, just from personal preference. I agree with another poster that it took about 10 minutes to get the onions properly cooked. It was delicious!

I really love this dish, I made it as stated and it was excellent as a side dish. I then added some cannelinni beans and roasted red pepper for a light lunch and it was perfect. The thing about a recipe like this is you can play around with it and be pretty sure it will be wonderful. Thanks so much for this recipe. Into my favorites for sure.

very yummy. didn't have capers. no one has mentioned that the 1/4 cup of olive really dominated the flavor. It tastes great but could have cut the amount to balance the flavors a bit...

This dish has all the right components but it's reeeeeally salty.  Next time I would use either capers or olives, but not both, and cut the sea salt altogether, or just use one shake of the shaker.

Judging from the other reviews...I am in the minority here as far as rating this recipe goes....I think that it took a good amount of time to get the onions just right...should have eaten them that way...instead of wasting all the other ingredients! Sorry, it tasted way too earthy for our likes!

I really liked this, and so did my husband.  Our kids hated it, but I knew they would, so I didn't waste much of it on them!
I didn't have any olives so I left them out, but otherwise prepared just as instructed.  Next time, I think I'll add some crushed garlic to the onion as it caramelizes, just to deepen the flavor a bit.  Excellent recipe, and a great way to cook swiss chard, which could likely be adapted to spinach, collards, or any leafy green.

I loved this recipe, it was very zesty and salty. Just what I was looking for! I changed the recipe for what I had in the house: I used regular swiss chard, no olives or capers and I added fake chicken strips.

I substituted about 1/2 packet of organic stevia for the brown sugar as I avoid all refined sugar and artificial sweeteners.  I tasted without stevia first and was bitter.  The stevia was just the right touch to take out the bitterness.  Great healthy recipe.  I'll definitely make it again

The dish came out wonderful!  I used 3 1/2 sweet onions and 2 bunches of swiss chard and it was the right amount for my dinner party of 10. I left out the capers and only used half the olives. But what frustrates me about this recipe and other recipes about caramelizing onions is that it DOES NOT TAKE a few minutes. To get a good caramelization, plan on anywhere from 30-40 minutes. Yes, you have to stir it to make sure it doesn't burn but it is so worth it. My guests enjoyed it and I shared the recipe (along with the caramelizing REAL time) with those who asked. But please note that it takes a lot longer than stated to make this yummy.

I made this just as written. It was one of the best vegetable dishes I have ever eaten.  My husband loved it and asked that I make it again soon!

Made this recipe exactly as given.  We liked it very much.  
Very Tasty.  Starting eating Paleo in November and though my husband is not going Paleo, he is eating what I cook for dinner.  
I'm always looking for new recipes.  Thanks.

This is an awesome flavourful recipe. I used fresh beet greens in place of the Swiss chard. We loved it!

This was OK.  I expected more flavor.  I did rinse the capers and olives.  Perhaps I shouldn't have.  I also recommend chopping the olives so the flavor disperses more in the dish.  My husband loved it; my daughter didn't like it at all.  I served it over polenta to which I added some cheese and added a can of garbanzo beans to the dish for protein, making a vegetarian meal out of it.  It is worth trying again and tweaking a bit to add more spice.

My new favorite way to prepare chard.  You can't make this without the capers and/or olives and call it the same dish, though.  Their flavors add so much!

I had never cooked Chard before but we loved this recipe.  The olives and capers along with the sweet onions were great and they are almost always in my pantry.

Fantastic! I did not grow up eating greens in any form, so when they appear in my CSA basket, I search for recipes. This dish is wonderful! I made it per the recipe, no substitutions. My husband and I polished off the entire recipe. We'll have this one again, soon!

Great flavor! My first experience with chard... I didn't have lemon, so I used a lime and no capers, but WOW! This is a delicious side dish I'm saving for when I'm entertaining.

I will give this recipe 3 stars because I didn't follow it to the T, so i can only speak to what it tasted like without the olives (which I didn't have on hand) and capers (which i detest). It was a little too seet and tangy for my taste. My husband felt the same way. Though certainly edible and interesting in flavors, perhaps if I made this again, I would not add as much sugar (just a dash instead of 1 tsp) and less lemon.

I found rainbow chard at the health food store and tried this recipe. It has become my favorite green and I am a vegetarian. I leave the capers and lemon out because of my granddaughter's allergies, but it is fabulous! Of course, I love the red chard as well. I have shared this recipe at the health food store while picking up my chard and it encouraged more to buy some while listening.  It's great!

Yum!!  I tried this when we got a wonderful bunch of red chard in our CSA box, and what a treat!  We ate it over a brown & wild rice mix and it was all we needed for dinner.  Delicious combination of flavors!  Next time I'll cut down a bit on the sea salt, as the kalamata olives and capers add plenty.

I also left the salt out. The olives and capers were plenty for that. But overall super yummy! Will use 2 bunches of Chard next time, as the chard shrinks down a lot, and this wasn't quite enough for 4 people. But soooo good!

This was a nice change from plain steamed greens.  I left out the olives and salt...the capers added plenty for my taste.  I think it would be good with other greens as well.

WOW! This is really flavorful. Let the onions cook for awhile as other recipes have suggested.  I only salt & peppered to taste at the end of the recipe, as I agree that with the capers and olives it could be too salty.

As others suggested I let the onions cook and caramelize really well before adding chard.  I omitted olives since I don't like them.  Entire familly including one of my kids really enjoyed this (the other refused to try it).  Even DH who generally does not like chard ate it, will definitely make again.

This is a very good combination of flavors. I made it with senposai, which is similar to chard but has a bright yellow rib. The amount of sweetness was just right, balancing the tang of the lemon (I used half) and the saltiness of the olives and capers. My only complaint is I didn't have enough greens!

This dish has wonderful flavors and is a great twist on traditional chard preparation.

Delicious! I didn't have any olives, so unfortunately I had to do without. Still wonderful.

i added some minced garlic, and i only had capers, and definitely didn't need added salt.  i never cooked with chard, but had it delivered with a weekly organic produce delivery, and this was really surprisingly yummy.

My boyfriend was a chef and he said this recipe was "excellent." I didn't have the olives but it was still really really great. I'm definitely making this one again!

I wasn't sure what to expect with the sweet onions and the tangy olives ... but I loved it!  Yum!  I didn't add the salt as the previous reviewers suggested... perfect sweet salty.

I made this dish with Rainbow Chard and Spanish olives.  Based on the other reviews, I skipped the salt.  It came out great and received raves from my sweetie - given that he worked in the restaurant industry for 20 years, that's some accomplishment.  :-)
