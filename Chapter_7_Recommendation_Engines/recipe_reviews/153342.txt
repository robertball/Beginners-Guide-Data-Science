This is so yummy!!  Use sugar free jello and light or fat free cool whip so it's not so bad.  Very good.  Everyone loved.  Will be making again soon.

This was just okay. It had a slight chemical flavor. I think it might have been from the gelatin I had. It was a generic brand. Might try again with Jello brand. I made my crust with the graham cracker crust recipe from this site.

The Jello did not thicken with the ice. After the original ice melted I added more to see if it would thicken and it did not. It wouldn't even set up in the freezer.
