This is a great tasting sandwich!  The mushrooms and spinach really only need 1 tsp. of oil to cook in; the bread need only be buttered with 1 tsp. butter.  Next time, I'll grill the mushrooms, and just put in fresh baby spinach.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were okay, I didn't use spinach, since mine was too far gone to use. We all liked it but think some Colby-Jack or provolone cheese would taste better, Swiss is very mild for a grilled cheese, but the added mushrooms are great. I sauteed mine in butter and garlic. Went great with our Greek Pasta Salad by Danielle on AR.

Great sandwich and easy to adjust to individual tastes.  I used more mushrooms and a bit less oil and butter.  Delicious!

This was really good. I didn't have swiss so I used mozzarella instead. Next time I will try adding garlic to the mushroom and spinach.

This was a nice and simple sandwich and great for those who love grilled cheese. I added in some garlic salt to the spinach and mushrooms for some extra flavor and I didn't have swiss so I used monterey jack and it still turned out delicious!

Yum.  instead of cooking the mushrooms in oil cook them with hot sauce just make sure the heat isnt to high other wise the sauce will just burn to the pan.  it will still stick a little to the pan on medium heat just scrape it off as you go.

Delicious and easy to make. A nice twist on a classic. I used Havarti cheese because I don't really care for Swiss, and it was delicious. Thanks!

I enjoyed your recipe. My variation 95% lean burger seasoned lightly with McCormicks Steak Seasoning. Use fresh mushrooms. I used Teriyaki Sauce instead of Soy. It is sweeter and you don't have to worry about salty flavor.

Just made for lunch and it was yummy. I used rye bread which worked really well and I used baby Swiss.  While sauteing the mushrooms and spinach I did add just a little extra since they shrunk up a bit and my bread slices were larger than normal. A little sprinkle of garlic salt to the saute was nice also.****Made again and this time I used big baby bellas and wheat bread, still a great sandwich.

Followed other reviews and added some chopped garlic to the mushrooms.  Had a bag of frozen chopped spinach in the freezer so I took a handful and added to the mushroom/garlic saute.  I had monterey jack cheese to use and it melted very nicely.  Excellent meatless meal, everyone loved it!

Very yummy!  I didn't have any spinach but will use it next time.  I added some sliced onions to the mushrooms and used provolone instead of Swiss because I don't like Swiss.  A little on the messy side but well worth it.
