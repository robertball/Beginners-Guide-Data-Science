Had to give this 5 stars because I loved them but had to make a few changes.  First change was the crust...I mixed all the ingredients and it was not a consistency for rolling into balls so added another egg and some water.  I then baked the crusts for 10 minutes which seemed too long when I took them out of the oven...they got very crunchy but after having the filling in them softened up a little.  Next time I will check them after 5 minutes.  The coconut filling is awesome!  After reading the other review about the chocolate topping not setting up I decided to add less milk to the mixture, next time I will double the amount of chocolate topping because I had to make more.  With all that said these were awesome! Everyone loved them and their were many request for the recipe.  Thank You, Patty!

Used them for my son's  catering business.  Everyone really enjoyed them. I did as was suggested and added another egg to the cake batter and only used 2 tablespoons of milk in the frosting.  Also after baking cups for 7 minutes, I thumbprinted the cups and baked another 2 minutes.  They were perfect for the filling.  I didn't spread the frosting all the way to the outside.  They looked prettier.

These were fabulous! Like the other reviewers suggested, I def recommend adding the extra egg to the fudge cake batter, cutting back on the milk in the chocolate topping, and pressing your thumb in the cups while taking them out of the oven.  Also, bc not everyone in my family likes coconut, I substituted graham crackers for coconut in half the marshmellow mix, keeping the rest of the recipe the same...they turned out like little s'more cups.  These were gobbled up so quick I had to make more for the true event!!

These were very good.  I followed the suggestions of others and baked for about 7 minutes, added an extra egg to the cake batter, and used 1/8 c. evap milk for frosting.  Also pressed my thumb in shells when removing from oven.  Will make these again!

This recipe is SO good!  It was worh the time it takes!  One note... I pressed my thumb in the batter in each muffin as I was taking it out of the oven so I had plenty of space for the filling.  The only prob. I had was the topping.  It didn't harden well and remains tacky to you can't stack the sweets, but who cares!  They get eaten too fast!  TKS for a great recipe!

This tastes very much like the candy bar it is named after. I needed to make another half batch of the chocolate topping. Made 36 in mini-muffin tins and an 8 x 8-inch dish that I cut into bars.  Next time I will put a whole almond on top of each piece. Very rich dessery.

This recipe was very time consuming, and only made half of the listed servings. When I took the lined mini muffin tins out of the oven, the dough had risen so there was little room to put the coconut filling. Then after topping them I waited 4 hours for the chocolate almond mixture to harden up so I could store them, and it never happened. I was very dissapointed, and could not leave them not touching one another so I had to throw them out. (after spending over 1.5 hours in prep time.) Sigh!

I've made these twice, and the second time I think I got it right.  Why add a second egg?  Just cut the flour down to 1/4 cup, and it's the perfect consistency.  I used paper liners, but just rolled the balls and dropped them into the liners.  Also Ladies, to address the comments about only getting X amount of treats, remember we're talking inches in female mentality.  An inch is an inch, and I got 52-60 treats.  I baked them for 9 minutes, but oven temps vary.  Dido on pressing a thumbprint after they come out of the oven.  I did let them cool for a few minutes before carefully taking them out of the muffin tin to let them firm up a bit.  That way it frees up the tins for a second batch, since I only have two tins.  They're a bit time consuming, but worth it!

I had a few issues putting this recipe together.  The end result gets 4 stars, but the preparation gets a 2.  First, when the little cakes bake, they pretty much fill the entire muffin opening.  And if you don't push them back down immediately after they come out of the oven, they get hardened like that very quickly.  I followed the instructions of keeping the filling warm to fill the chocolate molds, and if you don't, it begins to separate and the coconut falls to the bottom.  At this point in the recipe, it should tell you to chill the cups before adding the chocolate topping.  I added the chocolate on top of the warm filling and it just ran all over the pan, making a huge mess.  After doing 3 cups, I stopped, put the pan in the fridge and chilled for about 30 minutes.  Then I came back to a slightly thickened chocolate glaze and added it onto the chilled coconut filling.  This worked much better.  In the end, the chocolate cups were kind of hard and crumbly, and the filling is extremely sweet.  But after my changes, they did turn out very pretty with some sliced almonds on top.  Too many steps, too much work, and not a great finished product.

I was a little skeptical at first, seeing the picture, but I won the baking contest at my church with these! It received top marks in taste, and almost everyone asked for the recipe!

These were awesome. We did as previous reviewers suggested - added an extra egg to the crust batter, and doubled the chocolate topping (using less evaporated milk, 4 tablespoons total). We got 36 cups out of the recipe. They are REALLY good, rich, tasty little treats. Time consuming yet so easy. I know we'll be making these again.

Really enjoyed these . I also added an extra egg to the cake mix and used a 10x10 square pan to bake them in because I don't own the mini cup pans. I also used 2 tbls milk in the topping as suggested. Rich and delicious. Will make again.

These were AMAZING. I also added an extra egg like other reviewers suggested. Also, I used regular muffin tins instead of mini-muffins and it was fine. I baked them for 10 min, although you could probably do them ~2 min longer, but I liked the fudgy consistency.

I followed the recipe as written, but didn't have chocolate cake mix, so I used brownie mix instead. It still turned out delicious. I placed the cups in the refrigerator to harden. As mentioned, I also did not get the amount indicated in the recipe. I only got 36 out of the recipe. Brought these to a party and everyone raved!

WOW! These are awesome! I used a mini marshmallows as I had on hand, and used the extra egg as suggested. I ended up having to make a well in these cups once out of the oven, they were a little messy to make. I used a mini muffin pan and had some left over so I used a couple of ramekins. Will def be making these again!

Very disappointing, especially since I love almonds, coconut, and chocolate! The cookie part of the recipe was way too dry to form into balls. It took an extremely long time trying to press crumbs into my pan. Then I read a few reviews and added another egg to the mix. The filling was delicious. Tasted just like Almond Joy! I had to guess at the marshmallows though since I only had the mini size. I made the topping as stated which also ended up being very time consuming since once the almonds are mixed in, they make it harder to spread on the tops. I cooked the cookies for only half the time pressing them down immediately after removing from the oven. Overall the taste was good but not as yummy as I was anticipating. I was very disappointed after all the time I spent making these cookies. I may try it again making them like a bar cookie. It won't be soon though. :(

The taste of these cupcakes was good but we didn't care for the texture.  The crust was not cakey like we thought it should be, but sugary and crumbly-kind of hard.

These were deeee-licious! I took all the suggested tips and these came out perfect. Instead of pressing my finger into the cups to make an indent, I use a shot glass...works great. Thanks!

Good, a little salty for some reason, but if you like the Almond Joy candy bar, and we do, then its worth trying!!!
