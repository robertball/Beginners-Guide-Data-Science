I added a little mayo, it was a little too gritty without it, next time I will have more limes on hand and think double that so I don't have to add the fat next time, the flavor was good

We like hot and spicy but I agree with the other reviewers it is way too hot with a tablespoon of cayenne and two tablespoons of cumin. I like the concept so we plan to make it again but start with a small fraction of the spices and work up from there.

This was a great recipe as a side for fish tacos.  Since my 9 yr old was going to be eating this, I cut down the cayenne to a sprinkling and I didn't have the almonds on hand.  I followed everything else as is and I wouldn't change a thing when making this again.  We really liked the tanginess of the slaw and is a lot healthier without the mayo.

A Tbsp of cayenne for 4 servings...really??  We’re about middle of the road on “heat/spiciness,” I cut the cayenne substantially, and it still had plenty of heat.  Other than cutting back the cayenne, I followed the directions to the letter, and the dressing emulsified into a paste.  I tried thinning it out with more lime juice, then it ended up too tart, so I added some sugar, and then even added a little water to get it to the right dressing consistency.  Too much tweaking here.   Yes, it does have a Southwestern flavor, but the cumin ends up dominating (I'd cut that in half), and as mentioned earlier, you better like your food REALLY spicy for this recipe.  Finally, it just doesn’t have a whole lot of eye appeal.  Sorry, just didn’t work for us.
