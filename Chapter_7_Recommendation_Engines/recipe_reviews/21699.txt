Absolutely wonderful.  Served with Chicken Tortilla Soup and Southwestern Egg Rolls as a starter for a casual dinner party.  Assembled the quesadillas and baked half per the recipe and then pan fried half.  NOTE:  to keep the ingredients from oozing out, fold the quesadilla in half taco style ~ when finished cooking, let the quesadilla "set" for 1 or 2 minutes, then use a pizza cutter to divide into triangles.  Didn't tell the group which was which and they voted hands down for the pan fried, which I actually preferred too....  Doubled the cheese and used a mix of Cheddar, Monterey Jack and Pepper Jack cheese with the carmelized onion and BBQ chicken.  Wonderful!

Yum, Yum!  The barbecue sauce does a lot for the quesadillas and gives it a real kick.  My sautéed onions turned out a little burnt, but they still tasted great.  (Sometimes things taste better burnt!)  I savored every bite, especially when I got a chunk of onion!!  It's like they were carmelized by the honey.  The only thing I would change is the cooking time in the oven.  It only took 5 minutes for the cheese to melt and for the tortilla to start turning crisp.

I wanted to like this, I really did, but the taste and texture of the BBQ sauce in a quesadilla just wasn't my liking.  I probably will not make this again; however, if you really enjoy BBQ sauce and don't think you'll mind the gooey texture then go for it!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and recommend doubling the amount of cheese.

Great idea recipe but I've made it a bit easier and quicker. Used leftover cooked chicken, chopped, and one jalapeno pepper,finely chopped. Mixed that with enough BQQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's) to coat. Spread enough of that mixture to cover one half of a large tortilla. Sprinkle with some Monteray/Cheddar cheeses and fold over. Cook in a skillet sprayed with cooking spray. Spray top side of tortilla while bottom cooks and flip when brown. Brown bottom side and serve topped with chopped green onions!

Outstanding! These were absolutely wonderful and delicious. I prepared the recipe just exactly as mentioned. No problems at all and the results were out of this world. Someone commented on the BBQ sauce, etc...THESE ARE TITLED "TEXAS CHICKEN QUESADILLAS", Texas=BBQ!! Anyone who might be wondering, give them a try just like the recipe calls for. You won't be sorry.

Thanks Michelle

AWESOME!!!  The caramelized onions is the key to really making these taste great!  I was out of bottled bbq sauce so I found 2 recipes to try on this site.  The "Carolina low carb bbq sauce" and "Dave's bbq sauce".  Since this recipe  was called "Texas" quesadillas, I figured the bbq sauce had to be a red, sweet sauce.  I baked covered in the oven the first 10 minutes for a slightly softer quesadilla.  I liked the red bbq sauce but LOVED, LOVED the "Carolina low card bbq sauce (a savory sweet yellow mustard) on these!!!  I will definitely make this recipe again and again!

What a great, unique idea! On paper, this recipe didn't sound to amazing but these were a pleasant surprise!! They were so popular that I had to make a second batch to follow the first. The first time, I followed the recipe to the letter. The second time, I added more chicken - skipped the onion saute part and did the "taco" thing (I agree with the former reviewer = less oozey and were easier to cut). BUT on the second batch, I did add some minced green onions. Both times great! Thanks Michelle for this one!

These quesadillas came out great!  I did have to make some modifications though--I doubled the amount of cheese that the recipie called for and halved the onion and the baking time.

These are delicious.  Please do not be put off by the use of barbeque sauce:  it and the caramelized onions are what make the recipe great.   A local restaurant makes a great variation of these -- they add a little sauteed spinach and mushrooms as well.    I agree that you want to watch the time in the oven -- 20 minutes is too long.    You can also cook these in a skillet if you are in a hurry; I brush a tiny bit of olive oil on the bottom of the quesadilla and have them heated in less than five minutes.

a tasty barbeque version of a mexican favorite. It was so easy to make and turned out very nicely. I used three chicken breasts instead of two for more meat. Great recipe.

I had some tortillas to use up and some chicken.  This was surprisingly good for being so simple.  The caramelized onions did the trick.  I did not add honey to the onions - no need to.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's honey bbq sauce.  I did them in my grill pan.  Simple and very good.  Thanks Michelle!

These were quick and delicious.  We made them on low-fat wheat tortillas with reduced fat shredded cheese.  My husband liked them, so I will definitely make them again!

These were very good.  My family and I agreed that these reminded us of the California Pizza Kitchen barbecued chicken pizza.  Mum liked these because they weren't spicy at all.  I'll probably make these again and when I do, I'll throw a couple of chipotles or jalapenos into the mixture to spice it up for those who like it that way.

Really good.  Did make some changes.  Used two roasted chicken breasts from the deli and skipped the barbecue sauce.  Brushed the tortillas with taco sauce before putting chicken, onion and cheeses on top.  The cooked onions in this were spectacular and really elevated this dish to something special.  My husband and I both LOVED these quesadillas.  Will certainly make again!

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this recipe til now! I've been using it for awhile, and it was a definite hit with the entire family. We add red or yellow bell peppers in with the onions, and make them on whole wheat tortillas, and serve with sour cream, refried beans, and salsa. One quesadilla makes for a filling meal! My sister always requests I make them when I visit home.

Excellent! The carmelized onions gave them a different taste. I cut the chicken into small pieces which made them easier to handle.  I also sprayed the tortillas with pam and cooked them on a griddle on the stovetop.

Although this recipe is in the Appetizer 
category, I serve mine as a main course for 4 with the original recipe. Easy way to have dinner on the table in minutes.  Round it out with a green or avocado salad.  Perhaps flan for dessert?   MMMMMMMMMMM Thanks, Michelle

This recipe was great!  Thank you!  I am not a cook at all so I rely on these recipes... for the most part I followed the directions (I didn't do exact measurements and so forth) but I used the exact ingredients.  We loved them!  No changes needed!!

We loved these!!  The barbeque sauce and cheese taste great together.  Husband asked me to add them to the dinner rotation :)
Changes:  Used 3 chicken breasts instead of two, husband likes lots of chicken.  I ran out of tortillas, so the last one I just folded in half.  I think that actually works better (taco style) instead of the regular way (quesadilla style), the cheese oozes less.
Very yummy, thanks Michelle!

These quesadillas were delicious!!  However, since I don't like honey, I just sauteed the onions in equal amounts of oil and butter (1/2 Tbsp. oil & 1/2 Tbsp. butter) and left it at that.  One other tip...if you use thin tortillas like I did, you might need to check them at around 10-12 minutes.  I baked mine for 15 minutes, and the quesadillas were almost too crispy.  Anyways...great recipe!!  I'll use it for many years to come!!

These were very good! The only thing I wold have left out was the honey.. It made them a little too sweet. I also did what another reviewer suggested and added half ingredients on half of a tortilla, then folded it over and put them on a baking sheet in the oven for about 20 mins at 350degrees. Came out nice and crisp. Very simple and tasty! My family ate them up!

This was pretty good - my teenagers and toddler really liked it.  I agree that it is probably better for an appetizer rather than a main course unless you're making it for lunch.  The only thing I would say is make sure you use a BBQ sauce that you like the taste of on it's own - as the flavor is quite prominient in this dish.  Next time rather than measuring out the BBQ sauce, I'm just going to squirt some in until it is just barely coated, so it doesn't take away from the wonderful flavor of the onions.  Hubby and I thought the onions were awesome so I'm doubling that part next time!  Also, I sliced my chicken breast a little too thick so it didn't go as far on the quesadillas...made them nice and meaty but I needed to cook more breasts to make up for it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Since I submitted this recipe there have been several great suggestions from reviewers on how to make these even better and I would love to share them with you.  The oven baking is out!!! Grilling in a pan on the stove turns out crispy and delicious quesadillas.  If you wet one side of each tortilla with water, pile the ingredients on the dry side and then place wet side down in a hot pan, the tortilla forms a deliciously crispy crust.  Just grill until the bottom is nice and golden and crusty (make sure the top tortilla has been dampened with the water before flipping the quesadilla over!!). Also, I've found a shortcut with the chicken that has been a huge time saver.  I use Lloyd's Barbecue Chicken which comes in a tub.  The chicken is shredded which is perfect for the quesadillas and the sauce it comes in is quite tasty.  Now the only prep work is making the onions (which I do like very sweet, but if you don't then definitely cut back on the sugar!!).  Enjoy!!!

This recipe was a nice change from regular chicken quesadillas. It was especially a hit at my house because my husband is pretty picky but he'll eat almost anything with barbeque sauce on it!!! Easy, quick and tasty meal idea!

These were very good and crispy -- I made them for lunch on Father's Day.  I didn't have any honey so I just used plain onions.  Maybe that's why I felt that something was missing with the flavor.  Will have to try these again made the right way.  Thanks for sharing! 
Update: Have made this with the caramelized onions many times now and the honey really does add a lot to the flavor.  Love it!

This was a good alternative to traditional mexican quesadillas.  The onions were yummy! Although I would have liked them to be spicier, I will make them again but add seasoning while cooking the chicken.

This although it was fun to make...was just terrible!  They were sweet!  The BQ sauce was a cheap shot!  Instead of using real seasonings they just slapped on some BQ.  It sounded yummy and quick but was certainly not worth it!!

Yum, yum, yummy!!!!! These were sooooo good! My husband wasn't a fan of the caramelized onions, but he can be picky sometimes lol. :) Our neighbors gifted us with a quesadilla maker for Christmas. I don't make quesadillas often, but when I do, I struggle with flipping them (all of my filling ingredients ooze out!). Using a quesadilla press made cooking these a breeze! As with any new recipe I try, I made a few changes. My changes were completely unnecessary, but even so, really took these over the top IMHO. Instead of using sharp cheddar / Monterey-Jack cheeses, I subbed a Sargento 4-State cheddar blend and smoked gouda instead. Since my local grocer sells three chicken breasts per package, I upped the amount of meat accordingly. I also added a touch of chopped cilantro to each quesadilla. My BBQ sauce of choice was Kraft (original) Bull's-Eye. And, because the manufacturer recommends 10 in. tortillas, that's what I used. My neighbor and I ended up splitting a single quesadilla and my hubs made an entire one himself. We had enough leftover chicken filling to make a quesadilla (to share) for lunch the next day and I'll be able to make myself one for lunch this week, so the amount of servings is SPOT on (this makes 4 LARGE quesadillas). Guacamole, pico de gallo and sour cream were perfect garnishes. Chips, salsa and margaritas completed our delicious meal. Thanks SO much for sharing your unique recipe, Michelle! We absolutely LOVED it. :-)

Had left over chicken & tortilla shells from some Chicken Enchiladas I had made so thought I would make these for an easy dinner a few nights later.  My kids LOVED them and SO EASY too!  My chicken was already cooked...so just added bbq sauce and warmed.  Made these on my panni maker instead of baking.   On mine I did not add cheese and used a whole wheat tortilla and it was still very yummy.

SOOOOOOO GOOD!! Thank you! I only used sharp cheddar cheese didn't have the other, and didn't measure it just sliced pieces off. Also used KC masterpiece BBQ sauce . And I basically cooked the chicken with everything else and simmered for awhile in the BBQ sauce. Hubby can't wait till I make again!

This recipe made me a happy girl.  The carmalized onion was TO DIE FOR!  The only thing I did differently was I fried the tortillas in oil before baking and I let the chicken "stew" in the BBQ sauce for fifteen minutes.  I brought the leftovers into work and you have 4 other fans, now!

These were pretty easy and good.  My 9-yr old son really liked them.  I would suggest that you slice the chicken breast really thin or even shred it.  And the cooking time in the oven is way too long - I only left mine in for 5-7 minutes.

With just a bit of tweaking as to amount to put inside the quesadilla, these were perfect in my new quesadilla baker. We loved this recipe, although I was skeptical about the barbeque sauce.Very good, Michelle.

Tasty, but can be accomplished on the stove top instead of baking in the oven.  Had a bit of trouble with the onions cut as suggested.

These were really good! They took less that 20 minutes to bake though, probably only 10 or so.  I agree the caramilized onions are what make it really yummy! My 4 year old ate a whole big quesadilla (he doesn't eat, so this is good!)

ok, but the filling was kind of sweet, and husband and I both agreed that we like our quesadillas fried, not baked.  I would make again, but would probably work on the filling, leaving out the honey, and spray the top  tortilla with cooking spray to get it to crisp up a little.

My family and I loved this recipe, although I did end up having to change it up a bit. I would suggest adding more cheese and chicken to the quesadillas. I did this and it tasted much better. I also added a little more seasoning to the chicken while I was cooking it. The barbeque sauce helped tremendously, but the blandness of the tortillas kind of took away from the strong tangy bbq taste. We also put some bbq sauce on the side for dipping... it was a major hit for my whole family.. even my young kids.. that's hard to come by nowadays. :o) Happy cooking!

This got a two thumbs up from my kids, which equals 5 stars!  Instead of baking in the oven for 20 mins, I just turned the broiler on low, threw them in for about 4 mins, flipped over for 3 more mins.  Served with sour cream.

The taste was okay but the tortillas seemed to get in the way. This would be better if it were in a hoagie roll. I wouldn't bother making this again. It's average at best.

I loved these! I cooked the chicken and shredded it beforehand instead of cooking it as per the instructions, but the flavor was wonderful and it crisped up nicely in the oven.  I served it with sour cream. Fantastic!

We made these for dinner last night and they were amazing! I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical at first. It didn't seem right to be making a Mexican inspired meal without adding any spices to the chicken. But I was wrong! We used Sweet Baby Rays Original BBQ sauce. It added a nice tangy flavor which along with the sweetness from the onions and the saltiness of the cheese created the perfect dish! Next time I may flip them over half way through to get a little bit of crispness to both sides of the quesadillas. All in all this was a great, quick, easy, and delicious dinner. We served it with pinto beans and cilantro lime rice.

To die for!  I used cooked shredded chicken.  I added red pepper with the onions.  The family suggested that next time I should chop the onions/peppers.  I also brushed the outside of the tortillas with melted butter before baking.  My husband wanted to know if they were hard to make because he plans to ask for them often!  Taste great with steak too!

Really good! Will definitely make again. Just a suggestion, if you use a sweet BBQ sauce, no honey is needed.

This was really easy to make, that's always a plus.  I would recommend cooking the chicken breast whole, then slicing after it is cooled to keep it juicy.  Also, I just made the quesadillas in the skillet with a touch of oil.  It makes a nice golden brown quesadilla.  Heat the skillet with a touch of oil, meanwhile, top half of a tortilla with 1/8 of the chicken filling and it's portion of the cheese.  When oil is hot, lay the filled tortilla into the skillet and immediately fold empty half of tortilla over filled half, hold in place with a spatula for about 20 seconds.  Brown tortilla on each side for about 2 minutes or until golden brown.  Also, I noticed some reviewers did not care for the barbecue sauce.  I would caution the use of a sweet sauce, because the onions already have a nice sweetness with the honey.  Use a more savory sauce. I used Famous Dave's Rich & Sassy.

Hmmmm.... Kinda like a McRib on a tortilla. :)  Just gave this one a try last night! Was looking for something different than my usual dishes. And, this one definitely did the trick! Scrumptious. I used my boyfriend's fave Montgomery Inn BBQ sauce and he gobbled 'em up! I followed the recipe as recommended for the most part. However, I did fold my quesadillas in half and then cut the finished product into triangles as someone else had recommended to avoid making a mess and because the 10" tortillas seemed huge. Only used 3 of the shells for a dinner for 2. Had enough chicken and onions for 4. I'm pretty generous with filling the shells. And, I par-baked mine per se. Assembled and fried them for a few minutes stovetop then I put them in the oven to ensure the cheese melted fully and that the chicken was hot after sitting out while I assembled the quesadillas. The caramelized onions were indeed a nice touch. Didn't know how to get that flavor until trying this recipe. Now, I'm feeling like a real chef. ;)

These are amazing.  The carmelized onions make the recipe.  I did these is a skillet as it was quicker and easier than using the oven method.  I also cheated and used a store bought rotisseri chicken.  Added some jalepeno & mushrooms while the onions were finishing up.  Even without my additions I think the recipe would have been great.  Can't wait to make these again....YUM!

Had some leftover shredded chicken to get rid of and this was a great way to use it up. Didn't use the honey (thought it might be too sweet with the BBQ sauce) and used up some leftover black beans. Delicious!  So glad I found this - was afraid we were going to have to throw away that chicken cause we couldn't think of something to do with it.

Delicious!  I knew my family would love this dish, and they did.  It is very easy to make, especially if you have leftover or rotisserie chicken.  The flavors blended well together.  I served with lettuce, tomatoes, salsa and Spanish rice.  I did change the baking method.  I used a dry griddle and heated until it was nice and brown, flipped and continued until the underneath side was done.

This recipes is pretty darn good. My man thought it was even better. The only thing I'd change is adding a little more cheese and baking it a little longer for a crispier result. Baking it in the oven browned the top nicely but the bottom was a little underdone. I also sauteed some fresh minced garlic in with the chicken, very yummy. And instead of using green onions as a garnish I went with cilantro. This is a VERY man friendly recipe!

I didn't think this quesadilla, overall, had a lot of flavor. I think it would be much better with added peppers or serving this with guacomole etc. I cooked the onions on medium and they were perfect. I may even try them on a different recipe. To save time I used rotisserie chicken. I covered the quesadillas for the first 10 minutes with a sprayed sheet of foil, and I am glad I did because the edges still got quite crispy. I would definitely consider added condiments, to go with this, for added flavor and texture.

This was a complete hit with my friends
the only thing I changed was that instead of adding the honey to the onions, I just used a honey barbeque sauce
I would really recommend it for any occasion!

Mmm, this is a keeper!  I am rating it 5 stars since I think it's probably amazing as is, but I'll also tell you what I did.  First of all, I only had one leftover breast shredded, so that's what I used.  I followed the directions for the onions exactly and they were amazing (and we aren't onion fans).  When I added the chicken and bbq sauce, I also added a whole sliced green pepper and cut up mushrooms along with some bacon bits and chopped black olives.  At some point I added about a 1/4 cup of salsa.  Then I finished as the directions stated.  Even with only one ckn breast, I still ended up with 4 full quesadillas (8 tortillas).  My husband LOVED these.  He just ate some and had to go cut the grass before dark and asked me to keep them warm so he can have more when he gets done!

WOW! This was honestly amazing. Although I love barbeque sauce, I just didn't feel like it, so I didn't add it. I also added garlic.. so they were "Honey Garlic Quesadillas". I also used leftover chicken, and just cooked it a little along with everything else in the pan. It was so easy and they turned out great. I will definitely make them again.

This recipe is delicious.  I used shredded chicken that was leftover from a whole fryer. I followed the recipe, but added a some brown sugar to the bbq sauce I had to give it a sweeter taste.  I then cooked the tortillas on a skillet instead of the oven just because I didn't have a lot of time.  Fabulous recipe.  I will continue to use this one in our home!

Great, but not spicy enough for my Texas taste.  Instead of using an onion, I used a red onion.  After the onions were finished, I sliced one jalapeno and and mixed it into the onions, slowly cooking it.  I also used a spicy bbq sauce.  Great recipe and easy to customize to your own liking.  I'm a college student and this is also a very easy recipe for me.  Thanks for posting it.  I'm sure I'll be cooking it in the future ;)

This was so good! I baked and then shedded my chicken ahead of time then added it to the onions and honey. I also brush the tortilla lightly w/ evoo before baking. My whole family loved it! We added lettuce, salsa and sour cream for toppings. We will make this again and again.

These were really good.  This was the first time my daughter who's 3 tried quesadillas and this was obviously the recipe to go with as she ate them right up.  I went a little easier on the bbq sauce and used some pre-grilled chicken that I had leftover.  I added some bell pepper and mushrooms to the skillet with the bbq sauce to get a few more veggies into it. I'll definitely make these again.  Thanks.

This was so good! I reduced the recipe for 1 serving and grilled the chicken on my George Forman grill, then sliced it. Cooked the onions as suggested accept I used cooking spray in place of the olive oil. Mixed the bbq sauce (Sweet Baby Rays) w/ the chicken in a bowl then layered as directed on tthe tortilla that I cut in half. Then, I grilled the whole thing lightly on my foreman again (sprayed w/ cooking spray). OH! It was so good! And only 5 points for weight watchers! Will be making again and again!

Was hesitant to try this because I was worried that the BBQ Sauce might be too strong. I shouldn't have worried as both my hubby and I loved this! I guess it really depends on the BBQ sauce used if it's too overpowering or not. We did it the lazy way and microwaved the quesadillas to melt the cheese. Yum!

This is a good recipe.  I made halve the recipe and barely had any BBQ sauce left but I managed to squeeze enough out of the bottle to at least get a light coating on all the chicken.  My husband thought it was good.

Very good! I did all this ahead of time, then layered tortillas  just 1/2 before eating. Popped into preheated oven and served with salsa. Yum!  Oh, yeah, I didn't have flour tortillas so I used corn ones.

These turned out great. I made two separate batches, one for the wife and one for the kids. For the kids, I left out the onions and baked them as suggested. For the wife I  used the onions and then fried them in a teaspoon of olive oil. The honey sauteed onions are a plus, as is frying.

Replaced BBQ with ranch salsa.  Liked the way of cooking the quesadilla. Nothing inspiring, but a nice quick meal if you have pre-cooked chicken.

This was excellent, especially the onions.  My husband and I usually don't put onions in things, but it made the dish.  They were so sweet and delicious.  I grilled the chicken things in BBQ sauce, then I grilled the quesadillas instead of baking them.  I will make again....and very soon too.

Yum-O! Glad I've found another "something different" recipe to add to the rotation.  I added some bacon I had on hand that I crumbled up, and used the stove top instead of baking them.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet & Spicy too (like another reviewer suggested) and highly recommend that brand of sauce.

These were great.  All the flavors blended together perfectly.  We love quesadillas, and barbeque chicken.  Putting them together was great idea.  I am asked to make them at least twice a month.

We were disappointed. Not a lot of flavor, really lost the honey taste. We've had better quesadillas.

We LOVED this. It kind of reminded us of BBQ Chicken pizza. We omitted the onions, used a hot and spicy bbq sauce, and added some hot and spicy cheese to the cheddar. We also mixed some cooked and crumbled real bacon into the chicken mixture. We cooked a breast half per quesadilla. Will do this again.

I halved the recipe, and found that there was no way near enough chicken/onion/bbq for half the amount of tortillas. This annoyed me as there was no time to defrost more chicken. The quesadillas themselves tasted pretty good, but there needed to be much more filling. Also, next time I make them, I will add a little cilantro to the mix. Tip: use a pizza cutter to cut them up.

These were great!  I served them to some friends who came over to watch football, and they loved them!  I served them with sour cream and pico de gallo from another recipe on this website.  They were a little messy and had to be eaten with a fork, but that's probably because I cheated and used the Lloyd's BBQ chicken in a tub.  I also ditched the oven method and heated them on the stove and they turned out perfect!  I will definitely be making these again!

Got rave reviews from DH and friends tonight. I took Michelle's suggestion about cooking them on the stovetop, and they came out great!! The only thing I did different is putting the chicken in the slow cooker with the bbq sauce for about 5 hours instead of cooking on the stove. The meat was really easy to shred. Will definitely be making this again. Would be really fun to play around with this and try different ingredients, but is great as is!!

Get the George Foreman grill out for these sweet ones! These turned out SO good tonight!!! I cut already thinned chicken breasts into strips and then in half to cook. The bbq sauce was Famous Daves. These are very sweet and oh so yummy. I used 6" flour tortillas and made them in the George Foreman grill rather than layering and baking them. After cooking everything, I just filled each tortilla with chicken, onions, and cheeses and grilled them. We dipped them in salsa and sour cream.

Really delicious.  My oven is calibrated so it was exactly 350 degrees, but I'm glad I checked after 10 minutes because any longer and they would have burned.  Aside from that, very good.  A nice change from the usual (slap some meat and cheese between tortillas, microwave to melt and broil to crisp).

My husband and I liked this dish, I did change it just a bit by not using the bbq sauce and I added roasted peppers and mexican spice powder to the grilling of the chicken.  But it was a great starting point and will be making it again.

The bottom of the quesadilla was soggy and the top was crispy. That made a mess when my family tried to eat. Next time I will definitely try the recommendation to pan fry.

This was a hit!! We ate them watching the World Series game 7 and they received rave reviews. All I did differently was butter the outsides of the tortillas- I suppose that softens them. Will try without next time. I added some green chiles to the barbeque chicken mix. The honey onions were a beautiful yummy addition!  We liked adding extra salsa or cholula and sour cream on top.

Made this twice since saving it a couple weeks ago!  I added red and green peppers with the onions.  Made some with steak and did a combo with the steak and chicken.  Big hit with my Mom and daughter.  Will make again and again ... especially when we have extra tortilla shells that need to be used up.

I made this recipe several times, it’s a hit! I just put less BBQ sauce (less then half) and replace it with tomato sauce/thick juice. The BBQ sauce gave a strong taste to the meat so next time I put some BBQ sauce, some tomato juice, mix it, taste it, and adjusted to my taste, plus salt and pepper.

This was great! I used Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. These could've used a bit more filling, but wouldn't change them. The only thing else I might do differently is pan fry the tortillas instead of baking them, but this way certainly is healthier...Made this again and pan fried them. Too much work for the amount of mouths to feed here, but worth it if it's for two people or so. I used a different BBQ sauce from Wegmans and really disliked it, so the sauce makes a huge difference.

Good stuff!  Such a simple recipe and so delicious!  I made a double batch and did the first batch with Sweet Baby Ray's Chipotle BBQ and the second with their Honey BBQ.  Both were delicious, but the Chipotle was the perfect match.  I used Quesadilla cheese and added black beans, green onion, and fresh cilantro and the flavor combination was spectacular!  Thank you for an awesome recipe!

I really loved these.  Cooked 2 for me, but only ate 1.  Leftover reheated beautifully next day.  Super easy.  My husband ate it, but said it wasn't his favorite.  He is not a big bbq or Mexican food lover anyway.  Easy weeknight dinner.

This recipe turned out really great. I used kraft barbecue sauce, and I think I could go with a more full bodied barbecue sauce like Williamson Brothers. I cooked my chicken in the crock pot so it could be shredded,  and it just fell apart while mixing in with the onions. I still fried it on the stove, but I would like to try baking it next time. I will definitely try this again instead of always making quesadillas with taco seasoning.

A great way to use up leftover BBQ chicken.  I used less sauce than it called for and it was perfect.  Yummy onions.

I made it pretty much word for word as the recipe stated. My only addition was adding the glazed onions to the mixture as well as black olives. Definitely saving to Favorites.... husband wants it added to our regular lineup of good eats.  :)

We used left over chicken breast and a quesadilla maker instead of the oven, but followed the rest of the directions as noted, and it was really good.  The honey was a nice touch too  I even thought these would make cute little appetizers for a party.  In any event, thank you for sharing, I will definitely be making  this recipe again :-)

Very good.  I preboiled my chicken breasts in broth and spices.  Added chopped tomatoes, & green onions. Try adding some taco seasoning to spice it up a bit.   I folded in half and fried in frying pan.  2nd time I made this, put on ungreased baking sheet in oven until cheese melted. Worked better and less fat.

Turned out good! The BBQ sauce you choose makes a big difference. I used a sweeter bourbon sauce and it worked great. Would recommend using lots of onion.

Made last night for dinner. Even hubby, who doesn't particularly like BBQ so much, raved about them. I didn't use 2 tortillas per quesadilla, just placed ingredients on one half and folded over. Will definitely make again!

Made this as written and thought it was really good, the one thing I would do different would be to shred the chicken, it would make it easier to eat and not fall out of the tortilla. I did change one thing since making this, I added a few shakes of Smokehouse Maple Seasoning from McCormick. So yummy!!

I chose this because it sounded good and it turned out really good. I changed the amount of honey I put in it and I would recommend shredding the chicken before adding the barbecue sauce.

I choose this recipe because it seemed different than your traditional quesadilla and I thought it looked really good. When I made this it turned out really well and it tasted really good. If you make these I would suggest to turn the quesadillas over halfway through. One thing that I did was I changed the cooking time and the amount of barbeque sauce. I would suggest adding less barbeque sauce and add some spices to the quesadillas to add more flavor.

I bake quesadillas for 3-5 min. 20 it's to much. But definitely it's something worth to be cooked and dedicate your effort for.

My 16 year old son that no longer gives unsolicited comments says that this is a 5 out of a 5. I followed directions to a T EXCEPT (there's always an except) I used multigrain tortillas. I was attracted to this recipe due to the carmelized onions and then honey on top of it. My son is a fan of bbq so that was another plus. Everything was just so nice. Great recipe.  I will have parts of this recipe in my head forever as I quickly throw a meal together. Oh, I forgot. I did cook on stovetop instead of oven to speed up dinner as I had a class that I had to go to before and dinner was pushed back. It's so easy on stovetop. In fact, my son had seconds and cooked his second serving.

These are VERY good! The onions really, really put this dish over the top! I made a  few changes...After cooking my chicken I added what I thought was the appropriate amount of barbecue sauce, I also used whole wheat tortillas, and instead of baking them I brushed with evoo and cooked them on my griddle. Every one really enjoyed them!

I made this last night for the first time exactly as the recipe instructed.  I used Stubbs Sweet Heat BBQ sauce and that seemed to be the perfect match for this recipe as it's a Texas style BBQ sauce and complimented the flavors wonderfully.  I only baked in the oven for about 15 minutes.  The presentation wasn't as good looking as restaurant quesadillas, the bottom tortilla had browned but the top was just brown on edges, but the taste was superb!  In the future I may chop the onions up finer instead of using rings as I'm not a huge fan of onions.

Took suggestions of adding extra cheese and jalapeño  & pan heated rather than heating in oven. I also added tomato

I didn't care for this recipe. Was overly sweet, even with a more savory/smoky sauce. BBQ and quesadillas do not go well together :( I ended up losing the flavor of the onion as well.

Very yummy, my husband LOVES Mexican food and liked it lots. I did substitute the chicken to red beans, used only 2 table spoons of barbecue sauce and used 8 tortillas.

This was seriously delicious. My husband complimented me on it TWICE during dinner. When I put the last tortilla on top, I applied pressure to kind of smoosh it and the contents below a little flatter. I also only baked for 10 minutes since everything else was cooked. The bottom tortilla still got a tad crispy doing it that way, so next time I may ever opt for 8 minutes. Either way, will be making again. So good and simple! I did season the chicken with Rachael Ray poultry seasoning and Lowry's seasoned salt. Other than that, followed recipe to a T.

I love making quesadillas, but these were just Ok. Some of it was probably on our end, as they were a bit too saucy. This caused them to become very messy.  I prefer my quesadillas crispier, I normally use a frying pan, I won't bake them again.

I made this using taco style shredded cheese and it was really good. I'd probably use about 1/3 cup of bbq sauce and not 1/2 cup. My 6 year old and husband liked it a lot.

My husband & I both enjoyed this. I used rotisserie chicken, warmed through in the bbq sauce. Everything else was made per the recipe. Super easy & fast.  The onions are key! Will make again.

Very easy lunch and tasty! The BBQ sauce with the chicken and the honey with the onion mix in very well together. Not to mention that baking the tortilla shell gives it that nice crunch! I will make this again!

After looking at all the reviews I decided to bake in the oven as directed however filled half and folded for less mess.  Also timed for 10 minutes to check and did not need to add any additional time.  They were perfect!  Hit with my picky 13 year old (left the onions off of his).

I made a meal for my family due to the fact I didn't want to be one of the worst cooks in America. It tasted absolutely WONDERFUL! I used rudy's  and a sweet baby rays onion barbecue sauce and it tasted great. I seasoned the chicken a little bit and the whole thing came together marvelously. I'm definitely not one of the worst cooks in America lol

This dish was amazing...I have a 5month and a 7 year old so it was very easy to make not too much time and my daughter was able to help out with this dish which is a plus in my book... i loved how the honey tasted on the chicken ...i did make some changes i seasoned my chicken i used garlic powder, pepper, season salt..i cooked the chicken first( used about 5 strips, more chicken needed) then added the onions and honey to the skillet let that carmelized and then added the bbq sauce....

My boyfriend & I absolutely loved this! I followed the recipe exactly, except I followed another comment and folded each of the 8 tortillas in half instead of stacking two together. It helps it stick together better! I also used about 1 cup each of cheddar and Monterrey Jack/Colby cheese mix. I absolutely loved the caramelized onions and used the original Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Delicious, delicious!

I was looking for something different for chicken quesadillas and this was it.  The bbq sauce and carmelized onions were so tasty together.  I served mine with ranch dressing on the side.

This was a great quick, simple and delicious recipe. I added crisp turkey bacon bits which I made at home in the microwave. After i sprinkled the cheese I then sprinkled a thin layer of bacon on top and then closed them up and baked as directed. For bacon bits place a few bacon strips (on a layer of paper towels on a microwave safe plate, use another layer of paper towels to cover bacon and microwave on high from 5 - 6 minutes. Remove from microwave, remove top layer of paper towels and let stand for 1-2 minutes until cool, dry and crisp enough to handle. Break 1 or 2 pieces of bacon in half and use your hands to crumble the bacon into smaller pieces).

The star of this recipe is the caramelized onions and when I make these again, I will double them.  I would also double the cheese.  I used Famous Dave's Sweet & Spicy BBQ sauce, but next time I will pick a sauce that boasts a little heat/spice, as I felt the quesadillas fell a little short on flavor, as is.  My preferred method for cooking quesadillas is in a hot dry skillet, as opposed to in the oven.  Great, versatile recipe!  Thanks for sharing, MICHELLE!

This was really good! Used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and left out the honey since it's already really sweet. Picky teen LOVED it, but think I will shred the chicken next time - just a texture preference. Served it with shredded lettuce, sour cream,diced tomoato and chips/salsa. Added a lot more cheese than it called for before baking but my teen is a huge cheese lover as well.

The recipe depends a lot on the barbecue sauce you use. It basically revolves around that sauce. If I were to do this again, I would skip the honey, just caramelize the onion well, then pan-sear the chicken strips, add some fresh ingredients such as guacamole, salsa, pico de gallo.

These seemed like a good idea, I liked the idea of the flavor of the barbecue and honey, but they were just so blah.  They needed some heat or something....some jalepeno or something like that to liven them up.  I was not completely disapointed in them, just unimpressed by them.

Great. Next time I'll add some green onions to kick it up a bit.

Delicious! The only change I made was for the second half I added more barbeque sauce once it was all layered before putting it in the oven.

I made this for lunch for four of my friends.  I made the recipe as stated and wasn't particularly impressed, nor were my friends.  I couldn't even taste the onions once they were in the quesadilla.  If I made it again I would probably just use regular barbecue chicken and skip the onion step since we couldn't taste it anyway.

I was in a hurry and distracted when I made this, so I mixed up some of the directions, but it turned out great!  I used left-over BBQ chicken and added it into the pan with the honey and onion to warm it.  I didn't add any extra BBQ other than what was already on the chicken.  I also added green onions on top of the cheese.  It was wonderful.  I will definitly make this again with left-over BBQ!

I was really surprised at how well these came out.  Both my husband and I weren't sure, but you never know unless you try right?  Sure glad we tried.  I used some left over chicken thighs and added some frozen peppers.  Served with some sweetcorn (busy weeknight!). Another nice way to use up leftover chicken, but you  need to like BBQ sauce to like this recipe.  Will be making these again.

I make this if I have leftovers from BBQ chicken.  I just shred the meat and then follow this recipe.  I also make it with whatever type of cheese I happen to have.  Tasty, inexpensive,  and easy to prepare!

I had some leftover Big Al's KC Bar-B-Q sauce (the best), from this site, and decided to try this. I only had a red onion, so I skipped the honey/onion saute. Added a touch of chipotle peppers (needed to use up). Turned out quite yummy. Great way to use up leftovers in a quick easy meal. Will make again!!

I used a good BBQ sauce(Jack Daniels) and cooked the quesadillas on a griddle rather than the oven.
They taste great with either sour cream or ranch dressing as a dip.

Made these for my meat eating boyfriend and he liked them. I switched the bbq sauce with the bloomin onion sauce from this website. Only change he asked for was a little less onion next time. I liked that they were baked, not fried. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband loved um!  I used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce & followed another reviewers suggestion to cook in 1 tsp of oil in a pan.  I would suggest making them in the small flour tortilla as opposed to the large.  It was really hard to flip!  The onions were GREAT!  Thanks for posting this recipe, it's a keeper!  Tasted a bit like BBQ chicken pizza from California Pizza Kitchen!  We loved it!

Was a great starting point! It was OK as is, but I am a quesadilla foodie. I added a little red wine and a little garlic salt to the BBQ/chicken mixture. I eyeballed the BBQ sauce, I think I used more than 1/2c. Also used wheat tort., sauteed some spinach and used sour cream. Kids liked it - didn't even mind the onions! Would def. do again - thanks for the start!

The recipe is absolutely fantastic.  I added some bacon bits just as a personal preference.  My husband is still talking about how good they were and we had them for dinner two nights ago!  It's a great twist on the classic quesadilla.

Excellent!  Will probably make often in the future!  I gave it a kick by adding a couple teaspoons of taco seasoning to the chicken and using Sweet Baby Rays spicy BBQ sauce.  I didn't have the suggested cheeses, but I did have mild cheddar and mozzarella and it was very good!

These were very good.  I would have never thought to put the honey on the onions, but that really added a lot to the recipe.  We used a spicy bbq sauce and the sweet from the honey was a wonderful contrast!   I will make this one again and again.

Great recipe- I took a few shortcuts- skipped the honey, used a little barbeque sauce instead, and used just cheddar cheese.  I didn't measure anything.  They were melty and saucy and delicious!

This was just great!  I loved the onions with honey - it was the perfect touch.  Very easy too!

Fun!  I made these in my quesadilla maker.  They have a nice sweet taste.  Similar to a restaurant!

This was very very yummy! I used twice as much chicken (and bbq sauce) in the recipe, which made them taste great (I like quesadillas to be very full), but they tended to fall apart more easily. I also used honey-garlic bbq sauce, I thought it worked great with honeyed onions.

I made these for dinner tonight and we thought they were really good.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added about 1/3 cup of salsa to the chicken mixture (in addition to the bbq sauce).  Also, instead of making individual quesadilla's, I used 3 10" flour tortilla's and I layered it (like a pie).  It was really good this way, but most definitely the chicken mixture would not have made 8 quesadilla's the way the recipe called for.

This was a big hit I received a quesadila maker for chirstmas and put it to good use.  My finance loved the carmelized onions.  What really makes this recipe is your choice of barbeque sauce.  Make sure you use a good quality one and as serious discussions with my finance have ended, barbeque sauce preference is a personal choice.

We thought these were very good, a nice 'twist' with the BBQ sauce!  Think the next time I make these I will just slightly oil and heat the tortillas, fold like a burrito and grill on my griddle just to keep all the cheese inside better.

This was praised as being better than ANY restuarant quesdilla! I used four total cups of cheese, though. That's WAY more than the recipe calls for, but I had no problems with oozing and it would have been dry without the extra cheese. My family looooved this.

Thought this was pretty good, except it only made three quesadillas instead of four.  I used a Colby-Monterey Jack combination versus the Cheddar-Jack and thought it was just fine.  It's a nice twist on regular quesadillas.

Excellent recipe! It was so unique tasting! I added garlic and green peppers to the onions. Before I baked it I put fresh cilantro and diced tomatoes on top of the cooked onion mixture. It really added some extra flavor!!

I'm always looking for new recipes for quesadillas and this one is a keeper.  I used a slow cooker for the chicken breasts so they could be easily shredded.  I found I only had enough filling for two large quesadillas. I cooked them on a griddle on the stove, which is my preferred way to cook quesadillas, then cut them with a pizza cutter.  We really enjoyed the flavor of the caramelized onions, even though they didn't settle well!  I had never caramelized onions before and was anxious to see how they tasted.  Don't put your finger into them right after they come off the stove--they're about a bazillion degrees, as the blister on my finger will attest.  I didn't have any sour cream, but believe they would be enhanced by it.  Good recipe!

I loved this recipe... I modified it a little so I could serve these for a dinner item... I just added green and red peppers, along with one fresh tomato...  I also did the sour cream, cilantro, and salsa.  So good!  Thanks for a great tasting summer dish.

I had no ideas that making quesadillas at home was this easy.  I thought these were easy and a great light summer meal.  I added precooked bacon to my quesadillas for added flavor.  These are always a hit when cooking for children.

Great recipe! I also used butter to brown the outside of the tortillas. I lessened the amount of red onion to appeal to the kids. Used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce. Delicious! Can't wait to make again. I didn't even bother with the guacamole, salsa or sour cream -- It was that flavorful. Next time, I may add a little bit of fresh chopped cilantro.

I diced the chicken and also made smaller onion pieces. But I let them cook the full 19 minutes and that got them too crispy. But overall, we enjoyed them and now have the experience to make them perfect!

What's not to absolutely love about this recipe--yum, yum!!!!  We cooked our chicken on the Foreman Grill to reduce fat.  Be very careful not to cook tortillas too long b/c they will get very, very crispy.

My husband and I enjoyed this. I cut the chicken up in very small pieces and cut the onion a bit smaller too. I think it is easier to handle when the pieces are smaller. I like the sweet BBQ taste mixed in with the cheese. Yum. I thought it was easier to cook this on a griddle for a minute than in the oven. It's easier to watch them an dmake sure they don't go too long.

This wasn't bad at all, just not sure I'll make it often.  It just got to be a bit too much bbq sauce and cheese.  It'll get made again, just not for a while.

INSTEAD OF THE HONEY I USED HONEY BBQ SAUCE..BUT NEXT TIME I THINK I WILL JUST USE PLAIN BBQ SAUCE. ME AND MY HUSBAND BOTH THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT TOO SWEET. I ALSO DID THEM IN THE SKILLET INSTEAD OF THE OVEN..AND I ALSO USED FAT FREE SHREDDED CHEESE TO MAKE IT LOWER IN FAT. I DO THINK I WILL MAKE THESE AGAIN

We fixed these to go along with all of our other 4th of July nibbles, and boy were they awesome! They were really easy and it was also nice because most of the ingredients I had on hand. The preparation is quite simple, but the end result and presentation were really suprising; AWESOME AND DELICIOUS!!!! Made a *quesadilla bar* with some guacamole, sour cream,extra bbq sauce, salsa, etc. Everyone really raved about them! They went QUICK! Gave the recipe to oh so many people. LOVED IT, LOVED IT, LOVED IT!!!!!!! Thanks for submitting the recipe.

I cannot believe how quick, easy and delicious these were.  I used roasted red pepper tortillas and they were great.  I would suggest watching the cooking time as everything seemed to cook quicker then the times noted.  Will definitely make these again.

This is a great recipe. The barbeque sauce adds just enough "zip" without being overpowering. Since we aren't quacamole fans, I served mine with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, and sour cream. These will definitely be a repeated menu item in my kitchen! Thank you, Michelle.

This was a very good and yummy quesadilla recipe. It was different from others I have tried. This one is a keeper! Thanks!
