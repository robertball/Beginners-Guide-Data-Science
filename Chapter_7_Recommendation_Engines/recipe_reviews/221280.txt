Five stars due to the fact that it is such a simple, quick and savory side dish!  Judging the recipe AS IT IS, I would say it is very good.  Yes, it is a corn muffin and thus could potentially pale in comparison to more elaborate side dishes.  However, for a weekday “oh my, what am I going to put on the side with my main dish?!” option, this hit the spot; after all, how can you go wrong with bacon and cheese?
I am sure that one could oomph it up with more herbs or spice.  I would say that tarragon, oregano or basil would give it a little more finesse.  Personally, next time I might just add about ½ teaspoon of either smoky paprika or chipotle powder.
I think the most important aspect is that my 1.5 and 3.5 year old boys really liked it, which is reason enough for me.  I must say that two muffins magically disappeared in the process of taking them out of the over and putting them on the plate…

These are great muffins for busy mornings! I make the mix up the night before so all I have to do in the morning is fill up the muffin cups and bake! My daughter and husband both love these and ask for them regularly!!

I skipped the bacon and the dry mustard--I kept everything else the same. Baked at 400*, these were done at exactly 15 minutes. VERY moist. The kids especially liked this.

These were excellent. Made them up as mini muffins and froze ahead of time. Threw some homemade chili in the slow cooker and thawed these out and reheated...dinner's already done when I get home from a busy day at work!

Very good recipe. They were moist which I liked because I don't care for overly dry cornbread. I added 1/4 cup finely chopped yellow onion and kept all other measurements and ingredients the same. I made 24 mini muffins. I needed to fill them almost to the top instead of 2/3 full but that was no problem. They came out beautifully after 15 minutes, not a mile high and not stuck together or on top of the pan. Next time I might add a dash of salt and pepper or even vegetable seasoning.

I'm a newbie to making cornbread anything but I wanted to try this recipe with the rest of my southern-style New Year's dinner.  Very glad I did!  I could only find an 11.5oz package of cornbread mix so I used that and doubled all the other ingredients.  I also added a large handful of sliced scallions (green parts only).  Also, the cooking time wasn't long enough for me (but it could just be my extremely old oven).  So I baked regular sized muffins at 400 for 15 minutes then turned down to 375 for 3-4 minutes and they were cooked all the way through without being dry.  This made 18 muffins with the doubling.  Next time I may add a pinch of salt to the batter as well, but overall it's a great recipe.  Thanks!

Okay, I would have given these a 4, but my husband LOVED them, so they get a 5!  I stumbled upon this recipe while looking for a way to use up some leftover bacon (other than just eating it by itself).  I had most of the stuff, but it wasn't the exact cornbread mix, and I didn't have sour cream, or the correct cheese.  I used plain non-fat yogurt in place of the sour cream, added a green onion, and I used a shredded Italian cheese blend that I had.  They turned out nicely!  I bet they're even better if you follow the recipe, but it's nice to know that you can vary it a little.  Also, if I make these again I will probably use cupcake liners to make clean up easier.

Edit: made a version of these today and all of my cheese sank to the bottom! I don't know why :(

They were terrible. The bread was the worst part. I think the cornbread mix needed to be changed to something sweeter.

These were such a hit. Why wouldn't they be? Bacon + cheese = scrumptious! They kept for 2 days, probably longer if refrigerated or frozen. 15 seconds in the microwave to heat up. Great grab and go, though not the healthiest choice.  Easy to make with kids.

These are amazing, I just added in 2 tablespoons of fresh sliced chives!  These go great with Chili!
