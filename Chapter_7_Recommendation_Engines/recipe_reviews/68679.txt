We loved this soup! It's very easy to make, especially when you throw it all into the crockpot. I cooked it on high for 2 hours then turned it down to low for another 6...thanks for the great recipe!

My family really, really liked this soup. We prefer a heartier soup so I added more veggies, barley, and a couple potatoes. I was a little nervous when I first tasted the broth, about 30 min into the simmering. It was a tad bland. After reading a few reviews, I added a little garlic powder, onion powder and more salt (I used Low Sodium Beef Stock) and pepper and covered it back up and waited to taste it again after 1.5 hours. Perfect! All the flavors had had a chance to develop and it was delicious.  This will be on the menu this fall and winter. Thanks for sharing!

I've made it excatly like the recipe and altered. It was very good as is but I think the changes I made make it even better. Boil the beef broth. In a seperate bowl add lean ground meat, 1 egg, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, a pinch of parsley, pepper, thyme. Make mini meatballs (bitesize). Add meatballs to boiling broth. When they float they are done. Add remaining ingredients and ADD 1 CAN TOMATO SAUCE. Simmer for 2 hours.  The original recipe lacked presentation. It was something I would make for myself as a comfort food. With the changes I made I would definatly serve to company!

This was excellent and I had to alter the recipe because I did not have any barley, always have barley in the cupboard so I did not check...anyways I used a cup of brown rice in the last hour of cooking...it was great and had just a bit of bite to it.  Come to find out my husband added a small pinch of crushed red pepper before I added the rice.

I made this soup for Friday night dinner and it was excellent.  I didn't change the ingredients at all.  The only thing I did differently was after browning the ground beef I took it out of the pot and poured out any grease.  Then added a little bit of olive oil and sauted the carrots, onion, celery and garlic for about 5 minutes to soften.  Then added back in the ground beef and the rest of the ingredients.  I love making soups in the fall/winter and this one is a keeper.  Thank you for sharing.

This is a great recipe. I like my vegetables a little chunky so I chopped the onions and carrots instead of minced. Other than that I followed the directions exactly. It is a nice thick and tasty soup. It also freezes very well.

Oh so yummy!  My Mexican husband raved!  Instead of the can of diced tomatoes I used Ro-Tel diced tomatoes with cilantro and lime juice.  I also used all broth, no plain water.  Will make again and again!

Very good and comforting!  I only used 1 pound of hamburger and sauteed the onion and garlic while it cooked.  We prefer a chunkier soup so I cut the carrots & celery into bigger pieces instead of mincing them.  I also bumped the barely up to 1 full cup.  Definitely let the soup simmer for the full amount of time.  The flavors really come together then.  It does make a thicker soup, but we actually liked it better that way.  This is great for cold winter nights!

This is a great soup for a chilly evening or anytime that winter is getting you down. Other reviewers are right on with their comments about being able to add additional barley, other vegetables (sliced mushrooms for instance) and I used additional fresh garlic cloves (minced) and these just added to the great flavor. This recipe is certainly one to keep and keep coming back to.

This recipe for hamburger soup was awesome. I did make a few alterations to it. I love spices so I added rosemary, more bay leaves, and when I fry my hamburger up I always add celery seed and a dash of nutmeg. I also love barley so I increased the barley. I will totally make this recipe again and will recommend it to my friends too. Cheers!

This was DELICIOUS! Even my son who is not a soup lover had seconds. I used 2 lbs. of ground beef, a large sweet onion, doubled the carrots and celery, used homemade beef stock (Yum!), fresh garlic and omitted the tomato soup. I also added a heaping 1/2 cup of barley. Loved the addition of the barley. I will make this often. Thank you for the recipe.

LOVED this...hearty soups are the best.  Great comfort food and easy, too.  I did the mini-meatballs as some suggested they added a lot to the presentation (be sure to spice the ground beef before making the meatballs).  Superb recipe, thanks!

I used all ingredients exactly as written and only changed the cooking method to slow cooker.  Excellent, hearty soup, but could use a bit of zip -- next time I'll add a bit of chopped jalapeno and maybe just a tad of salt.  I might also try adding a can of drained black beans.  As for cooking, brown your hamburger with the onion and garlic before putting in your slow cooker, then add all the other ingredients.  Cook on high for 2 hours and then low for 6 more hours.  Perfect!

This makes a LOT. I made it in the crock pot and needed my six quart one. I chunked the veggies instead of mincing them. It simmered all day and made the kitchen smell great. I didn't change any of the ingredients except for a little more ground beef. The family LOVED it.  I do wish I had added a bit more barley because I really like it. - Oh - and I used the lower sodium beef broth. I figure it's always easier to add salt later than to take it out if it's too much for my taste.

Excellent soup! Fun and easy to make. I subbed whole canned potatoes cut in half (added in the last 10 minutes just to heat them up) for the celery because my husband doesn't like celery. I added red pepper flakes and chili powder (to taste). We like things spicy! This reheats well too!

I have made this recipe several times and my whole family loves it. My mother has heart disease and is on a low sodium diet so I use 2 cans of low sodium beef broth and substitute water for the other can. Those who can add salt to taste but I actually like it as it is.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I was surprised that it completely filled my dutch oven pot, but I was able to get the lid on. I liked all of the different vegetables this had in it. I realized after I started making the recipe that I didn't have barley, so I subbed an equal amount of uncooked rice. When it was done I added some garlic and onion powder to taste. It was a hearty soup, as suggested. I ate it with some buttered flavored crackers. TY

I made this several times this past winter and it's always wonderful and comforting.  Sometimes I add a handful of frozen peas, another can of diced tomatoes or 3/4 cup of barley.  Such a versatile recipe, but super good no matter how you change it up.

Made this soup last night for dinner along with some home made bread and it was very good. I didn't have the condensed soup (not a big fan of the condensed soup taste in my food) so I added an extra cup of water and most of a small can of tomato paste.

I made this soup in the crock pot.  I used mushrooms, carrots, celery, onion and green beans.  I browned the beef first of all before putting all the ingredients into the crock pot on low for 8 hours.  Unfortunately even after that time the vegetables were still hard, nice time I may partially cook the vegetables first of cook.  I left this cooking overnight and we had it for lunch the next day.  The actual taste was a little on the bland side, good thick soup but just needs a little something else to kick it up a little!

Added macaroni, because I didn't have barley.  Also, only one can of beef broth and extra water.  and 2 lbs of hamburger.  This was really flavorful.  Play with the recipe - it is hard to ruin.

This was a very good starter recipe. Unfortunately, I had assumed I had all the ingredients and realized I didn't as I was already committed.  My substitutions, though, were very good!  Instead of carrots and celery, I used a 16 oz. frozen bag of peas and carrots. I increased the barley to 3/4 cup.  For the beef broth, I used 4 cups of water + 5 beef bouillon cubes.  I was out of tomato soup, yet a can of plain tomato sauce did the trick.  I eliminated the bay leaf, parsley, and time. Instead, I added garlic salt and basil.  When browning the ground beef, I added the onion (chunked) and minced, fresh garlic.  Finally, I used my crock pot - an hour on high and then at least an hour or so on low.  Everyone - even my finicky youngest - loved the results! This is a great recipe for a cold, dreary winter day.

I made this last night for dinner, we really enjoyed this soup. I didn't have barley so I used half a cup of instant rice. I will make again using the barley, but the recipe is a keeper.

I made this for dinner last night and it was a HUGE hit.  The only thing I did different, is I put it in the crockpot to cook all day.  Great yummy soup.  I will absolutely make this again.

Great - added fresh corn.  Will use all broth, more barley and not quite as much Thyme next time.  Perhaps some potatoes or kidney beans.  It is very versatile and you can adjust it as you please.

This was wonderful!!   My daughter and I added extra barley, meat and used Italian diced tomatoes.  I froze the left over (4 days worth)soup but my daughter kept asking for it  day after day.  Guess I shouldn't have freezed it in the first place:)

Great soup but I am not keen on bay leaf so I only put in half of one and took it out early.  Also I thinned it down with either V8 or tomato soup.  Have made it several times and froze what was left for later.  Worked just fine.

Making this for the second time as it was a huge hit with my family the first time. I believe I was short on barley the first time so I added in some quinoa about 30 minutes before it was done. I agree with others that it is a very versatile soup. I would think you can add or sub just about any veggie and adjust spices to your liking. I have a house full of picky eaters and the fact that EVERYONE loved it....it's saying a lot. Thanks for sharing this one!

This soup is pretty good.  Major benefit is that it is VERY filling with the beef and the barley.  When I ate it for lunch (sans anything else), it would keep me full way past dinnertime.  I used a small can of tomato paste rater than the condensed tomato soup, which has too many artificial ingredients for my taste.  Also, I used 1 lb of ground beef and that was a good ratio against the 1/2 cup barley.

I was looking for a tasteful, not too citric (v8), beef barley veggie soup.  I have tried several recipes and this one is at the top of the list.  Thanks.

I thought this hamburger soup was very good.  Simple to throw together for an easy dinner with  salad and bread.  I put this in the crock pot on high for about 5 hrs.  I added some cumin, red pepper flakes and 4 beef boulion cubes because like some other reviewers said it was a bit bland.  I also added more barley than the recipe called for so I added a little more beef stock.  During the last couple hours of cooking I decided to throw in some frozen corn.  Adding some extra spices gives it a nice flavor and the extra barley makes it a thick stew-soup.

What a wonderful soup!  I made this to celebrate the first day of fall, and it was perfect.  I followed the recipe with just a couple of minor exceptions.  I added a packet of Goya powdered carne boullion and a tablespoon of smoked paprika, and used some garlic & onion powder, salt and pepper to taste.  Served with fresh bread and butter.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, sharilee.  It's a keeper!

A good base for making a great soup.  I doubled the barley as I like it and wanted a bit thicker 'stew'.  This could be modified in so many ways and still taste delicious!

The whole family really likes this one.  The kids liked it better when I left out the tomato soup.  I add green beans, italian seasoning, and sometimes throw in a couple of handfuls of spinach the last few minutes of cooking.

Oh my goodness this recipe brings back memories.   When our girls were at home it was one of our standbys and we all loved it.   Did not use the barley, but that was a taste preference.   Can be added to - very adaptable.  Great to see it in print and I might even make it again.

Very good!  This can be adjusted a number of different ways.  Only used 1 lb hamburger, low sodium beef broth, added more water and eliminated the tomato soup.  Added a few potatoes and some sliced mushroom and frozen corn (needed to be used up).  Used quick cook barley, so this was done in under 2 hours.  There is some chopping involved, but the time is well worth it!  Will make it again!!

I want to love this but thought it was overly acidic (maybe it's the brand I'm using? Hunts?) and processed-tasting. But it's loaded with with good veggies and I love the barley in there. I've made this according to the recipe once and once with the meatball suggestion by Tracy and liked the meatballs better (the texture is much softer, less chewing needed but then there is so much more fat to get out which is annoying later). Definitely great for the fall with a nice hunk of bread.

I have had a soup like this one before and lost the recipe. It is very easy to prepare, uses ordinary ingredients that most of us have at home already and produces a big pot of hearty soup.  I followed the directions carefully and was very satisfied with the result.  This recipe can definitely feed a hungry family.  I minced my vegetables and also added some larger chunks.  I would not hesitate to add anything else that I like:  potatoes, peppers, etc.

I have made this soup three times in the last month now; I am addicted to it! I have made a couple of changes to it, however. I also add 1 lb. of mild sausage (like Bob Evans), I use rice instead of barley (because that's what I have), increase the water a little and add two cans of tomato soup. My family loves this meal; I can't get enough of it!

My family loved this soup. It was especially great because I almost always have these ingredients on-hand. I did not change the recipe, and served with cornbread muffins. The flavor is even better the next day.

Delicious! Reminded me of my mom's beef and veggie soup. I did not add barley because I didn't have any, but other than that I followed the recipe, and it was yummy. My hubby liked it too. Great for cold winter days. You could really add an veggies that you like to it I believe. We had corn muffins with it. I think next time I'll try it with stew beef. Thanks for sharing it!

Holy cow! I'll be making this a lot!!! I did use a little more barley. Since I'm trying to cut back on sodium, I eliminated all the salt (used lower sodium beef stock & tomatoes), but added some smoked chipotle sauce for flavor. YUM!!!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this soup! It was SO easy to make, the prep was fast and clean up a sinch!!! It does need to simmer for 2 hours so it's not really a "QUICK MEAL" but it is a  great meal for a snowy winter afternoon to make for the evening. The other thing I LOVE about this recepie was that I made some for my sister and her twin 12 mos. olds were able to eat it when it was cool enough because all the veggies are shredded, the barley is soft and the meat is VERY chopped.   Make it!!! You'll love it too!

This was delicious! It turned out more like a stew, probably because I added a can of green beans and corn. I omitted barley but added small pasta noodles. A lot of leftovers but it will be eaten this week for lunch. I'll definitely make again especially on a cold day.

Belly filling and a great cold weather dinner! When following this recipe, it does yield a lot but I seldom have leftovers. I serve it with honey cornbread.

I have been making this soup for years. Have not  found a person who does not like it.  Come the first  cold days in the fall, everyone is asking for it.  I also cut my vegetables into chunks, as this is the way we prefer it. I leave mine cooking on the stove for  up to 4hrs, find it  has better flavor.  But we find it even better the next day!

One of the tastiest hamburger soups that I have tried! The first time I made it, I followed the recipe and it turned out wonderful but my wife, who is gluten intolerant, could not eat it. I made it again substituting a wild rice/brown rice mix for the barley and it was great! It is now my goto soup on those cold winter days.

Really cold here today so I was looking for a soup to make for dinner and wanted to use hamburger.  This one fit the bill!  I only had 1 lb of hamburger, the bottom of a box of barley which probably was only about 1/4 cup, used no water, one quart jar of home canned tomatoes, 1 can of beef broth (10 oz) and added a bit of Montreal steak seasoning.  This is warm, hearty and filling.  Thanks!

This was delicious! Made it as written. My husband, who is not a fan of anything with ground beef (unless it is in the form of a burger :) loved it. The kids gobbled it up, too. This may seem obvious to some, but I'll say it since I'm not an expert and hope it helps others: taste your soup!!! Some broths and canned tomatoes have more salt than others, and depending on which brand I have found that I either needed to add some salt or add none at all. Delicious :)

We love this recipe! I make it in a slow cooker for camping. I also add potatoes and cauliflower cook it on high for 6 hours than turn on low or warm depending on how tender the veggies are. A good bowl of soup after a long day of trout fishing!

Used less hamburger, more barley, cooked in slow cooker, otherwise as written. Pretty bland in a pasty sort of way; I think it was the tomato soup that was the culprit.

Ummm.... great comfort food. I have been making a similar one for years known as "Hearty Man Soup". The difference: no tomato soup, no barley, no garlic, 1 can beef broth, 3 c. water, and not all the herbs.  I don't see the need to cook more than 1 hr. but I am always last minute and am trying to hurry things along. We do biscuits or cornbread with this.... perfect!

Made this on a cold fall day and the familiy raved about it. The only this I did different was to add two potatoes and as others have said went half again as much barley. Wonderful soup.

One of my favorite soups! I made it for my husband when we were dating and he couldn't believe his taste buds. Generally I use beer in place of water (a dark beer like Fat Tire; it's never the same one) and Italian diced tomatoes. I use onion powder because I don't like soft onions and always add some chili powder. I've added potatoes before (turns out great!) and generally increase the barley as well. I also increase the veggies and dice instead of mince.

This was easy to make and it was hearty, but in the end "just OK".  Guests felt it tasted like chili without the chili powder and I did find it somewhat bland.  I followed the recipe as is the first time, so will maybe try again adding more liquid and more spices.

This so good with few ingredients and things you have around! I used 1 cup barley and added a can of drained and rinsed mixed beans. A big hit, served with Blue Ribbon Overnight Rolls. Can't wait for leftovers :)

I've been using this basic recipe for years.  It's filling, tastes good and is healthy.  I use  tomato juice or beef stock instead of water, add a little Worcestershire sauce and also some coarsely chopped cabbage if I have any on hand. Garden fresh corn and green beans are good, too. Sometimes macaroni or beans (black or kidney) instead of barley.  Just add whatever you have on hand, there really is no wrong or right with this recipe.

Definitely adding this as a go-to recipe! I doubled the barley, and used small can of tomato paste instead of soup as I was out. Added a touch of onion and garlic powder as recommended, and doubled the thyme. Didn’t have parsley or bay leaf and still turned out mouth watering.

I used rice instead of barely as I didn't have any on hand. I also didn't use diced tomatoes and used tomato sauce, 3 cups beef stock and 1 cup water. I also didn't have parsley and just used extra thyme. Mine turned out more like a stew but it was hearty and delicious and we ate it with toasted buttered hot dog buns. Very yummy for a cold fall day! :)

I used crushed tomatoes and tomato paste instead of canned tomato soup. I used a carton of beef stock as well.  I also added red pepper flakes for some heat and a good bit of black pepper. I don't like the flavor of bay leaves so I omitted it and didn't miss it. in addition to the veggies in original recipe I threw in some fresh green beans. I didn't have barley on hand so I used sprouted rice and quinoa that was in my pantry. 
good recipe and easily modified for personal preference!

This a great winter soup. I did make a couple of additions though. I increase the amount of vegetables, added a bit of minced chillies and chopped bacon which I sautéed with the meat. I also cooked the vegetables with the meat before adding the tomatoes, broth and soup. I garnished the soup with shredded cheese. ( I guess you could now call it hearty bacon cheeseburger soup!)

My family loved this soup! I changed very little, only adding extra spices (more garlic, onion powder, and white pepper), and I used all beef broth, no water. I made the Cheddar Bay Biscuits on this site to accompany, and the meal was fabulous. It's so nice when you are a mom who cooks every night, and you find a meal that's a hit with your family. Especially when you hear, "This is great mom, you have to make this again", and "I'm taking the leftovers for lunch tomorrow". Score! :)

I have been making this soup for many years, my kids loved it and so does my husband. It freezes wonderfully.  It is great to have home made hearty soups in the freezer for those days you just don't have time to cook or you just want to give some thing to a neighbour in need. Great with home made bread buns.

This is EXACTLY the recipe my mother made starting about 50 years ago!  It is so yummy!  I use a little more barley because we like our soup really thick.  I also suggest that Campbell's brand of condensed canned beef broth is the best; have tried it with other brands and it is just not quite the same.  I have used the ready-to-use beef broth and nope, it MUST be Campbell's condensed!

Love, love, love this soup!  I, like many others, enjoy my soup with chunky vegetables.  I also used rice as I didn't have any barley.  Preferred not to have it watered down so I didn't add any water.  Making it again today.  Going to serve it with a home made loaf of bread.....and I'm doubling the recipe this time!  Love leftover soup for my lunch at work the next day!!!

I can't imagine using water in a soup when you can enhance the flavour with broth, so I made a change there. I also don't ever use canned soups so I subbed that with a jar of home-made tomato sauce. I was feeding a crowd so I batched up times two. Worked out well. Also learned that pot barley works well in soup. I usually use pearl but pot barley was all I could find. Glad I found this recipe. Really nice on a cold day. Thanks SHARILEE.

Made this before I became a vegetarian (for health reasons) and loved it then!  Modified it vegetarian with vegetarian beef broth and MorningStar Crumbles and it tastes the same!!

This is my "go to" recipe when I want homemade soup. I've made this as written and also with my own variations with what I had on hand and it's always good. My favorite variation is to add a diced green pepper, rice and an extra can of tomatoes.

Nothing needs to be changed for this glorious soup! I did add about half of a cubed up rootabaga and that was a nice touch. My family loves it.

I love this recipe.  I made a couple of changes.  I added more veggies and barley and garlic. I can't eat condensed tomato soup (too much sodium), so I added tomato sauce instead. Company put a bit of fresh grated parmesan on top... thanks for sharing.  DEFINATELY A KEEPER!!

Started out as a way to use up some leftover ground beef, ended up loving the soup! I added swiss chard for some color/greens as well as using homemade beef stock (5-6 cups) and no water.  Definitely a cold weather staple in our home now.

I used italian sausage in this recipe making the soup taste phenomenal! I will be making this more often with the meat change. We left everything else the same. Cooked and drained onion, garlic, and italian sausage then threw in the crockpot on high for 2 hrs, low for about 3.

I really did enjoy this soup.  I did add cabbage and a potato.  I will skip the tomatoes next time, though, in favor of some tomato juice.  The changes were based solely because I wanted them (I had cabbage and potatoes on hand), not because this recipe needed any help.  It was a nice thick and hearty soup.

Decent recipe, but there are much better hamburger soups (w/ veggies) on this site. I probably won't make this one again.

I thought this recipe was awesome.  It's one of the best soups i have ever made.  I did however alter the recipe a bit.  Instead of the fresh veggies I used frozen soup veggies. I also used a bit more ground beef.  Added some extra salt, pepper, and garlic season per the review of others. It was still wonderful to me.  My 8 year old loved it also.  We had the soup with cornbread.

After reading such awesome reviews, I expected more than the bland soup that I ended up with. In the end, I added a lot of chili powder to give it a little flavor. I hoped my 9 year old would eat this, but there were too many tomatoes for her to have any interest. I probably won't make this one again.

Used almost the same recipe from our local newspaper, very good.  Only difference was a bunch of fresh parsley rather than the dried herb and 2 bay leaves. (plus my own addition of more minced garlic)

very versatle food, you can make many different substitutions or add just about anything you want and it is still tasty. This is a hard dish to screw up. I used to make something similar after riding snowmachines all day and it is hearty food, serve with some type of bread and you have a meal. For a little extra flavor I like to add  dash of worcestershire sauce and / or A1 sauce.

Simple, wholesome meal. I served it with a little shredded cheddar cheese on top and some cornbread. Very picky husband liked it. It turned out great in crock pot on high for 2 1/2 hours.

I omitted water and cans of broth and added 1 900ml box of beef broth. 1/3 tsp celery salt and splash of garlic powder instead of real garlic. 1 full cup of barley. 
Served with a fresh dinner bun and butter, I thought this was really delicious! Add some salt and fresh pepper to your bowl on top and its very flavorful. I like the tomato flavor and don’t get this confused with chilly (as others have said it was similar). Will definitely make again!

I have actually made this a few times. Use the above and  I added diced potatoes and cabbage
With extra broth. Keep extra beef broth for left overs as if you add potatoes and cabbage liquid will be absorbed

This is my go-to soup recipe.  It makes a big batch and it's hearty enough as a meal alone and tasty enough to serve to guests.  I use ground chicken/turkey at times and it's still delicious.  Just about to make my third pot of the month!

I made this soup almost exactly like the recipe.  As with others, we like our vegis bigger so I did not mince anything.  I used one can of Italian style tomatoes and one small can of rotel tomatoes with chilies.  Once the soup was boiling I adde 1 tblsp of better than beef broth base.  This was absolutely delicious.  I have made this so many times, I almost have it memorized.

I didn't have barley so used 1 cup of orzo in the last hour of cooking. Used only beef broth no water & 8 cups altogether. Completely cooked in 2 hours. Used a large cast iron pot and did it all in one pot. Was very hearty & delicious. Will definitely make it again. Easy!

I made this soup and it was delicious and very filling.
Only ingredient that I changed was I chopped two cans of stewed tomatoes for the diced tomatoes that I didn’t have.I will definitely make this soup again!

I made this soup for my family tonight! Always looking for great soup and stew recipes as the colder weather is upon us. I removed the Barley and add 1/2 cup of macaroni as my 4 year old twin boys don’t like barley! They loved it! So much they ate the whole bowl and told me I can make it again lol! Great Recipe!! Hubby made homemade biscuits to go along, they told him he can make them again as well ????????

I've been making this for years, serving it with condiments such as avocado, grated cheese, etc. My grandniece explained it to her grandmother, who asked how it was made, that Aunt Judy just took cheeseburgers and boiled them, making the soup. The barley in it is soooo good.

I realized I didn't have barley midway through making it so added a wild rice mix instead.  I increased the meat to two pounds too bc of convenience and being meat lovers.  My family really liked it!  I'll try barley next time though - I think it would have been a bit thicker.

This is perfect.  I started backwards, with a fridge full of ingredients I needed to use up after a week of hosting extended family; 1.5 lbs of ground beef and some bags of vegs from veg trays.  I did an ingredients search and found this brilliant idea.  I had to alter the recipe to use up what I had, so chopped up broccoli was included, a red onion, 1/2 a rutabaga, and wagonwheel noodles instead of barley.  This recipe is a keeper - obviously suited to whatever you have on hand to use.  Based on other reviews, I added garlic powder and some beef bovril and increased the broth (2 boxes of unsalted beef broth).

This soup is so versatile and delicious!  I added more barley, which requires more liquid. The next time I do that, I’ll use broth instead of water because the water causes it to lose a little of the flavor. And every now and then I’ll add some Texas Pete after dipping some out. This gives it just a little heat and a different but awesome flavor!

I made this twice.  The first time as is.  The second time I didn't have tomato soup (kids ate it while I was gone) and then I forgot the potatoes.  We decided it was even better without potatoes, but that's just a personal thing.  We also added way more vegetables the second time, like a large bag of frozen mixed.  Nobody even noticed because this soup has so much going on!  YUMMY!
And I finally used barley!  I love beef barley soup when I go out.  Thank you!

Wonderful hearty soup. I made a few changes for my taste. I thought the thyme was overwhelming. Skip the thyme and add 1 tsp of dried dill weed. I also thought it could use a heartier beef flavor, so I added one can of beef consomme. I had some coix seeds on hand and was dying to try them. So, I substituted the barley for the coix. Love it, especially in this cold weather.

Yum!  I even used grilled hamburgers we had the night before and left the veggies chunkier.  I didn’t have diced tomatoes so I just used stewed.  I added kidney beans and chopped pickle!

This was so yummy if you like your soup to be meaty then add more meat then what is called for and really season to your liking is all I would say in regards to this recipe

The only reason I gave a four star rating instead of a five star is it had a bit to many tomatoes in it for my liking. It was still good and my family liked it.

I used low sodium broth for my mom's low sodium diet. I used all the veggies listed in the recipe but I cut them into larger pieces. We like our soup with big chunks of veggies. I also added about 1-3/4 cups of barley. 

I will be making this again. You should give it a try.

This is a great soup.After browning beef off, I browned the celery, onion and carrots like another cook suggested.  I added half a bag of petite frozen peas, green giant broccoli Tuscan flavor,  two cans of stewed tomatoes and one can of whole tomatoes and the juices. Also a chopped up potato and some corn. I used BETTER THAN BEEF BOUILLON beef base 1 tsp(which is fantastic in all recipes needing that beef flavor) garlic, onion powder and some season all.. I only added one cup of water as I added the juices from the tomatoes.   Fantastic.

My 6 and 8 year old devoured this soup! I love trying what the recipes suggests in most cases simply bc it's the cooks vision! But I'm not a huge beef broth fan and my hubby doesn't like celery so I used chicken broth instead and just carrots... I also added whole tomatoes roughly chopped just b/c I had them in my pantry. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Followed recipe, except substituted potatoes for barley and beef broth for the water.  I did add a dash of Worcestershire sauce to the hamburger.  Tasted nice....hubby thought it tasted like minestrone soup.

Excellent with a couple of necessary changes.  I didn't have tomato soup so I used about 10 oz of Kroger brand tomato pasta sauce.  It was a bit too sweet so I added 1 TBS cocoa powder and BAM!!  Perfect.  Like others, I chopped my vegetables bigger.  This will become one of my regulars - with pasta sauce and cocoa,

Very versatile as reading from the reviews most everyone puts their own spin on it depending on groceries on hand and leftovers.  I added cabbage, peas, dill  & peppers and leftover rice, in addition to the barley.  I am sure the soup will be different every time I make it - as there were some great suggestions in the reviews. Great make ahead meal for a busy Saturday.

Like others said, this is a good base for hamburger soup. I cooked my ground beef with the onions and added several cloves of garlic, Worcestershire, a tsp of cumin, and several chopped potatoes. Omitted the celery simply because I didn't and added a can of green beans in the last few minutes of cooking. It may have been the added potatoes but I disagree with reviewers who say 1 tsp of salt is too much. I used the tsp of salt and an extra tbs of bouillon powder.  We enjoyed the meal with mods

I changed it somewhat to suit my taste, added more veggies, used all beef broth  (instead of beef broth and water) I didn't have barley so I skipped it. I also used a jar of spag. sauce instead of tomato soup. I probably shouldn't review because of my changes but it really wasn't that different. It came out incredible! The house smelled so good and now I cant stop eating the leftovers!!!

I substituted mushroom soup for tomato soup, substituted a grain and quinoa mix for barley, substituted frozen corn for the celery,  and substituted a frozen carrot, green bean and pea mix for the carrots. I added 2 more Bay leaves, doubled the Thyme, added 2 tsp. Rosemary, added a tsp. of Nutmeg,  added a tsp. of Celery salt. I used 3 Tbsp. Better than Bouillion beef instead of canned beef broth. I sauteed 3 cloves of garlic with the onion and ground beef before adding the rest of the ingredients. I let it simmer for 6 hours. It was delicious. Next time I will make with biscuits.

I tried to make hamburger soup from memory, but something was missing.  SHARILEE added thyme.  That's what the soup needed!  I substituted a 14.5 oz can of crushed tomatoes, no-salt beef bouillon, and a29 oz can of  Veg-All Mixed vegetables.  It was delicious!

Made as written, next time though I will add a little more barley. Also would be a good use for leftover veggies like corn, green beans, peas etc. just add during the last 15 minutes of cooking. very tasty hearty soup.

This is good soup. I usually don't like hamburger soup, but this is the one I'll make again. I made the recipe as written. Since I used low sodium beef boullion for the beef  broth, I added a teaspoon of no sodium herb blend. Everyone liked this soup. I gave it 4 stars because we couldn't all agree on how much salt should or shouldn't be in the soup.

Great recipe!  I added some Montreal Steak Spice and garlic to the ground beef while frying, but that was just for personal taste.  Would have been wonderful without as well.

I didn’t add the tomatoes because I’m supposed to stay away from the acid. A friend makes this soup like her mother did and they added a can of pork and beans. That’s what I did and it was really good.

I love this recipe and have made it dozens of times. It's my go-to meal prep recipe because it freezes well and it’s inexpensive. The recipe is very good as written. However I've developed a few modifications that IMO make it excellent:

1)	I use 2lbs of ground beef, typically because I typically can't find 1.5lbs containers. To compensate for the extra solids, I’ll add a can of beer along with the beef stock for more liquid. You may also need a pinch more salt.
2)	When sautéing the onion/celery/carrot, add the onion a few minutes before the celery/carrot and cook until it starts to go translucent. Also add a teaspoon or two of red chili flakes along with the onions (or sliced fresh chilis).
3)	Add a bunch of sliced mushrooms at the same time you add the celery/carrot.
4)	Add a splash of Worcestershire sauce.
5)	Go heavy on the parsley (I add a handful).

So good.

DELICIOUS!!!! I followed the ingredients as written and additionally added a chopped up portabello mushroom. Also, after browning the ground beef, and draining, I removed it from the pan, added some EVOO to the pan to cook the veggies in for a short period before adding the ground beef back to it along with the other ingredients. This will definitely be a regular in our soup rotation.

Liana had seconds.  I thought it was delicious!!  No one complained.  I did not put in tomato soup but subbed tomato juice.  Added about 1/2 c. corn, probably roughly 3/4 c. zucchini and the same of green beans.  I used the 1/2 c. barley (quick cooking) it called for and used at least double the garlic it called for.  Just used a full carton of beef broth. (32 0z)

We SO love this soup and followed the recipe, just added tomato juice (about 2cups) instead of condensed soup...  I will not eat condensed soup, and why add it to homemade soup, doesn't make sense too me.

This is the best soup I have ever made! My husband loved it, and was even willing to eat it several days in a row (unusual for him!)  I was sick, and the soup tasted so delicious even to a sick person! I will make it many more times! Thank you for sharing!

I love hamburger soup and this one is easy and hearty.  I leave out the tomato soup, it's not needed, and I just use soup stock and don't add water.  I also add either potatoes or yams (whatever I have) to make it more hearty.

The changes I made.  were, instead of barley, because I didn't have any on hand.  I substituted with rice instead.  Also, seasoned with a little Tony Chachere's.  Really turned out nice!

made this tonight. it is an excellent soup. Nice and thick. I did add extra thyme and my husband added a dollop of sour cream to it. Very tasty and I will be making it again. I might add some oregano as well next time.

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Our whole family enjoyed it except our picky 6-year-old. My husband and I spiced it up with some hot sauce in our own bowls but it was fine without.

Will definitely make again. Next time I will use a 14oz can of diced tomatoes and an extra can of beef broth. Tomato flavor was a little too overpowering otherwise was a good hearty soup.

This soup is amazing!  
I didn't have the  beef broth so I  did 5 and half cups water and 5 tsp beef  bouillon.  I also didn't have condensed  tomato soup so I  added canned tomato basil soup.  So GOOD!!

I made this soup using some of the alterations suggested by other reviewers--doubled the garlic and used beef broth (half low-sodium and half regular) instead of water. I also used one can of regular tomatoes and one of cilantro-lime tomatoes, and added half of a green pepper.  The flavor was bright and intense, and we appreciated all of the veggies, yet I thought it definitely lacked something.  Froze the leftovers and will try adding onion and garlic powder to them, and perhaps adding tiny bit of salt.

Made a hybrid of this recipe and "Hamburger Soup I" 
(also from this site) threw in some baby portobellos and peas.  Definitely hearty and good.  Added salt to taste.

I had a hamburger soup recipe that I misplaced. Enter Allrecipes. This recipe is very similar to the one I had from years. ago. What I love most about both is that they are very adaptable. I browned my lean ground beef first - 1.5 lbs with garlic and half an onion and worcestershire sauce. In a separate saute pan, I sauteed tthe carrots, celery and the remaining onion. I like a chunky soup so I chopped all the veggies. Once cooked, I combined both into my crock pot and added the remaining ingredients. I used all beef broth - no water. Set the crock pot on high for two hours, then low for another 6. In the last couple hours, I did a taste test and adjusted the flavour with salt and pepper as needed. I also added corn at this point. The house smelled amazing. I've been waiting all summer to make this amazing, hearty fall soup.  Oh yeah, I omitted the tomato soup and used tomato paste and Manwich sauce instead.  Yes, this soup freezes very well and my partner doesn't hesitate in bringing left overs to work. Bon appetit!

I've made this twice. Once as written, and once instead of barley I used cabbage. Both were great. My vegetable-hating son even had seconds. All I changed was I added a little garlic and onion powder.

Delicious! My fiance raved about this one, and I did too. If you don't mind the barley swelling up in the leftovers, keep as is. Otherwise prepare barley separately.  I liked the original as it became a thick stew in the leftover stage, hearty and even tastier.

This was very good.  I made it almost as written, however, I did not have tomato soup, so i added some tomato paste to add a little thickness to the soup.  I also used ground turkey because I didn't have ground beef.  It was tasty.

This was a nice hearty soup for the family.  I increased the barley to 1 cup, and in tasting it before serving, thought it needed something, so added 1 tsp. basil.

Loved it, as did everyone I've ever served it to. You can add more or less veg, I usually follow recipe quite closely but usually add additional pearl barley and also Worcestershire sauce.  But.. If you don't have carrots, you can add beans or potatoes, etc, that's the beauty of it. Thick and delicious with fresh biscuits or bread, makes a meal!

I made this for my father-in-law when he was in the hospital and simply wanted some homemade comfort food.  He  had and enjoyed his portion and my family had the rest.  It is very simple to make and I followed the recipe to the letter except for doubling the garlic.  It is now a family favourite.

I added approx. 2 tbsp. of Bragg Soy Mixture and approx. 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. The end result was fantastic!

This was good but not great.  It was easy to make.  But it did not have a hearty flavor as I had expected.  The flavor of the ground beef was barely noticeable.  I may make it again but I would look for other recipes first.

Next time I might substitute the tomato soup with tomato paste. I would add the paste with the onions to brown it a bit. I will definitely make it again.

Loved this it filled the crock pot, cooked on high for close to 5 hours, only thickened a bit because of the veg & meat, but still lots of broth which was great, we didn't want a chili or stew just wanted a beefy soup. Everyone loved it.

You will be surprised when you taste the final results of this wonderful soup. I had several bowls and so did my husband. He commented  "this is very good, let's have another bowl and so we did." This recipe will stay in my rotation of different soups that I make and new ones that I try. Thanks Sharilee, great recipe.

The soup was pretty good, I added some garlic powder and seasoned salt to the chopped sirloin while browning it for some extra flavor.  Only modifications I made and suggest is to put 6 cups total beef broth, omit water and add 1 cup total of barley in the soup.

Very good!  I added a few items that I like such as a diced red bell pepper, 1/2 cup of Cabernet, and a couple tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce.  I did not have tomato soup so I used 3 ounces of tomato paste and a teaspoon of sugar.  I also upped the barley to 3/4 cup.  Brought up to a boil and then into the crock pot on high from 2 hours and on low for 2 more. I garnished with shredded sharp cheddar.

This recipe sounded so good doubled it (except for the chopped meat, did not fully double that.)  Glad I did, we loved it and look forward to having more!

Perfect cold weather soup/comfort food.   Most of us have the ingredients on hand and no problem if you want to add some extras like more veggies, barley or broth or tomato soup.

When time is short, to speed prep you can buy already diced celery, onion and cut carrots.
Great recipe,  Thanks!

I made this according to the recipe and I really liked it... at lot!   And my husband absolutely loved it.  The recipe made enough for two suppers for my husband and me with enough left over for a lunch serving.  I served it piping hot with a side of crusty bread.

Didn't have a can of tomato soup so omitted it. All else was same as recipe but after browning meat and onion cooked it 4 hours on high in a slow cooker. It turned out very good. I would make it again as so.

I am not a canned soup fan.  Instead of the tomato soup ingredient, I left it out and substituted about 2 T of tomato paste instead.  It seemed to do the trick.  I also included almost a cup's worth of barley which was great, though it required me to add more water to the soup.  Don't know how much I used exactly, just more to make it not look like sloppy joe filling.  With my minor changes, I would give it five stars.

This was WAY more tomato based than I like, next time I will double the beef broth and delete the large can of tomatoes, just use the can of soup.  It really needs to be cooked in a crock pot to have the flavours meld properly.

Came out like soupy bolognese, people were polite, but not a hit.

It was much better than it looked!  For the 1st time ever I had no thyme. So I sniffed the other herbs on the shelf and decided marjoram and tarragon smelled like they should go in. Can't tell you how much much marjoram, but several shakes. Only a pinch of tarragon. It was really great. Had a little tang to it. No salt at all. I would have liked to have the soup cook down more, but my husband came in sniffing the air and insisted we needed to eat right then. I stopped him at the 3rd huge bowlful.

Doubled the recipe.  Added even more beef broth to thin it out.  When I tasted final product I found that it needed more salt.  But I love that because people can salt to taste!  Thank you!  It was enjoyable to make and fun to serve with tasty cornbread!

Just put together this soup a couple of hours ago and already the broth tastes excellent! I sauteed some onion and garlic in a little butter for a few minutes before browning the hamburger.   I used a large can of Red Gold crushed tomatoes and believe it or not that's all I needed.  I also added a bag of frozen mixed veggies as that's what my H likes in a vegetable soup.  The water was beef stock and I added the bay leaf and a small amount of thyme.  I ALWAYS add a tad bit of sugar, especially if the recipe includes tomatoes as it brings out the flavors AND cuts down on the acidity.   So far, I can already tell this is going to be an excellent soup.  Thanks so much for the recipe!! A real KEEPER!

I followed the recipe exactly this time and will make it again.  However, my grocer carried medium or small barley only; I purchased medium and would increase the amount of barley by half or even double.  I might also try omitting the barley and using a can or two of cannelini beans, drained and rinsed, instead.

I made this soup yesterday.  My only issue is it's too much tomato for my taste.  Should have followed my instincts. Next time I will alter the tomato as I like the broth to taste like beef or chicken broth.

Perfect for a Snowzilla lunch. I used ground lamb and added some smoked paprika a cayenne to boost the heat flavor. So good, I am making it again for an office lunch

Made it as stated, but had some potatoes so added a few.  Also added more barley and veggies  for something a little thicker, but didn't compensate enough on the liquid for added ingredients. I'll make this again, but will add another can of broth to the pot. Tastes awesome eaten with crackers!

Made this and took advantage of some items in the pantry Turned out so good, its all gone now. Didn't have any barley in the house. Had lentils and used them in like amount. We like beef so in addition to the ground beef, I added stewing beef and then added a can of sliced mushrooms.
Next time I think some diced potatoes would also be a nice addition.

This hit the spot on a winter day! I do agree with some other reviewers that I want a "hearty" soup to be a little thicker. I added potatoes, lentils, mushrooms, corn - items that pick up well from what's around them, but don't really alter the basic flavor profile themselves.

It was good.  I only had a 14 oz. can of tomatoes and I think that was good.  Double would have been too much tomato for us.  I added potatoes and used beef bouillon cubes instead of broth.   I'll make it again but it will not be our favorite.

One of the most delicious soups I have made -- and I make a lot of good soup! Followed the recipe precisely. Hadn't cooked with barley before, and it was a nice change from the pasta, rice or potatoes I usually add as a thickener. Perfectly named "hearty," as both my guys commented. We enjoyed it with sourdough bread on a grey January night. Mmmmm....

I used crushed tomatoes and found when reheating that adding more water makes the soup go longer without taking away from the flavor.

Love this soup.  I have made it maybe 4 times and I have now forgone the barley and served with bow-tie pasta placed in the bowl and ladling the soup on top, also tried potatoes which was equally great.  I also like my soups with lots of veggies so I added them chunky and in larger quantities.  Extra broth is also helpful.  This recipe is a keeper.

Very good soup, perfect for a cold night. I tasted it right after mixing it up and was a little worried because it tasted a lot like a can of tomato soup with vegetables in it, but after it simmered for 2 hours, there was just a nice blend of flavors so it  didn't taste at all like just a can of condensed soup with carrots chopped up in it. It really was very yummy and leftovers the next day were just as good.

A fairly easy recipe to make.  I ended up using two cans of tomato sauce because I didn't have condensed soup or diced tomatoes.  It turned out awesome.  It was a huge hit with my girlfriend.  I also added about 50% more ground beef than it calls for because I needed to use what I had left in the freezer before it went bad.  No regrets!

It's exactly how I remember it tasting. I didn't change any ingredients especially the thyme as it gives it that unique taste. It's hearty. It's healthy. Best for the rainy fall days.

loved the soup.  I used fresh garden tomatoes , two garlic cloves, and added mushrooms. After reading the reviews, I doubled the thyme and added more barley. A great hearty soup for a fall evening.

We loved loved loved this soup!  My husband is not a soup lover like me so I wasn't sure how much he would eat (or even try).  I made the pot of soup on Saturday morning and let it simmer for a few hours.  We had it for lunch & supper on Saturday, ate it for supper on Sunday and finished it up on Monday for supper.  He loved it and I couldn't believe it!  I followed the recipe to a T but I added 1 tablespoon of sugar to cut the acid on the tomatoes; made a world of difference.  Also I sliced the carrots; not minced.  We will definitely make this one again & again!  Thanks!

My family absolutely loved this soup!  It has become our new favourite soup, so I will absolutely make it again!  It is hearty enough for a main meal, especially with the addition of some cooked pasta such as farfale or wagon wheels just before serving.  If you put the uncooked pasta into the soup to cook before serving, the it just swells up and sucks up all the juice, and then it is too thick, especially if there are any leftovers. It is so flexible, that pretty much any addition , such as corn kernels, a can of black beans or some chopped cabbage also work, and changes things around a bit.  Also, I like to add some cayenne pepper to my portion (hubby doesn't like spicy very much) for a perfect winter's meal.

I have to make this at least 3 times a month.. Because the family love love loves it! Only thing I changed was I added a little more barley which meant I had to add more beef broth and tomato juice so that it stayed juicy..

This was good .  Had to make a couple of subs , due to what we had .  No garlic in the house , so subbed garlic powder . 1/2 tsp. , and was fine . Only 1 can of tomatoes , and they were stewed , not diced .  Fine as well.  A little too much thyme for us , so will cut it back next time .  Needed some salt , fixed easily at the table .  Will make again . Thank you .

Made it for a potluck lunch.  Followed one suggestion and made very small meatballs rather than just the ground beef.  Had several people compliment me on how nice it was to have the meatballs in it.

My family and i love this soup, always goes fast.   Only thing I do different is cook the onion and garlic with the beef in the beginning.    Amazing. I have been making 1-2times a month for years.

Love this recipe! I make it all the time.  I use beef consommé instead of broth. I like lots of veggies and mix it up occasionally by adding frozen green beans, corn and lima beans! Goes great with a grilled cheese sandwich. Yummy!

Hmmmm, whats in the pantry?? LOL, I had crushed tomato instead of diced and didnt have any tomato soup or beef stock soooooo: Crushed tomato, water and beef bullion (that's beef broth, more or less)and omit the soup. Added a green pepper because I had one and used a bit more 'burger than the recipe called for. This came out really good, even the picky eaters noshed down on it. Served it with grated parm cheese and hot pepper flakes on the side with some nice home made garlic bread. I think if I omit the barley and used macaroni elbows it would be exactly like my mom used to make.

This is an excellent recipe.  Very easy to put together and very, very tasty.  Since we are lovers of barley we doubled the amount.  We were also out of beef broth so I substituted Au Jus.  Worked really well.

Very simple but comforting meal. I didn't have barley, so did without. I added extra seasonings for flavor as recommended by other reviews. Before serving, I added steamed brown rice into each bowl. Tasted better the next day. Next time I will make corn bread to include with our meal.

I followed this recipe pretty closely with only a few minor changes.  I used just 1 lb. of ground beef, a full cup of barley and instead of water and beef broth, I used three 14.5 oz. cans of beef broth.  This produced a very chunky, hearty soup, just as the title suggests. For me this yielded about 13 cups of soup.  But even after letting the flavors meld in the fridge until the next day, it didn’t wow me.  Good, but not great.

Very good. We were surprised at how good this is. Chopped veggies in chunks as we like chunky soup. Also cooked for less time to keep veggies chrunchy.

I pretty much followed this recipe as is but did not have the tomato soup on hand. I added some other vegetables I had that needed to be used (some leftover corn and a small zucchini I chopped) and it was delicious.

Pretty good.  Very easy.  Had to make some changes (ingredients on hand).  I used 3 carrots, 2 cloves garlic, 1 cup pearl barley, 8 cups beef stock (no water, soup, canned stock), 2 bay leaves and salt.  Needed salt.  Otherwise pretty great start.  Also added 3/4 cup frozen peas about an hour or so in.  Thanks for the recipe

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't wonderful either. It seemed like the besics were good, but the taste needed something. Also, the 1/2 C barley wasn't nearly enough. 1 heaping cup would be better.

What a terrific recipe!!  Absolutely delicious, very satisfying, and a wonderful blend of simple spices. And so easy to throw together!!  The only thing I did differently was to chop the vegetables instead of mincing.  Wonderful!

Very good!!  I didn't have thyme so I used basil instead.  I also added some minced garlic in with the veggies.  This will become a regular in our dinner rotation!  It was thick, hearty, filling and tasty!!

Not a bad recipe but it has too little seasoning for my taste. It definitely needs more seasoning as written. I'm also gluten-intolerant so make appropriate changes to take the gluten out: replace the tomato soup with tomato sauce and use potato instead of barley. Also of course, I use gluten-free broth. Other than that I double the seasonings except bay leaf and use all broth rather than water.

What is so great about this soup is how easy it is to make and how great it tastes!  I fried up the hamburger, drained it, and tossed it in the slow cooker with all the other ingredients on low for about 8 hours. Yum!

Delicious!~ Made a few minor changes for increased flavor and gave it 5 stars! Substituted vegetable juice for water and added in 1/2 packet beefy onion soup seasoning packet. Kids even came back for seconds - Now that's saying something! Enjoy!

This soup was more like a chilli and very bland but for the ingredients it was good. I ended up adding basil, more barley like other reviews suggested and instead of tomatoe soup I used tomatoe paste. My 2 year old daughter loves it so in my eyes it was a success. I gave this a 3 star just because it was bland.

Absolutely delicious, especially on the 2nd day! I made as directed, however had only a 15 oz can diced tomatoes and a 15 oz diced tomatoes with green chilies. Super soup! A bit spicy the first day, but got more mellow the next day. Will make this one over and over again. Thanks for a fabulous, healthy soup recipe!

I added a few things like the others.  I had 1/2 a fennel bulb so chopped it and added it with the veggies.  I too added potato and 2 grated zucchini. For spices I added basil and oregano.  It was yummy!!!  The kids sprinkled it with freshly grated parm. And we served crusty rolls.

Just made this soup today. It was fantastic. I added about 2lbs of ground beef and 3/4 cups of barley. I also added more garlic and some worstchire sauce for a bit of zing.  This really made a lot. A complete meal.

I made this for a weekend family visit. I used very lean ground beef. I thought that I had barley in the pantry, but it was actually bulgar. It did not change the flavor at all. Great, healthy recipe. The family enjoyed.

Okay base soup.  Use beef broth instead of water.  Added fresh onion and garlic to browned ground beef.  Also added a handful of peas.  I'd recommend adding more barley if you really like barley like me.  Omitted bay leaf, tomato soup, and thyme.  Used a bit of dried basil.    I can see adding beans, or noodles instead of barley.

this soup was really really good! My husband was feeling really sick, and this soup made him feel so much better! I used rice instead of the barley, and didn't add in the celery, but followed the rest of the recipe and it was great! Definitely a keeper, it was so easy too!

I had this soup at my sister-in-law's last week & it was so good I asked her for the recipe.  It is the same as this one except it calls for 3 cans of consomme instead of the beef broth.  I also like my vegetables chunky so I diced them instead of minced.  I made this yesterday in my crock pot.  Yummy!!

Used a little barley than called for but otherwise followed exactly.  Very good but could have used a bit more seasoning, little bland, will make again with some additional spices.

We really liked this - I used spicy turkey sausage instead of hamburger because that is all I had in the freezer.  Also increased the barley because we love it.  Very filling and perfect for a cold winter night.  Thanks for sharing!

I love this soup!  It's healthy and so tasty!  I add another 1/2 cup of barley and use 1lb of ground turkey in place of the beef!  So good!

This soup was just not as good as I was expecting. I think the recipe is missing salt and some depth of flavor. To try to improve the recipe,  I seasoned my meat with both salt and pepper while browning it, and I also used all broth. Didn't do the trick. I won't be making it again, sorry to say.

This is fabulous!  I end up salting this recipe.  I also use a cornstarch & water mixture to thicken it.  I serve with sweet cornbread.  I am asked for the recipe every time I serve it.

My family really enjoyed this soup. I used 24 oz. of frozen veggies and 10 minute quick cook barley and this was ready in no time. The flavor was good and the leftovers were wonderful.

Yes!! This is the BEST hamburger soup.  I consider myself an accomplished soup maker, and have made other versions that included cabbage and/or zuchinni.  They were soggy with not the best flavour.  I used leftover cooked brown rice in this soup and it plumped up like barley and retained a nice bite.  This is definitely a keeper.  My 10 year old loves it and sprinkled it with a bit of grated parmesan.  Thank you Sharilee!

Hearty, good comfort soup!!! No changes to recipe other than doubling up on the herbs/spices. Well worth the wait of 2 hrs to eat - would suggest waiting as the flavours really come together. Eat it earlier, & I'm sure the flavour would be less scrumptious.
