Recipe is what it says a french fry potato with a slight "buttery crunchy coating." I followed the ingredients minus the black pepper. I cut the potatoes each into 8-10 potato wedges, and they did still take the full 40 minutes. And, I baked them on a foil lined sheet. I did half the recipe and it fit the whole baking sheet. I would say the full recipe would be more like 6 servings though. Interesting recipe! And, I wonder if my grandpa ate a french fry like these in the the Navy in WWII? Happy Veterans's Day though! And, thank you to all who have served this country.

Very good potato wedges! I used seasoned salt and added onion powder & garlic powder. 400 degrees for 40 mins flipping half way through.

Very easy and surprisingly good.  I added a bit of cajun spice to the flour and it worked really well.

These are really good fries! I add other seasonings to the flour though, such as cajun seasoning, season salt, etc.

Really good! I added an all purpose spice to the flour as other reviewers have and I did find my cookie sheet warped a bit during the cooking and some of the butter browned and the fries got pretty dark but DH preferred those so I guess it all worked out. Just keep a close eye out as the butter can burn before you know it.

This is a good recipe. I added Cajun spices and extra paprika in the flour mix. It gave it a good taste. I also used the air fryer. Y’all, this was yum yum good!!!!! I heated up the next day in the air fryer and it tasted even better the next day and more crunchy. Air fryer for life!

Love love LOVE this recipe. So versatile too. Added a bit of smoked paprika and a smidge of dill. Kids came back for seconds...and thirds.

I made this tonight, and thought it was very good. It took awhile to prepare and cook, but I'll do it again as it was a great side dish.

My family really enjoyed these. I used white rice flour and used margarine because I was out of butter. They were tender & crispy.  Cooked on parchment and turned part way through.

I’ve tried making these several times. First time following recipe exactly then alternatives for follow up attempts (less flour, more spices, precook potatoes in boiling water halfway). I really wanted this recipe to work, but no success. They just taste like uncooked flour to me. Might be ok if I could deep fry them, but I don’t have access to deep fryer on a boat.

Easy and if you slice a little thinner you can easily have it done in 15-20 minutes. If you just want simple potatoes with a little crunch and butter flavor hard to beat. Thanks!

I used Emeril's Essence to give them more flavor.  I did not try them but hubby said they were ok for a change but he would just as soon have a baked potato so they won't be worth the effort again.
