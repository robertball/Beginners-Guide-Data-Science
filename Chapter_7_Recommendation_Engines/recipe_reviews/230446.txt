The cookies looked good and instead of spicy candies I used licorice. Unfortunately my cookies stuck and wouldn t come off. I would next time use aluminum foil instead. I. Tasted them thought and they were wonderful!

Delicious and very sweet. But it s really hard to form a wreath when the stuff is sticking to your fingers AND it s hot!? Yes I buttered my fingers but that just didn t do it. So instead of wreathes I now have the rare and elusive phoenix nest which has three little red hot eggs.? I would not recommend meeting making this with children. It would make a complete and utter disastrous mess. Unless of course you don t mind having sticky Green marshmallow goo everywhere including their hair.?
