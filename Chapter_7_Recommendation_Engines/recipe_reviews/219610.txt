This is an easy but elegant recipe.  If you don't let the water/sugar boil for a couple of minutes, you will get runny sauce.  You can also add grated orange peel for a tangy zest.

This was very easy. It was not too strong. Everybody loved it. Just remember to boil it long enought for it to be thick.

Prefer no stars on this one.  Never congealed.  Super watery.  I expected it to be like jello.  Was I expecting too much?

I loved this recipee.  I boiled  it longer to make sure it set and for fun I added a peeled, diced apple.

So  this review is a little late because I have been making this recipe every holiday since I first found it about six years ago. It's been a big hit at every holiday gathering. I never really liked cranberry sauce before but I was asked to bring some to a family gathering, found this recipe and it is so good. I let the cranberries cook a little longer and I find it helps it to thicken a bit more. Let it set in the fridge over night and the consistency is perfect.

There are a few small issues I had with this recipe. It does not tell you how to use the ginger and cinnamon stick. I chopped the ginger in small pieces and took the cinnamon stick out before putting into a dish.  I added a little bit of orange zest. The sauce at first seems very sweet, but the orange leaves a good after note. overall, sauce came out good.

This is delicious.  Like the other reviewers mentioned, it needs to be boiled till it thickens up, but once it does, it's truly delicious.  I used a few dashes of grated cinnamon instead of a cinnamon stick and added a splash or orange juice.

Love it! I added a bit of orange extract to give it a kick(as i have no oranges in the house) and it turned out wonderfully! The only thing is that i'd say it needs to cook more than 5 minutes - i think it took me almost 10 - to get a good consistency. That might just be my preference, though.
