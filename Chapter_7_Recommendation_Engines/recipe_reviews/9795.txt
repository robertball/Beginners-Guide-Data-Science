Being a British expat I hoped these would taste like the Digestive Biscuits I miss so much, but NO. Maybe they would be good with butter and cheese as a cracker rather than a biscuit.

Definitely not McVities Digestives, but if you're not comparing them to the store bought cookie, they're pretty good. They have a wholesome, slightly sweet taste with a bit of a grainy texture. On the downside, they were very difficult to roll out, as the dough is very sticky! I refrigerated my dough to help out with the stickiness, but still needed lots of dusting flour. I would make again.

This is the best recipe for digestive biscuits I have tried, and I have tried quite a few!! The flavour and texture is perfect.

These are delicious and easy to make.  I substituted flax seed meal and water for the eggs and even then, they were delicious.  The only suggestion I would make is to make a double batch because they will disappear fast!

Brit in US- Good Start but not quite there yet. Not at all like store bought. I would like to see this alot lighter & flakier like a true digestive biscuit.  I used stone cut oatmeal which may acct. for the density, next time I'll try w rolled quick oats Next I would try with pastry flour & all ingredients cold to see if that makes a difference. WHO WOULDN"T WANT A GOOD DIGESTIVE BISCUIT! WILLING TO WORK ON THIS!! THRILLED TO HAVE FOUND THIS AS A BASE TO WORK FROM.

Didn't taste like the "digestive" cookie I'm used to.  I guess I shouldn't compare but it wasn't what I had expected.

After reading other reviews, I creamed the butter and sugar, added the dry ingredients and added just enough milk to get it to hold together, about 3 Tbsps. The cookies were crispy, but not chewy.

Relatively bland, and not like store-bought biscuits at all. Sort of a basic wheat flour cookie. Simple and easy to make, but not what you would expect from a digestive biscuit.

I found these fairly bland, a tad tough (but oddly chewy too), but then, I was hoping for something that tasted like McVitie's Digestive Biscuits.  These were entirely different.

I dipped in chocolate and then in finely crused walnuts to try to save them.

The biscuits had a nice crunch to them and a coating of dark chocolate really brought out the flavour.

Tasty! My batter was sticky and loose, like cookie dough, so I found it odd kneading it and rolling it out, basically I nearly doubled the flour just because I had to keep adding flour to keep it from sticking to my table and rolling pin. Nonetheless, came out good. I couldnt resist being a fat American and adding choc chips to half, but I have to say it's better as a bland-ish cookie rather than with the chips. The key is to bake it til it's really golden brown and crispy, those were the best. Also add some flaky salt on top, they needed it. Lets reclaim the cookie as a "digestive" health food!!

We have always wanted to try to make our own Dark Chocolate Digestive Biscuits and these turned out good, we kept very close to the recipe and give 4 stars, we will now try again and play a bit with the ingredients, a shorter cooking time, and we are sure we can give 5 star Rating.

These cookies hit the spot when I was looking for a not-too-sweet cookie to have with my tea. Yes, a trifle chewy, but good crunch too. I like 'em!!! (I used 1/2 all purpose flour, 1/2 barley flour, and they turned out great.)

Good biscuit, just like a McVities.  Caramel and milk chocolate make a great topping!

I thought these cookies were great!  I rolled them out and cut them into whales and dolphins for a business lecture at a whaling museum and they flew off the plate!  (My pets loved them too!)  I made some with a peanut butter glaze, and those were great too.

Great biscuits. I used more sugar than in the recipe. I just used any old flour. When they were finished I scattered chocolate on top and left the tray in the oven.

Fantastic!
Different from store bought, but very nice with a cup of tea!
(I substituted the butter and milk with vegan alternatives - they are great!)

They looked pretty and were fun to make, but didn't taste like digestives at all.
