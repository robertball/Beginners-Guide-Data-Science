I made these cookies for a cookie exchange and I thought they were terrible.  I followed this recipe to "the tee."  I even used the Rolos.  First of all, they take longer to make than 15 minutes.  Second, if you try to cook them for 15 minutes they will burn for sure.  Third, they come out too dry and tasteless once you finally figure out the real cooking time.  And fourth, the only suprise you'll find in the middle is a piece of rock hard carmel that you can hardly bite into.  I do not recommend this recipe at all.

The cookie was a little dry but really tasty.  I suggest using Nestle Treasure because the Rolo carmel was too hard. I also rolled the finished cookie in some confectioners' sugar. The dough works great as a roll out cookie, too!

YUMMY!  We are a sweet eating family and they loved these cookies! This recipe is so easy that I made over a hundred cookies for my class and people were fighting over them! These cookies are so buttery.  Instead of plain yellow cake mix I used the golden butter cake mix. You will ENJOY!

There may be a mistake in this recipie - if made exactly to instructions, it didn't form a dough - I added 3/4 cup water and they came out great !!
The kids loved them ! Will make these again

This recipe did not work out at all. It is unclear whether you are supposed to make the cake mix and then put it in with the mixture or if you just add the mix without the other ingredients. It did not work out at all.

They were far from terrible, butI thought they were too dry & crumbly - others liked them.  I probably won't try them again.

This recipe was GREAT!  I am not a baker, by any means, but this recipe made Christmas baking pain-free and enjoyable.  After rolling the cookie, I sprinkled them with green and red crystal decorating sugars before baking them and they looked VERY festive!  Couldn't have been easier.  This is a recipe I will use again and again and is now a favorite of mine!

This was the worst recipe that we have ever tried in our baking group.  We tried chocolate coated caramel chips instead of rolo chocolates.  The cookies were dry and crumbled up when you take a bite.  Do not try this one!

I made these cookies using the left over Halloween milk duds and they turned out great.  It is important to cook them until almost dry or they will be greasy. When cooked properly they resemble buttery shortbread.

These cookies were a hit with a group that I usually make chocolate rolo cookies for.  The cookie is dry like a shortbread, just a little sweeter.  I also made them without the rolo and they were great.  A lemon cake mix and I have lemon coolers.  A great surprise.  Thank you!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I shared the cookies with neighbors and they loved them too. 
  I like how easy it was to mix up. My children helped make these.

I just tried to make these cookies and they turned out great.  I did add 2 eggs to the recipe to make them a little more moist.  I also used miniature rolos.  I did end up refrigerating the dough and that seemed to make it a lot easier to roll up and get the candy in the middle of the cookie.  Unfortunately I was making them to take to a school party and had to make a second batch since we had company while I was baking.  They were really good.  Not to sweet but sweet enough.
