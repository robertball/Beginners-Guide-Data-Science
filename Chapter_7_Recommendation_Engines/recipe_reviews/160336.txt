If you love bacon and blue cheese, then this salad is for you! A great combination of flavors! I used regular Worcestershire and also rubbed the steaks with a little minced garlic.  I lightly scored them and grilled vs. pan frying in bacon grease. I used a combination of bagged salad greens and added my own mix of veggies - cherry tomatoes, thin sliced red onion, and thin sliced cucumber. I also added a little sliced avocado and croutons vs. the extra Cheddar cheese then drizzled with homemade Blue Cheese dressing. Perfect for dinner!

This is what I have for dinner when the rest of the family want hot dogs! So easy, such amazing flavour. I used a mixture of baby romaine and mache greens, and I omitted the cheddar. I will try this with crumbled goat cheese in ADDITION to the blue cheese, as well. Pair it with a hearty Zinfandel or Cabernet Sauvignon, and your taste buds will thank you!

I cut the recipe down to 2 servings and made 2 individual salads.  What seemed like a lot of meat and cheese turned out to be the perfect amount.  Not too much, not too little.  I made my own blue cheese dressing using the recipe for "Absolutely the Best Rich and Creamy Blue Cheese Dressing" from this site.   My husband loved it!   I prefer a little more depth to my salads like onions, tomatoes, olives, etc., and found that additional toppings only enhances the flavor rather than distracts from it.

Excellent! I marinated my meat all day, and was glad that I did, as it had a wonderful flavor and was very tender. I also added hard-boiled eggs, red onion and tomatoes. The family raved over this...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

If you want to make this salad even easier, just use the European salad mix.  I didn't have Worcestershire sauce, but it turned out fine without it.  It was a hit, especially with the blue cheese!

Good recipe.  Didn't want to use steak, so I replaced with fresh mushrooms, sliced and stir fried in the pan used for bacon, drizzled with worcestershire sauce while cooking. Also you don't need blue cheese ready-made sauce.  Just add blue cheese and milk in a small blender and make sure it doesn't get too thick.

This is excellent!  We used a london broil and grilled it vs. stove top pan frying.  Seasoned the same way.  I also used two different kinds of bagged lettuces - iceberg shreds and a baby mix with red and spinach.  This will be a regular in our house.  To cut calories/fat I used a "light chunky" bleu cheese dressing and reduced fat cheddar cheese.

Wonderful salad! I marinated the steak for 2 hours before grilling it. I also used a homemade blue cheese dressing that topped this dish off beautifully!!!

Next time, we'll use a different dressing - it was a little too "blue-cheesy" so we'll swap it with a balsamic or something lighter. Everything else; the steak and lettuce recommendation was great!

Used flap meat instead of flat iron and added cilantro as garnish. Fantastic and so easy!
