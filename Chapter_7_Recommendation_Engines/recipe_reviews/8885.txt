This was ok. Lacked flavor and ended up on the mushy side. I won't make it again.

This recipe seemed a little plain so about 10 minutes before it was done, I added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables. It thickened by itself and no flour was needed. This turned out great and is one of my new favorites.

I really liked this recipe because it was a whole meal in one skillet. Next time I make it I will add the carrots early because they were still slightly undone eventhough the potatoes were REALLY done. It would also be a good idea to remove the chicken and the vegetables before adding the flour water mixture to make the gravy. My potatoes got really mushy when I was mixing in the flour and water.

This was really good.  I only had a 3 lb. perdue oven roaster, so I stuffed the roaster with stuffing, added all of the rest of the ingredients and baked it in the oven.  My husband loves when I make potatoes like this.  Thanks Doreen, for an easy recipe!

great recipe, and great for leftovers as well. I made herb dumplings for the top of mine. Added some peas during the last 10min or so, probably about 2teaspoons of poultry seasoning, and used 2T of butter(rather than 1 and 1 oil) I used 2 very large leeks,2 celery, just the white parts, and to be honest, if you cut it small enough, you'd never know there was leek in there! Everyone cleans off their plate, almost to the licking stage. Try to cut your veggies large as you would stew. (2inch potatoes,, and evenly. Carrots seem to take the longest to cook! I mistakenly added the flour to the broth (well stirred), it was nice and thick! Would make again. Its sort of like a cross between a stew and the inside of potpie :P Love the big chicken breasts rather than cubes, as you get a full cut-able serving of meat, rather than meat fibers disintegrating in the liquid.

I found this recipe when I everyone was hungry and I didn't have anything planned for dinner. I did an ingredient search and found it.  It was quick and easy and everyone was happy.  I didn't have herbed chicken broth so I used regular and added some thyme and sage.  Also no leeks, but it turned out just fine.  Because I was in a hurry I cut the chicken in half and used ready to eat carrots.  I cooked it in my electric skillet for about 20 minutes.  I am adding this to my collection. Delicious.  Thank you Doreen!

This was easy to make and really good.  My husband ate it without a complaint.  That doesn't happen often!  I added some mix on top toward the end for dumplings too.  Will definitely make again.

I can't believe I've actually found a dinner that my 7-year-old and 12-year-old
both like!  It was so easy and quick to make; it's a great dish to make rushing
home from football practice, before homework, baths and bedtime!  They
both told me to put it on my "make again" list.  Even my youngest ate his
carrots.  The gravy did the trick!

I made this tonight after finding it through an ingredients search.  However, I didn't have carrots or a leek.  I substituted asparagus and large green onions.  I also used fresh parsley instead of dried.  I found the dish to have a wonderfully light flavor.  My son couldn't seem to stop complimenting the meal.

This was super easy to make.  This recipe is a different twist on some old fashioned comfort food--fast.  That's what I would recommend it for.

This recipie is good and filling but could use a little more flavor...we added snow peas at the very end so they were cooked crisp not mushy.  Maybe some broccoli or anything green for added flavor and color!

I made this with turkey kielbasa, and it was awesome!  Used white wine in place of the water, 1/2 cup extra chicken broth, 1 1/2 tsp. of herbs de provence, and a whole bay leaf instead of crushed.  I can't wait to try this with other meats!

Most of the family found this recipe very good but I think it requrires a couple of additional ingredients/seasoning.   I definitely will be asked to make this recipe again.

We really liked this.  My two year old loved the carrots.  I used a homemade chicken stock flavored with salt, pepper, thyme, rosemary, and oregano.  I didn't have any potatoes or bay leaves and only had 2 chicken breasts but still loved it and will include those items next time.  The portions seemed too small -- I would double the recipe next time.  And maybe add some sauteed mushrooms.  Overall, really good and easy!

A family favorite!!!  I do add the potatoes about 15-20 mins later and let it simmer a bit longer.  I also use green onions more seasoning and tonight i tried some celery seed.  Certainly an easy hearty meal to make!! and alternative to beef stew!! Chicken skillet stew

This is a great dish!! Very easy to prepare and very tasty. I did not have herb flavored chicken broth, I used regular chicken broth instead and it worked out very well. I added a little adoba spice and some extra pepper and salt. A keeper, I added it my recipe box.

Maybe my potatoes were too big, or my skillet was too shallow, but it just didn't work out. It was rather bland, and with a strange consistency, kind of gloppy.

I'm adding this one to my recipe rotation for sure!  Very easy.  I used garlic powder instead of fresh, white wine instead of water, and regular chicken broth.  I don't tend to have leeks on hand, so I sliced in a whole onion.

The kids loved it, although I thought it lacked flavor. Next time I will try substituting brocolli or green beans as other reviewers have suggested, and adding more spices. We had this with homemade rolls to sop up the gravy... yummy!

I followed this recipe pretty close, but omited onions and leeks(can't eat) amd added celery instead.  I also used red potatoes and used just chicken broth instead of water also.  Was a HUGE hit with my 10yr old, 2yr old and my husband.  This is a keeper!!!

I thought this would be an easy recipe to try. It was, however, it lacked any flavor at all. I tried adding other seasings since it was so BLAND, but it was a loss.

This recipe was YUM! It is kinda like having stew without all the broth! Veggies and chicken are tender and flavorful. Use a yellow onion and get GREAT sweet flavor! I was worried at first about the potatoes and carrots not cooking. Have no fear it comes out wonderful!

It's a good dish to make and extremely easy.  Insructions are detailed and that's good.  It's good served over brown rice.  Use 1 1/4 tsp. Provencal herbs instead of a bay leaf and the difference is there but it tastes great.

I was looking for a new chicken dish, and came across this one.  I didn't have carrots and I did substitute broccoli, but this dish was a huge hit with my husband.  I will be making this again for sure!

I made this for my husband this evening and he really enjoyed it.  I was out of potatoes so used rice instead and it still turned out really good.  A good solid tasty, easy recipes.  By the way, the name is appropirate  for my husband.  He is a mechanic.

This is a good weeknight dinner recipe.  It is definately worth trying.  Use your largest skillet to have enough room for all the veggies.  I did not thicken the broth at the end as it had thickend on its own.  My family enjoyed it!

I don't have any kids at home any more but I am sure they would love it as much as my husband did.  Hardly had any reason to wash his dish it was so clean. Great recipe.  Tasty and quick to put together.

I  took the advice of some other reviews and added additional seasonings such as poultry seasoning and lemon pepper. Very tasty and easy comfort food.

I made this for my 3 children. Only I used broc. it was all I had. I added onion and garlic powder. A little red pepper flakes, more fresh garlic. I had to remove the chicken and broc. out of the pan. The potatos were not done. But once I add it all back my kids and I loved. I will make this again w/ broc & carrots.OH I add more broth cause I served it over rice.

I was looking for a recipe for boneless chicken breasts and tried this one.  Didn't have leeks or herbed chicken broth.  Omitted the leeks and added chicken broth with my own herbs (dried parsley, basil and thyme).  Added salt as well.  Also used new (red) potatoes.  Came out pretty good, like a beef stew with chicken instead of beef.  I would like to try adding either fresh broccoli or green beans with the potatoes and carrots next time.
