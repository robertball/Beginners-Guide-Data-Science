Reduced the Irish cream to 1/4 cup, added 1/4 cup of Kahlua plus 2 oz. of vodka. Sprinkled Heath toffee bits on top. Served in 2 oz. lidded condiment cups. Makes 27 cups.

Served at adult ice cream social and everybody loved them and wanted recipe - will make again! Keep very well in freezer.

Really good treat for the adults!  Oops, when I printed the recipe there was a different description.  I'll know next time to put them in the proper container AND in the freezer.  I did put my plastic shot glasses into a plastic dish with a cover and stored in the fridge.  It was soupy when we got to it but everyone still loved the treat. Thanks holly!

Great small treat for adults.  Used small plastic (disposable) shot glasses and tiny plastic spoons.  Everyone loved them!

Made it as is and a batch with kalhua instead of baileys.  Yum. I highly recommend piping the pudding into the shot cups.

Vanilla Pudding: Made these using vanilla instead of chocolate and they were a big hit. put them in the freezer to set. The  flavour of the Baileys came through with a rich cheescake like consistency.

I made these last night for adult Halloween treats. They came out great! The only change I made was that I used 1/4 of the Bailey's Irish cream and 1/4 cup of Kahlua . Otherwise I followed the instructions as written. They set up to a nice mousse consistency in about 3-4 hours in the freezer. I will definitely make these again!

I substituted vodka for rum, since rum is sugar based.
