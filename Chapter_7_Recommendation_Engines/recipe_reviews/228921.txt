Though it didn't really taste like caramel, this was a great alternative to the run of the mill apple jam. It has really been a hit in our house & has been used quite a bit on buttered English muffins. Thank you for this great recipe! :-)

I was looking for something a little different to do with apples, and came across this recipe. I made it yesterday & it was delicious!! My DH even put some over ice-cream. While I was processing them, I realized the instructions said to use 1 1/2 packages of 1.75 ounce pectin. I only saw the 1.75 ounces so I only used 1 package. However, the jam was still acceptable. A little soft, but that's the way we like our jam. I also should have chopped the apples smaller, so I used a stick blender briefly while it was cooking.

Delicious with the apples we picked yesterday (Jonagold). It was quite sweet, I guess jam always is, so I added a bit of spice (cinnamon, cloves, and ginger) to add some depth. Also: I didn't have any butter flavoring, so I just stuck with the tablespoon of butter as above. I made 2 batches and only used one box of pectin in the second batch (the recipe calls for 1.5 boxes) -- turns out, one box works just fine.

My Favorite thing about this recipe is the exact canning directions!-Besides the Awesomeness of this jelly!! The 2nd time I made it I caramelized the white sugar before adding it to the apples. I added a little salt too &  It has more caramel taste, but is much browner. GREAT way to use up extra apples!

Absolutely wonderful! I had purchased some blemished/second picking apples to make applesauce and found I had many left over. I wanted to try something different and this sounded interesting. I'm so glad i tried it! I had read some of the other reviews and was concerned about the sweetness of the end product-especially since I didn't have tart Granny Smith apples. I went ahead and  used the required amount of sugar but I added 1 TB of lemon juice to balance it out. It's fantastic!

This tastes heavenly! I was looking for ways to use up a lot of extra apples this year, and someone told me about this recipe. I also made a variation where I added in some rum when I stirred in the sugar.  Whichever way you do it, this recipe is sure to impress! Thanks for sharing it.

Delicious!!!!  Following other reviewers I made a couple of changes.  Caramelized the white sugar (white sugar, water, and lemon juice) before adding apples and brown sugar.  I pureed the apples to make them more spreadable.  I didn't have enough granny smiths so I used a combination of granny smith, rome, and golden delicious (all great baking apples that retain their shape). I used the called for amount of pectin and increased the butter flavor (however it tasted just fine without it - so don't let this stop you from trying the recipe).  I also added some salt to cut down on the sweetness and because I like salted caramel.  Very very yummy.. It made 8 half pints.

Could you please also post the original "apple pie" tasting jam recipe too? I have saved it as my favorite and now when going to make it again the recipe is different! :-) It was a great recipe too, although it did not taste like caramel.

My mother in law and I are making jam for Christmas gifts and we LOVE this recipe.  We took the cooked apples (before adding sugar and pectin) and put in food processor to make it more like an apple butter and we can't keep my father in law out of our gifts! I highly recommend this recipe.

It tasted odd. Don't really care for the fake butter flavor, it was too overpowering.

The directions were very comprehensive and spot on.  This is very yummy but VERY, very sweet!  I omitted the butter flavoring and added 1 1/2 Tablespoons of apple pie spice.

This turned out great!  I used half granny smith and half gala apples since my family doesn't love things that are really tart and it was super tasty!

I used apple juice, 
2tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp grated nutmeg
1/2 tsp cloves
1/2 tsp allspice
BUT...cid’t make the caramel sauce, thought my family wouldn’t like it.  This is a sweet recipe, next year when I’m doing my canning I’ll try the Salted Caramel sauce

I made this with the Cortland apples from our apple picking venture. Very simple to make. Great reviews from everyone! Gave a jar to my coworker to bring home and her husband demanding she get the recipe from me..

The preserves are wonderful. However, any preserve with fat (in this case, butter) must be processed in a pressure cooker and if not, must be stored,in the freezer.  Check with Ball if you doubt me.

I really loved the texture and the flavor (it tasted amazing on banana bread!). The only reason it didn't get a 5 star is because my husband and my father said they didn't like it because it was too much of a girly flavor - which they say about everything that is really sweet - so if you prefer a more mellow jam, this may not be the recipe for you.

Great recipe. Used Gala apples from our tree (can't wait until our Honeycrisp tree produces!) we did add 2 tablespoons of kosher salt - amazing.

Delicious!  Jams are meant to be sweet, and this one was.  At the end, I added some applesauce to tone the sweetness down and it was perfect.  Great, simple recipe.   I may add a sprinkle of cinnamon when I eat it on my toast.

I liked it, but I added a bit of salt to balance the sweetness (more like salted caramel) and omitted the pectin since apples (especially green) don't need added pectin to make a nice jam-but you need to cook it longer.  It's good-a nice change.
