Consistently good. I use a 9" cast iron round pan that I preheat in the oven, pull out and throw a couple of tablespoons of vegetable oil in before the batter. This gives it a lovely fried-like crust. I substitute yogurt for the sour cream and buttermilk for milk.

Easy, moist, and delicious - what more could you ask for from a simple and straightforward recipe for cornbread?  I lightened it up a bit by using reduced fat sour cream and Land O Lakes light butter.  I also subbed reduced fat buttermilk for regular milk. This bakes up nice and brown in no time at all.  Perfect accompaniment to chili, pulled pork, or whaterver else you can think of...  The leftovers are great with butter and jam too!

This is a very delicious recipe, I did, however a few changes to my recipe, as we like our corn bread on the sweeter side.  My recipe included an extra 1/4 c cornmeal, 1/2 c butter, 1/2 c sugar, and instead of regular milk, I used buttermilk.  They turned out wonderfully moist and very tasty! Next time I will add some fresh corn to the recipe for a little added texture.  This is definitely a must keep in my recipe box!

This is my favorite cornbread recipe ever. The texture is just wonderful (nice and crusty on the top), and it is so insanely moist inside. It's so much healthier then recipes that rely on lots of butter or shortening (and tastes much better because of it). The key is not to overmix when you add the wet and dry. The batter will look super thick...too thick...when you add it to the pan. But it comes out perfect. And no alterations to the recipe to make it a 5 star.

After reading several reviews,I was concern about the consistencey of the batter. I said what the heck I'm gonna make it. Turns out this batter was beautiful and creamy.Don't hesitate to make this and it needs no changes at all. I made mine in a 8 inch square metal baking pan. I use this recipe when I make chili and just last night meatball stew. My huband and son scarf it up when I make it.I laugh when ppl. revamp a recipe and then give it 5 stars to their changes.This one needs nothing changed at all.It is a five star just the way it is. Thx bookwurm70 for a great recipe!!!! DELISH : )

Made this recipe the other night and the results were wonderful!!  I made muffins instead of using a baking dish and that was not the best idea because they stuck to the paper liners so I lost a good portion of each muffin.  Next time I will use the 8" baking dish or try greasing the muffin pan instead of using the paper liners.  The corn bread was moist and flavorful - even a couple of days later! Only change I made was to up the milk to about 1/2 cup because I thought the batter was a bit too thick.  This is now my go-to recipe for corn bread - thanks for sharing!

I so much wanted to love this recipe, but like several others, mine was dry in the end. I followed the recipe exactly, and made no substitutions. I was actually shocked by how dry it was, considering that I've found most cornbread recipes, even egg-free ones, to be generally foolproof. I tried this one because I thought the addition of sour cream sounded intriguing.

I also thought that calling it "sweet" in the title was very misleading. This corn bread has a touch of sweetness, but I'd say you'd need to at least double the sugar to match what most people think of when they hear "sweet cornbread."

Fantastic!  I added a 1/4 cup of honey because I like my cornbread sweet.  This was so moist, the best corn bread I have ever made!

This is the best cornbread recipe I've ever made. My husband asked for them again two days later. I made 12 muffins with one recipe. Moist on the inside and a little crunch on the outside when they are right out of the oven. Turn your oven heat down 25 degrees if you are using a dark non-stick pan. Delicious with butter and honey.

To make this recipe Gluten Free, I substituted 1 cup of Pamela's Bread Mix & Flour Blend instead of the 1 cup of flour.  I also sprinkled mine with sugar in the raw on top before baking :) Turned out wonderful, thank you for this recipe!

Very moist bread! I was slightly concerned that my cornmeal was.medium ground and the corser the mill the drier the bread comes out...but I wanted to use what I had on hand. I soaked the cornmeal in the buttermilk and sour cream. This dissolved and softened the cornmeal. I defiantly recommend doing that if you have a courser cornmeal. In addition, Similar to making pancakes, I pourded the batter into the prepared baking dish and let stand for about 10 min. Before baking. This gave the baking powered and buttermilk time to react and "fluf" up the batter. Yummy bread. Best one I have tried so far.

Used buttermilk in place of milk and Greek yogurt in place of sour cream as changes of necessity (had these on hand).  Probably added a little more sugar, as did not measure and DH likes his cornbread on the sweet side.  This is a great recipe for cornbread that tastes like that we had at home back in the prehistoric age, when I was a young girl.  Thanks for sharing!

I chose to make this cornbread to use up some sour cream that I had in the fridge and am so glad that I did.  This was so moist and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly only adding in some diced roasted red pepper and pickled jalapeños.

This was my first time making corn bread. These are easy and quick. They will be great with my chili. I did not have sour cream, but I know they will be even better next time with that addition. The texture is excellent. I followed some of the other reviews and added 1/2 cup of butter, 1/2 cup of sugar and used buttermilk. I like sweet, but next time I will do the regular amount of sugar and just 2 or 3 extra teaspoons. I used greased muffin pan and made 10 muffins. Baked for 20 minutes and immediately removed them so they would be out of the heated tin. I want to try these in my jumbo muffin tin so that I can use them for breakfast.

my very first corn bread, so I have nothing to compare it with. We ate it hot, and it was very good. We liked it on the sweet side, as I added some more sugar; great with cheese, ham and also standing alone

Very very good- I used 1 C. of greek yogurt because I didn't have sour cream, I added a handful of frozen corn kernels and a fine diced jalapeno seeds and all, added splenda to equal double the sugar and a glop of honey- wonderful, moist and very very good-I did have to bake for about 30-35 minutes total. This will be my go to corn bread recipe from now on!

I went by the recipe except for the cooking method. I made the corn bread mixture in the waffle iron and then smothered the "waffles" with chili. It was really good, I'll definitely be using this corn bread recipe from now. Most and delicious. Great with chili. Thank you.

This was wonderful.  I used self rising since I was out of all purpose so I left out the baking soda, baking powder and salt. I used vegetable oil instead of the butter.  Did use a little bit more sugar. I cooked in an iron cast skillet. This was really good and very moist.  Everyone loved it and I will use this again!!  Thank you!!

Wonderful!  I always try to make a new recipe exactly as it is written the first time.  However, I was out of sour cream so I used plain yogurt (I did everything else as it was written).  I'm sure the sour cream would be just as good.  It's super moist and the corn flavor really stands out; more so than any other recipe I've tried.  It tasted like fresh corn on the cob!  This will be my go to corn bread from now on.  Thanks for a great recipe!

What a fantastic country addition to almost any meal!  I've made this recipe (as muffins) twice now.  Once with corn meal flour, and once with corn meal.  The cornmeal made better muffins with improved flavour! 

I made sure they didn't stick by using cooking spray on the pan instead of using paper muffin cups, and they came out beautifully as individual portions.

This recipe is a keeper, for sure!

How nice to have an easy recipe on hand for all those times when dinner rolls is an afterthought and I don't feel like running to the store again. Don't worry if the dough seems a bit stiff - you don't want to overmix it anyway. I recently made this with Baked Seafood au Gratin from this site - a match made in Heaven.

This was definitely an okay recipe, but we found it bland.  Maybe more corn meal?  It also was very tall in an 8x8 pan.  If I made it again I'd bake it in a larger pan.

Solid cornbread recipe. I made it once with an 8x8 pan and once in a 9x13 with double the ingredients. The bigger pan wasn't quite twice as big, so we ended up with a taller cornbread that I liked better.

First time I've ever made cornbread and I was told by my companion I'll be making it again and again he said it was like candy. I followed the recipe ingredients with no changes I did cook it in a 9" cast iron skillet that I heated in the oven while it got to the cooking temperature of 400 degrees. I coated the skillet with butter before adding the batter cooked 22 minutes to golden perfection then I speed more butter on the top right out of the oven. Make this recipe as is you will definitely enjoy it.

Without a doubt, this is the best corn bread I've ever had. The stuff that is made with a mix or made in the store or bakery would often taste good, but were dry and always left a "funny" taste in my mouth.  I've used several recipes, but they always resulted in dry and crumbly bread. None was good to use the next day, and I always threw it out.  This bread has just the right amount of sweetness, and it is so moist!  I made it last night, and although it's a little drier today (which is to be expected), it was still moist enough to ENJOY at breakfast - no crumbles at all.  It's taken years, but I've finally got my recipe.  Think I'll be making a lot more corn bread for now on.  Thanks so much.

The bread wasn't too bad in taste but not sweet enough and way too dry! I wonder if I over mixed?

I've made this twice now. The first time I followed everything except I substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream. It was very good and my kids liked it so much they requested it tonight. I substituted apple sauce for the butter and again used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It was even better. Thanks for the recipe and we will be eating this a lot this cold winter season!

I'm amazed at this recipe! It is WONDERFUL! I was a little nervous about putting a whole cup of sour cream in there, but it turned out to be just the right amount! I made muffins instead of a loaf and it turned out to make 12 big muffins! To make the recipe a bit healthier, I added a flax seed mixture in place of an egg, and I put in half white flour and half wheat flour instead of all white. They are filling my house with heavenly smells right now! This has taken the place of my old cornbread recipe. I can't wait to make these again!

Some of the best cornbread I've ever made, and very simple. Very moist and only a little bit sweet; you can adjust the sweetness with more or less sugar. I now buy the corn meal in bulk at the local co-op just to make this!

Third time making this. Outstanding taste, moist, tender texture. I made it last time with unsweetened coconut milk and no sour cream due to a guests dairy issue and found it to have been a bit dry, but still good. 
Make as is and you won't regret it! Followed the recipe exactly tonight and we loved it!

Used self-rising flour and cornmeal and omitted the salt, baking pwder, and baking soda. Used  only about half the sugar called for.  Baked in iron skillet. Turned out beautiful and delicious.

This was my first time making corn bread and it was quick and easy to make.  This is a full proof recipe for corn bread.  The sour cream makes it very moist.  It has the right amount of sweetness!  It gives jiffy corn bread a run for their money.

its a good basic recipe you can tweak as you go along. I followed exactly the first time as stated, waaayyyy to sour and too grainy. The next time I used less sour cream, and added more milk, and sugar, as I like my cornbread more sweet than sour, and less grainy. The temp is too high on here, I set my oven at 350, and baked for 30 mins, or until browned. I also used a 9x13 baking dish, the bread fit perfectly in it, for 6 servings. Im sure it would be even better with an iron skillet.

This corn bread was so easy to make!  It came out moist and delicious.  I'm glad I made a double batch- we couldn't stop eating it!  I substituted buttermilk for regular milk, but kept everything else the same.  I think it would be great with regular milk as well.

Delicious and super easy. I used medium grind cornmeal, it added an extra delicious texture, a little bit of crunch! It was slightly crumbly and sweet enough but not like cake. I'm sure once I make it a few more times and tweak the ingredients a bit I'll come up with the perfect corn bread for my family. They really don't want me to mess with it though because everyone loved it so much!

Good! For dairy and egg allergies, omit the egg, double the baking powder, and sub vegan versions of sour cream, milk, and butter.

Good! It isn't dry & crumbly, nut I wouldn't say 'creamy'. Corn bread by nature is crumby.

Until now, cornbread was my cooking nemesis.  I have tried numerous recipes and never been satisfied.  This recipe is a game changer, finally a cornbread that is moist, has great flavor, and not full of lard an butter.  Thanks for ending my cornbread search!

delicious! I did add a 1/2 cup sugar rather than 1/4 to  make it a little sweeter but I have no doubt it would have been just as good with the 1/4 cup.

Also subbed some greek yogurt for some of the sour cream simply b/c I didn't have enough sour cream.

Made the recipe exactly as stated, it was delicious!  I used skim milk and although the batter is a little thick there is no need for additional milk (as in other reviews).  My husband and I loved it and I will definitely make it again.

I made this as a gluten free version and it was so delicious! I substituted the flour for Arrowhead Mills all purpose Gluten Free baking mix and followed the rest of the recipe exactly! It was amazing! I also made Lucille's Apple Butter to spread on... (unsalted butter, apple butter and corn syrup whipped together!!) 

Definitely will be making again!!!!

Great recipe.  Great flavor.  Fixed today in my little cast iron skillet, preheated with butter in the oven for a crispy crust.  Used a little less sugar and substituted plain low fat yogurt for the buttermilk which I didn't have on hand.

I'm usually not a fan of cornbread, mostly because I find it too crumbly.  This recipe is very different, most likely because of the sour cream.  It's very moist but not cake-like so it's still a cornbread.  This I will definitely make the next time cornbread is called for.

I went searching for a last minute cornbread recipe to make with ribs one night and unfortunately found this one. I don’t know how it got so many positive reviews, because all I could taste was flour and it was not nearly sweet enough (to the point of being bland). It was cooked through before getting browned at all, so not only did it not taste good, it also didn’t look appetizing. This recipe would have to be tweaked too much to make it edible, in my opinion. Do yourself a favor and find another cornbread recipe.

I made this for the first time, and it was great. The only thing I need to figure out is, after I baked it, by the time I served it, it had cooled and became hard.  So, I had to nook it in the mico, but had to be eaten immediately.

This corn bread actually isn’t sweet at all. It wasn’t dry it has good texture but I expected more from the flavor. I thought it was odd that a recipe titled sweet cornbread had such little sugar. I think I’ll search for another recipe. This bread is not going to cut it for Thanksgiving tomorrow.

I made this for my daughter and son in law when my husband babysat and I sent food for their evening meal.  My family LOVED this so much that I made it again so I could have a serving!   I'm guessing the butter and sour cream made it rich and savory.

This is the bomb! I used jiffy mix in place of flour, corn meal and baking soda and powder and added a can of regular corn, drained. I have no idea how the one reviewers came out dry. Don't over mix it. Just fold it over till moist and pour it in.

Moist and delicious. Added a couple of tablespoons extra sugar and used buttermilk. Though I’m sure it would have been perfect as written. So good!

This recipe is delicious as written, but I added  1/4 cup of honey and doubled the recipe, putting it in a 9x13 pan instead. Took 30 mins to cook. I will always make this when I make chili. The bread is moist and the texture is smoother than any boxed corn bread. I also made honey butter with 1/4 cup honey and 3/4 cup softened butter. Delicious!

THIS is southern cornbread. Fluffy, sweet, moist, PERFECT. I eyeballed the butter (as you do), but otherwise kept to the recipie. I've used it multiple times and get rave reviews from everyone who eat it. Definitely one I keep in my back pocket for stews and the like.

The only trouble we had with this recipe was waiting for it to cool! I did add a handful of frozen corn and a small chopped jalapeno for fun, and followed another suggestion of preheating the cast iron skillet and coating it with butter before the batter went in but followed the recipe for the rest. Will make this again to go with the next pot of chili! Thank you for anther great recipe!!

It was great!  I added extra sweetener because others recommended it, but it didn't need it.  Next time I will add sugar as written.  I used a 10" cast iron skillet and put butter for non-stick.

Substituted 3/4 C coconut milk with splash white vinegar and topped off the cup with canned evaporated milk for the sour cream.  Used evaporated milk instead of milk.
Excellent.  My husband loved it.

This is a great recipe and one I’ll make again. After reading the reviews, I only made one change and added 1/4 of honey. We like our cornbread a little sweeter to go with our spicy chili. This cornbread is super moist and has great flavor.

If you use unsalted butter, it will need more salt.  Going to try it again using salted butter or more salt.

Easy to make and perfect to serve alongside chili. I used 2% milk and light sour cream, and the only change was a drizzle of honey at the end. Baked about 22 minutes for a really light color with just a little cracking, it was delicious.

I doubled everything on the recipe. I added one can of cream style corn and one can of regular corn I’ve done it with both unsalted and salted corn, works great either way. I added cut up pickled jalapeños and some crushed pineapple from a can. Add this to taste. I also added 10 minutes of cooking time because of the wet ingredients I added. When I used the cast iron skillet before putting it in the oven I sprinkled whole kernel corn and jalapeño cut up. I also added about five minutes of broil at the end of cooking time. These last five broil minutes I would OK Jeanlea open the oven and rub a stick of butter to the top to add a nice brown to it.

Followed the recipe, but made into 12 muffins. They rose well and had a good light consistency.  But tasted too much like flour and baking powder, not like the sweet cornbread that I have had in the US.

This was probably the best cornbread our family had ever had!  The only problem was I didn’t make enough!  The recipe was delicious, though I added about a tablespoon and a half of honey to give it extra sweetness. I will definitely make this again.

A very good recipe, simple and quick. My husband and son really liked it. The only change I made was to add about half a cup of grated cheese and mix it in before cooking.  I will make this recipe again.

Delicious!  I will definitely make this again. I didn't have quite enough sour cream, so substituted the remaining 1/4 cup with plain Greek yogurt. We smeared on butter and drizzled a bit of honey on after serving and that made it even better.

A little dry but I think that was my fault. In the oven maybe a bit too long. Other than that it was delicious! Even the boyfriend liked it and he’s not a fan of cornbread. Thanks!

Excelente recipe.  First time I made corn bread from scratch and it turned out great.  I only had half a cup of sour cream and so used half cup skim milk and a splash of vinegar.  Additionally I used Splenda instead of pure sugar.  Results were great.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

I ran out of regular milk and substituted Lactaid.  I was worried, but it came out really nice.  Went great with shrimp and grits and I was happy (as were my daughters) to have the leftovers standalone as a snack over the next few days.

I did not make any changes and the cornbread came out perfect.  Very moist and sliced great.  Even better the second  day.  Can't wait to make it again.  This went well with the fish dinner.  Just for something to try,  I might add jalapenos next time.   I have had this in cornbread in restaurants and I like the extra heat.  Thank you for the recipe!

I've made this as written several times and it is very good! Tonight I went to make it again and realized that I didn't have sour cream and I never have Greek yogurt, so I used mayonnaise. It turned out more crumbly, but oh my gosh it was good!

Very good recipe. I ended up adding extra sugar as a few of the reviewers suggested, but I should have stuck with the original recipe because it came out a bit too sweet for my tastes to eat on it's own, but the "too sweet" cornbread was perfect for eating with a spicy chili!

I'll confess I'm not really a fan of cornbread (most recipes I've tried are way too dry and tasteless) but I wanted something to go with my new cheesy chicken enchilada soup so I found this recipe. So glad I did...light crispy crust on the outside...slightly sweet and buttery in the inside. Served warm with gobs of butter on top (of course). Otherwise...what's the point anyway?? Thanks for sharing this recipe...I'm making it again next week when I make my famous chili!

Super delicious!! I only had 1/2 cup sour cream when I verity went to make it spur of the moment, so substituted plain yogurt for the other 1/2 cup. Not super sweet as the name implies, I think was just perfect as is, but I saw in the reviews some people have added more sugar if wanted.

made as written, this was NOT sweet at all & was so dry that it was unpleasant to swallow. that little box mix is much better than this.

We liked it a lot but not sure about the taste the sour cream gave it.  It was very moist and I would probably fix it again and use a "lite" sour cream to see if the taste was a little milder.

I used Tiffany’s recommendations in the comments and we love our cornbread sweeter. Extra of the following ingredients: 1/4 cup Cornmeal, 1/2 cup Butter, 1/2 cup Sugar. I also made them in the muffin pan which cut down cook time. Would highly recommend this recipe!

The Sour Cream really makes this nice & moist... the BEST I've ever made...Mine cooked in 20 min., to  a light golden brown top and crisper bottom.... Since I used a glass pan, I sprayed it with butter flavored cooking spray... NO sticking, period! I made Ham Hocks & Beans with this... YUMMY!!!

Ok so I think something went wrong. Due the the great reviews for the most part decided to try it out. It wasn’t nasty it had a good taste but It was kind of dry and not sweet. I made the recipe with no substitutions and assumed the sour cream would make it moist but like I said it was a hot dry. I’m not sure if I did something wrong but I’m going to try it again but I’ll make a few changes and see how it turns out.

The flavor was great, but I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't rise .  It was maybe 1" tall when cooked through.  My leavening agents were both brand new from the store two weeks ago, so that shouldn't have been the problem.

Great moist bread. Instead of all purpose flour, I used gluten free flour. Instead of sugar, I used Splenda. Otherwise, this corn bread recipe is a keeper.

Made this tonight.  I've made this recipe before from my mother-in-laws recipe.  I combined the two together.  By doing so, I added 1 can of cream of corn instead of the milk.  So tasty!

I made this for my brothers birthday and he wanted cheesy cornbread. So I added some cheddar into the mix then when it was done I sprinkled cheddar on top and heated for 5ish mins. It turned out really good. However, on the reheat the next day it was a bit dry. Still good though so def a repeat recipe.

Delicious!!! Only thing I did different was I used plain Philadelphia cream cheese instead of sour cream and a little bit more milk. Stirred well and smoothed it into a pan. It doesn't rise as smoothly as the original recipe but when it comes out melt some butter over the top and sit back and receive the complements.

I didn't make this exact recipe, I was actually looking to use a can of creamed corner i accidentally bought.  Instead of corn meal I added the creamed corn and 2 cups of flour.  I also added 1/2 cup of sugar and skipped the milk since the creamed corn is moist already.  I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer, until it was golden on top.  I kept everything else the same.  It was awesome!   Moist, fluffy, perfectly sweet and my kids loved it.

Excellent cornbread. Very moist. I made one small change: I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup nonfat Greek yogurt to make it a tad bit healthier. I'm not sure it made a difference in flavor or moisture. I served it with homemade honey butter

I made it Gluten free! I really missed my old favorite gluten-free cornbread mix. So I decided to try to make some from scratch using this recipe from All Recipes. I just swapped out the flour for Bob's Red Mill gluten free baking flour. It was very good! I used a white cornmeal and low fat sour cream.

Love this recipe! I want to find the finest grain cornmeal but my husband LOVES this one with medium consistency cornmeal. I am going to make this for an upcoming BBQ as muffins - I heard turn down over 25 degrees for dark muffin trays and cook for 15 minutes. YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY

didn't change anything about the recipe. it was perfect as it was! the key is to make sure it is NOT over mixed. seriously just mix it until the dry and wet ingredients come together! it will be fairly sticky and not quick look mixed through. SO GOOD. 10/10.

Substituted coconut yogurt for the sour cream, polenta for the corn meal, and almond milk for the milk. Came out great!

Very nice, easy to make cornbread. I made it in a cast iron skillet and it came out perfectly. Not too sweet.  Nice and moist. I'd definitely make it again. It will be my go to recipe for cornbread going forward.

I am not a fan of this cornbread recipe.  This recipe results in a crispy, gritty cornbread that is dry and crumbly.  I prefer a cornbread that is sweeter, with no grit from the cornmeal, and more cake-like.  It's just a personal preference.

This is a great recipe that is very forgiving if you "mess up." My family, which includes at least 4 other adults on any given night, loved it!  

It tastes great baked in a cast iron skillet.  Use the skillet to melt the butter and then after pouring the butter in the bowl, heat the skillet in the preheated oven. This is the only *change* I made, all other deviations were accidents. Actually, I did add about a teaspoon of raw sugar because I knew my family wanted sweet cornbread.

I was sure that I had ruined it. I was in a hurry, multi-tasking, got it mixed up with another recipe that was also on the counter, didn't have enough sour-cream so I used plain yogurt to make up the difference, forgot to lightly beat the egg until I had cracked it into the bowl, accidentally dumped too much flour in as I was pouring, after folding in the wet ingredients the batter looked too dry (probably because I
spilled extra flour in) so I added more milk ... I did not have high hopes after all this but it turned out to be come-back-for-more delicious.

Some tips:  Relax.  DO NOT OVERMIX! I think that is one mistake that could ruin the recipe.  FOLD the wet ingredients into the dry.  Even though I had to add more milk, I did it GENTLY. If you know you really like it sweet, add a bit more sugar.  IN SUM: I intended to follow the recipe exactly, "messed up" a bit, and it was still very good.

So easy and delicious.   The only change I made was I used buttermilk instead of regular milk because it's what I had on hand.   I think that helped keep the bread moist.  The whole family loved it - I will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe!  Either use it as a basic and tweek it your way, or make it as is!  Took this to a party and got good reviews.  It was very moist.  It was not too sweet as some other people said, but I think that is a personal opinion.  I could add more sugar, or peppers, or corn, or leave it like it is.  Easy and good!
My husband who is not a fan of corn bread even said it was good!

I've made this twice in the past 2 weeks and it is excellent. I used gluten free flour and added 1/2 teaspoon of xantham gum, otherwise I followed it exactly. I'm not a big fan of other corn bread I've tried but this one is excellent and everyone loved it.

Has to be the best cornbread recipe I've ever made. I know blah blah blah don't give a recipe 5 stars if you change it...but I wanted sweet so I used 1/3 cup sugar, and only had about 2/3 cup sour cream so I put that in a measuing cup and added buttermilk up to 1 1/2 cups total...I would have used the total 1 cup sour cream if I had it! I baked in a preheated (and greased) cast iron pan with slices of fresh jalapeños on top. What a hit! We are all fighting over the leftovers 3 hours later!

This was absolutely fantastic!  My family said that it was the best cornbread they've ever had. So much better than the store bought mix. I doubled the recipe and baked it in one of my big cast iron skillet.  Wouldn't change a thing and will be making it regularly.

This worked really well, I used masa flour for the corn meal, then baked in an iron skillet. I just wish I could have eaten it faster! Moist, full of flavor, very well done!

I have used this cornbread recipe three times now. It's great - moist, light  and slightly sweet. However, I will use a more dense cornbread recipe when making cornbread dressing again for the holidays.  This recipe didn't seem to hold up as well mixed in a casserole.

It's good but only with a few modifications.  The first time I made this according to the recipe,  I found it to be gritty, dry and bland.  This time I improved the recipe by changing to 1.25 cups of flour and .75 cups of corn meal.  I also doubled the amount of sugar and added 1/4 cup of corn to the batter.  I made it for Thanksgiving and my husband and I tore it up!

Personally i would give 4.5 stars because of only one thing that i am not sure is supposed to be there. I made this step by step and the bread turned out fantastic. Only comment is when i ate it it seemed a little bit grainy. I could almost feel the cornmeal. But after 3 bites that feeling went away. I would most definitely make this again. And i also recommend to bake at 360 temp for 30-40 minutes.

Wow!  This was amazingly good stuff!  It is super moist, great texture, cooks up fluffy and not dense at all.  I really like my corn bread sweet so after this was done cooking I poked holes in it with a knife and poured a good tablespoon or two of honey over the top.  I let it soak in for about 10 minutes.  But even by itself it was scrumptious!  Thank you for a great and easy cornbread recipe!

I've tried many recipes. Most are too dry and not much flavor. This on is different and I think it's the sour cream. The recipe as it reads comes out way too dry, I add a bit of milk and sour cream so that it is pourable. Very nice. I'll continue to tweak this recipe, but the base is great. Try it

I made this recipe just as it's written. It was good, the texture was perfect. Next time I will double the sugar as it was a little bland for my taste. Definitely more sugar and it would be 5 stars!

It was incredibly moist. Not sure what happened when one person said it wasn't unless they didn't folow the recipe. The sour cream always makes the difference if you want a moist texture.

Very easy to make and flop proof. I used stone ground yellow corn meal, which gave it  a delicious nutty texture. Also I halved the sugar as I prefer  less sweet  breads; but for the rest of it I followed the recipe exactly -  served it with Turkey chili. DELICIOUS !!

I really like the taste of this cornbread.  The only  change I would make would be to put it in a slightly bigger pan-I used a pie plate and the middle was a little soft.

My husband really liked this.  I thought it was pretty good (it was better with butter), but could've been sweeter.  After reading reviews, I used buttermilk in place of the milk, 1/2 c of butter, and added a bit of extra sugar.  Next time I'll add more sugar or honey.  These were nice & moist, though.
I made a double recipe: I made one loaf & then 12 muffins.  I didn't use muffin tin liners, just used cooking spray.  Still baked at the 400 degrees & about 18 minutes.

This was wonderful just as written.  I made a double recipe for our larger pan.  However, I probably should have tripled it as it didn't quite fill the pan. Also, I used a little less liquid because we're at a high altitude and that seemed to work as well.  

I'll definitely make this recipe again.  Everyone loved it!!

I chose this recipe because I thought it would be moist and I didn't need a cast iron skillet for it. I used part sour cream and part greek yogurt as that's what I had on hand. This was really good, though I'm still on the lookout for a recipe that will crumb less.

This was easy and came out of the oven perfect, but I was looking for a corn bread recipe that was actually sweet and this one, contrary to its name, was not.

Came out great. Combined all dry ingredients and wet ingredients separately and then combined to cook. Cooked for 40 mins in cast iron. Came out moist and delicious.

Perfect at 20 minutes in a 14" cast iron skillet. I doubled the recipe, because in the south we like our cornbread. You'll never go back to boxed cornbread again. Perfectly moist. I like it with red beans and hamburger meat.

Turned out great, very fluffy and moist the only thing i wish i did different is adding more sugar like a few people suggested. The 1/4 cup is really not very sweet at all. Definitely making these again!

I listened to the reviewer who included an extra 1/4 c cornmeal, 1/2 c butter, 1/2 c sugar, and instead of regular milk, I used buttermilk. Absolutely perfect.

This is the best cornbread recipe I have ever made!  I thought I was following the recipe exactly, but I accidentally put in a full cup of milk instead of 1/3 of a cup.  Not sure how much of a difference that made - but it certainly didn't ruin it!  I'm camping next week, and will make this in my cast iron muffin pan over the fire!

I have been looking for a cornbread recipe with this consistency for a long time.  Moist and dense and flavorful.  The only recipe I will ever use.  We like to add chopped jalapenos to the batter.

The cornbread definitely was more moist than the ones I've made in the past.  However it wasn't very sweet at all.  I will try adding extra sugar or maybe honey next time.

i'm giving this recipe 5 stars because i don't have anything to compare it to as i've NEVER made cornbread before. Iiiiii KNOW! this recipe was very easy to put together. i also used my very first cast iron skillet that i purchased not too long ago. i preheated the skillet in the oven,  then added a little dab of shortening to the hot skillet and brushed it all over the bottom and sides. the batter is very thick and has to be spread out evenly in the pan. it baked up very nicely. i had a piece shortly after it came out of the oven and it was very warm and soooo delicious.  i had another piece once it was cooled and it was a dry, but not in a bad way. still yummy. oh, i used honey instead of sugar in this recipe. i was concerned that it may be "sweet", but suprisingly, it was not. just barely a hint of sweetness. just lovely :)

Made as directed, loved the light and moist results.  I will make again, but will sub buttermilk for the milk, add a bit more salt, and more butter because the flavor needed a punch.

Delicious!! My husband volunteered me to make chili for his coworkers and I decided to make cornbread to go with it. I've only ever made cornbread from a pre-made mix/box before and was looking for a good recipe to avoid going to the store. This recipe was quick, easy, delicious and I had all of the ingredients on hand.  I followed the recipe exactly as written. I ended up making two batches in one night because my husband and kids ate half of the first batch during dinner. My husband said "this cornbread is better than famous Daves", which I guess is a compliment? A keeper, thank you for a great recipe, I'm never buying box cornbread again!

I truly wish I could give this more than five stars! I made the recipe exactly as instructed and it turned out amazingly moist inside and it baked beautifully with a crisp top. I used a glass 8x8 square dish and used some shortening to grease the pan. I also brushed the top of the bread with lots of butter. At first I was worried the batter was too thick because it didn't pour freely from the bowl, and I almost added more milk and thankfully I didn't.  Make this as instructed and you will not be disappointed.  Thank you for this recipe, because I will never use another!

I made it exactly as directed, but for some reason the batter was really thick, too thick to pour. I had to spread it into the pan and the surface was all lumpy. I thought I had measured something incorrectly, so before I put it in the oven I went back and checked, but as far as I could tell I added the right amounts of everything. The corn bread, aside from the rough-looking top, turned out fine. But based on the description and the reviews, I was just hoping for a little more. To me it was grainy and, though not necessarily dry, not what I would call moist either. I also think it could have been sweeter. All in all, not bad, and my family liked it, but I feel like, based on how awesome so many other reviewers found it, I must have done something wrong. Maybe I overmixed the wet ingredients? Or did I not use the right type of corn meal? It would be nice to know what I could have done to make it turn out better. I might try it again and see if I can get a better result.

Loved it! I used Bob's red Mill corn grits (polenta) because I like the texture. Very easy to make!

This is a great recipe as is, but one of the times I was making it I was completely out of sour cream.  I searched the fridge and found vanilla bean Greek yogurt, so I used that instead.  Let me tell you it was amazing and this is what I use every time now.  The faint vanilla flavor works perfectly for the corn bread.

This was great.  Only change for me was I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream as it's hard to find here in Spain.

The cornbread was easy to make and was delicious. I tried to double the recipe once and it took FOREVER to cook. Stick to the recipe and it should turn out great.

I didn't have the dryness issue that some of the other cooks had. But I also baked it in two disposable loaf pans instead of the 9x9. Also when I add liquid to cornbread I usually let the measuring device overflow a tad and added a tablespoon more sour cream, because I really hate dry cornbread.

This is good, but we like it more sweet, so I double the sugar and use brown sugar, not white.  It's still not overly sweet.  Plain Greek yogurt works well in place of sour cream.

I have a dinner party to attend next week and I said I'd bring cornbread.   Being the perfectionist that I am, I cooked using two different recipes to choose the best one; this recipe and Krusteaz Honey Cornbread & Muffin Mix.  This recipe did not brown on top, it looked anemic and it was tasteless and dry.  So, in my opinion, this recipe needs a lot of help.  I like my cornbread sweet.

This is my first time making homemade cornbread (I usually use Jiffy) and this recipe is a keeper! MUCH better than the box stuff! My husband and kids went on and on about how good it was! I did add a little extra milk (maybe 1 TBSP)  because the batter seemed much drier than what I'm used to. These turned out perfectly!

Really, really good recipe! Would have rated it 5 stars but it wasn't quit sweet enough for us to call it "Sweet cornbread". I doubled the sugar the 2nd time I made it and it was PERFECT! Moist, sweet and delicious! I think my hunt for the perfect cornbread  recipie is over! Thank you :D

This cornbread is delicious and easy and 5 stars made as written! The batter will be very thick but be sure not to over mix. Add a splash more of milk if you think it’s much too dry and be on your way to enjoying this bread!

I've made this recipe several times,  but I use Tamale corn flour  instead of cornmeal. ( it's what I had on hand the first time) since it's finer, the cornbread comes out amazing!!  It's full of flavor and extremely moist and fluffy.  I usually have to make 2 pans because my grandkids ( 4 & 6) can't get enough of it!   I LOVE this recipe, only cornbread I make now!!

Made this a few days ago. Turned out perfect to my tasting. Only thing I changed was I used polenta instead of corn meal(I didn't have any corn meal). My kids liked it(they are VERY picky) they just wanted it to be sweeter.. But what kiddies the want something overly sweet. I had some a few days later and it was still very moist. About to make some more tonight.  Love it!

This was just like my grandmothers! Fluffy and sweet! I doubled the recipe so I could use my 10" cast iron skillet. I ran out of sour cream (I used low fat) and had to use  Greek yogurt for 1/2 cup. However, it was thick. So I added more milk to get it to a thick batter consistency. I used about a cup more milk.It was cake like vs more bread like. My grandmother's tip was to put a Tbs. of vegtable oil in the cast iron skillet and put in the preheated oven until it smokes.  Immediately put in the batter. This makes a very crispy crust.   Do need to understand how to make it even fluffier.

I made this exactly like the recipe said except for one thing.  I didn't have any sour cream so I took a gamble and used light mayonnaise.  Everyone said that it was better than the handed down recipe they'd used for years.  So it looks like we've got a new winner recipe!  Thanks!  
And I too cooked it in a preheated cast iron skillet with about 2 T of oil.

Best cornbread from scratch yet. Just the right amount of sweetness and so light. Will definitely make again. The only sub I made was Greek yogurt for the sour cream.

Made this for a study group to go with a hearty soup, and oh my sweet heavens!! Absolutely amazing. I subbed wheat flour for white, and Greek yogurt for sour cream and it was so incredibly moist and delicious. Using wheat flour instead of white takes away from that true yellow color a little bit, but I like the flavor of wheat better for bread. All in all, amazing recipe. thanks for sharing!

Easy, quick and delicious. I had to put them in a muffin cup as my square pan was in use  I shortened the cooking time to 15 minutes and they were perfect!

I followed all directions...the only thing I did differently was make it in muffin pans and added an extra slab of butter before I put it in the oven. Very good recipe but rated it a 4 as it still was a tad bit dry but I will def. make this again and add more butter or a can of creamed corn for more moisture.

It was a little dry the first time I made it.  I think I may have put too much flour or cornmeal in it or something.  Will definitely try it again.  Was good with a little honey butter.

I've made this several times. This is now my go-to recipe for cornbread. I do add a little honey to it & if I have buttermilk I will use that. I've also used unsweetened vanilla almond milk.

I made this because I goofed and forgot to buy the creamed corn that I usually use in my own recipe, and it called for sour cream, butter & an egg, just like my recipe. Although I usually use the boxed mix (after reading the reviews, I think I am a bad wife for using the boxed mix), but I made this with the box mix anyway and just added baking powder a bit of sugar and extra butter (because we like butter). I made it in the Pampered Chef brownie pan, baked it at 350 for 25 minutes and they are DELICIOUS!

First time I made this I did exactly as written and the bread pretty much fell apart in the dish. Second time I substituted oil for the butter and it stuck together much better.

This is the best recipe for corn bread, although I made mine into muffins. I have made it several times now. This last time I added a little more sugar, but was great without it, too.

This recipe was good the only change I made was to use plain yogurt instead of sour cream as that is what I had on hand, it turned out moist and tasted lovely. It needed the full time to bake in my oven, the edges were cooked first but the middle needed extra time.

I'm not normally a huge fan of cornbread (at least not the box-mix kind I grew up with) but my husband asked for some so I decided to give this a try. Even I loved it, it is so moist and crumbly and has just the right touch of sweetness. I used a 9 inch cake pan because my cast iron skillet was too big for this recipe, although considering how fast it disappeared, I may just have to make a double batch next time.

This by far the best corn bread I have had in along time! Mine came out really moist and the family loved it! I will be making this every time I make chili. If you haven't made this yet, you really need too.

Super yummy and so easy!  I substituted 1 cup of creamed corn for the sour cream. I will surely be using this recipe versus buying boxed corn bread mix!

This was delicious!  The only thing I changed was the sour cream and in its place I used vanilla Greek yogurt only because I didn't have any sour cream on hand.  It was so good I plan to sub the Greek yogurt on purpose the next time I make it.  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy Corn bread. I made a few changes I added a 1/4 cup of cottage cheese, extra 1/4 cup of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I use a 9" cast iron round pan that I preheat in the oven, pull out and throw a couple of tablespoons of butter and let the butter heat until light golden brown and pour the batter into the hot skillet.

This recipe was perfect & very moist. I'm really surprised by the reviews saying it was dry- maybe they over baked it? I did have the oven set to 350 instead of 400 for 25 minutes, before I realized it was set wrong- then i cranked it to 400 for 7-10 minutes and it was delicious! This will definitely be my new go to! I used a standard 8x8 aluminum pan & followed the recipe to a T except I eye-balled the sugar :)

Yummmm!  I increased the sugar to 1/3 C and the butter to 1/2 C as some other reviewers suggested.  Recipe is very forgiving - I forgot to add the milk until the very end and it still turned out great!

This may have been a five, but I substituted Namaste gluten free all purpose flour for wheat flour cuz my step-daughter was coming for dinner.  (As an aside, if anyone out there is looking for a super GF flour, Namaste is the best.  It subs well in every recipe I have ever tried.)  This is a nice recipe, but definitely not sweet.  I don't care for sweets all that much and only put the full amount of sugar in the batter because of other reviewers comments--I'm glad I did.

Delicious corn bread, great to accompany savory dishes. I increased the servings size to 12 for a dinner party and baked in a 9x13 glass dish. Out of this, I cut 24 pieces. I used a yellow cornmeal, light sour cream, and almond milk. This smells heavenly when out of the oven and is a very moist bread when sliced.

3 years strong.... Just like grandmas! Just used a bit more sugar, 2 extra eggs, half a teaspoon more baking soda and powder! (Gives the cornbread a tighter consistency!) the sour cream is the difference maker! Hats off to the recipe originator!

This is an excellent corn bread. I only have one suggestion and that is if you decide to make muffins with this recipe, Do Not use paper cupcake liners. I did and half the muffin stuck to the paper. I'm just going to make sure my muffin tin is well greased next time I want to make this into muffins. We love this corn bread. Almost forgot, I added only half the sugar and it was plenty sweet for our liking.

This was amazing!! I added about 1/2 cup honey to the wet mixture before combining it with the dry mixture. I also used plain fat free yogurt since I didn't have sour cream. I added about 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to add a little spice. And I spread butter on top when it came out of the oven. It was so amazing and yummy! So moist and spongy.

Delicious! I didn't have an egg so I substituted 1/4c olive oil and it still turned out amazing. I made mine in the pampered chef brownie pan so each piece had crusty edges. The whole family enjoyed them with chili tonight.

Used this corn bread recipe.  I didn't make any adjustments to the recipe.  I baked it in a cast iron skillet and it was wonderful.  Easy and 
I keep all of the ingredients in my pantry.

This is the best corn bread recipe I have ever made. I always make it when serving the Spicy Pumpkin Chili recipe (as found on this website.) I've made the corn bread twice for company now, and they asked for the recipe both times. This version is more moist than the traditional recipe. Delicious!

I was in a hurry, made chili and realized I had no recipe for cornbread. I was looking for easy and something a little different. I followed the recipe and 20 minutes was just right for my oven. I was worried about the sour cream because one person in my family doesn't eat it. I will find out shortly lol. No yelling so far haha. He just finished....whew...it passed. I found this to be very moist and light. Calories are worth it. I've been carb free and sugar free for two weeks and really enjoyed without guilty conscious.

I made this cornbread to go with vegetable soup. My daughter & I thought it was fabulous!! It was very moist & sweet. I hurried & shared it with my Mom. You cannot go wrong with this recipe. I think the sour cream is what makes it so yummy! This is our new "go to" cornbread recipe.

Very good. I used light sour cream, light buttermilk ( because I had on hand), and  land of lakes canola butter light  to save on fat and calories. Easy to make too!  Better than Jiffy and healthier too.

This is THE best corn bread I have ever made.  So moist and tender. A butter knife cut right through it.  And the flavor great, sweet , almost like cake.  I did make a couple of small changes...I used 1/2 cup of half and half and an extra T of butter.  I made this to go with Sweet and sour collard greens.  I will make this Corn Bread again. I had three pieces of it and my husband raved about it too!  ( he had four pieces it was so good ) Thanks bookwurm for sharing this corn bread recipe.

This is the best corn bread recipe I've ever tried... and I've tried many. Just the right amount of sweetness for me. Wonderfully moist, I think the sour cream is the key. It came out tender, but dense enough to not completely fall apart when cutting or serving. I doubled the recipe and it fit perfectly in a 9x13 pan. Thank you for sharing my new go-to corn bread recipe! I'll be making it more often, now that I have a recipe for great corn bread!

I really loved this cornbread. I added more sugar because I like mine sweeter. 
But it is definitely very moist, soft and fluffy.

I followed the recipe with exact measurements and the bread turned out perfectly.  I may add a bit more sugar or honey as recommended by other reviews as I like my cornmeal bread on the sweeter side.  Thank you for sharing this easy and delicious recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  I might add a bit more sugar next time because I like cornbread to be sweet.  (The recipe, as is, tastes a little sweet.)  I served this with jambalaya and fried okra.  Everyone really liked it.

This is light, moist, and has the perfect texture. The only criticism is that it's somewhat bland. It's not sweet, vaguely salty. I think next time I'll double or triple the sugar and/or add some corn. I also think the 9 servings amount is a bit generous for an 8x8 pan where the bread rose only 1.5 inches.

I have found my cornbread recipe! It is easy, moist delicious and doesn't crumble the way most cornbread does. Next time I might add a bit more salt, but other than that this recipe is excellent.

I made this recipe last night. Only substitute I made was using buttermilk instead of milk. Only reason I did that was last time I made cornbread, I made a jalapeno cornbread recipe I found and it required buttermilk and I still had some left. Anyway, this recipe was AMAZING. My son went back 5x. It was so light and moist. Absolutely delicious!

This is a great corn bread recipe. I didn't have any sour cream so I used heavy cream mixed with 2 tbsp vinegar and hand whipped it a bit after it sat for 10 minutes. Came out nice and moist.

Excellent!! Easy to follow recipe and we really enjoyed it with some home made soup. It came out of the pan nicely without falling apart...very moist. I want to try baking it in a cast iron skillet next time.

Made this according to the recipe except I greased a muffin tin and baked them.  I love them.  They were delicious and a little sweet, the way I like corn bread.  My daughter didn't care for them because they were too sweet for her.  I think this recipe would be great with some jalapeno's added to the batter as I feel the sweetness would complement the heat.  Would make again for sure.

Just made this today. I'm a decent cook and I followed the recipe to a T but I thought that the cornbread was just OK and dry. I was sad that this was not moist and a little more sweet than I would've preferred. Will have to keep searching for that perfect cornbread recipe.

I loved this recipe! My barbeque beef is still in the slow cooker, but I cannot stop eating this corn bread! I made a double batch and now glad I did. It is so wonderful as a late morning snack with my coffee. Thanks for sharing! This is going to be my very frequent recipe to make. I cannot wait to feed my kids this!

This is the best ever cornbread! it's moist and light in texture, just amazing! I upped the sugar to 1/3 C and used 1/4 C splenda and the rest with white sugar, and used reduced fat sour cream and bread flour instead of all purpose flour. I have been looking for a cornbread recipe that is moist, light, slightly sweet, while still retaining that delicious cornbread flavor, and this is it! MY husband and 12 yr old son both loved it too.

Made this recipe and it was just awesome my first try couldn't believe how ease it was to make I almost ate the hole pan.
Next time I will try like one of the person who wrote a review and make muffins it will be great to bring to work.

This was fabulous - not too sweet like the half cake recipes out there and not bland and crumbly like the others. It is the perfect cornbread - thick, just a touch of sweet, great flavor, not crumbly. The mixture is very thick. I used half regular sour cream and half light, doubled for a 9x13 and baked for 25 minutes. This was even good cold!

this is a very simple corn bread recipe! I had never made corn bread before and my first time making it I chose this recipe and it turned out amazing! I love corn bread and this is by far the best corn bread I have ever had!- I added a tablespoon or so of honey and it added a nice flavor to it! AWESOME!

This is the best cornbread recipe I've found!  Followed the recipe as written, and it came out perfect.  The second time, I made muffins.  I sprayed the pan instead of using muffin liners and baked for only 15 minutes.  The muffin had a nice crunch to the outside and a moist inside.  Yummy!

Excellent! I made this with a very spicy pulled pork.  I did increase the sugar to 1/3 cup and sprinkled sugar on top.  I also baked it in a preheated cast iron pan.

This turned out great! I followed the recipe to the letter! I made no changes at all! My family loved this. I served it with baked barbecue chicken, brown rice, & string beans. It was a perfect addition to the meal. This will be my new cornbread recipe!

I actually came up with this exact recipe by combining things I liked about a few different recipes.  I've been making it this way for years.  It's excellent!  And everyone always asks for the recipe.  It's super easy and way better than the mixes you can buy.

YUMMO! Excellent consistency and very moist. I would agree with many reviewers though that this is not especially a super sweet corn bread but so worth the five stars anyway. It appears from so many reviews if you want to up the sweetness - just add either honey (love that idea) or more sugar. This IS excellent as is - but what a great base if you do want to add in traditional ingredients to taste. I did add 1 cup of sharp cheddar cheese and a few diced fresh jalapenos but this is fine with or without personal touches. LOVED THIS!!! I served it with homemade chili on a chilly night! Definitely an awesome recipe!

Very delicious recipe. Personally I would add a little more sugar. I think I might add some real corn next time for texture.

Simple and delicious recipe. And I do need simple since I don't like to bake too often. This recipe came out very moist with a bit of crunch on the edges. The cornbread is slightly sweetened.. not really sweet...so it's perfect to go with some honey butter. I like really sweet cornbread so I'll be adding a bit more sugar next time.

Made this to go with chili. Thought it could have been a little sweeter and moister, not bad. Still searching for that perfect balance. I give it 3.5 stars

This is a simple and straightforward cornbread.  The name is a misnomer to me however, because it was not what I would categorize as sweet.  It still is very good with great texture, moisture and flavor, perfect served on the side.

Great for potluck, block party, etc. because it's moist enough to be tasty in a few hours. I usually make my cornbread more cake-like than this super-moist recipe (it nearly has a bread pudding consistency). That said, I brought both to a block party and the moist version was better, especially for eating solo (without chili ladled over it).

This bread was yummy!  We had it with chili and it was perfect.  I had less sour cream than I thought so I made up the difference with heavy cream and it worked well.

I doubled the sugar just because my hubby likes cornbread real sweet.  I had to bake it about 30 minutes even with a preheated oven, but it turned out very moist and yummy.  We used 2 c. white corn meal mix in place of the corn meal, flour, baking powder, and baking soda, because it is what I had on hand.  If you have the mix, don't hesitate to try this recipe it was great.

I loved it, crusty on the top and has that crumbly goodness. However I like mine a tad bit sweeter so I will be adding another 1/3 of sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm still making this corn bread recipe 5 years after my last review. 
I use Greek Low Fat Yogurt in place of the sour cream and it is fabulous every time!
After reading my last review of this recipe, I saw that I mentioned that I put the cornbread on top of a casserole; this is not our usual fare at home as we eat whole foods.  But, when our oldest comes with her family  it's fast and the little one loves it. She calls me Go-Go.
Go-Go's Hot Dog and Bean Casserole
In a sprayed oblong enamel  pan, I pour in 3 cans of New England style brown baked beans. I cut up 2 packages of hot dogs (I use Hoffman's bc they are Kosher, so I know they are no fillers). I double the cornbread recipe and drop 6 dollops ( 2 x 3 ) around the pan and bake at 400 for 45 min to 1 hour, making sure the center of the cornbread is thoroughly cooked. Let it settle about 10 min before serving.

I made this last night for the first time. It's simple super easy recipe and it's delicious. The whole family loved it. Even my very picky 8 year old loved it! I used fat free milk and light sour cream. It's perfect and definitely will be making it again soon!

This turned out great! Made just as is, and I love the flavor-sweet, but not TOO sweet-just right. And the texture was perfect! A great compliment to my homemade chili. Definitely a keeper! The only precaution is definitely do not over mix.

Any recipe fool-proof enough for me to follow deserves at least 4 stars. This one gets 5 because  had all the ingredients at home, I didn't have to run to the store to buy anything. It's super easy and comes out delicious! No need to tweak any of the ingredients, no adjusting of the cooking time or temperature. Just follow the directions.

It had good flavor, but it came out dry. I will try again to see if it was my error the 1st time.

Excellent, only things I changed were that I used 1/3 cup of sugar for sweetness and white corn meal because that's all I had. ;)

Fantastic simple recipe, my go to recipe with chili and BBQ. I added 2/3 cup of frozen corn kernels and a finely diced seeded jalapeno to give it a bit of texture and kick.

I loved this!  Sweet but not overly.  I love the texture and flavor.  I didn't change a thing on the recipe.  5 stars as is.  I made it to go with southern style pinto beans and ham and it complemented that savory dish very well.

Absolutely awesome. We also substitute Greek Yogurt (honey) for the Sour Cream for a sweeter flavor...

Best ever!  Mt husband is a huge cornbread snob and he loves this stuff.  It's firm without being dry and crumbly.  Its slightly, but not too sweet.  I love it with butter and honey the morning after I served it at dinner with fried chicken.

This is the 2nd time I made this & it turned out beautifully. I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white & added a small can of diced green chilies & a cup of grated cheddar. This is the way cornbread should taste! Buttery interior & a crispy top.

This was okay but a tad dry. I doubled the recipe so I'm not sure if that was the reason. I won't make this again.

Wow! This is the best corn bread I have ever eaten.  So tender and moist on the inside and has kind of crispyness on the outside.  We could not stop eating them. I made just as written with the exception that I baked them in well greased muffin pan for 15 minutes.  Batter was very thick, but DON'T add more milk like others have said they did.  My search for corn bread recipes is over.  This is it!  Thank you for sharing your recipe with us!!

Wonderful! I loved the texture and flavor of this bread. I made it exactly as written except i didn't have enough sour cream and substituted the rest with plain greek yogurt, so it was 1/2 and 1/2. I like sweetness but I didn't find it especially sweet. I can see adding more sugar if you are looking for that sweet taste. But personally I don't want a sweet bread with my spicy foods like chili. This is my new to go cornbread recipe! It is just right!

This is the a keeper! When I saw sour cream was one of the ingredients, I thought I must try this one because sour cream does make things moist. And wow, is it ever moist, and very delicious. My whole family loved it. I made it in a iron skillet and it came out great. My search for a great corn bread recipe will be this one hands down....Dianne

This was a great fool proof recipe! I made this as is with no changes and it was perfect. I topped it with honey butter which adds a little more sweetness if that's what you like. I was given plenty of compliments! Thanks for sharing!!

Very moist cornbread!  And just the right touch of sweetness in my opinion :)  I was always so-so on cornbread until I tried this recipe.  I LOVE this!  I bake it in a square stoneware baker; I take it out before it looks done (not browned, but knife comes out clean) ~ DELICIOUS!

Delicious!!!  I've always been a Jiffy cornbread girl, but decided to try this recipe.  It takes more time than the Jiffy, but it is so moist and just the right amount of sweetness. Definitely a special treat.  I made mine to go with Chef John's Ham and Potato Soup from this site.  Yum!  A perfect dinner for the chilly temps outside!

It Was great. I made a few substitutions - 3 tbspns of olive oil for butter and flax seed for the egg.... It came out very rich and moist... The whole family thought it was great.

I use Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream and often add diced jalapenos. On occasion, I'll even add some shredded cheddar or jack cheese to it. Delicious.

Tried this tonight, it was fabulous.  I doubled the recipe since I was wanting left overs for a meal tomorrow and baked the whole thing in a pre-heated cast iron skillet.  I actually only put half the butter in the batter and the rest I melted in the skillet before I poured the batter in.  I also sprinkled a tiny bit of brown sugar on the top as well.  It was crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside with plenty of flavor and paired perfectly with the veggie soup we had tonight. Totally made me feel like a master of the cornbread!  :)

This cornbread is amazing!  Please don't add any more milk even if you think the batter is too thick.  It will come out perfectly just the way it is written.

Good cornbread.  I tried to lighten it by using 1/2 c wheat flour; 1/2 c white flour; light sour cream and used canola oil instead of butter.  Very good but I think I would increase the sugar to 1 c or use brown sugar instead to sweeten it up.  Will definitely make again.

Wow, wow, wow! Best cornbread I have ever had!  I also made mine into muffins (silicone muffin cups) and baked for 15 mins.  They were so fluffy and moist on the inside and crisp on the outside....Yum!!! I will never use another recipe again!!

This corn muffin recipe is excellent.  I usually make jiffy but I didn't have any and this taste better.  I will never buy jiffy again.  Thanks!

1/3 cup of milk just was nowhere near enough, I added and added milk until the batter was the consistency of a cake batter. my only other deviation from this recipe was I added 1 chopped poblano, onion, and some chopped garlic.

For a healthier variation, I substituted plain low fat yogurt for the sour cream and 1/3 cup white whole wheat flour for an equal amount of all purpose flour. Served with spicy chile.  Everyone loved it.  I'll be making breakfast muffins using this recipe next.

perfect without alterations. Try using your waffle maker. They get eaten before the next batch can come out. Adding diced jalapeno and then eating with jalapeno jelly was a big hit. perfect recipe, thank you

Wow, I just made this corn bread.  I usually make corn bread from a mix, never again.  This was so easy and incredibly delicious.  Very moist.  Served with chili, it was perfect.  Wouldn't change a thing.

Delicious and moist! Changed it up slightly and made Muffins, baked at 400 for 20 minutes. Perfect as a Chili side dish.

was never a lover of corn bread until I made this following the recipe. Wonderful as all ingredients are common in my pantry. Did add a 1/4 cup honey to sweeten. Definitely nice to have with spicy chili and will make again. Never have to buy packaged corn bread mix. Thank you for sharing your recipe.
