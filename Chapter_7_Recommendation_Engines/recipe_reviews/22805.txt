We have never had seafood lasagna before and this was great! I did make some changes though. I used only 1/4 cup onion and added 2 cloves chopped garlic. I used a 15 oz.container of Sorrento ricotta instead of the cottage cheese. Slowly melted cream cheese in onion mix,then added ricotta and rest of things until heated through. I used fresh shrimp and 1/2 pound scallops that I cut in half. Fried in pan with some butter and garlic until shrimp turned pink. I used Bumble Bee lump crab(more expensive than regular) but it all broke up so I will use regular kind in can next time. I will also add more scallops. To sauce mix, we use skim milk, so I added 1/3c half n half and also added 3 T fresh grated parmesan cheese. Didn't use the wine. I used mozzarella instead of cheddar and used between layers and on topping with parmesan. I let stand 10 min. after taking out of oven before serving and it held up great, it wasn't runny at all. Very good! Thanks Rayna!

This dish was outstanding!  I read the previous reviews that thought it was runny, so I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and it was not runny at all!!  Also, I thought chedder might be too sharp, so I used a mixute of shredded mozzarella and parmesan cheeses (you can buy the mixture in a bag).  They melted perfectly over the top!  It turned out absolutely fabulous!!!  I fact, I have been asked to make it every night (and I just may)!!

I used 1/2 lb of shrimp and 1/2 lb of scallops and fresh crabmeat. I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese - it was fantastic!

I basically took the basics and prior to making it I read the reviews and pulled the best recommendations together.  Instead of cottage cheese I used ricotta. I added two cloves of garlic to the onion mixture. I used 1-1/2 cans of cream of mushroom,"low sodium" and 1/2 can of cream of chicken and omitted the salt altogether. Added 1-1/2 eggs.  My lasagna was neither too salty or too liquidy, it was perfect. Added a little mozzerella on top in addition to the other cheeses and used 1 lb of Maryland jumbo lump crab meat, no substitutes, and 1/2 lb of scallops.  Perfect!!!!

This is really good - my family requests it often.  The only drawback is that it is a little runny - I am not sure how to firm it up.  I have added extra noodles and an extra egg which helped a little bit.

Delicious! Went to AR recipe request for a seafood dish I could take to a upcale potluck. I was sent this recipe. It was a big hit.  Made a few changes: used medium shrimp coarsely chopped ( pat dry between paper towels), ricotta instead of cottage cheese and no boil lasagna noodles. It is easy to spread the cream cheese mixture onto the no boil noodles (4 per layer). I topped the last layer of seafood mixture with a layer of noodles, covered the noodles with mozarella and parmesan cheese. Sprinkled a tiny bit  offinely minced fresh basil on top for color.   I assembled this in the morning and baked it several hours later. It set up well, not soupy at all. This is a keeper! Thanks.

I was excited about trying this recipe, and I absolutely LOVED it!! My family knows I'm a great cook, so no compliments are ever really needed, but they could not stop raving when I made this last night. I couldn't wait to get on my lunch break today so I could eat leftovers! There was nothing that needed to be changed, added, or subtracted. Awesome, awesome, awesome!

This was completely awful. The only thing I've tried from allrecipes.com that I did not like. It was very rich and the flavor was all wrong.

This is very good and easy to make.  I made some changes.  We dislike scallops, so I omitted those and used baby shrimp, crab meat and canned whole baby clams (one can, drained).  I added fresh thyme and highly recommend it.  I substituted ricotta for cottage cheese (personal tastes) and it was great.  I also used grated provolone instead of cheddar.  And I used oven ready lasagna noodles, which worked fine.  Leftovers are very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for Easter and was not impressed, though my guests said they liked it, perhaps they were being polite.  The cream of mushroom soup did not enhance the seafood, but rather it overpowered it.  I would try it again but use Shrimp or Crab Bisque to achieve more of a seafood nuance.  I used tilapia, scallops and medium sized shrimp, all uncooked.  They were not overcooked in the lasagne. I used a one pound box of noodles.  Even after sitting after taking it from the oven the mushroom soup layers were runny.  On the plus side, it was VERY easy to make and not a total disaster, jut not the seafood flavor I had hoped for.

This is the recipe that I grew up on and we still make it today for special occasions and guests.  I normally add a pound of bay scallops to the dish.  Leftovers (although rare) are always phenominal.   This is truly an awesome dish albeit a bit on the pricy side.

I made this essentially as written, substituting only ricotta for the cottage, and adding some clams.  The final product was just okay.  2 tsp of basil is extremely overwhelming in my opinion.  I am surprised by all the rave reviews on here, because I found this to be a very blah lasagna, certainly not worth the expensive ingredients involved.  By the way, whoever submitted that main photo must have made a number of additions/substitutions, because this is a "white lasagna" as written; there is no red sauce involved here.

This was excellent. I made two different lasagnas for a big family dinner and this one was the first to go by far. I'll definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing!

This was awesome. The recipe is almost exactly the same as Aunty Pasto's Seafood Lasagna, also on this site, with the exception this one does not include mushrooms, so I used this one as am not a mushroom fan. The only variations I made were to use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and seafood seasoning instead of salt and pepper. Will definitely make again.

This was quite good.  I did add some asiago cheese to it but other than that I stuck to it as written.  I thought it did come out rather runny.  I think the key to making this good is using quality ingredients like fresh crab meat not the canned stuff. It makes it more expensive , but it tastes better.

Loved this.  I had a lb of fresh crab--and my store had cream of shrimp soup--so I used those in place of the 6oz can and cream of mushroom.  I also added old bay, like any good marylander would....I stuck with the cottage cheese because I wanted to keep the calories down.  Bought 4% milkfat--hoping it would be thicker.  Mine was perfect--mabye the extra crab helped.  I will make this for company.  Great because you can make it ahead and put it in the oven walk away!

Absolutely delicious!!!  I replaced the two cans of cream of mushroom soup with cream of shrimp.  I also added about a teaspoon of Zatarain's liquid Crab Boil to the soup mixture.  This recipe was great!

I thought this was excellent except for two things:  (1) next time i will use 12 noodles instead of nine and (2) i will use uncooked shrimp in place of the cooked shrimp.  (i used large shrimp cut in half  instead of small and it ended up being rubbery and overcooked.)

EXCELLENT!!! I've been searching for a good Seafood Lasagna & this is the best I've ever made! Gave some samples to family & they LOVED it. It is so creamy & it just gets better the longer it sets. Thanks for a wonderful recipe that is already a family favorite!

Wow, this was pretty good! Even my kids loved it! Only thing I changed was I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, I used a little garlic in addition to onion, I used fresh herbs from my garden (mostly basil, a little oregano & a little parsley) and used mozzarella instead of cheddar.  Yummy! Will make again.

I tasted it.. thought.. hmm.. not sure I like this.. This tied for first place with the only other bad recipe I've prepared in my lifetime. Fortunately, the grandkids I served it to are younger than the kids were when the other "winner" appeared on the table.. and I'll live it down ;)  Sorry, but this should get negative stars in our opinion.

This was good, a little bland--even after adding lots of garlic. I will attempt to make this dish for my family again, though I think that I will try adding some sun-dried tomatoes and a few capers chopped into it. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I used fresh basil, 1 lb of crab and raw shrimp. It was great! Can't wait for left overs tonight! Oh, I did let it sit in the oven for a little bit after it finished on 250 to keep warm. It was not runny.

We used a little less onion, a couple cloves of garlic, substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese, substituted 1 can of cream of shrimp for the second can of soup, and used a little more basil. We used Italian-blend cheese for the top. The flavor was excellent, the noodles perfect... ours did not set up even after resting, so it was very liquid, but again it did not affect the flavor and didn't diminish our enjoyment.

Have made this before with the addition of 1.5 lb of bay scallops.  And I use ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  I omitted the white wine (in recovery) and it didn't affect anything.  This is a very tasty meal that I tied together with Neptune Salad and fresh garlic bread.  I got raves and requests to make it again-so I'm making it to go with Thanksgiving dinner this year.

I made this tonight for my husband and his brother, I did't really care for the taste, actually it kinda tasted like a shrimp clam chowder. I followed the recipe to a T except instead of 2 cans of cream of mushroom I added 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of Cream of chicken. I will not  be making this again, seafood lasagna is not as good as it sounds, stick with the regular. :}

I was really underwhelmed by this recipe.  I love seafood and this did not live up to my expectations.  I thought there was WAY to much mushroom soup.  The soup overpowered the seafood.  I let the lasagna rest for 15 minutes but it was still runny.  Other than the cheddar cheese everything was a same color.  Reminded me of a gray modeling clay with specks of pink and orange.  I won't be making this again.  I'm still on the hunt for a good seafood recipe.

Very very very nice.  The reviewer who said that this tasted like shrimp clam chowder was right. Hubby and I liked it very much. However, the smell was a bit offensive.  We didn't mind it, but this is not something to eat at the office.  Still giving it 5 stars, because I like the taste and the idea.

I found this to be just so-so. The taste was too salty from the canned mushroom soup. I used oven ready lasagna noodles and the bottom layer turned out too dry. If you have to try this recipe and you're using oven ready noodles, I recommend adding more milk to the crab/shrimp mixture and put some on the bottom of the pan before the first layer of noodles. I'm still on a hunt for a seafood lasagna that will "wow" my taste buds.

This recipe is really tasty and fairly easy to make. I used a cheddar-mozzarella blend, substituted ricotta cheese for cottage chesse and added some fresh garlic to the onion mixture. YUM!

This is my first attempt at Seafood lasagna.  It turned out great!  The only change I would make is to skip the salt.  It was just a little too salty for me.  I think the sodium in the cream soup is enough all by itself.  When first removed from the oven, this dish is very lidquidy.  We let it sit for about 15 minutes before cutting.  It solidified to the perfect consistancy for cutting pieces that didn't run all over the plate.  Please try this one.  It's a very nice change from regular lasagna.

We had this for dinner tonight.  It was very good.  I made two adaptations.....no-cook pasta and a jar of "lower fat" alfredo sauce in place of the cream soup.  Added the milk but no wine...turned out quite nice...not wet at all.  Try it!

This is a rich and elegant lasagna that is not only delicious, but has great presentation value. I served it to my hubby's fishing buddies and their wives. Everyone went home with the recipe. I used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of mushroom for a variaton of flavors. We love basil so I increased it to 3t, and used ricotta cheese in place of cottage cheese. WOW! Great dish, Rayna. People thought I had spent the entire day in the kitchen!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe..I added mozzerella between each layer. I also used imitation crab chopped finely (they didn't have real crab at my grocery store). It tasted great and is even better reheated!

This is delicious! Very rich, very tasty, relatively easy to make.  I did substitute riccota for the cottage cheese and I added some minced garlic, but oh my God is this yummy!  Even my picky husband enjoyed it.

I got lot's of compliaments on this recipe.  I used lobster instead of crab and used canned mushroom pieces instead of the soup and just added a bit of extra wine and milk.  Easy and a great seafood crowd pleaser.

This was good although, like others have said it is very runny.  I think next time I will just layer the cheese mixture with the noodles and then pour the soup and wine sauce over the top of that.  I will also cut the milk and wine in half and I think that would be plenty of sauce.

I love this recipe very flavorful and everyone loves it, I've made it several times for friends and family and they can't get enough, I've used both cottage cheese and ricotta cheese and never was it runny. This is always a show stopper.

The flavours are all wrong. I think it's the basil. And it needs something, a sweetness. Maybe scallops, maybe clams. It's very very rich.

Excellent :) I added scallops & used ricotta cheese instead of cottage. I cut the salt in half and it was fine. The next time I make this, I will try Old Bay seasoning and fresh herbs versus dried. As far as the consistency, I feel it was a little runny after resting 15 minutes. Maybe a little mozzarella in between layers will help as suggested in other reviews and asiago for added flavor for the cheese lover in me.

This is one I make regularly and have for a couple years. I always tweak something to keep it interesting. Tonight I tried it with the no boil noodles.. Awful.  The time they saved doesn't make up for the flavors they kill. I don't understand why these exist.

Made this for my boyfriend and I. Next time I will use 1 and a half jars of sauce instead of the called for 2. Two jars was a lot of sauce for a 9x13 pan. Mine started spilling out of the dish and dripping on the bottom of my oven. My kitchen smelled like burning and I was only able to cook my lasagna for half the oven time before all if that started happening. We ended up eating soupy lasagna but it still tasted great! I'm sure well laugh about this when were old and gray together. I also added basil and spinach to mine :)
