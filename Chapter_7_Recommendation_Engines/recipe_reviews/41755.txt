Absolutely delicious.  I served this sauce over blackened tilapia.  We had my parents over for dinner and they loved it.  My dad kept saying, "wow!"  I read the reviews about the sauce being thin so I added about a teaspoon of flour to the warm butter to make a thin roux before adding the cream so that the sauce would be thicker.  Don't know if it made a difference but my sauce wasn't thin, it was perfect!  It makes it hard to go spend $25 for a dish at pricey seafood restaurants when it only cost me about $12 to feed 4. ***UPDATE***I have made this about half a dozen more times and now I saute a chopped shallot and a few garlic cloves, chopped, in the butter after the shrimp are done and I still add flour to make a roux before adding the cream.  Chopped parsley is another touch to make it beautiful!  This sauce is absolutely decadent!

This receipe was fantastic.  Served it over pan fried flounder - My husband thought he was in heaven.  I felt like I was eating at Commander's Palace in New Orleans.  Easy and quick.  This receipe is definitely a keeper.

This sauce is unbelievable!!  Don't change anything except how much you make, MAKE EXTRA, you'll be glad you did.  I serve this sauce with blackened tilapia along with sauteed asparagus and rice pilaf (the sauce is good with the rice, too!) My family begs for this fabulous meal almost every day of the week.

Catchy, inviting name, good sauce.  Didn't have Madeira but dry sherry was a worthy substitute.  I sautéed fresh minced garlic, some minced shallots and the mushrooms (an “exotic blend),” set that aside, cooked up the shrimp, then added them to the mushrooms.  I didn’t measure anything for the sauce, just melted the butter and added a full cup of cream and a glug of dry sherry and simmered  it, reducing it to the thickness I desired (thickening with flour or cornstarch is not necessary).  Once thickened I added the shrimp/mushroom mixture.  This is a rich and luscious sauce, not heavily seasoned, so it was ideal for the spicier, blackened halibut we served it with.  This was simply an excellent and elegant dish.  This was one of those rare occasions where Hubs voiced his opinion before it was even asked for.  “This is awesome,” he said.

Loved it!  We had it over cedar plank salmon.  Fantastic!  The measurements say 1/4 cup of butter and then says to use 1 teaspoon for saute and 2 teaspoons for sauce.  Should actually read 1 tablespoon for saute and 3 tablespoons for sauce.  Again, this was a great addition to our meal.

This was excellent. I did not have whipping cream or madeira on hand, but subbed 1% milk and cream sherry (after an internet search for subs for Madeira).  I added 1 tsp of cornstarch to thicken the roux.  This was the perfect topper for the Blackened Tuna Steak recipe from this site.  Will make again!

The flavor is wonderful...I gave this 4 stars only because I didn't include the shrimp, didn't have any. I actually served this over some Chicken & Spinach patties.  WE LOVE IT!!

As written this was pretty bland. It tasted like a thin version of Newburg sauce. I didnt think it would do anything for the expensive cod I wanted to serve it with so I enriched it with 2 egg yolks and extra cream. There was nothing  about it that suggested Louisiana cooking to me, so I sauteed up some onions, celery, bell pepper and garlic in bacon fat and stirred it in. I also added enough cayenne to get a good Cajun kick.

I felt that it needed more "spice" and needed to be thicker. It was still good but I had to add lots more spice and next time I will try and make it creamier.

Love this sauce. Only thing is that I would like to add some fresh crushed garlic, onion and even a pinch of cajun seasoning next time. I used a whole bag of uncooked frozen shrimp and they were great! Hubby cooked the Yellow Fin Tuna on the grill and we used this on top of it. In addition to adding the onion and garlic, I would like serve this over white rice, possibly without the fish and just the shrimp. Yum. Will definitely make this again.

I just made this and it is fabulous over blackened red snapper. I added a few drops of Tabasco to the final simmer and doubled the recipe, as many reviewers had suggested. The mild flavor of this sauce is perfect against the spicy blackened red snapper. I served it with fresh steamed broccoli and brown rice.

Wow! Fabulous! Most Excellent .... all the above and more.  I used way too much shrimp but whose complaining, should have doubled the mushrooms.  I did use the baby bellas - the strong mushrooms were great with the sauce.  I was afraid the simmering with the shrimp in the sauce would have made them tought but not so.  It was a great New Year's Eve dinner.  thank you

I made this with peel-and-eat shrimp as that's all they had at the store, and served it over grilled Cajun tuna. I wasn't sure about buying Madeira wine specifically for this recipe, but I am so glad I did. It was absolutely delicious. Thanks so much!

Very Very Very Good!!  Made this tonight for dinner and it was oh so good! I could not find Madeira wine so I subbed a dry sherry for it and I also added some chopped shallots that I sauted with the mushrooms. I doubled the sauce so that I would have enough and added about 25 jumbo shrimp The sauce was thin but I didnt care it was still delicious. I served it over cajun seasoned baked tilapia. My six yr old had thirds and wanted fourths I had to stop him lol!

My husband and I both thought this had a really good flavor.  I did add onions and saute with the mushrooms and used fat free half and half instead of cream.  I expected this sauce to be thicker, and even doubled as some reviewers suggested, but was a little disappointed in it's thinness.  We served with seared tuna steaks and herb pasta.  Hubby is requesting again with more shrimp and serving over pasta.

Made this to have over blackened salmon, it was delicious.  I added crawfish tails & a touch of flour, but no extra spices as the fish & rest of meal where heavily seasoned. Didn't have Medeira, but the substitute worked just fine.

This was so perfect! I wasn't sure to spend the money in Madeira but it was excellent and I'll make this recipe lots! It wasn't overpowering our blackened redfish and wasn't  too spicy! I added some flour prior to the cream and some scallions and loved  it!

Absolutely fabulous. I used the inexpensive version of the wine and it tasted great. Super easy to make and would go well over creps too.
