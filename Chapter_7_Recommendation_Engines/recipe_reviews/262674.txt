These were tasty little egg muffins, I made them for breakfasts and snacks.
I altered the ingredients a bit to what I had, I used 4 oz of each by weight of fresh mushrooms, red pepper, onion, pork sausage and cheddar cheese.
For seasoning I used onion powder, garlic powder, Mrs Dash herb and garlic, and black pepper.
I used my # 50 scoop which yielded 19 muffins that baked in 20 minutes. I did not use liners, just sprayed the muffin pans really good with Pam spray.

I made these with ham instead of the sausage, as that is what I had. They were easy, quick, and delicious. I also just sprayed my muffin tin, and used an ice cream scoop, and got 12. I froze what we did not meat, took them out the next day, popped them in the microwave and they were good for a quick breakfast. I will make these again.
