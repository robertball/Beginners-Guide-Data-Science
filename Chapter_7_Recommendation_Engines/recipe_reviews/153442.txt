While this was okay. Not the greatest. I did only have a couple of kids that actually liked it. I love all the ingredients the salad had but maybe not all together as it was, for myself I found me chewing extremely long with the coconut, walnuts and the apples(overly crunchy in bites). Don't get me wrong. Didn't realize it until I have in my mouth before I judged. The flavors were okay, the zing of the cranberries, the sweet of the oranges. This recipe just was a hit and miss...some liked it, some didn't. I was in the middle with it. Maybe if the apples were shredded & peeled, less walnuts, more grapes & oranges, no coconut...that might be a tweak that may work....as is, I won't be making again. As something to tweak for a better fitting for all my kids to like...might be a possibility. Sorry.

This was a nice change of pace.  I happen to be a fan of whole berry cranberry sauce and enjoyed the added textures and flavors of the grapes, oranges, coconut and nuts.   My husband agreed; however, my kids weren't sold.   To each his own, I guess.  :)   Bottom line:  If you tend to like tropical fruit salad and the general taste of cranberry sauce, you'll likely enjoy this.   If you're not a huge fan of either, this might not be your thing.
