very tasty by itself when warm, but put it on cold ice cream and it turns to taffy like someone said. I followed the recipe to the tee. Maybe the ten minutes was too long to cook. Would love to know how to solve this problem.

I followed the recipe to the T, and I even put a candy thermometer in the pot out of curiosity to see what the temp would end up being after 10 minutes (it was 228). The taste is great, but the texture is more like taffy. My daugher reaffirmed this when she said, "It's like eating chocolate laffy taffy." Maybe if I had cooked it for less than 5 minutes...? Any suggestions what went wrong?

I only let the sauce cook for about 6 minutes....the sugar was melted and it was about as thick as I wanted it (and I didn't want chocolate taffy!). Very easy and just what I wanted for my peppermint ice cream!

I love anything Ghiradelli... I love that their products are 100% natural; I am not a fan of any artificial additives.  Ever since I found out that artificial vanilla was made from petroleum byproducts, I have been more discerning what I cook for my family.  This is a wonderful sauce!

I followed the recipe and I had much higher expectations for this.  It's really more like a chocolate syrup than hot fudge sauce.  It was way too sweet for my liking and not what I would consider hot fudge sauce at all.  I might consider trying it another time using evaporated milk instead of water.   Also, the consistency was fine, but I was boiled very gently for 10 minutes due to other reviews.

The recipe worked fine for me.  Made to accompany dessert at Christmas dinner.  Delicious, and my dad (who never cooks) asked for the recipe.  I made the sauce the night before, let it cool, then put it in a bowl covered with Saran Wrap, in the fridge overnight.  Warmed up in microwave - a few minutes on high.

I halved this recipe and it was plenty enough for all four of us for about 3 or 4 nights of sundaes! It was more like chocolate syrup, but I would surmise if you added slightly less water, then it would thicken up a little faster than 10 minutes. I didn't let it boil for 10 minutes.  I stirred the whole time and made sure it didn't boil too hot as I didn't want to burn the chocolate. I added maybe a teaspoon of corn syrup (remember I halved the recipe too) and it still turned out fine. Also I used 100% cacao instead of the bittersweet. I toasted some walnuts at the same time and added them to the sauce. The toasted oils from the walnut really added a LOT of flavor to the sauce and I would say its some of the best chocolate syrup on sundaes that I have ever had! always use Ghirardelli!

Way too sweet! I made it last minute for my husband's birthday dessert ... I wish I'd read the reviews first, which is something I usually do. 
I love Ghirardelli, and I'm so sorry this recipe was such a disappointment. Maybe I'll try it again with adjustments.

Might be nice to add cocoa powder to get the full rich effect. Worked well for our waffle and pancake topping!
