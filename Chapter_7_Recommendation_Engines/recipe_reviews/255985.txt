The flavor of this fudge was good but would have been better if the nutmeg was mixed in rather than just sprinkled on top.  As a nutmeg lover I definitely upped the nutmeg to more than a pinch- probably to about a quarter teaspoon- even for the sprinkle.  I'd use more if I mixed it in the next time I made this.  The texture is on the softer, crumbly side after a couple of hours in the fridge- I would definitely recommend refrigerating overnight.  Consistency is somewhat grainy.

Yummy and rich. I used real rum vs the extract - still was good.

5 stars for flavor and ease of recipe. I wish it wasn’t so crumbly but I’ve made it twice already and got rave reviews!

I used white chocolate chips instead of vanilla candy, mix the nutmeg into the fudge and add chopped pecans. It’s a holiday favorite. I have to make it every year.

It was delicious but way too sweet for my tastes. It did not last long during our Christmas party - it was a hit.
