Delicious. My husband was afraid that the mustard sauce wouldn't go but it turned out to be very, very nice. Kids loved it as well.

man oh man, i'm wondering after re-reading the reviews if i did something wrong. i just didn't find this recipe very spicy. overall, it was good, tho i feel my arteries clogging up as we speak. think i'll half the cream next time. and i also think i'll add some cayenne pepper to give it some kick. this could all be b/c i don't know squat about reducing, so maybe i messed that up (it took longer than suggested to make). there was nothing to drain from the andouille, and no brown stuff to scrape off the bottom of the pan (maybe a function of the non-stick variety), so that may have taken away from the flavor. or it could be b/c i'm from baton rouge and i'm just a cajun/creole snob. i liked it, but will make some adjustments next time. like cubing the andouille instead of slicing it so they're more manageable. and i added toasted pinenuts b/c i love them so much and will do that again as well.

So delish!  Made this at 8:30pm on a Thursday when I was exausted, but hungry.  Never thought that something so fast, and so easy would taste as good as it did.  I didn't have white wine, so I subbed chicken stock from a can, didn't have cream so subbed milk, didn't have fancy mustard so used plain old yellow, didn't have fresh mushrooms so used canned.  So good, even my husband raved about it.  Thanx Lori!

This was fantastic! The flavors were complementary and yet completely unexpected. It tastes even better the next day after the flavors have had time to develop. I did substitute roasted potatoes (quartered new potatoes with some olive oil and salt and pepper and roasted them in the oven until tender and mixed them into the recipe to cook with the other ingredients for about 5 minutes before serving) for the angel hair pasta. I just didn't think the pasta would be a good match for something as hearty as this sauce. I thought it needed something more "rustic." I've made this several times, even for company.

Excellent dish!  As my husband said while eating this dish, "a celebration of flavors"!  The spicy andouille sausage, the mustard flavor and the tender shrimp meld together into one fantastic dish!

This was a great recipe! Could have used a lot more mushrooms, though in my opinion. The mushrooms were so good, maybe because I splashed wine into the pan continiously while cooking them and they soaked up the flavor nicely. I used I added a touch of cayenne pepper to spice it up and grated fresh parmesan on top before serving, it was a big hit.

Perfect just like it is! It IS on the mild side. I love to spice things up. Even if this recipe had called for red pepper flakes I most likely would have added even more than stated. Everyone has such a different tolerance of heat, it's hard to say "this should have been more spicy". I might add horseradish next time. Great recipe! Looks fancy but takes no time to put together.  (My sauce got lost after I added the meat & sauce to the pasta.)

I am very partial to anything with a mustard/cream based sauce. And this was extremely tasty. However, it wasn't as spicy as I thought it could be. Perhaps next time around I'll add come cayanne or creole seasoning.

Outstanding!  We topped it with some capers and got a nice bit of acidity in all that delectable creaminess.    Definitely a keeper!

I thought this was very good. My boyfriend was less than enthused, he is not a big fan of sausage-- which flavor permeates the entire dish. But, to each his own. The wine-cream reduction really does make for a flavorful sauce. I used about 1/2 the amount of cream called for, doubled the veggies, added some green pepper (red would work too I think), and it turned out quite fine. Served over angel hair (I think the delicacy of the pasta highlights the sauce), with crusty french bread and a salad. Oh, and I used a simple grainy deli mustard because I forgot to pick up anything fancier-- and it turned out fine. Thumbs up!

Love this recipe! Only thing I changed was to add a little red pepper flakes since we like things a little spicy.  Did serve with pasta but will make it the next time using another reviewers advise and use potatoes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is great!  Amazing for a quick meal!  I didn't have cream, so used evaporated milk.  I followed the advice of others and doubled the sauce, but it was too much - so the original recipie is probably perfect.

Very good and very simple. Would impress last minute guests as much as a planned dinner party.  I didn't have any mushrooms, so I just left them out, I will try again with the mushrooms.

Delicious!  I had to substitute some stuff and it was still delicious!  I'm sure the original is fantastic.  I used chicken broth and a dash of red wine vinegar instead of wine, 1 cup heavy cream and 3 tablespoons of cream cheese (instead of the 2 cups)and plain ole French's mustard.

It tasted great but despite following directions I can never cook with milk without it getting clumpy, which made it not look so appetizing.  I will try this recipe again.

very very good - but needs extra mustard and spices to give it better flavor.  the cream almost makes it bland, but extra mustard really helps

Cooked this tonight and my husband and I both loved it.  I only made a few minor changes.  I didn't have mushrooms so I substitued red bell pepper in its place.  I also sprinkled the shrimp with Tony Chachere's and let sit prior to cooking.  After reading other reviews I increased the worcestershire to 2 tsp. and I probably added just a little more than 1/2 lb of andouille.  I thought it was very flavorful and absolutley wonderful.

First let me say my husband loved this & it was very simple so we thought    we could make it together. But since I'm the reviewer, I have to say, I didn't think it was that great.  Couple confessions first, used whole milk instead of cream, smoked sausage instead of andouille and peppers instead of mushrooms.  Having said that, the sauce was a little bitter so I mellowed it with some more milk & some sour cream. I also thickened the sauce (since I used milk v. cream) with a little H20 & cornstarch. There was just something odd about dinner, though. I think it was the angel hair.  I'm thinking this would be better over rice.  The sauce is almost gravy like in flavor so it was a little odd with pasta... at least a very tender pasta since it's practically impossible to get angel hair al dente.  Wish I could give it 3.5 stars.

WOW! I was like others when I saw the mustard and cream I wasn't sure about this recipe.  Then I read other reviews and decided to give it a shot.  You will be shocked.  It really does have a unique flavor.  Everything blends so well together.  I used regular cream and it was fine, I think I will even use half and half next time and I added some cajun seasoning to sauce as well as bit of a rue to thicken it slightly. One other recomendation would be to use a slightly thicker pasta, I think the angel hair gets lost. If you like shrimp and andouille give this a try I doubt you will be disappointed.

I used hot Italian sausage, spicy brown mustard, half and half, and thawed frozen shrimp.  Other than that, followed the recipe pretty close.  The sauce was a bit grainy, but it was appearance only.  The taste was great.  My family says this is a keeper

This was superb! Used the exact recipe. Because I'm not a spicy food fanatic, I would give it a four star, but if I was, the rating is correct. Next time, I'll add red and yellow peppers for sweetness and a milder sausage. The sauce was rich and flavorful. The prep time was somewhat longer than 15 minutes, and it was labor intensive, but well worth it.
     I served it with Honey ginger carrots from this website. Yummy!! Thanx, Lori

I found this recipe disappointing.  Especially after reading all the reviews I decided to make this instead of gumbo or jambalaya.  I feel like I wasted all my ingrediaents on recipe I would not make again.  The taste was mediaocre and the sauce did not turn out great.

My husband LOVED this!  I thought it was good too but he went nuts over it.  I used a whole 1b of the sausage and increased the sauce and it was great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Next time I make this, I would use a spicy mustard for more flavor.

I made this exactly as the recipe indicated, but mine did not look like the photo. It looked more like a thin Alfredo sauce. It was great and I will definitely be making this again.

Yes, needs more spice. Next time will add some Cajun spice. I always increase the garlic, but had to salt it heavily, so I think extra spice would help. And I will add about two cups of mushrooms. The half-cup disappeared in the final dish. Good base recipe, though.

The mustard really added a great flavor to this recipe.  My hubby and I thought it was very good.  The only thing different I did was to use half-and-half instead of  heavy cream, since that is what I had on hand.

Great recipe! Didn't have the course grained mustard but added 3/4 teaspoon of Dijon instead. Added a bit of corn stars to thicken the sauce towards the end. Yummy!

We love this and make it frequently.  I usually add extra mushrooms and mustard ( I use regular yellow mustard).  It's awesome and even better the next day.  As with every recipe, season to your tastes.

Was pleasantly surprised by this one! I didn't exactly measure most of the ingredients  (chose to eyeball it) and it came out wonderfully! I know I did use an entire carton of mushrooms and at the last minute threw a bunch of spinach leaves in the mix... will definitely add this to my "special meals" list. Just stole a bite from the fridge and it was delicious cold as well!

GREAT recipe!  My wife isn't big on green onions and I didn't think mushrooms made sense but I decided to make the recipe exactly as it's printed.  I'm glad I did that.  Don't change a thing!  Use quality andouille and, as somebody said, if you don't get "browned bits" in your nonstick pan it's not a big deal.  This recipe is bliss!

I thought this recipe was fantastic.  I followed it exactly.  I felt guilty the whole time eating it because of the cream, but it is oh so delicious and rich.  Next time I will add more green onions.  For more spice be sure to use quality Andouillle Sausage.  I added some red pepper flakes too for a little more kick.  Quick, easy and impressive.

I followed the recipe as directed but added 1 T. Cajun Power garlic sauce (or Poche's would do fine) and it was OUTSTANDING.

This was really good!  I made some adjustments to lower fat and make it slightly healthier.  I used low fat milk (with 2 T of flour added as a thickening agent, corn starch would also work) and low fat spicy turkey sausage.    I added a few handfuls of spinach in the last two minutes of cooking to wilt down in the sauce.  I added some Cajun spice mixture to make it spicier, but next time I think a sprinkle of hot sauce would do a better job and compliment the flavors better.  Finally I garnished with some fresh parsley and pine nuts and served it over whole grain angel hair.  It was still very decadent and really flavorful (those who said it was bland might want to try changing up their mustard as the mustard is really the star of this dish!).  It’s a cream sauce and like any cream sauce I think it pairs perfectly over pasta (and a glass of wine).  I received a lot of compliments and requests for the recipe!  Definitely 5 stars!

This was great! I subbed milk for the cream and left out the mushrooms, and it was a little like a creole shrimp scampi. Yum!

I made this with "Andouille style" smoked sausage (that's all I could find at the store), and I omitted the Worcestershire sauce as I didn't like the idea of it. Upped the amount of garlic, and also added a good shake of red pepper flakes as it was a wee bit bland. Not bad at all. Would be good with chicken/shramp/sausage. Thanks!
