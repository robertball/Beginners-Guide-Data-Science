If you've ever been to Macaroni Grill, this bread is a duplicate. (Now there's no reason for me to go back...) Fabulous! I made this bread by hand, (1. yeast + 1/4 c. warm water, wait 10 min. 2. Add flour, salt, sugar, oil knead like heck. 3. Add the herbs & pepper [I used oregano insted of an italian blend, and rosemary from my own garden] and knead some more. 4. Let rise an hour or so in an oiled, covered bowl in a warm place. 5. Punch down, let rise another hour. 6. Bake at 375 until browned. 7. Remove from oven, brush with olive oil and sprinkle with coarse salt.)Serve with olive oil and fresh cracked pepper. YUMMY!

Amazing bread!  I made this by hand, so I started by proofing the yeast in the water for about 5 minutes, then added one cup of the flour, the sugar, salt, and oil and mixed in my stand mixer on pretty high speed until it was a thick creamy batter (looking almost like pancake batter), 3-4 minutes or so.  Then switched attachments to the bread hook and began adding flour gradually, along with the herbs and pepper.  Knead just until all dough pulls away from the bowl, then finish kneading by hand (about 5 minutes or so).  I make a lot of bread and bread flour is expensive, so I find it easier to buy powdered wheat gluten (which is the main extra is bread flour anyway) and add it according to the package directions (I think it is one tsp. for every cup of flour).  Also, if you are lucky enough to live near a Penzy's Spices or ever order from them online, their Tuscan Sunset Seasoning (Italian seasoning) is awesome in this!!!  I let this rise is a greased bowl for one hour, then punched down, formed into an oval loaf and let rise another hour.  I brushed with olive oil and coarse sea salt before baking, and I also spritzed this with water about 3 times during baking (it gives it that crunchy outer crust, but it still stays soft in the middle).  I baked this about 20 minutes at 375 then turned the heat up to 425 for about 10 more minutes.  Perfect, delicious bread.  My husband has already asked me to make it again soon!

This bread is awesome, just like Macaroni Grille!  The only change I made was using milk instead of water because it makes a more tender crust.  We dipped it in olive oil and cracked pepper and served it with lasagna.  Yummy.  It will make your whole house smell great, too!  Also makes a wonderful cheesy garlic bread!

I let my bread machine mix and knead and baked it in the oven (375 degrees for 30 min.). It was great! Would be good to dip in olive oil with cracked black pepper like they do in the restaurants.

I have no idea what Macaroni Grill's bread tastes like, but I do know THIS bread is just delicious.  It has one more tablespoon of oil than I'm used to using, but maybe that's what made this particularly moist and tender.  Using 2 tsp. of fresh, chopped rosemary, this had just the right balance of flavors. Beautiful, fragrant, and simply darn good.

this recipe is so easy and wonderful.  i used fresh rosemary instead of dried.  i had no italian seasoning so i added a little thyme and oregano.  i think course fresh ground pepper adds a great flavor.  do not use "preground" pepper if possible.

I probably would have given this bread five stars if there wasn't quite so much rosemary.  A whole tablespoon gave it an almost medicinal taste.  Next time I'll use just two teaspoons and I think it will be great.

UPDATE: THIS TASTES EVEN BETTER THAN MACARONI GRILL'S BREAD (I just ate there this past weekend!!!)!!!!! Wow Joe! This is darn good bread!!! I'm not sure if it tastes like Macaroni Grill's bread or not (haven't been to one in ages...), but I bet it does! Made this to go with warm bowls of Andrea's pasta fagioli (also on this site). The combination of the bread and soup was divine! My bf and I really enjoyed our dinner :) I did change things up a bit though.... I put all ingredients in my bread machine (in the order suggested by the manufacturer - wet, dry, yeast on top), turned on the dough cycle and selected the 1.5 lb. loaf setting (this took about 1.5 hours), then took the dough out, punched it down and put it in a greased (with Pam) bowl, turned to coat and covered for 10 minutes. After the dough had rested, I shaped it into a round loaf, covered, and let it rise until doubled in size (a half hour did the trick). Before placing in my 350 degree oven, I brushed the top of the loaf with EVOO and some more (crushed) rosemary and coarse sea salt to taste. The addition of the salt was deelicious and a must IMHO. One thing to note: allow your bread to cool a bit before slicing (we were too hungry to wait, but I wish we had...). Serve with a combination of EVOO, grated Parm cheese and a bit of cracked black pepper, all mixed together for dipping. I think next time I'll add about a tablespoon of Parm to the dough also... Excellent! Thanks for sharing :)

Wonderful recipe!  I loved the flavor and the texture.  I brought 5 different loaves into work, and this was the favorite.  Someone offered me $20 if I'd make him one of his own.

I am a regular bread baker and this is quite possibly the best bread recipe I have ever made.  I used fresh rosemary and did the whole thing by hand rather than using a bread machine.  The bread was delicious. It had a crisp crust and a fluffy interior. Note to beginners that are trying to make their loaves by hand:  before placing the dough in the bread pan, roll/stretch bread into a 16 by 8 in rectangle and then tightly roll it up from one of the smaller end.  Fold the ends of your roll under ensuring that the ends of the dough will still touch the ends of the pan (so that the dough has something to grip onto as it rises).  This procedure will give your bread a nice rounded shape as it rises and give you a wonderful spiraled texture on the inside.

Here are some (hopefully) helpful tips for people who are not using a bread machine for this bread: First turn your oven on to 200ºF (100ºC), for about 10 minutes & turn off. After combining all the ingredients that this recipe calls for, and then oiling the dough & bowl for rising, you have a pretty wet little ball of dough. It will make it harder to rise this way in just your conventional oven, so add a little extra flour (sprinkle by sprinkle) until you get a little stickier consistency in the dough (it should stick to your hands a little bit, but not be like super glue to your fingers!). Once you have this texture, just put a miniscule amount of oil on your hands & rub it on the outside of your dough ball. Then place in a (LIGHTLY) oiled bowl, cover with a moist (not wet!) towel, and put in the oven. Let the dough rise for about an hour in the WARM oven. Check the oven every 25minutes or so to make sure it is still warm, if not, turn the oven back on for a couple of minutes & turn it back off. After the first rising, take out the dough, punch it down (if youre going to bake this bread in a certain pan, this is a good time to move it into that pan). Put back in the warm oven until the dough has doubled in size (covered & all that good stuff as before) again, and then bake at 375º until browned on the outside & cooked on the inside! Yum!!!

I live in an area with quite a few really good bread bakeries and I challenge any of them to come up with a bread this good.  I don't have a bread machine so mixed everything in the KA.  I proofed the yeast in 110 degree cup of water with the sugar and let sit for 10 mins.  Started mixer on low and added the oil, salt, Italian seasoning, pepper and rosemary and 1 cup of flour and let mix for about 2 mins.  Added 1 1/4 cup of flour and let mix until dough pulled away from the sides of the bowl. I kneaded the remaining 1/4 cup of flour in by hand and kneaded for about eight mins.  Placed in a greased bowl to rise, covered with a clean kitchen towel.  I have a range top stove that is lit with 2 100 watt bulbs and it provides a nice warm area for dough to rise.  Mine had an extra long rise time as I unexpectedly had to babysit for a 6 mo. old so it rose for about 2 hrs. Punched dough down and placed on a sprayed cooking sheet in the same shape of the round bowl.  Cut and X in top and left covered with towel to rise for another hour.  Brushed with olive oil, lightly sprinkled with kosher salt and parmesan cheese.  Baked at 375 for 20 mins and raised temp to 425 for 15 mins.  I place an empty cookie sheet underneath and every 10 mins or so throw in a handful of ice cubes, makes a nice crust.  We like rosemary so we didn't think the flavor overwhelming at all.  This would make a great hostess gift for any gathering.UPDATE: Let the rosemary seep in very hot water and cool to 110.

Ohmigosh this bread is so good.  I just took it out of my breadmaker and it is moist and delicious...I actually had trouble cutting it because the inside is so soft (the crust is crispy, though not hard).  I took the suggestions to use 1 tsp of salt instead of 1 1/2 tsp, and I added 2 tsp sugar instead of 1 1/2, and I cut the rosemary back to 2 1/2 tsp.  I am THRILLED with the results - this is definitely a keeper!

I pounded whole peppercorns in a pestle and added this with 1 tablespoon of Parmesan cheese to the dough.
Then slit a cross in the risen bread and baked it in my oven.(25 minutes, 375 degrees) The bread looks really nice this way. The bottom of the bread doesn't sound hollow when you tap on it(the top does), but still it's done. After baking brush with water; it will give it a nice glaze.
We eat the bread with sundried tomato tapenade.
Outstanding!

I didn't make in bread machine, first of all, and I doubled up to make two loaves. Used all purpose flour and one and a half packets of regular (not fast rising) yeast. Dissolve yeast in warmed water (follow instructions on packet) and let stand for a few minutes. I mixed that with all ingredients and half the flour in my KitchenAid mixer with the dough paddle (but you can do by hand). Add remaining flour until dough leaves side of mixing bowl and stickiness is just slight. If using KitchenAid mixer, keep the setting on 2. No matter what, don't mix longer than necessary. Let rise in oiled bowl (coating all sides of the dough with oil) for an hour. Punch down and divide into two parts. Place into greased bread pans and allow to rise again for about an hour. Bake until golden brown at 350 degrees - about 30 minutes. Wonderful!

My favorite bread recipe! Very easy to make and loved by all. Excellent to give out as gifts for Christmas. The amount of herbs (and what type) are very flexible according to taste. I think it's easier to whisk all the dry ingrediants together first to make sure they're properly blended, and then just add rosemary/herbs until it looks good. To make without a breadmaker: dissolve suger into warm water and add yeast. Let it sit 5 or 10 min. Combine the rest of the dry ingredients. Mix with yeast water and knead until soft and elastic. The amount of flour will vary. Don't necessarily add the full amount: add enough that it's not going to stick all over your hands. Not so much that it's flaky (if that happens add a sprinkle of water and knead again). Let it sit in a warm place for an hour (or until doubled in size). Punch down and shape into loaf. Put into a greased loaf pan and let it sit another 30 min. Brush beaten egg over the top to make it shiny. Sprinkle grated parmesan if desired. Bake at 250 for 30 min. Bread smells fantastic baking and is excellent with some marinara and melted mozzerella on top. Always use non iodized salt when baking bread! Iodine affects the yeast activity which makes it rise slower.

This was good, but something was off.  I think too much salt, maybe?  That said, it stayed fresh for a few days, and was pretty tasty.

Lovely, delicately herbed, peppery bread with a fine crumb. I made this without a bread maker. For those without: Proof yeast in water with sugar 10 min. Add all seasonings and butter. Add enough flour to make a soft dough. Knead 10 minutes, incorporating all flour. Allow to rise in a floured bowl for 1 hr or until double. Punch down, form into desired shape, and place on parchment-lined pan. Rub olive oil over top, sprinkle with sea salt/cracked pepper/rosemary, slash top, and allow to rise 30 min. Bake at 375F for 35-40 min or until it sounds hollow when tapped. Fantastic! Thank you.

I did a search on google for Roesemary Bread and this was one of the returns.  Great bread... exactly what I had in mind.  I used fresh rosemary instead of dried.   Also, some people might find this to be a little too salty, I liked it but it seems some might prefer to cut back just a little from the recipe.

Whether or not this is a duplicate of macaroni grill's bread, it is AWESOME!! This bread is everything the submitter describes-great flavor, moist, light and it does have a crispy crust. I made this bread by hand using 2 T (generous) of fresh minced rosemary. I dissolved the yeast in a cup of warm water along with the sugar. In a separate bowl I mixed all the other dry ingredients plus added fresh herbs. I also added a little more of hawaiian sea salt and fresh ground black pepper. I let it sit for an hour to rise under a damp towel, then I punched it down and let it rise another 20 minutes. I baked this at 375 for almost 30 minutes. While the bread was baking, I spritzed the top of the bread with a little water mist about 3 times to ensure a crispy crust. In the end, I had a real nice round golden brown rosemary bread. The wonderful aroma just filled up my house with rosemary fragrance! The crust was light and crispy but the inside was moist and so warm...Mmm.  What was noticeable was the bread itself. I could see the little green specks of minced rosemary throughout the bread. It was just sooo flavorful and pretty! Fresh herbs, olive oil and just the right seasonings made for a perfect bread! I am delighted to have found a solid bread recipe I know I will go to from now on. A simply beautiful, delicious, and fragrant bread!

This bread is wonderful.  However, being a health nut, I feel guilty eating "white" bread; so I added 2 tablespoons of milled flax seed to ease the guilt.  It doesn't change the taste, and adds omega 3.  I use the dough setting on my breadmachine and shape into a round loaf.  Let rise til doubled and bake 375 for 30 minutes.

This bread taste exactly like the Macaroni Grills bread.  I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make it.  I formed into a 6 inch circle, brushed it with olive and baked in a 375 degree oven for about 30 minutes.  What a wonderful recipe.  We loved it.  Good job Jo!

Can I just say "Oh Yea! That's some good stuff, man."?  It honestly tastes just like the bread from the Macaroni Grill.  My husband and I couldn't quit eating it.  Very Good!

Makes wonderful dinner rolls.  Use bread machine on dough cycle, divide into 12 equal balls and place into greased muffin pan.  Let rise to double the size and bake for about 25 minutes.

This is an amazing bread- amazing that I can make it since I'm such a novice!  I took this to a dinner with our old neighbors. I didn't change much except  I didn't have bread flour, so I used 1 1/2 cup regular flour and 1 cup of King Arthur's high gluten flour.  I did have a little trouble with it coming together (I did everything by hand) but I just kept kneading and adding a bit of flour and it worked! I used about 1TBSP of fresh rosemary from our bush.  I kneaded and rose it, formed into buns, (9 buns in a 9X9 pan) then put in the fridge overnight.  Next morning, let it rise again out of the fridge, then 375 for 20 minutes.  Taste and texture are wonderful! Thank you!

I make this a lot using fresh rosemary...I use the bread machine on dough setting, remove dough, and reshape into a round and brush with milk and sprinkle with kosher salt.  I let it sit for 25 to 30 minutes, than bake at 350 for 25 to 30 minutes.  My favorite bread.

I could have never imagined how easy this was. Really yummy too, the kind of bread you can serve with anything and still have it taste delicious. I increased amount of rosemary, and added in a pinch of thyme too. First time using the new breadmaker a definite success, and I will be making this one again. Thanks for sharing, Jo!

Very disappointing.  Made this for a guest dinner and ended up apologizing for it.  It is incredibly bland, the crust turned out too hard and the inside was globulous to the point that I couldn't slice it decently.  If you're looking for a recipe similar to this, I highly recommend the Cheese Herb Bread, also from this site, which bakes up nicer and has a much better flavor.  One of these days I'll learn to stick to ol' reliable recipes when company comes to eat!

my son bought a bread machine for me for  christmas. i have tried many nice bread recipes but this one is the favorite so far!! i made it as directed the 1st time. the 2nd time i used different herbs. the 3rd time i left out all of the herbs but followed the rest of the recipe.. talk about fantastic bread with a nice crust and tender on the inside. the only problem is..i am making bread daily because my son and family want it, my friends want it and i have to save some for myself! you won't be let down by this recipe. it is perfect for the bread machine. thanks jo!! you have turned me into a bread maker who gets rave reviews..all the credit goes to you! i have a loaf in the machine as i type. yummy!!! i also forgot to add..the 1st loaf i sent home to my son and family disappeared from the kitchen counter. they found our 2 year old grandson on the floor and he ate the whole thing hiding behind the couch! so a 2yr old gives it 5 stars also!

I'd give this delicious bread more than five stars if I could. A very easy recipe that produces a beautifully light and fluffy loaf every time. (Of course, that's because the bread machine does most of the work!) I've made this bread twice in the past couple of days. Both times I deliberately left out the black pepper I'm not a fan of pepper. However, I inadvertently omitted the sugar. OOPS! It came tasting good anyway. Also, the one-and-a-half teaspoons of salt was just a little too salty for my taste, so in my second loaf, I cut the salt back to one-and-a-quarter teaspoons. PERFECT! The second time, I also remembered to add the sugar, the amount of which I also cut back from one-and-a-half to one-and-a-quarter teaspoons. Also perfect. (BTW, even though the sugarless loaf tasted just fine, I must admit to liking the sugar-added loaf better.) As for the rosemary and Italian seasoning, in both loaves, I used exactly the amounts specified in the recipe because I found them to be just right just the way they are. I've always been something of a bread "addict," and this is, without a doubt, one of the tastiest breads I've ever eaten.

This is GOOD!  It does taste like the bread at Macaroni Grill.  It turned out softer though, I'd love to get a chewier crust, but I wont complain!  I used my bread machine to make the dough and then baked in the oven at 375 for 30 min (I tested at 20...not quite done all the way through).  I drizzled olive oil on top and sprinkled with sea salt flakes after I took it out of the oven, the loaf is beautiful and so yummy!

This recipe is a keeper.  Next time I will double it.  I made it with the Kitchen Aide stand mixer.  Mixed up last night and put it in an oiled bowl in the refrigerator overnight.  In the morning I let it come to room temp.  Degased the dough and formed into two bowls.  Let rise and baked at 375 on a baking stone for 17 minutes.  Excellent recipe.  Thank you.

Jo, this bread is a real winner!  The crust is crisp but the inside is soft and delicous.  I used the full amount of seasonings. I brushed the top with olive oil and sprinkled on coarse salt and a little rosemary - I did bake it as a round in the oven.  I pre-heated the oven to 425, popped the bread in, threw some ice into the bottom of the oven (to make steam), quickly closed the door, and lowered the temp to 375 - baked for 25 min. Definately a keeper.

OMG this bread is amazing! It does turn out like the bread at Macaroni Grill. I made the dough in the bread machine, then formed a long loaf on a cookie sheet & baked it at 375 for about 20 minutes, then brushed with egg wash & cooked another 7 minutes or so. SO yummy! The whole family absolutely loved it & we will definitely make this a regular on our menu! :)

Very good!  I did what others did and baked in the oven (in two small loaves) after making the dough in my bread machine. My bread machine is for 2 lb loaves, and this recipe is for a 1.5 lb loaf; I wasn't sure how the ingredients and bake time would change, so to be on the safe side I just baked in the oven. It was really tasty, and the company we had over for dinner loved it.

This bread made me look like a superstar!  You should have seen my boyfriend's face light up when he got home from a long day at work to see I made bread from scratch.  I don't have a bread machine, so I used my KitchenAid mixer to do all of the dirty work.  The current highest rated review actually messed me up because they said to only use 1/4 of water to proof the yeast -- WRONG.  Use the entire cup asked for in the recipe!  If you don't, the dough won't be wet enough to come together properly.  So, proof the yeast with 1 cup of water for ten minutes until frothy, then add oil and sugar to the mixture.  I then added the salt, pepper and herbs (all of which I mashed in my mortar and pestle so they released their oils and became fragrant), dumped it all into the mixer, and then slowly incorporated the flour.  The recipe calls for bread flour, but I just used all purpose and it came out great regardless.  Mix with the paddle attachment until everything comes together and is a sticky mess, and then switch to the dough hook.  Knead on medium until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl and begins to look cohesive.  Pull out, roll into a ball, and put in a small bowl sprayed with cooking spray.  Cover with a damp towel and let rise for an hour, punch it down, make ANOTHER ball, and put in sprayed pan and let rise (under damp towel) for thirty additional minutes.  Bake for thirty minutes at 370 -- perfection!

I don't have a bread maker so I just put the yeast in 1 cup hot water for ten minutes, mixed in the rest of ingredients with kitchenaid hook, poured in bread pan and let rise 1 hour then baked at 350 for 30-35 minutes. It didn't get a chance to cool!

Fantastic!  I had to modify a bit tho.  I didn't have Italian Seasoning so I eyeballed some dried oregano and basil then finely chopped up fresh rosemary from my garden.  I also wanted it to be a round loaf for dinner, so I made the dough in the bread machine, shaped into a round, let rise, then before putting in the over (350) I brushed it with olive oil and sprinkled kosher salt over it.  It took about 30 mins to bake.  Everyone in my house loved it, especially with the Pasta Fagioli we had next to it ;0)

So much better than my regular white bread recipe! I did tweak it a bit: I used fresh herbs from my garden; 3 T. of sweet basil and 1 1/2 T. of rosemary chopped up finely. I added more water as well, about 1 1/4 cup and readjusted the flour in consequence to 3 cups and the oil to 4 T. Funny of it does not say on the recipe that it needs to be warm water 110 degrees F , beware novice bakers! Otherwise, the bread is nice and chewy and the crust is crispy. Best bread I have tried so far!

I didn't make this bread in a bread machine, I made it by hand.  It is AWESOME.  So very good!  I was told by everyone to 'keep this recipe'.  They want it again and again.  I just followed the order of making bread by hand-which means you do it all in a different order.  Water, sugar and yeast together-let sit for 10-15 minutes until frothy, add oil and salt, mix for just a min or less-just to incorporate, add flour mix for 5-7 mins, add other seasonings mix for 2-3 mins.  (or if you don't have a mixer with a dough hook, knead well for each of those ingredients for that long). Let rise in mixer bowl  (or other greased bowl) for one hour, shape into loaves, put into greased loaf pans, let rise about 45 mins-1 hour, bake at 375 for about 30 minutes or until golden brown.  If you plan on making it by hand, I suggest you triple it (this will make 3 loaves) to make it worth your while...besides...this bread is SO good...one loaf doesn't last long!!!

Oh my goodness this bread is adorable, served with olive oil, herb’s, parmesan and garlic!  I did make a few small changes to the recipe, I put dried rosemary in a Ziploc bag and crushed with the back of a spoon, so that I did not have long hard grains through the bread, but I still wanted the taste! Increased Italian seasoning to ½ teaspoon.  After removing the dough from the bread machine, I kneaded dough and let sit in a covered bowl for 30 minutes.  Shaped, placed on a baking sheet and cooked for 30 minutes, removed from the oven and glazed with olive oil and topped with crushed sea salt and Italian seasoning and baked for a further 1o minutes.  Delicious!

You've got a terrific recipe here, Jo!  I didn't change a thing except to increase the ingredients by 1/2 to make a larger loaf.  I mixed it in my bread machine, then rolled out dough onto countertop dusted with cornmeal and rolled it into a rectangle. Starting with short end, roll up like a jelly roll.  Brush exposed dough with more cornmeal, and place on cookie sheet, tucking both ends underneath. Cover with cloth, and let rise for 40-50 minutes in a warm room. In preheated oven (375 degrees), place pan of water on bottom rack.  This will give you a crispy crust!  Bake bread 15 - 20 minutes.  Can be eaten plain or dipped in olive oil!  
I took it to my church, and it was eaten up right away with lots of compliments.  Thanks again, Jo!

wonderful bread!  husband declared it to be the best bread i've ever made.  the bread machine made the dough, then i baked it in the oven.  here's what i did:  after dough cycle ended, i took the dough out and kneaded a bit of bread flour into it (about 10 "kneads").  coat a large bowl with Pam, put dough in and cover with plastic wrap, let it rest for 10 minutes.  after that, i shaped the dough into a 'round' on a parchment-covered cookie sheet, covered it and let it rise for 30 minutes.  finally, i baked it for 22 minutes (or until lightly golden brown) in a 375* oven.  HOORAY for bread!!!

Yummy! This recipe is perfect. The only change I made was using 2T fresh rosemary because I love it, and just 1 teaspoon of salt. I have made this bread twice--once totally in the breadmaker, and it was good. The second time I put the ingredients on the dough setting in the maker, then took out the dough and split it into four rounded loaves. I let them rise for another hour and then baked in my oven at 375 for about 40 minutes. I brushed the top with melted butter and garlic salt and these loaves were DELICIOUS!! They were the perfect size to serve one or two people at a meal. I like the shape and crust of the loaves better from the oven rather than the breadmaker. These make very nice GIFTS! Everyone I have given a loaf to has raved. For anyone looking for bread almost identical to the Macaroni Grill bread, this is the recipe for you! Thank you Jo!

I don't have a bread maker, so I do it the old fashioned way, but this bread is soft, savory, and is absolutely delicious served warm with soft butter.  It also makes great sandwiches!  I will definitely be making this bread for Thanksgiving instead of our typical white rolls.  Yum!

I've made this 3 times now -- and that's within the last week.  If this bread has a downside, it's that the stuff is addictive and it's far too easy to eat the whole thing all at once.

It was just a smidge too much like sourdough for me though, so I upped the sugar just a little, from 1 1/2 tsp to 2 tsp.  I like it better that way.  I even tried it with spelt flour for fun.  It doesn't look as pretty that way (the top just looks a little more bubbly & dried), but tastes just as good, if not more so.

Made this last night. It was my first recipe to use in my new Black & Decker breadmaker.  Turned out absolutely perfect!  I've never made any bread before, even in the oven, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I used the light setting for the crust and it was amazing.  The pepper was very slightly overpowering, but that could just be me cause I can't handle spicy anything.  But the herbs were a perfect amount.  The only thing though is that the bread got quite hard by the morning. Can anyone suggest how to store fresh bread like this one?  Also, it cooked for 3 hours on the Sandwich setting. I am assuming that's the same as White setting like it says in the recipe.

I actually had my husband dig through the garage for our bread maker so I could try this, and we both agreed that it was well-worth the effort!  I wasn't able to use bread flour due to food allergies, but it worked very well with spelt flour (though it didn't rise as high as it would have with bread flour).  I added 1/2 a tsp. of garlic powder, increased the Italian seasoning to 1/2 tsp. and used fresh rosemary instead of dried, but those were the only other changes.  We each had a piece cut fresh from the loaf and slathered with butter spread, and it was fantastic.  And oh, WOW, yes it does smell amazing while baking!  Later that day, I used the bread for chicken sandwiches with melted mozzarella, basil, tomato, roasted peppers and sun-dried tomato pesto, and I have not been so happy eating a meal in a looooong time.  The bread totally made the meal, and I know I will be making it over and over again.  I may even have to cede some permanent counter-space to the bread maker again . . . : )  AWESOME recipe for something so simple!

I have never been to Macaroni Grill where this type of bread is popular.  I wasn't sure I would like this because I thought the amount of rosemary would be too strong.  I am NOT fond of olive oil either. But I followed the recipe as written and it was WONDERFUL!  Moist, great texture and neither the rosemary nor olive oil were overpowering as I thought they would be. As with most breads I had to keep an eye on the dough in my bread machine as mine was a bit too wet in the beginning.  I added a few extra tablespoons of flour until the consistancy was right.  I will definately be making this again. This bread is good enough to make several loaves to give as gifts. In the furture though, to make the bread appear more attractive, I would use the "dough option" and shape into a loaf and bake in the oven rather than baking the "squarish" shape that results from the bread machine. I love this bread!!!

I've already made this twice this last week.  It's a great bread!  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.  I also found that it makes a great pizza crust as well-especially with alfredo cheese sauce.  However, I doubled the recipe (used the dough setting on bread machine-not the pizza dough setting) and it made 3 med-large pizza crusts.  Don't let this dough go into a setting that has a rising, (such as pizza dough or rolls) or it will overflow from your bread pan.  Only use the dough setting for pizza crust and let it rise in a large bowl afterwards and then shape your pizza crusts.  This is a definite keeper of a recipe!

Excellent bread. As others have stated, it tastes like the peasant bread from the Macaroni Grill. I also made it by hand--proof the yeast 5 min, knead 20-30 min, rest 1 hour, punch down and rest 1 hour. Bake first 10 min @ 425, then lower to 375 for another 20 min until golden brown.

OUTSTANDING!  Man I wish I'd found this sooner!  I made as is except without the bread machine and without Italian Seasoning (used a pinch of oregano instead).  Baked at 375 for 30 minutes.  Absolutely delish!

Great bread! I made a few alterations to the recipe because I do not have a breadmachine.   1) Dissolved sugar into 1 cup  warm milk (instead of water)- added  1 packet active dry yeast and waited for foam to form (approx 10 minutes).  2) Mixed olive oil, salt and bread-flour into yeast mixture in a large bowl.    3) Kneaded on lightly floured surface for approx 3 minutes then added in 1 tablespoon rosemary and  ¼ teaspoon each of: Italian seasoning, black pepper, Mrs. Dash garlic and herb & crushed red pepper flakes. Kneaded the dough until soft and herbs were distributed (about 5 minutes). *At this time I turned my oven on to 200 degrees. Turned oven OFF after about 5 minutes of preheating.    4) Put dough into a lightly oiled bowl, covered with a damp towel, and put it into my warmed oven to rise for approx one hour.   5) After doubled in size, I punched down,  formed into a loaf and let rise in warm place for another hour (covered).   6) Scored the top then baked at 375 for 30 minutes. Brushed with olive oil after removing from oven.

Made this by hand, and it was the most perfect loaf of bread I've ever made.  I used 5T of olive oil (4 in the dough, 1 to brush top of loaf after it came out of the oven).   The flavor and texture were dead on.  If you're making by hand, bake at 375 for 15-20 min.  Took mine out at 17 min, it could not have turned out better.  This is my daughter's favorite bread ever.

I didn't have Italian seasoning but used a mix of dried basil and oregano instead (in addition to the dried rosemary). This is an excellent bread to go with lasagna, pasta, or served just on its own!

I'm still learning to bake bread, and this ranks as the best so far.  I made it in the KA stand mixer, and the dough was great to work with.  I rolled it out into a rectangle, rolled it up jelly roll style, and tucked the ends under.  I cut the top a little too deeply but, of course, that doesn't affect the flavor.  I used about 2-3 tablespoons of fresh chopped rosemary, and the herb taste was just about perfect.  The bread is very moist, the texture is light, and this yielded one BIG loaf of bread.  Excellent recipe.

Fantastic! I used Tang_29 & Muffinmom's suggestions for making this without a bread machine and it turned out wonderfully (did proof the yeast with sugar and water though). Used 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary from my garden, fresh cracked pepper, and brushed the loaf with olive oil & sprinkled with coarse salt before baking. Gorgeous and delicious; will make again and again. Thanks!

I dug my old bread machine out to try this recipe but I wish I would have done it by hand. Maybe it's the machine but my bread didn't rise as well as it could have. However, the bread smelled absolutely fabulous while baking. Couldn't wait to dig in. It tastes just like Macaroni Grill's bread. I deviated from the recip a bit though. Instead of the Italian Seasoning and dried rosemary I used The Pampered Chef Rosemary Herb Seasoning Mix. I will try to tackle this one again by hand.

This is a winner!  I just got a breadmaker for Christmas and this was my second loaf - ever!  I made the dough in the breadmaker, then put it on a pizza stone to rise for about an hour.  I cooked it for about 30 minutes at 375.  It came out perfect!  I would post a picture but it was gone before I could get the camera.  I will definitely be making this again.... probably tomorrow!!!!  Looks like my no-carb New Years resolution is already shot!

I made this for Thanksgiving yesterday and it was a hit! I had never made bread before and don't have a bread machine so I was a little (okay...alot) nervous. I followed Muffinmoms review to a "T" and it was super easy and super tasty! I did use whole wheat flour instead of white and I put it in the refrigerator over night after first rise. I took it out of the Fridge and let it warm to room temp for about an hour before baking. It turned out perfect....thanks for a great recipe!

Oh my God.  This is one of the best breads I have ever made.  And I love making bread.  I used this as more of a starter, there are so many possibilities!  I didn't have any rosemary (this looks shameful but hey I'm on vacation in an empty house) so I used an herb combination mainly consisting of thyme with oregano, parsley, and basil.  Looking back I'm glad that I didn't have any rosemary.  I make a mean rosemary focaccia and I like that this was something new.  I used a milk/water combo.  I substituted one of the cups of flour (all purpose) with whole wheat flour and added a healthy dose of flax seed.  (you need to add more water/warm milk when you do this) And this also sounds bad (hah) but I usually use my trusty food processor to knead so this was the first time I've done it by hand.  I'm happy it was such a success! Thanks!

The first time I made this bread, I found it a bit salty and dense with the 1.5 tsp salt.  The second time I made it I used 1 tsp of salt and let the yeast warm down to room temperature before using -- the bread was a bit bland, but rose higher and the texture was better.  I think the salt offsets the medicinal flavor that comes from having so much rosemary.  In both cases I thought the bread was quite good; I will make this again experimenting with the salt content.

I made bread bowls with the less salty version: set the breadmachine to dough.  When the breadmachine finishes, split the dough into two, knead a little, and form each portion into spheres (it's easier to do when the bread is a bit taut from kneading).  Then place the two spheres on a lightly oiled cookie sheet and let rise until doubled in bulk (about 1 hour).  Then bake at 350 F (300 in my oven which bakes really hot) for about 30 minutes.  Let the bread cool for a bit, slice the tops off, and use a spoon to hollow out the spheres and form bread bowls.  (We ate the insides of the bowls; the bread tasted so good!)  I put split pea soup (cooked while dough was rising) in the bowls; husband was impressed!  A 1.5 lb recipe makes two GIANT bread bowls.  Next time I will make four bread "cups" instead.

This was a very good recipe.  I would give it five stars, but I am not a huge fan of rosemary!  My husband and mom loved it, though.  Very tasty dipped in olive oil.

I also made this without a bread machine. I just let it rise, punched it down, shaped into two loaves on a pan, let it rise again, and baked for about 1/2 hour.

I have had this recipe in my box for a couple of years, but never made it- until today.  It was fantastic!  I got all of my ingredients ready when I realized I didn't have any rosemary so I subbed 1 tsp of thyme.  It was very flavorful still.  I did make it without a bread machine following other reviewers suggestions and baked at 375 for 30 minutes.  Perfect!!

How have I not made this bread before today? It's out of this world. I can't compare it to Macaroni Grill (never been there), but I've baked a lot of bread, and this is right up there with the best. I used my bread machine to mix the dough, adding a little extra flour to counteract the high humidity here. The dough was perfect. I punched it down, rolled it into a loaf, and let it rise covered on a cornmeal covered cookie sheet until it doubled. I baked it about 23 minutes at 375 and it came out perfectly. (I did use fresh rosemary - about 3 Tablespoons.) I'll definitely make this one again and again. Thanks for sharing!!

My boyfriend loved this, he couldn't believe it was homemade.  I used fresh rosemary from my garden and my kitchenaid mixer to knead, and this was so simple to make.  I'll be making this recipe again soon!

Very Yummy bread! Made dough in bread machine, punched it down after dough cycle and formed into a flat ball. Let rise for 40 mins. then brushed the top with egg and sprinked it with mozzarella cheese, baked in the oven at 375 degrees for 25 mins. Came out great, not to heavy.

This is so easy to make. I don't use a bread maker, so I heat the water to warm (about 45 second in the microwave), and then combine the sugar and yeast for 10 minutes before combining everything else together. I knead only until mixed completely (less than a minute), then I grease a new bowl with olive oil, place the dough in the new bowl, and let it rise an hour. I bake it in a normal loaf pan, and let it rise again about 20 minutes again if I have time, then I bake it at 350 for 25-30 minutes, and it's perfect. Crunchy on the outside, and moist and light on the inside.

I use fresh chopped rosemary from my bush, and typically add dashes of oregano, sea salt, and other similar spices. You can't go wrong!

Absolutely delicious!  The only change made I made was I substitued 1/2c whole wheat flour for bread flour as I prefer whole wheat bread.  I might try more next time.  But otherwise this was great, nice and flavorful-not overpowering.  It went perfect with my homemade chicken noodle soup.  Thanks!!

One of my favorite bread recipes. I make this bread at least once a week. 

I have made some modifications over the years. I add in about 1/3 - 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. I also use about a tablespoon of honey in place of the sugar. I also put 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning.

Everyone who eats this bread loves it!

I made this for a work luncheon & it was a hit.  I followed one reviewer's suggestion and replaced the water with milk & it was wonderful.  The only problem was that I didn't cook it long enough, so it was quite doughy in the center, but no one complained.

I've made this bread twice, now, and it's FANTASTIC.  Tasty without being overbearing;  so soft and light on the inside with a nice crispy crust.

On my second loaf, I substituted 1c white whole wheat flour (+ 1.5c bread flour) and it didn't alter the consistency at all - nor the taste.  Still light and fluffy and delicious - and a bit more nutritious!

Absolutely delicious! I made this in the oven, cooking at 375 until crust is golden brown.  Also brushed crust with olive oil and salt which makes it stellar! I have already made this recipe multiple times, and I can't wait to make it again.  I used fresh rosemary in one batch and it worked out just fine.

Hands down, Awesome! Did everything as is, except, used fresh rosemary and garlic infused olive oil. Can't help it, I have a huge rosemary plant and love garlic. Did everything in the bread machine then took it out and hand formed it. 30 mins at 350. Did someone say OMG! Oh yes, I did and so did everyone else who tried it. Thank you Jo.

I made this bread by hand..1. yeast + 1/4 c. warm water, wait 10 min. 2. Add flour, salt, sugar, oil knead like heck. 3. Add the herbs & pepper  and rosemary (from my own garden) and knead some more. 4. Let rise an hour or so in an oiled, covered bowl in a warm place. 5. Punch down, let rise another hour. 6. Bake at 375 until browned. 7. Remove from oven, brush with olive oil and sprinkle with coarse salt. Serve with olive oil and fresh cracked pepper. YUMMY!

Yummy!  Used fresh rosemary from my garden.  It was so good.  Made french dip sandwiches using this bread...Getting hungry thinking about it.

I just made this tonight and the other reviewers are right - this tastes just like the bread at Macaroni Grill!  I don't have a bread machine, so I followed TANG_29's directions.  I did spritz the bread with water periodically while it cooked to get the crust crunchier.  I baked mine in a round at 375 for 35 minutes.  The crust was crunchy and the inside was a little doughy.  Next time (my husband has requested I make it again tomorrow!) I will bake for 40 minutes and it will be perfect!

YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM! I am amazed. Haha, this was so easy to make, and I had all the ingredients on hand. I used 2 tsp of rosemary and that was plenty. I also used a dash of dried basil and thyme instead of the italian seasoning because I didn't have any. I used by bred machine to knead the dough, then just put it on a baking sheet and baked at 375 for about 30 min. It was so good fresh from the oven and dipped in olive oil. I will definetly make this again, THANKYOU :))

This bread was fantastic, it does taste just like Macaroni Grill!  I made this by hand, b/c I don't have a bread machine.  I dissolved the yeast in 1 c. warm water, and let sit for 10 minutes. I then added the rest of the ingredients and used the dough hook on my stand mixer to knead the dough. I did have to add an extra 1/2 c. flour, because the dough was too wet looking.  I also brushed with olive oil, and sprinkled with coarse salt.  My husband dipped his in a olive oil, parmesan cheese, pepper mixture.  It turned out great!  Thank you for a great recipe!

There goes my waistline!  I COULD NOT STOP EATING THIS BREAD!  I made the dough in my food processor with the dough blade (my bread machine is broken!) with only 2 tsp of rosemary and then I let it rise for an hour in the oven (I turn it on for about 10 seconds, then turn it off and put the bowl with dough in covered in plastic wrap).  I then punched down the dough and shaped it into a long loaf and put it on a cookie sheet dusted with cornmeal and back into the "warmed" oven to rise for another hour.  Then I baked it at 375 for 30 min.  It smelled SO GOOD while it baked and the taste blew me away!

It's fantastic! I am so happy to have this recipe! It is addictive!! I used fresh rosemary- dipped in olive oil with italian seasoning, salt, and cracked black pepper. Would be good with roasted garlic in olive oil, too!!

Excellent recipe that easily translates to a hand kneaded dough with some exceptions, hence four and not five stars:  My first attempt yielded bread that was too salty & like others mention, the dough seemed too wet.  I made the original recipe using my dough hook on my Kitchen Aid.  Then, added additional flour until the dough just began to clean the bowl or still tacky enough to stick to your hands and fingers if you don't cover them in flour.  I also used 1/2 the salt recommended.  Rolled the dough in a large greased bowl, sealed it, let rise for 1 hr.  Punched dough, shaped dough on baking sheet/bread pans, let rise another hour or until doubled in size.  Then baked @ 375 till slightly browned.  I've increased the recipe to triple and even used all purpose flour on many occassions to great results.  And I'm a beginner, so the recipe is very forgiving!

I followed the directions, only I used 1 cup stone ground wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups regular bread flour.  It turned out great!  I also only used the dough setting and transfered to a loaf pan and let rise again.  Baked it at 400 for 30 minutes.  Fabulous recipe!

This was "THE" recipe that started me on the bread making kick.  I'm not very experienced but this bread came out great the first time, even with a cheap breadmaker.  I experimented a bit by adding more and more rosemary and have now perfected the perfect blend.  I settled on 3/4 cup of rosemary for my tastes.  YUM!

Wow!!! This was so tasty! I actually used it as a pizza dough recipe. I rolled it out on my pizza stone, and pre cooked it for about 10 mins before adding my toppings, and putting it back in the oven for an additional 25 mins. Great recipe! :)

What did I do wrong?  Rosemary was too strong. Did you use powdered or did you cut the rosemary up?

Really good "pull apart and dip" bread, not such a good bread for cutting into slices. My boyfriend devoured half the loaf before the rest of dinner was served. Try it with olive oil and balsamic vinagrette!

2 tsp fresh rosemary and 2 cloves crushed garlic really make this an awesome recipe. I used the dough setting on my bread maker, and then made baguette's.

Whenever I cook an Italian meal, this is my go-to recipe.  It bakes beautifully in my bread machine.  A nice departure from garlic bread (and probably less fattening, too!).

Delicious!  Just the way we like our homemade bread - chewy and light.  I followed the recipe exactly except to use fresh chopped rosemary in place of dried.  Wonderful!

Good bread recipe, very similar to the bread served in Monty's Steakhouse in Tempe, Arizona.  I do not have a bread machine, so I fixed the dough by hand as prescribed by another reviewer.  Her directions worked well.  At the end, I formed the dough into an oval loaf as directed.  However, the oval spread out into a very thin loaf during the second rising.  It still tasted great, but I will probably try to figure out how to make it a more normal loaf next time.  The family only gave it 4.0 stars, but the entire loaf was gone by the next day.

This was great! I used Muffinmom's directions to make this bread by hand. I really liked the suggestion of brushing it with olive oil and sea salt before baking. Those additions gave it a nice crispy crust with a little zing. =)

This bread is fabulous!! My husband and I alone finished the entire loaf in 3 days (and we're not big bread eaters). The only changes I made was to use fresh herbs instead of dried. I used 1 tsp fresh oregano and 2 tsp fresh rosemary in place of the dried rosemary and italian seasoning. I will definitely be making this again!!

This is the easiest bread recipe.  My breadmaker, boyfriend, and roommie, LOVE YOU!  

This has quickly become my default bread. I put the breadmaker on the 4 hour setting because it comes out a bit better, but if I am in a rush, the "quick" setting works too, it just doesn't rise as much, but still yummy.  Oh, and I use sea salt instead of table salt, MUCH BETTER taste.

A friend sent me this link, and it is awesome.   Make it with milk rather than water, if you like a softer crust.   If there's any left, serve with chunks of sharp cheddar cheese and hot tea for a satisfying light supper.

MAKE THIS BREAD!  Obviously adjust herbs to your taste - as an aspiring bread maker I have tried many recipies 1 st the old fashioned way after several dissapointments i got a bread maker my theroy to make dough ( cheaper than a stand mixer) it overall has been great this was my first recipe to put in & let machine do it's work- it was excellent- I did add some vital wheat gluten ...yes I wanted it soft but I was fearful of the dense bread & heavy crust associated with bread makers it definitely did it's job but i also made baking myself no VWG and that was awesome too! Excellent the day of but outstanding even 3 days later toasted with a little asiago! Thank you so much for sharing.

Great recipe- turned out to be delicious! I used AP flour, and it turned out fine. Also didn't use a bread machine, just made sure to let it rise near the warm stove. Great with butter and as a side with red meat.

Although I have always used all-purpose flour for this bread and have kneaded and mixed the entire thing by hand, it always turns out great. I use it for dipping in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. When I want a plain bread, I just omit the spices and seasonings. Thank you for a great recipe that supplied my husband and I homemade bread for many months!

The flavor of this bread is PERFECT for dipping in oil and seasoning! I just recently got a bread machine and I wanted to try something simple. This bread is the easiest and tastiest! Definitely a must try! You won't be sorry!

This bread is phenomenally good.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is because I thought it was a bit too salty.  I'm normally a salt junky. so it would take a LOT for me to say that.  Easy fix though, next time I'll just use less.

I also made some alterations to the flour in order to make it healthier and to use what I had on hand.  I swapped 1/2 of the flour for whole wheat pastry flour, and used AP flour for the rest because I didn't have bread flour.  To make up for the subs, I added Vital Wheat Gluten per the instructions on the box.  I also used fresh Rosemary from my garden instead of dried.

The resulting loaf was wonderfully soft and fluffy on the inside and a little crisp on the outside.  So SO good!  Next I'll experiment with using even more whole wheat in place of white flour.

Thanks for this great recipe!

Wow, Joe!  Unbelievable recipe.  I let the bread machine do the heavy lifting on the dough setting, then I scooped it out of the machine, formed it into a round and proofed it for a further 40 minutes.  Baking at 375 for 27 minutes yields a lofty, fluffy italian bread with a perfectly thick, crunchy crust.  I brushed it with olive oil when it came out of the oven and that softened the crust just a touch.  Incredible!  Husband raved!

I'm giving this 4 stars because as written, it needed a few simple changes.
1. increase flour to 2-3/4 cup if you use 1 cup water!
2. decrease salt to 1 tsp- it was too salty for me
3. there is no #3. Like I said, simple changes!
Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars. It always turns out great in the bread machine with those changes and every guest loves it.

Nice, crunchy crust and just the right amount of savory flavor. I used fresh rosemary and was pleased with the lovely simplicity of the recipe. Ate it hot, drizzled with olive oil and sea salt. I could eat a hunk of it for dinner by itself with a glass of wine (and I have!)

This bread is melt in the mouth perfect! It is light and moist. I did as others suggested and cut the salt to 1 teaspoon and it is just at the edge of my salt flavour tolerance but so good! I look forward to paring this up with a stew for supper!

Whoa amazing. I used the white bread cycle with a medium color crust, used a 1 1/2 tablespoons of fresh rosemary. Will be making this again and again and again and again....

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was so good. It was a perfect complement to the food, and also amazing toasted and with butter. I doubled the recipe and we ate both loaves within two days. I'm going to have to make it again soon because I crave it now. 
I used oregano instead of Italian seasoning, but everything else I did the same. I don't have a bread machine or a stand mixer so I did it by hand. It was so easy and turned out great but I really enjoy the whole process of making bread. I know I will be making this often!

Really good.  I didn't have bread flour on hand, so I used AP + and extra 2 Tablespoons.  I also used fresh rosemary, and seeing as how I didn't have Italian seasoning, I used onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, and thyme.  I'd love to try it sliced thick, grilled with olive oil and sprinkled with fresh parmesan.

Fabulous recipe!  I like to use the dough cycle on my bread machine and then bake the dough as mini loaves or in 8-inch pans. When preparing it like this, I usually add a little extra flour to make the dough easier to work with.

We also like to switch up what we use to dip it in (if we use anything at all!).  As previous reviewers suggested, we sometimes use olive oil and fresh ground pepper, but another very good combination I learned at an upscale Italian restaurant is to pour a small amount of olive oil and balsamic vinegar on a small plate or shallow bowl and then top it with freshly grated Parmesan and/or Romano cheese.  Pampered chef also makes good bread dipping seasonings.  

BOTTOM LINE: This bread is delicious and extremely versatile!

If you don't have a bread maker just follow Muffinmom's notes exactly, and it will turn out perfectly.  I've made a few loaves of this with her notes and it turns out fabulous every time.  I should note that I skip the Italian seasoning and it still tastes great.

I'm not a huge fan of rosemary as I think it's pretty overpowering.  My mother-in-law wanted a rosemary bread, so I tried this one.  I was out of Italian seasoning, so I did a few shakes each of basil, oregano and garlic salt.  I used AP flour and two teaspoons of rosemary per another reviewer's suggestion.  This is fantastic bread.  It has great texture, great flavor and was a hit, even for a rosemary-hater like me.  I made the dough in the bread machine and then let it rise in a greased/floured small bread pan.  Baked at 350 for about 1/2 hour and it was perfect.  Highly recommend.

LOVE the bread! When I saw that it was supposed to be like Macaroi Grille, I knew I had to try it! Made as listed, with the exception of adding Vital Wheat Gluten and used fresh Rosemary instead of dried. VERY tasty, especially with dipping oil/spices, but a bit dense.

Love this bread machine recipe. It's so easy to throw together, and it tastes great! It's full of flavor, and indeed has a very moist feel to it. I usually don't like breadmachine breads, but this one is sooo good, on the 1st day, and on the 3rd day... Will definitely make into our family staple!

I am so happy to have found this recipe! Although I have not experienced  this bread  exactly as the recipe reads ( yes admittedly I'm a recipe sniper !? * LOL ) Made a few changes,
Used buttermilk instead of water
Used 2tbl of rosemary (as others stated)
Used 1 tsp garlic powder
Used 1 tsp onion powder
Used 2 tsp yeast 
Also ground the black pepper as I am a black pepper addict.
On the advise of other reviewers:
My first loaf was brushed with olive oil and sea saltand sprinkled with sesame seeds prior to baking. (march 20 2011 loaf was completely GONE ....EATEN by my 17 yr old son and 2 friends in less than 20 mins from the oven)
Second loaf (march 21 2011... LOL) currently in the oven smelling absolutely divine
Brushed with egg wash and sprinkled with sesame seeds.

This was sooooooooo good! Exactly like Macaroni Grill when you make it by hand like some reviewers suggested. If you make it by hand and bake it for thirty minutes at 375, spray some water on it every ten minutes and it will develop that chewy, crunchy Italian crust.

I have made this a few times now and substitute rosemary for the poppy seeds and my hungry guys love it.  This is the easiest dinner bread recipe.  I use corning casserole dishes and save the leftovers to make croutons.

This is excellent. The only thing is Not to double the recipe otherwise it will not cook all the way.

This was really good.  The smell is amazing.  Next time Iwill make it by hand.  It didn't rise very well in my breadmaker.

This bread is a MUST in my house, and it goes very quickly! I've made it exactly as called for, and it's definitely 5 stars as is, but I usually add more spices to it, mainly thyme and a lot more rosemary.

I made this in my bread machine and it turned out beautifully!  I did use lots of fresh rosemary and made my own "Italian seasoning" with garlic powder, oregano and basil.  To prevent your bread from being dense and not rising, don't put the salt in until after your bread machine has completed the first knead.  ....give the yeast a good 10 minutes, plus, to mesh with the sugar.  I'm pretty sure salt kills yeast, and this is probably why some people ended up with a loaf that didn't rise properly.  Mine did.  Very soft inside and a medium chewy crust.  I will definitely be making this again!  For Thanksgiving, in fact.

This was great! Used 2 tsp of fresh rosemary from our yard, crushed and chopped. Otherwise just as is (maybe a little less pepper as I don't like it). It looked really wet in the bread machine but I let it lie, and sure enough, was moist and lovely. The only thing I would do differently is leave it in the oven (baked at 375) for 35 minutes instead of 30 to get the crust a little crunchier. Sure looked lovely though. And my 6-year old preferred the softer than the store crust. My husband LOVED it. Thanks, Jo!

I just realized that I have not rated this, despite the fact that I have made it dozens (yes, dozens!) of times since I found the recipe here almost 4 years ago. I tweak it a little, adding some Parmesan cheese to it (with a little extra water to keep the cheese from drying out the bread) but otherwise, this is a wonderful recipe that smells SO GOOD while baking, and disappears quickly.

wow.  i didn't believe that this bread could possibly be as good as everyone said it was, but it definitely is!  I don't have a bread machine so I followed previous reviewer, muffinmom's directions.  I ended up dividing the dough into 2 loaves and baked for 20 min. at 375 degrees.  Came out perfectly!

Excellent texture. Needs a tad more salt but otherwise, perfect. I ground up the herbs in a coffee mill so the kids won´t complain but I think seeing the herbs might have been better for the grown-ups.

While the flavor of this was great, I won't rate this just yet because this didn't turn out the way it should have. I will definitely try it again. It seemed my dough was actually like a batter and I don't think the yeast is enough. Maybe I miscalculated somewhere because I was doing to much at one time. I ended up going to the recipe exchange to see if someone  could help me fix it before it was too late. Someone suggested to remove the batter from the bread machine and knead in more dough by hand and let it sit in a warm area in a greased bowl. I did just that and made it more like a dough consistancy but it never did rise. Over all the flavor was good and my husband who is not a fan of rosemary bread actually enjoyed it very much. My daughter and I enjoyed it aswell. I'll give this another try and will add the entire package of yeast.

Great Texture, This is excellent bread, but I felt like the amount of rosemary was just a tad too much, next time I will  reduce by half.

YUM!  I didn't follow the recipe  exactly.  I used half whole wheat flour because I'm a health nut like that.  I also didn't have the Italian seasoning so I substituted with oregano, basil, and thyme.  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine and then turned out on a floured surface and added just a tad bit of flour because it was still too sticky.  Then I punched down and made a rounded square and let rise for an hour.  I brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with some extra fresh rosmary I had.  I then baked in the oven at 375 for 20 minutes and then 425 for 10 as another reviewer suggested.  I sprayed with water a couple times to make the crust crispier, too.  I think it's slightly on the salty side (and we like salt) so next time I'll cut back 1/4 tsp.  I may even try making it into bread sticks.  The would be awesome with some dipping oil.  ENJOY!

This bread is amazing.  Absolutely the best recipe I have made from this site - if there were more stars I would use them!  The only change I make is to use the dough cycle on the bread machine, remove the dough and put it in a greased pan and bake in the oven at 350 for about 30-40 minutes.  I like the crust better when it's cooked in a regular pan.  I made this for a charity auction and it went for $9 per loaf!

This bread is beyond amazing.  I used fresh rosemary and it was delicious.  It smelt wonderful while baking and tasted like restaurant quality.  My kids and I ate the whole loaf in one evening.  Tastes perfect with a little "Italian butter" (olive oil & pepper).

Used 3/4 tbsp fresh rosemary and added oregano. This bread is fantastic, though we preferred the oven baked loaf to the bread machine (we tried it both ways).

I'm not a real big fan of bread machines so I did this one in my kitchen Aid and then the oven per Muffinmom's insturctions.  The smell is out of this world while it was baking.  I know this sounds strange, but it almost had the consistancy of a cake donut.....very tender.  My only complaint is that I think there is a touch too much pepper.  I might do 3/4 of what the recipe calls for next time.

I don't own a bread machine so I followed Muffinmom's instructions. This is by far and awat one of the best breads I've ever made. It was so light and airy on the inside with a nice thin crust. I followed the recipe to the T except that I topped it with sea salt, shredded parm, and some sesame seeds. So so delicious.

This is a perfect bread recipe ... very easy and delicious.  I have made it in the bread machine and also just mixed up and kneaded myself.  Works great both ways.  The bread machine gives me a more tender crust but a less interesting texture; when I make my own loaves it has a crisper crust and a chewier texture.  YMMV but it's great either way.

This bread is very good and tastes like the bread you get at Romano's Macaroni Grill. I made it with my Kitchen Aid mixer's bread dough hook. I used Rapid Rise yeast by mixing all dry ingredients in the mixer then adding wet ingredients. Mix for several minutes until a nice dough forms then let rise in bowl covered with damp cloth for 10 mins. Remove from bowl, shape into loaf, cover with damp cloth then let rise for an additional 40 minutes on cookie sheet. Bake at 375 for about 30 minutes until brown. Delicious!

I can't believe I haven't rated this yet. I have been making this bread for over a year now. I don't change any of the amounts, the only "change" I make is to crush the rosemary with the back of a lg spoon to make the pieces smaller. Pulsing in a herb grinder works well too (frugal tip: use a small coffee grinder instead of an herb grinder it's cheaper, but only use for herbs or your coffee with taste weird). Every time I go to make this recipe I have to print out a new copy because I keep giving my copy away. This is one of the few recipes from this site that I just can't get enough of. Thanks Jo!

This bread is fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly and I let it mix in my bread machine and rise twice but baked it in the oven. How I did this is, I put the dough on a non-stick sheet on a tray in the middle of a cold oven and put a tray of boiling water beneath the dough to help it rise while I was out of the house. I was gone for a little too long and it over rose, collapsed a little to a foccaccia bread style, but I turned the oven on at 170 degrees C, kept a good eye on it (even kept the water on the tray beneath it) and it was wonderful. Not real keen on the olive oil and black pepper, to serve it with, I think I'd prefer a ranch sauce. Fantastic taste, just perfect as written. You could take this bread to any dinner party, friend's house or gathering and everyone would love it. Oh yeah, I let the yeast sit in the water for 10 mins until frothy.

This bread was my lifesaver this Thanksgiving! I was in charge of lunch for the first time this year, and due to allergies I couldn't use ANY of the premade stuffings that you buy in the store. Sooo.... on Saturday I started the first of my 5 loaves of this bread. It is so good! We even ended up cutting into one of the loaves before even making it into stuffing. Thank you so so much! This is now my number 1 bread recipe.

Recipe is a keeper!!!  I've made this a few times allready and it does NOT last in my household!  I used the bread machine a couple of times and then for a party at work, I took it out of the bread machine after the rising process, BRAIDED IT AND BAKED IT IN THE OVEN. Everyone loved it! I added extra rosemary and cracked pepper...delicious

Found the rosemary too strong for my liking, so will decrease next time & add some garlic. Substituted with white Spelt flour & adjusted the water to 3/4 cup. Used the dough cycle then made into a french loaf & let rise 30 min. Brushed with an egg white & sprinkled with sesame seeds. Baked @ 400F X 30 min. Great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe.  My husband and I now use it as our basic bread recipe (minus the herbs) — we like that it's vegan (we like to take a break from meat and dairy when it comes to our bread) and we use organic whole wheat flour and often turn to hemp or flax seed oils instead for the Omega 3.  I do love smelling the olive oil as it bakes, though!!  We use sea salt and raw sugar insead of white salt and white sugar.  I've also modified the recipe to include toasted sesame, poppy, pumpkin, sunflower and flax seeds (1 tbsp of each) — it is delicious.  Thanks so much for this versatile recipe!!  It's a keeper.

Highly recommend this recipe to everyone!

I made 8 dinner rolls to go with my meal. 
Some modification has been done.
First of all, I substituted all the dried herbs with the fresh one - finely chopped 2 tablespoon of rosemary and 1/4 tablespoon of thyme.  Thinking of trying some other kinds of herbs.
Second, I may reduce the amount of olive oil in the recipe.  Because I knead the dough by hand, 1.5-2 tablespoon may be just right. 
Overall, I think this is a very flexible dough which you can probably use all kinds of herb that you like.  Olive oil does bring out the flavor of the loaf and make that soft.  Definitely to make this again!

Ok, Jo....this has got to be the BEST bread! I've been baking a lot since i got my new bread machine and we really enjoyed this recipe.  Even though I made some changes, I know it would still be 5 stars if I didn't make them. I used milk instead of water.  Brushed the top w/olive oil.  I made the dough in the machine but formed and finished it off in my oven for 30 mins @ 375.  I also did half white/half wheat flour and it still turned out perfect. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!!!

Very good. The only changes I made were: 2 t. sugar & 1 t salt. I used fresh rosemary, about 2 T. The recipe came out very well in my breadmaker. We dipped in olive oil & balsamic vinegar. Thanks.

This was wonderful.  I sub 1/2 cup buttermilk and 1/2 cup 2% milk for the water and set on light setting and when it came out I drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with fresh grated parmesean cheese and fresh grated pepper.  My neighbor said it tasted like bread from Maccaroni Grill.  Thanks for sharing.

Jo, I thought this recipe was awesome! It is different from the ordinary.  I think this would complement any Pasta dish.  Mine came out soft and light and the crust was very good too.  Thank you!

This was so easy and so great.  I have very little experience with my bread machine outside of using a mix and this was soooo easy.  YUM!  My husband loved it too.  I didn't even measure the herbs, just sprinkled it in until I thought it looked good.

I used fresh rosemary, 2 sprigs about 10" each.  I baked in the oven in mini loaf pans for 30 min.  Great results.

I made this by hand and baked it at 350 for around 35 minutes.  It was relatively simple and turned out quite well, especially for a first try.  My friends loved it so much that I barely got to try it.  I will most definitely be making this bread again.  Thanks!

Fantastic Bread! I loved it, the best homemade recipe I have tried!!! I didn't realize thought that the recipe was for a smaller loaf. So I made it a second time and changed the amounts of the ingredients to be equivalent for a 2 lb loaf....4 cups of flour ect. Thank you so much for such a fantastic recipe. Everyone in my family loves it!

WOW!!  That was the best bread that I have ever eaten.  My husband loved it as well.  Some of the suggestions said to use milk instead of water, so I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 water and it turned out perfect.  It was crusty on the outside and super moist on the inside.  Yummy yummy!!!!

This was the easiest bread to make, and it was great.  My husband and I couldn't stay out of it until dinner....we kept slicing off a piece.  Cannot wait to try some more recipes!  Thanks for sharing this one! We will definitely be making it again.  It goes great with Italian food!

This was my third try making bread in my new machine and the first recipe that really worked.  This recipe is so good!  I didn't have rosemary so I just used italian seasoning and a little parmesan cheese and it was delicious and perfect just like the reviews say.  This recipe is a confidence builder if you're just starting out with you bread machine.

This is the best bread recipe I have ever used! The base alone is great. I made the bread into a cheesy herb bread by adding various herbs and shredded osiago, ramano and parmeson cheese (all in a tub_

This is a very tastey bread.  A little salty though.  Next time I will use less salt, probably only 1 tsp.  I crushed the dried rosemary with a mortar and pestle.  Tastes a lot like Macaroni Grill's bread.  Delicious!

This was a really AWESOME bread!  I was craving Macaroni Grill's bread, and I thought I could put my new breadmaker to use!  I used fresh rosemary, and it came out divine...perfect for ripping up and dipping in balsamic vinegar and olive oil!  The bread doesn't keep very well, and the crust was tougher after a day, but make this for dinner one night, and it should be gone anyway!

This is really, really good. I thought it a little salty but mea culpa, as I used the Good Seasonings Italian dry salad dressing mix, which also contains salt, as well as adding the salt the recipe calls for. Next time I will omit the salt if I still have to use the Good Seasonings stuff (it was the only italian seasoning I had in the house).  I used whole wheat flour, and added 2 Tbs of vital wheat gluten, but used the Basic setting (not the wheat setting), with a light crust option. I also used fresh rosemary (I didn't have any dried). It rose beautifully, with a nice crust, and my visting family is lovin' it. I would like my hubby to taste it this evening...but I don't know if there will be any left, because my little brother has already made himself several big sandwiches...he's running through the loaf pretty darn fast :-)

This is my second recipe attempt with a bread machine. I followed the directions and put all liquids in first, followed by dry ingredients, yeast last. Smelled wonderful while baking but it didn't rise. What did I do wrong???

Delicious! My daughter who's six, said it's the best bread she's ever had. I used fresh rosemary and took it out of the bread machine to bake in a convection oven. Next time, I think I'll add parmesan cheese.

Made this exactly the way it called for except I used the dough setting on my bread machine. I then shaped it to fit a large bread pan. Covered it with a damp cloth to rise another 45 minutes. Then I cooked it in the oven for about 30 minutes at 375. Finished by brushing some olive oil on the top and sprinkled coarse salt and garlic salt. Cooked it a final 5-7 minutes or until light golden brown. Awesome recipe!!! It's a keeper!

I made this by hand, and it was absolutely delicious! I baked it on a pizza stone with convection, and I will definitely be making this the next time I have company. It stays soft and moist for a few days, too. Excellent!

Excellent as written. But I also used Lemon infused olive oil, which was fabulous.

This is my go to base bread recipe and I've used it for years.  It comes out perfect everytime.  I just change to herbs and seasonings for whatever flavor I want.  I replace a portion of the water with milk for a lighter crisper crust, which are the only changes I make.  Makes a small loaf so increase serving size if you have a bigger bread maker like me.

I received a bread machine for Christmas today, and this is the bread I made for our meal.  I had planned to just make the simple, recommended bread from the machine manual, but it called for powdered milk, which I didn't have on-hand.  I remembered that I found this recipe last week, and I had all the ingredients, so this is what we went with.  ~~~  We were really happy with the bread!  My husband had the first piece, and said it was like bread we'd get at an Italian restaurant.  I was feeling apprehensive, since it was my first time using the machine, but we're so happy with how it turned out.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

I have made this bread many times, as it is exceptional.  Recommend no changes other than cutting salt to 1 teaspoon.  Don't be afraid of all the rosemary!  I actually bought rosemary in bulk on Amazon just so I can make this bread frequently.  Alot cheaper there, and stores well in freezer.

This bread is amazing. I hate the shape of bread machine loafs, so I usually run this through the dough cycle and bake it in my oven. Although really great on it's own, I like to mix it up a little bit. For one I use fresh rosemary and chop it up. Perhaps that's why some people find the rosemary taste overwhelming? Dried herbs are usually stronger than fresh. I don't change the measurement of it - I still use 1 tablespoon.  I also brush it with olive oil as suggested by a few people and sprinkle kosher salt across the top. Again as some people recommend I bake it at 375 for 20 minutes and then bump it up for the last 10 minutes to 425 for 10. This will ensure a good crust on it, and spritzing with water 3 times during cooking will help it even more (every 10 minutes of cooking). The smell coming from the oven is amazing, and I usually make 2 loaves so that I can freeze one for later.

Easily the BEST Rosemary bread I've ever made! Thank you so much for posting this one. I followed it to a "T" just double it though since I can't make it fast enough. Also, (purely by accident) I allowed the bread to rise three times (an hour each, followed by punching it down at each interval) and it came out even lighter. I did take the recommendation of another poster and every 10 min during baking threw in an ice cube to provide steam which gave a crisp outside while keeping it soft inside.

Out of this world delicious!!  Used fresh rosemary (snipped small measuring 1 tsp.).  Used white all purpose flour. Warmed water to 110 degrees.  All other ingredients exactly as written.  Cooked fully in bread machine on "basic bake" cycle.  I have an old Sanyo bread machine (The Bread Factory Plus).  Turned out absolutely delicious!!  First bread I really enjoyed from my bread machine... :)

I have made this bread many times and it is always delicious. When I've brought it to potlucks, I even had one girl who said she doesn't like bread take 3 slices. I told her she probably doesn't like store-bought, and that she should consider a bread maker. ;) 

Thanks for the great recipe!

This was my first loaf of bread that I made in my bread machine, and it was so good! I used fresh rosmary and I used 1 tb of basil infused oil. It turned out awesome. I also used 1 cup of wheat flour instead of the white. Everything turned out really good. I will make this again and again.

Wonderful flavorful bread.  Only mixed it in the bread machine and then baked in the oven for about 25 minutes at 350.

I've made this twice. The first time I realized halfway through that I didn't have the rosemary needed and substituted basil and thyme. It was good. But with the rosemary (exactly as written!) it is excellent. Where I live, you can't get bread flour, but even with all-purpose flour, this recipe works perfectly and is delicious. I'll be making it again soon!

Just made this a couple hours ago and it came out fantastic. Since I didn't have any dry rosemary, I just used some fresh instead (around 1/4c since I wanted a lot of it) and I added 2tsp. of italian seasoning rather than 1/4tsp. I only had the machine knead and proof the dough, I took it out after the second rise and formed it into a loaf then I baked it at 375 for about 25-30mins and brushed it with olive oil after and sprinkled some kosher salt on it like one user had mentioned. I will definitely be making this again =D!

Please allow me to mimic as previous reviewers have said. Best bread recipe ever! It does taste just like the bread from Macaroni Grill. REALLY great stuff. Light and fluffy and packed with flavor. REALLY delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, just adding each item from the top down. Make sure to use warm water, not cold since it could mess up the yeast.

A fanTASTIC bread. I enjoyed every bite of this bread in sandwiches or as toast.
BIG tip: Use homegrown, fresh rosemary; it's much more flavorful. but I can't seem to grow enough rosemary to keep up, now that I've found this recipe. ^_^ If you don't grow it, find it in your local farmer's market.

I adapted this a bit by putting in less rosemary but I added 2 tablespoons of grated romano and parmesan cheese.  It was smelling so good while cooking I didn't know how we could wait to eat it once it was done.  Delicious and will make this one again

This is my standard recipe for when we have guests for dinner because it always turns out slightly crunchy on top while soft & tender inside.  Delicious! As other users have suggested I substitute milk for water and add some crushed garlic for a little extra zing.

I made this exactly as instructed and it turned out fantastic.  When I make this, not only does the whole house smell fabulous, but it gets eaten before it even cools.

Wow that was some good bread!  This was my first time making bread (using my moms bread maker) and we loved it!  I remember not liking homemade bread growing up but this sure changed my mind.  I'm officially hooked to bread making and thus recipe will be a staple in the house.

This recipe is oh so good!! The only change I made was that I used one teaspoon of rosemary instead of a tablespoon but that was just family preference. YES! it taste just like the bread at Mac. Grill as others have posted. This is the best bread thats EVER come out of my bread maker... ever! Enjoy!

I have been making this bread for a couple years now, and make it by hand- often using fresh rosemary from our garden- kosher salt to top it with and always makes the family happy!

Wow, amazing. I did not know that bread could come out so well in a bread machine. This bread has a fabulous flavor, and is so light and airy with a crunchy crust. I made the recipe exactly as written and would not change a thing. A definite new favorite in our family.

So so so yummy!  I baked this bread in the oven instead of bread machine and it was wonderful.  Most of the loaf was gone by dinner!  Definitely  mix olive oil and fresh ground pepper to dip this bread in.

This is just as good as Macaroni Grill bread or better. My family went nuts for it. I made the dough in the bread machine and used quick rising yeast. Then, I took it out and baked it in the oven for 20 mins at 350, and 10 mins at 450. I brushed the top with some olive oil and served it with olive oil and pepper to dip it in. Outrageously good!

This was really good bread! Definitely like Macaroni Grill's and good with olive oil. It was a little too salty for me so I'm going to cut that down next time, but otherwise perfect! Nice, light and fluffy bread. Will definitely bake again!!!

I absolutely love this bread!  The rosemary is just enough and it makes a delicious bread, soft inside and a smidge crispy outside.  Five stars.

Like another reviewer, I made these into rolls (15) and baked at 375 for about 15 minutes. The flavor of the rolls really went well with roast beef.  The dough was too wet and I needed to add about a 1/4 cup of extra flour (used half of cup of wheat bread flour since I ran out of white). I used the bread machine on the dough cycle and let raise for about 45 minutes before baking.  They never really recovered from the shaping process, so I think an extra 1/4 teaspoon of yeast would help with that. Will play with the recipe a bit next time I make these.

absolutely amazing. i accidentally left out the black pepper (something I'm not to fond of anyway) and it still turned out beautifully. i love to make tomato basil mozzarella paninis and the best bread to use is rosemary. unfortunately every time i go to the supermarket they are out. now i don't have to worry about that. Thank you a millions times over, this bread is better than from the store and it costs about 1/10th of what i would have paid. it is also wonderful with a lemon, basil and garlic compote.. soo yummy

LOVED THIS BREAD!  I changed one thing on this because I liked the traditional bread loaf look.  I used my bread machine just to make the dough, punched it down once, let rise for one hour, punch again and let rise another 45 min and bake it in the oven.  SO YUMMY!

I made this for my family tonight and we ate the whole loaf! I did cut back  the rosemary to 1.5 tsp since my husband doesn't care for it. I also ground it up with a mortar and pestle. I added a little wheat germ too. Delicious!

Awesome can't even begin to describe this recipe.  It was just what we were looking for. I made it in the oven just like in the first review I read and it turned out great!  The entire family loved it with the olive oil and rosemary/garlic dip.  I did form it into smaller individual rolls.  Because it takes so long waiting for the dough to rise I am going to try freezing some and seeing how they turn out.

I am still a novice baker but even I was able to make this without a bread maker. Big hit with my family and I've made it multiple times now. It is now one of my staple recipes!

Read the recipe this morning before leaving for work.  My husband made it, and by the time I got home it was sitting on the counter.  
Absolutely delicious!  Will definitely be making again.  Thank you for sharing.

Truly delicious! I separated this into smaller loaves and baked them in the oven at 375 for about 15 minutes. I did need to add at fair bit more flour as I kneaded this, but wonderful none the less.

We used this for dipping cubes for Welsh Rabbit.  Outstanding!  I used generous amounts of the seasonings, pepper, rosemary, & Italian seasoning.
Thanks Jo.

I made this by hand because I don't have a breadmaker (had to knead for 20 minutes - make sure to use the "window pane" test before you bake, or it turns out very dense). Wonderful taste! Dipped it in a recipe I found for Carrabbas's dipping oil. Heavenly!!

Smells so good baking in the oven! And just had a bite of this, SO GOOD! Will have to make this for company.   I followed a combo of reviewers and hand made this: 1 packet yeast with 1/4 c. warm water to 120F, sit for 10 minutes. Added rest of water (3/4 cup water), flour, salt, sugar, oil, rosemary, pepper, and Mrs. Dash. Kneaded for 10 minutes, let rise in oiled bowl, covered, 1 hour. Punched down, let rise another hour. Placed in greased loaf pan, brushed olive oil on top and sprinkled kosher salt, and let rise 10 more minutes. Baked at 375 for about 25 minutes till toothpick came out clean and it was golden brown.

Absolutely delicious! I threw all the ingredients into my bread machine and then took it out right before it started to bake. Put an egg wash over the top & some poppy seeds then in my oven at 375 degrees for 25-30 minutes. This is the perfect bread to dip in some balsamic vinegar & oil!

My bread came out rather dense.  It was still delicious, though.  I served it with chicken stew.  It was divine dipped into the thick gravy.  I didn't have italian seasoning so i just pinched variuos herbs in the bread machine.

The smell of this bread baking is worth 5 stars by itself!!  But, the bread is yummy, too.  The key to this bread is fresh rosemary.  Always use fresh, if possible.  Just double the amount of the dried measurement.  It's crusty on the outside and moist on the inside.  Can't wait to try it again!!!!

This was a very yummy bread! I used fresh rosemary instead of dried and added 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, and we dipped it in flavoured oils.    The bread wasn't as crispy/chewy as I had hoped; its consistency was more that of regular bread.  However, my bread machine only goes down to a 2 lbs loaf, so that might be why.

This bread is so good!  I even left out the oil on accident, and it was still delicious.  I don't have a bread maker, so made it by hand using another posters instructions- sliced it, put some butter, garlic salt and mozerella cheese on it, and broiled for 3-4 minutes.  I served it to guests, and it got rave reviews!

I can't compliment this bread enough.  Everyone I've had sample it agrees it's the best bread they've ever had.  We lightly butter it and then put plenty of fresh ground pepper on it.  If you're baking it in the oven, bake @ 375 just until nicely browned, but not dark.

Produces a light textured, fragrant and flavorful loaf with a slightly chewy crust. I prepared this in my KA and simply set the formed loaf on a parchment lined baking sheet, gave it an egg wash and sprinkled with kosher salt, sesame seeds and a bit of the rosemary. Wonderful.

I followed muffinmom's advice since I don't have a bread machine.  I accidentally used a whole packet of SAF gourmet yeast, not realizing that it was more than the recipe called for, but it didn't seem to hurt anything.  I formed it into a round loaf and let it rise the second time on a wooden cutting board sprinkled with corn meal, and brushed it with olive oil and sprinkled it with Kosher salt.  Then I preheated my oven with a pan of water in the bottom and my pizza stone on the middle rack, sprinkled with corn meal.  When the bread was done rising, I transferred it to the pizza stone and sprayed the top a few times with water.  I baked it as muffinmom suggested, spraying again with water when I upped the temp.  When it came out, I just put it on a plate and let everyone tear off however much they wanted.  I also had olive oil/balsamic vinegar on the table for dipping.  My husband said it was the best bread he'd ever had in his life, and my gourmet chef of a mother-in-law had thirds.  All my kids asked me to make it again right away.  I will definitely be doing so!  Thanks for the recipe Jo!

My favorite bread recipe so far. It turned out perfect. I added some freshly grated Parmesan/asiago cheese at the start of the baking cycle and it turned out perfect. I served it with oil and a little Italian dressing. It was delicious!

I made 3 loaves of this bread by now thats cuz my family and friends enjoyed it everytime it was made! I used some tips from the reviews and this is how I made it- everything according to the recipe, but used fresh rosemary and half the amount of salt and a cup of milk instead of water. I used instant yeast instead of active dry yeast. I added the instant yeast directly to the dry and wet ingredients all together and then kneaded by hand for about 8 min and in the last 5 min left the oven to heat up at 90C and then turned it off. Covered the dough with a wet towel and left it in the oven to rise for 1 hour (cuz instant yeast works faster) and then took it out and let it rest for 10 min outside the oven, still covered and let the oven preheat during that time at 200C  and let the it bake for 35 min. When  the bread just comes out of the oven the crust was hard, but once I brushed it over with olive oil (as soon as its out of the oven) it softened. I let the bread cool for about 20 min  before cutting it so that the bread structures right.

This bread is SOOO tasty.  My family wants me to make it every day.  The change I made to the recipe was to throw it all in the breadmaker and use fresh Rosemary.

Excellent flavor. This is a 1 1/2 lb. recipe for those who are newer to bread making and may have a multi-size maker. This would be excellent on dough cycle and baked in the oven, but turns out very good in the bread maker when in a rush. Easy recipe to switch up herbs if you choose. This one will be made a lot!

WOW this is some amazing bread! My grandson could not stop eating it. I made a dip for it using Virgin Olive oil, dash of oregano, basil, and ground garlic salt, literally heaven on earth. This recipe is going to the front of my recipe file. Can't wait to fix it for my niece who thinks she can out bake me!!!

Threw the ingredients into my breadmaker before I left for the day and when I came home my apartment smelled amazing!! It's soft and moist on the inside, and has that nice little crunch on the outside. Full of flavor! Excellent recipe that I'll definitely keep.

I don't have a bread machine so I had to do this by hand. I was a little nervous that it would not turn out, especially when it did not rise. I still put it in the oven and man am I glad I did. It was excellent. Just like Macaroni Grille's.

This is delicious bread! The texture is great, and the flavor is wonderful. It is a little on the salty side, think next time will try as other reviewers said and cut it back a bit. I did use the dough cycle on my bread machine then shaped it into two round loaves which I let rise and them baked in the oven on my stone for about 17 min. on 375. I tossed a handful of ice cubes on the bottom of my oven as was suggested to get a crisp crust; not sure that made a difference.

This is wonderful!  I used a little dried basil, oregano and thyme as my Italian seasoning, and used fresh rosemary, very finley chopped.  Also didn't have bread flour, so I used all-purpose and added about 2 1/2 tsp. wheat gluten and it came out perfect!  Soft, chewy, with the perfect amount of rosemary flavor.  I might try reducing the salt next time - it seemed very salty at first - but it's still a tasty bread.  Was perfect for dipping seasoned olive oil (garlic, pepper flakes & parmesan)

Fabulous!  It works well to substitute 1/2 whole wheat flour.  This bread is great served with a small dish of dipping oil (extra virgin olive oil is good) with parmesan cheese and freshly ground black pepper sprinkled on the oil.

Wow, what a great recipe!!!!  I have made this recipe a couple of times and have switched out the herbs to what I have on hand.  Always taste great.  I especially like that the texture the bread the next day is still good.  Sometime home made bread has to be eaten the same day, but this one last a day or two.  Thanks for sharing

this is a very nioce herb bread. Highly recommended. subtle and tastey. We placed a pan of water on the bottom of the oven and sprayed the loaf durinf baking with water - we have been told that this, along with a higer temperature results in a thicker crust.   We loved it !

One of the best breads I've ever made!  I used unbleached all-purpose flour and it turned out great.  Let my bread maker mix the dough and cooked it in the oven on a baking stone @375 for 30min.  Brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with salt and a wee bit more rosemary.  My in-laws raved!!!  They are 100% Italian.

I don't have a bread machine, so I made this in my stand mixer.  I've never made bread before and was unsure of how to blend the ingredients without the bread machine, so I followed roughly the directions of another bread recipe on this site.  I first mixed the water and yeast (didn't add the sugar at this point as I forgot to "feed" the yeast).  Then I mixed all the remaining ingredients together (used all purpose flour).  I added more flour to help the dough ball form because my dough was wet.  I eyeballed fresh rosemary and added oregano and basil as I don't have any Italian seasoning.  My friends loved it!  It bakes one small loaf which is just enough.

Too much rosemary. Bread had a medicinal flavor.  I will make this again, with maybe half the rosemary.

I make this bread in my Kitchenaid, form into a round loaf, and then bake at 375 for 30 minutes. Very easy to make, smells amazing, and tastes great. It was a big hit at church.

This is quite good!  I didn't have any rosemary (which is shocking - I LOVE it and normally have some!)...I used Italian seasoning, basil and black pepper.  I only gave four stars simply because I prefer a slightly heavier bread.  I will absolutely make this recipe again.  It's fab for grilled cheese with soup too...comfort food!

I don't know that it tastes like the Macaroni Grill's Bread, but I do know that it is very good...I made a 1 lb loaf in my bread machine, but hope that I can double the ingredients to make a 2 lb loaf as that will last much longer (AHA about  4 hours instead of 2) in my family!!!!!

This was very good. I made it in the oven because I don't have a breadmaker, and I used 1 cup of wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups of white, it still turned out moist and yummy. If you like herbs in your bread then go for it, otherwise don't bother.

This is amazing bread. I was a little worried, as it was so gooey, that I added another 1/2 cup flour. I used whole wheat flour for half the flour called for. Excellent! I didn't have Italian seasoning, so I made my own, using equal parts of dried basil, oregano, and thyme. Also,this bread is great dipped in olive oil:)

My, my!  This was so good!  I served it with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, with fresh ground black pepper and fresh ground Italian seasonings.  We didn't eat it all the first night, so I heated the remainder in foil in the oven for about 15 minutes, and it was still very good.  I saw some ratings that said their's didn't turn brown, but mine came out golden brown.  I used bread flour instead of all-purpose flour.

THIS DESERVES 500 STARS!  So delicious.  I used 1 cuo whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (not bread flour-didn't have on hand).  I dry my own rosemary and used mortar & pestle to grind it.  As others suggested, brushed with olive oil when hot and sprinkled with coarse sea salt.  So tender inside, crusty outside.  Will become a regular bread at our house!

Very rich bread. Note that this makes a loaf sized for a small bread machine - makes a very small loaf.  I realized that before the bake cycle, removed it and put it in a small 8"x4" bread pan to re-rise and bake.

This is the first recipe I made in my new bread machine and it was AWESOME! I followed the directions exactly (which I rarely do). It really does taste exactly like Macaroni Grill bread. YUMMY!

Dough was too wet, had to add more flour. Also, I don't own a bread machine (it's frustrating, really, for a hand-baker like me to look up bread recipes and only find machine recipes) so I was really glad to follow some other comments' suggestions on baking without the bread machine. Came out lovely, I just turned it out from the bowl after rising into a pie pan and got a really lovely round loaf.

I've made this several times and didn't change a thing.  We dip the bread in olive oil, fresh ground pepper and parmesan cheese.  Delicious!

WOW!!!  Everyone in my family loved this bread, in fact, it was pretty much gone in about 3 hours.  I have tried several breads from allrecipes but this is hands down the best.  I used about 3 Tbsp fresh rosemary which I think is key!  I bought a rosemary plant especially for this since so many people said it became a standby bread for them.  Towards the end of baking, I also brushed the top with olive oil then sprinkled garlic and pepper on top and let cook an additonal 5-7 minutes.  I forgot to try it with milk, but I'm not sure how it can get any better.  I also made this from scratch using my Kitchenaid.  LOVED IT.  Thank you!

This is a lovely bread - made it on my first attempt at bread making with my new breadmaker and it turned out fantastic...  Although, as I don't eat a lot of salt in my diet, I think that I will half the amount of salt in the recipe in future...  Goes great with any stew, casserole or thick winter soup!!! :)  I will be making this bread again!

Oh. My. God.  This is *fabulous*!  My new favorite bread, and I make lots of really great bread.  This works really, really well in the bread machine, and is terrific made in the oven too.  I did end up adding about 1/4 cup more bread flour.  I brush the crust with olive oil (after baking) and sprinkle it with some coarse salt, and then we break it apart with our hands to eat.  Of course we serve it with some herbed or peppered olive oil for dipping.

Very delicious!  I made the dough in the bread machine and then baked it in a bundt pan at 350 for 30 minutes.  Brushed some egg white on top and it was really, really good!  It does make a rather small loaf though.  The 1lb setting is probably fine.

I made this bread and it was gone by the end of the day.  The recipe doesn't mention what amount setting to cook it on.  My bread machine allows for 1, 1.5 and 2lb. loaves.  I chose the 1 lb. option and it was perfect.  Dipped in some oil and seasoning (pepper and romano).  My sister-in-law raved about it as well.  I'm making another one this week.  Thanks for sharing!!!

It was great straight from the oven, but not so good after it cooled. The crust and texture of the inner bread went sort of buttery crumbly, but not in a good buttery crumbly sort of way. We like flavorful food, but this was overpowering at dinner.

I had to pause in the middle of making this but the breadstick version still turned out delicious! I followed the salt reduction recipe, but being a salt lover I will add more next time. I definately suggest dipping it in some olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Thanks!

Excellent!  I used fresh rosemary and after reading the reviews I decreased the salt to 1 tsp. but next time I'll add the amount of salt the recipe called for.  I kneaded the dough with my Kitchen-Aid mixer and made 12 dinner size rolls that I brushed with egg wash and baked in a round cake pan at 350 for 30 minutes.  Perfect!  Next time I'll definitely double the recipe!  I can't stop eating them... all I need now is a nice bowl of pasta -yum!!

This was great.  A real success for my first bread baking attempt.  I don't have a bread machine, so I used the instructions provided by one of the reviewers (thanks!) and baked the bread at 350 for 35-40 minutes.  The results were impressive.  The rosemary flavor is bold without being too much.

This was the first bread machine recipe that I've tried off of this site and it was amazing. The only thing that I changed was instead of 1 cup of water, I adde 1/2cup water,1/2cup of milk per another review. Smelled delicious while cooking Thanks!

Wonderful. I made with my Kitchen Aide Mixer, formed into a ball and cooked at 375 for 25 - 30 and it was perfect! I also brushed the top with egg white.

I've made this recipe 5 times in the last two months. Love it. You can tweak it and tweak it and it still comes out great.

1/2 multigrain flour
5 tablespoons olive oil instead of 3
2 sprigs fresh rosemary instead of dry

I made the dough in the breadmaker, but baked it in the oven with these toppings:

1 clove fresh garlic, mashed and minced
2 shallots julienned
fresh grapes
fresh rosemary
grated parmesan

I think it's best to eat this bread right out of the oven. I ate some leftovers the next day, and the rosemary was way too strong. Will definitely make again and again, but I may cut back on the herb next time.

Absolutely Fantastic!! Super Easy using the bread machine. The smell as it cooks is divine, perfect crunchy crust, and light and airy inside. Tweaked the recipe just a little based on my experience with my bread machine. Used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup water, reduced salt to 1 tsp, used 1/4 tsp basil and 1/4 tsp oregano for the Italian seasoning, increased yeast to 2 tsp, added 2.5 tsp gluten, and an extra tablespoon flour. Even my two year old son couldn't resist the smell and ate two slices with butter.

This isn't as good as Macaroni Grill's bread... it's BETTER!!  What a lovely, spongy, chewy texture.  I followed the recipe exactly as indicated, with my bread maker on the light setting.  The thing I don't like about Macaroni Grill bread is how salty it is.  This allows me to make the same bread at home and control the salt.  Went great dipped in olive oil with our Chicken Parmigiana dinner.

Wow I must have done something wrong here, I found this bread to be WAY WAY too salty!! Nobody would eat it, even slathered with butter it was too much salt. I might make this again, but cut the salt back to 1/2 teaspoon.

We all loved this bread! I used milk instead of water, for a smoother texture. Also, I didn't have any Italian seasoning- so I looked up substitutions online and found that you should use oregano, marjoram, basil, and sage. So I just put a dash of each in. I have a pretty small bread maker - and was glad to find that this recipe worked in it, didn't expand too much - so this recipe is perfect for any size machine. :)

This is the absolute best bread ever.  I did add a few things to my taste.  I firstly made it by hand using the reviewers recommendations on the recipe page.  The only thing that I changed was adding the whole cup of milk because without it, it was not the right consistency.  I also brushed the bread with olive oil and sprinkled with parm cheese.  Instead of making it into a loaf I braided it.  It was so tasty accompanied with the spinach and bean soup on this site.  I will be making this again very soon.  Thanks.

Outstanding!!!  I didn't use the bread machine.  My one and only yeast packet was expired but proofed ok so I used the whole thing.  Was out of Italian seasoning so just tossed in basil, oregano, and majoram, appx 1/4 t. each.  We like our food BAMM with flavor!! The dough was a bit sticky so I ended up with probably closer to 3 cups of flour.  I brushed with evoo before the rise and after  the bake and made dinner rolls instead of a loaf.  Served with cracked pepper and evoo and a little  homemade minestrone on the side, lol.  Can't wait to try it with fresh rosemary.  Yummo.

How could anything be so easy and taste so good! Made one and a half recipes in breadmaker on dough cycle and then shaped into a lg. round circle and baked in oven. Dipped in EVOO with garlic and parmesan seasonings. Family went crazy for it. DELISH!

I made this bread for my mom's birthday and both of us loved it. It does taste like Macaroni Grille's bread, only a lot less greasy. I think I prefer this recipe to Macaroni Grille's bread. I used 2 1/4 cups whole wheat flour and added 4 tbsp wheat gluten. For the herbs, I added a tbsp of basil and oregano instead of the Italian blend.

I made this bread today and three of us sat down and ate the whole loaf with dinner. Very nice texture, and light rosemary flavor make this a great compliment with a variety of foods. I set the machine for dark crust and this gave the bread a real pleasing crunch. Excellent!!!!!

I'm very new to bread machine.  This is the first bread I made and I made it twice.
1st time: follow exactly and find the bread a bit dry, but the flavor is very good.
2nd time: I keep my eye on the kneading process.  Again I follow exactly the ingredients and processes it calls for, EXCEPT I keep up 1 tbsp oil.  I slowly add that 1 tbsp oil and extra 2 tbsp water during the kneading process.  This result in a softer and moister bread.  
Next time I will interchange the rosemary to Basil or Sage. Thanks for the recipe.
3rd time:I add an extra 1tsp olive oil, some poppy seed and ground pepper. It comes out great again!

I always read reviews before choosing a recipe, so when I started to make this bread, my hopes were high. I used to work at Macaroni Grill and I'd make meals of their rosemary peasant bread. I have to admit I was somewhat skeptical that it could taste as good as Macaroni Grill's but IT IS!!!!! YUMMY! My husband said the rosemary taste was a little too much for him but it was perfect for me. To accomodate everyone, I'll likely drop it down to 2tsp. of Rosemary next time. My son (4 years old) said "This is so good I can hardly stand it." Enough Said!

This bread is wonderful.  I used 2 Tbsp of chopped fresh rosemary instead of the dried and cut the salt to 1 tsp.  I made one loaf with the Italian seasoning and one without.  It is very good both ways.  I don't have a bread machine so I baked it at 375 degrees for 45 minutes, until lightly browned and hollow sounding when you tap on it.

I made this bread yesterday and the end result was a very heavy, salty bread.  I didn't use the bread machine, I made it by hand, and the end result was incredibly salty.  I am a salt lover for sure...but this recipe contains way too much IMHO.  If I were to make it again, I'd cut the salt by half and I think that would improve it a lot!

I cannot believe how WONDERFUL this bread turned out!
I followed the directions to a tee.
I borrowed a bread maker from my friend and this was the recipe I decided to make as Christmas presents.
The house smells wonderful!
I made herb infused olive oil to go with and everything was just fantastic!!!
Will make this again and again!

This was so wonderful. My family ate it all!  I made the dough in my bread maker and divided it in two to make loaves like Macaroni's. I also added the parmsean cheese like others had recommeded. 
Then baked it in the oven.It cut the prep time down to about 2hoursplus baking time. I had to make a second recipe the same day because it was gone so quick.

Wow--great bread!! I was worried it would be too salty, like others said, but i didn't change anything, and its awesome! Very Herb-y, and very moist, better to just pull off pieces and butter and eat!  It didn't rise as well as other breads i make in my machine, but still fantastic! Try it--you'll love it!

My family loves this bread! I used fresh rosemary and fresh oregano instead of the Italian seasoning.  We dip it in olive oil, herbs, and balsamic vinegar when it is baked.  I also used it for a sandwich the next day.

My little grandson, who has quite a few food allergies, considers this bread a special treat.  We keep a tub of his "special" butter in the fridge so that he can enjoy warm, buttered slices of this when he's visiting.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is seriously the best bread that has come out of my bread machine.  It melts in your mouth, and although it smelled too strong, the taste is just perfect.  I almost added extra flour as it looked too doughy while kneading, but I'm glad I did'nt.  It was perfect!  Thanks, Jo.

Mmmm Mmmmm Good :) This was wonderful-the bread was very tasty and my dh has requested this bread be made for his lunches. It smelled so wonderful while it was baking ( I made it right in the bread machine, but will make it on dough cycle next time-only because I think this would make an excellent french bread-type loaf :) I also added just a couple shakes of garlic powder and onion powder. The crust was flaky which I loved and the texture of the bread was great. I will be making this often :)

Great bread recipe. I doubled the herbs and added 1 Tbsp.crushed chili's for some extra kick, very flavorful. I make mine in the oven, brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with coarse salt and more herbs. Makes for a nice presentation.

Yum!  This didn't rise too much, but it had a wonderful herby flavour.  I used dry Rosemary, whole pieces.  I can understand the medicinal comment, but I personally liked it a lot.  It almost tasted like there was cheese in the bread to me!  (It really is best warm.)

This is a wonderful recipe!  I used the original recipe first, then I tried it with grapeseed oil instead of olive oil and it was even better!  Thanks!

Would never think to put rosemary in bread, but my god it is so good! I made a rosemary baguette instead of a loaf, me and my partner had it with homemade tomato and zucchini soup.. What a treat. He nearly ate the whole lot couldn't get enough of it! Thanks for sharing :)

Amazing. Don't tweak it. Just make it as is. You will not be disappointed. If you must tweak, then use fresh herbs instead of dried.

I did the recipe as written and everyone enjoyed it. I love rosemary but thought it was a little too much. Next time I will use fresh rosemary at the same amount to see if it gives a better balance.

Today I tried to make bread with yeast for the first time...I'm so glad this was the recipe I started with! It was absolutely heavenly, as my 5 year old described it! ;-) We loved it and will be making it many times over! We dipped it in olive oil and ate more than half of it in one sitting!

I've been making this recipe for years and it is amazing!  Like others mentioned, it is just like Macaroni Grill's bread.  I've been giving loaves to neighbors for Christmas for years and they love it.  Follow the recipe just as suggested, no tweaking needed.

Once you make this bread, it will be a part of your household for life. Hard to find a better, easier, yummy bread recipe. I make sure to use three times the Rosemary (fresh from the garden if possible).  Fantastic!

We love this recipe. I use my bread machine to do all the mixing, kneading and rising. At the end of the cycle  I remove the dough and bake it in a 375 degree oven. I can't even recall how many times i have made this. A definite keeper :)

wow!!   every bread recipe has reviewers saying that their recipe is the best. Well, I'm here to tell you, that THIS recipe is the BEST. THIS IS IT!. Yum! I used 2T of fresh rosemary (the kind sold in the grocery store in the little plastic packages in the produce aisle for $1.50- 1 package was enough) and I purchased a small thing of pepper that came in a grinder - I am not sure if quality matters for this- so I just bought the lowest price one which was the supermarket brand for $2.00)-  I used a heaping 1/4 tsp. I used the dough cycle on the bread machine, took it out, punched it down, shaped into a round loaf and let it rise again for an hour. I slit a cross into the top, brushed olive oil on and liberally sprinkled course ground sea salt over it.  Then I baked it at 375 for 30 minutes. I let it cool before I cut it and oh boy was it good. I didn't find the rosemary flavor to be overwhelming. Looking forward to making this again!

Delicious and easy, savory bread machine recipe. I added water & oil first, then salts, followed by sifted dry. Dig a well for the yeast. Try not to add the yeast to the salted area. My Italian spice is a pesto type mix. I used 1/2 teaspoon instead of 1/4. This was wonderful with an olive oil dipping sauce (add fresh cracked pepper & a sprinkle of sea salt)

Smelled fantastic, didn't get the chance to cool in this house!

I like herb breads, and this one was no exception. However, I will in future drastically cut back on the rosemary, as there was just way too much of it for my hubby and 7-year-old. Perhaps I'll try adding garlic in its place.

So there is no photo because we ate it all!! Perfect first time out.It was sooooooo good. I did use half water and half milk versus all water. I also used my fresh rosemary, a heavy tablespoon. I used little bowls of olive oil, balsamic vinegar and cracked pepper to dip the bread into. If you like Macaroni Grill's bread you will love it for sure. All I know is everyone in the house thinks I am brilliant and I feel like a blob from eating too much!! I will be good tomorrow! I will be putting this into my regular rotation of favorites.

Have made this three or four times now.  Per some reviews -changed oil to 3 Tbsp. melted butter and used 1/2 water 1/2 milk on liquid.  Also proofed the yeast in the liquid first (always do that b/c if things don't work otherwise, you won't know if it its the yeast).
The bread is FABULOUS.
Oh, I also use the Basic setting on my Bread machine for this w/ Light crust.

Deeeeeee-licious, Joe!  Thanks SO much.  So many bread machine recipes are bad, but I made your wonderful rosemary bread with no changes at all (don't you just LOVE people who change ingredients and techniques, then have the nerve to rate it badly?) and it's definitely a "keeper".

The first time I made this bread, my family loved it so much that it has now become my specialty.  Everyone who has tasted it has thought that it was delicious.  My neighbor even said that it was "a party in my mouth".

I made this in the bread machine on the dough setting, shaped into 16 rolls, and baked at 375 for about 15 minutes.  They were light, fluffy, and delicious, not bland at all, but not overpowering either.

This was delicious, and it smells so good while it's baking. Used my bread maker and followed the recipe exactly, except I made my own italian seasoning with equal parts basil, thyme, marjoram, oregano and rosemary. My boyfriend is still talking about it. Definitely a keeper.

This is the best bread ever.  If you like rosemary--add lots more to the mixture.

This bread is amazing! I have a cuisinart bread maker and the white bread cycle left it a bit undercooked. I used the french/italian bread cycle the next time and it was perfect.

It is wonderful bread.  Can't keep it in the house as the kids eat it up as soon as it is made.  I now make it as rolls by using the dough cycle on the bread machine and stretching the bread out on a cutting board to piece off individual roll sizes.  I let the rolls rise again for an hour on a greased cookie sheet and then bake.

I got rid of my bread maker but followed muffin moms instructions on making by hand to a "T" and it came out PERFECT!  I had some with my sausage, peppers and onions I did in the pressure cooker in marinara and it was to die for!  I will be making this over and over again.  Thank you Jo!

I have made this bread several times now and it is great no matter how i vary the recipe.  I too have had my bread machine make the dough and have used others recommendations on cooking times, etc.  but what i discovered is something truly awesome if you love garlic.  I roasted some garlic in a frying pan in either whole cloves or portions, depending on the size of the clove.  Then I mixed it in with the dough evenly and cooked it in a preheated dutch oven (preheat the oven with the dutch oven in it-- a trick I learned form America"s test kitchen-- makes the crust awesome) at 400 degrees for 40 minutes.  It is awesome, with or without the garlic cloves.  I particularly like dipping it in olive oil/ balsamic vinegar.  Every last dinner guest has loved it.

This bread smelled so delicious while baking in the bread machine, and it tasted even better! I used plenty of freshly ground black pepper, and I also replaced the dried rosemary with 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped rosemary. Probably the best bread I've ever made in my bread machine. Our family of four devoured it in less than 24 hours. It was great served alongside our dinner, and made for amazing grilled cheese sandwiches the next day!

This bread is delicious! I didn't have any dried rosemary (ridiculous, I know) so I just used a tablespoon (slightly rounded) of Italian seasoning. I made the dough with the dough setting on my bread machine and then kneaded it briefly, adding some flour, and put it in a loaf pan for a second rising. I followed a suggestion here to brush the loaf with olive oil and sprinkle on some coarse salt. I baked it for 30 minutes at 375, spritzing the loaf with water at 10 minutes and again at 20 minutes. The bread is beautifully shaped and exceptional tasting. Hearty and satisfying. Sometimes you just have to embrace the carbs of white flour and enjoy home baked perfection!

I'm not normally a big white bread person but this was fantastic! I could have eaten the whole loaf in one sitting. I didn't have dried rosemary so I used fresh from my herb garden and put in 2 tablespoons chopped fine. I also increased the Italian seasoning by another 1/8 tsp. Just fabulous! Thank you!

This is a great bread recipe! My whole family loves it (even my two year old). I often leave out the pepper for a milder taste. And if I've run out of Rosemary, I put in a tbsp of Italian Seasoning instead.

WOW was that good!  And so easy!  I was for sure I would mess this up, because I have failed several times with dough (pizza and bread).  I followed TANG_29's suggestions because I don't own a breadmaker.  It was perfect.  Added 2 tbsp of grated parmesan-reggiano cheese and used fresh rosemary.  The color and flavor are delightful.  Will be making this again AND trying other variations with fruit/nut/spice etc. :)

I let my bread machine mix it and rise it.  Then I shape it and bake.  You can add more garlic or herbs to your taste.  Was good the next day too.
I haven't perfected getting the crust to the right crispiness though.

EXCELLENT BREAD!! I used the bread machine to do most of the kneading work, but baked the bread in the regular oven because I wanted a rustic shape. When I removed the dough from the bread machine, it collapsed, kind of like what happens when you punch down the dough. I worked in some extra flour and put it in a bowl sprayed with Pam, covered it and let it rise for about 30 minutes.  I put it on my bread stone and brushed it lightly with olive oil and fresh ground pepper. I baked the bread at 375 for 15 minutes, then raised the temp to 425, as per another review.  I had planned to only bake about another 10 minutes, but it took about 15 minutes. I followed the advice about ice cubes in the bottom of the oven, as well as spraying the loaf and the sides of the oven to create lots of steam.  The bread baked up with a delicious crust.  I mixed up the herbs for the Carraba's dipping oil and served with EVOO at the table.  Hubby ate with butter.  Whole family LOVED the bread and wanted to know when I would make the next loaf. The only change I made to the recipe was that I only used 1 tsp of salt, as suggested by some other reviews.  I was very tempted to add garlic powder (1/2 tsp) and parmesan cheese (1 TB) as a few other reviewers did, but I really wanted to taste the recipe as written.  I will definitely be making this bread again, so I will have plenty more chances to experiment.

Did not work in our bread maker. Turned out very small and dense.

We didn't care for this bread- too much rosemary flavor for us, I guess.

Even though this was not a favorite to me, my kids ate the whole loaf and raved on it. I did cut the rosemary by about a quarter and I still thought it was too strong. But since my kids loved it as is will make it again the exact way.

Really good and REALLY EASY to make! I baked mine in the oven at 375 for 20 minutes, pulled it out and brushed an egg wash over the top, increased the temp to 425 and baked again for another 10-15 minutes. This is my first time ever making bread and it came out looking professional!!!! I will definitely be making this again however I think I'm going to change it to a basil parmesan loaf instead. My only complaint is it is just a TAD too salty for me so I will be scaling that back the next time I make it!

This recipe was amazing.  The only change I made was I used half the salt.  I'll be making this bread often.  The loaf only lasted 15 minutes before it was all gone.  Everyone loved it.

Excellent tender bread.  I used the dough cycle of my bread machine and then baked for 30 min. at 375. I used a good quality olive oil and Zaatar seasoning for dipping.

This was SO yummy! I am new at using the bread machine and have been testing different recipes. This was a winner! It baked up beautifully and was light, not so dense like other breads I've tried. Was wonderful warmed up with a bit of butter :)

Flavor was excellent.  Used fresh rosemary from my garden.  Made it by hand, no bread machine.  My only problem is it didn't rise well. . .I guess my yeast wasn't fresh (even though I just bought it last week).  I will make it again with different yeast!  Served it with olive oil and fresh cracked pepper.

I can't believe I haven't rated this yet since I have made it so many times.  It is the most requested bread recipe by my kids... my 9 year old could smell it right when he walked in from school... he knew right away I made rosemary bread and jumped for joy!  I always sub 1/2 cup of bread flour for whole wheat just to make it a tiny bit more nutritious.

This was good but it calls for too much rosemary and olive oil.  Next time I make this, I'll probably cut both in half.

Very good; very easy. I don't have a bread maker & do not have tons of experience baking yeast breads. However, my 6-yr-old son & I made this with no problems and it turned out fabulous! I did use Muffinmom's  baking suggestions.

2016.09.25  If you know your yeast is good, you don't have to proof it.
Combine water (HOT, see yeast packet/jar), olive oil, sugar, Italian seasoning, pepper, rosemary, and yeast.  Let sit a minute, then add first cup of flour and the salt, plus 2.5 tsp of vital wheat gluten if you are using AP flour instead of bread flour.  Stir it up, then add the rest of the flour.  Turn onto a clean, well-floured counter.  Knead for 10 minutes, adding more flour as needed.  Oil a bowl, turn the dough in it to oil the dough's entire surface, and cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel.  Place bowl in an oven that has been preheated to 180F and then turned off (or other warm, draft-free place).  Let rise one hour.  Punch down the dough, then fold it once or twice and form a ball.  Place the ball on the tray you will use to bake it.  Cover with the towel, place back in warm place for another hour.  Put a pan with 1 inch of water into the oven.  Preheat the oven to 375.  Uncover the dough and put it in the oven.  Bake for approx. 30 minutes.
2016.10.21  If you want to make rolls instead of a loaf, after the first rise divide the dough into 12 pieces and tuck edges under each to form balls, placing them in a jellyroll pan covered with a damp towel to rise in a warm place.  Rising seems quicker with rolls than a loaf, so they will probably be good in 40 minutes.  Same as above, place a pan of water in the oven.  Preheat to 375F.  Bake uncovered approximately 14 minutes.  Yum!

Taste's like Macaroni Grill's signature bread.  Very good-especially fresh out of the oven and smothered in butter.

Excellent!  I used a little less salt (1 tsp) and used fresh rosemary.  I substituted a little garlic, oregano, basil and thyme for the Italian seasoning and added 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese.  Fabulous.   My spouse said it was the best bread I have ever made.

Light and fluffy.  Skipped the Italian seasoning.  It still tastes and smells wonderful.  Easy to make.  Definitely will make again.

I just started the bread machine on our third loaf this week! We love this recipe. It could not be simpler. We use fresh rosemary from our garden instead of dried - the taste is fabulous. Thanks Jo!

I made this in my machine, following the directions exactly.  My settings: 1.5 pound loaf, light crust, basic setting.  The bread stayed light and fluffy even the next day.  I adore the texture, but it was not as flavorful as I would've liked.  Maybe adding some melted butter would've enhanced the taste.  Delicious especially if paired with something else like soup.

Very yummy! I thought the bread would be heavier but it came out nice and light. I had to substitute one of the cups of flour because I didn't have enough. I used half a cup of wheat and half a cup of rye. I also added vital wheat gluten. I think I need to tweak the mixture of spices just a little bit to make it even better for us.

Have made this recipe many times in the machine and it always turns out great. Usually add more Italian seasoning cause I like lots of flavor, sometimes add butter flavoring also. I cook lots of different types of bread and this is a good recipe that can be added to.

YUM - this bread was delicious! I followed the first reviewer's instructions and baked it in a regular loaf pan. If you do it this way, I think you can just add the herbs at the same time as the other dry ingredients. It was so super easy, yet people were impressed that I made bread from scratch. :) haha

Very easy to make and the flavor is amazing. I even messed it up by forgetting to let it rise a 2nd time and it still turned out great! My family loved it and requested more. This time I won't forget to let it rise a 2nd time and I'm sure it will turn out perfect. Only thing I did different was make it by hand...not with a bread machine. Oh and I did add 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese to the recipe. Before baking I brushed it with garlic infused olive oil and sprinkled it with a little bit of cracked black pepper. This recipe is the bomb!!! =)

I've made this many times following the recipe exactly and it always gets rave reviews.  My favorite way of making it now though is to replace one cup of the bread flour with wheat flour, and cutting down on the rosemary a little bit.  Replacing all or part of the water with milk is good too.  I have an oster bread machine, and the express bake does not work as well with this recipe as the full bread cycle.

Bread is my favorite food and this was the best bread I've EVER tasted, much less made!!! My husband was also stuffing himself with it too. I was out of Italian seasoning so just used oregano and thyme. I also had to add about an 1/8 or 1/4 cup of extra flour as the dough was very sticky. This was so easy and beyond delicious. If I could give it 5 more stars, I would.

Baked perfectly in my bread machine without any changes to the recipe. The texture was extremely light and airy and the crust was very nice and crispy. I didn't find the Rosemary overpowering, as some reviewers did, but I will probably use a different spice the next time just out of personal taste. Overall, a very good 5-star bread.

As Muffinmom did, I made this by hand instead of by bread machine. (Well, I didn't use a mixer.  Mixed everything by hand)  Turned out perfect.  The only thing from the recipe I didn't do was to use a machine.  Other than that, I made exactly to the recipe.  Had 2 loaves made by lunch, and both were gone by the end of dinner.  Great recipe.

My husband told me to make sure I ALWAYS have everything on hand to make this bread because he will be asking for it on a daily basis!  We used to go to Macaroni Grill and just fill up on the yummy bread...now we can just make it at home!

I make this recipe all the time and LOVE it!  I cooked it a day ahead of its planned dinner last week, and my husband practically drooled over it until the next evening.  I made it again tonight to go with the Baked Potato Soup from Kristie Teague also on this site.  It's good with everything, and hubby said it should win a prize.  (Then he asked if I made up the recipe.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  He knows my secret is anything with a good rating from allrecipes!)  Thanks, Jo, for a treat we enjoy often!

This was my first loaf of bread and it was wonderful.  Followed the directions by the reviewer that cooked it at 375F for the first twenty minutes and 425F for the last ten on a silicone loaf pan.  I'm afraid we'll be fighting over it while it lasts!

Okay, so I used half all purpose flour and half wheat flour, and thyme instead of rosemary (forgot I was out of rosemary), and this was AWESOME.  We dunked it in soup and had sandwiches for a couple days and I'm about to start another loaf!

It smells wonderful, lovely indeed. But it's a small loaf if follows the recipe. Has anyone been in the same satiation before? The dough rose slow as well, strangely. Thanks.

Great for it's lightness and fluffiness, but I guess I'm not a fan of rosemary. It's not BAD, I just probably won't eat any more of it...

This is the best!  It does taste just like Macaroni Grill like the other reviewers said.    I don't have a bread machine so I used the comments from previous reviewers to make by hand.  I put mine in the pan but dusted the pan with corn meal before putting in the dough and I brushed with olive oil and dusted with salt before baking.  Dipped in olive oil with cracked pepper.    This deserves more than 5 stars!!!

This is fabulous!  Made this in my Zojirushi and the smell was out of this world!  .  One change, I used dried crushed rosemary instead of regular rosemary.  I also used the light crust setting on my breadmaker.  Will definitely do this one again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious, fluffy, perfect bread. I didn't have a pre-mixed Italian seasoning, so I threw in about a 1/4 tsp each of oregano, basil, thyme, and sage.

I made this exactly as the recipe reads.  My husband told me to make this bread again...all the time.  We were both very happy with the taste!  I did not use a bread machine.  I cooked it at 350 for about 30 minutes.  It is moist and delicious!!

This bread, made exactly as stated, is really tasty.  I've also been making it using a sponge of all the water, half the flour and half the yeast one hour prior to throwing everything in the bread machine; this yields a consistency that is great for sandwich bread.

Why didn't I make this bread before?!??! It was amazing, one of the best breads I have ever tasted. I used about 2.5 TBS of fresh rosemary, and chopped it fine. I will be making this often!

I have made this recipe many times.  I make it using 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup bread flour making it a tad healthier.    I also reduce salt to 1 tsp since we need a low salt diet.  It is still delicious.  Thank you Jo.

I subbed fresh rosemary for the dried, I think I used too much I only used about 4 teaspoons but it was too much. aside from that it came out great in my bread machine. Update: in my new bread machine It only makes a 1 1/2 pound bread not a 2 pound loaf. Update:If you make 18 servings it uses 1 packet of yeast. Uses 1 tsp chopped fresh rosemary, and it could have used some more.

This bread is incredible and moist! I baked it in the oven instead of a breadmaker, and while I struggle with baking in general because I am at high altitude, it still tasted great (didn't look so pretty!). The key is using high quality rosemary. We didn't grow rosemary in our garden this year, so I went to a local spice shop near our house that grinds really fresh spices, and that was perfect! I can't wait to try this bread again. I might try it in my breadmaker next time.

I used the "light" setting on my bread machine because I like soft bread, and I used Red Mill all-purpose flour instead of bread flour. In lieu of Italian seasonings (which are missing from my spice collection) I used a few shakes of Oregano and Basil. Turned out deliciously! Great recipe--Thanks!!

Wonderful, flavorful, perfectly textured bread.  I am making our second batch just a day after our first!  We also let the yeast activate in warm water as the other reviewers suggested.  We will be making this bread over and over again.  Thank you for such a delightful recipe!

To make this by hand, I first let the yeast activate in warm water (I used less than a cup, closer to 2/3 c.) I would recommend putting in the spices as you're mixing, before you knead, because the dough is fairly dense and it's hard to get an even distribution if you try to knead them in. After letting it rise twice, I baked it at 375 for about 35 min. I used fresh rosemary, and upped the amount of all the spices, because I like my breads to be very flavorful. It made a wonderful bread, not too crusty or moist.

A for AwesOme!  Didn't have any rosemary so I just added 1 teaspn of italian seasoning.  used milk instead of water.  Also, I added about 3/4 cup of shredded pepper jack to the dough as the bread machine was almost done mixing it.  I love butter so I added a tblspn to the mix and brushed 1 tblspn of melted butter to the top of the dough just before baking. My bread machine asks for all the wet ingredients first, then the dry.  Set it for basic and it was delicious!  It smelled so good I couldn't wait for it to cool.. i basically burned my tongue. =P   For breakfast I took a nice thick slice, sprinkled some shredded cheese, and popped it into the toaster just enough for the cheese to gOoify and the bread to soften.. *drool*  it just melts in your mouth...

WOWZER!!!!   This is fantastic bread! Used my bread machine and it couldn't be easier! I use half water half skim milk.  I also used a little less dried rosemary.  I just didnt fill up the tbs up fill (so maybe 3/4 tbsp). But still very stong flavor. FANTASTIC!  Will definatly make again.

This recipe is great! I made it for Father's Day and I used fresh rosemary from our garden which was perfect! Since I didn't have Italian Seasoning, I used fresh oregano and basil!! Thank you for posting this recipe.

I made this with 2t rosemary and that was plenty.  Mine were quite gluey - I did mine by hand and I'll increase the flour about a cup next time.

Delicious bread! I used the tip that suggested using milk instead of the water, also used slightly less than a tablespoon of rosemary. It turned out very moist. Great served with dipping oil/seasoning just like in a restaurant.

This was the best rosemary bread I have ever had.  It was very moist, and the crust was perfect!  The only change I made was to use all-purpose flour instead of bread flour (didn't have any bread flour).

My husband and I love this bread. I probably make it about once a week. to make it a little healthier I now replace one cup of white flour with wheat flour and you can't tell the difference.

I found the rosemary a bit powerful the first time, so I made some alterations (thus the four stars).  Instead of Italian seasoning and 1T dried rosemary, I used 1 teaspoon each of fresh rosemary and fresh thyme and 1 tablespoon of freshly chopped chives.  This pairs really nicely with cheddar cheese and/or chicken as a sandwich filling.

The best bread yet. I used fresh rosemary from my garden. Will definitely make again. Similar to an Italian herb bread I've made with parmesan cheese - try adding 1.4 cup of the parm cheese next time and you will love it even more!

Awesome!  I used fresh rosemary, and increased the amount to 2 TBsp.  I used the 'dough' cycle in my bread machine, and transferred it to a heavy commercial non-stick bread pan, gave it its final rise and baked it in my oven at 350F for 45 minutes.  It came out beautifully.

This was my first attempt at making bread.  It was pretty good, but I wonder if it would have tasted more like authentic "bakery" bread if I had used bread flour instead of all purpose flour.

This bread is great.  I love the chewy texture with the crispy edges.  It is great for sandwiches.  It gives any plain lunchmeat sandwich a gourmet taste.

OH MY GOSH!  This was so so so good!  My husband has begged me to make this everyday since I made it.  I followed the recipe just as it was written, however, I did bake it in a 375 degree oven for 30 mins instead of in the breadmaker. I've even had a neighbor as she'll pay me to make this for her.  Seriously won't be wasting your time trying this recipe it really is that good!

Phenomenal bread! I love to serve it with Chicken Vegetable Noodle soup and dunk it in the broth! The combination of chicken with the rosemary in the bread is fabulous! This has become a recipe favorite in our house! Perfect texture and flavor. I think it is best eaten while still warm. Leftovers are good but nothing compared to right from the oven or bread machine!
12/8/18 - I did not have Rosemary this time so had to improvise. Since Italian seasoning has rosemary in it I just added 1 T Italian seasoning in place of the rosemary. I also added about 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese. This turned out wonderful as well!

This is just like Macaroni Grill. It is great and smells great. BUT- I didn't do it right because I don't have a bread machine. It was very flat? chewy? Anyone have exact way to make this without bread machine?

Best bread DH has ever had! It was delicious. Except for fresh rosemary, oregano & thyme instead of Italian seasoning, I followed the recipe. My bread machine crashed so I bought a Kitchenaid HD and this was its first outing so I combined reviewer Tang 29's "by hand" tips as well as Allrecipes Proofing Yeast since I wasn't sure if mine was good - it was! And Recipezaar's #294941 "Earl's Homemade Bread for the Kitchenaid". While there was alot of juggling pages, the combo produced a full flavored aromatic round loaf that I will make often (as soon as I write everything down). Thank you Jo! Allrecipes, Earl, and reviewer Tang_29!

Outstanding recipe!  I actually have one in the bread machine now.  It's so simple to make and so wonderful to eat.  I follow the recipe to the letter, except for reducing the yeast by just a couple of grans, and increasing the herbs just a touch.  We like stronger flavors in our family!

It was ok, but I guess you really have to like your bread to taste like herbs to really like this. Guess our family likes more plain types of bread. I had to freeze what was left over and even for the next dinner, it didnt get eaten up. Ended up drying what was left and using it for breadcrumbs.

Made this last weekend and it wasn't pleasing to my husband. He said it tasted like windex. I would use less than the recommanded amount on the rosemary.

This is the second time I have made this bread. The first time, it was a bit dense. But today it was perfect!!!! I had to adjust the spices a bit because I didn't have a full tablespoon of rosemary. So I added more oregano, basil and thyme. Delicious!

Excellent recipe, I add 1 3/4 teaspoons of salt and the bread doesn't fall. Making my 2nd loaf today, love the texture.

Great bread!  Used 2 tsp fresh rosemary, but med-fine chopped it first to avoid the feeling of "having little sticks in your mouth" as one reviewer put it.  Also made on the dough cycle in the breadmaker, but shaped the loaf and baked it at 375 degrees in the oven for 20-25 min.  Treated it a little like french bread in that I brushed it with an egg and 1T water mix and threw some crushed ice in the oven just after putting the loaf in to bake.  Loved the flavor, the texture and crust.  Highly recommend!

This bread is worth the 5 star ratings everyone is giving it. I don't have a bread machine, but I do have a stand mixer. I put half of the flour and the rest of the ingredients in the mixer and combined with the paddle attachment (I have a grinder with mixed Italian seasonings/salt. I used 2 tsp of that instead of the seasonings & salt. I also used 1 tsp dried rosemary that I crushed. I also used just a bit more yeast- 1 Tbls) I mixed that until smooth and well combined. I changed attachments to the kneading arm, added the rest of the flour and let it go for 4 min or so. While the bread is kneading, I turn on the oven to preheat, but only leave it on for about one minute, then turn it off. It allows the oven to warm very slightly, just enough to help the bread rise. I punched down the dough and pushed it out to a square and rolled it up as one reviewer suggested, tucking the ends under as I put it in the prepared bread pan. As I did that, I did my quick oven pre-heat again. I did spray the risen dough with olive oil and sprinkled course-crushed sea salt on top. I sprayed it two more times during the 30 minute cooking time (at 400*F) The crust wasnt chewy like it would have been if I'd sprayed water instead of oil, but it was a wonderful color and tasted superb! I will be making this recipe monthly for sure. It's a great recipe, even if you dont have a breadmachine

I followed this recipe exactly as written and it came out perfect.  I served it with olive oil dipping sauce on the side.  The next day I toasted it - and it was wonderful.  I'll be using this bread for panini sandwiches too.  A KEEPER.

Great bread recipe. Doubled the recipe and used 3 TBS fresh rosemary for the dried one. Worked the dough with a kitchenaid and baked in a regular oven at 350 F for about 30 min. Moist and tasty. Thanks.

Absolutely wonderful! I accidentally only put a tsp. of Rosemary in it but it turned out perfect. If I would have put the full amount in that might have been too much.

We used 1.5 cups (60%) white whole wheat flour, and it came out just perfect.  We could have eaten the whole loaf in one sitting!

This bread is lovely. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer starting with proofing the yeast with the sugar and warm water in the mixer bowl to finishing up with kneading in the bowl. This rose beautifully, browned perfectly and went well with our dinner. Made a basic soup dinner ten times better. I'd make this again.

The bread was a hit at a pasta dinner we attended. The rosemary is very strong, but everyone thought it tasted great! I used the quick bread setting on my machine and it was ready in less than an hour!

After 7 years of being locked away in the basement storage area, I decided to get out my old breadmaker and give this recipe a try..... INCREDIBLE!!!!! My whole family loved it! Made it just as reccommended , added only melted garlic butter on top after baking. The only problem is... it only makes one loaf, we ate the whole thing in one night!!!! Great even without dipping oil! Watch out Macaroni Grill... and my thighs, because I could gain 20 pounds on this thing!

I'm rating this based on flavor, because something didn't go right with my loaf.  The dough didn't rise at all, even though I had fresh yeast.  I'm thinking it was just too cold today to bake bread.  Then I took it out of the oven too soon, so it was a little doughy in the middle.  It tasted great, though!  Next time, however, I'm going to use fresh rosemary instead of dried.

This bread is really tasty. I add fresh rosemary (to give it more flavor) and that is what makes this recipe good. Sometimes this can be hit or miss. I've made it probably 7 or 8 times, and its turned out only about 3 or 4 times. One time it was because the power went out while it was in the bread machine! :O I usually add extra seasoning to give it more flavor. It is good, but its flavor isn't as good as the stuff you can buy at the store, but for something you can make yourself, it's pretty darn good! Thank you!

This is the second bread recipe I made with the Breadman that I bought at Goodwill.  It turned out perfect!  I backed off a little on the rosemary after reading that someone thought there was too much.  Not true.  I think the amounts specified in this recipe are very accurate.  A smashing success. Thank you!

I saw this recipe and just had to try it since I love MG's bread. I did what some of the others did and added 1/2 cup of water (I added the yeast to the warm water for 10 minutes) and 1/2 cup of 2% milk. I didn't have rosemary, so I used oregano and basil instead. 

Instead of using a bread maker, I decided to try to make this completely from scratch. Here's what me and my trusty Kitchen Aid (use the hook) did:

1st Knead - 3 min. 
2nd Knead - 27 min.
1st Rise - 70 min.
Punch Down - 30 sec.
2nd Rise - 70 min.
Baked at 375 for about 20 minutes.

If you love rosemary ...you will LOVE this bread! I used fresh rosemary from my garden(3tbs) and at end of baking i brushed with EVOO and sprinkled fresh ground pepper and garlic ontop....its great as toast...for sandwiches...or just eating sliced w/out butter. Thanks for a great bread recipe!!

This bread was so good! And it made the apartment smell great while it was baking! Here's what I did... 1) I decreased the rosemary to about a teaspoon and increased the Italian seasoning to a heaping teaspoon. 2) I added a minced clove of garlic and about 1/4-1/3 cup of grated parmesan cheese. 3) I made the dough in my bread machine. When I took it out, it was a little sticky so I incorporated a little bit of flour then let it rise for 30-45 minutes, until it was about doubled. 4) I put it on a pizza stone sprinkled with cornmeal and made an egg white wash to paint on the top to help it brown. I baked it at 375 for about 25 minutes. 5) I served it with olive oil and freshly ground black pepper to dip in. Went perfectly with chicken tetrazinni. This is definitely a keeper!

This bread was wonderful!  Hubby and I ate almost the entire loaf last night and I think I'm going to have to make another one tonight!  Great recipe...only thing I did differently was to use whole wheat flour instead of bread flour since that was all I had.  Definitely a keeper!

Although I enjoyed this bread and it is quite like what you would get at Macaroni Grill, my husband thought there was too much rosemary.

It was also very dense.

This is a really great recipe.  Thanks!  I did not have a bread machine, so I followed another reviewer's instructions.  I baked it at 375 for 20 minutes in an 8" pan.  Really delicious and fresh tasting!

So Good!  What else is there to say?  I followed the recipe exactly (something I don't do often) except I made it by had instead of with a bread maker.  Glad I did!  All bread tastes great right out of the oven, but for me the mark of good bread is how it tastes the day after-this was still just as good!  I will probably be making this very often from now on.

This was the first recipe I tried when I got my bread machine 6 months ago.  It is still our favorite, but we eat the entire loaf as soon as it is barely cool enough to eat.  We hate waiting 3 hours for it, so by changing only two things: using instant dry yeast instead of active dry yeast, and express cycle instead of white bread cycle, we have a perfect loaf in 58 minutes!  (...and sometimes we have another perfect loaf 58 minutes after that...)  Thank you for this family favorite!

Wow, this bread is awesome! It smells so good while it is cooking. It also tastes wonderful. For those of you familiar with the bread at Macaroni Grill this is very close. It is a keeper and I make this bread all the time.

Mmmm! This is a fantastic recipe.  A perfect compliment to spaghetti.  I added extra Italian seasoning (it's a spice mixture that we love). I don't know who Jo is but she rocks!

Olive oil makes the dough so smooth to work with. The bread tasted wonderful.  I used fresh rosemary from the garden, at less than the recipe called for, and it was still very fragrant and flavorful.

I did this bread tonight to go with spaghetti.  I didn't have bread flour on hand so I used all purpose.  I also substituted oregano for the Italian seasoning.  It came out wonderful.  I know this will become a family favorite.

Yummy!  My loaf turned out very, very light in texture.  I would have prefered something a bit more dense.  I did cut back on the salt, used 1tsp (maybe that had something to do it).  I also added 2tbsp of dry milk powder.

This bread recipe is one of the best.  I have made it over 10 times now.  It comes out great with either dried or fresh rosemary.  I follow the recipe exactly has directed and add the ingredients in the order that they are listed.  To avoid flat bread make sure that the yeast does not touch the water when you put it in.

Best bread ever !!! I make 2 loaves at a time and freeze as the family loves it. After the first few times, I tried using fresh rosemary, basil, 2 garlic cloves, thyme, chives, from the garden, all finely chopped, added one cup of parmesean cheese, it smelled and tasted wonderful.

WOW!  This bread is amazing.  I made a couple of changes...I substituted whole wheat flour for half of the white flour.  I also added a crushed garlic clove and 1/4 parmesan cheese to the dough.  I made this by hand and baked it in a stone loaf pan for 25 minutes at 350 degrees.  Great flavor and texture.  I will be making this again and again.

I do the dough cycle in the machine, take it out and shape it into a slightly flattened sphere and put it in an 8" round pan (I leave about 1.5" space all around).  I bake it right away at 375 for 20 min.  It's perfect!

This was a great recipe!  My family loved it.  Our local grocery does a potato rosemary bread, and this is nearly the same.  I may try to experiment using potato in the recipe next time.  This is a keeper!

It is just like Macaroni Grill. Awesome. After reading the reviews I did 1/2 milk, 1/2 water for the liquid for the lighter crust color and put my bread machine on the light crust setting. It was extremely light, so Ill probably use the same ration, but set to medium. Thanks so much!

Great stuff!  I made my own "Italian seasoning" using an equal-volume mixture of oregano, minced onion, garlic salt, and basil leaves and use slightly more than called for.  My roommates loved it, and so did my family at one holiday gathering---stole the show!

This recipe was great! I think I forgot the sugar, and since I didn't see rosemary in the pantry, I put more italian seasoning. The bread was wonderfully crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. And because I wanted the bread done quickly, I used quick-rise yeast and a rapid-bake cycle on the machine, and it worked fablously. Edit to add: I used water and the bread was great.

Delicious!!  My BF and I both thought it was just like Macaroni Grill's warm bread.  When I first took it out of the bread machine I thought that it would be dense, but its airy and has a wonderful crust.  I did use the suggestion of replacing the water with milk.  So yummy... served with olive oil and cracked black pepper.  YUMMY!! Thanks Jo!

I am new to my bread machine and bread making in general. I am still learning how to balance ingredients and have had many hard, dense loves over the past few weeks.
I finally tried this recipe after putting it off for a while. Ugh, why did I wait, this came out GREAT! It was just what we were looking for. I used milk instead of water and fresh rosemary from the garden. I sometimes make it without the herbs for a regular sandwich bread.
Thanks for submitting this recipe!

Amazing.  Fantastic.

I made it without the bread machine as Tang_29 instructs and it came out perfect !

I only wish i knew if I could freeze the dough or somehow shorten the prep time so i could make it EVERY night.

This was amazing. It was easy and absolutely delicious. I shaped the dough into clusters and it is great with soup because you just pull the bread apart.  This bread is also very similar to "Garden Herb Loaf" also on allrecipes.  This is more herby and will become a staple at our house.

This was wonderful!  The bread was still a little warm when we ate it, and the smell of the rosemary coming off the bread was lovely, which only helped the taste of course!

I made this recipe today using only the dough cycle on my bread machine, then I took the dough out and shaped it into breadsticks, let it rise for 15 minutes and then baked on 375 for about 18 minutes. I sprinkled salt and brushed olive oil on the tops and then set out olive oil with pepper in it for dipping. It was pretty tasty but not out of this world or anything. I would definitely make it again for an italian dish.

Fantastic and practically foolproof!  I made this with my 15 year old bread maker but I was a little worried as my maker can barely handle 2 cups of flour.  Rather than cut down the recipe, I decided to go for it and it turned out perfect with a beautiful rounded top.  Like previous folks have said, this was light and moist with a great crispy crust and wonderful rosemary flavor--tastes just like the bread at Macaroni Grill. Yum, yum, this is a keeper.

GREAT BREAD. TASTES JUST LIKE THOSE AT A RESTAURANT, BUT A LITTLE SALTY FOR MY TASTE. EASILY FIXED WITH AN ADJUSTMENT OF THE SEASONING.

Brought this bread to a Soup Cookoff, and it got rave reviews.  Going to try making the dough in the breadmaker and baking it on a stone tonight.  Delicious!

Excellent!  I had used the last of my olive oil to make up homemade Italian dressing, so I had to improvise.  I used 4 Tbs. of the dressing and omitted the olive oil, Italian seasonings and pepper.  I also substituted white whole wheat flour for one of the cups of bread flour.  The dough was very wet from the water & vinegar in the dressing, so I added 3-4 Tbsp's of bread flour during the first kneading cycle to obtain the right consistancy.  We tore into it while still hot.  You don't have to dip the bread in anything as all the flavors are baked right in.  I'm anxious to try the original recipe soon.

This was really wonderful-it does taste like Macaroni Grill!  I made my dough in the bread machine but shaped it on a cookie sheet and let it rise before baking in the oven at 340 for 29 mins (my oven runs hot).  Before baking, I brushed an egg wash over the dough and sprinkled a little coarse sea salt on it.  It was AWESOME dipped in olive oil and balsamic.  Thank you so much-a new favorite!!

Great recipe- although the recipe that I followed to do it by hand forgot to mention that you have to add the rest of the water that the recipe calls for - I figured it out as I was kneading the bread as there wasnt' near enough liquid! Otherwise, great!

I made this bread exactly as the recipe said and it came out perfect!  It did taste just like the bread at Macaroni grill.  I'm making another loaf tonight to use as a dipper for cheese fondue.

The first time I made these they were a bit bland so I added 1 tablespoon of dried rosemary and 1/4 teaspoon of ground pepper.  After glazing the rolls with the egg white I sprinkled garlic salt on the rolls.  These rolls were a HUGE hit at a Christmas party.  I used the leftover dough for pizza crust and it was awesome!  This recipe will be used for years to come in our home.

This bread is delicious!  I made it for my first loaf, and it could not have come out any better.  It's a light enough flavor where you can use it as everyday bread, but tasty enough where it can also be eaten by itself.  Highly recommended!

I've made it several times and it always turns out perfectly.  Like many reviewers, I make the dough in my bread machine and then finish in the oven (Use a baking stone for an even nicer crust).  My only suggestion -- if you want to serve this with a meal, make two batches!  While the smell from the first loaf is causing family, neighbors and random passersby to congregate in your kitchen, the second loaf will be rising.  Otherwise, you'll have none left to serve at dinner time.

I made this by hand, and followed a previous review on how to make it by hand.  However, I think at some point the yeast must have died b/c my bread didn't rise at all.  I ended up with a giant breadstick that tasted and smelled WONDERFUL.  I chopped it up into breadsticks and had it with soup.  The taste is just really delicious.  I'm definitely going to try again and hope my yeast doesn't die, b/c I can only imagine how heavenly this bread is with a fluffy doughy texture instead of a crunchy breadstick texture.  But if you want to make tasty homemade rosemary breadsticks... use this recipe without yeast, I guess!

Finally! My bread machine will not go unappreciated! The Hubs said this was just like Macaroni Grill (I haven't been enough times to recognize it). I substituted 1 t. bread machine yeast and it turned out perfectly. Next time, I think I would add a little more Italian seasoning and perhaps some garlic. There were no doughy patches in the middle of the loaf, it rose beautifully and gave me the confidence to bake again! Well done, Jo!

I hadn't used my breadmaker for quite some time but having some free time on a Sunday afternoon I thought I would give this bread a go. What a wonderful aroma! This bread turned out beautifully. It is all long gone and I have been requested to make another loaf tomorrow. Thanks so much for the recipe.

My husband and I love the bread at Macaroni Grill so the first time I made this I was hoping it would be similar--it is!  I have been making this for some time now and it is always a hit.  The only thing I do differently is make it in a circular shape and bake it in the oven.  When I'm having company I make it into 2-3 smaller loaves for more crusty pieces and to be able to put it on a few different tables (like Macaroni Grill).  We always use XV olive oil and freshly ground pepper.  Yum!

My family loved this recipe. The loaf was eaten in a single meal. We dipped the bread in olive oil + fresh cracked pepper. After first loaf, ended up making another 2 per my family's request. Per another review, I tried brushing the crust with olive oil to keep crust soft (for the kids) and it worked great!

Smells heavenly when baking.  Achieved a nice brown color on the bottom, but didn't get very golden on the top.  Pungent flavor of the herbs balanced nicely with the tangy bread taste.

This was a big hit at a picnic with an assortment of cheeses!  Didn't use a breadmaker, just baked from scratch.  Allow more time to raise.

This bread turned out really nice. I did not change any of the recipes and made it all in my bread machine. I made two loaves and will be giving it to my cousin and his fiance for a congrats gift on their engagement! I will recommend them to rehead and cover in buttera salt then dip in olive oil and pepper

This bread is definately a keeper...I used about 2 1/4 Tbls of rosemary from garden and used 1/2 milk and 1/2 water as previously suggested, and cooked in the oven for round shape....Hubby was skeptical, thought it would be too strong, but he loved it so much that he wants me to make more today.

This was super tasty! The only change I made was using 2 tbsp of fresh rosemary...from the garden-not the store. And it does taste so much like macaroni grill's!

An absolutely delicious bread!  I have made it twice in the past two weeks, and both times it's been gone within a day.  It is a bit saltier than most breads, but I like it.  It's quite fantastic drizzled with or dipped in a good-quality olive oil.  Highly recommended.

variations: I use basil and oregano instead of Italian seasoning, and use a little more of all the spices than is called for.  I also use a full 2 tsp of yeast to help with the rising problem.

This is one of my favorites.  It is wonderful!  It is the simplest recipe with the biggest results.  The flavor of the rosemary comes through brilliantly, the crust is crispy and the middle soft.  I make it all the time!

Very delicious.  I followed the directions to a T also and wouldn't change a thing.  I also set it on light crust setting.  I just got the bread machine for Christmas and I had only tried some recipes from the bread machine book and have been kind of disappointed.  Thanks for giving me faith.

This bread came out perfect, nice and light in the center with a crispy crust.  I set the bread machine for a medium crust. I did reduce the salt to 1 tsp as other reviewers recommended.

Perfect!  I wouldn't change a thing - the rosemary flavor is delightful.  Thank you for listing this recipe; it's a definite keeper!**UPDATE: This recipe continues to stand out above and beyond any other.  I especially love baking it on a baking stone sprinkled first with a little cornmeal.  Sooooo good!

Thank you Jo for a wonderful and easy recipe!!  My husband raved about this bread and told me I could make it every week.  The flavor and texture were super as is.  I only wish it made a slightly larger loaf so it didn't disappear so quickly!

This bread was wonderful. I melted a 1/4 cup of margarine and added a tsp of sea salt and brushed this over the loaf immediately after taking it out of the bread machine and it was amazing. Great dipped in peppered-olive oil.

I can't tell you how GOOD this recipe is!  I have made it numerous times and enjoy it everytime.  I always make a plate of extra virgin olive oil and fresh ground pepper to dip the bread in when eating it.  I can't get enough of this bread!  Thank you for the recipe!!

this was great. so moist. i used a flour called wholesome flour by Allinson rather than white so i had to add a bit more water but it was lovely. i made too much so had to freeze some and even after it had been frozen & defrosted it was still moist and full of flavour

This was a great recipe.  I didn't add any salt, like others recommended.  However, I used the Pampered Chef Rosemary seasoning, which has salt in it.  I would definitely make this again.

I just bought my first bread machine and this was the first recipe I tried.  Wonderful, but i'll agree with a previous reviewer that it's a little salty.  If you have a low tolerance for salt like I do, I suggest using just a teaspoon.

Great recipe.  The only modifications I made was to reduce the olive oil by 1 Tablespoon and use fresh rosemary instead of dried.  Very flavorful and not at all dry!

Wow!  This bread was excellent.  Had a great flavor to it.  This is one of those breads people will never believe you made at home.  I just popped the dough into the bread maker and baked it in the oven.  My house smelled wonderful.  I'm not sure if there will be any bread left for my husband to try before he gets home from work.

Great recipe! Tastes just like bread dipped in olive oil. Smells divine when baking. This has been added to my bread rotation...

very good bread. I made it in the bread machine but added 1/4 c. more flour. the next time I made it I tried adding wheat flour 1 c. and baked it in the oven... It was dry I think it needed a little more oil or something but it still tasted awesome!

Absolutely Delicious! I only used 2 tbsps of oil, and it turned out just great, I also used a mix of italian herbs instead of the individuals. If anyone has ever been to the Macaroni Grill, this bread tastes just like the bread they serve you there! Astoundingly delicious!

I used a little more sugar and a little less salt, as suggested by another poster, and was well pleased. It always gets compliments. I make it often, so I measure out the dry ingredients (minus flour) and keep it in small containers so they're ready to go whenever I want to bake it.

Yum! Very tasty. I let it mix and rise in the bread machine and then shaped it into a loaf to bake. I didn't get a crispy crust, but that's because I brushed the top with butter after it came out of the oven.

This bread was outstanding with my changes!! I subbed the 3T olive oil w/ 2T olive oil and 1T soft butter. I added 4t gluten. I used 2T fresh chopped rosemary instead of the dried. And I deleted the dried herbs and added chopped fresh herbs: basil, parsley, thyme, oregano, and sage. All together about 2T chopped. And then, of course, the clencher 1T chopped fresh garlic. I subbed out the sugar for fresh honey. OK....so maybe its a whole new recipe. 
The best thing about this bread ( i made it in a bread machine...TOTALLY EASY!) Was that it stayed fresh for 3 days!! We ate ALL OF IT!! Toasted it made great garlic toast for dinner. And when I thought it should be stale, it was still moist and yummy....I dried it out and used it to make stuffed game hens....Did I mention it was easy and delicious??

Mmmmmm DELICOUS!

This is such a great bread!  I used my breadmachine, then divided the dough in two, brushed it with Olive Oil, and baked it in the oven for a bit--the result: totally awesome dinner bread!  YUMMY!

This bread is one of my favorite now! I love rosemary and bread, and combining the two is even more delightful! To make it even better, I used milk instead of water, used a little less salt, used a pinch more of rosemary, and used about 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour instead of 3/4 cup of bread flour. Excellent served with olive oil and pasta!

This was a pretty little loaf of bread. It didn't rise too high, had a soft centre, and light crisp crust. When toasted it was really good and crunchy. I think this would also make a really nice foccacia dough. If you like rosemary, you will love this bread.

I could eat this whole loaf by myself. We dipped pieces in olive oil and freshly ground black pepper just like at Macaroni Grill.  I love the aroma that fills my kitchen while baking this bread.  I mixed this with my Kitchenaide and baked a round loaf for 25 or 30 minutes.  Boy is this good stuff.  Thanks Jo.

I appreciated the non-bread machine guidance in the comments. I proofed my yeast but I think my yeast got too hot during rising because it never doubled. I would definitely try it again though. I think coarse salt added to the top just before baking would be great!

Incredible! Followed tips from others and used the dough cycle in the bread machine, let rise for approx 1 hour (it didn't rise a ton with only 1.5 tsp yeast) then brushed with olive oil, rosemary, and salt. I baked for 15 minutes at 375 then switched to 400 and baked for 10 more minutes. I spritzed with water a few times to get a crispier outside crust but it was still soft and amazing inside.

It was so good, I made another one the next day with these adjustments both times:  I used 2 tsp bread machine yeast, and 2 tbs finely chopped fresh rosemary. I added the water salt, sugar and oil first, then the flour, then the yeast. I selected basic white, 1.5 size loaf. I added the rosemary, black pepper, and Italian seasoning when the machine reached the "mix in" stage (it's a Cuisinart bread machine). After the second rise I removed the dough from the machine and kneaded it for about a minute on a lightly floured surface. I placed the dough in a slightly oiled bread pan, covered it with a damp tea towel, placed it in a warmed oven for an hour to rise again.  I brushed the top with melted butter after and baked at 375 for 25 minutes. The aroma was awesome and the taste exceptional!

This bread is my usual for every Thanksgiving and Christmas. Both my mom and my mother in law request it. It's been at least 3 years if not more of my making it. It's soft on the inside and crispy on the outside with a great taste!

Excellent recipe. Made without a bread machine and it turned out delicious. Crispy crust and tender texture inside. Perfect by itself. No need for butter or dipping oil.

I picked the thick crust on the settings but came out a little too thick so next time I'll try medium or light options; also I added walnuts to the dough and sunflower and sesame seeds on top; it's a really good recipe...

This was the best recipe to break-in my new Oster bread machine! I've made this bread twice now with some modifications. First attempt, I followed other reviewers' advice and used milk instead of water, reduced the salt to 1-1/4 teaspoons, reduced the rosemary to 3/4 Tablespoons (dried and crushed with the back of a spoon), and added 1/4 cup of parmesan. The first loaf was yummy but rose too high and collapsed, probably because I'm at altitude. I used the 1.5lb light crust basic bread setting. Second attempt: Same mods as attempt #1 but also reduced yeast to 1-1/4 teaspoons, and the density ended up much more even and had a flatter top instead of collapsed. For my third attempt, I'll likely reduce the rosemary a bit more as it still smelled just a bit too medicinal and try to increase the yeast a tiny tiny bit to see if I can get to the perfect top. This is definitely a new favorite in our house!!

This bread was absolutely Amazing!  It was so good with a little butter along side a bowl of chili... and the house smelled Wonderful when it was baking.  I made it for a Sunday afternoon Football game. My son polished off the bread so quick he asked me how long would it take to make another... I looked at him and smiled. And said... I'll start it right now.

As others suggested, I put it in the bread machine on the "dough" cycle. Then took it out, put it in a greased (Pam) bowl, punched it down and covered it 10 min. Transferred it to a cookie sheet, covered it and let it rise 30 min (on top of the pre-heating oven). Brushed with EVOO, rosemary, and sea salt and cooked at 350 for 25ish minutes. Outstanding flavor.

So easy; so delicious. For some reason didn’t have regular olive oil so used rosemary olive oil we got around Christmas time. For this reason, reduced dried rosemary to 2 tsp. Put ingredients in bread maker -wet, dry, yeast in that order using basic cycle with light crust and walked away. Came home to delicious smell and perfectly done bread! Thank you so much for the recipe:)))

I made this bread tonight to go along with our dinner....annnnd I meant to take a picture of it, but my kids and I devoured the entire loaf before I could do so. When I say this is THE best bread I have ever tasted, I mean that this is THE best bread I have ever tasted. My kids even loved it, and they don't like anything. I will definitely make some more tomorrow.

Edit/ addition: It’s the next day, and I had to make it again because it’s so dang good. I’m just gonna go ahead and attach two loaves to my hips too while I’m at it, cause I know I’m not gonna be able to stop with this bread. I’m hooked.

made it in bread machine and im pretty new at using one, but it was delicious!!! right before the baking started i slit an X to let it breath and helped it rise a little better maybe. it was light enough and still a good density. the crust was that perfectly crispy, flaky, messy crunch that you want in a french bread. Took it to a potluck and boyfriend complained that he didnt get to try it before it was gone!

Made in a Kitchen Aid mixer. I added water gradually while mixing until the dough formed, and baked at 375 for 45 minutes. Perfectly light, fluffy, and just the right amount of flavor.

The rosemary flavour is very strong in this recipe.  I'd dial down the amount that you are using to one and a half to two teaspoons.  But beyond that, it turned out very well.  Moist and not too light.

I love this bread. I've made it as described and it was great, but I love it more with 1/4 more pepper, double rosemary and double italian seasoning. I make this bread multiple times every winter!

Fun and easy bread to make.  I let it rise in my machine using the Mix Dough cycle, then put it under a "tent" of clean dishcloths for 30 mins for a second rise, then popped it into a 389 degree oven.  Yummy.

The lack of instructions for people without machines was annoying, but the recipe looked too good not to try. 

I simply mixed the dry ingredients, then added the wet. Most yeast doesn't need a proof, and since I'm currently at high altitude, making it rise slower isn't a bad thing.

I used all-purpose flour, and Italian Herbs instead of Rosemary, as I did not have it on hand. I knead bread in the bowl, first with a spatula and then by hand until it passed the windowpane test. Another high altitude mod, I let it rise for 30 and then 15 minutes, brushed some thoroughly beaten egg on top, and baked at 350 F for 30 minutes. 

My loaf was perhaps slightly underbaked, but overall it turned out well. I do wish it were crisper on the outside, but that's more a technique I haven't mastered than a failing of the recipe. It is tasty bread, fine grained, and doesn't need butter to add flavor.  I'll be using it for toast and sandwiches.

It was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe religiously and was very pleased with the result. The only tweak I made was using coconut oil instead of butter.

This recipe is a family favorite - everyone raves about it. I use a bit more of a heaping tablespoon of rosemary, instead of exactly a tablespoon. Don't forget to follow the bread machine instructions, particularly the order of ingredients!

This makes a delightful small loaf of bread.  I did not use a bread machine and made the following changes: I used 3/4 cup lukewarm water with 1 tsp. of sugar and rapid rise yeast. Wait 10-15 minutes until foamy. Then add the rest of ingredients holding back on flour to see how much you'll need. Knead for 15 minutes and let rise in an oiled dish and cover.  I heat my oven to 200 and then turn it off. The bread rises quickly (it should double in size) in this environment. Punch down and shape into an oval loaf. I put mine in a bread pan, cover and let rise again.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees and bake for about 40 minutes or until nicely browned on top.  Olive oil on top with coarse salt. Delicious.

Oh my gosh I made this today and the bread is the easiest to make and is the lightest I have ever eaten.  I don't have a bread machine so followed the directions provided by a reviewer named Mary.  
> Proof yeast with 1 cup of water and sugar in the mixing bowl
>Add oil, salt, Italian Seasoning, pepper, rosemary, and 1 cup o f flour to mixing bowl.
>Mix on low for about 2 minutes
> Add 1 1/4 c. flour and let mix until dough pulls away from sides.
> Knead remaining 1/4 c. of flour by hand for about 8 min. (I didn't knead mine that long)
> Place in greased bowl and let rise for about 1 hour
> Punch down and place on sprayed cookie sheet in same shape as bowl (I used parchment paper instead of spraying)
> Cut an X on top
> Let rise for 1 hour
> Bake 375 for 20 min.
> Increase temp to 425 for 15 minutes
I will definitely make again and again and again!!!  Best bread recipe I have ever used!!!  WOW!!

Used bread machine yeast instead of active yeast, and it turned out great! We wrapped ? of remaining bread in aluminum foil and in the unused oven for storage. It’s still soft and fluffy the next day! Will make it again!

I've made 3 loaves and they've all turned out too soft/doughy in the middle, even when the outside is golden brown and crusty.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  Maybe my oven runs hot and I need to turn the temp down so it cooks more slowly.

I used all purpose flour instead and as far as I'm concerned it baked well with the yeast. This is an excellent alternative to garlic bread served with a pasta spaghetti sauce dinner. Easy to throw together and I recommend setting your bread machine for a medium crust cover. I will be making this again.

This was delicious, and I didn't even have the right spices.  Instead of rosemary, I used a spice blend that contained rosemary. I can't wait to buy some rosemary to see if it's even better. Since I was setting the delay timer to make the bread, I just layered the ingredients according to my machines directions. Last night, I made a grilled cheese with this bread, and it was perfection. The bread grilled up so nicely. I joked that now I know what bread I'll use for sandwiches when I open up my small bakery/coffee shop.

Made the dough in the bread machine but baked this in the oven according to baking instructions provided by another reviewer.  I added 1/4 cup whole wheat four, 2 1/4 white.  I also put olive oil and sea salt on the top.  I will definitely make this again!

Yes, yes, and double yes again!!! I made it today and the smells were absolutely amazing. I did the old fashioned way as I don't have a bread machine. But I did use my Kitchen-Aide with the bread attachment so as to lighten the mixing and kneading. When it all came together and the dough started to roll away and around the mixing bowl, you could tell that something wonderful was happening. I can't wait to try other bread ideas. I'm truly thankful for Jo's Rosemary Bread and All Recipes for posting the recipe. Easy as falling off a log. The smell in this house is marvelous beyond words, all I can say is "ahhh!!!".

I made my own Italian seasoning, and I used fresh rosemary in it. Having an Italian seasoning that places a particular emphasis on Rosemary really helps bring out the flavor. When I made this, I forgot to place the dough on the bread cycle, so I had to cook it in the oven. I put it at 425 degrees and cooked it for around 20-25 minutes. It was very fluffy, flavorful, and it was a very good use of the rosemary from my garden! I can't wait to make it again!

I made this 100% by the recipient, and entirely in my bread machine.  The texture and moistness were spot on.  Only problem was I didn't like the flavor.  I'm sure there are plenty that do, Judy not me.

I have never been to Macaroni Grill, but I do love herbal bread. This stuff was amazingly easy to make, and so good! The bread was done before the rest of the dinner, and my husband and I filled up on it so much that we couldn't eat that much of the main course.

So good! I used just the dough cycle of my machine and then baked it in a loaf pan for 30 min at 350. Turned out perfect and delicious! My husband keeps going back to the kitchen for just "one more slice" lol

I've recently tried this recipe, while I LOVE savory flavors, this....um....not quite for me. My hubs will eat ANYTHING, almost literally, whether it's a new try I cooked or not. But neither of us liked this. True to her word, it smelled wonderful and came out crisp on outside and wonderfully moist on inside, but as far as taste (and we tried pairing with different meals, toasted and un-toasted, it just didn't do it for us. Apologies, but I won't be keeping this one.

Excellent. I didn't have a bread machine, and didn't want to knead the dough. (I hate kneading.) I added yeast to 1 c warm water with a bit of sugar and let it sit for 10 min. I mixed all the ingredients, and added the yeast mixture that I had prepared. I gently kneaded by way of scooping up the mixture, scraping sticky bits on the surface and slapping it back down again for a few minutes. I let it sit in a covered bowl for about 5 hours in a slightly warm place. The dough doubled in size. I baked it at 375 until the crust became pale golden-brown.

I absolutely LOVE this bread! I made mine in the bread maker, but I may try to make it  in my oven, soon. I doubled the amount of Italian season, because I was low on Rosemary, but the next loaf will be quadruple the Italian seasoning because now I don't have ANY Rosemary. I think it would be just fine without the Rosemary, but the herb does add a nice fragrance. Anyway, give this one a try. It's excellent!

I followed this recipe exactly to accompany a potato and colored pepper soup recipe. I used my bread machine. It was easy and perfect, with a nice rise and a crispy but not too thick crust. My family ate it all instantly, so I made another loaf to go with leftover Christmas ham. It, too, disappeared quick. I will make this repeatedly.

Good initial flavor and texture.  Goes well with various savory sandwiches as a substitute for rye!

Doesn't last well. If you make this, promptly freeze uneaten portions.

Very good. Will make again. As somebody who likes rosemary, but not too much of it, the 1 Tbs. had me concerned.  I also didn't have Italian seasoning on hand, so I used about 1.5 tsp.  Rosemary, 1/2 tsp. oregano, and 1 tsp. basil. Turned out very yummy. Very nice textured bread, which I think is dup to the 3 Tbs. oil. I also like a crusty bread, so liked this one.

This is a great recipe for crusty herb bread with a tender center.  I put two tablespoons fresh rosemary and omit italian herbs.  For Italian bread I omit the rosemary and replace with 1 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp dried basil.  Very popular with my significant other.  Also added 1/4 tsp ginger as preservative, 1/4 Cup potato flakes and a few splashes of vinegar (a few breadmaking tricks).  A great basic recipe.  I don't bake it in the breadmaker.  Instead take it out, shape and let rise before baking.

YUM. How this isn't everyone's fav, I don't understand. My husband was going NUTS for it. Macaroni Grill, you've got competition. I want to do it by hand (and not in the bread machine) to see if it tastes any different. Would also like to sprinkle some whole rosemary on the top for a pretty finish.

Wonderful!  I don't have a bread maker so followed others' advice on making by hand. Turned out great. Only thing, i didn't have bread flour and used all purpose. Worked fine. And, I used 1TBS fresh rosemary and found it to be just right. I think a full tablespoon of dried might have been a little potent for my taste. I will definitely be baking this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

This bread is wonderful and the smell as it's baking is heavenly!  I've made it three times now in three days.  So simple in the bread machine with a big rosemary/artisan bread flavor.  My teenager says this is the best bread he's ever had, ever.  I used the dark crust setting and used dried rosemary that I crushed fine.  Also I left out the oil, substituting 2 additional tablespoons water instead -- you'd never guess it was fat free!

This is my go to recipe for bread! I use my bread machine to the dough stage. Next I either loaf it or make rolls. 
TIP: This is a great recipe for make ahead rolls and freezing! Just make regular rolls and place on parchment lined baking sheet then freeze! Once they are frozen I pop them off the parchment lightly dust with flour and put them in a freezer zip-lock  bag to store. I usually do a double batch when we have dinner guests, one for eating and one to freeze so I can pull out when I want one or two for me and my husband.

I made this bread in my machine with flour from my son's Pizza restaurant (Emilio Finatti Sicilian Pizzeria) I cut up fresh tender rosemary from my garden and used McCormick Tuscan Style Italian Seasoning.  My family loved it, we ate fresh warm slices topped with brie and cheddar cheese along with my homemade tomato soup.

I am an avid bread maker and a huge fan of Macaroni Grill's bread. I had high hopes for this bread, and it severely disappointed. It doesn't hold a candle to the "Romano's Macaroni Grill Rosemary Bread" recipe posted on Food.com by Hunter, and I actually found this bread to be disgusting. I've made it twice to make sure: once by hand and once by machine. The better version, posted on Food.com, uses the same amount of flour but with 1 tablespoon of yeast, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 2 tablespoons of rosemary, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 2 tablespoons of butter. There is no olive oil not pepper in that recipe. The differences in recipe are small, but it makes all the difference.

My first bread! My girlfriend gave me an old bread maker and just decided to use it. Probably I used more pepper and olive oil as I should but is nice anyway. I am going to repeat this again as I do love rosemary and the smell of this is awesome.

Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe as is. I will slice and spread generously with garlic parmesean butter and freeze. I can pull a few garlicy slices out and toast in the oven, or cube and crisp for salad croutons.

I have made this many times. I love the recipe. The only change I made was replacing the rosemary with only Italian seasoning. There is still rosemary in the blend but not as potent as pure rosemary. Rosemary is delicious but sometimes upsets my stomach.

LOVE IT! I don't have a bread maker but thanks to some very  helpful reviews I was still able to make this bread. I had some yeast left over from pizza night & wanted to use it up. It was my first time making bread, so I was a little nervous about the final outcome. I'm over it now! This is a great and simple recipe (I used my KA) & it made my house smell wonderful. I loved hearing all the "mmmms" during dinner. Because of this recipe I will now be making sure I have yeast all the time.

Made no changes.  Exactly as written into my bread machine and 3 hours later I had amazing bread.  Served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar - it was devoured!

I made this just as directed and it turned out great! It smells amazing while baking! The crust on mine turned out crispy but not too crunchy, I think that was because of how much oil is in it. I used the light crust setting on my bread machine. Next time I make this I think I'll try fresh rosemary but was absolutely delicious with dried herbs.

This was delicious! I had bread machine yeast instead of active dry, but it worked just fine- the texture was perfect, soft on the inside with a firm crust outside. I also had ground rosemary instead of dried, so I used half a teaspoon and it made for a very tasty but subtle herb flavor. Next time I will add some more rosemary and garlic for a richer flavor.

I've made this bread several times since I found the recipe and it is one of our favorites!  I do put some Italian seasoning in along with the rosemary and I've also added onion powder.  Turns out perfect in my bread machine.  I set it for the 1.5lb loaf with a medium crust and it is perfect!  Very comparable to the Macaroni Grill bread.  We serve olive oil with cracked black pepper on the side.

DELISH!!!  Super light and slightly chewy.  Absolutely awesome.  Next time I make, I'm going to leave off the rosemary and Italian seasonings and just do it straight bread.  Only thing I would change about this recipe is less salt.  The crust was pretty salty.  Will definitely do it again!

This is my favorite bread recipe. I haven't changed any of ingredients, however, I have changed the order. I dilute the sugar in to the water (about 100 degrees) and then add in the yeast and stir it in. Once the yeast is activating (1-3 minutes, depending on the yeast) then I add the rosemary but I crush it a bit in my hand as I am putting it in. Then I add the olive oil.  After that, I add the rest of the ingredients, with the flour going in last( I do this in my bread maker, by the way). As I said, it's my favorite bread recipe.

We love this recipe!  It is so easy and so tasty!  I let the dough rise once in my bread machine, take it out, punch it down, then using an oiled 10-inch cast iron skillet, I pinch off golf-ball size pieces and roll lightly between my palms and fill the skillet, sides touching, with various sizes of dough.  When this bakes, it becomes a great pull-apart bread to serve with olive oil and spices.  Yum!!  Thanks for sharing!

I make bread fairly often, but this was my first loaf of Italian style bread. I followed the suggestions of others and proofed my yeast in 1/4c water  with a pinch of sugar. I did the whole thing with my KitchenAid mixer - letting it do all the work. I just let the dough rise in the bowl in the oven with the light on. It turned out beautifully - a perfect loaf with great consistency and flavor.  Thank you!

Love this recipe! It's perfect as is, makes a great textured bread with fabulous flavour. Because I love this breads texture and taste I've used the base recipe so many times and tried other fun breads, like replaced all the herbs and spices sign cinnamon and pumpkin pie spices. Or I've changed all the herbs and spices to different garlic herbs! Love love this recipe !

This is my go to bread machine bread. I've made it loads of times in a 1 lb, 1.5 lb, and 2 lb loaf size (the recipe here is for a 1.5 lb loaf) and various crust settings and it comes out delicious every time. I follow the ingredient list to the letter, but there have been times where I didn't have enough rosemary on hand so I just added more italian seasoning and it's still great. I highly recommend this recipe, especially for beginner bread makers who want to wow their friends and family!

Soon good!  Just like macaroni grills bread.  I prepared mine in the bread maker then cooked it in the oven following another reviewers directions.  I probably should have let it rise more as it didn't rise much in the oven but still tasted great,

I found this bread way too salty. I will definitely try to make this recipe again as it was quite good (being too salty aside).

This bread bakes beautifully and the wonderful aroma had my mouth watering in anticipation. We will make this one again. The only change I made was to use fresh rosemary instead of dried.

This is delicious bread!  I made a couple of changes based on reviews.  I used fresh rosemary (the whole little package from the grocery store), a 1/4 t dried thyme, a 1/4 t freeze dried basil a couple shakes of garlic and onion powder.    I used 1/4 C half & half and 3/4 C of water and only 1 t kosher salt.  I set my bread maker to 1 1/2 pound loaf on the French bread setting - YUM!  The texture is like an artisan bread, crunchy crust and chewy interior!!
Thanks Jo for a wonderful bread machine bread recipe :-)

This bread is very, very good.  The only changes I have made to it to make it amazing, are:  3 T garlic olive oil in place of the olive oil, and 2 C bread flour + 1/2 C whole wheat flour instead of all bread flour.  It is my family and friends' favorite.

My husband asks for this bread regularly. I make it according to instructions, except I used fresh rosemary from my garden and a little bit of oregano. I make it in my breadmaker on the dough setting and then let it rise on a pan in a plastic bag in the oven. Then, I bake it as Muffinmom suggested. It turns out wonderfully!

I gave this a try and it came out GREAT! It came about fluffy and golden, but I did use the light color setting on my machine. I used fresh herbs from my garden adding thyme and oregano as well. I didn't add Italian seasoning, the fresh herbs were enough. I used cracked pepper instead of ground pepper in mixture. I believe fresh is absolutely the way to go with this recipe. I read comments and found great ideas like brushing it with olive oil and sea salt. It goes well with the Olive oil, balsamic, sea salt and cracked mix pepper dip like at Macaroni grill. Love this recipe!

So yummy.  I used fresh rosemary and followed other reviewers advice only adding 2 1/2 tsp of rosemary, it didn't quite give it enough flavor for my liking.  Next time I will use the amount called for.  I also used spelt flour, because that was all I had.  Brushed the top with oil and sprinkled coarse salt on top and baked it on an oiled cookie sheet at 375 for 30 min.  My family loved it.

Great recipe, turned out well, I had to sprinkle a lot of flour to get the dough ball to not stick to my hands so much. It still did, but I didn't want it too dry so I went easy on the flour coating. I like how this recipe does not require butter, who needs all that cholesterol with bread anyhow. I'd make a biscuit if I want buttery yumminess.

Yum, yum, yum! I love this bread! My bread machine did not like it, so I just use my machine to knead the dough and I baked it in a loaf pan. I used the quick rise yeast, so an hour between handling, as other reviewers suggested, was too much. I will cut it down to 40 minutes next time. I find the bread a bit salty, however, and I decreased the salt by a third.

Wow!  I didn't leave a review on this bread already?  This is my hub's favorite bread from this site......, maybe his fav all around bread.  He loves it with balsamic vinegar and oil and/or pepper if we don't have balsamic around (though that pepper option is a distant second for him).  Thanks for making me a better cook for my fella!  (yes, he's a good cook too, but I doubt he'll ever make bread..... *grin* even with the help of a bread machine...., that's funny, huh?), though I do bake in the oven....., oh, and though it's a bit heavier, I do use half whole wheat.......

This dough makes great pizzas.  I can use much less cheese and other high fat foods because the crust is so good. My only alterations are I reduce the olive oil by 1/3 and use fresh Rosemary.  Makes great bread too.

This bread is so good, I had to create an all-recipes profile just so I could review it! Crispy crust, chewy insides, great flavor - I'll be saving this one for sure! Changes: I used about 3 T fresh rosemary instead of dried, and I baked the dough in the oven at 375 for 45 minutes.

Made this this evening in my bread maker and did it exactly as written.  (I noticed in the reviews many just put it in the oven.) It turned out great and my picky husband loved it too. Very soft and flavorful! I put it in my bread maker at the 1 1/2 lb loaf with a medium crust. PERFECT! And I will definitely make again!

This recipe was so yummy! This was the first time that I used my bread machine and I was looking for a simple but good recipe.   This was a great choice, thank you.

I used this recipe in conjunction with my go to bread maker recipe, using a combination of butter 1.5 T, and Olive oil 1T,1 1/8 c water,a whole pkg of yeast, 1.5 c wheat flour, 1.5 c AP flour, 2T sugar,1.5 T dry milk,a t salt. I increased the Italian seasoning to a teaspoon and added 1T of rosemary, along with the black pepper.It rose nicely, but was dense enough for sandwiches. I have always struggled with getting bread just right,but this one was perfect,,

I used Pampered chef rosemary as the rosemary herb.  This bread was excellent for flavor and the texture was soft and tender.

This bread is amazing.  I followed the directions exactly and the loaf comes out light and fluffy and it doesn't fall at all.  This was so good that we ate the entire first loaf and I made a second one that same day.   It does have a very strong rosemary flavor.  If you don't like rosemary...probably not the bread for you.

So good! My family ate it down to the very last crumb. My 7 year old said that it was " too good". Thanks for a great recipe!

I will make a few changes next time though to suit our own tastes. 2 tsp sugar and only one 1tsp of salt like the other reviewers had recommended.

This is a great bread recipe.  A key thing to remember, as always, is that ingredients go wet to dry.  I've also used this recipe as the base of a pepperoni roll, and let me tell you... WOAH!

It is such a wonderful bread. Though I still have little problem in raising the bread perfectly, and the texture remains a bit weird, it is the best bread I've made so far.

Made exactly as written but without bread machine.  Added EVOO and sea salt on top before baking.  After tasting, kids immediately yelled "it's Macaroni Grill bread!"  Will definitely make again - delicious!

I LOVE this bread!!! I've made it so many times. I make the dough in my bread machine on the dough cycle. Then I either stretch it to make a baguette or divide it and make about 16 dinner rolls. I've also used it to make about 4 large buns for my husband's sandwiches in his lunches.

We make this recipe at least twice a month - it's my favorite and the kids love it too! I always follow the recipe and it's perfect as it is We enjoy it warm with butter and rarely have any leftover, but when we do, it's great for sandwiches.

I've made this bread several times - even doubled the recipe!  Excellent soft inside, crispy crust.  Rosemary-wise, I added 1/2 dried rosemary and 1/2+ fresh rosemary.  Thank you for posting; it's a family favorite.

I have been making this bread now for a few years and it is great every time. I add more salt and little garlic to mine according our taste. At times too, I have added different herbs to give it new flair. Today I am going to attempt to make rolls with the dough. Purely experimental. Best recipe I have tried on allrecipes.com. Thank you for sharing it.

This is the first recipe I have ever made in my new bread maker! And wow was I impressed. I did use fresh rosemary instead of dried and chopped it very small. Turned out AMAZING! So happy with this recipe and will use it from years to come!

Love, love, LOVE!!  I made this to go with dinner one night, and it came out fabulous!  It was so delicious that the loaf was all gone by the next afternoon.  My fiance (who is quite the cook himself) loved this recipe, that he made another loaf the next day!  This one is a keeper for us.  Thanks for sharing! :)

Made this yesterday, followed the directions exactly and set my bread machine to Large Loaf, White Bread, Medium Crust.  Brushed with a bit of olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt.  AMAZING!!!!  So easy and my family raved.  My husband said I was a cooking WIZARD.  Hey - anything that gets my hubby to call me a wizard is a 5 star recipe.  Thank you for sharing this one!!!!

This is my favorite bread recipe!  I LOVE rosemary and usually dip this in olive oil and seasonings or make garlic bread with it.  It disappears at pot lucks!

I've made this many times, but this time I experimented by replacing the yeast with my sourdough starter.  I had to do some math to make the conversions and I ended up having to do it by weight, and it ended up like this: 255 g flour, 195g water and 90g of 100% hydration (equal weight water/flour) sourdough starter.  I did put in a little over a 1/4 tsp yeast to make sure it would rise.  All the other ingredients were the same.  It took about 5 hours to rise and it turned out fabulous!  I think next time I would leave out the yeast entirely to give an even slower rise = better sourdough flavor.  Yum!

Fantastic recipe - bread is soft and has a great crust. Made it in my Zojirushi - brushed it with olive oil. Served with EVOO and pomegranate molasses - heavenly !!

Update: agree with some others here - mixed it in the bread machine then kneaded it by hand for about 50 strokes let it rest for 30 mins and then baked in oven for 30 mins at 375 deg F -also using fresh rosemary takes it from great to the GREATEST !!

I love this recipe!! Every time I make it, I end up having to make 2-3 batches.  My son eats the first one before it can get cool. I am allergic to black pepper, so I don't use it.  Otherwise, I follow the recipe and it is wonderful!  I have also made it with fresh rosemary from the yard, when I didn't have any all ready dried.  It was still wonderful.

Delicious! Been eating it with soups, a perfect accompaniment. I added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder to the recipe, didn't make the loaf garlicky, just made the flavor more robust without adding more salt

Wow, this is the best bread I've made yet. Made it by hand just like the most helpful review suggested, added a teaspoon of sugar to the water/dry yeast mix to proof it and have it foam. We divided the dough into thirds and braided them just before baking. Baked it for 35 mins and it was perfect! So soft inside with a nice crust and so delicious. I will make this again and again, maybe I'll use raisins for a sweet version next time.

I've been making this recipe for quite a while now and I love it.  But tonight I tried something a touch different that made it the BEST bread I've ever made.  I cut the salt back to 1 tsp.  Used 1 tablespoon fresh dill and cut back on the dried rosemary.  Also added a dash of dried onion bits.  Unreal bread.  Thanks Jo!

I love rosemary so I was excited when I found this recipe.  The first time I made it exactly to the recipe and was disappointed.  I like a moister chewier bread.  The second time I followed the suggestion of another reviewer, replaced the water with milk and added an egg and reduced the amount of milk.  I got the consistency  and chewiness I was looking for.  It was much better.  It's a very good bread but not as great as so many claim.  There are much better recipes on this site like the whole wheat rolls I make both as rolls and loaves in my bread machine.  I'll make it again but it's not going to be my go to recipe.

Made in the breadmaker using the french bread cycle. I added garlic powder as well (about 1/2 a teaspoon) and did everything else as described. I had guests over and they totally devoured it!

This bread is BETTER than Macaroni Grill's!  I made it last night and will be making it again today.  The only change I made was using fresh Rosemary, I used about 3 Tablespoons.  Oh, the only flour I had on hand was King Arthur all purpose, but, I've been using it in place of bread flour and it works fine. The bread smelled wonderful as it baked and tasted even better!  Sooo good!

I made this recipe using the exact amounts and ingredients given and it was fabulous!!!!!  The only difference is that I made it by hand without a bread maker since I do not have one. Either way, this recipe is definitely a keeper!!!  So easy!

What an amazing bread, it will definitely become a staple in our home!  I made mine old school-style without the breadmaker, turned out just fine.  I followed the advice of some reviewers and only used 2 tsp of rosemary, next time I will probably go full strength as it was not as overpowering as I would have thought.  I sprayed the bread with EVOO and sprinkled a bit of kosher salt on top before baking, but the bread ended up being a touch too salty (lesson learned).

I have made this bread many times to my delight.  After thinking about the wonderful flavor of the bread itself, i decided to make it without the rosemary - it was amazing!  Just added the Italian seasoning and we loved it just as well.  Fantastic bread with or without the rosemary.  thanks, Jo!!!

I made this bread today after looking for something I had around the house to take to a friend's to compliment a garlic/cheese hot dip. As another reviewer mentioned: used bread machine to make dough, then put bread in the oven (actually I took the dough to my friends in a baggy, and baked in a round cake pan). I didn't have the Italian seasoning, so I substituted, 1/4 tsp. garlic pepper, 1/4 tsp oregano, and 1/4 basil. This smelled and tasted GREAT! Thanks for the easy recipe!

I did the dough cycle on my bread machine and then baked this in a loaf pan at 375 for 35 minutes.  Very yummy right out of the oven dipped in some olive oil with a little salt.  Took some to work today and everyone went crazy over it.  I added a little garlic powder and next time think I'll add a little more salt.  Didn't have any Italian seasoning so I did a mixture of basil, oregano, and parsley.  Will make again...and again!

I have not had much experience with Rosemary before, so did not know what to expect.  I love making different breads, and so looked forward to this one.  I guess I am not big on Rosemary, but DH really liked it.  If I make this again, I think I will add less Rosemary.  Thanks Jo for sharing your recipe!!

I thought the texture was not the best.  Maybe it was because I did not use a bread machine, I don't know.  I made them as rolls, and when they were done, they were not visually appealing.  They still looked raw.  I also thought they were pretty bland.  I will up the rosemary if I try this again.

A friend posted the link to this recipe on her facebook status yesterday.... I decided this morning that I would try to make it and discovered I only had whole wheat breadmachine flour.... Finally I decided to try it anyway AND IT WORKED!  For the first time, I enjoyed something rosemary in it.  Yumyum!

This bread is fantastic!  It turned out great in my bread machine.  I made it on the longer setting (4 hours) for white bread and that gave it enough time to brown evely.  Tastes just like the bread at Macaroni Grille.

Great with olive oil and pepper. Really does remind me of Macaroni Grill. I used 1 TB of fresh rosemary, but otherwise followed the recipe.

Took the liberty of adding some Red Pepper flakes, as we tend to like a little spice, and it's going with a 7 bone crock pot stew with tons of veggies tonight (Yeah, we eat late, that's what you get when you work nights)... Sounds Terrific though!  It's in the breadmaker right now. :-)

Wonderful bread recipe, I just made this, only I did not have any rosemary so I used a combination of Basil and Savory instead. The crust is a little hard to cut through (but that is okay with me!). Next time I may do as another reviewer suggested and use milk instead to lighten up the crust. This recipe is a keeper!

This bread is awesome! I used dried rosemary and it didn't taste too strong. I also brought this along for a dinner party at my mothers house and everyone devoured it, so needless to say, we love this bread!!!

Delicious! Mine turned out a little dense but I think that's because I started late and had to cook on the fastest speed on my breadmaker. I did as another person suggested and added less rosemary (2 tsp) becase of my kids and it was still so aromatic. Thanks for the great recipe!

The whole family loved it!  I substituted 1% milk for the water.  The inside of the bread was very soft and moist and the crust was perfectly crispy. My breadmaker requires that I put in loaf size and crust color.  I put in size "M" and "medium" color crust.

Wonderful bread with lots of flavor! My family loved it. The crust it lightly crisp and the inside is soft. It isn't chewy like french bread, it's similar to white bread. I made mine in my bread machine. I selected basic, loaf size was 1.5, and a medium crust color. I also added some sesame seeds. Since I didn't have Italian Seasoning, I just added some oregano and basil. Will make again!

So, so, so good!  Probably the best recipe I've made for my bread machine so far.  Light with a crispy crust and with an intoxicating aroma as it bakes.  I set my bread machine for 1.5 lb loaf, Basic setting with a Light crust.  Also substituted in 1.5 cups Whole Wheat flour instead, turned out perfectly!

We found the rosemary taste much too strong for our liking and found that the bread did not seem to cook evenly the whole way through.  I also do not think that the olive oil seemed to go evenly throughout the bread.

Followed the recipe exactle; good bread dipped in olive oil. Next time I will increase the rosemary and italian seasoning a bit. Didn't quite taste like Macaroni Grill bread but close. Will definitely make again.

Wowza! That's the best loaf of bread that I've ever made. I followed muffinmoms instructions coating with olive oil, sprinkling with sea salt and baking at 375 for 20 mins and another 10 at 425. Awesome recipe.

I thought this bread tasted very good, but it didn't rise very high for me, so I had a rather dense loaf of yummy bread :)  I am going to try tweaking it a bit to see what works best for this loaf with my bread machine.

The crust was too tough and thick.  And it was rock hard the next day.  Flavor was good.

This is a wonderful soup bread. I made it with whole wheat flour and fresh rosemary and it came out perfect. This would also be great in one of the Italian bread salads on this site, which calls for rosemary bread.

I wish I could make this a 4.5* It has nice flavor but mine was very dense.  I put my machine on dough setting and then let rise in a loaf pan for about and hour.  Then I baked at 375 for about 20 min.  I did use 3/4 cup milk and 1/4 water.. It's good I ate it but wish it was a little lighter.

Wonderful recipe! Crusty on the outside, soft in the middle. I have to tweak it a bit, I guess because of the humid climate here in Malaysia. I only use 6oz water and had to add an additional 1/2 cup of bread flour.

This was delicious bread.  I did have some issue with the dough when I took it out of the bread machine, it was very sloppy.  I kneaded in a bit more flour.  Next time I will had 2-3 more tablespoons to the mix.  Very delicious with balsamic vinegar and basil dipping sauce.

This bread is delicious.  I used the bake rapid mode on my machine as I was in a time crunch, and it did not have time to rise as much as I would have liked.  I look forward to trying this recipe on the regular bake mode.  Flavor/consistency was still amazing.

I should have trusted my instincts when I saw the amount of water to flour.  My machine calls for 3 cups flour to 1 1/8 c water - I made this on the dough cycle, planning to bake it as a free form loaf, but when the cycle was over, the "dough" was so runny, I could have poured it out (but it would have run all over the place!).  I tried to rescue it, adding the 1/2 c flour and some extra yeast, and ran it through the dough cycle again, but it was a bust (I think the ratio of yeast to the rest of the ingredients was off).  It smelled good, though, when I finally got it to the oven, so I plan to make this again, using the proportion of flour to water and yeast that my machine calls for, probably increasing the rosemary a tad, too, to compensate for the extra volume of ingredients.

Yum yum yum.  This is such a refreshing bread. A great change from our normal white bread. Packed with flavor. Love the olive oil flavor that permeates the loaf.

This bread was so good. It was light and full of flavor. It was also easy to make. Not only was it one of best tasting breads that I have tried but it also made my place smell so great. My fiance said that I am becoming domesticated and that I must make it more. We used this bread to make crostini, just dipped it into balsamic vinegar and olive oil. A repeat for sure.

I screwed this up I think.  I'm a beginner, and the dough came out okay.  I don't have a bread maker so I used tips from others on making it by hand.  I am in Colorado so I know the bake time is always longer.  But my bread didn't bake all the way I don't think, because it was very "doughy" tasting.

Turned out perfect and is amazing with dipping sauce. I used olive oil, fresh pepper, balsamic vinegar, and Parmesan cheese. Just play with the ingredients. I kept adding small amounts of vinegar and pepper around to taste. Italian butter probably tastes great as well. Overall great bread....

I found that this recipe produced a wet, heavy dough that didn't rise as well as I'd like.  I increased the sugar to 2 teaspoons and added 1 tablespoon of flour and 1 tablespoon of wheat gluten.  The result was a better dough structure and a better loaf.

I was not all that impressed with this bread. It was just okay. It wasn't terrible, and it wasn't the best bread I have ever had either. Sure, the convinience of the bread machine is great, but I have always found that when it comes to good bread, convinience almost always takes away from really good flavor; and such is the case with this bread.

I made this bread in my bread machine (Oster) on the 58 minute ExpressBake. The loaf was not very pretty when it came out, as it cracked on the top toward the end of the cycle. However, the taste was AMAZING. I brushed the top with olive oil and sprinkled course salt on top. The bread was dense, but fluffy. And it is an extremely savory bread. If you want to lay off the rosemary a bit, you could. But I personally like extreme flavor. Using the ExpressBake, I used warm milk (instead of water) so that the crust would be softer and I added an additional 2.5 teaspoons of rapid rise yeast. Yum!

This is fantastic! I substituted milk for the water (another user had suggested this) and doubled the Italian seasoning. I also went a little heavy on the rosemary. Definitely one of the best breads I've ever had.

absolutely wonderful! This is my husband's new favorite!!! I used the dough cycle on my bread machine and formed the dough into a ball. I let it rise again for about 30 minutes then baked- the result was a beautiful large round.

Great recipe! Very simple and yet very good. I added more italian herbs -than the recipe calls for - used Lighthouse Freeze Dried Italian Herb Blend and used about 1 tbsp of it. I also used fresh rosemary instead of the dried. Results were great and I received many compliments for this bread but the greatest compliment of all was that we had friends come over last night and the bread was gone in no time...:-) Thanks Jo!!!

I was a little hesitant to add this much rosemary, but it was not overpowering at all. Absolutely delicious!! Thank you for the amazing and easy recipe.

This came out tasting and smelling wonderful! I will make this again for sure. I did use 1% milk instead of water and I used my dough cycle to allow longer rise time, then did a bake cycle for 45 min at 325.. perfect and airy.. just like I like bread to be.

Wow... This is amazing. I'll echo all the other reviews and say it tastes very similar to the Macaroni Grill bread.  I will definitely be making this over and over again.

I have made 5 loafs in the past two days.  This bread is excellent. Took one loaf to my neighbor right out of the oven they had almost eaten the whole loaf before I left their house and I was only there 5 minutes.  Great Bread! Thank you! DeeDee

This bread was disappointing (especially after reading all of the reviews).  The flavor was just not as expected.  Next time I will not follow the recipe but try other people's suggestions.... like using milk instead of water, fresh rosemary, and fresh ground black pepper. I will also do it by hand and not with a bread machine.

WOW. SO Good! Try it with whole wheat flour and some added gluten (to make sure the bread rises).  Definitely feel free to add more pepper and rosemary too!

For the bread machine, it turns out best if you add the ingredients in order from the bottom up (yeast to water). One reviewer stated that she used 1 cup of milk rather than 1 cup of water. So, I split the difference and used 1/2 a cup of milk and 1/2 a cup of water. The bread was awesome! This recipe is a keeper!!! Thank you Jo!!

We made this in the bread maker and I was not as impressed.  Next time I will make it with fresh rosemary and mix it by hand.  It went great with the Portugese Chorizo soup on a snowy day!

It's a bit salty (but not too salty), which I confess makes it tasty. I will try it next time with 1/4 teaspoon less salt. Also, I haven't eaten at the macaroni grill in over 5 years - but everyone is right, it tastes just like their bread - it hit me when I took the first bite. It was delicious.

My husband loves Macaroni grill so when I told him this one was supposed to taste just like their famous bread he was all in.  This was a quick recipe to throw into the bread maker and in the end my husband declared  that it did taste just about like the "real" thing.  We had it with some olive oil and balsmic vinegar - amazing!

I made this for the first time today and took it to a dinner party.  It was a hit!  Fabulous smell, wonderful texture and taste.  I don't have a breadmaker, but using standard breadmaking sequence using my KitchenAide mixer.  I recommend this without reservation.  I will probably be making another loaf within the week.

This bread is wonderful!! The only diffference I made was to put the water, sugar, and yeast in the bread machine first and allow it to foam for 10 minutes.  I only used the bread machine on the dough setting and baked it in a bread pan in the oven. 375 for 30 min was perfect .I will now go back and make it the exact way the recipe says and see if there was any difference.

This bread is quite literally a staple in my home, I have made it almost weekly for the past year.  I like to add 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper for more emphasis on the delicious herbs in this recipe! One of the three tablespoons can also be infused chili pepper flake oil, which is easy to make at home.

I make this bread regularly, it's perfect for toast, tuna sandwiches, ham sandwiches, with brie at a party, whatever. My roommates think I'm some kind of domestic god when I make this stuff, it fills the house with the best smell and I know they love me more because of this delicious bread. The only thing I do differently is half the salt. Amazing recipe!

I made this originally for bread without a machine, but ended up as a pizza crust.  I ended up taking off the toppings and enjoyed the lovely, fragrant bread.  We did recognize the taste as Macaroni Grill's bread, yummy.  Will make next time as a loaf, it's outstanding and so easy to make, even manually.  Thanks!!

This bread was fantastic. My husband, myself, and my friend ate an entire loaf last night alongside dinner without realising it! I'm going to make another loaf soon to bring to my mothers-in-law.

Great! Really tasty, I think this will deff. be part of my permanent recipe box! However, one word of caution, watch the level of salt in this recipe I halved it and it was perfect for our taste. Try this with your favorite cheese dip, it is sooo delectable. Thanks for the recipe :)

Great taste and texture. Sometimes I add 1/4 tsp of garlic powder for something a little different but it is really perfect as is.

Very yummy.  I made it w/o the bread machine.  It turned out very good...but there was still something not-quite-right with the texture.  BUT..the taste is great...so I will be making this again (with some modifications)

One of the only reasons I prefer Macaroni Grill to other Italian restaurants is because of their bread. This recipe is even better than theirs! I just made a loaf of this, and am rather pleased with it. It is amazingly fragrant, and delicious! I will definitely be making this again!

This is a great receipe.  Very moist yet with a nice crust.  However, I added a little bit of garlic paste to the receipe.  If you like garlic you got to try it that way. YUMMMMMMMMY!!!

Ridiculously easy recipe. I made the dough in a bread machine and baked it in the oven. 375 degrees for 25 minutes. Perfect!

The first time I made this was not successful, but turned into great croutons. Since I was sure it was caused by my error somewhere I tried again and this time made good bread.  I toss a few ice cubes in the bottom of the oven and get a nice crunchy crust and moist crumb.

Used garden fresh rosemary for this recipe.  I followed a previous reviewers suggestion to use milk instead of water for a slightly softer crust.  I ran the ingredients in the bread maker, then formed a 2 small loaves and baked in the oven (following another reviewers suggestion for time and temp) at 375 for 30 minutes.  40 minutes would be the perfect cooking time for one loaf.  The request was already made for me to make more of this!!

I used fresh Rosemary from the garden and 1/2 cup of cheese. Pretty good flavor.  A brush of garlic olive oil would be nice.

Not exactly like Mac Grill bread, but extremely close and very good.  If you are making this by hand, be sure to proof the yeast before adding in the other ingredients.

This is great. My friend had a slice and said it tastes just like her favorite bread that she gets at Macaroni Grill!! They only difference is that this bread is not as crunchy on the outside. Anyway, this is a good bread to go with a nice pasta and dinner salad.

Loved it...One Tbsp of fresh rosemary is the perfect essence and the cracked black pepper is an imperative and flavorsome addition. The crumb has swirled texture with substance unlike  soft white bread. Must try!

This worked out great in the bread machine. It's a very wet dough, but turns out fine. It was much too salty for me, so I'm going to reduce the salt to 1 teaspoon next time I make it.

Oh my goodness this bread is amazing!  I love the bread from Macaroni Grill and I swear this one is even better!  I followed the directions exactly except for adding in an extra 1/4 tsp of garlic powder.  I was a little skeptical of this bread when putting it in--it makes a very moist dough and it seemed better suited to a pan than a cookie sheet to me, and sure enough, the second rise (on pan) turned it more into foccacia than bread.  However, I reshaped it, put it in the oven, and did the last 15 minutes with a tray with ice cubes (crisper crust--same as misting)...just tasted it and it is FANTASTIC!

I made this recipe by hand, as I don't have a bread machine. I totally goofed up this entire recipe when I made it, (bread is not my forte).  I ended up adding so much more of everything that I just ended up feeling better about pulling the dough apart and making it into biscuits.  WOW...they turned out FABULOUS!  I used a ton of fresh rosemary from my garden too. Could've been softer on the inside, (but that was definitely my fault).  The strangest thing about it though, was that they tasted almost "buttery", yet they have no butter in them???  Thanks Jo, for a great recipe!

So good!  Really enjoyed this bread.  I think it would make great sandwiches, too -- like leftover roasted turkey or chicken breasts.  I made the dough in the bread machine, then shaped it into a log, cut some small slits in top, let it rise, and baked it in the oven.  I'm not crazy about the "look" of bread baked in my bread machine.  This way it looked like artisan bread!

This bread is amazing. My son cut the first piece and when he bit into it said "This is just like the Macaronni grill bread."  I used fresh rosemary (1 tablespoon minced) and it was just right for our taste.  I also made this by hand not bread machine, shaped into an oval loaf and baked 375 till lightly browned.  This goes in the "keeper" file under "Family says this is best bread ever!"

I made this without a breadmaker using the advice of other reviewers. I added about 1/2 TBSP more rosemary which was a mistake, it was a little overpowering. The crust on this bread is amazing!

Simply amazing!  I made this by hand using oregano instead of Italian seasoning and it was divine.  Five stars is not enough!

This bread is my new favorite!  I made it two nights in a row, sent half home with my mother who makes her own bread.  I used a little more than a T. fresh rosemary, but I really like the taste of it.  Thanks for sharing!

Wow! This bread is soooooooooo good! It gets 5 stars for flavor and texture! Yummy! I brushed the top of the loaf with olive oil after baking & then we dipped slices of it in olive oil when we had it with soup. EVERYONE loved it!

This bread is very delicious, but is a tad too salty (hence the 4 stars rather than 5). Decrease the salt to about 1 tsp and it turns out to be just about right! I made one loaf yesterday and another today (both by hand using some of the tips the other reviewers left) and the one with less salt I made today disappeared so much more quickly! Half of it was gone within 10 minutes of leaving the oven!!! :)

Most delicious bread I've ever tasted.  My hubby wants me to keep it in the house at all times.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  It is a smaller loaf.

I love this bread because it so aromatic and soft. I used fresh rosemary instead or dried, substituted oregano and basil for Italian seasoning, and added a few dashes of garlic powder.

This is fantastic!!  Just like Macaroni Grill.  I made a copycat version of the Macaroni Grill dipping sauce to go with this....it was great!  The only slight change I made was to only use 1/2 TBL. rosemary instead of 1 TBL.  Besides that, my husband wants me to make this all the time. :)   Thank you Jo for submitting this recipe.

I made this with a sourdough starter on bread stone. I spritzed it with olive oil and toped it with course sea salt. The crust was very delicate and the bread had an excellent flavor. I didn't give it five stars because it was too soft.

I thought this dough was going to kill my bread machine!! It was squeaking and shaking, which has never happened before! I saved it by taking it out after the first knead and let rise in my warm oven. I then baked it at 375 for 30 minutes as someone had suggested. The only changes I made were milk instead of water, applesauce instead of oil and topped it with parm cheese. Overall it was very yummy, but I almost lost my bread machine...no loaf is worth that!

Mmmmm, absolutely wonderful. My husband and I made this recipe exactly as shown and it is so good. We're on our 3rd loaf, which the 3rd time I added 2tbsp's onion flakes. Our machine makes 2-1/2lb loaves but this recipe makes about 1/2 a loaf. Not sure how to adjust the recipe to make a bigger loaf. Our egg salad and flakes of turkey sandwiches are to die for.

Too heavy, it didn't rise. Not sure why as I followed it to the T. I used the bread machine on Basic setting. It also had too much rosemary.

SO GOOD! This disappeared within twelve hours of baking! I used a 1.5 tbsp fresh rosemary, trying to find a safe medium in regards to the other reviews, and it was perfect! I also made it completely by hand because I don't have any of that fancy schmancy gadgets.

This is the best bread I have ever eaten, period!  It was so good that I made four loaves in two days as gifts.  Everyone who has tried it raved on and on about how good it is.  I have made other breads and they say they're good being polite but this bread made everyone honestly go bonkers!

No wonder this is a 5-star recipe, it's BETTER than the bread from Macaroni Grill!  Like someone else suggested, I brushed the tops with egg beater's and sprinkled with sea salt.  It totally looked professional :).

I made this recipe with a Sunbeam Bread Machine that I had just removed from the box.  It is amazingly good and the texture is perfect.  I used two tablespoons of fresh rosemary from my garden instead of dried.  I followed the recipe to the letter otherwise.  I just replaced the $4.00 a loaf Rosemary bread from the bakery.

Phenomenal bread. You really can't go wrong with this. I made it for my VEGAN friends, since the ingredients are so simple. I used 2 TBSP of fresh rosemary, and it was delicious.

This bread seems like it fell from heaven! It tastes wondrful, the rosemary gives it a very unique flavor. Since I only had rosemary leaves, I threw them in a plastic bag and mashed them with the dull end of a knife. My only recommendation would be to lower the amount of salt and add more sugar. I like my bread sweet! :)

OK full disclousure: I baked this bread in the oven instead of the bread machine. But, my problems with the recipe aren't related to the baking. Overall I was disapointed with the flavor expecially since everyone compared it to the bread at Macaroni Grill, which is awesome. I don't know, maybe it was just not enough herbs? Or fresh would have been better? I felt like it just could have had more flavor. All the ingredient amounts and everything worked fine, so 3 stars for that. I could see this as being a nice bread for sandiches if I ate meat, but since I don't...I prefer the Herbed Italian Loaf recipe from this site as a nice bread to dip with olive oil and black pepper. But thank you for the recipe; it definitely still got eaten up!

I'm now making my fourth batch of this in 2 weeks. I make it into short "baguette" type loaves and use it for subs. It's perfect. I'm a little afraid of overpowering with rosemary so I add less than a full T. Going to try experimenting with some different herbs next time. YUM.

This bread was wonderful! I made it by hand instead of in the bread machine and then baked it in a 9" cake pan (so that there was more crust surface area) at 375 until it was brown. When it came out and was still hot I poked a few holes in the top with a toothpick and then brushed butter over the top and sprinkled a little kosher salt over that. YUMMY!

My family liked this recipe.  I did change to add milk instead of water and I used fresh rosemary.  The crust was great using the milk.  Overall, it was very good, I would keep using milk, but next time I will use dry rosemary.

Very delicious, flavorful bread.  The top didn't get as crusty as I would like, so I will choose the medium crust option on my breadmaker next time (and there will be a next time).  Fabulous recipe.  Thank you!

This was really good. Even the kids liked it.  I used my bread machine. It has adjustments for various crust levels. I used the light setting. I should've used the medium crust. Its a wonderful bread.

excellent bread as written.  I did try it with 1 cup of whole wheat as another reviewer suggested and that was WAY too much whole wheat flour, the flavor of the herbs was lost.  Last time, I also added a few tsp of vital wheat gluten (some of the recipe exchange members recommended this) and it made for an excellent, tender texture.  Very good bread!!

This was fantastic!  I made it to go along with the Rosemary-Mushroom Chicken Soup from the latest Pillsbury cookbook, Budget Meals (I think).  I love what olive oil does to a bread and it was divine when dipped into the soup (and on it's own).  Excellent

Like this recipe needs another five star rating but I can't help it. This bread was so good. I've made it three times so for and it turns out great everytime. I use fresh rosemary and I double the amount of rosemary because my family just loves us some rosemary. :) I make this by hand and after it comes out of the oven I brush it with olive oil and sprinkle sea salt on the top.

I make this in the oven, as I don't care for the shape of bread machine loaves.  After punching down the first time, I sprinkle sea salt on the dough.  Gives just a little bit of punch.

EXCELLENT!!!  If you don't care for rosemary, then don't add the full amount (easy enough to do).  I add garlic powder. Tender inside, and wonderful crunchy crust (even in the bread machine!).

My family went crazy!  I had trouble getting them to eat anything else on the plate.  I made this recipe in my stand-up mixer, proofing the yeast first.  I added no extra flour and let the dough get kneaded on the hook for about 5 minutes on slow.  My kids came downstairs saying it smelled exactly like "Macaroni Grill"  and they were right!  The best dinner loaf I've made and is my go to recipe to accompany italian meals.

I thought this bread was just ok. I don't quite get all the hype. I baked it in the oven, even spritzed water in occasionally and the crust never browned as nicely as I had hoped. My bake time was longer than some others too. Flavorwise it was good, just not the bomb I had hoped for considering the ratings.

My friend asked me to make the bread for her daughter's wedding.  I brought her samples of several types and this was the one she picked.  If you want a recipe for an event that makes a great statement, this is it.  Everyone won't like it, but the ones who do will really like it.  It's been a real potluck pleaser too.  My teenager requested that I make some loaves for her cast party tonight.

I made this tonight to go with our soup. Two thumbs up! I didn't have anymore Italian seasoning on hand so I subed it with Creole seasonings. I don't think it made a big difference, because the Rosemary's such a main flavor. I will be making again. Not to soon, because with homemade bread we usually eat the whole thing in a one sitting. I like the idea of the dinner rolls.

Very good and easy to make. I did the same as another reviewer, once I took it out of the oven I brushed it with olive oil and sprinkled it with course salt.  AHHH So good, My husband just loved it.  Will make this all the time.

This was good and really easy to make in the bread machine.  I didn't have fresh rosemary on hand so I used dried.  I think it would be better with fresh.  We dipped ours in garlic infused olive oil.

I made this in my Pillsbury Bread & Dough Maker. White bread, medium crust setting. It's so good! I cut back at a bit on rosemary and added some basil, which I love. Worked just fine and probably would've been fine with the regular amounts. It does depends on how strong your spices are. Keep that in mind!

I changed the spices as follows: 2 tsp powder garlic, 1/2 tsp basil, 1/4 tsp oregano and 1 inch of fresh rosemary chopped fine.  After 2nd rise, brushed top with olive oil and sprinkled with course salt.  Dipped in olive oil/balsamic vinegar.  AMAZING!

Excellent!  I also followed others advice and baked in the oven after the breadmachine does everything else.  Bake at 375 degrees for 20 minutes and 425 for 10 minutes.  I brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with seasoned sea salt! I followed the recipe as far as ingredients and did not think it was too much rosemary!  Perfect recipe and will make again and again!  thanks!

This bread looks, smells and tastes wonderful!  I didn't have any Italian seasonings on hand so I substituted oregano and onion powder.  Other than that I followed the recipe's ingredients.  The recipe calls for 2-1/2 cups of bread flour and that fell between my machine's 1 and 1.5 pound loaf.  I set the machine up for a 1 pound loaf and it worked just fine.

Fabulous!  One word says it all!  I'm not sure if I did something wrong (after review of the recipe, I don't think I did) but my loaf came out a bit small for 12 servings.  However, it was perfect for 2 people to share without too much as leftover!  Definately will make this again! Thanks for a wonderfully yummy and easy bread!

I am new to baking bread with a bread machine.  I just got one for Christmas!  I have already made this recipe twice.  It was a huge hit when we had friends over.  It is very similar to the bread at the Macaroni Grill.  I did make a few changes to the recipe (I also added basil, cilantro, and some garlic powder).  I did as another reviewer suggested which was to add olive oil and sea salt on the top of the loaf of bread as soon as it comes out of the bread machine.  Very good!  I will make this again!  My husband is already wanting me to make the next loaf even though we have not yet finished the last one (need to buy more fresh herbs - rosemary, basil, cilantro).

Yup, just like everyone says, this bread tastes exactly like the Macaroni Grill bread.  I dip mine in olive oil and vinegar and add some of the italian herbs I used in the bread. MMM good.

I made this using wheat flour & it turned out great too.  It was heartier, but a bit dryer (any suggestions?). Definitely still yummy for dipping in oil!

This bread is AMAZING.  I just got a bread machine and this was my inaugural recipe.  At this time, I did not have 'white' sugar and used my usual turbinado (RAW brand sugar).  The bread was so delicious.  Since the first time I have used regular white sugar as well and cannot tell any distinct difference.  The aroma of this bread fills my house and wherever I gift it :0) This bread isn't like Macaroni Grill's....it's BETTER! (and I am a big fan of their bread!!)

This turned out really good. I think I ate half of the loaf myself!I proofed first with 1 cup warm water, olive oil, and sugar. Then mixed in about 2  3/4 cups breadflour with my KitchenAid. I chopped 2 tsp. fresh rosemary, 2 sprigs fresh thyme with the stem removed, 1/4 tsp dried oregano (because that was what I had on hand) and mixed this with the 1 1/2 tsp. salt and added this in last to the dough mixture. After first rising, I formed a round loaf on a baking sheet, and then topped the lo

Yum!  I added 1 tsp of fresh rosemary from the garden and that was ALMOST too much.  Next time maybe a 1/4 tsp less.  I added a 1/4 cup of roughly chopped olives and out came a super savory loaf.  Will definitely do this one again.  thank you!

I thought this bread turned out good. I did omit the oil and used milk like someone else did. The only thing was it didn't have real flavor at all.

Thanks for sharing this recipe! It is awesome. I did exactly as you said only I used half white bread flour mixed with half wheat flour. I even made a sandwich out of it. Yummy! And toast for breakfast! Yummy again!!

Excellent!  I've made 3 loaves this weekend to take to a gathering:) I didn't have bread flour so used regular all purpose and it seemed to require about 2 3/4 c. to work.  This has been added as a favorite...thank you!

I have been using my bread machine for years, but I think this is probably the best bread it has ever produced!  I loved it.  I served with olive oil & fresh ground black pepper for dipping (as someone else suggested), and it even pleased my picky husband.  I will make again & again!

I think I added a little bit too much salt, but I added mint as well, and this is the fluffiest, most delicious bread I have ever made with my bread machine. The crust has a perfect crunch, too! I set mine to large light, and it did perfectly. I'm not sure it'll be around to see my other roommate's return in two days.

Excellent bread if you enjoy the flavor or Rosemary.  (I do)  You do not need a bread machine for this.  (Someone else posted instructions how to do this) Came out great!

My family loves this bread.  I always have to make it twice.  My husband loves the recipe as it is, but my daughter doesn't care for the herbs so I make one with and one without.

It came out looking very pretty with a nice golden crust.  However, the loaf was a little dense and very salty.  I think I will need to make croutons out of it.  Next time I will probably add milk and def. less salt.

I don't usually do reviews but this bread was so good and easy I have to give Jo kudos.  I put less rosemary as someone else suggested and my husband loves it.  We finally found a substitute for the old Buitoni Focaccia Bread mix.  Actually this is better than that!

I make this bread at least once a week. It's wonderful, and so easy to make. I grew rosemary in my garden this summer just so that I could use it for this bread. Some people said the rosemary flavor was overpowering, but I eat this bread with soups and chowders, toning down the strength a bit. I frequently give this bread to friends, who always ask me for the recipe. Make this bread at least once!

Absulotely amazing! I made a slight variation...I added 1/3 cup finely chopped sun dried tomatoes and 1/3 cup dry milk...and my loaf ended up tasting better than Panera Bread's similar bread. Good recipe. Will definitely make more of this!

I have used this recipe several times now, and it comes out perfect every time!  I recommend brushing it with olive oil and putting it in the oven for about 5-10 minutes - makes the crust even crispier!

Delicious, fragrant bread. I've made it twice now, with excellent results and rave reviews from my family! I usually have a hard time thinking what to do with leftover bread, but with this recipe, there's never a crumb left.

If it wasn’t for their chicken cannelloni, I could stop frequenting Macaroni Grill. Reviewers are not joking, this is it!
I used milk in place of water and will try water next time just to see what the difference is. Either way, it is tasty! After it was finished baking, I brushed with a combination of extra virgin olive oil and table salt. Use the light crust setting (medium makes the crust too thick). Some stated the bread was too salty. Make sure you are using Italian seasoning from the spice section and not the powdered salad dressing mix which contains additional salt. Thank you Jo!

I doubled the size of the loaf, thinking it would be too small for my 2 lb bread machine.  Well, perhaps it would be, but doubling wasn't the way to go, bc it rose too high and deflated.  However, good flavor and nice consistency, so a good recipe.  I'll make it as written next time.  Thanks!

I have made this bread twice now, and it has come out great both times. I used pizza seasoning (same difference as Italian seasoning) and fresh rosemary. This time, I also sprinkled sea salt on the bread right before it started baking - delicious!

This bread is glorious.  I used the dough setting on my bread machine, and it made a lovely round loaf of fragrant bread.  I omitted the black pepper and never missed it.  I will be making this frequently.

This tastes so much like the dipping bread at Old Venice Pizza Co. and at Macaroni Grill.  This is great with soup or as an appetizer with olive oil, parmesan, freshly ground black pepper and garlic.  Yum!

I followed this recipe to at "T" and was thrilled with the results! I will definitely be making it again in the future. I brushed olive oil on the loaves after taking them out of the oven--a step I will repeat in the future. Try this recipe--you'll love it!

Wonderful bread. I added some dried basil and used milk instead of the water. Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband made this in our bread machine, and boy, was it delicious!  He said it was easy to make, and tastes very similar to my FAVORITE restaurant bread that you break apart and dip.

To die for! We love this bread! Great with some home made mac n cheese and a veggi. 
I make this by hand. First proofing the yeast and I use 1 cup milk for a softer crust. Yummy with a little bit of butter~

The rosemary taste was a little too strong for me. Next time i'll use a little less or use fresh instead of dried.

I made the dough in the bread machine and then removed it to shape, rise and bake.  This is just a great recipe.  My kids dip this in olive oil/balsalmic vinegar.  It is so good!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yum yum yum. This really is a terrific bread. I make the dough in the bread machine and then bake it (after letting it rise again) on a baking stone.

This recipe was very goo overall. I didn't like making it in the Bread Machine though...next time i will make it by hand and in the oven...bread just tastes better to me that way. Overall it was a very goo recipe. I found it best to put butter on the bread and toast it up in a cast iron skillet till nice and brown....then dip it in olive oil...yummmm

This bread is DELICIOUS!!!  I don't have a bread machine, so I made it the semi-old fashioned way with my kitchen aid mixer.  I was out of olive oil - used regular Crisco oil.  Still turned out fantastic.  Wonderful texture, and the flavor is outstanding.  Next time I'll use olive oil.  I can't imagine it could get any better, but it's worth a try.  Thanks for sharing.  This one is a keeper for sure!

This was really easy and quite good. My husband loved it. I think that it would have been better if I had a different brand of olive oil. The one I had was kind of bitter.

I rated this a 3 because I did not like the taste.  I believe it is a personal preference and I guess I just don't like Rosemary!  But, my sig. other loved the taste, and thought it was very good!

I really didn't like this bread. It was too dry for my liking and I decided after making it the rosemary is definitely not one of my favorite herbs. It's ok with chicken but I don't like it in a bread. I gave 3 stars because the flavor was pretty good IF you like rosemary and with a little more oil/water the bread wouldn't be so dry.

Very flavorful.I was a little worried at first because my bread did not rise very much, and I had made 2 different recipes along with this one at the same time, and those did just fine. Anyways.... When I cut into the bread, it was very soft and so flavorful.

Yummy! I am baking a lot of bread and I always come back to this recipe, it's so good.  I usually omit the rosemary and just use more of the Italian seasoning instead and I put a bit more black pepper in. This bread ROCKS!!!!

This bread was delicious! I used fresh rosemary from my herb garden. Will definitely make again.

I made this in my bread machine and  took this to a last minute jewelry party (having never made it) and it was the hit of the party - everyone took some home and there was none left just hours later - this is fantastic (even though I ran out of rosemary and only used half of the amount suggested).

LOVED this bread!  It made a smallish loaf, but it was moist and full of flavor.  It's great toasted with butter the next day too.

This is the best bread I made since I got the bread machine. I made this a 2-pound loaf and it's fantastic: great flavor, great crumb. I'd eat the whole loaf myself...

Very moist and tasty!  Super soft too.  I had some garlic olive oil, which I used in place of the regular olive oil and I was out of italian seasoning, so I used Tastefully Simple's Italian Seasoning.  Came out delicious!  Definitely a keeper!

This was every bit as good as the reviews promised! I baked it in the bread machine, but next time I think I'll turn it out and do 2 smaller loaves in the oven (so I can freeze one).  Also, my machine doesn't make great crust, and this would be even better with a good crust on it.  Five stars and a "make again" for sure!

I made this with @2 tbsp fresh rosemary from my garden, and it can't be beat.  What a terrific recipe!  My inlaws were visiting and no one could stop eating the bread, the entire loaf was gone in no time at all.

Delicious, though the bread is rather dense, almost the density of a focaccia in loaf form. Fantastic with dinner, maybe a little too heavy for sandwiches.

My husband and I thought this bread tasted a lot like the peasant bread at Romano's Macaroni Grill--minus the oil and rock salt.  It was excellent.  We're so excited to add this recipe to our collection and use it over and over.  Whatta gem!

Target sells a Rosemary and Olive Oil bread that I love to make paninis with or serve with pasta.  My boyfriend suggested I find a recipe for it and this is it!!  This was exactly what I was looking for!!  The only thing is that the bread machine didn't produced the crust I was looking for, but this fixable.  I made the bread and served it with 'Rich and Creamy Tomato Basil Soup' also found on this site and it was fabulous!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This bread turned out very nicely.  I used fresh rosemary and garlic.  It has a lot of flavor.  I only used a teaspoon of salt and it turned out great!

A family favorite!  I like to use cracked fresh pepper in the recipe.  It adds even more zing along with the olive oil.  Delicious and fragrant.

This was pretty good, but not fabulous.  I would use less olive oil or better quality than what I used (the olive oil taste was too strong).

I got rave reviews for this bread!!  I used 2 tablespoons of fresh rosemary instead of dried (because I didn't want it to go to waste).  It was so easy and very good!

This was sooo good....  To me it tasted like the bread you get in a restaurant AFTER it's been dipped in the yummy oil and seasonings.  I bought the garlic flavored olive oil to dip it in...  Good stuff!

really good bread. next time i will put crust info on dark.  it came out a bit to light for our taste. but good. i use splenda for the sugar, that may be the reason for the light color.
