Ridiculously easy and great recipe!   The only change I made is I added an onion into the pressure cooker with the rest of the ingredients.   We both loved this and we will make again!   Winner winner chicken dinner!

This was fantastic! I used frozen chicken and it still came out cooked perfectly. I used homemade salsa, which was a bit runny. So while the chicken cooled instead of the keep warm setting, I used the saut√© function and it reduced the liquid. This is a definite keeper recipe.
