We made this for Christmas dinner.  I never even tasted rabbit before, but my 80 year old father-in-law loves it, so we made this for him.  Talk about nervous breakdowns: cooking a meat you never ate yourself, that was not available for a trial run.  The morel mushrooms were prohibitively expensive.  White asparagus were not available anywhere.  Had to mesh this with my individual Beef Wellington recipe to an extent. We used boneless rabbit loins, as specified.  Had to use green asparagus, but blanched them in advance.  Used Crimini  mushrooms, sliced razor thin & cooked in butter, instead of oil (personal preference).  The rabbit loins were nothing like I thought they would be.  I was expecting a tube of meat, like a tenderloin, but they are like a big thin cut, rolled up.  We de-fatted them & rolled them back up tight.  Then followed the recipe as directed.  (I would NOT recommend this for anyone who is unfamiliar with working with puff pastry!!!)  I truly expected this to be horrible.  But the rabbit somehow plumped in the pastry & it was actually a magnificent dinner that got rave reviews from our entire family.  (One loin was more than enough for one person - doggie bags.)  Hints: The loins are large & a challenge to 1/4 sheet of puff pastry once asparagus & mushrooms are added.  If making 6 portions, divide the 2 sheets of puff pastry into 1/3's.  The demiglace could use more reduction - it was too thin.  Bake time longer than stated. Great meal Thank You, Chefbendiaz!
