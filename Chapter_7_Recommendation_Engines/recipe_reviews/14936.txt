These are awesome!!  My family just loves them.  If I'm running short on time I put them in the oven for 45 minutes then, throw them in the slow cooker until I'm ready for them.  They taste the same you just don't have to have them in the slow cooker all day.  Wonderful Recipe!!

I've made these at many a get-together & they are always a hit. For faster cooking, I bake them in the oven for an hour at 375 degrees. YUM!

This deserves way more stars than 5.  I made this for a superbowl party and the guys went CRAZY for it.  Taking into consideration what others said about them becoming soggy - I microwaved the bacon for a about 30/40 seconds, drained the grease. After wrapping, I baked them in the oven at 375 for 45 minutes. Then put them in the slowcooker on low just to keep them warm but they werent in there for long!  I also made a ketchup and brown sugar sauce for dipping them into - some went for this and some didn't.  But it was VERY YUMMY!!!!!

Made it for a potluck at work and everyone rant and raved about them.  You can also make them the day before and heat them up in the microwave.  For crisper bacon take the lid off on the last hour and turn the slow cooker up to high.

You can use cocktail weiners for this recipe and broil them on a cookie sheet for 5 minutes and they turn out great.

I made this last night for a poker party and it was a huge hit with the guys, there wasnt a single one left.
I used little smokies and maple flavored bacon and a light sprinkle of brown sugar, baked on a cookie sheet at 375 for about 45 minutes. The maple flavored bacon added just the perfect touch.

This was easy to make and very good.  My husband thought I was crazy making it, but he loved the end result.  I did hand roll each one in the brown sugar.  Mine didn't take very long to bake.

This is a great recipe. I make it for every Super Bowl party. Once, I had made about 100 of the little guys, and they were almost all gone by the middle of the first quarter - they're always a big hit. Mine differs in that I add ketchup to the brown sugar and bake in the oven.

Good recipe, came back from my party with only 3 left, we had lots of food so that was expected.  I did bake at 375 for 45" then put them in the slow cooker to keep them warm.  I also placed them in a large bowl before cooking and added the 1/2 cup of brown sugar then capped the bowl and shook them to assure good coverage.  Very tasty, will probably make them again.  I did use beef lil' smokies instead of hotdogs.

I would make it without the brown sugar and use pepper bacon.  Brown Sugar made it burn on the tray.

These are awesome, I haven't made them yet, but a friend of mine made them at a party, and my husband had about 30 of them! He asked me to go straight to the store and get the stuff to make them right away! They taste out of this world! They were cooked at 375 in the oven for about an hour, and we used apple smoked bacon. YUM!

I've made these twice, once with the brown sugar and once without.  I actually prefer them without, it just added a slight sweetness and I didn't think my kids needed the extra sugar.  Although I'm not sure who ate more, the kids or the adults!  Make sure you splurge and buy ALL BEEF hotdogs.  Very addicting.

Absolutley the best thing I have ever made for a party. People loved it and ask me to make them again and again. I do the crock pot and then into the oven for just 15-20min,to crisp it up. Awesome.

These were really good.  I baked them and then put them in the crock pot to keep warm.  They are very messy to clean up afterwards.  They are very unhealthy though, and I will make them only occasionally.

Very tasty when they are freshly made.  There not the best when they've sat in a slow cooker on warm for hours.  I recommend that they be eaten with in 3-4 hours of making them.

Were a huge hit at the BBQ I took them too. Followed what others said and left the top off for the last hour, and only did one layer so they all got cooked, I will try to cook more next time

A tasty but problematic recipe.  These were soooo yummy but UGLY UGLY UGLY!  They were so ugly in fact that we kept them for ourselves instead of bringing them to the party they were intented for.  2nd, you can't actually make enough for a party appetizer.  These only work well when cooked in a slow cooker in a single layer.  The ones on top didn't do well at all.  I have a very large slow cooker and could fit only 25 in a single layer, which isn't enough for a party.  Finally, it's very important - and another reviewer mentioned this as well - to leave the lidd off for about the last hour so the bacon won't be AS MUCH of a soggy mess.  But, no matter what, they'll still be ugly and soggy.  However, these were so very yummy and I will make them occasionally just as a treat for my husband and I, or if we have one or two people over.

Loved it! I use kielbasa instead. It didn't sound to appealing, but it has become a favorite. We now call this MEAT CANDY and everyone loves it, especially the men!

These did not turn out well for me at all.  I precooked the bacon a little so it didn't become soggey and that was a big mistake.  But even with precooking there was a lot of grease to deal with in the slow cooker and it clung to the hotdogs.  And the flavor of the hotdogs themselves was not good at all.  I'd suggest not precooking the bacon and maybe adding some BBQ Sauce.  I would try them again to recipe but it doesn't seem worth the work.

I will make this over and over. Thanks for the great recipe. The idea of removing the lid of crockpot for the last hour to crisp the bacon is a good one.

I make this recipe a little differently. I cut the hot dogs and bacon slices in half. Roll the hot dog with bacon and then roll in a dish of brown sugar. Place on jelly roll pan, repeat till all hot dogs are done. Cook in preheated 400* oven and cook for 10 minutes. This way the bacon is crisp but not burnt.

Made these for football Sunday. I used a little more brown sugar, given the size of my slow cooker, and I had to switch the temperature to the warm setting after less than 2 hours.  In the end, I cooked them for about 5 hours, 2 on low and 3 on warm. The bacon crisped up nicely on almost all of them. My husband and his buddies were big fans!

I have made these for years, but I called them "Pig Dogs".  Always a hit at every get together.  I always get requests to bring this dish, and it is so simple that I always comply.

The absolute best way to eat a hot dog. I always add shredded cheese on top. I won't eat a hot dog unless it is wrapped with bacon like this. My family loves this.

These are delicious and easy! I've made bacon wrapped hot dogs in the oven before, but never again, this is so much better. The only thing I'd suggest is giving it a good stir about an hour to an hour and a half before serving so the bacon-dogs on top can crisp up. I plan on making these for my gender-reveal party next week so the guys have something to snack on other than veggies and sandwiches. :P

I made these for my boyfriend and he really loved them (though remarked that they were extremely salty). I baked them for 30 minutes in the oven but will try the crock pot next time. Thank you for the recipe!

Mine didn't turn out so good, but then I used leftover pre-cooked hotdogs and stuck them in the oven instead of the slow cooker... still, my boyfriend ate about half of them.  They have a good flavor.

These little gems were fabulous!  My son (age 8) helped me make them for the Super Bowl.  They were simple to make and delicious to eat!  Definately will be making them again.

I think it is great but it's better when you use mini cabasa and cook it for 1 hour in the oven. It is a great food for an appetizer at any occasion, I love my version of the recipe!
