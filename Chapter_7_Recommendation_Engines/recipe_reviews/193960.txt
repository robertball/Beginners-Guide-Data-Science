In a word, FABULOUS! I've tried other horseradish dipping sauces on this site and this is by far the best! I would liken this more to of a spread/dip simply because it's just so versatile. I used reduced fat sour cream and Hellman's light mayo and this was oh so good! What's great about this is you can customize this to your tastes by adjusting the amounts of horseradish, garlic and dill - but no matter what you do it's bound to be delicious. I made this as a topping for some juicy burgers. I used the leftovers for some cut up veggies and my husband's sandwich for work. I can't wait to try this as on grilled steak sandwiches! Thanks for the great recipe ADZELL!

More a sauce than a spread, this blew everyone away at the dinner table tonight.  My gosh this was good!  I knew it was gonna be awesome right after I made it but of course it only got better after the flavors developed after several hours in the fridge. I might have used a little less pepper than called for since the horseradish I used really had a bite, but other than that I made no other changes, tho' I admit I didn't measure precisely.  I served this with our corned beef and cabbage dinner, but I sure woudn't limit it to just that!  This would also go well with prime rib, roast beef sandwiches, a dip for vegetables and quite possibly even on potatoes. We all SO enjoyed this that the bowl was scraped clean.  A truly unforgettable sauce/spread.

Quick, easy & UTTERLY DELICIOUS, exactly as written! I've made 3 batches in the past 24 hours!! At first I made it for 2 servings, unsure of horseradish. As soon as I finished that with a variety of crisp vegetable slices, I made a half-batch more so others could enjoy it. Today, I made a full recipe to have available for more vegetable sticks & whole grain crackers over the next few days. I can also see this as a sauce for steak, salmon, & a sandwich spread (especially roast beef or cucumber sandwiches). Highly recommended! ~~~ UPDATED Feb. 2010: I've made this numerous times since, but with fresh dill, extra raw garlic & extra horseradish. It received rave reviews from everyone at the Super Bowl party. The women especially loved the healthy vegs & whole grain crackers with it. I also tried it as a spread for a prime rib sandwich ~ terrific! ~~~ LOWER FAT : Altho' perfect as is, I made it with 1/3-1/2 whole milk yogurt & the usual fresh dill, extra raw garlic & extra horseradish - it was as creamy~delicious as always, so that's how I'll make it from now on.

Gosh this was so delicious I wanted to try it on everything.  Even my ex would seem a little more palatable if dipped properly in this.

I made this to serve with beef tenderloin.  I used 2 tablespoons of horeseradish and a full teaspoon of dill because I like a stronger flavor, but my family LOVED it.  It was far more delicious than the horseradish dill sauce we previously used.

Try this as a little fork dip when having a nice rare piece of Prime Rib.  it is heavenly,  accents the beef perfectly. Very good, have made one similar.  Making my mouth water for a prime rib already.   Or any fine cut of meat. Ummmm give it a shot with steamed shrimp also....

I made this the Saturday evening before Father's Day. I was planning on tossing it in the cooler along with veggies for a snack at the lake on Sunday. By 11:00 Saturday night it was gone! Can you say "make a double batch!"? I made it again on Tuesday and used it in tortilla roll ups with pastrami. YUMMY

I tried this with beef and as a veggie dip, and enjoyed it more with the beef.  I also mixed 1/2 cup of the spread with the hard-boiled yolks from 12 eggs to make deviled eggs and everyone loved them.

This recipe could not have been more perfect for any beef dish you serve! I  used the sauce for my cheeseburger tonight for dinner. I made it exactly and was NOT dissapointed! This would be good on salmon too! I just thought of that one:) This ROCKS!! Thank you ADZELL for a very tasty sauce. Patty

Exactly what I was looking for! Creamy with just enough bite. I used for French Dip sandwiches, it was the perfect complement. And best of all it takes about two minutes to throw together, with ingredients I always have on hand.

This is a delicious and simple recipe to throw together. I generally have all the ingredients on hand. I made it as a dip for crackers and veggies, but it has me wanting to grill some beef to dip in it! Thanks, Adzell, for a keeper! I will definitely make this again!

What is the point of rating recipes that we change? Silly. But here I am doing it! I couldn't pass up telling you that I wanted to make this horseradish spread but, unbeknownst to me, I was out of horseradish! I had to do something in a pinch - so I substituted chopped (in a jar) jalapeno! My husband couldn't stop raving about it! He hates horseradish and never adds anything to beef but he almost finished the whole bowl by himself. I put about a teaspoon of the chopped jalapenos and another teaspoon of just the juice. It was fantastic. (The rest of the recipe was the same). OH - but I did use light sour cream and light mayo (not low fat). Outstanding. Can't wait to make it again.

I made this recipe exactly as written, EXCEPT...I substituted 4oz cream cheese for the sour cream. I needed something to bring to a party, and as I went a little overboard with the buy-one-get one free deli roast beef the other day, I was trying to think of a way to use some of it up. I thought the flavors in this recipe would also make a good cheese spread so I tried it.  It was awesome!!!  I let the flavors mellow overnight in the fridge, then spread the mixture on some original flavored melba toasts. I topped each with a folded slice of deli roast beef, sprinkled a pinch of grated parmesan cheese and a few fresh chives on top to make them pretty, and put them on a platter.  They were absolutely delicious - mine was the only empty plate at the end of the night. The balance of flavors is delicate and just right. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! Can't wait to try the sour cream version with beef tenderloin.

This is really, really yummy! The  horseradish makes this spread extra  special. It has a light and refreshing flavor. I've only tried it with veggies, but I think it would be good with grilled pork.

Not horseradishy enough.  Not thick enough for a good spread.  Fixed with more seasoning, lots more horseradish and a TON of corn starch.

I have been trying to make the "best" horseradish sauce for years.  Really like it on beef sandwiches.  This recipe does all that I want it to do, except, I would leave out the dill for beef preps.  Otherwise would go great with seafood and maybe chicken.

I served this with grilled Roumanian skirt steak this weekend and we all loved it.  We have since enjoyed it with crudites and my daughter put it on her salad.  The only thing I may do differently the next time I make it (and there will be a next time, it has already been requested for our 4th of July barbecue)is eliminate the minced garlic and increase the garlic powder a bit.  I minced it very fine, but you still came across little bursts of garlic as you ate.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

OUTSTANDING!! This recipe should also be listed as a sauce because when served with beef it's better than any horseradish sauce I have been served in even the fanciest restaurants! We made this for Christmas to serve along side a beef tenderloin and it was a huge hit. Followed the recipe except omited the vinnegar and used 2 Tbsp. Of horseradish because we like it spicy! I will make this again and again, it rocks!!

I just made this to go with my lunch and it was absolutely the best horseradish sauce I've ever had, even without the changes I made.  I like my flavors a bit stronger so I added a bit more horseradish, dill and garlic powder after trying it as made per the instructions.  Either way, awesome!  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  Store bought?  Never again!

This was great. I used it as a horsey sauce for a roast beef stuffed shells dish and my husband raved. I was able to make just what I needed and not have to buy a whole jar using ingredients that I already had on hand. Thanks for the great recipe!

SO GOOD! I don't use this as a spread, but rather as a dip for prime rib. It's the perfect amount of creaminess with the horseradish.

This is a great all purpose dip that blends the flavors of garlic, dill, and horseradish.  It can be used for veggies, roast beef, and my personal favorite, salmon.

Incredible! I served this dip with yellow squash patties  and wound up dipping all of my food into it it was so good! I didn't use any mayo, don't like it so used all sour cream. Also didn't use the garlic powder just put a little bit extra minced garlic in. Thanks SOOOO much for the recipe:)

Very good. I used FF sour fream and reduced fat mayo. I used this with the soft tacos I made with the leftover Slow Cooker Carnitas(mine was on a bed of sauteed onions and peppers) and I didn't even miss the fat. My husband and kids liked it, too. Thank you for sharing this.

I had a vision of a horseradish sauce for a beef sandwich and decided to try this one. I don't think my beef sandwich will ever be the same. It was awesome!

Wonderful sauce!  We served this with prime rib to our dinner guests tonight, and everyone raved about it.  So quick to throw together too.  Whipped this up in about 5 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  I made it for a my husband's roast beef sandwich.  He really enjoyed it.  I tasted it too and liked it as well.  A welcome change to the usual mayo.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was serving spaghetti with "The Best Meatballs You'll Ever Have"  by BEARNESTA and a mixed spring greens salad with "My Grandmother's French Dressing" by JIMBOWERS (both found on this site).  I was SURE I had some garlic bread or rolls in my freezer.  WRONG!  So i searched the site for garlic spread when I happened upon this FABULOUS recipe.  Served with "Townhouse (TM) crackers and bagel chips along with the salad.  It got rave reviews!  So simple to make, and quick!  I had everything on hand.  This will be a staple for "Card night" etc.  Thanks for the recipe!

What a wonderful sauce for sandwiches. For our taste a bit more dill and horseradish was desired, however not a reason to give this a low rating...everybody has their own taste preference. We served with roast beef sandwiches, topped with some cucumbers, tomatoes and avocados. I did make this a couple hours before serving and was certainly much more flavorful, however licking the spoon right afterwards it was delish also.

Made this for Christmas to go with kabobs.  Not as popular with my family as several of the other dips.  Will probably not make this again.

Excellent recipe!  I doubled the sour cream (I may try yogurt next time instead) & may try 4 Tablespoons prepared horseradish, 1/2 teaspoons each of the dill weed & garlic powder but I will make this again!

I used "light real mayo" and creamy horseradish sauce.  I thought this was going to be to spicy but it was just right.  I made this 3-4 days ago and just let it sit in the fridge.  Ate this today with my pastrami and rye bread sandwich.  This would also be great as a veggie dip.

While I haven't tried this dip on anything just yet, I'm making it as a topper to my non-trad Thanksgiving Day french dips.  I stuck my finger in it right after making it and it was yummy!  I can't wait to add the roast beef, au jus and provolone to it!   Additionally, at Easter we always have ham and mix horseradish and mayo together.  I think I'll have to try this instead! Thanks for posting!

So good!  I added a little more horseradish because we like it kind of hot.  Also, I had no white pepper and it was fine.  I used this as dressing on some cold pork roast sandwiches and as a dipping sauce for fresh vegetables. Fabulous both ways!  My boyfriend even said it was better than his moms.  He's never said that before so that's really saying something!  Thanks.

Very yummy. It would be a 5 if I didn't have another recipe that I like a little better. But this one is easy and made with ingredients that are usually around. I personally prefer a bit more horseradish.  Thanks!

I just made this to be used on steak sandwiches....i can't imagine how much better this can get! I am certain the flavors will improve even more after some time in the fridge, but it's already perfect for what I needed! If you want more horsey flavor, add more horseradish! I like it as-is since it's for a catering event...I don't want to blow people away or have them worry about their breath (which is why I omitted the garlic clove). Yum!

Wow!  This stuff is great.  I'm still looking for new things to try this on.  We had it on roast beef sandwiches first and it was wonderful.  We have since dipped chips, veggies, and beef kabobs in it.  We haven't found anything that this does not taste good on.  The second time I made it I used the extra hot horseradish and I thought it really just put it over the top.

Didn't realize until I started to make this that this is a dip I have making for years only with a bit more dill. It is so good to have on hand and versatile to use on just about anything. Great recipe to have on hand in the fridge!

Easy recipe and went perfect with my rib roast.  My kids even liked it!  I had one very minor change I had to make. I did not have any dill on hand and therefore did not add, however, I did not miss it. This version is light on the horseradish, so for you hotheads this is a milder sauce.  Thank you for sharing.

Wow. So tasty. Made it to go w/corned beef and cabbage last night as suggested by a reviewer of the corned beef. So glad I did. Fabulous, easy, quick. And it was all gone by the end of dinner. Ever since, I've been fantasizing about slathering it on a roast beef sandwich. Heavenly. Thanks for a great recipe.

Wish I could give more stars.  Used non-fat yogurt instead of sour cream to lower fat.  We're going to use tonight on venison filet mignon and I'm thawing out a Corned Venison (on this website) to cook for lunches during the week.  According to the rave reviews, I made a double batch...and am glad I did.  FIRST CLASS!!!!

Awesome!  Served with lonwolf32’s Easy Slow Cooker French Dip sandwiches
I gave them a generous smear of this and served with ramekin of au jus for dipping.  The contrast of the zesty, cold horseradish spread with the hot meat and au jus was absolutely delicious!

This is really good!  I used roasted garlic (cause I always have that) and greek yogurt instead of sour cream (cause I always have that too).  I'm thinking of adding chicken and cucumbers to it to make chicken salad. That would be yummy!

I love horseradish and so does my boyfriend. We had friends over for a prime rib christmas dinner earlier in the week and I made this to accompany it. I did put 3 tablespoons of atomic horseradish, we very much like our horseradish so this may be way too much for others! Will definently make this again

This recipe is very good.  I like the fact there isn't too much dill, just enough to mingle with the other flavors.  I did have to double the horseradish for our tastes, but we like a lot of horseradish so I wouldn't recommend that for everyone.  My husband says it tastes just like the sauce at a restaurant he likes in Granger,In.  We are serving it up with a grilled rib roast tonight if there is any left by that time!

This is good!  I made this the day before to let the flavors blend and develop.  I followed the instructions without changing anything.  I made this to serve with our St. Pat's Day Corned Beef dinner. Everyone agreed this was good. I will be making this again.

This is really good and if you leave out the horseradish it taste just like hidden valley ranch dip.  With or without the horseradish, its a keeper.

Yum! I loved the fluffy/creamy texture of this. I amped the horseradish and pepper just a little because I'm a fiend, but it's also awesome as written. I used this on rib eye steaks the first day, and made roast beef and cucumber appetizers with it the second - both were excellent. Thanks for the recipe!

I did not have white pepper so I used the same amount of black pepper. Except for that, I followed the recipe. We ate this with the slow cooker corned beef & cabbage recipe from this site. I will make this again, but for our taste I will add more horseradish & garlic. Thank you for the recipe.

Very easy to make. Made a half recipe and used it as a topping on a roast beef sandwich, then, opps, dipped a potato chip in it and before we knew it, that half recipe disappeared. Delish! Followed the recipe as is.

I loved this sauce!!  I used 1/2 and 1/2 sour cream and plain yogurt, doubled the dill and  doubled the horseradish.  I will make this again!  The consistency made it a terrific spread, add a couple drops of milk and it would be a stellar dip.

I made this as a side dip/sauce for my slow cooker corned beef that I prepared for St. Patrick's Day. This was right on point! Thanks for sharing this with the world!

Great recipe, the only change for me was subbing out the garlic powder and added another clove of the fresh, minced garlic.

Next time, I might try using a greek style yogurt in the place of the sour cream for a thinker end product.

LOVED THIS!  As another reviewer did, I served this with Corned Beef and Cabbage dinner (by LUSYRSGIRL). It was a huge hit! This could be used for anything! I did not have white pepper so omitted that. I had fresh dill not dry so microwaved that in paper towels at 50% power for a minute and used that cut up. I also doubled the recipe. Will be making this again and again! Thank you!!!!!

The big guy and I loved this sauce.  The only change I made was to increase the amount of horseradish to our taste, we love horseradish so I increased the amount by 2.5 times.  The sauce was refrigerated for over 4 hours before using and that allowed the garlic and herbs to infuse thoroughly.  This was excellent on our St Patrick's Day corned beef brisket. It would also be amazing on roast beef, fish or shrimp.  Super simple to make and uses simple ingredients.

WOWIE ZOWIE! I decided to make this and try it on some cheesesteak sandwiches. It made the sandwiches sing...LAAAAAA! Really really good stuff. I didn't have dill (and who cares about white pepper?) but threw it all in a bowl, let it sit a half hour and then slathered up the sandwiches. Oh and we dipped our fries in it too! We ate the whole bowl of sauce in one night. (Hubby says "is this hard to make?" As in hint hint "can you make more??") Great recipe, thanks!!

This is so good! We love horseradish so I went heavy handed on that as well as the dill :) I wasn't sure it would go with corned beef and cabbage but it was delicious and now I have to make this every time I make the corned beef and cabbage recipe in crockpot on this site as well. The crockpot recipe is the only way to make corned beef and cabbage. Try this spread you won't be dissapointed

Delicious!
I put this on corned beef sandwiches on Pepperidge Farm marble rye with provolone and it was outstanding!  You can adjust the horseradish if you like a lot of it, but this was perfect for me as-is.
I could see putting this on any number of sandwich combinations.
Definitely do as the recipe indicates and make it a day or two ahead.  It needs time for the flavors to marry and to thicken up a bit.

I found this recipe through reviewers from the slowcooker corned beef recipe, and i'm glad i did. Hubs (who swears he's a better cook than me, lol) absolutely loved it. I made it this morning and by the time my dinner was ready the flavours had melded nicely. Hubs even said it could do with a touch more horseradish after sitting that long in the fridge, and he's not into spicy food. Can't wait to try it as a spread tomorrow on corned beef sammiches! Thank you!

I made this to accompany fried zucchini and it was fantastic!  It also went well with a grilled sirloin and as a baked potato topper.  After making this a couple of times, I've decided to nix the white pepper altogether and increase the amount of horseradish.  Plus going forward I'll only use an increased amount of garlic powder instead of both fresh minced garlic and garlic powder.  I've learned that while I love garlic, I'm not a huge fan of raw garlic.

Omg. I'm sorry I found this recipe. Made it as is and it was delish. Made another batch an added more Horseradish to give it a bit more of a kick and it was still delish. Had with with corned beef,  prime rib, ribbye steak, salmon, and even dipped kettle chips in it. Love this.

Yum!  I made this to go with the Slow Cooker Corned Beef and Cabbage meal tonight from this site (it is St. Patricks Day!).  I have a similar recipe to this that goes with a Pork Roast, and it would be great with Prime Rib or as a Veggie Dip.  BTW I skipped the raw garlic and just used garlic powder and it was still great.

YUMMO is the word. I am so happy I took the time to go get all the spices recommended especially the fresh dill weed. This is a keeper I will use from now on. My son-in-law loves it on his baked potato instead of sour cream. Thanks for sharing. This one knocked it out of the park.

YUM!  I added a little bit more horseradish (used the hot variety).  I didn't have dill weed but  put in a little juice from relish and it tasted delish.  I could put this on everything!

Absolutely delicious! It made the meal of corned beef and cabbage! Very tasty and zesty! I did use low fat sour cream and low fat mayonnaise and it still tasted so good! It could be used on a sandwich, in a hot meal, on anything! Thank you so much, ADZELL for sharing!

Delicious! I'll be letting it sit for a day or so to let the flavors blend. I did sub plain non-fat Greek yogurt for the the sour cream, which I do frequently. It was a bit tart so I also added a tsp or so of white sugar which helped cut the tang. I look forward to using this as a sandwich spread, a veggie dip, or with meats. Thanks for a great recipe, ADZELL!

I followed the recipes pretty closely. I used 1 1/2 Tbsp prepared horseradish. I thought the sauce was good, but next time I make it I will use at least 2 Tbsp horseradish and possibly reduce the amount of sour cream and mayo. I was wanting something a little spicier for my french dip sandwiches. I will definitely make it again, but will add more horseradish.

This was an exceptionally exceptional sauce, and I can imagine how versatile it is. Had it with the Corned beef last night, and it was the perfect accompaniment. Tomorrow we'll have salmon, and it'll be great with that. Heck, it would be great with fried fish too.....or just by the spoonful! [I tripled the horseradish, for the extra 'zing']

Had it today, as written, with corned beef and cabbage. It was made for it! Absolutely made the meal perfect! I can't wait to try it with other dishes.

Fantastic! I'm waiting for the family to get home to try it out on our corned beef dinner tonight. This is a recipe I'm sure I will use again, there are so many possibilities to use as an accompaniment. I do something similar as a warm sauce for polenta and pasta, but I add Parmesan, sauteed shallots and white wine. This recipe is perfection as is however, as a spread. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for the first time today to go with the corned beef dinner that I am preparing for tonight.  I followed the recipe as written.  It has been "aging" in the refrigerator for about 1.5 hours and I just tasted it and it is great!  I believe this recipe would also lend itself well to tweaking the level of horseradish for those who like a little more/a little less h-radish heat.  Thanks for the recipe!

This will be my go-to horseradish recipe from now on...there's no need to look any further.  We like things hot, spicy and extra "horsey", so I added an additional tablespoon of horseradish...DELISH!

So good!  I left out the white pepper (didn't have any)  and used 2 cloves garlic through a press then omitted the garlic powder.  Makes a perfect quantity for just one or two people.  I'm just one so tried it first on celery sticks and potato chips during the Super Bowl and then spreading on a baked salmon filet.  A little dab left over this morning was just right for more chips.  Thanks!

**EDIT:  I made this again and I had to change my rating to 5 stars.  This is really, really good on sandwiches made with leftover roast beef!!  I'll be making this again and again!  Thank you!  ** EDIT**



Just ok as far as my tastes but I gave it a 4 star rating as my son really enjoyed it.  I doubled the horseradish and garlic, used a full tsp of the dill.

Excellent dip. I was out of sour cream so I used low-fat yogurt and it was great. I can't imagine how delicious it would be with sour cream though. I added a little more horseradish because I enjoy the extra kick.

I used this as a sandwich spread with roast beef and swiss. The adults loved it, the kids hated it. But they think McDonald's tastes great, so take their critique with a grain of salt that fell of a Mickey D's french fry!! It has the right amount of tang and has a bite that catches your attention. It make the roast beef taste even better!! I actually used a bigger dollop of horseradish but it could easily be adjusted to whatever your taste buds like. Well done Adzell!!

This stuff is awesome! I did add an extra teaspoon of horseradish, because I wanted more of that flavor. And maybe the horseradish I bought was a little milder.  I did avoid buying the "extra hot" variety. I made this for tempeh mushroom sandwiches and it a new favorite! Could be used for so many different things! Thank you!

Followed exactly except I added chopped chives to the mix. I thought it was good, but bf complained it didn't go well with the steaks and that horseradish only goes with fish. Go figure.

I thought this was great.  Just the right flavor and kick.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, thought it wasn't strong enough.  He loves hot and strongly flavored foods.  Over all it is a good recipe thought.  Guess I'll have to make it with stronger horseradish.

I made this for sandwiches for my husband's lunch and he gave it a 4 but he likes Barefoot Contessa's Mustard Horseradish Sauce better. I followed the recipe except I only used fresh garlic and no garlic powder. He thought it would be better served on the side of steak.

I used mild horseradish and would recommend using extra hot for meats.  The mild tasted a little bit like ranch dressing with a zip. It does taste good as a vegi and chip dip.  I added extra hot and that seemed to go well with the meat I served tonight.  Good either way!
