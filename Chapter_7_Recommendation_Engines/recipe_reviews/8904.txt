This was really easy and good! Instead of a whole chicken, I used just shy of a pound of boneless, skinless breasts cut into strips. I laid the strips over the sliced onion and only sprinkled a little bit of salt on them, not the full 1/2 tsp. They needed 45 minutes to cook, and then I drained what liquid was left and added the sauce. The sauce I doubled from the way it is listed (so, doubled twice from scaling down the chicken amount) I didn't have tomato paste so I used ketchup and omited the extra salt. I also used dehydrated celery flakes instead of celery salt. I added around 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. Since the sauce wasn't that thick, I added around 3/4 tsp of cornstarch as I mixed it all together in a bowl, then poured over the chicken. The end result was good, but I wanted more tomato flavor, so next time I will use the paste, but I will increase the amount. We served it over brown rice.

Pretty tasty!  I used diced chicken breasts instead of the whole chicken for ease.  Also, next time I will mix the tomato paste with spices before placing it in the pan so the flavors will be more evenly dispersed.

Terrific - a good change of pace.  I also doubled the sauce recipe for one chicken, and added some extra tomato paste so it would spread nicely (as the recipe wanted, it was *very* heavy on onion!)

I tripled the souce, and used skinless thighs instead of whole chicken, baked in the oven.
It turned out great! Maybe next time, I will make more souce for the rice. Yumm..

In the end, this turned out pretty well; I had to make quite a few changes, though.  First, I used chicken breasts, cubed.  I tripled the seasonings based on previous reviews, and I used celery seed instead of celery salt.  I doubled the tomato paste and added a can of chicken stock to the amount of water called for.  All of these changes made for a saucier, spicier dish.  I served it over basmati rice.  I liked it a lot.  My husband thought it was just ok.  My oldest son LOVED it, and my youngest son hated it.  I likely won't make this again, but I appreciate the opportunity to try it!

I was disappointed that the spices didn't come through more; next time I would rub them under the skin and inside, maybe before beginning to cook.

Very good flavor. Like some, I used precooked chicken. (I used boneless, skinless breasts that I sauteed in EVOO until they were no longer pink. I put the garlic in here and sauteed the chicken and garlic together.) I made the sauce separately and tripled it. When the chicken was done, I put the sauce in the skillet and let it simmer for 5 or 10 minutes longer. I served over steamed rice from my rice cooker. (So easy!!)  The sauce was spicy, but more warm than hot. I would add less salt next time. Definitely worth doing again!

Pretty tasty! I think the instructions are a little off on the method however. The last part says to cook the chicken in the sauce for 5 minutes. This is no where near long enough, and needs at least another 1/2 hour. In the end this was a pretty tasty way to prepare chicken.

A definate keeper. I played a bit with it after reading the reviews.  I doubled the spices, and I didn't have tomato paste so I used tomato sauce, about 3-4 oz, and omitted the water.  I also marinated the onions and chicken in the sauce, prior to cooking.  I then just stuck it all in the oven as it was.  I browned the chicken slightly with just a touch of honey on it, after it came out of the oven.  My husband loved it.  I just discovered garam Marsala about a week ago, and love it.  a wonderful spice and a great recipe.

My daughter and I recently tried Indian cuisine for the first time and fell in love.  I searched for something close to Vindaloo and came across this.  I didn't have tomato paste so I substituted tomato sauce roughly about 1/4 cup.  No garam masala so I substituted ground cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and ginger.  It came out very, very good and I would definitely make this again.  Paired it with basmati rice and a salad.  YUMMY!

This was very good. I added about 1/4 tsp. of red Indian Chili powder, and a dash of coriander. I also used a little bit more curry powder. I was cooking for 3 so I used about 1lb of chicken and I didn't have to make extra sauce. I served it over Basmati Rice.

Wonderful flavor, thank you so much for submitting this simple and delicious recipe.  I took note of the other reviewers' comments.  I used 2 large split breasts and doubled the tomato paste and water (used 1/2 cup with the initial sauce mixture).  I cooked the chicken 30 minutes after putting the sauce and onions on the chicken.  After cooking I removed the chicken from the dutch oven and added a little all purpose flour to the sauce to thicken it, removed the skin from the chicken and served on a bed of rice.  Very happy with how this turned out - moist and delicious.  It's really all about the sauce, which I ladled generously over the chicken.  If you like Indian food you should definitely try this recipe and tweak it to your personal tastes - a real keeper.

I cooked it with two cut up chicken breasts on the stove and added double sauce. It was very good with brown rice, the roommate also enjoyed it.

I love indian food, but have only tried making it at home one other time - tandoori chicken. It was so flavorful, likely due to the 24 hour marinading process it went through. This Bunjal chicken, which delicious smelling while cooking, didn't take on NEARLY as much flavor as I had hoped. I didn't even follow the directions of adding the "sauce" (more like coated onions) to the chicken at the end, but rather after only 15 minutes of the chicken cooking. Next time I will cut into pieces, put in a ziplock back with the doubled onion/sauce mixture then cook it 24 hours after marinading. It has some potential, is very healthy!

**update:  Tonight I remade this.  First I cut the chicken into parts.  Then I put them in a roasting bag with the sauce and cooked close to an hour.  The flavors married much better and was very tasty.  This recipe definately isn't a 3, but not quite a 4 either, although very close.  The fragrant aroma in my home was absolutely wonderful.  The chicken just didn't quite grab it.  But, it is definately worth trying again.

I made this recipe pretty much as directed except I made it on the stovetop using 1 lb of boneless chicken breast cut into chunks and used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead of tomato paste and water.  I did end up adding more water as it simmered since it cooked off - I simmered it for about 20 minutes after adding the sauce and spices. Even though I used less chicken, I left the spices and sauce amounts the same as the recipe and I'm glad I did. Even so, there wasn't a lot of flavor to this dish even with all of the spices. I have to concur with the reviews that said it was on the bland side, as strange as that seems. I did add a few shakes of cinnamon at the end which helped a little, but I probably won't make this again. I much, much prefer the Chicken Tikka Masala recipe on this site even though it takes a bit longer to prepare.

Made double the sauce, and added it to the chicken a little earlier in the cooking, and it was awesome, the whole family loved it!  My kids(3,5 and 7 yrs old) kept asking for more chicken!
Thanks for a great recipe :)

Thank you for giving me such a quick, easy, healthy, and most importantly, amazingly yummy recipe to start with!! I've added my stove-top version to your custom versions tab. Kept your delicious blend, only adding some paprika and cayenne because I love my grub extra spicy! ;)

I plan to try this again with 4-5 times the amount of spice. The flavor was good it was just far too light.

I doubled the sauce, and diced the chicken after cooking.  Also added 3 carrots, sliced, and a can of green beans for some veggies.  The whole family loved it!

Followed some other comments adding more of the spices. Made on stove top with chicken breasts cut up. Use 1/2 can tomato paste, 1 or more cups chicken broth and 1/2 can crushed tomatoes and fresh mushrooms.

Absolutely loved it. I doubled the sauce recipe after reading reviews and used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken. This recipe was so easy and flavorful.

I used cubed boneless chicken breast, because that was what I had on had. It was ok, but rather bland.  Next time, I'll double or triple the spices and sauce part, and let it sit for longer.  My little brother liked it a lot though.
