This was excellent! I changed the recipe with ingredients I had on hand. I used bread flour, active dry yeast & I let the dough sit covered for an hour.  The crust was great. I cut the two tablespoons of evoo to one while brushing the crust and I de-seeded the tomatoes because I didn't want the crust to get soggy. While the pizza was cooling I drizzled it with a balsamic reduction.  Very tasty!

I used Quick Rise yeast, and followed the recipe (but used different toppings). It tasted bland, but good. Overall, it was kind of boring in taste, but with the toppings I used it was yummy.

Just use the crust recipe with the rapid rise yeast. Comes out perfect every time!
