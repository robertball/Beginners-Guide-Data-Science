I had been looking for a recipe for the oil they use on subs and this was great. My only complaint is that I stored it in the refrigerator and the oil congeals. Heat it up a bit in the microwave to solve the problem. Much cheaper than the oils for subs you can buy ready made in the stroes.

This is GREAT!! Of course I had to mess around with it, so I added 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and a little sugar...and a lot more garlic. This basic easy recipe is FANTASTIC, thanks for sharing.

Great! But not what Johnny Carino's serves (I used to work there). They just add baked minced garlic to extra virgin olive oil. This is better than that for a sandwich spread!

This is a great recipe.  I use it for dipping bread in with Italian meals.  I used dried garlic and crushed it.  So good.  I've been looking for a recipe like they use at Johnny Carino's and this is it!!!!

We welcomed the idea of homemade subs after all the various burgers we consumed this past Memorial Day weekend. We were even more delighted with this oil/dressing! It "made" the subs! I will not lose this recipe! Its toooooo good!

I made this for Faceless Frenzy July 2012 - it had been in my recipe box for a long time - over all this is very tasty but it also needs some red wine vinegar.  This would also make a tasty dipping oil for some crusty bread.

Wonderful results for such a simple recipe!  I scaled this recipe down so that I wouldn't have to store leftover oil.  It still worked great.  Made for very tasty sandwiches!  I put it on the bread and on the lettuce so there was plenty of flavor on each sandwich.  My husband said the sandwiches were better than those we buy at the sub shop.

My Mother always made subs with grated cabbage mixed with Italian dressing, various meats and mozzeralla.  I found myself without Italian dressing so I went to this site and found this.  An excellent alternative when I really needed it.  Thanks Anne you saved my day!!!!

This recipe is fantastic!  I made my mother an traditional sub sandwich and she thought it was bought at a sub shop.  This is definately a keeper.

Annie is correct -- this is "IT" -- the extra ingredient that makes your submarine sandwiches taste like the real deal.  Thank you, Annie!

So very tasty. I did add more garlic, since we are all garlic lovers.

This was okay.  I didn't have a glass jar, so I steeped in a plastic bowl with a lid, and that may not have been a good idea.  The flavors really didn't blend together all that great.  Again, that was probably all me, and I will try this again using glass next time.  Also I just made regular subs, and not italian subs.  I'm sure this would've been awesome on Italian subs. There will be a next time for this dressing, I will just be sure to follow directions a bit better.
