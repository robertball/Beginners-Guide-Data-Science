Can't imagine a better tasting hamburger coming off the grill.  We did exactly the same recipe the very next nite.  Wonderful.

I did not make these using the foil.  Made the burgers as noted and threw them
on the gas grill. Added more blue cheese to the tops pf the burgers at the very end. Cooked the onion and mushrooms in the oil in a pan on the stove while the burgers were cooking.  These were very good burgers.
