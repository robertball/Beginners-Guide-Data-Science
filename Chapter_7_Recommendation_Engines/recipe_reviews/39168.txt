Great way to combine 2 pies into one.  For those who had trouble with the layers combining, be sure to carefully smooth the top of the pumpkin layer in the bottom of the pie crust and GENTLY spoon the pecan layer onto the top.  Also, I find that the pecan layer mixes better with the butter melted.

Very good!  I'm eating it (still warm) now. Prior to making it, I read the reviews and was a little concerned about the "layering" thing, but it turned out beautifully.  Even if it hadn't, so what? I don't figure my particular pie will be featured in a food layout. Next time I'll cut the amount of sugar and/or corn syrup. And if the "pumpkin" flavor seems overwhelming to some, just cut down on the spices.

I made this for my husband last year and he simply loved it!  I substituted honey for the corn syrup and it still came out great.

A friend told me that her husband used to eat this kind of pie in Louisiana, and they could never find the recipe for it here in Texas. However, you saved the day! They said that it was better than they remembered. Thanks for the great recipe!

This turned out just like the picture--two layers. I used 2 cups of pecans with a 10 inch pie plate. Even with the additional nuts, the pumpkin overpowered the pecan flavor. If you prefer pumpkin, this is a great pie. For pecan-lovers like myself, stick to the traditional.

This was just okay. There wasn't a separation between the two layers like I thought there would be. Maybe I did something wrong. Probably wouldn't make again.

This is the best pie I've ever had! It's better than pecan, and it's better than just plain pumpkin. It's not so terribly sweet, like pecan pie, it's just right. The only thing I did differently was I didn't use all of the topping, as far as the liquid is concerned. I just left the liquid that wouldn't fit into my pie shell in the mixing bowl. But you can bet every pecan found a place on top of that pumpkin filling!! It's EXCELLENT! I'm making several for Christmas!!!

Great tasting pie.  Great reviews from dinner guests.  It wasn't two layers as in the picture with the recipe (which I wanted).  I expected a pumpkin layer and then a pecan pie type layer, but the layers blended together and essentially it tasted like a pumpkin pie with pecans on top.  But, it was very good and I will make it again.

Really tasty pie, a little rich but for the holiday time an alright splurge!  I baked it 50 minutes and it was a little too long, wish I had been watching it closer.  Those pecans on the top burn quickly so I'd just recomend really watching the cooking time and checking it often before the 50 minute baking time.  The pumpkin is a little bit overpowered by the sweetness of the pecan layer but for someone like me that enjoys pumpkin pie but prefers pecan pie it was a good balance.  Mine really didn't achieve the two layered look but that may have been because of being a little ovebaked.  The two flavors were still very distinguishable from one another though.  I will try it again for company we are having in a couple days and I think a cutback on the 50 minute baking time will result in a 5 star pie!

I made this pie on Thanksgiving and my whole family loved it. I am making it again for Christmas. The taste was great. I had no issues with anything. My layering was fine. The only difference for me perhaps was that it took time for me to finish the topping so the second half of the pie may have set a little. I would add a few minutes of time before adding the topping. This may prevent the topping from seeping through.

My husband loves pecan pie and pumpkin pie. So I thought this one would be perfect. It was very good! I just wish it'd had a little more to the pumpkin layer. He thought it was a great recipe too since it put his two favorites into one!

It was just alright. It did form 2 separate layers, but the pecan filling kind of seeped into the pumpkin, making it very sweet and lost the smooth texture. Not worth skipping 2 separate pies to make this.
