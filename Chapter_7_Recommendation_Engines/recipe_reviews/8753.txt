Good recipe!! Little spicy (which i think is from the garlic and pepper) but the tastes meld well together. I didn't bother to check the fat or sodium intake on this but it tatses really healthy considering most pasta recipes call for a butter or cream ingrediant.  Left out the water chesnuts and used frozen pea pods...will make again! Goes well with garlic bread.

This was a really great recipe that won't overstuff you.  No heavy sauce - but still lots of flavor.  The red bell pepper gives it a great texture and taste.  Only thing I changed - added more garlic, but I love garlic! :)

We loved this including the 4 year old.  I did take the suggestion and added alittle flour mixture to thicken the sauce, used turkey sausage because that's what I had and didn't use the water chestnuts-YUCK! It was truly tasty and flavorful for my hubby on his new year's diet.  Thanks

this was such a good recipe, I marinated my chicken in a ginger and sesame seed marinade for about 1/2 hour.  It has such an amazing flavor even my kids liked it.

I'm afraid my photo isn't entirely representative of the written recipe...I wanted to make this but didn't have all the ingredients. I used leftover cubed chicken (baked with a spice rub) and sauteed chopped onions with the peppers. Then added quartered black olives along with the chicken.  Garnished the dish with lots of Parmesan cheese. I thought the results were delicious but would like to try the original recipe, too!

Hubby and I love it! We omitted the water chestnuts and topped the finished product with feta cheese. Delicious!

Excellent recipe!  Very light, flavorful, and healthy.  I substituted penne for the angel hair, and Hormel southwestern chicken for the deli chicken.  Topped it with a little parmesan.  Wonderful!

I loved this but the rest of the family thought it needed some sauce.  A little Philadelphia Italian Cooking Creme made them happy.

Love this dish.  So easy to fix and tastes wonderful when reheated.  This is a great meal for a busy family and a welcome change from spaghetti.

I changed quite a few things for our taste, but this was great! We added broccoli, and I used regular peas instead of snap peas. This is so easy and I love the idea of using deli chicken. This will become part of our weekly dinner rotation.

It tasted a bit like chicken noodle soup. It was very easy to put together and I liked it fine, but there is no way my husband would eat it, as it is not a very hearty meal.

After reading some reviews I tweaked it a bit by mixing a bit of flour with cold water before adding to the chicken broth so to thicken it up a bit. Also seasoned the chicken to give it more flavor. Was light and perfect for an evening meal!

This was very good. I would not have changed anything except my husband bought smoked ham and not smoked chicken. So I cut up one and a half chicken breast and seasoned it with Penzy's Tandori seasoning. 
Otherwise everything else I did according to the recipe.

yes a little runny...and rather than using onion powder, since you are already slicing peppers I cut up half a sweet onion and cooked it w/ the veggies.  Ads more flavor and ups the veg count.  Save some of the pasta cooking water and spoon some in along with about half of the stock.  It helps to thicken the "sauce" and make if cling to the ingredients better.  Also...certainly don't need to EVER cook water chestnuts for 10 minutes...toss them in at the end.

It was okay, nothing really special. I would have liked a bit more spice to it, perhaps some Italian seasonings? Maybe chunks of freshly sautéed tomatoes. I think almost any fresh vegetable could be thrown in . . . but it needs more than what the recipe here suggests.
