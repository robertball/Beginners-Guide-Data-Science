The flavor was really nice but I think something is wrong with this recipe as there is no leavening. I made it in a rush and didn t notice there wasn t any baking powder or soda in the recipe until I was already halfway through making it. There s no way you d have a cake like this without leavening so I added 1 teaspoon baking powder. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter. The cake was very dense even with the baking powder I added so I can t imagine what it is like without. Like other reviewers I was disappointed as there isn t enough cake and it certainly isn t a coffee cake. The end result was edible but disappointing. I won t make again. Thank you for the recipe but I d love to know if the author maybe forgot to add leavening to the recipe.

Delicious! It was moist and not too sweet. The cranberries added just the right amount of tartness.

I noticed there was no leavening in the recipe so I added 1/2 tsp of baking soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder just to be sure. I also used pecans. I also used 1 1/2 cups of cranberries too after reading the reviews. I liked it but feel like it could have been a little sweeter. My friends liked it and asked for the recipe.

turned out well but don't let it sit more than a couple days. It gets a bit sticky after about 3 days

Very delightful cranberry cake! I like the taste very much. Also used gluten free baking mix and Truvia in place of regular white sugar! Very Nice it's a keeper recipe for me!
