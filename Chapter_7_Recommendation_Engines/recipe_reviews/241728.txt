Quick and easy. The lemon zest gave it a nice pop of flavor.

I used 2 pounds of beans,  3 slices of bacon, 3 cloves of garlic and some fresh lime juice and zest. Compliments at Thanksgiving dinner. I will make it again.

Way too much butter in this recipe and we love butter, very disappointed this is the first recipe on this app that was not something I would ever make again!

Easy to make & pretty tasty. After reading the reviews, I decided to use one stick of butter instead of two and it was plenty.

A bit too much butter for our taste; but, I will certainly serve it again, just with less butter. Other than that, we loved it!!

We made this for Christmas, and it was  fantastic! As one reviewer mentioned, it was indeed swimming in butter. Next time, I'll try just one stick, instead of two.

Great flavor. As others have indicated, kind of an absurd amount of butter. We also added more garlic and baked the bacon. Yum!  Great Thanksgiving side dish!

Great flavor. I used 4 pieces of bacon I cooked on the stove and only 1/4 cup of butter. Quick, simple, and delicious.

Everyone loved it, it was delicious! The only things I changed is that I steamed the beans instead of boiling them (healthier) and I saut√©ed the garlic in the butter before adding the beans. I will definitely make these again.

Really easy to make and so delicious! One of my teenage sons who despises green beans absolutely loved them! He even asked me to write down the recipe so that when he moves out he can make them himself!

Made this with haricot verts, as they are the only green beans my husband likes.  Otherwise,  I kept to the recipe (scaled down for two servings).  The lemon zest really elevates the dish.

Fairly easy and tasty.  I only had 2.5 lbs of beans and used 1/4 cup of butter and that was PLENTY!  I forgot to add the lemon zest and I am sure that would have been great to top it off.  I also added a few shakes of salt as my butter was unsalted.

These were okay, but too much butter! I never thought I would say that, but these were swimming in it.
