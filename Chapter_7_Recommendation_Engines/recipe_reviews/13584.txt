Ah...Comfort food.  This made my stove top hating friend's jaw hit the floor when I told her that there was stove top in there!  To free up the oven while I cooked the turkey and put the stuffing in the crockpot on high a few hours ahead of time.  I stirred once every hour.  To offset the sweetness that previous reviewers complained of, I only added one cup of apple juice and one cup of chickeb broth which gave it a slightly sweet flavor which really complemented the apples.  Did I mention that this was the first time I ever made homemade stuffing and it was REALLY easy?!!

This was really good.  I stuffed chicken with it.  I cut the liquid a little, it would have been too runny otherwise.

Delicious stuffing - made a big hit!  I used store-made cornbread (14 0z.) and less butter (1 stick).  I baked it till top was crispy.

This is the absolute most wonderful stuffing I have ever consumed! I stumbled upon it a few years ago when looking for a vegetarian stuffing and ever since I insist on bringing the stuffing to every Thanksgiving dinner I attend (and I can eat meat now)! People love it! Even my must-eat-meat-or-it's-no-good family! I don't even tell them it's vegetarian! Even though we all eat meat, I still make this stuffing because it is THAT good. 
If you are looking for vegetarian make sure you read the box on the stuffing you add to see it doesn't have dried chicken broth in it. Or substitute similar herbs or veggie bouillon (must include sage!) and stale bread cut into tiny cubes. But if you are a meat eater, trust me... this recipe is worth trying!!! You'll be convinced.

The entire table agreed this was the best dressing we'd ever had!  For the first time in my life, there was no leftover dressing at the end of the day.  I substituted 1 cup raisins for the celery (I had two celery haters at the table -- the raisins tasted great with the apples, I definitely recommend this even if you're using celery too) and used only 1 1/2 cups apple juice.

We've been making this for years! My mom got this from the Houston Chronicle.  Here are a few differences in our recipe [my notes are in braces]:  3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley  1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, ginger OR poultry seasoning [I like poultry seasoning best]  1 cup *sliced* celery   1/2 pound bulk sausage, sauteed (optional)  2 cups chopped apples (about three)  2 cups apple juice OR half apple juice, half turkey stock   The prep steps are the same. If you use the sausage, omit the butter. Saute the sausage, then add the vegetables.   The dressing can be stuffed lightly into body and neck cavities of turkey. Makes enough for an 18-pound turkey.    My hints and preferences are...  I make my cornbread into muffins. They bake more quickly. I make them the day before. Day-old is good! My cornbread recipe does not call for much sugar (1/4 cup to 1 cup flour and 1 cup cornmeal). You want a savory cornbread, not sweet.     I have not used the sausage in years, but this recipe is good either way.     I have cut the butter down and substituted oil for part of it. 3/4 cup butter is 12 tablespoons! I think 6 tablespoons butter and 4 of vegetable oil work well.     I up the poultry seasoning to 1 teaspoon.    I have left the eggs out or reduced them, but I prefer it with the eggs. If you leave them out, make sure you have enough liquid so it won't be dry.    I usually use half apple juice, half turkey stock (or chicken stock).     I have increased pecans to one cup.    Enjoy!

This stuffing was great!!!!  I don't usually like stuffing, but the cornbread and apples (we used Fujis) were a perfect combination.  All 13 people at Thanksgiving dinner agreed!  Thanks for the great recipe:)

I have made this wonderful recipe twice.  My family just loves it!  I used Jiffy cornbread mix, so it is sweet, but the sweetness is subdued by the other ingredients.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I am pregnant and have an aversion to sausage, so this recipe was great for me
in terms of preparation.  I used Granny Smith apples which were a little tart.
Next time I will use a Cortland or a milder flavored apple, but all of my holiday
guests enjoyed the dressing!

VEry good.  I added a little low sodium chicken broth, to make it moister, and I also dotted butter on the top, to make the top crisp.  

I made it for my father in law that has to watch his salt, and with the apple juice rather than chicken broth, it was a good recipe.  I will make it again.

My husband and I had our entire family over for “our first” thanksgiving dinner.  This recipe was great, however I added mushrooms to it.  I received so many complements!  Everyone loved it!!

While I liked the flavor of this dressing, mine came out too dry.  Perhaps it was because I halved it and maybe the proportions weren't right.  If I try it again, I would definatley add more juice or broth to the stuffing.

Yummy! This is great.  Only suggestion I would have would be to make it ahead of time.  It took a while to do all the chopping but well worth it.

This was a big hit for Thanksgiving even though I cut the apple pieces too small and overcooked them.  You couldn't even tell there were apples in it.  Oh, well, it was still delicious!

We liked this a lot although it's a nuisance to prepare since the cornbread has to be made before getting down to the recipe.  Also, I added some fresh cranberries and the dressing turned out very well.

This was pretty darn good - a great alternative to regular stuffing.  I had a great recipe for my own cornbread, so I think that helped keep it moist, that and the apple juice was good, not as sweet as I thought it would be.  The only change I would make, is sprinkling the pecans ontop - we couldn't really taste them mixed together with everything else.  Five stars!

I made this dressing for Thanksgiving and was disappointed at how dry it was.  I do not feel that the apple or pecan flavors were very developed.  Perhaps a smaller batch of cornbread (not the 9x9 pan) would be better.  I'm not sure though.

This was the best dressing I have ever tasted! My husband hates dressing and he had second helpings of this. It was easy to do, and I followed the recipe exactly as stated. This dish is the perfect consistency - not too dry, not too moist. I will make this more often as a side dish and not just for Thanksgiving.

I was looking for a cornbread dressing like my grandma's and decided to try this. I've never used apples in dressing before and now I want to put them in everything!  I didn't use the packaged stuffing mix I used either pilsbury biscuits or some plain bread.

This was a great recipe but a little on the sweet side for my taste.  I cut the juice in half and subbed chicken broth. I loved the pecans and the apple. I might try a spicy sausage to make it a little more savory. Overall an excellent recipe.

I scaled this recipe down to make 4 servings for a family dinner. Served it with a marinated pork tenderloin and this was an AWESOME dinner (if I do say so myself!) We all loved this dressing! I froze the extra cornbread to serve with another dinner later.

I made this stuffing per the recipe.  It was hands down the best stuffing I have ever eaten.  My husband said it was the best he has ever had as well.  He asked me where I kept the Stove Top......I looked at him confused and he said he's throwing it all away....he wants this dressing/stuffing from now on. Addition to earlier review re: sweetness.......I have made this recipe 3 times now.  The first time the flavor was perfect.  The second time the dressing was too sweet...much sweeter than the first time and I didn't care for it (stunk too because I had guests that time).  The third time (made it yesterday for Father's Day) the flavor was perfect again.  The first and third time I used the apple juice you buy in the container....the second time I forgot to buy it and used the kid's apple juice drink boxes....so......if you use juice drink boxes the stuffing may be too sweet....didn't think it would make a difference...but there you have it. Also, I use Gala apples and it's YUMMY!!!!

Fabulous!! I didn't get rave reviews on this dressing as we had SO MUCH good food, but seeing as that I prepared most of it and was especially excited to try this recipe I have to say it came out perfect. I love the sweetness and the pecans give it such a nice crunch. I changed the preperation method just a bit to suit my taste: I added the apple juice and chopped apples to the pan of butter, onion, and celery after they where done cooking and I just heated through. In addition to adding the apples, I threw in 3/4 cup of dried cranberries. I couldn't find "herb seasoned dry bread stuffing mix" so I just used poultry seasoning to taste. YUM! This will be a staple in my house from now on.

I printed out this recipe for Thanksgiving 1999.  Every year I have cooked for the holidays, I have made this dressing, so I'm at least a 10 time user. Super easy, super moist, and a hit every single time. Just follow the recipe like it is written.  Jiffy in a box works great for the cornbread since it is not sweet cornbread.  Over the years, I have found that I end up wanting to make a little larger batch for leftovers, so I just use a little more of all of the ingredients.  Use the apple juice (increase amount a little) to figure out how moist or not you want the dressing.  This truly is a "no fail" recipe. Don't over-toss the ingredients to where you make mush.  Thanks to the initial contributor for such an incredible recipe.  (It freezes just fine for future leftovers).

This stuffing was fantastic!  It was very easy to make and everyone loved it!  I used Braeburn apples which have a mild tartness to them and it turned out delicious.

I have made this recipe several years in a row now, and it is always a favorite.  My husband can't eat pecans, and it is just as tasty without the nuts.  Regular dressing tastes boring after eating this because it does have a sweetness to it.  I use Marie Callenders corn bread mix for extra sweetness.

This is a very good dressing recipe. I have been looking for one that added all the flavors i love together and this one does. I added some sausage, fresh sage, and dried cranberries for another flavor dimention.

This was very good, I just made it for thanksgiving and I wanted to just sit and eat nothing but stuffing! Instead of using a package of stuffing I used 4 cups of seasoned small crutons and it worked out great. I added a cup of chopped bell peppers and instead of 2 cups of apple juice I used 1 cup of apple juice and one cup of chicken stock. I also didn't add the eggs (I forgot to actually) but it still tasted amazing and the eggs weren't missed at all!

I loved this dressing and so did my sister-in -law so we give it a 5! But others liked my regular dressing better.  This may be better with a pork roast than with turkey.

Even my friend who hates stuffing loved this recipe. I used hard cider instead of juice, and I added a pound of spicy sausage (browned and crumbled before adding). Excellent!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. We also served a sage and sausage stuffing so this was a nice sweet accompaniment/alternative. I used Granny Smith apples by mistake. Although other people liked it with the Granny Smiths, I would use a different type of apple next time. I felt that it took a bit too long for the apples to soften.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was very tasty.  It was a little crumbly, so I might add an egg or some apple juice.  If you are serving gravy (I did not) then the consistency is fine.  Also, I didn't notice much of an apple or sweet taste.  It was a simple recipes to prepare.  I would make this again when there are vegetarians for dinner, but I still prefer a cornbread dressing with sausage !

This was a fabulous recipe.  The flavors blended perfectly, the texture was wonderful, and it was extremely easy to prepare.  I even substituted the pecans for walnuts, only used a small amount of parsley, and added some dried cranberries, but it still tasted wonderful.  It seems like a very flexible recipe that can be fun to tinker with.  Highly recommended.

This was excellent!  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I don't normally care much for stuffing, but I love cornbread and I loved the flavor of this recipe.  I used 1 cup apple juice and one cup water because I was afraid it may be too sweet with all apple juice.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This is so delicious!  I made this at Thanksgiving last year and my family insisted I bring it again at Christmas and at Thanksgiving this year again! I followed the suggestion of a review below and reduced the apple juice to one cup and added one cup of chicken broth so it wasn't quite so sweet.  Delicious!  And easy too!

I made this for Thanksgiving and was pleasantly surprised at the results. I left out the onion due to my personal taste and it was still a hit. I craved it for days after the holidays and will surely make again next Thanksgiving!

This was my first attempt at making dressing and it was FABULOUS - I have never liked stuffing before and I absolutely loved this, plus my family said it was the best they've ever had - will definitely make this part of our family tradition. I followed the recipe exactly (except used toasted bread and my own herbs instead of a mix) and I wish I had doubled it!!! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This is a very delightful dressing but for my taste it needs a little more spice/salt. Next time I will add a little more salt to enhance the flavors and possibly more fresh parsley from my garden. I will make this dressing again. Thanks for the recipe.

This is my new favorite dressing! I used a 15 oz pre-made cornbread from my local grocery store bakery and since I didn't have an 8 oz bag of stuffing I used a little more than half of my 14 oz bag (approx 5 cups). I also doubled the pecans (I love them!) I used chicken broth instead of apple juice because I chickened out and thought it might be too sweet and it turned out really good. I think next time I'll try 1/2 and 1/2. I'm going to make this again and try adding some sausage! MMMM!

Best stuffing ever. My family begs me to make this - my sister even threatened to boycott Thanksgiving if I didn't make it! Another year they told me it was ok if I couldn't come, but could I please drop the stuffing off anyway? :) I put pecans on only half, as some people don't care for them, and it's great either way. AWESOME recipe!

If you follow this recipe (and use unsweetened apple juice) you will have a great stuffing. Made corn bread, mixed it with all spices, nuts, stuffing mix and put it in a big ziploc bag the night before Thanksgiving. The next morning I mixed the wet ingredients and baked a few hours later. Printed out 10 copies of recipe for my guests. Thanks for the recipe!

This was not very good. It tasted very acidic and bitter. It was the only thing we had leftover from Thanksgiving. We won't make again.

I made this recipe exactly as it written for a dinner party last week. Everyone loved it! No one thought it was too sweet as others have suggested. 

Just trust the recipe and go. You will never make standard dressing again!

I loved this!  I am hosting Thanksgiving and am looking for new dishes. I used 1/2 broth and half fresh apple sauce (forgot to get juice). I found the amount of moisture perfect. Unfortunately, my DH is ridiculously picky, and could barely force it down. Oh well, back to the drawing board!  I am still giving it 5 stars!

Really good. This dish has become a staple at Thanksgiving and Christmas. My whole family enjoys it. The ginger adds a really nice taste. Just a suggestion make sure the dressing is moist before you bake it. I combined the butter, apple juice, and egg whites and added it all in at once.

I made this dressing for Thanksgiving & it was a big hit!  Very nice flavor.  I saved time by making the cornbread a couple days ahead & cutting up onion & celery the day before.  It was a breeze to finish up on Thanksgiving morning.

I have never been able to make wonderful, moist dressing until now.  This was excellent.  Nearly the entire dish of dressing was eaten and people kept raving about the flavor.  During the mixing, before adding the eggs, I tasted to see if the apple juice made it too sweet, and ended up adding in some chicken broth, also, but other than that, the recipe was made as stated.  Wonderful texture and flavor, and the smell while it was cooking (three hours in the crock pot on high) was out of this world.

This was very good and not too sweet like others had mentioned. There is a nice balance between the cornbread and regular stuffing mix. Other fruit I added were cranberries and dried apricots. I cooked mine for almost an hour which made it a little dry...I won't overcook it next time.

Ok, I'm giving this a 4 because it's a little sweet for my tastes.  I think I would prefer a traditional dressing with the apples added to it.  I think the apple juice too sweet.  I will try it again with stock instead of juice.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and will definitley be making it again this year. The only change I made was using day-old bread cubes and a little poultry seasoning instead of the packaged stuff. The flavor is just what I was looking for and I love the cohesiveness of the finished product...almost like a spoon bread.

I like the flavors in this a lot, but I didn't like the consistency as much.  It was a little too dry and crumbly for my taste.  It won't make my Thanksgiving table, but I might make it as a side dish during the year.

What a fantastic recipe! Everyone loved it for Thanksgiving last year, will be making it again this year. I used large gala apples and Martha White sweet yellow cornbread mix (8x8 pan) & few extra pecans- comes out delicious!!

I had never liked cornbread until I had this last year at Thanksgiving. 

The ingredients might seem really odd, but it is one AMAZING stuffing. I could eat this stuff plain without all the other stuff you normally eat for the holidays. Its that good.

I thought this dressing was absolutely delicious.  However, I gave it 4 stars because my husband did not care for it.  He said the herb-seasoned dry bread stuffing mix was too overpowering.  I personally thought it was great.  I did add some chicken broth to make it moister.

I would have rated it higher, but my expectations were pretty high and it didn't quite live up to those.  It's a nice dish with a unique taste, but it's not so much better than boxed stuffing that I would go to the trouble of making it very often.

This was delicious. I made it for Christmas dinner using the ingredients as shown. I cooked it about half way on Christmas Eve, refrigerated it and completed the process when I heated it up for Christmas dinner. It got rave reviews from my picky family.

This recipe was a hit! I was a bit worried that it wasn't tasty enough so I added a bit more salt.  Also, instead of 2 cups of apple juice I used 1 cup water, 1 cup apple juice & pay for quality apples!

A nice change from my traditional celery and onion stuffing.  Per others suggestions I only used 1 cup of apple juice and then used 1 cup of chicken broth.  I could see how 2 cups of the juice would make this extra sweet instead of slighly sweet.  I used 3 fuji apples which was a good flavor choice.

This is a great recipe!  The combination of sweet cornbread and savory herb stuffing mix makes for a great base.  I doubled the recipe with Gala apples, pasturized apple cider, and omitted the pecans due to family preferance.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  I thought the apples would have been better tossed into the onion/celery mixture at the end but my kids liked the mild bite from the apples.  Over all, very good dressing....neither too dry or too moist.

Wow! I was a little nervous to make this for the first time for a Thanksgiving dinner for 18. I thought it was just perfect though. I don't like processed food, so instead of the premade stuffing mix, I just cut up some homemade bread into small cubes, and toasted with 1 T sage, 1/2 t marjoram, thyme, and rosemary, and a dash of pepper. The consistency was perfect. Yes, it was sweet, but not overly so.

I love this recipe.  I make it every year for Thanksgiving and it is always a hit. I will change it around depending what I may have around or forgot to pick up at the store, but using the apple juice to sweeten and moisten the stuffing makes it really unique.

This was good - and my family commented on how "different" it was.  I will make it again.

I was skeptical, but the dish proved to be outstanding. Made as written and couldn’t think of anything to change.  It will make an appearance again on Christmas.

Delicious...only suggestion is to peel apple and use a Granny Smith apple and a tad bit more of apple juice.

This recipe got really good reviews from family members this Thanksgiving. I did, however, add chicken broth and also after eating it, felt that it needed more seasoning. Maybe the chicken broth masked some of the original flavor of the recipe. I just like moist dressing, therefore knew it needed more liquid...maybe should have used more apple juice instead of chicken broth. Great recipe though!

This recipe was a huge hit yesterday at my Thanksgiving Dinner! I had several skeptical people going into the dinner and one asked for an extra serving! I only made one change and it was completely accidental.

I forgot to add the eggs before putting it into the oven and there was no way to tell! Awesome dish! I will make it again next year.

This was really good and pretty easy overall.  I wonder if substituting chicken broth for the apple juice would work out ok?

This was a great change from a normal sausage dressing. I thought it was a little sweet for my tastes, but topped with a little gravy and it was delicous. My hubby loved it!

Yummy! My favorite stuffing EVER!!! The sweet taste of the apple juice with the savory spice of the ginger is wonderful! This dish was everyone's favorite. My mom commented that this dressing was like a dessert. The recipe makes a lot of dressing which is great because that means leftovers!

Having some leftover cornbread I didn't want to see go bad, a sought out this recipe and my boyfriend and I just LOVED it! I agree with the other reviewers that it wasn't too sweet but just right. Like most people who love I cook,  did make some changes to suit what I had in the pantry. First, I salt-and-peppered the onion and celery while cooking in the pan. Next I used Barttlett Pears instead of apples because I had no apples! I also added 3/4 cup chopped and peeled carrots. And in addition to the fresh ginger I used ground ginger as well, about a tsp. It was beyond delicious and I can't wait to eat the rest of it-THANKS!

This is a perfect dressing.  Especially for the ones' who are vegetarian.  A great mix of flavor and easy to make.  A welcome addition to our family meals as well as a great dish for luncheons and pot-lucks !

I was afraid this would be too sweet as others had mentioned, so I used a recipe for unsweetened cornbread and kept tasting as I added the apple juice.  It wasn't sweet at all and had a lot more taste and texture than my usual white bread dressing.  I don't know if I will ever be able to go back!

This was the first time I made dressing for Thanksgiving and it turned out excellent.  My boyfriend has never liked stuffing and he loved this one.  By the time it was time for dinner there was a section missing from the pan b/c he couldn't stay out of it.

Really tasty...Full of flavor! I did add some sage and thyme into my cornmuffin mix. I also used walnuts instead of pecans, and toasted them for about 8 mins. I also cut down on the apple juice otherwise mine would have been soggy.I also cut down on the amount of butter, and still got a crispy top!

i really did not like this, but it was not the fault of the recipe.  i had tried to convince myself i'd like it because it intrigued me, but stayed true to form, and disliked the cornbread taste and texture. i did, however, enjoy the aroma.

This is one of the best dressings I've tasted.  It is perfect baked in a casserole dish - you don't need to put it in a bird for additional flavor.  It is not bland, it is quite tasty and I enjoyed the occasional crunch when I bit into a nut.  My boys did not like the nuts, but that is only personal preference.  A nice, moist, flavorful dressing.  I will make again.

The overall tasted of this dressing was delicious, but it was on the dry crunchy side. It may be because I made only one small change... I used dry cornbread mix instead of baking the cornbread and then crumbling it into the ingredients like the original recipe called for. That could have been a mistake on my part. Maybe if I used the baked cornbread, the whole dish would have turned out moist instead of dry and crunchy. That's why I gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars.

I lost track of how long  I have been making this. I always volunteer to bring the stuffing to Thanksgiving because I love this recipe! It turns out that I’m not the only one. It’s a family favorite. The sweet and savory are a perfect combination.

FAMILY FAVORITE!   This is the Best Cornbread Stuffing I have yet to make or eat.  I grew up travelling and it is not custom to have stuffing on Holiday.  I must admit I made for a semi large group of Family and Friends.  Needless to say it was gone so fast!   It is a bit time consuming though well worth it!

This was surprisingly very flavorful and very moist. It was a huge hit at our Christmas dinner. My daughter is a vegetarian so this was the perfect choice. I'll definitely make it again.

Perfect as written!! This is a wonderful vegetarian dressing and my picky husband loved it (after 23 yrs of marriage, if he doesn’t like it, he’ll tell me right there and then lol!).  Consistency was moist yet fluffy, not soggy.  I didn’t find it  sweet as other reviewers have stated.

I am not a fan of traditional cornbread dressing as I grew up in the northeast where bread stuffing is most popular. However, this recipe rocked!  Just in case I didn't like it I made a small amount of bread stuffing as well. I barely ate any of the bread stuffing because this cornbread dressing was amazing. This had a bit of sweetness to it but, not overpowering. I will be making this again and again. AND, when I fried the leftovers in little balls as an appetizer the next day, it was a big hit! THANK YOU for posting!

I was looking for a vegetarian recipe and this sounded good! It was easy to make, but dry. Could have used a lot more liquid. The apples added a great taste, but still dry.

This is one of, if not THE, best dressings we've ever made.  Baked a pan of honey cornbread, but didn't have any dry bread stuffing on hand, so used about 6-7oz of crumbled fresh bread with about 1t of rubbed sage and poultry seasoning.  Cooked the onion and celery in a large, cast-iron skillet, which we then mixed everything in and put in the oven with some giblets on top (added baking time and covered towards the end to make sure the giblets were cooked through).  I was concerned the butter was going to be too much, but the finished dressing wasn't greasy tasting at all.  We only used about 1.5C of apple cider, since our bread wasn't really dry.  Also diced the apple pretty fine and used pecan pieces since we didn't want the dressing too chunky.  Also put some unbaked dressing in the turkey to finish in there and help flavor the bird.  Really wonderful flavor and texture on this dressing.  It's a keeper!

I made this for the first time this Thanksgiving and it was a hit! I cut out the pecans and used half chicken stock where it calls for apple juice to avoid it being too sweet.

Nice recipe for stuffing that I will use again with minor tweaks.  This was the first time I cooked the stuffing outside of the turkey, and it was a bit dry for my liking.  Perhaps spooning some of the turkey drippings over the top of the stuffing casserole when reheating will help next time.  I only used half the apple juice and for the remainder of the liquid I used chicken broth.  Just sweet enough.  I also think I would prefer chestnuts to pecans and will try that substitution next time.  All in all, my whole family enjoyed it - this recipe is a keeper.  Thanks!

I used fresh apple cider in lieu of apple juice, grated my own ginger instead of using ground ginger, and a little bit less corn bread (I'd say about 3/4 of what the recipe calls for) and it came out wonderfully. Very forward on the apple and ginger flavor while also still tasting like stuffing/dressing.

Left the Pecans out for a nut friendly dish. split half chicken stock, half apple juice.  Fantastic Recipe I always make the night before and bake the next day. Usually takes a little longer to cook from the fridge.

Just the right texture and moistness. But the flavor - nutty and apple-ly, blended with the sauteed, buttery veggies and bread, is the best part. Not too heavy, and a good balance to all the meat, gravy and cream casseroles.

I made this the night before Thanksgiving and reheated it on Thanksgiving and it tasted good.  It definitely wasn't too dry.  The consistency was very nice.  It did have a slight sweetness to it.  I'm not 100% sure I liked that, and I have a huge sweet tooth.

This is delicious! However, when I peeked in the oven after 30 minutes, the stuffing was a little too brown for my taste. Next year I will turn the oven down to 350, and take a peek sooner.

This is by far the Best Stuffing I have EVER MADE TO DATE!  I made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas, I am up making it again by request for family and friends.  It is moist, sweet "Vegetarian" or  "Vegan" fair.  I used white grape juice in place of the apple and amped up all of the fruits and veggies in addition too pecans.  I found that it's best to mix all the ingredients together and make sure it's nice and moist then let the stuffing sit covered with tin foil overnight in the refrigerator.  Before cooking be sure it's still moist by adding more juice.  Awesome flavors! All my guests have seconds and thirds.  Yummy ????

This recipe turned out deliciously.  We substituted chicken stock for apple juice and walnuts for pecans.  Also, I make my dressing into patties and cook on a pan rather than pouring into a baking dish.  I would definitely use this recipe again.

We tried this recipe and it was great.... We're not fans of ginger so we left that out and added in 1/2lb of sage sausage and 1/2c of dried cranberries.... We also went with Golden Delicious apples and they were a great choice too....

I use tart apples and a pinch of cinnamon to develop the apple flavor.  I have made this once as stated and then changed it up with sage sausage .  We like it better with the sausage.  Goes great with pork, chicken or turkey.

Outstanding. Because of the reviews, I made this with a half a cup less apple juice. This was the best dressing I've ever had.

Tried this for Thanksgiving this year and it turned out pretty good.  I substituted 1 cup apple juice with chicken broth and still thought it was a little sweet for my tastes.  I prefer savory dressing so next time I will use all chicken broth and no apple juice.  The chopped apples in it were a nice touch tho.  I will make this again because it's tasty and hard to screw up.  Thanks!

This dressing was fantastic. My family doesn't like dressing and everyone, including the ultra picky neice  and nephew, ate it and liked it.

This was my first attempt ever at making dressing.  It was so easy, and very good and the whole family liked it.  I'll make this from now on every Thanksgiving.  I could not find an 8 oz. package of stuffing, only 6 oz, and my cornbread recipe made an 8x8 pan instead of 9x9 so i decided to cut the apple juice in half.  I will not do that next time because I think it would have been more moist if I had used the full 2 cups.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Everyone enjoyed this dressing.  My husband requested that I add more apples next time, and I think I'll add more cornbread also.  Other than that, it was absolutely delicious!

This is the first time I've made my own stuffing for thanksgiving.  My aunt had always made the most delicious stuffing ever, and I was looking for something to measure up.  This was it.  I'm a vegetarian and I used Kellogg's stuffing mix with it; the only non meat flavored stuffing I could find, and it turned out great!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This will become our Thanksgiving tradition dressing. It was wonderful. I didn't have any apple juice so I put about four apples in my juice extractor, added a half cup of water and mixed it in. Absolutely delicious!

It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without this recipe!  I prepare it just as the recipe is written using Gala Apples and it always comes out perfect.  We like the apples chopped small with the chopped pecans a little larger. Wonderful!!
