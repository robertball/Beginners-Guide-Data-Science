I use fewer red Thai chili peppers (they are hot!) and add 2 TBS Red Curry Paste. Because of availability I sometimes use shitaki, button or even portabella mushrooms, also fresh lemongrass may be hard to find but it can usually be found in a tube, use about 2 TBS. I haven't used garlic before but it doesn't hurt.
