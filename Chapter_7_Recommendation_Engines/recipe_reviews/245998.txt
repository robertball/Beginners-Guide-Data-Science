I had high hopes that I would like this recipe because I, too, am like the submitter and prefer something warm to drink in the winter time. The earthy taste (possibly due to the hemp?) and the fact that it thickened too much as it sat bothered me.

I really would like to make this for the protein content along with the mocha taste, but other than almond butter and almond milk, where is the "packed protein" coming from? Seeds have some, true.  This recipe would be more aptly categorized Healthy Mocha Flavored Breakfast Drink than "Protein Packed..."
