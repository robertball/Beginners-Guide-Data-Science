Very good and very easy to make! You could even spice it up by adding different vegetables, but the asparagus, onion, garlic and tomato go very well together. Loved it and will definitely make it again.

We loved this recipe.  I only had pre-cooked extra large black tiger shrimp with tails on (26-30 count) on hand and fettucine.  I thawed between 15-20 shrimp and removed the tails.  I simmered the tails in about 3/4 cup of water with 1 tsp Old Bay seasoning and 1/2 tsp Onion Salt and 1/4 tsp red-pepper flakes until it was reduced to about a 1/2 a cup.  I then strained the broth from the shells.  I reserved 1/4 cup pasta water and mixed with the shrimp broth.  Added 1/4 cup white wine to the broth.  I used 1 TBSP butter and 2 TBSPs olive oil to saute the onions and garlic to make it healthier.  Then added the broth mixture and asparagus to the onion/garlic saute.  I didn't add tomatoes as I served bruschetta on the side.  I added the pasta at this point.  Simmered on low till most of the liquid was absorbed into the pasta and the aparagus tender.  I then added the shrimp (since it was already cooked).  Heated until hot, then served with parmesan and fresh cracked black pepper.  Hubby said he'd make that again lol!

Yum!  We loved it . Cut the onions in half and increased the garlic a touch.  An easy recipe with not many ingredients!  My kind of recipe!

This was so easy and yet so tasty. I did alter it a little, I doubled the garlic and substituted green onions for the regular onion. Next time I will mix the onions half and half, it needed a little stronger taste. My husband wants me to make it twice a week but, no, I want to keep the easy, fast recipes for those busy times.

I made a couple changes.  Added fresh rosemary, 2 T butter and 2 T white wine.  Thought it need a few changes to increase the flavor.  It turned out great and my husband who doesn't like seafood in his pasta thought it was very good!  I will definitely make it again!
