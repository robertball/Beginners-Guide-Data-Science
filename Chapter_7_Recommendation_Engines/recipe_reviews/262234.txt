Hi there. I tried this recipe today after a friend told me it was the best cake she has ever tasted. After 45 minutes I took it out and it collapsed completely in the middle in the shape of a rectangle so was just left with cake around the perimeter. It was completely raw like the batter. I left it to cool but only the outside was cooked. Please can you suggest where I could have gone wrong because the taste was amazing and would like to make it again.
Regards
Penny Bird

I left in the oven for 55 minutes as it did not appear to be done after 45. Cake was very dense, quite moist. Super lemon flavor but just a tad to sweet for our taste.

Tasted good, but followed instructions to a T and cake imploded.
