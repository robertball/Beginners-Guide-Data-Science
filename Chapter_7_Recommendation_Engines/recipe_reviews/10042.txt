Made these yesterday but substituted vanilla pudding mix for Cheesecake pudding mix.  Everyone LOVED them, and I had to put water in the filling bowl because I kept sticking my fingers in the extra ;-) Delicious!!!

Lucky cakes are an old recipe. My mother-in-law made these for her children many years ago. They are still a family favorite, and we are into a fourth generation from her. Janis's filling must be a more modern version with the use of the instant pudding. I will contribute Mom's filling recipe.
