This is by far the best potato chip cookie recipe I've tried. It low in calories cholesterol and carb's and still has good flavor and texture. My grandkids love it and plead for me to make them time and time again! I've tried the others you have listed but only Potato Chip Cookies IV come close to be as good.

I added more brown sugar and more butter in order to make a better dough consistency. With those modifications they are great. Next time I am also going to add more potato chips to make them a little saltier.

Ick! the texture and flavor are not good. I had never heard of this kind of cookie and thought it sounded interesting but it was flavorless and rubbery. Sorry.

"pleasant" is the word used to describe these cookies and I think that is right on! The flavor is not anything fantastic. But they are eggless and healthy and they use up your chip crumbs! I added 1/4 cup chopped apricots and used walnuts instead of almonds (what i had on hand!) Baked for 15-20.

A little disappointed these were not the cookies I remember as a kid. That said I tweaked the recipe by adding some vanilla and almond flavors. The next batch was good but still lacked something. So the third batch I made like thumbprints cookies and put a dollop of raspberry preserves in. These I'll make again!! Still looking for that recipe that was so good when I was a kid!
