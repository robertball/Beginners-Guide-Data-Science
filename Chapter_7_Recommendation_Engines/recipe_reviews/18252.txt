You all will think I'm crazy, but I cook a lot of Asian foods, including crispy won tons and lumpia (usually with ground pork), and I've never precooked the meat and vegetables before filling the skins.  I didn't this time either.  I just put all the ingredients in a bowl and shmooshed them together, then filled the egg roll skins with the raw ingredients.  This worked perfectly, and saved a lot of bother.  The deep frying process cooked the meat to a safe internal temperature; and to be doubly safe, I drained the cooked rolls in the oven on a rack set over a baking sheet at 200 degrees until the meal was ready. I used fresh garlic and ginger, and added about 1/2 tsp of 5 spice powder.  These came out fine, but frankly, I prefer the taste of ground pork.  When I make them again, that's what I'll use.

Wow! 
I followed the recipe exactly, except (1) I used two 16-oz bags of cole slaw to save a little work, (2) I added a can of bean sprouts, (3) I used spring roll wrappers because they were much cheaper and sounded fun, and (4) instead of deep-frying, I sprayed with canola on all sides, laid the rolls out on a cookie sheet, and baked at 400F for 25 minutes, turning them over after 15 minutes. (They still turned golden brown and needed blotting with paper towels, but I skipped the 2 qts of boiling oil part.)

They turned out really well, which was not a surprise ... but a little TOO meaty for my taste. Next time I'll reduce the meat or even leave it out altogether.

The spring roll wrappers came with about 60 in a package for $1.22, dry on the shelf. Dipping them in hot water and rolling was MUCH easier than I expected from the description (btw, many thanks to the previous reviewer's "goofy" face analogy!)

The biggest surprise? I made 12 full-size rolls, and have only used maybe 1/5 of my filling. I'll definitely be able to fill all 60 wrappers if I have that many. My ingredients, not counting seasonings, cost about $8, so these rolls cost less than a dime each. Thatâ€™s buying cole slaw mix and using 90% lean ground beef (which I still drained after browning)! If I'd cut up the cabbage, the cost would have plummeted to perhaps a nickel apiece.

Just like the restaurant version, I like these best with hot mustard, dipped in soy sauce. The recipe's definitely a winner!

Outstanding! I made very few changes: I browned the ground beef WITH the onion and garlic, drained it, then added the other ingredients in step 1. I omitted the sherry in step 1, and halved it in step 2, but when I tasted it I wished I hadn't because it tasted like it was missing something. Like other reviewers, I, too, added shredded carrots and celery. Next time I'll remember to add diced scallions also. I also drained the cabbage/beef mixture and LET IT COOL TO ROOM TEMP before attempting to wrap. Another thing: I could NOT find egg roll wrappers, so I used whole wheat tortilla wraps and they were great! But here's a tip on wrapping...it's kind of quirky so bear with me: Imagine your wrapper is a bald guy's face/head. Put your mixture where his mouth would be. Then, fold his "ears" in. The sides should be perfectly parallel. Begin rolling the wrap starting with the chin. BE SURE THAT THE OUTER EDGES STAY PARALLEL THE ENTIRE TIME! IF THEY BEGIN TO FORM A V, STRAIGHTEN THEM OUT AS YOU ROLL! Continue to wrap tightly. Once wrapped, dab a little water on the both wrap surfaces and roll wrap up in a towel for 3-5 minutes to "set." I used a dish towel that was lying around. Sorry for the goofy analogy, but I didn't know how else to describe it. Hope this helps! Finally, I started out deep frying these in a deep wok, but that didn't work out too well so then I did the rest of them in a deep frying pan with a more shallow amount of oil and they came out beautifully. Have fun!

These are wonderful if you lay them out on a cookie sheet and freeze then bag them. You can fix a couple to go with a meal whenever you want.

These eggrolls are great!! To save time, I used the preshredded cabbage in the salad section for coleslaw, and for more flavor, I added minced celery, shredded carrots, and green onions, and cooked the eggrolls in peanut oil. They also reheat nicely in the stove. Serve with your favorite Asian dish!!!

I too omitted the sherry.  Just a little hint in wrapping these.  I cool the mixture before wrapping, I make sure the filling doesn't have any liquid when wrapping.  This prevents the wrapper from breaking apart.  Also roll them tightly to keep them together.  Lots of fun to make!

I discovered this recipe about a month ago, and I've been asked to make it 4 or 5 times.  I substitute cooked chicken, and everyone always has seconds.  (I just need pointers on wrapping the egg rolls.)

Thanks so much.

WOW! A really great simple recipe that tasted fantastic! Even impressed the boyfriend with this one. Somethings I had to change: (1) I had no Sherry, so I did some online research and read that you can use a little vanilla extract as a substitute. Did that, thought it tasted great. (2) I used 1 bag of coleslaw mix thanks to another reviewers tip. (3) I rolled the eggrolls and then I brushed a thin coating of veg oil over the entire roll since I don't have canola. (4) I oven baked mine at 400F for about 20 minutes, rotating halfway through. Follow others advice and it came out fantastic. I plan on making a double recipe and then freezing them for my on the go lunches. Very please!   PS - didn't have any good dipping sauces, so dipped them in honey. WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The filling was excellent! I've made these egg rolls a few times. We love to dip them in sweet chili sauce. The first time I made them they were heavy & greasy. That depends on your wrapper texture, oil & your frying temperature. I prefer lumpia wrappers from the Asian market.

We loved these! I used white cooking wine rather than sherry and ditched the salt in the ground beef. Also, I sauteed my cabbage in sesame oil to up the Asian flavors and shredded up a carrot to go in the cabbage. (I used my cheese grater to shred up the veggies quickly!) Yes, they have a lot of beef, but my cabbage-phobic boyfriend loved every bite! Super quick and easy! I made them in the oven, but next time I'll deep fry them. As good as these were baked, I think they'll be amazing in the fryer!

I love this recipe and I have made it multiple times. I however do not use ground beef. I have used shrimp, beef(thin sliced), and chicken.    No matter what meat I choose it always turn out perfect and delicious...one of my families favorite meals. Also FYI if you have left over wrappers and left over taco stuff in the fridge, try wrapping the taco meat, salsa and cheese in the wrappers cook as you would the egg rolls, then top with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream. Yummy.

I've made this twice now but with chicken instead of beef, personal preference. I just diced up the chicken into a fine dice and sauted it as the reciped states. The first time I used fresh ginger, but it wasn't available the second time. It's good either way but I do prefer the fresh. Omitted the sherry. I also used a bag of shredded cabbage and a half of a bag of shredded carrots. The egg roll wrappers I purchased said to seal them, make a flour/water paste - equal parts. Use the paste on the seam. I didn't have any issues with them falling a part.

Super yummy! Only added some carrots.  Has a nice flavor even though it seems like it takes FOREVER; I will make again!  I did not add any extra salt because of the soy sauce.  Give this one a try, its very easy to make and you cant go wrong...add what you like.  Also I only used about half of a head of cabbage.  A+++ :D

Absolutely delicious!  I added a cup of fresh button mushrooms chopped into the cabbage mixture.  I also replaced the black pepper with a tsp of crushed red pepper flakes.  These were a hit with my entire family!

These are really good and easy. I had never deep fried before, so I read up on how important the temperature of the oil is and watched a few YouTube videos on making egg rolls. I got myself a thermometer just to make these. The only things I did differently, which are not really all that different, was to add carrots, let the filling cool before I filled the wrappers and use egg whites as a "sealant" for the wrapper. Will do again for sure!

Changed this up a lot because my son is vegetarian. Used vegetarian substitute beef (take your choice). Added shredded carrots and scallions and some hoison sauce, mirin and rice vinegar to taste. Everything was raw when I rolled up it and then let it rest covered in the fridge for a day and then deep fried it in canola oil.

I just made these for the second time and everybody absolutely loved them!! I only made minor changes: I used fresh (grated) ginger, and I added some Chinese five spice, a grated carrot, and a cup of bean sprouts.  Since I did not use sherry the first time I made it, I now have to advise not to omit it because it really changes the flavor (yummie!!). Thanks for this great recipe!

We liked this recipe because it uses all the simple ingredients one usually has on hand, and it can be assembled in the same pot! Very Tasty!
Note: The use of ground pork and shrimp can be used just as well. Thumbs up Trisha!

I decided to make these for dinner tonight and they came out great. Family members of mine used to make these alot when I was little and I decided to try them myself. I really enjoyed these, but I would probably eliminated the sherry next time(flavor is a bit strong) and add bean sprouts to my egg roll as a extra ingredient. Other than that, I appreciate you posting this recipe.

I didn't have enough soy sauce, thought I did.  But had a great flavor just the same, and was able to freeze some for later lunches.

This is my families favorite!  But instead of using beef we use ground pork.  Beef is great too, but the pork is our favorite.  I also use a package of cole slaw mix.  Saves time, and makes it super easy!

These were so delicious! It made a lot more than stated though. Make sure you don't get your fingers wet though or the wrappers tear very easily. I never would have thought making egg rolls was so easy. Not authentic asian egg rolls, but oh so wonderful and you just have to give these a try. We loved these! Thanks Trisha, I will definitely be making these again!

It takes a while to make these, but the result is absolutely  incredible!  I like a lot of meat in my egg rolls, so I decreased the cabbage content by about 1/3.  It made about a dozen egg rolls that were the best I'd ever had.  I can't stress enough the importance of getting them rolled TIGHT!  A little water spread on the top flap sealed them up well.

Very good! I froze them but when they were reheated in the microwave- they turned soft and mushy. I wouldnt expect for them to be crispy but unless they are going to be eaten at the moment of making them- I suggest freezing them and either refrying them or putting them in the oven. Other than that, they are delicious and will be made again!

Very good. I substituted a bag of broccolli slaw, ran it thru the food processor for a quick second to get the consistancy right.

This filling was great.  However, I used some spring rolls with instructions written entirely in Japanese!  I'm going to use egg rolls next time, and have already purchased them - in English.

Made this last night, along with Hunan Beef and Vegetable Fried Rice. Tasted just like the restaurants. Actually better since I was absolutely sure what was in them! (am a little wary of Chinese food just from lack of experience in eating it) I did have a issue with the flap on the wrappers staying closed when frying so next time I will use a little egg wash to tack them down. I also used shredded cabbage in a bag. Great recipe!

These were great!!! My husband always complains when I make egg rolls because they're never as good as my friends' when she makes them. This time he said, "These are the best egg rolls I've ever had in my life."  Thank you, HERCATE, for helping me surprise my husband. Hahaha!

I made this recipe for New Years Eve; they were great!! They are very close to my favorite Chinese Restaraunt. I made a few changes, nothing major. I used 2 bags of shredded cole slaw mix instead of a head of cabbage and cut the beef in half. I added 1 celery stalk sliced thin, and about 10 sliced water chestnuts (minced), and 2 tbls. dried chives. When the mixture was cool enough to handle I mixed in about 1 tbl. of sesame oil then squeezed all extra liquid from the mix before I rolled them. I served them with chinese hot mustard sauce and soy sauce. My husband loved them. Next time I think that I will double the recipe and freeze some for later as I make stir fry often.

This was my first attempt at egg rolls and quite fun to make.  I added carrots and left out the sherry as some suggested.  Defnitely let the mixture cool before stuffing, and moisten the last flap to keep it together when frying. I found it was best to drop them in the oil "folded flap side" up.  Kept them together better.

This recipe wasn't clear. It says to add spices and the sherry to the cooked beef, which I did. Nobody wanted a second helping.The flavors were extremely bland.

Amazing!!!  I didn't brown meat then cook cabbage separately, just combined all together.  Also when wrapping, I sealed with a touch of water, so it wouldn't separate.  Worked great.  Made a whole bunch and froze them, when needed will pop in micro or oven.  Thanks!!!!

My non Chinese food eating hubby can't get enough of these. I did simplify it and just used the pre-shredded package cole slow mix to save time. Huge hit with no leftovers. Will most definitely be making again. Thanks for the recipe.

This is the first time I've made any type of eggroll. I loved how simple the recipe is. I did add a half of a red bell pepper, thinly sliced. I also baked these instead of frying them. They turned out pretty and delicious.

My hubby really liked these the only change I made was to use coleslaw (1 1/2 Lb) instead of shredded cabbage.  The filling was still watery.  Next time I'm going to use 1/2 the sherry.  but over all a good recipe.   (I did use the extra water from the filling to moisten the egg rolls to seal them.)

My hubs is not much of a Chinese food guy.  I knew he'd at least try this since it had beef.  He loved them!!!!  My 10 year old son who will not eat ANYTHING gobbled them up.  I begged him to just take one bite.  Funny, that's all it took!  The recipe does make a LOT!  I froze half for another time.

This recipe was pretty good! I dont think id make it again with ground beef. And if i did i would add some sort of seasoning! Though there was a flavor, it wasnt all that fantastic, however i will make it again with changes to the recipe! Maybe a little more cabbage and less meat (probably pork)!

Fantastic Recipe and pretty easy to make. I also used coleslaw so I didnt have to cut up the cabbage, but other then that I followed the recipe fairly close (sometimes adding more soy sauce or garlic). 

I would buy two packs of egg roll wrappers because I still had quite a bit of mixture. Also, if you are rolling all of the eggrolls before frying, don't stack them on top of each other, the juice leaks onto other egg rolls causing tearage.

Definately tasty and simple. I went vegitarian and used shredded carrots instead of beef. Also used fresh ginger instead of ground. I did what other reviewers suggested and baked the rolls rather than frying, which was a mistake. The taste and texture of the wrappers was all wrong, so go ahead and deep fry even if it is a bit more oily!

Great recipe--make sure to have some dipping sauces on hand for added flavor. To save some calories, I sprayed mine with butter-flavored cooking spray and baked at 450 until lightly brown.

This is a very good recipe, but I always find a way to mess up.  I had a greasy disaster, but I deep fried the rolls and they ended up super saturated.  I am going to try again with chicken and adding carrots.

This recipe is great (and I am by no means "Suzi Homemaker")!  Even I was able to make these egg rolls, and they are delicious!  I used some of the suggestions in the other reviews (green onion and p-nut oil).  Instead of 1 lb gr beef, used 1/2 lb gr beef & 1/2 lb gr pork.  Will try shrimp next time.  Only problem is they are filling.  Was going to serve with some stir fry, but after eating one, I was full!  This is by no means a complaint, it was good.  Made 19, froze some...let's see how those cook up later! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This recipe was a,great base.  I did make a few omissions  (sherry, sugar).  I used ground turkey instead of beef, added 1tsp. of sesame oil, shredded carrots and cabbage (coleslaw mix), and 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger.

Delicious! I used ground chicken, and omitted the sherry and garlic...only because I didn't have any. I also added minced carrots. The whole family loved it. Pretty impressive when my 2 year old liked them.

I have made this recipe a number of times now. I absolutely love it!! it makes enough for us to make some and freeze some for later (it is just me and my husband). I never have ginger or sherry on hand, so I have always omitted it and I love it anyway!

These were great.  I gave it the full 5 stars as written even though I made changes.  Didn't have sherry so added extra soy sauce, didn't have sugar but did add two packets of splenda. The filling was good.  I chose to bake them at 400 for approx. 20 minutes.  I think these would be so much tastier fried as written.  Baked was ok but you don't get the crunchy texture frying gives you.

I've made these before but this time I used preshredded carrots and a bag of cabbage. The bag of cabbage had carrots and sprouts but I added more anyway. I also didn't really measure anything but the water and I used the water from the water chestnuts.  Everything else was just what I thought it needed, but this receipe gave me a very good guideline.  Also, I omited the sherry.Thanks for everyone else's suggestions too. Bon appitite  miraclesdohpn?

This recipe is amazing.. I used half a head of cabbage but kept everything the same. They were a good size and I made 21 and still had some left over filling. Will be making these again. We ate this with my own version of chicken fried rice and bourbon chicken.

We made this almost exactly as written, the only changes being fresh garlic and ginger and they were pretty great. I feel like a little more practice wrapping will make a better product but the filling is delicious and things I always have in the kitchen.

Absolutely yummy. I used a small strip sirlion steak I had left, sliced it very thinly and then again. I used packaged cole slaw, as suggested. Bought wrappers which were huge, deep fried them in a deep fry pan, 4 inches or so. The beef was pre-cooked but not the cole slaw - I think that is key. I used white wine instead of sherry. This is going in my recipe box!!! And will be shared and  used again. Thanks to HERCATE.

The best egg rolls my husband and I have ever had! I had used ham instead of beef, because that's what was leftover from the previous night's dinner. I also used a bag of Dole Asian Chopped Salad instead of a head of cabbage for ease and extra flavor.

It was good. I didn't add sugar and sherry- I don't like to add sweets in the food. I used white wine instead. This recipe definitely tastes much better than the one with shrimp.

I substituted chicken and these came out great.  Cooked chicken in 1tbs of olive oil, and used the same recipe for beef.  No onions as my wife doesn't care for them.  Premixed no sauce coleslaw with the carrots ...
Used red moscato (3tbs).  It came out delicious.

This has become a favorite in my family.  The first time I made it I made it close as I could to "as written" and it was fabulous.  Since then, I follow it "loosely" (tonight I didn't have sherry but I did have cooking red wine so I used that) and we enjoy it with whatever ingredients I have on hand.  Highly recommend!

Made this recipe exactly as stated except omitted the sherry because I didn't have any on hand.  Consequently, they just tasted like something was missing.  If I make these again, I will definitely try it with the sherry.  My family liked these, but I thought they were a little on the bland side.

I really did like this; however, one of my favorite eggroll "styles" is vietnamese where they use cellophane noodles instead of cabbage. I mixed in a little cabbage for variety... but I am sold on the cellophane type noodles. I also agree with Divine Health about browning the ground beef WITH the onion and garlic. I also like the idea of adding shredded carrot for some color and added texture...

This is an easy, simple, delicious recipe. I omitted the ginger(didn't have any) and cut down the cabbage to 2/3 of a small head and added 1/2 cup of shredded carrots. I had a little of the filling leftover so I used it in some fried rice. I will definitely make this again.

these are so good! made them for a group of friends tonight as a side dish to stir fry...never made egg rolls before so i was viewing it as a total experiment! only made two per person and i could have made a lot more...they loved them! some said they were the best egg rolls they have ever had. i cut down on the cabbage and added bean sprouts but otherwise pretty much followed the recipe. i will definitely be making these again, many times!

These were really very good! The whole family really liked them. I made them exactly like the recipe with only one change, I used celery salt, instead of the salt the recipe called for. The rolling up of the egg rolls was a bit tricky at first, but I finally got the hang of it. These were really good, will make again with the restaurant style fried rice from this site. Nice change from the weekly dinner rotation!

Im giving this 3 stars only because this is my first time making egg roles therefor i'm taking some of the blame. First of all i don't see why the cooking time is 20 minutes. they cook in 1-2 minutes in the oil. leaving them in for 20 minutes would be like asking for a heart attack :) i didnt have any sherry but i don't think that's an excuse for the lack of flavor. I was trying to show my dad off by making these but i think i will stick to my father's recipe.

People are going to start to think I give 5 starts to all my reviews.  I think it is because I only try ones that I think look good and will work.  This one was no exception.  I usually follow exactly but here are the changes I made and direction recomendations I have.

I made the follow substitutions:
Ground pork for beef
1/2 t of onion powder for onions.
1/2 t of garlic powder for dried garlic.

After everything was put back together in step 2, I poured everything into a screen colander because that amount of liquid would ruin the wrappers.  If you are not going to fry immediatly upon wrapping, I suggest to have them set on a paper towel.  They will continue to moisten the wrapper, and the paper towel will help aborb it away.

My wife said these were the best eggrolls she has ever had.

Used ground chicken instead of ground beef and tried someone's suggestion to bake in oven.  Won't do that again, egg rolls came out very hard, my son hated them.  The filling was great and next time I will try frying them instead.

We tried making egg rolls for the first time using this recipe and they were very simple and easy to make!  Just like you'd get in a restaurant! We changed the ingredients a little (reduced the amount of onion and added carrot slices to the cabbage).  A must try!

More flavor than I anticipated!  I like the cabbage a little softer, so that may be why.  Can be a little greasy if you use 73% or 80% lean beef, though.  Freezes well for single servings later.

These egg rolls were awesome!  My husband thought that I had bought them at the stoer and everyone loved them.  I even used ground turkey for the meat and no one noticed.  I didn't add the sherry.  I served them with a plum sauce that also tasted great.  I would totally recommend these to anyone. :)

EXCELLENT!!!!!
Definitely cool filling completely and drain all liquid before wrapping! Also, drop in peanut oil immediately after wrapping each roll. I found out the hard way that resting them on a plate destroys the wrapper! Don't skimp on the salt or soy sauce, and the carrot I added made a huge difference in taste and texture! AWESOME recipe! Thank you for sharing!

I liked this recipe overall but thought the sherry made it a touch too sweet.  For some reason, my husband and I didn't think the beef, soy sauce and sherry mixed well together.  It wasn't bad but I don't think I will be making this again.

These were really good. I didn't use a full head of cabbage and that may be why they turned out a bit salty. I also didn't have Sherry so I used a tablespoon of vanilla like another reviewer did. Next I will decrease the soy sauce in the cabbage. I think it will be great then.

Will most definitely make again. I did switch out beef for pork sausage, and cabbage for cold slaw mix, but other than that followed the recipe as written. Makes a good flavorful egg roll, does not have a strong cabbage flavor as some of the egg rolls I have tried.

This was really good. It did take a lot longer to prep everything too. Also don't use spring roll wrappers hold out for the egg roll wrappers. The work better

I've been making these Egg Rolls for years, but instead of deep frying them, I spray a foil lined cookie tray with cooking spray.  I put the assembled egg rolls on the tray and spray the tops with the cooking spray too.  I put them in a 425 degree pre-heated oven and cook them for 15 minutes, then I remove the tray, flip them over and cook for another 10 minutes.  I remove them from the oven and allow them to cool 5-10 minutes.  Delicious every time and no oil to dispose of.  Everyone I've ever served them to loved them, as do I.

The recipe turned out very well. I cooked them like pot stickers instead of egg rolls to cut down on the oil. Next time I make them, I might add a little more of the spices. They were good, but I like them a little spicier.

I've made this recipe several times.   The only change I made is I use bag of pre-chopped slaw cabbage. Also, instead of frying, I sprayed both sides of the rolls with cooking spray and bake for 20-25 minutes turning over once.  I usually make a double batch (about 40) and freeze what we don't eat immediately.  Doesn't matter they are all gone in about a week!

You should only use spring roll wrappers as wonton wrappers are too thick, they can be found in the freezer section. keep them frozen until the day you plan to make the spring rolls as they dry out VERY fast. Also thoroughly drain the meat and veg, mixture. I make dozens of these and freeze.  Then fry from frozen when you want them.

I tried this recipe, and boy was it delicious! It tastes just like an egg roll from a Chinese food restaurant, seriously. I usually don't like to make changes, but I didn't have any vinegar on hand, so I used half brown sugar and half white. I didn't have cabbage, so I used a bag of frozen Brussel sprouts, thawed and sliced up. I also added some bean sprouts, only because I live bean sprouts in my egg rolls, dried celery flakes is also a good additional seasoning for a authentic Chinese flavor. my family loved these egg rolls and so did I. I will definitely make these again with the sweet & sour chicken ll from this site. Awesome! thanks.

I like the sherry addition, but used Jimmy Dean pork sausage (the one in the roll), added FRESH sprouts found in produce area, and water chestnuts.  I also baked them for 25 minutes, 350 degree oven.  Yummy!  Used San J Thai Peanut sauce on the side for dipping, really tasty!!

I cook these often. I use fresh garlic and ginger and that makes a HUGE difference! I used wine instead of sherry and nappa cabbage or Asian cole slaw. Love it.

I have tried this recipe quite a few time now.  I do use the coleslaw mix which makes it much more simple.  It's quite meaty so I use 2 bags of coleslaw mix and 2 packs of eggroll wrappers.  I just add a little extra on the sherry and seasonings.  This is a favorite at my house, and truly I think better than any bought eggroll.  The sherry does something special for this recipe.

I thought these came out all right. That may have been my fault though. I baked these instead of fried to cut the fat. The texture of the wrapper came out on the tougher side which killed the overall quality of the egg rolls. I also omitted the sherry as I didn't see the need (and because I didn't have any). I served these as a late night snack for a few of my friends. One of them made a slightly sweet soy dipping sauce and I made a creamy wasabi dipping sauce.

These are the first Egg Rolls I have made.  They were a hit with the family, but I'm going to keep experimenting to perfect them.  I added Bean Sprouts and grated carrot, but next time will add mushrooms and green onions as well.  Make sure the filling is well drained or the rolling gets sloppy.  They cook fast, so it's best to have them all done (put them on a cooky sheet) to await their turn to cook.  Also trying a few different sauces for dipping.  This is a good recipe with easy ingredients.

I have been making a similar recipe to this for years. I got it from a friend's grandmother who is Filipino and they are delicious! Her recipe also has carrots and celery as well.  These take a little while to make but they are sooooooo delicious!!

This recipe is excellent!  My daughter loves egg rolls, but is also extremely picky...she LOVED them!  The only change I made to the recipe is that I added canned miniature shrimp.  It turned out great.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was super oily but a great combo of ingredients.  I think I'll experiment with baking the rolls rather than sauteing ingredients in oil, then frying in oil.

These turned out so good. I love making different kinds of egg rolls. 
I will make these again but I'll probably half the soy sauce because they turned out really salty. 
Everyone should try these!

Made these for a Christmas party and everyone really enjoyed them.  I've never made egg rolls before and they went together very easy.  Thanks for the recipe Trisha.

Like with meatballs, putting these in the freezer for a few minutes before deep-frying makes handling a little easier.  Also, I only used 2 tablespoons filling for each eggroll.

Great recipe!

I have mde these twice now and they have turned out great each time.  I added bean sprouts this last time and it made so much, I was able to freeze some for next time.  Quick and easy.  Make sure you let the mixture cool completely before you roll and fry. A Keeper!!

I used shrimp instead of ground beef. This was very easy and quickly became 1 of my husbands favorite things for me to cook.  The only problem I had was I had to purchase a bigger frying pan!

Yummy!! These were good, very good! I omitted the sherry. And I only used about 3/4 of a small head of cabbage. In the future, I would use about Â½ of a small head, at most.. But I like my egg rolls more meaty. I added some julienne carrots, chopped small, but I won't do that again because one egg roll got punctured by a carrot. :) Still worked, though! I also added about Â½ can of bean sprouts. I would have bought the fresh ones, but they weren't as 'fresh' as they should have been. One thing: At the end of mixing, when the cabbage and meat mixtures were combined, I ended up with a lot of liquid in the bottom of the bowl. I drained the mixture, but a lot of the flavor drained out too! I'll have to try to fix that in the future, but this was an amazing recipe. And the little leftover filling tasted great by itself! Thanks, Trisha!

The recipe was awesome!  Great flavour, and easy to make.  I did leave out the Sherry as others had suggested and I used the bagged coleslaw instead of chopping up the cabbage.  Great recipe! Thx Trisha
