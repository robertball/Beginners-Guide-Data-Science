Effortless and delicious! This was perfect for a quick and easy lunch. It's not only tasty but full of vibrant colors and flavors. I used feta cheese and added some thin sliced Granny Smith apple. I didn't have almonds, so I used some toasted walnuts. I opted not to use the balsamic dressing. Instead I used "Red Raspberry Vinaigrette" from this site. Overall, very good!

This was fabulous.  And I didn't serve it immediately and it was still good!  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

This was absolutely delicious but I did tweak the recipe.  I used a bag of mixed salad greens instead of spinach, used 1/4 cup red onions, 2 tbs. sliced almonds, mixed 3 tablespoons of orange juice with light balsamic vinagrette dressing and added crumbled goat cheese. It was fabulous.

LOVED this salad!  It is super simple and super great.  One of the most flavorful mix and I normally don't even like oranges or cranberries.  Family favorite and I am sure we will make again and again!

I made this for Christmas with family, and for an casual lunch with friends.  It fit both perfectly...fancy or casual.  I used pecans instead of almonds.  The colors and flavors went together beautifully!  Yummy, easy salad! For lunch with friends, we just fixed this with breadsticks.  They all loved it!

I've made countless spinach salads with feta, nuts, and cranberries, but this one appealed to me because of the orange juice and zest.  It goes really well with the cranberries and gives the salad a freshness.  I made 1/2 recipe of the balsamic vinaigrette recipe from this site and added the orange juice and zest.  Great salad!

The salad is good but the dressing was just way to strong....won't make this one again unless I doctor it up quite abit.

pretty good. I added less red onion and more almonds (not toasted). The dressing needs more orange juice, I couldn't taste it as is. I didn't have orange zest.
