I made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner and my family loved it.  I did, however add more onion and celery to the recipe to better suite my family's taste.  I will definitely be making this dressing for Christmas dinner also.

Outstanding! My whole family (even picky mom, the dressing expert) loved this. I also added a tsp of poultry seasoning as well as some diced chicken breast I had boiled in the chicken broth. Thank you for the great recipe.

This is yummy. I did however add more sage, because my family loves it really full of sage. But that is our family's opinion, and I think this would be great without the addition.

Add 1 teaspoon of poultry seasoning, extra celery and only add 4 cups of broth. With these changes, excellent recipe.

I love this recipe!!! I added a little more sage&poultry seasoning plus added more celery & onion. A little trick i learned from my mother is adding some cream of chicken& cream of celery soup to my dressing and it tastes sooo good.

This is a fantastic recipe. I put 2 cups less broth and only 2 eggs to make it a little drier.

Turned out great.  I made this for thanksgiving and all agreed it was a keeper.  I used Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread recipe from this site. It was a little too sweet, next time I'll reduce the sugar.  the recipe says 6 servings but fills a 9 x 14 pan. Changing the serving size to 8 is perfect for a 10 x 15 pan.

I tried this recipe for my family for Sunday dinner and they loved it! It was much simpler than some recipes I had tried in the past, i did leave out the celery because my family doesnt like it. I will definately make this again

I added chicken I baked in the oven and then shredded. I donâ€™t know the exact amount of sage but it was close to 10-15 shakes. I used 2 bags of cornbread mix and extra onions and celery. I also used cream of chicken with no eggs. And 3-4 cups of the broth. As always it turned out amazing
