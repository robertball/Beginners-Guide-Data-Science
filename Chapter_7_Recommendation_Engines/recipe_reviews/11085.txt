Very good cookies! I used Megan's Granola from this site, 1/2 cup of pecans instead of walnuts, part WW pastry flour, part shortening, and only 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and 1 cup raisins. Crisp on the outside and very chewy and delicious.

Followed directions and overall it worked out fine.  Processing took a bit longer than instructed even though I let the butter sit out all day.  I baked on parchment paper and at 12 minutes the cookies were overdone.  I backed it down to 11 minutes and they were much prettier.  I don't think microwaving the nuts and oats actually "toasted" them.  DH said they were great and would like it if I made them again.

Very nice cookie..........I used a hand mixer instead of a foodprocessor and still worked out fine.  Couldn't believe I could add all those dry ingredients.  Key to chewy cookie is not overbaking.......follow instructions and will be fine.

It is the oatmeal cookie that helps me use ingredients that invade my house. It is both delicious and nutritious. Amazing.

Simple recipe, easy to follow. The recipe suggests 2T of dough per cookie, which would make some petty big cookies! I made smaller cookies, and slightly decreased the baking time. They turned out well.  Crispy  outside, but chewy inside. Don't over-bake; pull them out while the centers are still soft, as the recipe suggests!.
