Loved this recipe, the steak creates a nice chew while the potato gives it a good texture. The tomato make it burst with taste. Used barbecue rub instead of Italian dressing, but it was a family hit. A++

The food was delicious! Make sure to stir the potatoes constantly when its in the skillet; i was occupied with something else and almost burned the seasoning off, but it still came out wonderful. For the salt portion, I used season salt because it gives the "salt" taste more than regular salt and it makes the potatoes look nicer to me. plus the directions are straight to the point. I'm going to make this again!

Adding to my previous review/comments, I also cooked the potatoes in a frying pan with Ghee and butter since the Ghee has a higher smoking point.  I think that added richness to this dish as well.

I used cauliflour veggie tots instead of the potato and it worked well.

I made a version of this for breakfast.  I had steak and potatoes leftover from dinner.  I wanted to use up the leftovers and create a different breakfast.  I added freshly minced garlic and fresh rosemary.  I didn't have the tomatoes so they were omitted.  I soft boiled the eggs and served them on top on the hash.  It was delicious and a great use for leftovers.

This recipe is very good. I forgot to add the Italian seasoning, however it still tasted good! My only worry was that without any grease the beef and the potatoes would stick to the pan. I was right, so I used a bit of vegetable oil no more than a tablespoon for the entire recipe more or less. I used a teaspoon for cooking the beef and 2 teaspoons for cooking out through the rest of the recipe.  Hopefully next time I try it, I won't forget the spice!
