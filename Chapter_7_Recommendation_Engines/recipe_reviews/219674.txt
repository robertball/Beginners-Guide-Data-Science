These were pretty good.  I do wish they had more bite to them.  If I make these again I will add some cloves and some fresh grated ginger to them.  I topped them with lemon curd and fresh whipped cream.

Wow! These were great. Super hands on and easy to make, try adding a bit of clove. It took the cupcakes to the next level. My friends loved them, I have a good recipe that goes along with it. Check out my profile to see it.
Over all, awesome cupcakes!

These were delicious! I added 1/8 teaspoon of cloves and it made them much better! The top has a slight crisp and the center is moist and airy. Instead of buttermilk, I did the required amount of milk but I used skim milk and added 1 tablespoon of white vinegar and let it sit and curdle for 10 minutes. If you find the cake dense, simply add the vinegar and skim milk as it will improve the texture!

Very subtle flavor, though I will say I didn't have molasses so I substituted brown sugar (as another website suggested) This may have been the reason for the light flavor. The cupcakes were still delicious and I will make them again using the molasses. By the way, once they've cooled, be sure to put them in an airtight container so they stay moist.

I changed a few things: Decreased oil to 1.4c (1/3 isn't too much, but less fat soooo ... & my eggs were kinda small, too.  More egg dries.); increased cinnamon to 1 1/2t; added 1/8t cloves & 1/2t vanilla; as listed 1 1/2t ginger & 1/4t nutmeg.  Oh, used a yellow mix. Oh, :D, subbed plain yogurt for the buttermilk.  Too many changes?!  Sorry.  I was going for the 24 regular sized, but they would've been pretty low so made 18.  The batter's pretty syrupy, understandably with molasses & 4 eggs, so I see the suggestion of plastic bagging it.  'Didn't do it.  Just know it's going to be challenging.  The directions!  What?!  Just till combined?  What?!  Nah.  I added the spices to the dry mix.  In a measuring cup, measured the oil, added the molasses to the 3/4 level, mixed in the half cup yogurt.  Added to bowl.  Beat the eggs a little in that measuring cup & added with the vanilla.  One minute to moisten, a couple to blend.  Anxious to try.  Results: I overbaked since the middle was low.  'Just okay.  'Not much ginger bite.  'Feel like I wasted the molasses on this one.  :(  Surprisingly not too sweet with the sugar in the mix & the molasses.
